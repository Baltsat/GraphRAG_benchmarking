Preceded and followed by thousands, with colours flying,
trumpets sounding, and endless huzzas, flags and handkerchiefs waving
from every window, and every balcony filled with dames and maidens
bedecked with his colours, Coningsby was borne through enthusiastic
Darlford like Paulus Emilius returning from Macedon.Uncovered, still
in deep mourning, his fine figure, and graceful bearing, and his
intelligent brow, at once won every female heart.The singularity was, that all were of the same opinion: everybody
cheered him, every house was adorned with his colours.His triumphal
return was no party question.Magog Wrath and Bully Bluck walked
together like lambs at the head of his procession.The car stopped before the principal hotel in the High Street.The broad street was so crowded, that, as
every one declared, you might have walked on the heads of the people.Every window was full; the very roofs were peopled.The car stopped,
and the populace gave three cheers for Mr.Their late member,
surrounded by his friends, stood in the balcony, which was fitted up
with Coningsby's colours, and bore his name on the hangings in gigantic
letters formed of dahlias.The flashing and inquiring eye of Coningsby
caught the form of Edith, who was leaning on her father's arm.The hustings were opposite the hotel, and here, after a while, Coningsby
was carried, and, stepping from his car, took up his post to address,
for the first time, a public assembly.Anxious as the people were
to hear him, it was long before their enthusiasm could subside into
silence.He spoke; his
powerful and rich tones reached every ear.In five minutes' time every
one looked at his neighbour, and without speaking they agreed that there
never was anything like this heard in Darlford before.He addressed them for a considerable time, for he had a great deal to
say; not only to express his gratitude for the unprecedented manner in
which he had become their representative, and for the spirit in which
they had greeted him, but he had to offer them no niggard exposition
of the views and opinions of the member whom they had so confidingly
chosen, without even a formal declaration of his sentiments.He did this with so much clearness, and in a manner so pointed and
popular, that the deep attention of the multitude never wavered.His
lively illustrations kept them often in continued merriment.But when,
towards his close, he drew some picture of what he hoped might be the
character of his future and lasting connection with the town, the vast
throng was singularly affected.There were a great many present at that
moment who, though they had never seen Coningsby before, would willingly
have then died for him.Coningsby had touched their hearts, for he had
spoken from his own.Darlford
believed in Coningsby: and a very good creed.And now Coningsby was conducted to the opposite hotel.The progress was slow, as every one wished to shake hands
with him.His friends, however, at last safely landed him.He sprang
up the stairs; he was met by Mr.Millbank, who welcomed him with the
greatest warmth, and offered his hearty congratulations.'It is to you, dear sir, that I am indebted for all this,' said
Coningsby.Millbank, 'it is to your own high principles, great
talents, and good heart.'After he had been presented by the late member to the principal
personages in the borough, Mr.Millbank said,

'I think we must now give Mr.Come with me,' he
added, 'here is some one who will be very glad to see you.'Speaking thus, he led our hero a little away, and placing his arm in
Coningsby's with great affection opened the door of an apartment.There
was Edith, radiant with loveliness and beaming with love.Their agitated
hearts told at a glance the tumult of their joy.The father joined their
hands, and blessed them with words of tenderness.The marriage of Coningsby and Edith took place early in the autumn.It was solemnised at Millbank, and they passed their first moon at
Hellingsley, which place was in future to be the residence of the member
for Darlford.The estate was to devolve to Coningsby after the death of
Mr.Millbank, who in the meantime made arrangements which permitted
the newly-married couple to reside at the Hall in a manner becoming its
occupants.Millbank assured Coningsby,
were effected not only with the sanction, but at the express instance,
of his son.An event, however, occurred not very long after the marriage of
Coningsby, which rendered this generous conduct of his father-in-law no
longer necessary to his fortunes, though he never forgot its exercise.The gentle and unhappy daughter of Lord Monmouth quitted a scene with
which her spirit had never greatly sympathised.Perhaps she might have
lingered in life for yet a little while, had it not been for that fatal
inheritance which disturbed her peace and embittered her days, haunting
her heart with the recollection that she had been the unconscious
instrument of injuring the only being whom she loved, and embarrassing
and encumbering her with duties foreign to her experience and her
nature.The marriage of Coningsby had greatly affected her, and from
that day she seemed gradually to decline.She died towards the end
of the autumn, and, subject to an ample annuity to Villebecque, she
bequeathed the whole of her fortune to the husband of Edith.Gratifying
as it was to him to present such an inheritance to his wife, it was not
without a pang that he received the intelligence of the death of Flora.Edith sympathised in his affectionate feelings, and they raised a
monument to her memory in the gardens of Hellingsley.Coningsby passed his next Christmas in his own hall with his beautiful
and gifted wife by his side, and surrounded by the friends of his heart
and his youth.They stand now on the threshold of public life.They are in the leash,
but in a moment they will be slipped.Will they
maintain in august assemblies and high places the great truths which, in
study and in solitude, they have embraced?Or will their courage exhaust
itself in the struggle, their enthusiasm evaporate before hollow-hearted
ridicule, their generous impulses yield with a vulgar catastrophe to the
tawdry temptations of a low ambition?Will their skilled intelligence
subside into being the adroit tool of a corrupt party?Will Vanity
confound their fortunes, or Jealousy wither their sympathies?Or will
they remain brave, single, and true; refuse to bow before shadows and
worship phrases; sensible of the greatness of their position, recognise
the greatness of their duties; denounce to a perplexed and disheartened
world the frigid theories of a generalising age that have destroyed
the individuality of man, and restore the happiness of their country by
believing in their own energies, and daring to be great?King James sends a letter written and directed
by his own hand to several of the Privy Council, and one to his
daughter, the Queen Regent, informing them of the Queen being ready to
be brought to bed, and summoning them to be at the birth by the middle
of May, promising as from the French King, permission to come and return
in safety.Much apprehension of a French invasion, and of an
universal rising.Unkindness
between the Queen and her sister.Very cold and unseasonable weather,
scarce a leaf on the trees.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th May, 1692.Reports of an invasion were very hot, and alarmed the
city, Court, and people; nothing but securing suspected persons, sending
forces to the seaside, and hastening out the fleet.Continued discourse
of the French invasion, and of ours in France.The eastern wind so
constantly blowing, gave our fleet time to unite, which had been so
tardy in preparation, that, had not God thus wonderfully favored, the
enemy would in all probability have fallen upon us.Many daily secured,
and proclamations out for more conspirators.My kinsman, Sir Edward Evelyn, of Long Ditton, died
suddenly.I dined at my cousin Cheny's, son to my Lord Cheny, who
married my cousin Pierpoint.My niece, M. Evelyn, was now married to Sir Cyril Wyche,
Secretary of State for Ireland.After all our apprehensions of being
invaded, and doubts of our success by sea, it pleased God to give us a
great naval victory, to the utter ruin of the French fleet, their
admiral and all their best men-of-war, transport-ships, etc.Though this day was set apart expressly for celebrating
the memorable birth, return, and restoration of the late King Charles
II., there was no notice taken of it, nor any part of the office annexed
to the Common Prayer Book made use of, which I think was ill done, in
regard his restoration not only redeemed us from anarchy and confusion,
but restored the Church of England as it were miraculously.I went to Windsor to carry my grandson to Eton School,
where I met my Lady Stonehouse and other of my daughter-in-law's
relations, who came on purpose to see her before her journey into
Ireland.We went to see the castle, which we found furnished and very
neatly kept, as formerly, only that the arms in the guard chamber and
keep were removed and carried away.An exceeding great storm of wind and
rain, in some places stripping the trees of their fruit and leaves as if
it had been winter; and an extraordinary wet season, with great floods.I went with my wife, son, and daughter, to Eton, to see
my grandson, and thence to my Lord Godolphin's, at Cranburn, where we
lay, and were most honorably entertained.George's
Chapel, and returned to London late in the evening.Hewer's at Clapham, where he has an excellent,
useful, and capacious house on the Common, built by Sir Den.Gauden, and
by him sold to Mr.Hewer, who got a very considerable estate in the
Navy, in which, from being Mr.Pepys's clerk, he came to be one of the
principal officers, but was put out of all employment on the Revolution,
as were all the best officers, on suspicion of being no friends to the
change; such were put in their places, as were most shamefully ignorant
and unfit.Hewer lives very handsomely and friendly to everybody.Our fleet was now sailing on their long pretense of a descent on the
French coast; but, after having sailed one hundred leagues, returned,
the admiral and officers disagreeing as to the place where they were to
land, and the time of year being so far spent,--to the great dishonor of
those at the helm, who concerted their matters so indiscreetly, or, as
some thought, designedly.This whole summer was exceedingly wet and rainy, the like had not been
known since the year 1648; while in Ireland they had not known so great
a drought.I went to visit the Bishop of Lincoln, when, among
other things, he told me that one Dr.Chaplin, of University College in
Oxford, was the person who wrote the "Whole Duty of Man"; that he used
to read it to his pupil, and communicated it to Dr.Sterne, afterward
Archbishop of York, but would never suffer any of his pupils to have a
copy of it.Came the sad news of the hurricane and
earthquake, which has destroyed almost the whole Island of Jamaica, many
thousands having perished.My son, his wife, and little daughter, went for
Ireland, there to reside as one of the Commissioners of the Revenue.There happened an earthquake, which, though not so
great as to do any harm in England, was universal in all these parts of
Europe.It shook the house at Wotton, but was not perceived by any save
a servant or two, who were making my bed, and another in a garret.I and
the rest being at dinner below in the parlor, were not sensible of it.The dreadful one in Jamaica this summer was profanely and ludicrously
represented in a puppet play, or some such lewd pastime, in the fair of
Southwark, which caused the Queen to put down that idle and vicious mock
show.This season was so exceedingly cold, by reason of a
long and tempestuous northeast wind, that this usually pleasant month
was very uncomfortable.Harbord dies at
Belgrade; Lord Paget sent Ambassador in his room.There was a vestry called about repairing or new
building of the church [at Deptford], which I thought unseasonable in
regard of heavy taxes, and other improper circumstances, which I there
declared.A solemn Thanksgiving for our victory at sea, safe
return of the King, etc.Lancaster, the new Vicar of St.A signal robbery in Hertfordshire of the tax money bringing out of the
north toward London.They were set upon by several desperate persons,
who dismounted and stopped all travelers on the road, and guarding them
in a field, when the exploit was done, and the treasure taken, they
killed all the horses of those whom they stayed, to hinder pursuit,
being sixteen horses.They then dismissed those that they had
dismounted.With much reluctance we gratified Sir J.
Rotherham, one of Mr.Boyle's trustees, by admitting the Bishop of Bath
and Wells to be lecturer for the next year, instead of Mr.Bentley, who
had so worthily acquitted himself.We intended to take him in again the
next year.[Sidenote: LONDON]

January, 1692-93.Contest in Parliament about a self-denying Act, that
no Parliament man should have any office; it wanted only two or three
voices to have been carried.The Duke of Norfolk's bill for a divorce
thrown out, he having managed it very indiscreetly.The quarrel between
Admiral Russell and Lord Nottingham yet undetermined.After five days' trial and extraordinary contest,
the Lord Mohun was acquitted by the Lords of the murder of Montford, the
player, notwithstanding the judges, from the pregnant witnesses of the
fact, had declared him guilty; but whether in commiseration of his
youth, being not eighteen years old, though exceedingly dissolute, or
upon whatever other reason, the King himself present some part of the
trial, and satisfied, as they report, that he was culpable.69 acquitted
him, only 14 condemned him.Unheard of stories of the universal increase of witches in New England;
men, women, and children, devoting themselves to the devil, so as to
threaten the subversion of the government.[79] At the same time there
was a conspiracy among the <DW64>s in Barbadoes to murder all their
masters, discovered by overhearing a discourse of two of the slaves, and
so preventing the execution of the design.France in the utmost misery and poverty for want of corn and
subsistence, while the ambitious King is intent to pursue his conquests
on the rest of his neighbors both by sea and land.Our Admiral, Russell,
laid aside for not pursuing the advantage he had obtained over the
French in the past summer; three others chosen in his place.Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury's book burned by the hangman for an expression of
the King's title by conquest, on a complaint of Joseph How, a member of
Parliament, little better than a madman.[Footnote 79: Some account of these poor people is given in Bray and
    Manning's "History of Surrey," ii.Miller, Vicar of Effingham, in that county, who was chaplain to
    the King's forces in the colony from 1692 to 1695.Some of the
    accused were convicted and executed; but Sir William Phipps, the
    Governor, had the good sense to reprieve, and afterward pardon,
    several; and the Queen approved his conduct.]The Bishop of Lincoln preached in the afternoon at
the Tabernacle near Golden Square, set up by him.Proposals of a
marriage between Mr.Hitherto an
exceedingly warm winter, such as has seldom been known, and portending
an unprosperous spring as to the fruits of the earth; our climate
requires more cold and winterly weather.The dreadful and astonishing
earthquake swallowing up Catania, and other famous and ancient cities,
with more than 100,000 persons in Sicily, on 11th January last, came now
to be reported among us.An extraordinary deep snow, after almost no winter,
and a sudden gentle thaw.A deplorable earthquake at Malta, since that
of Sicily, nearly as great.A new Secretary of State, Sir John Trenchard; the
Attorney-General, Somers, made Lord-Keeper, a young lawyer of
extraordinary merit.King William goes toward Flanders; but returns, the
wind being contrary.I met the King going to Gravesend to embark in his
yacht for Holland.My daughter Susanna was married to William Draper,
Esq., in the chapel of Ely House, by Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln
(since Archbishop).I gave her in portion L4,000, her jointure is L500
per annum.I pray Almighty God to give his blessing to this marriage!She is a good child, religious, discreet, ingenious, and qualified with
all the ornaments of her sex.She has a peculiar talent in design, as
painting in oil and miniature, and an extraordinary genius for whatever
hands can do with a needle.She has the French tongue, has read most of
the Greek and Roman authors and poets, using her talents with great
modesty; exquisitely shaped, and of an agreeable countenance.This
character is due to her, though coming from her father.Much of this
week spent in ceremonies, receiving visits and entertaining relations,
and a great part of the next in returning visits.We accompanied my daughter to her husband's house,
where with many of his and our relations we were magnificently treated.There we left her in an apartment very richly adorned and furnished, and
I hope in as happy a condition as could be wished, and with the great
satisfaction of all our friends; for which God be praised!Muttering of a design
to bring forces under color of an expected descent, to be a standing
army for other purposes.Talk of a declaration of the French King,
offering mighty advantages to the confederates, exclusive of King
William; and another of King James, with an universal pardon, and
referring the composing of all differences to a Parliament.These were
yet but discourses; but something is certainly under it.A declaration
or manifesto from King James, so written, that many thought it
reasonable, and much more to the purpose than any of his former.I went to my Lord Griffith's chapel; the common
church office was used for the King without naming the person, with some
other, apposite to the necessity and circumstances of the time.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's; and, after evening
prayer, visited the Duchess of Grafton.I saw a great auction of pictures in the Banqueting
house, Whitehall.They had been my Lord Melford's, now Ambassador from
King James at Rome, and engaged to his creditors here.Lord Mulgrave and
Sir Edward Seymour came to my house, and desired me to go with them to
the sale.Divers more of the great lords, etc., were there, and bought
pictures dear enough.There were some very excellent of Vandyke, Rubens,
and Bassan.Lord Godolphin bought the picture of the Boys, by Murillo
the Spaniard, for 80 guineas, dear enough; my nephew Glanville, the old
Earl of Arundel's head by Rubens, for L20.Growing late, I did not stay
till all were sold.A very wet hay harvest, and little summer as yet.Parr at Camberwell,
preached an excellent sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1693.I saw the Queen's rare cabinets and collection of
china; which was wonderfully rich and plentiful, but especially a large
cabinet, looking-glass frame and stands, all of amber, much of it white,
with historical bas-reliefs and statues, with medals carved in them,
esteemed worth L4,000, sent by the Duke of Brandenburgh, whose country,
Prussia, abounds with amber, cast up by the sea; divers other China and
Indian cabinets, screens, and hangings.In her library were many books
in English, French, and Dutch, of all sorts; a cupboard of gold plate; a
cabinet of silver filagree, which I think was our Queen Mary's, and
which, in my opinion, should have been generously sent to her.I dined with Lord Mulgrave, with the Earl of
Devonshire, Mr.Hampden (a scholar and fine gentleman), Dr.Davenant,
Sir Henry Vane, and others, and saw and admired the Venus of Correggio,
which Lord Mulgrave had newly bought of Mr.Daun for L250; one of the
best paintings I ever saw.Lord Capel, Sir Cyril Wyche, and Mr.Duncomb, made
Lord Justices in Ireland; Lord Sydney recalled, and made Master of the
Ordnance.Very lovely harvest weather, and a wholesome season,
but no garden fruit.Lord Nottingham resigned as Secretary of State; the
Commissioners of the Admiralty ousted, and Russell restored to his
office.The season continued very wet, as it had nearly all the summer,
if one might call it summer, in which there was no fruit, but corn was
very plentiful.In the lottery set up after the Venetian manner by
Mr.Neale, Sir R. Haddock, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, had the
greatest lot, L3,000; my coachman L40.Was the funeral of Captain Young, who died of the
stone and great age.I think he was the first who in the first war with
Cromwell against Spain, took the Governor of Havanna, and another rich
prize, and struck the first stroke against the Dutch fleet in the first
war with Holland in the time of the Rebellion; a sober man and an
excellent seaman.Much importuned to take the office of President of
the Royal Society, but I again declined it.We all dined at Pontac's as usual.Bentley preached at the Tabernacle, near Golden
Square.I gave my voice for him to proceed on his former subject the
following year in Mr.Boyle's lecture, in which he had been interrupted
by the importunity of Sir J. Rotheram that the Bishop of Chichester[80]
might be chosen the year before, to the great dissatisfaction of the
Bishop of Lincoln and myself.The Duchess of
Grafton's appeal to the House of Lords for the Prothonotary's place
given to the late Duke and to her son by King Charles II., now
challenged by the Lord Chief Justice.The judges were severely reproved
on something they said.[Footnote 80: A mistake for Bath and Wells.Bishop Kidder is
    referred to.]Prince Lewis of Baden came to London, and was much
feasted.Danish ships arrested carrying corn and naval stores to France.Dryden, the poet, who now intended to write no more plays, being intent
on his translation of Virgil.He read to us his prologue and epilogue to
his valedictory play now shortly to be acted.Lord Macclesfield, Lord Warrington, and Lord
Westmorland, all died within about one week.Several persons shot,
hanged, and made away with themselves.Now was the great trial of the appeal of Lord Bath
and Lord Montagu before the Lords, for the estate of the late Duke of
Albemarle.Stringfellow preached at Trinity parish, being
restored to that place, after the contest between the Queen and the
Bishop of London who had displaced him.Came the dismal news of the disaster befallen our
Turkey fleet by tempest, to the almost utter ruin of that trade, the
convoy of three or four men-of-war, and divers merchant ships, with all
their men and lading, having perished.[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th March, 1694.Martin's, preached; he was
likewise put in by the Queen, on the issue of her process with the
Bishop of London.I went to the Duke of Norfolk, to desire him to make
cousin Evelyn of Nutfield one of the Deputy-Lieutenants of Surrey, and
entreat him to dismiss my brother, now unable to serve by reason of age
and infirmity.The Duke granted the one, but would not suffer my brother
to resign his commission, desiring he should keep the honor of it during
his life, though he could not act.He professed great kindness to our
family.Sharp, Archbishop of York, preached in the
afternoon at the Tabernacle, by Soho.Bentley, our Boyle Lecturer, Chaplain to the
Bishop of Worcester, came to see me.A fiery exhalation rising out of the sea, spread itself
in Montgomeryshire a furlong broad, and many miles in length, burning
all straw, hay, thatch, and grass, but doing no harm to trees, timber,
or any solid things, only firing barns, or thatched houses.It left such
a taint on the grass as to kill all the cattle that eat of it.I saw the
attestations in the hands of the sufferers."The
Berkeley Castle" sunk by the French coming from the East Indies, worth
L200,000.The French took our castle of Gamboo in Guinea, so that the
Africa Actions fell to L30, and the India to L80.Some regiments of
Highland Dragoons were on their march through England; they were of
large stature, well appointed and disciplined.One of them having
reproached a Dutchman for cowardice in our late fight, was attacked by
two Dutchmen, when with his sword he struck off the head of one, and
cleft the skull of the other down to his chin.A very young gentleman named Wilson, the younger son of one who had not
above L200 a year estate, lived in the garb and equipage of the richest
nobleman, for house, furniture, coaches, saddle horses, and kept a
table, and all things accordingly, redeemed his father's estate, and
gave portions to his sisters, being challenged by one Laws, a Scotchman,
was killed in a duel, not fairly.The quarrel arose from his taking away
his own sister from lodging in a house where this Laws had a mistress,
which the mistress of the house thinking a disparagement to it, and
losing by it, instigated Laws to this duel.The mystery is how this so young a gentleman, very sober and
of good fame, could live in such an expensive manner; it could not be
discovered by all possible industry, or entreaty of his friends to make
him reveal it.It did not appear that he was kept by women, play,
coining, padding, or dealing in chemistry; but he would sometimes say
that if he should live ever so long, he had wherewith to maintain
himself in the same manner.He was very civil and well-natured, but of
no great force of understanding.Waller, an extraordinary young
gentleman of great accomplishments, skilled in mathematics, anatomy,
music, painting both in oil and miniature to great perfection, an
excellent botanist, a rare engraver on brass, writer in Latin, and a
poet; and with all this exceedingly modest.His house is an academy of
itself.I carried him to see Brompton Park [by Knightsbridge], where he
was in admiration at the store of rare plants, and the method he found
in that noble nursery, and how well it was cultivated.A public Bank of
L140,000, set up by Act of Parliament among other Acts, and Lotteries
for money to carry on the war.A
great rising of people in Buckinghamshire, on the declaration of a
famous preacher, till now reputed a sober and religious man, that our
Lord Christ appearing to him on the 16th of this month, told him he was
now come down, and would appear publicly at Pentecost, and gather all
the saints, Jews and Gentiles, and lead them to Jerusalem, and begin the
Millennium, and destroying and judging the wicked, deliver the
government of the world to the saints.Great multitudes followed this
preacher, divers of the most zealous brought their goods and
considerable sums of money, and began to live in imitation of the
primitive saints, minding no private concerns, continually dancing and
singing Hallelujah night and day.This brings to mind what I lately
happened to find in Alstedius, that the thousand years should begin this
very year 1694; it is in his "Encyclopaedia Biblica."My copy of the book
printed near sixty years ago.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

4th May, 1694.I went this day with my wife and four servants from Sayes
Court, removing much furniture of all sorts, books, pictures, hangings,
bedding, etc., to furnish the apartment my brother assigned me, and now,
after more than forty years, to spend the rest of my days with him at
Wotton, where I was born; leaving my house at Deptford full furnished,
and three servants, to my son-in-law Draper, to pass the summer in, and
such longer time as he should think fit to make use of it.This being the first Sunday in the month, the blessed
sacrament of the Lord's Supper ought to have been celebrated at Wotton
church, but in this parish it is exceedingly neglected, so that, unless
at the four great feasts, there is no communion hereabouts; which is a
great fault both in ministers and people.I have spoken to my brother,
who is the patron, to discourse the minister about it.Scarcely one
shower has fallen since the beginning of April.This week we had news of my Lord Tiviot having cut his
own throat, through what discontent not yet said.He had been, not many
years past, my colleague in the commission of the Privy Seal, in old
acquaintance, very soberly and religiously inclined.Lord, what are we
without thy continual grace!Lord Falkland, grandson to the learned Lord Falkland, Secretary of State
to King Charles I., and slain in his service, died now of the smallpox.He was a pretty, brisk, understanding, industrious young gentleman; had
formerly been faulty, but now much reclaimed; had also the good luck to
marry a very great fortune, besides being entitled to a vast sum, his
share of the Spanish wreck, taken up at the expense of divers
adventurers.From a Scotch Viscount he was made an English Baron,
designed Ambassador for Holland; had been Treasurer of the Navy, and
advancing extremely in the new Court.All now gone in a moment, and I
think the title is extinct.I know not whether the estate devolves to my
cousin Carew.It was at my Lord Falkland's, whose lady importuned us to
let our daughter be with her some time, so that that dear child took the
same infection, which cost her valuable life.Edwards, minister of Denton, in Sussex, a living in
my brother's gift, came to see him.Wotton, that extraordinary learned
young man, preached excellently.Duncomb, minister of Albury, preached at Wotton, a
very religious and exact discourse.The first great bank for a fund of money being now established by Act of
Parliament, was filled and completed to the sum of L120,000, and put
under the government of the most able and wealthy citizens of London.All who adventured any sum had four per cent., so long as it lay in the
bank, and had power either to take it out at pleasure, or transfer it.Glorious steady weather; corn and all fruits in extraordinary plenty
generally.Lord Berkeley burnt Dieppe and Havre de Grace with
bombs, in revenge for the defeat at Brest.This manner of destructive
war was begun by the French, is exceedingly ruinous, especially falling
on the poorer people, and does not seem to tend to make a more speedy
end of the war; but rather to exasperate and incite to revenge.Many
executed at London for clipping money, now done to that intolerable
extent, that there was hardly any money that was worth above half the
nominal value.I went to visit my cousin, George Evelyn of Nutfield,
where I found a family of ten children, five sons and five
daughters--all beautiful women grown, and extremely well-fashioned.All
painted in one piece, very well, by Mr.Lutterell, in crayon on copper,
and seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature.They are the
children of two extraordinary beautiful wives.Stormy and unseasonable wet weather this week.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th October, 1694.Paul's to see the choir, now finished
as to the stone work, and the scaffold struck both without and within,
in that part.Some exceptions might perhaps be taken as to the placing
columns on pilasters at the east tribunal.As to the rest it is a piece
of architecture without reproach.The pulling out the forms, like
drawers, from under the stalls, is ingenious.I went also to see the
building beginning near St.Giles's, where seven streets make a star
from a Doric pillar placed in the middle of a circular area; said to be
built by Mr.Neale, introducer of the late lotteries, in imitation of
those at Venice, now set up here, for himself twice, and now one for the
State.Visited the Bishop of Lincoln [Tenison] newly come
on the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who a few days before had
a paralytic stroke,--the same day and month that Archbishop Sancroft was
put out.A very sickly time, especially the smallpox, of which divers
considerable persons died.The State lottery[81] drawing, Mr.Cock, a
French refugee, and a President in the Parliament of Paris for the
Reformed, drew a lot of L1,000 per annum.[Footnote 81: State lotteries finally closed October 18, 1826.]I visited the Marquis of Normanby, and had much
discourse concerning King Charles II.Also concerning
the _quinquina_ which the physicians would not give to the King, at a
time when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure
him (out of envy because it had been brought into vogue by Mr.Tudor, an
apothecary), till Dr.Short, to whom the King sent to know his opinion
of it privately, he being reputed a <DW7> (but who was in truth a very
honest, good Christian), sent word to the King that it was the only
thing which could save his life, and then the King enjoined his
physicians to give it to him, which they did and he recovered.Being
asked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr.Lower said it
would spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last
confessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.Exception was taken that
the late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office
for the sick during his illness.I had news that my dear and worthy friend, Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, for which
I thank God and rejoice, he being most worthy of it, for his learning,
piety, and prudence.He being my
proxy, gave my vote for Dr.The smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very
mortal.The Queen died of it on the 28th.The deaths by
smallpox increased to five hundred more than in the preceding week.The
King and Princess Anne reconciled, and she was invited to keep her Court
at Whitehall, having hitherto lived privately at Berkeley House; she was
desired to take into her family divers servants of the late Queen; to
maintain them the King has assigned her L5,000 a quarter.The frost and continual snow have now lasted five
weeks.Lord Spencer married the Duke of Newcastle's daughter,
and our neighbor, Mr.Hussey, married a daughter of my cousin, George
Evelyn, of Nutfield.The long frost intermitted, but not gone.Called to London by Lord Godolphin, one of the
Lords of the Treasury, offering me the treasurership of the hospital
designed to be built at Greenwich for worn-out seamen.The Marquis of Normanby told me King Charles had a
design to buy all King Street, and build it nobly, it being the street
leading to Westminster.This might have been done for the expense of the
Queen's funeral, which was L50,000, against her desire.Never was so universal a
mourning; all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred
poor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded
and covered with black cloth.There were all the nobility, mayor,
aldermen, judges, etc.I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,
who related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,
which was admirable.She never inquired of what opinion persons were,
who were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was
found wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any
extraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die.This
paper was not found in time to be observed.There were other excellent
things under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were
very small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in
any private person.In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for
taking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo
the renowned Queen Elizabeth.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought
at the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was
the very best collection, especially of mathematical books, that was I
believe in Europe, once designed for the King's Library at St.James's;
but the Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that design, it was
let fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.The new edition of Camden's "Britannia" was now published (by Bishop
Gibson), with great additions; those to Surrey were mine, so that I had
one presented to me.of some parts of the New
Testament in vulgar Latin, that had belonged to a monastery in the North
of Scotland, which he esteemed to be about eight hundred years old;
there were some considerable various readings observable, as in John i.,
and genealogy of St.Duncomb, parson of this parish,
preached, which he hardly comes to above once a year though but seven or
eight miles off; a florid discourse, read out of his notes.The Holy
Sacrament followed, which he administered with very little reverence,
leaving out many prayers and exhortations; nor was there any oblation.This ought to be reformed, but my good brother did not well consider
when he gave away this living and the next [Abinger].The latter end of the month sharp and severely cold, with
much snow and hard frost; no appearance of spring.Lucas preached in the afternoon at Wotton.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th April, 1695.Lord Halifax died suddenly at London, the day his
daughter was married to the Earl of Nottingham's son at Burleigh.Lord
H. was a very rich man, very witty, and in his younger days somewhat
positive.After a most severe, cold, and snowy winter, without
almost any shower for many months, the wind continuing N. and E. and not
a leaf appearing; the weather and wind now changed, some showers fell,
and there was a remission of cold.The spring begins to appear, yet the trees hardly
leafed.Sir T. Cooke discovers what prodigious bribes have been given by
some of the East India Company out of the stock, which makes a great
clamor.Daniel went to the bathroom.Never were so many private bills passed for unsettling estates,
showing the wonderful prodigality and decay of families.I came to Deptford from Wotton, in order to the first
meeting of the Commissioners for endowing an hospital for seamen at
Greenwich; it was at the Guildhall, London.Present, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Lord Keeper, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Godolphin, Duke of
Shrewsbury, Duke of Leeds, Earls of Dorset and Monmouth, Commissioners
of the Admiralty and Navy, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Christopher Wren, and
several more.Lowndes, Secretary to the
Lords of the Treasury, Surveyor-General.Second meeting of the Commissioners, and a committee
appointed to go to Greenwich to survey the place, I being one of them.We went to survey Greenwich, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir
Christopher Wren, Mr.Travers, the King's Surveyor, Captain Sanders, and
myself.We made report of the state of Greenwich house, and how
the standing part might be made serviceable at present for L6,000, and
what ground would be requisite for the whole design.My Lord Keeper
ordered me to prepare a book for subscriptions, and a preamble to it.Vanbrugh was made secretary to the
commission, by my nomination of him to the Lords, which was all done
that day.The commissioners met at Guildhall, when there were
scruples and contests of the Lord Mayor, who would not meet, not being
named as one of the quorum, so that a new commission was required,
though the Lord Keeper and the rest thought it too nice a punctilio.Met at Guildhall, but could do nothing for want of a
quorum.At Guildhall; account of subscriptions, about L7,000 or
L8,000.I dined at Lambeth, making my first visit to the
Archbishop, where there was much company, and great cheer.After prayers
in the evening, my Lord made me stay to show me his house, furniture,
and garden, which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual
Archbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought ready furnished
by his predecessor.We discoursed of several public matters,
particularly of the Princess of Denmark, who made so little figure.Met at Guildhall; not a full committee, so nothing
done.No sermon at church; but, after prayers, the names of
all the parishioners were read, in order to gathering the tax of 4s.for
marriages, burials, etc.A very imprudent tax, especially this reading
the names, so that most went out of the church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1695.I dined at Sir Purbeck Temple's, near Croydon; his lady
is aunt to my son-in-law, Draper; the house exactly furnished.Went
thence with my son and daughter to Wotton.Duncomb,
parson of Albury, preached excellently.The weather now so cold, that greater frosts were not
always seen in the midst of winter; this succeeded much wet, and set
harvest extremely back.Offley preached at Abinger; too much
controversy on a point of no consequence, for the country people here.This was the first time I had heard him preach.Bombarding of Cadiz; a
cruel and brutish way of making war, first began by the French.The
season wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest weather.My good and
worthy friend, Captain Gifford, who that he might get some competence to
live decently, adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the
East Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some French
men-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the loss of near L70,000,
to my great sorrow, and pity of his wife, he being also a valiant and
industrious man.The losses of this sort to the nation have been
immense, and all through negligence, and little care to secure the same
near our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the public than
spending their time in bombarding and ruining two or three paltry towns,
without any benefit, or weakening our enemies, who, though they began,
ought not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity, or
Christianity.Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my
son Draper, died suddenly.His lady being
own aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no
heir.There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich
hospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc.appeared,
but I was prevented by indisposition from attending.The weather very
sharp, winter approaching apace.The King went a progress into the
north, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was
everywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he
expected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the
theater, did not receive the banquet proposed.Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some
ancient Platonists' MSS.concerning the Trinity, which this great and
learned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was
encouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to
visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying
sight.He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;
also his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other
pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had
erected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an
inscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most
perfect and pure water.He had newly buried L200 worth of music books
six feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity.He
plays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th November, 1695.Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at
Whitehall.He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,
for matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent
conversation.Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King
being returned from his progress.He stayed seven or eight days at Lord
Sunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained.These
fireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.James's great square, where the King stood.I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest
himself for restoring a room belonging to St.James's library, where the
books want place.Williams continued in Boyle's
lectures another year.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite
and underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being
obnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform
the coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of
half-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather.Great confusion and distraction by reason of the
clipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to
cold.The "Royal Sovereign" man-of-war burned at Chatham.It was built
in 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps
the cause of all the after troubles to this day.An earthquake in
Dorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for
a large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of
that material for the finishing St.There was now a conspiracy of about thirty
knights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English <DW7>s,
and Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the
first opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or
to the chapel; and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to
Calais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army
in readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection
here, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,
King James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered
by some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could
apprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,
were taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,
congratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that,
if King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on
the <DW7>s and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing
up to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown
should be disposed of according to the late settlement at the
Revolution.All <DW7>s, in the meantime, to be banished ten miles from
London.This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general
animosity against the French King and King James.The militia of the
nation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and
all things put in a posture to encounter a descent.This was so timed by
the enemy, that while we were already much discontented by the greatness
of the taxes, and corruption of the money, etc., we had like to have had
very few men-of-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral
Rooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,
with others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,
and were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could
be got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look
on it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of
God.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design
of assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his
friends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King
William.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so
many of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding
their design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and
Dunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they
were so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their
masts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to
have invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,
whereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate
the King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of
inciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and
some very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John
Friend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at
Temple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was
such at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles
II., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]

    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into
    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who
absolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.One of them (Snatt)
was a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to
the canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee
about settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years
a more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the
King's House at Kensington.The
gallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of
Titian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,
Tintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty
private library.His prayer before
the sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with
fifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous
train of gallants.Oates
dedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he
presumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,
speaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own
father.I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,
the Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr.Serjeant Rotheram, to consult
about settling Mr.Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity; which we concluded
upon, by buying a rent charge of L50 per annum, with the stock in our
hands.I went to Lambeth, to meet at dinner the Countess of
Sunderland and divers ladies.We dined in the Archbishop's wife's
apartment with his Grace, and stayed late; yet I returned to Deptford at
night.I went to London to meet my son, newly come from
Ireland, indisposed.Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that
none was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying
for common necessities.The Association with an oath required of all
lawyers and officers, on pain of _praemunire_, whereby men were obliged
to renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King
William's death, if happening by assassination.This to be taken by all
the Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's
Bench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the
oath.This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the
Parliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and
others surrender.Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,
were now discharged out of prison.We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to
workmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

1st June, 1696.I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to
letting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition
to keep up the garden.A committee met at Whitehall about Greenwich Hospital,
at Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's Surveyor-General.We made the
first agreement with divers workmen and for materials; and gave the
first order for proceeding on the foundation, and for weekly payments to
the workmen, and a general account to be monthly.Dined at Lord Pembroke's, Lord Privy Seal, a very
worthy gentleman.He showed me divers rare pictures of very many of the
old and best masters, especially one of M. Angelo of a man gathering
fruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the best drawings of the
old masters.Sir John Fenwick, one of the conspirators, was taken.Great
subscriptions in Scotland to their East India Company.Want of current
money to carry on the smallest concerns, even for daily provisions in
the markets.Guineas lowered to twenty-two shillings, and great sums
daily transported to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure
sent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined of the new and
now only current stamp, cause such a scarcity that tumults are every day
feared, nobody paying or receiving money; so imprudent was the late
Parliament to condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they
had provided supplies.To this add the fraud of the bankers and
goldsmiths, who having gotten immense riches by extortion, keep up their
treasure in expectation of enhancing its value.Duncombe, not long since
a mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late Duke of
Buckingham's estate at nearly L90,000, and reputed to have nearly as
much in cash.Banks and lotteries every day set up.The famous trial between my Lord Bath and Lord Montague
for an estate of L11,000 a year, left by the Duke of Albemarle, wherein
on several trials had been spent,L20,000 between them.The Earl of Bath
was cast on evident forgery.I made my Lord Cheney a visit at Chelsea, and saw those
ingenious waterworks invented by Mr.Winstanley, wherein were some
things very surprising and extraordinary.An exceedingly rainy, cold, unseasonable summer, yet
the city was very healthy.A trial in the Common Pleas between the Lady Purbeck
Temple and Mr.Temple, a nephew of Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up
to take place of several wills.The
cause went on my lady's side.This concerning my son-in-law, Draper, I
stayed almost all day at Court.A great supper was given to the jury,
being persons of the best condition in Buckinghamshire.I went with a select committee of the Commissioners for
Greenwich Hospital, and with Sir Christopher Wren, where with him I laid
the first stone of the intended foundation, precisely at five o'clock in
the evening, after we had dined together.Flamstead, the King's
Astronomical Professor, observing the punctual time by instruments.Note that my Lord Godolphin was the first of the
subscribers who paid any money to this noble fabric.A northern wind altering the weather with a continual
and impetuous rain of three days and nights changed it into perfect
winter.So little money in the nation that Exchequer Tallies,
of which I had for L2,000 on the best fund in England, the Post Office,
nobody would take at 30 per cent discount.The Bank lending the L200,000 to pay the array in
Flanders, that had done nothing against the enemy, had so exhausted the
treasure of the nation, that one could not have borrowed money under 14
or 15 per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per cent.I went to Lambeth and dined with the
Archbishop, who had been at Court on the complaint against Dr.David's, who was suspended for simony.The
Archbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the Canon law, and how
exceedingly unreasonable all their pleadings appeared to him.Fine seasonable weather, and a great harvest after a
cold, wet summer.I went to congratulate the marriage of a daughter
of Mr.Boscawen to the son of Sir Philip Meadows; she is niece to my
Lord Godolphin, married at Lambeth by the Archbishop, 30th of August.After above six months' stay in London about Greenwich Hospital, I
returned to Wotton.Unseasonable stormy weather, and an ill seedtime.Lord Godolphin retired from the Treasury, who was the
first Commissioner and most skillful manager of all.The first frost began fiercely, but lasted not long.15th-23d November, 1696.Very stormy weather, rain, and inundations.The severe frost and weather relented, but again
froze with snow.Sir John
Fenwick was beheaded.Soldiers in the
armies and garrison towns frozen to death on their posts.I came to Wotton after three months' absence.Very bright weather, but with sharp east wind.My son
came from London in his melancholy indisposition.Duncombe, the rector, came and preached after
an absence of two years, though only living seven or eight miles off [at
Ashted].So great were the storms all this week, that near a
thousand people were lost going into the Texel.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th November, 1697.The King's entry very pompous; but is nothing
approaching that of King Charles II.Thanksgiving Day for the Peace, the King and a great
Court at Whitehall.The Bishop of Salisbury preached, or rather made a
florid panegyric, on 2 Chron.The evening concluded with
fireworks and illuminations of great expense.Paul's had had service
performed in it since it was burned in 1666.I went to Kensington with the Sheriff, Knights, and
chief gentlemen of Surrey, to present their address to the King.The
Duke of Norfolk promised to introduce it, but came so late, that it was
presented before be came.This insignificant ceremony was brought in in
Cromwell's time, and has ever since continued with offers of life and
fortune to whoever happened to have the power.I dined at Sir Richard
Onslow's, who treated almost all the gentlemen of Surrey.When we had
half dined, the Duke of Norfolk came in to make his excuse.At the Temple Church; it was very long before the
service began, staying for the Comptroller of the Inner Temple, where
was to be kept a riotous and reveling Christmas, according to custom.Bentley, about the Library at
St.A great Christmas kept at Wotton, open house, much company.I
presented my book of Medals, etc., to divers noblemen, before I exposed
it to sale.Fulham, who lately married my niece, preached
against atheism, a very eloquent discourse, somewhat improper for most
of the audience at [Wotton], but fitted for some other place, and very
apposite to the profane temper of the age.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th January, 1698.Whitehall burned, nothing but walls and ruins left.The imprisonment of the great banker, Duncombe:
censured by Parliament; acquitted by the Lords; sent again to the Tower
by the Commons.The Czar of Muscovy being come to England, and having a mind to see the
building of ships, hired my house at Sayes Court, and made it his court
and palace, newly furnished for him by the King.[84]

    [Footnote 84: While the Czar was in his house.Evelyn's servant
    writes to him: "There is a house full of people, and right nasty.The Czar lies next your library, and dines in the parlor next your
    study.He dines at ten o'clock and at six at night; is very seldom
    at home a whole day; very often in the King's yard, or by water,
    dressed in several dresses.The King is expected here this day; the
    best parlor is pretty clean for him to be entertained in.The King
    pays for all he has."]The Czar went from my house to return home.An
exceedingly sharp and cold season.An extraordinary great snow and frost, nipping the corn
and other fruits.Corn at nine shillings a bushel [L18 a load].Pepys's, where I heard the rare voice of
Mr.Pule, who was lately come from Italy, reputed the most excellent
singer we had ever had.White, late Bishop of Norwich, who had been ejected
for not complying with Government, was buried in St.Gregory's
churchyard, or vault, at St.His hearse was accompanied by two
non-juror bishops, Dr.Lloyd, with forty other
non-juror clergymen, who would not stay the Office of the burial,
because the Dean of St.Paul's had appointed a conforming minister to
read the Office; at which all much wondered, there being nothing in that
Office which mentioned the present King.Godolphin
with the Earl of Marlborough's daughter.To Deptford, to see how miserably the Czar had left my
house, after three months making it his Court.I got Sir Christopher
Wren, the King's surveyor, and Mr.London, his gardener, to go and
estimate the repairs, for which they allowed L150 in their report to the
Lords of the Treasury.I then went to see the foundation of the Hall and
Chapel at Greenwich Hospital.I dined with Pepys, where was Captain Dampier,[85] who
had been a famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job,
and printed a relation of his very strange adventure, and his
observations.He was now going abroad again by the King's encouragement,
who furnished a ship of 290 tons.He seemed a more modest man than one
would imagine by the relation of the crew he had assorted with.He
brought a map of his observations of the course of the winds in the
South Sea, and assured us that the maps hitherto extant were all false
as to the Pacific Sea, which he makes on the south of the line, that on
the north end running by the coast of Peru being extremely tempestuous.[Footnote 85: The celebrated navigator, born in 1652, the time of
    whose death is uncertain.His "Voyage Round the World" has gone
    through many editions, and the substance of it has been transferred
    to many collections of voyages.]Foy came to me to use my interest with Lord
Sunderland for his being made Professor of Physic at Oxford, in the
King's gift.I went also to the Archbishop in his behalf.Being one of the Council of the Royal Society, I was
named to be of the committee to wait on our new President, the Lord
Chancellor, our Secretary, Dr.Sloane, and Sir R. Southwell, last
Vice-President, carrying our book of statutes; the office of the
President being read, his Lordship subscribed his name, and took the
oaths according to our statutes as a Corporation for the improvement of
natural knowledge.Then his Lordship made a short compliment concerning
the honor the Society had done him, and how ready he would be to promote
so noble a design, and come himself among us, as often as the attendance
on the public would permit; and so we took our leave.She was daughter to Sir
John Evelyn, of Wilts, my father's nephew; she was widow to William
Pierrepoint, brother to the Marquis of Dorchester, and mother to Evelyn
Pierrepoint, Earl of Kingston; a most excellent and prudent lady.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The House of Commons persist in refusing more than 7,000 men to be a
standing army, and no strangers to be in the number.Our county member, Sir R. Onslow, opposed it also; which
might reconcile him to the people, who began to suspect him.Mander, the
Master of Baliol College, where he was entered a fellow-commoner.A most furious wind, such as has not happened for
many years, doing great damage to houses and trees, by the fall of which
several persons were killed.The old East India Company lost their business against
the new Company, by ten votes in Parliament, so many of their friends
being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.The persecuted Vaudois, who were banished out of Savoy, were received by
the German Protestant Princes.My only remaining son died after a tedious languishing
sickness, contracted in Ireland, and increased here, to my exceeding
grief and affliction; leaving me one grandson, now at Oxford, whom I
pray God to prosper and be the support of the Wotton family.He was aged
forty-four years and about three months.He had been six years one of
the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland, with great ability and
reputation.After an extraordinary storm, there came up the Thames
a whale which was fifty-six feet long.Such, and a larger of the spout
kind, was killed there forty years ago (June 1658).My deceased son was buried in the vault at Wotton,
according to his desire.The Duke of Devon lost L1,900 at a horse race at Newmarket.The King preferring his young favorite Earl of Albemarle to be first
Commander of his Guard, the Duke of Ormond laid down his commission.This of the Dutch Lord passing over his head, was exceedingly resented
by everybody.Lord Spencer purchased an incomparable library[86] of...
wherein, among other rare books, were several that were printed at the
first invention of that wonderful art, as particularly "Tully's Offices,
etc."There was a Homer and a Suidas in a very good Greek character and
good paper, almost as ancient.This gentleman is a very fine scholar,
whom from a child I have known.[Footnote 86: The foundation of the noble library now at Blenheim.]I dined with the Archbishop; but my business was to
get him to persuade the King to purchase the late Bishop of Worcester's
library, and build a place for his own library at St.James's, in the
Park, the present one being too small.At a meeting of the Royal Society I was nominated to be of
the committee to wait on the Lord Chancellor to move the King to
purchase the Bishop of Worcester's library (Dr.The Court party have little influence in this Session.The Duke of Ormond restored to his commission.All
Lotteries, till now cheating the people, to be no longer permitted than
to Christmas, except that for the benefit of Greenwich Hospital.Bridgman, chairman of the committee for that charitable work, died; a
great loss to it.He was Clerk of the Council, a very industrious,
useful man.John Moore,[87] Bishop of Norwich,
one of the best and most ample collection of all sorts of good books in
England, and he, one of the most learned men.[Footnote 87: Afterward Bishop of Ely.He died 31st of July, 1714.King George I. purchased this library after the Bishop's death, for
    L6,000, and presented it to the University of Cambridge, where it
    now is.]After a long drought, we had a refreshing shower.The
day before, there was a dreadful fire at Rotherhithe, near the Thames
side, which burned divers ships, and consumed nearly three hundred
houses.Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin; she had been the richest
lady in Europe.She was niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and was married to
the richest subject in Europe, as is said.She was born at Rome,
educated in France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit but
dissolute and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to be abandoned
by her husband, and banished, when she came into England for shelter,
lived on a pension given her here, and is reported to have hastened her
death by intemperate drinking strong spirits.She has written her own
story and adventures, and so has her other extravagant sister, wife to
the noble family of Colonna.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th June, 1699.This week died Conyers Seymour, son of Sir Edward
Seymour, killed in a duel caused by a slight affront in St.James's
Park, given him by one who was envious of his gallantries; for he was a
vain, foppish young man, who made a great _eclat_ about town by his
splendid equipage and boundless expense.He was about twenty-three years
old; his brother, now at Oxford, inherited an estate of L7,000 a year,
which had fallen to him not two years before.My cousin, George Evelyn, of Nutfield, died suddenly.The heat has been so great, almost all this month, that
I do not remember to have felt much greater in Italy, and this after a
winter the wettest, though not the coldest, that I remember for fifty
years last past.Finding my occasions called me so often to London, I
took the remainder of the lease my son had in a house in Dover Street,
to which I now removed, not taking my goods from Wotton.Seasonable showers, after a continuance of excessive
drought and heat.At Deptford, they had
been building a pretty new church.David's [Watson]
deprived for simony.[88] The city of Moscow burnt by the throwing of
squibs.[Footnote 88: _Ante_, p.There was in this week an eclipse of the sun, at
which many were frightened by the predictions of the astrologers.I
remember fifty years ago that many were so terrified by Lilly, that they
dared not go out of their houses.A strange earthquake at New Batavia,
in the East Indies.My worthy brother died at Wotton, in the 83d year of
his age, of perfect memory and understanding.He was religious, sober,
and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house
the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free
entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was
never free.There were sometimes twenty persons more than his family,
and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by
this he gained the universal love of the county.He was born at Wotton,
went from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford,
thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but
without intention to study the law as a profession.He married the
daughter of Colwall, of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire,
by whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George her son an
infant, who being educated liberally, after traveling abroad, returned
and married one Mrs.Gore, by whom he had several children, but only
three daughters survived.He was a young man of good understanding, but,
over-indulging his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary
to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.My brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady, relict of Sir
John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy and ancient Staffordshire
family, by whom he had several children of both sexes.This lady died,
leaving only two daughters and a son.The younger daughter died before
marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and
learned gentleman (son of Sir ---- Wych), who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland.Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of
---- Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable family, but left a widow
without any child living; he died about 1691, and his wife not many
years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me.His
sister, Wych, had a portion of L6,000, to which was added L300 more; the
three other daughters, with what I added, had about L5,000 each.My
brother died on the 5th of October, in a good old age and great
reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, etc.She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than
as a private gentleman.There were, as I computed, above 2,000 persons
at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last
honors.I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and
family.After an unusual warm and pleasant season, we were
surprised with a very sharp frost.I presented my "_Acetaria_,"
dedicated to my Lord Chancellor, who returned me thanks in an
extraordinarily civil letter.There happened this week so thick a mist and fog,
that people lost their way in the streets, it being so intense that no
light of candles, or torches, yielded any (or but very little)
direction.Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and Kensington on both
sides, and while coaches and travelers were passing.It began about four
in the afternoon, and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it.At the Thames, they beat drums to direct the watermen to
make the shore.At our chapel in the evening there was a sermon
preached by young Mr.Horneck, chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's
funeral had been celebrated magnificently the Thursday before.A
panegyric was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary piety and
excellently employed life of this amiable young lady.She died in
childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who
ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his
life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the
mode of this dissolute age.Her devotion, early piety, charity,
fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying,
recollections in her own handwriting of what she heard and read, and her
conversation were most exemplary.Blackwell's election to be the next
year's Boyles Lecturer.Such horrible robberies and murders were committed, as had not been
known in this nation; atheism, profaneness, blasphemy, among all sorts,
portended some judgment if not amended; on which a society was set on
foot, who obliged themselves to endeavor the reforming of it, in London
and other places, and began to punish offenders and put the laws in more
strict execution; which God Almighty prosper!A gentle, calm, dry,
temperate weather all this season of the year, but now came sharp, hard
frost, and mist, but calm.Calm, bright, and warm as in the middle of April.So
continued on 21st of January.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of the Irish
forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart for discharging the
vast national debt.They called some great persons in the highest
offices in question for setting the Great Seal to the pardon of an
arch-pirate,[89] who had turned pirate again, and brought prizes into
the West Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey; but
the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers, out-voted the
complaints, not by being more in number, but by the country party being
negligent in attendance.[Footnote 89: Captain Kidd; he was hanged about two years afterward
    with some of his accomplices.This was one of the charges brought by
    the Commons against Lord Somers.]14th January, 1699-1700.Stringfellow, who had been made the first preacher at our chapel by
the Bishop of Lincoln [Dr.Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St.Martin's by dispensation, and put in one Mr.Sandys, much against the
inclination of those who frequented the chapel.The Scotch book about
Darien was burned by the hangman by vote of Parliament.[90]

    [Footnote 90: The volume alluded to was "An Enquiry into the Causes
    of the Miscarriage of the Scots Colony at Darien: Or an Answer to a
    Libel," entitled "A Defense of the Scots abdicating Darien."See
    Votes of the House of Commons, 15th January, 1699-1700.]Died the Duke of Beaufort, a person of great honor,
prudence, and estate.I went to Wotton, the first time after my brother's
funeral, to furnish the house with necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew
Glanville, the executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's.The weather was now altering into sharp and hard
frost.[Sidenote: LONDON]

One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons on King Charles's
Martyrdom, told them that the observation of that day was not intended
out of any detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other Kings
and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves toward their subjects,
lest they should come to the same end.This was so resented that, though
it was usual to desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one should preach
before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.The Parliament voted against the Scots settling in
Darien as being prejudicial to our trade with Spain.They also voted
that the exorbitant number of attorneys be lessened (now indeed
swarming, and evidently causing lawsuits and disturbance, eating out the
estates of the people, provoking them to go to law).Mild and calm season, with gentle frost, and little
mizzling rain.Martin's frequently preached at Trinity
chapel in the afternoon.The season was like April for warmth and
mildness.--11th.On Wednesday, was a sermon at our chapel, to be
continued during Lent.I was at the funeral of my Lady Temple, who was buried
at Islington, brought from Addiscombe, near Croydon.She left my
son-in-law Draper (her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very
nobly and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with plate and
jewels, to the value in all of about L20,000.She was a very prudent
lady, gave many great legacies, with L500 to the poor of Islington,
where her husband, Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without
issue.The season warm, gentle, and exceedingly pleasant.Divers persons of quality entered into the Society for Reformation[91]
of Manners; and some lectures were set up, particularly in the city of
London.The most eminent of the clergy preached at Bow Church, after
reading a declaration set forth by the King to suppress the growing
wickedness; this began already to take some effect as to common
swearing, and oaths in the mouths of people of all ranks.[Footnote 91: _Ante_, p.Burnet preached to-day before the Lord Mayor and a
very great congregation, on Proverbs xxvii.5, 6, "Open rebuke is better
than secret love; the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of
an enemy."He made a very pathetic discourse concerning the necessity
and advantage of friendly correction.The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in obtaining a divorce
from his wife by the Parliament for adultery with Sir John Germaine, a
Dutch gamester, of mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the Duke
had leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the
Dukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, <DW7>s indeed,
but very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father.The now
Duke their uncle is a Protestant.The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as
commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment
of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great
measure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably.That this might be done without
suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member
of either House should be in the commission.The great contest between
the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and
rejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King
Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.This was
carried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the
Court, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph
of the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and
those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland.Pity it is,
that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this
nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side
heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too
far.Among the rest, there passed a law as to <DW7>s' estates, that if
one turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass
to his next Protestant heir.This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only
the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the
indiscreet insolence of the <DW7>s here, going in triumphant and public
processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers
places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their
party.This week there was a great change of State officers.The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of
Jersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat.Vernon,
Secretary of State, was put out.The Seal was taken from the Lord
Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of
votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons.This
being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in
this fluctuating conjuncture.It is certain that this Chancellor was a
most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior
pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in
place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their
jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which
protected the people from tyranny.A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,
and a propitious year.The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on
which depended an estate of L1,500 a year; the verdict was given for Sir
Walter, 19th.Serjeant Wright at last accepted the Great Seal.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

24th May, 1700.I went from Dover street to Wotton, for the rest of the
summer, and removed thither the rest of my goods from Sayes Court.A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing showers.In the afternoon, our clergyman had a catechism,
which was continued for some time.I was visited with illness, but it pleased God that I
recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him by me, and that he has
again so graciously advertised me of my duty to prepare for my latter
end, which at my great age, cannot be far off.The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, died of the
smallpox.I went to Harden, which was originally a barren warren
bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who built there a pretty house, and made
such alteration by planting not only an infinite store of the best
fruit; but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and
solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign
country, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,
holly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so
that I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren
condition, was in admiration of it.The land was bought of Sir John
Evelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement
by the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen.He and his lady
received us with great civility.The tombs in the church at Croydon of
Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and
venerable; but none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance and
carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge could not cost less than
L700 or L800.I went to Beddington, the ancient seat of the
Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure, capacious, and in form
of the buildings of the age of Henry VIII.and Queen Elizabeth, and
proper for the old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the first orange
trees[92] that had been seen in England, planted in the open ground, and
secured in winter only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees, and laden with
fruit, were now in decay, as well as the grotto, fountains, cabinets,
and other curiosities in the house and abroad, it being now fallen to a
child under age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation.The estate and park about it also in decay.[Footnote 92: Oranges were eaten in this kingdom much earlier than
    the time of King James I.]Pepys at Clapham, where he has
a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with
Indian and Chinese curiosities.The offices and gardens well
accommodated for pleasure and retirement.My birthday now completed the 80th year of my age.I
with my soul render thanks to God, who, of his infinite mercy, not only
brought me out of many troubles, but this year restored me to health,
after an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my sight,
hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable, which I implore him
to continue, with the pardon of my sins past, and grace to acknowledge
by my improvement of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his
pleasure to protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for my
last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed Savior, the Lord
Jesus, Amen!Came the news of my dear grandson (the only male of
my family now remaining) being fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford,
which after the dire effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted
me; but so it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at his
first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr.Mander (Head of
the college and now Vice Chancellor), who caused him to be brought and
lodged in his own bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his recovery, to our
infinite comfort.We had a letter every day either from the Vice
Chancellor himself, or his tutor.Assurance of his recovery by a letter from himself.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was a change of great officers at Court.Lord Godolphin returned
to his former station of first Commissioner of the Treasury; Sir Charles
Hedges, Secretary of State.At the Royal Society, Lord Somers, the late
Chancellor, was continued President.Great alterations of officers at Court, and
elsewhere,--Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he was a learned man in his
profession, of which we have now few, never fewer; the Chancery
requiring so little skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can
talk eloquently in that Court; so that probably few care to study the
law to any purpose.Lord Marlborough Master of the Ordnance, in place of
Lord Romney made Groom of the Stole.The Earl of Rochester goes Lord
Lieutenant to Ireland.I finished the sale of North Stoake in Sussex to
Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother to be sold for payment of
portions to my nieces, and other incumbrances on the estate.An exceeding deep snow, and melted away as suddenly.Severe frost, and such a tempest as threw down many
chimneys, and did great spoil at sea, and blew down above twenty trees
of mine at Wotton.Harley, an able
gentleman, chosen.Our countryman, Sir Richard Onslow, had a party for
him.By an order of the House of Commons, I laid before
the Speaker the state of what had been received and paid toward the
building of Greenwich Hospital.Wye, Rector of Wotton, died, a very worthy good man.Bohun, a learned person and excellent preacher, who had been my
son's tutor, and lived long in my family.I let Sayes Court to Lord Carmarthen, son to the Duke
of Leeds.I went to the funeral of my sister Draper, who was
buried at Edmonton in great state.Davenant displeased the clergy
now met in Convocation by a passage in his book, p.A Dutch boy of about eight or nine years old was carried
about by his parents to show, who had about the iris of one eye the
letters of _Deus meus_, and of the other _Elohim_, in the Hebrew
character.How this was done by artifice none could imagine; his parents
affirming that he was so born.It did not prejudice his sight, and he
seemed to be a lively playing boy.Everybody went to see him; physicians
and philosophers examined it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.The Duke of Norfolk died of an apoplexy, and Mr.Thomas
Howard of complicated disease since his being cut for the stone; he was
one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.Some Kentish men, delivering a petition to the House of
Commons, were imprisoned.[93]

    [Footnote 93: Justinian Champneys, Thomas Culpepper, William
    Culpepper, William Hamilton, and David Polhill, gentlemen of
    considerable property and family in the county.There is a very good
    print of them in five ovals on one plate, engraved by R. White, in
    1701.They desired the Parliament to mind the public more, and their
    private heats less.They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited.A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of
calling the assembly and dissolving.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th June, 1701.The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness.He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary L500 per annum.My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer.There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs.Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.Wise, who was there to receive
me.The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth L10,000 to the lawyers.His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear.He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire.It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices.He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week.Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor.I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr.Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02.At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr.Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters.Our relation and friendship had been long and
great.He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after.This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea.He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune.He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to L1,900.The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction.Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed L10 per annum
toward the carrying it on.We agreed that every missioner, besides the
L20 to set him forth, should have L50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him L100 per annum.We
sent a young divine to New York.I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr.Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty.Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party.The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me.I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age.I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul.My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox.He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St.Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire L5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above L30,000 a year in places and employments, with L50,000 at
interest.He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater.He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future.[Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo.fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the
House.Oglethorpe was disarmed.The Bill against occasional
conformity was lost by one vote.Corn and provisions so cheap that the
farmers are unable to pay their rents.[Sidenote: LONDON]

February, 1703.A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr.Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate.The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox.A great
earthquake at Rome, etc.A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her L500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices.She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above L1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity.went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr.Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity.He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation.His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially.Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir.Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr.Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished.I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer.From August 1696, there had been
expended in building L89,364 14s.This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics.55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state.I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703.The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal.As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age.I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment.After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.[Footnote 95: Charles III., afterward Emperor of Germany, by the
    title of Charles VI.]The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a year.The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world.He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning.This is a serious
alarm to me.He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb.He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr.Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.[Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.][Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1704.This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc.The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned.Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner.The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels.Music and
trumpets at every city company.The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St.After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St.The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night.Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.[Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr.Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature.He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain.I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.Agues and smallpox much in
every place.Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant.A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton.The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age.She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members.I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr.I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr.King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations.He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St.John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705.Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless L2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice.His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got L100,000 and made
themselves Barons.Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in.An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen.There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom.Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

now, surely![_Nodding her head._] Um--um!Why, he took a man up last night!Why, I thought that when hany harrest was made in St.Marvells, the
prisoner was lodged here honly for the night and that the 'ead
Constable 'ad to drive 'im over to Durnstone Police Station the first
thing in the morning.That's the rule, but Noah's behindhand to-day, and ain't going into
Durnstone till after dinner.And where is the hapartment in question?The "Strong-box" they call it in St.[_Whimpering to himself._] And 'im
accustomed to his shavin' water at h'eight and my kindly hand to
button his gaiters.'Annah, 'Annah, my dear, it's this very prisoner what I 'ave called on
you respectin'.Oh, then the honor ain't a compliment to me, after all, Mr.I'm killing two birds with one stone, my dear.[_Throwing the cards into BLORE'S hat._] You can take them back to the
Deanery with Mrs.[_Shaking the cards out of his hat and replacing them in his
pocket-book._] I will leave them hon you again to-morrow, 'Annah.But,
'Annah deary, do you know that this hunfortunate man was took in our
stables last night.No, I never ask Noah nothing about Queen's business.He don't want
_two_ women over him!Then you 'aven't seen the miserable culprit?I was in bed hours when Noah brought 'im 'ome.They tell us it's only a wretched poacher or a
petty larcery we'll get in St.My poor Noah ain't never
likely to have the chance of a horrid murder in a place what returns a
Conservative.[_Kneeling to look into the oven._

BLORE.But, 'Annah, suppose this case you've got 'old of now is a case
what'll shake old England to its basis!Suppose it means columns in
the paper with Topping's name a-figurin'!Suppose as family readin',
it 'old its own with divorce cases!You know something about this arrest, you do!I merely wish to encourage
you, 'Annah; to implant an 'ope that crime may brighten your wedded
life.[_Sitting at the table and referring to an official book._] The man
was found trespassing in the Deanery Stables with intent--refuses to
give his name or any account of 'isself.[_To himself._] If I could honly find hout whether Dandy Dick had any
of the medicine it would so guide me at the Races.It
doesn't appear that the 'orse in the stables--took it, does it?[_Looking up sharply._] Took what?You're sure there's no confession of any sort, 'Annah
dear?[_As he is bending over HANNAH, NOAH TOPPING appears.NOAH is a
dense-looking ugly countryman, with red hair, a bristling heard, and a
vindictive leer.He is dressed in ill-fitting clothes, as a rural
Police Constable._

NOAH.[_Fiercely._] 'Annah![_Starting and replacing the book._] Oh don't!Blore from
the Deanery come to see us--an old friend o' mine![_BLORE advances to NOAH with a nervous smile, extending his hand._

NOAH.[_Taking BLORE'S hand and holding it firmly._] A friend of hern is a
friend o' mian!She's gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends this week, since we coom to
St.Of course, dear 'Annah was a lovin' favorite with heverybody.Well then, as her friends be mian, I'm takin' the liberty, one by
one, of gradually droppin' on 'em all.[_Getting his hand away._] Dear me!And if I catch any old fly a buzzin' round my lady I'll venture to
break his 'ead in wi' my staff![_Preparing to depart._] I--I merely called to know if hanything had
been found hout about the ruffian took in our stables last night!He's the De-an, ain't he?[_Fiercely._] Shut oop, darlin'.Topping's
respects to the Dean, and say I'll run up to the Deanery and see him
after I've took my man over to Durnstone.Thank you--I 'ope the Dean will be at 'ome.[_Offering his hand, into which NOAH significantly places his
truncheon.BLORE goes out quickly._

HANNAH.[_Whimpering._] Oh, Noah, Noah, I don't believe as we shall ever get a
large circle of friends round us![_Selecting a pair of handcuffs and examining them
critically._] Them'll do.[_Slipping them into his pocket, and turning
upon HANNAH suddenly._] 'Annah!Yes, Noahry----

NOAH.Brighten oop, my darlin', the little time you 'ave me at 'ome with
you.[_She bustles about and begins to lay the cloth._

NOAH.I'm just a' goin' round to the stable to put old Nick in the cart.Oh, dont'ee trust to Nick, Noah dear--he's such a vicious brute.Nick can take me on to the edge o' the hill in half
the time.Ah, what d'ye think I've put off taking my man to Durnstone to now
for?Why, I'm a goin' to get a glimpse of the racin', on my way over.[_Opening the wicket in the cell door and looking in._] There he is![_To HANNAH._] Hopen the hoven door, 'Annah, and let the smell
of the cookin' get into him.Oh, no, Noah--it's torture![_She opens the oven door._] Torture!Whenever I get a 'old of a darned obstinate
creature wot won't reveal his hindentity I hopens the hoven door.[_He goes out into the street, and as he departs, the woful face of
THE DEAN appears at the wicket, his head being still enveloped in the
fur cap._

HANNAH.[_Shutting the oven door._] Not me!Torturing prisoners might a' done
for them Middling Ages what Noah's always clattering about, but not
for my time o' life.[_Crossing close to the
wicket, her face almost comes against THE DEAN'S.She gives a cry._]
The Dean![_He disappears._

HANNAH.[_Tottering to the wicket
and looking in._] Master!It's 'Annah, your poor faithful
servant, 'Annah![_The face of THE DEAN re-appears._

THE DEAN.[_In a deep sad voice._] Hannah Evans.It's 'Annah Topping, Knee Evans, wife o' the Constable what's goin' to
take you to cruel Durnstone.[_Sinking weeping upon the ground at the
door._] Oh, Mr.Dean, sir, what have you been up to?Woman, I am the victim of a misfortune only partially merited.[_On her knees, clasping her hands._] Tell me what you've done, Master
dear; give it a name, for the love of goodness

THE DEAN.My poor Hannah, I fear I have placed myself in an equivocal position.[_With a shriek of despair._] Ah!Is it a change o' cooking that's brought you to such ways?I cooked
for you for seven 'appy years!you seem to have lost none of your culinary skill.[_With clenched hands and a determined look._] Oh![_Quickly locking
and bolting the street door._] Noah can't put that brute of a horse to
under ten minutes.The dupplikit key o' the Strong Box![_Producing a
large key, with which she unlocks the cell door._] Master, you'll give
me your patrol not to cut, won't you?Under any other circumstances, Hannah, I should resent that
insinuation.[_Pulling the door which opens sufficiently to let out THE DEAN._

THE DEAN.[_As he enters the room._] Good day, Hannah; you have bettered
yourself, I hope?[_Hysterically flinging herself upon THE DEAN._] Oh, Master, Master![_Putting her from him sternly._] Hannah!Oh, I know, I know, but crime levels all, dear sir!You appear to misapprehend the precise degree of criminality which
attaches to me, Mrs.In the eyes of that majestic, but
imperfect instrument, the law, I am an innocent if not an injured man.Stick to it, if you think it's likely to serve
your wicked ends![_Placing bread with other things on the table._

THE DEAN.My good woman, a single word from me to those at the Deanery, would
instantly restore me to home, family, and accustomed diet.Ah, they all tell that tale what comes here.Why don't you send word,
Dean dear?Because it would involve revelations of my temporary moral aberration![_Putting her apron to her eyes with a howl._] Owh!Because I should return to the Deanery with my dignity--that priceless
possession of man's middle age!--with my dignity seriously impaired!Oh, don't, sir, don't!How could I face my simple children who have hitherto, not
unreasonably, regarded me as faultless?How could I again walk erect
in the streets of St.Marvells with my name blazoned on the Records of
a Police Station of the very humblest description?[_Sinking into a chair and snatching up a piece of breads which he
begins munching._

HANNAH.[_Wiping her eyes._] Oh, sir, it's a treat to hear you, compared with
the hordinary criminal class.But, master, dear, though my Noah don't
recognize you--through his being a stranger to St.Marvells--how'll
you fare when you get to Durnstone?I have one great buoyant hope--that a word in the ear of the Durnstone
Superintendent will send me forth an unquestioned man.You and he will
be the sole keepers of my precious secret.May its possession be a
lasting comfort to you both.Master, is what you've told me your only chance of getting off
unknown?It is the sole remaining chance of averting a calamity of almost
national importance.Then you're as done as that joint in my oven!The Superintendent at Durnstone--John Ruggles--also the two
Inspectors, Whitaker and Parker----

THE DEAN.Them and their wives and families are chapel folk![_THE DEAN totters across to a chair, into which he sinks with
his head upon the table._] Master!I was well fed and kept seven years at the
Deanery--I've been wed to Noah Topping eight weeks--that's six years
and ten months' lovin' duty doo to you and yours before I owe nothing
to my darling Noah.Master dear, you shan't be took to Durnstone!Hannah Topping, formerly Evans, it is my duty to inform you
that your reasoning does more credit to your heart than to your head.The Devil's always in a woman's heart because it's
the warmest place to get to![_Taking a small key from the table
drawer._] Here, take that![_Pushing the key into the pocket of his
coat._] When you once get free from my darling Noah that key unlocks
your handcuffs!How are you to get free, that's the question now, isn't it?My Noah drives you over to Durnstone with old Nick in the cart.Now Nick was formerly in the Durnstone Fire Brigade,
and when he 'ears the familiar signal of a double whistle you can't
hold him in.[_Putting it into THE DEAN'S
pocket._] Directly you turn into Pear Tree Lane, blow once and you'll
see Noah with his nose in the air, pullin' fit to wrench his 'ands
off.Jump out--roll clear of the wheel--keep cool and 'opeful and blow
again.Before you can get the mud out of your eyes Noah and the horse
and cart will be well into Durnstone, and may Providence restore a
young 'usband safe to his doatin' wife![_Recoiling horror-stricken._

HANNAH.[_Crying._] Oh--ooh--ooh!Is this the fruit of your seven years' constant cookery at the
Deanery?I wouldn't have done it, only this is your first offence!You're not too old; I want to give you another start in life!Woman, do you think I've no conscience?Do you think I
don't realize the enormity of the--of the difficulties in alighting
from a vehicle in rapid motion?[_Opening the oven and taking out a small joint in a baking tin, which
she places on the table._] It's 'unger what makes you feel
conscientious![_Waving her away._] I have done with you!With me, sir--but not with the joint!You'll feel wickeder when you've
had a little nourishment.[_He looks hungrily at the dish._] That's
right, Dean, dear--taste my darling Noah's favorite dish.[_Advancing towards the table._] Oh, Hannah Topping--Hannah Topping![_Clutching the carving-knife despairingly._] I'll have no more women
cooks at the Deanery![_Sitting and carving with desperation._

HANNAH.You can't blow that whistle on an empty
frame.[_THE DEAN begins to eat._] Don't my cooking carry you back,
sir?Ah, if every mouthful would carry me back one little hour I would
finish this joint![_NOAH TOPPING, unperceived by HANNAH and THE DEAN, climbs in by the
window, his eyes bolting with rage--he glares round the room, taking
in everything at a glance._

NOAH.[_Under his breath._] My man o' mystery--a waited on by my nooly made
wife--a heating o' my favorite meal.[_Touching HANNAH on the arm, she turns and faces him, speechless with
fright._

THE DEAN.[_Still eating._] If my mind were calmer this would be an
all-sufficient repast.[_HANNAH tries to speak, then clasps her hands
and sinks on her knees to NOAH._] Hannah, a little plain cold water in
a simple tumbler, please.[_Grimly--folding his arms._] 'Annah, hintrodooce me.[_HANNAH gives a
cry and clings to NOAH'S legs._

THE DEAN.[_Calmly to NOAH._] Am I to gather, constable, from your respective
attitudes that you object to these little kindnesses extended to me by
your worthy wife?I'm wishin' to know the name o' my worthy wife's friend.A friend o'
hern is a friend o' mian.She's gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends since we coom to St.I made this gentleman's acquaintance through the wicket, in a
casual way.Cooks and railins--cooks and railins!I might a guessed my wedded
life 'ud a coom to this.He spoke to me just as a strange gentleman ought to speak to a lady!Didn't you, sir--didn't you?Hannah, do not let us even under these circumstances prevaricate; such
is not quite the case![_NOAH advances savagely to THE DEAN.There is a knocking at the
door.--NOAH restrains himself and faces THE DEAN._

NOAH.Noa, this is neither the toime nor pla-ace, wi' people at the door and
dinner on t' table, to spill a strange man's blood.I trust that your self-respect as an officer of the law will avert
anything so unseemly.You've touched me on my point o' pride.There ain't
another police-station in all Durnstone conducted more strict and
rigid nor what mian is, and it shall so continue.You and me is a
goin' to set out for Durnstone, and when the charges now standin' agen
you is entered, it's I, Noah Topping, what'll hadd another![_There is another knock at the door._

HANNAH.The charge of allynating the affections o' my wife, 'Annah!Ay, and worse--the embezzlin' o' my mid-day meal prepared by her
'ands.[_Points into the cell._] Go in; you 'ave five minutes more in
the 'ome you 'ave ruined and laid waste.[_Going to the door and turning to NOAH._] You will at least receive
my earnest assurance that this worthy woman is extremely innocent?[_Points to the joint on the table._] Look theer![_THE
DEAN, much overcome, disappears through the cell door, which NOAH
closes and locks.To HANNAH,
pointing to the outer door._] Hunlock that door![_Weeping._] Oh, Noahry, you'll never be popular in St.[_HANNAH unlocks the door, and admits GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM, both
dressed for the race-course._

GEORGIANA.Take a chair, lady, near the fire.[_To SIR TRISTRAM._] Sit
down, sir.This is my first visit to a police-station, my good woman; I hope it
will be the last.Oh, don't say that, ma'am.We're honly hauxilliary 'ere, ma'am--the
Bench sets at Durnstone.I must say you try to make everybody feel at home.[_HANNAH curtseys._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_To HANNAH._] Perhaps this is only a police-station for the young?No, ma'am, we take ladies and gentlemen like yourselves.[_Who has not been noticed, surveying GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM,
gloomily._] 'Annah, hintrodooce me.[_Facing NOAH._] Good gracious!'Annah's a gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends this week since we
coom to St.Noah, Noah--the lady and gentlemen is strange.Ay; are you seeing me on business or pleasure?Do you imagine people come here to see you?Noa--they generally coom to see my wife.'Owever, if it's business
[_pointing to the other side of the room_] that's the hofficial
side--this is domestic.SIR TRISTRAM _and_ GEORGIANA.[_Changing their seats._

SIR TRISTRAM.Tidman is the
sister of Dr.She's profligate--proceedins are pendin'![_To SIR TRISTRAM._] Strange police station![_To NOAH._] Well, my good man, to come to the point.My poor friend
and this lady's brother, Dr.Jedd, the Dean, you know--has
mysteriously and unaccountably disappeared.Now, look 'ere--it's no good a gettin' 'asty and irritable with the
law.I'll coom over to yer, officially.[_Putting the baking tin under his arm he crosses over to SIR TRISTRAM
and GEORGIANA._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Putting his handkerchief to his face._] Don't bring that horrible
odor of cooking over here.It's evidence against my profligate wife.[_SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA exchange looks of impatience._

GEORGIANA.Do you realize that my poor brother the Dean is missing?Touching this missin' De-an.I left him last night to retire to rest.'As it struck you to look in 'is bed?GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.It's only confusin'--hall doin' it![_GEORGIANA puts her handkerchief to her eyes._

SIR TRISTRAM.This is his sister--I am his
friend!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.A the'ry that will put you all out o' suspense!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.I've been a good bit about, I read a deal, and I'm a shrewd
experienced man.I should say this is nothin' but a hordinary case of
sooicide.[_GEORGIANA sits faintly._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Savagely to NOAH._] Get out of the way!Oh, Tris, if this were true how could we break it to the girls?I could run oop, durin' the evenin', and break it to the girls.[_Turns upon NOAH._] Look here, all you've got to do is to hold your
tongue and take down my description of the Dean, and report his
disappearance at Durnstone.[_Pushing him into a chair._] Go on!The Very Reverend Augustin Jedd, Dean of St.[_Softly to GEORGIANA._] Lady, lady.[_NOAH prepares to write, depositing the baking-tin on the table._

GEORGIANA.[_Speaks to GEORGIANA excitedly._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_To NOAH._] Have you got that?[_Writing laboriously with his legs curled round the chair and his
head on the table._] Ay.I suppose he was jest the hordinary sort o' lookin' man.[_Turning from HANNAH, excitedly._] Description--a little, short, thin
man, with black hair and a squint![_To GEORGIANA._] No, no, he isn't.I'm Gus's sister--I ought to know what he's like!Good heavens, Georgiana--your mind is not going?[_Clutching SIR TRISTRAM'S arm and whispering in his ear, as she
points to the cell door._] He's in there!Gus is the villain found dosing Dandy Dick last night![_HANNAH seizes SIR TRISTRAM and talks to him
rapidly._] [_To NOAH._] What have you written?I've written "Hanswers to the name o' Gus!"Sandra went to the hallway.[_Snatching the paper from him._] It's not wanted.I'm too busy to bother about him this week.Look here--you're the constable who took the man in the Deanery
Stables last night?[_Looking out of the window._] There's my cart outside ready to
take the scoundrel over to Durnstone.[_He tucks the baking-tin under his arm and goes up to the cell door._

GEORGIANA.[_To herself._] Oh, Gus, Gus![_Unlocking the door._] I warn yer.[_NOAH goes into the cell, closing the door after him._

Tris!What was my brother's motive in bolusing Dandy last night?The first thing to do is to get him out of this hole.But we can't trust to Gus rolling out of a flying dogcart!Why, it's
as much as I could do!Oh, yes, lady, he'll do it.There's another--a awfuller charge hangin' over his
reverend 'ead.To think my own stock should run vicious like this.[_NOAH comes out of the cell with THE DEAN, who is in handcuffs._

GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.[_Raising his eyes, sees SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA, and recoils with
a groan, sinking on to a chair._] Oh!I am the owner of the horse stabled at the Deanery.I
make no charge against this wretched person.[_To THE DEAN._] Oh man,
man!I was discovered administering to a suffering beast a simple remedy
for chills.The analysis hasn't come home from the chemist's yet.[_To NOAH._] Release this man.He was found trespassin' in the stables of the la-ate
De-an, who has committed sooicide.I----

SIR TRISTRAM, GEORGIANA _and_ HANNAH.The Diseased De-an is the honly man wot can withdraw one charge----

THE DEAN.SIR TRISTRAM, GEORGIANA _and_ HANNAH.And I'm the honly man wot can withdraw the other.I charge this person unknown with allynating the affections o' my wife
while I was puttin' my 'orse to.And I'm goin' to drive him over to
Durnstone with the hevidence.Oh lady, lady, it's appearances what is against us.[_Through the opening of the door._] Woa![_Whispering to THE DEAN._] I am disappointed in you, Angustin.Have
you got this wretched woman's whistle?[_Softly to THE DEAN._] Oh Jedd, Jedd--and these are what you call
Principles![_Appearing in the doorway._] Time's oop.May I say a few parting words in the home I have apparently wrecked?In setting out upon a journey, the termination of which is
problematical, I desire to attest that this erring constable is the
husband of a wife from whom it is impossible to withhold respect, if
not admiration.As for my wretched self, the confession of my weaknesses must be
reserved for another time--another place.[_To GEORGIANA._] To you,
whose privilege it is to shelter in the sanctity of the Deanery, I
give this earnest admonition.Within an hour from this terrible
moment, let the fire be lighted in the drawing-room--let the missing
man's warm bath be waiting for its master--a change of linen prepared.[_NOAH takes him by the arm and leads him out._

GEORGIANA.Oh, what am I to think of my brother?[_Kneeling at GEORGIANA'S feet._] Think!That he's the beautifullest,
sweetest man in all Durnshire!It's I and my whistle and Nick the fire-brigade horse what'll bring
him back to the Deanery safe and unharmed.Not a soul but we three'll
ever know of his misfortune.[_Rushing to the door and looking out._] He's done
for!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.Noah's put Kitty in the cart, and
left Old Nick at home!_The second scene is the Morning Room at the Deanery again._

_SALOME and SHEBA are sitting there gloomily._

SALOME.In the meantime it is such a comfort to feel that we have no
cause for self-reproach.[_Clinging to SALOME._] If I should pine and ultimately die of this
suspense I want you to have my workbox.[_Shaking her head and sadly turning away._] Thank you, dear, but if
Papa is not home for afternoon tea you will outlive me.[_Turning towards the window as MAJOR TARVER and MR.DARBEY appear
outside._

DARBEY.[_SALOME unfastens the window._

DARBEY.Don't be shocked when you see Tarver._TARVER and DARBEY enter, dressed for the Races, but DARBEY is
supporting TARVER, who looks extremely weakly._

TARVER.You do well, gentlemen, to intrude upon two feeble women at a moment
of sorrow.One step further, and I shall ask Major Tarver, who is nearest the
bell, to ring for help.[_TARVER sinks into a chair._

DARBEY.[_Standing by the side of TARVER._] There now.Miss Jedd,
that Tarver is in an exceedingly critical condition.Feeling that he
has incurred your displeasure he has failed even in the struggle to
gain the race-course.Middleton and I
explained that Major Tarver loved with a passion [_looking at SHEBA_]
second only to my own.[_Sitting comfortably on the settee._] Oh, we cannot listen to you,
Mr.[_The two girls exchange looks._

DARBEY.The Doctor made a searching examination of the Major's tongue and
diagnosed that, unless the Major at once proposed to the lady in
question and was accepted, three weeks or a month at the seaside would
be absolutely imperative.We are curious to see to what lengths you will go.The pitiable condition of my poor friend speaks for itself.I beg your pardon--it does nothing of the kind.[_Rising with difficulty and approaching SALOME._] Salome--I have
loved you distractedly for upwards of eight weeks.[_Going to him._] Oh, Major Tarver, let me pass; [_holding his coat
firmly_] let me pass, I say.[_DARBEY follows SHEBA across the room._

TARVER.To a man in my condition love is either a rapid and fatal malady, or
it is an admirable digestive.Accept me, and my merry laugh once more
rings through the Mess Room.Reject me, and my collection of vocal
music, loose and in volumes, will be brought to the hammer, and the
bird, as it were, will trill no more.And is it really I who would hush the little throaty songster?[_Taking a sheet of paper from his pocket._] I have the
Doctor's certificate to that effect.[_Both reading the certificate they walk into Library._

SHEBA.Darbey, I have never thought of marriage seriously.People never do till they _are_ married.Pardon me, Sheba--but what is your age?Oh, it is so very little--it is not worth mentioning.Cannot we remain
friends and occasionally correspond?Well, of course--if you insist----

SHEBA.No, no, I see that is impracticable.All I ask
is time--time to ponder over such a question, time to know myself
better.[_They separate as TARVER and SALOME re-enter the room.TARVER is
glaring excitedly and biting his nails._

TARVER.I never thought I should live to be accepted by anyone.DARBEY _and_ TARVER.Oh, what do you think of it, Mr.Shocking, but we oughtn't to condemn him unheard.[_At the window._] Here's Aunt Georgiana![_Going out quickly._

SALOME.[_Pulling TARVER after her._] Come this way and let us take cuttings
in the conservatory.[_They go out._

SHEBA.Darbey, wait for me--I have decided._Yes._

[_She goes out by the door as GEORGIANA enters excitedly at the
window._

GEORGIANA.[_Waving her handkerchief._] Come on, Tris!_SIR TRISTRAM and HATCHAM enter by the window carrying THE DEAN.They
all look as though they have been recently engaged in a prolonged
struggle._

SIR TRISTRAM.That I will, ma'am, and gladly.[_They deposit THE DEAN in a chair and GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM each
seize a hand, feeling THE DEAN'S pulse, while HATCHAM puts his hand on
THE DEAN'S heart._

THE DEAN.[_Opening his eyes._] Where am I now?SIR TRISTRAM _and_ HATCHAM

[_Quietly._] Hurrah![_To HATCHAM._] We can't shout here; go and cheer
as loudly as you can in the roadway by yourself.[_HATCHAM runs out at the window._

THE DEAN.[_Gradually recovering._] Georgiana--Mardon.How are you, Jedd, old boy?I feel as if I had been walked over carefully by a large concourse of
the lower orders![_HATCHAM'S voice is heard in the distance cheering.They all listen._

SIR TRISTRAM.That's Hatcham; I'll raise his wages.Do I understand that I have been forcibly and illegally rescued?A woman who would have been a heroine in any age--Georgiana!Georgiana, I am bound to overlook it, in a relative, but never let
this occur again.You found out that that other woman's plan went lame, didn't you?I discovered its inefficacy, after a prolonged period of ineffectual
whistling.But we ascertained the road the genial constable was going to follow.He was bound for the edge of the hill, up Pear Tree Lane, to watch the
Races.Directly we knew this, Tris and I made for the Hill.Bless your
soul, there were hundreds of my old friends there--welshers,
pick-pockets, card-sharpers, all the lowest race-course cads in the
kingdom.In a minute I was in the middle of 'em, as much at home as a
Duchess in a Drawing-room.Instantly
there was a cry of "Blessed if it ain't George Tidd!"Tears of real
joy sprang to my eyes--while I was wiping them away Tris had his
pockets emptied and I lost my watch.Ah, Jedd, it was a glorious moment!Tris made a back, and I stood on it, supported by a correct-card
merchant on either side."Dear friends," I said; "Brothers!You should have heard the shouts of honest welcome.Before I could obtain silence my field glasses had gone on their long
journey."A very dear relative of mine has
been collared for playing the three-card trick on his way down from
town.""He'll be on the brow of the
Hill with a bobby in half-an-hour," said I, "who's for the rescue?"A
dead deep silence followed, broken only by the sweet voice of a young
child, saying, "What'll we get for it?""A pound a-piece," said I.
There was a roar of assent, and my concluding words, "and possibly six
months," were never heard.At that moment Tris' back could stand it no
longer, and we came heavily to the ground together.[_Seizing THE DEAN
by the hand and dragging him up._] Now you know whose hands have led
you back to your own manger.[_Embracing him._] And oh, brother,
confess--isn't there something good and noble in true English sport
after all?But whence
is the money to come to reward these dreadful persons?I cannot
reasonably ask my girls to organize a bazaar or concert.Well, I've cleared fifteen hundred over the Handicap.Then the horse who enjoyed the shelter of the
Deanery last night----

SIR TRISTRAM.All the rest nowhere, and Bonny Betsy walked in
with the policeman.[_To himself._] Five hundred pounds towards the Spire!Oh, where is Blore with the good news!Sir Tristram, I am under the impression that your horse swallowed
reluctantly a small portion of that bolus last night before I was
surprised and removed.By the bye, I am expecting the analysis of that concoction every
minute.Spare yourself the trouble--the secret is with me.I seek no
acknowledgment from either of you, but in your moment of deplorable
triumph remember with gratitude the little volume of "The Horse and
its Ailments" and the prosaic name of its humane author--John Cox.[_He goes out through the Library._

GEORGIANA.But oh, Tris Mardon, what can I ever say to you?Why, you were the man who hauled Augustin out of the
cart by his legs!And when his cap fell off, it was you--brave
fellow that you are--who pulled the horse's nose-bag over my brother's
head so that he shouldn't be recognized.My dear Georgiana, these are the common courtesies of every-day life.They are acts which any true woman would esteem.Gus won't readily
forget the critical moment when all the cut chaff ran down the back of
his neck--nor shall I.

SIR TRISTRAM.Nor shall I forget the way in which you gave Dandy his whisky out of a
soda water bottle just before the race.That's nothing--any lady would do the same.You looked like the Florence Nightingale of the paddock!Oh,
Georgiana, why, why, why won't you marry me?Because you've only just asked me, Tris![_Goes to him cordially._

SIR TRISTRAM.But when I touched your hand last night, you reared!Yes, Tris, old man, but love is founded on mutual esteem; last night
you hadn't put my brother's head in that nose-bag.[_They go together to the fireplace, he with his arm round her waist._

SHEBA.[_Looking in at the door._] How annoying!There's Aunt and Sir
Tristram in this room--Salome and Major Tarver are sitting on the hot
pipes in the conservatory--where am I and Mr.[_She withdraws quickly as THE DEAN enters through the Library
carrying a paper in his hand; he has now resumed his normal
appearance._

THE DEAN.Home, with the secret of my
sad misfortune buried in the bosoms of a faithful few.Home, with the sceptre of my dignity still
tight in my grasp!What is this I have picked up on the stairs?[_Reads with a horrified look, as HATCHAM enters at the window._

HATCHAM.The chemist has just brought the annal_i_sis.[_SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA go out at the window, following HATCHAM._

THE DEAN.[_Reading._] "Debtor to Lewis Isaacs, Costumier to
the Queen, Bow Street--Total, Forty pounds, nineteen!"There was a
fancy masked ball at Durnstone last night!Salome--Sheba--no, no![_Bounding in and rushing at THE DEAN._] Papa, Papa![_SALOME seizes his hands, SHEBA his coat-tails, and turn him round
violently._

SALOME.Papa, why have you tortured us with anxiety?Before I answer a question, which, from a child to its parent,
partakes of the unpardonable vice of curiosity, I demand an
explanation of this disreputable document.[_Reading._] "Debtor to
Lewis Isaacs, Costumier to the Queen."[_SHEBA sits aghast on the table--SALOME distractedly falls on the
floor._

THE DEAN.I will not follow this legend in all its revolting intricacies.Suffice it, its moral is inculcated by the mournful total.[_Looking from one to the other._]
There was a ball at Durnstone last night.I trust I was better--that is, otherwise employed.[_Referring
to the bill._] Which of my hitherto trusted daughters was a lady--no,
I will say a person--of the period of the French Revolution?[_SHEBA points to SALOME._

THE DEAN.And a flower-girl of an unknown epoch.[_SALOME points to SHEBA._] To
your respective rooms![_The girls cling together._] Let your blinds
be drawn.At seven porridge will be brought to you.Papa, we, poor girls as we are, can pay the bill.Through the kindness of our Aunt----

SALOME.Is there no
conscience that is clear--is there no guilessness left in this house,
with the possible exception of my own![_Sobbing._] We always knew a little more than you gave us credit for,
Papa.[_Handing SHEBA the bill._] Take this horrid thing--never let it meet
my eyes again.As for the scandalous costumes, they shall be raffled
for in aid of local charities.Confidence, that precious pearl in the
snug shell of domesticity, is at an end between us.I chastise you
both by permanently withholding from you the reason of my absence from
home last night.[_The girls totter out as SIR TRISTRAM enters quickly at the window,
followed by GEORGIANA, carrying the basin containing the bolus.SIR
TRISTRAM has an opened letter in his hand._

SIR TRISTRAM.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.[_To GEORGIANA._] How dare you confront me without even the semblance
of a blush--you who have enabled my innocent babies, for the first
time in their lives, to discharge one of their own accounts.There isn't a blush in our family--if there were, you'd want it.[_SHEBA and SALOME appear outside the window, looking in._

SIR TRISTRAM.Jedd, you were once my friend, and you are to be my relative.[_Looking at GEORGIANA._] My sister![_To SIR TRISTRAM._] I offer no
opposition.But not even our approaching family tie prevents my designating you as
one of the most atrocious conspirators known in the history of the
Turf.As the owner of one-half of Dandy Dick, I denounce you!As the owner of the other half, _I_ denounce you!_SHEBA and SALOME enter, and remain standing in the recess,
listening._

SIR TRISTRAM.The chief ingredient of your infernal preparation is known.It contains nothing that I would not cheerfully administer to my own
children.[_Pointing to the paper._] Strychnine![_Clinging to each other terrified._] Oh!Summon my devoted servant Blore, in whose presence the
innocuous mixture was compounded.[_GEORGIANA rings the bell.The
girls hide behind the window curtains._] This analysis is simply the
pardonable result of over-enthusiasm on the part of our local chemist.You're a disgrace to the pretty little police station where you slept
last night![_BLORE enters and stands unnoticed._

THE DEAN.I will prove that in the Deanery Stables the common laws of
hospitality have never been transgressed.[_GEORGIANA hands THE DEAN the basin from the table._] A simple remedy
for a chill.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.I, myself, am suffering from the exposure of last night.[_Taking the
remaining bolus and opening his mouth._] Observe me![_Rushing forward, snatching the basin from THE DEAN and sinking on to
his knees._] No, no!You wouldn't 'ang the holdest
servant in the Deanery.I 'ad a honest fancy for Bonny Betsy, and I wanted this
gentleman's 'orse out of the way.And while you was mixing the dose
with the best ecclesiastical intentions, I hintroduced a foreign
element.[_Pulling BLORE up by his coat collar._] Viper!Oh sir, it was hall for the sake of the Dean.The dear Dean had only Fifty Pounds to spare for sporting purposes,
and I thought a gentleman of 'is 'igh standing ought to have a
certainty.I can conceal it no longer--I--I instructed this unworthy creature to
back Dandy Dick on behalf of the Restoration Fund.[_Shaking BLORE._] And didn't you do it?In the name of that tottering Spire, why not?Oh, sir, thinking as you'd given some of the mixture to Dandy I put
your cheerful little offering on to Bonny Betsy.[_SALOME and SHEBA disappear._

THE DEAN.[_To BLORE._] I could have pardoned everything but this last act
of disobedience.If I leave the Deanery, I shall give my reasons, and then what'll
folks think of you and me in our old age?Not if sober, sir--but suppose grief drove me to my cups?I must save you from intemperance at any cost.Remain in my service--a
sad, sober and, above all, a silent man![_SALOME and SHEBA appear as BLORE goes out through the window._

SALOME.Darbey!----

THE DEAN.If you have sufficiently merged all sense of moral rectitude as to
declare that I am not at home, do so.Papa; we have accidentally discovered that you, our parent,
have stooped to deception, if not to crime.We are still young--the sooner, therefore, we are removed from any
unfortunate influence the better.We have an opportunity of beginning life afresh.These two gallant gentlemen have proposed for us.[_He goes out rapidly, followed by SALOME and SHEBA.Directly they
have disappeared, NOAH TOPPING, looking dishevelled, rushes in at the
window, with HANNAH clinging to him._

NOAH.[_Glaring round the room._] Is this 'ere the Deanery?[_GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM come to him._

HANNAH.Theer's been a man rescued from my lawful custody while my face was
unofficially held downwards in the mud.The villain has been traced
back to the Deanery.The man was a unknown lover of my nooly made wife!You mustn't bring your domestic affairs here; this is a subject for
your own fireside of an evening.[_THE DEAN appears outside the window with SALOME, SHEBA, TARVER and
DARBEY._

THE DEAN.[_Outside._] Come in, Major Tarver--come in, Mr._THE DEAN enters, followed by SALOME, TARVER, SHEBA and DARBEY._

NOAH.[_Confronting THE DEAN._] My man.I'm speaking to the man I took last night--the culprit as 'as
allynated the affections of my wife.[_Going out at the window._

[_SALOME and TARVER go into the Library and sit at the writing-table.DARBEY sits in an arm-chair with SHEBA on the arm._

THE DEAN.[_Mildly._] Do not let us chide a man who is conscientious even in
error.[_Looking at HANNAH._] I think I see Hannah Evans, once an
excellent cook under this very roof.Topping now, sir--bride o' the constable.And oh, do forgive
him--he's a mass o' ignorance.[_HANNAH returns to NOAH.as SIR TRISTRAM re-enters with HATCHAM._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_To HATCHAM._] Hatcham--[_pointing to THE DEAN_]--Is that the man you
and the Constable secured in the stable last night?Bless your 'art, sir, that's the Dean 'imself.[_To NOAH._] Why, our man was a short, thin individual![_HATCHAM goes out at the window._

THE DEAN.[_To NOAH._] I trust you are perfectly satisfied.[_Wiping his brow and looking puzzled._] I'm doon.I withdraw unreservedly any charge against this
unknown person found on my premises last night.I attribute to him the
most innocent intentions.Hannah, you and your worthy husband will
stay and dine in my kitchen.[_Turning angrily to HANNAH._] Now then, you don't know a real
gentleman when you see one.Why don't 'ee thank the Dean warmly?[_Kissing THE DEAN'S hands with a curtsey._] Thank you, sir.[_Benignly._] Go--go.[_They back out, bowing and curtseying._

GEORGIANA.Well, Gus, you're out of all your troubles.My family influence gone forever--my dignity crushed out of all
recognition--the genial summer of the Deanery frosted by the winter of
Deceit.Ah, Gus, when once you lay the whip about the withers of the horse
called Deception he takes the bit between his teeth, and only the
devil can stop him--and he'd rather not.Shall I tell you who has been
riding the horse hardest?[_SHEBA sits at the piano and plays a bright air softly--DARBEY
standing behind her--SALOME and TARVER stand in the archway._

GEORGIANA.[_Slapping THE DEAN on the back._] Look here, Augustin, George Tidd
will lend you that thousand for the poor, innocent old Spire.[_Taking her hand._] Oh, Georgiana!On one condition--that you'll admit there's no harm in our laughing at
a Sporting Dean.My brother Gus doesn't want us to be merry at his expense.[_They both laugh._

THE DEAN.[_Trying to silence them._] No, no!Why, Jedd, there's no harm in laughter, for those who laugh or those
who are laughed at.Provided always--firstly, that it is Folly that is laughed at and not
Virtue; secondly, that it is our friends who laugh at us, [_to the
audience_] as we hope they all will, for our pains.THE END

In addition, when there was a question about the printed text, another
edition posted by The Internet Archive was consulted:

http://archive.org/details/dandydickplayint00pineiala

The following changes were made to the text:

-  Throughout the text, dashes at the end of lines have been
normalized.-  Throughout the text, "and" in the character titles preceding
dialogue has been italicized consistently and names in stage
directions have been consistently either capitalized (in the text
version) or set in small caps (in the html version).-  In the Introductory Note, "St.Marvells" has an apostrophe, whereas
in the text of the play it almost always does not.The inconsistency
has been allowed to stand in the Introductory Note, but the apostrophe
has been removed in the few instances in the text.25: "_THE DEAN gives DARBEY a severe look..._"--A bracket has
been added to the beginning of this line.--The second "No" has been changed to lower
case.139: "Oh, what do you think of it.--The period
after "it" has been changed to a comma.141: "We can't shout here, go and cheer..."--The comma has been
changed to a semicolon.142: "That's Hatcham, I'll raise his wages."--The comma has
been changed to a semicolon.143: "'aint" has been changed to "ain't".147: "...mutual esteem, last night..."--The comma has been
changed to a semicolon.The html version of this etext attempts to reproduce the layout of the
printed text.However, some concessions have been made, particularly
in the handling of stage directions enclosed by brackets on at least
one side.In general, the
stage directions were typeset in the printed text as follows:

-  Before and within dialogue.-  Flush right, on the same line as the end of dialogue if there was
enough space; on the next line, if there was not.-  If the stage directions were two lines, they were indented from the
left margin as hanging paragraphs.How much the stage directions were
indented varied.In the etext, all stage directions not before or within dialogue are
placed on the next line, indented the same amount from the left
margin, and coded as hanging paragraphs.The hygienic surroundings should be made as sanitary as
possible.{336} Stomatitis Ulcerosa.DEFINITION.--Inflammation of the interior of the mouth, usually
unilateral, eventuating in multiple ulcerations of the mucous membrane.SYNONYMS.--Fetid stomatitis, Phlegmonous stomatitis, Putrid sore mouth,
Stomacace, are synonymous terms for idiopathic ulcerous stomatitis.Ulcero-membranous stomatitis, Mercurial stomatitis (Vogel), are
synonymous terms for the deuteropathic variety of the disease.ETIOLOGY.--The principal predisposing cause of the disease is to be
found in ochlesis; the contaminating atmosphere of crowded dwellings
and apartments insufficiently ventilated; uncleanliness; insufficiency
of proper clothing; unhealthy food, and the like.It prevails
epidemically in crowded tenements, schools, prisons, asylums, and
hospitals; in garrisons and in camps; in transports and men-of-war.It
is often propagated by contagion, but whether by infection or actual
inoculation seems undetermined.Measles is an active predisposing
cause.Feeble individuals are the most liable to the disease.In civil life it is most frequent between the ages of four
and ten years.Sometimes more girls are affected than boys (Meigs), and
sometimes it is the more prevalent among boys (Squarrey).Autumn is the
season of greatest prevalence.Carious teeth, fracture and necrosis of the jaw (Meigs), and protracted
catarrhal stomatitis are among the chief exciting causes.Irregular
dentition is sometimes the exciting cause; and this may occur at the
first and second dentition or at the period of eruption of the last
molars.PATHOLOGY.--The anatomical lesion is the destructive inflammation of
portions of the mucous membrane of the mouth, leaving ulceration on
detachment of the eschars.It usually commences as a gingivitis.At two
periods of life--namely, from the fourth to the eighth year of life,
and from the eighteenth to the twenty-fifth year--it is apt to be
ulcero-membranous, a condition asserted to be altogether exceptional at
other periods (Chauffard).A diffuse fibro-purulent infiltration of the lymph-spaces of the mucosa
is regarded as the first step in the pathological process.This
infiltration is sufficiently abundant to compress the capillary vessels
of the tissues, and thus arrest the circulation (Cornil et Ranvier).All those localized portions of mucous membrane from which the
circulation is cut off perish and are discharged in fragments.The
ulcers thus left are grayish, granular, and sanious, with thin,
irregularly dentated borders a little undermined, through which pus can
be expressed on pressure.The usual cryptogams of the oral cavity, in
various stages of development, are in great abundance in the grayish
detritus, which likewise contains altered red and white
blood-corpuscles.According to some observers (Caffort, Bergeron), the first evidence of
the disease is an intensely congested erythematous patch, upon which
one or more pustules present, point, and rupture promptly, leaving the
characteristic ulcerations.For some indeterminate reason, the ulcerations are mostly unilateral,
and occur much the more frequently on the left side.The principal
{337} primal points of ulceration are upon the external borders of the
gums, more frequently those of the lower jaw, and upon the
corresponding surface of the cheek and lip--the cheek much oftener than
the lip.Thence ulceration may extend to the tongue, less frequently to
the palate.The ulcerative process follows the outline of the gums,
baring the bases of the teeth to a variable extent, so that they seem
elongated.On the cheek the patch of inflammation is generally oval,
the longest diameter being antero-posterior, and the most frequent
position is opposite to the last molar.Each ulcer is surrounded by an intensely red areola, beyond which the
tissues are succulent and tumid from collateral inflammatory oedema,
often giving the ulcers an appearance of great depth; but when the
detritus is discharged they are seen to have been superficial.Detachment of the necrosed segments of mucous membrane takes place by
gradual exfoliation from periphery to centre.Sometimes detachment
occurs in mass, usually in consequence of friction or suction.The
ulcers, gingival and buccal, bleed easily when disturbed.They may
remain separate, or may coalesce by confluence of interposing
ulcerations extending across the furrow between gum and cheek or lip.The adjoining side of the tongue sometimes undergoes similar ulceration
from behind forward, inoculated, most likely, by contact with adjoining
ulceration.In rare instances, neglected cases most probably, the
ulceration may extend to the palatine folds, the tonsils, and the soft
palate.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The affection usually begins without any
constitutional symptoms.Young infants sometimes present slight febrile
symptoms, with impairment of appetite and general languor.Fetid
breath, salivation, and difficulty in deglutition are usually the first
manifestations of the disease to attract attention.The mouth will be
found to be hot, painful, and sensitive to the contact of food.Infants
often refuse food altogether, though usually they can be coaxed to take
liquid aliment.Larger children and adults complain of scalding
sensations.They find mastication painful, and cannot chew at all on
the affected side.The salivation is excessive, the saliva bloody and
often extremely fetid.When swallowed, this fetid saliva causes
diarrhoea.The cheeks sometimes become swollen, and the submaxillary
connective tissue oedematous.Adenitis takes place in the submaxillary,
retro-maxillary, and sublingual glands of the affected side.Sometimes
the other side becomes affected likewise, but to a less extent.The
glands do not suppurate, but the adenitis may remain as a chronic
manifestation in scrofulous subjects.The disease, left to itself, will often continue for a number of weeks,
or even months as may be, unmodified even by intercurrent maladies
(Bergeron).Long continuance may result in partial or complete
disruption of the teeth, or in local gangrene, or even in necrosis of
the alveoli (Damaschino).Properly managed, the ulcers become cleansed
of their detritus, and within a few days heal by granulation, their
position long remaining marked by delicate red cicatrices upon a hard
and thickened substratum.DIAGNOSIS.--The appearances of the gums and adjoining structures
described under the head of Pathology establish the diagnosis.The
usually unilateral manifestation and the peculiar fetid odor
distinguish it from severe forms of catarrhal stomatitis.From cancrum
oris it is {338} distinguished by the absence of induration of the skin
of the cheek over the swollen membrane, and by the succulence and
diffuseness of the tumefaction.From mercurial stomatitis it is
discriminated by the history, and by the absence of the peculiar
manifestations to be discussed under the head of that disease.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is good, the disease being susceptible of
cure in from eight to ten days in ordinary cases.When due nutrition is
prevented by the pain in mastication and deglutition, and in
much-reduced subjects, the disease may continue for several weeks.It
is in these cases that detachment of the teeth takes place, with
periostitis and necrosis of the alveoli.Protracted suppuration and
failure in nutrition may lead to a fatal result, but such a termination
is uncommon.TREATMENT.--Fresh air, unirritating and easily digestible food, the
best hygienic surroundings practicable, attention to secretions from
skin and bowels by moderate and judicious use of ablutions,
diaphoretics, and laxatives, with the internal administration of
cinchona or its derivatives, with iron and cod-liver oil, comprise the
indications for constitutional treatment.Locally, demulcent mouth-washes are called for, containing astringents,
detergents, or antiseptics.Acidulated washes are more agreeable in
some instances.For antiseptic purposes, however, sprays and douches
may be used of solutions of potassium permanganate, boric acid,
carbolic acid, or salicylic acid.Gargles of potassium chlorate, ten or
twenty grains to the ounce, are highly recommended, as well as the
internal administration of the same salt in doses of from two to five
grains three times a day for children, and of ten to twenty grains for
adults.If the sores are slow to heal, the ulcerated surfaces may be touched
once or twice daily with some astringent, such as solution of silver
nitrate (ten grains to the ounce), or, if that be objectionable, with
alum, tincture of iodine, or iodoform.Prompt extraction of loose teeth and of loose fragments of necrosed
bone is requisite.DEFINITION.--A non-contagious, deuteropathic inflammation of the
interior of the mouth, almost invariably unilateral, and characterized
by a peculiar gangrenous destruction of all the tissues of the cheek
from within outward.SYNONYMS.--Gangrenous stomatitis; Gangrena oris; Grangrenopsis; Cancrum
oris; Stomato-necrosis; Necrosis infantilis; Gangrene of the mouth;
Gangrenous erosion of the cheek; Noma; Buccal anthrax; Aquatic cancer;
Water cancer; Scorbutic cancer; Sloughing phagedaena of the mouth.HISTORY.--The most important work upon the subject was published in
1828, from the pen of Dr.A. L. Richter,[10] whose accurate historical
account of the disease was in great part reproduced, with additions
thereto, by Barthez and Rilliet in their _Treatise on the Diseases of
Infants_, Paris, 1843, and quoted by nearly all subsequent writers on
the {339} theme.From these records it appears that the first accurate
description of the affection was given in 1620 by Dr.Battus, a Dutch
physician, in his _Manual of Surgery_.The term aquatic cancer,
_water-kanker_, bestowed on it by van de Voorde, has been generally
followed by the physicians of Holland, although van Swieten (1699)
properly designated it as gangrene.J. van Lil termed it noma, as well
as stomacace and water-kanker, and cited a number of Dutch physicians
who had observed its epidemic prevalence.The majority of more recent
observers, however, deny its epidemic character.[Footnote 10: _Der Wasserkrebs der Kinder_, Berlin, 1828; further,
_Beitrag zur Lehre vom Wasserkrebs_, Berlin, 1832; _Bemerkungen uber
den Brand der Kinder_, Berlin, 1834.]Of Swedish writers, Lund described it as gangrene of the mouth; Leutin,
under the name of ulocace.In England, Boot was the first to write of
gangrene of the mouth, and was followed by Underwood, Symmonds,
Pearson, S. Cooper, West, and others.Berthe[11] described it as
gangrenous scorbutis of the gums; Sauvages (1816) as necrosis
infantilis.Baron in 1816 published[12] a short but excellent account
of a gangrenous affection of the mouth peculiar to children; and Isnard
presented in 1818 his inaugural thesis on a gangrenous affection
peculiar to children, in which he described, simultaneously, gangrene
of the mouth and gangrene of the vulva.Then followed Rey, Destrees
(1821), Billard (1833), Murdoch, Taupin (1839), and others, until we
reach the admirable description by Barthez et Rilliet, from which the
present historical record has been chiefly abstracted.[Footnote 11: _Memoires de l'Academie royale de Chirurgie_, Paris,
1774, t. v. p.[Footnote 12: _Bulletins de la Faculte de Medecine de Paris_, 1816, t.
v. p.De Hilden,
A. G. Richter, C. F. Fischer, Seibert, and many others preceded A. L.
Richter, whose important contribution to the literature and description
of the disease has been so highly extolled by Barthez and Rilliet.In America the disease has been best described by Coates, Gerhard, and
Meigs and Pepper, all of Philadelphia.(For extensive bibliographies the following sources should be consulted
in addition to those cited: J. Tourdes, _Du Noma ou du Sphacele de la
Bouche chez les Enfants_, These, Strasbourg, 1848: A. Le Dentu,
_Nouveau Dictionnaire de Medecine et de Chirurgie pratique_, article
"Face," Paris, 1871.)ETIOLOGY.--Almost exclusively a disease of childhood, gangrenous
stomatitis is exceedingly rare in private practice, and very infrequent
at the present day even in hospital and dispensary practice.Lack of
hygienic essentials of various kinds, impoverishment, long illnesses,
and debilitating maladies in general are the predisposing causes.It is
sometimes endemic in hospitals and public institutions, but rarely, if
at all, epidemic.It is not generally deemed contagious, though so
considered by some writers.It appears to have been more frequent in
Holland than elsewhere, to be more frequent in Europe generally than in
the United States, and now much less frequent in the United States than
formerly.To recognition of the predisposing causes and to their
abolition and avoidance may probably be attributed its diminished
frequency all over the world.Though attacking children only as a rule,
it has been observed in adults (Barthez et Rilliet, Tourdes, Vogel).Nurslings are not liable to the disease.Though occurring occasionally
earlier in life, the greatest period of prevalence is {340} from the
third to the fifth or sixth year of age, and thence, with diminishing
frequency, to the twelfth and thirteenth years.It is probably equally
frequent in the two sexes, though the majority of authors have
described it as more frequent in females.Even in delicate children it is so
rarely idiopathic that this character is utterly denied it by many
observers.The disease which it follows, or with which it becomes
associated, may be acute or chronic.According to most writers, it
occurs with greatest frequency after measles.It follows scarlatina and
variola much less often.It is observed likewise after whooping cough,
typhus fever, malarial fever, entero-colitis, pneumonitis, and
tuberculosis.Excessive administration of mercury has been recognized
as an exciting cause, some cases of mercurial stomatitis progressing to
gangrene.According to Barthez et Rilliet, acute pulmonary diseases, and
especially pneumonia, are the most frequent concomitant affections, and
are usually consecutive.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, TERMINATIONS, COMPLICATIONS, AND
SEQUELAE.--The disease usually becoming manifested during other
disease, acute or chronic, or during convalescence therefrom, there are
no special constitutional symptoms indicating its onset.Hence
considerable progress may be made before its detection.The earliest
local characteristic symptom distinguishing gangrenous stomatitis is a
tense tumefaction of one cheek, usually in proximity to the mouth.The
lower lip is generally involved, thus rendering it a matter of
difficulty to open the mouth.This tumefaction in some instances
progresses over the entire side of the face up to the nose, the lower
eyelid, and even out to the ear in one direction, and down to the chin,
and even to the neck, in the other.Before the parts become swollen
externally, ulceration will have taken place to some extent in the
mucous membrane, but usually without having attracted special
attention, the subjective symptoms having been slight.A gangrenous
odor from the mouth, however, is almost always constant.Its presence,
therefore, should lead to careful investigation as to its seat and
cause.The gums opposite the internal ulcer become similarly affected
in most instances, and undergo destruction, so that the teeth may
become denuded and loosened, and even detached, exposing their alveoli.The bodies of the maxillary bones suffer in addition in some instances,
and undergo partial necrosis and exfoliation.It is maintained (Loschner, Henoch) that in some instances there is no
involvement of the mucous membrane until the ulcerative process has
reached it from the exterior.The tumefied portions of the check and lip are pale, hard, unctuous,
and glistening.They are rarely very painful, and often painless.On
palpation a hard and rounded nodule one or two centimeters in diameter
can be detected deep in the central portion of the swollen cheek.From the third to the sixth day a small, black, dry eschar, circular or
oval, becomes formed at the most prominent and most livid portion of
the swelling, whether cheek or lip.This gradually extends in
circumference for a few days or for a fortnight, sometimes taking in
almost the entire side of the face or even extending down to the neck.As it enlarges the tissues around become circumscribed with a zone
intensely red.The internal eschar extends equally with the external
one.Eventually, the {341} eschar separates, in part or in whole, and
becomes detached, leaving a hole in the cheek through which are seen
the loosened teeth and their denuded and blackened sockets.During this time the patient's strength remains tolerably well
maintained, as a rule, until the gangrene has become well advanced.Many children sit up in bed and
manifest interest in their surroundings.Others lie indifferent to
efforts made for their amusement.The pulse is small and moderately frequent, rarely exceeding 120 beats
to the minute until near the fatal close, when it often becomes
imperceptible.Appetite is often well preserved, unless pneumonia or
other complications supervene, but thirst is often intense, even though
the tongue remain moist.The desire for food sometimes continues until
within a few hours of death.Toward the last the skin becomes dry and
cold, diarrhoea sets in, emaciation proceeds rapidly, collapse ensues
and death.Death usually occurs during the second week, often before the complete
detachment of the eschar--in many instances by pneumonia, pulmonary
gangrene, or entero-colitis.Some die in collapse, which is sometimes
preceded by convulsions.When the eschars have become detached,
suppuration exhausts the forces of the patient, and death takes place
by asthenia.The complication most frequent is pneumonia, and the next
entero-colitis.Gangrene of the lungs, of the palate, pharynx, or
oesophagus, of the anus, and of the vulva, may supervene.Hemorrhage
from the facial artery or its branches has been noted as an exceptional
mode of death (Hueber), the rule being that the arteries in the
gangrenous area become plugged by thrombi, and thus prevent hemorrhage.Recovery may take place before the local disease has penetrated the
cheek--indeed, while the mucous membrane alone is involved.In recent
instances, however, the disease does not subside until after the loss
of considerable portions of the cheek, and the child recovers with
great deformity, not only from loss of tissue in the cheek and nose,
but from adhesions between the jaws and the cheek.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Gangrenous stomatitis always involves
the cheek, almost always that portion in proximity to the mouth.Both sides suffer only, it is contended, when the gangrene is limited
in extent, confined to the mucous membrane, and occupies the sides of
the frenums of the lips (Barthez et Rilliet).It usually if not
invariably begins in the mucous membrane, as a phlyctenular
inflammation, which undergoes ulceration, followed by gangrene,
immediately or not for several days, and then becomes covered with a
more or less brownish-gray eschar.The ulceration of the mucous
membrane is occasionally preceded by an oedematous condition of the
cheek externally, similar to that sometimes observed in ordinary
ulcerous stomatitis; but this is not the characteristic circumscribed,
tense infiltration observed later.This ulceration is situated most
frequently opposite the junction of the upper and lower teeth.Sometimes it proceeds from the gingivo-buccal sulcus of the lower jaw,
sometimes from the alveolar border of the gums.It extends in all
directions, and often reaches the lower lip.From three to sixteen days
may be consumed in these extensions.The {342} surrounding mucous
membrane becomes oedematous.The ulceration soon becomes followed by
gangrene, sometimes within twenty-four hours, sometimes not for two or
three days, and exceptionally not for several days.The ulcerated
surfaces bleed readily, change from gray to black, and become covered
with a semi-liquid or liquid putrescent detritus.They are sometimes
surrounded by a projecting livid areola, which soon becomes gangrenous
in its turn.The shreds of mortified membrane, though clinging a while
to the sound tissues, are easily detached, and often drop spontaneously
into the mouth.Meanwhile, there is abundant salivation, the products
of which pour from the mouth, at first sanguinolent, and subsequently
dark and putrescent and mixed with detritus of the tissues.Large
portions of the gums, and even of the mucous membrane of the palate,
may undergo destruction within a few (three to six) days.The
gangrenous destruction of the gums soon exposes the teeth, which become
loose and are sometimes spontaneously detached.Thence the periosteum
and bone become implicated and undergo partial denudation and necrosis,
and portions of necrosed bone become detached if the patient survives.The characteristic implication of the exterior of the cheek becomes
manifest from the first to the third day, but occasionally not until a
day or two later.A hard, circumscribed swelling of the cheek or cheek
and lip occurs, sometimes preceded, as already intimated, by general
oedematous infiltration.The surface is tense and unctuous, often
discolored.In its central portion is an especially hard nucleus, one
to two centimeters or more in diameter.Gangrene often takes place at
this point from within outward at a period varying from the third to
the seventh day or later.The skin becomes livid, then black; a pustule
is formed at the summit of the swelling, which bursts and discloses a
blackened gangrenous eschar from less than a line in thickness to the
entire thickness of the cheek beneath.The area of gangrene gradually
extends.The dead tissues become detached, and a perforation is left
right through the cheek, through which are discharged saliva and
detritus.Meanwhile, the submaxillary glands become swollen and the
surrounding connective tissue becomes oedematous.In some instances,
however, no change is noticeable in these glands.Examinations after death have shown that thrombosis exists for some
distance around the gangrenous mass.Hence the rarity of hemorrhage
during the detachment of the eschar.DIAGNOSIS.--In the early stage of the disease the main point of
differential diagnosis rests in the locality of the primitive lesion,
the mucous membrane of the inside of one cheek.Subsequently there is
the gangrenous odor from the mouth; the rapid peripheric extension of
the local lesion, which acquires a peculiar grayish-black color; its
rapid extension toward the exterior of the cheek or lip; the
tumefaction of the cheek, discolored, greasy, hard, surrounded by
oedematous infiltration, and presenting a central nodule of especial
hardness; then the profuse salivation, soon sanguinolent, subsequently
purulent and mingled with detritus of the mortified tissues.Finally,
the eschar on the exterior of the swollen cheek or lip leaves no doubt
as to the character of the lesion.From malignant pustule it is
distinguished by not beginning on the exterior, as that lesion always
does (Baron).PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is bad unless the lesion be quite limited
{343} and complications absent.At least three-fourths of those
attacked perish; according to some authorities fully five-sixths die.The objective symptoms of the local disease are much more important in
estimating the prognosis than are the constitutional manifestations,
the vigor of the patient, and the hygienic surroundings, although, as a
matter of course, the better these latter the more favorable the
prognosis.Prognosis would be more favorable in private practice than
in hospital or asylum service.TREATMENT.--Active treatment is required, both locally and
constitutionally.Local treatment is of paramount importance, and alone
capable of arresting the extension of the process of mortification.The
topical measure in greatest repute is energetic cauterization with the
most powerful agents, chemical and mechanical--hydrochloric acid,
nitric acid, acid solution of mercuric nitrate, and the actual cautery,
whether hot iron, thermo-, or electric cautery.The application of
acids is usually made with a firm wad or piece of sponge upon a stick
or quill, care being taken to protect the healthy tissues as far as
practicable with a spoon or spatula.After the application the mouth is
to be thoroughly syringed with water to remove or dilute the
superfluous acid.Hydrochloric acid has been preferred by most
observers.As these cauterizations must be energetic to prove effective,
anaesthesia ought to be induced.Should ether be employed for this
purpose, hydrochloric acid or the acid solution of mercuric nitrate
would be selected of course.In the early stages these agents are to be applied to the inside of the
cheek, so as to destroy all the tissue diseased, if practicable, and
expose a healthy surface for granulation.Should the exterior of the
cheek become implicated before cauterization has been performed or in
spite of it, it is customary to destroy the tissues from the exterior,
including a zone of apparently healthy surrounding tissue.As the
gangrene extends, the cauterization is to be repeated twice daily or
even more frequently.After cauterization the parts are dressed with
antiseptic lotions, and antiseptic injections or douches are to be used
frequently during day and night to wash out the mouth and keep it as
clear as possible from detritus.Meigs and Pepper report beneficial results from the topical use of
undiluted carbolic acid, followed by a solution of the same, one part
in fifty of water, frequently employed as a mouth-wash.The progress of
the sloughing was checked and the putridity of the unseparated dead
tissue completely destroyed in the two cases mentioned by them, one of
which recovered quickly without perforation of the cheek.Gerhard
preferred undiluted tincture of the chloride of iron; Condie, cupric
sulphate, thirty grains to the ounce.Bismuth subnitrate has recently
been lauded as a topical remedial agent.[13]

[Footnote 13: Maguire, _Medical Record N.Y._, Feb.The mouth should be frequently cleansed by syringing, douching,
spraying, or washing with disinfectant solutions, such as chlorinated
soda liquor, one part to ten; carbolic acid, one to twenty.Lemon-juice
is sometimes an agreeable application, as in some other varieties of
stomatitis.Constitutionally, tonic and supporting treatment is
demanded, even in those instances where the appetite is well maintained
and the {344} general health apparently well conserved.Soups, milk,
semi-solid food, egg-nog, egg and wine, wine whey, milk punch,
finely-minced meat, should be administered as freely as the state of
the digestive functions will permit.If necessary, resort should be had
to nutritive enemata.Quinia and tincture of chloride of iron are the
medicines indicated.When sufficient alcohol cannot be given with the
food, it should be freely exhibited in the most available form by the
mouth or by the rectum.The apartment should be well ventilated, the
linen frequently changed, the discharges promptly removed.DEFINITION.--An inflammation of the interior of the mouth due to
poisoning, especially by drugs, and chiefly by mercury, copper, and
phosphorus.DEFINITION.--An inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth,
eventually ulcerating, the result of systemic poisoning by the
absorption of mercury.SYNONYMS.--Stomatitis mercurialis; Mercurial ptyalism, Ptyalismus
mercurialis; Mercurial salivation, Salivatio mercurialis.ETIOLOGY--Predisposing and Exciting Causes.--Special vulnerability to
the toxic influence of mercury, and special proclivity to inflammatory
affections of the mouth and the organs contained therein, are the
predisposing causes of mercurial stomatitis.The exciting cause is the
absorption of mercury into the tissues of the organism.The
susceptibility of healthy adults is much greater than that of healthy
children.Constitutions deteriorated by prolonged disease, undue exposure, and
the like are much more promptly influenced in consequence.Tuberculous
subjects do not bear mercury well.Idiosyncratic susceptibility to toxaemia by mercurial preparations is
now and then encountered in practice, and instances have been
published[14] in which fatal results have ensued, after prolonged
suffering, from the incautious administration of a single moderate dose
of a mercurial drug.[Footnote 14: For example, see in Watson's _Practice of Physic_ a case
of furious salivation following one administration of two grains of
calomel as a purgative, the patient dying at the end of two years, worn
out by the effects of the mercury and having lost portions of the
jaw-bone by necrosis.]Until comparatively recent years the most common cause of mercurial
poisoning was the excessive employment of mercurial medicines, whether
by ingestion, inunction, or vapor bath.Topical cauterization with acid
solution of mercuric nitrate is likewise an infrequent, and usually an
accidental, cause of the affection.Elimination of the mercury by way
of the mucous glands of mouth and the salivary glands proper excites
the stomatitis in these instances.An entirely different series of
cases occur in artisans exposed to handling the metal and its
preparations or to breathing its vapor or its dust.In these instances
the poison may gain {345} entrance into the absorbent system by the
skin, the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, and throat, the stomach,
or the lungs.No matter what care may be exercised in cleansing the
hands, it is often impossible to prevent occasional transference of the
noxious material from fingers to throat, or to thoroughly free the
finger-tips under the nails.The avocations entailing the risks of
mercurial stomatitis comprise quicksilver-mining, ore-separating,
barometer- and thermometer-making, gilding, hat-making, manufacturing
of chemicals, and exhausting the globes employed in certain forms of
electric illumination.[15] The slow absorption of mercury into the
bodies of artisans induces in addition serious constitutional nervous
disturbances--tremors, palsy, etc.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, TERMINATIONS, COMPLICATIONS, AND
SEQUELAE.--The principal subjective symptoms of mercurial stomatitis
are--characteristic fetor of the breath, sore gums and mouth,
continuous nauseous metallic brassy or coppery taste, and profuse
salivation.At first the mouth feels parched and painful, the gums tender, the
teeth, the lower incisors especially, set on edge.Soon the gums become
swollen, and when touched with the tongue seem to have receded from the
necks of the teeth, which thereby appear to be longer than usual.The
gums feel quite sore when pressed upon with the finger or when put on
the stretch by clashing the rows of teeth against each other.This sort
of soreness is often watched for in the therapeutic administration of
mercurials purposely given to "touch the gums," as an indication that
the system is under the influence of the drug.It is, therefore, one of
the earliest indications of mercurial poisoning, but if not sought for
it may elude attention until after the mouth has become sore a little
later.The pain in the mouth is augmented by efforts of mastication and
expectoration, and may be associated with pains at the angle of the
lower jaw or extending along the domain of the third or of the third
and second divisions of the distribution of the fifth cerebral nerve.Mastication of solid food is often unendurable.Constitutional
manifestations become evident about this time in increased heat of
skin, acceleration of pulse, furred tongue, dry mouth, great thirst,
and loss of appetite.The dryness of the mouth does not last long, but
is soon followed by hypersalivation, one of the characteristic
phenomena of the disorder.The saliva secreted, often acid in reaction,
varies greatly in quantity, which is usually proportionate to the
severity of the case.It is secreted night and day, sometimes to the
amount of several pints in the twenty-four hours--in moderately severe
cases to the amount of from one to two pints in that space of time.It
is limpid or grayish, mawkish or somewhat fetid, and reacts readily to
the simplest tests for mercury.The salivation is almost continuous,
sometimes quite so.The patient soon becomes unable to endure the
fatigue of constant expectoration, and the fluid then dribbles from his
mouth or runs off in an unimpeded slobber.When excessive, the
patient's strength becomes rapidly exhausted--in part by impoverishment
of the fluids, in great measure from the lack of refreshing sleep.Meanwhile, the local inflammatory process extends from the gums to the
floor of the mouth and to the lips, and thence to the tongue and the
{346} cheeks.The salivary glands are in a state of inflammation
likewise, but rather in consequence of direct irritation in the
elimination of the poison through their channels than by extension of
the stomatitis along their ducts.The lymphatic glands of the lower jaw
become engorged and tender.Mastication, deglutition, and articulation
all become impeded mechanically by tumefaction of the tissues.In some instances the glossitis is so great that the tongue protrudes,
thereby impeding respiration and even threatening suffocation.In some
cases oedema of the larynx has been noted, threatening suffocation from
that cause.Should the inflammatory process extend along the pharynx to
the Eustachian tubes, deafness and pains in the ears will become
additional symptoms.The subsequent progress of unarrested mercurial stomatitis is that of
ulcerous stomatitis.Should gangrene of the mucous membrane take place, there will be great
fetor from the mouth, and some danger of hemorrhage on detachment of
the sloughs should the process be taking place in the direction of
vessels of some calibre.Necrosis of the inferior maxilla entails
continuance of the disagreeable local symptoms until the discharge in
fragments or in mass of the dead portions of bone.In the earlier stages of the attack the constitutional symptoms may be
sthenic.Fever, cephalalgia, and the usual concomitants of pyrexia,
however, soon give way to the opposite condition of asthenia.Exhausted
by the excessive salivation, and unable to repair waste by eating or
sleeping, the sufferer soon passes into a condition of hopeless
cachexia.Those who survive remain cachectic and feeble for a long
time--some of them disfigured for life by various cicatrices between
cheeks and jaw, by loss of teeth or of portions of the jaw-bone.The duration of mercurial stomatitis varies with the susceptibility of
the patient, the intensity of the toxaemia, and the character of the
treatment.Mild cases may get well in a week or two; severe cases may
continue for weeks, and even months; extreme cases have persisted for
years.Under the improved therapeutics of the present day mercurial stomatitis
almost always terminates in recovery, especially if it receive early
and prompt attention.Neglected or improperly managed, it may terminate
in serious losses of tissue in gums, cheeks, teeth, and bone, leaving
the parts much deformed and the patient in a permanently enfeebled
condition.Erysipelas, metastatic abscesses, inflammations, pyaemia, or
colliquative diarrhoea may be mentioned as complications which may
prove sufficiently serious to produce death, independently of the
virulence of the primary stomatitis.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Mercurial stomatitis is an ulcerative
process attended with an excessive flow of saliva containing mercury.It has a tendency to terminate in destruction and exfoliation of the
mucous membrane of the gums and other tissues attacked, and eventually
in necrosis of the jaw-bone.The detritus is found, microscopically, to
consist of granular masses of broken-down tissue, swarming with
bacteria and micrococci, and containing some blood-cells and many
pus-cells.In some instances micrococci have been detected in the
blood.The disease usually begins in the gums of the lower incisors, and {347}
extends backward, often being confined to one side of the jaw.The
gums, first swollen and then livid, become separated from the necks of
the teeth.The ulcers are surrounded by
fungous margins, pale or red, which bleed on the slightest contact, and
some become covered with grayish-yellow detritus.The ulceration
extends in depth, destroying the supports of the teeth, so that they
become loosened and even detached.The inflammatory process extends to
the lips, the cheek, and the tongue, which undergo tumefaction and
exhibit the impressions of the teeth in grayish opalescent lines or
festoons of thickened epithelium at the points of pressure.It is almost always present, to some
extent, as a superficial or mucous glossitis.Occasionally acute
oedematous glossitis has ensued, and such cases sometimes terminate
fatally.Ulceration takes place in these structures similar to that
which has taken place in the gums.If not arrested, gangrenous
destruction ensues, not only in these tissues, but beneath them.Thus,
the teeth become loosened, and even detached; the jaw-bones themselves
may become bared, necrosed, and in part exfoliated; and the cheeks
undergo partial destruction by gangrene.Sometimes the inflammation
descends to the larynx, and this may produce oedematous infiltration of
the loose connective tissue of that structure.Sometimes it mounts the
pharynx and reaches the orifices of the Eustachian tubes.The salivary
glands become swollen and discharge great quantities of fluid, as
detailed under Symptomatology.The retro-maxillary and submaxillary
lymphatic glands become enlarged by inflammatory action.DIAGNOSIS.--In the earliest stages the inflammation of the gums in
mercurial stomatitis cannot be distinguished from that which takes
place in other forms of ulcerative stomatitis.The fetor of the breath,
however, the profuse salivation, and the chemical reaction of the
saliva, together with the history of exposure to mercury, soon place
the nature of the case beyond doubt.Similar results following
poisonings by copper salts and by phosphorus are differentiated by the
history of the special exposure.PROGNOSIS.--In mild cases the prognosis is favorable, provided further
exposure to the cause can be avoided.This holds good almost invariably
in cases due to over-medication with mercurials, but is far less
applicable to cases in artisans, the result of prolonged exposure to
the poisonous influences of mercury and its slow absorption.On the
whole, the affection is much less serious than formerly, both because
it can, in great measure, be guarded against by proper prophylaxis in
risky vocations, and because its treatment has been made much more
efficient.In severe cases serious results may ensue despite the most
judicious treatment, and convalescence is usually very slow, weeks
often elapsing before solid food can be chewed without pain or without
injury to the gums.When death ensues, it may be by asthenia, erysipelas, pneumonia,
pyaemia, or colliquative diarrhoea.TREATMENT.--Mercurial stomatitis may sometimes be prevented by the
administration of potassium chlorate during exposure.Mild cases
following the administration of mercurials often subside upon mere
withdrawal of the drug.Should spontaneous subsidence not take place,
the administration of potassium chlorate every few hours, in doses of
{348} from thirty to sixty grains or more in the twenty-four hours,
soon effects amelioration, which promptly terminates in recovery.The
characteristic fetor often ceases within twelve hours' use of this
drug.Should the inflammatory manifestations be severe, a few leeches
applied beneath the edge of the lower jaw, followed by a poultice
enveloping the neck to promote further flow of blood, often affords
prompt relief (Watson).Lead acetate (ten grains to the ounce of water)
and iodine (half a fluidrachm of the compound tincture to the ounce of
water) are useful as gargles and washes.When the result of slow
poisoning, elimination of the mercury by sulphur vapor baths and the
administration of small doses of potassium iodide are recommended.Cauterization of the ulcerated surfaces is sometimes serviceable,
silver nitrate or hydrochloric acid (Ricord), or chromic acid 1:5
(Butlin, Canquil), being used for the purpose.Opium in decided doses is indicated for the relief of pain.It may be
added with advantage to detergent and disinfective mouth-washes
(potassium chlorate, sodium borate, creasote-water, saponified emulsion
of coal-tar, tincture of cinchona, tincture of myrrh, etc.), the use of
which should form an important part of the treatment.Watson highly
recommended a wash of gargle of brandy and water, 1:4 or 5.In severe
cases difficulty is encountered in maintaining effective alimentation.When mastication is not impracticable, soft-boiled egg and
finely-chopped raw beef may be given.When the patient cannot chew at
all, resort is confined to milk, soups, and the juice of beef.Nourishing enemata should be administered, as in all affections where
it becomes impracticable to sustain the patient by way of the mouth.Tonics and stimulants are indicated to avoid debility from the
excessive salivation and its sequelae--quinia, coffee, wine, and
alcohol, the first, if required, by hypodermatic injection, all of them
by enema if necessary.Glossitis and oedema of the larynx may require the surgical procedures
often necessary when they occur under other circumstances.Other forms of toxic stomatitis hardly require special elucidation.Abnormalities and Vices of Conformation of the Tongue.Apart from the anomalies presented in monsters, there are a few
congenital abnormalities of the tongue with which it becomes the
accoucheur at least to be familiar, as their presence may interfere
materially with the nutrition of the infant, whether nursed or
spoon-fed.CONGENITAL DEFICIENCY OF THE TONGUE.--A considerable portion of the
tongue may be wanting anteriorly, comprising, in some instances, the
entire free portion of the organ.The stump then presents as a single
or a bifid protuberance of variable size.In some instances
considerable power of movement exists, and even conservation of taste.Suction and deglutition are both practicable.When the child grows it
can speak, though with a certain amount of difficulty.A few cases are
on record, however, of ability to speak without any evidence of a
tongue above the floor of the mouth.An instance of lateral deficiency has been observed by Chollet,[16] the
{349} deficient half being represented merely by the two layers of the
lingual mucous membrane, without any intervening muscular substance.[Footnote 16: Demarquay, _Dict.BIFID TONGUE, separate investment of the two sides, has been
occasionally observed in connection with similar arrest of development
in the lower jaw and other organs.DEFINITION.--An abnormal attachment or adhesion of some portion of the
tongue to some portion of the surrounding structures of the mouth.SYNONYM.--Tongue-tie.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--The ordinary form of tongue-tie consists
in an abnormal development of the frenum of the tongue, the anterior
vertical portion of the duplicature of mucous membrane which connects
the lower surface of the raphe of the tongue with the floor of the
mouth.Suction is
interfered with in some cases.If not remedied spontaneously or by
surgical interference, mastication and articulation may become
seriously impeded.Other forms of ankyloglossia, congenital and acquired, possess special
interest from surgical points of view mainly.DIAGNOSIS.--Inspection and digital exploration readily reveal the
nature of the restriction in the movements of the tongue and the size
of the frenum.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is good, the difficulty being susceptible of
relief by division of a portion of the constricting frenum.Accidents
have been reported following the operation, the occasional occurrence
of which should be borne in mind.These are hemorrhage, which is not
dangerous except in the prolonged absence of some one competent to
restrain it should it be extreme; and retroversion of the tongue, an
accident which has been known to prove fatal by occluding the orifice
of the larynx (Petit).TREATMENT.--Slight cases rarely need operation; but when the movements
of the tongue are restricted by a very short and deep frenum its
division becomes necessary.The operation is usually performed with
scissors, the ranine arteries being protected by means of a fissured
plate of metal (Petit), such as has long been used as a handle to the
ordinary grooved director of the physician's pocket-case.The cut
should be more extensive in the lateral directions of the fold than
antero-posteriorly.After-treatment is rarely necessary, unless
annoying hemorrhage is produced by movements of suction.Compression
between the fingers, maintained for a number of minutes, suffices to
restrain the hemorrhage in most instances.When this fails, recourse
may be had to cauterization with the point of a heated iron or some
other form of actual cautery.DEFINITION.--Hypertrophy of the tongue.SYNONYMS.--Megaloglossia, Glossoptosis, Prolapsus linguae, Lingua {350}
propendula, Chronic prolapse of the tongue, Chronic intumescence of the
tongue.HISTORY.--This rare affection has been long known, the first cases on
record being in the works of Galen.Other cases have been recorded by
Celsus and Avicenna.Among more modern recorders may be mentioned
Scaliger (1570), Bartholin (1680), Benedict and Pencer; among recent
recorders, Lassus,[17] Percy,[18] Harris,[19] Humphrey,[20]
Gayraud,[21] W. Fairlie Clarke,[22] Bryant,[23] and the French
dictionaries in present process of publication; to all of which the
reader is referred for bibliographic, descriptive, and illustrative
details.[Footnote 17: _Memoire de l'Institut National_, 18--, an VI.[Footnote 21: _These de Montpellier_, No.[Footnote 22: _Diseases of the Tongue_, London, 1873.][Footnote 23: "Surgical Affections of the Tongue," _Guy's Hosp.102 _et seq._]

ETIOLOGY.--This affection is usually congenital, at least to a certain
extent, and augments with the growth of the child.It has been
attributed, on apparently insufficient grounds, to injury received
during parturition.It is probably intra-uterine in origin.Though
encountered in both sexes, the majority of recorded cases have been in
females.In summing up these observations, it appears that the
affection often attracts little or no attention until dentition is in
progress.The hypertrophy begins to augment rapidly during the second
or third year of age, or a year or two later in some cases.The gradual increase of the congenital deformity during infancy has
been attributed to hypernutrition from local irritation produced by
habits of sucking on the organ, induced, in some subjects, by forcible
efforts at suction from a short nipple.Similarly, the rapid
augmentation of volume noted as occurring during the period of
dentition or a little later has been attributed to hypernutrition
excited by irritation suffered by the protruding organ from the lower
row of teeth.Cases commencing at this age have been supposed to be due
exclusively to tongue-sucking.In some instances, due to this cause
apparently, the deformity is associated with idiocy (Lawson[24]).Convulsions, epileptic seizures, and whooping cough have been regarded
by some writers as occasional causes of the deformity.Indeed, idiocy
and cretinism are not infrequent co-associates with the deformity
(Parrot[25]).It has been observed likewise in anencephalous monsters
(Brissot, _idem_).10 and 17, 1881; _Lond.SYMPTOMS, COURSE, DURATION, TERMINATIONS, COMPLICATIONS, AND
SEQUELAE.--The prominent symptom of macroglossia is the enlarged tongue
protruding beyond the mouth.The resemblance of the protruding tongue
of a child with macroglossia to the tongue hanging from the mouth of a
calf gave rise to the name lingua vitulina by which it has sometimes
been designated.In some instances, where the enlargement is but
moderate, the organ can be retained within the mouth.When bilateral,
the enlargement may be symmetrical, or may interest one side of the
tongue more than the other.When the enlargement is confined to the
free portion of the tongue, it interferes little with respiration and
with movements of suction.When occupying the base of the organ, it may
seriously embarrass respiration, and even produce suffocation in {351}
some instances (Clarke).The mouth being maintained open, saliva
dribbles away constantly except during alimentation.Thirst is often
very great in consequence of this, and of the desiccation of the tongue
and of the walls of the mouth by the unmodified air to which they are
continuously exposed.In some subjects, although the tongue, left to itself, protruded
considerably, it has been found quite practicable to maintain it within
the cavity of the mouth by means of bandages or other appliances
secured to the back and top of the head.These bandages are removed
from time to time to give relief from the restraint and to permit food
and drink to be taken.Systematic compression, indeed, has been induced
in this way in some instances, and has produced considerable diminution
in the size of the organ--sufficient to maintain its concealment
without the aid of an appliance.When the tongue cannot be retained
within the mouth the patient becomes unable to close the jaws.Hence
saliva dribbles constantly, save when food or drink is being taken.The
protruded portion of the tongue undergoes a livid discoloration,
sometimes diffuse, sometimes disseminated.Though sometimes remaining
comparatively soft in texture, it usually becomes hard, dry, rough,
fissured, ulcerated and sanious, covered with desiccating layers of
mucus and epithelium, and marked by indentations made by the edges of
the teeth, which sometimes seem almost to strangle it.Mastication,
deglutition, and articulation often become very difficult, and
respiration also, but less frequently.The larynx and hyoid bone become drawn upward and forward by
the weight of the organ.The configuration of the lower jaw undergoes
considerable change, and the teeth become pressed out of position.Dislocation of the jaw from this cause has been noticed (Chalk[26]).These symptoms undergo aggravation with the growth of the subject, and,
while presenting general features of resemblance in all cases, vary
considerably in individual instances.Great difficulty is encountered,
as a rule, in taking food, and mastication has to be performed very
slowly.In some instances mastication can be performed satisfactorily
by the molars, owing to a compensatory curvature of the lower jaw, even
though the anterior portions of the jaw may remain permanently
separated (Harris).Some patients get along by using their fingers to
push the bolus far {352} enough back to permit of its deglutition.Some
have used a cup with a long tube slightly curved to convey fluids to
the back part of the mouth for a similar purpose.Some have been
systematically fed by means of a catheter passed through a nasal
passage and thus on into the oesophagus.The difficulties in nourishing
patients reduce some of them to extreme emaciation.Notwithstanding all these drawbacks, quite a number of cases are on
record where the patients have reached well into adult life before
being submitted to radical measures for relief.One patient is recorded
as having reached the age of eighty, having worn for some sixty-five
years a silver shield to conceal her deformity (Clarke).PATHOLOGY AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The hypertrophy may involve all
the structures of the tongue, but usually implicates the muscular
tissue especially (Sedillot, Paget, Bouisson).In a case published by
W. Fairlie Clarke it was found on microscopic examination that the
papillae as well as the mucous and submucous tissues were somewhat
enlarged and thickened, while the bundles of muscular fibre were
slightly coarser than natural.Maas reports a unilateral case of
macroglossia in a male child two months of age associated with
hyperdevelopment of the entire left side of the body.[27] In some
instances the blood-vessels and lymphatics are chiefly involved
(Virchow, Billroth, Maas), two cases of which have been described by
Virchow as cavernous lymphatic tumors.Hilliard reports[28] a congenital case from vicious growth, removed at
fourteen months of age.Microscopic sections showed the large lacunae
filled with corpuscles, blood-pigment in different stages of
degeneration, {353} and the papillae much hypertrophied.Winiwarter[29]
reports a congenital macroglossia associated with congenital cysts of
the neck.Chir._, 1874, Bd.Sometimes there is very little true muscular hypertrophy, as in a case
quoted by Bryant which was presented to the Pathological Society of
London in 1872 by M. H. Arnott.In this specimen the epithelial
covering was very thick and the papillae enlarged.The blood-vessels
were larger than usual, and there were large irregular spaces,
thin-walled and filled with blood or clear fluid."A few vesicular
bodies which may have been enlarged lymphatics were also
present"--probably cross-sections of lymphatic vessels.The size that may be attained even in young children seems incredible,
three and four inches protruding from the mouth in some instances.The
free portion is more bulky than the intra-oral portion.One case
reported "as thick as an arm" probably refers to the arm of the child.As a rule, both sides of the tongue are involved; exceptionally, the
affection is unilateral.In most instances the hypertrophy occupied the free portion of the
tongue chiefly, the base of the organ having been implicated in but a
few.Chronic Intumescence of the Tongue (Harris).]Hypertrophy of the Tongue (Harris), before
operation and after.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of the tongue outside of the mouth speaks for
itself (Figs.The age of the patient, usually a young
child, the history of the case if it present in the adult, suffice to
differentiate macroglossia from the tumefaction of glossitis on the one
hand and from certain protruding tumors and malignant diseases on the
other.Hypertrophy of the tongue following chronic glossitis,
syphilitic or non-specific, must not be confounded with the congenital
or idiopathic affection under consideration.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is good as to relief from the deformity,
provided the patient is submitted to surgical interference, and the
prognosis of the operation depends upon the procedure selected.Sometimes additional operations are requisite to remedy the defects the
lower jaw has sustained by prolonged depression.In comparatively young
adults restoration of its position, configuration, and function seems
likely to result spontaneously after the protruding portion of the
tongue has been removed.TREATMENT.--It has been maintained (Lassus) that the hypertrophy can be
overcome by systematic compression of the tongue, by leeching the
tongue, bandaging or strapping it, and forcibly maintaining it in the
mouth by suitable retentive appliances.While it has been admitted that
this plan may prove successful in cases of moderate enlargement of but
few years' duration and unaccompanied with change in the shape of the
lower jaw, the experience of more recent observers has been recorded as
unfavorable, at least in pronounced cases.Clanny[30] succeeded in this
way with a child five years of age whose tongue protruded three inches.This plan is said to be very painful and irritating.It requires close
watching on account of the difficulty of respiration which may ensue
from thus blocking up the pharynx.It has been advised as a useful and
sometimes an essential preliminary (Syme) to a radical procedure
consisting in the excision of a V-shaped segment.This latter operation
(Boyer) has been successfully performed by Howe, Harris, Humphry, Syme,
and others.{354} Frederici[31] extended the incisions to the very base
of the tongue.It has been performed both with knife and with scissors,
the cut surfaces being united with sutures after ligation or torsion of
the bleeding vessels.Re-enlargement ensued in one of Syme's cases
operated upon in this way,[32] and likewise in a case of Gies,[33]
requiring subsequent excision of the exuberant portions.Operations
with the ligature, though sometimes successful (Fergusson,[34]
Hodgson[35]), may be followed by fatal septicaemia during the slough
(Liston[36]), or, failing to strangulate the tongue sufficiently, may
require the application of the knife, after all, to affect the
separation (Harris[37]).de Med._, 1844; _Edinb.[Footnote 34: _Practical Surgery_, London, 5th ed., p.[Footnote 36: _Elements of Surgery_, p.Excision with the incandescent loop of the galvano-cautery seems to be
the most suitable procedure.Valerani[38] operated in this manner
without the loss of a drop of blood upon a congenital macroglossia in a
child seven months of age.Maas[39] operated in this way on a child two
months of age.Fairlie Clarke, who removed a congenital macroglossia
with the ecraseur in a child five months of age, recommends operation
before dentition begins[40]--an opinion which appears to be justified
by the belief that the pressure of the teeth contributes to the
subsequent rapid enlargement of the organ.Nevertheless, the operation
may be undertaken at any age.Several of those already cited were
performed upon adults, and Stephen O'Sullivan[41] excised the
hypertrophied tongue of a female sixty-five years of age.[Footnote 38: _Giornale della Reale Accademia di Turino_, fasc.cit._]

[Footnote 40: _Lancet_, March 30, 1872, p.[Footnote 41: _Dublin Journ.Sci._, Aug., 1875, p.Ignipuncture with the thermo-cautery of Paquelin has been successfully
used of late by Helferich and by von Bruns of Tubingen.[42] In the
latter instance the subject was five years of age.Fourteen punctures
were made from above downward at intervals of about one centimeter, and
five were made transversely.On the third
day secondary hemorrhage occurred from the intercommunication of three
of the punctures; this was restrained by ferric chloride, and the case
went on to a favorable conclusion.Surgical procedures must constitute
our sole therapeutic reliance.The temporary subsidence of enlargement
under the influence of mercury and the iodides seems sure to be
followed, sooner or later, by reproduction of the deformity.It is
therefore a waste of time to attempt cures by medication.DEFINITION.--Inflammation of the tongue.The term glossitis is usually applied to inflammation of the tissues of
the tongue as a whole (parenchymatous glossitis), and not to those
superficial inflammations which exist associated with the different
varieties of {355} stomatitis and with other affections, and which
implicate the mucous membrane and its glands and papillae only
(superficial glossitis).Superficial glossitis, however, sometimes
terminates in parenchymatous glossitis.Papillae and glands are usually
affected together in superficial glossitis.When the inflammation
predominates in the papillae the disease is often designated as
papillary glossitis; when in the glands, it is often termed follicular
glossitis.Superficial glossitis, again, is sometimes manifested by the
eruption of vesicles on the tongue, under which circumstance it is
often denominated vesicular glossitis, sometimes herpetic glossitis.Glossitis is sometimes restricted to a portion of the tongue
(circumscribed glossitis), and it sometimes involves the whole of the
tongue (diffuse glossitis).Either form may be unilateral
(hemiglossitis), though both forms are more frequently bilateral.DEFINITION.--An inflammation of the mucous membrane of the tongue,
usually involving likewise both papillae and glands.SYNONYMS.--Catarrhal glossitis, Angina lingualis.Varieties: Papillary,
follicular, vesicular (herpetic and eczematous), psoriatic, ichthyotic.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing and Exciting Causes.--It is rarely idiopathic,
is most frequently deuteropathic, and sometimes traumatic.Superficial
deuteropathic glossitis usually occurs in connection with gastric and
gastro-enteric affections.It occurs likewise in association with
stomatitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, many febrile affections,
scorbutus, tuberculosis, syphilis, so-called psoriasis and ichthyosis
of the tongue, carcinoma of the tongue, and the various neoplasms of
the organ.Irregular and sharp-cornered or jagged teeth often induce
traumatic superficial glossitis.Pungent vapors, such as those of
chloride of ammonium, so much used of late years in the treatment of
nasal catarrhs, sometimes produce a superficial traumatic glossitis,
usually localized on the superior surface of the anterior portion of
the tongue.Tobacco-smoking, especially from a short-stemmed pipe, will
likewise produce it occasionally at the point where the concentrated
smoke strikes the organ.Attempts to drink liquids too hot, too acrid,
or too caustic may be mentioned as other occasional causes.Nervous
irritation, such as of the chorda-tympani nerve, is attributed as a
causal influence of unilateral vesicular glossitis, herpetic or
otherwise, and as a probable factor in other varieties of unilateral
glossitis.Eczema of the tongue may ensue as a sequel of prolonged
cutaneous eczema (De Mussy[43]).hebd._, June 22, 1883; _Med.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Superficial glossitis, as indicated,
involves the mucous membrane, glands, papillae, and epithelium.It is
hardly necessary to dwell upon the pathological conditions of the
lingual mucous membrane and its epithelium in gastro-intestinal and
febrile disorders, as these are described in connection with the
various diseases.Ordinarily, the epithelium increases in thickness,
and when detached, spontaneously or otherwise, exposes a red and
swollen membrane with erect papillae.Sometimes the condensed
stratified layer of epithelium becomes dry and very hard.Under some
illy-defined {356} conditions, the papillae of the tongue undergo great
hypertrophy.The filiform papillae become elongated to several times
their normal length, and feel and look like so many hairs on the
tongue.Like many other lingual affections, this is often unilateral.It is quite marked in some cases of influenza and other febrile
disorders, producing great annoyance in the mouth.It occurs likewise
in gastro-intestinal disorders and in disorders of the mouth and teeth.In other cases the glands
of the tongue, especially at its base, become involved, forming the
follicular glossitis of some writers.In another class of cases, most
frequently syphilitic or at least quasi-syphilitic, one or more whitish
circumscribed patches are seen on the tongue, resembling such as are
left after superficial cauterization with nitrate of silver.This
condition is described as psoriasis linguae.It is due to condensation
of layers of epithelium, which may become detached in a few days in
mass or in fragments, leaving the denuded mucous membrane red and the
papillae erect and somewhat swollen.When psoriasis of the tongue has existed for a long time, a further
change, and a more permanent one, takes place in the papillae and
epithelium.This condition has been denominated ichthyosis linguae.Superficial ulceration takes place at the psoriatic patches, and the
repair eventually excites such a proliferation of epithelium that it
becomes quite horny to the sight and to the touch.It spreads over a
much larger extent of surface than the original psoriasis, but, like
it, leaves the unaffected portions of the tongue in an apparently
normal condition.Both affections are usually bilateral, and the
patches or series of patches most frequently symmetrical or engaging
analogous vascular territory upon the two sides.Hulke[44] portions of the horny substance
were habitually sliced off with a razor.Microscopic examination
"showed colossal papillae; the indurated portion of the mass was
altogether epithelial, the lower cells being clear, transparent, and
natural, the middle ones granular, and the superficial layer felted
together into a dense opaque mass" (Clarke).[Footnote 44: _Medical Times_, Nov.Both of these affections are liable in about one-third of the cases to
terminate in epithelioma.Although the opinion generally entertained
classes all cases of psoriasis and ichthyosis linguae in the category
of syphilitic affections, there is reason to doubt its accuracy.Sangster[45] has drawn up a tabular statement of 44 cases, of which 1
only occurred in a female; 23 occurred in smokers, 12 being inveterate
smokers.In but 12 instances (8-1/3 per cent.)was there positive proof
or strong evidence of syphilis; 30 per cent.of the whole number
eventuated in epithelioma.Times and Gaz._, London, April 8, 1882, p.Vesicular glossitis, usually unilateral and most frequently
right-sided, has been described by Paget,[46] Stoker,[47] Barker,[48]
Hill,[49] and De Mussy,[50] and doubtless by others.[Footnote 46: _Lancet_, March 11, 1865; Clarke, _op.Sci._, May 1, 1876, p.[Footnote 48: _Lancet_, Nov.hebd._, June 22, 1883; _Med.{357} SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, TERMINATIONS, COMPLICATIONS,
AND SEQUELAE.--Dryness of the tongue, stiffness, heat, and pain--the
latter especially during movements of the organ in deglutition and in
articulation--are the prominent subjective symptoms of acute
superficial glossitis.There are rarely any marked symptoms of febrile
disturbance unless the disorder is about to undergo extension into
parenchymatous glossitis.DIAGNOSIS.--Redness of the tongue, prominence of the papillae, slight
enlargement, perhaps bearing impressions made by the teeth, and pain or
sense of impediment on movement, are the main diagnostic features of
superficial glossitis.Vesicles indicate the vesicular variety of superficial glossitis;
irregular whitish patches, the psoriatic variety; and hard, horny
patches with intervening fissures, the ichthyotic variety.A
superficial circumscribed glossitis attending the local ulcerations of
syphilis, tubercle, and epithelioma is differentiated by the clinical
history of the case.TREATMENT.--In ordinary cases the treatment described under catarrhal
stomatitis suffices, so far as local measures are concerned.The
gastritis or gastro-enteritis requires appropriate attention, as does
any systemic malady under which the patient may be laboring.Demulcent
and astringent lotions may be applied by douche, spray, or gargle.Local applications of weak solutions of iodine have been recommended.In cases of considerable severity, and especially when there is reason
to expect extension into the deeper tissues, superficial scarification
of the dorsum of the tongue is advisable.Ulcers are perhaps best treated locally by touching the edges daily
with the pencil of sulphate of copper.Any imperfect teeth in their
immediate vicinity to which the ulceration may be attributable should
be extracted or put in repair.De Mussy's case of eczema was cured
after five months' daily use of a large quantity of water-cress.DEFINITION.--An inflammation of the tongue said to be due to parasitic
vegetation.SYNONYMS.--Nigrities, Glossophytia, Black tongue.Under the term black tongue two different affections have been
described, the one an epidemic erysipelatous disorder to be mentioned
under parenchymatous glossitis, and the other, now to be mentioned, a
peculiar black pigmentation due to parasitic disease seated upon and
around the hypertrophied filiform papillae.The ordinary parasitic
vegetations found upon the tongue do not produce the affection in
question.HISTORY.--First described by H. Hyde Salter,[51] and then by Eulenburg,
it has been made the subject of observation by Raynaud,[52] Fereol and
others,[53] Lanceraux,[54] Dessois,[55] Hirz,[56] Pasquier,[57]
Moure,[58] and a few {358} others.Outside of French literature, little
had been written of it until very recently.[Footnote 51: Article "Tongue," _Encyclopedia of Anatomy and
Physiology_, London, 1849-52, vol.des Hop._, June 29, 1875.][Footnote 54: _Union Med._, March 20, 1877.][Footnote 55: _De la Langue noire [Glossophytie]_, Paris, 1878, 8vo, p.[Footnote 58: _Revue mensuelle de Laryngologie, etc._, Sept., 1883, p.ETIOLOGY.--The affection appears to be due to some fault of nutrition,
but the cause has not been determined.The fluids of the mouth always
exhibit an acid reaction.It has been seen chiefly in dyspeptics and
hypochondriacs, and has seemed in one instance (Moure) to have followed
the use of chlorate-of-potash lozenges.A case has been recorded by
Solomon Solis Cohen[59] in a <DW64> child the subject of congenital
syphilis.George Stoker[60] and G. Y. Broatch[61] have each
reported a case of long duration occurring in a painter.[Footnote 59: _The Polyclinic_, Philada., July, 1884, p.Journ._, March 29, 1884, p.602--said to be
first case recorded in England.][Footnote 61: _Ibid._, April 19, 1884.]PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--The disease is characterized by a
grayish-black or fully black discoloration on the upper surface of the
tongue, which gives it an aspect which recalls the normal appearance of
the tongue of the parrot and the giraffe, and an occasional appearance
of the organ in the ox, sheep, dog, cat, and some other animals.The
filiform papillae are enormously elongated, so that they closely
resemble hairs, and they are described by some writers as lying upon
the surface of the tongue in confusion like that of a field of wheat
thrown down by the wind.The individual papillae are surrounded with a
parasitic vegetable growth.Raynaud compared the microscopic spores in
his case to the microphyte of tinea tonsurans or that of herpes
circinatus.According to Malassez, they do not differ from those found
in the saburral tongue of the dyspeptic, and he considers that their
development is favored by their very arrest by the hypertrophied
papillae.Nevertheless, the subjects of this disease are not all
dyspeptics by any means.Dessois made culture-efforts to reproduce the
disease upon his own tongue, but failed to inoculate it.For detailed
description of the disease we cannot do better than refer the
interested reader to Dessois' monograph, from whose observations,
chiefly, it appears that the discoloration begins at the central
portion of the tongue, increases gradually in extent and intensity for
three or four days, and then gradually disappears by desquamation.The
tongue is very dry while the affection is at its height.Close
examination of the parts and microscopic inspection of papillae removed
for the purpose are said to show that the spores of the cryptogam are
first developed at the base of the papillae, separating them from each
other.The irritation produced by the parasite causes longitudinal
hypertrophy of the papilla, and the continued growth of the parasite
produces a muff-like envelopment of the papilla; the spores at the same
time becoming insinuated between the most superficial epithelial cells
and dislocating them, so that they maintain their position around the
axis of the papilla only by means of the intervening parasitic masses.The papilla continues to elongate and the cryptogam to increase, until
finally it invades nearly the entire length of the papilla.This entire
parasitic mass soon becomes detached, carrying with it the epithelial
cells under which it has become insinuated, and leaves the papilla
naked, save for a few cells remaining attached by their superior
borders.In the case observed by my brother, as in Mr.Stoker's and
Broatch's cases, microscopical examination of the black filaments
showed them to be composed of closely-packed epithelial cells,
overlapping one another, stained {359} brown, and decreasing in
intensity of color from the apex toward the base of the filament.In
some cells the nucleus was darker, and in others lighter, than the
surrounding protoplasm.The cryptogam, therefore, cannot always be
detected.Indeed, there seems reason to believe that the affection may
not be parasitic,[62] although the prominence given to this feature by
French writers apparently warrants its being so considered.There may
be two kinds of black tongue--one non-parasitic.[Footnote 62: Hutchinson, _The Medical Press_, p.SYMPTOMS.--There are no special subjective symptoms.The objective
symptoms are the peculiar dark or black discoloration of the upper
surface of the tongue and the excessively elongated filiform papillae.DIAGNOSIS.--The chief diagnostic feature is the black discoloration of
the tongue which has given the name black tongue to the disease.Discrimination is requisite from discoloration by food or medicine.PROGNOSIS.--This is favorable, the condition subsiding under treatment,
and sometimes spontaneously, though liable to recurrence.In some
instances the condition becomes chronic.TREATMENT.--The indication is to endeavor to favor desquamation of the
papilla by means of potassium chloride or sodium borate, and to
administer alkalines, so as to render the saliva alkaline and
unfavorable for the development of the parasite.It is recommended, in
addition, to scrape the tongue with a spatula, and to douche it with a
spray of mercuric chloride, 1:500.Attention to the general health is
requisite, especially in dyspeptics and hypochondriacs.In the case of
the <DW64> child above alluded to the discoloration of the tongue
finally disappeared under the systemic use of potassium iodide, without
topical treatment, although repeated recurrences took place at varying
intervals.DEFINITION.--An inflammation of the tongue involving its substance as
well as the mucous membrane.SYNONYMS.--Idiopathic glossitis.Erectile
glossitis (Salter), Glossomegistus (Sauvages), Paraglossia.HISTORY.--Albeit a comparatively infrequent disease, especially at the
present day, numerous cases and collections of cases are on record from
very early times; and the affection seems to have attracted the
attention of medical writers ever since.Hippocrates, Galen, Aretaeus,
Celsus, Aetius, Avicenna, Forestus, Riviere, Schenkins, Sauvages,
Vogel, van Swieten, are referred to by more modern writers as having
described the disease.Louis, De la Malle, Lassus, J. P. Frank, Jn.Frank, Fleming,[63] Clarke, and Bryant may be cited as the most
prominent recent observers.[Footnote 63: _Dublin Journ.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing and Exciting Causes.--Glossitis is sometimes
idiopathic, sometimes deuteropathic, and sometimes traumatic.Impaired
health from over-fatigue or from exhaustive disease may be regarded as
a predisposing cause in the presence of the causes which more
frequently give rise to traumatic glossitis.Sudden or prolonged
exposure to atmospheric changes, to cold and moisture, as when working
in damp and wet localities, is often the apparent determining cause in
{360} both the idiopathic and deuteropathic varieties.In many
instances occurring in this way it is found that the tongue has long
been subjected to mechanical irritation from jagged teeth.Idiopathic glossitis occurs at all ages, but has been supposed by some
observers to be more frequent in scrofulous subjects.It occurs in the
apparently healthy only after severe exposure to wet and cold, and in
convalescents from acute febrile diseases usually after some moderate
exposure to a draught of air or change of temperature.It appears to be
more imminent after influenza (Moller, Smee, Graves, Salter) than after
other febrile disorders.It has occasionally been caused by chewing
acrid plants, some of them food-plants, some of them medicinal.In the
list have been included celery, bilberries, Daphne mezereum and Daphne
laureola, aconite, and tobacco.It has been known to follow the eating
of shellfish (Watson, Salter).Deuteropathic glossitis has occurred during the course of scarlatina,
variola, epidemic erysipelas (black tongue), scorbutus, enteric fever,
glanders, septicaemia from various causes, rheumatism, diffuse
inflammation of the connective tissue of the cervico-mental region,
herpes, syphilis, ptyalism, mercurial and other varieties of toxaemic
stomatitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, gastritis, and epithelioma of the
tongue.It appears to be occasionally endemic (Fleming[64]), and is
occasionally epidemic (Reil[65]).In the United States it prevailed
extensively during an epidemic of erysipelas that overran the country
from 1842 to 1846, inclusive, and was frequently reported in the
American medical journals of that period under the name of black
tongue.In some localities more than half the cases terminated fatally,
sometimes within two or three days, more frequently about the eighth or
tenth day, and occasionally still later.Traumatic glossitis arises
from a number of causes.Among these may be mentioned the irritation of
jagged edges of broken and carious teeth; wounds from firearms and
other weapons; wounds from splinters of toothpicks, spiculae of bone,
broken pipe-stems, pins, needles, nails, slate-pencils, and other
pointed things inadvertently placed in the mouth; wounds from the teeth
during epileptic seizures and other convulsive paroxysms; contact of
the tongue with cold iron in cold weather; the inspiration of very hot
air, as in burning buildings; burns, scalds, scalding beverages; acrid
and corrosive substances introduced by design or accident; incautious
use of tobacco in bulk, and of ammonia; incautious cauterization;
concealed calculi in the tongue; concealed bulbs of teeth; rupture of
the lingual frenum; the bites and stings of venomous insects, as the
wasp, the hornet, and the bee.For many years writers have referred to
a case reported by Dupont to the Parisian Academy of Medicine which
followed a young man's attempt to win a wager that he would bite into
the body of a living toad, and to two fatal cases reported by Ambrose
Pare from drinking a vinous infusion of sage which was subsequently
found to have been impregnated with the saliva of the toad.[Footnote 65: _Memorabilia Clinica_ (_Dict.SYMPTOMS, COURSE, DURATION, TERMINATIONS, COMPLICATIONS, AND
SEQUELAE.--In acute parenchymatous glossitis the local symptoms often
appear quite suddenly, usually unilaterally, even when they become
bilateral subsequently, and they increase in severity with great
rapidity.{361} These symptoms are, at first, distinct sensations of
heat and tumefaction in the tongue, quickly followed by stiffness and
considerable impediment in its movements, as though it were numb and
weighted down.In cases where the glossitis is an extension from
tonsillitis, these sensations begin in the root of the organ.They
commence at the root likewise, in most instances following exposure to
severe cold and moisture.In other instances the extremity of the organ
is affected first.In cases resulting from local injury the symptoms
commence at the injured portion.The local symptoms are sometimes
preceded by rigor, followed by fever, cephalalgia, and pains in the
neck and occiput.Examined at this time, the tongue is seen to be
swollen and studded with indentations due to the pressure sustained
from the teeth.At first the surface is punctated and red; subsequently
it becomes brownish or decidedly brown.Although the organ may remain
moist for several hours, it eventually becomes excessively dry, and
supports a thick adhesive coating of mucus and epithelium.In a few hours, sometimes as few as two or three, the entire organ may
become involved in the inflammation, enlarging to such an extent as to
keep the lower jaw depressed, to fill almost the entire oral cavity or
to quite fill it, and to project like a tumor beyond the teeth and the
lips (Fig.In exceptional cases the enlargement of the tongue has
been so great as to produce dislocation of the lower jaw.The soft
palate is lifted up and the epiglottis often pressed down.The latter
condition has been known to threaten suffocation.In this condition the
patient cannot breathe through the mouth, widely as it may be forced
open, and has great difficulty in breathing through the nose.Articulation is impeded or
impossible, and deglutition difficult or impracticable.The tumefaction
and congestion are often continuous into the floor of the mouth and the
parts adjacent.The sublingual and submaxillary glands often become
swollen, tense, and painful; and the entire neck is sometimes swollen
to such a degree as to exert injurious pressure on the jugular veins.The tongue is very hard to the touch, almost or quite immovable, and is
the seat of burning heat and pain.The pain often extends from the root
of the tongue along the glosso-pharyngeal folds into the pharynx, and
thence by way of the Eustachian tubes into the ears, the folds just
named being very much upon the stretch.When the tongue protrudes far
out of the mouth it becomes excessively dry, fissured, sanious, and
excoriated, or even ulcerated at points where it is subjected to the
pressure of the teeth.It is covered with dark viscid secretions, which
often extend beyond it and over the entire aperture of the mouth.The
epithelial coating often undergoes desquamation, and then the organ
becomes exquisitely sensitive to the contact of food, water, or even
the air.This desquamation is sometimes in mass, in sheets peeling off
like a pseudo-membrane.As a rule, the face is turgid and its expression anxious; the
conjunctiva suffused, respiration impeded, and sleep disturbed or
impracticable.Saliva dribbles externally, often in considerable
quantity.The {362} odor from the mouth becomes quite fetid from
decomposition of the retained products of secretion.Thirst is usually
intense, though immoderate only in some cases.Cough is more or less
constant and quite exhausting.This and the dribbling of saliva
contribute with the dyspnoea to prevent sleep.The pulse is strong and quick at first, 100-120 per minute,
and there is often marked throbbing of the temporal and carotid
arteries.The skin is hot and dry at first, but cold sweat subsequently
accumulates upon the face and neck as the dyspnoea increases.The
impediment to the return of blood to the heart from the head causes
cerebral congestion, drowsiness, and even threatens asphyxia.In other
cases there is intense cephalalgia, nervous irritability, restlessness,
and even delirium.The symptoms sometimes reach their acme in rather less than forty-eight
hours, and then gradually subside.More frequently they continue on
into the third or fourth day.Occasionally they are protracted as long
as the fifth or sixth or even the eighth day, rarely longer.Resolution
occasionally takes place within twenty-four hours, however (van
Swieten), though more frequently occurring from the fifth to the
seventh day.In some instances remittance or intermittence has been
noted, the cause therefor not being apparent, although attributed to
malaria.Resolution of the inflammatory process is usually indicated by the
gradual return of moisture on the tongue and progressive detumescence
of the organ, accompanied by subsidence of the redness, heat, and pain.Increased secretion of saliva, general perspiration, or diuresis
sometimes marks the cessation of the pyrexia.Should the process be going to terminate in suppuration, the local
distress increases, markedly about the end of the week.The pains
become lancinating, and associated with throbbing of the lingual
blood-vessels.The swelling becomes prominent and softer at some one
point, although the sense of fluctuation is not very perceptible on
palpation, and finally the abscess bursts through the surface, unless
previously incised, and discharges a fetid pus.Suppuration always
involves a prolonged duration of the attack.In rare instances glossitis terminates in gangrene of the tongue,
circumscribed or diffuse.This result is indicated by adynamic symptoms
on the part of the constitution, and by the livid appearance of the
parts undergoing mortification.The hemorrhage following extensive
sloughs from gangrene has been fatal in some instances.Fleming[66] calls prominent attention to a complication of glossitis,
of which he alludes to several examples.This is "an inflammation,
circumscribed or diffused, originating in the loose areolar tissue
between the genio-hyo-glossi muscles, and first manifesting itself by a
train of symptoms identical with those of ordinary glossitis, but soon
characterized by peculiar features."These features comprise fulness
under the chin like that dubbed double chin, pressure upon which,
especially near the hyoid bone, being very painful; and suppuration,
which, circumscribed or diffuse, burrows most freely toward the base of
the tongue.Chronic induration of the tongue sometimes remains unilateral, although
the acute disease has not been unilateral.{363} PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--It has been advanced that in
idiopathic glossitis from cold the engorgement of the vessels is
probably a consequence of vaso-dilator influence of the
glosso-pharyngeal nerve for the base of the organ, and of the
chorda-tympani for the anterior portion.An instance of herpetic
glossitis from probable irritation of the chorda-tympani nerve by an
aural polypus (Berkely Hill[67]) seems to lend some force to this
opinion.However engendered, there is a rapid distension of the organ
by blood, followed by infiltration of fibrin and serum into the
intermuscular connective tissue and into the planes of the connective
tissue separating the muscular fasciculi.In some instances
degeneration of muscular fibre has been observed.There is great
increase in the thickness of the coats of epithelium, beneath which the
mucous membrane is red and its papillae erect.This coating sometimes
peels off like a false membrane.In cases extending from tonsillitis
the base of the tongue suffers most.The disease usually terminates by resolution, although a slight amount
of hypertrophy, unilateral or bilateral, sometimes persists, and
occasionally to a marked degree (Wells).In instances much less
frequent suppuration ensues, usually in debilitated subjects or in
cases due to traumatism or in cases inefficiently treated.The
suppurative process is usually circumscribed and unilateral, and the
abscess points most frequently just beneath the side of the tongue;
sometimes, however, the pointing takes place at the dorsum, sometimes
at the tip.The pressure of the teeth seems to be the provocative cause
of the disposition to point at the edge of the tongue.Gangrene is an infrequent result of glossitis.The pressure of the
teeth, strangulating the organ at the oral outlet, seems to occasion
the failure of nutrition in instances where it occurs.The losses are
ordinarily insignificant, though appearing quite extensive while the
tongue remains swollen.Sometimes large portions drop off, and fatal
hemorrhage has resulted (Frank) in consequence.From the nature of the
organ the parts separate more readily than in almost any other
instance.Gangrenous abscess, ensuing even from very slight causes,
such as a wound with the head of a barleycorn (Ranking[68]), sometimes
proves fatal.In those cases of diffuse inflammation of the interconnective tissue of
the genio-hyo-glossi muscles Fleming states that the
suppuration--which, whether circumscribed or diffuse, burrows toward
the root of the tongue--absolutely dissects its extrinsic muscles and
destroys their functions; ultimately injuring the periosteum and laying
bare the inside of the inferior maxilla in the vicinity of their
attachments.When an incision is made to the parts through the
integument, the muscles will be found on palpation flabby and detached,
and their interstices filled with purulent matter, sometimes very
fetid.DIAGNOSIS.--These is no difficulty in the diagnosis, except in the
early stage of such examples as are attributed to metastatic gout and
rheumatism.The subsidence of the peculiar pains elsewhere, and the
onset of pain in the tongue, would lead to the inference that a
glossitis of this kind {364} was in progress.The acuteness of the
tumefaction would distinguish it from hypertrophy of the tongue on the
one hand, and from the tumefaction attending malignant disease on the
other.Cystoma of the tongue has sometimes been mistaken for abscess due to
glossitis; but even here the history of the case should serve in most
instances as a satisfactory factor for the differential diagnosis.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis depends upon the gravity of the local
symptoms and the activity of the treatment.A case left to itself will
be likely to terminate fatally within five or six days.Death, indeed,
has been known to take place within forty-eight hours, even in cases
submitted to treatment.On the whole, however, the prognosis should be
regarded as favorable in the absence of specially lethal complications.Even suppuration adds little gravity to the prognosis, the structure of
the organ being but little favorable to accumulations of purulent
material.Should an abscess become gangrenous, however, the prognosis
becomes grave at once, as it in the presence of gangrene from pressure
or other cause.Should the patient survive losses by gangrene, there
may be permanent impairment in articulation.TREATMENT.--Superficial glossitis, as a rule, merely requires active
purgation, with the topical use of cold emollient mouth-washes
containing mucilage of slippery elm, quince-seed, or the like, to which
detergents, such as alum and borax, may be advantageously added in the
proportion of five grains to the ounce.In cases resisting this mild
treatment topical applications of glycerite of tannin twice or thrice a
day are often serviceable.Parenchymatous glossitis demands the most active antiphlogistic
treatment.If the case be seen at an early stage of the process, before
the tumefaction of the tongue has become so great as to fill the mouth
and interfere with swallowing, a saline purge--say salts and
senna--containing some tartar emetic can be advantageously administered
to begin with.Following this, tartar emetic may be continued in small
doses every two or three hours, associated with small doses of tincture
of aconite-root (minim j-iij), according to the condition of the pulse
and the effect of medication.Should this treatment fail to produce
prompt amelioration in the local symptoms, or should the tongue be
considerably swollen when the case comes under care, free leeching
should be applied from the hyoid bone to the angle of the jaw on each
side, including the region of the hyoid bone (fifteen to twenty-five
Spanish leeches).This should be followed by emollient cataplasms,
reaching from ear to ear, to favor continuous hemorrhagic oozings from
the leech-bites.The internal antiphlogistic treatment is indicated
just the same, and if not administrable by the mouth may be
administered by the bowel; the nauseant and depressent effects of the
tartar emetic and aconite being maintained by hypodermatic injection.Leeching the inflamed tongue itself is said to be often prompter in
producing detumescence of the organ than leeching exteriorly, but the
leech-bites are apt to add to the local irritation; besides which, the
mouth is so filled by the swollen tongue as to leave little more than
the tip accessible to the leeches without danger of losing control of
them.Venesection from the arm, the jugular vein, or from vessels
elsewhere is no longer much in vogue, it being doubtful whether general
venesection is more useful than local bleedings.Debility, whether
presenting originally or as the result of withdrawal of blood and other
{365} antiphlogistic measures, may be met by the systematic use of
tincture of chloride of iron and of quinia.Severe cases demand one or more longitudinal incisions on each side of
the raphe of the tongue, deep enough to reach nearly halfway into the
substance of the organ and carried from base to tip.Cases are on
record in which the patients themselves had in their despair cut into
their tongues in order to obtain relief from their local sufferings,
and had in this way rescued their own lives by the means most
appropriate for the purpose (Camerarius, Lusitanus[69]).When the mouth
is filled by the tongue, it is necessary to insert the knife on the
flat until the base of the tongue is reached, and then to turn it and
make the cuts as indicated.Copious bleeding usually follows these
incisions, often followed by marked diminution in the volume of the
organ.Deep as these cuts appear when made, they become quite shallow
before the organ has shrunk to its normal volume.Bleeding from the
ranular veins, recommended by some practitioners in preference to
incisions into the organ, is often impracticable on account of the
tumefaction preventing access to them.If severe hemorrhage takes place from divided vessels, the vessels may
be subjected to torsion, which is the preferable mode of management, or
to searing with some form of the incandescent cautery (hot iron,
electric cautery, Paquelin's thermo-cautery).Astringent and chemical
styptics are of little use.The method of searing is open to the
objection that secondary hemorrhage may ensue on detachment of the
eschars, but this accident is not likely to happen under circumstances
at all favorable.In localized or circumscribed glossitis the incision to be made should
interest the swollen portion only.Should the tongue swell again, the incisions may be repeated.Whether
the tongue require incision or not, it is good treatment to have the
patient inhale vapor from hot vinegar, alcohol, or cologne spirits to
render the parts more comfortable.Washes of weak detergent solutions
containing potassium nitrate, sodium borate, or ammonium chloride may
be used by syringe or spray to cleanse the parts and promote detachment
of the epithelial coatings on the tongue and interior of the mouth, the
accumulations of which are sometimes matters of great annoyance.The
drug last mentioned exerts in addition a special action on the
inflammatory process which is often quite serviceable.I have seen good
results follow the prolonged use of sprays of an aqueous solution of
ammonium chloride (Stuver), one drachm to the ounce, from the
steam-spray apparatus, continued for fifteen to twenty minutes at a
time and repeated every two or three hours.In many instances the patient is unable to take food by the mouth.The
best plan under such circumstances is to pass a catheter into the
stomach through the larger of the two nasal passages, and retain it in
position unless its presence interferes too much with respiration.Milk
and stimulus can then be poured into the stomach from time to time with
the aid of a funnel passed into the outer opening of the tube, which
should be kept corked during the intervals when retained in position.This failing or impracticable, it will be necessary to nourish the
patient with enemata.On the appearance of abscess the same should be freely laid open.In
cases of hesitation, the true nature of the presumable abscess can be
{366} determined beforehand with the exploring-needle.The pus from an
abscess of this kind is rarely copious and is usually fetid.It would
be good practice to distend the sac after discharge of pus by injecting
into it a solution of carbolic acid.In resisting or advanced cases of suppurative inflammation of the
planes of connective tissue between the muscles at the lower portion of
the root of the tongue, Fleming recommends a free incision under the
chin in the middle line, through skin and fasciae and on through the
raphe of the muscles themselves.In cases of gangrene, washes, douches, or sprays of carbolic acid,
chlorinated soda, hydrogen peroxide, or potassium permanganate are
indicated to relieve fetor; while the most supporting treatment by
mouth or otherwise is requisite on general principles.Chronic glossitis, like acute glossitis, may be superficial or
parenchymatous.Superficial chronic glossitis is usually confined to the papillae of
the tongue, territories of which, so to speak, are mapped out on the
surface of the tongue, separated by furrows reaching to the basement
mucous membrane.In pronounced cases the dividing furrows are quite
deep, giving the organ a mamelonnated appearance, and they penetrate
into the mucous membrane (dissecting glossitis, Wunderlich), which
becomes subjected to great irritation by the retention of articles of
food in the fissures.Demarquay[70] has recorded a case of this kind in
which, to relieve the intense sufferings with which the patient had
been plagued for a number of years, he had been forced to amputate the
anterior half of the organ--an operation which succeeded thoroughly.In another group of cases the surface of the swollen tongue is mapped
out in small ovoid patches, smooth, red, and glossy, from which the
papillae have become separated without regeneration.Sometimes chronic
glossitis presents as an aphthous inflammation.Sometimes superficial
ulcers occur upon the dorsum of the tongue, irritable, indolent, and
indurated.ETIOLOGY.--Chronic superficial glossitis is in rare instances a sequel
of the acute form of the disease.Usually, however, it is encountered
as a chronic affection from the outset, so to speak, generally as a
result of long-continued irritation in connection with dyspepsia and
other gastric and gastro-intestinal disorders.It is frequently
encountered in subjects of chronic alcoholism.The superficial ulcerations often occur at the sides of the organ,
usually in some of the depressions formed by the contact of the teeth.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The symptoms are those due to a consciousness that the
tongue is too large, with occasional pain in taking acid and succulent
food.{367} PATHOLOGY.--The pathology does not differ from that of chronic
inflammations elsewhere.The apparent obliteration of the papillae in
some cases is due to a filling up of the intervening furrows by
permanent deposit of new-formed cells.The excoriations and superficial
ulcerations are most frequently due to disturbance of nutrition by
pressure.DIAGNOSIS.--The affection may be confounded with syphilitic disease of
the tongue or with papillary epithelioma, but the history of the case,
the resistance to antisyphilitic treatment, and the negative results
from microscopic examination of fragments of tissue removed for the
purpose, serve to establish the diagnosis in cases of doubt.It must
not be forgotten, however, that many cases of epithelioma begin in
chronic glossitis, non-specific as well as syphilitic.PROGNOSIS.--Though not threatening to life, the prognosis of the
disease itself is bad.It resists treatment, being, in fact, a
complication of some obstinate or intractable gastric or
gastro-intestinal disorder, or an evidence of constitutional dyscrasia.Cure may be expected in recent cases, following cure of the dyspepsia
or other malady upon which the chronic glossitis may be dependent.TREATMENT.--Care to cleanse the tongue by washes, douches, or wet
cloths after each meal, in order to remove particles of food which may
have become impacted in the anfractuosities of the organ, is important
in order to avoid additional sources of irritation.Astringents and caustics of various kinds have been extensively
employed, carefully applied to the floors of the fissures, but it is
very rarely that any benefit ensues.Demarquay[71] reports good results
in one case of dissecting papillary glossitis from biweekly
applications of equal parts of chromic acid and water.Butlin reports
good results from chromic acid (1:10).Careful attention to the gastro-intestinal functions, and a thorough
change of diet, such as the adoption of the milk cure and the like,
with due attention to bathing and outdoor exercise, comprise the most
rational method of constitutional treatment.Should the secretions of
the mouth give an acid reaction with litmus-paper, alkalies are
strongly indicated, topically and systemically.Avoidance of alcohol in
all forms is often absolutely essential.Chronic Parenchymatous Glossitis.The chronic parenchymatous form of glossitis is usually circumscribed.When diffuse or general it has usually been a sequel of acute
parenchymatous glossitis.It is not a painful disorder, and as a rule
is not associated with constitutional manifestations.The circumscribed
tumefaction usually presents as an induration upon some portion of the
side of the tongue, being most frequently directly or indirectly due to
irritation sustained from a jagged tooth.Ordinary sensibility is much
diminished, and sometimes the sense of taste likewise.Sometimes the
indurated mass is ulcerated superficially.The enlargement of the organ
is not sufficient to keep it outside the mouth.Sometimes, indeed, the
tongue, {368} as a whole, has undergone atrophy, unilateral or
bilateral.Chronic abscess of the tongue sometimes supervenes, chiefly
in scrofulous subjects.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--This consists merely in interstitial
connective-tissue hyperplasia, with atrophy of muscular fibres from
compression.SYMPTOMS.--In addition to the objective symptoms of induration or
circumscribed tumefaction, the subjective symptoms may be summed up as
general hypersensitiveness to sapid and acrid substances; diminished
tactile sensibility at the part affected; slight stinging sensations
while the parts are at rest; occasional or continuous local pains; and
a sense of impediment in the movements of the tongue in articulation
and even in deglutition.DIAGNOSIS.--Inspection reveals the swelling, and palpation its
induration.In addition, the adjacent source of irritation, a jagged
tooth or two, is seen.Abscess is recognized by special prominence at
one point of the swelling and by indistinct sense of fluctuation.Cystic tumor is liable to be mistaken for abscess, but the
exploring-needle will solve the difficulty.Circumscribed induration
may be confounded with tumor or with epithelioma.PROGNOSIS.--This is good, provided the source of irritation can be
removed or suppressed.TREATMENT.--The first element in the treatment is the removal or repair
of any offending tooth, and next attention to any underlying malady,
constitutional or local.Weak solutions of iodine locally are said to
be of service.Their walls
should be distended with solutions of carbolic acid or be touched with
solutions of iodine, silver nitrate, or cupric sulphate, to promote
reparative inflammation.Glossanthrax (Carbuncle of the Tongue, Malignant Pustule of the
Tongue).This is a special variety of gangrenous ulcerative glossitis,
presenting as an integral phenomenon of a disease peculiar to
slaughterers, who become infected from diseased cattle, usually by
means of the knife, which they are sometimes in the habit of holding in
the mouth (Heyfelder and others).It has been described chiefly by
Heyfelder,[72] Duhamel, Chavarrien d'Audebert, Felix Plata, Breschet et
Finot, and Maisonneuve.[73]

[Footnote 72: _Med.Vereins Zeitung_, 1834.][Footnote 73: _Des Tumeurs de la Langue_, Paris, 1848, These de
Concours.]The period of incubation occupies about one day.The tongue then
undergoes rapid tumefaction and becomes the seat of intense pain.The
points of inoculation become hard, covered with vesicles containing
bloody serum, which blacken, rupture, and leave dark, livid, gangrenous
patches of ulceration.Profound cachexia rapidly ensues under typhoid
manifestations, and death may result in less than twenty-four hours,
though usually not until sixty hours.The prognosis, therefore, is of
the gravest character.The chief treatment consists in thorough cauterization of the
inoculated {369} points by means of the actual cautery, followed by
deep incisions into the body of the tongue if the glossitis be severe.Apart from the ulcerations of the tongue incidentally mentioned in the
foregoing pages, there are two forms of ulcer, both of sufficiently
frequent occurrence in ordinary practice to require special
description: these are the tuberculous ulcer and the syphilitic ulcer.Tuberculous Ulcer of the Tongue.--Tuberculous ulceration of the tongue
occurs in a certain number of cases of advanced tuberculosis of the
lungs or of the lungs and larynx.It has even been asserted to precede
pulmonary tuberculosis.It is most frequently observed upon the upper
surface of one side of the organ, sometimes at the tip, sometimes
farther back, and usually on the same side upon which the disease is
most advanced in the lungs or the larynx.It is often associated with
previous or subsequent tuberculous ulcerations of the palate or of the
pharynx or contiguous structures.It gradually extends, and rarely if
ever heals.It is characterized by a superficial excavation, and by
being covered with a grayish detritus entirely different from the
purulent layers seen on other kinds of ulcers.When of long standing
its base is indurated, and this may give rise at first to suspicion of
squamous-celled carcinoma.Small yellowish elevations are sometimes
observed in the reddened mucous membrane around the ulcer--an
appearance deemed sometimes characteristic of the tuberculous nature of
the lesion (Trelat[74]).de Med._, 1869, or _Arch.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Nodular tuberculous infiltration takes
place beneath the mucous membrane, which becomes elevated in small,
semiglobular, yellow protuberances of one or more millimeters in
diameter, around which the mucous membrane is red and swollen.The
epithelium becomes shed without undergoing renewal, and thus a little
point of superficial ulceration remains.When several such points are
sufficiently contiguous they coalesce into a single ulcer of irregular
contour, which gradually spreads without much other change.SYMPTOMS.--In addition to the superficial ulceration described, and in
addition to the constitutional and local symptoms of advanced
tuberculosis of the lungs or lungs and larynx, as may be, there are no
special symptoms attending the tuberculous ulcer of the tongue.Saliva
is sometimes secreted in excess, but that is not characteristic.There
is little pain and little impediment to the movements of the tongue
until the disease has advanced.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence in a tuberculous subject of a unilateral,
irregular ulcer of the tongue surmounted with grayish detritus and
surrounded by reddened edges, should suffice for the recognition of its
presumptive tuberculous character.It is most difficult perhaps to
differentiate from a small ulcerated squamous-celled carcinoma, and the
two indeed sometimes coexist, rendering the discrimination extremely
difficult until the advanced progress of the carcinoma places the
diagnosis beyond doubt.{370} In the early stages, however, it is distinguished by lack of the
peculiar lancinating pains of carcinoma, which, however, are not
invariably attendant, and by lack of secondary involvements of the
cervical lymphatic glands.At all times it should be distinguishable
from the carcinomatous ulcer by lack of the fungus-like appearance of
the bed of the ulcer which is usual in carcinoma.From syphilitic ulcer it is distinguishable by the history of the case,
its tendency to be unilateral, and its failure to respond to
antisyphilitic treatment.Syphilitic ulceration of the tongue may
represent the primary, the secondary, or the tertiary manifestation of
the specific disease.The former will not be discussed in this
connection.Secondary ulcers occur on the upper surface of the tongue, most
frequently at the anterior portion, as fissures, usually longitudinal,
the floors of which are ulcerated.They occur likewise at the sides,
tip, and even lower surface of the organ.They are often associated
with secondary ulceration in the mucous membrane of some portion of the
mouth.They are quite painful, especially to the contact of pungent
articles of food.Some ulcers occur as simple superficial excoriations
at some portion of the edge or tip of the tongue, giving little
evidence of any specific character.Tertiary ulcers are usually sequelae of gummata.They are much deeper
than secondary ulcers, sanious at bottom, often serpiginous in
configuration, and apt to extend in depth as well as in superficies,
sometimes penetrating through and through the organ.They are most
frequent in the very central portion of the tongue, or are
symmetrically disposed on either side of it.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of tuberculous ulceration is bad, both as
regards tongue and patient.TREATMENT.--The only topical treatment offering any prospect of local
cure is the bodily destruction of the ulcer and the surrounding tissue
with caustics, the best of which are the incandescent metals, or else
the excision, with the incandescent knife, of a portion of the tongue
comprising all the affected tissue.In the former case the tuberculous
process often reappears about the cicatrix; in the latter, at some more
distant point.Tincture of iodine locally, detergent washes, and the like, often
secure a certain amount of comfort as palliatives.The same indications
prevail as in simple chronic glossitis, superficial and deep-seated.Iodoform locally is of benefit, inasmuch as it relieves pain and
reduces collateral inflammation, but it is powerless to arrest the
onward march of the ulcerative process.DEFINITION.--A loss of blood from the mouth.SYNONYM.--Stomatorrhagia.ETIOLOGY.--Hemorrhage from the mouth is usually a symptom of some
disease or injury of the mouth, tongue, gums, palate, pharynx, or nose.It may, however, occur as one of the phenomena of scorbutus or of
haemophilia.It is said to occur occasionally as a vicarious {371}
menstruation.It may be slight, so as barely to tinge the saliva, or it
may be profuse enough to terminate fatally.Between these extremes
there is an infinity of gradations.As a result of disease it may be
caused by simple hyperaemia of the mucous membrane, by rupture of
dilated blood-vessels, by ulceration, by gangrene.As a result of
injury it may arise from wounds of various kinds, accidental or
self-inflicted.The gums are the most frequent source of slight hemorrhage from the
mouth.The pharynx, probably, is the next most frequent seat.Hemorrhage from the tongue, cheeks, lips, and palate is usually
traumatic or the result of ulceration.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, COMPLICATIONS, TERMINATIONS, AND
SEQUELAE.--The symptoms of hemorrhage from the mouth are the presence
of blood in the saliva or in the mouth itself, or in the expelled
products of expectoration, emesis, or catharsis, for sometimes the
blood is swallowed, and occasionally inhaled into the air-passages.The
course, duration, complications, and terminations of stomatorrhagia
depend upon its cause.Prolonged hemorrhage will entail anaemia;
profuse hemorrhage may terminate fatally.DIAGNOSIS.--Careful examination of the mouth, tongue, pharynx, and
posterior nares, both by direct and by reflected light, may be
necessary to discover the source of the hemorrhage and discriminate it
from haemoptysis and haematemesis.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis will depend upon the nature of the cause, its
susceptibility of arrest, the quantity of blood lost, and the general
health of the patient.It is grave, as a rule, in the subjects of
haemophilia, as there is a constitutional malnutrition of the
blood-vessel system which cannot be counteracted.TREATMENT.--Ergot or oil of turpentine internally, astringent
mouth-washes, and recumbency constitute the main features in treatment.DEFINITION.--Departure from the physiological processes concerned in
the eruption of teeth, entailing certain local and systemic disorders.SYNONYMS.--Dentitio difficilis, Pathological dentition, Odontitis
infantum.The correct comprehension of the subject will be facilitated by
considering its etiology, pathology, and symptomatology in connection.Indeed, morbid dentition has been assigned so prominent a part in the
etiology of various affections elsewhere discussed that a satisfactory
consideration of its own causation would require the repetition of much
that belongs more appropriately under other titles.While in some
infants the teeth erupt so quietly that the parents are astonished by
the accidental discovery of their presence above the gum, few children
escape a greater or less amount of local and constitutional disturbance
while passing through the process of dentition.So severe may these
disturbances become that, according to the mortality-tables of London,
as cited by West,[75] teething was assigned as the cause of death of
4.8 per cent.of all children dying under one year old, and of 7.3 per
cent.of those who died between the {372} ages of twelve months and
three years.It is furthermore well recognized that the period of
greatest mortality among children is that of the first dentition.Associating these facts, we see, on the one hand, that while disorders
of dentition may act a causative part in the production of systemic
diseases or aggravate morbid processes due to ordinary causes, on the
other hand they may be but one expression of some profound
constitutional disturbance; or both aberration in the eruption of the
teeth and systemic disease may be dependent upon the influence of
dyscrasia.The period is one of active organic processes; the child is
becoming fitted for a new manner of existence; and change and
development are going on throughout nervous, vascular, respiratory, and
alimentary systems.Hence there exists peculiar susceptibility to
morbid influences; and any process, physiological or pathological, once
started, goes through its stages with excessive energy.[Footnote 75: _Lectures on the Diseases of Infancy and Childhood_,
Philada., 1860, p.Although the periods of normal eruption of the deciduous teeth vary
within extensive limits, and an invariable order in eruption is not
observed in all subjects, it may be stated as a rule that the lower
central incisors are cut in quick succession about the seventh month.Some infants get these teeth during the fourth month (Vogel), and
others have to wait until the tenth or eleventh month, some even
longer.A few weeks after the appearance of these lower
incisors--within fourteen days in some subjects, not until nine or more
weeks in others--the central incisors of the upper jaw are cut, and its
lateral incisors shortly afterward, followed in their turn by the
lateral incisors of the lower jaw.In some instances--the majority,
according to Vogel--the eruption of the inferior lateral incisors is
delayed until the anterior molars are about to become exposed, usually
from the twelfth to the fifteenth month.Sometimes the upper molars are
cut before the lower, sometimes after them.From the sixteenth to the
twentieth, or even the twenty-fourth, month the canine teeth are cut,
and the four posterior molars follow between the twentieth and
thirtieth months, rarely delayed until the thirty-sixth
month,--completing the process of the first dentition.From this it will be seen that the teeth erupt as a rule in pairs, and
that a longer or shorter interval of repose takes place between the
eruption of successive pairs.Variations from the usual order beyond the limits noted above may be
considered abnormal.Numerous cases are on record both of precipitate
and of tardy dentition.Tanner cites from Haller nineteen examples in
which one or more of the central incisors have been found through the
gums at birth, and have had to be removed to prevent injury to the
mother's nipple; from Crump, a case of full dentition at birth,
reported to the Virginia Society of Dentists; and from Ashburner, a
case of a child beginning to cut its first tooth, an incisor in the
upper jaw, during its twenty-third month, the infant being very
delicate, with a large head, tumid abdomen, and peculiarly small-sized
extremities.The same author quotes from Serres cases of persons
passing through several years of life--in one instance seven--before
cutting their first teeth, and mentions on the authority of Tomes that
Boxalli and Baumes have each recorded an instance in which the patient
reached old age without a single tooth having ever appeared.Rachitis is often the cause of tardy dentition, and in the subjects of
this {373} diathesis not alone are the teeth retarded in development,
but they decay early and even fall from their sockets.The first indication of approaching dentition is the markedly increased
production of saliva.For some little time after birth the salivary
glands seem to remain wholly inactive, and until the fourth or fifth
month of extra-uterine life they furnish very little secretion.The mouth is constantly filled with
saliva, which dribbles from its corners.To this continual slobbering,
wetting the garments covering the chest, has been attributed the
bronchial catarrh which attends some infants; and diarrhoea has
likewise been referred to the swallowing of large quantities of saliva,
acting as a mild laxative by virtue of its saline constituents.There may be no further manifestation until the seventh month, beyond
the broadening of the dental ridge.The exact position of each tooth is
usually indicated by greater prominence of the gum above it for some
time before it comes through, its entire outline being very distinct in
the upper central incisors.As the tooth approaches the surface the gum
becomes hot, shining, tense, and tumid, often painful.A slight amount
of catarrhal stomatitis is almost invariable.There is some elevation
of temperature; flushing of the cheek may occur; the child is restless,
peevish, and fretful; its sleep may be broken; it may cry out with
pain; its thumb, its fingers, any hard substance it can obtain, are
thrust into its mouth to allay the irritation of the gums.Otalgia is
not uncommon, and its occurrence may be inferred from the fact that the
child pokes its thumb or finger into the auditory canal or firmly
presses the tragus down over the external meatus.These may comprise
all the disordered manifestations, local or constitutional, or there
may be in addition loss of appetite, diarrhoea, vomiting, and the
various disturbances of reflex nervous origin to be alluded to later;
or, in the not common yet not rare instances already mentioned, there
may be absolutely no appreciable disturbance whatever.Sometimes a disposition exists to the formation of small aphthous
ulcerations on the tongue or elsewhere in the mouth, particularly at
the duplicature of the lip and the outer surface of the alveoli.Ulceration occurs most frequently at the tip of the tongue, probably
occasioned by friction from the new teeth.Usually there is a single
flat, round ulcer, its edges somewhat infiltrated, its bed covered with
a yellow lardaceous substance.It is extremely painful to the touch,
and thus every movement of the tongue occasions distress.It may heal
within a few days or continue for weeks.Ulcers in other situations are
less obstinate.Occasionally--and more frequently in debilitated subjects or those
exposed to unhygienic surroundings--there is an unusual amount of heat
and swelling of the gum, which becomes excessively tender, usually over
the summit of a particular tooth--in which case there will be a little
tumor-like elevation--or around a tooth which has partially pierced
through it.Small sloughy ulcerations form in this situation.There is
great pain, and usually high fever and severe gastro-intestinal
disorder.This affection, often difficult of cure, is termed by some
writers odontitis infantum.So severe is the pain, and so great its
tendency to aggravate constitutional disturbances, that life may be
placed in jeopardy, and even fatal results ensue.{374} Less severe than either of the forms just described, and yet far
more intense than the mild stomatitis which many authors regard as
physiological, is an aggravated form of catarrhal stomatitis sometimes
attendant upon morbid dentition, in which there is swelling of the
submaxillary glands and infiltration of the adjacent connective tissue.In this case there is usually considerable pyrexia.The constitutional disturbances of reflex nervous origin occasioned by
morbid dentition are of the most varied character, both in their degree
of gravity and in the manner and locality of their manifestation.Doubtless the extensive ramifications of the great vagus nerve, and its
connections both of origin and distribution with the exquisitely
sensitive fifth nerve, as well as with the facial nerve and with the
sympathetic system, will explain why the irritation should now be
seated in the gastro-intestinal tract, giving rise to vomiting and
diarrhoea (gastritis, gastro-enteritis, enteritis, entero-colitis,
cholera infantum); now in the respiratory tract, provoking cough more
or less severe, or even a well-marked bronchitis; now manifest itself
in various cutaneous eruptions (urticaria, eczema, impetigo, lichen,
prurigo, herpes); and now accumulate in the cerebro-spinal axis,
manifesting its presence by slight spasms (dysuria, muscular
twitchings), or discharging with terrific force in some of those
convulsive seizures which are the dread of mothers and the cause of
much anxiety to physicians.The mechanical causation of diarrhoea and bronchitis, insisted upon
particularly by Vogel, has already been alluded to.While this may be
one element, most certainly the nervous factor is too important to be
disregarded.Bronchitis, not attributable to ordinary exposure, occurs
coincidently with teething even in children who have been protected
against wetting of the chest; and the fact that more purely nervous
phenomena, and especially the dreaded brain symptoms, are usually
absent in children who have an excessive flow of saliva, and
particularly if there be also a moderate diarrhoea, would conduce to
the belief that nervous irritation, discharging itself in this manner,
does not accumulate in the centres.Doubts have been expressed whether dentition can give rise to
convulsions in perfectly healthy children, although its role as an
exciting cause in predisposed subjects is admitted (Hillier).That
dentition alone, in the absence of any other predisposing or exciting
influence, will provoke any of the disorders with which it is
associated may be doubted in view of the fact already cited, that in
some infants there are no untoward occurrences.But there seems to be
no valid reason for separating the disturbances purely in the domain of
the nervous system from the other pathological processes originated or
aggravated by morbid dentition.Doubtless predisposition often
determines the direction and severity of the reflected phenomena; and
in the same manner reflected irritation may bring an organ within the
influence of the ordinary disease-producing cause.The convulsive phenomena associated with dentition may take the form of
general eclampsia or spasms of particular groups of muscles.These
latter are very common--according to Vogel, universal--and vary in
intensity from that slight contraction of the facial muscles which
sends the mother into raptures of delight over the heavenly smile of
her {375} sleeping babe to the distressing seizure of laryngismus
stridulus.Sometimes the child may sleep with its eyes half open, the
eyeballs directed upward, and only the white sclerotic to be seen
through the gap between the lids, "producing an appearance which is
unnatural and alarming to the laity."The attacks of general eclampsia are usually sudden.The child has been
to all appearances perfectly healthy, when, without warning, there
occurs a series of tetanic spasms like a succession of electric shocks.The individual eclamptic shock cannot be distinguished from an
epileptic seizure.These convulsions sometimes continue for several
days, but frequently they cease after a few minutes.They may pass off
and leave nothing to testify to their occurrence; very frequently they
occasion permanent distressing lesions.Partial, so-called essential
paralyses, squint, or even idiocy, are cited among their sequelae;
infants subject to repeated convulsions while cutting successive teeth
have eventually perished from cerebro-spinal meningitis; death has not
infrequently been an immediate result.In these graver cases teething
is probably but one of the morbid influences at work.Purulent otitis media follows dentition in some infants, usually, if
not invariably, of a scrofulous diathesis.At the clinic of the
Jefferson Medical College Hospital fully one-third of all the cases of
otorrhoea in children are said to be so occasioned.Blennorrhoeal conjunctivitis is a rare complication of teething, and
when it occurs usually accompanies the eruption of the upper molars and
canines (eye teeth).It is attributed to direct extension of the
gingival inflammation by continuity through the antrum of Highmore and
the nasal passages.By some it is said to occur only in strumous
subjects.It is unilateral, and is not contagious, so that there is no
cause for alarm concerning the unaffected eye.The lids soon swell
enormously and the eyeball is exposed with difficulty.The secretion is more mucous, translucent, and
stringy than in genuine blennorrhoea.The eyeball always remains intact
and the prognosis is always favorable (Vogel).Milder forms of
catarrhal conjunctivitis are not very uncommon.Thus far, we have considered only the process of the first dentition.Before the shedding of any of the deciduous teeth, the first permanent
molars inaugurate the second dentition, appearing in position at about
the sixth year.Next, displacing their temporary predecessors, come the
central incisors, between the sixth and eighth years, the inferior pair
generally preceding the superior ones.The lateral incisors are cut
between the seventh and ninth years; the anterior bicuspids between the
ninth and tenth years; the posterior bicuspids between the tenth and
eleventh years; the canines between the eleventh and thirteenth years;
the second molars between the twelfth and fourteenth years; the third
molars, or wisdom teeth, between the seventeenth and twenty-first years
as a rule, occasionally much earlier, sometimes later.The eruption of the permanent teeth does not usually occasion any very
great amount of distress; nevertheless, it sometimes acts both as a
predisposing and as an exciting cause of various disorders, local and
systemic.The various forms of stomatitis, tonsillitis, sore throat,
gastro-intestinal derangements, febrile disturbances, bronchitis,
internal rhinitis, {376} diseases of the eye, of the ear, of the skin,
chorea, epilepsy, etc., have all been noted as accompanying, if not
occasioned by, the second dentition.Ashburner[76] records, among other
similar instances, that of a lad twelve years old who presented a
marked case of chorea, and after three months' continuance of the
twitchings fell into a violent epileptic fit, from difficulty in the
eruption of the second pair of permanent molars of the upper jaw.The
use of the gum lancet relieved the convulsion, and there was no return
of the chorea.[Footnote 76: _On Dentition and some Coincident Disorders_, London,
1834, cited by Tanner.]Quite frequently, the eruption of the inferior dentes sapientiae
occasions great and protracted suffering, especially when they appear
very close to or partially under the coronoid processes.Considerable
irritation is occasioned, in which the gums and adjacent tissues
participate.Inflammation may result and extend to the fauces;
mastication becomes impossible; severe odynphagia is excited.Suppuration may ensue, and then the pus burrows in various directions,
finding exit at points more or less remote, internal or external.Among
the consequences of the eruption of a wisdom tooth into a crowded arch,
White[77] cites fistulae, necrosis, exostosis, ulceration and sloughing
of the soft tissues, cystic and other tumors, ankylosis of the jaw,
amaurosis, otalgia, otorrhoea, deafness, facial paralysis, hemicrania,
oesophagismus, tonsillitis, erysipelas, aphonia, hysteria, neuralgia,
chorea, epilepsy, tetanus, death.[Footnote 77: "Pathological Dentition," extract from annual supplement
to the _Obstet.of Great Britain and Ireland_, April, 1878.]DIAGNOSIS.--The age of the child and the appearances already described
will afford a basis for diagnosis so far as the local manifestations in
the mouth are concerned.The diagnosis of local disorders at a
distance, or of systemic disturbances of whatever character, can be
made out only by careful consideration of all the attending
circumstances; and it is always to be borne in mind that while the
process of dentition is to be recognized as one of the causative
factors, grave injustice might be done the little patient, and its life
perhaps endangered, by failure to recognize the presence of other and
perhaps more potent morbid influences.In cases of chorea or epilepsy, of eye or ear troubles, or of any
morbid condition not otherwise accounted for, occurring during the
period of the second dentition, especially at the sixth, twelfth, and
seventeenth years, or until the wisdom teeth are fully erupted, it is
well to inspect the mouth and to think of dentition as the possible
cause.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis will depend upon the character and gravity of
the associated symptoms, the presence or absence of diathesis, and the
etiological importance attached to dentition.It is impossible to lay
down a general law.TREATMENT.--The treatment of the deuteropathic or associated disorders
is to be conducted on the general principles applicable to those
diseases; for a consideration of which the reader is referred to the
appropriate articles of this work.We have here to consider general
prophylaxis and local measures.The proper management of the child
during the period of the first dentition is a matter of great
importance, and may avert serious complications.The child should be as
much as possible in the open air whenever the weather is favorable.The
head may be daily sponged with cold water, and caps and warm
head-coverings of all kinds should {377} be forbidden.[78] Frequent
rubbing of the gums with a crust or other hard substance, or with the
finger, is advisable; and something for the child to bite on,
preferably a silver piece, should be provided.Orris-root, calamus, and
other vegetable substances frequently given to children for this
purpose are objectionable; their fermentation is apt to lead to thrush.The diet should be carefully
regulated, and cooling drinks be freely given in order that the child
may not overload its stomach by too frequent suckling in its efforts to
relieve the local heat by moisture.The mother should be warned not to
put it too frequently to the breast.Weaned children will often be
found unable to digest their ordinary food, and in that case still
greater care will be required.Slight diarrhoea does not call for
interference, and is often beneficial in relieving nervous tension and
thus averting a tendency to convulsions.Indeed, when the bowels are
not relaxed gentle aperients should be given, especially in plethoric
subjects or in those with cutaneous eruptions (Clarke).Cutaneous
eruptions do not call for treatment, and there seems to be ground for
the popular fear that they may be driven inward; at least, cases are on
record in which their disappearance under treatment, and even
spontaneously, has been followed by more or less severe convulsions.In cases where bronchitis can be traced wholly or in part to soaking of
the clothing, due protection of the chest by an oil-cloth or waterproof
bib may be prophylactic against future attacks.In children who have
suffered from any special set of morbid manifestations during the
eruption of one pair of teeth, similar disturbances may be expected,
and should be guarded against, in the future.Aphthous ulcerations are usually associated with disorders of
digestion, the relief of which must be the main object of treatment.Locally, the treatment does not differ from that of aphthous stomatitis
in general.Obstinate ulceration of the tongue may require the use of
silver nitrate.In that form of ulceration called odontitis infantum,
in addition to proper attention to the diet and secretions and mild
antiphlogistic medication, local depletion by leeches, preferably at
the angle of the jaw, is often beneficial.Some writers advise the
application of leeches directly to the gum.Potassium chlorate
internally, two grains every four hours to a child twelve months old,
is curative in the majority of cases.It may be given dissolved in
sweetened water.Solutions of borax, and, in severe cases, of silver
nitrate, may be applied locally.The use of the lancet is
contraindicated, for the cut surfaces would be liable to ulceration.Incision for a cuspid (White).]Incision for a molar (White).]The propriety of resort to the lancet for cure of systemic disturbances
by obviating the source of local irritation is one which deserves
consideration.It can only be decided upon the indications presented by
the individual case.The knife is not a panacea for all the disorders
of childhood occurring during dentition, and its indiscriminate use is
to be discountenanced.Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that
engorged and inflamed gums demand incision for their relief, on the
same general principles of surgery applicable to similar conditions
elsewhere.Where it is probable that systemic disease, even if not
solely caused, is aggravated by the irritation and pain of a tooth
unable to make its way to the surface unaided, it is clearly the duty
of the physician to give his little patient that modicum of relief, if
not of cure, which will be afforded by a proper incision of {378} the
gum.It will not do merely to score the gums, but cuts should be made
deep enough to reach the presenting surface and extend even beyond its
boundaries.The developing enamel cannot be injured unless undue force
be exerted.The best instrument to employ is a curved double-edged
bistoury, so wrapped as to prevent injury to tongue, cheek, or lips.The child should be firmly held by another person, and in such a
position that the parts may be well illuminated.The jaws can be
separated by the operator's left hand, and the fingers so disposed as
to protect the tongue and lips.Sometimes the insertion of a small cork
between the jaws will be of advantage.The cuts should be made with
special reference to the form of the presenting tooth.James W.
White[79] recommends for the incisors and cuspids a division of the gum
in the line of the arch; for the molars a crucial incision, thus X, the
centre of the crown as near as can be determined indicating the point
of decussation.A cuspid partially erupted needs severance of the
fibrous ring on the anterior and posterior as well as on the lateral
surfaces (Fig.All the cups of a molar may have erupted, and yet
strong fibrous bands maintain a decided resistance.In this case White
thinks that all the boundaries of the tooth should be traced by the
lancet and all such bands completely severed, or else a crucial
incision, as in the figure (Fig.18), should be made so as to ensure
perfect release from pressure.The only contraindication to the use of
the lancet, except in ulcerative odontitis, as before mentioned, is the
existence of a hemorrhagic diathesis.cit._]




{379}

DISEASES OF THE TONSILS.BY J. SOLIS COHEN, M.D.DEFINITION.--An acute inflammation of the tonsil or tonsils; or
inflammation of the tonsil or tonsils, with inflammation of the
peritonsillar connective tissue and of the palatine folds.VARIETIES.--When the inflammatory process is confined to the mucous
membrane the disease is erythematous, superficial, or catarrhal
tonsillitis; when it involves the lacunae it constitutes lacunal or
follicular tonsillitis; when it involves the gland as a whole it
constitutes parenchymatous, phlegmonous, or suppurative tonsillitis.When the
superficial inflammatory process is a vesicular one, eventually
sheathing the surface of the organ in whole or in part with a
membranous envelope, it constitutes herpetic or membranous tonsillitis.When the
inflammation of the tonsil, usually superficial, is due to the presence
of a cryptogamic growth, it is a mycotic or parasitic tonsillitis,
benign or malignant (diphtheria), as may be.When the inflammation of
the tonsil is due to rheumatism, it is rheumatic or constitutional
tonsillitis.SYNONYMS.--Inflammation of the tonsils, Amygdalitis, Quinsy, Angina
tonsillaris, Angina phlegmonosa, Phlegmonous sore throat, Cynanche
tonsillaris.Lacunal tonsillitis is more generally known as folliculous
tonsillitis (tonsillitis follicularis).Common membranous or
pseudo-membranous sore throat (angina membranosa communis) is used as a
synonym for herpetic or membranous tonsillitis (tonsillitis herpetica
seu membranosa).Mycosis tonsillaris is a synonym for mycotic
tonsillitis (tonsillitis mycotica benigna or tonsillitis parasitica).The tonsillitis of diphtheria is sometimes termed tonsillitis
diphtheritica, tonsillitis mycotica maligna; that of rheumatism,
tonsillitis rheumatica, angina rheumatica, rheumatic sore throat.HISTORY.--Tonsillitis was described by Hippocrates.Of recent authors,
Sauvages, Cullen, Louis for researches on the effects of blood-letting;
Bell on the specific value of guaiacum; Velpeau as to the use of
powdered alum and nitrate of silver; Bourgeoise on the use of tartar
emetic; Maingault on paralytic sequelae; Hering on mycosis; and the
authors of the various encyclopaedias and dictionaries,--may be
mentioned as chief among the numerous observers whose contributions
have been of most value.The bibliographical references appended to the
{380} compilations last cited will guide the student in gaining access
to the more important special observations of anomalous cases.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing and Exciting Causes.--Tonsillitis may be
idiopathic, deuteropathic or symptomatic, or traumatic.The predisposing cause of idiopathic tonsillitis is usually diathetic,
and is associated with congenital or inherited vulnerability of the
organ.Of diathetic causes, scrofula is undoubtedly the most
provocative, but even rheumatism and gout are likewise so considered,
though in a far more limited degree.Acute articular rheumatism is, in
fact, sometimes preceded by rather a sharp attack of tonsillitis
(rheumatic tonsillitis), which subsides spontaneously in a very few
days, sometimes within one day, sometimes suddenly and synchronously
with the onset of the ordinary manifestations of rheumatism, though the
latter are often slight and transient, as if the force of the attack
had been spent on the tonsils.Tonsillitis, non-specific in character,
is apt to be prevalent during epidemics of scarlatina, diphtheria,
rubeola, and variola.Membranous tonsillitis is common before and after
epidemics of diphtheria.Epidemics of tonsillitis have been recorded,
but in the face of their extreme rarity it becomes questionable whether
they were not extensive examples of the proclivity just alluded to.Tonsillitis is more frequent in individuals with chronically diseased
tonsils than in individuals in whom these glands are healthy.Such
individuals, too, are more liable to recurrences; and such recurrences
often follow very slight provocations.Idiopathic tonsillitis is rare in infancy.At the period of eruption of
the permanent teeth it is much more liable to occur than before that
period, and the liability increases progressively until the second
dentition has been completed.It is most frequent during the decennium
immediately following puberty--that is to say, in adolescents and young
adults--or from the fifteenth to the twenty-fifth year.The disposition
or predisposition to renewed attacks continues marked during the
decennium immediately succeeding; after which attacks are more and more
infrequent.Certain anatomical changes occurring in the tonsils, as the
rule about the fortieth year, may diminish their proclivity to
inflammation.Nevertheless, the disease occasionally occurs in advanced
age.[1]

[Footnote 1: Solomon Solis Cohen, "Abscess of the Tonsil in an
Octogenarian," _Med.Deuteropathic tonsillitis is quite frequent in infancy, being excited
by the infection of scarlet fever, diphtheria, measles, and small-pox,
as discussed under these headings respectively.Under similar
circumstances it occurs in the adolescent and the adult likewise.It is
also produced in carcinoma and sarcoma of the tonsil.Rheumatic tonsillitis, a deuteropathic variety, is most prevalent
during atmospheric changes.Herpetic tonsillitis, often a deuteropathic variety, seems sometimes of
nervous origin exclusively.It is sometimes traceable to defective
drainage.It is sometimes prevalent during epidemics of diphtheria,
when its membranous character renders it extremely liable to be
mistaken for the tonsillitis of diphtheria.The causes are--inspiration
of irritant gases, the deglutition of chemically acrid substances, the
{381} accumulation of calcareous concretions in the crypts or in the
lacunae, direct and indirect gunshot and other wounds, the impaction of
fish-bones, fragments of toothpicks, cherry-stones, and other foreign
bodies, and the like.Mycotic tonsillitis is due to the development of a cryptogam upon
tonsils probably already in a state of catarrhal inflammation in
individuals with health impaired by previous disease or unfavorable
hygienic influences.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, TERMINATIONS, COMPLICATIONS, AND
SEQUELAE.--The onset of tonsillitis, sometimes preceded by headache and
general malaise, is often accompanied by a chill, pyrexia following
within twenty-four hours.The temperature may reach 105 degrees F.,
being at its maximum, as a rule, about the third day.It is rarely
below 101 degrees F. The pulse is accelerated to 120 beats per minute.Simultaneously with the constitutional symptoms local distress is
usually manifested, but either set of disturbances may precede the
other by several hours or by an entire day.Heat and soreness of the
throat are early complained of, gradually increasing in severity to
actual pain.The pain may become intense, especially during
deglutition.When the posterior palatine fold is put upon the stretch,
additional pain is referred to the ear, for this fold encloses the
staphylo-salpingeus muscle, which runs from the palate to the
pharyngeal orifice of the Eustachian tube.This pain in the ear,
sometimes the principal cause of complaint, is often premonitory of
suppuration.Noises in the ears on the one hand, and impairment of
hearing on the other, often attend extension of the inflammation in
this direction, the enlarged tonsil sometimes pressing the posterior
palatine fold against the pharyngeal orifice of the Eustachian tube.On inspecting the throat early in the disease, one of the tonsils will
be seen to be swollen into an irregularly tumid, much-inflamed mass,
usually of a vivid red color.Occasionally both tonsils are involved
simultaneously, but this is far less frequent than involvement of the
second tonsil a few days later or after subsidence of the process in
its fellow.In many instances the inflammation affects one tonsil only.The inflammatory process is seldom confined to the tonsil.All the
structures of the throat, even to the base of the tongue, are often
involved, and it is rarely indeed that the anterior palatine fold,
distended over the surface of the tumefied gland, escapes inflammation.It is this stretching of the anterior palatine fold which occasions
much of the exquisite pain that forms so prominent a subjective symptom
in severe cases.The soft palate, hanging forward in the cavity of the
pharynx, is often inflamed or intensely congested, and the uvula
tumefied, elongated, and oedematous.It may be flaccid upon the
posterior part of the tongue or hang immediately over the epiglottis or
upon it, and induce painful and tiresome efforts at deglutition and
expectoration to relieve the consequent titillation.Sometimes it
adheres by viscid secretion to the side of the swollen tonsil.The inflamed tonsil or the tonsil and its coverings project far into
the cavity of the pharynx, often as far as the middle line, touching
its fellow when both are involved, so that ulceration sometimes ensues
at the points of contact.The posterior surface of the anterior
palatine fold sometimes becomes unfolded, as it were, in the
tumefaction of the gland, and remains {382} stretched over it in a thin
continuous layer without any line of demarcation.The swollen palate
projects upon the enlarged tonsil like a shelf, from which depends the
uvula, the latter being often oedematous, usually anteriorly, but
sometimes posteriorly.Inflammation of the connective tissue about the lower jaw, especially
when at or near the articulation, often renders it difficult or even
impracticable to open the mouth sufficiently to permit direct
inspection of the parts; but it is rarely that sufficient space cannot
be made to allow partial protrusion of the tongue on the one hand, and
the introduction of a fore finger for exploratory purposes on the
other, though both of these acts are sometimes impossible.The
tumefaction of the parts impairs the freedom and ease of deglutition,
which may become so painful as to prevent the swallowing of the saliva,
which then may dribble from the mouth.The pain experienced in swallowing is often manifested by convulsive
action of the muscles of deglutition and of the muscles of the face.The swollen tonsils prevent the soft palate from being applied to the
surface of the pharynx, as usual in deglutition; and as the upper or
retro-nasal portion of the pharynx thus fails to be shut off from the
lower oesophageal portion, liquids are often forced up into the nasal
passages posteriorly, and are regurgitated through the nostrils, thus
rendering it impracticable, for the time, to slake thirst or to swallow
liquid nourishment.At first sensations of dryness and pastiness in the throat are
complained of, but in a few hours these symptoms become relieved by a
more copious secretion of mucus or mucus and saliva.This secretion
soon becomes viscid, and so adherent to the parts as to be detached
only with difficulty, thus causing harassing efforts for its
dislodgment by hawking and expectoration, or equally distressing
efforts to swallow it.Should the inflammatory process extend to the
salivary glands, as is not infrequently the case, secondary ptyalism
often results, with increased distress from this source, and the
patient lies or sits with his head inclined upon the diseased or most
diseased side to favor the uninterrupted flow of saliva from the mouth.Extension of the inflammatory process to the submaxillary glands, or to
the parotid, or to the connective tissue surrounding them, is indicated
by tumefaction externally, which is often exquisitively sensitive to
pressure.The timbre or quality of the voice is often impaired in a peculiar
manner by the tumefaction of the throat and the immobility of the soft
palate.The voice is thick, throaty, or guttural, having a
characteristic harsh, rasping aspiration in enunciation, while
articulation is much impeded by impairment in the movements of the jaw,
palate, tongue, and lips.Speech is
sometimes indistinguishable or impossible, and the voice may even
become suppressed, so that signs and writing remain the sole means of
communication.Impairment of respiration, at least to any considerable degree, does
not occur, unless both tonsils are involved and swollen to an intense
degree--conditions under which dyspnoea may become pronounced, severe,
and even urgent, and suffocation become imminent.Painful respiration
is not uncommon in rheumatic tonsillitis.There are often severe aching pains in
{383} the limbs.Headache, restlessness, insomnia, nausea, and even
vomiting, may occur.The tongue is heavily coated, the breath is fetid,
appetite is impaired, and the bowels are constipated.The urine is
diminished in quantity, high-, and of high specific gravity.It
usually shows slight increase of urea and great diminution of
chlorides.The symptoms are proportionate to the severity of the attack.A first
attack is usually much severer than subsequent ones, and suppurative
cases more severe than those terminating by resolution.Resolution is
the usual termination, and the parts are restored to a normal condition
at the end of ten to fourteen days, sometimes earlier; in exceptional
cases not until three or four weeks.Sometimes permanent hypertrophy of
the tonsil remains.Where the inflammatory process fails to subside, suddenly at the end of
five or six days, or a little later, or not until ten days to a
fortnight have passed, slight rigors supervene, announcing suppuration,
and the local distress is very great, with pulsation and lancinating
pains in the tonsils, until all at once the abscess bursts and its
contents are discharged with immediate relief.Sometimes the pus or
much of it is involuntarily swallowed; sometimes it is expectorated.In
exceptional instances the pus has escaped into the larynx and
suffocated the patient, usually during sleep.[2] In rare instances the
abscess, having burrowed beneath the pharyngeal muscles, may open at
the external angle of the jaw or behind the sterno-mastoid muscle.It
may discharge into the epiglotto-pharyngeal fold, and thence reach and
distend the epiglottis.It has been known to descend along the planes
of connective tissue into the mediastinum or into the lungs.Even
ulceration into the maxillary and carotid arteries has occurred,
usually with fatal result, occasionally with an opportunity to save
life by ligating the carotid (Erhmann).[3]

[Footnote 2: Stokes, _Med.med._, Paris, 1878, p.The most frequent point of spontaneous rupture externally is at the
upper portion of the gland anteriorly, just beneath the anterior
palatine fold.Sometimes internal rupture occurs into the lacunae.Termination by gangrene is exceptional, and is confined to individuals
with debilitated constitutions.It is much less frequent than
formerly--as a result, perhaps, of better methods of treatment.Metastasis is one of the methods of termination as to joints or muscles
in rheumatic tonsillitis--to lungs, brain, or gastro-intestinal
tract--as formerly occurred with much more frequency under direct
depletory treatment.In rare cases extension of the inflammation occurs to the epiglottis,
even to the larynx, and the laryngitis may be so severe as to threaten
life from the occurrence of oedema.Diffuse inflammation of the
retro-pharyngeal connective tissue or of the connective tissue of the
neck may constitute an unpleasant complication of the disease.In a few instances paralysis of the palate occurs as a sequel of
tonsillitis, and in exceptional cases the paralysis may also affect the
arytenoid muscles of the larynx, and even the accommodator muscles of
the eyes.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Tonsillitis is almost always {384}
associated with inflammation of the tissues surrounding the tonsil and
those contiguous to it, even in the mildest and most frequent
manifestations of the affection.Thus, inflammation of the palate
(staphyllitis) and uvula, and even of the pharynx (pharyngitis), are
anatomically included with tonsillitis in angina or sore throat.The mildest form of the malady is a catarrhal inflammation of the
mucous membrane covering the gland, and does not extend along the
lacunae which dip inward from the surface and divaricate toward the
interior of the organ.It is termed catarrhal tonsillitis, and, as has
been intimated, is almost always associated with catarrhal sore throat.It is attributed to hyperaemia, with passive engorgement of the
vessels, following retrocession of blood from the cutaneous surface
after undue exposure to cold and moisture.A severer form of the malady
involves the lacunae in addition--several or all of them.This should
be termed lacunar tonsillitis, as suggested by Wagner.Primarily, at
least, it does not involve the follicles of the tonsils which open into
the lacunae, and is therefore incorrectly denominated follicular
tonsillitis, although it is most generally so described.The lacunae
are involutions of the mucous membrane, and in health furnish a
slightly turbid mucoid secretion which serves to lubricate the parts
and, as is generally believed, to facilitate deglutition.When the
lacunae are inflamed these products become pent up in them to a certain
extent, accumulate, and project in part at their orifices in turbid
creamy or curdy masses, plastered over the parts when thin in
consistence, or tightly imbedded when thick or desiccated.These masses
are usually white, but sometimes, owing to various admixtures, they are
more or less yellowish or gray or brown.They consist of epithelium
chiefly, with more or less pus and accumulation of cells similar to
those of which the follicles are composed--whether from follicles which
have become distended by proliferation of their constituents, and have
then burst, is not known.This epithelium has often undergone fatty
degeneration in part.Cholesterin is an occasional constituent, and
swarms of micrococci and bacteria abound when the masses are not
recent, especially if the inflammation is occurring in a tonsil long
the seat of chronic disease of the lacunae.The tonsil itself is moderately swollen and its mucous membrane
hyperaemic.If the parenchyma of the tonsil be involved likewise, as
often occurs, the swelling will be much greater, so that the gland will
project a considerable distance beyond the margins of the palatine
folds.When a hypertrophied tonsil is the seat of the inflammation the
tumefaction will be much greater than when the inflamed tonsil has been
normal.Acute inflammation of the palatine folds often coexists, especially of
the anterior fold.The soft palate may also be engaged in the morbid
process, which may involve the uvula likewise.Pharyngitis is an
occasional accompaniment, and stomatitis quite a rare one.Lacunar tonsillitis sometimes subsides by spontaneous evacuation of the
pent-up contents of secretion and desquamation, the parts returning to
their normal condition.More frequently a desiccation of some of these
products ensues, with permanent chronic inflammation.Decomposition
then often takes place, fouling the breath by the escape of the gases.Butyric acid has been recognized as one of the most prominent of these
fetid {385} gases.Calcareous change occurs in these contents of the
lacunae in some instances.Lacunar or follicular tonsillitis is often
associated with severe inflammation of the peritonsillar connective
tissue and the contiguous palatine fold, with serous or cellular
infiltration into these structures almost always terminating in
suppuration.This form of tonsillitis is very frequent, and is often
confounded with parenchymatous tonsillitis or with tonsillar abscess.In these cases the abscess is in the peritonsillar tissue or in the
posterior leaflet of the anterior palatine fold.It bursts above the
tonsil at the angle between the two folds in the greater number of
cases.In some instances the suppurative inflammation affects the
anterior surface of the posterior palatine fold, sometimes contiguously
to the antero-tonsillar abscess, sometimes independently, constituting
a retro-tonsillar abscess.The follicles in the posterior palatine fold
are sometimes involved, the thickened anterior surface of this
structure becoming studded with small projections the size of ordinary
pinheads or larger, distended with whitish-yellow contents.In another class of cases of tonsillitis the inflammatory process may
be chiefly parenchymatous, for rarely is it wholly so.That is to say,
it may involve the glandular structure of the organ wholly or in main
part.The disease is then an adenitis, an inflammation of
gland-tissue--tonsillitis per se.It is associated with superficial
inflammation of the surrounding mucous membrane, secondarily if not
primarily, and often with inflammation of the lacunae.In many
instances the parenchymatous inflammation is a direct extension of the
lacunar inflammation.Parenchymatous tonsillitis may subside by resolution, or, as is quite
frequent, terminate by suppuration.A number of small abscesses may be
formed, which usually become confluent and rarely remain discrete.The confluent abscess may
discharge by several points.It is always associated with a severe
inflammation of the palatine folds and palate, especially the anterior
fold; sometimes of the adjoining half of the soft palate and the uvula;
sometimes of the entire velum and uvula.Sometimes these parts become
oedematous; sometimes suppuration ensues.Severe pharyngitis is not
uncommon.Glossitis, involving the posterior portion of the tongue
especially or exclusively, is an occasional accompaniment of
parenchymatous tonsillitis.Occasionally oedema takes
place in the epiglottis and upper margin of the larynx.Sometimes these are semifluid;
sometimes soft, caseous, or pultaceous; sometimes fibrinous and
arranged in pseudo-membranes; sometimes hemorrhagic; sometimes moist
and viscid, sometimes very dry; often adherent, and always containing
cryptogams (leptothrix, Oidium albicans, bacteria, and micrococci).Collections of caseous products accumulate not only in the crypts of
the tonsils and in their overlying mucous membrane, but likewise in the
follicles of the palatine folds below the tonsil, and thence toward the
base of the tongue.The submaxillary glands often undergo engorgement, and become so tender
that external manipulation is painful, and sometimes they undergo
suppuration.The tumefaction due to the swollen glands and infiltrated
connective tissue around it is frequently incorrectly referred to the
tonsil itself, rather than to the accompanying inflamed palate, with
the {386} lymphatics of which these glands are in more direct
anatomical connection.The tonsil is at a considerable distance from
the inflamed glands, and cannot be felt from the exterior except under
unusual circumstances.Herpetic tonsillitis is a rare form of inflammation of the tonsil, or
rather of its investing mucous membrane, characterized by the eruption
of herpetic vesicles on its surface.The vesicles soon undergo rupture,
and the resulting ulcers coalesce and become covered with a fibrinous
exudation.The disease is usually associated with similar vesicles upon
the palatine folds and upon the soft palate, and exceptionally with
vesicles on the pharynx.(See Herpetic Pharyngitis.)It is by some
fortuitous circumstance only that it is observed in the vesicular
stage.It is confined to one side of the throat in most instances, but
may be bilateral also.Mycosis tonsillaris has been described by a few observers.B.
Fraenkel[4] has recorded three cases, E. Fraenkel[5] one, and Bayer[6]
two.In these cases the disease was not confined to the tonsils, but
implicated the calciform papillae of the tongue also, and one of
Bayer's cases some pharyngeal follicles in addition.E. Fraenkel's case
was in a male, and occupied but the right tonsil and base of tongue.The white masses in this case were formed of spores and filaments
(Bacillus fasciculatus, Sadebeck), which are described as penetrating
some millimeters into the gland-tissue.These masses were tenacious,
and were reproduced rapidly after removal.In Bayer's cases, both
females, the same microphyte was recognized.In a female patient
observed at the Philadelphia Polyclinic[7] this affection followed
rheumatic tonsillitis, diphtheria being prevalent near her residence,
which was in a very unsalubrious locality.The deposit, confined to the
left tonsil, was so firmly adherent to the mucous membrane that the
implicated portion had to be torn away to get rid of the growth, which
was twice reproduced.The fungus was in its mycelial state, a few
spores and conidiferous filaments being recognized microscopically.94; _ibid._, 1880, No.[Footnote 5: _Zeitschrift fur klin.de Laryngologie, etc._, Nov., 1882, p.[Footnote 7: S. Solis-Cohen, _The Polyclinic_, March, 1884, p.Quite recently, and since the above was written, the results of an
elaborate study of this affection by Theodor Hering of Warsaw have been
published in a paper entitled "Pharynxmycosis leptothricia,"[8] read
before the Society of German Naturalists and Physicians.The author
collates fourteen cases, six of which were observed by himself.He
claims that the microphyte is simply the Leptothrix buccalis.[Footnote 8: _Zeitschrift fur klinische Medicin_, Bd.The local subjective symptoms as collated by Hering vary from the
merest sense of discomfort in chronic cases to intense pain, difficulty
in speech and in deglutition, and various grades of cough in acute
ones.Constitutional
disturbance may be entirely absent or may be presented in various
febrile or sub-febrile manifestations.DIAGNOSIS.--The history of the attack, the appearances described, and
the symptoms narrated should ordinarily suffice for a correct
diagnosis.An unsuspected tumor of the tonsil
observed for the first time during an ordinary sore throat might be
taken for an inflamed tonsil, but the progress of the case would soon
lead to its due {387} recognition.While tonsillitis is infrequent
after the fourth decennium, it occasionally occurs late in life, and
has been observed even in the ninth decennium; and reserve is proper as
to the cause of enlarged tonsils in the sore throats of those advanced
in life.The deposit in follicular or lacunar tonsillitis or angina is pulpy and
not membraniform.It can be wiped from the surface with a fragment of
sponge, and does not tear from the surface in strips, as is the case
with the pseudo-membrane of diphtheria or of common membranous sore
throat.There is no abrasion of the mucous membrane beneath the
deposit.The patches are more prominent, usually more circumscribed,
and dip down into the lacunae, or rather project from the crypts upon
the surface of the tonsil.In its physical aspect the deposit more
closely resembles that observed in the sore throats accompanying
cachectic conditions, as in chronic tuberculosis, advanced syphilis,
some forms of scarlatina, typhus and typhoid fever, extreme old age
(agine pultacee, Fr.; cachectic angina); but the existence of previous
constitutional disease and actual debility should prevent the mistake
in diagnosis.In susceptible subjects the oncoming of an attack of
rheumatic tonsillitis may often be inferred, previous to the
manifestation of local symptoms, from the existence of otherwise
inexplicable odynphagia, the pain being especially intense upon
attempts to swallow saliva.Sometimes laryngoscopic inspection at this
early stage of the disease will reveal vivid redness of the mucous
membrane in the neighborhood of the crico-arytenoid articulations.[9]
The value of this early diagnosis lies in the opportunity it affords to
try abortive treatment.[Footnote 9: S. Solis Cohen, _The Medical News_, Aug.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of catarrhal tonsillitis is almost invariably
favorable, except under very obviously unfavorable conditions, the
inflammatory process subsiding spontaneously within a few days.It is
favorable, as a rule, in phlegmonous tonsillitis subsiding within ten
or twelve days in most instances, even though all the stages be
completed to suppuration and discharge of the abscess.Sometimes two or
three weeks are consumed in the process.A certain amount of reserve is
requisite, nevertheless, in severe cases, in view of the possible
complications which may prevent recovery.If both tonsils are affected
to such an extent as to interfere seriously with respiration, death by
suffocation may ensue should the obstruction be not relieved by
excision of portions of the swollen glands or an artificial opening be
not made into the air-passage.Suppuration may perforate the internal
carotid or the external maxillary artery and produce sudden fatal
hemorrhage.The remembrance of such occurrences should screen a surgeon
from the imputation of carelessness should he be unfortunate enough to
incise an abscess under similar conditions.Some cases are on record of
fatal hemorrhage but a short period before a proposed operation could
have been performed.Suffocation has ensued from discharge of the abscess into the
air-passage, usually during sleep; but it has occurred even during the
moment of speaking (Stokes).[10] Such results are accidental and
exceptional.Recurrences are frequent, especially in scrofulous subjects, and such
recurrences are apt to result in permanent hypertrophy and induration.TREATMENT.--Mild cases of tonsillitis require no treatment except to
{388} keep the patient protected from exposure to abrupt changes of
temperature.The course of the affection both in mild cases and in
severe ones may often be materially shortened by prompt resort to the
use of guaiacum, both internally and topically.A gargle containing an
ounce each of ammoniated tincture of guaiacum and compound tincture of
cinchona to the pint, with the addition of three ounces of clarified
honey, and saturated with potassium chlorate (twenty grains to the
ounce), may be used, a drachm at a time, every two hours, hour, or half
hour, according to the urgency of the symptoms, and may likewise be
administered internally in drachm doses for an adult every two or more
hours.The beneficial effects will often be manifested within less than
twelve hours.Pellets of ice held in the mouth from time to time often
relieve pain and repress inflammation.Sodium bicarbonate locally, in
powder, affords great relief in some instances.In the presence of
marked pyrexia tincture of aconite may be given in drop doses every
hour until an impression has been made upon the heart, when its
continuance at intervals of four or more hours will be a matter for
consideration.Guaiacum and aconite may be given with equal benefit in any form
preferred by the prescriber.At the same time saline laxatives may be
required from time to time.When the tonsils are very much swollen, gargling of all kinds becomes
too painful, and therefore sprays of sedative and emollient mixtures
are to be substituted, or steam from water impregnated with volatile
substances, as benzoin, paregoric, hops, chamomile, and sage.When the
cervical glands are swollen, continuous hot and moist applications
externally afford great relief.If the suffering from the inflamed
tonsil be intense, scarification should be practised and the bleeding
be encouraged by warm water.When suppuration exists, the abscess
should be promptly evacuated by incision at the most prominent
accessible point.The pain in swallowing can often be diminished by pulling on the lobe
of the ear at the moment of deglutition (Grewcock).[11] In debilitated
subjects, or during epidemics of diphtheria, quinia, iron, and
supporting measures are indicated.[Footnote 11: _Lancet_, Nov., 1882, N.Y.The rheumatic cases are best treated with sodium salicylate, ten to
fifteen grains every hour or two until relieved.Instituted in the
formative stage above alluded to, this treatment frequently seems to be
veritably abortive, especially when preceded by a full dose of an
alkaline purgative--say one ounce of Rochelle salts.Oil of gaultheria
may be used in small doses as an agreeable flavor to the mixture, or in
doses of ten to twenty minims, well diluted, as an adjuvant to the
salicylate, or even as a substitute for it.After subsidence of the
acute symptoms cinchonidine salicylate may be continued for a few days
in appropriate doses.Herpetic tonsillitis requires the ordinary treatment for erythematous
tonsillitis, with additional topical treatment by sprays of alkaline
solutions, such as sodium borate or bicarbonate, five grains to the
ounce, or lime-water.Internally, small doses of mercuric chloride will
be of service, the dose varying, according to the age and size of the
patient, from one-forty-eighth to one-sixteenth of a grain every two
hours, until the stomach shows signs of irritation therefrom.In cases
of doubt as to {389} diagnosis from diphtheria the treatment for
diphtheria will be indicated as the safer measure.Here, again, the
mercuric chloride is sometimes equally valuable.Mycosis of the tonsil does not seem amenable to medicinal treatment.Thorough removal of the fungus with forceps or sharp spoons is
required, even though mucous membrane be detached with it.When this is
impracticable, ablation of the tonsil may be necessary.Raw or cut
surfaces left by any of these manipulations should be subjected to
thorough cauterization, electric cauterization being the most feasible
method.{390}

DISEASES OF THE PHARYNX.BY J. SOLIS COHEN, M.D.DEFINITION.--An acute inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
pharynx, whether implicating the glandular structures or not, and
usually associated with inflammation of contiguous structures.[1] Acute
pharyngitis may be catarrhal or erythematous, phlegmonous or
suppurative, ulcerative, herpetic or membranous, gangrenous, and
erysipelatous.[Footnote 1: In deference to the plan suggested by the editor of this
work, separate articles have been prepared under the heads of
Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis respectively.The two processes, however,
are so frequently associated that they should be studied together, the
more that both of them are likewise associated with extensions of the
inflammatory process to the palate, palatine folds, base of the tongue,
and other contiguous structures.The writer has always preferred to
describe these diseases under the head of sore throat, which does not
presuppose any limitation to individual anatomical structures.]SYNONYMS.--Sore throat; Angina.ETIOLOGY.--Acute pharyngitis may be idiopathic, deuteropathic,
traumatic, toxic, or parasitic.The predisposing cause may be
diathetic, as scrofula, rheumatism, gout, and syphilis; it may be a
depression of the vital powers from any cause, such as continued
exposure to foul air or impure water, improper diet or sedentary
occupations.There exists in some individuals a predisposition to
"catching cold," independent of any cachexia.Pharyngitis may occur at
any age, but is more frequent in the young.One attack increases
subsequent liability to the disease.The exciting cause is usually exposure to cold and damp.Hence the
disease is more frequent at the seasons when these conditions prevail
or when sudden changes of temperature are taking place.Sudden chilling
of the body when overheated may occasion it in warm weather; for
instance, a plunge into the ocean while covered with perspiration.The
ulcerative variety, when not due to syphilis or tuberculosis, is
usually of septic origin, and is apt to occur in the debilitated
especially.The gangrenous form, which is rare, results from profound
blood-poisoning.The herpetic or membranous variety may be due to
disturbance of the trophic nervous system, and has been attributed to
mental emotion (Feron), to uterine disturbances (Bertholle), to the
contact of irritating substances and to miasmatic or fetid exhalations
(Peter).It prevails principally during epidemics of diphtheria or of
scarlet fever, and may be of cryptogamic origin.The cryptogam of
thrush is sometimes developed on the mucous membrane of the pharynx,
either primitively or as an extension of the disease from the oral
cavity.Certain conditions of the {391} atmosphere give rise at times
to so-called epidemic pharyngitis.Paludal or malarial pharyngitis may
arise from the same causes as malarial fevers.Pharyngitis occurs in
the various exanthemata as an essential part of the morbid process, and
is always more or less prevalent during epidemics of measles or scarlet
fever.It occurs not rarely in typhoid fever, and is an occasional
complication of pneumonia, rheumatism, herpes, pemphigus, and other
acute affections.It is one of the complications of facial erysipelas,
but erysipelatous pharyngitis may occur primarily.Pharyngitis may be
excited by the inhalation of deleterious solid, fluid, and gaseous
substances in the atmosphere which act mechanically or chemically on
the mucous membrane.Many drugs administered in poisonous or even in
medicinal doses may give rise to an attack of inflammation of the
pharynx; among them may be cited preparations of mercury, antimony,
iodine, arsenic, copper, lead, zinc, silver, stramonium, belladonna,
and most of the Solanaceae.Traumatic pharyngitis results from
deglutition of boiling water or of acrid or caustic substances; from
inhalation of hot air, of steam, or of flame, and is most usually
associated with traumatic oesophagitis or with laryngitis.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Acute pharyngitis, as most commonly
encountered, is a simple erythematous inflammation of the mucous
membrane; the palate and tonsils being likewise involved.In most
instances there is simply an active hyperaemia which may subside in a
day or two.When more intense than this the mucous membrane of the
palate, tonsils, and pharynx becomes congested and swollen, uniformly
or in circumscribed areas.In some instances the submucous tissue of
the pharynx is greatly relaxed, and the mucous membrane lies upon the
substructure in thick folds.In others there is more or less oedema.The mucous follicles, especially those of the posterior palatine folds,
are frequently swollen.There is an abnormal though not excessive
secretion of viscid mucus, clear or turbid.The uvula is often swollen
or distended with serum, and its mucous membrane is relaxed.Sometimes
it appears as though pasted to one of the folds of the palate by viscid
secretion.The posterior palatine folds may be distended with serum,
and their arched appearance thus become obliterated.Resolution occurs
gradually in some instances, quickly in others.Phlegmonous pharyngitis exhibits a still higher grade of inflammation.It involves the submucous structures as well as the mucous membrane,
including at times the fibrous sheaths of the muscles.It may, in
addition, involve the palate, the tonsils, the base of the tongue, and
contiguous structures.Suppuration is common, usually circumscribed,
but not infrequently diffuse in patients of enfeebled constitution.One variety of the disease is essentially a deep-seated pharyngitis;
and this form almost always progresses to suppuration (suppurative
pharyngitis).The process becomes then, not infrequently, a diffuse
suppurative inflammation of the subpharyngeal connective tissue,
extending sometimes downward along the oesophagus, into which the pus
may be discharged by spontaneous rupture, with a result of permanent
stricture from irregular cicatrization.Sometimes the suppurative
process extends anteriorly beneath the cervical fascia, and the pus may
gravitate so as to occlude the air-passages, partly or completely, by
direct pressure; or in other instances the entrance of {392} the larynx
may become blocked by the tumefaction of the pharynx.When phlegmonous
pharyngitis is of traumatic origin, there will be more or less
destruction of the mucous membrane according to the nature of the
injury, whether accidental or designed, whether due to burn, scald,
inhalation of hot air or steam, or to deglutition of alkaline, acid, or
other corrosive substances.In these cases the morbid process is rarely
confined to the pharynx, but the larynx, the oesophagus, and even the
stomach, are liable to be involved.If regurgitation of hot air or of
caustic fluids takes place through the nasal passages, the injury will
of course involve those regions.Ulcerative pharyngitis is a low form of inflammation present in sore
throat, probably dependent upon septicaemia.The tonsils are somewhat
congested and swollen, and one or more white superficial ulcers form on
their surface, or on the palate, or on the pharynx.These ulcers are
generally round or oval, and vary greatly in size.When two or more
ulcers exist, they exhibit no tendency to confluence.Healing takes
place rapidly, usually without leaving any traces of the lesion.Membranous pharyngitis, or herpes of the pharynx, is one of the
infrequent phenomena of a not uncommon sore throat, which exhibits at
first a collection of small vesicles the size of millet-seeds or
larger, isolated here and there or clustered in groups on the palate
and uvula, less frequently on the tonsils.Herpes of the mouth and lips
sometimes coexists.These vesicles are surrounded by inflammatory
areolae.In rare instances they
disappear without trace after a day or two.Usually they soon undergo
rupture, sometimes within a few hours, so that small ulcers are left,
which almost immediately become covered with a grayish-white exudation.A number of patches will coalesce, forming limited sheets of false
membrane not unlike those of diphtheria.The disease is usually
confined to one side of the throat, the corresponding submaxillary or
cervical glands being affected moderately when at all involved.The
tonsil is swollen, and the mucous membrane of the palate and the
palatine folds is congested and often tumefied.There is an abnormal
secretion of viscid, ropy, turbid mucus.In a few days the ulcers heal
beneath the exudation, which becomes disintegrated and detached, the
inflammatory process subsiding by gradual resolution.Sometimes the
ulcers cicatrize without previous deposit of false membrane.Occasionally there are at longer or shorter intervals successive crops
of vesicles, which may or may not undergo ulceration.Gangrenous pharyngitis may supervene upon any form of pharyngitis, but
in the majority of instances its malignant character is inevitable from
the outset; so that some authors have even restricted the term
gangrenous to a form of sore throat characterized by primitive gangrene
of the pharyngeal mucous membrane originating independently of any
other malady.Whether an idiopathic disease, or whether it follows
scarlatina, measles, small-pox, dysentery, or enteric fever, it is
associated with that depraved condition of the system denominated
typhoid.At times it occurs in tuberculous phthisis.The initial
manifestations may be simply those of intense inflammation.The tongue
is covered with a dark creamy, pultaceous deposit consisting of
broken-down epithelium, pus-cells, bacteria, and molecular debris,
while similar masses are occasionally seen upon other mucous surfaces
of the mouth and throat.The tonsils, {393} palate, and pharynx are
livid and swollen, and sometimes oedematous.At an early period the
tonsils, the palatine folds, and the posterior wall of the pharynx
become covered with dark, ashy- ulcers with excavated edges.Sometimes these spots are black from the first, and appear slightly
elevated.These soon slough out with more or less of the surrounding
tissues, and the ulcers left are covered with sanious, ichorous, fetid
secretion.In some instances a delicate pseudo-membrane has been found
in the bed of the ulcer after death (Mackenzie).The destructive
process rapidly extends--sometimes to the oesophagus in one direction
or to the nares in the other.The larynx is less frequently implicated;
should it be attacked, oedema is liable to occur.Occasionally the
process is limited to the tonsil, and there is no pharyngitis at all.Erosion of the blood-vessels may give rise to fatal hemorrhage.In
those instances where the gangrene is circumscribed there are found,
post-mortem, depressed oval or circular patches from one-twentieth to
one-half an inch in diameter, varying in color from dark gray to
absolute black.The edges are of a brownish color and are
perpendicular.The bundles of muscular fibre are laid bare by
destruction of the mucous membrane and submucous connective tissue, but
as a rule escape implication of their substance.Similar patches have
been noted in the epiglottis and the upper part of the larynx as well
as in the mouth and pharynx--in some cases, indeed, in the trachea, the
lungs, the oesophagus, the stomach, and the intestines.Erysipelatous pharyngitis is usually an extension of erysipelas from
the facial integument, which may take place by the lips and mucous
membrane of the mouth, by the nasal fossae, by the Eustachian tube from
the tympanum and external ear, or by the nasal fossae from the
conjunctiva and eyelids through the lachrymal duct.When the disease
begins in the pharynx the order of communication may be reversed.The
pathological processes are the same as in cutaneous erysipelas.The
mucous membrane of the pharynx will be diffusely red or purplish and
shiny.Sometimes little bullae are formed and become ruptured, leaving
a patch of softened whitish-yellow tissue, which is sometimes torn from
the surface beneath by the act of coughing or of deglutition.The
inability to swallow is not due to swelling of the tissues, but to
actual paresis of the muscles, probably from interstitial infiltration,
but perhaps from implication of their substance.The cervical and
submaxillary glands are rarely involved.Erysipelatous pharyngitis
usually terminates by resolution, desquamation of the greater part of
the epithelium of the mucous membrane often taking place; but it may be
followed by abscess or by gangrene.Extension may take place to the
larynx, and oedema may follow.Exanthematous pharyngitis accompanies some cases of cutaneous
exanthemata.The pharyngitis of small-pox is occasioned by an eruption
upon the mucous membrane similar to that which appears on the skin.Often in advance of the cutaneous eruption it occupies the inside of
the cheeks, the palate, uvula, and pharynx; sometimes the larynx as
well.Maturation occurs more rapidly than upon the skin, and there is
more or less purulent infiltration of the submucous connective tissues.Ulceration of the larynx or trachea may ensue so severe in character as
to cause fatal termination by the local lesion.{394} In measles an eruption similar to the cutaneous manifestation
occupies the air-tract from nostril to bronchi rather than the
food-passages.The Eustachian tubes may be involved, and the
inflammation is sometimes propagated along the lachrymal duct.The
throat may be affected a day or two before the external integument.Small red points the size of a millet-seed or larger appear on the
palate, the tonsils, the posterior palatine folds, and the wall of the
pharynx.These disappear in a few days, though sometimes in bad cases
fibrinous exudation may accumulate.In other instances abscess or
ulceration takes place, chiefly in the larynx.The pharyngitis of scarlatina develops a day or two prior to the
cutaneous eruption, the mucous membrane of the palate, tonsils, and
pharynx being deeply congested, uniformly or in patches, with slight
papulous elevations here and there.In the course of a day or two an
opalescent or milky deposit, consisting chiefly of detached epithelium
and viscid mucus, is observed on the swollen palate and tonsils.In the
anginose variety the hue of the inflamed structures is more dusky.There is a pseudo-membranous deposit of a dirty-white, ash, or even
yellow color.It is not limited to the tonsils, but accumulates rather
on the palate, palatine folds, and posterior wall of the pharynx.The
mucous membrane beneath the patches is often ulcerated, and sometimes
gangrenous.There is much greater tumefaction of all the parts than in
simple scarlatina, the enlargement of the cervical and submaxillary
glands and the infiltration of contiguous connective tissue being so
great in some instances as to prevent the mouth from being opened.A
viscid and turbid secretion accumulates in the mouth.The nasal
secretions sometimes desiccate into firm crusts.Sometimes otitis media results from extension along the Eustachian
tube, and sometimes suppuration of the membrana tympani, suppurative
external otitis, or disease of the internal ear with extension to the
cerebrum.In malignant cases all the processes are aggravated.Ulceration or gangrene soon ensues, the pseudo-membranous deposit being
dark, almost black, from extravasated blood.Oedema of the uvula and
soft palate is liable to occur, and if the larynx be involved there may
be oedema of the epiglottis and ary-epiglottic folds.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Simple pharyngitis very often gives rise to but little
discomfort.There is usually more or less heat and dryness in the
parts, especially at first.There is some dysphagia, principally from
pain in swallowing, but in part from actual debility in the muscles of
deglutition.Hoarseness is not usual, and cough is infrequent if there
be no elongation of the uvula.Speech may be embarrassed by difficulty
of articulation.There is usually some febrile movement, with
acceleration of pulse and respiration.Some cases exhibit more intense
inflammatory action, with a corresponding aggravation of the
constitutional symptoms.The skin becomes markedly heated, the
body-temperature rises to 101 degrees F. or higher, the pulse reaching
100-120, in some instances 140, beats per minute, even in the adult.In that variety known as rheumatic sore throat there will be in
addition pain and soreness in the neck, back, and limbs, often severe,
and increased by motion.There will be great accumulation of saliva in
the mouth because of the intense pain in swallowing it.Speech, and
even respiration, may become painful.These manifestations are
frequently {395} followed by the ordinary phenomena of acute articular
rheumatism, but they may subside in a few days, leaving only a general
feeling of muscular soreness or slight stiffness in one or more of the
joints.In some cases of pharyngitis the cervical glands become swollen and
painful, but this is not common.In children the constitutional
disturbance is much greater than in adults.In malarial districts or in
subjects of malarial poisoning the manifestations may assume a periodic
character.Recovery takes place, as a rule, in from three to ten days.In many instances the local phenomena are most prominently manifested
on one side of the throat.There will then exist great liability to
similar involvement of the other side after convalescence of a day or
two, and without care and avoidance of exposure the second attack may
be far more severe than the first.The severe variety of pharyngitis denominated phlegmonous is often
ushered in with a decided chill, the phenomena of fever following
within twenty-four hours.The symptoms, both local and general, are of
much greater severity than in catarrhal pharyngitis, especially in
cases proceeding to suppuration.Paralysis of the palate and other paralyses may follow either of the
forms of sore throat just described.In
extremely rare cases it is an accompaniment of the disease.Superficial ulceration of the mucous membrane may occur in almost any
form of pharyngitis or of sore throat.Some authors have separated a
special form of ulcerative sore throat occurring in those enfeebled
from long exposure to unwholesome influences, such as nurses, hospital
attendants, etc., in whom the first symptom is pain in deglutition,
especially of saliva.The tongue is furred and the breath is offensive.There is loss of appetite, with general lassitude, feebleness of
circulation, and more or less elevation of temperature.The ulcerative sore throats of syphilis and of tuberculosis require
separate consideration.Common membranous pharyngitis frequently gives rise to but slight
symptoms, differing very little from those of other forms of
pharyngitis; but there may be high fever of sthenic or of asthenic
type, very often preceded by general malaise, sometimes by a decided
chill.The pain in deglutition and the local heat and dryness are
sometimes much greater than in the more ordinary forms of pharyngitis.The distress may extend into the ear, sometimes to the nasal passages,
in rare instances to the larynx.The disease lasts for a week or ten
days, usually terminating in recovery.In occasional instances, chiefly
in children, it terminates fatally by apnoea from extension of the
membrane into the larynx.The advent of gangrenous pharyngitis is sometimes indicated by sthenic
phenomena, but usually from the first it is marked by extreme
prostration, comparable in some instances to the collapse of cholera.The
skin, especially of the extremities, is cold and blue.The eye is
glassy, the countenance haggard.The pain, as a rule, is not severe,
sensation being benumbed.The disease is often accompanied by an
irregular erythematous cutaneous {396} eruption.The secretions and
excretions escape by the mouth and nose, and they are extremely fetid.There is indeed a peculiar odor, which once encountered can scarcely be
mistaken.If the lungs become affected there will be copious
haemoptysis.In some cases the tendency to hemorrhage is general, blood
oozing or gushing simultaneously from lungs, bowels, nose, and mouth,
and sometimes extravasating beneath the skin.Sphacelus ultimately
takes place at the points of ecchymosis.Diarrhoea, abundant and fetid,
due to invasion of the alimentary tract, often sets in before the
close, and may be regarded as a sure precursor of death.Death usually
takes place from syncope, intelligence often remaining unaffected to
the last.When these cases recover a horrible amount of deformity often
remains to mark the ravages of the disease.During cicatrization the
positions of contiguous parts become very much altered.The palate may
become adherent by its sides, and by more or less of its posterior
surface, to the pharynx, sometimes resulting in complete occlusion of
the nasal portion of the pharynx.The constitutional symptoms of erysipelas of the pharynx are those that
attend the usual manifestations of external erysipelas, the febrile
phenomena, epigastric pain, nausea, and so on, being increased in
severity.There will be great pain and difficulty of deglutition.If
there be serious oedema, symptoms of suffocation will occur.Laryngitis
will be indicated by pain referred to the larynx.The duration of the
disease varies from forty-eight hours to a week, rarely longer.Death
may occur within two or three days from oedema of the larynx or from
other causes frequently indiscernible.Resolution usually takes place
in those cases which recover.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis rests upon the conditions already described
under the heads of Pathology and Symptomatology.Under ordinary
circumstances it presents no difficulty, but during the prevalence of
epidemics of scarlatina or diphtheria even the mildest sore throat
demands careful attention and frequent inspection until the exclusion
of the graver maladies may be positively determined.The greatest
difficulty will present in cases of common membranous sore throat, for
it is sometimes impossible to make the differentiation from diphtheria,
especially as the vesicular stage is rarely seen.Sometimes, it is
said, it is possible to detect one or more of the small ulcers left by
the rupture of the vesicles; sometimes small isolated spots of false
membrane will by their transparency indicate recent formation, and by
their circular shape the previous existence of a vesicle (Peter, cited
by Mackenzie).The coexistence of cutaneous herpes is corroborative of
the diagnosis, but by no means an infallible sign.It must not be
forgotten in this connection that membranous sore throat may predispose
to an attack of diphtheria.In gangrenous sore throat the grayish-black
patches may be mistaken for the pseudo-membranes of diphtheria, but
their color is dark from the outset, while in diphtheria they become
dark only as the disease progresses.They always represent actual death
of the tissues, which is not an essential lesion of diphtheria.Swelling of the cervical glands is unusual.Finally, the characteristic
odor of gangrene is almost unmistakable.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is favorable in catarrhal pharyngitis and in
the milder forms of the phlegmonous, non-specific, ulcerative, and
{397} common membranous varieties.It is unfavorable in intense
suppurative pharyngitis, though cases often get well.In gangrenous
pharyngitis the prognosis is extremely grave, but recovery is not
impossible.In traumatic pharyngitis the prognosis will of course
depend upon the nature and extent of the injury, being not unfavorable
if this be confined to the pharynx, though even in limited cases there
may be stenosis or other ill results from cicatrization.Erysipelatous
pharyngitis is of grave prognosis when the result of extension of the
disease from the face, but recovery is frequent when the pharyngeal
disease is primary.TREATMENT.--The treatment of superficial pharyngitis is very simple.Unless the case be so light that no special medicinal treatment seems
advisable, the patient should be confined to a bed or lounge to secure
rest, a light coverlid being thrown over the body to equalize the heat
of the surface.If a meal has recently been taken, a mild emetic is
often of service to empty the stomach and save the labors of digestion.A gentle laxative or, if the patient be of costive habit, a saline
purge is indicated to facilitate the passage of matters already in the
intestinal canal.In cases of actual constipation a drastic cathartic
may be required.If there be considerable pain a small dose of morphine
may be advantageously combined with the aperient.If frequent pulse or
high temperature exist, especially in severe cases, tincture of
aconite, in doses of one or two drops every hour or two hours at first,
will be useful.As soon as any marked effect has been produced the
aconite may be discontinued or the intervals between administrations
lengthened.Locally, the free use of demulcent drinks, and of pellets
of ice when cold is agreeable, will relieve the pain in the throat and
sometimes repress excessive secretion.Cold compresses to the neck
anteriorly are often soothing, and sponging the entire surface of the
body with tepid water, acidulated or alcoholized, will allay the
intense heat of the skin.Very
often the emetic, rest, and regulation of diet will constitute the
entire treatment required.When the local distress is very great, astringent lozenges (catechu,
krameria) may be allowed to dissolve in the mouth, or sprays of weak
solutions of alum or of carbolic acid may be propelled upon the mucous
membrane.Tannin, potassium chlorate, and cupric sulphate are often
used for this purpose.When the uvula is elongated or oedematous it is
often a constant source of irritation and discomfort.Scarification to
give vent to pent-up blood or puncture to allow the escape of effused
serum will afford prompt relief.In phlegmonous pharyngitis the treatment will necessarily be more
active.Here an early emetic is of great service.A saline laxative may
be administered every three or four hours for a day or two, each dose
containing a drop or two of the tincture of aconite, with the addition
of morphine if indicated by pain.Drop-doses of aconite at more
frequent intervals sometimes serve a better purpose.Inhalation of
steam, or of steam from water impregnated with hops, chamomile-flowers,
paregoric, compound tincture of benzoin, juice of conium, or the
aqueous extract of opium, belladonna, or conium, will afford great
relief, as will the frequent projection of sprays of warm water, simple
or slightly aromatized with cologne-water or with toilet vinegar.Warm
and moist applications externally are often very soothing.Gargling
entails too much pain to be of {398} service, but medicated sprays may
be used of aqueous solutions (twenty grains to the ounce) of tannin,
alum, zinc sulphate, or cupric sulphate, care being taken to guard
against the swallowing of any of these drugs.Powders of alum, tannin,
krameria, etc., diluted with liquorice, acacia, bismuth, lycopodium,
and the like, may be blown upon the parts, and are often efficient.Sodium bicarbonate frequently affords relief.The topical application
of silver nitrate is rarely practicable and generally unnecessary.When the inflammatory process is of a higher grade and not likely to
yield to purely medicinal treatment, leeching or venesection may be
employed, but should not be resorted to without urgent reason.The
recognition of abscess is an indication for its immediate discharge by
incision or aspiration.In suppurative cases quinia and iron should be
given in large doses.The general treatment is like that of simple sore
throat.When liquid food cannot be swallowed, nourishment by enema is
requisite.Efforts at deglutition should be spared as much as possible,
and with this view medicines which can be administered by inhalation,
by enema, or by hypodermatic injection are to be preferred.In pharyngeal sore throat, whether catarrhal or phlegmonous, depending
on rheumatic or gouty diathesis, salicylic acid or the salicylates will
prove useful, either alone or in conjunction with other measures.The treatment of ulcerative pharyngitis is practically the same as that
recommended for phlegmonous pharyngitis.Antiseptic gargles may be used
locally, but as a rule the pain is so great that inhalations of
soothing vapors, as before recommended, will answer a better purpose.When the process is very acute fragments of ice will be most useful.Ice to the head will afford relief to pain.A little good wine, with
quinia and iron, comprises the medicinal measure requisite.Gangrenous pharyngitis calls for the most active and supporting
treatment.Eggs, milk, cream, nutritious soups (up to the limits of the
patient's capacity for swallowing, and by enema when necessary),
quinia, tincture of the chloride of iron, and alcohol in large doses,
are indicated.Agents to destroy
diseased tissue promptly and prevent the extension of the gangrenous
process, such as bromine, strong nitric or hydrochloric acid, acid
solution of mercuric nitrate, or caustic potassa, are to be thoroughly
applied, in the hope of exposing a healthy surface beneath which will
heal by granulation.When this treatment is unsuccessful or too
hazardous, as in cases where the blood-vessels are probably involved,
we can only palliate the symptoms by applying weak solutions of acids
and astringents, to which opium may be added, relying on constitutional
measures for restraining the destructive process.Washes and sprays of
potassium chlorate, eucalyptol, thymol, hydrogen peroxide, etc., or the
agents employed in common sore throat, are often agreeable to the
patient, and may be useful in restraining fetor, but they have no
direct therapeutic influence on the progress of the disease.If the
ulceration is extending into the vicinity of the great vessels of the
neck, measures for compression should be at hand, in the use of which
the nurse should be instructed, and preparations be made to facilitate
ligation of the carotid artery in an emergency.Tracheotomy may be
necessitated by oedema of the larynx.The deformities resulting from
gangrenous sore throat in cases that recover usually require surgical
treatment.{399} Traumatic pharyngitis must be treated on general principles.When
due to contact of caustic or corrosive substances, an attempt may be
made to neutralize the effects by a chemical antidote, but the
physician is usually summoned too late to accomplish much in this
manner.Morphine should be given in full doses, hypodermatically.Insufflations of morphine in powder, soothing inhalations, fragments of
ice in the mouth, cold compresses, and, where possible, oleaginous
drinks, are indicated to relieve topical distress.Rectal alimentation
should be resorted to where the difficulties of deglutition are at all
great.If symptoms of suffocation occur, tracheotomy must be performed.The results of traumatic pharyngitis require treatment according to
their special indications.Erysipelatous pharyngitis is to be treated by the administration, by
enema if necessary, of large doses of quinia, tincture of the chloride
of iron, brandy, and diffusible stimulants.Alimentation is to be kept
up by mouth or rectum, as may be necessary, with as much food as can be
given containing the most nutrition in the smallest bulk possible.Locally, a strong solution of silver nitrate (sixty grains to the
ounce) should be so applied as to cover a margin of unaffected
structures.Extension to the
larynx demands scarification or tracheotomy.When the diagnosis of common membranous sore throat can be made out
with certainty, there is nothing calling for special treatment, but the
treatment pursued in ordinary sore throat may be generally followed
with advantage.When fetor exists, as during the detachment of patches
of exudation, antiseptic and detergent sprays may be employed.Solutions of borax, boric acid, carbolic acid, potassium chlorate,
potassium permanganate, etc.In some individuals,
especially strumous and tuberculous subjects, there is a constitutional
proclivity to chronicity or to the recurrence of the peculiar
manifestations.More active measures will be required in these cases.Locally, frequent application of the dilute acids (_i.e._ every day or
two) affords the most satisfactory results.Internally, iron and
cinchona preparations should be administered.Opium in small doses has
a special application--not as a narcotic, but as a gentle stimulant or
nervous tonic.Nux vomica or arsenic may be employed for a similar
purpose.The diet should be highly nutritious and easily assimilable.Unnecessary exposure should be avoided, and supporting measures
generally, hygienic, as well as medicinal, should be persisted in.Membranous pharyngitis sometimes exhibits a tendency to phagedaena.The
treatment for gangrenous sore throat is then indicated.It may invite
an attack of diphtheria or the diagnosis may be in doubt.In that case
the prudent course is to treat it as diphtheria, but to avoid the
recommendation for diphtheria of some indifferent remedy, during the
exhibition of which a case of membranous sore throat has recovered.When extension to the larynx occurs threatening suffocation,
tracheotomy to avert death should be performed, as in croup or
diphtheria.The sore throats of the exanthemata, of typhoid fever, etc., are to be
treated on the general principles applicable to catarrhal or
phlegmonous pharyngitis.Oedema or tumefaction, as in malignant
scarlatina, of a sufficient extent to obstruct respiration, is to be
relieved by scarification, and when this is inefficient resort must be
had to tracheotomy.The sore {400} throats caused by drugs are to be
treated first by removal of the cause, and afterward according to the
special indications.DEFINITION.--An acute ulcerative pharyngitis due to infiltration with
miliary and granular tubercle and the consequent destructive
metamorphosis.SYNONYMS.--Acute tuberculous sore throat, Acute tuberculous
pharyngitis, Tuberculosis of the pharynx, Phthisis of the pharynx.HISTORY.--Only of late years has tuberculosis of the pharynx been
distinctly recognized as a tuberculous disease.The tubercular sore
throat or pharyngitis described by Green of New York, and other authors
following him, is an affection of entirely different character, and not
tuberculosis at all.The chronic tuberculous sore throat of advanced
tuberculosis is likewise a different affection clinically, though of
the same histological character.To the late Isambert[2] of Paris belongs the credit of definitively
recognizing the specificity of acute tuberculous sore throat or
pharyngitis, and to him likewise the credit of indicating its
differentiation from syphilitic sore throat, with which it had long
been confounded.To B. Fraenkel of Berlin[3] is likewise due the credit
of an accurate comprehension and elucidation of the clinical and
histological pathology of this disease.[Footnote 2: _Annales des Maladies de l'Oreille, du Larynx, etc._, vol.162; _Conferences cliniques sur les Maladies du Larynx et
des premieres Voices_, Paris, 1877, p.Woch._, Nov., 1876; _London Med.ETIOLOGY.--Acute tuberculous pharyngitis is quite a rare disease.Its
predisposing causes, in all probability, are identical with those of
acute tuberculosis.Its exciting cause, in some cases at least, is some
unusual exposure to cold and wet.It is not certain that the throat is
affected before the lungs; but if this be the case, it is certain that
the lungs become affected soon afterward.The disease occurs in young
children, Isambert having recorded a case at four and a half years of
age, but it is much more frequent in adolescents and young adults.It
is impossible, as yet, to assign the reason why the pharynx rather than
other structures undergoes tubercularization in these exceptional cases
of pharyngitis.Syphilis sometimes coexists in the adult certainly, and
it may be questioned whether hereditary taint may not be an important
factor in determining tuberculosis in a region so frequently ravaged by
syphilis.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--The local disease is essentially an
ulcerative pharyngitis or pharyngo-laryngitis, as may be, extremely
rapid in its progress, and terminating fatally within a few weeks, or a
few months at farthest.The ulcerative process usually begins on the
palatine folds or else on the lateral wall of the pharynx, thence
extending to the palatine folds, soft palate, uvula, and hard palate in
one direction, and toward the posterior wall of the pharynx in the
other.The uvula sometimes becomes thickened into a club-shaped,
gelatinous-looking mass, somewhat characteristic.Previous to
ulceration the mucous membrane is subjected to abundant infiltration
with miliary and granular tubercle just beneath the epithelial layer.Macroscopically, these infiltrated portions of {401} tissue present as
irregular chagrinated groups of patches, generally confluent, which
when abundant or prominent are liable to be confounded with syphilitic
patches.Just beneath the surface the collections of tubercle project
as little semi-transparent grayish nodules, in size and form recalling
the appearance of vermicelli-seeds or fish-eggs.They steadily increase
in volume and in number, lose their translucency, and finally undergo
disintegration into lenticular ulcers with caseous bottoms and
undermined hyperaemic edges.The ulcers extend steadily in periphery
and in depth, and coalesce by necrosis of intervening mucous membrane.Polypoid excrescences springing from the beds of the ulcers have been
described (Fraenkel).Collateral tumefaction takes place in some
instances, due, it is stated (Isambert), to infiltration of the tissues
by a gelatinous material, possibly a mucoid degeneration of the
connective tissue.The usual tendency of the disease, however, is to
incite atrophic metamorphosis of the adjacent tissues not undergoing
actual tubercularization.In many instances extension to the upper
portion of the larynx takes place; in some, extension to the vault of
the pharynx.Extension to the oesophagus, as has been remarked by
Mackenzie, and to the posterior nasal outlets, has not been noticed.Enlargement of the cervical lymphatic glands is quite common.Microscopic examination of the tissues of the pharynx has revealed
profuse infiltration with round cells--most frequently in the mucous
membrane and submucous connective tissue only, occasionally in the
muscular fibres likewise.The muscles sometimes undergo the fatty
degeneration, and the mucous glands both fatty and colloid
degeneration.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The chief and characteristic subjective symptom is
extreme pain in swallowing (odynphagia)--pain much more intense than in
other morbid processes in the same locality, and inexplicable by the
extent of the visible disease merely.Cough, adynamic fever, rapid emaciation, and so on are
present, as in acute tuberculosis generally.DIAGNOSIS.--It cannot be stated that the diagnosis is easy.The two
distinguishing characteristics are the exquisite pain in swallowing and
the absence of pus from the surface of the ulcers.The aspect of the
ulcers differs, furthermore, from that of syphilitic ulcers by the lack
of opalescence and of inflammatory areolae.The gray nodules in the
affected mucous membrane are different from what is observed in any
other disease.These points, with the history of the attack, the family
history, and the probable evidence of tuberculosis in the lungs, will
usually serve to discriminate the disease from syphilis, for which it
is most likely to be mistaken.In cases of doubt ophthalmoscopic
examination of the choroid and iris may reveal tubercle.The bacillus
tuberculosis has been found in the detritus from the ulcers (Guttman,
Gurovitch).The fact must not be ignored that syphilitic and
tuberculous pharyngitis may exist together.Febrile symptoms, typhoidal
in type, in a case of supposed syphilitic sore throat will most likely
be indicative of tuberculosis.PROGNOSIS.--The disease is rapidly fatal, apparently inevitably so.An
exceptional case has been recorded, however (Cadier[4]), living {402}
several years after the diagnosis had been made by Isambert and many
others.[Footnote 4: _Annales des Maladies de l'Oreille, du Larynx, etc._,
July, 1883, p.Death takes place by asthenia in from six weeks to six months;
occasionally within a fortnight from the apparent onset.TREATMENT.--The little that can be accomplished in the way of treatment
is limited to improving the diet and hygienic surroundings, with the
administration of such constitutional remedial agents as are given in
acute tuberculosis, and palliative treatment of the local suffering.For the latter purpose insufflations of iodoform and morphine are to be
recommended, two or three grains of the former with one-fourth to
one-half grain of the latter, once a day or oftener.Such insufflations
should be preceded by douches or sprays of sodium borate or
bicarbonate, to rid the parts of mucus and detritus.A drop or two of
carbolic acid, of eucalyptol, or of a solution of thymol may be
advantageously added for purposes of disinfection.Solution of hydrogen
peroxide (2 per cent.or weaker) is a very valuable agent for use in
spray or douche.It may be rendered more agreeable by the addition of a
few drops of some balsamic.When swallowing is impracticable, nourishment by enema is indicated,
with forced feeding by means of a catheter passed through the larger of
the two nasal passages into the oesophagus.DEFINITION.--A chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
pharynx, whether implicating the glandular structures or not, and
commonly associated with similar chronic inflammation of contiguous
structures.SYNONYMS.--Chronic sore throat, Chronic angina.Chronic pharyngitis presents in two varieties: 1, simple chronic
pharyngitis (chronic catarrhal pharyngitis, chronic catarrhal sore
throat), in which the disease does not affect, or affects but slightly,
the glandular structures of the mucous membrane; and 2, follicular
pharyngitis (granular pharyngitis, clergyman's sore throat), in which
groups of the follicular glands of the mucous membrane are enlarged,
and sometimes inflamed.ETIOLOGY.--The predisposing causes of chronic catarrhal pharyngitis are
those enumerated under the head of the acute form of the affection, and
the exciting causes are repeated attacks of the acute malady.The predisposing causes of chronic follicular pharyngitis are
overcrowding, and sedentary occupations; and the exciting causes are
chiefly improper use of the voice and exposure to local irritations,
mechanical and chemical, including too free use of condiments, tobacco,
and alcohol, gormandizing, and the alternations of hot food, cold
drinks, ices, and hot drinks at meals.It is not so often a direct
sequel of attacks of acute sore throat as a result of prolonged
catarrhal pharyngitis; and sometimes it appears to be chronic, so to
speak, from the outset.Both forms of chronic pharyngitis are frequently associated with
chronic inflammations of the mucous membranes elsewhere, particularly
of the nasal passages and of the stomach, and, to a less extent, of the
genito-urinary apparatus; the entire train of phenomena, in some
instances, {403} being due to passive congestion dependent upon
impaired cardiac power.Similarly, it presents at times as one of the
accompaniments of exophthalmic goitre.It is often associated with
phthisis, and is sometimes found in phthisical subjects prior to the
detection of the pulmonary disease.It is sometimes coincident with
chronic cutaneous eruptions, and may depend on the same causes, whether
dietetic or nervous.Uterine disturbances may give rise to chronic pharyngitis, probably by
reflex nervous influence, and so do other chronic and dispiriting
complaints.In like manner, depression of spirits and impairment of
bodily vigor from domestic, financial, and social chagrin provoke a
train of phenomena in which chronic pharyngitis may be a prominent
manifestation.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Simple chronic pharyngitis is a chronic
catarrhal inflammation of the mucous membrane and submucous connective
tissue of the pharynx, with irregular hyperplasia of all the
histological elements, chiefly affecting the epithelial layers and the
most superficial strata of the submucosa.The pharynx, the posterior
surface of the palate, and the pharyngo-palatine folds are the
structures most generally implicated, but the glosso-palatine folds,
the base of the tongue, and even the anterior surface of the palate,
are sometimes involved.At an advanced stage of the affection extension
may take place to the vault of the pharynx and the posterior nasal
outlets, and in occasional instances to the larynx.The initial hyperaemia of diffuse congestion finally leads to permanent
dilatation of tracts of capillaries varying in area and mode of
distribution, sometimes recalling the territorial outlines upon a map.The mucous membrane is bright red in color and irregularly thickened,
sometimes into prominent welts or folds.Hypersecretion takes place over the entire diseased surface, and there
is considerable desquamation of turbid epithelium, which sometimes
accumulates in masses.Glands are dilated and hypertrophied here and
there, but not in every instance, or if so indiscernibly, at least, to
the naked eye.In some cases enlarged follicles are very prominent in the
infra-tonsillar space, between the anterior and posterior palatine
folds, and along the lateral walls of the pharynx down toward the base
of the tongue.The circumvallate papillae may also be enlarged, and the
fungiform papillae are sometimes very prominent and deeply congested.In the folliculous variety of the disease the hyperplasia affects
chiefly the mucous glands and follicles, isolated or in groups,
together with zones of connective tissue surrounding them and the
epithelial investment of the mucous membrane in their immediate
neighborhood.A number of small projections, from the size of pinheads
to that of peas, mostly somewhat hemispheroidal, sometimes ellipsoidal
or quite irregular in configuration, stud the pharynx irregularly.When
clustered they are more apt to occupy the lateral angles of the
pharynx.In this locality indeed the chains of glands and their
enveloping mucous membrane sometimes present in longitudinal ridges
which simulate additional or adventitious post-palatine folds.The
projections are usually opaque, deeper in color than the surrounding
congested mucous membrane, and velvety from loss of squamous
epithelium.Sometimes they are translucent, as if filled with colloid
material, probably retained and degenerated secretion.{404} Very often
their contents undergo caseous degeneration, and sometimes even
calcification--a variety designated tubercular by Green, Gibb, and
others, but far different histologically from true tuberculosis of the
pharyngeal glands, which does occur occasionally in phthisical
patients.Delicate red lines of engorged capillaries usually surround the base of
these projections.There is great disposition to the accumulation of
viscid, discolored mucus on the surface of the mucous membrane.As the
disease progresses all the processes become more widely extended, until
finally nearly the entire pharyngeal and oral mucous membrane becomes
involved.The soft palate becomes relaxed and the uvula thickened and
elongated, sometimes to an extreme degree.Chronic folliculous
tonsillitis exists in many cases.When either form of chronic pharyngitis continues for a long while
unchecked, there may result atrophy of the glandular structures and
epithelial elements generally, giving rise to pharyngitis sicca or
atrophic pharyngitis (so-called dry catarrh).There is then but scanty
secretion, and this dries rapidly upon the surface of the thin mucous
membrane, which becomes rough, inflexible, and glazed.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Cough, expectoration, impairment of voice, dysphagia,
and uncomfortable sensations in the throat present in various degrees
according to the stage of the disease and the temperament of the
patient.Hemming and hawking to clear the throat often become habitual,
especially in cases associated with chronic internal rhinitis, being
provoked in many instances by secretory products which drop into the
pharynx or glide along its walls.It is sometimes important to
distinguish this habit from the cough of laryngeal or bronchial
irritation.In cases associated with chronic gastritis the loss of appetite and
consequent emaciation accompanying the symptoms of pharyngitis
sometimes lead friends of the patient to a mistaken diagnosis of
consumption; and when, as is not infrequent, chronic bronchitis also
coexists, even the physician may be misled.In many instances of chronic folliculous pharyngitis evidently of long
standing, and accidentally discovered at times to the surprise of the
patient, no history of the classical group of symptoms can be obtained.DIAGNOSIS.--The diffuse congestion of the mucous membrane and the
absence of marked involvement of the follicles are, with the history of
the case, the main discriminative features in the diagnosis of chronic
catarrhal pharyngitis.The regular or irregular masses of tissue
projecting beyond the general surface of the mucous membrane are the
distinguishing characteristics of chronic folliculous pharyngitis.The
vascular network of dilated capillaries mapping the surface into
numerous irregular small areas of different sizes is not peculiar to
either variety.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of chronic catarrhal pharyngitis is favorable
when no irremediable malady of body or mind exists.Much depends on the
practicability of improving the dietetic and hygienic environment of
the patient.The prognosis is likewise good in chronic folliculous
pharyngitis under favorable surroundings, so far as relief from
suffering is concerned; but the follicles, when long hypertrophied, so
rarely undergo absorption under any treatment that their destruction
becomes necessary--quite a different thing from their cure.The
enlarged follicles once destroyed, the collateral irritative
inflammation caused by {405} them usually subsides.Impairment of
voice, a result of the disease, may be remedied in young subjects, who
will learn to use the voice with the abdomen in distension; but much
improvement cannot be expected in old subjects and in those in whom the
disease has been produced by improper methods of declamation, which are
beyond correction.TREATMENT.--In chronic catarrhal pharyngitis constitutional treatment
adapted to the diathetic condition is required in the first instance.Alkaline laxatives are usually indicated by the irregularly coated
tongue and the tendency to costiveness.These may be advantageously
administered in half a pint of hot water one hour or so before meals,
with a view of washing the stomach free from accumulations of mucus,
epithelium, and retained products of digestion and decomposition, so
that its condition may be improved for the reception and digestion of
the ensuing meal.Topical medication of the throat is likewise
requisite.Mild astringents are
applicable, but strong astringents are often actually injurious.Silver
nitrate and cupric sulphate in stick or strong solution should not be
used; but sprays of dilute solutions (one or two grains to the ounce of
distilled water), twice or thrice a day, are often of service.Zinc
sulphate (five grains to the ounce) may be used in the same manner.Zinc chloride (ten grains to the ounce), carefully applied to the
surface daily with a broad brush or soft cotton wad, is a useful
remedy.Tannin in ether sometimes answers admirably, a delicate film
being left for some time on the surface.Solutions of bismuth nitrate
or borate in glycerin applied locally often relieve uneasiness.A broad
flat brush is the best instrument for making these applications, placed
low in the pharynx so as to paint the entire posterior wall by a single
movement from below upward.For home use, sprays, three or four times a day, of tar-water,
containing five or ten grains to the ounce, of sodium borate or
bicarbonate, or sodium, potassium, or ammonium chloride, or sodium,
potassium, or ammonium iodide, are soothing and efficacious, and much
superior to gargles.Demulcent lozenges
(gelatin, acacia, althaea, glycyrrhiza) slowly dissolved in the mouth
often relieve topical discomfort.Much more active treatment is required in chronic folliculous
pharyngitis.In recent cases of moderate
intensity the ordinary treatment for the catarrhal variety sometimes
suffices.In cases of long standing strong solutions of silver nitrate
(sixty to one hundred and twenty grains to the ounce), carefully
applied with the broad flat brush twice or thrice a week, are often of
great remedial effect.Iodine (one drachm to the ounce of glycerin),
alone or in combination with equal parts of carbolic acid, applied
daily, may be serviceable in cases unimproved by the silver nitrate.Dilatation of the capillaries may sometimes be benefited by
applications of ergot (fluid extract) or ergotin (grs.Enlarged follicles of long standing are rarely amenable to
astringent and alterant topical treatment.The agent to be used is a matter of indifference as a rule, and,
according to the taste or resources of the practitioner, may be the
solid silver nitrate, caustic potash, London paste, zinc chloride,
{406} or the incandescent cautery, whether heated by fire, hot naphtha,
or electricity.The sprays and lozenges already mentioned are useful in this variety of
pharyngitis also.They may be medicated with sedative ingredients
according to indications for the relief of pain and discomfort.In cases resisting the plan of treatment suggested mercuric chloride
may be successfully used, both internally (gr.1/16 two or three times
a day) and in spray, a drachm or less night and morning (one grain to
four ounces).External counter-irritation by repeated blistering over
the larynx and under the angles of the jaws is useful in some
instances.During treatment the voice should be used as sparingly as
practicable.In chronic atrophic pharyngitis the treatment, constitutional and
local, should be such as favors secretion from mucous
membranes--internally, cubeb, pyrethrum, calamus, xanthoxylum,
jaborandi, ammonium chloride; topically, sprays, four or more times a
day, of hot water, glycerin and water, ammonium chloride.Patients
sleeping with the mouth open should wear an apparatus, extemporized or
made to order, to keep the lower jaw closed in sleep.DEFINITION.--A specific inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
pharynx or of the mucous membrane and submucous tissues, the result of
syphilis, and often associated with like disease in contiguous
structures.SYNONYMS.--Pharyngitis syphilitica, Pharyngitis specifica, Syphilitic
sore throat, Syphilis of the pharynx.ETIOLOGY.--Contamination by syphilitic virus is the sole cause, whether
by direct inoculation or by systemic poisoning, hereditary or acquired.Direct inoculation proceeds from primary sores on the lips, tongue,
cheek, and hard palate, themselves the result of actual contact with
sores in other individuals.Initial sores have been seen upon the
tonsils, palatine folds, pharynx, and even the epiglottis.Direct
inoculation from secondary sores may be communicated by the
tooth-brush, blow-pipe, pipe-stem, trumpet, mouth-piece of
feeding-bottle, pap-boat, or similar article previously used by an
infected individual.Uncleansed surgical instruments convey the disease
in like manner.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Syphilitic pharyngitis--or, more
strictly speaking, syphilitic sore throat--occurs in all varieties,
primary, secondary, tertiary, and hereditary.Secondary manifestations
are the most frequent, and primary sores the most infrequent.The
primary sore is soft in some instances, and hard in others.Phagedaenic
ulceration may ensue.Secondary manifestations are usually bilateral,
and often symmetric in configuration and distribution.They appear from
a few weeks to a few months after infection, and are among the most
frequent early manifestations of secondary syphilis.The inflammatory
process begins in erythema, usually diffuse, often punctated, sometimes
in patches.It extends from above downward more frequently than in the
reverse direction, but may spread in any direction.The lesion
commences upon the soft palate and tonsils more frequently than {407}
on the pharynx, but may commence in any portion of the oro-guttural
cavity.Tumefaction ensues, with lividity of the surface.The
epithelial cells become distended; the resulting opalescence, somewhat
characteristic, eventually subsides into a central opacity, the true
mucous patch or condyloma latum.Mucous patches vary in size from mere
specks to large irregular surfaces, often the result of coalescences.They sometimes become red and granular and covered with purulent
products.Microscopically (Cornil), they consist of thickened
epithelium upon a base of proliferated lymphoid cells, which often
infiltrate the deeper tissues extensively.They may disappear in the
course of a few weeks by resolution and absorption.Sometimes
suppuration occurs in small superficial abscesses which discharge upon
the surface.Several abscesses discharging simultaneously in
coalescence, an extensive ulcer may result, which, in repair, leaves a
cicatricial trace of its site.Flat and circular bluish-white patches,
due to thickening of epithelium, appear after the first year of
constitutional syphilis, and may exist in association with the true
mucous patch.They bleed readily on rough handling, but rarely undergo
ulceration.Tertiary manifestations may present within a few months after infection
or not until many years.Gummatous infiltration of the connective
tissue, diffused or circumscribed (syphiloma), follows diffuse or
localized erythema, and then the gummata break down, discharge by
ulceration, and leave deep-seated irregular ulcers with undermined
edges and surrounded with inflammatory areolae.These manifestations
are much more frequent in the palate than in the pharynx, and the
ulcerative process often destroys the uvula and large portions of the
palate and palatine folds.When the pharynx and posterior surface of
the palate are both ulcerated, cicatricial adhesions are sometimes
inevitable, and thus serious stricture of the suprapalatine pharyngeal
canal may ensue.The lesion may be quite limited in extent or may
involve the entire pharynx.The ravages may become sufficiently
extensive to involve the vertebra and the skull or to perforate the
large blood-vessels.Cicatrization in the pharynx is vertical or
stellate as the rule, and the peculiar pallid lustre of the cicatrices
is quite characteristic of the syphilitic lesion.In many instances
secondary and tertiary manifestations commingle.Ulceration is then
more likely to extend superficially than in depth.Hereditary manifestations pursue much the same course as tertiary
manifestations.They usually occur before puberty, but are occasionally
delayed until after maturity.Deferred tertiary and late hereditary
manifestations sometimes present the characteristic ulceration of the
commingled secondary and tertiary disease; and this form of ulceration
is often incorrectly attributed to scrofulosis and to lupus.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, COMPLICATIONS, AND SEQUELAE.--The
subjective symptoms of syphilitic pharyngitis are those of erythematous
and ulcerative pharyngitis of like grade, except that there is very
little pain.The course is chronic unless specific treatment be
instituted, when prompt repair may be expected unless the general
health has been much undermined.The
manifestations subside under treatment, and recur if it is not
sufficiently prolonged.Complications occur with similar manifestations
of syphilis in adjacent or contiguous or distant structures, as may be.The most frequent sequel in neglected cases is cicatricial stricture.{408} DIAGNOSIS.--Bilateral inflammation in symmetric distribution is
very characteristic of syphilis.Irregular ulcers with undermined
borders and surrounded by inflammatory areolae are similarly
characteristic.Acknowledged history of syphilis or the detection of
syphilitic manifestations elsewhere serves to confirm the diagnosis.In
cases of doubt a few days' treatment with specific remedies in large
doses will almost invariably serve to clear up the diagnosis.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis as to life is good unless the ulcerations
have become so extensive as to threaten perforation into blood-vessels
or the patient has become greatly debilitated.The prognosis as to
freedom from cicatricial adhesions and stricture is not good in the
presence of lesions which have destroyed large territories of tissue,
even under very careful management.TREATMENT.--Specific medicines in positive doses constitute the most
effectual treatment.Extensive ulcerative tertiary and hereditary lesions are peculiarly
susceptible to large doses (30 to 90 or more grains daily) of potassium
iodide, under the influence of which they often heal without any local
applications whatever.As soon as a positive impression has been
produced the dose may be diminished.The parts should be kept clean and
comfortable by periodic douching with sprays of alkaline solutions, or,
what is still more serviceable, with a ten-volume solution of hydrogen
peroxide diluted with one or more parts of distilled water.The best
local application to the edges of the pharyngeal syphilitic ulcers is
the solid cupric sulphate.Chromic acid (1:8) is a serviceable local
stimulant to indolent ulcers.Necrosed fragments of bone should be
removed.Should any impediment to respiration take place during
administration of the iodides, oedema of the larynx may be suspected,
and should be looked for.Professional supervision is requisite for
many months after the lesions have healed.Cicatricial sequelae of
stricture require surgical interference.{409}

DISEASES OF THE OESOPHAGUS.BY J. SOLIS COHEN, M.D.DEFINITION.--Inflammation of the oesophagus.SYNONYMS.--Inflammatory dysphagia, Inflammation of the gullet.Oesophagitis may be acute or chronic.Either form may be idiopathic,
deuteropathic, or traumatic.DEFINITION.--Acute inflammation of the gullet.SYNONYM.--Oesophagitis acuta.HISTORY.--Until the publication in 1829 of a thesis by J. T. Mondiere
entitled _Recherches sur l'Inflammation de l'Oesophage, et sur quelques
points de l'anatomie pathologique de cet organ_, little study had been
devoted to acute inflammation of the oesophagus; and since that time
Mondiere's researches have been largely utilized by subsequent writers.It has been taken for granted that Galen's mention of pain in the
oesophagus[1] has indicated his recognition of the disease.Fernel[2]
mentions phlegmon of the oesophagus; Honkoop[3] describes inflammation
of the oesophagus; J. P. Frank[4] describes an oesophageal angina; and
Joseph Frank[5] seems to have been the first author to use the term
oesophagitis.Since the publication of Mondiere's monograph the
principal systematic descriptions have been those of Hamburger[6] Von
Oppolzer[7] Zenker and Ziemssen[8] Luton,[9] and Bernheim.[10]

Paris, 1877, vol.Encyclopediques des Sciences medicales_, Paris,
1880, vol.ETIOLOGY.--Acute oesophagitis is quite a rare disease.It occurs
idiopathically, deuteropathically, and traumatically--traumatically far
the most {410} frequently, and idiopathically least frequently.It is
doubtful whether any special predisposing causes of oesophagitis can be
indicated.Nevertheless, infancy has been so cited by some authors
(Mondiere, Billard, Behier, and Steffan).Slight idiopathic
catarrhal--or rather erythematous--oesophagitis occasionally ensues in
the adult from sudden or prolonged exposure to cold and moisture, and
under such circumstances may sometimes be regarded as rheumatic in
origin, subsiding after a few hours' continuance, to be immediately
succeeded by manifestations of articular rheumatism, acute or subacute,
as in some analogous examples of rheumatic pharyngitis.Exceptionally,
severe oesophagitis may follow a simple cold (Noveene, cited by
Bernheim), or presents as an extension of sore throat, the result of
cold (Graves[11]).It is induced also by the habitual use of very hot
drinks and food, and occasionally by the opposite extremes, the use of
very cold articles of food and drink (Mondiere, Bourguet, Hamburger).The abuse of tobacco and alcohol is alleged as quite a frequent cause
of mild oesophagitis, usually occurring, however, in association with
pharyngitis from the same causes.Journ._, 1836-37, No.172, and
_Clinical Lectures_, Dublin, 1864, p.Oesophagitis sometimes follows the deglutition of irritating medicines
or moderately caustic poisonous substances not sufficiently acid to
produce veritable traumatic oesophagitis.Mercury, codeina, and
particularly tartar emetic, are cited as capable of exciting
oesophagitis.Large doses of tartar emetic, as formerly administered in pneumonia
(Laennec[12]), sometimes produced a peculiar form of pustulous
oesophagitis, not unlike the pustulous oesophagitis sometimes occurring
as part of the local manifestations of small-pox.[Footnote 12: _Traite de l'Auscultation medicale, etc._, Paris, 1837,
vol.560, illustrated; Laboulbene, _Anatomie pathologique_, and
_Nouveau Dict.370, illustrated;
Von Oppolzer, _op.Deuteropathic catarrhal oesophagitis occurs sometimes as an extension
of catarrhal pharyngitis on the one hand, and of catarrhal gastritis on
the other.It also occurs in scarlet fever, measles, and typhus fever.It is likewise consecutive to the various diseases and surgical lesions
of the tube itself.Parasitic oesophagitis occurs as an extension of
parasitic stomatitis or thrush.Deuteropathic circumscribed phlegmonous
oesophagitis is sometimes produced by extension of inflammation from
softened caseous bronchial glands at the bifurcation of the trachea,
and by pressure from mediastinal tumors, aneurism of the aorta, etc.Pseudo-membranous oesophagitis is almost always deuteropathic.It has
been encountered chiefly in association with pseudo-membranous
pharyngitis or diphtheria, and with croupous pneumonia, but likewise in
enteric and typhus fever, in cholera and in dysentery, in measles,
scarlatina, and small-pox, in nephritis, tuberculosis, carcinoma, and
pyaemia.In a case of hysteria, to be mentioned later, the entire epithelial
coat of two-thirds of the oesophagus was discharged by emesis.In this
respect the local disease--in that instance at least--resembles
pseudo-membranous enteritis.Traumatic oesophagitis is produced by the deglutition of corrosive
substances, which destroy portions of the mucous membrane in their
passage or excite a suppurative inflammatory process, or is produced by
the {411} passage of foreign bodies of sharp and irregular contour, or
by the passage of surgical appliances, whether used for actual
operations or for explorations merely.In rare cases traumatic oesophagitis is the result of wounds with
firearms or other weapons.Phlegmonous oesophagitis may be the result of disease or injury of the
interior of the oesophagus, or of its external coat by extension of
disease from tissues surrounding it.Foreign bodies, arrested in the
oesophagus or wounding it in their passage to the stomach; injuries
from surgical appliances, exploratory or operative, employed in
treatment for foreign bodies in the tube or in cases of stricture and
morbid growth; and chemical irritants swallowed by accident or
design,--are the chief causes in the former class of cases; but
pustulous and pseudo-membranous oesophagitis must likewise be regarded
as occasional causes.The causes operating upon the exterior of the
tube primarily are suppurative laryngitis and tracheitis, tumefaction
and softening of bronchial and tracheal lymphatic glands, and caries of
the spine.Isolated cases have been attributed to emboli in connection
with valvular diseases of the heart (Parenski, cited by Daton), and to
fits of anger (J. Frank and Rigal, cited by Daton).In certain cases
the cause is unassignable, and is then usually attributed to some
dyscrasia, syphilis in particular.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Acute oesophagitis presents both as a
diffused inflammation and a circumscribed process, annular or irregular
in contour.It does not appear from the post-mortem records consulted
that any special portion of the tube is particularly liable to
circumscribed inflammation, though the lower fourth appears most
frequently affected.The inflammatory process may be simply superficial
or erythematous, catarrhal or desquamative (Zenker and Ziemssen), or it
may be phlegmonous, and thus interest the submucous tissues as well as
the mucous membrane.This may terminate in abscess or in diffuse
suppuration with ulcerations.Both in diphtheria and in croupous pneumonia, pseudo-membranous
oesophagitis is an occasional complication; and the same process is
said to have been observed in typhus fever, measles, scarlatina,
cholera, pyaemia, dysentery, tuberculosis, and carcinoma (Von Oppolzer
and others).Pustulous oesophagitis occurs in small-pox, and occasionally follows
the use of tartar emetic in large doses.The morbid anatomy of acute idiopathic oesophagitis, though usually
detailed in descriptions of the disease, must be known by theory much
more than by demonstration, few examples coming under the inspection of
the pathologist in time to distinguish the progressive stages of the
inflammatory process, and still fewer being revealed by oesophagoscopy
during life.The lesions most frequently observed post-mortem are
thickening, softening, and desquamation of the epithelium, with very
scanty accumulations of viscid mucus here and there upon the mucous
membrane.The mucous membrane is seen to have suffered numbers of
pinhead or slightly larger superficial circumscribed erosions, rounded
or longitudinal, and likewise a few actual ulcerations.The follicles
of the mucous membrane are often both swollen and hypertrophied,
reaching the size of peas, especially in the upper portion of the tube.The desquamation of the epithelium usually takes place in small {412}
patches.One case, however, has been recorded (Birch-Hirschfeld[13]) in
which a young hysterical woman, after suffering three days with acute
oesophagitis without assignable cause, ejected by emesis a membranous
tube two-thirds of the entire length of the oesophagus, and shown under
examination to have been the completely detached epithelial coat of the
oesophagus, wholly normal in its upper layers and infiltrated with
agglomerated round cells in its lower layers.It was supposed that the
mass had been detached in consequence of acute subepithelial
suppuration.[Footnote 13: _Lehrbuch der pathologische Anatomie_, Ziemssen, 1877, p.In addition to swollen and hypertrophied follicles there may be some
evidence of ulcerative destruction of these follicles.Mondiere and
others declare that this folliculous inflammation and ulceration may
exist without any other change whatever in the remaining constituents
of the mucous membrane; and therefore this form of oesophagitis was
termed folliculeuse by Mondiere (folliculous oesophagitis).This form
of the disease has been observed in typhus fever, in croup (Mondiere),
and in tuberculosis.Ulceration of the oesophagus occurs, likewise, in
carcinoma and in oesophagitis from corrosive fluids, wounds, and other
injuries.In pseudo-membranous oesophagitis the exudation occurs usually in small
circumscribed gray-yellow or brownish flakes or stripes distributed
over different portions of the surface, more closely, however, at the
upper portion of the tube.Superficial erosions are sometimes observed
beneath these deposits, and occasionally ulcerations, at times
sufficient to give rise to severe hemorrhage (Zenker and Ziemssen).Usually the mucous membrane is but slightly hyperaemic.In some
instances pseudo-membrane is so massed in plugs as to occlude the
cavity of the tube, as with obturators.In cases associated with
pseudo-membranous gastritis the oesophageal manifestations are greatest
in the vicinity of the cardiac extremity.Somewhat allied to
pseudo-membranous oesophagitis, and apt to be confounded therewith, is
the parasitic deposit of the Oidium albicans in cases of thrush; in
connection with which subject this point has already received
attention.The pustules of small-pox may interest any portion of the mucous
membrane, but are most numerous at the upper portion of the tube.The pustules from tartar-emetic poisoning
are most numerous at the two extremities of the canal.It is contended
that the so-called pustules of variolous oesophagitis are really
superficial variolous ulcers, the antecedent specific lesions having
been lenticular papules merely, with abrasion of the softened
epithelial layer.[14] Variolous oesophagitis may excite an accompanying
catarrhal or pseudo-membranous oesophagitis.The local lesions, be they
pustular or ulcerous, heal without cicatrices.[Footnote 14: _Virchow's Deutsche Klinik_, 1858, No.306; Zenker
and Ziemssen, _op.Phlegmonous oesophagitis presents both as a diffuse and as a
circumscribed inflammation.Examined after death, there is abundant
purulent infiltration into the submucous connective tissue, which has
undergone destruction in portions of its extent.The infiltration
pushes the folds of mucous membrane outward to the interior of the
tube, and thus diminishes its calibre considerably when the
infiltration is annular.{413} The mucous membrane is congested,
ecchymosed, and covered with mucus, and has usually suffered
desquamation of portions of its epithelium.Ulcerations through the
mucous membrane will have taken place in some instances.Cicatrices
mark the location of ulcers which have healed.In the diffuse variety the oesophagus is inflamed and swollen, as a
whole, in proportion to the extent of the disease.In the circumscribed
variety the morbid appearances are circumscribed.It has been known to
continue into the stomach (Belfrage and Hederius, cited by Zenker and
Ziemssen), and to extend therefrom (Ackermann, _idem_).As described by Zenker and Ziemssen, chiefly from ten autopsies by
themselves and one by Belfrage and Hederius, phlegmonous oesophagitis
begins with a submucous purulent infiltration, transforming the areolar
tissue into an apparent layer of pus, although microscopic examination
shows the bundles of connective tissue to be intact at first.At a
later period they become really destroyed, leaving mere crevices filled
with pus.The mucous membrane, but little involved, may remain normal
or may present the evidence of catarrhal inflammation, desquamation of
epithelium, congestion, and slight deposits of mucus.The muscular
coat, intact to the unaided eye, under the microscope gives some
evidence of purulent infiltrations.The pus may finally escape through
the mucous membrane, in extensive infiltrations, at several points,
which give the parts a sieve-like appearance when the perforations are
closely grouped.Gangrene sometimes occurs as a result of intense phlegmonous
oesophagitis, but this is far more rare than the gangrene supervening
after injuries by caustic substances.Sometimes it results from
capillary embolism (Rokitansky, Virchow, cited by Luton, _op.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, TERMINATION, COMPLICATIONS, AND
SEQUELAE.--The main subjective symptoms of oesophagitis are pain and
difficulty in swallowing, with febrile phenomena superadded in severe
cases.In simple oesophagitis of mild character these symptoms may be
so slight as to be attributed to other causes or be disregarded
altogether.In most instances there is a dull, steady pain beneath the
sternum, some sense of impediment to deglutition or absolute pain in
swallowing (odynphagia), and occasional regurgitation of viscid, glairy
mucus, food, or acid products from the stomach.In severe cases the
substernal pain is more acute and more diffused, and is frequently
associated with pain between the scapulae and to the left side.This
latter pain may be attributable to acid from the stomach.Sometimes the
pain is described as acute, especially during the passage of large
boluses, particularly if they are very hot, or even very cold.The seat
of pain, however, does not always indicate the seat of inflammation,
even though the pain be always referred to the same locality.When the
cervical portion of the tube is implicated, tenderness may sometimes be
detected by external pressure or by special movements of the head and
vertebrae.The amount and character of the dysphagia vary greatly.Sometimes there
is a sense of impediment to the passage of food, solid or liquid, or
solid only, through and beyond the painful region.This sensation may
be accompanied or be followed at a brief interval by regurgitation of
food or mucus, or food enveloped with mucus, the latter in some
instances tinged with blood.The deglutition or the regurgitation may
be {414} accompanied by spasm of the muscular coat of the oesophagus.The dysphagia is not always due to tumefaction of the mucous membrane,
but usually in part to coexisting inflammation of the muscular coat or
infiltration between the sheaths of muscular fibres, paralyzing their
efforts at contraction.There are no subjective symptoms which permit discrimination between
desquamative catarrhal oesophagitis and folliculous oesophagitis.The
only symptom particularly indicating pseudo-membranous oesophagitis is
the expulsion of shreds of the membrane by hawking or by emesis; but a
strong inference is justifiable when the ordinary symptoms of
oesophagitis occur in cases of pseudo-membranous pharyngitis or
croupous pneumonia.Phlegmonous oesophagitis is indicated by the presence of pus or of dead
mucous membrane in the matter regurgitated or vomited.In severe cases
there is considerable febrile reaction.In children, convulsions may
supervene from reflex irritation conveyed along the pneumogastric
nerve.The course of acute catarrhal oesophagitis is, as a rule, short, the
pain and dysphagia usually subsiding in a few days, with complete
resolution and no unfavorable sequelae.When due to obstruction, the
course is indefinitely prolonged.Sometimes it subsides into a mild or
unsuspected chronic oesophagitis.In the symptomatic oesophagitis of
febrile diseases, the course is longer and unequal.In severer forms
and in phlegmonous oesophagitis, the disease may be protracted by
suppuration, abscess, gangrene, perforation of the oesophagus, and
other complications.It often terminates fatally--in three or four days
in some cases--sometimes under symptoms of collapse.Cases may recover
without important sequelae, but stricture very often results from
cicatricial complications.Chronic oesophagitis is a more frequent
sequel of the phlegmonous variety than of the catarrhal.It, in its
turn, may give rise to dilatation of the oesophagus, annular or
diverticular, from detention of food and consequent pressure.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis will rest upon the interpretation of the
coexistence of a certain number of the symptoms mentioned.Idiopathic
phlegmonous oesophagitis may readily be mistaken for dorsal myelitis by
the location of the pain--the more so that the spinal disease is
occasionally attended with spasm of the oesophagus, and the myelitis by
difficulty in deglutition; but the differentiation may be determined by
the inability to produce oesophageal pain by pressure made along the
dorsal vertebrae.In deuteropathic or traumatic phlegmonous
oesophagitis, the history of the attack will indicate the probable
nature of the malady, and prevent the mistake.Diffused oesophagitis is
suspected when the general pain or the painful dysphagia appears to
extend along the entire tract of the oesophagus, or at least a large
portion of it.Circumscribed oesophagitis is usually indicated by odynphagia at a
certain point of the tube after completing the act of deglutition.The
location of the inflammation can sometimes be determined by
auscultation of the descent of the alimentary bolus or of a swallow of
water (Hamburger), which may yield evidence to the ear of arrest or
impediment to its passage.Auscultation of the oesophagus, however, is
less useful in acute oesophagitis than in stenosis, stricture, and
mechanical obstruction.When available in oesophagitis, the normal
sound of the passage of water down {415} the gullet becomes masked, and
accompanied by that of regurgitative ascent of small bubbles of air.Sometimes there is a slight friction sound during the act of
deglutition itself.In circumscribed oesophagitis, especially when
annular, as is most frequently the case, sounds are heard attributable
to marked obstruction to the descent of the bolus.Abscess cannot be
positively diagnosticated until after its rupture and the appearance of
pus in the matters regurgitated or otherwise expelled from the
oesophagus.Catheterism of the oesophagus is hardly justifiable as a method of
diagnosticating oesophagitis, though proper enough when it becomes
important to determine the locality of attendant obstruction.It is important that inflammation of the oesophagus be differentiated
from spasm, stricture, stenosis, carcinoma, and other oesophageal
maladies; nearly all of which present the same main subjective
symptoms--pain and impediment to deglutition.The history of the case
is in itself a guide of great diagnostic value, often quite sufficient
for the purpose; but in its absence or retention other data must be
gathered.Spasm of the oesophagus is most frequent in neurotic subjects.It
is not a febrile affection.It is often overcome in a moment by
catheterization.Stricture presents often an additional symptom of oesophagitis, the
regurgitation of mucus and food.The differentiation is made, in cases
of doubt, by the passage of the bougie or catheter.Carcinoma of the oesophagus, while recent, may present much similitude
to oesophagitis, but as the case advances, the glandular involvements,
the cachexia, the expulsion of cancerous fragments, and the vomiting of
blood seem sufficient to prevent further confusion.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is favorable in acute catarrhal oesophagitis,
the manifestations often subsiding within a few days; sometimes,
indeed, within a few hours, and that, too, without special medication.It is therefore largely dependent on the cause of the oesophagitis and
the severity and extent of the malady.The only unfavorable
prognostications arise from the impediment to nourishment and the
complications which may ensue.In presumptive pustulous oesophagitis from the use of preparations of
antimony, the manifestations usually subside within a few days upon
suspension of the remedy.Sometimes, however, these cases terminate
fatally.Pseudo-membranous oesophagitis is usually fatal in its significance,
and the same may be said of the pustulous or ulcero-papular
oesophagitis of small-pox.Phlegmonous oesophagitis is of grave augury, though many cases recover.It may prove fatal within two or three days, though life is usually
prolonged for several days, even in fatal cases.When not fatal,
abscesses are apt to form, which, discharging internally or externally,
are followed by stricture or fistulae.Both ulcerative oesophagitis and intense catarrhal oesophagitis may
terminate in chronic thickening of the walls of the oesophagus and in
cicatricial adhesions more or less extensive.TREATMENT.--Mild oesophagitis requires no special treatment.The
patient should be kept within doors, and be fed on rice-water, {416}
barley-water, and other mucilaginous articles of diet, so as to avoid
all sources of local irritation.These drinks are usually better borne
hot than cold, but sometimes cold is quite agreeable.When cold can be
well borne the frequent deglutition of pellets of ice is useful as well
as agreeable, and ice-cream becomes a medicinal article of diet.In severe cases the measures indicated become still more requisite, and
the use of the voice should be restrained in addition.All unnecessary
efforts at deglutition should be avoided, and anodyne medicaments
(opium, hyoscyamus, belladonna) should be added to the demulcent food
or beverages.When swallowing is impracticable or very painful,
nutriment should be given by the bowel, and medicines by the bowel or
by the skin.Thirst may be allayed by retaining fragments of ice in the
mouth from time to time, by rinsing the mouth with simple or acidulated
water, by sucking the juice of acid fruits, or by allowing compressed
effervescent lozenges to dissolve slowly in the mouth.The external application of cold compresses, continuously or in
frequent renewals, is also indicated.Febrile phenomena require ordinary antiphlogistic medication.When this
is impracticable, the indications may be met by using the cold bath or
the wet sheet, and by administering antipyretics hypodermatically.Traumatic oesophagitis from a foreign body requires removal of the
object if still in the oesophagus; that from swallowing alkalies is met
by the use of acidulated beverages (vinegar and water, Orfila); that
from swallowing acids, by the use of alkaline drinks, of which the
handiest is usually soap and water.As soon as they can be procured
this may be changed for lime-water and calcined magnesia.Theoretically, the carbonates of the alkalies are indicated likewise,
but it is contended (Hamburger, Oppolzer) that the extrication of the
carbonic acid gas renders mechanical rupture of the corroded oesophagus
imminent.Subsequently, fresh water should be freely drunk, or be
injected into the oesophagus when swallowing is impracticable.The
subsequent treatment is to be instituted upon general principles.DEFINITION.--A chronic inflammation of some of the tissues of the
oesophagus.SYNONYM.--Oesophagitis chronica.ETIOLOGY.--Chronic oesophagitis is sometimes a sequel of the acute
affection.More frequently it is the result of excessive use of strong
alcoholic beverages or of very hot drinks.It is said to be sometimes
the result of passive congestion in chronic pulmonary and cardiac
diseases.It follows the prolonged sojourn of foreign bodies in the
oesophagus.It exists in connection with carcinoma of the oesophagus,
with dilatation, and with stricture of the oesophagus, and with other
diseases obstructing the tube externally or internally.It is sometimes
produced by caries of the vertebrae, both scrofulous and syphilitic,
and by the pressure of aneurismal and other tumors.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Hypertrophy of the mucous membrane of
the oesophagus, of the submucous connective tissue, and {417} even of
the muscular coat, are the processes which take place in chronic
oesophagitis, especially when it has been of long continuance.This
hypertrophy, when at or near the cardiac extremity, may produce
stricture (Rokitansky and others), with subsequent dilatation of the
oesophagus from its frequent and prolonged distension by food which
should have passed on at once into the stomach.On post-mortem examination the main evidences of disease are most
frequent in the lower third of the organ.Its folds of mucous membrane
are thick and prominent, dirty red, brownish-red, or gray, as may be,
abraded here and there, and covered with viscid muco-purulent
secretions.Abscesses and ulceration are not uncommon in cases due to
prolonged pressure or extension of disease from outside the tube.Such
ulceration has not uncommonly been the source of serious hemorrhage.Diffuse inflammation of the peri- or retro-oesophageal connective
tissue has been noted as an occasional sequel to the inflammatory
process in the walls of the oesophagus.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, ETC.--The symptoms of simple chronic oesophagitis are
similar in the main to those of mild acute oesophagitis, but are often
still more moderate, and therefore likely to be overlooked.In severe
cases the symptoms are chiefly those of the disease, usually stenotic,
which has excited the chronic inflammatory process.The course is
prolonged and the duration indefinite.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis rests on the same principles and inferences
as in acute oesophagitis, the symptoms, however, being of longer
duration.The auscultatory signs of arrest or impediment in the descent
of the solid or liquid bolus are usually more definite than in acute
oesophagitis.The same differentiations are available in excluding
spasm, stricture, and malignant diseases.The use of the sound or
catheter is much more justifiable than in the acute variety.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is usually unfavorable, on account of the
great liability to stricture and occlusion from organization of
inflammatory products.TREATMENT.--Chronic oesophagitis may require both local and
constitutional treatment.The constitutional treatment will have to be
adapted to the cause of the disease.If due to obstructed circulation
in consequence of valvular disease of the heart, digitalis and remedies
of its class will be indicated.If due to obstructive pulmonic disease,
chloride of ammonium and alkaline remedies will be indicated.Syphilitic inflammation requires the mixed treatment, with mercuric
chloride and potassium iodide or their equivalent.Iodides, indeed, are
often required in non-specific cases, and are useful particularly in
ordinary circumscribed oesophagitis.Under all conditions alcoholic
beverages should be interdicted, and so should the deglutition of all
irritating food and drink.Mild, bland, and mucilaginous substances
should be largely employed in food and drink.The copious use of
carbonic-acid waters is also recommended (Oppolzer).Sinapisms and
revulsives to the side of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae are also
recommended by some writers (Oppolzer).The topical treatment consists in the systematic use every few days of
aqueous solutions of astringents (alum, tannin, ten to thirty grains to
the ounce) or alterants (compound solution of iodine, twenty minims to
the {418} ounce) passed gently over the diseased surfaces by means of a
piece of soft surgical sponge securely attached to a flexible staff.Severe pain of rather sudden occurrence is usually attributable to
circumscribed ulceration, and is best treated by superficial
cauterization, as above, with a dilute solution of silver nitrate (ten
grains to the ounce).These remedies may be used in the form of
ointments of the same strength smeared upon a rather large flexible
bougie.To relieve pain and sense of constriction belladonna or
stramonium ointment, applied in the same manner, sometimes fulfils a
useful indication.Before making these applications attempts should be
made by auscultation to locate the seat of disease or obstruction.After subsidence of the disease, occasional catheterization may be
practised at intervals of several weeks, in order to detect any
recommencing stenosis.Ulcerations of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--Circumscribed destruction of portions of the mucous
membrane of the oesophagus, the result of inflammatory processes.ETIOLOGY.--Ulceration of the oesophagus occurs as a result of
inflammation of the organ, as discussed in connection with
Oesophagitis, and the cause varies with the character of the
oesophagitis, whether idiopathic, traumatic, or symptomatic of disease
elsewhere.Diseases, constitutional or local, provocative of ulceration
of the oesophagus, usually implicate some portion of either the
alimentary or the respiratory tract.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The symptoms are in the main those described under
Acute Oesophagitis, particularly the expulsion of sanguinolent products
or of unmixed blood.Perforation into the trachea is indicated by
expectoration of food or drink; perforation into the great vessels, by
haematemesis, usually fatal; and perforation into the mediastinum, by
emphysema and purulent cellulitis.When large or extensive ulcerations
have cicatrized they occasion symptoms of organic stricture.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Referring to the corresponding section
under Oesophagitis, attention may be directed here to the liability of
deep-seated ulcers of the oesophagus to perforate the gullet and
establish fistulae with the trachea, bronchi, mediastinum, aorta, and
carotid artery, according to the locality of the lesion.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of blood in matters regurgitated or vomited
forms the chief diagnostic indication of ulceration of the oesophagus,
taken in connection with the usual symptoms of acute or chronic
oesophagitis.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is altogether dependent on the nature of the
disease which has given rise to the ulceration.TREATMENT.--The constitutional treatment will depend on the nature of
the disease which has occasioned ulceration.Ergot and turpentine are
administered in case of hemorrhage--the former best, perhaps,
hypodermatically.Attempts are sometimes made to cauterize the ulcer or
ulcers with nitrate-of-silver stick conveyed in a covered slotted
canula, to be exposed when the fenestrum reaches the ulcerated
locality, previously {419} determined by catheterization, or inferred
to be reached by the sensations of the patient.The practice is
uncertain in its manipulation and questionable in its results.Stricture of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--A constriction of the calibre of the oesophagus, whether
spasmodic or organic in character.This definition excludes stenosis
due to pressure from without.Spasmodic Stricture of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--A contraction of the muscles of the oesophagus, of
variable duration, causing partial or complete stenosis of the gullet
and interfering with the passage of food or of food and drink to the
stomach.SYNONYMS.--Oesophagismus, Spasm of the oesophagus, Cramp of the
oesophagus, Convulsive dysphagia, Spasmodic dysphagia, Spasmodic
stenosis of the oesophagus, <DW46> stricture of the oesophagus.HISTORY.--On this subject there is little of importance in medical
annals previous to the observations of Frederick Hoffmann,[15] and
little of importance subsequently save the observations of
Mondiere,[16] though numerous personal observations are on record, as
well as a number of excellent compilations in various monographs,
text-books, encyclopaedias, and dictionaries.[Footnote 15: _De spasmo gulae inferioris_, Halae, 1733; _De morbis
oesophagi spasmodicis_, Opera omnia, vol.[Footnote 16: "Recherches sur l'Oesophagisme ou Spasme de l'Oesophage,"
_Arch.ETIOLOGY.--Spasmodic stricture of the oesophagus is a neurosis often
hysterical.It is much more frequent in females than in males, and,
although observed in young subjects and less frequently in old ones, is
most common between the ages of twenty and fifty.It is sometimes
observed in several members of a neurotic family.It is often
associated with other evidences of neurosis, but sometimes constitutes
the sole manifestation.Sometimes
it can be traced to a fear of strangulation, induced primarily by some
accidental impediment to deglutition or the entrance of a foreign body.Strong mental emotion, such as the dread of hydrophobia after having
been bitten by a dog, sometimes produces the affection.It occurs in connection with organic lesions of the oesophagus, organic
lesions of the stomach, organic lesions of the larynx and trachea, and
organic lesions of the lungs, heart, large blood-vessels, and
perioesophageal tissues, but likewise as a reflex disorder, with
lesions of distant organs, as the genito-urinary tract, the intestines,
the brain and spinal cord.Even pregnancy may produce reflex
oesophagismus.It sometimes occurs as a direct or reflex manifestation
of gout and of rheumatism.In a few instances it occurs as one of the
manifestations of tetanus and of hydrophobia.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, ETC.--The spasm may affect {420} the
oesophagus only, or may be associated with spasm of the muscles of the
pharynx.It is usually manifested in a sudden inability to swallow or
to complete the acts of deglutition.This may be transitory or may
continue for a number of hours.The relaxation of the spasm is
sometimes followed by the discharge of flatus and the copious secretion
of pale urine.The spasm may recur at irregular intervals or be more or
less distinctly intermittent.Sometimes it precedes every effort at
deglutition.In some instances it occurs only upon attempts to swallow
certain kinds of food, and the articles of food vary with different
patients.Cold viands sometimes produce spasm when warm and hot food is
tolerated.Consciousness of a liability to spasm increases the
dysphagia for the time being, or brings it on suddenly when this
liability had been forgotten.The spasm is sometimes painless and
sometimes painful.In some instances it is associated with partial
regurgitation of a mass of air (the globus hystericus).The dysphagia is rarely complete, instances in which no liquids can be
swallowed being infrequent.The aliment swallowed usually passes on
into the stomach, upon relaxation of the spasm, after a certain period
of detention varying from a number of seconds to many minutes.In cases
of prolonged or persistent spasm the aliment is usually rejected,
either at once or after a time, according as the contraction takes
place at the pharyngeal extremity of the oesophagus or lower down.When
rejected after some detention in the gullet, the aliments are usually
enveloped with mucus or followed by expulsion of mucus and of flatus.In some subjects the pain in swallowing is severe.Sometimes it is
associated with spasm of the diaphragm (hiccough), spasm of the
air-passages, palpitation of the heart, and syncope.The liability to spasm sometimes continues for years.Sometimes it
ceases permanently as suddenly and as unexpectedly as it began.The seat of the spasm is referred by the patient to different regions,
which in their totality comprise the entire extent of the oesophagus.In some patients the seat varies on different occasions.The actual
seat of any individual spasm is best determined by exploration with the
oesophageal bougie or by auscultating the oesophagus during the passage
of a bolus.It is most frequent perhaps at the upper extremity, and
then perhaps at the cardiac extremity.When habitually low down, there
is some liability to permanent distension of the oesophagus from
repeated retentions of food at the same place for hours together.In
some instances food is regurgitated from the oesophagus after its
retention for a day or even longer.When the spasm is high up, the
regurgitation may follow the act of deglutition almost immediately.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--The affection being usually a pure
neurosis, there is no oesophageal lesion to be cited.In some of the
few autopsies recorded, constriction has been noted without lesion of
tissue.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis is based on the sudden onset of the spasm
without assignable cause, its intermittent or recurrent character, its
manifestation in advance of the effort at deglutition, the symptoms of
regurgitation, the coexistence of some of the affections mentioned in
connection with its etiology, and on the satisfactory result of
exploration with the oesophageal bougie; which differentiates the
affection from organic stricture or mechanical obstruction.In
catheterization of the oesophagus {421} in cases of pure spasm,
although the sound is usually arrested at the seat of constriction, it
passes onward after a few moments by sudden relaxation of the spasm.Sometimes, indeed, the very first manipulation of this kind overcomes
the spasm permanently.In the absence of other indications the differentiation from spasm of
organic origin rests, in great measure, on the conservation of
nutrition, cases being few in which the spasm is persistent enough to
interfere so materially with the ingestion of aliment as to produce
emaciation.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is usually favorable in spasm of the
oesophagus, except in cases where the underlying malady is itself a
grave one.Patients do not die of neurotic spasm of the oesophagus.In
the majority of cases it is susceptible of cure within a few weeks,
sometimes much more promptly.Even when it continues for months or for
years there is little fear of permanent injury to the general health,
inasmuch as sufficient nutriment of some kind or other can be ingested
to sustain the patient.The duration of the affection depends upon the surroundings of the
patient, his amenability to treatment, and the existence or absence of
disease in the oesophagus or elsewhere.In cases dependent upon
diseased conditions in the oesophagus or elsewhere the character of the
disease controls the prognosis, both immediate and ultimate.Thus,
aneurism of the aorta, tuberculosis, ulceration of the larynx and
trachea, carcinoma of the stomach, tetanus, and hydrophobia present the
highest unfavorable indications.Purely neurotic cases are extremely
prone to recurrence.TREATMENT.--The treatment to be pursued will depend upon the nature of
the case.If due to organic lesion in the oesophagus or in some other
organ, the treatment will be directed to that affection, whatever it
may be.If due to emotional disturbance, therapeutic efforts will be
directed to their suppression or removal.If purely hysterical,
appropriate constitutional remedies for that condition will be
prescribed.These comprise asafoetida, valerian, camphor, musk, oxide
of zinc, bromides, belladonna, conium, and so on, best administered in
small doses at frequent intervals.Local treatment is almost always necessary, both for its beneficial
mechanical effects and for its emotional influence.This consists in
the systematic passage of the bougie; and it is by far the best
practice to insist upon the patient's submission to it without an
anaesthetic.In cases of intense hyperaesthesia, which are rare, and in
the initial exploratory passage of the instrument in highly excitable
or uncontrollable subjects, anaesthesia may be resorted to if there be
no contraindication.The mere passage of the bougie will often effect
immediate relaxation of the spasm.When required, the manipulation may
be repeated a few times at intervals of several days.Should the
passage of the bougie determine the stricture to be purely spasmodic,
the patient should be made to partake of food in the physician's
presence at first, and afterward under the supervision of an efficient
attendant, until it becomes evident that there is no absolute
impediment to the passage of food.The presence of the physician during
early attempts at taking ordinary food imparts such confidence in the
patient that he soon overcomes his dread of strangling and learns to
eat again as he should do.Meantime, it may be necessary from time to
time to pass the bougie just before food is taken.{422} In such cases
it is well to smear the instrument with ointment of belladonna, so as
to deposit it more or less along the entire tract of the oesophagus.Failing by these methods, success may follow the occasional passage, at
intervals of a few days, of a sponge probang saturated with a very weak
solution of iodine or of silver nitrate.Counter-irritation along the course of the pneumogastric nerve or along
the spine is sometimes useful.Electricity is sometimes employed to overcome the spasm; but
intra-oesophageal electrization of every kind is risky from the danger
of exciting fatal syncope from irritation of the pneumogastric nerve.This objection is not applicable to percutaneous electrization, save in
a much more limited degree.Caution is requisite even with external
manipulations along the tract of the pneumogastric nerve; and such
manipulations, therefore, should not be undertaken without sufficient
familiarity with the effects of electric currents in that situation.Taken all in all, the best results seem to follow the systematic use of
the bougie and enforced deglutition under the eye of an attendant in
whom the patient feels reliance can be placed in case the food should
"go the wrong way" or become impacted in the gullet.Organic Stricture of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--Diminution in the calibre of the oesophagus in consequence
of organic alterations in its walls, whether interstitial, cicatricial,
or malignant.SYNONYM.--Stenosis of the oesophagus.HISTORY.--As mentioned in connection with other affections of the
oesophagus, so with organic stricture: though much more has been
written on the subject, it is to the observations and publications of
Mondiere, so frequently cited, that we must credit medical literature
with a due appreciation of this topic.The last thirty years especially
have been prolific in the record of cases, and their study has been
further stimulated by the attention directed to the operation of
gastrostomy as a means of prolonging life in cases otherwise hopelessly
fatal.ETIOLOGY.--Organic stricture of the oesophagus is occasionally
congenital.As a rule, life is rarely prolonged under such conditions,
but cases are on record in which it has been preserved to quite
advanced age.Thus, in a female who died from inanition at fifty-nine
years of age, after lifelong symptoms of stricture (Everard Homes[17]),
there was an annular stricture behind the first ring of the trachea;
and in a male subject who died with pneumonia at seventy-four years of
age, after lifelong symptoms of stricture,[18] the stricture was found
at the cardiac extremity of the oesophagus, which was enormously
dilated its entire length above the constriction.Encyclopedique_, t. xiv.[Footnote 18: Wilks, _Path.130; Holmes, _The
Surgical Treatment of the Diseases of Infancy and Childhood_, 2d ed.,
p.In the majority of cases the stricture is due to cicatricial
obliteration of more or less of the calibre of the oesophagus, the
result of losses of substance following scalds produced by caustic
substances swallowed, mostly by accident and sometimes by design.Wounds of all kinds, {423} whether from the interior, as in the case of
foreign bodies and instruments of extraction, or from the exterior, as
in the case of surgical operations, wounds from firearms, and the like,
are apt in their cicatrization to give rise to this form of stricture.Though denied by some authorities, syphilitic disease of the oesophagus
is an undoubted cause of stricture.Setting aside disputed records of
older authorities, we may cite recent cases reported by Lancereaux,
West,[19] Wilks, Virchow, and Lublinski,[20] the latter-named going
deeply into the bibliography, pathology, and therapeutics of stricture
from syphilis.The author could add his personal testimony were it
requisite.[Footnote 19: _The Lancet_, 1872.]20, 1883; _London Medical
Record_, Nov.Stricture of the oesophagus is likewise occasioned by the presence of
papillomatous, fibroid, and other morbid growths.Carcinoma is quite a
frequent cause.The frequent deglutition of undiluted spirituous liquors is said to
give occasion at times to stricture of the oesophagus, but in these
instances this result is usually due to precedent chronic oesophagitis
thereby excited, and terminating in infiltration and hyperplasia of the
submucous connective tissue, and sometimes great thickening of the
epithelium as well.Males are more frequently the subjects of stricture of the oesophagus,
and early adult life the most frequent period for its occurrence,
though it may present at any age.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Except in traumatic cases, the earliest symptoms,
preceded in some instances by indications of mild oesophagitis, perhaps
unnoticed or unrecognized, are occasional impediments to deglutition of
large and firm boluses, or rather a mechanical obstacle to completion
of the act of glutition occurring at intervals of a few meals or a few
days.After a while the swallowing of a large solid bolus becomes
permanently impracticable.Then, sometimes, repeated efforts become
necessary to swallow small masses of solid food; and even to do this
may require external manipulation, or at least the additional pressure
of liquids swallowed immediately after the solid bolus.These efforts
are sometimes attended with spasm, regurgitation, and pain, and may be
accompanied in addition with tracheal dyspnoea, and with nervousness in
consequence.As the disease progresses it becomes impossible to swallow
solid food, and subsequently even fluid food in extreme cases.The
bolus is then often regurgitated immediately after its deglutition, and
may be covered with mucus, blood, pus, or fragments or detritus of
ulcerated malignant growth, according to the nature of the case.Pain
and sensations of rawness are often felt at the point of constriction,
whence the pain often radiates toward one or both scapulae.If the tube
is much dilated above the stricture, the food may be detained in the
sac for several hours, and then be regurgitated in a softened,
partially-decomposed condition.Should the mass be so situated as to
compress the trachea, suffocative symptoms may be produced.In stricture due to organic disease there may be dysphonia from
pressure or injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve producing paralysis
of the vocal band.The anatomical relations of the left recurrent nerve
renders it the much more liable of the two to become implicated.Moderate dyspnoea may result from this paralysis by reason of the
reduced space of the glottis.{424} PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Organic stricture of the
oesophagus is usually due to disease or structural change involving the
mucous membrane and submucous connective tissue; but the muscular
structure may become involved likewise.It may, however, be due to
abnormal laxity of the mucous membrane, permitting a fold to occupy a
position impeding the passage of the bolus.In cases which are not carcinomatous the diminution in the actual
calibre of the tube is usually due to submucous proliferation of
connective tissue and to thickening of the mucous membrane.The
encroachment on the calibre of the tube may be quite slight, or may be
so great as to amount to almost complete occlusion.The seat of stricture is at the upper portion of the oesophagus most
frequently, then at the cardiac extremity, at the point of crossing by
the left bronchus, and at the point of passage through the
diaphragm--all localities slightly constricted normally--but it may
occur at any portion.There may, however, be two,
three, or even four strictures.Multiple strictures are most common
after deglutition of caustic substances which have made their way clear
down into the stomach.Syphilitic strictures are usually single, and so, as a rule, are
strictures of malignant origin.Cicatricial strictures from caustic substances may be in the form of
bands, rings, or longitudinal stripes or folds.Sometimes they are
quite extensive, and have been known to interest fully one-third of the
length of the oesophagus.The circumference, length, calibre, and
thickness of the stricture, however, vary within the most extreme
limits.Occasionally occlusion of the tube is complete.The detention of food above the stricture usually dilates the
oesophagus, producing hypertrophy of the mucous membrane and submucous
connective tissue, followed in its turn by fatty degeneration.Atrophy
of the oesophagus may ensue below the stricture if at all tight, and
the mucous membrane becomes thrown into longitudinal folds.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of organic stricture of the oesophagus rarely
presents difficulty.Dysphagia, spasm, and regurgitation are quite
characteristic of stricture.When the constriction is high up, the
vomiting or regurgitation of food may closely follow its deglutition;
when low down, this act may be delayed ten or fifteen minutes, in some
cases for hours.Alkaline reaction of the vomited matters is indicative
of their having failed to reach the stomach.The presence of
blood-cells, pus-cells, and cancer-cells indicates ulceration,
suppuration, and malignant disease, respectively.Auscultation of the oesophagus during deglutition of water will
indicate the seat of stricture by revealing the ascent of consecutive
air-bubbles even when palpation with bougies fails.The passage of
oesophageal bougies or the stomach-tube into the oesophagus will often
reveal the point of stricture.Its length is estimated by the distance
of the resistance offered to the passage of the instrument; its
diameter, by the size of the largest instrument which can be passed
through it; and its consistence, by the character of the resistance.Care is requisite in manipulating with these instruments, lest by undue
exertion of force they be passed through an ulcerated portion of the
wall of the tube or {425} a diverticulum.The character of the
resistance is sometimes the sole means of differentiating stricture
from stenosis due to compression of the oesophageal wall from its
outside.It sometimes happens, in individuals with impaired sensitiveness of the
epiglottis or vestibule of the larynx, that the exploratory bougie is
introduced into the air-passage instead of the gullet.The usual
premonitory phenomena of suffocation will indicate the mistake.There
is some likelihood, too, of entering the larynx in individuals with
unusually prominent cervical vertebrae and in cases of stricture at the
extreme upper portion of the oesophagus.In introducing these
instruments into the oesophagus, therefore, it is well that they be
guided along the fore finger of the disengaged hand, and passed deeply
into the throat, either to the side of the larynx or behind it.By
keeping to the side and reaching the oesophagus by way of the
laryngo-pharyngeal sinus the risk of entering the larynx may be
avoided.Before introducing the tube the case should be carefully
examined for aneurism, which by pressure sometimes gives rise to the
ordinary subjective symptoms of stricture.Should aneurism be detected,
passage of the tube would be hazardous.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is in most instances unfavorable.It is
comparatively favorable in cases of moderate stricture due to causes
apparently remediable.The extent and volume of the stricture progress
more or less slowly according to the nature of its cause, and in
non-malignant cases, such as are due to the action of caustic
substances, it may last for years before the patient, if not relieved,
succumbs, as he does, from gradual inanition.In the earlier stages,
before the hypertrophied muscles above the stricture undergo fatty
metamorphosis, the increased muscular power is sufficient to force
nourishment through the stricture; but when this becomes no longer
possible progressive marasmus must ensue.Meantime, abscess may become
developed in consequence of the pressure of retained food, and
tuberculous degeneration of the lung and local gangrene may take place
in consequence of the malnutrition.TREATMENT.--The treatment of organic stricture of the oesophagus
resolves itself into maintenance of the general health, the
administration of the iodides to promote absorption of effusions into
the connective tissue or the muscles, mechanical and operative measures
for removal of the causes of the constriction or the strictured tissues
themselves, and operations for securing artificial openings below the
point of stricture for the introduction of nourishment (oesophagostomy
and gastrostomy).Nourishment by enema is of great value.In carcinomatous stricture local measures are in the main
unjustifiable, as they usually entail injury which may prove very
serious.Arsenic internally is thought to <DW44> the progress of
malignant disease when administered early and persistently.Morphine is
used hypodermically to assuage pain.In cancerous and tuberculous disease great caution is requisite in
determining upon mechanical or surgical procedures.In cicatricial
stenosis from the effects of caustic substances, such measures may be
undertaken with much less consideration.The local treatment consists in systematic mechanical dilatation with
bougies or mechanical dilators properly constructed.These are employed
{426} daily, every other day, or at more prolonged intervals, according
to the tolerance of the parts and the progressive improvement.They are
retained several moments at each introduction, and followed by the
passage and immediate withdrawal of an instrument of larger size.It is
often advisable that the final dilatation of each series be made with a
stomach-tube, so that liquid food may be poured through it from a
syphon or a small-lipped vessel, that there may be no necessity for
swallowing food for some hours thereafter.This method is continued
until it becomes evident that nothing further is to be gained by its
continuance.In cases that have been at all successful, the
introduction of the instrument should be repeated every week or two for
a long time, to prevent or <DW44> recurrence of the constriction, which
is very liable to take place.M. Krishaber has reported[21] cases in
which a tube passed through the nose was retained from forty to three
hundred and five days; and from this success he deduces the
practicability of continuous dilatation in this manner.Billroth and
Rokitansky have encountered cases in which frequent dilatation had set
up inflammation of the surrounding connective tissue, which had caused
fatal pleurisy by continuity.Congress_, London, 1881, vol.Forcible dilatation by mechanical separation of the sides of a double
metallic sound has been employed with success in some instances.Destruction of cicatricial tissue by caustics has been attempted, and,
though successes occasionally attend the practice, it is hardly
considered sufficiently promising.Division of the stricture by internal oesophagotomy, with subsequent
dilatation, has been practised of late years, and offers some chances
of success.Oesophagostomy and gastrostomy have been performed in some
cases of impassable stricture, and the latter operation is gaining in
favor.For surgical details, however, we must refer to works on
surgery.Carcinoma of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--Carcinomatous degeneration of the oesophagus, whatever the
variety.SYNONYM.--Cancer of the oesophagus.ETIOLOGY.--Carcinoma is the most frequent disease of the oesophagus
that comes under professional observation.The most frequent variety is
the squamous-celled (53 out of 57, Butlin).Spheroidal-celled and
glandular-celled varieties are much less frequent.In some instances
the morbid product is a combination of the two.Colloid degeneration is
occasionally met with.Its cause is
undetermined, but, as it is most frequent at the constricted portions
of the tube, pressure is supposed to be the exciting cause.It does not
always give rise to secondary infection.Sometimes it is an extension
from the tongue, epiglottis, or larynx, or from the stomach.It is most
frequent in males, and more so in the intemperate than in the
abstinent.The immediate exciting cause is often attributed to local injury from
retention of foreign bodies or the deglutition of hot, acrid, or
indigestible substances.{427} There appears to be some disposition to carcinoma of the
oesophagus in tuberculous subjects (Hamburger), while the children of
tuberculous parents may have carcinoma of the oesophagus, and their
offspring, again, tuberculosis.SYMPTOMS.--The earliest local symptom is slight dysphagia, with
impediment to completion of the act of glutition--an evidence of
commencing stricture.Subsequently, inverted peristaltic action is
added, an evidence of dilatation above the stricture, with partial
retention of food.At a later stage vomiting will occur, with
admixtures of pus and sanguinolent fragments of cancerous tissue.Progressive emaciation and impaired physical endurance usually precede
these local symptoms, but actual cachectic depression may come on quite
tardily.At first there is no pain; subsequently there comes on
considerable uneasiness at some portion of the tube.Finally, there may
be severe local burning or lancinating pains, particularly after meals.If the disease be high up, there may be pain between the shoulders,
along the neck, and even in the head, with radiating pains toward
either shoulder and along the arm.If low down, there may be intense
cardialgia and even cardiac spasm.If the trachea or larynx be
compressed or displaced, dyspnoea will be produced.If the recurrent
laryngeal nerve be compressed, there will be dysphonia or aphonia.Perforation of the larynx will be indicated by cough, expectoration,
hoarseness, or loss of voice; of the trachea, by paroxysmal cough,
dyspnoea, or suffocative spasm; of the lungs, by acute pneumonitis,
especially if food shall have escaped, and expectoration of blood, pus,
and matters swallowed, as may be; of the pleura, by pneumothorax; of
the mediastinum, by emphysema; of the pericardium, by pericarditis; of
the large vessels, by hemorrhage.Perforation of the aorta or pulmonary
artery is often followed by sudden death from hemorrhage, and of the
lungs by rapid death from pneumonitis.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Primitive carcinoma is usually
circumscribed.It is most frequent at the cardiac extremity, but often
occurs where the oesophagus is crossed by the left bronchus, and
sometimes occupies the entire length of the tube.The greater
proclivity of the lower third of the oesophagus has been attributed to
mechanical pressure where it passes through the diaphragm; that of the
middle third, to pressure of its anterior wall against the left
bronchus by the bolus.It begins, either nodulated or diffuse, in the
submucous connective tissue, implicates the mucous membrane, encroaches
upon the calibre of the tube, undergoes softening and ulceration, and
becomes covered with exuberant granulations.When the entire
circumference of the oesophagus is involved stricture results,
sometimes amounting eventually to complete obstruction.Ulceration
taking place, the calibre again becomes permeable.The oesophagus
becomes dilated above the constriction and collapsed below it.As the disease progresses the adjoining tissues become involved.Adhesions may take place with trachea, bronchi, bronchial glands,
lungs, diaphragm, or even the spinal column (Newman[22]).Perforation
may take place into the trachea, usually just above the bifurcation, or
into the lungs, pleura, mediastinum, pericardium, aorta, or pulmonary
artery.Abscesses are formed, the contents of which undergo
putrefaction.There {428} may be involvement of the pneumogastric
nerve, with reflex influence on the spinal nerves and the sympathetic
(Gurmay[23]).Journ._, Aug., 1879, p.de l'Aisne_, 1869; _Gaz.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis will rest on due appreciation of the symptoms
enumerated and the ultimate evidence of the cancerous cachexia.Auscultation will often reveal the location of the disease.This may be
further confirmed by palpation with the bougie, but the manipulation
should be made without using any appreciable force.Laryngoscopic
inspection and digital exploration are sufficient when the entrance
into the oesophagus is involved.Differential diagnosis is difficult at an early stage, and often to be
based solely on negative phenomena.At a later stage it is easy,
especially when cancerous fragments are expelled.In some instances a
tumor can be felt externally.Such a tumor, however, has been known to
have been the head of the pancreas (Reid[24]).Journ._, Oct., 1877, p.Cancer of the oesophagus is liable to be confounded with chronic
oesophagitis, cicatricial stenosis, diverticulum, extraneous
compression, abscess, and non-malignant morbid growths.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is unfavorable, the disease incurable.Death
may be expected in from one to two years, though sometimes delayed for
longer periods.Inanition or marasmus is the usual cause of death in
uncomplicated cases.Sometimes it takes place by haematemesis,
sometimes following involvement of the stomach, and sometimes wholly
unassociated with any direct disease of the walls of the stomach.Death
takes place not infrequently from perforation into adjoining organs,
and sometimes from secondary inflammation of other vital organs, as the
brain and the lungs.TREATMENT.--There is little to be done in the way of treatment apart
from the constitutional measures indicated in carcinoma generally and
in chronic diseases of the oesophagus.The cautious use of the
stomach-tube to convey nourishment into the stomach is allowable during
the earlier stages of the disease only.It is dangerous after
ulceration has taken place, from the risk of perforating the walls of
the oesophagus, and thus hurrying on the fatal issue by injury to the
intrathoracic tissues.When deglutition becomes impracticable or the passage of the oesophagus
absolutely impermeable to nutriment, food and alcoholic stimuli should
be administered by enema.Indeed, it is good practice to begin to give
nourishment occasionally by the bowel before it becomes absolutely
necessary, so as to accustom the part and the patient to the
manipulation.Narcotics to relieve pain are best administered
hypodermatically, so as to avoid unnecessary irritation of the rectum.The passage of dilators, as in stricture of cicatricial origin, is very
hazardous.They produce irritation, which hastens the softening of the
tissues, and are open to the risk of penetrating the softened tissues
and passing through the walls of the oesophagus into the pleura, lung,
or mediastinum.Fatal accidents of this nature are on record.Gastrostomy is sometimes performed to prolong life.{429} Paralysis of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--Loss of motive-force in the muscular tissue of the
oesophagus, whether intrinsic or reflex in origin.SYNONYMS.--Gulae imbecillitas, Paralytic dysphagia, Atonic dysphagia.ETIOLOGY.--Paralysis of the oesophagus may be caused by impairment of
function in one or more of the nervous tracts distributed to the
muscles concerned in dilating the upper orifice of the gullet or in
those concerned in the peristaltic movements which propel the bolus to
the stomach.These impairments of function may be nutritive in origin,
as in softening and atrophy of the nerve-trunk, or, as is more
frequent, they may be pressure-phenomena from extravasations of blood,
purulent accumulations, exostoses, tumors, and the like.The paralysis may be due to disease or wounds of the nerves themselves
or of their motor roots, or of the cerebro-spinal axis, implicating
their origin, or to pressure and atrophy of a trunk-nerve in some
portion of its tract.It is likewise due to neurasthenia from
hemorrhage or from protracted disease (enteric fever, yellow fever,
cholera), or to systemic poisoning in diphtheria, syphilis, and
plumbism.It may be due to muscular atrophy or intermuscular
proliferations of connective tissue, to dilatation of the oesophagus,
and to disease in the tube.It may be due to mechanical restraint from
external adhesions of the oesophagus to intrathoracic tumors
(Finny[25]).It may follow
the sudden reaction of cold upon the overheated body.It is one of the
manifestations of hysteria and of the hysteria of pregnancy.SYMPTOMS.--Partial paralysis may give rise to no symptoms at all.The
earliest manifestations are those of impediment to the prompt passage
of the bolus to the stomach, repeated acts of deglutition or additional
swallows of food or drink being necessary.Large masses are swallowed
and propelled onward more readily than small ones, and solids more
readily than fluids.There is often a characteristic gurgling attending
the passage of fluids along the tube.Swallowing is best performed in
the erect posture.These symptoms increase in severity as the paralysis
increases.In some cases there is
no regurgitation of food; in others, this is more or less frequent.When the paralysis is complete, deglutition becomes impossible, and the
food attempted to be swallowed is expelled from the mouth and nose in a
paroxysm of cough.Sometimes the food enters the larynx and produces
paroxysms of suffocation or threatens asphyxia.There is more or less flow of saliva from the mouth in consequence of
the inability to swallow it; and in some cases the losses of material
from the blood are so great as to reduce the patient very rapidly.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Paralysis of the oesophagus may be
partial or complete.It may be associated with paralysis of the
pharynx, palate, tongue, epiglottis, or larynx; with so-called bulbar
paralysis; with general paralysis; with cerebro-spinal disseminated
sclerosis.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis rests mainly on the symptoms of dysphagia,
especially when associated with paralyses elsewhere.It is
differentiated {430} from paralysis of the pharynx by the ability to
swallow the bolus and the apparent arrest of the bolus at some portion
of the tube.Auscultation of the oesophagus will determine the locality
of the arrest.It likewise affords presumptive evidence of an
alteration in the usual form of the bolus, which, being subjected to
compression at its upper portion only, assumes the form of an inverted
cone.The remaining auscultatory indications are similar to those of
dilatation.There is no impediment to the passage of the stomach-tube or
oesophageal sound, or to its free manipulation when within the
oesophagus.When the symptoms quickly reach a maximum, they indicate a paralysis
due to apoplexy, and so they do when the symptoms are sudden, hysteria
being eliminated.Paralysis due to gumma or other cerebral tumor is
much slower in its course.PROGNOSIS.--In idiopathic paralysis, the local or special affection to
which it is due being curable, the prognosis is favorable, especially
if the paralysis be confined to the oesophagus.Recovery, however, is
often slow, even in curable cases.In hysterical paralysis the
prognosis is good.In deuteropathic paralysis the prognosis is much
less favorable, and will depend upon the nature of the causal
disease--apoplexy, insanity, cerebral tumor, syphilis, etc.TREATMENT.--The treatment varies with the nature of the cause as far as
combating the origin of the disease is concerned.With regard to the
intrinsic paralysis of the oesophagus itself, strychnine and its
congeners are indicated, and may be administered hypodermatically if
the difficulty in swallowing be very great.If the paralysis be
partial, it is better to give nux vomica or Ignatia amara by the mouth,
in hopes of getting some beneficial astringent influence on the walls
of the oesophagus.In all instances the feeding of the patient is an important element in
treatment.Masses of food arrested in the tube should be forced onward
with the sound.In some cases nourishment must be habitually introduced
through the stomach-tube and nutritive enemata be resorted to.Electricity, though sometimes successful, is a risky agent to employ,
because, as announced by Duchenne, the use of an oesophageal electrode
is attended with some risk of unduly exciting the pneumogastric nerve
and thereby inducing syncope.Dilatation of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--An abnormal distension of a portion of the oesophagus or
of the entire tube, whether general, annular, or pouched.SYNONYMS.--Oesophagocele, Hernia of the oesophagus, Diverticulum of the
oesophagus.ETIOLOGY.--Dilatation of the oesophagus is occasionally met as a
congenital affection (Hanney,[26] Grisolle,[27] and others).Usually, however, dilatation of
the oesophagus is of mechanical origin, due to distension by food or
water above a stricture or an impacted foreign body.Presumptive
paralysis of the muscular coat in chronic oesophagitis is alleged as a
source of similar distension.int._, Paris, 1883, ii.{431} General dilatation is presumed to be the mechanical result of
constriction of the cardiac extremity, leading to distension of the
oesophagus by the accumulation of large quantities of liquids.Sometimes it is due to paralysis of the muscular coat, permitting its
distension by food.Annular dilatation is sometimes due to distension just above the seat
of a stricture.Sometimes it is due to impaction of a foreign body;
sometimes there is no mechanical impediment; occasionally it is
observed as a congenital anomaly.Pouched dilatation (diverticulum) is usually due to retention of food
immediately above an impacted foreign body or some obstruction of
another character.Some of the muscular fibres of the oesophageal wall
become separated and spread asunder, allowing the mucous membrane to be
gradually forced through them by repeated efforts of deglutition upon
retained masses of food or drink, until finally a pouch is formed,
hernia-like, outside of the tube.Another mode of production is said
(Rokitansky[28]) to consist in the subsidence of tumefied glands
outside the oesophagus, after adhesions had been contracted with the
oesophagus during the inflammatory process.The shrinking of these
enlarged glands to their normal volume sometimes draws the tube outward
into a funnel-shaped sac constricted at its margin by the muscular
coat, which has receded from the pouch or has been stripped loose.The
same form of dilatation is likewise an occasional result of rupture of
the muscular coat sustained in blows or falls.It occasionally exists,
too, as a congenital defect, and this has been attributed (Bardeleben
and Billroth[29]) to partial closing of one of the branchial fissures
externally, while the internal opening has remained patent.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The symptoms, at first, are usually those of
obstruction to the passage of food, but before this obstruction occurs
dilatation may have existed without symptoms.In some cases of
diverticulum high up, there is a tumor, usually on the left side of the
neck.Rokitansky has reported one the size of the fist situated on the
right side of the neck, and Hankel[30] and others a tumor upon each
side.The tumor varies in bulk from time to time according as it may be
empty or may be distended with food, drink, or gas.[Footnote 30: _Rust's Mag._, 1833; _Dict.cit._]

Food caught in the pouch can often be forced out into the pharynx by
external pressure over the tumor in the neck.The retention of food
above a constriction or in a sac is usually accompanied by some
distress after indulgence in too much food.This uneasiness becomes
relieved upon regurgitation or vomiting.Deglutition is impeded to a
less extent when the disease does not implicate the upper portion of
the gut.Complete dilatation is sometimes indicated by long addiction to habits
of rumination.In some instances this rumination is an agreeable
sensuous process.In pouched dilatation it is very often disagreeable,
the regurgitated matters being acrid, owing to acid fermentation of the
contents of the sac.While the dilatation remains moderate there may be little dysphagia or
none at all, the muscles continuing sufficiently vigorous to propel the
food; but after the muscles become paralyzed by distension the
dysphagia gradually increases and may culminate in complete aphagia.One {432} of the special indications of diverticulum is that the
regurgitation does not take place until several hours after a meal.As
the sac enlarges there may be less and less complaint of dysphagia,
because it becomes able to contain larger quantities of food.At the
same time it may so compress the main tube as to occlude its calibre
and prevent access of food to the stomach.The symptoms of annular dilatation are similar to those of stricture
with retention of food above it, the regurgitation usually following
deglutition more quickly.In some cases of dilatation, circumscribed and general, food is
sometimes retained for an entire day or more before it is ejected.The
decomposition of the retained food usually produces a more or less
continuous foul odor from the mouth.The course of the affection is progressively from bad to worse, and
entails ultimate emaciation.Some patients succumb early, and some live
to advanced age.Perforation of the oesophagus ensues in some
instances, and death results in consequence of the injuries sustained
by perioesophageal structures by the escape of the contents of the
oesophagus.Perforation is indicated by sudden collapse and by
emphysema from swallowed air.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Dilatation of the oesophagus is either
general or partial, according as it takes place in the whole or greater
portion of the oesophagus or in a circumscribed portion.Partial
dilatation may involve the entire circumference of the canal (annular
dilatation), or it may implicate but a portion of the wall, which
becomes pouched into a sac externally (diverticulum or saccular
dilatation).General dilatation, though sometimes congenital, is, as mentioned under
Etiology, more frequently the mechanical result of distension of the
oesophagus by food or drink prevented from ready entrance into the
stomach by a constriction at the cardiac orifice.This form of
dilatation is sometimes discovered as a post-mortem curiosity.The
muscles have usually undergone great hypertrophy, and the mucous
membrane some thickening and congestion, with erosions and sometimes
ulcerations, indicative of chronic oesophagitis.In some instances all
the coats of the oesophagus have undergone hypertrophy.The dilatation
may vary from slight enlargement to the thickness of an ordinary man's
arm or larger (Rokitansky[31]); in rare cases, even a capacity nearly
equal to that of the stomach (Luschka[32] and others).Anat._]

[Footnote 32: _Arch.fur Anat., etc._, March, 1868, p.Fusiform Dilatation of Oesophagus (Luschka).A,
Larynx; B, Thyroid gland; C, Trachea; D, Oesophagus; E, Stomach.]The oesophagus is usually fusiform or spindle-shaped, being constricted
at those portions at which it is normally slightly constricted.Sometimes the dilatation takes place between the lobes of the lungs
(Raymond[33]).Annular dilatation is usually due to circumferential distension just
above a stricture.When not due to stricture its seat is usually just
above the diaphragm, where the oesophagus is normally liable to
constriction.The upper portion of the dilatation is larger than the
lower portion, and the muscular walls are usually hypertrophied.Pouched dilatation (diverticulum) is usually formed chiefly of mucous
membrane and submucous tissue pushed through gaps in the fibres of the
{433} muscular coat, produced by distension.It sometimes involves the
entire coat in cases in which the oesophageal wall has become adherent
to enlarged lymphatic glands, which subsequently undergo subsidence in
volume and drag the adherent portion of the wall after them
(Rokitansky).The muscular walls are then usually hypertrophied, the
mucous membrane sometimes hypertrophied, sometimes atrophied.The
diverticulum is usually located in the upper portion of the oesophagus,
just below the inferior constrictor muscle of the pharynx.It may thus
be, in part, a pharyngocele also.It may be located behind the point of
bifurcation of the trachea or where the oesophagus is crossed by the
left bronchus.Its direction may be to the left side in the upper
portion of the oesophagus, to the right side, or upon both sides; but
when situated lower down it is usually directed backward, between the
posterior wall of the tube and the spinal column.Hence its distension
with food completely blocks up the calibre of the oesophagus.The
orifice by which the oesophageal wall remains in communication with the
pouch is round or elliptic in shape and variable in size, sometimes
being about an inch in its long diameter, sometimes much smaller.The
size of the diverticulum varies; a common size is that of a duck egg,
but the size of a fist has been attained.Sometimes the diverticulum
drags the oesophagus out of position and forms a sort of blind pouch in
the direct line of its axis, so that it becomes filled with food which
fails to reach the stomach.The dilatations become enlarged by retention of food, and are liable to
undergo inflammation, ulceration, and perforation.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis will depend upon the symptoms of dysphagia,
regurgitation, and so on, and upon the evidence furnished by
auscultatory indications, palpation with the oesophageal sound, and, in
some instances, the existence of a tumor in the neck, enlarging after
meals, and {434} from which food or mucus can be forced up into the
pharynx by pressure externally.Stethoscopic auscultation of the oesophagus during the deglutition of
water indicates an alteration in the usual form of the gulp, which
seems to trickle rapidly in a larger or smaller stream according to the
degree of dilatation.If the dilatation be annular and located high up,
auscultation is said to give the impression of a general sprinkling of
fluid deflected from its course.The peculiar gurgle is often audible
without the aid of stethoscopy.Palpation with the oesophageal bougie
is competent to reveal the existence of a large sac by the facility
with which the terminal extremity of the sound can be moved in the
cavity.In the case of a diverticulum, however, the sound may glide
past the mouth of the pouch without entering it, although arrested at
the bottom of the sac in most instances.In annular dilatation any constriction below it is usually perceptible
to the touch through the sound; but, on the other hand, the ready
passage of the bougie into the stomach, while excluding stricture, does
not positively disprove the existence of a circumscribed dilatation.If
high up, the dilatation may be detected externally by its enlargement
when filled with food after a meal, and the subsidence of tumefaction
when the sac is emptied by pressure from without, or by regurgitation.If the dilatation occupy a position which exercises compression of the
trachea, dyspnoea will ensue when it is distended.The intermittence of
the tumefaction serves to differentiate the swelling from abscess or
morbid growth.From aneurism of the aorta, which it may simulate
(Davy[34]), it is to be discriminated by absence of the usual
stethoscopic and circulatory manifestations.The diagnosis of
congenital dilatation is based upon a history of difficulty in
deglutition dating from the earliest period of recollection.Press and
Circular_, May, 1874.]PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is not favorable in any given case unless the
cause can be removed, and not even then unless food can be prevented
from accumulating in the distended portion of the tube.Nevertheless,
cases sometimes go on into advanced age.On the other hand, they may
terminate fatally within a year (Lindau[35]).The danger of perforation
adds additional gravity to the prognosis, for life may be suddenly lost
by this accident.A case of
death by suffocation has been recorded, attributed to the pressure of
the distended oesophagus upon the intrathoracic vessels (Hannay[36]).[Footnote 35: _Casper's Wochenschrift_, 1840, No.de
Med._, 1841, p.de Med et de Chir._, xxiv.Journ._, July 1, 1833.]TREATMENT.--If the dilatation be due to stricture or to an impacted
foreign body, the treatment should be directed to overcoming the one
and removing the other.General dilatation from chronic oesophagitis requires treatment for
that disease.Much depends upon preventing the accumulation of food in a sac or
diverticle; the best means of accomplishing which is the systematic
administration of all nutriment by means of the stomach-tube.When this
is not advisable, care must be exercised in the selection of such food
as is least likely to irritate the parts if detained in the pouch.{435} As far as general treatment is concerned, stimulants are usually
indicated, as the patients become much reduced.If paralysis of the
muscular coat of the oesophagus is believed to exist, the
administration of preparations of phosphorus and of strychnine are
indicated on general principles of therapeutics.Stimulation of
muscular contractility by the oesophageal electrode has been
recommended, but the prospects of success hardly justify the risks of
serious injury in the domain of the pneumogastric nerve.It has not yet been determined whether surgical procedures are
competent to relieve dilatation.In cases of pouched dilatation high up
it would not be difficult, as suggested by Michel,[37] to expose the
sac and excise it in such a manner that the sutures uniting the walls
of the oesophagus shall occupy the site of the mouth of the
diverticulum, and, thus obliterating it by cicatrization, restore the
normal path of the food from the pharynx to the oesophagus.Gastrostomy, too, should hold out some hope of rescue, no matter what
portion of the oesophagus be dilated.{436}

FUNCTIONAL AND INFLAMMATORY DISEASES OF THE STOMACH.BY SAMUEL G. ARMOR, M.D., LL.D.Functional Dyspepsia (Atonic Dyspepsia, Indigestion).To difficulty in the physiological process of digestion the familiar
name of dyspepsia has been given, while to a merely disturbed condition
of the function the term indigestion is more frequently applied.This
distinction, difficult at all times to make, may appear more arbitrary
than real; and inasmuch as it involves no important practical point,
the author of the present article will use the terms interchangeably as
indicating functional disturbance of the stomach--_i.e._ disturbance of
the digestive process not associated with changes of an inflammatory
character, so far as we know.Since it is one of the most common of all complaints from its
association with various other morbid conditions, the term is not
unfrequently vaguely employed.It is difficult, of course, to define a
disease whose etiology is so directly related to so many distinct
morbid conditions.Indeed, there are few diseases, general or local,
which are not at some time in their history associated with more or
less derangement of the digestive process.For purposes of limitation,
therefore, it will be understood that we now refer to chronic
functional forms of indigestion which depend largely, at least, on a
purely nervous element, and for this reason are not infrequently
described as sympathetic dyspepsia.Doubt has been expressed as to
whether such forms of disease ever exist, but that we encounter purely
functional forms of dyspepsia, corresponding to the dyspepsia apyretica
of Broussais, would appear to be a well-recognized clinical fact.What the precise relation is between digestive disturbances and the
nervous system we may not fully understand, no more than we understand
how a healthy condition of nervous endowment is essential to all vital
processes.Even lesions of nutrition are now known to depend upon
primary disturbance of nervous influence.This is seen in certain skin
diseases, such as herpes zoster, which closely follows the destruction
of certain nerves.And it is well known that injury of nerve-trunks is
not unfrequently followed by impaired nutrition and failure in
reparative power in the parts to which such nerves are distributed.Indeed, so marked is the influence of the nervous system over the
nutritive operations that the question has been considered as to
whether there are {437} trophic nerves distributed to tissue-elements
themselves whose special function is to keep these elements in a
healthy state of nutrition.The proof, at least, that the digestive
process is, in some unexplained way, under the immediate influence of
the nervous system, either cerebro-spinal or trophic, is both varied
and abundant.The digestive secretions are known to be the products of
living cells which are abundantly supplied with nerve-fibres, and we
can readily believe that the potential energy of this cell-force is
probably vital and trophic.At any rate, it is unknown in the domain of
ordinary chemistry.The digestive ferments, as clearly pointed out by
Roberts, are the direct products of living cells.Their mode of action,
he claims, bears no resemblance to that of ordinary chemical affinity.Nor do they derive their
vital endowments from material substances."They give nothing material
to, and take nothing from, the substances acted on.The albuminoid
matter which constitutes their mass is evidently no more than the
material substance of a special kind of energy--just as the steel of a
magnet is the material substratum of the magnetic energy, but is not
itself that energy" (Roberts).That this living cell-force is partly,
at least, derived from the nervous system is clear from the well-known
effects of mental emotion, such as acute grief, despair, etc., in
putting an immediate stop to the digestive process.Experiments on the
lower animals have also shown the direct influence of the nervous
system over gastric secretion.Wilson Philip showed by various
experiments on rabbits and other animals that if the eighth pair of
nerves be divided in the neck, any food which the creatures may
afterward eat remains in the stomach undigested, and after death, when
the nerve has been divided, the coats of the stomach are not found
digested, however long the animal may have been dead.Bernard also
excited a copious secretion by galvanization of the pneumogastric, and
by section of the same nerve stopped the process of digestion and
produced "pallor and flaccidity of the stomach."Recently doubt has
been thrown on these statements of Bernard and Frerichs.Goltz
concludes, from observations made on frogs, that nerve-ganglia,
connected by numerous intercommunicating bundles of nerve-fibres, exist
in the walls of the stomach, the irritation of which gives rise to
local contractions and peristaltic movements of the stomach, and that
these ganglia influence the gastric secretion.However this may be, it
still remains true that these gastric ganglia are in connection,
through the vagi, with the medulla oblongata, and are thus influenced
by the cerebro-spinal nerve-centres.And clinical observation confirms
what theoretical considerations would suggest.Thus, strong mental
impressions are known to produce sudden arrest of secretion, and that
which arrests secretion may, if continued, lead to perversion of the
same.Impressions made upon the nerves of special sense are also known to
affect the salivary and gastric secretions.The flow of saliva is
stimulated by the sight, the smell, the taste, and even thought, of
food.Bidder and Schmidt made interesting experiments on dogs bearing
upon this point.They ascertained by placing meat before dogs that had
been kept fasting that gastric juice was copiously effused into the
stomach.Other secretions are known to be similarly affected.Carpenter
by a series of well-observed cases has shown the direct influence of
mental conditions on the {438} mammary secretion.The nervous
association of diabetes and chronic Bright's disease is interesting in
this connection, and the direct nervous connection betwixt the brain
and the liver has been shown by numerous experiments.It is maintained
by modern physiologists that "the liver--indeed each of the
viscera--has its representative area in the brain, just as much as the
arm or leg is represented in a distant localized area" (Hughlings
Jackson).And in harmony with this view Carpenter long since pointed
out the fact that if the volitional direction of the consciousness to a
part be automatically kept up for a length of time, both the functional
action and the nutrition of the part may suffer.It has been described
by him as expectant attention, and it has, as we shall see, important
practical bearings on the management of gastric affections.Sympathetic
disturbance of the stomach is also connected with direct disease of the
brain.The almost immediate
effects of a blow are nausea and vomiting, and the same thing is
observed in local inflammation of the meninges of the brain.Many forms of functional dyspepsia due to nervous disturbance of a
reflex character will be pointed out when discussing the etiology of
the disease.ETIOLOGY.--Among the agencies affecting the digestive process in atonic
forms of dyspepsia may be mentioned--

First, predisposing causes;

Second, exciting causes.In general terms it may be said that all conditions of depressed
vitality predispose to the varied forms of atonic dyspepsia.These
conditions range through an endless combination of causes, both
predisposing and exciting.There is not a disturbed condition of life,
extrinsic or intrinsic, that may not contribute to this end.In some
cases it may be the effects of hot and enervating climates; in others
the alterations in the elementary constituents of the blood may be
apparent; while in still others the cause may be exhausting discharges,
hemorrhages, profuse suppuration, venereal excesses, sedentary
occupations, and long-continued mental and moral emotions.Heredity may also predispose to functional dyspepsia.Certain faulty
states of the nervous system are specially liable to be transmitted
from parent to offspring--not always in the exact form in which they
appeared in the parent, but in forms determined by the individual life
of the offspring.For obvious reasons, growing out of our modern
American civilization, the inheritance of a faulty nervous organization
is apt to spend itself upon the digestive apparatus.The inordinate
mental activity, the active competitions of life, the struggle for
existence, the haste to get rich, the disappointments of failure,--all
contribute to this end.The general tendency of American life is also
in the direction of a highly-developed and morbidly sensitive nervous
system, and functional dyspepsia is a natural sequence of this.The
symptoms of dyspepsia thus caused usually manifest themselves at an
early period of life.The stomach becomes weak as age
advances, in common with all the functions of the body, and consequent
upon this weakness there is diminished excitability of the gastric
nerves, with diminished muscular action of the walls of the stomach and
deficient secretion of the gastric juice.Chronic structural changes
are {439} also apt to occur in advanced life.The gastric glands become
atrophied and the arteries become atheromatous, so that with symptoms
of indigestion there are often associated loss of consciousness at
times, vertigo, irregular action of the heart, etc.These general facts
have an important bearing upon the hygienic management of dyspepsia in
the aged.They require, as a rule, less food than the young and
vigorous.In times when famine was more frequent than now it was found
that the older a human being was, the better deficiency of food was
borne.Hippocrates tells us, in his _Aphorisms_, that old men suffer
least from abstinence.Their food should be such, both in quantity and
quality, as the enfeebled stomach can digest.There is less demand for
the materials of growth, and consequently for animal food.Moderate
quantities of alcohol, judiciously used, are also specially adapted to
the indigestion of the aged.It has the double effect of stimulating
the digestive process and at the same time checking the activity of
destructive assimilation, which in old age exhausts the vital force.And in order to more effectively arrest destructive metamorphosis great
caution should be taken against excessive muscular fatigue, as well as
against sudden extremes of temperature.Loss of appetite from deficient
formation of gastric juice is a common symptom in old age.This is not
often successfully treated by drugs, and yet medicines are not without
value.The sesquicarbonate of ammonium acts as a stimulant to the
mucous membrane and to the vaso-motor nerve, and in this way becomes a
valuable addition to the simple vegetable bitters.Dilute hydrochloric
acid with the vegetable bitters may also be tried.Condiments with the
food directly stimulate the action of the enfeebled stomach.The old
remedy of mustard-seed is not unfrequently useful, and pepper, cayenne,
horseradish, and curries act in a similar manner in torpid digestion.And in cases of great exhaustion associated with anaemia benefit may be
derived from small doses of iron added to tincture of columbo or
gentian.Nor should it be forgotten that in the opposite extreme of life the
digestive capacity is extremely limited.The infant's digestion is
readily disturbed by unsuitable alimentation.For obvious reasons it
does not easily digest starchy substances.The diastasic ferment does
not exist in the saliva of young sucking animals, at least to any
extent.No food is so suitable for early infantile life as the mother's
milk, provided the mother herself is healthy.It contains in an easily
digestible form all the constituents necessary to the rapidly-growing
young animal.Van Helmont's substitute of bread boiled in beer and
honey for milk, or Baron Liebig's food for infants, cannot take the
place of nature's type of food, which we find in milk.If a substitute
has to be selected, there is nothing so good as cow's milk diluted with
an equal quantity of soft water, or, what in many cases is better,
barley-water, to which may be added a teaspoonful of powdered sugar of
milk and a pinch of table-salt and phosphate of lime.Lime-water may be
added with advantage.Dilution of alimentary substances is an important
condition of absorption in the infant stomach.Anaemia is a common predisposing cause of indigestion.Indeed, as a
widely-prevailing pathological condition few causes stand out so
prominent.It affects at once the great nutritive processes, and these
in turn disturb the functional activity of all the organs of the body.Not only are the gastric and intestinal glands diminished in their
{440} functional activity by impoverished or altered blood, but the
movements of the stomach are retarded by weakened muscular action.It
is impossible to separate altered blood from perverted tissue-structure
and altered secretion.Indigestion produced by anaemia is difficult of
treatment, on account of the complexity of the pathological conditions
usually present, the anaemia itself being generally a secondary
condition.Careful inquiry should be made, therefore, into the probable
cause of the anaemia, and this should, if possible, be removed as an
important part of the treatment of the dyspepsia.Nothing will more
promptly restore the digestive capacity in such cases than good,
healthy, well-oxidized blood.Indeed, healthy blood is a condition
precedent to the normal functional activity of the stomach.To these general predisposing causes may be added indigestion occurring
in febrile states of the system.In all
general febrile conditions the secretions are markedly disturbed; the
tongue is dry and furred; the urine is scanty; the excretions lessened;
the bowels constipated; and the appetite gone.The nervous system also
participates in the general disturbance.In this condition the gastric
juice is changed both quantitatively and qualitatively, and digestion,
as a consequence, becomes weak and imperfect--a fact that should be
taken into account in regulating the diet of febrile patients.From
mere theoretical considerations there can be no doubt that fever
patients are often overfed.To counteract the relatively increased
tissue-metamorphosis known to exist, and the consequent excessive
waste, forced nutrition is frequently resorted to.Then the traditional
saying of the justly-celebrated Graves, that he fed fevers, has also
rendered popular the practice.Within certain bounds alimentation is
undoubtedly an important part of the treatment of all the essential
forms of fever.But if more food is crowded upon the stomach than can
be digested and assimilated, it merely imposes a burden instead of
supplying a want.The excess of food beyond the digestive capacity
decomposes, giving rise to fetid gases, and often to troublesome
intestinal complications.The true mode of restoring strength in such
cases is to administer only such quantities of food as the patient is
capable of digesting and assimilating.To this end resort has been had
to food in a partially predigested state, such as peptonized milk, milk
gruel, soups, jellies, and beef-tea; and clinical experience has thus
far shown encouraging results from such nutrition in the management of
general fevers.In these febrile conditions, and in all cases of
general debility, the weak digestion does not necessarily involve
positive disease of the stomach, for by regulating the diet according
to the digestive capacity healthy digestion may be obtained for an
indefinite time.Exhaustion of the nerves of organic life strongly predisposes to the
atonic forms of dyspepsia.We have already seen how markedly the
digestive process is influenced by certain mental states, and it is a
well-recognized fact that the sympathetic system of nerves is
intimately associated with all the vegetative functions of the body.Without a certain amount of nervous energy derived from this portion of
the nervous system, there is failure of the two most important
conditions of digestion--viz.muscular movements of the stomach and
healthy secretion of gastric juice.This form of indigestion is
peculiar to {441} the ill-fed and badly-nourished.It follows in the
wake of privation and want, and is often seen in the peculiarly
careworn and sallow classes who throng our public dispensaries.In this
dyspepsia of exhaustion the solvent power of the stomach is so
diminished that if food is forced upon the patient it is apt to be
followed by flatulence, headache, uneasy or painful sensations in the
stomach, and sometimes by nausea and diarrhoea.It is best treated by
improving in every possible way the general system of nutrition, and by
adapting the food, both in quantity and quality, to the enfeebled
condition of the digestive powers.Hygienic measures are also of great
importance in the management of this form of dyspepsia, and especially
such as restore the lost energy of the nervous system.If it occur in
badly-nourished persons who take little outdoor exercise, the food
should be adapted to the feeble digestive power.It should consist for
a time largely of milk and eggs, oatmeal, peptonized milk gruels, stale
bread; to which should be added digestible nitrogenous meat diet in
proportion to increased muscular exercise.Systematic outdoor exercise
should be insisted upon as a sine qua non.Much benefit may be derived
from the employment of electric currents, and hydrotherapy has also
given excellent results.If the indigestion occur in the badly-fed
outdoor day-laborer, his food should be more generous and mixed.It
should consist largely, however, of digestible nitrogenous food, and
meat, par excellence, should be increased in proportion to the exercise
taken.Medicinally, such cases should be treated on general principles.Benefit may be derived from the mineral acids added to simple bitters,
or in cases of extreme nervous prostration small doses of nux vomica
are a valuable addition to dilute hydrochloric acid.The not unfrequent
resort to phosphorus in such cases is of more than doubtful utility.Some interesting contributions have been recently made to this subject
of gastric neuroses by Buchard, See, and Mathieu.Buchard claims that
atonic dilatation of the stomach is a very frequent result of an
adynamic state of the general system.He compares it to certain forms
of cardiac dilatation--both expressions of myasthenia.It may result
from profound anaemia or from psychical causes.Mathieu regards mental
depression as only second in frequency.Much stress is laid upon
poisons generated by fermenting food in the stomach in such cases.It
may cause a true toxaemia, just as renal diseases give rise to uraemia.Of course treatment in such cases must be addressed principally to the
general constitution.But of all predisposing causes of dyspepsia, deficient gastric
secretion, with resulting fermentation of food, is perhaps the most
prevalent.It is true this deficient secretion may be, and often is, a
secondary condition; many causes contribute to its production; but
still, the practical fact remains that the immediate cause of the
indigestion is disproportion between the quantity of gastric juice
secreted and the amount of food taken into the stomach.In all such
cases we have what is popularly known as torpidity of digestion, and
the condition described is that of atony of the stomach.The two main
constituents of gastric juice--namely, acid and pepsin--may be
deficient in quantity or disturbed in their relative proportions.A
certain amount of acid is absolutely essential to the digestive
process, while a small amount of pepsin may be sufficient to digest a
large amount of albuminoid food.{442} Pure unmixed gastric juice was
first analyzed by Bidder and Schmidt.The mean analyses of ten
specimens free from saliva, procured from dogs, gave the following
results:

  _Gastric Juice of a Dog_.Water                        973.06
  Solids                        26.94
    Containing--Peptone and pepsin   17.19
    Free hydrochloric acid            3.05
    Alkaline chlorides                4.26
    Ammonium chloride                 0.47
    Chlorine                          5.06
               | Lime                 1.73
    Phosphates | Magnesia             0.23
               | Iron                 0.08

They proved by the most careful analyses that fresh gastric juice
contains only one mineral acid--namely, hydrochloric; since which time
Richet has been able to prove that "this acid does not exist in a free
state, but in loose combination with an organic substance known as
lucin," the chloride of lucin.And just here the curious and puzzling
question arises as to the secretion of a mineral acid from alkaline
blood.Ewald, the distinguished lecturer in the Royal University of
Berlin, tells us that "a brilliant experiment of Maly's has thrown
unexpected light upon this.There are fluids of alkaline reaction which
may contain two acid and alkaline mutually inoffensive salts, but still
have an alkaline reaction, because the acid reaction is to a certain
extent eclipsed; for instance, a solution of neutral phosphate of soda
(Na_{2}HPO_{4}) and acid phosphate of soda (NaH_{2}PO_{4}) is alkaline.Such a solution placed in a dialyzer after a short time gives up its
acid salt to the surrounding distilled water, and one has in the
dialyzer an alkaline fluid outside an acid fluid."He thus proved that
the acid phosphate of sodium is present in the blood in spite of its
alkaline reaction.Lack of the normal amount of the gastric secretion must be met by
restoring the physiological conditions upon which the secretion
depends.In the mean time, hydrochloric and lactic acids may be tried
for the purpose of strengthening the solvent powers of the gastric
secretion.EXCITING CAUSES.--The immediate causes of dyspepsia are such as act
more directly on the stomach.They embrace all causes which produce
conditions of gastric catarrh, such as excess in eating and drinking,
imperfect mastication and insalivation, the use of indigestible or
unwholesome food and of alcohol, the imperfect arrangement of meals,
over-drugging, etc.Of exciting causes, errors of diet are amongst the most constantly
operative, and of these errors excess of food is doubtless the most
common.The influence of this as an etiological factor in derangement
of digestion can scarcely be exaggerated.In very many instances more
food is taken into the stomach than is actually required to restore
tissue-waste, and the effects of such excess upon the organism are as
numerous as they are hurtful.Indeed, few elements of disease are more
constantly operative in a great variety of ailments.In the first
place, if food be introduced into the stomach beyond
tissue-requirements, symptoms of indigestion at once manifest
themselves.The natural balance betwixt {443} supply and demand is
disturbed; the general nutrition of the body is interfered with; local
disturbances of nutrition follow; and mal-products of digestion find
their way into the blood.Especially is this the case when the
excessive amount of food contains a disproportionate amount of
nitrogenous matter.All proteid principles require a considerable
amount of chemical alteration before they are fitted for the metabolic
changes of the organism; the processes of assimilative conversion are
more complex than those undergone by fats and amyloids; and it follows
that there is proportional danger of disturbance of these processes
from overwork.Moreover, if nitrogenous food is in excess of
tissue-requirement, it undergoes certain oxidation changes in the blood
without becoming previously woven into tissue, with resulting compounds
which become positive poisons in the economy.The kidneys and skin are
largely concerned in the elimination of these compounds, and the
frequency with which these organs become diseased is largely due, no
doubt, to the excessive use of unassimilated nitrogenous food.Then,
again, if food be introduced in excess of the digestive capacity, the
undigested portion acts directly upon the stomach as a foreign body,
and in undergoing decomposition and putrefying changes frets and
irritates the mucous membrane.It can scarcely be a matter of doubt
that large groups of diseases have for their principal causes excess of
alimentation beyond the actual requirements of the system.All such
patients suffer from symptoms of catarrhal indigestion, such as gastric
uneasiness, headache, vertigo, a general feeling of lassitude,
constipation, and high- urine with abundant urates, together
with varied skin eruptions.Such cases are greatly relieved by reducing
the amount of food taken, especially nitrogenous food, and by a
systematic and somewhat prolonged course of purgative mineral waters.The waters of Carlsbad,
Ems, Seltzer, Friedrichshall, and Marienbad, and many of the alkaline
purgative waters of our own country, not unfrequently prove valuable to
those who can afford to try them, and their value shows how often
deranged primary assimilation is at the foundation of many human
ailments.The absurd height to which so-called restorative medicine has
attained within the last twenty years or more has contributed largely
to the production of inflammatory forms of indigestion, with all the
evil consequences growing out of general deranged nutrition.The use of indigestible and unwholesome food entails somewhat the same
consequences.This may consist in the use of food essentially unhealthy
or indigestible, or made so by imperfect preparation (cooking, etc.).Certain substances taken as food cannot be dissolved by the gastric or
intestinal secretions: the seeds, the skins, and rinds of fruit, the
husks of corn and bran, and gristle and elastic tissue, as well as
hairs in animal food, are thrown off as they are swallowed, and if
taken in excess they mechanically irritate the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane and excite symptoms of acute dyspepsia, and not unfrequently
give rise to pain of a griping character accompanied by diarrhoea.Symptoms of acute dyspepsia also frequently follow the ingestion of
special kinds of food, such as mushrooms, shellfish, or indeed fish of
any kind; and food not adapted to the individual organism is apt to
excite dyspeptic symptoms.Appetite and digestion are also very much
influenced by the life and {444} habits of the individual.The diet,
for instance, of bodily labor should consist largely of digestible
nitrogenous food, and meat, par excellence, should be increased in
proportion as muscular exercise is increased.For all sorts of muscular
laborers a mixed diet is best in which animal food enters as a
prominent ingredient.Thus, it has been found, according to the
researches of Chambers, that in forced military marches meat extract
has greater sustaining properties than any other kind of food.But with
those who do not take much outdoor exercise the error is apt to be, as
already pointed out, in the direction of over-feeding.It cannot be
doubted at the present time that over-eating (gluttony) is one of our
popular vices.Hufeland says: "In general we find that men who live
sparingly attain to the greatest age."While preventive medicine in the
way of improved hygiene--better drainage, better ventilation, etc.--is
contributing largely to the longevity of the race, we unfortunately
encounter in more recent times an antagonizing influence in the elegant
art of cookery.Every conceivable ingenuity is resorted to to tempt men
to eat more than their stomachs can properly or easily digest or
tissue-changes require.The injurious consequences of such over-feeding
may finally correct itself by destroying the capacity of the stomach to
digest the food.But, on the other hand, in many nervous forms of dyspepsia the weak
stomach is not unfrequently made weaker by severely restricted regimen,
and especially is this the case with mental workers.Theoretical and
fanciful considerations sometimes lead to physical starvation.This is
apt to be the case with dyspeptics.Men who toil with their brain
rather than their muscles, whether dyspeptic or not, require good,
easily-digested mixed diet.It is a popular error to suppose that drugs
can take the place of such food, especially drugs which are supposed to
have a reconstructive influence over the nervous system, such as iron
and phosphorus.The expression of Buchner, "No thinking without
phosphorus," captivating to theoretical minds, has gained much
notoriety, and has doubtless led to the excessive use of that drug in
nervous forms of indigestion.There never was a period when phosphorus
was so universally prescribed as the present.It enters into endless
combinations with so-called nerve-tonics.Of the injurious influence of
the drug in many cases of functional indigestion there can be no doubt;
and the statement itself, so often quoted, that "the amount of
phosphorus in the blood passing through the brain bears an exact
proportion to the intensity of thought," is calculated to mislead.T.
K. Chambers, author of the excellent _Manual of Diet_, makes the
statement that "a captive lion, tiger, leopard, or hare assimilates and
parts with a greater amount of phosphorus than a hard-thinking man;
while the beaver, noted for its power of contrivance, excretes so
little phosphorus that chemical analysis cannot find it in its
excreta."In the wonderful adaptations and regulative mechanisms of
nature we may trust largely to the natural law of supply and demand in
maintaining a proper equilibrium.It may be doubted, indeed, whether we
require at any time more phosphorus for brain- and nerve-tissue than
can be found in such food as contains digestible phosphatic salts.The
natural demand for food grows out of healthy tissue-change.An appetite
to be healthy should commence in processes outside of the stomach.Food may also be introduced into the stomach in an undigestible form
{445} from defects of cookery.The process of cooking food produces
certain well-known chemical changes in alimentary substances which
render them more digestible than in the uncooked state.By the use of
fire in cooking his food new sources of strength have been opened up to
man which have doubtless contributed immeasurably to his physical
development, and has led to his classification as the cooking animal.With regard to most articles the practice of cooking his food
beforehand is wellnigh universal; and especially is this the case with
all farinaceous articles of food.The gluten of wheat is almost
indigestible in the uncooked state.By the process of cooking the
starchy matter of the grain is not only liberated from its protecting
envelopes, but it is converted into a gelatinous condition which
readily yields to the diastasic ferments.Roberts, in his lectures on
the _Digestive Ferments_, points out the fact that when men under the
stress of circumstances have been compelled to subsist on uncooked
grains of the cereals, they soon fell into a state of inanition and
disease.Animal diet is also more easily digested in the cooked than in the raw
state.The advantage consists chiefly in the effects of heat on the
connective tissue and in the separation of the muscular fibre.In this
respect cooking aids the digestive process.The gastric juice cannot
get at the albumen-containing fibrillae until the connective tissue is
broken up, removed, or dissolved.Hot water softens and removes this
connective tissue.Hence raw meat is less easily digestible.Carnivorous animals, that get their food at long intervals, digest it
slowly.By cutting, bruising, and scraping meat we to a certain extent
imitate the process of cooking.In many cases, indeed, ill-nourished
children and dyspeptics digest raw beef thus comminuted better than
cooked, and it is a matter of observation that steamed and underdone
roast meats are more digestible than when submitted to greater heat.Some interesting observations have been made by Roberts on the effects
of the digestive ferments on cooked and uncooked albuminoids.He
employed in his experiments a solution of egg albumen made by mixing
white of egg with nine times its volume of water."This solution," says
Roberts, "when boiled in the water-bath does not coagulate nor sensibly
change its appearance, but its behavior with the digestive ferments is
completely altered.In the raw state this solution is attacked very
slowly by pepsin and acid, and pancreatic extract has no effect on it;
but after being cooked in the water-bath the albumen is rapidly and
entirely digested by artificial gastric juice, and a moiety of it is
rapidly digested by pancreatic extract."It is a mistake, however, to suppose that cooking is equally necessary
for all kinds of albuminoids.The oyster, at least, is quite
exceptional, for it contains a digestive ferment--the hepatic
diastase--which is wholly destroyed by cooking.Milk may be
indifferently used either in the cooked or uncooked state, and fruits,
which owe their value chiefly to sugar, are not altered by cooking.The object in introducing here these remarks on cooking food is to show
that it forms an important integral part of the work of digestion, and
has a direct bearing on the management of all forms of dyspepsia.Haste in eating, with imperfect mastication, is a common cause of
indigestion in this country.Mastication is the first step in the
digestive {446} process.It is important, therefore, that we have good
teeth and that we take time to thoroughly masticate our food, for by so
doing we prepare it for being acted upon by the juices of the stomach.Time is also necessary in order that the salivary secretion may be
incorporated with the alimentary substances.By the salivary diastase
starch is converted into sugar and albuminoids are prepared for the
action of the gastric juice.If these changes take place imperfectly,
the stomach can scarcely regain in gastric digestion what was lost in
imperfect mastication and insalivation.Haste in eating is one of the
American vices.It grows out of the temperament of our people.We are
jealous of lost time, and unfortunately this time is too often taken
from the stomach.We bolt our food with unseemly haste, and pay the
penalty in ruined stomachs.Many cases of indigestion are greatly
relieved, if not permanently cured, by simply doubling or quadrupling
the time occupied in eating.Irregularity in the intervals between meals, such as taking one meal
only in twenty-four hours or taking food before the preceding supply
has been digested, is another fruitful source of indigestion.The
digestive process, in the natural order of change, is confused; changes
which should take place are delayed; and the results are such as arise
from excessive eating.Moreover, the stomach lacks the rest so
essential to digestion.The necessary interval, however, between meals
varies with the nature of the food taken."Between the extremes of the
carnivorae," says Ewald, "which feed once in twenty-four hours, and the
herbivorae, which never have done with the business of feeding, man
holds a middle place, but not without permitting the recognition in the
course of his life of a sort of transition from the herbivora to the
carnivora.Infants should have the breast during the first three weeks
as often as they wake; after that every two hours to the third month;
then up to dentition every three hours; and later there should be five
meals in twenty-four hours."But to this general statement there are,
of course, many exceptions.Under certain pathological conditions food
should be taken in small quantities at short intervals.This is
especially the case in chronic gastric catarrh and in feeble digestion
of nervous subjects.Such patients are not unfrequently improved by
becoming again infants or herbivorae.By the use of an exclusive milk
diet or peptonized milk gruels, given in small quantities at
comparatively short intervals of time, the stomach may be so
accommodated that it will digest without discomfort a large amount of
nourishment within a given time.To S. Weir Mitchell of Philadelphia we
are indebted for some valuable observations bearing upon this point of
forced alimentation.To the causes of indigestion already alluded to may be added the habit
of spirit-drinking, especially the habit of taking alcohol undiluted on
an empty stomach, which rarely fails after a time to engender dyspeptic
symptoms.It is a prominent factor in the production of chronic gastric
catarrh--a condition more frequently present in painful indigestion
than any that have been named.It is one of the most common diseases
met with in practice.Indeed, all causes already alluded to involve,
sooner or later, if they are constantly operative, irritative and
catarrhal conditions of the mucous membrane of the stomach, so that we
find it difficult at times--indeed impossible--to separate purely
functional from subacute inflammatory forms of dyspepsia.Practically,
we simply study the {447} subject in the relative degrees of prominence
of the one condition or the other.But, in a still more comprehensive sense, indigestion is caused by
disturbance of organs directly associated with the stomach in the
digestive process.All organs closely associated with each other in
their physiological functions are apt to become associated in morbid
action.The clinical recognition of this is a matter of great
importance in the management of gastric affections.And first in the
order of importance in such association is the liver.So closely,
indeed, are the liver and stomach functionally associated in the
process of primary assimilation that they may be considered parts of
the same great digestive apparatus.Hence disturbance of the
liver--either in the formation of glycogen, the destruction of
albuminoid matter, or the secretion of bile--is immediately
communicated to the stomach.It may be difficult to say which of these
separate and distinct functions of the liver is most at fault; that can
only be a matter of physiological inference.In the one case, for
instance, the dyspeptic may be fairly well nourished, yet his
elimination may be bad.In the other there is no failure of the
destructive and excreting functions, but those concerned in the
assimilation of fat and peptones are disordered, so that the patient is
not well nourished, so far as the fatty element is concerned.This is
the more common form, and a form not unfrequently associated with
pulmonary consumption.The liver finally becomes fatty--a condition
usually found associated with the constitutional forms of phthisis.The pancreas is also closely associated with the stomach, and its
secretion is of essential value in the digestive process.It is to be
regretted that our precise knowledge of its diseases is in such
striking contrast with its importance in the animal economy, and yet it
can scarcely be doubted that in dyspeptic symptoms associated with
failure of digestion of starchy, albuminous, and fatty elements of food
there is disorder of the secretion of the pancreas.Hence in the
treatment of the early stages of pulmonary consumption and other
disorders associated with deficient digestion and assimilation of fatty
substances the importance of directing our attention to the condition
of the liver and pancreas, as well as to the stomach.That morbid states of the intestinal track occupy a prominent place in
the etiology of dyspepsia is also a well-recognized clinical fact.Indeed, constipation of the bowels is an almost universal accompaniment
of deranged digestion, and when persistent for years it is apt to lead
to the most disastrous consequences.These are mainly in the direction
of lessened elimination from the intestinal glandulae.The general
symptomatology of deficient excretion from these glandulae is closely
analogous to the same condition of the liver: there is impairment of
the general health; the clear florid complexion disappears; the patient
becomes of a greenish or sallow hue; the blood is altered in quality;
fatigue is experienced after the slightest exertion; the nights are
restless; and there is great tendency to mental despondency.Moreover,
constipation often precedes the gastric symptoms.The diminished
muscular activity of the intestinal track extends to the stomach; its
movements are diminished; food is not properly mixed with the gastric
juice, and by being too long retained in the stomach in a comparatively
undigested state acetous fermentation in the saccharine and starchy
articles of diet is set {448} up, acid eructations and a sour taste in
the mouth being commonly complained of.Dyspepsia associated with this
condition of the intestinal track cannot be relieved until the
constipation is relieved, and by overcoming the constipation the
dyspeptic symptoms often disappear.Mention has been made of the baneful influence of certain mental states
in the production of dyspeptic symptoms.But there are forms of
indigestion due to local nervous disturbance existing elsewhere than in
the nerve-centres.This was ascribed by the older writers to what they
termed consensus nervorum, or sympathy, by which "the operation of a
stimulus is not limited to the nerves immediately irritated, but is
extended to distant parts in known or unknown connection with the
irritated nerves."An intimate acquaintance with this law of sympathy
is of the utmost importance in the study of the functional forms of
dyspepsia, for no other organ of the body is subjected to such a wide
range of reflected nervous disturbance as the stomach.Morbid
sympathetic impressions are transmitted mainly through branches of the
vaso-motor nerve of the semilunar ganglia of the abdomen, and from the
pneumogastric to the stomach.Thus, a pregnant uterus not unfrequently
produces very troublesome vomiting; some females suffer from nausea and
indigestion during each menstrual period; and the more chronic forms of
pelvic irritation, such as a flexed uterus, and endometritis,
cervicitis, or tender ovary, may be the continuous exciting cause of
most troublesome forms of nervous dyspepsia.There is also close
sympathy of the stomach with the lungs and heart through the
distribution of the pneumogastric.So also may fixed points of
irritation in any part of the nervous system be reflexly transmitted to
the stomach, giving rise to most pronounced symptoms of indigestion.And it is evident that in all such cases but little can be accomplished
in the way of relieving the dyspeptic symptoms until the cause upon
which they depend is removed.The treatment must have reference mainly
to the removal of such cause.Lastly, all the causes mentioned finally concur in producing
irregularities of the mechanism of digestion; and this may be done by
disturbing either the muscular movements of the stomach or in
suspending or perverting the gastric solvents, or in these two
conditions combined.Referable to the Stomach.--The symptoms which attend
and indicate the presence of functional dyspepsia are such as accompany
in a greater or less degree almost all cases of chronic gastritis.Clinically, so far as the direct gastric symptoms are concerned, it is
difficult to separate them.The more prominent of the local symptoms
are--a sense of fulness and distension after meals, discomfort during
the digestive process, derangement of appetite, acid eructations,
flatulence, regurgitations of food, and sometimes nausea and vomiting.There is seldom severe pain; the sensation is rather that of
uneasiness.Exceptionally, however, there may be pain, which radiates
from the stomach to the shoulders, and may pass down the left arm so as
to simulate angina pectoris.But it may be readily distinguished from
that complaint by coming on after food, and not after exertion.In
other cases a sense of constriction may be accompanied by dyspnoea,
arising from impeded movements of the diaphragm from being pushed
upward by the distended stomach, or there may be heartburn, with an
ill-defined sense of burning felt in the epigastrium; {449} but thirst,
so frequently present in chronic gastritis, is, as a rule, absent in
functional dyspepsia.These symptoms are manifested in varying degrees
of prominence in individual cases, and some of them are rarely found
present.Thus, nausea and vomiting are not characteristic features of
the chronic forms of functional dyspepsia, and as a rule epigastric
tenderness is entirely absent.In markedly hysterical subjects or in
persons whose nervous system has been unduly excited by alcohol there
may be shrinking from the slightest touch upon pressure; but in these
cases the tenderness is not confined to the stomach, nor is it
increased by deep pressure.In some cases there is an unnatural craving
for food--a symptom rarely if ever observed in structural lesions of
the stomach--and now and then it happens that the appetite becomes
depraved, especially with hysterical patients.They crave indigestible
and unnatural substances, such as earth, chalk, and substances wholly
devoid of alimentary properties.Impairment of appetite, however, is
the more common feature of this form of indigestion.Flatulence and eructations are generally complained of, the flatulence
being accompanied by a painful sense of fulness, affecting in equal
degree the stomach and small intestines.It is derived principally from
putrefactive or fermentative changes of the ingesta, which are
imperfectly elaborated in the stomach.The gases consist of carbonic
acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and the hydrocarbons,
the butyric and acetic fermentations furnishing the hydrogen and
carbonic acid gas.In addition to these marsh gas is formed by a
special fermentation, the basis of which exists in the cellulose taken
with vegetable food.In excessive meteorism from paralysis of the
intestines the gas is principally nitrogen; the marsh-gas fermentation
results from the ingestion of certain easily-fermentable vegetables,
such as cabbage, cauliflower, etc.In a certain proportion of cases regurgitation occurs from the stomach.The liquor regurgitated may be intensely acid from the presence of some
of the fatty acids, probably butyric, lactic, or acetic.Exceptionally,
it may be insipid or brackish, constituting what is known as pyrosis,
or water-brash.The fluid is usually tasteless and without smell, and
in reaction it is neutral to test-paper.It contains sulphocyanuret of
potassium, and it has been supposed therefore to be only saliva.The
quantity thrown up may vary from a spoonful to a pint or more.It
affects females more than males, and especially those who subsist upon
coarse and indigestible food.It is best treated by astringents--such
as kino, krameria, logwood, or tannin--administered in the intervals
between digestion, so that they may act directly on the mucous
membrane.The oxide and nitrate of silver are thought by some to be
superior to the vegetable astringents.Cardialgia is a painful condition of the stomach, usually referred to
its cardiac orifice, and is popularly known as heartburn.It is met
with in both functional and organic disease of the stomach.It is very
constantly present in chronic catarrhal gastritis, and evidently
depends upon the presence of an acid, for it is usually promptly
relieved by alkalies, such as chalk, magnesia, soda, or alkaline saline
waters.Food containing much fat, starch, or sugar should be avoided.Nausea and vomiting are only occasional symptoms of functional
dyspepsia.When vomiting does occur it may take place at different
times {450} and with varying degrees of severity, differing in this
respect from the nausea and vomiting of subacute gastritis, which takes
place, if at all, soon after the ingestion of food.The time of
vomiting and the character of the matter ejected are liable to great
variation in functional dyspepsia.It may be the result of direct
irritation of morbidly sensitive gastric nerves, or it may be a reflex
phenomenon; it may follow soon after the ingestion of food, or it may
come on when the stomach is empty; the material vomited may be simply
food but little altered or an alkaline ropy mucus; it may consist in
the acid juices of the stomach or in a neutral watery fluid; or the
ingesta may have undergone fermentative and putrefactive changes from
either insufficient amount of the gastric solvent or from narrowing
(constriction) of the pyloric extremity, in which case the yeast fungus
(Torula cerevisiae) or the Sarcina ventriculi may be found in great
abundance in the vomited matter.Vomiting of this kind usually occurs
some time after eating.The gastric juice itself checks putrefaction;
so also does the admixture of bile.In the absence of these natural
antiseptics fermentation takes place.But it would be erroneous to
suppose that the fermentative dyspepsia is the primary disease; it is a
symptom which can be permanently corrected only by correcting the
condition upon which it depends.Among the most noticeable of the phenomena referable to other organs
than the stomach are those connected with the liver and the alimentary
canal.The tongue in dyspeptic troubles varies much in character.In
reflex sympathetic indigestion it is not unfrequently clean; in hepatic
dyspepsia it is generally thickly coated with a white or yellow fur.The symptoms are such as pertain more especially to chronic
gastro-duodenal catarrh, such as nausea, epigastric oppression, furred
tongue, heartburn, acid eructations, flatulent distension of the
stomach and bowels, unpleasant taste in the mouth, offensive breath,
loaded urine, frontal headache, irritability, and hypochondriasis.Constipation, as we have seen, is an almost universal accompaniment of
functional dyspepsia, sustaining to it not unfrequently a causative
relation.It is undoubtedly one of the most common of the slighter
ailments of civilized life, and exerts a wide influence in deranging
the general health."It is quite extraordinary how many different
derangements of health may result from imperfect action or a torpid
state of the secreting and expelling structures of the large bowel.There may be violent and persistent nerve-pains, referred to the back,
or hip, or groin, and certain other symptoms which lead pessimist
practitioners, excelling in the discovery of neuroses, to diagnose
structural changes in some part of the spinal cord or the antecedent
state which is supposed to lead to them" (Beale).Pains in the loins
and thighs, violent lumbar pain, and certain remediable forms of
sciatica are sometimes due to imperfect excretion of the lower part of
the alimentary canal.And it is even possible that a condition of
hypochondria bordering on insanity may be brought about by
long-continued defective action of the bowels.In exceptional cases of
dyspepsia diarrhoea may be present.This is more frequently the case
when indigestion is associated with a congested state of the liver, in
which case the symptom should be regarded as curative.Excessive
irritability of the muscular walls of the stomach, superadded to weak
digestion, may also be followed by lienteric forms of diarrhoea.Undigested {451} food hastily finds its way into the intestinal track,
and not unfrequently appears in the fecal evacuations.Functional derangements of the stomach are often accompanied by pale
urate deposits in the urine.It may contain an excess of phosphates,
and in microscopical examination crystals of the oxalate of lime are
frequently found, constituting a special affection described by
Golding-Bird as oxaluria.He associated it with irritative dyspepsia,
hypochondriasis, and exhaustion of nerve-power.This form of dyspepsia
is best managed by the mineral, vegetable, and acid tonics, to which
may be added small doses of nux vomica, with the usual adjuvants of
good air and exercise, freedom from anxiety and care, cold sea-water
baths, and well-selected, generous animal diet.Another form of dyspepsia is sometimes associated with a peculiar form
of dizziness--gastric vertigo.German writers speak of it as abdominal
dizziness, and Trousseau calls it vertigo stomicale.It is usually an
acute symptom, begins without any premonition, and is liable to be
confounded with disease of the brain.It sometimes occurs soon after a
meal, but more often when the stomach is empty (Trousseau).It perhaps,
in a majority of cases, depends upon dyspepsia, but it has to be
differentiated from organic brain disease, from cerebral anaemia,
cerebral hyperaemia, the slighter forms of epilepsy, Miniere's disease,
and general nervous exhaustion and depression.But in many cases it
will be found that treatment directed against the dyspepsia cures the
vertigo.Dyspeptic patients are also liable to skin diseases, and especially is
this observed in the gastro-duodenal forms of indigestion.Disorders of
the skin, such as urticaria, erythema, lichen, eczema, and other allied
conditions, are well-recognized external indications at times of
disordered conditions of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane.Thus,
it is a matter of common observation that the gastric symptoms increase
when the eruption on the surface disappears.The general influence of the nervous system over the function of
digestion is perhaps the most remarkable feature of the disease, so
that disturbed innervation becomes conspicuous in its symptomatology.Languor, drowsiness after
taking food, depression of spirits, irritability, hypochondriasis,
sleeplessness, palpitation, dry cough, dyspnoea, are all of common
occurrence; and the mental disturbance--the anxiety, gloom, and
sadness--is to many dyspeptics more distressing than absolute pain.It is impossible, however, to present, in this connection, a complete
clinical history of functional dyspepsia, for the reason that it is
associated with so many separate and distinct affections, the dyspepsia
itself being symptomatic of these affections.PATHOLOGY.--But little is known of the pathology of the purely
functional forms of dyspepsia beyond what is expressed by the terms
atony and asthenia.These express simply certain states of the system
with which atonic dyspepsia is so frequently found associated.Pathological anatomy has shown, however, that some cases are dependent
upon, or associated with, certain appreciable alterations of the
stomach, such as atrophy of the mucous membrane or fatty degeneration
of its walls; and not unfrequently it is the seat of the so-called
amyloid or lardaceous degeneration, although this albuminoid
infiltration or cloudy {452} swelling is more frequently the
accompaniment of chronic inflammatory process.But Jones and Fenwick
have shown that these conditions may occur independently of
inflammation.However, upon this point we are compelled to speak with
caution.The boundary-line between functional and structural diseases
is not always clearly defined.Functional and structural troubles of
the stomach are certainly very intimately associated.Moreover,
symptoms of purely functional dyspepsia are so frequently associated
with the subacute forms of gastritis that the pathology of the disease
becomes, from necessity, doubtful and complex.It can only be studied
in connection with certain states or conditions of which functional
derangement of the stomach is a symptom readily recognized during life.In the light of more advanced physiological and pathological researches
we may expect the limits of purely functional dyspepsia to be much
restricted.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of atonic dyspepsia must have special
reference to its etiology.It is usually a chronic disease, and has to
be discriminated from subacute or chronic inflammation of the stomach.This is the more difficult because many symptoms exist in common in
both varieties of indigestion.But in functional or atonic dyspepsia
the symptoms are not so continuous; there is less epigastric
uneasiness, less tenderness, less nausea or loathing of food, less
thirst, and less acidity and heartburn, less emaciation, less cerebral
and nervous disturbance, and the constitutional symptoms are also less
severe.The tongue, as a rule, is not so thickly coated, is not so red
or broad and flabby, the papillae are less marked, the breath less
offensive, and the urine, instead of showing a condition of lithaemia,
is not unfrequently pale and sometimes neutral, depositing oxalates and
phosphates, especially in feeble, broken-down conditions of the nervous
system.With other painful affections of the stomach, such as ulcer and cancer,
it is not likely to be confounded, especially when in these affections
pain, vomiting, and haematemesis are present.TREATMENT.--The first and leading indication is to remove, as far as
possible, all causes of the disease, and this requires patient research
and much diagnostic skill.Suggestive hints of treatment may be found
in connection with the discussion of the varied etiology of the
disease.We can, in conclusion, only allude to the matter in a very
general way.Special cases must furnish their own indications of
treatment.In many cases a condition of nervous asthenia will be found prominently
present.A leading indication, therefore, irrespective of the special
determining cause, is to improve the general health of the patient; and
this is accomplished by all means which invigorate the system
generally.And first in the order of importance are diet and regimen.It is evident that if a patient eat too much or too often, or if he eat
indigestible or unwholesome food, or lead an indolent and luxurious
life, nothing can be accomplished by way of drugs in the relief of the
disease.Excessive alimentation is, as we have seen, a most prolific
source of the disease.Tempted to excess by great variety and by the
ingenuity of culinary refinements, the stomach is burdened beyond its
capacity of digestion and beyond the actual requirements of the system;
and especially is this the case with those who live sedentary, indoor
lives.In all such cases it is absolutely essential that the digestive
organs have rest.{453} Better even in cases of doubt reduce the diet
for a time below the actual wants of the system until waste products
are thoroughly removed and appetite is revived.The benefit derived in
some instances from the protracted use of purgative mineral waters is
largely attributable to the restricted regimen enforced and to the
washing out of the system the waste products.On the other hand, too great or too protracted abstemiousness may
equally impair the digestive process.In ordinary forms of atonic
dyspepsia we should seek rather, by appropriate treatment, to raise the
digestive capacity to the level of digesting good, healthy, nutritious
food, than to reduce the food to the low standard of feeble digestion.But it is a mistake to suppose that this can be accomplished by simply
forcing food upon a stomach that lacks capacity of digestion.As to the kind of diet, no precise rule is suited to all cases.Within
certain limits individual experience must be consulted.But these
experiences are not always reliable.Dyspeptic patients, more than any
others, are apt to have fancies.Certain general rules, therefore,
should be insisted upon.The food should be wholesome and digestible;
it should be well cooked, well masticated, and taken at regular and not
too long intervals.The intervals of time between meals depend upon
circumstances already referred to.In some cases small quantities of
easily-digested food should be taken at short intervals.In cases of
feeble digestion of nervous subjects milk diluted in Seltzer water, or
milk and lime-water, or peptonized milk, may be taken in liberal
quantities at comparatively short intervals of time.Sometimes
isinglass, arrowroot, or ground rice may be advantageously combined
with the milk, to which tender, undone meats may be added.Peptonized Food.--Recently the attention of the profession has been
attracted to artificially digested food.The essential acts of
digestion are known to be chemical transmutations.Albuminoid
substances are changed into peptones and starchy matters are changed
into dextrin and sugar.To Roberts, in his excellent lectures delivered
in the Lumleian course before the Royal College of Physicians of London
in 1880, we are indebted for valuable information on the digestive
ferments and in the preparation and use of artificially-digested food;
and from these lectures we shall derive most of the information we
possess at present.It has been demonstrated that an extract of the
stomach or pancreas, in water, has to a certain extent the same powers
as the natural secretions of these organs.Hence, says Roberts, it is
possible for us to subject articles of food beforehand to complete or
partial digestion.Heat approximatively accomplishes the same thing.In
the practice of cookery we have, as it were, a foreshadowing of this
art of artificial digestion.Heat and digestive ferments alike aid
gastric digestion.In case of the lower animals the whole process has
to be accomplished by the labor of their own digestive organs.Artificially digested food may be prepared in two ways--either by
following the gastric method with pepsin and hydrochloric acid, or by
following the intestinal method and using extract of pancreas.Both of
these plans have had special advocates.Roberts claims that the latter
yields by far the better results."The pancreas not only acts upon
albuminous substances, but also upon starch.Pepsin, on the other hand,
is {454} quite inert in regard to starch.Moreover, the products of
artificial digestion with pepsin and acid are much less agreeable to
the taste and smell than those produced by pancreatic extract."The
pancreas of the pig, according to Roberts, yields the most active
preparation, but the pancreas of the ox or the sheep may be employed.The pancreas of the calf is not active on starchy materials.A very
active extract of pancreas is now prepared, and is easily obtainable,
with directions for making peptonized milk, milk gruel, milk punch,
soups, jellies, blanc-manges, beef-tea, enemata, etc.It is important
to remember that peptonized foods do not keep well, especially in warm
weather.If a quantity sufficient for twenty-four hours be prepared at
any one time, the quantity which remains over twelve hours should be
reboiled before using.Food thus peptonized is indicated in feeble
conditions of digestion and when the derangement of digestion results
from causes pertaining to the condition of the stomach itself--_i.e._
catarrhal forms of dyspepsia.As a rule, the food should be such as will require the least possible
exertion on the part of the stomach.Raw vegetables should be
forbidden; pastries, fried dishes, and all rich and greasy compounds
should be eschewed; and whatever food be taken should be eaten slowly
and well masticated.Many patients digest animal better than vegetable
food.Tender brown meats, plainly but well cooked, such as beef,
mutton, and game, are to be preferred.Lightly-cooked mutton is more
digestible than beef, pork, or lamb, and roast beef is more digestible
than boiled.Pork and veal and salted and preserved meats are
comparatively indigestible.Bread should never be eaten hot or
fresh--better be slightly stale--and bread made from the whole meal is
better than that made from the mere starchy part of the grain.Milk and
eggs and well-boiled rice are of special value.But to all these general dietetic rules there may be exceptions growing
out of the peculiarities of individual cases.The aged, for obvious reasons, require less food than the
young; the middle-aged, inclined to obesity and troubled with feeble
digestion, should avoid potatoes, sweets, and fatty substances and
spirituous liquors; persons suffering from functional derangements of
the liver should be put, for a time, on the most restricted regimen;
while, on the contrary, the illy fed and badly-nourished require the
most nutritious food that can be digested with comfort to the patient.The general regimen should be tonic and invigorating.The patient
should have the benefit of the best possible hygiene.Under this head
may be mentioned suitable clothing, fresh air, moderate exercise,
sunlight, baths, rest, regular hours, and the abandonment of all bad
habits.No single measure has such marked influence on the digestive
powers of the stomach as systematic, well-regulated muscular exercise
in the open air, and especially if the exercise be accompanied by a
cheerful mental state.Hunting, fishing, boating, are known to excite the keenest appetite for
food, and the stomach will digest substances that would distress it
under other circumstances.Exhaustion, however, is to be carefully
avoided.Horseback exercise is a remedy of much value, especially in
the hepatic forms of indigestion.The mental and moral treatment of the purely functional forms of {455}
indigestion are amongst the most powerful means we possess.As an
etiological factor certain morbid mental states rank first, as we have
seen, in the order of importance.Grief, despondency, and despair are
effectual barriers to digestion, and in a less degree mental worry
seriously interferes with the process.It is a matter of prime
importance, therefore, that the patient's mind be pleasantly occupied,
that he should be free from all care and mental worry, and that he
especially be kept from dwelling, if possible, upon his own bodily
ailments.This is often best accomplished by travel, when practicable,
in foreign countries, where everything will be novel and new and
calculated to lead him away from himself.Get him to travel, says
Watson, in search of his health, and the chances are in favor of his
finding it.We have the authority of Sir James Johnson also for saying
that no case of purely functional dyspepsia can resist a pedestrian
tour over the Alps.We come now to discuss the medical treatment of dyspepsia, which,
though not unimportant, is subordinate to the general hygienic measures
already referred to.General hints of treatment have been made in
connection with special causes mentioned in the text.We seek, in a
general way, by therapeutic measures--

1st.To stimulate the secreting and muscular coats of the stomach;

2d.To supply materials in which it is supposed the gastric juice is
defective;

3d.To lessen abnormal irritability;

4th.To combat special symptoms or conditions which may hinder the
digestive process.To meet these indications innumerable remedies have been recommended,
but they are of benefit only as they counteract the conditions upon
which the dyspepsia depends.For loss of appetite, if there are no
contraindications to their use, the vegetable bitters are often useful,
such as quassia, gentian, and columbo.Of these columbo is the simplest
of its class, but none more generally useful than mistura gentianae
with soda.The Hydrastis canadensis has also peculiar claims as a
bitter stomachic.It, perhaps more than any of the bitters, promotes
gastric secretion in feeble digestion, and has at the same time
peculiar salutary effects on the enfeebled condition of the chronically
inflamed gastric mucous membrane.It is supposed also to have a
stimulating effect on the pancreatic secretion.It may be given in the
form of a fluid extract combined with glycerin and small doses of nux
vomica.Among the specific stimulating nerve-tonics, nux vomica, or its
alkaloid, strychnia, deserves special mention.In small tonic doses it
is specially indicated in conditions of general nervous prostration
associated with a tendency to hypochondriasis.In such cases we
frequently observe pale urine, containing an excess of the phosphates.The mineral acids are valuable additions to the bitter tonics in all
broken-down conditions of the nervous system.In administering nux
vomica care should be taken as to limitation of time and dose.The
excessive or prolonged use of the drug is apt to produce serious
general nervous disturbance, the secondary condition being often the
opposite to that for which it was prescribed.Temporary saccharine
diabetes is not unfrequently one of the results.In atony of the mucous membrane, with morbid sensibility and slow {456}
digestion, ipecacuanha is a remedy of much value.It was first brought
into prominent notice in connection with gastric affections by Budd,
since which time it has been more or less used by the profession.In
torpid, slow digestion, with depraved or lessened gastric secretion, it
is of undoubted value.It should be given on an empty stomach at least
half an hour before meals.The dose should be short of producing
nausea.We may commence with two to four drops of the tincture or wine
of ipecac, and gradually increase until we find the point of tolerance;
or it may be given in the form of pill in doses of a quarter or a half
grain before meals, combining it with rhubarb in three- or four-grain
doses.Ipecacuanha may be administered at the same time we are giving
the mineral acids, or mineral acids with pepsin.Adjuvants to Digestion.--In atony of the stomach the gastric mucous
membrane responds feebly to the stimulus of food.There is failure in
both muscular movement and gastric secretion, with slowness of
digestion as a result.To meet this condition we seek to increase the
digestive power by the addition of certain principles natural to the
digestive process--viz.the mineral acids, pepsin, and pancreatin.Of
these acids, the hydrochloric should be preferred, because it is the
natural acid of the gastric juice.Lactic, nitro-hydrochloric, and
phosphoric acids have also been used with benefit.There can be no
doubt of the efficacy of either of these preparations.They are best
given when the stomach is empty, so that they may directly act on the
relaxed atonic mucous membrane.Half an hour before or two hours after
a meal is the best time for their administration, and to be of benefit
they should be administered for a length of time.From fifteen to
twenty minims of the dilute hydrochloric or nitro-hydrochloric acid may
be given in some bitter tincture or infusion for months.An elegant
preparation may be made by adding the acid to tincture of orange-peel
and syrup of lemon.Aromatic tincture, tincture of ginger, or glycerin
may be added in some cases.It is important that remedies administered
in gastric affections should be made pleasant as possible to the
patient.Metallic preparations are of use in some cases.If for any reason they
are preferred, the perchloride of iron is one of the very best
preparations.Arsenic and zinc may also be tried in small doses.Pepsin and its Uses.--Of the efficacy of pepsin as an artificial
substitute for the normal solvent of the food adverse opinions have
been expressed, but in spite of the most critical scepticism as to its
action its use since first introduced into medicine has steadily
increased.It has been shown to be the natural constituent of the
gastric juice and glands, and as a natural ferment, when combined with
hydrochloric acid, it constitutes the most important solvent of the
nitrogenous portions of our diet (Habershon).There is a vast number of
different preparations of pepsin in the market, and some of them are
doubtless of little value.We ought to be quite sure that the article
is what it purports to be.The pepsina porce is the best preparation,
one grain of which, says Beale, ought to thoroughly digest one hundred
grains of boiled white of egg in three or four hours at a temperature
of 100 degrees F. His test as to the value of pepsin is as follows:
"One hundred grains of hard-boiled white of egg, cut into thin slices,
may be placed in a wide-mouthed bottle or flask with one ounce of water
and twenty drops of dilute hydrochloric acid.One {457} grain of pepsin
powder is to be added, and the mixture placed before a fire at a
temperature of about 100 degrees F. The flask is to be shaken from time
to time.In about an hour the white of egg begins to look transparent
at the edges, and in about four hours it will be completely dissolved
if the pepsin is good."In cases of feeble digestion from deficiency of
gastric juice pepsin is a valuable adjuvant to the digestive power, and
may be given with advantage in connection with the mineral acids or
with ipecacuanha or capsicum before meals.Special Remedies.--There are certain symptoms characteristic of the
different forms and complications of dyspepsia that require special
remedies.It is especially indicated where
there is a morbid painful condition of the gastric nerves.The
subnitrate or carbonate of bismuth may be given in ten- or twenty-grain
doses, suspended in water by means of mucilage of acacia, and flavored
with ginger or peppermint.It should always be given on an empty
stomach.Other elegant preparations supposed to be improvements upon
these have been recommended, and may be tried.In cases of anaemia, if there are no contraindications, iron may be
tried.If digested and assimilated, it improves the blood, and this is
often the first step in the direction of restoring functional activity.Of the preparations of iron, none is perhaps superior to the
perchloride.The saccharo-carbonate and the ammonio-citrate are also
valuable and unirritating salts of iron, and may be given with other
tonics.Ferruginous mineral waters slightly charged with carbonic acid
are well tolerated in small doses.The free dilution favors the action,
and is frequently more acceptable to the stomach than the more
concentrated forms.From one-half to one glassful may be taken at a
time; and the use of iron in this form may be preceded or accompanied
by the administration of small doses of quinia and of the bitter
tonics.But it is a mistake to commence the treatment by the
indiscriminate use of iron, quinine, and nerve-tonics.The
contraindications to the use of iron are irritable and inflammatory
states of the mucous membrane, or dyspepsia associated with deranged
conditions of secretion, as manifested by dirty tongue and loaded
urine.When the nervous system is prominently at fault, nux vomica, arsenic,
and the nitrate and oxide of silver often prove to be valuable
remedies.Here also benefit may be derived from the lighter ferruginous
preparations; indeed, few combinations have greater influence over the
nervous system than the joint action of arsenic and iron.Much benefit
may also be derived, in special cases, from methodical
hydro-therapeutic treatment.If judiciously used it strengthens the
nervous system, stimulates the organic functions, and increases the
power of vital resistance.And in some cases of nervous dyspepsia
electricity gives good results.In all cases of nervous prostration as
much wholesome food should be taken as the stomach can easily digest.In hepatic forms of indigestion there is no substitute for an
occasional mercurial cathartic, for, notwithstanding adverse criticism,
clinical experience has taught the great value of this drug upon the
upper portion of the intestinal track.The mode of operation may be
doubtful, but the result is unquestionable.In functional disturbance
of the liver or morbid conditions of the upper portion of the
intestinal track, as indicated {458} by the loaded tongue, sallow
complexion, want of appetite, and lithaemia, no remedy will give so
much relief as a few broken doses of calomel, followed by a saline
aperient; or eight or ten grains of blue mass, with a grain of
ipecacuanha, may be administered at bedtime, followed by a saline
draught in the morning.After the bowels are thoroughly unloaded by a
mercurial, great advantage may be derived from a systematic course of
the aperient mineral waters--the Friedrichshall, the Hunyadi, Carlsbad,
or some of the mineral waters of our own country.The hepatic form of
indigestion cannot be relieved until we relieve the congested hepatic
portal system, and this is best accomplished by the general line of
treatment here indicated.The simple vegetable bitters, with or without
alkalies, may be used at the same time or subsequent to this treatment;
but they are often worse than useless until we secure freedom of
abdominal circulation.The diet should be light and nourishing, and the
patient should spend most of his time out of doors.Horseback exercise
is peculiarly advantageous.But in many cases of the more chronic forms of dyspepsia the colon is
as atonic as the stomach, and therefore the bowels require special
attention.In colonic dyspepsia all active purgation should be avoided,
and salines, such as sulphate of magnesia, the Hunyadi and other saline
mineral waters, should be specially prohibited.The most useful
aperients in such cases are rhubarb, aloes, senna, colocynth, or
podophyllin.Few laxatives answer a better purpose than the ordinary
compound rhubarb pill.It may be improved, in special cases, by
combining with it extract of nux vomica or belladonna.When there is no
affection of the rectum to forbid its use, the watery extract of aloes
answers very well, and, unlike many cathartic substances, the dose need
not be increased, nor does it disturb the digestive process.It may be
given in one-sixth of a grain up to a grain or more, and its purgative
action may be improved by being reduced to a state of very minute
division and combining with it small doses of belladonna.Belladonna
itself is a useful remedy.According to the observations of Harley, it
"tones and tightens the longitudinal fibre, while it relaxes the
circular;" and long before this theory of its action was suggested,
Trousseau called attention to its singular efficacy in producing easy
and natural evacuations from the bowels.It is important to observe its
mode of use.It should be given in sixth of a grain doses of the
extract in the morning a half hour or hour before breakfast.Its
efficacy may be increased by combining with it small doses of the
watery extract of aloes.In colicky conditions of the bowels two- or
three-drop doses of tincture of colocynth sometimes act wonderfully
well.In obstinate constipation the free use of diluents at the
termination of digestion is often attended with excellent results.But
the hygienic and dietetic treatment of constipation is even more
important than the medicinal, such as outdoor exercise, the cold bath,
rubbing, kneading the bowels, and the use of bread made of whole meal,
oatmeal, and an abundant supply of fresh vegetables and fruits.Nausea and vomiting, occasional symptoms of functional dyspepsia, may
be relieved by various agents, such as effervescing draughts,
lime-water, oxalate of cerium, hydrocyanic acid, creasote, ice, and
alkalies.When vomiting is dependent on fermentation or putrid action of the
contents of the stomach with development of sarcinae, it may be checked
{459} by carbolic acid or by creasote, or by the sulphite of soda or
sulphurous acid; and in irritable conditions of the stomach bismuth is
a valuable remedy.It may be given with alkalies or with
finely-triturated animal charcoal.Gastric pain needs treatment appropriate to the circumstances under
which it arises.Sometimes it is relieved by regulating the ingesta or
the intervals at which it is taken; sometimes by warm carminative
stimulants or by chloric ether, ginger, or brandy.If the pain is more
constant, approaching a condition of gastralgia, hydrocyanic acid and
bismuth are more effective remedies.But it cannot be too strongly
stated, in conclusion, that in the management of the atonic forms of
dyspepsia hygienic treatment is of prime importance.The hopeful future
of medicine lies in the direction of promoting healthy nutrition, and
this is best accomplished by the careful adaptation of food and
exercise and modes of living to individual cases of disease.Gastralgia (Gastrodynia, Cardialgia, Spasm of the Stomach).Under the head of neuroses of the stomach have been variously described
the conditions indicated in the heading of this section; and a certain
amount of confusion has arisen in the use of these terms from the fact
that they represent subjective sensations common alike to organic and
functional forms of indigestion: pain, for instance, is felt in
gastritis, cancer of the stomach, and ulcer of the stomach.Indeed, it
rarely occurs independently of some disorder of digestion or structural
lesion of the stomach.By gastralgia, considered as a distinct affection, however, we mean a
purely neuralgic condition of the sensory fibres of the stomach,
excluding inflammatory and structural changes on the one hand and
chronic forms of atonic dyspepsia on the other.The attacks are usually
periodical in character, with constricting pain in the pit of the
stomach, and the intervals are not necessarily associated with symptoms
of dyspepsia.It chiefly occurs in females of nervous temperament at
the catamenial periods.Two forms of the disease have been described--one depending on
hyperaesthesia of the sensory fibres of the pneumogastric, the other on
hyperaesthesia of the solar plexus.This may be correct in theory, but
practically it can be of little importance to make the discrimination,
even if it were possible to do so.Clinically, the disease is presented to us in two forms.In one the
pain is agonizing, comes on without premonition, is sometimes
intermittent or remittent in character, and conveys to the sufferer the
idea of spasm; hence it has often been described as colic of the
stomach.If not relieved by appropriate remedies, the pain may last for
hours or days.In the other the pain is more of
a neuralgic character and is not so severe.There may be varying
exacerbations which may last for months or years.This is not an
unfrequent form, and may consist simply in the more acute form becoming
chronic.ETIOLOGY.--With the limitation indicated, we have naturally to seek the
causes of the affection, says Ziemssen, in two directions: either in
the abnormal nature of the irritants to which the gastric nerves are
subjected, {460} or in an altered condition of the nerves themselves,
which therefore react abnormally with the normal degree of irritation.This briefly covers the whole ground of the etiological relations of
the disease.The predisposing causes are such as produce general depressed vitality,
embracing at the same time special conditions of extreme nervous
excitability.Some of these general conditions were pointed out while
speaking of atonic forms of dyspepsia.Indeed, the two conditions are
often associated, and practically it may be difficult to separate them,
although the connection between them is not necessarily an invariable
one.Like atonic dyspepsia, gastralgia is apt to affect anaemic
persons, and notably anaemic females at menstrual periods.Thus, the
association between gastralgia, chlorosis, and hysteria is a matter of
common observation.Of 350 cases noted by Briquet, only 30 had no signs
of gastralgia; and this observation is a fair average expression of the
experience of others.Certain blood-poisons are also known to give rise to the disease.Infection of the blood by malaria was observed by Niemeyer to produce
spasm of the stomach instead of the paroxysms of intermittent fever;
and in malarious regions of the United States the same observation has
been made.Gout and rheumatism are also known to sustain causative
relations to the disease.Certain idiosyncrasies also enter as a factor
into the somewhat complex etiology of the disease.Thus, some persons
suffer immediately from eating certain kinds of food and fruits, such
as shellfish, strawberries, honey, and even milk and coffee.The pain
and spasm are produced by direct contact with the sensory fibres of the
stomach; _i.e._ they react abnormally to normal stimulation.But
disease of the nerve-centres may enter into the causation.This is seen
by the effects of morbid growths impinging upon nerve-trunks; their
terminal branches often become extremely irritable and painful, and
this condition may be intensified by idiosyncrasy.Excessive acidity of
the stomach, seeds of fruit, certain articles of food, the presence of
worms in the stomach, and draughts of ice-water may simply act as
exciting causes to a centric predisposition.Of the more direct causes operating upon nerve-centres, all the
depressing passions and emotions deserve special mention; so do all
causes which produce an exhausted state of innervation, such as
venereal excesses, onanism, the abuse of narcotics, etc.But chief among the causes are those of a reflex kind.Painful
affections of the kidneys, irritable conditions of the bladder,
diseases of the liver, and, above all, morbid conditions of the female
genital organs, sustain a direct and close relation to painful and
spasmodic conditions of the stomach.It is a common accompaniment of
versions, flexions, prolapses, inflammations, erosions of the os, as
well as diseased conditions of the ovaries.When such local conditions
are associated with anaemia and hysteria, patients rarely fail to have
painful gastric complications.SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms of gastralgia, like most of the neuroses, are
characterized by severe pain occurring in paroxysms, followed by
remissions, and sometimes by complete intermissions, again to recur
with varying degrees of severity.The pain in the acute variety is of a
violent, spasmodic character, and is referred to the epigastrium
immediately beneath the ensiform cartilage.Frequently it extends from
the epigastrium to the back and chest and into the right and left
hypochondrium.{461} No one has so briefly and so accurately described
the immediate attack of gastralgia as Romberg: "Suddenly, or after a
precedent feeling of pressure, there is severe griping pain in the pit
of the stomach, usually extending into the back, with a feeling of
faintness, shrunken countenance, cold hands and feet, and small,
intermittent pulse.The pain becomes so excessive that the patient
cries out.The epigastrium is either puffed out like a ball, or, as is
more frequently the case, retracted, with tension of the abdominal
walls.There is often pulsation in the epigastrium.External pressure
is well borne, and not unfrequently the patient presses the pit of the
stomach against some firm substance or compresses it with his hands.Sympathetic pains often occur in the thorax under the sternum, in the
oesophageal branches of the pneumogastric, while they are rare on the
exterior of the body.The attack lasts from a few minutes to half an
hour; then the pain gradually subsides, leaving the patient much
exhausted, or else it ceases suddenly with eructation of gas or watery
fluid, with vomiting, with a gentle soft perspiration, or with the
passage of reddish urine."Besides the violent paroxysmal pain referred to the stomach, symptoms
of derangement of other organs are often present.Prominent among these
are hysterical phenomena which are protean in their manifestations, and
if not recognized they are liable to mislead.Thus, with gastric pain
there may be violent palpitation of the heart, with shortness of
breath, cough, globus, hiccough, and convulsive affections, and in a
certain proportion of cases there is marked melancholia or
hypochondriasis.The stomach is variously modified in its function.In many cases it is
entirely unaffected.The desire for food may be indeed increased, and
its ingestion may give a sense of relief.In others vomiting may be
severe, while in still others there may be merely a condition of
anorexia.The tongue is, as a rule, clean, the skin cool, the
temperature undisturbed, and there is absence of tenderness over the
epigastrium.DIAGNOSIS.--Functional and structural troubles of the stomach very
markedly simulate each other; therefore the diagnosis requires to be
made with great caution, and this is best done by a most rigid and
careful exclusion; and this becomes difficult because the symptoms are
mainly subjective.It is a matter of great moment in differentiating the disease to take
into account all constitutional states which predispose to nervous
asthenia.Thus in conditions of chlorosis and hysteria the presumption
is strong that the pain is neurotic or spasmodic in character; and this
presumption is intensified if there be no accompanying constitutional
symptoms which indicate inflammatory action.We exclude inflammatory
conditions of the stomach by the frequent and complete intermissions,
by the absence of thirst, tenderness, and all febrile movement.Moreover, the pain of inflammatory affections, unless produced by
corrosive poisons, is rarely so severe as in neuralgic affections; nor
are nausea and vomiting so uniformly present in neurotic affections.Then the time at which the pain is experienced is a matter of
importance.In inflammatory affections it is felt immediately on taking
food.In neurotic affections it may occur when the stomach is empty,
and it is not unfrequently relieved by food.In ulcer and cancer of the
stomach pain is a common element, and, as in {462} gastralgia, it is
referred to the epigastrium.But in gastric ulcer the pain is rarely
absent; it is of a dull, gnawing character, is strictly localized in
the centre of the epigastrium, and is aggravated by pressure and by
food.Moreover, the vomited matter often contains blood.In cancer of
the stomach the pain is not as severe and spasmodic in character as in
gastralgia, the vomiting is a more prominent symptom, and the material
vomited has the characteristic cancerous look.Cancer is more apt to
occur too in advanced life, and it is characterized by a steady
progressive emaciation.Gastralgia may also be confounded with rheumatism of the abdominal
muscles as well as neuralgia of the inferior intercostal nerves, and it
is liable to be confounded with colic resulting from biliary calculi.Colicky pains in the transverse portions of the colon may also be
mistaken for pains in the stomach."It is no exaggeration to say," says
Trousseau, "that in perhaps half the cases which are called gastralgia
the affection is nothing more than cholalgia."The more fixed the pain
is to one spot, and the nearer it is to the median line, the greater is
the probability of its being gastric.PROGNOSIS.--Notwithstanding the severe and apparently alarming nature
of the symptoms, the prognosis of gastralgia is in the main favorable,
although the prospect of a permanent and speedy cure is small.The
duration of the disease depends on the nature and persistence of the
exciting causes, and these are so often associated with an exhausted
state of innervation that speedy recovery from the disease cannot be
promised.In the simpler varieties, caused by improper food, the
disease will disappear by removing the cause, and the hysterical forms
are liable to disappear with advancing life.So also cases arising from
malaria, anaemia, chlorosis, uterine disease, rheumatism, and gout may
be relieved by removing the cause.But there are cases produced by
unknown causes, and especially cases associated with a general and
unexplained cachexia, in which the prognosis is not good.TREATMENT.--This is both radical and palliative.The radical treatment
must have reference to the diseases which have given rise to it.If,
for instance, the gastralgia can be traced to sympathetic disturbances
of the uterine organs, no remedy can be permanently effective until the
cause is removed.Since chlorosis and anaemia are so often found
associated with it, benefit may be expected from the ferruginous
preparations in some form.Iron occupies a prominent place as a
remedial agent.The precipitated carbonate is to be preferred on
account of its peculiar influence over the nervous system, and
especially over painful neuralgic conditions.It may be given in drachm
doses, or even larger, combined with ginger or aromatic powder.If the
stomach will not tolerate it, other preparations may be tried.Quinia is a valuable addition to iron, and it is specially valuable in
cases of suspected malarious origin.Sometimes a few large doses will
break up the paroxysmal pains as no other agent will.In the more chronic forms of the disease arsenic is one of the most
reliable remedies we possess.It has a well-deserved reputation in the
treatment of a great variety of nervous affections, and in none more
than in the disease now under consideration.It should be given for a
length of time--three or four minims of Fowler's solution, gradually
increased and {463} given immediately after food--and in cases of
anaemia it should be associated with iron.In irritable, broken-down conditions of the nervous system nux vomica,
or its alkaloid strychnia, is a useful remedy.But it is a powerful
stimulant to the spinal nerve-centre, and care should be used in the
too protracted use of the remedy or in its administration in too large
doses.It may be combined with the phosphate or the valerianate of
zinc, or either may be given separately.The nitrate and oxide of
silver have also been used with asserted success.Nitrate of silver may
be given in pill form with opium.If there is a strong hysterical element, the bromides and
antispasmodics may be tried in connection with remedies calculated to
strengthen the nervous system.The judicious employment in such cases
of hydro-therapeutic measures is of great value.Good results are also
obtained from electricity.Among palliative remedies--_i.e._ remedies that act directly on the
painful gastric nerves--the subnitrate of bismuth has long been
regarded with great favor.Its action is mainly local; it may be given,
therefore, in drachm doses or more three or four times a day.If there
is nothing to contraindicate its use, aconite or dilute hydrocyanic
acid may be given with the bismuth.For the immediate relief of pain, however, there is no substitute for
opium.The subcutaneous injection of morphia will generally give
immediate relief.But there are many reasons why we should try other
palliative remedies.In a disease so painful in character a remedy that
gives such prompt relief is liable to abuse.The formation of the opium
habit should be carefully guarded against.Spirits of chloroform may be
tried, therefore, as a substitute for opium, followed by large draughts
of hot water--hot as the patient can possibly sip it.Hot water of
itself often gives immediate relief.An important part of the treatment consists in well-regulated hygiene.Change of air, travel, pleasant mental surroundings, together with
carefully regulated diet, are in a majority of cases more efficacious
than drugs.Acute Gastritis (Acute Gastric Catarrh).Reasoning from the great functional activity of the stomach, from its
daily periodical change of blood-supply, from its extensive glandular
arrangement, and from its important relations to the functions of
vegetative and animal life, we might readily infer that it would be
frequently the seat of acute and destructive inflammation.But it is
remarkable, all things considered, how seldom that is the case.Indeed,
acute spontaneous inflammation of the stomach is almost unknown.When
it occurs it most frequently results from toxic causes.In less severe
forms, however, not attended with immediate danger to life, it is
undoubtedly a disease of frequent occurrence, and in this more
comprehensive sense the subject will be considered in the present
section.The mucous membrane alone is usually the seat of the disease, and for
this reason it has become the custom of late years to describe it as
gastric {464} catarrh.This may be objectionable, for the reason that
it does not include gastric inflammation of every grade of intensity.The term catarrh is generally applied to much more simple anatomical
structures than those pertaining to the stomach.We shall consider the
subject therefore under two forms--namely, (1) Catarrhal; (2)
Erythematous gastritis.ETIOLOGY.--Certain conditions predispose to the disease.Acute
catarrhal gastritis is specially liable to occur in those who
habitually suffer from a disordered stomach.This may arise from
functional disturbance of the digestive process on the one hand, or
mechanical obstruction on the other.Mechanical causes are widespread
in their influence.Thus, weak heart-action from any cause tends to
disturb the normal adjustment between the two sides of the
circulation--arterial and venous.An abnormal amount of blood
accumulates on the venous side of the circulation, and chronic passive
hyperaemia of the abdominal viscera is the result.The effect of this
upon the stomach is to lower its functional activity and to invite
inflammatory action.The same condition results from structural
diseases of the heart, lungs, or liver.Persons suffering from valvular
diseases of the heart, emphysema of the lungs, or cirrhosis of the
liver are strongly predisposed to diseases of the stomach.Gastric
troubles are also apt to supervene during the progress of various
diseases.Gouty and rheumatic persons are specially prone to suffer from gastric
catarrh; and eruptive disorders, such as scarlatina, diphtheria, etc.,
tend to erythematous forms of gastric inflammation.Catarrhal gastritis
is also a very common sequence of the whole class of malarious fevers,
including yellow fever, intermittents, and remittents.In its more
acute form gastric inflammation supervenes in the course of yellow
fever; and what is observed here in an extreme degree exists in a minor
degree in all the so-called malarious fevers.Intermittent and
remittent fevers are always attended with gastro-duodenitis and
gastro-hepatitis.The degree of this inflammatory complication
determines the continued character of the fever.Upon this point the
writer has very decided views based upon a wide field of observation in
malarious regions of country.We have lost ground in the treatment of
these diseases by directing our attention almost exclusively to the
febrile and malarious, to the exclusion of the inflammatory, elements.Quinia is inoperative in the cure of these troublesome and often fatal
complications.Indeed, it is more than that: it is often positively
injurious.Arrest the local phlegmasia and secure freedom of abdominal
circulation, and we at once get the action of the specific remedy.It
may be going too far to affirm, as did Broussais, that gastritis
sustains a causative relation to all forms of fever, but that
gastro-duodenitis is an important secondary condition in all forms of
malarious fever, complicating and perpetuating the febrile state, there
can be no doubt; and it is equally clear that it constitutes one of the
most dangerous complications.Excessive alimentation, with the
injudicious use of tonics and stimulants, so often resorted to in the
treatment of these fevers in their early stages, only serves to
intensify the local inflammation.Abolish the congestive and
inflammatory element of a remittent, and it at once becomes an
intermittent.Mention has been made of weak heart-action as a factor in catarrhal
{465} gastritis; also mechanical impediments to the return of blood
from the stomach to the heart.The stomach is thereby kept in a
constant state of congestion, the nutrition of the mucous membrane is
less active than in health, and its solvent juices are more sparingly
secreted.Thus in long-continued congestion produced by mitral disease
of the heart Samuel Fenwick found the formation of pepsin impaired.He
made artificial gastric juice from the mucous membrane of three males
dying of heart disease, and he found, on the average, only 2-9 grs.of
albumen were dissolved, whereas the amount digested by the mucous
membrane of persons who had died of other maladies was 4 grains.In the
cases of three females a still smaller amount of solvent power was
displayed.These facts have important bearings upon the question of
alimentation in fevers and the conditions in which there is chronic
congestion on the venous side of the circulation.Long-continued
passive hyperaemia of the stomach from any cause not only impairs its
functional activity, but strongly predisposes to inflammatory
complication.Acute erythematous gastritis is most frequently met with in children.It is a very common form of disease in early life, and the local nature
of the malady is frequently overlooked.Few questions in practical
medicine are more embarrassing to the physician.It has been known and
described as gastric and remittent fever, as continued typhoid, and
even as acute hydrocephalus.Writers and teachers describe and
dogmatize, while practical men hesitate at the bedside.There is little
doubt but in the background of these febrile manifestations in children
there is often an acute erythematous gastritis, which is more
successfully treated by a rigid milk diet, small doses of calomel and
bismuth, mucilaginous drinks, cooling saline laxatives, and sometimes
leeches applied to the epigastrium, than by the heroic doses of quinia
so frequently resorted to.We must not, in this connection, lose sight of the fact, so clearly
pointed out by Broussais, that inflammation of the stomach is often
secondarily repeated in the brain.The whole field of clinical
observation abounds in illustrations of this.How often, for instance,
we can trace the sick headache, the delirium, and even convulsive
movements of the voluntary muscles, to primary gastro-intestinal
irritation!In the play of the sympathies morbid irritative action is
transmitted from the organic to the cerebro-spinal nerves; and of all
portions of the abdominal viscera the stomach and upper portion of the
intestinal track are the most frequent seat of these intense morbid
sympathies.Remedies which cool the stomach and lessen inflammatory
action diminish the excitement of the brain, and vice versa.EXCITING CAUSES.--Among the direct exciting causes of gastric
inflammation--exclusive of acrid or corrosive poisons--the most
frequent in this country is the excessive use of alcohol.It acts most
injuriously when it is but slightly diluted and taken on an empty
stomach.And next to this pernicious habit, in the order of importance,
is the use of large quantities of food--more than the stomach has
capacity to digest, and more than is necessary for the wants of the
system.Excessive alimentation is a prolific source of gastric
inflammation.It generally manifests itself, however, in a chronic or
subacute form.Acute erythematous gastritis, so frequently met with in children, is
{466} often present in scarlatina.It is evidently not catarrhal in
character, for in the earlier stages there is no increased secretion of
mucus and but little injection of the mucous membrane.The changes are
observed in the deeper structures of the stomach, and principally in
the gastric tubules.They are much distended by granular, fatty, and
albuminous matter; and in this respect it is analogous to erythematous
affections of the skin with which it is associated in scarlatina.Finally, acute gastric catarrh may be excited by all causes that weaken
the digestive power either by weakening the gastric juice or by
retarding the movements of the stomach.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--No disease requires more knowledge and caution
in determining post-mortem changes than those of the stomach.In the
first place, it presents in inflammatory conditions markedly different
degrees of intensity, with corresponding differences in anatomical
changes.Its diseases also present many special forms, and changes take
place after death which simulate morbid processes during life.Moreover, intense vascular injections are apt to disappear in the small
superficial vessels after death.This applies to all mucous membranes,
but specially to the mucous membrane of the stomach, which is the seat
of varying amounts of blood in their physiological limits during life.For this reason the observations of Beaumont made upon a living subject
are invested with peculiar interest.It will be remembered that in the
case of Alexis St.Martin the appearances noted were such as belong to
the milder forms of inflammation.Beaumont noticed in this case, after
indiscretions in eating or abuse of ardent spirits, a livid
erythematous redness of the gastric mucous membrane, with, at the same
time, dryness of the mouth, thirst, accelerated pulse, and, at the
height of the injection, an entire absence of gastric secretion.At
other times there was considerable muco-purulent matter, with oozing of
grumous blood, "resembling the discharge from the bowels in cases of
chronic dysentery."The fluid taken out through the fistulous opening
consisted mostly, however, of mucus and muco-pus which showed an
alkaline reaction.He describes also a condition of ecchymosis and
oozing of blood from certain red spots of the gastric mucous membrane,
and when thus limited the constitutional symptoms experienced by the
patient were correspondingly slight.Ecchymoses may be present in large
number, with exudates of false membrane, which Beaumont describes as
aphthous.Brinton also describes a severe form of gastritis which he
terms ulcerative, in which he observed hemorrhagic erosions.In the catarrhal form of gastritis the mucous membrane is covered with
a thick, tenacious, stringy mucus; it is softer than usual, and
generally thickened.It presents at the same time a dead-white
appearance, corresponding to Virchow's cloudy swelling--a condition
analogous to that which is observed in acute Bright's disease.Even
casts of the tubes are sometimes met with.This inflammatory change in the substance of the mucous membrane is
especially observed in the acute erythematous form of gastritis
complicating scarlatina.In the early stage there is no increased
secretion of mucus, and at a more advanced stage the membrane may be
even paler than usual.In cases of acute toxic gastritis intense redness is seen over the
entire {467} surface of the mucous membrane, followed by rapid
exudations and sloughing of portions of the membrane.In all forms of the disease there is a tendency to extension of the
inflammation into the duodenum and small intestines.In the more
chronic forms we almost invariably encounter the condition of
gastro-duodenitis.SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms of inflammation of the stomach present wide
differences in their intensity, depending upon the degree of severity
in different cases.In acute inflammation caused by the direct action
of poisonous irritants they are pronounced and highly diagnostic.The
patient immediately complains of burning pain, referred to the
epigastrium, followed by intense thirst and vomiting.The thirst is apt
to be very great and the act of vomiting painful.The vomited matters
contain mucus, saliva, sometimes bile, and not unfrequently, in fatal
cases, black, grumous, coffee-ground material.There is marked
tenderness on pressure, the pulse is frequent and small, coldness of
the surface is marked, and hiccough is apt to occur.The expression of
the patient is anxious, the abdominal muscles rigid, and, in fatal
cases, the prostration becomes rapidly extreme.These symptoms apply to acute cases of marked severity,
usually of toxic origin.In the milder forms of catarrhal gastritis more frequently met with
there is seldom complaint of pain.The sensation is rather that of
fulness, uneasiness, with more or less tenderness on pressure.The
symptoms are such as belong to acute indigestion and the embarras
gastrique of French authors.The phenomena may be those of a slight
bilious attack.The tongue is foul, the breath offensive, the bowels
confined, and the urine high- and scanty.There is also
generally a sense of fatigue, and soon secondary cerebral symptoms
supervene, such as cerebral hyperaemia, headache, vertigo, noises in
the ears, palpitation, sighing, yawning, dyspnoea, faintness, and in
severe cases marked physical and mental depression.Nausea and vomiting
are common, and if the inflammation extends to the duodenum and liver,
symptoms of gastro-hepatic catarrh manifest themselves.If fever
supervenes, urticaria sometimes complicates these attacks.In young children the inflammation is apt to involve a general catarrh
of the whole intestinal track.Thirst is excessive, followed by
vomiting and diarrhoea.The discharges are liquid, watery, offensive,
acid, and out of all proportion to the amount of fluid absorbed by the
stomach.The pulse becomes weak and fluttering, the skin pale, the
features pinched, the eyes sunken, and the extremities cold.The
tendency is toward rapid collapse and fatal issue.The symptoms
describe what is usually known as cholera infantum.It has its analogue
in the cholera morbus of adults.In erythematous gastritis nausea and vomiting are as general as in the
catarrhal form, but, unlike the catarrhal, pain at the epigastrium is a
prominent symptom.In
phthisical cases the sensation is rather that of rawness of the
oesophagus and stomach.Thirst is a troublesome symptom; the tongue is
red or dry and glazed; tenderness of the epigastrium is marked;
diarrhoea is generally present; and, as in the catarrhal form, the
stools are fetid and unhealthy.The disease shows a marked tendency to
become chronic.{468} DIAGNOSIS.--In the more acute forms of the disease the symptoms
are all highly diagnostic.Vomiting, burning pain of the stomach,
tenderness on pressure, intense thirst, with frequent and small pulse,
point with almost unerring certainty to acute gastric inflammation.But
vomiting of itself, however persistent, is not evidence of gastritis,
for it may be present from many other causes.If the vomiting be
attended by headache, it may be confounded with gastric irritability
from brain disease.Thus, chronic meningitis with persistent vomiting
strongly simulates gastritis, and in the case of children it is liable
to be mistaken for it.In gastritis the nausea is from the first a
pronounced feature of the disease.Vomiting in affections of the brain
is often unattended by nausea.In gastritis the tongue is more
frequently coated or red and glazed.Diarrhoea is also more frequently
present, especially in early life.In affections of the brain the
tongue may be clean and the bowels are usually obstinately confined.When there is much fever, gastritis may be confounded with remittent or
typhoid fever.In periods of childhood this mistake is specially liable
to occur, for there are many symptoms in common.In all such cases the
early history of the case ought to be carefully inquired into.In
gastritis we may be able to detect the cause in any particular case.The gastric symptoms are apt to occur suddenly, and, as already stated,
are prominent from the first.In meningitis the skin is more frequently
dry; in gastric catarrh perspirations are common.The more prominent
and characteristic symptoms of typhoid should also be carefully
excluded, such as the gradual invasion, peculiar eruption, bronchial
catarrh, enlargement of the spleen, gurgling in the right iliac fossae,
with tympanitic abdomen.Peritonitis, with vomiting, may be mistaken
for gastritis, but the diffuse tenderness, the fixedness of position,
the rigidity of the abdominal muscles, and the tympanitic distension
serve to guide us in our diagnosis.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis must have reference to the cause.The more
violent forms of the disease resulting from corrosive poisons are
generally fatal.Death is apt to take place in a few hours from a
condition of collapse.The immediate cause of death is failure of
heart-action.It is also a dangerous disease in the extremes of life.In its acute form in children it is apt to terminate fatally,
especially if it is not recognized early and judiciously treated.The
complications of the disease may also render the prognosis unfavorable.TREATMENT.--The most important indication of treatment, applicable to
all forms of gastric inflammation, is to secure complete or partial
rest for the inflamed organ.In dangerous cases no food should be taken
into the stomach.The patient should be nourished exclusively by
nutrient enemata.If food is permitted, it should be restricted to milk
and lime-water, administered in small quantities at short intervals.In
acute and dangerous cases, suddenly manifesting themselves, the
exciting cause should be carefully inquired into, and speedily removed,
if possible, by an emetic, or, if need be, by the stomach-pump, if the
poison be one which can be ejected; and following this antidotes are to
be administered according to the nature of the poison.To allay the intense thirst small pieces of ice should be swallowed at
frequent intervals, or, what is often more grateful to the patient,
iced {469} effervescing drinks in small doses oft repeated.Injections
of water may also tend to relieve thirst.To allay vomiting the
physician is often tempted to try a great variety of remedies which are
usually worse than useless, for they aggravate rather than relieve the
distressing symptom.For the purpose of quieting the stomach opium is
the most reliable remedy we possess.It is best administered
hypodermically.Fomentations may be applied over the epigastrium.Stimulants are, of course, contraindicated on account of their
irritating action on the inflamed membrane, but in case of rapid
tendency to death by failure of heart-action they should be
administered by the rectum or hypodermically.In milder cases--which are much the more common--physiological rest of
the organ is also a cardinal principle of treatment.In cases of any severity the patient should be
kept quiet in bed.For the condition of acute indigestion known as
embarras gastrique ipecacuanha in six- or eight-grain doses, given
three times within twenty-four hours, will often produce healthy
bilious stools, and in this manner accomplish the cure.One or two
grains of calomel may be added to each dose of ipecacuanha with
benefit.In all forms of catarrhal gastritis, especially if symptoms of
portal congestion are present, mild mercurial cathartics are attended
with benefit.Six or eight grains of calomel may be rubbed up with
sugar of milk and placed dry on the tongue, followed by a cooling
saline aperient.When diarrhoea is present in such cases, it should be
regarded as conservative, and encouraged by the administration of
half-grain or grain doses of calomel, combined with bismuth and
bicarbonate of soda.The diet should be restricted to milk and
lime-water or milk mixed with Vichy or Seltzer water.Demulcent drinks
should be freely given.In the slighter attacks effervescing drinks are
grateful to the patient; and if there be excessive formation of acid in
the stomach, antacids and sedatives should be administered.Bismuth has a peculiar sedative and antiseptic effect in the milder
forms of inflammatory action of mucous membranes.It is especially
valuable in gastro-intestinal troubles of children.Its action is
mainly local surface action, and may therefore be given in liberal
doses if necessary.Children may take from five to ten grains, and
adults twenty grains or more.Hydrocyanic acid adds to its sedative
qualities, or when pain is present, with diarrhoea, opium in some form
may be added.The salicylate of bismuth is specially indicated when we
want to add to the antiseptic qualities of bismuth.The general principles of treatment indicated here are applicable to
the so-called remittent fevers of children--namely, calomel in small
doses, combined with bismuth and bicarbonate of soda, followed by
occasional cool saline laxatives.Ipecacuanha is also a valuable agent
in correcting morbid gastro-intestinal secretions.When there is early
epigastric tenderness, with hot skin and elevation of temperature, two
or three leeches should be applied to the epigastrium, followed by warm
poultices of linseed meal.Dry cupping may also be used with benefit;
and if decided remissions occur, with suspicions of a complicating
malarious element, a few liberal doses of quinia may be tried.In many
such cases, however, it will be found unnecessary, and not unfrequently
hurtful.In acute gastro-intestinal inflammations of children--the
{470} temperature reaching 105 degrees or more--no febrifuge, in the
opinion of the writer, is equal to the cool or cold bath, repeated from
time to time until there is a decided reduction of temperature.But the
gastric inflammation, rather than the fever, should mainly claim our
attention.Great care is necessary during convalescence from acute gastric
disease, particularly as regards the hygienic management.The apparent
debility of the patient too often tempts the physician to the early and
injudicious use of tonics, stimulants, and excessive alimentation,
which, if persisted in, can scarcely fail to perpetuate a chronic form
of inflammatory action.Chronic Gastritis (Chronic Gastric Catarrh).There is perhaps no malady more frequently met with than chronic
gastric catarrh, and none more frequently misunderstood.It comprises
many different forms of gastric derangement, which are grouped under
the general head of inflammatory dyspepsia, with many symptoms strongly
simulating ordinary functional dyspepsia.It includes, in the author's
opinion, a large number of cases of obstinate chronic dyspepsia, which
are badly managed because not recognized as of inflammatory origin.ETIOLOGY.--In a more or less chronic form it is frequently met with as
a result of the acute affections.Hence the etiology is mainly that of
acute gastric catarrh.By mechanical causes which interfere with the portal circulation.In connection with certain constitutional states, such as gout,
rheumatism, phthisis, renal disease, certain eruptive diseases, and as
a sequence of malarious fevers.By the excessive use of alcohol and other gastric irritants.By errors of diet, especially excessive alimentation.By decomposition of ingested aliment owing to deficiency of gastric
juice.By all causes that weaken the digestive power and lower the general
tone of the system.Of all these causes, errors of diet are most apt to produce it, and to
perpetuate it when once established.And next to this, in the order of
importance, is the immoderate use of alcohol, especially by persons
whose general health and digestive power are below a healthy standard.Such persons are apt to suffer from irritative and inflammatory forms
of dyspepsia, which, in various degrees of intensity, alternate with
the acuter forms of embarras gastrique.The injudicious use of drugs may also be mentioned.There can be no
doubt that many transient and functional forms of indigestion merge
into the more chronic inflammatory forms of dyspepsia from the abuse of
stimulants, tonics, and purgatives.Anxious for relief, and urged on by
hope of recovery, the victims of functional dyspepsia are apt to have
recourse to every grade of quacks and to be subjected to every form of
harassing and mischievous treatment.Indeed, the use of potential and
irritating drugs, administered for all kinds of ailments, real or
imaginary, enters largely into the etiology of chronic gastric catarrh.These are mainly
{471} such as offer impediment to the return of blood from the stomach
to the heart.In acute cases the congestion may be very intense.Congestion of the same kind, but more gradual in its occurrence and
less in degree, may be present from all conditions affecting the
circulation of venous blood through the liver.General anaemia, by
producing weak heart-action, disturbs the normal adjustment between the
arterial and venous sides of the circulation.Blood accumulates in the
veins and capillaries, and morbid action propagates itself in a
direction contrary to the circulation.Hence in all conditions of
general anaemia there is tendency to dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema,
bronchorrhoea, special forms of liver disease, gastric catarrh, and
even temporary albuminuria.All mechanical obstructions to the free
transit of blood through the heart, lungs, or liver are followed by the
same results.A free secretion of mucus into the stomach is one of the
most commonly recognized.This
alkaline mucus, while it dilutes the digestive juices of the stomach,
furnishes favorable conditions for the development of low
micro-organisms, which contribute to the fermentative process.We may
not duly estimate the effects of these organisms on a mucous membrane
softened by long-continued passive hyperaemia.Malarious fevers, from their congestive tendency, give rise to the more
acute forms of gastro-enteric inflammation.In the more chronic forms
of intermittent and remittent fevers more or less gastric inflammation
is invariably present.Indeed, in all forms of fever gastric
inflammation is a complicating element, and the recognition of the fact
has an important bearing on the treatment.Certain constitutional diseases appear to involve special liability to
this affection, such as scrofula, phthisis, gout, rheumatism, syphilis,
and many chronic forms of skin disease; and in many cases the cause is
not apparent.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--The gross appearance of the stomach in chronic
gastritis is thus admirably described by Broussais, who faithfully
recorded what he "observed during many years in the bodies of those who
have long suffered from distaste for food, nausea, and vomiting."These
observations were made long before morbid anatomy had thrown much light
on the more minute structural changes of organs, and the general
picture will be recognized as faithful to-day: "Softening, friability,
and the reduction into a kind of gelatinous mass commonly occurs in the
region of the lower part of the larger curvature of the stomach; and
when closely examined it is perceived that it is not only the mucous
membrane that has undergone that species of decomposition, but that the
muscular has participated in it, and that the whole of the cellular
tissue which united the three membranes has entirely disappeared.The
parietes of the viscus are then reduced to a very thin lamina of serous
membrane, commonly so fragile as to tear on the slightest handling, or
even already perforated without any effort on the part of the
anatomist.The pyloric region, on the contrary, has manifestly acquired
more consistence and thickness; the mucous membrane there presents
large folds, the muscular appears more developed, and the cellular and
vascular are injected; sometimes even a true scirrhous state is
observed there.The portion of the mucous membrane which covers this
scirrhus is sometimes {472} ulcerated, but that in the surrounding
parts and at the border of the ulcer, far from being softened, is, on
the contrary, tumefied, indurated, and injected.Finally, though there
may or may not be ulceration of the pylorus, it is always manifestly
hypertrophied, whilst the lower part of the great curvature is the seat
of softening and atrophy."These were the observations of the great anatomist apparent to the
naked eye.At the present time we can only confirm them by stating that
structural changes are particularly noticed in the pyloric region of
the stomach.The mucous membrane generally is vascular and covered with
a grayish, tough, transparent mucus.It is more opaque and thicker than
natural.The surface is usually changed in color: it may be red, brown,
ash-gray, slate-, or even black in spots.The darkened spots are
due to pigmented matter, and this is generally most marked in the
pyloric half of the stomach.It is most commonly met with in cases of
prolonged passive congestion of the stomach from portal obstruction,
and requires for its production the rupture of capillaries in the
superficial layers of the membrane and the transformation of the
haematin into pigment.The same condition often produces ecchymoses and
hemorrhagic erosions in spots.In other cases the mucous membrane is
strikingly uneven, being studded with numerous little prominences
separated from each other by shallow depressions or furrows.This
condition, which has been compared to granulations upon wounds, is
called mammillation.It is the etat mamelonne of Louis, and is
considered by him as a sure and constant sign of inflammatory action.Like many other structural changes, it is usually found in the
neighborhood of the pylorus.More rarely polypoid growths project from
the membrane, and little cysts also frequently appear in the mucous
membrane.Chronic inflammation tends to thickening of the mucous membrane.It
sometimes is not only greatly thickened, but acquires an extreme degree
of toughness.Exceptionally, however, the membrane, either entire or in
spots, may be abnormally thin.The thickening of the walls of the
stomach, when it involves the pylorus, gives rise to constriction of
the orifice and consequent dilatation of the stomach.When the disease has been of long standing the interstitial tissue
between the tubules becomes thickened, the stomach is changed in its
normal structure, and the tubules themselves become confused,
compressed, and much less straight and parallel than in the normal
state.Or they may in some cases be enlarged, according to Flint, in
consequence of swelling and parenchymatous or fatty degeneration of
their epithelial cells.Microscopic examination often shows changes
such as occur in other glandular organs.The glands and tubules become
the seat of degenerative changes, such as are observed in Bright's
disease of the kidney, and they are frequently found associated in the
same case.The mouths of the gastric tubules become blocked up, while
deeper parts are dilated into cysts; and at times they are atrophied or
filled with granular fatty matter.Many cases of persistent anaemia may be traced, according to Flint, to
this degenerative process of the gastric tubules.The SYMPTOMS of chronic gastritis are mainly those of difficult
digestion of an aggravated kind, and are liable to be mistaken for
those of {473} ordinary functional dyspepsia.Some points of
distinction were referred to in the section treating of functional
dyspepsia; and while there are many symptoms in common, it is vastly
important that the two forms of the disease should be early recognized,
for they are radically distinct in their pathology and treatment.We now speak of what is usually known as inflammatory, irritative, or
gastric dyspepsia--a persistent and aggravated form of indigestion
which has its origin in the stomach itself, in contradistinction to
dyspepsia which originates largely from causes outside of the stomach
and transmitted to it through nervous impression.The one is functional
and indirect; the other is inflammatory and direct.The symptoms referable directly to the stomach are mainly those of
difficult and painful digestion, and are alike characteristic of all
forms of indigestion, such as loss of appetite, sense of weight and
fulness of the epigastrium, distress after taking food, acidity,
eructations of gas, etc.But chronic gastritis is more frequently
accompanied by a burning sensation in the epigastric region,
accompanied by tenderness on pressure, which is generally increased
after meals.Sometimes this tenderness amounts to actual pain, which is
increased after meals.But we are liable to be misled by pain: gastric
pain is not a characteristic symptom; subacute forms of the disease may
exist without any fixed pain; the sensation is rather that of burning,
uneasiness, and oppression of the epigastric region.The appetite, as a
rule, is greatly impaired--indeed, the sense of hunger is rarely
experienced--and nausea and vomiting frequently follow the ingestion of
food.This is especially the case when catarrh of the stomach is
associated with renal disease, portal congestion, or chronic
alcoholism.Large quantities of mucus are brought up, the vomiting
taking place usually in the morning, and on examination of the mucus it
will frequently be found to contain sarcinae and large numbers of
bacterial organisms.When stricture of the pylorus is present the
vomiting of putrid, half-digested food usually takes place about the
termination of the digestive process.The tongue presents characteristics peculiar to chronic inflammation of
the stomach.In some cases it is small and red, with enlarged and red
papillae; in others, it is broad and flabby and somewhat pale; but in
either case, on close inspection, the papillae will be found red and
enlarged, this being more apparent on the tip and edges.In children of
scrofulous habits and in older persons of tubercular tendency the whole
organ is redder than natural, the papillae standing out as vivid red
spots.In other cases the catarrh of the stomach extends to the mucous
membrane of the mouth.In all cases of oral catarrh the tongue, instead
of being red and pointed, is large and apparently oedematous.It is
uniformly covered with a white or dirty brownish coat, and frequently
shows the impression of the teeth upon its edges.The secretions of the
mouth are depraved, the breath heavy and offensive, and the gums spongy
and unhealthy in appearance.It is rarely absent either in the acute or
chronic form of the disease.It is most marked in the intervals between
meals and in the evenings.It is rare in gastric catarrh of long standing that it does not extend
to the intestines, and occasionally from the duodenum to the ductus
{474} choledochus; in which case we have the combined symptoms of
gastro-intestinal catarrh associated with jaundice.The nutritive
system becomes implicated, and patients are especially prone to develop
any diathesis to which they may be liable.There remains a group of symptoms of great interest in the study of
gastric inflammation--important because liable to mislead as to the
real nature of the difficulty--namely, morbid conditions of the nervous
system.Few diseases have such a wide range of morbid sympathies, and
few, it may be added, are so generally misunderstood and
misinterpreted.Two main facts, as formulated by Broussais, deserve to
be restudied by the profession:

First, that irritations of the visceral parenchyma which do not
implicate their serous membranes only give rise to ill-defined
sensations, and they not painful;

Second, that most of the acute pains arising from visceral irritation
are rather referred to external parts than to the viscera themselves.Unless the seat of very acute inflammation, mucous membranes are
remarkably free from pain, and yet the gastric mucous membrane is the
seat of a most exquisite internal visceral sense and has a wide range
of morbid sympathetic disturbances.These sympathetic phenomena are
often treated for primary neuralgias.No fact in the clinical study of
disease deserves more careful consideration than this.Absence of pain,
then, is calculated to mislead.It is often only the sensation of
uneasiness, depression and melancholy, want of appetite, thirst,
nausea, loathing of food, and derangement of the bilious and gastric
secretions, that directs our attention to the stomach.Moreover, in
gastro-enteric inflammations pain is more frequently felt in parts
sympathetically affected than in the stomach itself."It is only when
irritations of mucous membranes are in the vicinity of the openings of
cavities that the irritations are distinctly perceptible in the seat
they occupy" (Broussais).Morbid irritative action commencing in the
stomach repeats itself in the cerebro-spinal system of nerves, and the
secondary irritation may develop a more immediately dangerous
inflammation than the primary.This is frequently observed in children,
who are specially prone to irritation of the visceral apparatus.Many
cases of primary gastric irritation terminate in acute cerebral
inflammation.Indeed, the greater number of phlegmasiae of the brain
are only sympathetic irritations issuing from primary inflammation of
the stomach.Short of inflammation, the transmitted irritation may
merely give rise to reflex convulsions, and in adults to sick headache,
or, if long continued, to conditions of hypochondria.Headache is a
prominent symptom of gastric irritation.It is not usually acute, but
rather a sense of fulness and pressure, sometimes felt in the frontal,
at other times in the occipital, region.Many cases commonly called
cerebral hyperaemia and cerebral anaemia are nothing more than
malassimilation from chronic gastric catarrh.This fact deserves to be
specially emphasized at present, for we are apt to consider the
cerebral the primary lesion.Vertigo, as in functional dyspepsia, is
also an occasional symptom, and very commonly patients complain of
extreme degrees of sleeplessness and disturbed dreams and nightmare.The heart's action is often disturbed in its rhythm, and sympathetic
dyspnoea leads to suspicion of disease of the lungs.And to all these
{475} nervous phenomena may be added unusual languor, lassitude,
irritability of temper, and a feeling of inability for either mental or
physical exertion.But in the play of morbid sympathies it must be borne in mind that the
stomach may be secondarily affected.Irritations of all organs are
constantly transmitted to the stomach from their very commencement.Hence the frequent loss of appetite, the thirst, the embarrassed
digestion, the deranged gastric secretion, and the altered color of the
tongue.This is markedly the case in all the malarious and essential
forms of fever.Gastric complication in these fevers is rarely, if
ever, absent, and if aggravated by the too early use of tonics and
stimulants and by harsh irritating cathartics, it becomes too often a
fatal complication.Gastric symptoms are also associated with other constitutional
disorders, such as phthisis, renal disease, rheumatism, gout, and
almost all forms of chronic eruptive diseases.Constipation is often obstinate,
and especially is this the case if the catarrhal condition is confined
to the duodenum.The lower down the inflammation the greater the
probability of diarrhoea, and when present the stools are offensive and
frothy; sometimes they are dry and scybalous and coated with a tough,
tenacious mucus which may form casts of portions of the intestinal
track.In other cases patients suffer from distressing intestinal
flatulence and a sense of general discomfort.Piles is a complication
frequently present without reference to complication of the liver.The urine is more frequently disordered than in any other form of
disturbance of digestion.The most common changes consist in an
abundant deposit of the urates; exceptionally, however--especially in
cases of long standing in which there are marked nervous symptoms
associated with defective secretion of the liver and pancreas--it may
be of low specific gravity and pale in color from the presence of
phosphates.Slight febrile movement is not uncommon.Finally, in all cases of chronic gastric catarrh the nutritive system
becomes deeply implicated--much more so than in functional disturbances
of the stomach.Emaciation is almost constantly present, the patient
often showing signs of premature decay.DIAGNOSIS.--The disease with which chronic gastritis is most liable to
be confounded is atonic dyspepsia, the chief points of distinction from
which have been already alluded to.In general terms it may be said
that in chronic gastritis there is more epigastric tenderness, more
burning sensation and feeling of heat in the stomach, more thirst, more
nausea, more persistent loss of appetite, more steady and progressive
loss of flesh, more acidity, more eructations of gas, more general
appearance of premature decay, and greater tendency to hypochondriasis.And yet all these symptoms, in varying degrees of prominence, may be
present in all forms of indigestion.To the points of distinction
already mentioned, then, a few circumstances may be added which will
afford considerable assistance in coming to a correct diagnosis:

1.The length of time the disease has uninterruptedly lasted.The local symptoms are never entirely absent, as is not infrequently
the case in functional dyspepsia.The uneasy sensations, nausea, oppression, or pain, as the
case may be, follow the ingestion of food.They are not so prominently
present when the stomach is empty.In chronic gastritis it will be found that
all the local symptoms are exasperated by the usual treatment of
functional dyspepsia.Stimulants and stimulating food are not well borne.Alcohol,
especially on an empty stomach, produces gastric distress.There is
also frequently slight febrile disturbance.Chronic gastritis, with nausea, vomiting, haematemesis, general pallor,
and loss of flesh, may be mistaken for cancer of the stomach.But in
cancer vomiting is about as apt to take place when the stomach is empty
as during the ingestion of food; pain is usually greater, especially
when the orifices of the stomach are involved; the tenderness is more
marked; the emaciation and pallor more steadily progressive; the
vomiting of coffee-ground material takes place more frequently; and the
disease is more rapid in its progress.The age and sex of the patient
may also aid us in our diagnosis.Cancer is more frequently a disease
of middle and advanced life, and localizes itself oftener in the
stomach of males than females.Finally, the discovery of a tumor would
remove all doubts.Haematemesis in chronic catarrh of the stomach is
almost invariably associated with obstruction to venous circulation in
the liver, heart, or lungs.In rare cases it may be difficult to distinguish chronic gastric
catarrh from ulcer of the stomach.In ulcer of the stomach pain is a
more prominent and constant symptom; it is more centrally located; the
vomiting after taking food is more immediate and persistent; the tongue
may be clean; flatulence is not a constant symptom; the appetite is
seldom much affected; the bowels are generally confined; and there is
nothing characteristic about the urine.TREATMENT.--In this, as in the more acute forms of the disease, rest of
the stomach is important.From mistaken notions of disease we are prone
to over-feed our patients, and thus seriously impair the digestive and
assimilative processes.In chronic inflammation of the stomach a
restricted diet is of prime importance.The physician should most
carefully select the patient's food, and urgently insist on its
exclusive use.This of itself, if faithfully persevered in, will often
effect a cure.The exclusive use of a milk diet--especially skim-milk--should be
thoroughly tested.In testing it we should allow two or three weeks to
elapse before any other food is taken.At the end of that time
soft-boiled eggs, stale bread, and well-cooked rice may be added, with
an occasional chop once a day.Some patients do not tolerate raw milk
well.In such cases we should thoroughly test the peptonized or
pancreatized milk or the peptonized milk-gruel, as suggested by
Roberts.This artificially-digested milk agrees wonderfully well with
many stomachs that cannot digest plain milk.Milk, in whatever form
administered, should be given at comparatively short intervals of time,
and never in quantity beyond the digestive capacity.Better err on the
side of under- than over-feeding.Nothing should be left to the fancy
or caprice of the patient.The food should be carefully selected by the
medical adviser, and given in definite quantities at definite times.Even the moral {477} effect of such discipline is healthful for the
patient.After testing milk diet for a time, we may gradually add small
quantities of rare and thoroughly minced meat.Milk, eggs, and rare
meat are more easily digested, as a rule, than starchy substances.Farinaceous food is apt to give rise to excessive acidity.But stale
bread may be added to the milk, and, if there is tendency to acidity,
better have it toasted thoroughly brown.In addition to the dietetic treatment of the disease, diluents,
timeously administered, are of essential service.As a rule, patients
are too much restricted from their use, under the supposition that they
dilute the gastric juice and thereby impair the digestive power.This
restriction is proper at, and for some time after, the ingestion of
food.But at the end of the first hour after taking food several ounces
of gum-water, or some mucilaginous fluid sweetened and rendered
palatable by a few drops of dilute muriatic acid, should be
administered, and repeated every hour during the digestive process.Diluents, thus administered, are not only grateful in allaying the
thirst of the patient, but are at the same time an essential part of
the treatment.The free use of demulcents at the termination of
digestion in the stomach is especially useful.Beyond these general principles of treatment, applicable to all
varieties of gastric catarrh, we must have reference to the varied
etiology of the disease.This, we have seen, is most complicated.Hence
the difficulty in prescribing any rules of treatment applicable to all
cases.We should seek here, as in all cases, to generalize the disease
and individualize our patient.Chief among remedial agents may be mentioned the alkaline carbonates.When combined with purgative salines they are specially valuable in
gastro-duodenal catarrhs associated with disease of the liver.These
are a very numerous class of cases, especially in malarious regions of
country, and when present in a chronic form lay the foundation of
widespread disorders of nutrition.No treatment in such cases is
effective until we diminish engorgements of the liver and spleen, and
nothing accomplishes this so well as the use of alkaline saline
laxatives.These may be assisted in their action by small doses of
mercurials.It was a cardinal principle among the older practitioners,
in the absence of more minute means of diagnosis, to look well to the
secretions; and what was their strength is, I fear, our weakness.Wonderful results often follow a course of the Carlsbad, Pullna, or
Marienbad waters, taken on an empty stomach, fasting, in the morning.While taking the waters a rigid and restricted diet is enforced.This
is an important part of the treatment.And the fact that so many varied
ailments are cured by a course of these mineral waters with enforced
dietetic regulations only shows the prevalence of gastro-duodenal
catarrhs and their relation to a great variety of human ailments.To a
certain extent the potassio-tartrate of sodium and other saline
laxatives may take the place of these waters if perseveringly used and
taken in the same way.In feebler subjects minute doses of strychnia or
some of the simple vegetable bitters may be used in conjunction with
the laxative salines.In chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastric mucous membrane,
which frequently follow acute attacks, the protracted use of hot water
is often followed by excellent results.There can be no doubt of the
value {478} of hot water in subacute inflammation of mucous membranes
in any locality; and it is specially valuable in gastro-intestinal
catarrh associated with lithaemia.Hot water, laxative salines,
combined with restricted diet and healthful regimen, accomplish much in
correcting morbid conditions of primary assimilation; and by
accomplishing this many secondary ailments promptly disappear.A pint
of water, hot as the patient can drink it, should be taken on an empty
stomach on first rising in the morning, and it may be repeated again an
hour before each meal and at bedtime.A few grains of the bicarbonate
of sodium and a little table-salt may be added.In some cases three or
four drops of tincture of nux vomica or some of the simple bitters may
be taken at the same time with benefit.Alkaline bitters are natural to
the upper portion of the digestive track.No food should be taken for a
half hour or an hour after the hot water.This treatment, to be
effective, must be persevered in for a length of time.A most rigid
system of dietetics suited to individual cases should be enforced at
the same time.In irritable and morbidly sensitive conditions of the mucous membrane
the sedative plan of treatment is not unfrequently followed by good
results; and of remedies belonging to this class bismuth is the most
effective.It is specially indicated in the more irritable forms of
gastric disturbance in which there is a sense of uneasiness and pain at
the epigastrium after taking food.If there is much acidity present, it
may be combined with magnesia or a few grains of finely-pulverized
animal charcoal.Chronic cases of long-continued inflammatory action, with intestinal
complication, are often much benefited by the use of mercurials in
small doses.The one-fifth of a grain of calomel, combined with bismuth
or the bicarbonate of sodium, may be given for weeks without danger of
salivation.In small
doses calomel is undoubtedly sedative to the mucous membrane of the
upper portion of the digestive track.In cases of long standing that
have resisted other modes of treatment the more direct astringents have
been found of great value.Of these, nitrate of silver is to be
preferred, alike for its sedative, astringent, and alterative
properties.It may be given in pill form in from one-quarter to
one-grain doses, combined with opium, a half hour before each meal.The
writer of this article can speak from much experience of the value of
this drug.It proves in many cases a valuable addition to the hot-water
and dietetic course already alluded to.If large quantities of mucus are vomited from time to time, especially
in the morning, we may resort with benefit to the use of other
astringents, such as bismuth, oxalate of cerium, kino, and opium; and
if we have reason to suspect stricture of the pylorus in connection
with a catarrhal condition of the mucous membrane, the stomach-pump
gives the patient great relief.It should be used about three hours
after a meal, injecting tepid water, and then reversing the syringe
until the water comes out perfectly clear.Niemeyer speaks highly of it
in such cases.He says: "Even the first application of the pump
generally gives the patients such relief that, so far from dreading a
repetition of this by no means pleasant operation, they clamorously beg
for it."The gastric catarrh of phthisis is difficult to relieve.Artificial
digestives may be tried, with dilute muriatic acid, as already
indicated; and {479} for the relief of pain and irritation there is no
remedy so efficacious as hydrocyanic acid, which may be combined with
bismuth and opium in case there is diarrhoea.Hot water may be also
tried, with restricted animal food.Habitual constipation must be overcome by suitable laxatives and by
enemata.Castor oil is mild and efficient in these cases, or in cases
of unusual torpor of the muscular coat of the bowels small doses of
aloes and strychnia may be tried.The free use of diluents toward the
close of digestion favors free action of the bowels.All harsh and
irritating cathartics are to be carefully avoided.When there is much tenderness of the epigastrium, benefit may be
derived from counter-irritation, and nothing is so effectual as the
repeated application of small blisters.General hygienic measures are in all cases to be insisted upon.In
morbid conditions of the liver and the upper portion of the digestive
track the free supply of oxygen to the lungs is a remedy of much power.Hence patients should live as much as possible in the open air.They
should be warmly clad, and, if not too feeble, frequent cold baths
should be resorted to.After local irritation has been subdued by appropriate treatment,
tonics may be tried to counteract the enfeebled state of the stomach.They are such as are appropriate for functional diseases of the
stomach.But they should be used with caution and judgment in irritable
and inflammatory forms of dyspepsia.If we attempt to force an appetite
by their use, and to crowd upon the stomach more food than it has
capacity to digest, we may intensify the trouble and thereby add to the
patient's general debility.Food and tonics fail to impart strength
because the stomach is not in a condition to digest them.One thing should be mentioned, in conclusion, as an important item in
the treatment--namely, patience.Chronic gastric catarrh, it should be
remembered, is essentially a chronic disease, and time becomes an
important element in its cure.{480}

SIMPLE ULCER OF THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.DEFINITION.--Simple ulcer of the stomach is usually round or oval.When
of recent formation it has smooth, clean-cut, or rounded borders,
without evidence of acute inflammation in its floor or in its borders.When of long duration it usually has thickened and indurated margins.The formation of the ulcer is usually attributed, in part at least, to
a disturbance in nutrition and to a subsequent solution by the gastric
juice of a circumscribed part of the wall of the stomach.The ulcer may
be latent in its course, but it is generally characterized by one or
more of the following symptoms: pain, vomiting, dyspepsia, hemorrhage
from the stomach, and loss of flesh and strength.It ends frequently in
recovery, but it may end in death by perforation of the stomach, by
hemorrhage, or by gradual exhaustion.SYNONYMS.--The following epithets have been employed to designate this
form of ulcer: simple, chronic, round, perforating, corrosive,
digestive, peptic; ulcus ventriculi simplex, s. chronicum, s. rotundum,
s. perforans, s. corrosivum, s. ex digestione, s. pepticum.HISTORY.--It is only since the description of gastric ulcer by
Cruveilhier in the year 1830 that especial attention has been paid to
this disease.In the writings of the ancients only vague and doubtful references to
ulcer of the stomach are found (Galen, Celsus).It is probable that
cases of this disease were described under such names as passio
cardiaca, gastrodynia, haematemesis, and melaena.After the revival of medicine in the sixteenth century, as post-mortem
examination of human bodies was made with greater frequency, the
existence of ulcers and of cicatrices in the stomach could not escape
attention.But only isolated and curious observations of gastric ulcer
are recorded up to near the end of the eighteenth century.One of the
earliest recorded unmistakable cases of perforating ulcer was observed
by John Bauhin, and is described in the _Sepulchretum_ of Bonetus,
published in 1679.Other cases belonging to this period were described
by Donatus, Courtial, Littre, Schenck, and Margagni.[1]

[Footnote 1: References to these and to other cases may be found in
Lebert's _Krankheiten des Magens_, Tubingen, 1878, p.180 _et seq._]

To Matthew Baillie unquestionably belongs the credit of having first
accurately described, in 1793, the anatomical peculiarities of simple
gastric ulcer.[2] At a later date he published three good engravings of
{481} this disease.[3] Baillie's concise and admirable description of
the morbid anatomy of gastric ulcer was unaccompanied by clinical data,
and seems to have had little or no influence in directing increased
attention to this disease.[Footnote 2: _The Morbid Anatomy of Some of the Most Important Parts of
the Human Body_, London, 1793, p.[Footnote 3: _A Series of Engravings, accompanied with Explanations,
etc._, London, 1799.]A valuable account of the symptoms of gastric ulcer was given by John
Abercrombie in 1824.[4] Nearly all of the symptoms now recognized as
belonging to this affection may be found in his article.He knew the
latent causes of the disease, the great diversity of symptoms in
different cases, and the modes of death by hemorrhage, by perforation,
and by asthenia.He regarded ulcer simply as a localized chronic
inflammation of the stomach, and did not distinguish carefully between
simple and cancerous ulceration.[Footnote 4: "Contributions to the Pathology of the Stomach, the
Pancreas, and the Spleen," _Edinburgh Med.See also, by the same author, _Pathological and
Practical Researches on Diseases of the Stomach, etc._--an excellent
work which passed through several editions.]Cruveilhier,[5] in the first volume of his great work on _Pathological
Anatomy_, published between the years 1829 and 1835, for the first time
clearly distinguished ulcer of the stomach from cancer of the stomach
and from ordinary gastritis.He gave an authoritative and full
description of gastric ulcer from the anatomical, the clinical, and the
therapeutical points of view.[Footnote 5: J. Cruveilhier, _Anatomie pathologique du Corps humain_,
tome i., Paris, 1829-35, livr.; and tome ii., Paris,
1835-42, livr.Next to Cruveilhier, Rokitansky has had the greatest influence upon the
modern conception of gastric ulcer.In 1839 this pathologist gave a
description of the disease based upon an analysis of 79 cases.[6] The
anatomical part of his description has served as the model for all
subsequent writers upon this subject.[Footnote 6: Rokitansky, _Oesterreich.Jahrb._, 1839, Bd.(abstract in _Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.Since the ushering in by Cruveilhier and by Rokitansky of the modern
era in the history of gastric ulcer, medical literature abounds in
articles upon this disease.But it cannot be said that the importance
of these works is at all commensurate with their number or that they
have added very materially to the classical descriptions given by
Cruveilhier and by Rokitansky.Perhaps most worthy of mention of the
works of this later era are the article by Jaksch relating to
symptomatology and diagnosis, that of Virchow pertaining to etiology,
the statistical analyses by Brinton, and the contributions to the
treatment of the disease by Ziemssen and by Leube.[7] In 1860, Ludwig
Muller published an extensive monograph upon gastric ulcer.[8]

frequency of simple gastric ulcer.The method usually adopted is to
observe the number of cases in which open ulcers and cicatrices are
found {482} in the stomach in a large number of autopsies.But this
method is open to two objections.The first objection is, that scars in
the stomach, particularly if they are small, are liable to be
overlooked or not to be noted in the record of the autopsy unless
special attention is directed to their search.The second objection is,
that it is not proven that all of the cicatrices found in the stomach
are the scars of healed simple ulcers, and that, in fact, it is
probable that many are not.In consequence of these defects (and others
might be mentioned) this method is of very limited value, although it
is perhaps the best which we have at our disposal.In 32,052 autopsies made in Prague, Berlin, Dresden, Erlangen, and
Kiel,[9] there were found 1522 cases of open ulcer or of cicatrix in
the stomach.If all the scars be reckoned as healed ulcers, according
to these statistics gastric ulcer, either cicatrized or open, is found
in about 5 per cent.[Footnote 9: The Prague statistics embrace 11,888 autopsies, compiled
from the following sources: 1, Jaksch, _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.; 2, Dittrich, _ibid._, vols.vii., viii., ix., x., xii., xiv.; 3,
Willigk, _ibid._, vol.; 4, Eppinger, _ibid._, vol.The Berlin statistics are to be found in dissertations by Plange
(abstract in _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.), by Steiner, and by
Wollmann (abstracts in _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1868), and
by Berthold (1883).The Dresden statistics are in a dissertation by Stachelhausen
(Wurzburg, 1874), referred to by Birch-Hirschfeld, _Lehrb.837, Leipzig, 1877.The Erlangen statistics are reported by Ziemssen in _Volkmann's Samml.The Kiel report is in an inaugural dissertation by Greiss (Kiel, 1879),
referred to in the _Deutsche med.So far as possible, duodenal ulcers have been excluded.Only those
reports have been admitted which include both open ulcers and
cicatrices.]It is important to note the relative frequency of open ulcers as
compared with that of cicatrices.In 11,888 bodies examined in Prague,
there were found 164, or 1.4 per cent., with open ulcers, and 373, or
3.1 per cent., with cicatrices.Here scars were found about two and
one-fourth times as frequently as open ulcers.The observations of
Grunfeld in Copenhagen show that when especial attention is given to
searching for cicatrices in the stomach, they are found much more
frequently than the figures here given would indicate.[10] It would be
a moderate estimate to place the ratio of cicatrices to open ulcers at
3 to 1.[Footnote 10: Grunfeld (abstract in _Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.141, 1883) in 1150 autopsies found 124 cicatrices in the stomach, or 11
per cent., but in only 450 of these cases was his attention especially
directed to their search, and in these he found 92 cases, or 20 per
cent., with scars.Grunfeld's statistics relate only to persons over
fifty years of age.Gastric ulcer, moreover, is extraordinarily common
in Copenhagen.The inexact nature of the ordinary statistics relating to cicatrices is
also evident from the fact that in the four collections of cases which
comprise the Prague statistics the percentage of open ulcers varies
only between 0.81 and 2.44, while the percentage of cicatrices varies
between 0.89 and 5.42.]The statistics concerning the average frequency of open ulcers are much
more exact and trustworthy than those relating to cicatrices.It may be
considered reasonably certain that, at least in Europe, open gastric
ulcers are found on the average in from 1 to 2 per cent.[11]

[Footnote 11: If in this estimate were included infants dying during
the first days of life, the percentage would be much smaller.]It is manifestly impossible to form an accurate estimate of the
frequency of gastric ulcer from the number of cases diagnosed as such
{483} during life, because the diagnosis is in many cases uncertain.Nevertheless, estimates upon this basis have practical clinical value.In 41,688 cases constituting the clinical material of Lebert[12] in
Zurich and in Breslau between the years 1853 and 1873, the diagnosis of
gastric ulcer was made in 252 cases, or about 2/3 per cent.[Footnote 12: Lebert, _op.Of 1699 cases of gastric ulcer collected from various hospital
statistics[13] and examined post-mortem, 692, or 40 per cent., were in
males, and 1007, or 60 per cent., were in females.The result of this
analysis makes the ratio 2 males to 3 females.[Footnote 13: These statistics include the previously-cited Prague,
Berlin, Dresden, and Erlangen cases so far as the sex is given, and in
addition the returns of Rokitansky, _op.cit._; Starcke (Jena),
_Deutsche Klinik_, 1870, Nos.26-29; Lebert, _op.cit._; Chambers,
_London Journ.of Med._, July, 1852; Habershon, _Dis.of the Abdomen_,
3d ed.Soc._, 1880; and the Munich
Hospital, _Annalen d. stadt.Only series of cases from the post-examinations of a number of years
have been admitted.It is an error to include isolated cases from
journals, as Brinton has done, because an undue number of these are
cases of perforation, which is a more common event in females than in
males.Thus, of 43 cases of gastric ulcer presented to the London
Pathological Society since its foundation up to 1882, 19, or 44 per
cent., were cases of perforation.In my cases are included a few
duodenal ulcers not easily separated from the gastric ulcers in the
compilation.]In order to determine from post-mortem records the age at which gastric
ulcer most frequently occurs, all cases in which only cicatrices are
found should be excluded, because a cicatrix gives no evidence as to
the age at which the ulcer existed.The following table gives the age in 607 cases of open ulcer collected
from hospital statistics[14] (post-mortem material):

    Age.----------+---------------+--------
   1-10.|        1      |
  10-20.|       32      |   33

  Over 100.|        1      |    7
  ----------+---------------+--------

From this table it is apparent that three-fourths of the cases are
found between the ages of twenty and sixty, and that the cases are
distributed with tolerable uniformity between these four decades.The
largest number of cases is found between twenty and thirty.The
frequency of gastric ulcer after sixty years diminishes, although it
remains quite considerable, especially in view of the comparatively
small number of those living after that period.[Footnote 14: The sources of these statistics are the same as those of
the statistics relating to sex in the preceding foot-note.The age in
the Erlangen cases of open ulcer is given by Hauser (_Das chronische
Magengeschwur_, p.It is evident that only about
two-fifths of the cases could be utilized, partly because in some the
age was not stated, but mainly on account of the necessity of excluding
scars--a self-evident precaution which Brinton did not take.]The probability that many cases of ulcer included in the above table
existed for several years before death makes it desirable that
estimates as to the occurrence of the disease at different ages should
be made also from cases carefully diagnosed during life, although the
diagnosis must necessarily be less certain than that in the post-mortem
records.The best {484} statistics of this character which we possess
are those of Lebert, from whose work the following table has been
compiled:

Lebert_.----------+---------------+---------+----------

  ----------+---------------+---------+----------

Of these cases, nearly seven-tenths were between twenty and forty years
of age--a preponderance sufficiently great to be of diagnostic
value.[16]

[Footnote 15: _Op.Of these cases, 19 were fatal, and
the diagnosis was confirmed after death.All of the cases were studied
by Lebert in hospitals in Zurich and Breslau.][Footnote 16: In my opinion, clinical experience is more valuable than
are post-mortem records in determining the age at which gastric ulcer
most frequently develops.In support of this opinion are the following
facts: In many cases no positive conclusions as to the age of the ulcer
can be drawn from the post-mortem appearances, and sufficient clinical
history is often wanting; a considerable proportion of the cases of
gastric ulcer do not terminate fatally with the first attack, but are
subject to relapses which may prove fatal in advanced life; in most
general hospitals the number of patients in advanced life is relatively
in excess of those in youth and middle age.By his faulty method of
investigating this question, Brinton came to the erroneous conclusion
that the liability to gastric ulcer is greatest in old age--a
conclusion which is opposed to clinical experience.]The oldest case on record is the one mentioned by Eppinger,[17] of an
old beggar whose age is stated at one hundred and twenty years.[Footnote 17: _Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, Bd.The occurrence of simple ulcer of the stomach under ten years of age is
extremely rare.Rokitansky, with his enormous experience, said that he
had never seen a case under fourteen years.[18] There are recorded,
however, a number of cases of gastric ulcer in infancy and childhood,
but there is doubt as to how many of these are genuine examples of
simple ulcer.Rehn in 1874 analyzed a number, although by no means all,
of the reputed cases, and found only six, or at the most seven, which
would stand criticism.[19] The age in these seven cases varied between
seven days and thirteen years.In one case (Donne) a cicatrix was found
in the stomach of a child three years old.Since the publication of
Rehn's article at least four apparently genuine cases have been
reported--namely, one by Reimer in a child three and a half years old;
one by Goodhart in an infant thirty hours after birth; one by Eross in
a girl twelve years old suffering from acute miliary tuberculosis, in
whom the ulcer perforated into the omental sac; and one by Malinowski
in a girl ten years of age.[20]

{485} the male than in the female.This is apparent from the following

given:[21]

In males the largest number of cases is found between thirty and forty
years, and in females between twenty and thirty.In males 54-1/2 per
cent.of the cases occur after forty years of age, and in females 48.9
per cent.[Footnote 21: These cases are obtained from the same sources as those
of the first table (page 483).]The relation between age and perforation of gastric ulcer will be
discussed in connection with this symptom.The conclusions concerning the age of occurrence of gastric ulcer may
be recapitulated as follows: Simple ulcer of the stomach most
frequently develops in the female between twenty and thirty, and in the
male between thirty and forty.At the post-mortem table it is found
with almost equal frequency in the four decades between twenty and
sixty, but clinically it appears with greatly diminished frequency
after forty years of age.In infancy and early childhood simple ulcer
of the stomach is a curiosity.We have no positive information as to the influence of climate upon the
production of gastric ulcer.The disease seems to be somewhat unequal
in its geographical distribution, but the data bearing upon this point
are altogether insufficient.According to the returns of Dahlerup and of Grunfeld, gastric ulcer is
unusually common in Copenhagen.[22] According to Starcke's
report[23]--which, however, is not based upon a large number of
cases--the percentage is also unusually high in Jena.Sperk says that
gastric ulcer is very common in Eastern Siberia.[24] Palgrave gives a
high percentage of its occurrence in Arabia.[25] The disease is less
common in France than in England or in Germany,[26] and in general
appears to be more common in northern than in southern countries.The
statement of DaCosta[27] coincides with my own impression that gastric
ulcer is less common in this country than in England or in Germany.I
have found 6 cases of open ulcer of the stomach in about 800 autopsies
made by me in New York.[Footnote 22: Dahlerup in Copenhagen (abstract in _Canstatt's
Jahresbericht_, 1842) found 26 cases in 200 autopsies (13 per cent.)made in the course of a year and a half.cit._) found
124 cicatrices in 1150 autopsies (11 per cent.).]cit._) found 39 cases in 384 autopsies (10

expresses the same opinion in the _Proc.In 444,564 deaths in New York City from 1868 to 1882, inclusive, ulcer
of the stomach was assigned as the cause of death only in 410 cases.Little value can be assigned to these statistics as regards a disease
so difficult of diagnosis.]{486} Gastric ulcer is more common among the poor than among the rich.Anxiety, mental depression, scanty food, damp dwellings, insufficient
exercise, and exposure to extreme cold are among the depressing
influences which have been assigned as predisposing causes of gastric
ulcer, but without sufficient proof.The comparative frequency of gastric ulcer among needlewomen,
maidservants, and female cooks has attracted the attention of all who
have had large opportunity for clinical observation.Pressure upon the pit of the stomach, either by wearing tight belts or
in the pursuit of certain occupations, such as those of shoemaking, of
tailoring, and of weaving, is thought by Habershon and others to
predispose to ulcer of the stomach.[28]

[Footnote 28: Bernutz found gastric ulcer in a turner in porcelain, and
learned that other workmen in the same factory had vomited blood.He
thinks that in this and in similar occupations heavy particles of dust
collecting in the mouth and throat may be swallowed with the saliva,
and by their irritation cause gastric ulcer (_Gaz.des Hopitaux_, June
18, 1881).]Vomiting of blood has been known in several instances to affect a
number of members of the same family, but beyond this unsatisfactory
evidence there is nothing to show hereditary influence in the origin of
gastric ulcer.In a few cases injury of the region of the stomach, as by a fall or a
blow, has been assigned as the cause of ulcer.The efficacy of this
cause has been accepted by Gerhardt,[29] Lebert, Ziemssen, and others.In many of the cases in which this cause has been assigned the symptoms
of ulcer appeared so long after the injury that it is doubtful whether
there was any connection between the two.[Footnote 29: "Zur Aetiologie u. Therapie d. runden Magengeschwurz,"
_Wiener med.That loss of substance in the mucous membrane of the stomach may be the
result of injury directly or indirectly applied to this organ cannot
admit of question.But it is characteristic of these traumatic ulcers
that they rapidly heal unless the injury is so severe as to prove
speedily fatal.Thus, Duplay[30] relates three cases in which pain,
vomiting, repeated vomiting of blood, and dyspepsia followed contusions
of the region of the stomach.But these traumatic cases, which for a
time gave the symptoms of gastric ulcer, recovered in from two weeks to
two months, whereas the persistence of the symptoms is a characteristic
of simple ulcer.[31]

[Footnote 30: "Contusions de l'Estomac," _Arch.de Med._, Sept.,
1881.][Footnote 31: In a case reported by Potain, however, the symptoms of
ulcer appeared immediately after injury to the stomach, and continued
up to the time of death (_Gaz.In the same way, ulcers of the stomach produced by corrosive poisons as
a rule soon cicatrize, unless death follows after a short time the
action of the poison.That corrosive ulcers may, however, be closely
allied to simple ulcers is shown by an interesting case reported by
Wilson Fox,[32] in which the immediate effects of swallowing
hydrochloric acid were recovered from in about four days, but death
resulted from vomiting of blood two weeks after.At the autopsy the
source of the hemorrhage was found in an ulcer of the pyloric region of
the stomach.[33] A
boy who suffered severely for three or four days after drinking some
strong mineral acid recovered, so that he {487} ate and drank as usual.Two months afterward he died suddenly from perforation of a gastric
ulcer.[Footnote 33: _The Lancet_, April 9, 1842.]While, then, it would be a great error to identify traumatic and
corrosive ulcers of the stomach with simple ulcer, it is possible that
either may become chronic if associated with those conditions of the
stomach or of the constitution, for the most part unknown to us, which
prevent the ready healing of simple ulcer.Gastric ulcer is often associated with other diseases, but it occurs
also uncomplicated in a large number of cases.Most of the diseases
with which it has been found associated are to be regarded simply as
coincident or complicating affections; but as some of them have been
thought to cause the ulcer, they demand consideration in this
connection.The large share taken by pulmonary phthisis in deaths from all causes
renders this disease a frequent associate of gastric ulcer.It is
probable that the lowered vitality of phthisical patients increases
somewhat their liability to gastric ulcer.Moreover, it would not be
strange if gastric ulcer, as well as other exhausting diseases, such as
diabetes and cancer, diminished the power of resisting tuberculous
infection.Genuine tuberculous ulcers occur rarely in the stomach, but
they are not to be identified with simple ulcer.There is no proof that amenorrhoea or other disorders of menstruation
exert any direct influence in the production of gastric ulcer, although
Crisp went so far as to designate certain cases of gastric ulcer as the
menstrual ulcer.[34] Nevertheless, amenorrhoea is a very common symptom
or associated condition in the gastric ulcer of females between sixteen
and thirty years of age.[Footnote 34: _The Lancet_, Aug.Chlorosis and anaemia, especially in young women, favor the development
of gastric ulcer, but that there is no necessary relation between the
two is shown by the occurrence of ulcer in those previously robust.Moreover, it is probable that in some cases in which the anaemia has
been thought to precede the ulcer it has, in fact, been a result rather
than a cause of the ulcer.Especial interest attaches to the relation between gastric ulcer and
diseases of the heart and of the blood-vessels, because to disturbances
in the circulation in the stomach the largest share in the
pathenogenesis of ulcer has been assigned by Virchow.As might be
expected, valvular lesions of the heart and atheroma of the arteries
are not infrequently found in elderly people who are the subjects of
gastric ulcer.A small proportion of cases of ulcer has been associated
also with other diseases in which the arteries are often abnormal, such
as with chronic diffuse nephritis, syphilis, amyloid degeneration, and
endarteritis obliterans.But, after making the most generous allowance
for the influence of these diseases in the causation of ulcer of the
stomach, there remains a large number of cases of ulcer in which no
disease of the heart or of the arteries has been found.[35] Gastric
ulcer develops most frequently between fifteen and forty years of age,
a period when arterial diseases are not common.Changes in the {488}
blood-vessels of the stomach will be described in connection with the
morbid anatomy of gastric ulcer.[Footnote 35: From Berlin are reported the largest number of cases of
gastric ulcer associated with diseases of the circulatory apparatus;
thus, by Berthold 170 out of 294 cases, and by Steiner 71 out of 110
cases of ulcer.Endocarditis and arterial atheroma (present in
one-third of Berthold's cases of ulcer) form the largest proportion of
these diseases.]Chronic passive congestion of the stomach in cases of cirrhosis of the
liver, direct injury to the mucous membrane of the stomach by parasites
in trichinosis, hemorrhage into the coats of the stomach in scorbutus
and in dementia paralytica, persistent vomiting in pregnancy, and
anaemia induced by prolonged lactation, have each been assigned as
causes in a few cases of gastric ulcer, but they are not associated
with gastric ulcer in enough cases to make their causative influence at
all certain.Galliard assigns diabetes mellitus as the cause in one case of gastric
ulcer.[36]

[Footnote 36: _Clin.de la Pitie_, Paris, 1877, p.Rokitansky attributed some cases of gastric ulcer to intermittent
fever.Those who believe in the inflammatory origin of ulcer of the stomach
think that chronic gastritis is an important predisposing cause.The abuse of alcohol is admitted as an indirect cause of gastric ulcer
by the majority of writers.Lastly, burns of the skin, which are an important factor in the
etiology of duodenal ulcers, have been followed only in a very few
instances by ulcer of the stomach.The direct causes of ulcer of the stomach, concerning which our
positive knowledge is very limited, will be considered under the
pathenogenesis of the disease.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The following classes of cases of gastric ulcer may be
distinguished:

First: Gastric ulcer may give rise to no symptoms pointing to its
existence, and be found accidentally at the autopsy when death has
occurred from some other disease.This latent course is most frequent
with gastric ulcers complicating chronic wasting diseases, such as
tuberculosis, and with gastric ulcers in elderly people.Second: Gastric ulcer may give rise to no marked symptoms before
profuse hemorrhage from the stomach or perforation of the stomach,
resulting speedily in death, occurs.Acute ulcers in anaemic females
from fifteen to thirty years of age are those most liable to perforate
without previous symptoms.Third: Gastric ulcer may occasion only the symptoms of chronic
gastritis, or of functional dyspepsia, or of purely nervous gastralgia,
so that its diagnosis is impossible.In this class of cases after a
time characteristic symptoms may develop.Here, too, sudden death may
occur from hemorrhage or from perforation.Fourth: In typical cases characteristic symptoms are present, so that
the diagnosis can be made more or less positively.These symptoms are
pain, and hemorrhage from the stomach, associated usually with vomiting
and disturbances of digestion.The different symptoms of gastric ulcer will now be described.Of all the symptoms, pain is the most constant and is often the first
to attract attention.It is absent throughout the disease only in
exceptional cases.In different cases, and often in the same case at
different times, the pain varies in its quality, its intensity, its
situation, its duration, and in other characteristics.The kind of pain which is most characteristic of gastric ulcer is
severe {489} paroxysmal pain strictly localized in a circumscribed spot
in the epigastrium, coming on soon after eating, and disappearing as
soon as the stomach is relieved of its contents.More common, although less characteristic, than the strictly localized
pain are paroxysms of severe pain, usually called cardialgic[37] or
gastralgic, diffused over the epigastrium and often spreading into the
surrounding regions.This is like the neuralgic pain of nervous
gastralgia, which is not infrequent in chlorotic and hysterical
females.The pain may be so intense as to induce syncope, or even
convulsions, in very sensitive patients.[Footnote 37: There is much confusion as to the meaning of the term
cardialgia.With most English and American writers it signifies
heartburn, while continental writers understand by cardialgia the
severe paroxysms of epigastric pain which we more frequently call
gastralgia.]The strictly localized pain is probably caused by direct irritation
confined to the nerves in the floor of the ulcer.In the diffuse
gastralgic attacks the irritation radiates or is reflected to the
neighboring nerves, and sometimes to those at a distance.In most cases of gastric ulcer localized epigastric pain and diffuse
gastralgic paroxysms are combined.The painful sense of oppression and fulness in the epigastrium which is
felt in many cases of gastric ulcer after eating is simply a dyspeptic
symptom, and is probably referable to an associated chronic catarrhal
gastritis.This dyspeptic pain is of little value in diagnosis.Most subjects of gastric ulcer feel in the intervals between the
paroxysms a more or less constant dull pain, or it may be only a sense
of uneasiness, in the epigastrium.When sharp epigastric pain is felt
continuously, it is usually inferred that the ulcer has extended to the
peritoneum and has caused a circumscribed peritonitis, but this
inference is not altogether trustworthy.The quality of the pain caused by gastric ulcer is described variously
as burning, gnawing, boring, less frequently as lancinating.More important than the quality is the situation of the pain.The
situation of the localized pain is usually at or a little below the
ensiform cartilage.It may, however, be felt as low as the umbilicus or
it may deviate to the hypochondria.In addition to pain in the
epigastrium (point epigastrique), Cruveilhier called attention to the
frequent presence of pain in the dorsal region (point rachidien).The
dorsal pain, which may be more severe than the epigastric, is sometimes
interscapular, and sometimes corresponds to the lowest dorsal or to the
upper lumbar vertebrae.It is usually a little to the left of the
spine.The pain is often described as extending from the pit of the
stomach through to the back.According to Brinton, the situation of the localized pain gives a clue
to the situation of the ulcer, pain near the left border of the
ensiform cartilage indicating ulcer near the cardiac orifice, pain in
the median line and to the right of this indicating ulcer of the
pyloric region, and pain in the left hypochondrium indicating ulcer of
the fundus.It does not often happen that the pain remains so sharply
localized as to make possible this diagnosis, even if the situation of
the pain were a safe guide.Of the various circumstances which influence the severity of the pain
in gastric ulcer, the most important is the effect of food.Pain
usually {490} comes on within a few minutes to half an hour after
taking food, although it may appear immediately after ingestion or be
delayed for an hour or more.The pain continues until the stomach is
relieved of its contents by vomiting or by their passage into the
duodenum.It is unsafe to attempt to diagnose the position of the ulcer
merely from the length of time which elapses between the ingestion of
food and the onset of pain.It has sometimes been noticed that as
improvement progresses pain comes on later and later after eating.As
might naturally be expected, coarse, indigestible,
imperfectly-masticated food, sour and spirituous liquids, and hot
substances are more irritating than bland articles of diet.In some
exceptional cases the ingestion of even coarse food, instead of
aggravating, has had no effect upon the pain, or at least for the time
being has even relieved it.External pressure usually increases the intensity of the pain of
gastric ulcer; in rare instances pressure relieves the pain.Rest and the recumbent posture as a rule alleviate the pain of ulcer of
the stomach.The position of the patient may affect the severity of the
pain in a more striking way.It may naturally be supposed that that
posture is most agreeable which removes from the ulcer the weight of
the food during digestion.Hence it was claimed by Osborne[38] that the
site of the ulcer could often be inferred from the effect of posture on
the pain.Thus, relief in the prone position would indicate ulcer of
the posterior wall; relief in the supine position, ulcer of the
anterior wall; relief on the left or on the right side, ulcer of the
pyloric or of the cardiac region respectively.As ulcer of the
posterior wall is the most frequent, relief should be obtained oftener
by bending forward or by lying on the face than in the supine position.Experience has shown that the influence of posture on the pain is not a
safe guide in diagnosing the location of the ulcer.[Footnote 38: Jonathan Osborne, _Dublin Journal of Medical Science_,
vol.Mental emotions--particularly anxiety and anger--fatigue, even moderate
exercise, exposure to cold, and the menstrual molimen may each cause
exacerbations of pain in some cases of gastric ulcer.Tenderness on pressure is a common symptom of gastric ulcer.A
localized point of tenderness may be discovered even when the
subjective pain is not localized.Pain sometimes follows pressure not
immediately, but after a brief interval.A fixed point of tenderness
can often be determined when the stomach is empty more accurately than
when it is full.The tender spot can sometimes be covered by the
finger's end.In searching for a point of tenderness it should be
remembered that many persons are very sensitive to pressure in the
epigastrium, and also that pressure is not without danger to those who
are the subjects of gastric ulcer.Not only may pressure induce
paroxysms of pain, but it may cause even rupture of the ulcerated walls
of the stomach.[39] Hence pressure should be cautiously employed and
should not be often repeated.[Footnote 39: Dalton has reported a case in which perforation of a
gastric ulcer occurred while the patient was subjected in a water-cure
establishment to kneading of the abdomen to relieve his flatulence
(_Trans.In some cases of gastric ulcer pain is felt in regions at a distance
from the stomach.The most frequent of these so-called radiation
neuralgias are--neuralgia of the lower intercostal spaces, combined
sometimes with {491} hyperaesthesia or with analgesia of the affected
region, pain in the right shoulder (perhaps due to adhesions between
the stomach and the liver or the diaphragm), pain in the left shoulder,
and pain in the loins.In a case of ulcer reported by Traube
terminating in perforation the sole complaint, besides loss of appetite
and retching, had been difficulty in breathing and oppression in the
chest.These symptoms, which may be combined with gastralgic paroxysms,
are referred by Traube to transference of the irritation from the
gastric to the pulmonary filaments of the pneumogastric nerve.[40]

[Footnote 40: _Deutsche Klinik_, 1861, No.These symptoms evidently
correspond to the vagus neurosis described by Rosenbach, in which, as
the result of reflex irritation of the pneumogastric nerve in the
stomach, occur difficulty in breathing, oppression in the chest,
palpitation, arhythmical action of the heart, and epigastric pulsation
(_Deutsche med.Wochenschr._, 1879, Nos.Sometimes the pain of gastric ulcer intermits for days or even weeks.When the intermission is of considerable duration it is probable that
cicatrization has been in progress.It should, however, be remembered
that gastralgic attacks may continue even after cicatrization of the
ulcer is completed, probably in consequence of compression of
nerve-filaments by the cicatricial tissue.Once in a while the pain
exhibits a marked periodicity in its appearance.Thus in a case of
ulcer ending fatally from hemorrhage the pain came on but once a day,
and that with considerable regularity at the same hour.In this case
the pain was relieved by taking food.[41] The pain of gastric ulcer may
be temporarily relieved by hemorrhage from the stomach, and perhaps by
division of the irritated nerve by sloughing (Habershon).[Footnote 41: Case reported by Peacock, _Rep.The causes of the pain of gastric ulcer are not far to seek.Foremost
is the irritation of nerve-filaments exposed by the ulcerative process.The irritation may be by mechanical, chemical, or thermic agencies.With our present imperfect knowledge it is profitless to discuss
whether the pneumogastric or the sympathetic nerves are the chief
carriers of the abnormal sensations.[42] In the next place, we may have
radiation of the irritation from these nerves to neighboring and even
to remote nerves.Furthermore, the extension of the inflammation to the
peritoneum and the surrounding parts, and the formation of adhesions,
are additional factors in some cases in causing pain.Finally, the
great differences in susceptibility to pain manifested by different
individuals is to be borne in mind.[Footnote 42: Leven, without sufficient reason, distinguishes two kinds
of gastralgic attacks--the one having its point of departure in the
pneumogastric, the other in the sympathetic nerve; in the former the
pain is associated with dyspnoea and palpitation of the heart; in the
latter the pain is deeper, and is accompanied by vaso-motor (?)troubles on one side of the body.]Next to pain, vomiting is the most frequent symptom of gastric ulcer.There is, however, little which is characteristic of ulcer in this
symptom, unless the vomited material contains blood.In some cases of
gastric ulcer vomiting is the most marked and most distressing symptom
of the disease.It may, however, be absent during the whole course of
gastric ulcer.Vomiting occurs most frequently after taking food, and is greatly
aggravated by an unregulated diet.Sometimes nearly everything which is
taken into the stomach is vomited.The vomiting of mucus or of a {492}
thin fluid unmixed with food is indicative only of chronic catarrhal
gastritis.Alimentary vomiting, which is more indicative of gastric
ulcer, usually occurs not immediately after taking food, but at the
acme of a gastralgic attack caused by the food.Soon after the stomach
is emptied by one or more acts of vomiting the pain is relieved.The
act of vomiting is usually easy, and at times is hardly more than
regurgitation of the food.Sometimes the patient experiences an
excessively sour taste from the vomit.Vomiting exhausts the patient by withdrawing nutriment, and when
persistent may even cause death from inanition.But in some cases of
gastric ulcer, especially in women, the vomiting seems to be mainly a
nervous symptom, and even when long continued may be attended by little
or no loss of flesh.Evidently, more food is retained in these cases
than might be supposed.There are two evident causes of vomiting in gastric ulcer--namely,
chronic catarrhal gastritis, which is a frequent complication, and
direct irritation of the nerves in the ulcer.Vomiting due to
dilatation of the stomach is oftener a sequel than an immediate symptom
of gastric ulcer.For the diagnosis of gastric ulcer hemorrhage from the stomach is the
most important symptom.The frequency of only the larger hemorrhages can be determined with any
degree of exactness.If the blood be effused in small quantity or
slowly, it may be discharged solely with the stools and escape
detection.Such slight hemorrhages doubtless occur in most cases of
gastric ulcer.It is probable that easily-recognized hemorrhages from
the stomach occur in about one-third of the cases of gastric ulcer.[43]
Hemorrhage is absent as a rule in the acute perforating ulcer of the
stomach.[Footnote 43: In consequence of the uncertainty of the diagnosis in
cases of gastric ulcer which recover without hemorrhage, the estimates
of the frequency of this symptom have a very limited value, and will
vary with different observers according to their standard of diagnosis
of this disease.Lebert observed gastric hemorrhage in four-fifths of
his carefully-studied cases, and in three-fifths of his cases there was
profuse haematemesis.Brinton estimates that the larger hemorrhages
occur in about one-third of the cases.Muller found them in one-fourth
of the cases which he analyzed.]In most cases hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is preceded by pain,
vomiting, and disturbances of digestion.Antecedent symptoms may,
however, be absent, or may be so obscure that no suspicion of ulcer
exists until the hemorrhage occurs.The hemorrhage may be slight, moderate, or excessive in amount
(Cruveilhier).The larger hemorrhages are those which are most
distinctive of gastric ulcer.The blood may be vomited, or voided with the stools, or retained in the
stomach and the intestines.As has been remarked, when the hemorrhage is scanty all the blood may
escape by the bowel.Sometimes, although much less frequently, blood
effused in large quantity is entirely evacuated with the stools.After
haematemesis more or less blood is discharged by the bowel, sometimes
for several days after the vomiting of blood has ceased.Blood which
has traversed the whole length of the intestinal canal acquires a tarry
consistence and a black or brownish color in consequence of the
production of dark-brown haematin by the action of the digestive juices
{493} upon the haemoglobin, and in consequence of the formation of
black sulphide of iron by the union of hydrogen sulphide in the lower
part of the intestine with the iron of the haematin.The passage of
these black viscid stools is called melaena.Inasmuch as we cannot
presume gastric hemorrhage to be absent simply because no blood has
been vomited, it is evidently important to examine the stools for blood
when the diagnosis of gastric ulcer is obscure, and also in cases of
gastric ulcer where there are symptoms of internal hemorrhage not
accounted for by blood vomited.It should be remembered that certain
drugs, particularly iron and bismuth, may blacken the feces.In very exceptional cases of gastric ulcer the effusion of a large
volume of blood causes sudden death before any of the blood has been
vomited.The autopsy shows the stomach and more or less of the small
intestine distended with coagulated blood.Hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is usually made manifest by the vomiting
of blood.The quantity of the vomited blood varies from mere traces to
several pounds.The color and the consistence of the blood depend upon
the quantity effused and the length of time that the blood has remained
in the stomach.Blood which has been acted upon by the gastric juice is
coagulated, has a grumous consistence, and acquires by the formation of
haematin out of haemoglobin a dark-brown color, often compared to that
of coffee-grounds.Blood effused in small quantity is usually vomited
only with the food, and has usually the coffee-grounds appearance.The
patient's condition is not appreciably influenced by this slight loss
of blood.A little blood expelled after repeated acts of vomiting has
no diagnostic importance.Vomiting usually occurs soon after a large
gastric hemorrhage.It is the mechanical distension of the stomach
rather than any irritating quality of the blood which causes the
vomiting.Blood which is rejected immediately after a large gastric
hemorrhage is alkaline, fluid, and of an arterial (rarely of a venous)
hue.Often, however, even with large hemorrhages, the blood remains
sufficiently long in the stomach to be partly coagulated and to be
darkened in color.Ulcer more frequently than any other disease of the
stomach causes the vomiting of unaltered blood in large quantity.But
this kind of haematemesis is not peculiar to simple ulcer.It may occur
in other diseases, such as gastric cancer, and coffee-ground vomiting
may be associated with ulcer.Copious haematemesis in cases of gastric ulcer appears usually without
premonition, or it may be preceded for a day or two by increased pain.Its occurrence is somewhat more common during the digestion of food
than in the intervals, but there have been cases of ulcer where the
bleeding was favored by an empty stomach and was checked by the
distension of the organ with food.The free use of stimulants and
violent physical or mental exertion may excite hemorrhage.With the
onset of the hemorrhage the patient experiences a sense of warmth and
of oppression at the epigastrium, followed by faintness, nausea, and
the vomiting of a large quantity of blood.An attack of syncope often
causes, at least temporarily, cessation of the hemorrhage.But the
thrombus which closes the eroded vessel may easily be washed away, so
that the hemorrhage often recurs and continues at intervals for several
days, thereby greatly increasing the danger to the patient.Thus, the
tendency is for {494} the hemorrhage from gastric ulcer to appear in
phases or periods occupying several days.A single hemorrhage is rarely so profuse as to cause immediate death.More frequently the patient dies after successive hemorrhages.In the
majority of cases the hemorrhage is not immediately dangerous to life,
but is followed by symptoms of anaemia, more or less profound according
to the strength of the patient and the amount of blood lost.Prostration and pallor follow the larger hemorrhages.Dizziness,
ringing in the ears, and dimness of vision appear when the patient
attempts to leave the recumbent posture.Thirst is often a marked
symptom.The pulse is feeble and more frequent than normal.There is
often a moderate elevation of temperature (anaemic fever) after profuse
hemorrhage.The urine is pale, abundant, and sometimes contains albumen
(Quincke).After a few days anaemic cardiac murmurs can often be heard.Under favorable circumstances these symptoms of anaemia disappear in
the course of a few weeks.The other symptoms of ulcer, particularly the pain, are sometimes
notably relieved, and may even disappear, after an abundant hemorrhage.They usually, however, return sooner or later.After a variable
interval one attack of haematemesis is likely to be followed by others.There is much diversity in different cases as regards the frequency of
these attacks and the character of the symptoms in the intervals.In a
few cases recovery follows a single attack of gastric hemorrhage; in
other cases the hemorrhage recurs frequently after intervals of only a
few days, weeks, or months; in still other cases hemorrhage recurs only
after long intervals, perhaps of years, although other symptoms of
ulcer continue.Sometimes the disappearance of symptoms indicates only
an apparent cure, and later the patient dies suddenly while in apparent
health by a profuse gastric hemorrhage.In the rare cases of this last
variety Cruveilhier has found sometimes that the ulcer has cicatrized
except just over the eroded blood-vessel.The sources of the hemorrhage in gastric ulcer will be described in
connection with the morbid anatomy.The symptoms of gastric indigestion are commonly, although not
constantly, present in gastric ulcer.They may constitute the sole
symptoms, in which case the diagnosis of the lesion is impossible.The
most important local symptoms of gastric dyspepsia are diminution, less
frequently perversion or increase, of the appetite; increased thirst;
during digestion, and sometimes independent of digestion, a feeling of
discomfort merely or of painful oppression, or even of sharp pain, in
the epigastrium; nausea; vomiting of undigested food, of mucus, and of
bile; regurgitation of thin fluids; often acid, sometimes neutral or
alkaline, flatulence, with belching of gas, and constipation.In many
cases of gastric ulcer the appetite is not disturbed, but the patient
refrains from eating on account of the pain caused by taking food.Among the so-called sympathetic symptoms of dyspepsia are headache,
dizziness, depression of spirits, oppression in the chest, and
irregularity of the heart's action.Dyspepsia contributes its share to
the production of the anaemia and of the loss of flesh and strength
which are present in some degree in most cases of chronic gastric
ulcer.{495} In many cases of acute perforating ulcer, as well as in some
cases of chronic ulcer, the symptoms are either absent or they are but
slightly marked.It has been demonstrated that in many cases of gastric
ulcer the resorptive power of the mucous membrane of the stomach is
unimpaired.[44]

[Footnote 44: This is shown by the experiments of Pentzoldt and Faber,
who determined the length of time which elapsed between swallowing
gelatin capsules containing iodide of potassium and the appearance of
the iodide in the saliva (_Berl.Quetsch observed rapid absorption from the stomach in two cases of
gastric ulcer (_ibid._, 1884, No.It is believed that also the
duration of the digestive process in the stomach is often within normal
limits in cases of gastric ulcer, although exact experiments upon this
point, as they require the use of the stomach-pump, have not been made
in this disease (Leube).]The most common cause of dyspepsia in gastric ulcer is the chronic
catarrhal gastritis which usually accompanies this disease.It is
probable that the movements of the stomach may be seriously interfered
with by destruction of the muscular coat of the stomach when the ulcer
is of considerable size and is seated in the pyloric region.Adhesions
of the stomach to surrounding parts may likewise impair the normal
movements of the stomach.It is possible that ulcers, especially those
which are very painful, may cause reflex disturbance of the peristaltic
movements of the stomach and alterations in the quality or the quantity
of the gastric juice.The serious digestive disturbances which are
caused by distortions and dilatation of the stomach resulting from
cicatricial contraction of gastric ulcer are not considered in this
article.Although Niemeyer emphasized the frequency in gastric ulcer of a
strikingly red tongue with smooth or furrowed surface, it does not
appear that any especial importance is to be attached to this or to any
other condition of the tongue as a symptom of the disease.Increased flow of saliva is a rare symptom, which, when it occurs, is
usually associated with dyspepsia.Constipation is the rule in gastric ulcer.The most important of the
various circumstances which combine to produce this condition is the
small amount of solid food taken and retained by the patient.The
restraint caused by gastric ulcer and gastric catarrh in the normal
movements of the stomach may diminish by reflex action the peristalsis
of the intestines (Traube and Radziejewski).The passage of large
quantities of blood along the intestinal canal is often associated with
colicky pains and diarrhoea.Amenorrhoea is a symptom which was formerly thought to be
characteristic of gastric ulcer, although there was much discussion as
to whether it was the cause or the result of the ulcer.Amenorrhoea is
indeed common in the gastric ulcer of young women, but there is nothing
strange in this when one considers the frequency of amenorrhoea in
general, and its causation by various debilitating and depressing
influences such as are to be found in gastric ulcer.Notwithstanding a
few striking cases which have been recorded, it has not been
demonstrated that hemorrhages vicarious of menstruation take place from
gastric ulcer.Gastric ulcer is not a febrile disease.Temporary elevation of
temperature may follow profuse gastrorrhagia and may attend various
complications, of which the most important are gastritis and
peritonitis.It has been recently claimed by Peter that the
surface-temperature of the {496} epigastrium is elevated in gastric
ulcer, but the observations upon this point are as yet too few for any
positive conclusions.[45]

[Footnote 45: According to Peter, the normal surface-temperature of the
epigastrium is from 95-1/2 degrees to 96 degrees F.(35.3 degrees to
35.5 degrees C.), while in gastric ulcer the temperature may equal or
even exceed by one or two degrees the axillary temperature.It is said
to register the highest during attacks of pain and of vomiting and
after hemorrhages (_Gaz.des Hopitaux_, June 23 and 30, 1883).See also
Beaurieux (_Essai sur la Pseudo-gastralgie, etc._, These, Paris,
1879).]The general health of the patient remains sometimes surprisingly good,
even in cases of gastric ulcer with symptoms sufficiently marked to
establish the diagnosis.But in most cases of chronic gastric ulcer the
general nutrition sooner or later becomes impaired.This cannot well be
otherwise when dyspepsia, vomiting, paroxysms of severe pain, and
hemorrhage are present, separately or in combination, for any great
length of time.In proportion to the severity and the continuance of
these symptoms the patient becomes pale, weak, and emaciated.The face,
thin, anxious, of a grayish-white color, and marked with sharp lines of
suffering, presents the appearance which the older writers called
facies abdominalis, to which even so recent an author as Brinton
attaches exaggerated diagnostic importance.A little cachectic dropsy
may appear about the ankles.While it is true that the general
nutrition is less rapidly, less continuously, and, as a rule, less
deeply, impaired in gastric ulcer than in gastric cancer, nevertheless
sometimes a cachexia develops in the former which is not to be
distinguished from that of cancer.Litten[46] relates a case of gastric
ulcer which simulated for a time pernicious anaemia.In this case the
profound anaemia could not be explained by vomiting, hemorrhage, or
other symptoms of ulcer.[Footnote 46: _Berliner klin.Beyond determining the existence of a fixed point of epigastric
tenderness, physical examination of the region of the stomach is
usually only of negative value in the diagnosis of gastric ulcer.In
some cases of ulcer of the stomach epigastric pulsation is very marked,
and sometimes most marked during gastralgic attacks.In these cases
there may be dilatation of the aorta from paralysis of vaso-motor
nerves analogous to the dilatation of the carotid and temporal arteries
in certain forms of migraine (Rosenbach).When the diagnosis lies
between gastric ulcer and gastric cancer, the presence of epigastric
tumor is justly considered to weigh against ulcer; but it is important
to know that tumor may be associated with ulcer.Thickening of the
tissues around old ulcers and the presence of adhesions may give rise
to a tumor.A thickened portion of omentum which had become adherent
over an old gastric ulcer produced a tumor which led to a mistake in
the diagnosis.[47] Rosenbach[48] calls attention to the occasional
production of false tumors by spasm of the muscular coat of the stomach
around a gastric ulcer.These tumors disappear spontaneously or yield
to the artificial distension of the stomach by Seidlitz powders--a
procedure which one would not venture to adopt if he suspected gastric
ulcer.Fenwick thinks that in some cases of gastric ulcer fixation of
the stomach by adhesions can be made out by physical exploration.[Footnote 47: A. Beer, _Wiener med.Wochenschrift_, 1882, p.The gravest symptom which can occur in gastric ulcer is the perforation
of the ulcer into the general peritoneal cavity.{497} Only rough estimates can be made of the frequency of this
symptom.These estimates vary from 2 to 25 per cent.From the data
which I have collected I infer that perforation into the general
peritoneal cavity occurs in about 6-1/2 per cent.of all cases of
gastric ulcer.[49]

[Footnote 49: Miquel (_Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.65, 1864) reckons
the frequency of perforation at 2 per cent.Brinton's estimate of
13-1/2 per cent.He found 69 cases of
perforation in 257 open ulcers collected from various sources.He
doubles the number of open ulcers, as he considers cicatrized ulcers
twice as frequent as the open.The statistics of some of the authors to
whom he refers should not be used in this computation, either because
they do not give accurately the number of cases of perforation, or
because they include under perforation all cases of ulcer which have
penetrated all of the coats of the stomach, whereas of course only
perforation into the general peritoneal cavity should be here included.Valuable and laborious as are Brinton's researches, his statistics upon
this point, as upon many others, are inaccurate.In 249 fatal cases of open ulcer taken from the statistics of Jaksch,
Dittrich, Willigk, Wrany (_Prager Vierteljahr._, vols.),
Eppinger, Starcke, Chambers, Moore, and Lebert (_loc.cit._), I find 50
cases of perforation into the peritoneal cavity.This makes the
percentage of perforations 6-1/2 if the open ulcers be multiplied by 3,
the number of cicatrized ulcers being taken as three times that of open
ulcers (p.This method of computation, which is adopted by
Brinton, is defective on account of the uncertainty as to the proper
proportion between cicatrized and open ulcers.Lebert observed 9 cases of perforation with fatal peritonitis in his
252 cases studied clinically.He places the frequency of perforation
with peritonitis at 3 to 5 per cent., which corresponds to Engel's
estimate of 5-1/2 per cent.(_Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, 1853, ii.).]As regards sex, perforation occurs two to three times oftener in the
female than in the male.This increased liability is referable mainly
to the preponderance of the acute perforating ulcer in young women.[50]

[Footnote 50: The liability to perforation in females seems to be not
only absolutely, but also relatively, to the number of ulcers greater
than in males, although, on the contrary, Brinton holds that the excess
of perforations in females is not greater than that of ulcers.Berthold
found perforation in 3.1 per cent.of the cases of gastric ulcer in
males, and in 9.7 per cent.In the female the liability to perforation of gastric ulcer is greatest
between fourteen and thirty years of age.In the male there seems to be
no greater liability to perforation at one age than at another.[51]

[Footnote 51: Of 139 cases of perforated ulcer in females, Brinton
found that four-fifths occurred before the age of thirty-five.He
calculates the average age at which perforation occurs in the female as
twenty-seven, and in the male as forty-two.He thinks that the average
liability to perforation in both sexes decreases as life advances,
although he holds that the liability to ulcer itself constantly
increases with age.]As will be explained in considering the morbid anatomy, ulcers of the
anterior wall of the stomach perforate more frequently than those in
other situations.As regards the symptoms which may have preceded perforation three
groups of cases can be distinguished:

In the first there has been no complaint of gastric disturbance.In the
midst of apparent health perforation may occur and cause death within a
few hours.This is the ulcere foudroyante of French writers.It is met
with more commonly in chlorotic young women than in any other class.In the second group of cases, which are more frequent, gastric symptoms
have been present for a longer or shorter time, but have been so
ambiguous that the diagnosis of gastric ulcer is not clear until
perforation occurs.Then, unfortunately, the diagnosis is of little
more than retrospective interest.In the third group of cases perforation takes place in the course of
gastric ulcer, the existence of which has been made evident by
characteristic symptoms, such as localized pain and profuse hemorrhage.{498} The immediate cause of perforation of gastric ulcer is often some
agency which produces mechanical tension of the stomach, such as
distension of the organ with food or with gas, vomiting, straining at
stool, coughing, sneezing, pressure on the epigastrium, violent
exertion, and jolting of the body.With the escape of the solid, the fluid, and the gaseous contents of
the stomach into the peritoneal cavity at the moment of perforation, an
agonizing pain is felt, beginning in the epigastrium and extending
rapidly over the abdomen, which becomes very sensitive to pressure.The
pain sometimes radiates to the shoulders.Symptoms of collapse often
appear immediately or they may develop gradually.The pulse becomes
small, rapid, and feeble.The face is pale, anxious, and drawn (facies
hippocratica).The surface of the body, particularly of the
extremities, is cold and covered with clammy sweat.The internal
temperature may be subnormal, normal, or elevated; after the
development of peritonitis it is usually, but not always, elevated.Consciousness is usually retained to the last, although the patient is
apathetic.Vomiting is sometimes absent--a circumstance which may be of
value in diagnosis, and which Traube attributes to the readiness with
which the contents of the stomach can be discharged through the
abnormal opening into the peritoneal cavity.The respirations become more and more frequent and costal
in type.Suppression of urine is not an
uncommon symptom, although there may be frequent and painful attempts
at micturition.Albumen and casts may appear temporarily in the urine.Retraction of one testicle, like that in renal colic, has been observed
(Blomfield).The patient usually lies on his back with the knees drawn
up.The abdomen is often at first hard and retracted from spasmodic
contraction of the abdominal muscles, but later it usually becomes
tympanitic, sometimes to an extreme degree.The presence of tympanitic
resonance replacing hepatic dulness in front is usually considered the
most important physical sign of gas free in the peritoneal cavity, but
this sign is equivocal.On the one hand, the presence of adhesions over
the anterior surface of the liver may prevent the gas from getting
between the liver and the diaphragm;[52] and on the other hand, in
cases of meteorism coils of intestine may make their way between the
liver and the diaphragm, or the liver may be pushed upward and
backward, so that its anterior surface becomes superior and the hepatic
dulness in front disappears.Physical examination may reveal in the
dependent parts of the peritoneal cavity an accumulation of fluid
partly escaped from the stomach and partly an inflammatory exudate.[53]
For humane reasons one should not submit the patient to the pain of
movement in order to elicit a succussion sound or to determine change
in the position of the fluid upon changing the position of the
patient.[54] There is sometimes relief from pain for some hours before
death.[Footnote 52: Even without these adhesions liver dulness may persist
after perforation of the stomach, as in a case of Nothnagel's in which
for twenty-four hours after a large perforation from gastric ulcer the
abdomen was retracted and hepatic dulness was well marked (Garmise,
_Ulcus Ventriculi cum peritonitide perforativa_, Inaug.Diss., Jena,
1879).][Footnote 53: In a case of peritonitis resulting from perforation of a
latent ulcer of the duodenum, Concato found in the acid fluid withdrawn
by aspiration from the peritoneal cavity Sarcina ventriculi (_Giorn.delle Scienze Med._, 1879, No.[Footnote 54: Other symptoms which have been thought to be diagnostic
of pneumo-peritoneum in {499} distinction from meteorism, but the value
of which is doubtful, are these: In pneumo-peritoneum the respiratory
murmur can be heard by auscultation over the entire abdomen, while in
meteorism it does not extend beyond the region of the stomach
(Cantani); in the former amphoric sounds synchronous with respiration
can sometimes be heard over the abdomen (Larghi); borborygmi are heard,
if at all, distantly and feebly; the percussion note of gas free over
the liver is different from that of tympanitic intestine (Traube); the
percussion note is of the same character over the whole anterior wall
of the abdomen; the epigastric region is more elastic to the feel than
in tympanites; the distension of the abdomen is more uniform than in
tympanites; and coils of distended intestine, sometimes showing
peristaltic movement, cannot be seen or felt as in some cases of
meteorism (Howitz).]There are exceptional cases of perforation in which some of the most
important of the enumerated symptoms, such as pain, tenderness of the
abdomen on pressure, tympanites, and the symptoms of collapse, are
absent.Death sometimes occurs from shock within six or eight hours after
perforation.More frequently life is prolonged from eighteen to
thirty-six hours, it may be even for three or four days, and, very
rarely, even longer.[55] When life is prolonged more than twelve hours
an acute diffuse peritonitis is usually but not always developed.[Footnote 55: In the _Descriptive Catalogue of the Warren Anatomical
Museum_, by Dr.J. B. S. Jackson, p.448, Boston, 1870, is described a
case of gastric ulcer in which, so far as can be judged by the symptoms
and the post-mortem appearances, the patient lived nineteen days after
perforation.]The contents of the stomach, instead of being diffused throughout the
peritoneal cavity, may be confined by a rapidly-developed circumscribed
peritonitis to a space near the stomach, or perforation may occur into
a space previously shut off from the general peritoneal sac by
adhesions.In this way circumscribed peritoneal abscesses form in the
neighborhood of the stomach.Diffuse peritonitis may be caused either
by an extension of the inflammation or by the rupture of these
abscesses into the general peritoneal cavity.The cases of
circumscribed peritonitis following perforation of gastric ulcer, with
escape of the contents of the stomach, although more protracted than
those in which the whole peritoneal surface is at once involved,
generally terminate fatally sooner or later.The most interesting of these peritoneal abscesses is the variety to
which Leyden has given the name of pyo-pneumothorax subphrenicus (false
pneumothorax of Cossy), the diagnostic features of which first were
recognized by G. W. Barlow and Wilks in 1845.[56] Here there is a
cavity, circumscribed by adhesions, just beneath the diaphragm,
containing pus and gas and communicating with either the stomach or the
intestine.By the encroachment of this cavity upon the thoracic space
the symptoms and signs of pyo-pneumothorax are simulated.Barlow and
Leyden have diagnosed during life this affection when resulting from
perforated gastric ulcer.The points in diagnosis from genuine
pyo-pneumothorax are the presence of respiratory murmur from the
clavicle to the third rib, the extension of the respiratory murmur
downward by deep inspiration, history of preceding gastric disturbance
with circumscribed peritonitis, absence of preceding pulmonary
symptoms, rapid variations in the limits of dulness with changes in the
position of the body, absence or only slight evidence of increased
intrapleural pressure (such as bulging of the {500} thorax as a whole,
and of the intercostal spaces), displacement of the heart, displacement
of the liver downward, and, if necessary, the determination by means of
a manometer that the pressure in the abscess cavity rises during
inspiration and falls during expiration, the reverse being true in
genuine pneumothorax.[57]

[Footnote 56: Barlow and Wilks, _London Med.Gazette_, May, 1845;
Leyden, _Zeitschr.Med._, i. Heft 2; Cossy, _Arch.de
Med._, Nov., 1879; Tillmanns, _Arch.[Footnote 57: Schreiber has shown that this last diagnostic point,
which was given by Leyden, is not without exceptions, for the pressure
in the peritoneal cavity may sink during inspiration and rise during
expiration (as in the pleural cavity), especially when the diaphragm
takes little or no part in respiration ("Ueber Pleural- und
Peritonealdruck," _Deutsches Arch.Med._, July 31, 1883).]Through the medium of subphrenic abscess, or directly through adhesions
between the stomach and the diaphragm, gastric ulcer may perforate into
one of the pleural cavities (generally the left) and cause empyema or
pneumo-pyothorax.Adhesions may form between the diaphragm and the
pulmonary pleura, so that the ulcer perforates directly into the lung;
in which case pulmonary gangrene or pulmonary abscess is usually
developed.The diagnosis of the perforation into the lung has been made
by recognizing a sour odor and sour reaction of the expectoration, and
by finding in the sputum particles of food derived from the stomach.Sudden death from suffocation has followed perforation of the stomach
into the lung.[58]

[Footnote 58: Tillmanns (_loc.cit._) has collected 12 cases of
communication between the stomach and the thoracic cavity from
perforation of gastric ulcer; all proved fatal.In Sturges's case of
recovery from pneumothorax supposed to be produced by perforation of a
gastric ulcer the diagnosis of the cause of the pneumothorax was very
doubtful (_The Lancet_, Feb.Perforation of gastric ulcer into the transverse colon has been
followed by the vomiting of formed feces and by the passage of
undigested food by the bowel (Abercrombie).Enemata may be vomited, so
that, as suggested by Murchison, the introduction of  enemata
may aid in the diagnosis.Gastro-cutaneous fistulae are among the rare results of perforation of
gastric ulcer.In these cases food, sometimes only in liquid form,
escapes through the fistula.The opening of gastric ulcer into the pericardium is one of the rare
causes of pneumo-pericardium.Other varieties of perforation which are of pathological rather than of
clinical interest will be mentioned under the morbid anatomy of gastric
ulcer.COURSE.--Few diseases are more variable in their course and duration
than is simple gastric ulcer.It is customary to distinguish between
acute and chronic forms of gastric ulcer, but this is a distinction
which cannot be sharply drawn.Those cases are called acute in which,
with absence or short duration of antecedent gastric symptoms,
perforation or gastrorrhagia suddenly causes death.But in some of
these cases the thickened and indurated margins of the ulcer found at
the autopsy show that the disease has been of much longer duration than
the clinical history would indicate.Still, there is reason to believe
that within the course of a few days ulcers may form and perforate all
of the coats of the stomach.In the great majority of cases of gastric ulcer the tendency is to
assume a chronic course, so that the often-used term chronic gastric
ulcer is generally applicable.{501} The great diversity of the symptoms in different cases makes it
impossible to give a generally applicable description of the course of
gastric ulcer.It is, however, useful to designate the main clinical
forms of the disease.Latent ulcers, with entire absence of symptoms, and revealed as open
ulcers or as cicatrices at the autopsy.With or without a period of brief gastric
disturbance perforation occurs and causes speedy death.Acute hemorrhagic form of gastric ulcer.After a latent or a brief
course of the ulcer profuse gastrorrhagia occurs, which may terminate
fatally or may be followed by the symptoms of chronic ulcer.Gastralgic-dyspeptic form.In this, which is the most common form of
gastric ulcer gastralgia, dyspepsia and vomiting are the symptoms.Sometimes one of the symptoms predominates greatly over the others, so
that Lebert distinguishes separately a gastralgic, a dyspeptic, and a
vomitive variety.Gastralgia is the most frequent symptom.Gastrorrhagia is a marked symptom, and
occurs usually in combination with the symptoms just mentioned.This usually corresponds only to the final stage of
one of the preceding forms, but the cachexia may develop so rapidly and
become so marked that the course of the disease closely resembles that
of gastric cancer.In this the symptoms of gastric ulcer disappear, and
then follow intervals, often of considerable duration, in which there
is apparent cure, but the symptoms return, especially after some
indiscretion in the mode of living.This intermittent course may
continue for many years.In these cases it is probable either that
fresh ulcers form or that the cicatrix of an old ulcer becomes
ulcerated.By the formation of cicatricial tissue in and around
the ulcer the pyloric orifice becomes obstructed and the symptoms of
dilatation of the stomach develop.DURATION.--The average duration of gastric ulcer may be said to be from
three to five years, but this estimate is not of great value, on
account of the absence of any regularity in the course and duration of
the disease.In cases of very protracted duration, such as forty years
in a case of Habershon's and thirty-five in one of Brinton's, it is
uncertain whether the symptoms are referable to the persistence of one
ulcer or to the formation of new ulcers, or to sequels resulting from
cicatrization.In 110 cases (44 fatal) analyzed by Lebert[59] the course was latent
until the occurrence of perforation or of profuse hemorrhage in 15 per
cent., the duration was less than one year in 18 per cent., from one to
six years in 46-1/2 per cent., from six to twenty years in 18 per
cent., from twenty to thirty-five years in 2-1/2 per cent.TERMINATIONS.--In the majority of cases gastric ulcer terminates in
recovery.Various gastric disturbances
may, however, follow the cicatrization of gastric ulcer, especially if
the ulcer was large and of long duration.These sequential disturbances
are due to the contraction of the cicatrix, to adhesions between the
stomach and surrounding parts, to deformity of the stomach, and
especially to dilatation of the stomach by cicatricial stenosis of the
pylorus.Hence, {502} gastralgia, dyspepsia, and vomiting may continue
after the ulcer has healed, so that anatomical cure of the ulcer is not
always recovery in the clinical sense.Relapses may occur after
recovery, as those who have once had gastric ulcer are more prone to
the disease than are others.Not infrequently the patient recovers so
far as to be able to attend to the active duties of life, but to avoid
renewed attacks he is always obliged to be very careful as regards his
mode of living.How often gastric ulcer ends in death it is impossible to say.It is
certain that Brinton under-estimates the number of recoveries when he
computes that only one-half of the ulcers cicatrize.Lebert reckons the
mortality from gastric ulcer as 10 per cent., which appears to be too
low an estimate.would be a more correct estimate
of the mortality.The causes of death are perforation, hemorrhage, exhaustion, and
complicating diseases.of the cases of gastric ulcer terminate fatally
by perforation into the peritoneal cavity.Although this estimate can
be considered only approximative, there is little doubt but that the
much larger percentages given by most writers are excessive, and are
referable to the undue frequency with which cases of perforation of
gastric ulcer have been published.Such cases naturally make a strong
impression upon the observer, and are more likely to be published than
those which terminate in other ways.Death from hemorrhage occurs probably in from 3 to 5 per cent.of the
cases of gastric ulcer.[60] In many more cases hemorrhage is an
indirect cause of death by inducing anaemia.Unlike perforation, fatal
hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is more common in males than in
females--more common after than before forty years of age.The average
age at which fatal hemorrhage occurs is given by Brinton as forty-three
and a half years both for males and females.[Footnote 60: In 270 fatal cases of open ulcer from the statistics of
Jaksch, Dittrich, Eppinger, Starcke, Chambers, Habershon, Moore, and
Lebert, I find 27 deaths by hemorrhage.Reckoning three cicatrices to
one ulcer, this would give a percentage of 3-1/3.]In a considerable proportion of the fatal cases exhaustion is the cause
of death.According to Lebert, death from exhaustion occurs in about 4
per cent.The causes of exhaustion are
the pain, hemorrhage, dyspepsia, and vomiting which constitute the
leading symptoms of the disease.Finally, death may be due to some of the complications or sequels of
gastric ulcer.COMPLICATIONS.--Some of the complications of gastric ulcer are directly
referable to the ulcer, others are only remotely related to it, and
others are merely accidental.Pylephlebitis is among the most important of the complications directly
referable to the ulcer.This pylephlebitis is usually of the infectious
variety, and leads to abscesses in the liver, sometimes to abscesses in
the spleen and other organs.As has already been mentioned, chronic catarrhal gastritis stands in
close relationship to gastric ulcer.Chronic peritonitis is a rare
complication of gastric ulcer (Moore, Vierordt).Chronic interstitial
gastritis, with contraction of the stomach and thickening of its walls,
was {503} associated with ulcer in a case under my observation.In a
case of ulcer under the care of Owen Rees[61] this condition of the
stomach was associated with chronic deforming peritonitis (thickening,
induration, and contraction of the peritoneum) and ascites, so that the
symptoms during life and the gross appearances after death resembled
cancerous diseases of the peritoneum.Simple ulcer and cancer may occur
together in the same stomach, or cancer may develop in an ulcer or its
cicatrix.Glasser reports a case of phlegmonous gastritis with gastric
ulcer.[62] Extension of inflammation to the pleura without perforation
of the diaphragm sometimes occurs.Fatty degeneration of the heart may
be the result of profound anaemia induced by gastric ulcer.[63] Embolic
pneumonia and broncho-pneumonia are occasional complications.A
moderate degree of cachectic dropsy is not very infrequent in the late
stages of gastric ulcer.Times and Gaz._, April 24, 1869.]Wochenschrift_, 1883, No.[Footnote 63: Shattuck, _Boston Med.Journ._, June, 1880,
vol.Other complications, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, valvular disease
of the heart, general atheroma of the arteries, cirrhosis of the liver,
syphilis, chronic Bright's disease, waxy degenerations, and malaria,
have been considered under the Etiology, and some of them will be
referred to again in connection with the Pathology, of gastric ulcer.In most instances when ulcer is associated with these diseases the
ulcer is secondary.SEQUELAE.--The most important sequelae of gastric ulcer are changes in
the form of the stomach in consequence of adhesions and in consequence
of the formation and contraction of cicatrices.These lesions are most
conveniently described under the Morbid Anatomy.The symptoms of the
most important of these sequels--namely, stenosis of the pylorus with
dilatation of the stomach--will be described in another article.MORBID ANATOMY.--As regards number, simple ulcer of the stomach is
usually single, but occasionally two or more ulcers are present.It is
not uncommon to meet in the same stomach open ulcers and the scars of
healed ulcers.According to Brinton, multiple ulcers are found in about
one-fifth of the cases.In one case O'Rorke found six ulcers on the
anterior wall of the stomach.[64] Berthold mentions a case in which
thirty-four ulcers were found in the same stomach.[65]

[Footnote 64: _Trans.Wollmann mentions the occurrence of over eight simple ulcers in the
same stomach (_Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresb._, 1868, Bd.It is expressly stated that these were
not hemorrhagic erosions, but deep corrosive ulcers.]The usual position of simple gastric ulcer is the posterior wall of the
pyloric portion of the stomach on or near the lesser curvature.Ulcers
of the anterior wall are rare, but they carry a special danger from
their liability to perforate without protective adhesions.The least
frequent seats of ulcer are the greater curvature and the fundus.The table on page 504 gives the situation of 793 ulcers recorded in
hospital statistics:[66] {504}

  Lesser curvature   288 (36.3 per cent.)Posterior wall     235 (29.6    "     )
  Pylorus             95 (12      "     )
  Anterior wall       69 ( 8.7    "     )
  Cardia              50 ( 6.3    "     )
  Fundus              29 ( 3.7    "     )
  Greater curvature   27 ( 3.4    "     )

From this table it is apparent that ulcers occupy the lesser curvature,
the posterior wall, and the pyloric region three and a half times more
frequently than they do the remaining larger segment of the stomach.[Footnote 66: These statistics are collected from the previously-cited
works of Rokitansky, Jaksch, Wrany, Eppinger, Chambers, Habershon,
Steiner, Wollmann, Berthold, Starcke, Lebert, and Moore.So far as noted, most of the ulcers on the posterior wall
were nearer to the lesser curvature than to the greater; those on the
lesser curvature extended more frequently to the posterior than to the
anterior wall.Although not apparent from the table, most of the ulcers
of the lesser curvature and of the posterior wall were in the pyloric
region.So far as possible, cicatrices were excluded.Pylorus and
cardia in the table indicate on or near those parts.]Occasionally two ulcers are seated directly opposite to each other, the
one on the anterior, the other on the posterior, wall of the stomach.The most plausible explanation of this is that the ulcers are caused by
a simultaneous affection of corresponding branches which are given off
symmetrically from the same arterial trunk as it runs along one of the
curvatures of the stomach (Virchow).[67]

[Footnote 67: A. Beer, "Aus dem path.R.
Virchow, etc.," _Wiener med.The ordinary size of the ulcer varies from a half inch to two inches in
diameter.The ulcer may be very minute, as in two cases reported by
Murchison, in each of which a pore-like hole was found leading into a
perforated artery from which fatal hemorrhage had occurred.[68] On the
other hand, the ulcer may attain an enormous size, extending sometimes
from the cardiac to the pyloric orifice and measuring five or six
inches in diameter.[69]

[Footnote 68: Murchison, _Trans.[Footnote 69: In one of Cruveilhier's cases the ulcer was 6-1/2 inches
long and 3-1/3 inches wide.Law describes an ulcer measuring 6 inches
by 3 inches (_Dublin Hosp.The ulcer is usually round or oval in shape.The outline of the ulcer
may become irregular by unequal extension in the periphery, or by the
coalescence of two or more ulcers, or by partial cicatrization.Simple
ulcers, especially when seated near the lesser curvature, have a
tendency to extend transversely to the long axis of the stomach, thus
following the course of the blood-vessels.By this mode of extension,
or more frequently by the coalescence of several ulcers, are formed
girdle ulcers, which more or less completely surround the circumference
of the stomach, oftener in the pyloric region than elsewhere.As the ulcer extends in depth it often destroys each successive layer
of the stomach in less extent than the preceding one, so that the form
of the ulcer is conical or funnel-shaped, with a terrace-like
appearance in its sloping edges.The apex of the truncated cone, which
is directed toward the peritoneum, is often not directly opposite to
the centre of the base or superior surface which occupies the mucous
membrane, so that one side of the cone may be vertical and the other
sloping.In the half of the stomach nearer the lesser curvature the
cone <DW72>s upward, and in the lower half of the stomach it <DW72>s
downward.The usual explanation of its conical shape is that the ulcer
exactly corresponds to the territory supplied by an artery with its
branches.Virchow finds an explanation for the oblique direction of the
funnel in the arrangement of the arteries of the stomach.These, coming
from different sources, run along the curvatures of the stomach, and
there give off symmetrically branches which run obliquely toward the
mucous membrane, so that one of these {505} branches with its
distributive twigs (arterial tree) would supply a part shaped like an
oblique funnel.One of the chief supports of the theory which refers
the origin of simple gastric ulcer to an arrest of the circulation is
this correspondence in shape of the ulcer to the area of distribution
of the branches of the arteries supplying the stomach.All ulcers do not present the conical form and terraced edges which
have been described.These appearances are far from constant in fresh
ulcers, and they are usually absent in those of long duration.The most characteristic anatomical feature of simple ulcer of the
stomach is the appearance of the edges and of the floor of the ulcer.The edges of recently-formed ulcers (acute ulcers) are clean-cut,
smooth, and not swollen.To use Rokitansky's well-known comparison, the
hole in the mucous coat looks as if it had been punched out by an
instrument.The floor of the ulcer may be smooth and firm or soft and
pulpy.The floor and edges of fresh ulcers are often infiltrated with
blood, but they may be of a pale-grayish color.Usually no granulations
and no pus are to be seen on the surface of the ulcer.[70] In ulcers of
longer duration the margins become thickened, indurated, and abrupt;
the floor acquires a dense fibrous structure.[Footnote 70: In rare instances granulations may be present, as in a
case of W. Muller's, in which their presence rendered difficult the
diagnosis of simple ulcer from carcinoma (_Jenaische Zeitschrift_, v.,
1870).The microscope may also be required to distinguish the
irregularly thickened margins of old ulcers from scirrhous cancer.]The floor of the ulcer may be the submucous, the muscular, or the
serous coat, or, if the whole thickness of the stomach be perforated,
it may be some adjacent organ to which the stomach has become adherent,
this organ being usually the pancreas or the left lobe of the liver or
neighboring lymphatic glands.The microscopic examination of recently-formed ulcers shows that the
tissue immediately surrounding the ulcer is composed of granular
material, disintegrated red blood-corpuscles, pale and swollen
fragments of connective-tissue fibres, and cells unaffected by
nuclear-staining dyes.The red blood-corpuscles are sometimes broken
into fragments of various sizes in about the same way as by the action
of heat.The gastric tubules are separated from each other and
compressed by infiltrated blood, and contain cells which do not stain.Around this margin of molecular disintegration, which has evidently
been produced by the action of the gastric juice, there is often,
although not constantly, a zone of infiltration with small round cells,
probably emigrated white blood-corpuscles.These cells are most
abundant near the muscularis mucosae and in the submucosa.Extravasated
red blood-corpuscles extend a variable distance around the ulcer,
farthest as a rule in the submucous coat.Many of the blood-vessels in
the immediate neighborhood of the ulcer appear normal; others,
particularly the arterioles and the capillaries, may be filled with
hyaline thrombi.Clumps of hyaline material may also be seen in the
meshes of the tissue around the ulcer.Fine fatty granules may be seen
in the tissue near the ulcer.The interstices of the loose submucous
tissue and the lymphatic vessels are often filled with fibrillated
fibrin and scattered blood-corpuscles for a considerable distance
around the ulcer.In the margins of old gastric ulcers there is also a zone of molecular
necrosis.The induration and the thickening of the edges of these
ulcers {506} are caused by a new growth of fibrillated connective
tissue, which blends together all of the coats invaded by the ulcer.This new tissue is usually rich in lymphoid cells, which are often most
abundant in the lymphatic channels.In the fibrous edges and base of
old ulcers are arteries which are the seat of an obliterating
endarteritis, and which may be completely obliterated by this process.An interstitial neuritis may affect the nerve-trunks involved in the
fibrous growth.Blood-pigment may be present as an evidence of an old
hemorrhagic infiltration.[71]

[Footnote 71: The histological changes here described are based upon
the examination of typical specimens both of recent and of old gastric
ulcers which have come under my observation.]Cicatrization is accomplished by the development of fibrous tissue in
the floor and borders of the ulcer.By the contraction of this
new-formed tissue the edges of the mucous membrane are united to the
floor of the ulcer, and may be drawn together so as to close completely
the defect in the mucous membrane.The result is a white stellate
cicatrix, which is usually somewhat depressed and surrounded by
puckered mucous membrane.It is probable that small, superficial ulcers
may be closed so that the scar cannot be detected.The mucous membrane
which has been drawn over the cicatrix is intimately blended with the
fibrous substratum, and is usually itself invaded by fibrous tissue
which compresses and distorts the gastric tubules.Hauser[72] has shown
that the tubular glands grow down into the cicatricial tissue, where
they may branch in all directions.These new-formed tubules are lined
by clear cylindrical or cutical epithelial cells, and may undergo
cystic dilatation.Very irregular cicatrices may result from the
healing of large and irregular ulcers.When the ulcer is large and deep
and the stomach is adherent to surrounding parts, the edges of the
mucous membrane making the border of the ulcer cannot be united by the
contraction of the fibrous tissue in the floor of the ulcer.The
cicatrix of such ulcers consists of fibrous tissue uncovered by mucous
membrane.Such cicatrices are
liable to be the seat of renewed ulceration.[Footnote 72: _Das chronische Magengeschwur, etc._, Leipzig, 1883.In
the rare instances of carcinoma developing in the borders or in the
cicatrix of gastric ulcer, Hauser believes that the cancerous growth
starts from these glandular growths, which in general have only the
significance of Friedlander's atypical proliferation of epithelial
cells.]The formation and contraction of the cicatrix may cause various
deformities of the stomach.The character of these deformities depends
upon the situation, the size, and the depth of the ulcer which is
cicatrized.Among the most important of these distortions are stenosis
of the pyloric orifice, followed by dilatation of the stomach, more
rarely stenosis of the cardiac orifice, with contraction of the
stomach, approximation of the cardiac and of the pyloric orifices by
the healing of ulcers on the lesser curvature, and an hour-glass form
of the stomach, produced by the cicatrization of girdle ulcers or of a
series of ulcers extending around the stomach.These abnormalities in
form of the stomach, particularly the constriction of the orifices, may
be attended by more serious symptoms than the original ulcer.As the ulcer extends in depth a circumscribed peritonitis, resulting in
the formation of adhesions between the stomach and surrounding parts,
is usually excited before the serous coat is perforated, so that the
gravest of all possible accidents in the course of gastric
ulcer--namely, perforation {507} into the peritoneal sac--is
permanently or temporarily averted.It has been estimated that
adhesions form in about two-fifths of all cases of gastric ulcer
(Jaksch).On account of the usual position of the ulcer on the lesser
curvature or on the posterior wall of the stomach, the adhesions are
most frequently with the pancreas (in about one-half of all cases of
adhesion); next in frequency with the left lobe of the liver; rarely
with other parts, such as the lymphatic glands, the diaphragm, the
spleen, the kidney, the suprarenal capsule, the omentum, the colon, and
other parts of the intestine, the gall-bladder, the sternum, and the
anterior abdominal wall.Adhesions cannot readily form between the
anterior surface of the stomach and the anterior abdominal wall, on
account of the constant movement of these parts, so that ulcers of the
anterior gastric wall are those most liable to perforate into the
peritoneal cavity.It is difficult to include in any description all of the various and
complicated lesions which may result from perforation by gastric ulcer
of all of the coats of the stomach.The consequences of perforation may
be conveniently classified as follows:

1.Some solid organ, usually the pancreas, the liver, or the lymphatic
glands, may close the hole in the stomach.An intra-peritoneal sac shut in by adhesions may communicate through
the ulcer with the cavity of the stomach.A fistulous communication may form either between the stomach and
the exterior (external gastric fistula) or between the stomach and some
hollow viscus (internal gastric fistula).The ulcer may perforate into the general peritoneal cavity.These lesions may be variously combined with each other.It is to be
noted that in the first three varieties protective adhesions are
present, and that in the last these adhesions are either absent or
ruptured.When the pancreas, the liver, or the spleen form the floor of the
ulcer, they may be protected from extension of the ulcerative process
by a new growth of fibrous tissue extending from the floor of the ulcer
a variable depth into these organs.Sometimes, however, the ulcerative
process, aided doubtless by the corroding action of the gastric juice,
eats out large excavations in these organs.These excavations
communicate with the cavity of the stomach, and are usually filled with
ichorous pus.The pancreas, unlike the spleen and the liver, possesses
comparative immunity against this invasion by the ulcerative process.The situation, the form, and the extent of circumscribed peritoneal
abscesses resulting from perforation of gastric ulcer depend upon the
parts with which the stomach has contracted adhesions.Should an ulcer
on the posterior wall of the stomach perforate before the formation of
adhesions, the perforation would of course be directly into the lesser
peritoneal cavity.An interesting example of this rare occurrence has
been communicated by Chiari.[73] In this case, the foramen of Winslow
being closed by adhesions, the lesser peritoneal cavity which
communicated with a gastric ulcer was filled with ichorous pus, and in
this floated the pancreas, which had necrosed in mass and had separated
as a sequestrum.That form of intra-peritoneal abscess known as
subphrenic pneumo-pyothorax has been already described under
Symptomatology.Peritoneal abscesses communicating with the stomach may
open into various places, {508} as into the general peritoneal cavity,
into the pleural cavity, into the retro-peritoneal tissue, through the
abdominal or thoracic walls, etc.Wochenschr._, 1876, No.Gastro-cutaneous fistulae are a rare result of the perforation of
gastric ulcer.[74] The external opening is most frequently in the
umbilical region, but it may be in the epigastric or in the left
hypochondriac region or between the ribs.Fistulous communications
resulting from the perforation of gastric ulcer have been formed
between the stomach and one or more of the following hollow viscera or
cavities: the colon, the duodenum and other parts of the small
intestine, the gall-bladder, the common bile-duct, the pancreatic duct,
the pleura, the lung, the left bronchus, the pericardium, and the left
ventricle.Gastro-colic fistulae, in contrast to gastro-cutaneous
fistulae, are more frequently produced by cancer than by ulcer of the
stomach.[75] In rare instances the peritoneum over ulcers of the lesser
curvature has contracted adhesions with the pyloric portion of the
stomach or with the first part of the duodenum.To accomplish this it
is necessary that a sharp bend in the lesser curvature should take
place.By extension of the ulcerative process abnormal communication is
established between the left and the right half of the stomach or
between the stomach and the duodenum.In either case the right half of
the stomach is often converted into a large blind diverticulum, the
digested food passing through the abnormal opening.[76] Gastro-duodenal
fistulae are more frequently with the third than with the first part of
the duodenum.In one of Starcke's cases the stomach communicated with
the colon and through the medium of a subphrenic abscess with the left
lung.[77]

[Footnote 74: Of the 25 cases of gastro-cutaneous fistula collected by
Murchison, 18 were the result of disease.In 12 of these cases the
probable cause was simple gastric ulcer (_Med.-Chir.Middeldorpf says that among the internal causes
of the 47 cases of external gastric fistula which he tabulated, simple
ulcer of the stomach played an important role (_Wiener med.Wochenschr._, 1860).][Footnote 75: Of 33 cases of gastro-colic fistula collected by
Murchison, 21 were from gastric cancer and 9 or 10 probably from simple
ulcer.On the other hand, gastro-cutaneous fistulae are twice as
frequently the result of simple ulcer as of cancer (_Edinb.[Footnote 76: Thierfelder has made the best study of the complicated
relations existing in these cases (_Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 77: _Deutsche Klinik_, 1870, No.Habershon also reports a
case in which a subphrenic abscess communicated with the lung, the

with the production of pneumo-pericardium, have been reported, and two
cases of perforation into the left ventricle.[79] Muller found
lumbricoid worms in a pleural cavity which had been perforated by
gastric ulcer.[80] Diaphragmatic hernia may result from perforation of
the pleural cavity by gastric ulcer.[81] In one instance the greater
part of the small intestines {509} passed through a hole in the
transverse meso-colon which had been caused by a gastric ulcer.[Footnote 78: Hallin, _Schmidt's Jahrb._, cxix.37; Saxinger,

Gunsburg's the hole in the diaphragm was as large as the hand, and the
left pleural cavity contained the upper half of the stomach and the
spleen (_Arch.The various fistulae which have been mentioned may be either direct or
through the medium of an abscess.While some of them are only
pathological curiosities, others, particularly the communications of
the stomach with the pleural cavity and with the lung, are sufficiently
frequent to be of practical clinical interest.As has already been explained, ulcers of the anterior wall are the ones
most liable to perforate into the general peritoneal cavity,[82] but on
account of their comparative infrequency perforation occurs oftener in
other situations, particularly in the lesser curvature and near the
pylorus.Except on the anterior wall the perforation is often brought
about by the rupture of adhesions which for a time had prevented this
accident.In a considerable number of cases, particularly of ulcers on
the anterior wall, the ulcer looks as if recently formed (acute
perforating ulcer); in other cases its thickened and indurated margins
indicate long duration.Chiari[83] describes a case in which rupture
into the peritoneal cavity took place through the cicatrix of an old
ulcer, probably in consequence of the distension of the stomach with
gas.The hole in the peritoneum is usually circular, smaller than the
inner surface of the ulcer, and has sharp, well-defined edges.Less
frequently the edges are ragged.Post-mortem digestion may, however, so
change the borders of the opening as to make it difficult or impossible
to tell from their post-mortem appearances alone whether perforation
has occurred before or after death.The peritoneal cavity after death
from perforation is found to contain gas and substances from the
stomach.Usually within a few hours after perforation septic
peritonitis is excited, but in exceptional cases no inflammation of the
peritoneum has occurred even when life has been prolonged twenty-four
hours after perforation.[Footnote 82: According to Brinton, "the proportion of perforations to
ulcers is such that of every 100 ulcers in each of the following
situations, the numbers which perforate are--on the posterior surface,
about 2; the pyloric sac, 10; the middle of the organ, 13; the lesser
curvature, 18; the anterior and posterior surface at once, 28; the
cardiac extremity, 40; and the anterior surface, 85."]Emphysema of the subcutaneous, subperitoneal, and other loose areolar
tissue of the body is a rare but remarkable result of the perforation
of gastric ulcer.The emphysema is sometimes observed shortly before
death, but it attains its maximum development after death, when it may
spread rapidly over the greater part of the body.The gas consists in
part of hydrogen, as it burns with a blue flame.It is generated, at
least in great part, by fermentation of the contents of the stomach.The gas may enter the subserous tissue at the edges of the ulcer and
thence spread, or, after perforation of the stomach, it may make its
way from the peritoneal cavity into the loose subserous connective
tissue through some place in the parietal peritoneum which has been
macerated, perhaps by the digestive action of the gastric juice.[84]

[Footnote 84: Roger (_Arch.de Med._, 1862) and Demarquay (_Essai
de Pneumatologie medicale_, Paris, 1866) deserve the credit of first
calling general attention to the occurrence of subcutaneous emphysema
after rupture of the digestive tract.The following writers have each
reported a case of emphysema following the perforation of gastric
ulcers: Cruveilhier, _Anat.Path._, t. i. livr.783; Thierfelder, _Deutsches Arch.Med._,
iv., 1868, p.33; Newman, _The Lancet_, 1868, vol.728;
Poensgen, _Das subcutane Emphysem nach continuitatstrennungen des
Digestionstractus, etc._, Inaug.Diss., Strassburg, 1879, p.40;
Korach, _Deutsche med.Wochenschr._, 1880 p.275; {510} Jurgensen,
_Deutsches Arch.Doubtful cases
are reported by Lefevre, W. Mayer, and Burggraeve.The fullest
consideration of the subject is to be found in the dissertation of
Poensgen.]In two cases of sudden death from gastric ulcer Jurgensen found gas in
the veins and arteries of various parts of the body.He believes that
this gas, which certainly was not the result of putrefaction after
death, was derived from the stomach, and that it entered during life
the circulation through vessels exposed in the borders of the ulcer,
thus causing death.In one of the cases a profuse hemorrhage preceded
death, and in the other the ulcer had perforated into the peritoneal
cavity.[85]

[Footnote 85: Jurgensen does not consider whether this gas may not have
made its way into the blood-vessels after death in a manner similar to
its extension through the cellular tissue of the body in the cases of
emphysema just mentioned.In the case which he has reported in full
interstitial and subserous emphysema could be traced from the ulcer
("Luft im Blute," _Deutsches Arch.The source of hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is from blood-vessels
either in the stomach itself or in the neighborhood of the stomach.Hemorrhages slight or of moderate severity occur from the capillaries
and small arteries and veins in the mucous and submucous coats.Sometimes profuse and even fatal hemorrhage comes from arteries or from
veins in the submucous coat, especially when these vessels are dilated.Quickly-fatal hemorrhages take place from the large vessels between the
muscular and the serous coats, particularly from the main trunks on the
curvatures.After the formation of adhesions, followed by the
perforation of all of the coats of the stomach, profuse bleeding may
proceed from the erosion of large vessels near the stomach, such as the
splenic, the hepatic, the pancreatico-duodenal arteries, the portal and
the splenic veins, and the mesenteric vessels.Bleeding may also occur
from vessels in the parenchyma of organs invaded by the ulcer.The most
common source of fatal hemorrhage is from the splenic artery, which
from its position is peculiarly exposed to invasion by ulcers of the
posterior wall of the stomach.The hemorrhage is usually arterial in
origin.It may come from miliary aneurisms of the gastric arteries or
from varicose veins in the wall of the stomach.As Cruveilhier has
pointed out, an ulcer may cicatrize except over one spot corresponding
to an artery from which fatal hemorrhage may occur.Ulcers which give
rise to large hemorrhages are usually chronic in their course.Those
seated on the middle of the anterior wall, although peculiarly liable
to perforate, are comparatively exempt from hemorrhage on account of
the small size of the blood-vessels there.Changes in the blood-vessels of the stomach have been seen in a
considerable number of cases of gastric ulcer.Instances have been
recorded of the association with gastric ulcer of most of the diseases
to which blood-vessels are subject.An example in all respects
convincing of embolism of the artery supplying the ulcerated region of
the stomach has not been published.Probably the best case belonging
here is one of perforating ulcer of the stomach with hemorrhagic
infiltration in its walls, presented by Janeway to the New York
Pathological Society in 1871.[86] In this case there was in the
gastro-epiploic artery an ante-mortem fibrinous plug which was
continued into the nutrient artery of the ulcerated piece of the
stomach.No source for an embolus could be found.In one case Merkel
found an embolus in a small artery leading to an ulcer {511} of the
duodenum.[87] The arch of the aorta was atheromatous and contained a
thrombus.Patches of hemorrhagic infiltration existed in the stomach.In many cases thrombosis of the arteries, and especially of the veins
involved in the diseased tissue around an ulcer, has been observed, and
in some the thrombus was prolonged in the vessels for a considerable
distance from the ulcer.It is probable that in most of these cases the
thrombus was secondary to the ulcer.Hyaline thrombosis of the
capillaries near the ulcer is also to be mentioned.In a certain, but not large, number of cases atheroma with
calcification or with fatty degeneration of the arteries of the stomach
has been found associated with gastric ulcer.[88] Reference has already
been made to the occurrence of obliterating endarteritis in the
thickened edges and floor of gastric ulcer, where it is doubtless
secondary.In one case of gastric ulcer I found a widespread
obliterating endarteritis affecting small and medium-sized arteries in
many parts of the body, including the stomach.[89]

[Footnote 88: For cases in point see Norman Moore, _Trans.[Footnote 89: On the posterior wall of the stomach, midway between the
greater and the lesser curvature and five inches to the right of the
cardiac orifice, was a round ulcer half an inch in diameter, with
smooth, sharp edges.In the floor of the ulcer, which extended to the
muscular coat, was a small perforated aneurism of a branch of the
coronary artery.In addition there were small, granular kidneys,
hypertrophied heart without valvular lesion, and chronic interstitial
splenitis.Small and medium-sized arteries in the kidneys, spleen,
heart, lymphatic glands, and stomach were the seat of a typical
endarteritis obliterans, resulting in some instances in complete
closure of the lumen of the vessel.The patient, who was attended by
Sassdorf, was seized during the night with vomiting of blood, which
continued at intervals for twenty-four hours until his death.The
patient was a man about fifty years of age, without previous history of
gastric ulcer or of syphilis.]In one case Powell[90] found a small aneurism of the coronary artery in
an ulcer of the lesser curvature of the stomach.Hauser[91] found an
aneurismal dilatation of an atheromatous and thrombosed arterial twig
in the floor of a recent ulcer.In my case of obliterating endarteritis
just referred to there was a small aneurism in the floor of the ulcer.These miliary aneurisms in the floor of gastric ulcers seem to be
analogous to those in the walls of phthisical cavities.Miliary
aneurisms occur in the stomach independently of gastric ulcer, and may
give rise to fatal haematemesis, as in four cases reported by
Galliard.[92]

[Footnote 90: _Trans.[Footnote 91: _Das chronische Magengeschwur, etc._, p.11, Leipzig,
1883.][Footnote 92: _L'Union med._, Feb.Curtis reported a case of
fatal haematemesis from an aneurism, not larger than a small pea,
seated in the cicatrix of an old ulcer (_Med.Annals of Albany_, Aug.,
1880).]Gastric ulcer is occasionally associated with waxy degeneration of the
arteries of the stomach.[93] In most of these cases there were multiple
shallow ulcers.Haematemesis is generally absent in gastric ulcer
resulting from waxy disease of the gastric blood-vessels.As is well
known, the amyloid material itself resists the action of the gastric
juice.cit._) alludes to a case in which, with waxy
degeneration of the stomach, over one hundred small ulcers were found
in different stages of development, from hemorrhagic infiltrations to
complete ulcers.Cases belonging here are reported by Fehr, _Ueber die
Amyloide Degeneration_, Inaug.Diss., Bern, 1866; Merkel, _Wiener med.Presse_, 1869; Edinger, _Deutsches Arch.568; Marchiafava, _Atti del Accad.114; and
Mattei, _Deutsche med.Zeitung_, July 5, 1883.]Finally, varicosities of the veins of the stomach have been once in a
{512} while found with gastric ulcer.In a large number, probably in
the majority, of cases of gastric ulcer no changes have been found in
the blood-vessels of the stomach except such as were manifestly
secondary to the ulcer.That gastric ulcer is frequently complicated with chronic catarrhal
gastritis has been repeatedly mentioned in the course of this article.PATHOGENESIS.--Without doubt, the most obscure chapter in the history
of gastric ulcer is that relating to its origin and to its persistence.Notwithstanding a vast amount of investigation and of discussion,
unanimity of opinion upon these subjects has not been reached.In view
of this uncertainty it is desirable in this article to do little more
than to summarize the leading theories as to the development of gastric
ulcer.Most observers are agreed that the digestive action of the gastric
juice has some share in the development and the progress of the ulcer,
but as to the first cause of the ulcer there are various hypotheses.The earliest theory refers the origin of simple ulcer of the stomach to
inflammation.Since its advocacy by Abercrombie and by Cruveilhier this
theory has always had its adherents, particularly among French writers.It is true that in stomachs which are the seat of simple ulcer
evidences of inflammation can often be found both in the neighborhood
of the ulcer and elsewhere.In recent times the supporters of the
inflammatory origin of gastric ulcer lay especial stress upon the
presence of foci of infiltration with small round cells in the mucous
and the submucous coats.[94] But it is difficult to explain by the
inflammatory theory the usually solitary occurrence and the funnel-like
shape of gastric ulcer.[Footnote 94: Laveran, _Arch.443;
Galliard, _Essai sur la Pathogenie de l'Ulcere simple de l'Estomac_,
These de Paris, 1882; Colombo, _Annali univ.The theory that gastric ulcer is of neurotic origin has also been
advocated.Some refer the origin to the secretion of an excessively
acid gastric juice under abnormal nervous influence (Gunsburg), others
to vaso-motor disturbances, and others to trophic disturbances.Wilks
and Moxon compare simple gastric ulcer to ulcers of the cornea
resulting from paralysis of the trigeminus.The neurotic theory of the
origin of gastric ulcer is altogether speculative and has never gained
wide acceptance.[95]

[Footnote 95: The first to attribute gastric ulcer to nervous influence
was Siebert (_Casper's Wochenschr.f. d. Heilk._, 1842, No.29, and
_Deutsche Klinik_, 1852).Heilk._,
xi., 1852; Wilks and Moxon, _Lect.Anat._, 2d ed., Philada.,
1875, p.Osborne in 1845 attributed gastric ulcer to the secretion
of an abnormally acid juice by a circular group of the gastric glands
(_Dublin Journ.The view which has met with the greatest favor is that which attributes
the origin of gastric ulcer to impairment or arrest of the circulation
in a circumscribed part of the wall of the stomach, and to a subsequent
solution by the gastric juice of the part thus affected.Rokitansky
first suggested this view by assigning hemorrhagic necrosis of the
mucous membrane as the first step in the formation of the ulcer; but it
is Virchow who has most fully developed this view and has given it its
main support.The first cause of gastric ulcer, according to Virchow,
is a hemorrhagic infiltration of the coats of the stomach induced by
local disturbances in the circulation.The part the nutrition of which
is thus impaired or destroyed is dissolved by the gastric juice.{513} The affections of the gastric blood-vessels to which importance
has been attached are (_a_) embolism and thrombosis; (_b_) diseases of
the coats of the vessels, as atheroma, obliterating endarteritis, fatty
degeneration, amyloid degeneration, and aneurismal and varicose
dilatations; (_c_) compression of the veins by spasm of the muscular
coats of the stomach in vomiting and in gastralgia; (_d_) passive
congestion of the stomach by obstruction in the portal circulation.In support of this view are urged the following facts: First, it has
been proven by the experiments of Pavy that parts of the gastric wall
from which the circulation has been shut off undergo digestion; second,
hemorrhagic infarctions have been observed in the stomach, both alone
(Von Recklinghausen, Hedenius) and associated with gastric ulcer (Key,
Rindfleisch); third, the hemorrhagic infiltration in the walls of
recently-formed ulcers indicates a hemorrhagic origin; fourth, the
funnel-like shape of the ulcer resembles the funnel-shaped area of
distribution of an artery; fifth, gastric ulcers have been
experimentally produced by injecting emboli into the gastric arteries
(Panum, Cohnheim).[96]

[Footnote 96: Pavy, _Philosoph.161; V.
Recklinghausen, _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.368; Axel Key, _Virchow
und Hirsch's Jahresb._, 1870, Bd.155; Rindfleisch, _Lehrb.Gewebelehre_, 5te Aufl., Leipzig, 1878; Panum, _Virchow's
Archiv_, Bd.491; Cohnheim, _Vorles.The main objections to this view are the infrequency with which the
assumed changes in the blood-vessels have been demonstrated, the common
occurrence of gastric ulcer at an age earlier than that at which
diseases of the blood-vessels are usually present, and the absence of
gastric ulcer in the vast majority of cases of heart disease, with
widespread embolism of different organs of the body.To meet some of
these objections, Klebs[97] presupposes in many cases a local spasmodic
contraction of the gastric arteries, causing temporary interruption of
the circulation; Rindfleisch and Axel Key, compression of the gastric
veins, with resulting hemorrhagic infiltration by spasm of the muscular
coat of the stomach in vomiting and in gastralgic attacks.What is actually known concerning diseases of the gastric blood-vessels
in ulcer of the stomach has already been stated under the morbid
anatomy.From this it may be inferred that the origin of gastric ulcer
in diseased conditions of the blood-vessels has been established only
for a comparatively small group of cases.Bottcher's[98] view that gastric ulcer is of mycotic origin, being
produced by micrococci, has thus far met with no confirmation.[Footnote 98: _Dorpater med.There are those who hold an eclectic view concerning the origin of
gastric ulcer.They believe that ulcer of the stomach may be produced
by a variety of causes, such as inflammation, circulatory disturbances,
irritating substances introduced into the stomach, traumatism, etc.The
peculiarities of the ulcer are due not to any specific cause, but to
the solvent action of the gastric juice, which keeps clean the floor
and the sides of the ulcer.These clean edges and floor, which are
incident to all ulcers of the stomach, justify no conclusion as to the
cause of the ulcer.Engel[99] over thirty years ago held that gastric
ulcer might {514} originate in various ways--that there was nothing
specific about it.[Footnote 99: _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, 1853, ii.]Gastric ulcers have been produced experimentally in animals in a
variety of ways, but these experiments have not materially elucidated
the pathenogenesis of ulcer in man.Schiff by lesions of various parts
of the brain, and later Ebstein by lesions of many parts of the central
and peripheral nervous system by injections of strychnine--in fact,
apparently by any means which greatly increased the
blood-pressure--produced in the stomachs of animals ecchymoses and
ulcers.Muller by ligation of the portal vein, Pavy by ligation of
arteries supplying the stomach, likewise produced hemorrhages and
ulcers.The results of Pavy could not be confirmed by Roth and others.Panum, and afterward Cohnheim, produced gastric ulcers by introducing
multiple emboli into the gastric arteries.Daettwyler under Quincke's
direction caused, in dogs with gastric fistulae, ulcers of the stomach
by various mechanical, chemical, and thermic irritants applied to the
inner surface of the stomach.Aufrecht observed hemorrhages and ulcers
in the stomachs of rabbits after subcutaneous injections of
cantharidin.[100]

_Centralbl.The most interesting of these experiments are those of Cohnheim and of
Daettwyler, who demonstrated that in one essential point all of these
experimental ulcers differ from simple gastric ulcer in man--namely, in
the readiness with which they heal.To this ready healing the gastric
juice, much as it has been accused of causing the spread of gastric
ulcers in man, seems to have offered no obstacle.We know that similar
losses of substance in the human stomach heal equally well.[101] Hence
it has been maintained throughout this article that it is unjustifiable
to regard all of the scars found in the human stomach as the result of
simple ulcer.[Footnote 101: Portions of the mucous membrane of the stomach,
sometimes with some of the submucous coat, have been in several
instances removed with the stomach-pump, but thus far no bad effects
have followed.]It appears from these experiments, as well as from observations on man,
that it is more difficult to explain why ulcers in the stomach do not
heal than it is to understand how they may be produced.From this point
of view the observation of Daettwyler is of interest, that in dogs
which had been rendered anaemic by repeated abstraction of blood not
only did slighter irritants suffice to produce ulcers of the stomach,
but the ulcers healed much more slowly.Practically, it is important to
learn what are the obstacles to the repair of gastric ulcers, but our
positive knowledge of these is slight.It is probable that such
obstacles are to be found in constitutional causes, such as anaemia and
chlorosis, in abnormal states of the blood-vessels around the ulcer, in
catarrhal affections of the stomach, in irritating articles of food, in
improper modes of living, and in increased acidity of the gastric
juice.DIAGNOSIS.--In many cases the diagnosis of gastric ulcer can be made
with reasonable certainty; in other cases the diagnosis amounts only to
a suspicion more or less strong, and in still other cases the diagnosis
is impossible.{515} The diagnostic symptoms are epigastric pain, vomiting, and
gastric hemorrhage.The characteristics of the pain which aid in the
diagnosis are its fixation in one spot in the epigastric region, its
onset soon after eating, its dependence upon the quantity and the
quality of the food, its relief upon the complete expulsion of the
contents of the stomach, its alleviation by changes in posture, and its
increase by pressure.That the pain of gastric ulcer has not always
these characteristics has been mentioned under the Symptomatology.Vomiting without haematemesis is the least characteristic of these
symptoms.It aids in the diagnosis when it occurs after eating at the
acme of a gastralgic attack and is followed by the relief of pain.Haematemesis is the most valuable symptom in diagnosis.The more
profuse the hemorrhage and the younger the individual in whom it
occurs, the greater is the probability of gastric ulcer.It should not
be forgotten that the blood is sometimes discharged solely by the
stools.The simultaneous occurrence of all these symptoms renders the diagnosis
of gastric ulcer easy.[102] In all cases in which gastrorrhagia is
absent the diagnosis is uncertain; but gastric ulcer should be
suspected whenever the ingestion of food is followed persistently by
severe epigastric pain and other causes of the pain have not been
positively determined.When the course of the ulcer is latent and when
the symptoms are only those of dyspepsia, the diagnosis is of course
impossible.In cases previously obscure a diagnosis in extremis is
sometimes made possible by the occurrence of perforation of the
stomach.[Footnote 102: That even under the most favorable circumstances
absolute certainty in the diagnosis of gastric ulcer is not reached is
illustrated by a case reported with great precision and fulness by
Banti: A female servant, twenty-one years old, had every symptom of
gastric ulcer, including repeated haematemesis and the characteristic
epigastric pain.She died from an
ulcerative proctitis four days after the last hemorrhage from the
stomach.Only a slight catarrhal inflammation of the stomach was found
at the autopsy, without trace of ulcer, cicatrix, or ecchymosis ("Di un
Caso d'Ematemesi," _La Sperimentale_, Feb., 1880, p.It would
seem as if there must have been an ulcer which had healed so completely
as to leave no recognizable scar.]In making a differential diagnosis of gastric ulcer, as well as of any
disease, reliance should be placed more upon the whole complexion of
the case than upon any fancied pathognomonic symptoms.The diseases which are most difficult to distinguish from gastric ulcer
are nervous affections of the stomach.Like gastric ulcer, most of
these are more common in women than in men, and especially in chlorotic
women with disordered menstruation and with hysterical manifestations.These nervous affections are manifold and their leading characteristics
are not yet well defined.The most important of these affections are
nervous dyspepsia, nervous vomiting, nervous gastralgia, and gastric
crises.The leading symptoms of nervous dyspepsia, as described by Leube,[103]
are the ordinary symptoms of dyspepsia without evidence of anatomical
alteration of the stomach, and with the proof by washing out the
stomach that the process of digestion is not delayed.Nervous dyspepsia
is often associated with other nervous affections, and is caused
especially by influences which depress the nervous system.Epigastric
pain, and especially tenderness on pressure over the stomach, are not
common symptoms in nervous dyspepsia.Only those rare cases of gastric
ulcer in which hemorrhage from the stomach is absent and epigastric
pain is not prominent {516} are likely to be confounded with nervous
dyspepsia.In such cases, although the diagnosis of nervous dyspepsia
is by far the most probable, the patient may be confined to bed and put
upon the strict regimen for gastric ulcer.If in the course of ten days
or two weeks essential relief is not obtained, ulcer may be excluded,
and the proper treatment for nervous dyspepsia with tonics and
electricity may be adopted (Leube).[Footnote 103: _Deutches Arch.In nervous vomiting, which occurs most frequently in hysterical women,
other nervous manifestations are present; there are usually less
epigastric pain and tenderness than in ulcer; the nutrition is better
preserved; the vomiting is less dependent upon the ingestion of food
and more dependent on mental states; and there are longer intervals of
relief than in ulcer.Still, it may be necessary to resort to the
therapeutical diagnosis as in the preceding instance.In this connection attention may be called to the importance of
searching for reflex causes of vomiting, such as beginning phthisis,
ovarian or uterine disease, cerebral disease, and pregnancy; also to
certain cases of chronic Bright's disease in which gastric disturbances
are the main symptoms.Of all the nervous affections of the stomach, nervous gastralgia is the
one which presents the greatest similarity to gastric ulcer.Its
diagnosis from gastric ulcer is often extremely difficult, and may be
impossible.The points of difference given in the following table may
aid in the diagnosis:

elevated in gastric ulcer, but not in nervous gastralgia.Probably not a single one of the points mentioned in the table is
without exception.Nervous gastralgia may be associated with gastric
ulcer, and if the ulcer is otherwise latent the diagnosis is manifestly
impossible.A diagnosis of purely functional gastralgia has been
repeatedly overthrown by the occurrence of profuse haematemesis.There
is no symptom {517} upon which it is more unsatisfactory to base a
diagnosis than upon pain.There is much difference among physicians as
regards the frequency with which they diagnose gastric ulcer in the
class of cases here described.It is probable that the error is
oftenest a too frequent diagnosis of gastric ulcer than the reverse.Nevertheless, when there is doubt it is well to submit the patient for
a time to the proper treatment for gastric ulcer.In several instances gastric crises have been mistaken for gastric
ulcer.These gastric or gastralgic crises, as they are called by
Charcot, by whom they have been best described,[105] are most
frequently associated with locomotor ataxia, but they may occur in
connection with other diseases of the spinal cord (subacute myelitis,
general spinal paralysis, and disseminated sclerosis), and an analogous
affection has been described by Leyden[106] as an independent disease
under the name of periodical vomiting with severe gastralgic attacks.Gastric crises have been most carefully studied as a symptom in the
prodromic stage of locomotor ataxia.The distinguishing features of
these crises are the sudden onset and the atrocious severity of the
gastric pain; the simultaneous occurrence of almost incessant vomiting;
the habitual continuance of the paroxysms, almost without remission,
for two or three days; the normal performance of the gastric functions
in the intervals between the paroxysms, which may be months apart; the
frequent association with other prodromic symptoms of locomotor ataxia,
such as ocular disorders and fulgurating pains in the extremities; and
the development after a time of ataxia.Leyden has observed during the
attacks retraction of the abdomen without tension of the abdominal
walls, obstinate constipation, scanty, dark- urine, even anuria
for twenty-four hours, and increased frequency of the pulse (also noted
by Charcot).Vulpian[107] mentions a case in which there was vomiting
of dark- blood, and in which naturally the diagnosis of gastric
ulcer had been made.In the autopsies of Leyden and of Charcot no
lesions of the stomach have been found.[Footnote 107: _Maladies du Syst.The differential diagnosis of gastric ulcer from gastric cancer will be
considered in the article on GASTRIC CANCER.It has already been said that a part of the symptoms of gastric ulcer
are due to an associated chronic catarrhal gastritis.Usually other
symptoms are present which render possible the diagnosis of the ulcer.There is usually some apparent external or internal cause of chronic
catarrhal gastritis, whereas the etiology of ulcer is obscure; in
chronic gastritis gastralgic paroxysms and the peculiar fixed
epigastric pain of gastric ulcer are usually absent; in chronic
gastritis profuse haematemesis is a rare occurrence; and in gastritis
the relief obtained by rest and proper regulation of the diet, although
manifest, is usually less immediate and striking than in most cases of
gastric ulcer.The passage of gall-stones is usually sufficiently distinguished from
gastric ulcer by the sudden onset and the sudden termination of the
pain, by the situation of the pain to the right of the median line, by
the complete relief in the intervals between the attacks, by the
occurrence of jaundice, by the recognition sometimes of enlargement of
the liver and of the gall-bladder, and by the detection of gall-stones
in the feces.{518} There is not much danger of confounding abdominal aneurism and
lead colic with gastric ulcer, and the points in their differential
diagnosis are sufficiently apparent to require no description here.The
diagnosis of duodenal ulcer from gastric ulcer will be discussed
elsewhere.The different causes of gastric hemorrhage, a knowledge of
which is essential to the diagnosis of gastric ulcer, will be
considered in the article on HEMORRHAGE FROM THE STOMACH.PROGNOSIS.--Although a decided majority of simple ulcers of the stomach
cicatrize, nevertheless, in view of the frequently insidious course of
the disease, the sudden perforations, the grave hemorrhages, the
relapses, and the sequels of the disease, the prognosis must be
pronounced serious.The earlier the ulcer comes under treatment the better the prognosis.Old ulcers with thickened indurated margins containing altered
blood-vessels naturally heal with greater difficulty than
recently-formed ulcers.Profuse hemorrhage adds to the gravity of the diagnosis.It usually
indicates that the ulcer has penetrated to the serous coat of the
stomach.A hemorrhage may exert a favorable influence, in so far as to
convince the patient of the necessity of submitting to the repose and
the strict dietetic regimen which the physician prescribes.The severity of the pain is of little value as a prognostic sign.Vomiting and dyspepsia, if uncontrolled by regulation of the diet, lead
to a cachectic state which often ends in death.Little basis as there is to hope for recovery after perforation into
the general peritoneal cavity, there nevertheless have been a very few
cases in which there is reason to believe that recovery has actually
taken place after this occurrence.[108]

[Footnote 108: The most convincing case of recovery after perforation
of gastric ulcer is one reported by Hughes, Ray, and Hilton in _Guy's
Hosp.A servant-girl was suddenly seized with all
of the symptoms of perforation.Fortunately, she had eaten nothing for
four hours before the attack, and then only gruel.She was placed at
once under the influence of opium, was kept in the recumbent posture,
and was fed by the rectum.She was discharged apparently cured after
fifty-two days.Two months afterward she was again suddenly seized with
the same symptoms, and she died in fourteen hours.Shortly before the
second perforation she had eaten cherries, strawberries, and
gooseberries, which were found in the peritoneal cavity.The autopsy
showed, in addition to a recent peritonitis, evidences of an old
peritonitis.There were adhesions of the coils of the intestines with
each other and between the stomach and adjacent viscera.In the stomach
were found a cicatrix and two open ulcers, one of which had perforated.Other cases in which recovery followed after all of the symptoms of
perforation of gastric ulcer were present, but in which no subsequent
autopsy proved the correctness of the diagnosis, have been reported by
Redwood (_Lancet_, May 7, 1870); Ross (_ibid._, Jan.21, 1871); Tinley
(_ibid._, April 15, 1871); Mancini (_La Sperimentale_, 1876, pp.551,
665); and G. Johnson (_Brit.Frazer's two cases, reported in the _Dublin Hosp.Gaz._, April 15,
1861, are not convincing.The case reported by Aufrecht (_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1870, No.21) and the one by Starcke (_Deutsche Klinik_,
1870, No.39), which are sometimes quoted as examples of recovery, were
cases of circumscribed peritonitis following perforation.In an interesting case from Nothnagel's clinic reported by Luderitz,
the patient lived sixteen days after perforation into the peritoneal
cavity, followed by all of the symptoms of diffuse perforative
peritonitis.Death resulted from pneumonia secondary to the
peritonitis.At the autopsy were found adhesions over the whole
peritoneal surface and streaks of thickened pus between the coils of
intestine.The perforation in the stomach was closed by the left lobe
of the liver (_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1879, No.In estimating the prognosis one should bear in mind the possibility of
relapses; of a continuance of gastric disorders, particularly of
gastralgia, after cicatrization; of the formation of cicatricial
stenosis of {519} the orifices of the stomach; and of the development
of dilatation of the stomach.After the worst has been said concerning the unfavorable issues of
gastric ulcer, it yet remains true that the essential tendency of the
ulcer when placed under favorable conditions is toward recovery, and
that in many cases the treatment of the disease affords most excellent
results, and is therefore a thankful undertaking for the physician.TREATMENT.--In the absence of any agent which exerts a direct curative
influence upon gastric ulcer the main indication for treatment is the
removal of all sources of irritation from the ulcer, so that the
process of repair may be impeded as little as possible.Theoretically, this is best accomplished by giving to the stomach
complete rest and by nourishing the patient by rectal alimentation.Practically, this method of administering food is attended with many
difficulties, and, moreover, the nutrition of the patient eventually
suffers by persistence in its employment.In most cases the patient can
be more satisfactorily nourished by the stomach, and by proper
selection of the diet, without causing injurious irritation of the
ulcer.At the beginning of the course of treatment it is often well to
withhold for two or three days all food from the stomach and to resort
to exclusive rectal feeding.In some cases with uncontrollable vomiting
and after-hemorrhage from the stomach it is necessary to feed the
patient exclusively by the rectum.The substances best adapted for nutritive enemata are
artificially-digested foods, such as Leube's pancreatic meat-emulsion,
his beef-solution, and peptonized milk-gruel as recommended by
Roberts.[109] Beef-tea and eggs, which are often used for this purpose,
are not to be recommended, as the former has very little nutritive
value, and egg albumen is absorbed in but slight amount from the
rectum.Expressed beef-juice may also be used for rectal alimentation.The peptones, although physiologically best adapted for nutritive
enemata, often irritate the mucous membrane of the rectum, so that they
cannot be retained.It has been proven that it is impossible to
completely nourish a human being by the rectum.[110] Rectal
alimentation can sometimes be advantageously combined with feeding by
the mouth.[Footnote 109: Leube's pancreatic meat-emulsion is prepared by adding
to 4-8 ounces of scraped and finely-chopped beef l-2-1/2 ounces of
fresh finely-chopped oxen's or pig's pancreas freed from fat.To the
mixture is added a little lukewarm water until the consistence after
stirring is that of thick gruel.The syringe used to inject this
mixture should have a wide opening in the nozzle; Leube has constructed
one for the purpose (Leube, _Deutsches Arch.The milk-gruel is prepared by adding a thick, well-boiled gruel made
from wheaten flour, arrowroot, or some other farinaceous article to an
equal quantity of milk.Just before administration a dessertspoonful of
liquor pancreaticus (Benger) or 5 grains of extractum pancreatis
(Fairchild Bros.), with 20 grains of bicarbonate of soda, are added to
the enema.This may be combined with peptonized beef-tea made according
to Roberts's formula (Roberts, _On the Digestive Ferments_, p.Preparatory to beginning the treatment the bowels should be emptied by
a clyster, and this should be occasionally repeated.About three to six
ounces of the tepid nutritive fluid should be slowly injected into the
rectum.The injections may be repeated at intervals of from three to
six hours.If necessary, a few drops of laudanum may be occasionally
added to the enema.][Footnote 110: Voit u. Bauer, _Zeitschrift f. Biologie_, Bd.There is universal agreement that the dietetic treatment of gastric
ulcer is of much greater importance than the medicinal treatment.There
is {520} hardly another disease in which the beneficial effects of
proper regulation of the diet are so apparent as in gastric ulcer.Those articles of food are most suitable which call into action least
vigorously the secretion of gastric juice and the peristaltic movements
of the stomach, which do not cause abnormal fermentations, which do not
remain a long time in the stomach, and which do not mechanically
irritate the surface of the ulcer.These requirements are met only by a
fluid diet, and are met most satisfactorily by milk and by Leube's
beef-solution.The efficacy of a milk diet in this disease has been attested by long
and manifold experience.By its adoption in many cases the pain and the
vomiting are relieved, and finally disappear, and the ulcer heals.In
general, fresh milk is well borne.If not, skimmed milk may be
employed.If the digestion of the milk causes acidity, then a small
quantity of bicarbonate of soda or some lime-water (one-fourth to
one-half in bulk) may be added to the milk.Large quantities should not
be taken at once.Four ounces of milk taken every two hours are
generally well borne.Sometimes not more than a tablespoonful can be
taken at a time without causing vomiting, and then of course the milk
should be given at shorter intervals.It is desirable that the patient
should receive at least a quart, and if possible two quarts, during the
twenty-four hours.The milk should be slightly warmed, but in some
cases cold milk may be better retained.In some instances buttermilk
agrees with the patient better than sweet milk.Although many suppose
that they have some idiosyncrasy as regards the digestion of milk, this
idiosyncrasy is more frequently imaginary than real.Still, there are
cases in which milk cannot be retained, even in small quantity.For such cases peptonized milk often proves serviceable.[111] The
artificial digestion of milk as well as of other articles of food is a
method generally applicable to the treatment of gastric ulcer.The main
objection to peptonized milk is the aversion to it that many patients
acquire on account of its bitter taste.The peptonization should not be
carried beyond a slightly bitter taste.The disagreeable taste may be
improved by the addition of a little Vichy or soda-water.Peptonized
milk has proved to be most valuable in the treatment of gastric ulcer.[Footnote 111: Milk may be peptonized by adding to a pint of fresh
milk, warmed to a temperature of 100 degrees F., 5 grs.of extract
pancreatis (Fairchild Bros.sodii
dissolved in 4 ounces of tepid water.The mixture is allowed to digest
for about an hour at a temperature of 100 degrees F., which may be
conveniently done by placing the milk in a bowl in a pan of water
maintained at this temperature.It is then boiled, strained, and placed
on ice, or when the milk is to be taken immediately it is better not to
boil it, in order that the partial digestion may continue for a while
under the influence of the pancreatic ferment in the stomach.The milk
without boiling may be kept on ice without further digestion; and this
procedure has the advantage that the pancreatic ferments, although
inactive at a temperature near that of ice, are not destroyed.The
degree of digestion aimed at is indicated by the production of a
slightly, but not unpleasantly, bitter taste.When the digestion is
carried to completion, milk has a very bitter and disagreeable flavor.Peptonized milk-gruel, mentioned on page 519, may also be employed.]Leube's beef-solution[112] is a nutritious, unirritating, and
easily-digested article of diet.It can often be taken when milk is not
easily or {521} completely digested, or when milk becomes tiresome and
disagreeable to the patient.It is relied upon mainly by Leube in his
very successful treatment of gastric ulcer.A pot of the beef-solution
(corresponding to a half pound of beef) is to be taken during the
twenty-four hours.A tablespoonful or more may be given at a time in
unsalted or but slightly salted bouillon, to which, if desired, a
little of Liebig's beef-extract may be added to improve the taste.The
bouillon should be absolutely free from fat.Unfortunately, not a few
patients acquire such a distaste for the beef-solution that they cannot
be persuaded to continue its use for any considerable length of time.[Footnote 112: By means of a high temperature and of hydrochloric acid
the meat enclosed in an air-tight vessel is converted into a fine
emulsion and is partly digested.Its soft consistence, highly
nutritious quality, and easy digestibility render this preparation of
the greatest value.The beef-solution is prepared in New York
satisfactorily by Mettenheimer, druggist, Sixth Avenue and Forty-fifth
street, and by Dr.Rudisch, whose preparation is sold by several
druggists.]Freshly-expressed beef-juice is also a fairly nutritious food, which
can sometimes be employed with advantage.The juice is rendered more
palatable if it is pressed from scraped or finely-chopped beef which
has been slightly broiled with a little fresh butter and salt.The meat
should, however, remain very rare, and the fat should be carefully
removed from the juice.To the articles of diet which have been mentioned can sometimes be
added raw or soft-boiled egg in small quantity, and as an addition to
the milk crumbled biscuit or wheaten bread which may be toasted, or
possibly powdered rice or arrowroot or some of the infant farinaceous
foods, such as Nestle's.Milk thickened with powdered cracker does not
coagulate in large masses in the stomach, and is therefore sometimes
better borne than ordinary milk.For the first two or three weeks at least the patient should be
confined strictly to the bill of fare here given.Nothing should be
left to the discretion of the patient or of his friends.It is not enough to direct the patient simply to
take easily-digested food, but precise directions should be given as to
what kind of food is to be taken, how much is to be taken at a time,
how often it is to be taken, and how it is to be prepared.In all cases of any severity the patient should be treated in bed in
the recumbent posture, and warm fomentations should be kept over the
region of the stomach.Usually, at the end of two or three weeks of this diet the patient's
condition is sufficiently improved to allow greater variety in his
food.Boiled white meat of a young fowl can
now usually be taken, and agreeable dishes can be prepared with milk,
beaten eggs, and farinaceous substances, such as arrowroot, rice,
corn-starch, tapioca, and sago.Boiled calf's brain and calf's feet are allowed by Leube at this stage
of the treatment.To these articles can soon be added a very rare beefsteak made from the
soft mass scraped by a blunt instrument from a tenderloin of beef, so
that all coarse and tough fibres are left behind.This may be
superficially broiled with a little fresh butter.Boiled white fish,
particularly cod, may also be tried.It is especially important to avoid all coarse, mechanically-irritating
food, such as brown bread, wheaten grits, oatmeal, etc.; also fatty
substances, pastry, acids, highly-seasoned food, vegetables, fruit, and
all kinds of spirituous liquor.The juice of oranges and of lemons can
usually be taken.The food should not be taken very hot or very cold.For at least two or three months the patient should be confined to the
{522} easily-digested articles of diet mentioned.These afford
sufficient variety, and no license should be given to exceed the
dietary prescribed by the physician.Transgression in this respect is
liable to be severely punished by return of the symptoms.When there is
reason to believe that the ulcer is cicatrized, the patient may
gradually resume his usual diet, but often for a long time, and perhaps
for life, he may be compelled to guard his diet very carefully, lest
there should be a return of the disease.Should there be symptoms of a
relapse, the patient should resume at once the easily-digested diet
described above.Medicinal treatment of gastric ulcer, although less efficacious than
the dietetic treatment, is not to be discarded.Since its advocacy by
Ziemssen the administration of Carlsbad salts or of similarly composed
salts belongs to the systematic treatment of gastric ulcer.The objects
intended to be accomplished by the use of these salts are the daily
evacuation of the contents of the stomach into the intestine by gentle
stimulation of the gastric peristaltic movements, the neutralization of
the acid of the stomach, and the prevention of acid fermentations in
the stomach.Of these objects the most important is the prevention of
stagnation of the contents of the stomach.The chief ingredients of the
Carlsbad waters are sulphate of sodium, carbonate of sodium, and
chloride of sodium.The most important of these ingredients is sulphate
of sodium (Glauber's salts), which by exciting peristalsis propels the
gastric contents into the intestine, and thus relieves the stomach of
its burden, prevents fermentation, and removes from the surface of the
ulcer an important source of irritation.The carbonate of sodium
neutralizes the acids of the stomach, but the main value of this
ingredient and of the chloride of sodium is that in some way they
correct the action of the Glauber's salts, so that the latter may be
taken in smaller quantity and without the usual unpleasant effects of
pure Glauber's salts.[113] The artificial Carlsbad salts are to be
preferred to the natural or the artificial Carlsbad water.The natural
Carlsbad salts and much of those sold as artificial Carlsbad salts
consist almost wholly of sulphate of sodium.It is therefore best to
prescribe in proper proportion the leading ingredients of these salts.A suitable combination is sulphate of sodium five ounces, bicarbonate
of sodium two ounces, and chloride of sodium one ounce
(Leichtenstern[114]).The relative proportion of the ingredients may of
course be varied somewhat to suit individual cases.The salts are to be
taken daily before breakfast dissolved in a considerable quantity of
warm water.One or two heaping teaspoonfuls of the salts are dissolved
in one-half to one pint of water warmed to a {523} temperature of 95
degrees F. One-fourth of this is to be drunk at a time at intervals of
ten minutes.Breakfast is taken half an hour after the last draught.After breakfast there should follow one or two loose movements of the
bowels.If this is not the case, the next day the quantity of the salts
is to be increased, or if more movements are produced the quantity is
to be diminished until the desired result is obtained.In case the
salts do not operate, an enema may be used.Usually, to obtain the same
effect, the quantity of salts may be gradually diminished to a
teaspoonful.[Footnote 113: Water from the Sprudel spring contains in 16 ounces 18.2
grains of sulphate of sodium, 14.6 grains of bicarbonate of sodium, and
7.9 grains of chloride of sodium, and 11.8 cubic inches of carbonic
acid.Its natural temperature is 158 degrees F. The other Carlsbad
springs have the same fixed composition and vary only in temperature
and amount of CO_{2}.][Footnote 114: The second edition of the German Pharmacopoeia contains
a formula for making artificial Carlsbad salts, so that the ingredients
are in about the same proportion as in the natural water.The formula
is as follows: Dried sulphate of sodium 44 parts, sulphate of potassium
2 parts, chloride of sodium 18 parts, bicarbonate of sodium 36 parts.These should be mixed so as to make a white dry powder.The Carlsbad
water is imitated by dissolving 6 grammes of this salt in 1 liter of
water (_Pharmacopoeia Germanica_, editio altera, Berlin, 1882, p.According to a prescription very commonly used in Germany, the Carlsbad
salts are made by taking sulphate of sodium 50 parts, bicarbonate of
sodium 6 parts, chloride of sodium 3 parts.Dose, a teaspoonful
dissolved in one or two tumblers of warm water (Ewald u. Ludecke,
_Handb.Arzneiverordnungslehre_, Berlin, 1883, p.The Carlsbad salts are directed especially against the chronic gastric
catarrh which complicates the majority of cases of ulcer of the
stomach.It is well known that the most effective method of treating
this morbid condition is the washing out of the stomach by means of the
stomach-tube.The propriety of adopting this procedure in gastric ulcer
comes, therefore, under consideration.Although the use of the
stomach-tube in gastric ulcer is discarded by Leube and by See on
account of its possible danger, nevertheless this instrument has been
employed with great benefit in many instances of this disease by
Schliep, Debore, and others.[115] No instance of perforation of an
ulcer by means of the stomach-tube has been reported, and in general no
evil effects have resulted; but Duguet cites a case of fatal hemorrhage
following washing out of the stomach.[116] In view of the great benefit
to be secured by washing out the stomach, and of the comparatively
slight danger which attends the process, it seems justifiable to adopt
this procedure cautiously and occasionally in cases of gastric ulcer
with severe gastric catarrh.Of course only the soft rubber tube should
be used, and the siphon process should be adopted.[117] The stomach may
be washed out with pure warm water or with water containing a little
bicarbonate of sodium (one-half drachm to a quart of water).The
occasional cleansing of the stomach in this way can hardly fail to
promote the healing of the ulcer.Recent or threatened hemorrhage from
the stomach would contraindicate the use of the stomach-tube.[Footnote 115: Schliep, _Deutsch.13; Debore,
_L'Union med._, Dec.30, 1882; Bianchi, _Gaz.degli Ospitali_, March
26, 1884.]In a case of gastric
ulcer of Cornillon severe hemorrhage followed washing out the stomach
(_Le Prog.[Footnote 117: Soft rubber stomach-tubes are made by Tiemann & Co.in
New York, and are sold by most medical instrument-makers.A description
of the appropriate tube and of the method of its use is given by W. B.
Platt ("The Mechanical Treatment of Diseases of the Stomach," _Maryland
Medical Journal_, March 8, 1884).]Beyond the measures indicated there is little more to do in the way of
treatment directed toward the repair of the ulcer.Not much, if
anything, is to be expected from the employment of drugs which have
been claimed to exert a specific curative action on the ulcer.Of these
drugs those which have been held in the greatest repute are bismuth and
nitrate of silver.Trousseau[118] devised a somewhat complicated plan
for administering bismuth and nitrate of silver in succession for
several months in the treatment of gastric ulcer.There are few who any
longer cherish any faith in these drugs as curative of gastric ulcer.The same may be said of other drugs which have been thought to have
similar specific virtue in the treatment of gastric ulcer, such as
acetate of lead, arsenic, chloral hydrate, iodoform, etc.[Footnote 118: _Clinique medicale_, t. iii.{524} It remains to consider therapeutic measures which may be
necessary to combat individual symptoms of gastric ulcer.The pain of gastric ulcer is generally relieved in a few days by strict
adherence to the dietetic regimen which has been laid down.When this
is not the case, it may be best to withhold all food from the stomach
and to nourish by the rectum.But this cannot be continued long without
weakening the patient, and sometimes the pain persists in spite of the
rest afforded the stomach.Undoubtedly, the most effective means of
quieting the pain of gastric ulcer is the administration of opium in
some form.Opium should not, however, be resorted to without full
consideration of the possible consequences.When the use of this drug
is once begun, the patient is liable to become dependent upon it, and
may be inclined, consciously or unconsciously, to exaggerate the pain
in order to obtain the narcotic.When prescribing opium in this disease
the physician should have in mind the danger of establishing the opium
habit.Moreover, opium <DW44>s digestion, and is anything but an aid to
the proper dietetic regimen, which is all-important.If it is decided
to give opium, it does not matter much in what form it is administered,
but the dose should be as small as will answer the purpose.Hypodermic
injections of morphine over the region of the stomach may be
recommended.Codeia often produces less disturbance than opium or
morphine.A useful powder for the relief of pain is one containing 8 or
10 grains of subnitrate of bismuth, 1/12 grain of sulphate of morphia,
and 1/5 grain of extract of belladonna.Much of the beneficial effect
attributed to bismuth is in reality due to its customary combination
with a small quantity of morphine.Before resorting to opium in cases
of severe pain it will be well to try some of the other means for
relieving the pain of gastric ulcer, although they are less effective.Gerhardt thinks that astringents are better than narcotics to relieve
the pain of ulcer, and he recommends for the purpose three or four
drops of solution of chloride of iron diluted with a wineglassful of
water, to be taken several times daily.Although this recommendation is
from high authority and is often quoted, sufficient confirmatory
evidence of its value is lacking.Other medicines recommended are
hyoscyamus, belladonna, choral hydrate, chloric ether, hydrocyanic
acid, bismuth, nitrate of silver, and compound kino powder.Sometimes
warm fomentations, at other times a light ice-bag over the epigastrium,
afford marked relief of the pain.Counter-irritation over the region of
the stomach has also given relief.This may be effected with a mustard
plaster or by croton oil.I have known the establishment of a small
nitric-acid issue in the pit of the stomach to relieve the pain, but
such severe measures of counter-irritation are generally unnecessary.The application of a few leeches over the epigastrium has been highly
recommended, but this should be done without much loss of blood.The
effect of position of the body upon the relief of pain should be
determined.When the pain is due to flatulence or to acid fermentation
in the stomach, the treatment should be directed to those states.The most effective means of controlling the vomiting in gastric ulcer
are the regulation of the diet and, if necessary, the resort to rectal
alimentation.Whenever small
quantities of milk, peptonized or in any other form, cannot be
retained, then exclusive rectal feeding may be tried for a while.There
have been cases of gastric {525} ulcer when both the stomach and the
rectum have been intolerant of food.In such desperate cases the
attempt may be made to introduce food into the stomach by means of the
stomach-tube, for it is a singular fact that food introduced in this
way is sometimes retained when everything taken by the mouth is
vomited.[119] The cautious washing out of the stomach by the
stomach-tube may prove beneficial.In these cases the attempt has also
been made to nourish by subcutaneous injections of food.In a case of
gastric ulcer where no food could be retained either by the stomach or
by the rectum Whittaker[120] injected subcutaneously milk,
beef-extract, and warmed cod-liver oil.The
injections were continued for four days without food by the mouth or
rectum.At the best, hypodermic alimentation can
afford but slight nourishment, and is to be regarded only as a last
refuge.If there is danger of death by exhaustion, transfusion may be
resorted to.[Footnote 119: Debore, _L'Union medicale_, Dec.30, 1882, and _Gaz.des
Hop._, April 29, 1884.For this reason Debore makes extensive use of
the stomach-tube in general in feeding patients affected with gastric
ulcer.He objects to an exclusive milk diet on account of the quantity
of fluid necessary to nourish the patient, which he says amounts to
three to four quarts of milk daily.To avoid these inconveniences, he
gives three times daily drachm viss of meat-powder and drachm iiss of
bicarbonate of sodium (or equal parts of calcined magnesia and bicarb.This is to be introduced by the
stomach-tube on account of its disagreeable taste.He believes that the
addition of the large quantity of alkali prevents digestion from
beginning until the food has reached the intestine.He also gives daily
a quart of milk containing grs.Debore's
method of preparing the meat-powder is described in _L'Union medicale_,
July 29, 1882, p.He also uses a milk-powder (_ibid._, Dec.30,
1882; see also _Le Progres med._, July 12, 1884).][Footnote 120: J. T. Whittaker, "Hypodermic Alimentation," _The
Clinic_, Jan.Bernutz practised successfully in two cases the hypodermic injection of
fresh dog's blood (_Gaz.Wochenschr._, 1875, No.of
olive oil twice a day subcutaneously without causing abscesses.Menzel and Porco were the first to employ hypodermic alimentation
(_ibid._, 1869, No.Of remedies to check vomiting, first in importance are ice swallowed in
small fragments and morphine administered hypodermically.Effervescent
drinks, such as Vichy, soda-water, and iced champagne, may bring
relief.Other remedies which have been recommended are bismuth,
hydrocyanic acid, oxalate of cerium, creasote, iodine, bromide of
potash, calomel in small doses, and ingluvin.But in general it is best
to forego the use of drugs and to rely upon proper regulation of the
diet, such as iced milk taken in teaspoonful doses, and upon repose for
the stomach.Hemorrhage from the stomach is best treated by absolute rest, the
administration of bits of ice by the mouth, and the application of a
flat, not too heavy, ice-bag over the stomach.The patient should lie
as quietly as possible in the supine position, with light coverings and
in a cool atmosphere.He should be cautioned to make no exertion.His
apprehensions should be quieted so far as possible.All food should be
withheld from the stomach, and for four or five days after the
cessation of profuse hemorrhage aliment should be given only by the
rectum.There is no proof that styptics administered by the mouth have
any control over the hemorrhage, and as they are liable to excite
vomiting they may do harm.Ergotin, dissolved in water (1 part to 10),
may be injected hypodermically in grain doses several times repeated if
necessary.If internal styptics {526} are to be used, perhaps the best
are alum-whey and a combination of gallic acid 10 grains and dilute
sulphuric acid 10 drops diluted with water.Fox praises acetate of
lead, and others ergot, tannin, and Monsell's solution.If there is
vomiting or much restlessness, morphine should be given hypodermically.If the bleeding is profuse, elastic ligatures may be applied for a
short time around the upper part of one or more extremities, so as to
shut out temporarily from the circulation the blood contained in the
extremity.If syncope threatens, ammonia or a little ether may be
inhaled, or ether may be given hypodermically.Brandy, if administered,
should be given either by the rectum or hypodermically.Caution should
be exercised not to excite too vigorously the force of the circulation,
as the diminished force of the heart is an important agent in checking
hemorrhage.When life is threatened in consequence of the loss of
blood, then recourse may be had to transfusion, but experience has
shown that this act is liable to cause renewed hemorrhage in
consequence of the elevation of the blood-pressure which follows it.Transfusion is therefore indicated more for the acute anaemia after the
hemorrhage has ceased and is not likely to be renewed.It should not be
employed immediately after profuse haematemesis, unless it is probable
that otherwise the patient will die from the loss of blood, and then it
is well to transfuse only a small quantity.[121]

[Footnote 121: Michel transfused successfully in a case of extreme
anaemia following gastrorrhagia (_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1870, No.In a case of profuse and repeated haematemesis which followed
washing out the stomach Michaelis infused into the veins 350 cc.Reaction gradually followed, and the patient
recovered.This case, which was one of probable ulcer, illustrates the
advantages of infusing a small quantity (_ibid._, June 23, 1884).The
dangers are illustrated by a case reported by V. Hacker, who infused
1500 cc.of salt solution in a patient in a state of extreme collapse
resulting from hemorrhage from gastric ulcer.The patient rallied, but
he died three hours after the infusion from renewed hemorrhage (_Wiener
med.Wochenschr._, 1883, No.In Legroux's case of gastric ulcer
renewed hemorrhage and death followed the transfusion of only 80
grammes of blood (_Arch.In a case quoted
by Roussel, Leroy transfused 130 grammes of blood in a girl twenty
years old who lay at the point of death from repeated hemorrhages from
a gastric ulcer.In the following night occurred renewed hemorrhage and
death (_Gaz.According to the experiments
of Schwartz and V. Ott, the transfusion, or rather infusion, of
physiological salt solution is as useful as that of blood, and it is
simpler and unattended with some of the dangers of blood-transfusion.The formula is chloride of sodium 6 parts, distilled water 1000.]Schilling recommends, when the bleeding is so profuse that the
patient's life is threatened, to tampon the stomach by means of a
rubber balloon attached to the end of a soft-rubber stomach-tube.[122]
The external surface of the balloon is slightly oiled.It is introduced
into the stomach in a collapsed state, and after its introduction it is
moderately distended with air.When the balloon is to be withdrawn the
air should be allowed slowly to escape.Schilling tried this procedure
in one case of hemorrhage from gastric ulcer, allowing the inflated bag
to remain in the stomach twelve minutes.The hemorrhage ceased and was
not renewed.Experience only can determine whether this device, to
which there are manifest objections, will prove a valuable addition to
our meagre means of controlling hemorrhage from the stomach.[Footnote 122: F. Schilling, _Aerztl.Schreiber, in order to determine the position of the stomach, was the
first to introduce and inflate in this organ a rubber balloon
(_Deutsches Arch.Uhler recommends in
case of profuse gastric hemorrhage to pass a rubber bag into the
stomach and fill it with liquid (_Maryland Med.{527} The boldest suggestion ever made for stopping gastric hemorrhage
is that of Rydygier, who advocates in case hemorrhage from an ulcer
threatens to be fatal to cut down upon the stomach, search for the
bleeding ulcer, and then resect it.[123] Notwithstanding the great
advances made in gastric surgery during the last few years, Rydygier's
suggestion seems extravagant and unwarrantable.The most effectual treatment of the dyspepsia which is present in many
cases of gastric ulcer is adherence to the dietetic rules which have
been laid down, aided by the administration of Carlsbad salts and
perhaps in extreme cases the occasional and cautious use of the
stomach-tube.If eructations of gas and heartburn are troublesome,
antacids may be employed, but they should be given in small doses and
not frequently, as the ultimate effect of alkalies is to increase the
acid secretion of the stomach and to impair digestion.The best alkali
to use is bicarbonate of sodium, of which a few grains may be taken dry
upon the tongue or dissolved in a little water.If perforation into the peritoneal cavity occur, then opium or
hypodermic injections of morphine should be given in large doses, as in
peritonitis.Bran poultices sprinkled with laudanum or other warm
fomentations should be applied over the abdomen, although in Germany
ice-bags are preferred.Food should be administered only by the rectum.The chances of recovery are extremely slight, but the patient's
sufferings are thus relieved.In view of the almost certainly fatal
prognosis of perforation of gastric ulcer into the general peritoneal
cavity, and in view of the success attending various operations
requiring laparotomy, it would seem justifiable in these cases, after
arousing, if possible, the patient from collapse by the administration
of stimulants per rectum or hypodermically, to open the peritoneal
cavity and cleanse it with some tepid antiseptic solution, and then to
treat the perforation in the stomach and the case generally according
to established surgical methods.[124] This would be the more indicated
if it is known that the contents of the stomach at the time of
perforation are not of a bland nature.[Footnote 124: Mikulicz has successfully treated by laparotomy a case
of purulent peritonitis resulting from perforation of the intestine
with extravasation of the intestinal contents.He says that the
operation is not contraindicated by existing peritonitis if the patient
is not already in a state of collapse or sepsis.The perforation is
closed by sutures after freshening the edges of the opening (abstract
in the _Medical News_, Philada., Sept.Both Kuh and Rydygier
recommend opening the abdomen after perforation of gastric ulcer.The
borders of the ulcer are to be resected and the opening closed by
sutures (_Volkmann's Samml.It is important to maintain and to improve the patient's nutrition,
which often becomes greatly impaired from the effects of the ulcer.This indication is not altogether compatible with the all-important one
of reducing to a minimum the digestive work of the stomach.Nevertheless, some of the easily-digested articles of food which have
been mentioned are highly nutritious.By means of these and by good
hygienic management the physician should endeavor, without violating
the dietetic laws which have been laid down, to increase, so far as
possible, the strength of his patient.Starvation treatment in itself
is never indicated in gastric ulcer.Inunction of the body with oil is
useful in cases of gastric ulcer, as recommended by Pepper.[125]

[Footnote 125: _North Carolina Medical Journal_, 1880, vol.{528} In view of Daettwyler's experiments, mentioned on page 514, it is
manifestly important to counteract the anaemia of gastric ulcer.Iron,
however, administered by the mouth, disturbs the stomach and is
decidedly contraindicated during the active stage of gastric ulcer.During convalescence, only the blandest preparations of iron should be
given, and these not too soon, lest they cause a relapse.When the
indication to remove the anaemia is urgent, and especially when the
chlorotic form of anaemia exists, it may be well to try the hypodermic
method of administering iron, although this method has not yet been
made thoroughly satisfactory.Especially for the anaemia of gastric
ulcer would an efficient and unirritating preparation of iron for
hypodermic administration prove a great boon.Probably at present the
best preparation for hypodermic use is the citrate of iron, given in
one- to two-grain doses in a 10 per cent.aqueous solution, which when
used must be clear and not over a month old.The syringe and needle
shortly before using should be washed with carbolic acid.The
injections are best borne when made into the long muscles of the back
or into the nates, as recommended by Lewin for injections of corrosive
sublimate.A slight burning pain is felt for ten minutes after the
injection.This is the method employed by Quincke with good result and
without inflammatory reaction.[126] It is well to remember that
Kobert[127] has found by experiment on animals that large doses of iron
injected subcutaneously cause nephritis.Other preparations of iron
which have been recommended for hypodermic use are ferrum dialysatum
(DaCosta), ferrum pyrophosphoricum cum natr.citrico (Neuss), ferrum
pyrophosphoricum cum ammon.(Huguenin), ferrum peptonatum and
ferrum oleinicum (Rosenthal).[128] When it becomes safe to administer
iron by the stomach, then the blander preparations should be used, such
as the pyrophosphate, lactate, effervescing citrate, ferrum redactum.60, Gelatin q. s.; make 90 pills: at first one, and
afterward as many as three, of these pills may be taken three times a
day.When carefully prepared the pills are about as soft as butter.[Footnote 126: Quincke, _Deutsch.27;

1878, Nos.45-49, and 1884, Jan.Various sequels of gastric ulcer may require treatment.Cicatrization
of the ulcer is by no means always cure in the clinical sense.As the
result of adhesions and the formation and contraction of cicatricial
tissue very serious disturbances of the functions of the stomach may
follow the repair of gastric ulcer.The most important of these sequels
is stenosis of the orifices of the stomach, particularly of the pyloric
orifice.Very considerable stenosis of the pylorus may be produced
before the ulcer is completely cicatrized.In three instances a
stenosing ulcer of the pylorus has been successfully extirpated.[129]
The most important of these sequels {529} of gastric ulcer will be
treated of hereafter.Here it need only be said that during
convalescence from gastric ulcer attention to diet is all-important.For a long time the diet should be restricted to easily-digested food.The first symptoms of relapse are to be met by prompt return to bland
diet, or, if necessary, to rectal alimentation.[Footnote 129: The successful operators were Rydygier (_Berl.16, 1882), Czerny (_Arch.1), and Van Kleef (_Virchow u. Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1882, Bd.Cavazzani cut out by an elliptical incision an old
indurated ulcer of the stomach adherent to the anterior abdominal
walls.The patient died three years afterward of phthisis (_Centralbl.f. Chir._, 1879, p.Lauenstein resected the pylorus
unsuccessfully for what appears to have been an ulcer of the pylorus
with fibroid induration around it (_ibid._, 1882, No.These four
cases (three successful) are all which I have found recorded of
resection of gastric ulcer.In my opinion the resection of gastric
ulcers which resist all other methods of treatment, and especially
those which cause progressive stricture of the pylorus, is a
justifiable operation.]Ulcers of the stomach which do not belong to the category of simple
ulcer are for the most part of pathological rather than of clinical
interest.Although miliary tubercles in the walls of the stomach are more
frequent than is generally supposed, genuine tuberculous ulcers of the
stomach are not common.The most important criterion of these ulcers is
the presence of tuberculous lymphatic glands in the neighborhood, and
of miliary tubercles upon the peritoneum corresponding to the ulcer.Sometimes miliary tubercles can be discovered in the floor and sides of
the ulcer.Tuberculous gastric ulcers, when they occur, are usually
associated with tuberculous ulceration of the intestine.In an
undoubted case of tuberculous ulcer of the stomach reported by Litten,
however, this was the only ulcer to be found in the digestive
tract.[130] Tuberculous gastric ulcers generally produce no symptoms,
but they have been known to cause perforation of the stomach and
haematemesis.Many cases which have been recorded as tuberculous ulcers
of the stomach were in reality simple ulcers.Cheesy tubercles as large
as a pea, both ulcerated and non-ulcerated, have been found in the
stomach, but they are very rare.[Footnote 130: Litten, _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Typhoid ulcers may also occur in the stomach, but they are infrequent.Both perforation of the stomach and gastrorrhagia have been caused by
typhoid ulcers, which, as a rule, however, produce no symptoms
distinctly referable to the ulcer.Syphilitic ulcers and syphilitic cicatrices of the stomach have been
described, without sufficient proof as to their being syphilitic in
origin.Necrotic ulcers, probably mycotic in origin, may be found in the
stomach in cases of splenic fever, erysipelas, pyaemia, etc.Ulceration occurring in toxic, in diphtheritic, and in phlegmonous
gastritis need not be discussed here.Follicular and catarrhal ulcers of the stomach have been described, but
without sufficient ground for separating them from hemorrhagic erosion
on the one hand and simple ulcer on the other.Hemorrhagic erosions of the stomach, to which formerly so much
importance was attached, are now believed to be without clinical
significance.They are found very frequently, and often very
abundantly, after death from a great variety of causes.{530}

CANCER OF THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.DEFINITION.--Cancer of the stomach is characterized anatomically by the
formation in this organ of a new growth, composed of a
connective-tissue stroma so arranged as to enclose alveoli or spaces
containing cells resembling epithelial cells.The growth extends by
invading the tissues surrounding it, and frequently gives rise to
secondary cancerous deposits in other organs of the body.The forms of
cancer which occur primarily in the stomach are scirrhous, medullary,
colloid, and cylindrical epithelial cancer.Rarely latent, occasionally without symptoms
pointing to the stomach as the seat of disease, gastric cancer is
usually attended by the following symptoms: loss of appetite,
indigestion, vomiting with or without admixture with blood, pain, a
tumor in or near the epigastric region, progressive loss of flesh and
strength, and the development of the so-called cancerous cachexia.The
disease is not curable.After its recognition it rarely lasts longer
than from twelve to fifteen months.SYNONYMS.--Carcinoma ventriculi; Malignant disease of the stomach.Of
the many synonyms for the special forms of cancer, the most common
are--for scirrhous, hard, fibrous; for medullary, encephaloid, soft,
fungoid; for colloid, gelatinous, mucoid, alveolar; and for cylindrical
epithelial, cylindrical-celled or cylindrical or columnar epithelioma,
cylindrical-celled cancroid, destructive adenoma.HISTORY.--Cancer of the stomach was known to the ancients only by
certain disturbances of the gastric functions which it produces.The
disease itself was not clearly appreciated until its recognition by
post-mortem examinations, which began to be made with some frequency
after the revival of medicine in the sixteenth century.During the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries several instances of gastric
cancer are recorded, the best described being those observed and
collected by Morgagni (1761).During this period scirrhus was regarded
as the type of cancerous disease.It was a common custom to call only
the ulcerated scirrhous tumors cancerous.With the awakened interest in pathological anatomy which marked the
beginning of the present century, the gross anatomical characters of
cancer and the main forms of the disease came to be more clearly
recognized.After the description of encephaloid cancer by Laennec[1]
in 1812, {531} and the first clear recognition of colloid cancer by
Otto[2] in 1816, these two forms of cancer took rank with scirrhus as
constituting the varieties of cancer of the stomach as well as of
cancer elsewhere.All that it was possible to accomplish in the
description of cancer of the stomach from a purely gross anatomical
point of view reached its culmination in the great pathological works
of Cruveilhier (1829-35) and of Carswell (1838), both of whom admirably
delineated several specimens of gastric cancer.des Sciences med._, t. i. and t.xii., Paris,
1812-15.][Footnote 2: Otto, _Seltens Beobachtungen, etc._, 1816.]During this period of active anatomical research the symptomatology of
gastric cancer was not neglected.The article on cancer by Bayle and
Cayol in the _Dictionnaire des Sciences medicales_, published in 1812,
shows how well the clinical history of gastric cancer was understood at
that period.Cylindrical-celled epithelioma of the stomach could not be recognized
as a separate form of tumor until the application of the microscope to
the study and classification of tumors--an era introduced by Muller in
1838.[3] Cylindrical-celled epithelioma of the stomach was first
recognized by Reinhardt in 1851, was subsequently described by Bidder
and by Virchow, and received a full and accurate description from
Forster in 1858.[4]

[Footnote 3: _Ueber den feineren Ban, etc., der krankh.Geschwulste_,
Berlin, 1838.][Footnote 4: Reinhardt, _Annalen d. Charite_, ii.1, 1851; Bidder,
_Muller's Archiv_, 1852, p.178; Virchow, _Gaz.de Paris_, April
7, 1855; Forster, _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Until the publication by Waldeyer[5] in 1867 of his memorable article
on the development of cancers, it was generally accepted that gastric
cancer originated in the submucous coat of the stomach, and that the
cells in the cancerous alveoli were derived from connective-tissue
cells.Waldeyer attempted to establish for the stomach his doctrine
that all cancers are of epithelial origin.In all varieties of gastric
cancer he believed that he could demonstrate the origin of the
cancer-cells from epithelial cells of the gastric tubules--a mode of
origin which had previously been advocated for cylindrical epithelioma
by Cornil[6] (1864).Waldeyer's view has met with marked favor since
its publication, but there are eminent pathologists who have not given
adherence to it in the exclusive form advocated by its author.[Footnote 5: _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.It is somewhat remarkable that although in the early part of the
present century several monographs on gastric cancer appeared,[7] all
the more recent contributions to the subject are to be found in theses,
scattered journal articles, and text-books.Of the more recent careful
and extensive articles on cancer of the stomach, those of Lebert and of
Brinton are perhaps most worthy of mention.[8]

[Footnote 7: Chardel, Benech, Daniel, Germain, Prus, Sharpey, Barras,
etc.][Footnote 8: Lebert, _Die Krankheiten des Magens_, Tubingen, 1878;
Brinton, _Brit.ETIOLOGY.--The data for estimating the frequency of gastric cancer are
the clinical statistics of hospitals, series of recorded autopsies, and
mortuary registration reports.Statistics with reference to this point based exclusively upon the
clinical material of hospitals have only relative value, as they do not
{532} represent in proper proportion both sexes, all ages, all classes
in life, and all diseases.Statistics based upon autopsies surpass all
others in certainty of diagnosis, but they possess in even greater
degree the defects urged against hospital statistics.Not all the fatal
cases in hospitals are examined post-mortem, and gastric cancer is
among the diseases most likely to receive such examination.Hence
estimates of frequency based exclusively upon autopsies are liable to
be excessive.Estimates from mortuary registration reports, and
therefore from the diagnoses given in death-certificates, rest
manifestly upon a very untrustworthy basis as regards diagnosis, but in
other respects they represent the ideal point of view, including, as
these reports do, all causes of death among all classes of persons.It
is evident that in all methods of estimating the frequency of gastric
cancer inhere important sources of error.In general, the larger the
number of cases upon which the estimates rest the less prominent are
the errors.Such estimates as we possess are to be regarded only as
approximate, and subject to revision.From mortuary statistics Tanchou estimates the frequency of gastric
cancer as compared with that of all causes of death at 0.6 per cent.;
Virchow, at 1.9 per cent.; and D'Espine, at 2-1/2
per cent.[9]

[Footnote 9: Tanchou, _Rech.des Tumeurs du
Sein_, Paris, 1844.These statistics, which are based upon an analysis
of 382,851 deaths in the department of the Seine, are necessarily
subject to sources of error, but they do not seem to me to deserve the
harsh criticisms of Lebert and others.Virchow, _Verhandl.Wurzburg_, 1860, vol.49--analysis of 3390 deaths in Wurzburg during the years 1852-55.Wyss, quoted by Ebstein in _Volkmann's Samml.87--analysis of 4800 deaths in Zurich from 1872-74.D'Espine, _Echo medical_, 1858, vol.ii.--mortuary statistics of the
canton of Geneva, considered to be particularly accurate.]In 8468 autopsies, chiefly from English hospitals, Brinton[10] found
gastric cancer recorded in 1 per cent.Gussenbauer and
Von Winiwarter[11] found gastric cancer recorded in 1-1/2 per cent.of
the 61,287 autopsies in the Pathological Anatomical Institute of the
Vienna University.From an analysis of 11,175 autopsies in Prague, I
find gastric cancer in 3-1/2 per cent.[12]

[Footnote 10: _Loc.cit._]

[Footnote 11: _Arch.[Footnote 12: Statistics of Dittrich, Engel, Willigk, Wrany, and
Eppinger, in _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vols.vii., viii., ix., x.,
xii., xiv., xxvii., l., xciv., xcix., and cxiv.Grunfeld found in 1150
autopsies in the general hospital for aged persons in Copenhagen 102
cancers of the stomach, or 9 per cent.(_Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.I have collected and analyzed with reference to this point the
statistics of death from all causes in the city of New York for the
fifteen years from 1868 to 1882, inclusive.[13] I find that of the
444,564 deaths during this period, cancer of the stomach was assigned
as the cause in 1548 cases and cancer of the liver in 867 cases.Probably at least one-third of the primary cancers of the liver are to
be reckoned as gastric cancers.This would make the ratio of gastric
cancer to all causes of death about 0.4 per cent.(0.93) if only the deaths from twenty years of age
upward be taken: gastric cancer hardly ever occurs under that age.It
is probably fair to conclude that in New York not over 1 in 200 of the
deaths occurring at all ages and from all causes {533} is due to cancer
of the stomach, and that about 1 in 100 of the deaths from twenty years
of age upward is due to this cause.[Footnote 13: These statistics are obtained from the records of the
Board of Health of the city of New York.These records are kept with
great care and system.]The organs most frequently affected with primary cancer are the uterus
and stomach.In order to determine the relative frequency of cancer in
these situations, I have compiled the following table of statistics
from various sources:[14]

    Primary Cancers.-------------------------  --------------  --------------
  11,131 in Vienna           10   per cent.7,150 in New York         25.7  "   "     24.2  "   "
   9,118 in Paris (Tanchou)  25.2  "   "     32.8  "   "
   1,378 in Paris (Salle)    31.9  "   "     32    "   "
     587 in Berlin           35.8  "   "     25    "   "
     183 in Wurzburg         34.9  "   "     19    "   "
   1,046 in Prague           37.6  "   "     33.3  "   "
     889 in Geneva           45    "   "     15.6  "   "
  ------                     ----            ----
  31,482 total               21.4 per cent.From this table it appears that in some collections of cases the uterus
is the most frequent seat of primary cancer, while in other collections
the stomach takes the first rank.If the sum-total of all the cases be
taken, the conclusion would be that about one-fifth of all primary
cancers are seated in the stomach, and somewhat less than one-third in
the uterus.Even if allowance be made for the apparently too low
percentage of cases of gastric cancer in the large Vienna
statistics,[15] I should still be inclined to place the uterus first in
the list of organs most frequently affected with primary cancer, and to
estimate the frequency of gastric cancer compared with that of primary
cancer elsewhere as not over 25 per cent.[Footnote 14: Vienna cases: Gurlt, _Arch.421--statistical analysis of 16,637 tumors observed in the three large
hospitals of Vienna from 1855 to 1878.New York cases: see preceding
foot-note.Paris cases: Tanchou, _op.cit._, and Salle, _Etiologie de
la Carcinose_, These, Paris, 1877, p.145 _et seq._--fatal cases in
Paris hospitals, 1861-63.Berlin cases: Lange, _Ueber den Magenkrebs_,
Inaug.Diss., Berlin, 1877--post-mortem material.Wurzburg cases:
Virchow, _loc.cit._, and _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Prague
cases: reference given above--post-mortem material.Geneva cases:
D'Espine, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 15: That this percentage is too low is apparent from the fact
that the number of cases of gastric cancer is only twice that of
primary cancer of liver in Gurlt's statistics.]The liability to gastric cancer seems to be the same in both sexes.Of
2214 cases of gastric cancer which I have collected from hospital
statistics, and which were nearly all confirmed by autopsy, 1233 were
in males and 981 in females.[16] This makes the ratio of males to
females about 5 to 4.This difference is so slight that no importance
can be attached to it, especially in view of the fact that in most
hospitals the males are in excess of the females.[Footnote 16: My statistics regarding sex are obtained from _Prager
Vierteljahrschr._, vols.xvii., l., xciv., xcix., cxiv.cit._; Katzenellenbogen, _Beitr.zur Statistik d. Magencarcinoms_,
Jena, 1878; Leudet, _Bull.564; Gussenbauer and
V. Winiwarter, _loc.cit._; Habershon, _Diseases of
Abdomen_, Philada., 1879; and _Ann.zu
Munchen_, Bd.If to these accurate statistics be added collections of cases from
heterogeneous sources, including mortuary statistics (Brinton, Louis,
D'Espine, Virchow, Gurlt, Welch), there results a total of 5426 cases,
with 2843 males and 2583 females, the two sexes being more evenly
represented than in the more exact statistics given in the text.In
this collection of cases Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's cases only up
to the year 1855 are included, as the subsequent ones are doubtless in
great part included in Gurlt's statistics.According to Brinton,
gastric cancer is twice as frequent in males as in females.]{534} The following table gives the age in 2038 cases of gastric cancer
obtained from trustworthy sources and arranged according to
decades:[17]

   Age.------      ----------------  ---------
  10-20.2           0.1
  20-30.55           2.7
  30-40.271          13.3
  40-50.499          24.5
  50-60.620          30.4
  60-70.428          21
  70-80.140           6.85
  80-90.20           1
  90-100.2           0.1
  Over 100.1           0.05

From this analysis we may conclude that three-fourths of all gastric
cancers occur between forty and seventy years of age.The absolutely
largest number is found between fifty and sixty years, but, taking into
consideration the number of those living, the liability to gastric
cancer is as great between sixty and seventy years of age.Nevertheless, the number of cases between thirty and forty years is
considerable, and the occurrence of gastric cancer even between twenty
and thirty is not so exceptional as is often represented, and is by no
means to be ignored.The liability to gastric cancer seems to lessen
after seventy years of age, but here the number of cases and the number
of those living are so small that it is hazardous to draw positive
conclusions.[Footnote 17: The sources of the statistics for age are--Dittrich
(160), _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.; D'Espine (117), _loc.cit._; Virchow (63), _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.429; Leudet (69),

(455), _loc.The results correspond
closely to those of the smaller statistics of Brinton and of Lebert.]Cancer of the stomach in childhood is among the rarest of diseases.Steiner and Neureutter[18] failed to find a single gastric cancer in
2000 autopsies on children.Cullingworth[19] has reported with
microscopical examination a case of cylindrical-celled epithelioma in a
male infant dying at the age of five weeks; it is probable that the
tumor was congenital.It is not certain whether Wilkinson's[20]
often-quoted case of congenital scirrhus of the pylorus in an infant
five weeks old was a cancer or an instance of simple hypertrophy.Kaulich[21] cites a case of colloid cancer affecting the stomach,
together with nearly all the abdominal organs, in a child a year and a
half old, but whether the growth in the stomach was primary or
secondary is not mentioned.The case which Widerhofer[22] has reported
as one of cancer of the stomach secondary to cancer of the
retro-peritoneal glands in an infant sixteen days old seems from the
description to be sarcoma.Scheffer[23] has reported a case of large
ulcerated encephaloid cancer of the fundus, involving the spleen, in a
boy fourteen years old.Jackson[24] has reported an interesting case of
encephaloid cancer in a boy fifteen years old in whom no evidence of
disease existed up {535} to ten weeks before death.These cases, which
are all that I have been able to find in children, are to be regarded
as pathological curiosities.[25]

of gastric cancer occurring under thirty-four years of age.Of these, 3
were under twenty and 14 were between twenty and thirty years.He also
emphasizes the error of considering cancer of the stomach as
exclusively a disease of advanced life.]Such statistics as we possess would make it appear that gastric cancer,
as well as cancer in general, is somewhat less common in the United
States than in the greater part of Europe.[26] These statistics,
however, are too inaccurate, and the problems involved in their
interpretation are too complex, to justify us in drawing any positive
conclusions as to this point.It is certain that cancer is not a rare
disease in the United States.[Footnote 26: Of 1000 deaths in New York in 1882, 19.3 were from
cancer.The statistics on this point from some of the large European
cities are--Geneva, 53 deaths from cancer per mille; Frankfort, 47.6;
Copenhagen, 33.2; Christiania, 29; London, 28.7; Paris, 27; Edinburgh,
25.4; Berlin, 22.4; St.Petersburg, 15; Amsterdam, 12.These statistics
are obtained from the _Forty-fourth Annual Report of the
Registrar-General (for 1881)_, London, 1883; from _Preussische
Statistik_, Heft lxiii., Berlin, 1882; and from _Traite de la
Climatologie medicale_, Paris, 1877-80, by Lombard, in whose excellent
work will be found much information on this subject.To judge from statistics in this country and in England, the death-rate
from cancer is undergoing a rapid annual increase.Whereas in New York
in 1868 this death-rate was only 12.6 per mille, in 1882 it was 19.3.In England and Wales in 1858 the deaths from cancer per 1,000,000
persons living were 329, and in 1881 they were 520.It seems probable,
as suggested in the above report of the Registrar-General, that this
apparently increasing large death-rate is due to increased accuracy in
diagnosis.It may be also that decrease in infant mortality and
prolongation of life by improved sanitary regulations may account in
part for this increase.From this point of view Dunn makes the
paradoxical statement that the cancer-rate of a country may be accepted
as an index of its healthfulness (_Brit.Journ._, 1883, i.).]It is said on good authority that in Egypt and Turkey gastric cancer
and other forms of cancer are infrequent.[27] A similar infrequency has
been claimed for South America, the Indies, and in general for tropical
and subtropical countries; but all of these statements as to the
geographical distribution of cancer are to be accepted with great
reserve, as they do not rest upon sufficient statistical information.[Footnote 27: Hirsch, _Handb.d. Historisch-geographische Pathologie_,
Bd.379, Erlangen, 1862-64.]I have analyzed the frequency of gastric cancer among <DW64>s upon a
basis of 7518 deaths among this race in New York, and I find the
proportion of deaths from this cause about one-third less than among
white persons.[28] It has been stated that cancer is an extremely rare
disease among <DW64>s in Africa.[29] The admixture with white blood
makes it difficult to determine to what degree pure <DW64>s in this
country are subject to cancer.[Footnote 28: According to the Ninth Census Report of the United
States, in the census year 1870 the deaths from cancer among white
persons were 13.7 per mille, and among <DW52> persons only 5.7 per
mille; but it is well known that the registration returns upon which
the vital statistics in these reports are based are very incomplete and
unsatisfactory.][Footnote 29: Bordier, _La Geographie medicale_, Paris, 1884, p.Livingstone speaks of the infrequency of cancer among the <DW64>s in
Africa.]The question as to what role is played by heredity in the causation of
gastric cancer belongs to the etiological study of cancer in general.of the cases of cancer it can be
determined that other members of the family are or have been affected
with the disease.[30] {536} The influence of inheritance, therefore, is
apparent only in a comparatively small minority of the cases.As
suggested long ago by Matthew Baillie, this hereditary influence is
better interpreted as in favor of a local predisposition (embryonic
abnormality?)in the organ or part affected than in favor of the
inheritance of a cancerous diathesis.It has been claimed by D'Espine,
Paget, and others that cancer develops at an earlier age when there is
a family history of the disease than when such history is absent.[Footnote 30: This statement is based upon the collection of 1744 cases
of cancer analyzed with reference to this question.Of these, a family
history of cancer was determined in 243 cases.The cases are obtained
from statistics of Paget and Baker, Sibley, Moore, Cooke, Lebert,
Lafond, Hess, Leichtenstern, Von Winiwarter, and Oldekop.There is
extraordinary variation in the conclusions of different observers upon
this point.Velpeau asserted that he could trace hereditary taint in 1
in 3 cancerous subjects; Paget, in 1 in 4; Cripps, in 1 in 28.My
conclusions agree with those obtained at the London Cancer Hospital
(Cooke, _On Cancer_, p.The most remarkable instance of inherited cancer on record is reported
by Broca (_Traite des Tumeurs_, vol.151, Paris, 1866): 15 out of
26 descendants over thirty years of age of a woman who died in 1788 of
cancer of the breast were likewise affected with cancer.As is well
known, Napoleon the First, his father, and his sister died of cancer of
the stomach.]It may be considered established that cancer sometimes develops in a
simple ulcer of the stomach, either open or cicatrized.It is most
likely to develop in large and deep ulcers with thickened edges, where
complete closure by cicatrization is very difficult or impossible.It
is difficult to prove anatomically that a gastric cancer has developed
from an ulcer, and hence such statements as that of Eppinger, that in
11.4 per cent.of cancers of the stomach this mode of development
existed, are of no especial value.[31] No etiological importance can be
attached to the occasional association of cancer with open or
cicatrized simple ulcers in different parts of the same stomach.Of the
comparatively few cases in which strict anatomical proof has been
brought of the origin of cancer in simple gastric ulcer, probably the
most carefully investigated and conclusive is one studied and reported
by Hauser.[32] It is, however, by no means proven that Hauser's view is
correct, that cancer develops from the atypical epithelial growths
often to be found in the cicatricial tissue of gastric ulcer.In a few
instances both the clinical history and the anatomical appearances
speak decisively for the development of cancer in a simple gastric
ulcer;[33] and the establishment of this fact is of clinical
importance.[Footnote 31: _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.[Footnote 32: _Das chronische Maqengeschwur_, Leipzig, 1883, p.See
also Heitler, "Entwicklung von Krebs auf narbigen Grunde in Magen,"
_Wien.Wochenschr._, 1883, p.It seems to me that at present
there is a tendency to exaggerate the frequency with which cancer
develops from gastric ulcer.][Footnote 33: A particularly satisfactory case of this kind is reported
by Lebert, _op.Many other factors in the causation of gastric cancer have been
alleged, but without proof of their efficacy.This is true of chronic
gastritis, which was once thought to be an important cause of gastric
cancer, and is even recently admitted by Leube to be of influence.[34]
Certainly the majority of cases of cancer of the stomach are not
preceded by symptoms of chronic gastritis.Although in a few instances
gastric cancer has followed an injury in the region of the stomach,
there is no reason to suppose that this was more than a coincidence.[Footnote 34: In _Ziemssen's Handb.Few, if any, at present believe that depressing emotions, such as
grief, anxiety, disappointment, which were once considered important
causes of cancer, exert any such influence.Cancer of the stomach
occurs as {537} frequently in those of strong as in those of weak
constitution--as often among the temperate as among the intemperate.If, as has been claimed (D'Espine), gastric cancer is relatively more
frequent among the rich than among the poor, this is probably due only
to the fact that a larger number of those in favorable conditions of
life attain the age at which there is greatest liability to this
disease.No previous condition of constitution, no previous disease, no
occupation, no station in life, can be said to exert any causative
influence in the production of gastric cancer.It will be observed that the obscurity which surrounds the ultimate
causation of gastric cancer is in no way cleared up by the points which
have been here considered and which are usually considered under the
head of etiology.It is impossible to avoid the assumption of an
individual--and in my opinion a local--predisposition to gastric
cancer, vague as this assumption appears.All other supposed causes are
at the most merely occasional or exciting causes.The attempts to
explain in what this predisposition consists are of a speculative
nature, and will be briefly considered in connection with the
pathenogenesis of gastric cancer.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--We may distinguish the following groups of cases of
gastric cancer:

First: Latent cases, in which the cancer of the stomach has produced no
symptoms up to the time of death.Many secondary cancers of the stomach
belong to this class.Here also belong cases in which a cancer is found
unexpectedly in the stomach when death has resulted from other causes.I have found a medullary cancer, slightly ulcerated, as large as a
hen's egg, seated upon the posterior wall and lesser curvature of the
stomach of a laboring man suddenly killed while in apparent health and
without previous complaint of gastric disturbance.These cases, in
which life is cut short before any manifestation of the disease, are
without clinical significance, save to indicate how fallacious it is to
estimate the duration of the cancerous growth from the first appearance
of the symptoms.Second: Cases in which gastric symptoms are absent or insignificant,
whereas symptoms of general marasmus or of progressive anaemia or of
cachectic dropsy are prominent.Cases of this class are frequently
mistaken for pernicious anaemia, and occasionally for Bright's disease,
heart disease, or phthisis.It is difficult to explain in these cases
the tolerance of the stomach for the cancerous growth, but this
tolerance is most frequently manifested when the tumor does not invade
the orifices of the organ.Third: Cases in which the symptoms of the primary gastric cancer are
insignificant, but the symptoms of secondary cancer, particularly of
cancer of the liver or of the peritoneum, predominate.In some, but not
in all, of these cases the primary growth is small or has spared the
orifices of the stomach.Fourth: Cases in which the symptoms point to some disease of the
stomach, or at least to some abdominal disease; but the absence of
characteristic symptoms renders the diagnosis of gastric cancer
impossible or only conjectural.Fifth: Typical cases in which symptoms sufficiently characteristic of
{538} gastric cancer are present, so that the diagnosis can be made
with reasonable positiveness.It is not to be understood that these groups represent sharply-drawn
types of the disease.It often happens that the same case may present
at one period the features of one group, and at another period those of
another group.Nor is it supposed that every exceptional and erratic
case of gastric cancer can be classified in any of the groups which
have been mentioned.[35]

[Footnote 35: In the thesis of Chesnel may be found many curious
clinical disguises which may be assumed by cancer of the stomach, such
as simulation of Bright's disease, heart disease, phthisis, chronic
bronchitis, cirrhosis of the liver, etc.(_Etude clinique sur le Cancer
latent de l'Estomac_, Paris, 1877).Annals Albany_, 1883,
p.207) reports a case of gastric cancer in which extra-uterine
foetation was suspected.]A typical case of gastric cancer runs a course about as follows: A
person, usually beyond middle age, begins to suffer from disordered
digestion.His appetite is impaired, and a sense of uneasiness,
increasing in course of time to actual pain, is felt in the stomach.These symptoms of dyspepsia are in no way peculiar, and probably at
first occasion little anxiety.It is, however, soon observed that the
patient is losing flesh and strength more rapidly than can be explained
by simple indigestion.Vomiting, which was usually absent at first, makes its
appearance and becomes more and more frequent.After a while it may be
that, without any improvement, the vomiting becomes less frequent,
comes on longer after a meal, but is more copious.In the later periods
of the disease a substance resembling coffee-grounds and consisting of
altered blood is often mingled with the vomit.By this time the patient
has assumed a cachectic look.He is wasted, and his complexion has the
peculiar pale yellowish tint of malignant disease.Perhaps there is a
little oedematous pitting about the ankles.During the progress of the
disease in the majority of cases an irregular hard tumor can be felt in
the epigastrium.While one or another of the symptoms may abate in
severity, the general progress of the disease is relentlessly downward.Within six months to two years of the onset of the symptoms the patient
dies of exhaustion.Too much stress should not be laid upon any so-called typical course of
gastric cancer.This course is modified by many circumstances, such as
the situation of the cancer, its size, its rapidity of growth, the
presence or absence of ulceration, the existence or non-existence of
secondary tumors, the presence of complications, and the individuality
of the patient.It is necessary, therefore, to consider in detail each
of the important symptoms of gastric cancer.But in thus fixing
attention upon individual symptoms one must not lose sight of the
clinical picture as a whole.It is not any single symptom which is
decisive; it is rather the combination, the mode of onset, and the
course of the symptoms, which are of most importance in diagnosis.Impairment of the appetite is the rule in gastric cancer.Anorexia is
sometimes a marked symptom before pain, vomiting, and other evidences
of gastric indigestion are noted.There is often a special distaste for
meat.The appetite may be capricious; it is very rarely even increased.There are exceptional cases in which the appetite is preserved
throughout the greater part or even the whole course of the disease.This seems to {539} be more frequent with cancer of the cardia than
with cancer of other parts of the stomach.Loss of appetite is a much
more common symptom in gastric cancer than in gastric ulcer.In cancer,
as well as in ulcer, the patient sometimes refrains from food less on
account of disrelish for it than on account of the distress which it
causes him.Pain is one of the most frequent symptoms of cancer of the stomach.If
the pain begins early in the disease, and continues, as it often does,
with increasing severity, it renders gastric cancer one of the most
distressing affections.The pain is usually felt in the epigastrium,
but it may be more intense in the hypochondria.It is sometimes felt in
the interscapular region, the shoulders, or even in the loins.[36] With
cancer of the cardia it is often referred to the point of the xiphoid
cartilage or behind the sternum.In general, however, there is so
little correspondence between the site of the cancer and the exact
locality of the pain that no weight can be attached to the situation of
the pain in diagnosing the region of the stomach involved in the
growth.Nor does any import attach to the quality of the pain, whether
it is described as burning, gnawing, dull, lancinating, etc.Severe
gastralgic paroxysms occur, although less frequently than in gastric
ulcer.[Footnote 36: The pain in cases of gastric cancer may be felt in parts
of the body remote from the stomach.Thus, in a case of cancer of the
cardia reported by Minot the pain was felt, not in the epigastrium, but
in the left shoulder, the back of the neck, and the pharynx.In several
instances the pain has been interpreted as of renal origin.In a case
of gastric cancer reported by Palmer each attack of vomiting was
invariably preceded by pain in the middle of the shaft of the left
humerus (_Extr.The pain is usually aggravated by ingestion of food, although it may
not become severe until the process of digestion is far advanced.Pain,
however, occurs independently of taking food, and is occasionally a
marked symptom when there are no evidences of dyspepsia.There can be
no doubt that the cancer, as such, produces pain by involvement of the
nerves of the stomach, but there is no specific cancerous pain, such as
has been described by Brinton and other writers.There is usually
tenderness on pressure over the stomach, and this tenderness is often
over the tumor, if such can be felt.In general, it may be said that the pain of gastric cancer, as
contrasted with that of simple gastric ulcer, is often less dependent
upon taking food, less intense, less circumscribed, less paroxysmal,
less often relieved by vomiting; but there is so little constancy about
any of these points that no reliance is to be placed upon any
peculiarity of the pain in the diagnosis of gastric cancer.The observation of several cases of gastric cancer without pain as a
marked symptom leads me to emphasize the fact that absence or trifling
severity of pain throughout the greater part or the whole of the
disease, although exceptional, is not extremely rare.The frequency of
painless gastric cancers is given by Lebert as 25 per cent., and by
Brinton as 8 per cent., of the whole number.For many reasons,
numerical computations as to the frequency of this and of other
symptoms of gastric cancer are of very limited value.[37] Absence of
pain is more common in {540} gastric cancers of old persons and in
cancers not involving the orifices of the stomach than it is at an
earlier period of life or when the gastric orifices are obstructed.[Footnote 37: Gastric cancer cannot be considered as a disease with
uniform characters.It is irrational to group together cancers of the
pylorus, of the cardia, of the fundus, of the curvatures, cancers hard
and soft, ulcerated and not ulcerated, infiltrating and circumscribed,
and to say that pain or vomiting is present in so-and-so many cases of
cancer of the stomach.There is not a sufficient number of recorded
cases in which the symptoms are fully described with reference to the
peculiarities of the growth to enable us to apply to gastric cancer the
numerical method of clinical study with valuable results.The great
discrepancy between Lebert's and Brinton's statistics as to the
frequency of painless cancers of the stomach illustrates the present
inadequacy of the numerical method, which is misleading in so far as it
gives a false appearance of exactness.]The functions of the stomach are almost invariably disordered in
gastric cancer.Sometimes, especially in the early stages, this
disorder is only moderate, and is manifested by the milder symptoms of
indigestion, such as uneasy sensations of weight and fulness after a
meal, nausea, flatulent distension of the stomach relieved by
eructation of gases, and heartburn.With the progress of the disease
the uneasy sensations become actually painful; watery fluids, and
sometimes offensive acrid fluids and gases, are regurgitated; and
nausea culminates in vomiting.The
eructation of inflammable gases has been observed in a few cases.The most troublesome symptoms of indigestion occur with those cancers
which by obstructing the pyloric orifice lead to dilatation of the
stomach.Cases of gastric cancer in which the distressing symptoms of
dilatation of the stomach dominate the clinical history are frequent.These symptoms are in no way peculiar to cancer of the stomach, but
belong to dilatation produced by pyloric stenosis from whatever cause,
and will be described in the article on DILATATION OF THE STOMACH.Various causes combine to impair the normal performance of the gastric
functions in cancer of the stomach.Chronic catarrhal gastritis is a
factor in not a few cases.The destruction by the cancer of a certain
amount of secreting surface can be adduced as a sufficient cause only
in exceptional cases of extensive cancerous infiltration.Of more
importance is interference with the peristaltic movements of the
stomach, particularly in the pyloric region, where the cancer is most
frequently situated.As already mentioned, dilatation of the stomach is
a most important cause of indigestion in many cases.Of great interest
in this connection is the discovery by Von den Velden[38] that as a
rule (to which there are exceptions) the gastric juice in cases of
dilatation of the stomach due to cancer contains no free hydrochloric
acid, and that this gastric juice has comparatively feeble digestive
power, as proven by experiments.As this alteration of the gastric
juice interferes particularly with the digestion of albuminous
substances, it is explicable why many patients with gastric cancer have
an especial abhorrence for meat.[Footnote 38: _Deutsches Arch.During the progress of the disease the dyspeptic symptoms may improve,
but this improvement is usually only temporary.In exceptional cases of
gastric cancer dyspeptic symptoms, as well as other gastric symptoms,
may be absent or not sufficiently marked to attract attention.Hiccough, sometimes very troublesome, has been observed not very
infrequently during the later periods of the disease.There is nothing noteworthy about the appearance of the tongue, which
is often clean and moist, but may be furred or abnormally red and dry.In the cachectic stage, toward the end of the disease, aphthous patches
{541} often appear on the tongue and buccal mucous membrane.An
increased flow of saliva has been occasionally observed in gastric
cancer as well as in other diseases of the stomach.Thirst is present
when there is profuse vomiting.Vomiting usually appears after other symptoms of indigestion have been
present for some time.It may, however, be one of the earliest symptoms
of the disease.At first of occasional occurrence, it increases in
frequency until in some cases it becomes the most prominent of all
symptoms.Vomiting may occur in paroxysms which last for several days
or weeks, and then this symptom may improve, perhaps to be renewed
again and again, with remissions of comparative comfort.There are rare
cases of gastric cancer in which the first symptom to attract attention
is uncontrollable vomiting, accompanied often with pain and rapid
emaciation.Such cases may run so acute a course that a fatal
termination is reached within one to two months.[39] In these cases,
which have been interpreted as acutely-developed gastric cancers, it is
probable that the cancer has remained latent for weeks or months before
it gave rise to marked symptoms.[Footnote 39: For example, Andral relates a case in which death took
place thirty-seven days after the onset of the symptoms, these being
obstinate vomiting, severe gastralgic paroxysms, marasmus, and, about
ten days before death, profuse black vomit.There was found a fungoid
tumor the size of a hen's egg projecting into the cavity of the stomach
near the pylorus.In this situation the walls of the stomach were
greatly thickened by colloid growth (_Arch.Here may also be mentioned the fact that in several instances pregnancy
has been complicated with gastric cancer.Here the uncontrollable
vomiting which often exists has been referred to the pregnancy, and has
led to the production of premature labor.]The situation of the cancer exerts great influence upon the frequency
of vomiting and the time of its occurrence after meals.When the cancer
involves the pyloric orifice, vomiting is rarely absent, and generally
occurs an hour or more after a meal.As this is the most frequent
situation of the cancer, it has been accepted as a general rule that
vomiting occurs at a longer interval after eating in cases of gastric
cancer than in cases of simple ulcer.But even with pyloric cancer the
vomiting may come on almost immediately after taking food, so that it
is not safe to diagnose the position of the cancer by the length of
time between eating and the occurrence of vomiting.As the cancer in
its growth obstructs more and more the pyloric orifice, the vomiting
acquires the peculiarities of that accompanying dilatation of the
stomach.The vomiting comes on longer after a meal--sometimes not until
twelve or twenty hours or even more have elapsed.It may be that
several days elapse between the acts of vomiting, which then present a
certain periodicity.The patient then vomits enormous quantities
containing undigested food, mucus, sarcinae, and gaseous and other
products of fermentation.Sometimes, especially toward the end of the
disease, the vomiting ceases altogether.This cessation has been
attributed to reopening of the pyloric orifice by sloughing of the
growth.It is not necessary to assume such an occurrence, as a similar
cessation of vomiting sometimes occurs in dilatation of the stomach due
to persistent stenosis of the pylorus.Cessation of vomiting in these
cases is by no means always a favorable symptom.Next to pyloric cancer, it is cancer involving the cardiac orifice
which is most frequently accompanied by vomiting.Here the vomiting
occurs often immediately after taking food, but there are exceptions to
this rule.{542} If in consequence of stenosis of the cardiac orifice
the food does not enter the stomach, it is shortly regurgitated
unchanged or mingled simply with mucus.It is this regurgitation rather
than actual vomiting which in most common and characteristic of cardiac
cancer.Even in cases in which the passage of an oesophageal sound
reveals no obstruction at the cardiac orifice it sometimes happens that
food, including even liquids, is regurgitated almost immediately, as in
a case reported by Ebstein in which cold water was returned at once
after swallowing.[40] In these cases Ebstein with great plausibility
refers the regurgitation to reflex spasm of the oesophagus induced by
irritation of a cancer at or near the cardia through contact of food or
liquids, especially when cold, with its surface.[Footnote 40: "Ueber den Magenkrebs," _Volkmann's Samml.When the cancer is seated in other parts of the stomach and it does not
obstruct the orifices, vomiting is more frequently absent or of only
rare occurrence.Vomiting is absent, according to Lebert, in one-fifth,
according to Brinton in about one-eighth, of the cases of gastric
cancer.Absence of vomiting is sufficiently frequent in gastric cancer
to guard one against excluding the diagnosis of this disease on this
ground alone.Although in many cases the vomiting of gastric cancer can be explained
on mechanical grounds by stenosis of the orifices, this is an
explanation not applicable to all cases.Mention has already been made
of spasm of the oesophagus as a cause of regurgitation of food in some
cases of cardiac cancer.A similar spasm of the muscle in the pyloric
region may explain the vomiting in certain cases in which during life
there were symptoms of pyloric stenosis, but after death no or slight
stenosis can be found.There is reason also to believe that atony of
the muscular coats of the stomach may cause stagnation of the contents
of the stomach and dilatation of the organ.In exceptional cases of
gastric cancer in which the stomach is so intolerant as to reject food
almost immediately after its entrance a special irritability of the
nerves of the stomach must be assumed.It is customary to refer this
form of vomiting to irritation of the ulcerated surface of the cancer
by analogy with a similar irritability of the stomach observed in some
cases of simple gastric ulcer.But there is little analogy between the
ulcerated surface of a cancer in which tissues of little vitality and
irritability are exposed and the surface of a simple ulcer in which the
normal or slightly altered tissues of the stomach are laid bare.Finally, in the existence of chronic catarrhal gastritis is to be found
another cause of vomiting in many cases of gastric cancer.The presence of fragments of the cancer in the contents removed by
washing out the stomach with the stomach-tube has been observed by
Rosenbach[41] in three cases of gastric cancer, and utilized for
diagnostic purposes.A cancerous structure could be made out in these
fragments by the aid of the microscope.Hitherto, the presence of
particles of the tumor in the vomited matter has been considered as
hardly more than a curiosity, and I have not been able to find a
well-authenticated instance in which such particles in the vomit have
been recognized by microscopical examination.According to Rosenbach,
the fragments of the tumor in the washings from the stomach can be
recognized by the naked eye by the red, reddish-brown, or black specks
on their surface, due to recent or old hemorrhages which have aided in
the detachment of the fragments.{543} By this means such particles are
distinguished macroscopically from bits of food.By employing
soft-rubber tubes and the syphon process there is no danger, in washing
out of the stomach, of detaching pieces of the normal mucous membrane,
which, moreover, can be distinguished from the fragments of the tumor
by the aid of the microscope and usually by the naked eye.It remains
to be seen how frequently such fragments of the tumor are to be found
in the fluids obtained by washing out the stomach.It is not probable
that they will be found so often as Rosenbach anticipates.According to
the experience of most observers, they are very rarely present.They
would naturally be most readily detached from soft, fungoid, and
ulcerating cancerous growths.In this connection may also be mentioned
the occasional separation of bits of the tumor by the passage of the
stomach-tube in cases of cancer of the cardia.The eye of the tube as
well as the washings from the stomach should be carefully examined for
such particles.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.The habitual absence of free hydrochloric acid in the gastric fluids in
dilatation of the stomach due to carcinoma of this organ was noted by
Von der Velden.[42] He found in eight cases of dilatation due to cancer
of the pylorus that the fluids removed by the stomach-pump were free
from hydrochloric acid, whereas in ten cases of dilatation due to other
causes, such as cicatrized simple ulcer of the pylorus, free
hydrochloric acid was only temporarily absent from the gastric juice.Von der Velden therefore attributes to the presence or the absence of
free hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice in these cases great
diagnostic importance.The observations which have followed Von der
Velden's publication are not yet sufficient to justify us in drawing
positive conclusions in this matter.Recently, Kredel[43] has reported
from Riegel's clinic seventeen cases of simple dilatation in which free
hydrochloric acid was only exceptionally and temporarily absent from
the gastric fluids, and nineteen cases of cancerous dilatation in
which, with very rare exceptions, free hydrochloric acid was
continuously absent.Cases, however, have been observed by Ewald,
Seeman, and others in which free hydrochloric acid has been found in
stomachs dilated from gastric cancer.It is to be noted that free
hydrochloric acid is absent from the stomach in other conditions than
in gastrectasia due to cancer; of which conditions the most important
are fever, amyloid degeneration of the stomach (Edinger), and some
cases of gastric catarrh.Free hydrochloric acid is also usually absent
during the first twenty minutes to an hour after a meal.We have not
sufficient information as to the presence or absence of free
hydrochloric acid in cases of gastric cancer without dilatation of the
stomach.To Von der Velden's symptom no pathognomonic value can be
attached, but it may prove, in connection with other symptoms, an aid
in diagnosis.The presumption is against gastric cancer if free
hydrochloric acid be found continuously in a dilated stomach.Less
importance can be attached to the absence of free hydrochloric acid
unless the observations extend over several weeks and fever and amyloid
degeneration are excluded.[Footnote 42: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 43: _Zeitschrift f. klin.The tests for free hydrochloric acid are most satisfactorily applied to
the fluids withdrawn by the stomach-pump.After a sufficient quantity
for examination has been withdrawn the syphon process may be {544}
substituted.Tests may also be applied to vomited material, although
here the admixture of secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat may
render the results less conclusive.Edinger's method of swallowing bits
of sponge enclosed in gelatin capsules and attached to a string, by
which they can be withdrawn, may also be employed.The sponge should be
free from sand, deprived of alkaline carbonates by hydrochloric acid,
and rendered perfectly neutral by washing in distilled water.For clinical purposes the most convenient tests are those which depend
upon certain changes in color produced in reagents which enable us to
distinguish inorganic from organic acids.In the gastric juice the only
inorganic acid which comes into consideration is hydrochloric acid, and
the most important organic acid is lactic.Saturated aqueous solutions of tropaeolin, marked in the trade OO
(Von Miller, V. d. Velden).The solution should be perfectly clear and
of a lemon-yellow color.This solution is  red by the addition
of hydrochloric acid even in very dilute solution (0.01 per cent.).A
similar change in color is produced by lactic acid in somewhat less
dilute solution (0.06 per cent.), but the red color produced by lactic
acid disappears upon shaking with ether, while that produced by
hydrochloric acid remains, unless the acid was present in very minute
quantity.Tropaeolin is therefore a very delicate test for free acid in
general, but it does not distinguish so well as some other tests
hydrochloric from lactic acid.Aqueous solution of methyl-violet (an aniline dye) in the strength
of 0.025 per cent.The solution should be of a violet
color, and in a test-tube should allow the light to pass readily
through it.The addition of hydrochloric acid in dilute solution
changes the violet to a blue color, in stronger solution to a greenish
tint.With lactic acid in stronger solution methyl-violet gives a
similar but less distinct reaction.Methyl-violet, while a less
delicate test than tropaeolin, is better adapted for distinguishing
hydrochloric from lactic acid.Ferric chloride and carbolic acid test (Uffelmann).Mix 3 drops of
liquor ferri chloridi (German Pharmacopoeia, specific gravity 1482), 3
drops of very concentrated solution of carbolic acid, and 20 ccm.The addition of even very dilute solutions of lactic
acid (0.05 per cent.)changes the amethyst-blue color of this
test-fluid to a yellow color, with a shade of green.Dilute solutions
of hydrochloric acid produce a steel-gray, and stronger solutions a
complete decolorization of the fluid.When both hydrochloric and lactic
acids are present the effect of the lactic acid predominates unless
only a mere trace of it is present.This is therefore a good test for
lactic acid.It is necessary to prepare the test-fluid fresh each time
before using.It is well to test the digestive power of the filtered fluid from
the stomach by suspending in the fluid a floccule of washed fibrin and
keeping the fluid at a temperature of about 100 degrees F. If free
hydrochloric acid be present in moderate quantity, in a short time the
fibrin will begin to be dissolved, but if the acidity be due to organic
acid the fibrin will be dissolved very slowly or not at all.In applying these various tests the fluids from the stomach should be
filtered and the filtrate used.It is best not to rely upon a single
test, but to employ them in combination.The fluids may be mixed in a
test-tube.The reaction is sometimes most distinct when the fluids are
allowed {545} to mingle upon a white porcelain dish.It is sometimes of
advantage to concentrate the mingled fluids by evaporation.The fluid
obtained by the stomach-pump five or six hours after a meal is the most
suitable for diagnostic tests.The presence of peptones and of
dissolved albumen makes the tests less delicate for the gastric fluids
than for simple aqueous solutions of the acids.[44]

It is important to distinguish between the slight and the copious
hemorrhages of gastric cancer.The admixture of a small quantity of blood with the vomit, giving to
the latter the so-called coffee-grounds appearance, is a very common
occurrence in gastric cancer.Melaenamesis, as the vomiting of brown or
black substance resembling coffee-grounds is called, is estimated to
occur in about one-half of the cases of cancer of the stomach.It is
observed particularly in the cachectic stage, in which it is not rare
for some brown or black sediment to be almost constantly present in the
vomit.The brown or black color is due to the conversion by the acids
of the stomach of the normal blood-coloring matter into dark-brown
haematin.The presence of blood in the vomited matter can generally be recognized
by the naked eye.By the aid of the microscope red blood-corpuscles,
more or less changed, especially decolorized red blood-corpuscles (the
so-called shadows), can usually be detected.Sometimes only amorphous
masses of altered blood-pigment can be seen.The spectroscope may also
be employed, in which alkaline solutions of haematin produce an
absorption-band between C and D, usually reaching or passing D. The
presence of blood-coloring matter can also be readily detected by the
production of haemin crystals.[45] The slight hemorrhages are in most
cases the result of ulceration of the cancer, by which process a little
oozing of blood from the capillaries is produced.[Footnote 45: Haemin crystals may be produced by boiling in a test-tube
a little of the suspected fluid or sediment with an excess of glacial
acetic acid and a few particles of common salt.After cooling, a drop
from the lower layers will show under the microscope the dark-brown
rhombic crystals of haemin in case blood-coloring matter was present in
not too minute quantity.]Copious hemorrhages from the stomach are not common in gastric cancer.They occur probably in not over 12 per cent.According to Lebert, they are more liable to occur in males than in
females.Blood vomited in large quantity is either bright red or more
or less darkened in color according to the length of its sojourn in the
stomach.Following profuse haematemesis, some dark, tarry blood is
usually passed by the stools, constituting the symptom called melaena.Copious hemorrhages from the stomach hasten the fatal termination and
may be its immediate forerunner.Cases of gastric cancer have been
reported in which death has occurred from gastrorrhagia before there
has been time for any blood to be either vomited or voided by stool.As
might naturally be expected, patients with gastric cancer do not
usually rally as readily from the effects of gastric hemorrhage as do
most patients with simple ulcer.Profuse gastric hemorrhage, if it
occur, is most common in the late stage of gastric cancer, but I have
known a {546} case of cancer of the stomach in which copious
haematemesis was the first symptom, with the exception of slight
dyspepsia.[46]

[Footnote 46: In a case of cancer of the lesser curvature observed by
Laborie fatal haematemesis occurred before there had been any distinct
symptoms of gastric cancer (Bouchut, _Nouv.Profuse haematemesis is more common with soft cancers than with other
forms.The source of profuse hemorrhage is in some large vessel eroded
by the ulcerative process.The same vessels may be the source of the
bleeding as have been enumerated in connection with gastric ulcer.Cancers situated near the pylorus or on the lesser curvature are the
most likely to cause severe hemorrhage.While it is true that coffee-grounds vomiting is most common in cancer,
and profuse haematemesis is most common in ulcer of the stomach, it is
important to remember that either disease may be attended by that form
of hemorrhage which is most common in the other.Dysphagia is one of the most important symptoms of cancer of the
cardia.Dysphagia is sometimes one of the first symptoms to attract
attention, but it may not appear until late in the disease.It is
usually accompanied with painful sensations near the xiphoid cartilage
or behind the sternum, or sometimes in the pharynx.The sensation of
stoppage of the food is usually felt lower down than in ordinary cases
of stenosis of the oesophagus.Stenosis of the cardia can be
appreciated by the passage of an oesophageal bougie, but it is
important to bear in mind that dysphagia may exist in cases of cancer
of the cardia in which the oesophageal bougie does not reveal evidence
of stenosis.Dysphagia may be a prominent symptom in cancer occupying
parts of the stomach remote from the cardia.[47] The dysphagia here
considered is not likely to be confounded with the difficulty in
swallowing which is due to weakness or to aphthous inflammation of the
throat and gullet, which often attends the last days of gastric cancer.[Footnote 47: A case in point has been reported by J. B. S. Jackson.The cancer occupied the pyloric region (_American Journ.Sci._,
April, 1852, p.From a diagnostic point of view the presence of a tumor is the most
important symptom of gastric cancer.In the absence of tumor the
diagnosis of gastric cancer can rarely be made with positiveness.A
tumor of the stomach can be felt in about 80 per cent.of the cases of
cancer of the stomach (Brinton, Lebert).With all of its importance, it
is nevertheless possible to exaggerate the diagnostic value of this
symptom.It is by no means always easy to determine whether an existing
tumor belongs to the stomach or not, and even if there is proved to be
a tumor of the stomach, there may be difficulty in deciding whether or
not it is a cancer.Many instances might be cited in which errors in
these respects have been made by experienced diagnosticians.The value
of tumor as a diagnostic symptom is somewhat lessened by the fact that
it often does not appear until comparatively late in the disease, so
that the diagnosis remains in doubt for a long time.It is to be
remembered also that tumor is absent in no less than one-fifth of the
cases of gastric cancer.In order to understand in what situations cancers of the stomach are
likely to produce palpable tumors, it is necessary to have in mind
certain points concerning the situation and the relations of this
organ.The stomach is placed obliquely in the left hypochondrium and the
epigastric regions of the abdomen, approaching the vertical more nearly
{547} than the horizontal position.The mesial plane of the body passes
through the pyloric portion of the stomach, so that, according to
Luschka, five-sixths of the stomach lie to the left of this plane.The
most fixed part of the stomach is the cardiac orifice, which lies
behind the left seventh costal cartilage, near the sternum, and is
overlapped by the left extremity of the liver.The pyloric orifice lies
usually in the sagittal plane passing through the right margin of the
sternum, and on a level with the inner extremity of the right eighth
costal cartilage.The pylorus is less fixed than the cardia.When the
stomach is empty the pylorus is to be found in the median line of the
body; when the stomach is greatly distended the pylorus may be pushed
two and a half to three inches to the right of the median line.The
pylorus is overlapped by a part of the liver, usually the lobus
quadratus or the umbilical fissure.About two-thirds of the stomach lie
in the left hypochondrium covered in by the ribs, and to the left and
posteriorly by the spleen.The highest point of the stomach is the top
of the fundus, which usually reaches to the left fifth rib.The lowest
point of the stomach is in the convexity of the greater curvature to
the left of the median line.The lower border of the stomach varies in
position more than any other part of the organ.In the median line this
border is situated on the average about midway between the base of the
xiphoid cartilage and the umbilicus, but within the limits of health it
may extend nearly to the umbilicus.The lesser curvature in the greater
part of its course extends from the cardia downward to the left of the
vertebral column and nearly parallel with it.The lesser curvature then
crosses to the right side on a level with the inner extremity of the
eighth rib, and in the median line lies about two and a half fingers'
breadth above the lower margin of the stomach.The lesser curvature and
the adjacent part of the anterior surface of the stomach are covered by
the left lobe of the liver.It follows from this description that only the lower part of the
anterior surface of the stomach is in contact with the anterior
abdominal walls.This part in contact with the anterior abdominal walls
corresponds to a part of the body and of the pyloric region of the
stomach, and belongs to the epigastric region.The remainder of the
stomach is covered either by the liver or by the ribs, so that in the
normal condition it cannot be explored by palpation.It is now evident that tumors in certain parts of the stomach can be
readily detected by palpation, whereas tumors in other parts of the
organ can be detected only with difficulty or not at all.Cancer of the
cardia cannot be felt by palpation of the abdomen unless the tumor
extends down upon the body of the stomach.Cancers of the fundus, the
lesser curvature, and the posterior wall of the stomach often escape
detection by palpation, but if they are of large size or if the stomach
becomes displaced by their growth, they may be felt.Cancerous tumors
of the anterior wall or of the greater curvature are rare, but they can
be detected even when of small size, unless there are special obstacles
to the physical examination of the abdomen.Cancerous tumors of the
pylorus can be made out by palpation in the majority of cases
notwithstanding the overlapping of this part by the liver.The pyloric
tumor may be so large as to project from beneath the border of the
liver, or the hand may be pressed beneath this border so that the tumor
can be felt, or, what is most frequently the {548} case, the weight of
the tumor or the distension of the stomach drags the pylorus downward.The pylorus may, however, be so fixed by adhesions underneath the
liver, or the liver may be so enlarged, that tumors of this part cannot
be reached by palpation.The situation in which cancerous tumors of the pylorus can be felt
varies considerably.The usual situation is in the lower part of the
epigastric region, a little to the right of the median line, but it is
almost as common for these tumors to be felt in the umbilical region,
and it is not rare for them to appear to the left of the median
line.[48] Brinton states that the tumor is in the umbilical region more
frequently in the female sex than in the male, in consequence of the
compression exercised by corsets.Occasionally pyloric cancers produce
tumors in the right hypochondrium.Exceptionally, pyloric tumors have
been felt as low as the iliac crest or even in the hypogastric region.[Footnote 48: According to Jackson and Tyson, pyloric cancers are felt
more frequently to the left than to the right of the median line.]Cancers of the stomach do not usually attain a very large size.An important criterion of
cancerous tumors of the stomach is their gradual increase in size by
progressive growth.The consistence of cancerous tumors of the stomach is nearly always
hard, as appreciated by palpation through the abdominal walls.The
surface of the tumor is usually nodulated or irregular, but
exceptionally it is smooth.The tumor may be movable or not, but in the
majority of cases it is rendered immovable by adhesions.Mobility of
the tumor, however, does not exclude the presence of adhesions.The
tumor sometimes follows the respiratory movements of the diaphragm,
especially when it is adherent to this structure or to the liver, but
more frequently the tumor is not affected or but slightly affected by
the movements of the diaphragm.If the tumor is not fixed by adhesions,
it may change its position somewhat according to the varying degrees of
distension of the stomach or in consequence of pressure of intestine
distended with gas or feces.In consequence of these movements or of an
overlying distended colon the tumor may even disappear temporarily.It
is possible that the tumor may lessen or disappear in consequence of
sloughing of the growth.[49] It is not rare for a certain amount of
pulsation to be communicated to the growth by the subjacent aorta.This
pulsation is most common with pyloric tumors.[Footnote 49: Symptoms which have been considered as diagnostic of
sloughing of stenosing cancers of the pylorus are diminution in the
size of the tumor, alleviation of the vomiting, hemorrhage, replacement
of obstinate constipation by diarrhoeal stools which often contain
blood, increased pain after eating, and rapid progress of cachexia.]The percussion note over the tumor is usually tympanitic dulness.Sometimes there is very little alteration over the tumor of the normal
tympanitic note belonging to the stomach; on the other hand,
exceptionally there is absolute flatness over the tumor.It is often of assistance in determining that a tumor belongs to the
pylorus to find dilatation of the stomach.An abnormal fulness of the
epigastric and umbilical regions may then be observed, and through the
abdominal walls, if thin, may be seen the peristaltic movements of the
stomach.Other signs and symptoms aid in the diagnosis of dilatation of
the stomach, and will be described in connection with this disease.{549} It is to be noted that what one takes to be the primary tumor of
the stomach is not so very rarely a secondary cancerous mass in the
stomach or in adjacent lymph-glands or in the peritoneum.Such nodules
may also increase the apparent size of the original tumor.As has been
pointed out by Rosenbach,[50] spasm of the muscular coat near a cancer
or an ulcer of the stomach may produce a false tumor or enlarge a real
tumor.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.The cancer, instead of appearing as a circumscribed tumor, may
infiltrate diffusely the gastric walls, and so escape detection.When
the greater part or the whole of the stomach is the seat of this
diffuse cancerous infiltration, a sense of abnormal resistance may be
appreciated by palpation in the epigastric region.In these cases the
stomach is often much shrunken in size.The outlines of the thickened
organ can sometimes be made out, but the physical signs do not suffice
for the diagnosis of cancer.With cancer of the cardia there is usually more or less atrophy of the
stomach, which is manifested by sinking in of the epigastric region.Sometimes the tumor eludes discovery on account of special obstacles to
the physical examination of the abdomen, such as a thick layer of fat
in the abdominal walls or a large quantity of ascitic fluid.Every aid
in the physical examination of the abdomen should be resorted to.The
patient should be examined while lying on his back with the utmost
possible relaxation of the abdominal walls.If necessary, he should
also be examined while standing or in the knee-elbow position.Sometimes a deep inspiration will force down a previously concealed
tumor.The emptying of a dilated stomach by means of a stomach-tube
will sometimes bring to prominence a gastric tumor.The inflation of the stomach by the development in it of carbonic acid
gas may render valuable assistance in the diagnosis of tumors of this
organ and of surrounding parts.This method has been recommended by W.
Ph.H. Wagner among others, and especially by Rosenbach.[51] From 20 to
30 grains of bicarbonate of soda and from 15 to 20 grains of tartaric
acid may be introduced into the stomach.The soda, dissolved in
lukewarm water, may be given first and followed by the acid in
solution, or, better, the mixed powders may be swallowed in the dry
state and followed by a tumblerful of water.Some persons require a
larger quantity of the powder in order to inflate the stomach.Occasionally the introduction of the effervescing powder fails to
produce any appreciable distension of the stomach.This negative result
may be due to the escape of the gas into the intestine in consequence
of incontinence of the pylorus--a condition which Ebstein[52] has
observed and described especially in connection with pyloric cancer.When this pyloric insufficiency exists the resulting tympanitic
distension of the intestine is a hindrance to palpation of tumors of
the stomach.Failure to secure distension of the stomach is not always
due to this cause.It may be necessary to make repeated trials of the
effervescing mixture.It is well to have a stomach-tube at hand to
evacuate the gas if this should cause much distress.H. Wagner, _Ueber die Percussion des Magens nach
Auftreibung mit Kohlensaure_, Marburg, 1869; O. Rosenbach, _Deutsche
med.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.[Footnote 52: W. Ebstein, _Volkmann's Samml.In some respects simpler and more easily controlled is the method of
{550} distending the stomach by injecting air into it through a
stomach-tube, as recommended by Runeberg.[53] For this purpose the
balloon of a Richardson's spray apparatus may be attached to a
soft-rubber stomach-tube.In this way the desired quantity of air can
be introduced and at any time allowed to escape through the tube.[Footnote 53: J. W. Runeberg, _Deutsches Arch.When the stomach has been inflated the contours of tumors of the
pylorus often become surprisingly distinct in consequence of the
changes in the position and the shape of the stomach.When the tumor is
fixed by adhesions, it may be possible to follow the contours of the
stomach into those of the tumor.False tumors produced by spasm of the
muscular walls of the stomach may be made to disappear by this
distension of the organ.This procedure enables one to distinguish
between tumors behind and those in front of the stomach, as the former
become indistinct or disappear when the stomach is inflated.By
bringing out the contours of the stomach the relations of the tumor to
surrounding organs may be rendered for the first time clear.Assistance
in diagnosis may also be afforded by distension of the colon with water
or with gas or with air, per rectum, in order to determine the course
of the colon and its relations to abdominal tumors (Mader, Ziemssen,
Runeberg).A manifest contraindication to distension of the stomach or
of the colon with gas exists if there is a suspicion that the coats of
these parts are so thinned by ulceration that they might rupture from
the distending force of the gas.There have been no cases recorded
where such an accident has happened.Only in exceptional cases are the bowels regular throughout the course
of gastric cancer.Constipation is the rule, and not infrequently there
is obstinate constipation.This is to be expected when the patient eats
little and vomits a great deal, or when there is stenosis of the
pylorus.In cancer, as in many other diseases of the stomach, the
peristaltic movements of the intestine are inclined to be sluggish.Occasional diarrhoea is also common in gastric cancer, being present,
according to Tripier,[54] at some period or other in over one-half the
cases.Constipation often gives place to diarrhoea during the last
months or during the last days of life.In other periods of the disease
diarrhoea not infrequently alternates with constipation.In rare cases
diarrhoea is an early symptom, and it may be present exceptionally
throughout the greater part of the disease.The irritation of
undigested food sometimes explains the diarrhoea.When diarrhoea is
persistent there probably exists catarrhal inflammation of the large
intestine, or in some instances there may be diphtheritic and
ulcerative inflammation of the colon, causing dysenteric symptoms
during the last stages of cancer of the stomach.[Footnote 54: "Etude clinique sur la Diarrhee dans le Cancer de
l'Estomac," _Lyon Med._, 1881, Nos.Black stools containing altered blood occur for some days after profuse
gastric hemorrhage.It is important to examine the stools for blood, as
bleeding may occur from cancer of the stomach without any vomiting of
blood.There is no change in the urine characteristic of gastric cancer.Deposits of urates are not uncommon.If there be profuse vomiting or
frequent washing out of the stomach, the urine often becomes alkaline
from fixed {551} alkali.[55] The amount of urea is diminished in
consequence of the slight activity of the nutritive processes of the
body.Rommelaere attaches unmerited diagnostic importance to this
diminution of urea.A similar diminution of urea occurs in other like
states of depressed nutrition.[Footnote 55: According to Quincke, when the acid in the stomach is not
hydrochloric acid, but organic acid resulting from fermentation, then
vomiting and washing out the stomach do not reduce the acidity of the
urine (_Zeitschrift f. klin.Albuminuria does not belong to the history of gastric cancer, although
a small quantity of albumen may be present in the urine as in other
anaemic and cachectic conditions.A larger quantity of albumen may be
due to parenchymatous and fatty degeneration of the kidney or to
chronic diffuse nephritis, which are infrequent but recognized
complications of gastric cancer.There is often an excess of indican in
the urine, to which, however, no diagnostic significance can be
attached.The urine in gastric cancer sometimes contains an excess of aceton, or
at least of some substance which yields aceton upon the application of
various tests.This so-called acetonuria is present without any
symptoms referable to it, so far as we know.Allied to this so-called
acetonuria is that condition of the urine in which it is 
burgundy-red upon the addition of ferric chloride in solution
(Gerhardt's reaction).It is not positively known what substance
imparts this last reaction to the urine.V. Jaksch, who has studied the
subject industriously, believes that the red coloring substance is
diacetic acid, and he proposes to call the condition diaceturia.Fresh
urine, which shows in a marked degree Gerhardt's reaction, often has a
peculiar aromatic, fruity odor, as has also the expired air.Gerhardt's
reaction has been studied mostly in diabetic urine, but it occurs
sometimes in cases of gastric cancer and in a variety of diseases.This
so-called diaceturia may be associated with a peculiar form of coma,
but it is oftener observed without any symptoms referable to it[56]
(see page 555).[Footnote 56: The various tests for aceton in the urine are not
altogether satisfactory.They are to be found in an article by Von
Jaksch in the _Zeitschrift f. klin.For
English readers a good abstract of an article by Penzoldt on these
tests and on acetonaemia in general is to be found in _The Medical
News_ of Philadelphia, Aug.162, but this does not consider
the corrections and additions to be found in V. Jaksch's article cited
above.Acetonuria has been observed especially in diabetes mellitus,
fevers, carcinoma, and dyspepsia.The substance which produces Gerhardt's reaction is to be distinguished
from other substances which may be present in the urine and give a red
color with ferric chloride--first, by the fact that boiling the urine
in a test-tube for five or six minutes destroys the first-named
substance, or causes the red color to disappear in case this has been
produced by ferric chloride; and, secondly, by the fact that ether
extracts the substance from acidified urine, and that the red color
produced in the ether extract by ferric chloride (it may be necessary
to first neutralize the acid) fades away in the course of a few days
(V. Jaksch, _Zeitschrift f. Heilkunde_, Bd.Urines which
respond to Gerhardt's reaction in a marked degree yield aceton on
distillation, but aceton or an aceton-yielding substance may be present
in considerable quantity without response of the urine to Gerhardt's
test.]Disorders of nutrition embrace an important group of symptoms, such as
loss of flesh and strength, impoverished blood, and cachectic color of
the skin.Emaciation and debility are sometimes the first symptoms of
gastric cancer to attract attention, and often the first symptoms to
arouse anxiety.More frequently these symptoms of disordered nutrition
first appear after dyspeptic ailments or pain have existed for several
weeks or months.It may aid in the diagnosis of gastric cancer to weigh
the patient {552} from time to time, as carcinoma is generally attended
by progressive loss of weight.The patient frequently becomes morose and depressed in spirits.His
strength fails, sometimes disproportionately to the loss of flesh.There is no disease in which emaciation becomes more extreme than in
cases of gastric cancer.In many cases profound anaemia develops, and sometimes in such a degree
that this symptom cannot be regarded always as simply co-ordinate with
the other disorders of nutrition, but is to be regarded rather as an
evidence of some special disturbance of the blood-forming organs.The
blood may present the same changes as are observed in pernicious
anaemia, such as extreme reduction in the number of red
blood-corpuscles (to one million or even half that number in a cubic
millimeter) and manifold deformed shapes of the corpuscles
(poikilocytosis).In extreme cases the proportion of haemoglobin in the
blood may be reduced to 50 or 60 per cent.[57]
There is occasionally a moderate increase in the number of white
blood-corpuscles.In one case of gastric cancer I observed a
leucocytosis in which there was one white to twenty red
blood-corpuscles without enlargement of the spleen.[58]

[Footnote 57: The granular disintegrating corpuscles
(Zerfallskorperchen of Riess) may also be found in the blood in
considerable number.Leichtenstern has observed that toward the end of
life the relative proportion of haemoglobin in the blood may be
increased, sometimes rapidly, and may even exceed the normal limit.This is due to concentration of the blood in consequence of the loss of
water.In such cases the tissues appear abnormally dry and the blood
thick and tarry at the autopsy (_Ziemssen's Handb.u.
Therap._, Bd.It seems to me proper to distinguish two kinds of anaemia in gastric
cancer--a simple anaemia, which is present in the majority of cases,
and can be explained by the development of the cancer and the
disturbance of the gastric functions; and a pernicious anaemia, which
is present only in exceptional cases, and has the typical symptoms of
progressive pernicious anaemia.][Footnote 58: In a case of large medullary cancer of the stomach
reported by H. Mayer there was one white to fifty red blood-corpuscles.The spleen was not enlarged (Bayer, _Aerztl.Intelligenzblatt_, 1870,
No.A similar case is related by Lebert, in which, however, the
spleen was enlarged (_op.To the pallor of anaemia is added often a faded yellowish tint of the
skin which is considered characteristic of the cancerous cachexia.At
the same time, the skin is frequently dry and harsh, and may present
brownish spots (chloasma cachecticorum).The pallid lips, the pale
greenish-yellow color of the face, the furrowed lines, and the pinched
and despondent expression make up a characteristic physiognomy, which,
however, is neither peculiar to gastric cancer nor present in all cases
of the disease.There is no cachectic appearance which is pathognomonic
of cancer; and in this connection it is well to note that there are
cases of gastric ulcer, and particularly of non-cancerous stenosis of
the pylorus, in which all of the symptoms described as peculiar to the
cancerous cachexia are met with.Nevertheless, the weight of these
symptoms in the diagnosis of gastric cancer should not be
underestimated.There is no disease in which profound cachectic
symptoms so frequently and so rapidly develop as in gastric cancer.The profound nutritive disturbances of gastric cancer are referable
partly to the cancer as such, and partly to the impairment of the
functions of the stomach.It is impossible to separate the effects of
these two sets of causes, and distinguish, as some have done, a
cachexia of cancer {553} and a cachexia of inanition.It is the
combination of these causes which renders the cachexia of cancer of the
stomach so common, so rapid in its development, and so profound as
compared with that of cancer in other situations.The relation of
cancer in general to cachexia need not here be discussed, save to say
that there is the best ground for believing that the cachexia is
directly dependent upon the growth and metamorphoses of the primary
cancer and its metastases, and that there is not reason to assume any
dyscrasia antedating the cancerous formation.While the failure of the general health and the gastric symptoms in
general develop side by side, it is especially significant of gastric
cancer when the symptoms of impaired nutrition are more pronounced than
can be explained by the local gastric disturbance.When, however, as
sometimes happens, gastric symptoms are absent or no more than can be
explained by anaemia and marasmus, then in the absence of tumor a
positive diagnosis is impossible.Such cases of gastric cancer during
life often pass for essential or pernicious anaemia.Otherwise,
unexplained symptoms of anaemia with emaciation and debility,
particularly in elderly people, should lead to a careful search for
gastric cancer.Finally, it is necessary to add that there are exceptional cases of
gastric cancer in which there is no emaciation, and in which the
general health appears to be astonishingly well preserved.In most of
these cases death occurs either from some accident of the disease or
from some complication.Slight or moderate oedema about the ankles is a common symptom during
the cachectic stage of gastric cancer.This oedema is due to hydraemia.This cachectic dropsy in rare cases becomes excessive and leads to
anasarca, with serous effusion in the peritoneal, pleural, and
pericardial sacs.Such cases are liable to be mistaken for heart
disease, particularly as a haemic murmur often coexists, or for
Bright's disease.Ascites may be the result not only of hydraemia, but
also of cancerous peritonitis or of pressure on the portal vein by
cancer.Many cases of gastric cancer associated with ascites have been
falsely diagnosed as cirrhosis of the liver, and sometimes the
distinction is extremely difficult or impossible.During the greater part of the disease the pulse is usually normal;
toward the end it is not infrequently rapid, small, and compressible.In consequence of weakness and anaemia any exertion may suffice to
increase the frequency of the pulse, and may induce palpitation of the
heart and syncope.As might be expected as the result of anaemia, haemic murmurs in the
heart and blood-vessels are not rare in gastric cancer.Epigastric pulsation is often very prominent in cases of gastric
cancer, as it may be in various other conditions.This pulsation is
sometimes of a paroxysmal nature.Venous thrombosis is not a rare complication in the last stages of
gastric cancer.It is most common in the femoral and saphenous veins,
and is rapidly followed by painful oedematous swelling of the affected
extremity.Thrombosis of the subclavian and axillary veins is much less
frequent.When it occurs there are the same symptoms of phlegmasia alba
dolens in the upper extremity as have been mentioned for the lower.Lebert has recorded a case of thrombosis of the right external jugular
{554} vein.[59] The thrombosis is the result of marasmus, and therefore
may occur in other gastric diseases besides gastric cancer, so that
this symptom has not all the diagnostic importance for gastric cancer
claimed by Trousseau.Being an evidence of great weakness of the
circulation, marantic thrombosis in cancer of the stomach is of grave
prognostic import.The temperature is often normal throughout the course of gastric
cancer.Febrile attacks, however, are not uncommon in this disease.Elevation of temperature may occur without any complication to explain
it.During the second half of the disease there may be either irregular
febrile attacks or a more continuous fever, which is, however, usually
of a light grade, the temperature not generally exceeding 102 degrees.Lebert describes a light and a hectic
carcinomatous fever.There may be subnormal temperature with collapse during the last days
of life, and in general anaemia and inactivity of nutritive processes
tend to produce a low temperature.Dyspnoea on slight exertion may be present in gastric cancer as a
result of anaemia or of fatty heart.In a few cases of gastric cancer
have been observed symptoms pointing to a reflex vagus neurosis, such
as paroxysms of dyspnoea, oppression in the chest, and palpitation of
the heart, but these symptoms are less common in gastric cancer than in
some other diseases of the stomach.Watson[60] relates a case of
gastric cancer in which increasing dyspnoea and palpitation were such
prominent symptoms that he was led to diagnose fatty heart with portal
congestion as the sole trouble.At the autopsy the heart and lungs were
found healthy, but there was extensive cancer of the greater curvature
of the stomach.He subsequently ascertained that there had been
symptoms pointing to gastric disease.[Footnote 60: Sir T. Watson, _Lectures on the Principles and Practice
of Physic_, vol.The various complications of gastric cancer which affect the
respiratory organs will be considered later.Depression of spirits, lack of energy, headache, neuralgia,
sleeplessness, and vertigo are functional nervous disturbances which
are often the result of disordered digestion from whatever cause, and
are therefore not uncommon in gastric cancer.The theory that these
symptoms are due to the absorption of noxious substances produced in
the stomach and intestine by abnormal digestive processes is
plausible,[61] and more intelligible than reference to some undefined
sympathy between the digestive organs and the nervous system.[Footnote 61: This theory is elaborated by Senator ("Ueber
Selbstinfection durch abnorme Zersetzungsvorgange, etc.," _Zeitschrift
f. klin.The intelligence is generally not impaired in the course of gastric
cancer.Considerable interest belongs to coma as a symptom of cancer of the
stomach, and more particularly to the occurrence of coma with the
peculiar characters which have been described by Kussmaul as
distinguishing diabetic coma.[62] The most distinctive feature in
Kussmaul's group of symptoms is the accompaniment of the coma by a
peculiar {555} dyspnoea in which, without evidence of disease of the
lungs or air-passages, the respirations are strong and deep and often
attended with a groaning sound in expiration.The breathing is either
normal in frequency or oftener moderately increased.The temperature is not much elevated, and
sometimes is much below the normal.Sometimes the coma is preceded by a
period of excitement, with restlessness, and perhaps with screaming.Gerhardt's reaction in the urine may or may not be present.When it is
present in a marked degree there is often an aromatic, chloroform-like
odor to the breath and to the fresh urine.The patient may come out of
the coma, but in the vast majority of cases the coma terminates
fatally.[Footnote 62: _Deutsches Arch.It is now known that this dyspnoeic coma is not confined to diabetes
mellitus, but that it occurs also in gastric cancer and in various
other diseases.[63] Its occurrence in gastric cancer is rare.In this
disease it does not usually appear until anaemia is far advanced, but
it may occur in cases of cancer in which the patient's general health
and nutrition are still fairly good.I recently made the post-mortem
examination of an elderly man, fairly well nourished, who was found in
the streets comatose and brought in this condition to Bellevue
Hospital, where he died in about twelve hours.While in the hospital
his breathing was increased in frequency, forcible, and deep.The urine contained a small quantity of
albumen, but no sugar.At the autopsy was found a large, soft, ulcerated
cancer of the lesser curvature and posterior wall of the stomach near
the pylorus.The kidneys, brain, heart, and other organs were
essentially healthy.[Footnote 63: Von Jaksch was the first to describe this form of coma in
cancer of the stomach (_Wien.Wochenschr._, 1883, pp.He adopted the term coma carcinomatosum, and more recently coma
diaceticum.L. Riess has reported seventeen cases of this coma
occurring in a variety of diseases, such as pernicious anaemia, gastric
cancer, gastric ulcer, tuberculosis, which all had in common profound
anaemia.He proposes the term dyspnoeic coma (_Zeitschrift f. klin.Senator has described two
cases of gastric cancer with this coma.He uses the terms dyscrasic
coma and Kussmaul's group of symptoms (_ibid._, Bd.In the
cases described by Litten under the name coma dyspepticum, dyspnoea was
absent, but Gerhardt's reaction in the urine was present.In Litten's
cases structural disease of the stomach was not supposed to be present.The patients recovered from the coma (_ibid._, Suppl.We possess no satisfactory explanation of this form of coma.In
diabetes it is considered to be due to the presence in the blood of
some intoxicating agent.For a time this agent was thought to be
aceton; it is now believed by Von Jaksch to be diacetic acid.Much
stress has been laid upon the aromatic, fruity odor of the breath and
of the fresh urine, and upon the presence of some substance in the
urine which imparts to it a burgundy-red color upon the addition of
liquor ferri chloridi (Gerhardt's reaction.See changes in the urine,
page 551).Although the whole aceton question is at present in a very
confused state, there is no proof that aceton or its allies possesses
the toxic properties assumed by this theory;[64] and it is certain that
dyspnoeic coma may occur in diabetes and in other diseases without the
presence of Gerhardt's reaction in the urine.It is also true that this
reaction often occurs without any clinical symptoms referable to it.Riess and Senator believe that in non-diabetic {556} cases anaemia is
the most important factor in the production of this coma.[65]

[Footnote 64: Frerichs, _Zeitschrift f. klin.[Footnote 65: Riess refers the coma to the anaemia as such, whereas
Senator thinks that, in consequence of the depraved nutrition of the
body resulting from the anaemia, some toxic substance is developed
which enters the circulation.]Coma, probably belonging to this same variety, may occur in gastric
cancer without the peculiar dyspnoea which has been described.There is
reason to believe that this dyspnoea is not a necessary symptom of the
so-called diabetic coma.Chronic Bright's disease terminating with uraemic coma is an occasional
but not frequent complication of gastric cancer.Coma and other cerebral symptoms may be produced by secondary cancerous
tumors in the brain.Stupor deepening into coma may develop during the often-prolonged
death-agony of gastric cancer.The distribution, origin, and frequency of cancerous growths secondary
to gastric cancer are most conveniently considered under Pathological
Anatomy.Symptoms referable to certain localizations of these secondary
cancerous deposits, however, are so common, and so interwoven with the
clinical history of cancer of the stomach, that it is desirable to
consider some of these symptoms in the present connection.Cancer of the liver is the most important of these secondary cancerous
growths.It is estimated to be present in nearly one-third of the cases
of gastric cancer, but by no means in all these cases does it produce
symptoms.As a rule, the earlier hepatic cancer forms in the course of
gastric cancer the more likely is it to be attended by symptoms.The
most important symptoms of secondary cancer of the liver are
enlargement of the liver, peritoneal exudation, and persistent icterus.When nodular growths can be felt in the free border or surface of the
liver, the diagnosis is generally easily established.Sometimes the
liver remains of normal size or is even contracted, and then the
diagnosis is difficult or impossible.Ascites or exudative peritonitis
is present in about one-half of the cases of cancer of the liver.It is only persistent jaundice
which aids in the diagnosis of hepatic cancer.The various combinations of gastric cancer with secondary hepatic
cancer may be clinically grouped as follows:

1.Symptoms of gastric cancer with latent hepatic cancer.Symptoms of gastric cancer followed by symptoms of hepatic cancer.Symptoms both of gastric cancer and of hepatic cancer present when
the case comes under observation.Symptoms of hepatic cancer with latent gastric cancer.Symptoms of hepatic cancer followed by symptoms of gastric cancer.Symptoms of anaemia and
marasmus, or of chronic exudative peritonitis, or of chronic pleurisy.From this grouping it is evident that the existence of secondary
hepatic cancer may aid in the diagnosis of cancer of the stomach, or
may mislead, or may be without influence.The greatest assistance in
diagnosis is rendered when the physical signs and the symptoms of
hepatic {557} cancer develop some time after the appearance of gastric
symptoms which may previously have been equivocal.Much more difficult
to diagnosticate are the cases of hepatic cancer accompanied or
followed by gastric symptoms, inasmuch as cancer of the liver, whether
primary or secondary, may be attended with marked disturbance of the
gastric functions, including haematemesis.In these cases, unless a
tumor of the stomach can be discovered, a positive diagnosis of gastric
cancer is impossible.In view of the infrequency of primary cancer of
the liver, however, there will be in many of these cases a strong
probability in favor of primary cancer of the stomach.When it is
remembered that over one-third of the cancers of the liver are
secondary to cancer of the stomach, it is evident that in cases which
appear to be primary hepatic cancer very careful attention should be
given to the exploration of the stomach.But even then diagnostic
errors will often be unavoidable.Cancer of the peritoneum secondary to cancer of the stomach may produce
no symptoms, and so pass unrecognized.The diagnosis of peritoneal
cancer is readily made when, after the recognition of gastric cancer,
secondary cancerous nodules in the peritoneum can be felt through the
abdominal walls or through the vagina.There are cases of gastric
cancer in which the symptoms are all referable to secondary cancer of
the peritoneum.Cancer of the peritoneum is usually attended with fluid
exudation in the peritoneal cavity.The chemical and the microscopical
examination of this fluid withdrawn by paracentesis may aid in the
diagnosis of cancerous peritonitis.Whereas in dropsical accumulations
in the peritoneal cavity the quantity of albumen in the fluid is
usually less than 2-1/2 per cent., in cancerous peritonitis there is
usually from 3 to 4 per cent.of albumen, the percentage rarely falling
as low as 2-1/2 per cent., but sometimes being as high as from 5 to 6
per cent.The percentage of albumen in ordinary peritonitis is usually
over 4.[66] Clumps of cancer-cells are sometimes to be found by
microscopical examination of the fluid.These cells are large,
epithelioid in shape, and often contain vacuoles and fatty granules.It
is only when these cells are arranged in clumps or as so-called budding
cells, and when they are present in abundance, that they are
diagnostic.They are to be sought especially in fibrinous coagula.They
are present only when the cancerous alveoli actually communicate with
the peritoneal cavity.[67] The development of cancerous nodules in the
margins of an opening made in the abdominal walls by a trocar is also
evidence of cancerous disease of the peritoneum.The same thickening
and retraction of the mesentery and omentum may occur in cancerous as
in tuberculous peritonitis.In both the exudation is often hemorrhagic.[Footnote 66: The conditions under which the estimation of the quantity
of albumen in the peritoneal exudation may prove of diagnostic aid are
fully considered by Runeberg (_Deutsches Arch.Here also are given methods for making this analysis for
clinical purposes.][Footnote 67: The literature on this subject is as follows: Foulis,
_Brit.2, 1878; Thornton, _ibid._, Sept.7,
1878; Quincke, _Deutsches Arch.580;
Ehrlich, _Charite Annalen_, vii.226; Brieger, _ibid._, viii.]Importance has been attached to enlargement of the supraclavicular
lymphatic glands in the diagnosis of cancer of the stomach, but there
are so many causes of enlargement of these glands that not much
significance can be attached to this symptom, which, moreover, is
absent in most {558} cases.Still, under certain circumstances this
glandular enlargement may aid in the diagnosis.The same remarks apply
to enlargement of the inguinal glands, which is a common occurrence in
case cancer involves the peritoneum.One must not mistake abnormal
prominence of the lymphatic glands in consequence of emaciation for
actual enlargement.Gastric cancer much less frequently than gastric ulcer causes
perforation of the stomach.Of 507 cases of gastric cancer collected by
Brinton, perforation into the general peritoneal cavity occurred in 17
(3-1/3 per cent.).[68] In two cases of gastric cancer reported by Ellis
perforative peritonitis was preceded by symptoms supposed to be only
those of ordinary dyspepsia, hemorrhage and vomiting being absent.[69]
Various fistulous communications like those described under gastric
ulcer may be the result of perforation of gastric cancer, but with the
exception of gastro-colic fistula they are much more frequently
produced by ulcer than by cancer.In 160 cases of gastric cancer
collected by Dittrich, gastro-colic fistula existed in 6 (3-3/4 per
cent.).[70] In 507 cases collected by Brinton this fistula existed in
11 (2.17 per cent.).In Lange's 210 cases gastro-colic fistula existed
in 8 (3.8 per cent.).Of 33 cases of gastro-colic fistula collected by
Murchison, 21 were caused by cancerous ulceration.[71] The symptoms
characteristic of fistulous communication between the stomach and the
colon are the vomiting of fecal matter and the passage of undigested
food by the stools.These symptoms are not present in all cases, so
that a diagnosis is not always possible.Fecal vomiting is influenced
by the size of the opening between the stomach and the colon.With
great obstruction at the pylorus, fecal vomiting, as might be expected,
is absent or infrequent, while the passage of undigested food by the
bowels is common.Under these circumstances vomiting is sometimes
relieved after the establishment of the fistula.Aid may be afforded in
the diagnosis of gastro-colic fistula by the introduction into the
rectum or into the stomach of  or other easily recognizable
substances, and determining their presence in the vomit or in the
stools in consequence of their escape by the unnatural outlet.V.
Ziemssen has determined in a case of gastro-colic fistula due to cancer
the escape into the stomach of carbonic acid gas artificially generated
in the rectum, with failure to obtain distension of the colon.[72] A
number of instances of gastro-cutaneous fistula due to gastric cancer
have been recorded, but this form of fistula is much less common than
gastro-colic fistula, and much less frequently the result of cancer
than of ulcer of the stomach.Subcutaneous emphysema may precede the
formation of the fistula.Other gastric fistulous communications
resulting from cancer, such as with the pleura, the lungs, the small
intestine, are too infrequent to merit consideration under the
symptomatology of the disease.cit._) records in 210 cases of
gastric cancer 12 perforations into the peritoneal cavity (5.7 per
cent.).][Footnote 70: _Prager Vierteljahrsch._, vol.[Footnote 72: _Deutsches Arch.He
recommends for extreme distension of the colon in an adult the
introduction, by means of a tube passed up the rectum, of a solution of
about 5 drachms of sodii bicarb.and 4-1/2 drachms of tartaric
acid--injected not all at once, but in three or four doses at intervals
of a few minutes, the tube being cleaned in the intervals by the
injection of three ounces of water, so as to avoid generation of gas in
the tube.The generation of a smaller quantity of gas would suffice for
the purpose here in view.]{559} As a rule, patients with gastric cancer die from gradual
exhaustion.In a condition of extreme emaciation and feebleness the
patient sinks into a state of collapse, accompanied often with stupor,
sometimes with mild delirium.The death-agony is prolonged frequently
from twelve to twenty-four hours, and sometimes even longer.On the
other hand, death may occur somewhat suddenly in the last stages of
gastric cancer, and without satisfactory explanation.Death from copious gastric hemorrhage does not occur probably in more
than 1 per cent.In the rare cases of death from perforation of the stomach the patient
is sometimes so exhausted at the time of perforation that the
occurrence of this accident remains unrecognized in the absence of any
complaint of characteristic symptoms.The coma which sometimes leads to the fatal termination of gastric
cancer has already been sufficiently considered.Finally, death may be the result of certain complications more or less
dependent upon the cancer.Of these the most important are suppurative
peritonitis and pulmonary complications, particularly oedema, terminal
pneumonia, and embolism of the pulmonary artery.DURATION.--It is evidently impossible to determine the exact duration
of a cancer of the stomach.Doubtless in all cases there is a period of
growth of the tumor before it produces symptoms, and the duration of
this latent period can never be determined.When symptoms appear they
are often at first so mild as to be readily overlooked, and so
ambiguous that even if recognized they are not clearly referable to the
cancer.Gastric symptoms may have preceded, perhaps for years, the
development of the cancer, so as to lead to the assumption of a longer
duration of the cancer than is really the case.Estimates, therefore,
of the duration of gastric cancer can be only of limited value.From 198 cases Brinton[73] estimates the average duration of gastric
cancer as about twelve and a half months, the maximum duration as about
thirty-six months, and the minimum as one month.From 36 cases
Katzenellenbogen[74] estimates the average duration as eighteen months,
the maximum as five years and five months, the minimum as one month.From 112 cases Lebert[75] makes the average duration fifteen months and
the maximum four years.of the cases Lebert found the
duration less than three months, in 62 per cent.between six and
eighteen months, in 42 per cent.between six and twelve months, in 17
per cent.between three and six months, and in the same number of cases
between eighteen months and four years.cit._]

[Footnote 74: _Op.cit._]

[Footnote 75: _Op.cit._]

Estimates of several years' duration (such as nine years in the case of
Napoleon) are to be received with scepticism.In these cases symptoms
of gastralgia or of dyspepsia or of gastric ulcer have preceded the
development of the cancer.It has already been mentioned that cancer
may develop in a simple ulcer of the stomach.Mathieu,[76] from an analysis of 27 cases of gastric cancer occurring
under thirty-four years, found the average duration in early life to be
only three months.In only 2 out of 19 cases did the duration exceed
one year.Although this analysis is based upon too small a number of
cases, there {560} seems to be no doubt that gastric cancer pursues a
more rapid course in early life than it does in old people.[Footnote 76: _Du Cancer precoce de l'Estomac_, Paris, 1884, p.COMPLICATIONS.--Some of the complications of gastric cancer have been
mentioned under Symptomatology.Jaundice may appear in the course of
gastric cancer from a variety of causes, such as catarrhal
gastro-duodenitis, impaction of gall-stones in the common bile-duct,
and pressure on the bile-duct by cancerous growths in the pancreas, in
the portal lymphatic glands, or in the liver itself.Pylethrombosis,
which is likely to be suppurative, is a rare complication.In a case of
cancer of the anterior wall and greater curvature of the stomach
reported by Wickham Legg[77] the symptoms seem to have been mostly
referable to a complicating suppurative pylethrombosis.Simple and
cancerous pylethromboses also occur.Other forms of peritonitis than
the cancerous may complicate gastric cancer, such as suppurative,
sero-fibrinous, and chronic proliferative peritonitis.Catarrhal
enteritis, and particularly diphtheritic colitis, are not infrequent
complications, especially in the later stages of the disease.Chronic
diffuse nephritis, both in the form of the large and of the small
kidney, is a rare complication of cancer of the stomach.Hydrothorax,
sero-fibrinous pleurisy, and emphysema may develop either with or
without cancerous invasion of the pleura.Pericarditis is much less
common; it is most likely to occur with cancer of the cardia.Pyo-pneumothorax, abscess, and gangrene of the lung may result from
perforation of the pleura or of the lung by gastric cancer.Oedema of
the lungs, splenization, and pneumonia, involving usually the lower
lobes, are common in the last days of gastric cancer.Emboli derived
from venous thrombi are sometimes carried into the pulmonary artery or
its branches.Although much has been written as to the exclusion of
tuberculosis by cancer, no such law exists.Both old and fresh
tubercles have been repeatedly observed in cases of gastric cancer.Reference has already been made to the frequent development of aphthae
in the mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus in the final stage of gastric
cancer.Fatty degeneration of the heart may develop in gastric cancer
as in other anaemic states.Phlegmasia alba dolens has already been
mentioned.It is not probable that insanity is to be regarded as more
than an accidental complication of gastric cancer; still, it has been
noticed in several cases--for instance, of Dittrich's 160 cases, 5
patients were insane, 2 with violent mania.Amyloid degeneration has
been present in some cases.Purpura haemorrhagica has been present in a
few instances in the later stages (cachectic purpura).Chronic
catarrhal gastritis and dilatation of the stomach are less
complications than a part of the disease.The relation of cancer to
simple ulcer of the stomach has already been considered.The various
secondary cancerous deposits are most conveniently considered under the
Morbid Anatomy.It is to be remarked that many of the complications of
gastric cancer--as, for instance, pneumonia and peritonitis--may have a
very obscure clinical history, as they often occur when the patient is
greatly prostrated.MORBID ANATOMY.--The following table gives the situation of the tumor
in 1300 cases of cancer of the stomach:[78] {561}

  Pyloric region.791  60.8%
  Lesser curvature.148  11.4%
  Cardia.104   8.0%
  Posterior wall.68   5.2%
  The whole or the greater
    part of the stomach.61   4.7%
  Multiple tumors.45   3.5%
  Greater curvature.34   2.6%
  Anterior wall.30   2.3%
  Fundus.19   1.5%

From this table it appears that three-fifths of all gastric cancers
occupy the pyloric region, but it is not to be understood that in all
of these cases the pylorus itself is involved.In four-fifths of the
cases the comparatively small segment of the stomach represented by the
cardia, the lesser curvature, and the pyloric region is the part
affected by gastric cancer.The lesser curvature and the anterior and
the posterior walls are involved more frequently than appears from the
table, inasmuch as many cancers assigned to the pyloric region extend
to these parts.The fundus is the least frequent seat of cancer.In the
cases classified as involving the greater part of the stomach the
fundus often escapes.[Footnote 78: These cases are collected from the following sources:
Lebert, _op.cit._; Prague statistics of Dittrich, Engel, Wrany, and
Eppinger, _loc.cit._; Habershon, _op.cit._; Katzenellenbogen, _op.cit._; and Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter, _loc.cit._ Gussenbauer and
V. Winiwarter assign to the class of cancers involving the whole
stomach all cases which they found designated simply as carcinoma
ventriculi without further description.This produces in their
statistics an excessive number of cancers under this class.I have
preferred, therefore, to estimate in their collection of cases the
number of cancers involving the whole stomach, according to the
percentage for this class obtained from the other authors above cited.]As was shown by Rokitansky, it is the exception for cancer of the
pylorus to extend into the duodenum, whereas cancer of the cardia
usually invades for a certain distance the oesophagus.The varieties of carcinoma which develop primarily in the stomach are
scirrhous, medullary, colloid, and cylindrical epithelial
carcinoma.[79] The distinction between scirrhous and medullary cancer
is based upon the difference in consistence, the former being hard and
the latter soft.Cylindrical-celled epithelioma cannot be recognized as
such by the naked eye.It presents usually the gross appearances of
medullary cancer.Soft cancer (including both cylindrical-celled
epithelioma and medullary carcinoma) is the most frequent form of
gastric cancer.Next in frequency is scirrhous cancer, and then comes
colloid cancer, which, although not rare, is much less frequent than
the other varieties.[Footnote 79: I have not been able to find an authentic instance of
primary melanotic cancer of the stomach, although this form is included
by most authors in the list of primary gastric cancers.It is known
that most cases formerly described as melanotic cancers are melanotic
sarcomata, which originate usually in the skin or the eye and are
accompanied frequently with abundant metastases.Secondary melanotic
tumors have been several times found in the stomach.They were present
in 7 out of 50 cases of melanotic cancer (or sarcoma) analyzed by
Eiselt, although out of 104 cases not a single primary melanotic cancer
occurred in the stomach (_Prager Viertaljahrschr._, vol.The list of secondary melanotic sarcomata of the stomach might be still
further increased.Of course gastric cancers  by pigment from
old blood-extravasations should not be confounded with melanotic
tumors.]As all degrees of combination and of transition exist between the
different forms of cancer, and as a large number of cancers of the
stomach are of a medium consistence and would be classified by some
observers as scirrhous and by others as medullary, statistics as to the
relative frequency of the different varieties have very little value.Moreover, in most statistics upon this point there is no evidence that
simple fibrous growths have not been confounded with scirrhous cancer,
and as a rule {562} little or no account is taken of cylindrical-celled
epithelioma, which is a common form of gastric cancer--according to
Cornil and Ranvier, the most common.[80]

[Footnote 80: For any who may be interested in such statistics I have
collected 1221 cases of gastric cancer, of which 791 (64.8 per cent.)were medullary, 399 (32.7 per cent.)scirrhous, and 31 (2.5 per cent.)22 cases described as epithelial have been included with the
medullary; 29 cases described as fibro-medullary, and 1 as
fasciculated, have been included with the scirrhous.The cases are from
the previously-cited statistics of Lebert, Dittrich, Wrany, Eppinger,
Gussenbauer, and V. Winiwarter, and from Fenger (_Virchow u. Hirsch's
Jahresbericht_, 1874, Bd.Cancer of the stomach may grow in the form of a more or less complete
ring around the circumference of the stomach, or as a circumscribed
tumor projecting into the cavity of the stomach, or as a diffuse
infiltration of the walls of the stomach.The annular form of growth is
observed most frequently in the pyloric region.Cancerous tumors which
project into the interior of the stomach are sometimes broad and
flattened, sometimes fungoid in shape, but most frequently they appear
as round or oval, more rarely irregular, crater-like ulcers, with
thickened, prominent walls and ragged floor.The free surface of the
tumor presents sometimes a cauliflower-like or dendritic appearance,
which characterizes the so-called villous cancer.Diffuse cancerous
infiltration is seated oftenest in the right half of the stomach, but
it may occupy the cardiac region or even the entire stomach.The relation of the cancerous growth to the coats of the stomach varies
in different cases.The tumor usually begins in the mucous membrane and
rapidly extends through the muscularis mucosae into the submucous coat.In this lax connective-tissue coat the tumor spreads often more rapidly
than in the mucous membrane, so that it may appear as if the cancer
originated in the submucosa.The mucous membrane, however, is usually
invaded, sooner or later, over the whole extent of the tumor.The dense
muscular coat offers more resistance to the invasion of the tumor.Cancerous masses, however, penetrate along the connective-tissue septa
between the muscular bundles, which often increase in number and size.In the muscular coat thus thickened can be seen the opaque white
fibrous and cancerous septa enclosing the grayish, translucent bundles
of smooth muscular tissue.Often, however, the whole muscular coat
beneath the tumor is replaced by the cancerous growth, and can no
longer be recognized.The serous and subserous connective tissue, like
the submucous coat, offers a favorable soil for the growth of the
tumor, which here appears usually in the form of large and small
nodules projecting from the peritoneum.Adhesions now form between the
stomach and surrounding parts, and opportunity is offered for the
continuous growth of the cancer into these parts.In the manner
described the tumor grows in all directions, sometimes more in depth,
sometimes more laterally, sometimes more into the interior of the
stomach.Ulceration occurs in all forms of gastric cancer.[81] The ulceration is
caused either by fatty degeneration and molecular disintegration of the
surface of the tumor or by the separation of sloughy masses.Doubtless
the solvent action of the gastric juice aids in the process.The softer
and {563} the more rapid the growth of the cancer, the more extensive
is likely to be the ulcer.Such ulcers are usually round or oval in
shape, but their contours may be irregular from the coalescence of two
or more ulcers or from serpiginous growth.The edges are usually high,
soft in consistence, and often beset with polypoid excrescences.The
floor is generally sloughy and soft, and often presents warty
outgrowths.The edges and floor may, however, be hard and smooth.In
the more slowly-growing scirrhous and colloid cancers the ulcers are
more likely to be superficial.Partial cicatrization of cancerous
ulcers may take place.The development of cicatricial tissue may
destroy the cancerous elements to such an extent that only by careful
microscopical examination can the distinction be made between cancer
and simple ulcer or fibroid induration.The examination of secondary
cancerous deposits in adjacent lymphatic glands or other parts becomes,
then, an important aid in the diagnosis.[Footnote 81: Ulceration was present in 60 per cent.of Lebert's cases,
and in 66-1/2 per cent.of Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's pyloric
cancers.]Suppuration has been known to occur in gastric cancers, but it is
extremely rare.Each form of gastric cancer has certain peculiarities which require
separate consideration.Medullary carcinoma grows more rapidly than the other varieties of
cancer.It forms usually soft masses, which project into the stomach
and are prone to break down in the centre and develop into the
crater-like ulcers already described.All of the coats of the stomach
are rapidly invaded by the growth.The consistence of the tumor is
soft, the color upon section whitish or reddish-gray, sometimes over a
considerable extent hemorrhagic.Milky juice can be freely scraped from
the cut surface of the tumor.The so-called villous cancer and the
haematodes fungus are varieties of medullary carcinoma.Medullary
carcinoma is more frequently accompanied by metastases than the other
forms.In consequence of its tendency to deep ulceration medullary
cancer is more liable to give rise to hemorrhage and to perforation
than is scirrhous or colloid cancer.The continuous new formation of
cancerous tissue in the floor of the ulcer and the formation of
adhesions, however, greatly lessen the danger of perforation into the
peritoneal cavity.Histologically, medullary cancer is composed of a scanty stroma of
connective tissue enclosing an abundance of cancerous alveoli filled
with polyhedrical or cylindrical epithelial cells.The stroma is often
richly infiltrated with lymphoid cells, and contains blood-vessels
which often present irregular dilatations of their lumen.Waldeyer describes with much detail, for this as for the other forms of
gastric cancer, the origin of the tumor from the gastric tubules.According to his description, a group of gastric tubules, ten to twenty
in number, sends prolongations downward into the submucous coat.These
tubular prolongations are filled with proliferating epithelial cells,
which make their way into the lymphatic spaces of the surrounding
tissue and give origin to the cells in the cancerous alveoli.A
small-celled infiltration of the surrounding connective tissue
accompanies this growth of the tubules.The tissue beneath and at the margins of medullary cancer may be
predominantly fibrous in texture and contain comparatively few
cancerous alveoli.This scirrhous base is often exposed after the
destruction of the greater part of the soft cancer by ulceration and
sloughing.It is {564} probable that many of the scirrhous cancers are
formed in this way secondarily to medullary cancer (Ziegler).Cylindrical-celled epithelioma presents the same gross appearances and
the same tendency to ulceration and to the formation of metastases
which characterize medullary cancer.The consistence of cylindrical
epithelioma may, however, be firm like that of scirrhus.Not
infrequently the alveoli are distended with mucus secreted by the
lining epithelium, and then the tumor presents in whole or in part
appearances similar to colloid cancer.Upon microscopical examination are seen spaces resembling more or less
closely sections of tubular glands.These spaces are lined with
columnar epithelium.Often in certain parts of the tumor the alveolar
spaces are filled with cells, so that the structure is a combination of
that of ordinary cancer and of epithelioma.The stroma is generally
scanty and rich in cells, but it may be abundant.Cysts may be present
in this form of tumor, and in one case I have found such cysts nearly
filled with papillary growths covered with cylindrical epithelium, so
that the appearance resembled closely that of the so-called proliferous
cysto-sarcoma of the breast.The origin of cylindrical epithelioma from the gastric tubules is
generally accepted, and is more readily demonstrable than the similar
origin claimed for the other forms of gastric cancer.Scirrhous cancer assumes often the form of a diffuse thickening and
induration of the gastric walls, particularly in the pyloric region,
where it causes stenosis of the pyloric orifice.Scirrhus may, however,
appear as a circumscribed tumor.Irregular hard nodules frequently
project from diffuse scirrhous growths into the interior of the
stomach.Scirrhous cancer and medullary cancer are often combined with
each other.The dense consistence of scirrhous cancer is due to the predominance of
the fibrous stroma, the cancerous alveoli being relatively small in
size and few in number.Colloid cancer generally appears as a more or less uniform thickening
of the gastric walls.All of the coats of the stomach are converted
into the colloid growth.Nearly the whole of the stomach may be invaded
by the new growth.[82] The tumor has a tendency to spread to the omenta
and to the rest of the peritoneum, where it may form enormous masses,
but it rarely gives rise to metastases in the interior of organs.Colloid cancer may, however, form a circumscribed projecting tumor in
the stomach, and in rare instances it causes abundant secondary colloid
deposits in the liver, the lungs, and other parts.[Footnote 82: In a case reported by Storer the whole stomach, except a
little of the left extremity over an extent of about an inch, was
converted into a colloid mass in which no trace of the normal coats of
the stomach could be made out.The colloid growth replacing the gastric
wall measured seven-eighths of an inch in thickness in the pyloric
region.Digestion was less disturbed in this case than in most cases of
gastric cancer (_Boston Med.In
Amidon's case (reported in the _Trans.38) there seems to have been an equally extensive colloid
metamorphosis of the stomach.]Colloid cancer presents, even to the naked eye, an exquisite alveolar
structure, whence the name alveolar cancer as a designation of this
tumor.Bands of opaque white or gray connective tissue enclose alveolar
meshes which are filled with the gelatinous, pellucid colloid {565}
substance.This colloid material is thought to be produced by a colloid
transformation of the epithelial cells in the alveoli, but the same
transformation seems to occur also in the stroma.Few or no intact
epithelial cells may be found in the alveoli.Colloid metamorphosis may
take place in all forms of gastric cancer, but it is particularly
common in cylindrical epithelioma.Colloid cancer may originate in the
peritoneum unconnected with any glandular structures.It occurs often
at an earlier age than other forms of cancer.Deep ulceration rarely
attacks colloid cancer.Flat-celled epithelioma is found at the cardiac orifice and as a
metastatic growth in other parts of the stomach.Originating in the
oesophagus, it may extend downward into the stomach.By noting whether
the structure is that of squamous or of cylindrical epithelioma it is
often possible to determine whether a tumor at the cardiac orifice
originates in the oesophagus or in the stomach.Secondary cancer of the stomach, although rare, is not such a curiosity
as is often represented.Without aiming at completeness, I have been
able to collect 37 cases of secondary cancer of the stomach, of which
the larger number will stand critical examination.[83] Of these cases,
17 were secondary to cancer of the breast, 8 to cancer of the
oesophagus, 3 to cancer of the mouth or nose, and the remainder to
cancer of other parts of the body.The large number of cases secondary
to cancer of the breast is explained by the large statistics relating
to mammary cancer which were consulted.Gastric cancer is more
frequently secondary to cancer of the oesophagus than to cancer of any
other part.In this category of course are not included cases of
continuous growth of oesophageal cancer into the stomach, but only
metastatic cancers of the stomach.A part at least of the gastric
cancers secondary to cancer of the alimentary tract above the stomach I
refer, with Klebs, to implantation in the mucous membrane of the
stomach of cancerous particles detached from the primary growth in the
oesophagus, pharynx, or mouth.This view is supported by the absence in
some cases of any involvement of the lymphatic glands.The secondary
deposits in the stomach conform in structure to the primary growth.They are usually situated in the submucous coat, where they form one or
often several distinctly circumscribed tumors.The secondary tumors may
or may not ulcerate.[Footnote 83: These cases are from Dittrich, 2 (the remainder of his
cases I rejected); Cohnheim, 1; Petri, 2; Klebs, 3; Lucke, 1; Weigert,
1; Coupland, 1; Cruse, 1; Hausmann, 1; Bartholow, 1; Oldekop, 5; Edes,
1; V. Torok and V. Wittelshofer, 8; Grawitz, 4; Haren Noman, 5.So-called melanotic cancers, cancers involving only the serous coat of
the stomach, and those extending by continuous growth into the stomach,
are not included in this list.]Primary cancers may be present at the same time in different organs of
the body; for instance, in the uterus and in the stomach.[84] The
possibility of multiple primary cancers is to be borne in mind in
considering some of the apparently secondary cancers of the stomach, as
well as in determining whether certain cancers are secondary to gastric
cancer or not.Here the microscopical examination is often
decisive.[85]

[Footnote 84: Case of A. Clark's (_Trans.260), and a similar one reported by J. B. S. Jackson in _Extr.[Footnote 85: The subject of multiple primary cancers is considered by
Kauffmann (_Virchow's Arch._, Bd.317), and by Beck (_Prager
med.Wochenschr._, 1883, Nos.V. Winiwarter reports a
cancer of the stomach in a patient who died one year seven and a half
months after extirpation of a cancer of the nose.He regards the case
as one of multiple primary cancer.]{566} Gastric cancer often causes important secondary changes in the
coats and the lumen of the stomach.In the neighborhood of the tumor
are often found hypertrophy of the muscular coat and fibrous thickening
of the submucous coat.Polypoid hypertrophy of the mucous membrane near
the cancer is not rare.Not only near the tumor, but over the whole
stomach, chronic catarrhal gastritis usually exists.The most important alterations are those dependent upon obstruction of
the orifices of the stomach.This obstruction may be caused either by a
tumor encroaching upon the orifice or by an annular thickening of the
walls of the orifices.Even without apparent stenosis, destruction of
the muscular layer at or near the pylorus may be an obstacle to the
propulsion of the gastric contents into the duodenum.As a result of
obstruction of the pyloric orifice the stomach becomes dilated,
sometimes enormously, so as to occupy most of the abdominal cavity.The
walls of the dilated stomach, particularly the muscular coat, are
usually thickened, but exceptionally they are thinned.Sometimes with
pyloric stenosis the stomach is reduced in size.This occurs
particularly when a scirrhous growth extends diffusely from the pyloric
region over a considerable part of the stomach.Obstruction of the
cardiac orifice or in the oesophagus leads to atrophy of the stomach,
although here also there are exceptions.Above the obstruction the
oesophagus is often dilated.An existing obstruction may be reduced or
removed by ulceration or sloughing of the tumor.Both dilatation and contraction of the stomach may attend gastric
cancer without any involvement of the orifices of the stomach in the
cancerous growth.The cavity of the stomach may be so shrunken by
scirrhous thickening and contraction of the gastric walls that it will
hardly contain a hen's egg.Irregular deformities in the shape of the
stomach, such as an hour-glass shape and diverticular recesses, may be
caused by gastric cancer.Changes in the shape of the stomach and the weight of the tumor may
cause displacements of pyloric cancers, so that these tumors have been
found in nearly all regions of the abdomen, and even in the true
pelvis.[86] Such displaced cancers usually contract adhesions with
surrounding parts.[Footnote 86: Lebert, _op.It is not necessary to dwell upon the formation of adhesions which may
bind the stomach to nearly all of the abdominal organs, most frequently
to the liver, the pancreas, the intestine, and the anterior abdominal
wall.Adhesions of pyloric cancers are found in at least two-thirds of
the cases, and probably oftener.[87]

[Footnote 87: Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter found adhesions recorded in
370 out of 542 pyloric cancers.In considering the propriety of
resection of gastric cancers it has become a matter of importance to
know in what proportion of cases adhesions are present.I agree with
Ledderhose and with Rydygier in believing that adhesions are present
oftener than appears from Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's statistics.The fact that adhesions are not noted in post-mortem records of gastric
cancer cannot be considered proof of their absence.Little has been
done in the study of gastric cancer from a surgical point of view.Metastases and adhesions were absent in only 5 out of 52 cases of
pyloric cancer in which either pylorectomy or exploratory laparotomy
was performed (Rydygier).]Cancer of the stomach in the majority of cases is accompanied with
{567} metastases in other parts of the body.In 1120 cases of gastric
cancer secondary cancers were present in 710, or 63.4 per cent., and
absent in 410, or 36.6 per cent.[88] In about two-thirds of the cases,
therefore, secondary deposits were present.[Footnote 88: These cases are from Habershon, _op.i.; and Gussenbauer and Von
Winiwarter, _loc.cit._]

In order to determine the relative frequency of the secondary deposits
in various organs of the body, I have constructed the following table,
based upon an analysis of 1574 cases of cancer of the stomach in which
the situation of the metastases were given:[89]

  Lymphatic glands.551  35.0%
  Liver.475  30.2%
  Peritoneum, omentum, and intestine.357  22.7%
  Pancreas.122   7.8%
  Pleura and lung.98   6.2%
  Spleen.26   1.7%
  Brain and meninges.9   0.6%
  Other parts of the body.92   5.8%

[Footnote 89: These cases include, in addition to those cited in the
preceding foot-note, those of Dittrich (_Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.), Wrany (_ibid._, vols.Metastases in the intestine formed only
a small number of those under the heading peritoneum, omentum, and
intestine, but as they were all included together in Gussenbauer's
large statistics, the intestinal metastases could not well be placed
separately.In 673 cases the peritoneum and omentum were cancerous in
21.7 per cent.]Secondary cancerous deposits are probably even more frequent in the
lymphatic glands than appears from the table.In 1153 cases of gastric
cancer in which the situation of the affected lymphatic glands is
specified, the abdominal glands, and chiefly those near the stomach,
were the seat of cancer in 32-1/2 per cent.In Lange's 210 cases the
cervical glands were affected in 4.3 per cent.In other statistics this
percentage is much smaller.In nearly one-third of the cases there are
secondary cancers in the liver.These may attain an enormous size in
comparison with the tumor of the stomach.Cancer of the peritoneum and
of the omentum is found in about one-fifth of the cases of gastric
cancer.The spleen is rarely involved, except by continuous growth of a
cancer of the fundus or in cases of widespread distribution of cancer
through the aortic circulation.Cancer of the liver increases the
liability to metastases in the lungs, but the latter may be present
without any cancerous deposits in the liver.Secondary cancers may be
present in the suprarenal capsules, the kidneys, the ovaries, the
heart, the thoracic duct, the bones, the skin, etc.In an interesting
case reported by Finlay[90] the subcutaneous tissue of the trunk was
thickly studded with small nodules, of which two were excised during
life and found to be cylindrical epitheliomata.This led to the
diagnosis of a primary tumor of the same nature in the stomach or in
the intestine.At the autopsy was found a cylindrical epithelioma of
the stomach which had not given rise to characteristic symptoms.Secondary cancer of the intestine is rare if the deposits in the
peritoneal coat be {568} excepted.Several cancerous ulcers or multiple
cancerous nodules may be found along the intestinal tract, involving
the mucous and the submucous coats.[91] These metastases seem best
explained by the theory of implantation of cancerous elements which
have been carried from the primary growth in the stomach into the
intestine.In some of the cases the idea of multiple primary cancers
may also be entertained.Unfortunately, in Roseler's case of multiple skin-cancers with an
ulcerated cancer of the stomach no microscopical examination of the
skin-nodules was made.The interpretation of this case is therefore
doubtful (_Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.[Footnote 91: Cases in point are recorded by Wrany (_loc.cit._), Blix
(_Virchow u. Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1876, ii.207), Lange,
Katzenellenbogen, and Lebert.]It is not rare for gastric cancer to cause secondary deposits in the
stomach itself.Sometimes it is difficult to decide which of two or
more cancers in the stomach is the primary growth, as in Ripley's case
of ulcerated cancer of the cardiac orifice with a similar growth around
the pyloric orifice.[92] It is probable that in very rare instances
multiple primary cancers may develop in the stomach.[Footnote 92: J. H. Ripley, _Trans.Maurizio has also reported a case of scirrhous cancer of the cardia
with scirrhous cancer of the pylorus (_Annal.di Medicina_, Oct.,
1869).A similar case was observed by Barth (_Gaz.hebdom._, 1856, No.Cancerous metastases are produced by the transportation of cancerous
elements by the lymphatic current or by the blood-current.In a number
of instances the portal vein or some of the branches which help to form
it have been found plugged with a cancerous mass which may or may not
be organized.[93] The cancer in these cases has burst through the walls
of the vessel into the lumen, where it may grow both in the direction
and against the direction of the current.On serous surfaces, and
probably also, although rarely, on mucous surfaces, secondary cancers
may develop from cancerous particles detached from a parent tumor and
scattered over the surface as a kind of seminium.[Footnote 93: Cases of this kind have been reported with especial
fulness by Spaeth (_Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.432), Acker
(_Deutsches Arch.173), and Audibert (_De la
Generalisation du Cancer de l'Estomac_, Paris, Thesis, 1877).]Mention has already been made of the invasion of parts adjacent to the
stomach by the continuous growth of gastric cancer.In this way
lymphatic glands, the liver, the pancreas, the omenta, the transverse
colon, the spleen, the diaphragm, the anterior abdominal wall, the
vertebrae, the spinal cord and membranes, and other parts may be
involved in the cancerous growth.Under the head of Complications reference has already been made to
various lesions which may be associated with gastric cancer.As regards
the manifold complications caused by perforation of gastric cancer, in
addition to what has already been said the article on gastric ulcer may
be consulted.In general, the various fistulous communications caused
by gastric cancer are less direct than those produced by gastric ulcer.The wasting of various organs of the body in cases of gastric cancer
may be found on post-mortem examination to be extreme.Habershon
mentions a case in which the heart of a woman forty years old weighed
only 3-1/2 ounces after death from cancer of the pylorus.As in other
profoundly anaemic states, the embryonic or lymphoid alteration of the
marrow of the bones is often present in gastric cancer.PATHENOGENESIS.--The problems relating to the ultimate causation and
origin of gastric cancer belong to the pathenogenesis of cancer in
general.Our knowledge with reference to these points is purely
hypothetical.It will suffice in this connection simply to call
attention to {569} Virchow's doctrine, that cancer develops most
frequently as the result of abnormal or of physiological irritation,
hence in the stomach most frequently at the orifices; and to Cohnheim's
theory, that cancer as well as other non-infectious tumors originate in
abnormalities in development, more specifically in persistent embryonic
cells.According to the latter view, gastric cancer develops only in
those whose stomachs from the time of birth contain such embryonic
remnants.These unused embryonic cells may lie dormant throughout life
or they may be incited to cancerous growth by irritation, senile
changes, etc.According to Cohnheim's theory, the orifices of the
stomach are the most frequent seat of cancer on account of complexity
in the development of these parts.For a full consideration of these theories the reader is referred to
the section of this work on General Pathology.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of a recognizable tumor in the region of the
stomach outweighs in diagnostic value all other symptoms of gastric
cancer.The detection of fragments of cancer in the vomit or in
washings from the stomach is of equal diagnostic significance, but of
rare applicability.The discovery of secondary cancers in the liver, in
the peritoneum, or in lymphatic glands may render valuable aid in
diagnosis.Of the local gastric symptoms, coffee-ground vomiting is the
most important.The relation between the local and the general symptoms
may shed much light upon the case.While anorexia, indigestion,
vomiting, and epigastric pain and tenderness point to the existence of
a gastric affection, the malignant character of the affection may be
surmised by the development of anaemia, emaciation, and cachexia more
rapid and more profound than can be explained solely by the local
gastric symptoms.The value to be attached in the diagnosis of gastric
cancer to the absence of free hydrochloric acid from the contents of
the stomach must still be left sub judice.The age of the patient, the
duration, and the course of the disease are circumstances which are
also to be considered in making the diagnosis of gastric cancer.These
symptoms of gastric cancer have already been fully considered with
reference to their presence and absence and to their diagnostic
features.It remains to call attention to the differential diagnosis between
gastric cancer and certain diseases with which it is likely to be
confounded.The points of contrast which are to be adduced relate
mostly to the intensity and the frequency of certain symptoms.There is
not a symptom or any combination of symptoms of gastric cancer which
may not occur in other diseases.Hence the diagnosis is reached by a
balancing of probabilities, and not by any positive proof.Notwithstanding these difficulties, gastric cancer is diagnosed
correctly in the great majority of cases, although often not until a
late stage of the disease.Errors in diagnosis, however, are
unavoidable, not only in cases in which the symptoms are ambiguous or
misleading, but also in cases in which all the symptoms of gastric
cancer, including gastric hemorrhage and tumor, are present, and still
no gastric cancer exists.Cases of the latter variety are of course
rare.In the absence of tumor the diseases for which gastric cancer is most
liable to be mistaken are gastric ulcer and chronic gastric catarrh.In
the following table are given the main points of contrast between these
three diseases: {570}

{571} The diagnosis between gastric cancer and gastric ulcer is more
difficult than that between cancer and gastritis, and sometimes the
diagnosis is impossible.The differential points mentioned in the table
are of very unequal value.An age under thirty, profuse hemorrhage, and
absence of tumor are the most important points in favor of ulcer;
tumor, advanced age, and coffee-ground vomiting continued for weeks are
the most important points in favor of cancer.As cancer may have been
preceded by ulcer or chronic gastritis for years, it is evidently
unsafe to trust too much to the duration of the illness.As has already
been said, it is best to place no reliance in the differential
diagnosis upon the character of the pain.Any peculiarities of the
vomiting, the appetite, or the digestion are of little importance in
the differential diagnosis.Cachexia is of more importance, but it is
to be remembered that ulcer, and even chronic gastritis in rare
instances, may be attended by a cachexia indistinguishable from that of
cancer.Cases might be cited in which very decided temporary
improvement in the symptoms has been brought about in the course of
gastric cancer, so that too much stress should not be laid upon this
point.Enough has been said under the Symptomatology with reference to
the diagnostic bearings of the absence of free hydrochloric acid from
the stomach, of the presence of cancerous fragments in fluids from the
stomach, and of secondary cancers in different parts of the body.One must not lose sight of the fact that the whole complex of symptoms,
the order of their occurrence, and the general aspect of the case, make
an impression which cannot be conveyed in any diagnostic table, but
which leads the experienced physician to a correct diagnosis more
surely than reliance upon any single symptom.In the early part of the disease there may be danger of confounding
gastric cancer with nervous dyspepsia or with gastralgia, but with the
progress of the disease the error usually becomes apparent.What has
already been said concerning the symptomatology and the diagnosis of
gastric cancer furnishes a sufficient basis for the differential
diagnosis between this disease and nervous affections of the stomach.Chronic interstitial gastritis or fibroid induration of the stomach
cannot be distinguished with any certainty from cancer of the stomach.Fibroid induration of the stomach is of longer duration than gastric
cancer, and it is less frequently attended by severe pain and
hemorrhage.Sometimes a hard, smooth tumor presenting the contours of
the stomach can be felt, but this cannot be distinguished from diffuse
cancerous infiltration of the stomach.Non-malignant stenosis of the pylorus is of longer duration than cancer
of the pylorus.The symptoms of dilatation of the stomach are common to
both diseases.Cicatricial stenosis is the most common form of
non-malignant pyloric stenosis.This is usually preceded by symptoms of
gastric ulcer which may date back for many years.Non-malignant
stenosis more frequently occurs under forty years of age than does
cancer.The diagnosis between malignant and non-malignant stenosis of
the pylorus is in some cases impossible.Although the surest ground for the diagnosis of gastric cancer is the
appearance of tumor, there are cases in which it is difficult to decide
whether the tumor really belongs to the stomach, and even should it be
{572} established that the tumor is of the stomach, there may still be
doubt whether or not it is cancerous.The diagnosis between cancerous and non-cancerous tumors of the
stomach, such as sarcoma, fibroma, myoma, etc., hardly comes into
consideration.The latter group of tumors rarely produces symptoms
unless the tumor is so situated as to obstruct one of the orifices of
the stomach.Even in this case a positive diagnosis of the nature of
the tumor is impossible.Of greater importance is the distinction between cancerous tumors of
the stomach and tumors produced by thickening of the tissues and by
adhesions around old ulcers of the stomach.Besides the non-progressive
character of the small and usually indistinct tumors occasionally
caused by ulcers or their cicatrices, the main points in diagnosis are
the age of the patient and the existence, often for years, of symptoms
of gastric ulcer antedating the discovery of the tumor.The long
duration of symptoms of chronic catarrhal gastritis and of dilatation
of the stomach is also the main ground for distinguishing from cancer a
tumor produced by hypertrophic stenosis of the pylorus.Tumors of organs near the stomach are liable to be mistaken for cancer
of the stomach.The differential diagnosis between gastric cancer on
the one hand, and tumors of the left lobe of the liver and tumors of
the pancreas on the other hand, is often one of great difficulty.Tumors of the liver are generally depressed by inspiration, whereas
tumors of the stomach are much less frequently affected by the
respiratory movements.The percussion note over tumors of the liver is
flat, while a tympanitic quality is usually associated with the dulness
over tumors of the stomach.Light percussion will often bring out a
zone of tympanitic resonance between the hepatic flatness and the
dulness of gastric tumors.Gastric tumors are usually more movable than
hepatic tumors.By palpation the lower border of the liver can perhaps
be felt and separated from the tumor in case this belongs to the
stomach.Most of the points of distinction based upon these physical
signs fail in cases in which a gastric cancer becomes firmly adherent
to the liver.The basis for a diagnosis must then be sought in the
presence or the absence of marked disturbance of the gastric functions,
particularly of haematemesis, vomiting, and dilatation of the stomach.On the other hand, ascites and persistent jaundice would speak in favor
of hepatic cancer.There are cases in which the diagnosis between
hepatic cancer and gastric cancer cannot be made.This is especially
true of tumors of the left lobe of the liver, which grow down over the
stomach and compress it, and which are accompanied by marked
derangement of the gastric functions.The frequency with which cancer
of the stomach is associated with secondary cancer of the liver should
be borne in mind in considering the diagnosis.There are certain symptoms which in many cases justify a probable
diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas, but this disease can rarely be
distinguished with any certainty from cancer of the stomach.The
situation of the tumor is the same in both diseases.With pancreatic
cancer the pain is less influenced by taking food, the vomiting is less
prominent as a symptom, and anorexia, haematemesis, and dilatation of
the stomach are less common than with gastric cancer.Of the positive
symptoms in {573} favor of cancer of the pancreas, the most important
are jaundice, fatty stools, and sugar in the urine.Of these symptoms
jaundice is the most common.Should there be any suspicion that the tumor is caused by impaction of
feces, a positive opinion should be withheld until laxatives have been
given.Mistakes may occur as to the diagnosis between gastric cancer and
tumors of the omenta, the mesentery, the transverse colon, the
lymphatic glands, and even the spleen or the kidney.Encapsulated
peritoneal exudations near the stomach have been mistaken for gastric
cancer.Where a mistake is likely to occur each individual case
presents its own peculiarities, which it is impossible to deal with in
a general way.Of the utmost importance is a careful physical
exploration of the characters and relations of the tumor, aided, if
necessary, by artificial distension of the stomach or of the colon by
gas (see page 549).No less important is the attentive observance of
the symptoms of each case.In doubtful cases fluids withdrawn from the
stomach by the stomach-tube should be carefully examined for cancerous
fragments, and the gastric fluids may be tested for free hydrochloric
acid by methods already described.Pyloric cancers which receive a marked pulsation from the aorta
sometimes raise a suspicion of aneurism, but the differential diagnosis
is not usually one of great difficulty.Gastric cancer when it presses
upon the aorta may simulate aneurism, not only by the presence of
pulsation, but also by the existence of a bruit over the tumor.The
tumor produced by aneurism is generally smoother and rounder than that
caused by cancer.The pulsation of an aneurism is expansile, but the
impulse of a tumor resting upon an artery is lifting and generally
without lateral expansion.The impulse transmitted to a tumor resting
upon the abdominal aorta may be lessened by placing the patient upon
his hands and knees.Sometimes the tumor can be moved with the hands
off from the artery, so that the pulsation momentarily ceases.A severe
boring pain in the back, shooting down into the loins and the lower
extremities, and not dependent upon the condition of the stomach,
characterizes abdominal aneurism, but is not to be expected in gastric
cancer.With aneurism gastric disorders and constitutional disturbance
are much less prominent than with cancer of the stomach.[94]

[Footnote 94: In a case of pulsating pyloric cancer observed by Bierner
the symptoms were much more in favor of aneurism than of cancer.The
cancer had extended to the retro-peritoneal glands, which partially
surrounded and compressed the aorta.There were marked lateral
pulsation of the tumor, distinct systolic bruit, diminution of the
femoral pulse, and severe lancinating pain in the back and sacral
region.With the exception of vomiting, the gastric symptoms were
insignificant.The patient was only thirty-three years old (Ott, _Zur
Path.des Magencarcinoms_, Zurich, 1867, p.Spasm of the upper part of the rectus abdominis muscle may simulate a
tumor in the epigastric region.The diagnosis is made by noting the
correspondence in shape and position between the tumor and a division
of the rectus muscle, the superficial character of the tumor, the
effect of different positions of the body upon the distinctness of the
tumor, the tympanitic resonance over the tumor, and, should there still
be any doubt, by anaesthetizing the patient, when the phantom tumor
will disappear.Spasm of the rectus muscle has been observed in cases
of cancer of the stomach.{574} Attention is also called to the possibility of mistaking in
emaciated persons the head of the normal pancreas, or less frequently
the mesentery and lymphatic glands, for a tumor.[95] As emaciation
progresses the at first doubtful tumor may even appear to increase in
size and distinctness.[Footnote 95: In the case of the late Comte de Chambord the diagnosis
of gastric cancer was made upon what appeared to be very good grounds.No cancer, however, existed, and the ill-defined tumor which was felt
during life in the epigastric region proved to be the mesentery
containing considerable fat (Vulpian, "La derniere Maladie de M. le
Comte de Chambord."It is sufficient to call attention to the danger of mistaking, in cases
where the gastric symptoms are not prominent and no tumor exists,
gastric cancer for pernicious anaemia, senile marasmus, or the chronic
phthisis of old age.In some of these cases the diagnosis is
impossible, but the physician should bear in mind the possibility of
gastric cancer in the class of cases here considered, and should search
carefully for a tumor or other symptom which may aid in the diagnosis.The possibility of mistaking gastric cancer accompanied with peritoneal
exudation for cirrhosis of the liver or for tubercular peritonitis is
also to be borne in mind.The diagnosis of the position of the cancer in the stomach can usually
be made in cases of cancer of the cardia or of the pylorus.The
symptoms diagnostic of cancer of the cardia are dysphagia,
regurgitation of food, obstruction in the passage of the oesophageal
bougie, and sinking in of the epigastric region in consequence of
atrophy of the stomach.It has already been said that catheterization
of the oesophagus does not always afford the evidence of obstruction
which one would expect.Cancerous stenosis of the cardia is to be
distinguished from cicatricial stenosis in this situation.The
diagnosis is based upon the history of the case, which is generally
decisive, and upon finding fragments of cancer in the tube passed down
the oesophagus.That the cancer is seated at the pylorus is made evident by the
situation of the tumor (see p.561) and by the existence of dilatation
of the stomach.There are many more causes of stenosis of the pylorus
than of stenosis of the cardia, so that, notwithstanding the absence of
tumor, cancer of the cardia is often more readily diagnosticated than
cancer of the pylorus.The greatest difficulty in diagnosis is presented by cancers which do
not obstruct the orifices of the stomach.Many of these cancers run an
almost latent course so far as the gastric symptoms are concerned, and
in case they produce no recognizable tumor and are unattended with
hemorrhage, the difficulties in their diagnosis are almost
insurmountable.In general, a diagnosis of the particular form of cancer which is
present cannot be made, nor is such a diagnosis of any practical value.In very exceptional cases such a diagnosis might be made by the
examination of secondary subcutaneous cancers[96] or of fragments found
in the fluids obtained from the stomach.[Footnote 96: As for example, in Finlay's case, already referred to (p.It is not safe to trust implicitly in this criterion, as the
subcutaneous tumors may be of a different nature from the tumor of the
stomach, as in an interesting case observed by Leube (_op.Although the diagnosis of gastric cancer can generally be made before
the death of the patient, unfortunately a positive diagnosis in the
early stages of the disease is usually impossible.Should resection of
cancer {575} of the stomach become a legitimate operation in surgery,
it will be of the utmost importance to make the diagnosis in an early
stage of the disease.Only those cases are suitable for resection in
which there are no secondary deposits, the general health of the
patient is in fair condition, and extensive adhesions have not been
formed.It was to be hoped that the ingenious instrument devised by
Mikulicz for exploring the interior of the stomach by electrical
illumination would prove a valuable aid in diagnosis.The gastroscope
in its present construction, however, has proved of little value.[97]
It is, moreover, difficult to manipulate, and is not free from danger
to the patient.We may be permitted, however, to hope for improvement
in this direction.[Footnote 97: Mikulicz has observed with the gastroscope in a case of
pyloric cancer immobility of the pylorus and absence of rugae in the
mucous membrane of the pyloric region (_Wiener med.Wochenschr._, 1883,
No.It does not seem probable that there can be anything peculiar
to cancer in these appearances.]In cases in which there is reasonable suspicion of the existence of
gastric cancer, and in which there is proper ground to contemplate
resection of the tumor, it is justifiable to make an exploratory
incision into the abdomen.It can then be decided whether or not cancer
exists, and whether the case is suitable for operation.When this
incision is made with all of the precautions known to modern surgery,
it is attended with little or no danger,[98] and it should not be made
except by surgeons who are practically familiar with these precautions.[Footnote 98: Of 20 exploratory incisions for tumor of the stomach
performed by Billroth, not one had ended fatally (_Deutsche med.Wochenschrift_, 1882, ii.).]PROGNOSIS.--There is no proof that cancer of the stomach has ever ended
in recovery.It may be admitted that partial cicatrization of gastric
cancer may occur.We have, however, no sufficient reason to believe
that cancer of the stomach has ever been completely destroyed by any
process of nature or by any medicinal treatment.A successful resection of a cancer of the pylorus by Billroth in
January, 1881, made a great sensation in the medical world.Since that
time the operation has been performed successfully ten times, and with
fatal issue twenty-seven times.A radical cure has not, however, been
effected, although life has been prolonged for a year and a half after
the operation.[99] The possibility of permanent cure of gastric cancer
by extirpation must be admitted.Enthusiasm over this possibility,
however, is seriously lessened by the fact that a radical cure is not
to be expected unless the operation is undertaken when the tumor is of
small size, has produced no distant metastases, is free from many
adhesions, and the patient is not greatly prostrated.In view of the
difficulty of diagnosis in the early stages it is not likely that these
favorable conditions can be fulfilled except in the rarest instances.Metastases may already exist when the tumor is small and before it has
given rise to any symptoms.[100] Pylorectomy, moreover, will probably
be successful in the hands of only comparatively few surgeons.It is
therefore but a feeble glimmer of hope {576} which is now admitted to
the hitherto relentlessly fatal forecast of this disease.[Footnote 99: Several of the patients are still living (1884), but, so
far as I can learn, no patient has survived the operation more than a
year and a half.][Footnote 100: Birch-Hirschfeld relates a case in which a non-ulcerated
cancerous tumor not larger than a silver half-dollar was found in the
pyloric region of the stomach of a woman who died from injury.The
tumor had given rise to no symptoms.Nevertheless, numerous metastases
existed in the lymphatic glands of the omentum and of the lesser
curvature (_Jahresb.d. gesellschaft f. Natur u. Heilk.im Dresden_
[1882-83], 1883, p.TREATMENT.--Even up to the present time various drugs have been vaunted
as effecting a radical cure of cancer of the stomach.Some of these,
such as mercury, are positively harmful; others, such as conium,
belladonna, and condurango, are often palliative; but not one has been
proven to be curative.Since its recommendation by Friedreich in 1874,
condurango has enjoyed the greatest vogue.The few observations in
which, under the use of this agent, tumors, real or apparent, of the
stomach have lessened in size or disappeared, admit of other
interpretations than as cures of gastric cancer.There is, however,
considerable testimony as to the virtues of condurango as a stomachic.In some cases it relieves the pain, vomiting, and indigestion of
gastric cancer, but in many cases it is employed without benefit.The
drug which passes by the name of condurango in the market is a very
variable preparation.According to Friedreich's directions, decoction
of condurango is prepared as follows: Macerate oz.condurango for twelve hours with fluidounce xij of water; then boil
down to fluidounce vj and strain.The dose is a tablespoonful two or
three times daily.The decoction of condurango may be combined with
syr.While all specific treatment of gastric cancer is to be abandoned, much
can be done for the relief and comfort of the patient.In general, the indications are similar to those in gastric ulcer.It
is not necessary, however, to restrict the diet to the same extent as
in gastric ulcer.The patient's tastes may be consulted to a
considerable extent.Still, it will be found, as a rule, that the
patient is most comfortable when his diet is confined to
easily-digestible substances, such as milk, beef-juice, Leube's
beef-solution, rare beefsteak, and other articles mentioned under the
treatment of gastric ulcer.The pain of gastric cancer will usually require the administration of
opium in some form.There is manifestly not the same objection to the
employment of narcotics in a necessarily fatal disease like cancer as
in ulcer of the stomach.Opium may be given in pill form or as the
tincture or deodorized tincture, or often most advantageously as
hypodermic injections of morphia, to which atropia may be added.Vomiting is sometimes controlled by regulation of the diet,
particularly by iced milk.For this symptom also opium or morphia is
often necessary.In addition, the customary remedies for relief of
vomiting, such as bits of ice, iced champagne, soda-water, hydrocyanic
acid, oxalate of cerium, creasote, may be tried.Cold or hot
applications to the abdomen and mild counter-irritants, such as mustard
plaster or turpentine stupes, sometimes afford relief.If the vomiting
be incoercible, it may be well to administer food for a short time
exclusively by the rectum, and in case of stenosing cancer of the
cardia this method of administering food may be the only one possible.Acid eructations and heartburn are often relieved by the antacids, as
bicarbonate of sodium, lime-water, or calcined magnesia.Against
fermentative processes in the stomach have been recommended salicylate
of sodium, creasote, carbolic acid, and the alkaline hyposulphites.Charcoal tablets are as useful as, and less likely to disagree than,
other antifermentatives.{577} In view of V. d. Velden's
investigations, already mentioned, the administration of dilute
hydrochloric acid in an hour after a meal is indicated.Excellent results have been obtained by regularly washing out the
stomach in cases of gastric cancer, particularly in pyloric cancer with
dilatation of the stomach.By this procedure pain, indigestion, and
vomiting are often greatly relieved, and the patient experiences a
renewed sense of well-being.Unfortunately, the benefit is only
temporary.The syphon process is most conveniently employed.Contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube are copious
gastrorrhagia and great weakness of the patient.When constipation is not relieved by washing out the stomach, enemata
should be employed.Drastic purgatives should not be given.For diarrhoea opium may be given, particularly in the form of small
enemata of starch and laudanum.Scanty hemorrhage in the form of coffee-grounds vomiting requires no
treatment.Copious haematemesis is to be treated according to the
principles laid down under the treatment of hemorrhage from gastric
ulcer.Discussion of the surgical treatment of gastric cancer of course does
not belong to this work.The opinion entertained by the physician as to
the propriety of surgical interference in gastric cancer is not,
however, a matter of indifference, for cases of gastric cancer come
first into the hands of the physician, and generally only by his
recommendation into those of the surgeon.So long as the physician
stands absolutely powerless before this disease, his general attitude
as to the propriety of surgical interference should not be one of
hostility.Experience only can determine the justification of surgical
operation in cases of gastric cancer.As yet, it is too soon to express
a positive opinion as to the value of resection of gastric cancer.Of
37 published resections of cancer of the pylorus, 27 died from the
effects of the operation, and of the fatal cases 18 within the first
twenty-four hours.These results are certainly not calculated to awaken
much enthusiasm for the operation.Still, it would be wrong to draw
definite conclusions from the existing statistics of resection of the
cancerous pylorus, partly because the number of operations is as yet
too small, partly because the operation has been done when it was
certainly unwarrantable according to the best judges (Billroth,
Czerny), and chiefly because the number of operators in proportion to
the number of operations is too great.For the 37 published operations
there have been 27 operators.Ovariotomy was not considered a
justifiable operation until the excellent results of individual
operators were obtained.It is probable that to an even greater extent
resection of the pylorus will become the specialty of certain
operators.Therefore, before concluding as to the value of resection of
cancer of the stomach it is necessary to await the results of
individual surgeons in a series of cases.[101]

[Footnote 101: Already, from this point of view, the operation appears
more hopeful.Czerny has performed 6 resections of the stomach with
only 2 fatal results; 4 of the operations were pylorectomies for
cancer.Billroth has performed the operation 8 times with 3 fatal
results (_Wiener med.Wochenschrift_, 1884, Nos.So much, however, is now certain, that with our present means of
diagnosis the number of cases suitable for extirpation is very
small.[102] A {578} radical cure is to be expected only in the rarest
instances, so that the value of the operation will depend chiefly upon
the condition of the patient after its performance.As regards this
point, the results in the successful cases have been encouraging.In
several instances the terrible sufferings of the patient have given
place to months of comparative health and comfort.[Footnote 102: Billroth at the eleventh session of the Congress of
German Surgeons said that he was amazed at the number of resections of
the pylorus which had been performed.Out of 50 to 60 cases of gastric
cancer, only 1 appeared to him suitable for operation.]In cases of extreme cancerous stenosis of the pylorus which are not
suitable for resection Wolfler proposed forming a fistulous
communication between the stomach and the small intestine
(gastro-enterostomy).The results of the operation have not been
encouraging.Out of six cases in which this operation has been
performed, only two patients lived after the operation.For the same condition Schede proposed making a duodenal fistula
(duodenostomy), but I am not aware that the operation has been
performed.The results of gastrostomy for relief of cancerous stenosis of the
cardia or of the oesophagus have not been encouraging.[103]

[Footnote 103: Of 76 cases of gastrostomy for the relief of cancer of
the oesophagus or of the cardia, only 14 lived over thirty days
(Leisrink and Alsberg, _Arch.Non-Cancerous Tumors of the Stomach.Little clinical interest attaches to non-cancerous tumors of the
stomach.They are comparatively rare and usually unattended by
symptoms.Even should a tumor be discovered, there are no means of
determining the nature of the tumor; and if symptoms are produced by
the tumor, the case will probably be diagnosticated as one of cancer.It is necessary, therefore, in the present work to do little more than
enumerate the different forms of non-cancerous tumor of the stomach.The most common of benign gastric tumors are polypi projecting into the
interior of the stomach.These are usually so-called mucous or
adenomatous polypi, being composed of hypertrophied or hyperplastic
elements of the mucous membrane with or without new growth of submucous
tissue.They may be present in large number (one hundred and fifty to
two hundred in a case of Leudet's).Their development is usually
attributed to a chronic catarrhal gastritis, so that a gastritis
polypora has been distinguished.These polyps are important only when
they obstruct one of the orifices of the stomach, in which case they
may cause even fatal stenosis.Benign adenomata appear less frequently as growths in the submucous
coat of the stomach (Winiwarter).Myomata and myosarcomata, projecting sometimes as polyps either into
the gastric or the peritoneal cavity, may attain a very large size, as
in a case reported by Brodowski in which a cystic myosarcoma of the
stomach weighed twelve pounds.[104]

[Footnote 104: _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Sarcoma, either as a primary or a secondary tumor of the stomach, is
rare.Two cases of secondary lympho-sarcoma of the stomach (primary of
the retro-peritoneal glands) without gastric symptoms have come under
my observation.In a similar case reported by Coupland the symptoms
resembled those of gastric cancer.[105]

[Footnote 105: _Trans.{579} In connection with gastric ulcer mention has already been made of
the occurrence of miliary aneurisms in the stomach, which may be the
cause of fatal haematemesis.Sometimes the mucous membrane is studded with little cysts, as in a
case reported by Harris.[106]

[Footnote 106: _Am.Fibromata and lipomata are very rare.Foreign bodies in the stomach, particularly balls of hair, have been
sometimes mistaken for tumors, particularly cancer, of this organ.Schonborn removed successfully a ball of hair from the stomach by
gastrotomy.[107] Before the operation the tumor was considered to be a
movable kidney.{580}

HEMORRHAGE FROM THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.Hemorrhage from the stomach is a symptom, and not a disease.It is a
result of a great variety of morbid conditions in the description of
which it receives more or less consideration.Already the
symptomatology and treatment of hemorrhage from the stomach have been
considered in connection with its two most important causes--namely,
gastric ulcer and gastric cancer.It remains to give a summary of the
etiology and diagnosis of gastric hemorrhage.Hemorrhage from the stomach is also called gastrorrhagia.The term
haematemesis is not synonymous with gastric hemorrhage, for blood may
be vomited which has simply been swallowed or has passed from the
intestine into the stomach.ETIOLOGY.--The causes of gastric hemorrhage are as follows:

1.Ulcer of the Stomach.--Simple gastric ulcer is the most frequent
cause of abundant hemorrhage from the stomach.Tuberculous gastric
ulcers, typhoid gastric ulcers, and the ulcers of phlegmonous gastritis
are extremely rare causes of hemorrhage.Hemorrhagic erosion of the
stomach, which by many writers is assigned an important place in the
etiology of gastric hemorrhage, is not an independent affection, and in
my opinion is without any clinical significance.Cancer of the Stomach.--(Non-cancerous tumors of the stomach hardly
deserve mention in this connection, so infrequently are they the cause
of gastric hemorrhage.)Traumatism (mechanical, chemical, thermic).--_a_.Acting from
without the stomach: severe injury to the abdomen, as by a blow or a
fall; penetrating wounds of the stomach.Acting from within the stomach: foreign bodies, particularly
sharp-pointed ones; corrosive poisons, as acids and alkalies; other
toxic inflammatory irritants; and very hot substances.Here should also
be mentioned injury from an inflexible stomach-tube and aspiration of
mucous membrane with the stomach-pump.Diseases of the Gastric Blood-vessels.--_a_.Aneurism of the
arteries of the stomach.Miliary aneurisms have been found by Galliard
and others as a cause of profuse and even fatal hemorrhage from the
stomach.Especially in obscure cases should careful search be made for
miliary aneurisms.Varices of the veins are a not unimportant cause of gastric
hemorrhage.They are most frequently associated with chronic passive
{581} congestion of the stomach, but they may be found without any
apparent disturbance of the circulation.Degenerations of the vessels, particularly fatty and atheromatous
degeneration of the arteries.Probably gastric hemorrhage in
phosphorus-poisoning is to be attributed to fatty degeneration of the
arteries.Amyloid degeneration of the blood-vessels is a doubtful cause
of hemorrhage.Active Congestion of the Stomach.--Here is usually placed gastric
hemorrhage as a result of severe inflammation of the stomach (as acute
catarrhal gastritis), although in these cases the inflammatory
alteration of the vascular walls is an equally important factor.With more probability the so-called vicarious hemorrhages from the
stomach are to be assigned to active congestion.Sceptical as one is
inclined to be as regards vicarious hemorrhages of the menses, the
occurrence of such hemorrhages, although rare, must be admitted.Doubtful, however, are alleged cases of gastric hemorrhage taking the
place of suppressed hemorrhoidal bleeding or of epistaxis.Passive Congestion of the Stomach.--This embraces an important group
of causes of gastric hemorrhage.This hemorrhage is the result of
venous congestion caused by some obstruction to the portal circulation.The obstruction may be--

_a_.In the portal vein itself or its branches within the liver, as in
pylethrombosis, cirrhosis of the liver, tumors, such as cancer or
echinococcus cysts, compressing the portal vein, occlusion of
capillaries in the liver by pigment-deposits in melanaemia, and
dilatation of the bile-ducts in the liver from obstruction to the flow
of bile.Next to ulcer and to cancer of the stomach, cirrhosis of the
liver is the most frequent and important cause of gastrorrhagia.In the pulmonary blood-vessels, as in pulmonary emphysema, chronic
pleurisy, and fibroid induration of the lungs.In the heart in consequence of uncompensated valvular and other
diseases of the heart.For evident reasons, obstruction of the pulmonary or of the cardiac
circulation is much less likely to cause gastric hemorrhage than is
obstruction in the portal vein or the liver.Possibly, gastric hemorrhage which is caused by violent acts of
vomiting may be caused by venous congestion of the mucous membrane of
the stomach.In support of this view, Rindfleisch advances the idea
that the veins in the muscular layers of the stomach, in consequence of
the thinness of their coats, are much more likely than the arteries to
suffer from the compression of the muscle during its contraction.The occasional occurrence of gastric hemorrhage during pregnancy has
also been attributed to passive congestion of the stomach.Acute Infectious Diseases--namely, yellow fever, acute yellow
atrophy of the liver, relapsing fever; less frequently cholera, typhoid
fever, typhus fever, diphtheria, erysipelas, and the exanthematous
fevers, small-pox, measles, and scarlet fever.The cause of gastric hemorrhage in these diseases is not understood.The usual explanation attributes the hemorrhage to dissolution of the
blood-corpuscles and secondary alteration of the walls of the
blood-vessels.Plugging of the vessels with micro-organisms has been
found {582} in only a few instances.The gastrorrhagia of acute yellow
atrophy of the liver has been attributed to dissolution of the blood,
not only by some infectious agent, but also by constituents of the
bile, and also to obstruction of the portal circulation by destruction
and occlusion of capillaries in the liver.Hemorrhagic
diatheses--namely, scorbutus, purpura, and haematophilia.Strictly
speaking, a hemorrhagic diathesis exists in other affections of this
class.Here we may distinguish, first, periodical malarial
hemorrhages from the stomach which are cured by quinia; second,
pernicious gastric malarial fever, of very grave prognosis; and third,
hemorrhages in malarial cachexia due to extreme anaemia.Cases which
have been described as malaria with scorbutic complications belong
mostly to the last variety.Mention has already been made of gastric
hemorrhages attributed to malarial pigmentation of the liver.The most important affections in this category
are progressive pernicious anaemia, leucocythaemia, and
pseudo-leucocythaemia, including the so-called splenic anaemia.The hemorrhage is attributed to dissolution of the
blood-corpuscles by the action of the biliary salts.Gastric hemorrhage is a rare event in Bright's disease, occurring more
especially with small kidneys.In one such case I found that the fatal
hemorrhage was due to the bursting of a miliary aneurism of a small
artery in the submucous coat.Probably in all similar cases the
hemorrhage is referable to disease of the vascular walls.Neuropathic Conditions.--Although ecchymoses in the mucous membrane
of the stomach can be experimentally produced by injury of various
parts of the brain and spinal cord, there is no proof that gastric
hemorrhage which is of any clinical importance is referable to
structural diseases of the nervous system.The occasional occurrence of
gastric hemorrhage in progressive paralysis of the insane, in
tuberculous meningitis, in epilepsy, is to be attributed to other
causes.In lack of a better explanation, however, the gastric hemorrhages which
have been occasionally observed in hysterical women may be classified
here.These constitute not the least important class of gastric
hemorrhages.The hemorrhages from the stomach in chlorosis belong
partly here and partly to anaemia.Melaena Neonatorum.--Although in some cases ulcers have been found
in the stomach or duodenum, and in others a general hemorrhagic
diathesis exists, it must be said that the etiology of this grave
disease is still very obscure.Bursting of Aneurisms or of Abscesses from without into the
Stomach.Idiopathic Causes.--Under this unsatisfactory designation are
included cases which are aptly described by Flint[1] in the following
words: "Hemorrhage sometimes occurs from the stomach, as from the
bronchial tubes, the Schneiderian membrane, and in other situations,
without any apparent pathological connections, neither following nor
preceding any appreciable morbid conditions.It is then to be
considered {583} as idiopathic."A person in apparent health has
suddenly a hemorrhage, often profuse, from the stomach, which is
followed only by symptoms immediately referable to the hemorrhage.The
hemorrhage is naturally the source of great anxiety.Ulcer or cancer of
the stomach or some other grave disease is usually suspected.But the
patient develops no further symptoms, and often never has another
hemorrhage.Whatever hypotheses one may construct for these cases of
so-called idiopathic hemorrhage, the recognition of the clinical fact
of their occurrence is important.[Footnote 1: Austin Flint, _A Treatise on the Principles and Practice
of Medicine_, 5th ed., p.Inasmuch as hemorrhage from the stomach is usually made manifest by the
vomiting of blood, it is important to bear in mind that gastric
hemorrhage is not the only cause of haematemesis.Blood may gain access
to the stomach by being swallowed in cases of hemorrhages from the
nose, mouth, throat, bronchi, lungs, and oesophagus.Blood may also
enter the stomach from the duodenum in cases of simple ulcer of the
duodenum or of typhoid ulcers situated in the upper part of the
intestine.The SYMPTOMS of hemorrhage from the stomach have already been described
in connection with ULCER OF THE STOMACH.MORBID ANATOMY.--As is evident from the enumeration of the causes of
gastric hemorrhage, the lesions found after death are manifold.A
description of these lesions, however, does not belong here.It is
necessary, however, to say a few words concerning the demonstration of
the source of the hemorrhage.The hemorrhage is arterial, venous, or capillary in origin.Ulcerations
from the stomach into the heart, which have been mentioned in
connection with gastric ulcer, are too infrequent to come into
consideration in this connection.If the bleeding is from a large
artery or vein or from a medium-sized aneurism or varix, the
demonstration of its source is not difficult.Often, however, in cases
of fatal gastric hemorrhage the search for the source of the hemorrhage
has proved fruitless.It is supposed that in many such cases the
hemorrhage is due to diapedesis, and not to rupture of a blood-vessel
(rhexis).Doubtless, small gastric hemorrhages, particularly those into
the tissues of the stomach, are often the result of diapedesis, but in
cases of profuse hemorrhages from the stomach where the source of the
hemorrhage is not demonstrable after death, the convenient assumption
of hemorrhage by diapedesis, in my opinion, plays too important a role.In most cases of profuse gastrorrhagia the symptoms point to a sudden
outpouring of blood into the stomach; and our knowledge of diapedesis
does not warrant the belief that the red blood-corpuscles can escape
through the unsuffused walls of the vessels with that combined rapidity
and abundance which would be necessary to explain the sudden and
profuse hemorrhage.In these cases hemorrhage by rhexis is altogether
more probable even when ruptured vessels cannot be demonstrated.It
often requires a long-continued and careful search to find a small
vessel which is ruptured.In the case above mentioned of fatal
haematemesis from miliary aneurism over an hour of continuous searching
was required to find the pinhole perforation in the mucous membrane in
the bottom of which lay the small aneurism.Chiari[2] has reported a
fatal gastric hemorrhage due to rupture of a submucous vein.The
erosion of the mucous membrane was not larger than a hempseed.The
examination of the mucous membrane is often much impeded by the {584}
closely-adherent mucus and blood, which have to be carefully removed.Injection of the vessels of the stomach with fluid may aid in finding a
ruptured vessel.It is not intended to assert that in all cases of
fatal gastric hemorrhage a painstaking search would reveal the source
of the hemorrhage, but it is believed that cases of fatal gastric
hemorrhage would less frequently be reported with negative anatomical
result as hemorrhages by diapedesis, or by exhalation, or as
parenchymatous or capillary hemorrhages, if such a search were made.Wochenschr._, 1882, No.DIAGNOSIS.--Undoubtedly, small hemorrhages into the stomach often occur
which are not recognized, and in the absence of vomiting even larger
hemorrhages may escape detection unless a careful examination of the
stools be made.The patient may die from abundant gastric hemorrhage
before any blood has been vomited or has passed by the bowels.When there is doubt whether the black color of the stools is due to
blood or to the administration of iron or of bismuth, it generally
suffices to add water to the stools.If blood be present, the water
will acquire a reddish color.Should doubt still remain, then the
microscope, the spectroscope, or the test for haemin crystals may be
called into requisition (see p.Whether black, tarry stools are produced by hemorrhage from the stomach
or by hemorrhage in the upper part of the intestine can be decided only
by the clinical history.If haematemesis be likewise present, the
presumption is strongly in favor of gastric hemorrhage.The diagnosis,
however, between hemorrhage from duodenal ulcer and that from gastric
ulcer is very difficult, and can rarely be positively made.The mere inspection of the vomit is generally sufficient to determine
whether it contain blood or not.Color more or less resembling that of
altered blood may be produced in the vomit by iron, bismuth, red wine,
various fruits, such as cranberries, and by bile.When a careful
inspection by the physician leaves doubt as to the presence of
blood--which will rarely be the case--then here also recourse may be
had to the microscope, spectroscope, and test for haemin crystals.Sometimes blood is swallowed and then vomited by hysterical females or
by malingering soldiers or prisoners for purpose of deceit.In such
cases there are generally no evidences of acute anaemia or of gastric
disease.The blood of some animals can be distinguished by the
microscope from human blood.When suspicion of deceit exists, there are
generally various ways of entrapping the patient.When blood is vomited by nursing infants the possibility of its coming
from the breast of the mother is to be thought of.Sometimes blood from the nose or throat is swallowed, particularly when
the bleeding occurs during the night.This blood may subsequently be
vomited.The inspection of the nose or throat will generally reveal the
source of the hemorrhage in such cases.The diagnosis between hemorrhage from the oesophagus and that from the
stomach must be based upon the clinical history.The oesophagoscope,
however, has been successfully employed for diagnostic purposes.Several cases have been reported of fatal hemorrhage from varices of
the oesophagus.Such hemorrhage cannot be distinguished from gastric
hemorrhage.Much more frequently arises the question whether the hemorrhage is from
the stomach or from the lungs.Sometimes the decision of this point
{585} is very difficult, and it may even be impossible, especially when
the physician is obliged to trust only to the statements of the patient
or his friends.Difficulty in the diagnosis results mainly from the
fact that coughing and vomiting of blood are often associated with each
other.With haemoptysis blood may be swallowed and then vomited, and
with haematemesis more or less coughing occurs.The diagnosis is to be
based upon the points contained in the following table:

          HAEMOPTYSIS.|          HAEMATEMESIS.Usually preceded by symptoms

As it is important that the patient should be as quiet as possible
during and for some time after the hemorrhage, any physical examination
which disturbs the patient, such as percussing the posterior part of
the chest or palpating the abdomen, should be avoided.The diagnosis of the many causes of gastric hemorrhage belongs to the
description of the various diseases which have been enumerated under
the etiology.PROGNOSIS.--It is exceptional for gastric hemorrhage to prove
immediately fatal.According to Fox, such an occurrence is more
frequent with cirrhosis of the liver than with ulcer or cancer of the
stomach.The ultimate result of the hemorrhage depends greatly upon the
previous condition of the patient.If this condition was good, he often
rallies from the most desperate prostration immediately following the
hemorrhage.A previously enfeebled patient is of course more likely to
yield to the further anaemia and exhaustion caused by profuse
hemorrhage.Although the symptoms of gastric ulcer and of cirrhosis of
the liver are sometimes improved after hemorrhage from the stomach,
nevertheless this hemorrhage can never be regarded as a welcome event.For the treatment of gastric hemorrhage see ULCER OF THE STOMACH.{586}

DILATATION OF THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.DEFINITION.--By dilatation of the stomach is understood a condition in
which the stomach is abnormally large and is unequal to the performance
of its normal functions.It will be observed that this definition of
dilatation of the stomach includes an anatomical disturbance and a
physiological disturbance.A stomach which, although unusually large,
performs its functions perfectly well is not, in the clinical sense, a
dilated stomach.The most characteristic functional disturbance in
dilatation of the stomach is delay in the propulsion of the gastric
contents into the intestine in consequence of inability of the muscular
coat of the stomach to perform the work imposed upon it.This muscular
insufficiency, whether primary or secondary, necessarily involves
disorder of the digestive and absorptive powers of the stomach.SYNONYMS.--Dilatatio ventriculi; Gastrectasia.It has been proposed to
call the early stages of the disease insufficiency of the stomach
(Rosenbach).The condition described by Chomel as dyspepsia of liquids
is undoubtedly dilatation of the stomach.HISTORY.--Dilatation as a disease of the stomach is not mentioned by
writers of antiquity.Fabricius ab Aquapendente in 1623 was among the
first to record an observation of dilatation of the stomach.During the
following century cases of dilatation of the stomach were recorded more
as curiosities than as of clinical interest.Most cases were attributed
to eating or drinking inordinate quantities.In 1743, Widman clearly
recognized stenosis of the pylorus as a cause of gastric dilatation.In
the works of Van Swieten, Morgagni, Lieutaud, and J. P. Frank, during
the latter half of the last century, different causes of dilatation of
the stomach are recognized.The last writer especially distinguishes
clearly between dilatation due to stenosis and that due to atony.The
data as to the symptoms of the disease were still very imperfect.In
1833, Duplay[1] published an important article in which the main points
in the causation and symptomatology of dilatation of the stomach are
clearly described.After this time the important works on the practice
of medicine or on diseases of the stomach contain, in the main, correct
descriptions of the disease under consideration.Since the publication
in 1869 of Kussmaul's memorable article[2] on the treatment of
dilatation of the stomach by the {587} stomach-pump, much greater
attention has been paid to this disease than ever before, so that the
literature upon this subject during the last fifteen years is very
considerable.In 1875, Penzoldt published an excellent monograph upon
dilatation of the stomach.[3]

[Footnote 1: _Arch.[Footnote 2: _Deutsches Arch.Kussmaul
first employed the stomach-pump in dilatation of the stomach in 1867,
and in that year he reported a successful result (_Schmidt's Jahrb._,
Bd.[Footnote 3: _Die Magenerweiterung_, Erlangen, 1875.To this work I am
indebted for most of the historical data in the text.]ETIOLOGY.--Dilatation of the stomach is the result of inability of this
organ to propel its contents into the intestine within the normal space
of time.In the performance of this mechanical work three factors are
involved--namely, the muscular force of the stomach, the quantity and
quality of the gastric contents, and the size of the opening between
the stomach and the intestine.All causes of dilatation of the stomach
may be referred to abnormalities of one or more of these factors.The most important group of causes is represented by stenosis of the
pyloric orifice or of the adjacent part of the stomach or of the
intestine.[4] Most cases of hypertrophic dilatation of the
stomach--that is, dilatation with hypertrophy of the muscular walls of
the stomach--are produced by causes belonging to this group.[Footnote 4: Dilatation of the stomach in consequence of intestinal
obstruction below the duodenum is so rare that no further attention is
given to the subject in the present article.The term pyloric stenosis
is often used in the course of the article to include any obstruction
to the passage of the contents of the stomach into the intestine,
whether the obstruction be in the duodenum, the pyloric orifice, or the
pyloric region.]The most frequent cause of pyloric stenosis is carcinoma, either in the
form of a diffuse infiltration of the gastric walls in this region or
as a tumor projecting into the cavity of the pyloric portion of the
stomach.Next in frequency are cicatricial growths resulting from
simple ulcer involving the pyloric region.Much less frequent are
similar cicatricial stenoses of the pylorus resulting from ulcers
produced by swallowing corrosive poisons.Simple hypertrophy of the
coats of the stomach in the pyloric region, particularly of the fibrous
and muscular coats, is an occasional cause of dilatation.Obstruction
of the pylorus by mucous polypi or by hypertrophic folds of mucous
membrane is so rare as to have little practical interest.Likewise,
stenosis caused by sarcomata, fibromata, myomata, lipomata, and cysts
need be mentioned only for the sake of completeness.Narrowing of the pyloric orifice may be caused also by pressure from
outside of the stomach, as by tumors, particularly cancer, of the liver
and of the pancreas, and by the contraction of fibrous adhesions and
thickenings resulting from perigastritis.Obstruction of the duodenum
by tumors growing in its walls, by cicatrices resulting from ulcers,
and by external pressure may also cause dilatation of the stomach.According to Barker, compression of the duodenum by a wandering right
kidney may induce dilatation of the stomach.The mere association of
dilatation of the stomach and movable right kidney, however, cannot be
considered proof that the former is caused by the latter, for the
subjects of movable kidney (most frequently women with flabby abdominal
walls who have borne many children) are often also favorable subjects
for atonic dilatation of the stomach.Sometimes with dilatation of the stomach the pyloric orifice is found
abnormally small, without any thickening or other appreciable change in
the walls of the pylorus.These cases in adults have been described by
{588} Landerer under the name of congenital stenosis of the pylorus,
but his conclusions are not free from doubt.[5] Congenital stenosis,
and even complete occlusion of the pylorus, has been observed in
infants.[6]

[Footnote 5: _Ueber angeborene Stenose des Pylorus_, Inaug.Diss.,
Tubingen, 1879.In the ten cases studied by Landerer the patients were
all adults, mostly in advanced life.In only one case is it mentioned
that indigestion existed from childhood; the clinical history in all is
incomplete.With the exception of one case there was no marked
hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the stomach, such as is usually
found with benign pyloric stenosis and would naturally be expected with
a stenosis existing since birth.The pyloric orifice varied from 1-1/2
cm.Some of the specimens had been in alcohol for
a considerable time.In my opinion, Landerer has not brought forward
sufficient proof that in these cases stenosis of the pylorus existed
since birth.][Footnote 6: Wunsche, _Jahrb.d. Kinderheilk._, viii.Andral, Forster, and Bull have found congenital stenosis and atresia of
the pylorus.]Spasm of the pyloric muscle, which, according to Kussmaul, may be
referable to erosions, ulcers, and inflammations of the adjacent mucous
membrane, can be admitted only as a hypothetical explanation of some
cases of dilatation of the stomach.Somewhat problematical, although not improbable, is the production of
stenosis of the pylorus or of the duodenum by torsion and by
displacement of these parts.Dilatation of the stomach is sometimes
associated with scrotal hernia, particularly with that containing
omentum or transverse colon.This dilatation Kussmaul explains by the
production of a sharp bend between the movable first part and
comparatively fixed second part of the duodenum, in consequence of the
dragging downward of the stomach by the displaced omentum or transverse
colon.In a similar way Kussmaul believes that the weight of an
over-distended stomach may produce stenosis, and by this mechanism he
explains the occasional occurrence of symptoms of complete pyloric
obstruction when a large quantity of material has accumulated in an
already dilated stomach, and the prompt relief of these symptoms when
the burden of the stomach is removed either by vomiting or by the
stomach-tube.[7]

[Footnote 7: Another explanation given by Kussmaul, and likewise based
upon experiments on the cadaver, is that when the stomach is
over-distended it may rotate upon its own axis, so that the pylorus
acquires a sagittal direction and impinges against the first part of
the duodenum.This rotation of the stomach, however, can occur only
when the abdominal walls are flabby (Kussmaul, "Die Peristaltische
Unruhe des Magens," _Volkmann's Samml.The manner in which stenosis of the pylorus causes dilatation of the
stomach is sufficiently obvious to require no especial explanation.It
is, however, important to know that stenosis of the pylorus may be
compensated, so that even a very considerable degree of obstruction of
this orifice may exist without any dilatation of the stomach.The
obstruction may be completely counteracted by hypertrophy of the
muscular coat of the stomach, particularly of that in the right half of
the organ.Leube suggests that this increased muscular force, by
increasing the peristaltic movements, may also hasten the digestion and
absorption of the food, so far as these processes take place in the
stomach.[8] The timely removal of the contents of the stomach by
vomiting may also prevent over-distension of the organ.Another
compensatory circumstance may be the reduction of the quantity of solid
and liquid food taken by the patient.Conditions are often present,
however, which oppose the development of these {589} compensatory
circumstances.Such conditions are feebleness of the patient,
degeneration of the muscular coat of the stomach, chronic catarrhal
gastritis, insufficient secretion of gastric juice, and delayed
absorption, causing stagnation and fermentation of the food in the
stomach.[Footnote 8: Leube, in _V.Dilatation of the stomach may occur without any obstacle to the
evacuation of the gastric contents into the intestine.The cases of
so-called atonic dilatation of the stomach belong to this class.The
degree of dilatation in these cases is rarely so great as when the
dilatation is caused by stenosis.The cause of gastric dilatation in
the absence of stenosis is not always clear, so that a variety of
hypotheses, more or less probable, have been broached to explain these
obscure cases.Dilatation with unobstructed outlet of the stomach must be referable
either to abnormalities in the quantity or quality of the contents of
the stomach or to weakness of the muscular walls of the stomach.In
most cases both of these causes are combined, and it is not easy to
separate their action.Abnormal gastric contents may be the result of improper ingesta or of
disturbances in gastric digestion.Although in former times the
frequency of excessive eating and drinking as a cause of dilatation of
the stomach was doubtless exaggerated, nevertheless the efficacy of
this cause cannot be doubted.Dilatation of the stomach is said to be
common in people who live almost exclusively upon a vegetable diet and
therefore require large quantities of food.The habitual drinking of
large quantities of beer may cause dilatation of the stomach.The
occasional association of a dilated stomach with diabetes is referred
to the inordinate appetite and thirst which characterize this disease.If the food reaches the stomach imperfectly masticated, the process of
digestion is delayed, and as a result the stomach may become dilated.Indigestible food, particularly that which readily ferments in the
stomach, may be an indirect cause of the disease under consideration.A
similar role may be played by swallowing foreign substances either by
accident or by design.It is not proven that dilatation of the stomach
may be referable to exhaustion of its muscular power by the abuse of
agents which at first excite peristalsis, such as emetics, purgatives,
alcoholics, tobacco, spices, etc.Equally doubtful is the production of
dilatation by the misuse of narcotics, such as opium, which restrain
peristalsis.Of great importance in the production and continuance of gastrectasia
are all circumstances which cause stagnation and fermentation of the
contents of the stomach.These abnormalities of the gastric contents
are referable both to muscular and to chemical insufficiency of the
stomach, but in this connection it is desired to call attention
especially to chemical insufficiency, although in the production of
gastric dilatation this becomes always associated with muscular
insufficiency.In this way chronic catarrhal gastritis is operative in
the causation of gastric dilatation.In consequence of insufficient
secretion of normal gastric juice and of delayed absorption, the food
remains abnormally long undigested in the stomach, and fermentative
changes, with the development of gas, occur.No less important,
however, is the impairment of the muscular power of the stomach in
chronic gastritis.Stagnation and fermentation of the contents of the
stomach occur also in functional or atonic dyspepsia, which is to be
reckoned as a cause of dilatation of the stomach.{590} Naunyn[9]
emphasizes especially the importance of abnormal fermentations in the
stomach (alcoholic, butyric acid, lactic acid, acetic acid
fermentations) both as a cause and as a result of dilatation of the
stomach.Ulcer and cancer of the stomach may cause dilatation by
interfering with the normal digestive processes.[Footnote 9: _Deutsches Arch.We come now to the third and final group of causes of dilatation of the
stomach--namely, those included under weakness of the muscular walls of
the stomach.In the last analysis all causes of gastric dilatation come
under this heading, for even with pyloric stenosis and with excessive
contents a stomach will not dilate so long as its muscular power is
equal to the proper performance of the work which is demanded.In this
connection, however, reference is had especially to those cases in
which impairment or restraint of the muscular movements of the stomach
may be regarded more or less directly as the primary cause of
dilatation of the stomach.Clearest of comprehension are those cases in which the muscular power
of the stomach is impaired by organic changes in the muscular coat.Here may be mentioned partial destruction of the muscular coat,
particularly of that in the pyloric region, by ulcers and by cancers.Thus, ulcers and cancers which in no way obstruct the outlet of the
stomach may cause dilatation of the organ.Inflammatory infiltration
(inflammatory oedema) of the muscular coat has been adduced as a cause
of its weakness in chronic catarrhal gastritis and in peritonitis.Whether this is the proper explanation or not, there is no doubt that
the muscular coat of the stomach may become paretic in cases of chronic
catarrhal gastritis, as well as the subjacent muscle in inflammations
of other mucous membranes, as in laryngitis or in cystitis.Our
knowledge of the relation between degeneration of the muscular coat of
the stomach and gastrectasia is very imperfect.Fatty and colloid
degeneration of the muscle of dilated stomachs is probably to be
interpreted as a secondary change.It is probable that amyloid
degeneration may be a cause of atonic dilatation of the stomach.[10]
Oedematous infiltration of the coats of the stomach in cases of
cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary emphysema, cardiac disease, and
Bright's disease has been assigned as a cause of gastric dilatation,
but without satisfactory evidence.Chronic interstitial gastritis
(cirrhosis of the stomach) is more frequently a cause of contraction
than of dilatation of the stomach.[Footnote 10: Edinger, _ibid._, Bd.The restraint of the muscular movements of the stomach by adhesions and
by dragging downward of the organ in hernia may cause dilatation.Relaxation of the abdominal walls, as in women who have borne many
children, by removing the normal support of the stomach, has been
thought to cause dilatation.Atony of the muscular walls of the stomach may be a part of general
muscular weakness and impaired nutrition.Here belong cases of adynamic
dilatation of the stomach secondary to typhoid fever, cholera,
tuberculosis, anaemia, chlorosis, cachexia, senile marasmus,
neurasthenia.Whether primary paralysis of the stomach can occur or not is wholly
uncertain.We have no positive knowledge as to the occurrence of
paresis of the stomach in consequence of organic or functional changes
{591} in the peripheral or central nervous system.Nor does our meagre
information as to the relation between the nervous system and the
muscular movements of the stomach justify the construction of any
hypotheses as to this point.For the sake of clearness the various causes of dilatation of the
stomach according to the foregoing classification may be recapitulated
as follows.Some of the more doubtful and of the rarer causes are
omitted:

  A. Stenosis of the Pylorus or of the Duodenum.Cancerous;
    2.Cicatricial;
    3.Hypertrophic (of pylorus);
    4.From external pressure;
    5.B. Abnormalities in Contents of Stomach.Ingesta:
      _a_.Excessive;
      _b_.Imperfectly masticated;
      _c_.Stagnation and fermentation in consequence of chemical
         insufficiency of the stomach, as in chronic catarrhal
         gastritis and functional dyspepsia.C. Impairment of Muscular Force of Stomach.Organic changes in muscular coat:
      _a_.Partial destruction by ulcers and cancers;
      _b_.Inflammation, as in chronic catarrhal gastritis and
             peritonitis;
      _c_.Degenerations (fatty, colloid, amyloid);
      _d_.;
      _e_.Mechanical Restraint:
      _a_.By adhesions;
      _b_.Impaired Nutrition and General Muscular Weakness, Adynamic
         dilatation from typhoid fever, tuberculosis, anaemia, etc.As a rule, not a single one, but several, of the above-mentioned causes
are operative in the production of dilatation of the stomach, and it is
often impossible to say which is the primary cause.The various gastric
functions are so dependent upon each other that if one is disturbed the
others also suffer.If, for instance, atony of the muscular coat of the
stomach exists, then in consequence of enfeebled peristalsis the
secretion of gastric juice is insufficient, the food is not thoroughly
mingled with the gastric juice, and the absorption of the products of
digestion in the stomach is interfered with; in consequence of which
the accumulating peptones still further hinder the digestive process.The pylorus remains contracted for an abnormal length of time, as it
naturally is closed until the process of chymification in the stomach
is far advanced, and this process is now delayed.The stagnating
contents of the stomach readily ferment, and the irritating products of
fermentation induce a chronic {592} catarrhal gastritis, which further
impairs the functions of the mucous and muscular coats of the stomach.Thus, in a vicious circle one cause of dilatation induces another.To
assign to each cause its appropriate share in the production of the
final result is a matter of difficulty, and often of impossibility.From this point of view the dispute as to whether in atonic dilatation
the most important factor in causation is chemical insufficiency of the
stomach (impaired secretion of gastric juice, fermentations) or
mechanical insufficiency (weakened muscular action, stagnation),
appears of little practical importance.Of the causes of non-stenotic dilatation of the stomach, the first
place is to be assigned to chronic catarrhal gastritis and to atonic
dyspepsia, as this term is understood by most English and American
writers.As regards frequency, gastric dilatation is a common result of cancer
of the pylorus.It is less frequently caused by simple ulcer.Other
forms of pyloric stenosis than the cancerous and the cicatricial are
rare.Opinions differ as to the frequency of non-stenotic or atonic
dilatation of the stomach according to the manner in which one
interprets the cases.Non-stenotic dilatations which are comparable in
degree to those produced by stenosis are rare.The lesser grades of
atonic dilatation, however, are not rare; but here arises the
difficulty of distinguishing these cases from mere chemical or
mechanical insufficiency of the stomach, which often represents the
early stage of the process.Hence it has been proposed to discard
altogether the term dilatation, and to substitute that of insufficiency
of the stomach.But this latter term is applicable to many affections
of the stomach other than dilatation.A typical case of atonic
dilatation of the stomach is a well-defined disease, and because it is
difficult to diagnosticate its early stages is not sufficient reason
for discarding altogether the designation.Gastrectasia may develop at any age.It is most frequent in middle and
advanced life.The largest number of cases of atonic dilatation is met
with between thirty and forty years of age.[11] The disease occurs in all classes of life.Atonic
dilatation seems to be comparatively more frequent in private practice
and among the favorably situated than in hospitals and among the poor.Kussmaul says that the largest contingent of patients is furnished by
persons who lead a sedentary life and eat and drink a great deal.[Footnote 11: Kundrat and Widerhofer mention no case of stenotic
dilatation of the stomach in children.They say, however, that atonic
dilatation due to over-feeding, and particularly to rachitis, is not
infrequent in children.Widerhofer reports a case of very large
dilatation of the stomach in a girl twelve years old.The cause of the
dilatation was not apparent, and the clinical history was imperfect
(_Gerhardt's Handb.d. Kinderkrankh._, Bd.Lafage
(_These_, Paris, 1881) reports a case of gastric dilatation at ten
years, and another at sixteen years of age.R. Demme (abstract in
_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1883, No.1) reports a case of large
dilatation of the stomach in a boy six and a half years old.Cicatricial stenosis was suspected.Pauli (_De Ventriculi Dilatatione_,
Frankfurt, 1839) reports an enormous dilatation of the stomach,
believed to be due to congenital stenosis.]SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Inasmuch as dilatation of the stomach is usually
secondary to some other disease, the symptoms of the primary disease
have often existed a long time before those of dilatation appear.The subjective symptoms of gastric dilatation are for the most part
directly referable to disturbances of the functions of the stomach.These {593} subjective symptoms alone do not suffice for a positive
diagnosis of the disease.Of the greatest diagnostic importance are an
examination of the vomit and a careful physical exploration of the
stomach.The appetite with dilatation of the stomach may be normal, diminished,
increased, or perverted.In the majority of cases the appetite is
diminished, and there may be complete anorexia.Sometimes the appetite
is increased even to voracity, which is explicable by the small amount
of nutriment which is absorbed.Polyphagia may therefore be a result as
well as a cause of dilatation of the stomach.Often there is excessive thirst in consequence of the small quantity of
fluid absorbed.Dilatation of the stomach in itself does not usually cause sharp
epigastric pain, although it is often associated with painful diseases
of the stomach.There is usually in the region of the stomach a sense of fulness and
weight, which is often distressing and may be accompanied with dull
pain.Heartburn and eructations of gas and of bitter or of acid fluids are
frequently present.The gas is often odorless, but sometimes it is very
offensive.In a number of
cases--which, however, are exceptional--the gas has been found
inflammable, burning usually with a colorless flame (hydrogen), but
rarely, as in a case from Frerichs' clinic, with a bright
yellowish-white flame (hydrocarbons).Detonation upon setting fire to
the gas has been noted.The analysis of the inflammable gas has shown
oxygen and nitrogen in approximately the same proportion as in the
atmosphere, in addition to large quantities of carbonic acid and of
hydrogen, also marsh gas, and in Frerichs' case olefiant gas in small
amount.[12] The oxygen and nitrogen are doubtless simply swallowed, but
the carbonic acid and hydrogen are the result of abnormal fermentations
in the stomach.The origin of the hydrocarbons in the gas is not clear,
but they are probably also produced by fermentation within the stomach.[Footnote 12: One of the analyses in Frerichs' case gave carbonic acid,
17.40; hydrogen, 21.52; marsh gas, 2.71; olefiant gas, traces; oxygen,
11.91; nitrogen, 46.44.In another analysis were found marsh gas,
10.75, and olefiant gas, 0.20.Sulphuretted hydrogen was also present
(Ewald, in _Reichert und Du Bois-Reymond's Archiv_, 1874, p.One of the most frequent symptoms, although not a constant one, of
dilatation of the stomach is vomiting.This symptom often presents
characters which, if not pathognomonic of dilatation, at least raise a
strong presumption in favor of its presence.The act of vomiting is
sometimes accomplished with such ease that it is hardly more than
regurgitation; at other times the act is accompanied with violent and
exhausting retching.A feature particularly characteristic of
dilatation of the stomach is the abundance of the vomited material.In
no other disease is such an enormous quantity evacuated from the
stomach at one time.Blumenthal relates a case in which the vomited
material amounted to sixteen pounds.Such large quantities can
accumulate in the stomach of course only when a considerable time
intervenes between the acts of vomiting.The vomiting of gastric
dilatation does not generally occur until some hours after a meal.It
often presents a certain periodicity, occurring, for instance, at
intervals of two or three days, and followed usually by temporary
relief.It is often observed that as the stomach {594} becomes larger
and larger the vomiting becomes less and less frequent, but at the same
time more abundant.Especially toward a fatal termination of the
disease the walls of the stomach may become so paralyzed and
insensible, and the patient so feeble, that the vomiting ceases
altogether.Another valuable diagnostic sign furnished by the vomit is
the presence of undigested food which has been taken a considerable
time, it may be many days, previously.[13] If the morning vomit
habitually contains undigested food which has been eaten the previous
day, gastric dilatation either exists or is almost sure to develop.[Footnote 13: Ritter relates the case of a man who vomited cherry-pits,
although he had not eaten cherries for over a year (_Canstatt's
Jahresbericht_, 1851, iii.The vomited matter is almost always in a condition of fermentation.If
the vomit be allowed to stand in a vessel, it will separate into three
layers--an upper, frothy; a middle, of turbid fluid, usually yellowish
or brownish in color; and a lower layer, composed of solid particles,
mostly alimentary debris.The vomit often emits an extremely offensive
odor.Different kinds of
fermentation--alcoholic, acetous, lactic acid, and butyric acid--are
present, usually in combination with each other.The microscope
reveals, besides undigested and partly-digested food, crystals of fatty
acids, sarcinae ventriculi, fungus-spores, and various forms of
bacteria, particularly rod-shaped ones.The connection between sarcinae
and fermentative processes is not understood.There is no evidence that
sarcinae are capable of causing fermentation.Of greater importance is
the recognition by the microscope of the spores of the yeast-fungus
(Torula cerevisiae).These spores are rarely absent, and their constant
presence is evidence that fermentation is in progress.Fermentation
often exists in undilated stomachs, but, as has already been mentioned,
it is an important factor in the production of dilatation, so that its
early recognition, if followed by proper treatment (washing out the
stomach especially), may ward off the development of dilatation.The
article on GASTRIC CANCER is to be consulted with reference to the
habitual absence of free hydrochloric acid from the stomach in cases of
cancerous dilatation.If cancer or ulcer of the stomach exists, blood
is frequently present in the vomit, but even in the absence of ulcer or
cancer or other demonstrable source of hemorrhage the vomit in cases of
dilatation of the stomach may exceptionally contain blood, even for a
considerable length of time.If the dilatation be due to pyloric
stenosis, bile is not often found in the vomited material.It has already been mentioned that vomiting is not a constant symptom
of dilatation of the stomach.It remains to add that vomiting may be
present without any of the distinctive features which have been
described.Gastric dilatation, especially in its early stages, is often
accompanied by attacks of acute indigestion (embarras gastrique) after
some indiscretion in diet.Constipation is an almost constant symptom of dilatation of the
stomach.This is naturally to be expected when so little substance
passes from the stomach into the intestine.The constipation is also to
be explained in part by the absence of the usual reflex stimulus which
the stomach during digestion normally exerts upon intestinal
peristalsis, for the constipation is usually much relieved when the
overweighted stomach is systematically washed out.{595} Occasionally, attacks of diarrhoea occur in cases of dilatation
of the stomach.The diarrhoea may perhaps be explained by the sudden
discharge of a large quantity of fermenting material from the stomach
into the intestine.With marked dilatation of the stomach, especially when there is profuse
vomiting, the urine is often considerably diminished in quantity.Particularly in cases treated by systematic washing out of the stomach,
but also in other cases, especially with abundant vomiting, the acidity
of the urine is often much reduced.The reaction may be even
continuously alkaline (Quincke).Crystals of phosphate of magnesium
have been occasionally found in the alkaline urine of gastrectasia
(Ebstein).The urine is prone to deposit abundant sediments.It often
contains an excess of indican.The patient may suffer from attacks of dyspnoea and of palpitation of
the heart in consequence of flatulent distension of the stomach.The general condition of the patient will of course depend chiefly upon
the character of the primary disease and upon the severity of the
gastric symptoms.A moderate degree of dilatation may exist without
much disturbance of the general health of the patient.But as the
disease progresses and the food stagnates more and more in the stomach,
finally to be rejected by vomiting, the patient cannot fail to lose
flesh and strength.In extreme cases of gastrectasia, even without
organic obstruction, the patient may be reduced to a degree of
emaciation and of cachexia indistinguishable from that of cancer.As in
so many other gastric diseases, the patient is usually mentally
depressed and hypochondriacal.He suffers much
from headache and vertigo.He feels incapable of physical or mental
exertion.The skin is dry and harsh; the extremities are cold.Toward
the last, cachectic oedema about the ankles can often be recognized.Kussmaul was the first to call attention to the occurrence of tetanic
spasms in cases of dilatation of the stomach.[14] This symptom has been
observed almost exclusively in an advanced stage of the disease when
the patient has become anaemic and weak.The spasms come on chiefly
after attacks of profuse vomiting or after evacuating large quantities
by the stomach-tube.The spasms may be preceded by a sense of pain or
distress in the region of the stomach, by dyspnoea, by numbness of the
extremities, or by great prostration.The tetanic spasms affect
especially the flexor muscles of the hand and forearm, the muscles of
the calves of the legs, and the abdominal muscles.The spasm may be
confined to one or more of these groups of muscles, or there may be
general tetanic contraction of the muscles of the body.Sometimes
typical epileptiform convulsions with loss of consciousness occur.With
general tetanic spasms the pupils are usually contracted, and often
irresponsive to light.Sometimes there is abnormal sensitiveness upon
pressure over the contracted muscles.The spasms may last for only a
few minutes, or they may continue for several hours, or even for days.After their disappearance the patient is left extremely prostrated.Although tetanic spasms increase the gravity of the prognosis, they are
not necessarily fatal.[Footnote 14: _Deutsches Arch.Kussmaul considers that these spasms are analogous to those occurring
in cholera, and are referable to abnormal dryness of the tissues in
consequence of the extraction of fluid.This view is supported by the
usual {596} occurrence of the spasms after profuse vomiting or after
washing out the stomach.Another explanation, which is perhaps more
applicable to the epileptiform attacks, refers the convulsions to
auto-infection by toxic substances produced in the stomach by abnormal
fermentative and putrefactive changes (Bouchard).[15]

[Footnote 15: Laprevotte, _Des Accidents tetaniformes dans la
Dilatation de l'Estomac_, These, Paris, 1884, p.Coma, with or without the peculiar dyspnoea of diabetic coma, is a rare
occurrence in gastrectasia.(For a description of this form of coma see
page 205.)The temperature in gastric dilatation is generally unaffected.Penzoldt, however, saw two cases with moderate rise of temperature in
the evening, which could not be explained by any complication.On the
other hand, abnormally low temperature with slow pulse has been
observed (Wagner).Essential to the diagnosis of gastric dilatation is the physical
examination of the stomach.If the stomach be markedly dilated, inspection may reveal an abnormal
prominence of the abdominal walls in the epigastric region and
extending a variable distance below the level of the umbilicus.This
prominence is most marked on the left side.When the abdominal walls
are sufficiently thin and relaxed, sometimes the outline of the greater
curvature between the umbilicus and pubes, less frequently that of the
lesser curvature, can be made out.Sometimes the peristaltic waves of
the stomach can be perceived through the thin abdominal walls.By
pressure or by passing the hand across the abdomen gastric peristalsis
may sometimes be excited.The peristaltic movements of the stomach,
however, are rarely perceived except when the dilatation is due to
stenosis and the muscular coat of the stomach is hypertrophied.The
peristaltic waves generally pass from left to right, rarely in the
opposite direction as well.Careful attention to the situation,
direction, and extent of these waves is necessary to distinguish them
from similar peristaltic movements of the intestine.[16] The diminution
in size of the abdominal prominence caused by a dilated stomach after
profuse vomiting or after washing out the stomach may aid in the
diagnosis.[Footnote 16: Kussmaul says that vigorous peristaltic movements of the
stomach may be perceptible through the abdominal walls even when there
is no dilatation of the stomach.Under these circumstances he
attributes the peristaltic commotion to an independent neurosis of the
stomach ("Die Peristaltische Unruhe des Magens," _Volkmann's Samml.An important aid in bringing out the contours of the stomach is the
artificial distension of the organ by the generation within it of
carbonic acid gas, as first suggested by Frerichs.For this purpose
20-30 grains of bicarbonate of sodium and 15-20 grains of tartaric
acid, each dissolved in a little lukewarm water, may be given one after
the other.If the stomach be much dilated and relaxed, it may be
necessary to give much larger quantities of the powders (up to 2-2-1/2
drachms of the soda and a corresponding quantity of the acid).It is
well to have a stomach-tube at hand in order to withdraw the gas in
case unpleasant symptoms develop.Sometimes the stomach fails to become
distended by this procedure.This is due in some cases to the escape of
the gas through the pyloric orifice into the intestine--a condition
designated by Ebstein as incontinence of the pylorus.It may be that
sometimes the gas produces such firm {597} contraction of the gastric
walls that the stomach does not expand by the pressure of the gas.Instead of generating gas, a similar result may be produced by simply
injecting air into the stomach through a stomach-tube, as recommended
by Oser and by Runeberg.The air may, however, escape along the side of
the tube.Palpation of the distended stomach yields an elastic resistance which
has been compared to that of an air-cushion.By palpating carefully
from above downward the greater curvature can sometimes be appreciated,
but in general it is difficult to distinguish it from the transverse
colon.Peristaltic movements may perhaps be appreciated by palpation
when they are not evident on inspection.If a dilated stomach contains
considerable fluid and the abdominal walls are yielding, fluctuation
may be perceived by palpation.The lowest level at which this
fluctuation can be felt may afford a clue as to the position of the
lower border of the stomach, but not much dependence can be placed upon
this sense of fluctuation unless many sources of error in its
interpretation are excluded.By pressing gently and repeatedly against the abdominal walls a
splashing sound can usually be heard in cases of well-marked dilatation
of the stomach (bruit de clapotement).This sound can best be brought
out when the patient is in the recumbent position, with relaxed
abdominal walls, by palpating near the left border of the ribs.The
same sound can be produced by shaking the patient (bruit de glou-glou).This sound may be heard at a considerable distance from the patient, to
whom it may be a source of much annoyance.In itself this splashing
sound is without diagnostic significance, as the condition for its
production--namely, the simultaneous presence of gas and liquid in the
stomach--exists often in healthy persons.By paying attention, however,
to the time at which this sound can be produced after eating or
drinking, and to its greater or less constancy, some diagnostic
importance can be attached to this sign.If the splashing sound can be
usually produced two hours or longer after the ingestion of liquid or
six hours after an ordinary meal, it generally indicates that
dilatation of the stomach exists.[17] It is necessary to exclude
somewhat similar sounds which may be produced in the intestines,
particularly in the transverse colon and caecum.The series of gurgling
sounds which may sometimes be produced in the intestine by palpation
are not likely to be confounded with the single splashing sound
produced in the stomach, but under certain circumstances a splashing
sound may be produced in the transverse colon which cannot be
distinguished from the gastric sound.If a dilated stomach contains a
very large quantity of fluid, the splashing sound cannot readily be
produced.[Footnote 17: Baradat, _Etude sur le Bruit de Clapotement stomacal_,
These, Paris, 1884.Baradat says that this bruit is also diagnostic of
dilatation when it can be produced by palpating below a horizontal line
passing through the junction of the ninth and tenth ribs, but it is
evident that motion might be transmitted to the stomach even when its
greater curvature is above this line by palpating below the level of
the umbilicus.]Leube has pointed out that the end of the stomach-tube (of course the
hard tube), after it has been inserted into the stomach, can often be
felt through the abdominal walls.[18] He says that if the tube can be
felt below a horizontal line passing through the anterior superior
spinous processes of the ileum, dilatation of the stomach may be
positively diagnosed, {598} and the existence of dilatation is probable
if the tube can be felt much below the umbilicus.No force should be
used in trying to make the end of the tube palpable.Of course if the
abdominal walls are thick or very tense the tube cannot be felt.Leube's method is simple and convenient, and applicable to many cases.As will be explained hereafter, a position of the lower border of the
stomach even quite as low as Leube's rule demands cannot be considered
by itself positive evidence of dilatation.[19]

[Footnote 18: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 19: According to Oser, there is a possible source of error in
Leube's method--namely, that the sound may slide along the greater
curvature of the stomach, and even reach the pylorus, so that the end
may be felt higher than the lowest point of the stomach.Considerable
objection has been made to Leube's method on the ground of its danger,
but this objection is based on the assumption that greater energy is
employed in pressing forward the sound than Leube recommends (Oser,
article "Magenerweiterung" in _Eulenburg's Real Encyclopadie_, Bd.The length to which the stomach-tube can be inserted before meeting
resistance may evidently give some idea as to the size of the stomach.The attempt, however, to establish any general law with reference to
this point has not proven successful.In many cases valuable information as to the size of the stomach is
afforded by percussion.Over the greater part of the stomach the
percussion note is tympanitic, sometimes with a metallic quality.Over
the most dependent part of the stomach a dull sound is produced on
percussion in case a sufficient quantity of fluid or solid material is
contained in the viscus.In the upright position, therefore, in
percussing over the stomach from above downward, the tympanitic note
gives place to a dull sound, and this zone of dulness will change with
the position of the patient, so that in the recumbent posture the
dulness may entirely disappear.In order to prove that the region of
dulness belongs to the stomach, Piorry caused the patient to drink a
large quantity of water (a pint to a quart).In a healthy empty stomach
this quantity of water suffices to produce a zone of dulness which does
not descend below the level of the umbilicus.If, however, the dulness
be produced below the level of the umbilicus, it is inferred that
dilatation exists.Penzoldt's modification of Piorry's method gives
more certain results.[20] By withdrawing the fluid from the stomach by
the stomach-tube the dulness may be made to disappear, and by injecting
more fluid the dulness may be made to reappear at will.By noting the
lower limit of the dulness thus produced the position of the lower
border of the stomach may be determined.The farther this lies below
the umbilicus the greater, presumptively, is the degree of dilatation.The artificial distension of the stomach with gas may also aid in
determining its limits by percussion.It must be said that in general
the separation of the lower limits of the stomach from the transverse
colon by means of percussion is a matter of great difficulty, and
sometimes is impossible.[Footnote 20: Penzoldt, _op.Upon auscultation over a dilated stomach sometimes a fine crackling or
sizzling sound, like that audible upon first uncorking a bottle of
soda-water, can be heard.[21] This is referable to the fermentation
which is in progress in the stomach.Eichhorst says that a similar but
finer crackling sound can be heard over a stomach in which carbonic
acid gas is {599} being artificially generated, and that this sound
abruptly ceases when the ear passes below the limits of the greater
curvature.[22]

[Footnote 21: Pauli was the first to record this phenomenon (_De
Ventriculi Dilatatione_, Frankfurt, 1839).]The displacement of neighboring organs by a dilated stomach does not
generally give rise to important physical signs.As the tendency of a
dilated stomach is to sink down in the abdomen, there is not usually
much displacement of the thoracic viscera.If, however, the fundus of
the stomach be distended with gas, the heart may be pushed upward, and,
being pressed against the chest-wall, its apex-beat may be more
forcible and diffused than normal.The tympanitic stomach may impart a
metallic quality to the cardiac sounds.MORBID ANATOMY.--Considerable degrees of dilatation of the stomach are
easily recognized by post-mortem examination.In extreme cases the
stomach occupies all of the anterior region of the abdomen, covering
over the intestines and extending down to the pubes or even into the
true pelvis.Many cases are recorded in which the stomach was capable
of holding six to twelve pints.Godon[23] describes under the name
ventriculi hydrops a hardly credible case in which it is said that the
stomach contained ninety pounds of fluid!In the ordinary cases of
gastrectasia the lower border of the stomach is found somewhere between
the umbilicus and the pubes, frequently about a hand's breadth below
the level of the umbilicus.de Hydrops Ventriculi_, London, 1646.This
celebrated case is described with much detail.For three years the
abdomen was enormously distended, but the patient, a woman, never
vomited.The affection was supposed to be dropsy of the peritoneum.Death occurred in a condition of extreme marasmus.The pylorus was the
seat of a hydatid cyst which extended into the duodenum.The stomach,
which was enormously distended, contained ninety pounds of fluid, in
which floated a great number of hydatid cysts, some of which were
ruptured.The anterior wall of the stomach was adherent to the parietal
peritoneum.The two orifices of the stomach were drawn close to each
other.The length of the stomach equalled a Paris ell.]The fundus, being the most dilatable part of the stomach, is in most
cases disproportionately dilated in comparison with the pyloric region.This excessive dilatation of the fundus is most noticeable in
gastrectasia due to stenosis.In most cases of dilatation the pylorus
sinks down somewhat in the abdomen, but in consequence of the
distension of the lower segment of the stomach the long axis of the
organ is more nearly transverse than normal.If the pylorus be fixed,
the lesser curvature may be drawn down in its middle so as to acquire a
hooked shape.The lesser curvature, which should be covered by the
liver, may be found considerably below its normal level.The dilated
fundus may extend from the left hypochondrium into the left iliac
region.[24]
