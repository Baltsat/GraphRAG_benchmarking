Cursed be
those who seek to destroy the System!'As the absurdity of the thing forced itself upon him, Owen, in spite of
the unhappiness he felt at the sight of all the misery by which he was
surrounded, laughed aloud and said to himself that if he was sane, then
all these people must be mad.In the face of such colossal imbecility it was absurd to hope for any
immediate improvement.The little already accomplished was the work of
a few self-sacrificing enthusiasts, battling against the opposition of
those they sought to benefit, and the results of their labours were, in
many instances, as pearls cast before the swine who stood watching for
opportunities to fall upon and rend their benefactors.It was possible that the monopolists,
encouraged by the extraordinary stupidity and apathy of the people
would proceed to lay upon them even greater burdens, until at last,
goaded by suffering, and not having sufficient intelligence to
understand any other remedy, these miserable wretches would turn upon
their oppressors and drown both them and their System in a sea of blood.Besides the work at the Kiosk, towards the end of March things
gradually began to improve in other directions.Several firms began to
take on a few hands.Several large empty houses that were relet had to
be renovated for their new tenants, and there was a fair amount of
inside work arising out of the annual spring-cleaning in other houses.There was not enough work to keep everyone employed, and most of those
who were taken on as a rule only managed to make a few hours a week,
but still it was better than absolute idleness, and there also began to
be talk of several large outside jobs that were to be done as soon as
the weather was settled.This bad weather, by the way, was a sort of boon to the defenders of
the present system, who were hard-up for sensible arguments to explain
the cause of poverty.One of the principal causes was, of course, the
weather, which was keeping everything back.There was not the
slightest doubt that if only the weather would allow there would always
be plenty of work, and poverty would be abolished.had a fair share of what work there was, and Crass,
Sawkins, Slyme and Owen were kept employed pretty regularly, although
they did not start until half past eight and left off at four.At
different houses in various parts of the town they had ceilings to wash
off and distemper, to strip the old paper from the walls, and to
repaint and paper the rooms, and sometimes there were the venetian
blinds to repair and repaint.Occasionally a few extra hands were
taken on for a few days, and discharged again as soon as the job they
were taken on to do was finished.The defenders of the existing system may possibly believe that the
knowledge that they would be discharged directly the job was done was a
very good incentive to industry, that they would naturally under these
circumstances do their best to get the work done as quickly as
possible.But then it must be remembered that most of the defenders of
the existing system are so constituted, that they can believe anything
provided it is not true and sufficiently silly.All the same, it was a fact that the workmen did do their very best to
get over this work in the shortest possible time, because although they
knew that to do so was contrary to their own interests, they also knew
that it would be very much more contrary to their interests not to do
so.Their only chance of being kept on if other work came in was to
tear into it for all they were worth.Consequently, most of the work
was rushed and botched and slobbered over in about half the time that
it would have taken to do it properly.Rooms for which the customers
paid to have three coats of paint were scamped with one or two.What
Misery did not know about scamping and faking the work, the men
suggested to and showed him in the hope of currying favour with him in
order that they might get the preference over others and be sent for
when the next job came in.This is the principal incentive provided by
the present system, the incentive to cheat.These fellows cheated the
customers of their money.They cheated themselves and their fellow
workmen of work, and their children of bread, but it was all for a good
cause--to make profit for their master.Harlow and Slyme did one job--a room that Rushton & Co.It was finished with two and the men cleared
away their paints.The next day, when Slyme went there to paper the
room, the lady of the house said that the painting was not yet
finished--it was to have another coat.Slyme assured her that it had
already had three, but, as the lady insisted, Slyme went to the shop
and sought out Misery.Harlow had been stood off, as there was not
another job in just then, but fortunately he happened to be standing in
the street outside the shop, so they called him and then the three of
them went round to the job and swore that the room had had three coats.She had watched the progress of
the work.Besides, it was impossible; they had only been there three
days.The first day they had not put any paint on at all; they had
done the ceiling and stripped the walls; the painting was not started
till the second day.Misery
explained the mystery: he said that for first coating they had an extra
special very fast-drying paint--paint that dried so quickly that they
were able to give the work two coats in one day.For instance, one man
did the window, the other the door: when these were finished both men
did the skirting; by the time the skirting was finished the door and
window were dry enough to second coat; and then, on the following
day--the finishing coat!Of course, this extra special quick-drying paint was very expensive,
but the firm did not mind that.They knew that most of their customers
wished to have their work finished as quickly as possible, and their
study was to give satisfaction to the customers.This explanation
satisfied the lady--a poverty-stricken widow making a precarious living
by taking in lodgers--who was the more easily deceived because she
regarded Misery as a very holy man, having seen him preaching in the
street on many occasions.There was another job at another boarding-house that Owen and Easton
did--two rooms which had to be painted three coats of white paint and
one of enamel, making four coats altogether.That was what the firm
had contracted to do.As the old paint in these rooms was of a rather
dark shade it was absolutely necessary to give the work three coats
before enamelling it.Misery wanted them to let it go with two, but
Owen pointed out that if they did so it would be such a ghastly mess
that it would never pass.After thinking the matter over for a few
minutes, Misery told them to go on with the third coat of paint.Then
he went downstairs and asked to see the lady of the house.He
explained to her that, in consequence of the old paint being so dark,
he found that it would be necessary, in order to make a good job of it,
to give the work four coats before enamelling it.Of course, they had
agreed for only three, but as they always made a point of doing their
work in a first-class manner rather than not make a good job, they
would give it the extra coat for nothing, but he was sure she would not
wish them to do that.The lady said that she did not want them to work
for nothing, and she wanted it done properly.If it were necessary to
give it an extra coat, they must do so and she would pay for it.The lady was satisfied, and Misery
was in the seventh heaven.Then he went upstairs again and warned Owen
and Easton to be sure to say, if they were asked, that the work had had
four coats.It would not be reasonable to blame Misery or Rushton for not wishing
to do good, honest work--there was no incentive.When they secured a
contract, if they had thought first of making the very best possible
job of it, they would not have made so much profit.The incentive was
not to do the work as well as possible, but to do as little as
possible.The incentive was not to make good work, but to make good
profit.They could not justly be blamed
for not doing good work--there was no incentive.To do good work
requires time and pains.Most of them would have liked to take time
and pains, because all those who are capable of doing good work find
pleasure and happiness in doing it, and have pride in it when done: but
there was no incentive, unless the certainty of getting the sack could
be called an incentive, for it was a moral certainty that any man who
was caught taking time and pains with his work would be promptly
presented with the order of the boot.But there was plenty of
incentive to hurry and scamp and slobber and botch.There was another job at a lodging-house--two rooms to be painted and
papered.The landlord paid for the work, but the tenant had the
privilege of choosing the paper.She could have any pattern she liked
so long as the cost did not exceed one shilling per roll, Rushton's
estimate being for paper of that price.Misery sent her several
patterns of sixpenny papers, marked at a shilling, to choose from, but
she did not fancy any of them, and said that she would come to the shop
to make her selection.So Hunter tore round to the shop in a great
hurry to get there before her.In his haste to dismount, he fell off
his bicycle into the muddy road, and nearly smashed the plate-glass
window with the handle-bar of the machine as he placed it against the
shop front before going in.Without waiting to clean the mud off his clothes, he ordered Budd, the
pimply-faced shopman, to get out rolls of all the sixpenny papers they
had, and then they both set to work and altered the price marked upon
them from sixpence to a shilling.Then they got out a number of
shilling papers and altered the price marked upon them, changing it
from a shilling to one and six.When the unfortunate woman arrived, Misery was waiting for her with a
benign smile upon his long visage.He showed her all the sixpenny
ones, but she did not like any of them, so after a while Nimrod
suggested that perhaps she would like a paper of a little better
quality, and she could pay the trifling difference out of her own
pocket.Then he showed her the shilling papers that he had marked up
to one and sixpence, and eventually the lady selected one of these and
paid the extra sixpence per roll herself, as Nimrod suggested.There
were fifteen rolls of paper altogether--seven for one room and eight
for the other--so that in addition to the ordinary profit on the sale
of the paper--about two hundred and seventy-five per cent.--the firm
made seven and sixpence on this transaction.They might have done
better out of the job itself if Slyme had not been hanging the paper
piece-work, for, the two rooms being of the same pattern, he could
easily have managed to do them with fourteen rolls; in fact, that was
all he did use, but he cut up and partly destroyed the one that was
over so that he could charge for hanging it.Owen was working there at the same time, for the painting of the rooms
was not done before Slyme papered them; the finishing coat was put on
after the paper was hung.He noticed Slyme destroying the paper and,
guessing the reason, asked him how he could reconcile such conduct as
that with his profession of religion.Slyme replied that the fact that he was a Christian did not imply that
he never did anything wrong: if he committed a sin, he was a Christian
all the same, and it would be forgiven him for the sake of the Blood.As for this affair of the paper, it was a matter between himself and
God, and Owen had no right to set himself up as a Judge.In addition to all this work, there were a number of funerals.Crass
and Slyme did very well out of it all, working all day white-washing or
painting, and sometimes part of the night painting venetian blinds or
polishing coffins and taking them home, to say nothing of the lifting
in of the corpses and afterwards acting as bearers.As time went on, the number of small jobs increased, and as the days
grew longer the men were allowed to put in a greater number of hours.Most of the firms had some work, but there was never enough to keep all
the men in the town employed at the same time.It worked like this:
Every firm had a certain number of men who were regarded as the regular
hands.When there was any work to do, they got the preference over
strangers or outsiders.When things were busy, outsiders were taken on
temporarily.When the work fell off, these casual hands were the first
to be'stood still'.If it continued to fall off, the old hands were
also stood still in order of seniority, the older hands being preferred
to strangers--so long, of course, as they were not old in the sense of
being aged or inefficient.This kind of thing usually continued all through the spring and summer.In good years the men of all trades, carpenters, bricklayers,
plasterers, painters and so on, were able to keep almost regularly at
work, except in wet weather.The difference between a good and bad spring and summer is that in good
years it is sometimes possible to make a little overtime, and the
periods of unemployment are shorter and less frequent than in bad
years.It is rare even in good years for one of the casual hands to be
employed by one firm for more than one, two or three months without a
break.It is usual for them to put in a month with one firm, then a
fortnight with another, then perhaps six weeks somewhere else, and
often between there are two or three days or even weeks of enforced
idleness.This sort of thing goes on all through spring, summer and
autumn.The Beano Meeting


By the beginning of April, Rushton & Co.were again working nine hours
a day, from seven in the morning till five-thirty at night, and after
Easter they started working full time from 6 A.M.till 5.30 P.M.,
eleven and a half hours--or, rather, ten hours, for they had to lose
half an hour at breakfast and an hour at dinner.Just before Easter several of the men asked Hunter if they might be
allowed to work on Good Friday and Easter Monday, as, they said, they
had had enough holidays during the winter; they had no money to spare
for holiday-making, and they did not wish to lose two days' pay when
there was work to be done.Hunter told them that there was not
sufficient work in to justify him in doing as they requested: things
were getting very slack again, and Mr Rushton had decided to cease work
from Thursday night till Tuesday morning.They were thus prevented
from working on Good Friday, but it is true that not more than one
working man in fifty went to any religious service on that day or on
any other day during the Easter festival.On the contrary, this
festival was the occasion of much cursing and blaspheming on the part
of those whose penniless, poverty-stricken condition it helped to
aggravate by enforcing unprofitable idleness which they lacked the
means to enjoy.During these holidays some of the men did little jobs on their own
account and others put in the whole time--including Good Friday and
Easter Sunday--gardening, digging and planting their plots of allotment
ground.When Owen arrived home one evening during the week before Easter,
Frankie gave him an envelope which he had brought home from school.It
contained a printed leaflet:

                   CHURCH OF THE WHITED SEPULCHRE,
                             MUGSBOROUGH

                             Easter 19--

Dear Sir (or Madam),

In accordance with the usual custom we invite you to join with us in
presenting the Vicar, the Rev.Habbakuk Bosher, with an Easter
Offering, as a token of affection and regard.Yours faithfully,
                          A. Cheeseman }
                          W. Taylor    }  Churchwardens

Mr Bosher's income from various sources connected with the church was
over six hundred pounds a year, or about twelve pounds per week, but as
that sum was evidently insufficient, his admirers had adopted this
device for supplementing it.Frankie said all the boys had one of
these letters and were going to ask their fathers for some money to
give towards the Easter offering.Most of them expected to get
twopence.As the boy had evidently set his heart on doing the same as the other
children, Owen gave him the twopence, and they afterwards learned that
the Easter Offering for that year was one hundred and twenty-seven
pounds, which was made up of the amounts collected from the
parishioners by the children, the district visitors and the verger, the
collection at a special Service, and donations from the feeble-minded
old females elsewhere referred to.By the end of April nearly all the old hands were back at work, and
several casual hands had also been taken on, the Semi-drunk being one
of the number.In addition to these, Misery had taken on a number of
what he called 'lightweights', men who were not really skilled workmen,
but had picked up sufficient knowledge of the simpler parts of the
trade to be able to get over it passably.These were paid fivepence or
fivepence-halfpenny, and were employed in preference to those who had
served their time, because the latter wanted more money and therefore
were only employed when absolutely necessary.Besides the lightweights
there were a few young fellows called improvers, who were also employed
because they were cheap.Crass now acted as colourman, having been appointed possibly because he
knew absolutely nothing about the laws of colour.As most of the work
consisted of small jobs, all the paint and distemper was mixed up at
the shop and sent out ready for use to the various jobs.Sawkins or some of the other lightweights generally carried the heavier
lots of colour or scaffolding, but the smaller lots of colour or such
things as a pair of steps or a painter's plank were usually sent by the
boy, whose slender legs had become quite bowed since he had been
engaged helping the other philanthropists to make money for Mr Rushton.Crass's work as colourman was simplified, to a certain extent, by the
great number of specially prepared paints and distempers in all
colours, supplied by the manufacturers ready for use.Most of these
new-fangled concoctions were regarded with an eye of suspicion and
dislike by the hands, and Philpot voiced the general opinion about them
one day during a dinner-hour discussion when he said they might appear
to be all right for a time, but they would probably not last, because
they was mostly made of kimicles.One of these new-fashioned paints was called 'Petrifying Liquid', and
was used for first-coating decaying stone or plaster work.It was also
supposed to be used for thinning up a certain kind of patent distemper,
but when Misery found out that it was possible to thin the latter with
water, the use of 'Petrifying Liquid' for that purpose was
discontinued.This 'Petrifying Liquid' was a source of much merriment
to the hands.The name was applied to the tea that they made in
buckets on some of the jobs, and also to the four-ale that was supplied
by certain pubs.One of the new inventions was regarded with a certain amount of
indignation by the hands: it was a white enamel, and they objected to
it for two reasons--one was because, as Philpot remarked, it dried so
quickly that you had to work like greased lightning; you had to be all
over the door directly you started it.The other reason was that, because it dried so quickly, it was
necessary to keep closed the doors and windows of the room where it was
being used, and the smell was so awful that it brought on fits of
dizziness and sometimes vomiting.Needless to say, the fact that it
compelled those who used it to work quickly recommended the stuff to
Misery.As for the smell, he did not care about that; he did not have to inhale
the fumes himself.It was just about this time that Crass, after due consultation with
several of the others, including Philpot, Harlow, Bundy, Slyme, Easton
and the Semi-drunk, decided to call a meeting of the hands for the
purpose of considering the advisability of holding the usual Beano
later on in the summer.The meeting was held in the carpenter's shop
down at the yard one evening at six o'clock, which allowed time for
those interested to attend after leaving work.The hands sat on the benches or carpenter's stools, or reclined upon
heaps of shavings.On a pair of tressels in the centre of the workshop
stood a large oak coffin which Crass had just finished polishing.When all those who were expected to turn up had arrived, Payne, the
foreman carpenter--the man who made the coffins--was voted to the chair
on the proposition of Crass, seconded by Philpot, and then a solemn
silence ensued, which was broken at last by the chairman, who, in a
lengthy speech, explained the object of the meeting.Possibly with a
laudable desire that there should be no mistake about it, he took the
trouble to explain several times, going over the same ground and
repeating the same words over and over again, whilst the audience
waited in a deathlike and miserable silence for him to leave off.Payne, however, did not appear to have any intention of leaving off,
for he continued, like a man in a trance, to repeat what he had said
before, seeming to be under the impression that he had to make a
separate explanation to each individual member of the audience.At
last the crowd could stand it no longer, and began to shout 'Hear,
hear' and to bang bits of wood and hammers on the floor and the
benches; and then, after a final repetition of the statement, that the
object of the meeting was to consider the advisability of holding an
outing, or beanfeast, the chairman collapsed on to a carpenter's stool
and wiped the sweat from his forehead.Crass then reminded the meeting that the last year's Beano had been an
unqualified success, and for his part he would be very sorry if they
did not have one this year.Last year they had four brakes, and they
went to Tubberton Village.It was true that there was nothing much to see at Tubberton, but there
was one thing they could rely on getting there that they could not be
sure of getting for the same money anywhere else, and that was--a good
feed.Just for the sake of getting on with the business,
he would propose that they decide to go to Tubberton, and that a
committee be appointed to make arrangements--about the dinner--with the
landlord of the Queen Elizabeth's Head at that place.Philpot seconded the motion, and Payne was about to call for a show of
hands when Harlow rose to a point of order.It appeared to him that
they were getting on a bit too fast.The proper way to do this
business was first to take the feeling of the meeting as to whether
they wished to have a Beano at all, and then, if the meeting was in
favour of it, they could decide where they were to go, and whether they
would have a whole day or only half a day.The Semi-drunk said that he didn't care a dreadful expression where
they went: he was willing to abide by the decision of the majority.It was a matter of indifference to him whether they had a
day, or half a day, or two days; he was agreeable to anything.Easton suggested that a special saloon carriage might be engaged, and
they could go and visit Madame Tussaud's Waxworks.He had never been
to that place and had often wished to see it.But Philpot objected
that if they went there, Madame Tussaud's might be unwilling to let
them out again.Bundy endorsed the remarks that had fallen from Crass with reference to
Tubberton.He did not care where they went, they would never get such
a good spread for the money as they did last year at the Queen
Elizabeth.The chairman said that he remembered the last Beano very well.They
had half a day--left off work on Saturday at twelve instead of one--so
there was only one hour's wages lost--they went home, had a wash and
changed their clothes, and got up to the Cricketers, where the brakes
was waiting, at one.Then they had the two hours' drive to Tubberton,
stopping on the way for drinks at the Blue Lion, the Warrior's Head,
the Bird in Hand, the Dewdrop Inn and the World Turned Upside Down.They arrived at the Queen Elizabeth at three-thirty, and
the dinner was ready; and it was one of the finest blow-outs he had
ever had.There was soup, vegetables, roast beef, roast
mutton, lamb and mint sauce, plum duff, Yorkshire, and a lot more.The
landlord of the Elizabeth kept as good a drop of beer as anyone could
wish to drink, and as for the teetotallers, they could have tea, coffee
or ginger beer.Having thus made another start, Payne found it very difficult to leave
off, and was proceeding to relate further details of the last Beano
when Harlow again rose up from his heap of shavings and said he wished
to call the chairman to order.What the hell was the
use of all this discussion before they had even decided to have a Beano
at all!Was the meeting in favour of a Beano or not?Everyone was very
uncomfortable, looking stolidly on the ground or staring straight in
front of them.At last Easton broke the silence by suggesting that it would not be a
bad plan if someone was to make a motion that a Beano be held.This
was greeted with a general murmur of 'Hear, hear,' followed by another
awkward pause, and then the chairman asked Easton if he would move a
resolution to that effect.After some hesitation, Easton agreed, and
formally moved: 'That this meeting is in favour of a Beano.'The Semi-drunk said that, in order to get on with the business, he
would second the resolution.But meantime, several arguments had
broken out between the advocates of different places, and several men
began to relate anecdotes of previous Beanos.Nearly everyone was
speaking at once and it was some time before the chairman was able to
put the resolution.Finding it impossible to make his voice heard
above the uproar, he began to hammer on the bench with a wooden mallet,
and to shout requests for order, but this only served to increase the
din.Some of them looked at him curiously and wondered what was the
matter with him, but the majority were so interested in their own
arguments that they did not notice him at all.Whilst the chairman was trying to get the attention of the meeting in
order to put the question, Bundy had become involved in an argument
with several of the new hands who claimed to know of an even better
place than the Queen Elizabeth, a pub called 'The New Found Out', at
Mirkfield, a few miles further on than Tubberton, and another
individual joined in the dispute, alleging that a house called 'The
Three Loggerheads' at Slushton-cum-Dryditch was the finest place for a
Beano within a hundred miles of Mugsborough.He went there last year
with Pushem and Driver's crowd, and they had roast beef, goose, jam
tarts, mince pies, sardines, blancmange, calves' feet jelly and one
pint for each man was included in the cost of the dinner.In the
middle of the discussion, they noticed that most of the others were
holding up their hands, so to show there was no ill feeling they held
up theirs also and then the chairman declared it was carried
unanimously.Bundy said he would like to ask the chairman to read out the resolution
which had just been passed, as he had not caught the words.The chairman replied that there was no written resolution.The motion
was just to express the feeling of this meeting as to whether there was
to be an outing or not.Bundy said he was only asking a civil question, a point of information:
all he wanted to know was, what was the terms of the resolution?Was
they in favour of the Beano or not?The chairman responded that the meeting was unanimously in favour.Harlow said that the next thing to be done was to decide upon the date.That would give them
plenty of time to pay in.Sawkins asked whether it was proposed to have a day or only half a day.He himself was in favour of the whole day.It would only mean losing a
morning's work.It was hardly worth going at all if they only had half
the day.The Semi-drunk remarked that he had just thought of a very good place
to go if they decided to have a change.Three years ago he was working
for Dauber and Botchit and they went to 'The First In and the Last Out'
at Bashford.It was a very small place, but there was a field where
you could have a game of cricket or football, and the dinner was A1 at
Lloyds.There was also a skittle alley attached to the pub and no
charge was made for the use of it.There was a bit of a river there,
and one of the chaps got so drunk that he went orf his onion and jumped
into the water, and when they got him out the village policeman locked
him up, and the next day he was took before the beak and fined two
pounds or a month's hard labour for trying to commit suicide.Easton pointed out that there was another way to look at it: supposing
they decided to have the Beano, he supposed it would come to about six
shillings a head.If they had it at the end of August and started
paying in now, say a tanner a week, they would have plenty of time to
make up the amount, but supposing the work fell off and some of them
got the push?Crass said that in that case a man could either have his money back or
he could leave it, and continue his payments even if he were working
for some other firm; the fact that he was off from Rushton's would not
prevent him from going to the Beano.Harlow proposed that they decide to go to the Queen Elizabeth the same
as last year, and that they have half a day.Philpot said that, in order to get on with the business, he would
second the resolution.Bundy suggested--as an amendment--that it should be a whole day,
starting from the Cricketers at nine in the morning, and Sawkins said
that, in order to get on with the business, he would second the
amendment.One of the new hands said he wished to move another amendment.He
proposed to strike out the Queen Elizabeth and substitute the Three
Loggerheads.The Chairman--after a pause--inquired if there were any seconder to
this, and the Semi-drunk said that, although he did not care much where
they went, still, to get on with the business, he would second the
amendment, although for his own part he would prefer to go to the
'First In and Last Out' at Bashford.The new hand offered to withdraw his suggestion re the Three
Loggerheads in favour of the Semi-drunks proposition, but the latter
said it didn't matter; it could go as it was.As it was getting rather late, several men went home, and cries of 'Put
the question' began to be heard on all sides; the chairman accordingly
was proceeding to put Harlow's proposition when the new hand
interrupted him by pointing out that it was his duty as chairman to put
the amendments first.This produced another long discussion, in the
course of which a very tall, thin man who had a harsh, metallic voice
gave a long rambling lecture about the rules of order and the conduct
of public meetings.He spoke very slowly and deliberately, using very
long words and dealing with the subject in an exhaustive manner.A
resolution was a resolution, and an amendment was an amendment; then
there was what was called an amendment to an amendment; the procedure
of the House of Commons differed very materially from that of the House
of Lords--and so on.This man kept on talking for about ten minutes, and might have
continued for ten hours if he had not been rudely interrupted by
Harlow, who said that it seemed to him that they were likely to stay
there all night if they went on like they were going.He wanted his
tea, and he would also like to get a few hours' sleep before having to
resume work in the morning.He was getting about sick of all this
talk.In order to get on with the business, he would
withdraw his resolution if the others would withdraw their amendments.If they would agree to do this, he would then propose another
resolution which--if carried--would meet all the requirements of the
case.The man with the metallic voice observed that it was not necessary to
ask the consent of those who had moved amendments: if the original
proposition was withdrawed, all the amendments fell to the ground.'Last year,' observed Crass, 'when we was goin' out of the room after
we'd finished our dinner at the Queen Elizabeth, the landlord pointed
to the table and said, "There's enough left over for you all to 'ave
another lot."'Harlow said that he would move that it be held on the last Saturday in
August; that it be for half a day, starting at one o'clock so that they
could work up till twelve, which would mean that they would only have
to lose one hour's pay: that they go to the same place as last
year--the Queen Elizabeth.That the same committee that
acted last year--Crass and Bundy--be appointed to make all the
arrangements and collect the subscriptions.The tall man observed that this was what was called a compound
resolution, and was proceeding to explain further when the chairman
exclaimed that it did not matter a dam' what it was called--would
anyone second it?The Semi-drunk said that he would--in order to get
on with the business.Bundy moved, and Sawkins seconded, as an amendment, that it should be a
whole day.The new hand moved to substitute the Loggerheads for the Queen
Elizabeth.Easton proposed to substitute Madame Tussaud's Waxworks for the Queen
Elizabeth.He said he moved this just to test the feeling of the
meeting.Harlow pointed out that it would cost at least a pound a head to defray
the expenses of such a trip.The railway fares, tram fares in London,
meals--for it would be necessary to have a whole day--and other
incidental expenses; to say nothing of the loss of wages.It would not
be possible for any of them to save the necessary amount during the
next four months.Philpot repeated his warning as to the danger of visiting Madame
Tussaud's.He was certain that if she once got them in there she would
never let them out again.He had no desire to pass the rest of his
life as an image in a museum.One of the new hands--a man with a red tie--said that they would look
well, after having been soaked for a month or two in petrifying liquid,
chained up in the Chamber of Horrors with labels round their
necks--'Specimens of Liberal and Conservative upholders of the
Capitalist System, 20 century'.Crass protested against the introduction of politics into that meeting.The remarks of the last speakers were most uncalled-for.Easton said that he would withdraw his amendment.Acting under the directions of the man with the metallic voice, the
chairman now proceeded to put the amendment to the vote.Bundy's
proposal that it should be a whole day was defeated, only himself,
Sawkins and the Semi-drunk being in favour.The motion to substitute
the Loggerheads for the Queen Elizabeth was also defeated, and the
compound resolution proposed by Harlow was then carried nem.Philpot now proposed a hearty vote of thanks to the chairman for the
very able manner in which he had conducted the meeting.When this had
been unanimously agreed to, the Semi-drunk moved a similar tribute of
gratitude to Crass for his services to the cause and the meeting
dispersed.Chapter 42

June


During the early part of May the weather was exceptionally bad, with
bitterly cold winds.Rain fell nearly every day, covering the roads
with a slush that penetrated the rotten leather of the cheap or
second-hand boots worn by the workmen.This weather had the effect of
stopping nearly all outside work, and also caused a lot of illness, for
those who were so fortunate as to have inside jobs frequently got wet
through on their way to work in the morning and had to work all day in
damp clothing, and with their boots saturated with water.It was also
a source of trouble to those of the men who had allotments, because if
it had been fine they would have been able to do something to their
gardens while they were out of work.Newman had not succeeded in getting a job at the trade since he came
out of prison, but he tried to make a little money by hawking bananas.Philpot--when he was at work--used often to buy a tanner's or a bob's
worth from him and give them to Mrs Linden's children.On Saturdays
Old Joe used to waylay these children and buy them bags of cakes at the
bakers.One week when he knew that Mrs Linden had not had much work to
do, he devised a very cunning scheme to help her.He had been working
with Slyme, who was papering a large boarded ceiling in a shop.It had
to be covered with unbleached calico before it could be papered and
when the work was done there were a number of narrow pieces of calico
left over.These he collected and tore into strips about six inches
wide which he took round to Mrs Linden, and asked her to sew them
together, end to end, so as to make one long strip: then this long
strip had to be cut into four pieces of equal length and the edges sewn
together in such a manner that it would form a long tube.Philpot told
her that it was required for some work that Rushton's were doing, and
said he had undertaken to get the sewing done.The firm would have to
pay for it, so she could charge a good price.'You see,' he said with a wink, 'this is one of those jobs where we
gets a chance to get some of our own back.'Mary thought it was rather a strange sort of job, but she did as
Philpot directed and when he came for the stuff and asked how much it
was she said threepence: it had only taken about half an hour.Philpot
ridiculed this: it was not nearly enough.THEY were not supposed to
know how long it took: it ought to be a bob at the very least.So,
after some hesitation she made out a bill for that amount on a
half-sheet of note-paper.He brought her the money the next Saturday
afternoon and went off chuckling to himself over the success of the
scheme.It did not occur to him until the next day that he might just
as well have got her to make him an apron or two: and when he did think
of this he said that after all it didn't matter, because if he had done
that it would have been necessary to buy new calico, and anyhow, it
could be done some other time.Newman did not make his fortune out of the bananas--seldom more than
two shillings a day--and consequently he was very glad when Philpot
called at his house one evening and told him there was a chance of a
job at Rushton's.Newman accordingly went to the yard the next
morning, taking his apron and blouse and his bag of tools with him,
ready to start work.He got there at about quarter to six and was
waiting outside when Hunter arrived.The latter was secretly very glad
to see him, for there was a rush of work in and they were short of men.He did not let this appear, of course, but hesitated for a few minutes
when Newman repeated the usual formula: 'Any chance of a job, sir?''We wasn't at all satisfied with you last time you was on, you know,'
said Misery.'Still, I don't mind giving you another chance.But if
you want to hold your job you'll have to move yourself a bit quicker
than you did before.'Towards the end of the month things began to improve all round.As time went on the improvement
was maintained and nearly everyone was employed.Rushton's were so busy
that they took on several other old hands who had been sacked the
previous year for being too slow.Thanks to the influence of Crass, Easton was now regarded as one of the
regular hands.He had recently resumed the practice of spending some
of his evenings at the Cricketers.It is probable that even if it had
not been for his friendship with Crass, he would still have continued
to frequent the public house, for things were not very comfortable at
home.Somehow or other, Ruth and he seemed to be always quarrelling,
and he was satisfied that it was not always his fault.Sometimes,
after the day's work was over he would go home resolved to be good
friends with her: he would plan on his way homewards to suggest to her
that they should have their tea and then go out for a walk with the
child.Once or twice she agreed, but on each occasion, they quarrelled
before they got home again.So after a time he gave up trying to be
friends with her and went out by himself every evening as soon as he
had had his tea.Mary Linden, who was still lodging with them, could not help perceiving
their unhappiness: she frequently noticed that Ruth's eyes were red and
swollen as if with crying, and she gently sought to gain her
confidence, but without success.On one occasion when Mary was trying
to advise her, Ruth burst out into a terrible fit of weeping, but she
would not say what was the cause--except that her head was aching--she
was not well, that was all.Sometimes Easton passed the evening at the Cricketers but frequently he
went over to the allotments, where Harlow had a plot of ground.Harlow
used to get up about four o'clock in the morning and put in an hour or
so at his garden before going to work; and every evening as soon as he
had finished tea he used to go there again and work till it was dark.Sometimes he did not go home to tea at all, but went straight from work
to the garden, and his children used to bring his tea to him there in a
glass bottle, with something to eat in a little basket.He had four
children, none of whom were yet old enough to go to work, and as may be
imagined, he found it a pretty hard struggle to live.He was not a
teetotaller, but as he often remarked, 'what the publicans got from him
wouldn't make them very fat', for he often went for weeks together
without tasting the stuff, except a glass or two with the Sunday
dinner, which he did not regard as an unnecessary expense, because it
was almost as cheap as tea or coffee.Fortunately his wife was a good needlewoman, and as sober and
industrious as himself; by dint of slaving incessantly from morning
till night she managed to keep her home fairly comfortable and the
children clean and decently dressed; they always looked respectable,
although they did not always have enough proper food to eat.They
looked so respectable that none of the 'visiting ladies' ever regarded
them as deserving cases.Harlow paid fifteen shillings a year for his plot of ground, and
although it meant a lot of hard work it was also a source of pleasure
and some profit.He generally made a few shillings out of the flowers,
besides having enough potatoes and other vegetables to last them nearly
all the year.Sometimes Easton went over to the allotments and lent Harlow a hand
with this gardening work, but whether he went there or to the
Cricketers, he usually returned home about half past nine, and then
went straight to bed, often without speaking a single word to Ruth, who
for her part seldom spoke to him except to answer something he said, or
to ask some necessary question.At first, Easton used to think that it
was all because of the way he had behaved to her in the public house,
but when he apologized--as he did several times--and begged her to
forgive him and forget about it, she always said it was all right;
there was nothing to forgive.Then, after a time, he began to think it
was on account of their poverty and the loss of their home, for nearly
all their furniture had been sold during the last winter.But whenever
he talked of trying to buy some more things to make the place
comfortable again, she did not appear to take any interest: the house
was neat enough as it was: they could manage very well, she said,
indifferently.One evening, about the middle of June, when he had been over to the
allotments, Easton brought her home a bunch of flowers that Harlow had
given him--some red and white roses and some <DW29>s.When he came in,
Ruth was packing his food basket for the next day.The baby was asleep
in its cot on the floor near the window.Although it was nearly nine
o'clock the lamp had not yet been lighted and the mournful twilight
that entered the room through the open window increased the desolation
of its appearance.The fire had burnt itself out and the grate was
filled with ashes.On the hearth was an old rug made of jute that had
once been printed in bright colours which had faded away till the whole
surface had become almost uniformly drab, showing scarcely any trace of
the original pattern.The rest of the floor was bare except for two or
three small pieces of old carpet that Ruth had bought for a few pence
at different times at some inferior second-hand shop.The chairs and
the table were almost the only things that were left of the original
furniture of the room, and except for three or four plates of different
patterns and sizes and a few cups and saucers, the shelves of the
dresser were bare.The stillness of the atmosphere was disturbed only by the occasional
sound of the wheels of a passing vehicle and the strangely distinct
voices of some children who were playing in the street.'I've brought you these,' said Easton, offering her the flowers.You know I've been
helping him a little with his garden.'At first he thought she did not want to take them.She was standing at
the table with her back to the window, so that he was unable to see the
expression of her face, and she hesitated for a moment before she
faltered out some words of thanks and took the flowers, which she put
down on the table almost as soon as she touched them.Offended at what he considered her contemptuous indifference, Easton
made no further attempt at conversation but went into the scullery to
wash his hands, and then went up to bed.Downstairs, for a long time after he was gone, Ruth sat alone by the
fireless grate, in the silence and the gathering shadows, holding the
bunch of flowers in her hand, living over again the events of the last
year, and consumed with an agony of remorse.The presence of Mary Linden and the two children in the house probably
saved Ruth from being more unhappy than she was.Little Elsie had made
an arrangement with her to be allowed to take the baby out for walks,
and in return Ruth did Elsie's housework.As for Mary, she had not
much time to do anything but sew, almost the only relaxation she knew
being when she took the work home, and on Sunday, which she usually
devoted to a general clean-up of the room, and to mending the
children's clothes.Sometimes on Sunday evening she used to go with
Ruth and the children to see Mrs Owen, who, although she was not ill
enough to stay in bed, seldom went out of the house.She had never
really recovered from the attack of illness which was brought on by her
work at the boarding house.The doctor had been to see her once or
twice and had prescribed--rest.She was to lie down as much as
possible, not to do any heavy work--not to carry or lift any heavy
articles, scrub floors, make beds, or anything of that sort: and she
was to take plenty of nourishing food, beef tea, chicken, a little wine
and so on.He did not suggest a trip round the world in a steam yacht
or a visit to Switzerland--perhaps he thought they might not be able to
afford it.Sometimes she was so ill that she had to observe one at
least of the doctor's instructions--to lie down: and then she would
worry and fret because she was not able to do the housework and because
Owen had to prepare his own tea when he came home at night.On one of
these occasions it would have been necessary for Owen to stay at home
from work if it had not been for Mrs Easton, who came for several days
in succession to look after her and attend to the house.Fortunately, Owen's health was better since the weather had become
warmer.For a long time after the attack of haemorrhage he had while
writing the show-card he used to dread going to sleep at night for fear
it should recur.He had heard of people dying in their sleep from that
cause.Nora knew nothing of what
occurred that night: to have told her would have done no good, but on
the contrary would have caused her a lot of useless anxiety.Sometimes
he doubted whether it was right not to tell her, but as time went by
and his health continued to improve he was glad he had said nothing
about it.Frankie had lately resumed his athletic exercises with the flat iron:
his strength was returning since Owen had been working regularly,
because he had been having his porridge and milk again and also some
Parrish's Food which a chemist at Windley was selling large bottles of
for a shilling.He used to have what he called a 'party' two or three
times a week with Elsie, Charley and Easton's baby as the guests.Sometimes, if Mrs Owen were not well, Elsie used to stay in with her
after tea and do some housework while the boys went out to play, but
more frequently the four children used to go together to the park to
play or sail boats on the lake.Once one of the boats was becalmed
about a couple of yards from shore and while trying to reach it with a
stick Frankie fell into the water, and when Charley tried to drag him
out he fell in also.Elsie put the baby down on the bank and seized
hold of Charley and while she was trying to get him out, the baby began
rolling down, and would probably have tumbled in as well if a man who
happened to be passing by had not rushed up in time to prevent it.Fortunately the water at that place was only about two feet deep, so
the boys were not much the worse for their ducking.They returned home
wet through, smothered with mud, and feeling very important, like boys
who had distinguished themselves.After this, whenever she could manage to spare the time, Ruth Easton
used to go with the children to the park.There was a kind of
summer-house near the shore of the lake, only a few feet away from the
water's edge, surrounded and shaded by trees, whose branches arched
over the path and drooped down to the surface of the water.While the
children played Ruth used to sit in this arbour and sew, but often her
work was neglected and forgotten as she gazed pensively at the water,
which just there looked very still, and dark, and deep, for it was
sheltered from the wind and over-shadowed by the trees that lined the
banks at the end of the lake.Sometimes, if it happened to be raining, instead of going out the
children used to have some games in the house.On one such occasion
Frankie produced the flat iron and went through the exercise, and
Charley had a go as well.But although he was slightly older and
taller than Frankie he could not lift the iron so often or hold it out
so long as the other, a failure that Frankie attributed to the fact
that Charley had too much tea and bread and butter instead of porridge
and milk and Parrish's Food.Charley was so upset about his lack of
strength that he arranged with Frankie to come home with him the next
day after school to see his mother about it.Mrs Linden had a flat
iron, so they gave a demonstration of their respective powers before
her.Mrs Easton being also present, by request, because Frankie said
that the diet in question was suitable for babies as well as big
children.He had been brought up on it ever since he could remember,
and it was almost as cheap as bread and butter and tea.The result of the exhibition was that Mrs Linden promised to make
porridge for Charley and Elsie whenever she could spare the time, and
Mrs Easton said she would try it for the baby also.Chapter 43

The Good Old Summer-time


All through the summer the crowd of ragged-trousered philanthropists
continued to toil and sweat at their noble and unselfish task of making
money for Mr Rushton.Painting the outsides of houses and shops, washing off and distempering
ceilings, stripping old paper off walls, painting and papering rooms
and staircases, building new rooms or other additions to old houses or
business premises, digging up old drains, repairing leaky roofs and
broken windows.Their zeal and enthusiasm in the good cause was unbounded.They were
supposed to start work at six o'clock, but most of them were usually to
be found waiting outside the job at about a quarter to that hour,
sitting on the kerbstones or the doorstep.Their operations extended all over the town: at all hours of the day
they were to be seen either going or returning from 'jobs', carrying
ladders, planks, pots of paint, pails of whitewash, earthenware,
chimney pots, drainpipes, lengths of guttering, closet pans, grates,
bundles of wallpaper, buckets of paste, sacks of cement, and loads of
bricks and mortar.Quite a common spectacle--for gods and men--was a
procession consisting of a handcart loaded up with such materials being
pushed or dragged through the public streets by about half a dozen of
these Imperialists in broken boots and with battered, stained,
discoloured bowler hats, or caps splashed with paint and whitewash;
their stand-up collars dirty, limp and crumpled, and their rotten
second-hand misfit clothing saturated with sweat and plastered with
mortar.Even the assistants in the grocers' and drapers' shops laughed and
ridiculed and pointed the finger of scorn at them as they passed.The superior classes--those who do nothing--regarded them as a sort of
lower animals.A letter appeared in the Obscurer one week from one of
these well-dressed loafers, complaining of the annoyance caused to the
better-class visitors by workmen walking on the pavement as they passed
along the Grand Parade in the evening on their way home from work, and
suggesting that they should walk in the roadway.When they heard of
the letter a lot of the workmen adopted the suggestion and walked in
the road so as to avoid contaminating the idlers.This letter was followed by others of a somewhat similar kind, and one
or two written in a patronizing strain in defence of the working
classes by persons who evidently knew nothing about them.There was
also a letter from an individual who signed himself 'Morpheus'
complaining that he was often awakened out of his beauty sleep in the
middle of the night by the clattering noise of the workmen's boots as
they passed his house on their way to work in the morning.'Morpheus'
wrote that not only did they make a dreadful noise with their horrible
iron-clad boots, but they were in the habit of coughing and spitting a
great deal, which was very unpleasant to hear, and they conversed in
loud tones.Sometimes their conversation was not at all edifying, for
it consisted largely of bad language, which 'Morpheus' assumed to be
attributable to the fact that they were out of temper because they had
to rise so early.As a rule they worked till half-past five in the evening, and by the
time they reached home it was six o'clock.When they had taken their
evening meal and had a wash it was nearly eight: about nine most of
them went to bed so as to be able to get up about half past four the
next morning to make a cup of tea before leaving home at half past five
to go to work again.Frequently it happened that they had to leave
home earlier than this, because their 'job' was more than half an
hour's walk away.It did not matter how far away the 'job' was from
the shop, the men had to walk to and fro in their own time, for Trades
Union rules were a dead letter in Mugsborough.There were no tram
fares or train fares or walking time allowed for the likes of them.Ninety-nine out of every hundred of them did not believe in such things
as those: they had much more sense than to join Trades Unions: on the
contrary, they believed in placing themselves entirely at the mercy of
their good, kind Liberal and Tory masters.Very frequently it happened, when only a few men were working together,
that it was not convenient to make tea for breakfast or dinner, and
then some of them brought tea with them ready made in bottles and drank
it cold; but most of them went to the nearest pub and ate their food
there with a glass of beer.Even those who would rather have had tea
or coffee had beer, because if they went to a temperance restaurant or
coffee tavern it generally happened that they were not treated very
civilly unless they bought something to eat as well as to drink, and
the tea at such places was really dearer than beer, and the latter was
certainly quite as good to drink as the stewed tea or the liquid mud
that was sold as coffee at cheap 'Workmen's' Eating Houses.There were some who were--as they thought--exceptionally lucky: the
firms they worked for were busy enough to let them work two hours'
overtime every night--till half past seven--without stopping for tea.Most of these arrived home about eight, completely flattened out.Then
they had some tea and a wash and before they knew where they were it
was about half past nine.Then they went to sleep again till half past
four or five the next morning.They were usually so tired when they got home at night that they never
had any inclination for study or any kind of self-improvement, even if
they had had the time.They had plenty of time to study during the
winter: and their favourite subject then was, how to preserve
themselves from starving to death.This overtime, however, was the exception, for although in former years
it had been the almost invariable rule to work till half past seven in
summer, most of the firms now made a practice of ceasing work at
five-thirty.The revolution which had taken place in this matter was a
favourite topic of conversation amongst the men, who spoke regretfully
of the glorious past, when things were busy, and they used to work
fifteen, sixteen and even eighteen hours a day.But nowadays there
were nearly as many chaps out of work in the summer as in the winter.They used to discuss the causes of the change.One was, of course, the
fact that there was not so much building going on as formerly, and
another was the speeding up and slave-driving, and the manner in which
the work was now done, or rather scamped.As old Philpot said, he
could remember the time, when he was a nipper, when such a 'job' as
that at 'The Cave' would have lasted at least six months, and they
would have had more hands on it too!But it would have been done
properly, not messed up like that was: all the woodwork would have been
rubbed down with pumice stone and water: all the knots cut out and the
holes properly filled up, and the work properly rubbed down with
glass-paper between every coat.But nowadays the only place you'd see
a bit of pumice stone was in a glass case in a museum, with a label on
it.'Pumice Stone: formerly used by house-painters.'Most of them spoke of those bygone times with poignant regret, but
there were a few--generally fellows who had been contaminated by
contact with Socialists or whose characters had been warped and
degraded by the perusal of Socialist literature--who said that they did
not desire to work overtime at all--ten hours a day were quite enough
for them--in fact they would rather do only eight.What they wanted,
they said, was not more work, but more grub, more clothes, more
leisure, more pleasure and better homes.They wanted to be able to go
for country walks or bicycle rides, to go out fishing or to go to the
seaside and bathe and lie on the beach and so forth.But these were
only a very few; there were not many so selfish as this.The majority
desired nothing but to be allowed to work, and as for their children,
why, 'what was good enough for themselves oughter be good enough for
the kids'.They often said that such things as leisure, culture, pleasure and the
benefits of civilization were never intended for 'the likes of us'.They did not--all--actually say this, but that was what their conduct
amounted to; for they not only refused to help to bring about a better
state of things for their children, but they ridiculed and opposed and
cursed and abused those who were trying to do it for them.The foulest
words that came out of their mouths were directed against the men of
their own class in the House of Commons--the Labour Members--and
especially the Socialists, whom they spoke of as fellows who were too
bloody lazy to work for a living, and who wanted the working classes to
keep them.Some of them said that they did not believe in helping their children
to become anything better than their parents had been because in such
cases the children, when they grew up, 'looked down' upon and were
ashamed of their fathers and mothers!They seemed to think that if
they loved and did their duty to their children, the probability was
that the children would prove ungrateful: as if even if that were true,
it would be any excuse for their indifference.Another cause of the shortage of work was the intrusion into the trade
of so many outsiders: fellows like Sawkins and the other lightweights.Whatever other causes there were, there could be no doubt that the
hurrying and scamping was a very real one.Every 'job' had to be done
at once!as if it were a matter of life or death!It must be finished
by a certain time.If the 'job' was at an empty house, Misery's yarn
was that it was let!the people were coming in at the end of the week!therefore everything must be finished by Wednesday night.All the
ceilings had to be washed off, the walls stripped and repapered, and
two coats of paint inside and outside the house.New drains were to be
put in, and all broken windows and locks and broken plaster repaired.A number of men--usually about half as many as there should have
been--would be sent to do the work, and one man was put in charge of
the 'job'.These sub-foremen or 'coddies' knew that if they'made
their jobs pay' they would be put in charge of others and be kept on in
preference to other men as long as the firm had any work; so they
helped Misery to scheme and scamp the work and watched and drove the
men under their charge; and these latter poor wretches, knowing that
their only chance of retaining their employment was to 'tear into it',
tore into it like so many maniacs.Instead of cleaning any parts of
the woodwork that were greasy or very dirty, they brushed them over
with a coat of spirit varnish before painting to make sure that the
paint would dry: places where the plaster of the walls was damaged were
repaired with what was humorously called 'garden cement'--which was the
technical term for dirt out of the garden--and the surface was skimmed
over with proper material.Ceilings that were not very dirty were not
washed off, but dusted, and lightly gone over with a thin coat of
whitewash.The old paper was often left upon the walls of rooms that
were supposed to be stripped before being repapered, and to conceal
this the joints of the old paper were rubbed down so that they should
not be perceptible through the new paper.As far as possible, Misery
and the sub-foreman avoided doing the work the customers paid for, and
even what little they did was hurried over anyhow.A reign of terror--the terror of the sack--prevailed on all the 'jobs',
which were carried on to the accompaniment of a series of alarums and
excursions: no man felt safe for a moment: at the most unexpected times
Misery would arrive and rush like a whirlwind all over the 'job'.If
he happened to find a man having a spell the culprit was immediately
discharged, but he did not get the opportunity of doing this very often
for everybody was too terrified to leave off working even for a few
minutes' rest.From the moment of Hunter's arrival until his departure, a state of
panic, hurry, scurry and turmoil reigned.His strident voice rang
through the house as he bellowed out to them to 'Rouse themselves!We've got another job to
start when you've done this!'Occasionally, just to keep the others up to concert pitch, he used to
sack one of the men for being too slow.They all trembled before him
and ran about whenever he spoke to or called them, because they knew
that there were always a lot of other men out of work who would be
willing and eager to fill their places if they got the sack.Although it was now summer, and the Distress Committee and all the
other committees had suspended operations, there was still always a
large number of men hanging about the vicinity of the Fountain on the
Parade--The Wage Slave Market.When men finished up for the firm they
were working for they usually made for that place.Any master in want
of a wage slave for a few hours, days or weeks could always buy one
there.The men knew this and they also knew that if they got the sack
from one firm it was no easy matter to get another job, and that was
why they were terrified.When Misery was gone--to repeat the same performance at some other
job--the sub-foreman would have a crawl round to see how the chaps were
getting on: to find out if they had used up all their paint yet, or to
bring them some putty so that they should not have to leave their work
to go to get anything themselves: and then very often Rushton himself
would come and stalk quietly about the house or stand silently behind
the men, watching them as they worked.He seldom spoke to anyone, but
just stood there like a graven image, or walked about like a dumb
animal--a pig, as the men used to say.This individual had a very
exalted idea of his own importance and dignity.One man got the sack
for presuming to stop him in the street to ask some questions about
some work that was being done.Misery went round to all the jobs the next day and told all the
'coddies' to tell all the hands that they were never to speak to Mr
Rushton if they met him in the street, and the following Saturday the
man who had so offended was given his back day, ostensibly because
there was nothing for him to do, but really for the reason stated above.There was one job, the outside of a large house that stood on elevated
ground overlooking the town.The men who were working there were even
more than usually uncomfortable, for it was said that Rushton used to
sit in his office and watch them through a telescope.Sometimes, when it was really necessary to get a job done by a certain
time, they had to work late, perhaps till eight or nine o'clock.No
time was allowed for tea, but some of them brought sufficient food with
them in the morning to enable them to have a little about six o'clock
in the evening.Others arranged for their children to bring them some
tea from home.As a rule, they partook of this without stopping work:
they had it on the floor beside them and ate and drank and worked at
the same time--a paint-brushful of white lead in one hand, and a piece
of bread and margarine in the other.On some jobs, if the 'coddy'
happened to be a decent sort, they posted a sentry to look out for
Hunter or Rushton while the others knocked off for a few minutes to
snatch a mouthful of grub; but it was not safe always to do this, for
there was often some crawling sneak with an ambition to become a
'coddy' who would not scruple to curry favour with Misery by reporting
the crime.As an additional precaution against the possibility of any of the men
idling or wasting their time, each one was given a time-sheet on which
he was required to account for every minute of the day.The form of

One Monday morning Misery gave each of the sub-foremen an envelope
containing one of the firm's memorandum forms.Crass opened his and
found the following:

Crass

When you are on a job with men under you, check and initial their
time-sheets every night.If they are called away and sent to some other job, or stood off, check
and initial their time-sheets as they leave your job.Any man coming on your job during the day, you must take note of the
exact time of his arrival, and see that his sheet is charged right.Any man who is slow or lazy, or any man that you notice talking more
than is necessary during working hours, you must report him to Mr
Hunter.We expect you and the other foremen to help us to carry out
these rules, AND ANY INFORMATION GIVEN US ABOUT ANY MAN IS TREATED IN
CONFIDENCE.Note: This applies to all men of all trades who come on the jobs of
which you are the foreman.Every week the time-sheets were scrutinized, and every now and then a
man would be 'had up on the carpet' in the office before Rushton and
Misery, and interrogated as to why he had taken fifteen hours to do ten
hours work?In the event of the accused being unable to give a
satisfactory explanation of his conduct he was usually sacked on the
spot.Misery was frequently called 'up on the carpet' himself.If he made a mistake in figuring out a 'job', and gave in too high a
tender for it, so that the firm did not get the work, Rushton grumbled.If the price was so low that there was not enough profit, Rushton was
very unpleasant about it, and whenever it happened that there was not
only no profit but an actual loss, Rushton created such a terrible
disturbance that Misery was nearly frightened to death and used to get
on his bicycle and rush off to the nearest 'job' and howl and bellow at
the 'chaps' to get it done.All the time the capabilities of the men--especially with regard to
speed--were carefully watched and noted: and whenever there was a
slackness of work and it was necessary to discharge some hands those
that were slow or took too much pains were weeded out: this of course
was known to the men and it had the desired effect upon them.In justice to Rushton and Hunter, it must be remembered that there was
a certain amount of excuse for all this driving and cheating, because
they had to compete with all the other firms, who conducted their
business in precisely the same way.It was not their fault, but the
fault of the system.A dozen firms tendered for every 'job', and of course the lowest tender
usually obtained the work.Knowing this, they all cut the price down
to the lowest possible figure and the workmen had to suffer.The trouble was that there were too many'masters'.It would have been
far better for the workmen if nine out of every ten of the employers
had never started business.Then the others would have been able to
get a better price for their work, and the men might have had better
wages and conditions.The hands, however, made no such allowances or
excuses as these for Misery and Rushton.They never thought or spoke
of them except with hatred and curses.But whenever either of them
came to the 'job' the 'coddies' cringed and grovelled before them,
greeting them with disgustingly servile salutations, plentifully
interspersed with the word 'Sir', greetings which were frequently
either ignored altogether or answered with an inarticulate grunt.They
said 'Sir' at nearly every second word: it made one feel sick to hear
them because it was not courtesy: they were never courteous to each
other, it was simply abject servility and self-contempt.One of the results of all the frenzied hurrying was that every now and
then there was an accident: somebody got hurt: and it was strange that
accidents were not more frequent, considering the risks that were
taken.When they happened to be working on ladders in busy streets
they were not often allowed to have anyone to stand at the foot, and
the consequence was that all sorts and conditions of people came into
violent collision with the bottoms of the ladders.Small boys playing
in the reckless manner characteristic of their years rushed up against
them.Errand boys, absorbed in the perusal of penny instalments of the
adventures of Claude Duval, and carrying large baskets of
green-groceries, wandered into them.People with large feet became
entangled in them.Fat persons of both sexes who thought it unlucky to
walk underneath, tried to negotiate the narrow strip of pavement
between the foot of the ladder and the kerb, and in their passage
knocked up against the ladder and sometimes fell into the road.Nursemaids wheeling perambulators--lolling over the handle, which they
usually held with their left hands, the right holding a copy of Orange
Blossoms or some halfpenny paper, and so interested in the story of the
Marquis of Lymejuice--a young man of noble presence and fabulous
wealth, with a drooping golden moustache and very long legs, who,
notwithstanding the diabolical machinations of Lady Sibyl Malvoise, who
loves him as well as a woman with a name like that is capable of loving
anyone, is determined to wed none other than the scullery-maid at the
Village Inn--inevitably bashed the perambulators into the ladders.Even when the girls were not reading they nearly always ran into the
ladders, which seemed to possess a magnetic attraction for
perambulators and go-carts of all kinds, whether propelled by nurses or
mothers.Sometimes they would advance very cautiously towards the
ladder: then, when they got very near, hesitate a little whether to go
under or run the risk of falling into the street by essaying the narrow
passage: then they would get very close up to the foot of the ladder,
and dodge and dance about, and give the cart little pushes from side to
side, until at last the magnetic influence exerted itself and the
perambulator crashed into the ladder, perhaps at the very moment that
the man at the top was stretching out to do some part of the work
almost beyond his reach.Once Harlow had just started painting some rainpipes from the top of a
40-ft ladder when one of several small boys who were playing in the
street ran violently against the foot.Harlow was so startled that he
dropped his brushes and clutched wildly at the ladder, which turned
completely round and slid about six feet along the parapet into the
angle of the wall, with Harlow hanging beneath by his hands.The paint
pot was hanging by a hook from one of the rungs, and the jerk scattered
the brown paint it contained all over Harlow and all over the brickwork
of the front of the house.He managed to descend safely by clasping
his legs round the sides of the ladder and sliding down.When Misery
came there was a row about what he called carelessness.And the next
day Harlow had to wear his Sunday trousers to work.On another occasion they were painting the outside of a house called
'Gothic Lodge'.At one corner it had a tower surmounted by a spire or
steeple, and this steeple terminated with an ornamental wrought-iron
pinnacle which had to be painted.The ladder they had was not quite
long enough, and besides that, as it had to stand in a sort of a
courtyard at the base of the tower, it was impossible to slant it
sufficiently: instead of lying along the roof of the steeple, it was
sticking up in the air.When Easton went up to paint the pinnacle he had to stand on almost the
very top rung of the ladder, to be exact, the third from the top, and
lean over to steady himself by holding on to the pinnacle with his left
hand while he used the brush with his right.As it was only about
twenty minutes' work there were two men to hold the foot of the ladder.It was cheaper to do it this way than to rig up a proper scaffold,
which would have entailed perhaps two hours' work for two or three men.Of course it was very dangerous, but that did not matter at all,
because even if the man fell it would make no difference to the
firm--all the men were insured and somehow or other, although they
frequently had narrow escapes, they did not often come to grief.On this occasion, just as Easton was finishing he felt the pinnacle
that he was holding on to give way, and he got such a fright that his
heart nearly stopped beating.He let go his hold and steadied himself
on the ladder as well as he was able, and when he had descended three
or four steps--into comparative safety--he remained clinging
convulsively to the ladder and feeling so limp that he was unable to go
down any further for several minutes.When he arrived at the bottom
and the others noticed how white and trembling he was, he told them
about the pinnacle being loose, and the 'coddy' coming along just then,
they told him about it, and suggested that it should be repaired, as
otherwise it might fall down and hurt someone: but the 'coddy' was
afraid that if they reported it they might be blamed for breaking it,
and the owner might expect the firm to put it right for nothing, so
they decided to say nothing about it.The pinnacle is still on the
apex of the steeple waiting for a sufficiently strong wind to blow it
down on somebody's head.When the other men heard of Easton's 'narrow shave', most of them said
that it would have served him bloody well right if he had fallen and
broken his neck: he should have refused to go up at all without a
proper scaffold.If Misery or the
coddy had ordered any of THEM to go up and paint the pinnacle off that
ladder, they would have chucked their tools down and demanded their
ha'pence!That was what they said, but somehow or other it never happened that
any of them ever 'chucked their tools down' at all, although such
dangerous jobs were of very frequent occurrence.The scamping business was not confined to houses or properties of an
inferior class: it was the general rule.Large good-class houses,
villas and mansions, the residences of wealthy people, were done in
exactly the same way.Generally in such places costly and beautiful
materials were spoilt in the using.There was a large mansion where the interior woodwork--the doors,
windows and staircase--had to be finished in white enamel.It was
rather an old house and the woodwork needed rubbing down and filling up
before being repainted, but of course there was not time for that, so
they painted it without properly preparing it and when it was enamelled
the rough, uneven surface of the wood looked horrible: but the owner
appeared quite satisfied because it was nice and shiny.The
dining-room of the same house was papered with a beautiful and
expensive plush paper.The ground of this wall-hanging was made to
imitate crimson watered silk, and it was covered with a raised pattern
in plush of the same colour.The price marked on the back of this
paper in the pattern book was eighteen shillings a roll.Slyme was
paid sixpence a roll for hanging it: the room took ten rolls, so it
cost nine pounds for the paper and five shillings to hang it!To fix
such a paper as this properly the walls should first be done with a
plain lining paper of the same colour as the ground of the wallpaper
itself, because unless the paperhanger 'lapps' the joints--which should
not be done--they are apt to open a little as the paper dries and to
show the white wall underneath--Slyme suggested this lining to Misery,
who would not entertain the idea for a moment--they had gone to quite
enough expense as it was, stripping the old paper off!So Slyme went ahead, and as he had to make his wages, he could not
spend a great deal of time over it.Some of the joints were 'lapped'
and some were butted, and two or three weeks after the owner of the
house moved in, as the paper became more dry, the joints began to open
and to show the white plaster of the wall, and then Owen had to go
there with a small pot of crimson paint and a little brush, and touch
out the white line.While he was doing this he noticed and touched up a number of other
faults; places where Slyme--in his haste to get the work done--had
slobbered and smeared the face of the paper with fingermarks and paste.The same ghastly mess was made of several other 'jobs' besides this
one, and presently they adopted the plan of painting strips of colour
on the wall in the places where the joints would come, so that if they
opened the white wall would not show: but it was found that the paste
on the back of the paper dragged the paint off the wall, and when the
joints opened the white streaks showed all the same, so Misery
abandoned all attempts to prevent joints showing, and if a customer
complained, he sent someone to 'touch it up': but the lining paper was
never used, unless the customer or the architect knew enough about the
work to insist upon it.In other parts of the same house the ceilings, the friezes, and the
dados, were covered with 'embossed' or'relief' papers.These hangings
require very careful handling, for the raised parts are easily damaged;
but the men who fixed them were not allowed to take the pains and time
necessary to make good work: consequently in many places--especially at
the joints--the pattern was flattened out and obliterated.The ceiling of the drawing-room was done with a very thick high-relief
paper that was made in sheets about two feet square.These squares
were not very true in shape: they had evidently warped in drying after
manufacture: to make them match anything like properly would need
considerable time and care.But the men were not allowed to take the
necessary time.The result was that when it was finished it presented
a sort of 'higgledy-piggledy' appearance.But it didn't matter:
nothing seemed to matter except to get it done.One would think from
the way the hands were driven and chivvied and hurried over the work
that they were being paid five or six shillings an hour instead of as
many pence.'For God's sake
get it done!We're losing money over this
"job"!If you chaps don't wake up and move a bit quicker, I shall see
if I can't get somebody else who will.'These costly embossed decorations were usually finished in white; but
instead of carefully coating them with specially prepared paint of
patent distemper, which would need two or three coats, they slobbered
one thick coat of common whitewash on to it with ordinary whitewash
brushes.This was a most economical way to get over it, because it made it
unnecessary to stop up the joints beforehand--the whitewash filled up
all the cracks: and it also filled up the hollow parts, the crevices
and interstices of the ornament, destroying the sharp outlines of the
beautiful designs and reducing the whole to a lumpy, formless mass.But
that did not matter either, so long as they got it done.The architect didn't notice it, because he knew that the more Rushton &
Co.made out of the 'job', the more he himself would make.The man who had to pay for the work didn't notice it; he had the
fullest confidence in the architect.At the risk of wearying the long-suffering reader, mention must be made
of an affair that happened at this particular 'job'.The windows were all fitted with venetian blinds.The gentleman for
whom all the work was being done had only just purchased the house, but
he preferred roller blinds: he had had roller blinds in his former
residence--which he had just sold--and as these roller blinds were
about the right size, he decided to have them fitted to the windows of
his new house: so he instructed Mr Rushton to have all the venetian
blinds taken down and stored away up in the loft under the roof.Mr
Rushton promised to have this done; but they were not ALL put away
under the roof: he had four of them taken to his own place and fitted
up in the conservatory.They were a little too large, so they had to
be narrowed before they were fixed.The sequel was rather interesting, for it happened that when the
gentleman attempted to take the roller blinds from his old house, the
person to whom he had sold it refused to allow them to be removed;
claiming that when he bought the house, he bought the blinds also.There was a little dispute, but eventually it was settled that way and
the gentleman decided that he would have the venetian blinds in his new
house after all, and instructed the people who moved his furniture to
take the venetians down again from under the roof, and refix them, and
then, of course, it was discovered that four of the blinds were
missing.Mr Rushton was sent for, and he said that he couldn't
understand it at all!The only possible explanation that he could
think of was that some of his workmen must have stolen them!He would
make inquiries, and endeavour to discover the culprits, but in any
case, as this had happened while things were in his charge, if he did
not succeed in recovering them, he would replace them.As the blinds had been narrowed to fit the conservatory he had to have
four new ones made.The customer was of course quite satisfied, although very sorry for Mr
Rushton.Rushton told the gentleman
that he would be astonished if he knew all the facts: the difficulties
one has to contend with in dealing with working men: one has to watch
them continually!directly one's back is turned they leave off working!They come late in the morning, and go home before the proper time at
night, and then unless one actually happens to catch them--they charge
the full number of hours on their time sheets!Every now and then
something would be missing, and of course Nobody knew anything about
it.Sometimes one would go unexpectedly to a 'job' and find a lot of
them drunk.Of course one tried to cope with these evils by means of
rules and restrictions and organization, but it was very difficult--one
could not be everywhere or have eyes at the back of one's head.The
gentleman said that he had some idea of what it was like: he had had
something to do with the lower orders himself at one time and another,
and he knew they needed a lot of watching.Rushton felt rather sick over this affair, but he consoled himself by
reflecting that he had got clear away with several valuable rose trees
and other plants which he had stolen out of the garden, and that a
ladder which had been discovered in the hayloft over the stable and
taken--by his instructions--to the 'yard' when the 'job' was finished
had not been missed.Another circumstance which helped to compensate for the blinds was that
the brass fittings throughout the house, finger-plates, sash-lifts and
locks, bolts and door handles, which were supposed to be all new and
which the customer had paid a good price for--were really all the old
ones which Misery had had re-lacquered and refixed.There was nothing unusual about this affair of the blinds, for Rushton
and Misery robbed everybody.They made a practice of annexing every
thing they could lay their hands upon, provided it could be done
without danger to themselves.They never did anything of a heroic or
dare-devil character: they had not the courage to break into banks or
jewellers' shops in the middle of the night, or to go out picking
pockets: all their robberies were of the sneak-thief order.At one house that they 'did up' Misery made a big haul.He had to get
up into the loft under the roof to see what was the matter with the
water tank.When he got up there he found a very fine hall gas lamp
made of wrought brass and copper with stained and painted glass sides.Although covered with dust, it was otherwise in perfect condition, so
Misery had it taken to his own house and cleaned up and fixed in the
hall.In the same loft there were a lot of old brass picture rods and other
fittings, and three very good planks, each about ten feet in length;
these latter had been placed across the rafters so that one could walk
easily and safely over to the tank.But Misery thought they would be
very useful to the firm for whitewashing ceilings and other work, so he
had them taken to the yard along with the old brass, which was worth
about fourpence a pound.There was another house that had to be painted inside: the people who
used to live there had only just left: they had moved to some other
town, and the house had been re-let before they vacated it.The new
tenant had agreed with the agent that the house was to be renovated
throughout before he took possession.The day after the old tenants moved away, the agent gave Rushton the
key so that he could go to see what was to be done and give an estimate
for the work.While Rushton and Misery were looking over the house they discovered a
large barometer hanging on the wall behind the front door: it had been
overlooked by those who removed the furniture.Before returning the
key to the agent, Rushton sent one of his men to the house for the
barometer, which he kept in his office for a few weeks to see if there
would be any inquiries about it.If there had been, it would have been
easy to say that he had brought it there for safety--to take care of
till he could find the owner.The people to whom it belonged thought
the thing had been lost or stolen in transit, and afterwards one of the
workmen who had assisted to pack and remove the furniture was dismissed
from his employment on suspicion of having had something to do with its
disappearance.No one ever thought of Rushton in connection with the
matter, so after about a month he had it taken to his own dwelling and
hung up in the hall near the carved oak marble-topped console table
that he had sneaked last summer from 596 Grand Parade.And there it hangs unto this day: and close behind it, supported by
cords of crimson silk, is a beautiful bevelled-edged card about a foot
square, and upon this card is written, in letters of gold: 'Christ is
the head of this house; the unseen Guest at every meal, the silent
Listener to every conversation.'And on the other side of the barometer is another card of the same kind
and size which says: 'As for me and my house we will serve the Lord.'From another place they stole two large brass chandeliers.This house
had been empty for a very long time, and its owner--who did not reside
in the town--wished to sell it.The agent, to improve the chances of a
sale, decided to have the house overhauled and redecorated.'s tender being the lowest, they got the work.The chandeliers in
the drawing-room and the dining-room were of massive brass, but they
were all blackened and tarnished.Misery suggested to the agent that
they could be cleaned and relacquered, which would make them equal to
new: in fact, they would be better than new ones, for such things as
these were not made now, and for once Misery was telling the truth.The agent agreed and the work was done: it was an extra, of course, and
as the firm got twice as much for the job as they paid for having it
done, they were almost satisfied.When this and all the other work was finished they sent in their
account and were paid.Some months afterwards the house was sold, and Nimrod interviewed the
new proprietor with the object of securing the order for any work that
he might want done.The papers on the walls of
several of the rooms were not to the new owner's taste, and, of course,
the woodwork would have to be re-painted to harmonize with the new
paper.There was a lot of other work besides this: a new conservatory
to build, a more modern bath and heating apparatus to be put in, and
the electric light to be installed, the new people having an objection
to the use of gas.The specifications were prepared by an architect, and Rushton secured
the work.When the chandeliers were taken down, the men, instructed by
Misery, put them on a handcart, and covered them over with sacks and
dust-sheets and took them to the front shop, where they were placed for
sale with the other stock.When all the work at the house was finished, it occurred to Rushton and
Nimrod that when the architect came to examine and pass the work before
giving them the certificate that would enable them to present their
account, he might remember the chandeliers and inquire what had become
of them.So they were again placed on the handcart, covered with sacks
and dust-sheets, taken back to the house and put up in the loft under
the roof so that, if he asked for them, there they were.The architect came, looked ever the house, passed the work, and gave
his certificate; he never mentioned or thought of the chandeliers.The
owner of the house was present and asked for Rushton's bill, for which
he at once gave them a cheque and Rushton and Misery almost grovelled
and wallowed on the ground before him.Throughout the whole interview
the architect and the 'gentleman' had kept their hats on, but Rushton
and Nimrod had been respectfully uncovered all the time, and as they
followed the other two about the house their bearing had been
expressive of the most abject servility.When the architect and the owner were gone the two chandeliers were
taken down again from under the roof, and put upon a handcart, covered
over with sacks and dust-sheets and taken back to the shop and again
placed for sale with the other stock.These are only a few of the petty thefts committed by these people.To
give anything approaching a full account of all the rest would require
a separate volume.As a result of all the hurrying and scamping, every now and again the
men found that they had worked themselves out of a job.Several times during the summer the firm had scarcely anything to do,
and nearly everybody had to stand off for a few days or weeks.When Newman got his first start in the early part of the year he had
only been working for about a fortnight when--with several others--he
was'stood off'.Fortunately, however, the day after he left Rushtons,
he was lucky enough to get a start for another firm, Driver and
Botchit, where he worked for nearly a month, and then he was again
given a job at Rushton's, who happened to be busy again.He did not have to lose much time, for he 'finished up' for Driver and
Botchit on a Thursday night and on the Friday he interviewed Misery,
who told him they were about to commence a fresh 'job' on the following
Monday morning at six o'clock, and that he could start with them.So
this time Newman was only out of work the Friday and Saturday, which
was another stroke of luck, because it often happens that a man has to
lose a week or more after 'finishing up' for one firm before he gets
another 'job'.All through the summer Crass continued to be the general 'colour-man',
most of his time being spent at the shop mixing up colours for all the
different 'jobs'.He also acted as a sort of lieutenant to Hunter,
who, as the reader has already been informed, was not a practical
painter.When there was a price to be given for some painting work,
Misery sometimes took Crass with him to look over it and help him to
estimate the amount of time and material it would take.Crass was thus
in a position of more than ordinary importance, not only being superior
to the 'hands', but also ranking above the other sub-foremen who had
charge of the 'jobs'.It was Crass and these sub-foremen who were to blame for most of the
scamping and driving, because if it had not been for them neither
Rushton nor Hunter would have known how to scheme the work.Of course, Hunter and Rushton wanted to drive and scamp, but not being
practical men they would not have known how if it had not been for
Crass and the others, who put them up to all the tricks of the trade.Crass knew that when the men stayed till half past seven they were in
the habit of ceasing work for a few minutes to eat a mouthful of grub
about six o'clock, so he suggested to Misery that as it was not
possible to stop this, it would be a good plan to make the men stop
work altogether from half past five till six, and lose half an hour's
pay; and to make up the time, instead of leaving off at seven-thirty,
they could work till eight.Misery had known of and winked at the former practice, for he knew that
the men could not work all that time without something to eat, but
Crass's suggestion seemed a much better way, and it was adopted.When the other masters in Mugsborough heard of this great reform they
all followed suit, and it became the rule in that town, whenever it was
necessary to work overtime, for the men to stay till eight instead of
half past seven as formerly, and they got no more pay than before.Previous to this summer it had been the almost invariable rule to have
two men in each room that was being painted, but Crass pointed out to
Misery that under such circumstances they wasted time talking to each
other, and they also acted as a check on one another: each of them
regulated the amount of work he did by the amount the other did, and if
the 'job' took too long it was always difficult to decide which of the
two was to blame: but if they were made to work alone, each of them
would be on his mettle; he would not know how much the others were
doing, and the fear of being considered slow in comparison with others
would make them all tear into it all they could.Misery thought this a very good idea, so the solitary system was
introduced, and as far as practicable, one room, one man became the
rule.They even tried to make the men distemper large ceilings single-handed,
and succeeded in one or two cases, but after several ceilings had been
spoilt and had to be washed off and done over again, they gave that up:
but nearly all the other work was now arranged on the'solitary
system', and it worked splendidly: each man was constantly in a state
of panic as to whether the others were doing more work than himself.Another suggestion that Crass made to Misery was that the sub-foremen
should be instructed never to send a man into a room to prepare it for
painting.'If you sends a man into a room to get it ready,' said Crass, ''e makes
a meal of it!'E spends as much time messin' about rubbin' down and
stoppin' up as it would take to paint it.But,' he added, with a
cunning leer, 'give 'em a bit of putty and a little bit of glass-paper,
and the paint at the stand, and then 'e gits it in 'is mind as 'e's
going in there to paint it!And 'e doesn't mess about much over the
preparing of it'.These and many other suggestions--all sorts of devices for scamping and
getting over the work--were schemed out by Crass and the other
sub-foremen, who put them into practice and showed them to Misery and
Rushton in the hope of currying favour with them and being 'kept on'.And between the lot of them they made life a veritable hell for
themselves, and the hands, and everybody else around them.And the
mainspring of it all was--the greed and selfishness of one man, who
desired to accumulate money!For this was the only object of all the
driving and bullying and hatred and cursing and unhappiness--to make
money for Rushton, who evidently considered himself a deserving case.It is sad and discreditable, but nevertheless true, that some of the
more selfish of the philanthropists often became weary of well-doing,
and lost all enthusiasm in the good cause.At such times they used to
say that they were 'Bloody well fed up' with the whole business and
'Tired of tearing their bloody guts out for the benefit of other
people' and every now and then some of these fellows would 'chuck up'
work, and go on the booze, sometimes stopping away for two or three
days or a week at a time.And then, when it was all over, they came
back, very penitent, to ask for another'start', but they generally
found that their places had been filled.If they happened to be good'sloggers'--men who made a practice of
'tearing their guts out' when they did work--they were usually
forgiven, and after being admonished by Misery, permitted to resume
work, with the understanding that if ever it occurred again they would
get the 'infernal'--which means the final and irrevocable--sack.There was once a job at a shop that had been a high-class restaurant
kept by a renowned Italian chef.It had been known as

                    'MACARONI'S ROYAL ITALIAN CAFE'

Situated on the Grand Parade, it was a favourite resort of the 'Elite',
who frequented it for afternoon tea and coffee and for little suppers
after the theatre.It had plate-glass windows, resplendent with gilding, marble-topped
tables with snow white covers, vases of flowers, and all the other
appurtenances of glittering cut glass and silver.The obsequious
waiters were in evening dress, the walls were covered with lofty
plate-glass mirrors in carved and gilded frames, and at certain hours
of the day and night an orchestra consisting of two violins and a harp
discoursed selections of classic music.But of late years the business had not been paying, and finally the
proprietor went bankrupt and was sold out.The place was shut up for
several months before the shop was let to a firm of dealers in fancy
articles, and the other part was transformed into flats.When the men went there to 'do
it up' they found the interior of the house in a state of indescribable
filth: the ceilings discoloured with smoke and hung with cobwebs, the
wallpapers smeared and black with grease, the handrails and the newel
posts of the staircase were clammy with filth, and the edges of the
doors near the handles were blackened with greasy dirt and
finger-marks.The tops of the skirtings, the mouldings of the doors,
the sashes of the windows and the corners of the floors were thick with
the accumulated dust of years.In one of the upper rooms which had evidently been used as a nursery or
playroom for the children of the renowned chef, the wallpaper for about
two feet above the skirting was blackened with grease and ornamented
with childish drawings made with burnt sticks and blacklead pencils,
the door being covered with similar artistic efforts, to say nothing of
some rude attempts at carving, evidently executed with an axe or a
hammer.But all this filth was nothing compared with the unspeakable
condition of the kitchen and scullery, a detailed description of which
would cause the blood of the reader to curdle, and each particular hair
of his head to stand on end.Let it suffice to say that the walls, the ceiling, the floor, the
paintwork, the gas-stove, the kitchen range, the dresser and everything
else were uniformly absolutely and literally--black.And the black was
composed of soot and grease.In front of the window there was a fixture--a kind of bench or table,
deeply scored with marks of knives like a butcher's block.The sill of
the window was about six inches lower than the top of the table, so
that between the glass of the lower sash of the window, which had
evidently never been raised, and the back of the table, there was a
long narrow cavity or trough, about six inches deep, four inches wide
and as long as the width of the window, the sill forming the bottom of
the cavity.This trough was filled with all manner of abominations: fragments of
fat and decomposed meat, legs of rabbits and fowls, vegetable matter,
broken knives and forks, and hair: and the glass of the window was
caked with filth of the same description.This job was the cause of the sacking of the Semi-drunk and another man
named Bill Bates, who were sent into the kitchen to clean it down and
prepare it for painting and distempering.They commenced to do it, but it made them feel so ill that they went
out and had a pint each, and after that they made another start at it.But it was not long before they felt that it was imperatively necessary
to have another drink.So they went over to the pub, and this time
they had two pints each.Bill paid for the first two and then the
Semi-drunk refused to return to work unless Bill would consent to have
another pint with him before going back.When they had drunk the two
pints, they decided--in order to save themselves the trouble and risk
of coming away from the job--to take a couple of quarts back with them
in two bottles, which the landlord of the pub lent them, charging
twopence on each bottle, to be refunded when they were returned.When they got back to the job they found the 'coddy' in the kitchen,
looking for them and he began to talk and grumble, but the Semi-drunk
soon shut him up: he told him he could either have a drink out of one
of the bottles or a punch in the bloody nose--whichever he liked!Or
if he did not fancy either of these alternatives, he could go to hell!As the 'coddy' was a sensible man he took the beer and advised them to
pull themselves together and try to get some work done before Misery
came, which they promised to do.When the 'coddy' was gone they made another attempt at the work.Misery
came a little while afterwards and began shouting at them because he
said he could not see what they had done.It looked as if they had
been asleep all the morning: Here it was nearly ten o'clock, and as far
as he could see, they had done Nothing!When he was gone they drank the rest of the beer and then they began to
feel inclined to laugh.What did they care for Hunter or Rushton
either?They left off scraping and
scrubbing, and began throwing buckets of water over the dresser and the
walls, laughing uproariously all the time.'We'll show the b--s how to wash down paintwork!'shouted the
Semi-drunk, as he stood in the middle of the room and hurled a pailful
of water over the door of the cupboard.'Bring us another bucket of
water, Bill.'Bill was out in the scullery filling his pail under the tap, and
laughing so much that he could scarcely stand.As soon as it was full
he passed it to the Semi-drunk, who threw it bodily, pail and all, on
to the bench in front of the window, smashing one of the panes of
glass.The water poured off the table and all over the floor.Bill brought the next pailful in and threw it at the kitchen door,
splitting one of the panels from top to bottom, and then they threw
about half a dozen more pailfuls over the dresser.'We'll show the b--rs how to clean paintwork,' they shouted, as they
hurled the buckets at the walls and doors.By this time the floor was deluged with water, which mingled with the
filth and formed a sea of mud.They left the two taps running in the scullery and as the waste pipe of
the sink was choked up with dirt, the sink filled up and overflowed
like a miniature Niagara.The water ran out under the doors into the back-yard, and along the
passage out to the front door.But Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk
remained in the kitchen, smashing the pails at the walls and doors and
the dresser, and cursing and laughing hysterically.They had just filled the two buckets and were bringing them into the
kitchen when they heard Hunter's voice in the passage, shouting out
inquiries as to where all that water came from.Then they heard him
advancing towards them and they stood waiting for him with the pails in
their hands, and directly he opened the door and put his head into the
room they let fly the two pails at him.Unfortunately, they were too
drunk and excited to aim straight.One pail struck the middle rail of
the door and the other the wall by the side of it.Misery hastily shut the door again and ran upstairs, and presently the
'coddy' came down and called out to them from the passage.They went out to see what he wanted, and he told them that Misery had
gone to the office to get their wages ready: they were to make out
their time sheets and go for their money at once.Misery had said that
if they were not there in ten minutes he would have the pair of them
locked up.The Semi-drunk said that nothing would suit them better than to have
all their pieces at once--they had spent all their money and wanted
another drink.Bill Bates concurred, so they borrowed a piece of
blacklead pencil from the 'coddy' and made out their time sheets, took
off their aprons, put them into their tool bags, and went to the office
for their money, which Misery passed out to them through the trap-door.The news of this exploit spread all over the town during that day and
evening, and although it was in July, the next morning at six o'clock
there were half a dozen men waiting at the yard to ask Misery if there
was 'any chance of a job'.Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk had had their spree and had got the sack
for it and most of the chaps said it served them right.Such conduct
as that was going too far.Most of them would have said the same thing no matter what the
circumstances might have been.They had very little sympathy for each
other at any time.Often, when, for instance, one man was sent away from one 'job' to
another, the others would go into his room and look at the work he had
been doing, and pick out all the faults they could find and show them
to each other, making all sorts of ill-natured remarks about the absent
one meanwhile.'Jist run yer nose over that door, Jim,' one would say
in a tone of disgust.Did yer ever see sich a
mess in yer life?And the other man would
shake his head sadly and say that although the one who had done it had
never been up to much as a workman, he could do it a bit better than
that if he liked, but the fact was that he never gave himself time to
do anything properly: he was always tearing his bloody guts out!Why,
he'd only been in this room about four hours from start to finish!He
ought to have a watering cart to follow him about, because he worked at
such a hell of a rate you couldn't see him for dust!And then the
first man would reply that other people could do as they liked, but for
his part, HE was not going to tear his guts out for nobody!The second man would applaud these sentiments and say that he wasn't
going to tear his out either: and then they would both go back to their
respective rooms and tear into the work for all they were worth, making
the same sort of 'job' as the one they had been criticizing, and
afterwards, when the other's back was turned, each of them in turn
would sneak into the other's room and criticize it and point out the
faults to anyone else who happened to be near at hand.Harlow was working at the place that had been Macaroni's Cafe when one
day a note was sent to him from Hunter at the shop.It was written on
a scrap of wallpaper, and worded in the usual manner of such notes--as
if the writer had studied how to avoid all suspicion of being unduly
civil:

    Harlow go to the yard at once take your tools with you.Crass will tell you where you have to go.They were just finishing their dinners when the boy brought this note;
and after reading it aloud for the benefit of the others, Harlow
remarked that it was worded in much the same way in which one would
speak to a dog.The others said nothing; but after he was gone the
other men--who all considered that it was ridiculous for the 'likes of
us' to expect or wish to be treated with common civility--laughed about
it, and said that Harlow was beginning to think he was Somebody: they
supposed it was through readin' all those books what Owen was always
lendin' 'im.And then one of them got a piece of paper and wrote a
note to be given to Harlow at the first opportunity.This note was
properly worded, written in a manner suitable for a gentleman like him,
neatly folded and addressed:


    Mr Harlow Esq.,
      c/o Macaroni's Royal Cafe
        till called for.Mister Harlow,
      Dear Sir: Wood you kinely oblige me bi cummin to the paint shop
    as soon as you can make it convenient as there is a sealin' to be
    wite-woshed hoppin this is not trubbling you to much

                                                  I remane
                                                  Yours respeckfully
                                                       Pontius Pilate.This note was read out for the amusement of the company and afterwards
stored away in the writer's pocket till such a time as an opportunity
should occur of giving it to Harlow.As the writer of the note was on his way back to his room to resume
work he was accosted by a man who had gone into Harlow's room to
criticize it, and had succeeded in finding several faults which he
pointed out to the other, and of course they were both very much
disgusted with Harlow.'I can't think why the coddy keeps him on the job,' said the first man.'Between you and me, if I had charge of a job, and Misery sent Harlow
there--I'd send 'im back to the shop.''Same as you,' agreed the other as he went back to tear into his own
room.Daniel went back to the kitchen.'Same as you, old man: I shouldn't 'ave 'im neither.'It must not be supposed from this that either of these two men were on
exceptionally bad terms with Harlow; they were just as good friends
with him--to his face--as they were with each other--to each other's
faces--and it was just their way: that was all.If it had been one or both of these two who had gone away instead of
Harlow, just the same things would have been said about them by the
others who remained--it was merely their usual way of speaking about
each other behind each other's backs.It was always the same: if any one of them made a mistake or had an
accident or got into any trouble he seldom or never got any sympathy
from his fellow workmen.On the contrary, most of them at such times
seemed rather pleased than otherwise.There was a poor devil--a stranger in the town; he came from
London--who got the sack for breaking some glass.He had been sent to
'burn off' some old paint of the woodwork of a window.He was not very
skilful in the use of the burning-off lamp, because on the firm when he
had been working in London it was a job that the ordinary hands were
seldom or never called upon to do.There were one or two men who did
it all.For that matter, not many of Rushton's men were very skilful
at it either.It was a job everybody tried to get out of, because
nearly always the lamp went wrong and there was a row about the time
the work took.So they worked this job on to the stranger.This man had been out of work for a long time before he got a start at
Rushton's, and he was very anxious not to lose the job, because he had
a wife and family in London.When the 'coddy' told him to go and burn
off this window he did not like to say that he was not used to the
work: he hoped to be able to do it.But he was very nervous, and the
end was that although he managed to do the burning off all right, just
as he was finishing he accidentally allowed the flame of the lamp to
come into contact with a large pane of glass and broke it.They sent to the shop for a new pane of glass, and the man stayed late
that night and put it in in his own time, thus bearing half the cost of
repairing it.Things were not very busy just then, and on the following Saturday two
of the hands were'stood off'.The stranger was one of them, and
nearly everybody was very pleased.At mealtimes the story of the
broken window was repeatedly told amid jeering laughter.It really
seemed as if a certain amount of indignation was felt that a
stranger--especially such an inferior person as this chap who did not
know how to use a lamp--should have had the cheek to try to earn his
living at all!One thing was very certain--they said, gleefully--he
would never get another job at Rushton's: that was one good thing.And yet they all knew that this accident might have happened to any one
of them.Once a couple of men got the sack because a ceiling they distempered
had to be washed off and done again.It was not really the men's fault
at all: it was a ceiling that needed special treatment and they had not
been allowed to do it properly.But all the same, when they got the sack most of the others laughed and
sneered and were glad.Perhaps because they thought that the fact that
these two unfortunates had been disgraced, increased their own chances
of being 'kept on'.With a few
exceptions, they had an immense amount of respect for Rushton and
Hunter, and very little respect or sympathy for each other.Exactly the same lack of feeling for each other prevailed amongst the
members of all the different trades.Everybody seemed glad if anybody
got into trouble for any reason whatever.There was a garden gate that had been made at the carpenter's shop: it
was not very well put together, and for the usual reason; the man had
not been allowed the time to do it properly.After it was fixed, one
of his shopmates wrote upon it with lead pencil in big letters: 'This
is good work for a joiner.But to hear them talking in the pub of a Saturday afternoon just after
pay-time one would think them the best friends and mates and the most
independent spirits in the world, fellows whom it would be very
dangerous to trifle with, and who would stick up for each other through
thick and thin.All sorts of stories were related of the wonderful
things they had done and said; of jobs they had 'chucked up', and
masters they had 'told off': of pails of whitewash thrown over
offending employers, and of horrible assaults and batteries committed
upon the same.But strange to say, for some reason or other, it seldom
happened that a third party ever witnessed any of these prodigies.It
seemed as if a chivalrous desire to spare the feelings of their victims
had always prevented them from doing or saying anything to them in the
presence of witnesses.When he had drunk a few pints, Crass was a very good hand at these
stories.Here is one that he told in the bar of the Cricketers on the
Saturday afternoon of the same week that Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk
got the sack.The Cricketers was only a few minutes walk from the shop
and at pay-time a number of the men used to go in there to take a drink
before going home.'Last Thursday night about five o'clock, 'Unter comes inter the
paint-shop an' ses to me, "I wants a pail o' wash made up tonight,
Crass," 'e ses, "ready for fust thing in the mornin'," 'e ses."Oh," I
ses, lookin' 'im straight in the bloody eye, "Oh, yer do, do
yer?""Well, you can bloody well make
it yerself!"I ses, "'cos I ain't agoin' to," I ses--just like that."Wot the 'ell do yer mean," I ses, "by comin' 'ere at this time o'
night with a order like that?"You'd a larfed,' continued
Crass, as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand after taking
another drink out of his glass, and looking round to note the effect of
the story, 'you'd a larfed if you'd bin there.'E was fairly
flabbergasted!And wen I said that to 'im I see 'is jaw drop!An'
then 'e started apoligizing and said as 'e 'adn't meant no offence, but
I told 'im bloody straight not to come no more of it."You bring the
horder at a reasonable time," I ses--just like that--"and I'll attend
to it," I ses, "but not otherwise," I ses.'As he concluded this story, Crass drained his glass and gazed round
upon the audience, who were full of admiration.They looked at each
other and at Crass and nodded their heads approvingly.Yes,
undoubtedly, that was the proper way to deal with such bounders as
Nimrod; take up a strong attitude, an' let 'em see as you'll stand no
nonsense!'Yer don't blame me, do yer?''Why should we put up
with a lot of old buck from the likes of 'im!We're not a lot of
bloody Chinamen, are we?'So far from blaming him, they all assured him that they would have
acted in precisely the same way under similar circumstances.'For my part, I'm a bloke like this,' said a tall man with a very loud
voice--a chap who nearly fell down dead every time Rushton or Misery
looked at him.'I'm a bloke like this 'ere: I never stands no cheek
from no gaffers!If a guv'nor ses two bloody words to me, I downs me
tools and I ses to 'im, "Wot!Don't I suit yer, guv'ner?Ain't I done
enuff for yer?Gimmie me bleedin' a'pence."'If
only everyone would do the same as the tall man--who had just paid for
another round of drinks--things would be a lot more comfortable than
they was.'Last summer I was workin' for ole Buncer,' said a little man with a
cutaway coat several sizes too large for him.'I was workin' for ole
Buncer, over at Windley, an' you all knows as 'e don't arf lower it.John journeyed to the bathroom.Well, one day, when I knowed 'e was on the drunk, I 'ad to first coat a
room out--white; so thinks I to meself, "If I buck up I shall be able
to get this lot done by about four o'clock, an' then I can clear orf
'ome.'Cos I reckoned as 'e'd be about flattened out by that time, an'
you know 'e ain't got no foreman.So I tears into it an' gets this
'ere room done about a quarter past four, an' I'd just got me things
put away for the night w'en 'oo should come fallin' up the bloody
stairs but ole Buncer, drunk as a howl!An' no sooner 'e gits inter
the room than 'e starts yappin' an' rampin'.""Is this 'ere hall
you've done?""Wotcher bin up to hall day?"'e ses, an'
'e keeps on shouting' an' swearin' till at last I couldn't stand it no
longer, 'cos you can guess I wasn't in a very good temper with 'im
comin' along jist then w'en I thought I was goin' to get orf a bit
early--so w'en 'e kept on shoutin' I never made no answer to 'im, but
ups with me fist an' I gives 'im a slosh in the dial an' stopped 'is
clock!Then I chucked the pot o' w'ite paint hover 'im, an' kicked 'im
down the bloody stairs.''Serve 'im blooming well right, too,' said Crass as he took a fresh
glass of beer from one of the others, who had just'stood' another
round.'What did the b--r say to that?'replied the little man, ''E picked 'isself up, and
called a keb wot was passin' an' got inter it an' went 'ome; an' I
never seen no more of 'im until about 'arf-past eleven the next day,
w'en I was second-coatin' the room, an' 'e comes up with a noo suit o'
clothes on, an' arsts me if I'd like to come hover to the pub an' 'ave
a drink?So we goes hover, an' 'e calls for a w'iskey an' soda for
isself an' arsts me wot I'd 'ave, so I 'ad the same.An' w'ile we was
gettin' it down us, 'e ses to me, "Ah, Garge," 'e ses."You losed your
temper with me yesterday,"' 'e ses.'If you 'adn't served 'im as you did you'd most likely 'ave 'ad to
put up with a lot more ole buck.'They all agreed that the little man had done quite right: they all said
that they didn' blame him in the least: they would all have done the
same: in fact, this was the way they all conducted themselves whenever
occasion demanded it.To hear them talk, one would imagine that such
affairs as the recent exploit of Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk were
constantly taking place, instead of only occurring about once in a blue
moon.Crass stood the final round of drinks, and as he evidently thought that
circumstance deserved to be signalized in some special manner, he
proposed the following toast, which was drunk with enthusiasm:

        'To hell with the man,
        May he never grow fat,
        What carries two faces,
        Under one 'at.'They did not have many
big jobs, but there were a lot of little ones, and the boy Bert was
kept busy running from one to the other.He spent most of his time
dragging a handcart with loads of paint, or planks and steps, and
seldom went out to work with the men, for when he was not taking things
out to the various places where the philanthropists were working, he
was in the paintshop at the yard, scraping out dirty paint-pots or
helping Crass to mix up colours.Although scarcely anyone seemed to
notice it, the boy presented a truly pitiable spectacle.Dragging the handcart did not help him to put on flesh,
for the weather was very hot and the work made him sweat.His home was right away on the other side of Windley.It took him more
than three-quarters of an hour to walk to the shop, and as he had to be
at work at six, that meant that he had to leave home at a few minutes
past five every morning, so that he always got up about half past four.He was wearing a man's coat--or rather jacket--which gave the upper
part of his body a bulky appearance.The trousers were part of a suit
of his own, and were somewhat narrowly cut, as is the rule with boys'
cheap ready-made trousers.These thin legs appearing under the big
jacket gave him a rather grotesque appearance, which was heightened by
the fact that all his clothes, cap, coat, waistcoat, trousers and
boots, were smothered with paint and distemper of various colours, and
there were generally a few streaks of paint of some sort or other upon
his face, and of course his hands--especially round the
fingernails--were grimed with it.But the worst of all were the
dreadful hobnailed boots: the leather of the uppers of these was an
eighth of an inch thick, and very stiff.Across the fore part of the
boot this hard leather had warped into ridges and valleys, which chafed
his feet, and made them bleed.The soles were five-eighths of an inch
thick, covered with hobnails, and were as hard and inflexible and
almost as heavy as iron.These boots hurt his feet dreadfully and made
him feel very tired and miserable, for he had such a lot of walking to
do.He used to be jolly glad when dinner-time came, for then he used to
get out of sight in some quiet spot and lie down for the whole hour.His favourite dining-place was up in the loft over the carpenter's
shop, where they stored the mouldings and architraves.No one ever
came there at that hour, and after he had eaten his dinner he used to
lie down and think and rest.He nearly always had an hour for dinner, but he did not always have it
at the same time: sometimes he had it at twelve o'clock and sometimes
not till two.It all depended upon what stuff had to be taken to the
job.Often it happened that some men at a distant job required some material
to use immediately after dinner, and perhaps Crass was not able to get
it ready till twelve o'clock, so that it was not possible to take it
before dinner-time, and if Bert left it till after dinner the men would
be wasting their time waiting for it: so in such cases he took it there
first and had his dinner when he came back.Sometimes he got back about half past twelve, and it was necessary for
him to take out another lot of material at one o'clock.In such a case he 'charged' half an hour overtime on his time sheet--he
used to get twopence an hour for overtime.Sometimes Crass sent him with a handcart to one job to get a pair of
steps or tressels, or a plank, or some material or other, and take them
to another job, and on these occasions it was often very late before he
was able to take his meals.Instead of getting his breakfast at eight,
it was often nearly nine before he got back to the shop, and frequently
he had to go without dinner until half past one or two.Sometimes he could scarcely manage to carry the pots of paint to the
jobs; his feet were so hot and sore.When he had to push the cart it
was worse still, and often when knocking-off time came he felt so tired
that he could scarcely manage to walk home.But the weather was not always hot or fine: sometimes it was quite
cold, almost like winter, and there was a lot of rain that summer.At
such times the boy frequently got wet through several times a day as he
went from one job to another, and he had to work all the time in his
wet clothes and boots, which were usually old and out of repair and let
in the water.One of the worst jobs that he had to do was when a new stock of white
lead came in.This stuff came in wooden barrels containing two
hundredweight, and he used to have to dig it out of these barrels with
a trowel, and put it into a metal tank, where it was kept covered with
water, and the empty barrels were returned to the makers.When he was doing this work he usually managed to get himself smeared
all over with the white lead, and this circumstance, and the fact that
he was always handling paint or some poisonous material or other was
doubtless the cause of the terrible pains he often had in his
stomach--pains that sometimes caused him to throw himself down and roll
on the ground in agony.One afternoon Crass sent him with a handcart to a job that Easton,
Philpot, Harlow and Owen were just finishing.He got there about half
past four and helped the men to load up the things, and afterwards
walked alongside the cart with them back to the shop.On the way they all noticed and remarked to each other that the boy
looked tired and pale and that he seemed to limp: but he did not say
anything, although he guessed that they were talking about him.They
arrived at the shop a little before knocking-off time--about ten
minutes past five.Bert helped them to unload, and afterwards, while
they were putting their things away and 'charging up' the unused
materials they had brought back, he pushed the cart over to the shed
where it was kept, on the other side of the yard.He did not return to
the shop at once and a few minutes later when Harlow came out into the
yard to get a bucket of water to wash their hands with, he saw the boy
leaning on the side of the cart, crying, and holding one foot off the
ground.Harlow asked him what was the matter, and while he was speaking to him
the others came out to see what was up: the boy said he had rheumatism
or growing pains or something in his leg, 'just here near the knee'.But he didn't say much, he just cried miserably, and turned his head
slowly from side to side, avoiding the looks of the men because he felt
ashamed that they should see him cry.When they saw how ill and miserable he looked, the men all put their
hands in their pockets to get some coppers to give to him so that he
could ride home on the tram.They gave him fivepence altogether, more
than enough to ride all the way; and Crass told him to go at
once--there was no need to wait till half past; but before he went
Philpot got a small glass bottle out of his tool bag and filled it with
oil and turps--two of turps and one of oil--which he gave to Bert to
rub into his leg before going to bed: The turps--he explained--was to
cure the pain and the oil was to prevent it from hurting the skin.He
was to get his mother to rub it in for him if he were too tired to do
it himself.Bert promised to observe these directions, and, drying his
tears, took his dinner basket and limped off to catch the tram.It was a few days after this that Hunter met with an accident.He was
tearing off on his bicycle to one of the jobs about five minutes to
twelve to see if he could catch anyone leaving off for dinner before
the proper time, and while going down a rather steep hill the
front brake broke--the rubbers of the rear one were worn out and failed
to act--so Misery to save himself from being smashed against the
railings of the houses at the bottom of the hill, threw himself off the
machine, with the result that his head and face and hands were terribly
cut and bruised.He was so badly knocked about that he had to remain
at home for nearly three weeks, much to the delight of the men and the
annoyance--one might even say the indignation--of Mr Rushton, who did
not know enough about the work to make out estimates without
assistance.There were several large jobs to be tendered for at the
same time, so Rushton sent the specifications round to Hunter's house
for him to figure out the prices, and nearly all the time that Misery
was at home he was sitting up in bed, swathed in bandages, trying to
calculate the probable cost of these jobs.Rushton did not come to see
him, but he sent Bert nearly every day, either with some
specifications, or some accounts, or something of that sort, or with a
note inquiring when Hunter thought he would be able to return to work.All sorts of rumours became prevalent amongst the men concerning
Hunter's condition.He had 'broken his spiral column', he had
'conjunction of the brain', or he had injured his 'innards' and would
probably never be able to 'do no more slave-drivin''.Crass--who had
helped Mr Rushton to 'price up' several small jobs--began to think it
might not be altogether a bad thing for himself if something were to
happen to Hunter, and he began to put on side and to assume airs of
authority.He got one of the light-weights to assist him in his work
of colourman and made him do all the hard work, while he spent part of
his own time visiting the different jobs to see how the work progressed.He was wearing a pair of sporting
trousers the pattern of which consisted of large black and white
squares.The previous owner of these trousers was taller and slighter
than Crass, so although the legs were about a couple of inches too
long, they fitted him rather tightly, so much so that it was fortunate
that he had his present job of colourman, for if he had had to do any
climbing up and down ladders or steps, the trousers would have burst.His jacket was also two or three sizes too small, and the sleeves were
so short that the cuffs of his flanelette shirt were visible.This
coat was made of serge, and its colour had presumably once been blue,
but it was now a sort of heliotrope and violet: the greater part being
of the former tint, and the parts under the sleeves of the latter.This
jacket fitted very tightly across the shoulders and back and being much
too short left his tightly clad posteriors exposed to view.He however seemed quite unconscious of anything peculiar in his
appearance and was so bumptious and offensive that most of the men were
almost glad when Nimrod came back.They said that if Crass ever got
the job he would be a dam' sight worse than Hunter.As for the latter,
for a little while after his return to work it was said that his
illness had improved his character: he had had time to think things
over; and in short, he was ever so much better than before: but it was
not long before this story began to be told the other way round.and a thing that happened about a fortnight after
his return caused more ill feeling and resentment against him and
Rushton than had ever existed previously.What led up to it was
something that was done by Bundy's mate, Ted Dawson.This poor wretch was scarcely ever seen without a load of some sort or
other: carrying a sack of cement or plaster, a heavy ladder, a big
bucket of mortar, or dragging a load of scaffolding on a cart.He must
have been nearly as strong as a horse, because after working in this
manner for Rushton & Co.from six in the morning till half past five at
night, he usually went to work in his garden for two or three hours
after tea, and frequently went there for an hour or so in the morning
before going to work.The poor devil needed the produce of his garden
to supplement his wages, for he had a wife and three children to
provide for and he earned only--or rather, to be correct, he was paid
only--fourpence an hour.There was an old house to which they were making some alterations and
repairs, and there was a lot of old wood taken out of it: old, decayed
floorboards and stuff of that kind, wood that was of no use whatever
except to burn.Bundy and his mate were working there, and one night, Misery came a few
minutes before half past five and caught Dawson in the act of tying up
a small bundle of this wood.When Hunter asked him what he was going
to do with it he made no attempt at prevarication or concealment: he
said he was going to take it home for fire-wood, because it was of no
other use.Misery kicked up a devil of a row and ordered him to leave
the wood where it was: it had to be taken to the yard, and it was
nothing to do with Dawson or anyone else whether it was any use or not!If he caught anyone taking wood away he would sack them on the spot.Hunter shouted very loud so that all the others might hear, and as they
were all listening attentively in the next room, where they were taking
their aprons off preparatory to going home, they got the full benefit
of his remarks.The following Saturday when the hands went to the office for their
money they were each presented with a printed card bearing the
following legend:

    Under no circumstances is any article or material, however
    trifling, to be taken away by workmen for their private use,
    whether waste material or not, from any workshop or place where
    work is being done.Foremen are hereby instructed to see that
    this order is obeyed and to report any such act coming to their
    knowledge.Any man breaking this rule will be either dismissed
    without notice or given into custody.Most of the men took these cards with the envelopes containing their
wages and walked away without making any comment--in fact, most of them
were some distance away before they realized exactly what the card was
about.Two or three of them stood a few steps away from the pay window
in full view of Rushton and Misery and ostentatiously tore the thing
into pieces and threw them into the street.One man remained at the
pay window while he read the card--and then flung it with an obscene
curse into Rushton's face, and demanded his back day, which they gave
him without any remark or delay, the other men who were not yet paid
having to wait while he made out his time-sheet for that morning.The story of this card spread all over the place in a very short time.It became the talk of every shop in the town.Whenever any of
Rushton's men encountered the employees of another firm, the latter
used to shout after them--'However trifling!''Ere comes some of Rushton's pickpockets.'Amongst Rushton's men themselves it became a standing joke or form of
greeting to say when one met another--'Remember!If one of their number was seen going home with an unusual amount of
paint or whitewash on his hands or clothes, the others would threaten
to report him for stealing the material.They used to say that however
trifling the quantity, it was against orders to take it away.Harlow drew up a list of rules which he said Mr Rushton had instructed
him to communicate to the men.One of these rules provided that
everybody was to be weighed upon arrival at the job in the morning and
again at leaving-off time: any man found to have increased in weight
was to be discharged.There was also much cursing and covert resentment about it; the men
used to say that such a thing as that looked well coming from the likes
of Rushton and Hunter, and they used to remind each other of the affair
of the marble-topped console table, the barometer, the venetian blinds
and all the other robberies.None of them ever said anything to either Misery or Rushton about the
cards, but one morning when the latter was reading his letters at the
breakfast table, on opening one of them he found that it contained one
of the notices, smeared with human excrement.He did not eat any more
breakfast that morning.It was not to be much wondered at that none of them had the courage to
openly resent the conditions under which they had to work, for although
it was summer, there were many men out of employment, and it was much
easier to get the sack than it was to get another job.None of the men were ever caught stealing anything, however trifling,
but all the same during the course of the summer five or six of them
were captured by the police and sent to jail--for not being able to pay
their poor rates.All through the summer Owen continued to make himself objectionable and
to incur the ridicule of his fellow workmen by talking about the causes
of poverty and of ways to abolish it.Most of the men kept two shillings or half a crown of their wages back
from their wives for pocket money, which they spent on beer and
tobacco.There were a very few who spent a little more than this, and
there were a still smaller number who spent so much in this way that
their families had to suffer in consequence.Most of those who kept back half a crown or three shillings from their
wives did so on the understanding that they were to buy their clothing
out of it.Some of them had to pay a shilling a week to a tallyman or
credit clothier.These were the ones who indulged in shoddy new
suits--at long intervals.Others bought--or got their wives to buy for
them--their clothes at second-hand shops, 'paying off' about a shilling
or so a week and not receiving the things till they were paid for.There were a very large proportion of them who did not spend even a
shilling a week for drink: and there were numerous others who, while
not being formally total abstainers, yet often went for weeks together
without either entering a public house or tasting intoxicating drink in
any form.Then there were others who, instead of drinking tea or coffee or cocoa
with their dinners or suppers, drank beer.This did not cost more than
the teetotal drinks, but all the same there are some persons who say
that those who swell the 'Nation's Drink Bill' by drinking beer with
their dinners or suppers are a kind of criminal, and that they ought to
be compelled to drink something else: that is, if they are working
people.As for the idle classes, they of course are to be allowed to
continue to make merry, 'drinking whisky, wine and sherry', to say
nothing of having their beer in by the barrel and the dozen--or forty
dozen--bottles.But of course that's a different matter, because these
people make so much money out of the labour of the working classes that
they can afford to indulge in this way without depriving their children
of the necessaries of life.There is no more cowardly, dastardly slander than is contained in the
assertion that the majority or any considerable proportion of working
men neglect their families through drink.There
are some who do, but they are not even a large minority.They are few
and far between, and are regarded with contempt by their fellow workmen.It will be said that their families had to suffer for want of even the
little that most of them spent in that way: but the persons that use
this argument should carry it to its logical conclusion.Tea is an
unnecessary and harmful drink; it has been condemned by medical men so
often that to enumerate its evil qualities here would be waste of time.The same can be said of nearly all the cheap temperance drinks; they
are unnecessary and harmful and cost money, and, like beer, are drunk
only for pleasure.What right has anyone to say to working men that when their work is
done they should not find pleasure in drinking a glass or two of beer
together in a tavern or anywhere else?Let those who would presume to
condemn them carry their argument to its logical conclusion and condemn
pleasure of every kind.Let them persuade the working classes to lead
still simpler lives; to drink water instead of such unwholesome things
as tea, coffee, beer, lemonade and all the other harmful and
unnecessary stuff.They would then be able to live ever so much more
cheaply, and as wages are always and everywhere regulated by the cost
of living, they would be able to work for lower pay.These people are fond of quoting the figures of the 'Nation's Drink
Bill,' as if all this money were spent by the working classes!But if
the amount of money spent in drink by the 'aristocracy', the clergy and
the middle classes were deducted from the 'Nation's Drink Bill', it
would be seen that the amount spent per head by the working classes is
not so alarming after all; and would probably not be much larger than
the amount spent on drink by those who consume tea and coffee and all
the other unwholesome and unnecessary 'temperance' drinks.The fact that some of Rushton's men spent about two shillings a week on
drink while they were in employment was not the cause of their poverty.If they had never spent a farthing for drink, and if their wretched
wages had been increased fifty percent, they would still have been in a
condition of the most abject and miserable poverty, for nearly all the
benefits and privileges of civilization, nearly everything that makes
life worth living, would still have been beyond their reach.It is inevitable, so long as men have to live and work under such
heartbreaking, uninteresting conditions as at present that a certain
proportion of them will seek forgetfulness and momentary happiness in
the tavern, and the only remedy for this evil is to remove the cause;
and while that is in process, there is something else that can be done
and that is, instead of allowing filthy drinking dens, presided over by
persons whose interest it is to encourage men to drink more bad beer
than is good for them or than they can afford,--to have civilized
institutions run by the State or the municipalities for use and not
merely for profit.Decent pleasure houses, where no drunkenness or
filthiness would be tolerated--where one could buy real beer or coffee
or tea or any other refreshments; where men could repair when their
day's work was over and spend an hour or two in rational intercourse
with their fellows or listen to music and singing.Taverns to which
they could take their wives and children without fear of defilement,
for a place that is not fit for the presence of a woman or a child is
not fit to exist at all.Owen, being a teetotaller, did not spend any of his money on drink; but
he spent a lot on what he called 'The Cause'.Every week he bought
some penny or twopenny pamphlets or some leaflets about Socialism,
which he lent or gave to his mates; and in this way and by means of
much talk he succeeded in converting a few to his party.Philpot,
Harlow and a few others used to listen with interest, and some of them
even paid for the pamphlets they obtained from Owen, and after reading
them themselves, passed them on to others, and also occasionally 'got
up' arguments on their own accounts.Others were simply indifferent,
or treated the subject as a kind of joke, ridiculing the suggestion
that it was possible to abolish poverty.They repeated that there had
'always been rich and poor in the world and there always would be, so
there was an end of it'.But the majority were bitterly hostile; not
to Owen, but to Socialism.For the man himself most of them had a
certain amount of liking, especially the ordinary hands because it was
known that he was not a'master's man' and that he had declined to
'take charge' of jobs which Misery had offered to him.But to
Socialism they were savagely and malignantly opposed.Some of those
who had shown some symptoms of Socialism during the past winter when
they were starving had now quite recovered and were stout defenders of
the Present System.Barrington was still working for the firm and continued to maintain his
manner of reserve, seldom speaking unless addressed but all the same,
for several reasons, it began to be rumoured that he shared Owen's
views.He always paid for the pamphlets that Owen gave him, and on one
occasion, when Owen bought a thousand leaflets to give away, Barrington
contributed a shilling towards the half-crown that Owen paid for them.But he never took any part in the arguments that sometimes raged during
the dinner-hour or at breakfast-time.It was a good thing for Owen that he had his enthusiasm for 'the cause'
to occupy his mind.Socialism was to him what drink was to some of the
others--the thing that enable them to forget and tolerate the
conditions under which they were forced to exist.Some of them were so
muddled with beer, and others so besotted with admiration of their
Liberal and Tory masters, that they were oblivious of the misery of
their own lives, and in a similar way, Owen was so much occupied in
trying to rouse them from their lethargy and so engrossed in trying to
think out new arguments to convince them of the possibility of bringing
about an improvement in their condition that he had no time to dwell
upon his own poverty; the money that he spent on leaflets and pamphlets
to give away might have been better spent on food and clothing for
himself, because most of those to whom he gave them were by no means
grateful; but he never thought of that; and after all, nearly everyone
spends money on some hobby or other.Some people deny themselves the
necessaries or comforts of life in order that they may be able to help
to fatten a publican.Others deny themselves in order to enable a lazy
parson to live in idleness and luxury; and others spend much time and
money that they really need for themselves in buying Socialist
literature to give away to people who don't want to know about
Socialism.One Sunday morning towards the end of July, a band of about twenty-five
men and women on bicycles invaded the town.Two of them--who rode a
few yards in front of the others, had affixed to the handlebars of each
of their machines a slender, upright standard from the top of one of
which fluttered a small flag of crimson silk with 'International
Brotherhood and Peace' in gold letters.The other standard was similar
in size and colour, but with a different legend: 'One for all and All
for one.'As they rode along they gave leaflets to the people in the streets, and
whenever they came to a place where there were many people they
dismounted and walked about, giving their leaflets to whoever would
accept them.They made several long halts during their progress along
the Grand Parade, where there was a considerable crowd, and then they
rode over the hill to Windley, which they reached a little before
opening time.There were little crowds waiting outside the several
public houses and a number of people passing through the streets on
their way home from Church and Chapel.The strangers distributed
leaflets to all those who would take them, and they went through a lot
of the side streets, putting leaflets under the doors and in the
letter-boxes.When they had exhausted their stock they remounted and
rode back the way they came.Meantime the news of their arrival had spread, and as they returned
through the town they were greeted with jeers and booing.Presently
someone threw a stone, and as there happened to be plenty of stones
just there several others followed suit and began running after the
retreating cyclists, throwing stones, hooting and cursing.The leaflet which had given rise to all this fury read as follows:

                            WHAT IS SOCIALISM?At present the workers, with hand and brain produce continually
    food, clothing and all useful and beautiful things in great
    abundance.BUT THEY LABOUR IN VAIN--for they are mostly poor and often in
    want.Their women and
    children suffer, and their old age is branded with pauperism.Socialism is a plan by which poverty will be abolished, and
    everyone enabled to live in plenty and comfort, with leisure and
    opportunity for ampler life.If you wish to hear more of this plan, come to the field at the
    Cross Roads on the hill at Windley, on Tuesday evening next at 8
    P.M.and

                      LOOK OUT FOR THE SOCIALIST VAN

The cyclists rode away amid showers of stones without sustaining much
damage.One had his hand cut and another, who happened to look round,
was struck on the forehead, but these were the only casualties.On the following Tuesday evening, long before the appointed time, there
was a large crowd assembled at the cross roads or the hill at Windley,
waiting for the appearance of the van, and they were evidently prepared
to give the Socialists a warm reception.There was only one policeman
in uniform there but there were several in plain clothes amongst the
crowd.Crass, Dick Wantley, the Semi-drunk, Sawkins, Bill Bates and several
other frequenters of the Cricketers were amongst the crowd, and there
were also a sprinkling of tradespeople, including the Old Dear and Mr
Smallman, the grocer, and a few ladies and gentlemen--wealthy
visitors--but the bulk of the crowd were working men, labourers,
mechanics and boys.As it was quite evident that the crowd meant mischief--many of them had
their pockets filled with stones and were armed with sticks--several of
the Socialists were in favour of going to meet the van to endeavour to
persuade those in charge from coming, and with that object they
withdrew from the crowd, which was already regarding them with menacing
looks, and went down the road in the direction from which the van was
expected to come.They had not gone very far, however, before the
people, divining what they were going to do, began to follow them and
while they were hesitating what course to pursue, the Socialist van,
escorted by five or six men on bicycles, appeared round the corner at
the bottom of the hill.As soon as the crowd saw it, they gave an exultant cheer, or, rather,
yell, and began running down the hill to meet it, and in a few minutes
it was surrounded by a howling mob.The van was drawn by two horses;
there was a door and a small platform at the back and over this was a
sign with white letters on a red ground: 'Socialism, the only hope of
the Workers.'The driver pulled up, and another man on the platform at the rear
attempted to address the crowd, but his voice was inaudible in the din
of howls, catcalls, hooting and obscene curses.After about an hour of
this, as the crowd began pushing against the van and trying to overturn
it, the terrified horses commenced to get restive and uncontrollable,
and the man on the box attempted to drive up the hill.This seemed to
still further infuriate the horde of savages who surrounded the van.Numbers of them clutched the wheels and turned them the reverse way,
screaming that it must go back to where it came from; several of them
accordingly seized the horses' heads and, amid cheers, turned them
round.The man on the platform was still trying to make himself heard, but
without success.The strangers who had come with the van and the
little group of local Socialists, who had forced their way through the
crowd and gathered together close to the platform in front of the
would-be speaker, only increased the din by their shouts of appeal to
the crowd to 'give the man a fair chance'.This little bodyguard
closed round the van as it began to move slowly downhill, but they were
not sufficiently numerous to protect it from the crowd, which, not
being satisfied with the rate at which the van was proceeding, began to
shout to each other to 'Run it away!'and several
savage rushes were made with the intention of putting these suggestions
into execution.Some of the defenders were hampered with their bicycles, but they
resisted as well as they were able, and succeeded in keeping the crowd
off until the foot of the hill was reached, and then someone threw the
first stone, which by a strange chance happened to strike one of the
cyclists whose head was already bandaged--it was the same man who had
been hit on the Sunday.This stone was soon followed by others, and
the man on the platform was the next to be struck.He got it right on
the mouth, and as he put up his handkerchief to staunch the blood
another struck him on the forehead just above the temple, and he
dropped forward on his face on to the platform as if he had been shot.As the speed of the vehicle increased, a regular hail of stones fell
upon the roof and against the sides of the van and whizzed past the
retreating cyclists, while the crowd followed close behind, cheering,
shrieking out volleys of obscene curses, and howling like wolves.'We'll give the b--rs Socialism!'shouted Crass, who was literally
foaming at the mouth.'We'll teach 'em to come 'ere trying to undermined our bloody
morality,' howled Dick Wantley as he hurled a lump of granite that he
had torn up from the macadamized road at one of the cyclists.They ran on after the van until it was out of range, and then they
bethought themselves of the local Socialists; but they were nowhere to
be seen; they had prudently withdrawn as soon as the van had got fairly
under way, and the victory being complete, the upholders of the present
system returned to the piece of waste ground on the top of the hill,
where a gentleman in a silk hat and frockcoat stood up on a little
hillock and made a speech.He said nothing about the Distress
Committee or the Soup Kitchen or the children who went to school
without proper clothes or food, and made no reference to what was to be
done next winter, when nearly everybody would be out of work.These
were matters he and they were evidently not at all interested in.But
he said a good deal about the Glorious Empire!The things he said were received with rapturous
applause, and at the conclusion of his address, the crowd sang the
National Anthem with great enthusiasm and dispersed, congratulating
themselves that they had shown to the best of their ability what
Mugsborough thought of Socialism and the general opinion of the crowd
was that they would hear nothing more from the Socialist van.But in this they were mistaken, for the very next Sunday evening a
crowd of Socialists suddenly materialized at the Cross Roads.Some of
them had come by train, others had walked from different places and
some had cycled.A crowd gathered and the Socialists held a meeting, two speeches being
delivered before the crowd recovered from their surprise at the
temerity of these other Britishers who apparently had not sense enough
to understand that they had been finally defeated and obliterated last
Tuesday evening: and when the cyclist with the bandaged head got up on
the hillock some of the crowd actually joined in the hand-clapping with
which the Socialists greeted him.In the course of his speech he informed them that the man who had come
with the van and who had been felled whilst attempting to speak from
the platform was now in hospital.For some time it had been probable
that he would not recover, but he was now out of danger, and as soon as
he was well enough there was no doubt that he would come there again.Upon this Crass shouted out that if ever the Vanners did return, they
would finish what they had begun last Tuesday.He would not get off so
easy next time.But when he said this, Crass--not being able to see
into the future--did not know what the reader will learn in due time,
that the man was to return to that place under different circumstances.When they had finished their speech-making one of the strangers who was
acting as chairman invited the audience to put questions, but as nobody
wanted to ask any, he invited anyone who disagreed with what had been
said to get up on the hillock and state his objections, so that the
audience might have an opportunity of judging for themselves which side
was right; but this invitation was also neglected.Then the chairman
announced that they were coming there again next Sunday at the same
time, when a comrade would speak on 'Unemployment and Poverty, the
Cause and the Remedy', and then the strangers sang a song called
'England Arise', the first verse being:

        England Arise, the long, long night is over,
        Faint in the east, behold the Dawn appear
        Out of your evil dream of toil and sorrow
        Arise, O England!During the progress of the meeting several of the strangers had been
going out amongst the crowd giving away leaflets, which many of the
people gloomily refused to accept, and selling penny pamphlets, of
which they managed to dispose of about three dozen.Before declaring the meeting closed, the chairman said that the speaker
who was coming next week resided in London: he was not a millionaire,
but a workman, the same as nearly all those who were there present.They were not going to pay him anything for coming, but they intended
to pay his railway fare.Therefore next Sunday after the meeting there
would be a collection, and anything over the amount of the fare would
be used for the purchase of more leaflets such as those they were now
giving away.He hoped that anyone who thought that any of the money
went into the pockets of those who held the meeting would come and
join: then they could have their share.The meeting now terminated and the Socialists were suffered to depart
in peace.Some of them, however, lingered amongst the crowd after the
main body had departed, and for a long time after the meeting was over
little groups remained on the field excitedly discussing the speeches
or the leaflets.The next Sunday evening when the Socialists came they found the field
at the Cross Roads in the possession of a furious, hostile mob, who
refused to allow them to speak, and finally they had to go away without
having held a meeting.They came again the next Sunday, and on this
occasion they had a speaker with a very loud--literally a
stentorian--voice, and he succeeded in delivering an address, but as
only those who were very close were able to hear him, and as they were
all Socialists, it was not of much effect upon those for whom it was
intended.They came again the next Sunday and nearly every other Sunday during
the summer: sometimes they were permitted to hold their meeting in
comparative peace and at other times there was a row.They made
several converts, and many people declared themselves in favour of some
of the things advocated, but they were never able to form a branch of
their society there, because nearly all those who were convinced were
afraid to publicly declare themselves lest they should lose their
employment or customers.Chapter 44

The Beano


Now and then a transient gleam of sunshine penetrated the gloom in
which the lives of the philanthropists were passed.The cheerless
monotony was sometimes enlivened with a little innocent merriment.Every now and then there was a funeral which took Misery and Crass away
for the whole afternoon, and although they always tried to keep the
dates secret, the men generally knew when they were gone.Sometimes the people in whose houses they were working regaled them
with tea, bread and butter, cake or other light refreshments, and
occasionally even with beer--very different stuff from the petrifying
liquid they bought at the Cricketers for twopence a pint.At other
places, where the people of the house were not so generously disposed,
the servants made up for it, and entertained them in a similar manner
without the knowledge of their masters and mistresses.Even when the
mistresses were too cunning to permit of this, they were seldom able to
prevent the men from embracing the domestics, who for their part were
quite often willing to be embraced; it was an agreeable episode that
helped to vary the monotony of their lives, and there was no harm done.It was rather hard lines on the philanthropists sometimes when they
happened to be working in inhabited houses of the better sort.They
always had to go in and out by the back way, generally through the
kitchen, and the crackling and hissing of the poultry and the joints of
meat roasting in the ovens, and the odours of fruit pies and tarts, and
plum puddings and sage and onions, were simply maddening.In the
back-yards of these houses there were usually huge stacks of empty
beer, stout and wine bottles, and others that had contained whisky,
brandy or champagne.The smells of the delicious viands that were being prepared in the
kitchen often penetrated into the dismantled rooms that the
philanthropists were renovating, sometimes just as they were eating
their own wretched fare out of their dinner basket, and washing it down
with draughts of the cold tea or the petrifying liquid they sometimes
brought with them in bottles.Sometimes, as has been said, the people of the house used to send up
some tea and bread and butter or cakes or other refreshments to the
workmen, but whenever Hunter got to know of it being done he used to
speak to the people about it and request that it be discontinued, as it
caused the men to waste their time.But the event of the year was the Beano, which took place on the last
Saturday in August, after they had been paying in for about four
months.The cost of the outing was to be five shillings a head, so
this was the amount each man had to pay in, but it was expected that
the total cost--the hire of the brakes and the cost of the
dinner--would come out at a trifle less than the amount stated, and in
that case the surplus would be shared out after the dinner.The amount
of the share-out would be greater or less according to other
circumstances, for it generally happened that apart from the
subscriptions of the men, the Beano fund was swelled by charitable
donations from several quarters, as will be seen later on.When the eventful day arrived, the hands, instead of working till one,
were paid at twelve o'clock and rushed off home to have a wash and
change.The brakes were to start from the 'Cricketers' at one, but it was
arranged, for the convenience of those who lived at Windley, that they
were to be picked up at the Cross Roads at one-thirty.There were four brakes altogether--three large ones for the men and one
small one for the accommodation of Mr Rushton and a few of his personal
friends, Didlum, Grinder, Mr Toonarf, an architect and Mr Lettum, a
house and estate Agent.One of the drivers was accompanied by a friend
who carried a long coachman's horn.This gentleman was not paid to
come, but, being out of work, he thought that the men would be sure to
stand him a few drinks and that they would probably make a collection
for him in return for his services.Most of the chaps were smoking twopenny cigars, and had one or two
drinks with each other to try to cheer themselves up before they
started, but all the same it was a melancholy procession that wended
its way up the hill to Windley.To judge from the mournful expression
on the long face of Misery, who sat on the box beside the driver of the
first large brake, and the downcast appearance of the majority of the
men, one might have thought that it was a funeral rather than a
pleasure party, or that they were a contingent of lost souls being
conducted to the banks of the Styx.The man who from time to time
sounded the coachman's horn might have passed as the angel sounding the
last trump, and the fumes of the cigars were typical of the smoke of
their torment, which ascendeth up for ever and ever.A brief halt was made at the Cross Roads to pick up several of the men,
including Philpot, Harlow, Easton, Ned Dawson, Sawkins, Bill Bates and
the Semi-drunk.The two last-named were now working for Smeariton and
Leavit, but as they had been paying in from the first, they had elected
to go to the Beano rather than have their money back.The Semi-drunk
and one or two other habitual boozers were very shabby and down at
heel, but the majority of the men were decently dressed.Some had taken
their Sunday clothes out of pawn especially for the occasion.Others
were arrayed in new suits which they were going to pay for at the rate
of a shilling a week.Some had bought themselves second-hand suits,
one or two were wearing their working clothes brushed and cleaned up,
and some were wearing Sunday clothes that had not been taken out of
pawn for the simple reason that the pawnbrokers would not take them in.These garments were in what might be called a transition
stage--old-fashioned and shiny with wear, but yet too good to take for
working in, even if their owners had been in a position to buy some
others to take their place for best.Crass, Slyme and one or two of
the single men, however, were howling swells, sporting stand-up collars
and bowler hats of the latest type, in contradistinction to some of the
others, who were wearing hats of antique patterns, and collars of
various shapes with jagged edges.Harlow had on an old straw hat that
his wife had cleaned up with oxalic acid, and Easton had carefully dyed
the faded binding of his black bowler with ink.Their boots were the
worst part of their attire: without counting Rushton and his friends,
there were thirty-seven men altogether, including Nimrod, and there
were not half a dozen pairs of really good boots amongst the whole
crowd.When all were seated a fresh start was made.The small brake, with
Rushton, Didlum, Grinder and two or three other members of the Band,
led the way.Next came the largest brake with Misery on the box.Beside the driver of the third brake was Payne, the foreman carpenter.Crass occupied a similar position of honour on the fourth brake, on the
back step of which was perched the man with the coachman's horn.Crass--who had engaged the brakes--had arranged with the drivers that
the cortege should pass through the street where he and Easton lived,
and as they went by Mrs Crass was standing at the door with the two
young men lodgers, who waved their handkerchiefs and shouted greetings.A little further on Mrs Linden and Easton's wife were standing at the
door to see them go by.In fact, the notes of the coachman's horn
alarmed most of the inhabitants, who crowded to their windows and doors
to gaze upon the dismal procession as it passed.The mean streets of Windley were soon left far behind and they found
themselves journeying along a sunlit, winding road, bordered with
hedges of hawthorn, holly and briar, past rich, brown fields of
standing corn, shimmering with gleams of gold, past apple-orchards
where bending boughs were heavily loaded with mellow fruits exhaling
fragrant odours, through the cool shades of lofty avenues of venerable
oaks, whose overarched and interlacing branches formed a roof of green,
gilt and illuminated with quivering spots and shafts of sunlight that
filtered through the trembling leaves; over old mossy stone bridges,
spanning limpid streams that duplicated the blue sky and the fleecy
clouds; and then again, stretching away to the horizon on every side
over more fields, some rich with harvest, others filled with drowsing
cattle or with flocks of timid sheep that scampered away at the sound
of the passing carriages.Several times they saw merry little
companies of rabbits frisking gaily in and out of the hedges or in the
fields beside the sheep and cattle.At intervals, away in the
distance, nestling in the hollows or amid sheltering trees, groups of
farm buildings and stacks of hay; and further on, the square ivy-clad
tower of an ancient church, or perhaps a solitary windmill with its
revolving sails alternately flashing and darkening in the rays of the
sun.Past thatched wayside cottages whose inhabitants came out to wave
their hands in friendly greeting.Past groups of sunburnt,
golden-haired children who climbed on fences and five-barred gates, and
waved their hats and cheered, or ran behind the brakes for the pennies
the men threw down to them.From time to time the men in the brakes made half-hearted attempts at
singing, but it never came to much, because most of them were too
hungry and miserable.They had not had time to take any dinner and
would not have taken any even if they had the time, for they wished to
reserve their appetites for the banquet at the Queen Elizabeth, which
they expected to reach about half past three.However, they cheered up
a little after the first halt--at the Blue Lion, where most of them got
down and had a drink.Some of them, including the Semi-drunk, Ned
Dawson, Bill Bates and Joe Philpot--had two or three drinks, and felt
so much happier for them that, shortly after they started off again,
sounds of melody were heard from the brake the three first named rode
in--the one presided over by Crass--but it was not very successful, and
even after the second halt--about five miles further on--at the
Warrior's Head, they found it impossible to sing with any heartiness.Fitful bursts of song arose from time to time from each of the brakes
in turn, only to die mournfully away.It is not easy to sing on an
empty stomach even if one has got a little beer in it; and so it was
with most of them.They were not in a mood to sing, or to properly
appreciate the scenes through which they were passing.They wanted
their dinners, and that was the reason why this long ride, instead of
being a pleasure, became after a while, a weary journey that seemed as
if it were never coming to an end.The next stop was at the Bird in Hand, a wayside public house that
stood all by itself in a lonely hollow.The landlord was a fat,
jolly-looking man, and there were several customers in the bar--men who
looked like farm-labourers, but there were no other houses to be seen
anywhere.This extraordinary circumstance exercised the minds of our
travellers and formed the principal topic of conversation until they
arrived at the Dew Drop Inn, about half an hour afterwards.The first
brake, containing Rushton and his friends, passed on without stopping
here.The occupants of the second brake, which was only a little way
behind the first, were divided in opinion whether to stop or go on.Some shouted out to the driver to pull up, others ordered him to
proceed, and more were undecided which course to pursue--a state of
mind that was not shared by the coachman, who, knowing that if they
stopped somebody or other would be sure to stand him a drink, had no
difficulty whatever in coming to a decision, but drew rein at the inn,
an example that was followed by both the other carriages as they drove
up.It was a very brief halt, not more than half the men getting down at
all, and those who remained in the brakes grumbled so much at the delay
that the others drank their beer as quickly as possible and the journey
was resumed once more, almost in silence.No attempts at singing, no
noisy laughter; they scarcely spoke to each other, but sat gloomily
gazing out over the surrounding country.Instructions had been given to the drivers not to stop again till they
reached the Queen Elizabeth, and they therefore drove past the World
Turned Upside Down without stopping, much to the chagrin of the
landlord of that house, who stood at the door with a sickly smile upon
his face.Some of those who knew him shouted out that they would give
him a call on their way back, and with this he had to be content.They reached the long-desired Queen Elizabeth at twenty minutes to
four, and were immediately ushered into a large room where a round
table and two long ones were set for dinner--and they were set in a
manner worthy of the reputation of the house.The cloths that covered the tables and the serviettes, arranged fanwise
in the drinking glasses, were literally as white as snow, and about a
dozen knives and forks and spoons were laid for each person.Down the
centre of the table glasses of delicious yellow custard and cut-glass
dishes of glistening red and golden jelly alternated with vases of
sweet-smelling flowers.The floor of the dining-room was covered with oilcloth--red flowers on
a pale yellow ground; the pattern was worn off in places, but it was
all very clean and shining.Whether one looked at the walls with the
old-fashioned varnished oak paper, or at the glossy piano standing
across the corner near the white-curtained window, at the shining oak
chairs or through the open casement doors that led into the shady
garden beyond, the dominating impression one received was that
everything was exquisitely clean.The landlord announced that dinner would be served in ten minutes, and
while they were waiting some of them indulged in a drink at the
bar--just as an appetizer--whilst the others strolled in the garden or,
by the landlord's invitation, looked over the house.Amongst other
places, they glanced into the kitchen, where the landlady was
superintending the preparation of the feast, and in this place, with
its whitewashed walls and red-tiled floor, as in every other part of
the house, the same absolute cleanliness reigned supreme.'It's a bit differint from the Royal Caff, where we got the sack, ain't
it?'remarked the Semi-drunk to Bill Bates as they made their way to
the dining-room in response to the announcement that dinner was ready.Rushton, with Didlum and Grinder and his other friends, sat at the
round table near the piano.Hunter took the head of the longer of the
other two tables and Crass the foot, and on either side of Crass were
Bundy and Slyme, who had acted with him as the Committee who had
arranged the Beano.Payne, the foreman carpenter, occupied the head of
the other table.The dinner was all that could be desired; it was almost as good as the
kind of dinner that is enjoyed every day by those persons who are too
lazy to work but are cunning enough to make others work for them.There was soup, several entrees, roast beef, boiled mutton, roast
turkey, roast goose, ham, cabbage, peas, beans and sweets galore, plum
pudding, custard, jelly, fruit tarts, bread and cheese and as much beer
or lemonade as they liked to pay for, the drinks being an extra; and
afterwards the waiters brought in cups of coffee for those who desired
it.Everything was up to the knocker, and although they were somewhat
bewildered by the multitude of knives and forks, they all, with one or
two exceptions, rose to the occasion and enjoyed themselves famously.The excellent decorum observed being marred only by one or two
regrettable incidents.The first of these occurred almost as soon as
they sat down, when Ned Dawson who, although a big strong fellow, was
not able to stand much beer, not being used to it, was taken ill and
had to be escorted from the room by his mate Bundy and another man.They left him somewhere outside and he came back again about ten
minutes afterwards, much better but looking rather pale, and took his
seat with the others.The turkeys, the roast beef and the boiled mutton, the peas and beans
and the cabbage, disappeared with astonishing rapidity, which was not
to be wondered at, for they were all very hungry from the long drive,
and nearly everyone made a point of having at least one helping of
everything there was to be had.Some of them went in for two lots of
soup.Then for the next course, boiled mutton and ham or turkey: then
some roast beef and goose.Then a little more boiled mutton with a
little roast beef.Each of the three boys devoured several times his
own weight of everything, to say nothing of numerous bottles of
lemonade and champagne ginger beer.Crass frequently paused to mop the perspiration from his face and neck
with his serviette.There was
enough and to spare of everything to eat, the beer was of the best, and
all the time, amid the rattle of the crockery and the knives and forks,
the proceedings were enlivened by many jests and flashes of wit that
continuously kept the table in a roar.'Chuck us over another dollop of that there white stuff, Bob,' shouted
the Semi-drunk to Crass, indicating the blancmange.Crass reached out his hand and took hold of the dish containing the
'white stuff', but instead of passing it to the Semi-drunk, he
proceeded to demolish it himself, gobbling it up quickly directly from
the dish with a spoon.'Why, you're eating it all yerself, yer bleeder,' cried the Semi-drunk
indignantly, as soon as he realized what was happening.'That's all right, matey,' replied Crass affably as he deposited the
empty dish on the table.'It don't matter, there's plenty more where
it come from.Upon being applied to, the landlord, who was assisted by his daughter,
two other young women and two young men, brought in several more lots
and so the Semi-drunk was appeased.As for the plum-pudding--it was a fair knock-out; just like Christmas:
but as Ned Dawson and Bill Bates had drunk all the sauce before the
pudding was served, they all had to have their first helping without
any.However, as the landlord brought in another lot shortly
afterwards, that didn't matter either.As soon as dinner was over, Crass rose to make his statement as
secretary.Thirty-seven men had paid five shillings each: that made
nine pounds five shillings.The committee had decided that the three
boys--the painters' boy, the carpenters' boy and the front shop
boy--should be allowed to come half-price: that made it nine pounds
twelve and six.In addition to paying the ordinary five-shilling
subscription, Mr Rushton had given one pound ten towards the expenses.And several other gentlemen had also given something
towards it.Mr Sweater, of the Cave, one pound.Mr
Grinder, ten shillings in addition to the five-shilling subscription.Mr Lettum, ten shillings, as well as the five-shilling
subscription.Mr Didlum, ten shillings in addition to the
five shillings.Mr Toonarf, ten shillings as well as the
five-shilling subscription.They had also written to some of the
manufacturers who supplied the firm with materials, and asked them to
give something: some of 'em had sent half a crown, some five shillings,
some hadn't answered at all, and two of 'em had written back to say
that as things is cut so fine nowadays, they didn't hardly get no
profit on their stuff, so they couldn't afford to give nothing; but out
of all the firms they wrote to they managed to get thirty-two and
sixpence altogether, making a grand total of seventeen pounds.As for the expenses, the dinner was two and six a head, and there was
forty-five of them there, so that came to five pounds twelve and six.Then there was the hire of the brakes, also two and six a head, five
pound twelve and six, which left a surplus of five pound fifteen to be
shared out (applause), which came to three shillings each for the
thirty-seven men, and one and fourpence for each of the boys.Crass, Slyme and Bundy now walked round the tables distributing the
share-out, which was very welcome to everybody, especially those who
had spent nearly all their money during the journey from Mugsborough,
and when this ceremony was completed, Philpot moved a hearty vote of
thanks to the committee for the manner in which they had carried out
their duties, which was agreed to with acclamation.Then they made a
collection for the waiters, and the three waitresses, which amounted to
eleven shillings, for which the host returned thanks on behalf of the
recipients, who were all smiles.Then Mr Rushton requested the landlord to serve drinks and cigars all
round.Some had cigarettes and the teetotallers had lemonade or ginger
beer.Those who did not smoke themselves took the cigar all the same
and gave it to someone else who did.When all were supplied there
suddenly arose loud cries of 'Order!'and it was seen that Hunter was
upon his feet.As soon as silence was obtained, Misery said that he believed that
everyone there present would agree with him, when he said that they
should not let the occasion pass without drinking the 'ealth of their
esteemed and respected employer, Mr Rushton.Some of
them had worked for Mr Rushton on and off for many years, and as far as
THEY was concerned it was not necessary for him (Hunter) to say much in
praise of Mr Rushton.They knew Mr Rushton as well as
he did himself and to know him was to esteem him.As for the
new hands, although they did not know Mr Rushton as well as the old
hands did, he felt sure that they would agree that as no one could wish
for a better master.He had much pleasure in asking
them to drink Mr Rushton's health.'Musical honours, chaps,' shouted Crass, waving his glass and leading
off the singing which was immediately joined in with great enthusiasm
by most of the men, the Semi-drunk conducting the music with a table
knife:

        For he's a jolly good fellow,
        For he's a jolly good fellow,
        For he's a jolly good fel-ell-O,
        And so say all of us,
        So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!For he's a jolly good fellow,
        For 'e's a jolly good fellow
        For 'e's a jolly good fel-ell-O,
        And so say all of us.Hip, hip, hip, hooray!Hip, hip, hip, hooray!Hip, hip, hip, hooray!Everyone present drank Rushton's health, or at any rate went through
the motions of doing so, but during the roar of cheering and singing
that preceded it several of the men stood with expressions of contempt
or uneasiness upon their faces, silently watching the enthusiasts or
looking at the ceiling or on the floor.'I will say this much,' remarked the Semidrunk as they all resumed
their seats--he had had several drinks during dinner, besides those he
had taken on the journey--I will say this much, although I did have a
little misunderstanding with Mr Hunter when I was workin' at the Royal
Caff, I must admit that this is the best firm that's ever worked under
me.'This statement caused a shout of laughter, which, however, died away as
Mr Rushton rose to acknowledge the toast to his health.He said that
he had now been in business for nearly sixteen years and this was--he
believed--the eleventh outing he had had the pleasure of attending.During all that time the business had steadily progressed and had
increased in volume from year to year, and he hoped and believed that
the progress made in the past would be continued in the future.Of course, he realized that the success of the business
depended very largely upon the men as well as upon himself; he did his
best in trying to get work for them, and it was necessary--if the
business was to go on and prosper--that they should also do their best
to get the work done when he had secured it for them.The masters could not do without the men, and the men could not live
without the masters.It was a matter of division of
labour: the men worked with their hands and the masters worked with
their brains, and one was no use without the other.He hoped the good
feeling which had hitherto existed between himself and his workmen
would always continue, and he thanked them for the way in which they
had responded to the toast of his health.Loud cheers greeted the conclusion of this speech, and then Crass stood
up and said that he begged to propose the health of Mr 'Unter.He wasn't going to make a long speech as he wasn't much of a
speaker.(Cries of 'You're all right,' 'Go on,' etc.)But he felt
sure as they would all hagree with him when he said that--next to Mr
Rushton--there wasn't no one the men had more respect and liking for
than Mr 'Unter.A few weeks ago when Mr 'Unter was laid up,
many of them began to be afraid as they was going to lose 'im.He was
sure that all the 'ands was glad to 'ave this hoppertunity of
congratulating him on his recovery (Hear, hear) and of wishing him the
best of 'ealth in the future and hoping as he would be spared to come
to a good many more Beanos.Loud applause greeted the conclusion of Crass's remarks, and once more
the meeting burst into song:

        For he's a jolly good fellow
        For he's a jolly good fellow.For he's a jolly good fellow,
        And so say all of us.So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!When they had done cheering, Nimrod rose.His voice trembled a little
as he thanked them for their kindness, and said that he hoped he
deserved their goodwill.He could only say that as he was sure as he
always tried to be fair and considerate to everyone.He
would now request the landlord to replenish their glasses.As soon as the drinks were served, Nimrod again rose and said he wished
to propose the healths of their visitors who had so kindly contributed
to their expenses--Mr Lettum, Mr Didlum, Mr Toonarf and Mr Grinder.They were very pleased and proud to see them there (Hear,
hear), and he was sure the men would agree with him when he said that
Messrs Lettum, Didlum, Toonarf and Grinder were jolly good fellows.To judge from the manner in which they sang the chorus and cheered, it
was quite evident that most of the hands did agree.When they left
off, Grinder rose to reply on behalf of those included in the toast.He
said that it gave them much pleasure to be there and take part in such
pleasant proceedings and they were glad to think that they had been
able to help to bring it about.It was very gratifying to see the good
feeling that existed between Mr Rushton and his workmen, which was as
it should be, because masters and men was really fellow workers--the
masters did the brain work, the men the 'and work.They was both
workers, and their interests was the same.He liked to see men doing
their best for their master and knowing that their master was doing his
best for them, that he was not only a master, but a friend.That was
what he (Grinder) liked to see--master and men pulling together--doing
their best, and realizing that their interests was identical.If only all masters and men would do this they would find
that everything would go on all right, there would be more work and
less poverty.Let the men do their best for their masters, and the
masters do their best for their men, and they would find that that was
the true solution of the social problem, and not the silly nonsense
that was talked by people what went about with red flags.Most of those fellows were chaps who was too lazy to work
for their livin'.They could take it from him that, if
ever the Socialists got the upper hand there would just be a few of the
hartful dodgers who would get all the cream, and there would be nothing
left but 'ard work for the rest.That's wot hall those
hagitators was after: they wanted them (his hearers) to work and keep
'em in idleness.On behalf of Mr Didlum, Mr Toonarf, Mr
Lettum and himself, he thanked them for their good wishes, and hoped to
be with them on a sim'ler occasion in the future.Loud cheers greeted the termination of his speech, but it was obvious
from some of the men's faces that they resented Grinder's remarks.These men ridiculed Socialism and regularly voted for the continuance
of capitalism, and yet they were disgusted and angry with Grinder!There was also a small number of Socialists--not more than half a dozen
altogether--who did not join in the applause.These men were all
sitting at the end of the long table presided over by Payne.None of
them had joined in the applause that greeted the speeches, and so far
neither had they made any protest.Some of them turned very red as
they listened to the concluding sentences of Grinder's oration, and
others laughed, but none of them said anything.They knew before they
came that there was sure to be a lot of 'Jolly good fellow' business
and speechmaking, and they had agreed together beforehand to take no
part one way or the other, and to refrain from openly dissenting from
anything that might be said, but they had not anticipated anything
quite so strong as this.When Grinder sat down some of those who had applauded him began to jeer
at the Socialists.'What have you got to say to that?''They ain't got nothing to say now.''Why don't some of you get up and make a speech?'This last appeared to be a very good idea to those Liberals and Tories
who had not liked Grinder's observations, so they all began to shout
'Owen!'Several of those who had been loudest in applauding Grinder
also joined in the demand that Owen should make a speech, because they
were certain that Grinder and the other gentlemen would be able to
dispose of all his arguments; but Owen and the other Socialists made no
response except to laugh, so presently Crass tied a white handkerchief
on a cane walking-stick that belonged to Mr Didlum, and stuck it in the
vase of flowers that stood on the end of the table where the Socialist
group were sitting.When the noise had in some measure ceased, Grinder again rose.'When I
made the few remarks that I did, I didn't know as there was any
Socialists 'ere: I could tell from the look of you that most of you had
more sense.At the same time I'm rather glad I said what I did,
because it just shows you what sort of chaps these Socialists are.They're pretty artful--they know when to talk and when to keep their
mouths shut.What they like is to get hold of a few ignorant workin'
men in a workshop or a public house, and then they can talk by the
mile--reg'ler shop lawyers, you know wot I mean--I'm right and
everybody else is wrong.You know the sort of thing I
mean.When they finds theirselves in the company of edicated people
wot knows a little more than they does theirselves, and who isn't
likely to be misled by a lot of claptrap, why then, mum's the word.So
next time you hears any of these shop lawyers' arguments, you'll know
how much it's worth.'Most of the men were delighted with this speech, which was received
with much laughing and knocking on the tables.They remarked to each
other that Grinder was a smart man: he'd got the Socialists weighed up
just about right--to an ounce.Then, it was seen that Barrington was on his feet facing Grinder and a
sudden, awe-filled silence fell.'It may or may not be true,' began Barrington, 'that Socialists always
know when to speak and when to keep silent, but the present occasion
hardly seemed a suitable one to discuss such subjects.'We are here today as friends and want to forget our differences and
enjoy ourselves for a few hours.But after what Mr Grinder has said I
am quite ready to reply to him to the best of my ability.'The fact that I am a Socialist and that I am here today as one of Mr
Rushton's employees should be an answer to the charge that Socialists
are too lazy to work for their living.And as to taking advantage of
the ignorance and simplicity of working men and trying to mislead them
with nonsensical claptrap, it would have been more to the point if Mr
Grinder had taken some particular Socialist doctrine and had proved it
to be untrue or misleading, instead of adopting the cowardly method of
making vague general charges that he cannot substantiate.He would
find it far more difficult to do that than it would be for a Socialist
to show that most of what Mr Grinder himself has been telling us is
nonsensical claptrap of the most misleading kind.He tells us that the
employers work with their brains and the men with their hands.If it
is true that no brains are required to do manual labour, why put idiots
into imbecile asylums?Why not let them do some of the hand work for
which no brains are required?As they are idiots, they would probably
be willing to work for even less than the ideal "living wage".If Mr
Grinder had ever tried, he would know that manual workers have to
concentrate their minds and their attention on their work or they would
not be able to do it at all.His talk about employers being not only
the masters but the "friends" of their workmen is also mere claptrap
because he knows as well as we do, that no matter how good or
benevolent an employer may be, no matter how much he might desire to
give his men good conditions, it is impossible for him to do so,
because he has to compete against other employers who do not do that.It is the bad employer--the sweating, slave-driving employer--who sets
the pace and the others have to adopt the same methods--very often
against their inclinations--or they would not be able to compete with
him.If any employer today were to resolve to pay his workmen not less
wages than he would be able to live upon in comfort himself, that he
would not require them to do more work in a day than he himself would
like to perform every day of his own life, Mr Grinder knows as well as
we do that such an employer would be bankrupt in a month; because he
would not be able to get any work except by taking it at the same price
as the sweaters and the slave-drivers.'He also tells us that the interests of masters and men are identical;
but if an employer has a contract, it is to his interest to get the
work done as soon as possible; the sooner it is done the more profit he
will make; but the more quickly it is done, the sooner will the men be
out of employment.How then can it be true that their interests are
identical?'Again, let us suppose that an employer is, say, thirty years of age
when he commences business, and that he carries it on for twenty years.Let us assume that he employs forty men more or less regularly during
that period and that the average age of these men is also thirty years
at the time the employer commences business.At the end of the twenty
years it usually happens that the employer has made enough money to
enable him to live for the remainder of his life in ease and comfort.All through those twenty years they have
earned but a bare living wage and have had to endure such privations
that those who are not already dead are broken in health.'In the case of the employer there had been twenty years of steady
progress towards ease and leisure and independence.In the case of the
majority of the men there were twenty years of deterioration, twenty
years of steady, continuous and hopeless progress towards physical and
mental inefficiency: towards the scrap-heap, the work-house, and
premature death.What is it but false, misleading, nonsensical
claptrap to say that their interests were identical with those of their
employer?'Such talk as that is not likely to deceive any but children or fools.We are not children, but it is very evident that Mr Grinder thinks that
we are fools.'Occasionally it happens, through one or more of a hundred different
circumstances over which he has no control, or through some error of
judgement, that after many years of laborious mental work an employer
is overtaken by misfortune, and finds himself no better and even worse
off than when he started; but these are exceptional cases, and even if
he becomes absolutely bankrupt he is no worse off than the majority of
the workmen.'At the same time it is quite true that the real interests of employers
and workmen are the same, but not in the sense that Mr Grinder would
have us believe.Under the existing system of society but a very few
people, no matter how well off they may be, can be certain that they or
their children will not eventually come to want; and even those who
think they are secure themselves, find their happiness diminished by
the knowledge of the poverty and misery that surrounds them on every
side.'In that sense only is it true that the interests of masters and men
are identical, for it is to the interest of all, both rich and poor, to
help to destroy a system that inflicts suffering upon the many and
allows true happiness to none.It is to the interest of all to try and
find a better way.'Here Crass jumped up and interrupted, shouting out that they hadn't
come there to listen to a lot of speechmaking--a remark that was
greeted with unbounded applause by most of those present.Loud cries
of 'Hear, hear!'resounded through the room, and the Semi-drunk
suggested that someone should sing a song.The men who had clamoured for a speech from Owen said nothing, and Mr
Grinder, who had been feeling rather uncomfortable, was secretly very
glad of the interruption.The Semi-drunk's suggestion that someone should sing a song was
received with unqualified approbation by everybody, including
Barrington and the other Socialists, who desired nothing better than
that the time should be passed in a manner suitable to the occasion.The landlord's daughter, a rosy girl of about twenty years of age, in a
pink print dress, sat down at the piano, and the Semi-drunk, taking his
place at the side of the instrument and facing the audience, sang the
first song with appropriate gestures, the chorus being rendered
enthusiastically by the full strength of the company, including Misery,
who by this time was slightly drunk from drinking gin and ginger beer:

        'Come, come, come an' 'ave a drink with me
        Down by the ole Bull and Bush.Come, come, come an' shake 'ands with me
        Down by the ole Bull and Bush.Come an' take 'old of me 'and
        Come, come, come an' 'ave a drink with me,
        Down by the old Bull and Bush,
        Bush!Protracted knocking on the tables greeted the end of the song, but as
the Semi-drunk knew no other except odd verses and choruses, he called
upon Crass for the next, and that gentleman accordingly sang 'Work,
Boys, Work' to the tune of 'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are
marching'.As this song is the Marseillaise of the Tariff Reform
Party, voicing as it does the highest ideals of the Tory workmen of
this country, it was an unqualified success, for most of them were
Conservatives.'Now I'm not a wealthy man,
        But I lives upon a plan
        Wot will render me as 'appy as a King;
        An' if you will allow, I'll sing it to you now,
        For time you know is always on the wing.Work, boys, work and be contented
        So long as you've enough to buy a meal.For if you will but try, you'll be wealthy--bye and bye--
        If you'll only put yer shoulder to the wheel.''Altogether, boys,' shouted Grinder, who was a strong Tariff Reformer,
and was delighted to see that most of the men were of the same way of
thinking; and the 'boys' roared out the chorus once more:

        Work, boys, work and be contented
        So long as you've enough to buy a meal
        For if you will but try, you'll be wealthy--bye and bye
        If you'll only put your shoulder to the wheel.As they sang the words of this noble chorus the Tories seemed to become
inspired with lofty enthusiasm.It is of course impossible to say for
certain, but probably as they sang there arose before their exalted
imaginations, a vision of the Past, and looking down the long vista of
the years that were gone, they saw that from their childhood they had
been years of poverty and joyless toil.They saw their fathers and
mothers, weaned and broken with privation and excessive labour, sinking
unhonoured into the welcome oblivion of the grave.And then, as a change came over the spirit of their dream, they saw the
Future, with their own children travelling along the same weary road to
the same kind of goal.It is possible that visions of this character were conjured up in their
minds by the singing, for the words of the song gave expression to
their ideal of what human life should be.That was all they wanted--to
be allowed to work like brutes for the benefit of other people.They
did not want to be civilized themselves and they intended to take good
care that the children they had brought into the world should never
enjoy the benefits of civilization either.As they often said:

'Who and what are our children that they shouldn't be made to work for
their betters?They're not Gentry's children, are they?The good
things of life was never meant for the likes of them.That's wot the likes of them was made for, and if we can only get
Tariff Reform for 'em they will always be sure of plenty of it--not
only Full Time, but Overtime!As for edication, travellin' in furrin'
parts, an' enjoying life an' all sich things as that, they was never
meant for the likes of our children--they're meant for Gentry's
children!Our children is only like so much dirt compared with
Gentry's children!That's wot the likes of us is made for--to Work for
Gentry, so as they can 'ave plenty of time to enjoy theirselves; and
the Gentry is made to 'ave a good time so as the likes of us can 'ave
Plenty of Work.'There were several more verses, and by the time they had sung them all,
the Tories were in a state of wild enthusiasm.Even Ned Dawson, who
had fallen asleep with his head pillowed on his arms on the table,
roused himself up at the end of each verse, and after having joined in
the chorus, went to sleep again.At the end of the song they gave three cheers for Tariff Reform and
Plenty of Work, and then Crass, who, as the singer of the last song,
had the right to call upon the next man, nominated Philpot, who
received an ovation when he stood up, for he was a general favourite.He never did no harm to nobody, and he was always wiling to do anyone a
good turn whenever he had the opportunity.Shouts of 'Good old Joe'
resounded through the room as he crossed over to the piano, and in
response to numerous requests for 'The old song' he began to sing 'The
Flower Show':

        'Whilst walkin' out the other night, not knowing where to go
        I saw a bill upon a wall about a Flower Show.So I thought the flowers I'd go and see to pass away the night.And when I got into that Show it was a curious sight.So with your kind intention and a little of your aid,
        Tonight some flowers I'll mention which I hope will never fade.'Omnes:
        To-night some flowers I'll mention which I hope will never fade.'There were several more verses, from which it appeared that the
principal flowers in the Show were the Rose, the Thistle and the
Shamrock.When he had finished, the applause was so deafening and the demands for
an encore so persistent that to satisfy them he sang another old
favourite--'Won't you buy my pretty flowers?''Ever coming, ever going,
        Men and women hurry by,
        Heedless of the tear-drops gleaming,
        In her sad and wistful eye
        How her little heart is sighing
        Thro' the cold and dreary hours,
        Only listen to her crying,
        "Won't you buy my pretty flowers?"'When the last verse of this sang had been sung five er six times,
Philpot exercised his right of nominating the next singer, and called
upon Dick Wantley, who with many suggestive gestures and grimaces sang
'Put me amongst the girls', and afterwards called upon Payne, the
foreman carpenter, who gave 'I'm the Marquis of Camberwell Green'.There was a lot of what music-hall artists call 'business' attached to
his song, and as he proceeded, Payne, who was ghastly pale and very
nervous, went through a lot of galvanic motions and gestures, bowing
and scraping and sliding about and flourishing his handkerchief in
imitation of the courtly graces of the Marquis.During this
performance the audience maintained an appalling silence, which so
embarrassed Payne that before he was half-way through the song he had
to stop because he could not remember the rest.However, to make up
for this failure he sang another called 'We all must die, like the fire
in the grate'.This also was received in a very lukewarm manner by the
crowd, same of whom laughed and others suggested that if he couldn't
sing any better than that, the sooner HE was dead the better.This was followed by another Tory ballad, the chorus being as follows:

        His clothes may be ragged, his hands may be soiled.But where's the disgrace if for bread he has toiled.His 'art is in the right place, deny it no one can
        The backbone of Old England is the honest workin' man.'After a few more songs it was decided to adjourn to a field at the rear
of the tavern to have a game of cricket.Sides were formed, Rushton,
Didlum, Grinder, and the other gentlemen taking part just as if they
were only common people, and while the game was in progress the rest
played ring quoits or reclined on the grass watching the players,
whilst the remainder amused themselves drinking beer and playing cards
and shove-ha'penny in the bar parlour, or taking walks around the
village sampling the beer at the other pubs, of which there were three.The time passed in this manner until seven o'clock, the hour at which
it had been arranged to start on the return journey; but about a
quarter of an hour before they set out an unpleasant incident occurred.During the time that they were playing cricket a party of glee singers,
consisting of four young girls and five men, three of whom were young
fellows, the other two being rather elderly, possibly the fathers of
some of the younger members of the party, came into the field and sang
several part songs for their entertainment.Towards the close of the
game most of the men had assembled in this field, and during a pause in
the singing the musicians sent one of their number, a shy girl about
eighteen years of age--who seemed as if she would rather that someone
else had the task--amongst the crowd to make a collection.The girl
was very nervous and blushed as she murmured her request, and held out
a straw hat that evidently belonged to one of the male members of the
glee party.A few of the men gave pennies, some refused or pretended
not to see either the girl or the hat, others offered to give her some
money for a kiss, but what caused the trouble was that two or three of
those who had been drinking more than was good for them dropped the
still burning ends of their cigars, all wet with saliva as they were,
into the hat and Dick Wantley spit into it.The girl hastily returned to her companions, and as she went some of
the men who had witnessed the behaviour of those who had insulted her,
advised them to make themselves scarce, as they stood a good chance of
getting a thrashing from the girl's friends.They said it would serve
them dam' well right if they did get a hammering.Partly sobered by fear, the three culprits sneaked off and hid
themselves, pale and trembling with terror, under the box seats of the
three brakes.They had scarcely left when the men of the glee party
came running up, furiously demanding to see those who had insulted the
girl.As they could get no satisfactory answer, one of their number
ran back and presently returned, bringing the girl with him, the other
young women following a little way behind.She said she could not see the men they were looking for, so they went
down to the public house to see if they could find them there, some of
the Rushton's men accompanying them and protesting their indignation.The time passed quickly enough and by half past seven the brakes were
loaded up again and a start made for the return journey.They called at all the taverns on the road, and by the time they
reached the Blue Lion half of them were three sheets in the wind, and
five or six were very drunk, including the driver of Crass's brake and
the man with the bugle.The latter was so far gone that they had to
let him lie down in the bottom of the carriage amongst their feet,
where he fell asleep, while the others amused themselves by blowing
weird shrieks out of the horn.There was an automatic penny-in-the-slot piano at the Blue Lion and as
that was the last house of the road they made a rather long stop there,
playing hooks and rings, shove-ha'penny, drinking, singing, dancing and
finally quarrelling.Several of them seemed disposed to quarrel with Newman.All sorts of
offensive remarks were made at him in his hearing.Once someone
ostentatiously knocked his glass of lemonade over, and a little later
someone else collided violently with him just as he was in the act of
drinking, causing his lemonade to spill all over his clothes.The
worst of it was that most of these rowdy ones were his fellow
passengers in Crass's brake, and there was not much chance of getting a
seat in either of the other carriages, for they were overcrowded
already.From the remarks he overheard from time to time, Newman guessed the
reason of their hostility, and as their manner towards him grew more
menacing, he became so nervous that he began to think of quietly
sneaking off and walking the remainder of the way home by himself,
unless he could get somebody in one of the other brakes to change seats
with him.Whilst these thoughts were agitating his mind, Dick Wantley suddenly
shouted out that he was going to go for the dirty tyke who had offered
to work under price last winter.It was his fault that they were all working for sixpence halfpenny and
he was going to wipe the floor with him.Some of his friends eagerly
offered to assist, but others interposed, and for a time it looked as
if there was going to be a free fight, the aggressors struggling hard
to get at their inoffensive victim.Eventually, however, Newman found a seat in Misery's brake, squatting
on the floor with his back to the horses, thankful enough to be out of
reach of the drunken savages, who were now roaring out ribald songs and
startling the countryside, as they drove along, with unearthly blasts
on the coach horn.Meantime, although none of them seemed to notice it, the brake was
travelling at a furious rate, and swaying about from side to side in a
very erratic manner.It would have been the last carriage, but things
had got a bit mixed at the Blue Lion and, instead of bringing up the
rear of the procession, it was now second, just behind the small
vehicle containing Rushton and his friends.Crass several times reminded them that the other carriage was so near
that Rushton must be able to hear every word that was said, and these
repeated admonitions at length enraged the Semi-drunk, who shouted out
that they didn't care a b--r if he could hear.'You're only a dirty toe-rag!That's all you are--a bloody rotter!That's the only reason you gets put in charge of jobs--'cos you're a
good <DW65>-driver!You're a bloody sight worse than Rushton or Misery
either!Who was it started the one-man, one-room dodge, eh?'Knock 'im orf 'is bleedin' perch,' suggested Bundy.Everybody seemed to think this was a very good idea, but when the
Semi-drunk attempted to rise for the purpose of carrying it out, he was
thrown down by a sudden lurch of the carriage on the top of the
prostrate figure of the bugle man and by the time the others had
assisted him back to his seat they had forgotten all about their plan
of getting rid of Crass.Meantime the speed of the vehicle had increased to a fearful rate.Rushton and the other occupants of the little wagonette in front had
been for some time shouting to them to moderate the pace of their
horses, but as the driver of Crass's brake was too drunk to understand
what they said he took no notice, and they had no alternative but to
increase their own speed to avoid being run down.The drunken driver
now began to imagine that they were trying to race him, and became
fired with the determination to pass them.It was a very narrow road,
but there was just about room to do it, and he had sufficient
confidence in his own skill with the ribbons to believe that he could
get past in safety.The terrified gesticulations and the shouts of Rushton's party only
served to infuriate him, because he imagined that they were jeering at
him for not being able to overtake them.He stood up on the footboard
and lashed the horses till they almost flew over the ground, while the
carriage swayed and skidded in a fearful manner.In front, the horses of Rushton's conveyance were also galloping at top
speed, the vehicle bounding and reeling from one side of the road to
the other, whilst its terrified occupants, whose faces were blanched
with apprehension, sat clinging to their seats and to each other, their
eyes projecting from the sockets as they gazed back with terror at
their pursuers, some of whom were encouraging the drunken driver with
promises of quarts of beer, and urging on the horses with curses and
yells.Crass's fat face was pallid with fear as he clung trembling to his
seat.Another man, very drunk and oblivious of everything, was leaning
over the side of the brake, spewing into the road, while the remainder,
taking no interest in the race, amused themselves by singing--conducted
by the Semi-drunk--as loud as they could roar:

        'Has anyone seen a Germin band,
        Germin Band, Germin Band?I've been lookin' about,
        Pom--Pom, Pom, Pom, Pom!'I've searched every pub, both near and far,
        Near and far, near and far,
        I want my Fritz,
        What plays tiddley bits
        On the big trombone!'The one presided over by
Hunter contained a mournful crew.Nimrod himself, from the effects of
numerous drinks of ginger beer with secret dashes of gin in it, had
become at length crying drunk, and sat weeping in gloomy silence beside
the driver, a picture of lachrymose misery and but dimly conscious of
his surroundings, and Slyme, who rode with Hunter because he was a
fellow member of the Shining Light Chapel.Then there was another
paperhanger--an unhappy wretch who was afflicted with religious mania;
he had brought a lot of tracts with him which he had distributed to the
other men, to the villagers of Tubberton and to anybody else who would
take them.Most of the other men who rode in Nimrod's brake were of the
'religious' working man type.Ignorant, shallow-pated dolts, without
as much intellectuality as an average cat.Attendants at various PSAs
and 'Church Mission Halls' who went every Sunday afternoon to be
lectured on their duty to their betters and to have their minds--save
the mark!--addled and stultified by such persons as Rushton, Sweater,
Didlum and Grinder, not to mention such mental specialists as the holy
reverend Belchers and Boshers, and such persons as John Starr.At these meetings none of the'respectable' working men were allowed to
ask any questions, or to object to, or find fault with anything that
was said, or to argue, or discuss, or criticize.They had to sit there
like a lot of children while they were lectured and preached at and
patronized.Even as sheep before their shearers are dumb, so they were
not permitted to open their mouths.For that matter they did not wish
to be allowed to ask any questions, or to discuss anything.They sat there and listened to what was said,
but they had but a very hazy conception of what it was all about.Most of them belonged to these PSAs merely for the sake of the loaves
and fishes.Every now and then they were awarded prizes--Self-help by
Smiles, and other books suitable for perusal by persons suffering from
almost complete obliteration of the mental faculties.Besides other
benefits there was usually a Christmas Club attached to the 'PSA' or
'Mission' and the things were sold to the members slightly below cost
as a reward for their servility.They were for the most part tame, broken-spirited, poor wretches who
contentedly resigned themselves to a life of miserable toil and
poverty, and with callous indifference abandoned their offspring to the
same fate.Compared with such as these, the savages of New Guinea or
the Red Indians are immensely higher in the scale of manhood.They call no man master; and if they do not enjoy the benefits
of science and civilization, neither do they toil to create those
things for the benefit of others.And as for their children--most of
those savages would rather knock them on the head with a tomahawk than
allow them to grow up to be half-starved drudges for other men.But these were not free: their servile lives were spent in grovelling
and cringing and toiling and running about like little dogs at the
behest of their numerous masters.And as for the benefits of science
and civilization, their only share was to work and help to make them,
and then to watch other men enjoy them.And all the time they were
tame and quiet and content and said, 'The likes of us can't expect to
'ave nothing better, and as for our children wot's been good enough for
us is good enough for the likes of them.'But although they were so religious and respectable and so contented to
be robbed on a large scale, yet in small matters, in the commonplace
and petty affairs of their everyday existence, most of these men were
acutely alive to what their enfeebled minds conceived to be their own
selfish interests, and they possessed a large share of that singular
cunning which characterizes this form of dementia.That was why they had chosen to ride in Nimrod's brake--because they
wished to chum up with him as much as possible, in order to increase
their chances of being kept on in preference to others who were not so
respectable.Some of these poor creatures had very large heads, but a close
examination would have shown that the size was due to the extraordinary
thickness of the bones.The cavity of the skull was not so large as
the outward appearance of the head would have led a casual observer to
suppose, and even in those instances where the brain was of a fair
size, it was of inferior quality, being coarse in texture and to a
great extent composed of fat.Although most of them were regular attendants at some place of
so-called worship, they were not all teetotallers, and some of them
were now in different stages of intoxication, not because they had had
a great deal to drink, but because--being usually abstemious--it did
not take very much to make them drunk.From time to time this miserable crew tried to enliven the journey by
singing, but as most of them only knew odd choruses it did not come to
much.As for the few who did happen to know all the words of a song,
they either had no voices or were not inclined to sing.The most
successful contribution was that of the religious maniac, who sang
several hymns, the choruses being joined in by everybody, both drunk
and sober.The strains of these hymns, wafted back through the balmy air to the
last coach, were the cause of much hilarity to its occupants who also
sang the choruses.As they had all been brought up under 'Christian'
influences and educated in 'Christian' schools, they all knew the
words: 'Work, for the night is coming', 'Turn poor Sinner and escape
Eternal Fire', 'Pull for the Shore' and 'Where is my Wandering Boy?'The last reminded Harlow of a song he knew nearly all the words of,
'Take the news to Mother', the singing of which was much appreciated by
all present and when it was finished they sang it all over again,
Philpot being so affected that he actually shed tears; and Easton
confided to Owen that there was no getting away from the fact that a
boy's best friend is his mother.In this last carriage, as in the other two, there were several men who
were more or less intoxicated and for the same reason--because not
being used to taking much liquor, the few extra glasses they had drunk
had got into their heads.They were as sober a lot of fellows as need
be at ordinary times, and they had flocked together in this brake
because they were all of about the same character--not tame, contented
imbeciles like most of those in Misery's carnage, but men something
like Harlow, who, although dissatisfied with their condition, doggedly
continued the hopeless, weary struggle against their fate.They were not teetotallers and they never went to either church or
chapel, but they spent little in drink or on any form of enjoyment--an
occasional glass of beer or a still rarer visit to a music-hall and now
and then an outing more or less similar to this being the sum total of
their pleasures.These four brakes might fitly be regarded as so many travelling lunatic
asylums, the inmates of each exhibiting different degrees and forms of
mental disorder.The occupants of the first--Rushton, Didlum and Co.--might be classed
as criminal lunatics who injured others as well as themselves.In a
properly constituted system of society such men as these would be
regarded as a danger to the community, and would be placed under such
restraint as would effectually prevent them from harming themselves or
others.These wretches had abandoned every thought and thing that
tends to the elevation of humanity.They had given up everything that
makes life good and beautiful, in order to carry on a mad struggle to
acquire money which they would never be sufficiently cultured to
properly enjoy.Deaf and blind to every other consideration, to this
end they had degraded their intellects by concentrating them upon the
minutest details of expense and profit, and for their reward they raked
in their harvest of muck and lucre along with the hatred and curses of
those they injured in the process.They knew that the money they
accumulated was foul with the sweat of their brother men, and wet with
the tears of little children, but they were deaf and blind and callous
to the consequences of their greed.Devoid of every ennobling thought
or aspiration, they grovelled on the filthy ground, tearing up the
flowers to get at the worms.In the coach presided over by Crass, Bill Bates, the Semi-drunk and the
other two or three habitual boozers were all men who had been driven
mad by their environment.At one time most of them had been fellows
like Harlow, working early and late whenever they got the chance, only
to see their earnings swallowed up in a few minutes every Saturday by
the landlord and all the other host of harpies and profitmongers, who
were waiting to demand it as soon as it was earned.In the years that
were gone, most of these men used to take all their money home
religiously every Saturday and give it to the 'old girl' for the house,
and then, lo and behold, in a moment, yea, even in the twinkling of an
eye, it was all gone!and nothing to
show for it except an insufficiency of the bare necessaries of life!But after a time they had become heartbroken and sick and tired of that
sort of thing.They hankered after a little pleasure, a little
excitement, a little fun, and they found that it was possible to buy
something like those in quart pots at the pub.They knew they were not
the genuine articles, but they were better than nothing at all, and so
they gave up the practice of giving all their money to the old girl to
give to the landlord and the other harpies, and bought beer with some
of it instead; and after a time their minds became so disordered from
drinking so much of this beer, that they cared nothing whether the rent
was paid or not.They cared but little whether the old girl and the
children had food or clothes.They said, 'To hell with everything and
everyone,' and they cared for nothing so long as they could get plenty
of beer.The occupants of Nimrod's coach have already been described and most of
them may correctly be classed as being similar to <DW35> idiots of the
third degree--very cunning and selfish, and able to read and write, but
with very little understanding of what they read except on the most
common topics.As for those who rode with Harlow in the last coach, most of them, as
has been already intimated, were men of similar character to himself.The greater number of them fairly good workmen and--unlike the boozers
in Crass's coach--not yet quite heartbroken, but still continuing the
hopeless struggle against poverty.These differed from Nimrod's lot
inasmuch as they were not content.They were always complaining of
their wretched circumstances, and found a certain kind of pleasure in
listening to the tirades of the Socialists against the existing social
conditions, and professing their concurrence with many of the
sentiments expressed, and a desire to bring about a better state of
affairs.Most of them appeared to be quite sane, being able to converse
intelligently on any ordinary subject without discovering any symptoms
of mental disorder, and it was not until the topic of Parliamentary
elections was mentioned that evidence of their insanity was
forthcoming.It then almost invariably appeared that they were subject
to the most extraordinary hallucinations and extravagant delusions, the
commonest being that the best thing that the working people could do to
bring about an improvement in their condition, was to continue to elect
their Liberal and Tory employers to make laws for and to rule over
them!At such times, if anyone ventured to point out to them that that
was what they had been doing all their lives, and referred them to the
manifold evidences that met them wherever they turned their eyes of its
folly and futility, they were generally immediately seized with a
paroxysm of the most furious mania, and were with difficulty prevented
from savagely assaulting those who differed from them.They were usually found in a similar condition of maniacal excitement
for some time preceding and during a Parliamentary election, but
afterwards they usually manifested that modification of insanity which
is called melancholia.In fact they alternated between these two forms
of the disease.During elections, the highest state of exalted mania;
and at ordinary times--presumably as a result of reading about the
proceedings in Parliament of the persons whom they had elected--in a
state of melancholic depression, in their case an instance of hope
deferred making the heart sick.This condition occasionally proved to be the stage of transition into
yet another modification of the disease--that known as dipsomania, the
phase exhibited by Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk.Yet another form of insanity was that shown by the Socialists.Like
most of their fellow passengers in the last coach, the majority of
these individuals appeared to be of perfectly sound mind.Upon
entering into conversation with them one found that they reasoned
correctly and even brilliantly.They had divided their favourite
subject into three parts.First; an exact definition of the condition
known as Poverty.Secondly; a knowledge of the causes of Poverty; and
thirdly, a rational plan for the cure of Poverty.Those who were
opposed to them always failed to refute their arguments, and feared,
and nearly always refused, to meet them in fair fight--in open
debate--preferring to use the cowardly and despicable weapons of
slander and misrepresentation.The fact that these Socialists never
encountered their opponents except to defeat them, was a powerful
testimony to the accuracy of their reasonings and the correctness of
their conclusions--and yet they were undoubtedly mad.One might
converse with them for an indefinite time on the three divisions of
their subject without eliciting any proofs of insanity, but directly
one inquired what means they proposed to employ in order to bring about
the adoption of their plan, they replied that they hoped to do so by
reasoning with the others!Although they had sense enough to understand the real causes of
poverty, and the only cure for poverty, they were nevertheless so
foolish that they entertained the delusion that it is possible to
reason with demented persons, whereas every sane person knows that to
reason with a maniac is not only fruitless, but rather tends to fix
more deeply the erroneous impressions of his disordered mind.The wagonette containing Rushton and his friends continued to fly over
the road, pursued by the one in which rode Crass, Bill Bates, and the
Semi-drunk; but notwithstanding all the efforts of the drunken driver,
they were unable to overtake or pass the smaller vehicle, and when they
reached the foot of the hill that led up to Windley the distance
between the two carriages rapidly increased, and the race was
reluctantly abandoned.When they reached the top of the hill Rushton and his friends did not
wait for the others, but drove off towards Mugsborough as fast as they
could.Crass's brake was the next to arrive at the summit, and they halted
there to wait for the other two conveyances and when they came up all
those who lived nearby got out, and some of them sang 'God Save the
King', and then with shouts of 'Good Night', and cries of 'Don't forget
six o'clock Monday morning', they dispersed to their homes and the
carriages moved off once more.At intervals as they passed through Windley brief stoppages were made
in order to enable others to get out, and by the time they reached the
top of the long incline that led down into Mugsborough it was nearly
twelve o'clock and the brakes were almost empty, the only passengers
being Owen and four or five others who lived down town.By ones and
twos these also departed, disappearing into the obscurity of the night,
until there was none left, and the Beano was an event of the past.Chapter 45

The Great Oration


The outlook for the approaching winter was--as usual--gloomy in the
extreme.One of the leading daily newspapers published an article
prophesying a period of severe industrial depression.'As the
warehouses were glutted with the things produced by the working
classes, there was no need for them to do any more work--at present;
and so they would now have to go and starve until such time as their
masters had sold or consumed the things already produced.'Of course,
the writer of the article did not put it exactly like that, but that
was what it amounted to.This article was quoted by nearly all the
other papers, both Liberal and Conservative.The Tory papers--ignoring
the fact that all the Protectionist countries were in exactly the same
condition, published yards of misleading articles about Tariff Reform.The Liberal papers said Tariff Reform was no remedy.Look at America
and Germany--worse than here!Still, the situation was undoubtedly
very serious--continued the Liberal papers--and Something would have to
be done.They did not say exactly what, because, of course, they did
not know; but Something would have to be done--tomorrow.They talked
vaguely about Re-afforestation, and Reclaiming of Foreshores, and Sea
walls: but of course there was the question of Cost!But all the same Something would have to be done.Great caution was necessary in dealing with
such difficult problems!We must go slow, and if in the meantime a few
thousand children die of starvation, or become 'rickety' or consumptive
through lack of proper nutrition it is, of course, very regrettable,
but after all they are only working-class children, so it doesn't
matter a great deal.Most of the writers of these Liberal and Tory papers seemed to think
that all that was necessary was to find 'Work' for the 'working' class!That was their conception of a civilized nation in the twentieth
century!For the majority of the people to work like brutes in order
to obtain a 'living wage' for themselves and to create luxuries for a
small minority of persons who are too lazy to work at all!And
although this was all they thought was necessary, they did not know
what to do in order to bring even that much to pass!Winter was
returning, bringing in its train the usual crop of horrors, and the
Liberal and Tory monopolists of wisdom did not know what to do!Rushton's had so little work in that nearly all the hands expected that
they would be slaughtered the next Saturday after the 'Beano' and there
was one man--Jim Smith he was called--who was not allowed to live even
till then: he got the sack before breakfast on the Monday morning after
the Beano.This man was about forty-five years old, but very short for his age,
being only a little over five feet in height.The other men used to
say that Little Jim was not made right, for while his body was big
enough for a six-footer, his legs were very short, and the fact that he
was rather inclined to be fat added to the oddity of his appearance.On the Monday morning after the Beano he was painting an upper room in
a house where several other men were working, and it was customary for
the coddy to shout 'Yo!at mealtimes, to let the hands know when
it was time to leave off work.At about ten minutes to eight, Jim had
squared the part of the work he had been doing--the window--so he
decided not to start on the door or the skirting until after breakfast.Whilst he was waiting for the foreman to shout 'Yo!his mind
reverted to the Beano, and he began to hum the tunes of some of the
songs that had been sung.He hummed the tune of 'He's a jolly good
fellow', and he could not get the tune out of his mind: it kept buzzing
in his head.It could not be very far
off eight now, to judge by the amount of work he had done since six
o'clock.He had rubbed down and stopped all the woodwork and painted
the window.He was only getting
sixpence-halfpenny an hour and if he hadn't earned a bob he hadn't
earned nothing!Anyhow, whether he had done enough for 'em or not he
wasn't goin' to do no more before breakfast.The tune of 'He's a jolly good fellow' was still buzzing in his head;
he thrust his hands deep down in his trouser pockets, and began to
polka round the room, humming softly:

        'I won't do no more before breakfast!So 'ip 'ip 'ip 'ooray!So 'ip 'ip 'ip 'ooray So 'ip 'ip 'ooray!I won't do no more before breakfast--etc.'and you won't do but very little after breakfast, here!'shouted
Hunter, suddenly entering the room.'I've bin watchin' of you through the crack of the door for the last
'arf hour; and you've not done a dam' stroke all the time.You make
out yer time sheet, and go to the office at nine o'clock and git yer
money; we can't afford to pay you for playing the fool.'Leaving the man dumbfounded and without waiting for a reply, Misery
went downstairs and after kicking up a devil of a row with the foreman
for the lack of discipline on the job, he instructed him that Smith was
not to be permitted to resume work after breakfast.He had come in so stealthily that no one had known anything of his
arrival until they heard him bellowing at Smith.The latter did not stay to take breakfast but went off at once, and
when he was gone the other chaps said it served him bloody well right:
he was always singing, he ought to have more sense.You can't do as
you like nowadays you know!Easton--who was working at another job with Crass as his foreman--knew
that unless some more work came in he was likely to be one of those who
would have to go.As far as he could see it was only a week or two at
the most before everything would be finished up.But notwithstanding
the prospect of being out of work so soon he was far happier than he
had been for several months past, for he imagined he had discovered the
cause of Ruth's strange manner.This knowledge came to him on the night of the Beano.When he arrived
home he found that Ruth had already gone to bed: she had not been well,
and it was Mrs Linden's explanation of her illness that led Easton to
think that he had discovered the cause of the unhappiness of the last
few months.Now that he knew--as he thought--he blamed himself for not
having been more considerate and patient with her.At the same time he
was at a loss to understand why she had not told him about it herself.The only explanation he could think of was the one suggested by Mrs
Linden--that at such times women often behaved strangely.However that
might be, he was glad to think he knew the reason of it all, and he
resolved that he would be more gentle and forebearing with her.The place where he was working was practically finished.It was a
large house called 'The Refuge', very similar to 'The Cave', and during
the last week or two, it had become what they called a 'hospital'.That is, as the other jobs became finished the men were nearly all sent
to this one, so that there was quite a large crowd of them there.The
inside work was all finished--with the exception of the kitchen, which
was used as a mess room, and the scullery, which was the paint shop.Poor old Joe Philpot, whose
rheumatism had been very bad lately, was doing a very rough
job--painting the gable from a long ladder.But though there were plenty of younger men more suitable for this,
Philpot did not care to complain for fear Crass or Misery should think
he was not up to his work.At dinner time all the old hands assembled
in the kitchen, including Crass, Easton, Harlow, Bundy and Dick
Wantley, who still sat on a pail behind his usual moat.Philpot and Harlow were absent and everybody wondered what had become
of them.Several times during the morning they had been seen whispering together
and comparing scraps of paper, and various theories were put forward to
account for their disappearance.Most of the men thought they must
have heard something good about the probable winner of the Handicap and
had gone to put something on.Some others thought that perhaps they
had heard of another 'job' about to be started by some other firm and
had gone to inquire about it.'Looks to me as if they'll stand a very good chance of gettin' drowned
if they're gone very far,' remarked Easton, referring to the weather.It had been threatening to rain all the morning, and during the last
few minutes it had become so dark that Crass lit the gas, so that--as
he expressed it--they should be able to see the way to their mouths.Outside, the wind grew more boisterous every moment; the darkness
continued to increase, and presently there succeeded a torrential
downfall of rain, which beat fiercely against the windows, and poured
in torrents down the glass.No
more work could be done outside that day, and there was nothing left to
do inside.As they were paid by the hour, this would mean that they
would have to lose half a day's pay.'If it keeps on like this we won't be able to do no more work, and we
won't be able to go home either,' remarked Easton.'Well, we're all right 'ere, ain't we?'said the man behind the moat;
'there's a nice fire and plenty of heasy chairs.Wot the 'ell more do
you want?''If we only had a shove-ha'penny
table or a ring board, I reckon we should be able to enjoy ourselves
all right.'Philpot and Harlow were still absent, and the others again fell to
wondering where they could be.'I see old Joe up on 'is ladder only a few minutes before twelve,'
remarked Wantley.At this moment the two truants returned, looking very important.Philpot was armed with a hammer and carried a pair of steps, while
Harlow bore a large piece of wallpaper which the two of them proceeded
to tack on the wall, much to the amusement of the others, who read the
announcement opposite written in charcoal.Every day at meals since Barrington's unexpected outburst at the Beano
dinner, the men had been trying their best to 'kid him on' to make
another speech, but so far without success.If anything, he had been
even more silent and reserved than before, as if he felt some regret
that he had spoken as he had on that occasion.Crass and his disciples
attributed Barrington's manner to fear that he was going to get the
sack for his trouble and they agreed amongst themselves that it would
serve him bloody well right if 'e did get the push.When they had fixed the poster on the wall, Philpot stood the steps in
the corner of the room, with the back part facing outwards, and then,
everything being ready for the lecturer, the two sat down in their
accustomed places and began to eat their dinners, Harlow remarking that
they would have to buck up or they would be too late for the meeting;
and the rest of the crowd began to discuss the poster.'Wot the 'ell does PLO mean?''Plain Layer On,' answered Philpot modestly.''Ave you ever 'eard the Professor preach before?'inquired the man on
the pail, addressing Bundy.Imperial Bankquet Hall

'Only once, at the Beano,' replied that individual; 'an' that was once
too often!''Finest speaker I ever 'eard,' said the man on the pail with
enthusiasm.'I wouldn't miss this lecture for anything: this is one of
'is best subjects.I got 'ere about two hours before the doors was
opened, so as to be sure to get a seat.''Yes, it's a very good subject,' said Crass, with a sneer.'I believe
most of the Labour Members in Parliament is well up in it.''Seems to me as
if most of them knows something about it too.''The difference is,' said Owen, 'the working classes voluntarily pay to
keep the Labour Members, but whether they like it or not, they have to
keep the others.''The Labour members is sent to the 'Ouse of Commons,' said Harlow, 'and
paid their wages to do certain work for the benefit of the working
classes, just the same as we're sent 'ere and paid our wages by the
Bloke to paint this 'ouse.''Yes,' said Crass; 'but if we didn't do the work we're paid to do, we
should bloody soon get the sack.''I can't see how we've got to keep the other members,' said Slyme;
'they're mostly rich men, and they live on their own money.''And I should like to know where we should be
without 'em!It seems to me more like it
that they keeps us!Where
should we be if it wasn't for all the money they spend and the work
they 'as done?If the owner of this 'ouse 'adn't 'ad the money to
spend to 'ave it done up, most of us would 'ave bin out of work this
last six weeks, and starvin', the same as lots of others 'as been.''Oh yes, that's right enough,' agreed Bundy.Before any work can be done there's one thing
necessary, and that's money.It would be easy to find work for all the
unemployed if the local authorities could only raise the money.''Yes; that's quite true,' said Owen.'And that proves that money is
the cause of poverty, because poverty consists in being short of the
necessaries of life: the necessaries of life are all produced by labour
applied to the raw materials: the raw materials exist in abundance and
there are plenty of people able and willing to work; but under present
conditions no work can be done without money; and so we have the
spectacle of a great army of people compelled to stand idle and starve
by the side of the raw materials from which their labour could produce
abundance of all the things they need--they are rendered helpless by
the power of Money!Those who possess all the money say that the
necessaries of life shall not be produced except for their profit.'and you can't alter it,' said Crass, triumphantly.'It's always
been like it, and it always will be like it.''There's always been
rich and poor in the world, and there always will be.'Several others expressed their enthusiastic agreement with Crass's
opinion, and most of them appeared to be highly delighted to think that
the existing state of affairs could never be altered.'It hasn't always been like it, and it won't always be like it,' said
Owen.'The time will come, and it's not very far distant, when the
necessaries of life will be produced for use and not for profit.The
time is coming when it will no longer be possible for a few selfish
people to condemn thousands of men and women and little children to
live in misery and die of want.''Ah well, it won't be in your time, or mine either,' said Crass
gleefully, and most of the others laughed with imbecile satisfaction.'I've 'eard a 'ell of a lot about this 'ere Socialism,' remarked the
man behind the moat, 'but up to now I've never met nobody wot could
tell you plainly exactly wot it is.''Yes; that's what I should like to know too,' said Easton.'Socialism means, "What's yours is mine, and what's mine's me own,"'
observed Bundy, and during the laughter that greeted this definition
Slyme was heard to say that Socialism meant Materialism, Atheism and
Free Love, and if it were ever to come about it would degrade men and
women to the level of brute beasts.Harlow said Socialism was a
beautiful ideal, which he for one would be very glad to see realized,
and he was afraid it was altogether too good to be practical, because
human nature is too mean and selfish.Sawkins said that Socialism was
a lot of bloody rot, and Crass expressed the opinion--which he had
culled from the delectable columns of the Obscurer--that it meant
robbing the industrious for the benefit of the idle and thriftless.Philpot had by this time finished his bread and cheese, and, having
taken a final draught of tea, he rose to his feet, and crossing over to
the corner of the room, ascended the pulpit, being immediately greeted
with a tremendous outburst of hooting, howling and booing, which he
smilingly acknowledged by removing his cap from his bald head and
bowing repeatedly.When the storm of shrieks, yells, groans and
catcalls had in some degree subsided, and Philpot was able to make
himself heard, he addressed the meeting as follows:

'Gentlemen: First of all I beg to thank you very sincerely for the
magnificent and cordial reception you have given me on this occasion,
and I shall try to deserve your good opinion by opening the meeting as
briefly as possible.'Putting all jokes aside, I think we're all agreed about one thing, and
that is, that there's plenty of room for improvement in things in
general.As our other lecturer, Professor Owen, pointed
out in one of 'is lectures and as most of you 'ave read in the
newspapers, although British trade was never so good before as it is
now, there was never so much misery and poverty, and so many people out
of work, and so many small shopkeepers goin' up the spout as there is
at this partickiler time.Now, some people tells us as the way to put
everything right is to 'ave Free Trade and plenty of cheap food.Well,
we've got them all now, but the misery seems to go on all around us all
the same.Then there's other people tells us as the 'Friscal Policy'
is the thing to put everything right.("Hear, hear" from Crass and
several others.)And then there's another lot that ses that Socialism
is the only remedy.Well, we all know pretty well wot Free Trade and
Protection means, but most of us don't know exactly what Socialism
means; and I say as it's the dooty of every man to try and find out
which is the right thing to vote for, and when 'e's found it out, to do
wot 'e can to 'elp to bring it about.And that's the reason we've gorn
to the enormous expense of engaging Professor Barrington to come 'ere
this afternoon and tell us exactly what Socialism is.''As I 'ope you're all just as anxious to 'ear it as I am myself, I
will not stand between you and the lecturer no longer, but will now
call upon 'im to address you.'Philpot was loudly applauded as he descended from the pulpit, and in
response to the clamorous demands of the crowd, Barrington, who in the
meantime had yielded to Owen's entreaties that he would avail himself
of this opportunity of proclaiming the glad tidings of the good time
that is to be, got up on the steps in his turn.Harlow, desiring that everything should be done decently and in order,
had meantime arranged in front of the pulpit a carpenter's sawing
stool, and an empty pail with a small piece of board laid across it, to
serve as a seat and a table for the chairman.Over the table he draped
a large red handkerchief.At the right he placed a plumber's large
hammer; at the left, a battered and much-chipped jam-jar, full of tea.Philpot having taken his seat on the pail at this table and announced
his intention of bashing out with the hammer the brains of any
individual who ventured to disturb the meeting, Barrington commenced:

'Mr Chairman and Gentlemen.For the sake of clearness, and in order to
avoid confusing one subject with another, I have decided to divide the
oration into two parts.First, I will try to explain as well as I am
able what Socialism is.I will try to describe to you the plan or
system upon which the Co-operative Commonwealth of the future will be
organized; and, secondly, I will try to tell you how it can be brought
about.But before proceeding with the first part of the subject, I
would like to refer very slightly to the widespread delusion that
Socialism is impossible because it means a complete change from an
order of things which has always existed.We constantly hear it said
that because there have always been rich and poor in the world, there
always must be.I want to point out to you first of all, that it is
not true that even in its essential features, the present system has
existed from all time; it is not true that there have always been rich
and poor in the world, in the sense that we understand riches and
poverty today.'These statements are lies that have been invented for the purpose of
creating in us a feeling of resignation to the evils of our condition.They are lies which have been fostered by those who imagine that it is
to their interest that we should be content to see our children
condemned to the same poverty and degradation that we have endured
ourselves.I do not propose--because there is not time, although it is really part
of my subject--to go back to the beginnings of history, and describe in
detail the different systems of social organization which evolved from
and superseded each other at different periods, but it is necessary to
remind you that the changes that have taken place in the past have been
even greater than the change proposed by Socialists today.The change
from savagery and cannibalism when men used to devour the captives they
took in war--to the beginning of chattel slavery, when the tribes or
clans into which mankind were divided--whose social organization was a
kind of Communism, all the individuals belonging to the tribe being
practically social equals, members of one great family--found it more
profitable to keep their captives as slaves than to eat them.The
change from the primitive Communism of the tribes, into the more
individualistic organization of the nations, and the development of
private ownership of the land and slaves and means of subsistence.The
change from chattel slavery into Feudalism; and the change from
Feudalism into the earlier form of Capitalism; and the equally great
change from what might be called the individualistic capitalism which
displaced Feudalism, to the system of Co-operative Capitalism and Wage
Slavery of today.''I believe you must 'ave swollered a bloody dictionary,' exclaimed the
man behind the moat.'Keep horder,' shouted Philpot, fiercely, striking the table with the
hammer, and there were loud shouts of 'Chair' and 'Chuck 'im out,' from
several quarters.When order was restored, the lecturer proceeded:

'So it is not true that practically the same state of affairs as we
have today has always existed.It is not true that anything like the
poverty that prevails at present existed at any previous period of the
world's history.When the workers were the property of their masters,
it was to their owners' interest to see that they were properly clothed
and fed; they were not allowed to be idle, and they were not allowed to
starve.Under Feudalism also, although there were certain intolerable
circumstances, the position of the workers was, economically,
infinitely better than it is today.The worker was in subjection to
his Lord, but in return his lord had certain responsibilities and
duties to perform, and there was a large measure of community of
interest between them.'I do not intend to dwell upon this pout at length, but in support of
what I have said I will quote as nearly as I can from memory the words
of the historian Froude.'"I do not believe," says Mr Froude, "that the condition of the people
in Mediaeval Europe was as miserable as is pretended.I do not believe
that the distribution of the necessaries of life was as unequal as it
is at present.If the tenant lived hard, the lord had little luxury.Earls and countesses breakfasted at five in the morning, on salt beef
and herring, a slice of bread and a draught of ale from a blackjack.Lords and servants dined in the same hall and shared the same meal."'When we arrive at the system that displaced Feudalism, we find that
the condition of the workers was better in every way than it is at
present.The instruments of production--the primitive machinery and
the tools necessary for the creation of wealth--belonged to the skilled
workers who used them, and the things they produced were also the
property of those who made them.'In those days a master painter, a master shoemaker, a master saddler,
or any other master tradesmen, was really a skilled artisan working on
his own account.He usually had one or two apprentices, who were
socially his equals, eating at the same table and associating with the
other members of his family.It was quite a common occurrence for the
apprentice--after he had attained proficiency in his work--to marry his
master's daughter and succeed to his master's business.In those days
to be a "master" tradesman meant to be master of the trade, not merely
of some underpaid drudges in one's employment.The apprentices were
there to master the trade, qualifying themselves to become master
workers themselves; not mere sweaters and exploiters of the labour of
others, but useful members of society.In those days, because there
was no labour-saving machinery the community was dependent for its
existence on the productions of hand labour.Consequently the majority
of the people were employed in some kind of productive work, and the
workers were honoured and respected citizens, living in comfort on the
fruits of their labour.They were not rich as we understand wealth
now, but they did not starve and they were not regarded with contempt,
as are their successors of today.'The next great change came with the introduction of steam machinery.That power came to the aid of mankind in their struggle for existence,
enabling them to create easily and in abundance those things of which
they had previously been able to produce only a bare sufficiency.A
wonderful power--equalling and surpassing the marvels that were
imagined by the writers of fairy tales and Eastern stories--a power so
vast--so marvellous, that it is difficult to find words to convey
anything like an adequate conception of it.'We all remember the story, in The Arabian Nights, of Aladdin, who in
his poverty became possessed of the Wonderful Lamp and--he was poor no
longer.He merely had to rub the Lamp--the Genie appeared, and at
Aladdin's command he produced an abundance of everything that the youth
could ask or dream of.With the discovery of steam machinery, mankind
became possessed of a similar power to that imagined by the Eastern
writer.At the command of its masters the Wonderful Lamp of Machinery
produces an enormous, overwhelming, stupendous abundance and
superfluity of every material thing necessary for human existence and
happiness.With less labour than was formerly required to cultivate
acres, we can now cultivate miles of land.In response to human
industry, aided by science and machinery, the fruitful earth teems with
such lavish abundance as was never known or deemed possible before.If
you go into the different factories and workshops you will see
prodigious quantities of commodities of every kind pouring out of the
wonderful machinery, literally like water from a tap.'One would naturally and reasonably suppose that the discovery or
invention of such an aid to human industry would result in increased
happiness and comfort for every one; but as you all know, the reverse
is the case; and the reason of that extraordinary result, is the reason
of all the poverty and unhappiness that we see around us and endure
today--it is simply because--the machinery became the property of a
comparatively few individuals and private companies, who use it not for
the benefit of the community but to create profits for themselves.'As this labour-saving machinery became more extensively used, the
prosperous class of skilled workers gradually disappeared.Some of the
wealthier of them became distributers instead of producers of wealth;
that is to say, they became shopkeepers, retailing the commodities that
were produced for the most part by machinery.But the majority of them
in course of time degenerated into a class of mere wage earners, having
no property in the machines they used, and no property in the things
they made.'They sold their labour for so much per hour, and when they could not
find any employer to buy it from them, they were reduced to destitution.'Whilst the unemployed workers were starving and those in employment
not much better off, the individuals and private companies who owned
the machinery accumulated fortunes; but their profits were diminished
and their working expenses increased by what led to the latest great
change in the organization of the production of the necessaries of
life--the formation of the Limited Companies and the Trusts; the
decision of the private companies to combine and co-operate with each
other in order to increase their profits and decrease their working
expenses.The results of these combines have been--an increase in the
quantities of the things produced: a decrease in the number of wage
earners employed--and enormously increased profits for the shareholders.'But it is not only the wage-earning class that is being hurt; for
while they are being annihilated by the machinery and the efficient
organization of industry by the trusts that control and are beginning
to monopolize production, the shopkeeping classes are also being slowly
but surely crushed out of existence by the huge companies that are able
by the greater magnitude of their operations to buy and sell more
cheaply than the small traders.'The consequence of all this is that the majority of the people are in
a condition of more or less abject poverty--living from hand to mouth.It is an admitted fact that about thirteen millions of our people are
always on the verge of starvation.The significant results of this
poverty face us on every side.The alarming and persistent increase of
insanity.The large number of would-be recruits for the army who have
to be rejected because they are physically unfit; and the shameful
condition of the children of the poor.More than one-third of the
children of the working classes in London have some sort of mental or
physical defect; defects in development; defects of eyesight; abnormal
nervousness; rickets, and mental dullness.The difference in height
and weight and general condition of the children in poor schools and
the children of the so-called better classes, constitutes a crime that
calls aloud to Heaven for vengeance upon those who are responsible for
it.'It is childish to imagine that any measure of Tariff Reform or
Political Reform such as a paltry tax on foreign-made goods or
abolishing the House of Lords, or disestablishing the Church--or
miserable Old Age Pensions, or a contemptible tax on land, can deal
with such a state of affairs as this.They have no House of Lords in
America or France, and yet their condition is not materially different
from ours.You may be deceived into thinking that such measures as
those are great things.You may fight for them and vote for them, but
after you have got them you will find that they will make no
appreciable improvement in your condition.You will still have to
slave and drudge to gain a bare sufficiency of the necessaries of life.You will still have to eat the same kind of food and wear the same kind
of clothes and boots as now.Your masters will still have you in their
power to insult and sweat and drive.Your general condition will be
just the same as at present because such measures as those are not
remedies but red herrings, intended by those who trail them to draw us
away from the only remedy, which is to be found only in the Public
Ownership of the Machinery, and the National Organization of Industry
for the production and distribution of the necessaries of life, not for
the profit of a few but for the benefit of all!'That is the next great change; not merely desirable, but imperatively
necessary and inevitable!'It is not a wild dream of Superhuman Unselfishness.No one will be
asked to sacrifice himself for the benefit of others or to love his
neighbours better than himself as is the case under the present system,
which demands that the majority shall unselfishly be content to labour
and live in wretchedness for the benefit of a few.There is no such
principle of Philanthropy in Socialism, which simply means that even as
all industries are now owned by shareholders, and organized and
directed by committees and officers elected by the shareholders, so
shall they in future belong to the State, that is, the whole
people--and they shall be organized and directed by committees and
officers elected by the community.'Under existing circumstances the community is exposed to the danger of
being invaded and robbed and massacred by some foreign power.Therefore
the community has organized and owns and controls an Army and Navy to
protect it from that danger.Under existing circumstances the
community is menaced by another equally great danger--the people are
mentally and physically degenerating from lack of proper food and
clothing.Socialists say that the community should undertake and
organize the business of producing and distributing all these things;
that the State should be the only employer of labour and should own all
the factories, mills, mines, farms, railways, fishing fleets, sheep
farms, poultry farms and cattle ranches.'Under existing circumstances the community is degenerating mentally
and physically because the majority cannot afford to have decent houses
to live in.Socialists say that the community should take in hand the
business of providing proper houses for all its members, that the State
should be the only landlord, that all the land and all the houses
should belong to the whole people...

'We must do this if we are to keep our old place in the van of human
progress.A nation of ignorant, unintelligent, half-starved,
broken-spirited degenerates cannot hope to lead humanity in its
never-ceasing march onward to the conquest of the future.'Vain, mightiest fleet of iron framed;
        Vain the all-shattering guns
        Unless proud England keep, untamed,
        The stout hearts of her sons.'All the evils that I have referred to are only symptoms of the one
disease that is sapping the moral, mental and physical life of the
nation, and all attempts to cure these symptoms are foredoomed to
failure, simply because they are the symptoms and not the disease.All
the talk of Temperance, and the attempts to compel temperance, are
foredoomed to failure, because drunkenness is a symptom, and not the
disease.Daniel went to the hallway.Every year millions of pounds
worth of wealth are produced by her people, only to be stolen from them
by means of the Money Trick by the capitalist and official class.Her
industrious sons and daughters, who are nearly all total abstainers,
live in abject poverty, and their misery is not caused by laziness or
want of thrift, or by Intemperance.They are poor for the same reason
that we are poor--Because we are Robbed.'The hundreds of thousands of pounds that are yearly wasted in
well-meant but useless charity accomplish no lasting good, because
while charity soothes the symptoms it ignores the disease, which
is--the PRIVATE OWNERSHIP of the means of producing the necessaries of
life, and the restriction of production, by a few selfish individuals
for their own profit.And for that disease there is no other remedy
than the one I have told you of--the PUBLIC OWNERSHIP and cultivation
of the land, the PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF the mines, railways, canals,
ships, factories and all the other means of production, and the
establishment of an Industrial Civil Service--a National Army of
Industry--for the purpose of producing the necessaries, comforts and
refinements of life in that abundance which has been made possible by
science and machinery--for the use and benefit of THE WHOLE OF THE
PEOPLE.''Yes: and where's the money to come from for all this?'shouted Crass,
fiercely.'Hear, hear,' cried the man behind the moat.'There's no money difficulty about it,' replied Barrington.'We can
easily find all the money we shall need.''Of course,' said Slyme, who had been reading the Daily Ananias,
'there's all the money in the Post Office Savings Bank.The Socialists
could steal that for a start; and as for the mines and land and
factories, they can all be took from the owners by force.''There will be no need for force and no need to steal anything from
anybody.''And there's another thing I objects to,' said Crass.'And that's all
this 'ere talk about hignorance: wot about all the money wots spent
every year for edication?''You should rather say--"What about all the money that's wasted every
year on education?"What can be more brutal and senseless than trying
to "educate" a poor little, hungry, ill-clad child?Such so-called
"instruction" is like the seed in the parable of the Sower, which fell
on stony ground and withered away because it had no depth of earth; and
even in those cases where it does take root and grow, it becomes like
the seed that fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it,
and it bore no fruit.'The majority of us forget in a year or two all that we learnt at
school because the conditions of our lives are such as to destroy all
inclination for culture or refinement.We must see that the children
are properly clothed and fed and that they are not made to get up in
the middle of the night to go to work for several hours before they go
to school.We must make it illegal for any greedy, heartless
profit-hunter to hire them and make them labour for several hours in
the evening after school, or all day and till nearly midnight on
Saturday.We must first see that our children are cared for, as well
as the children of savage races, before we can expect a proper return
for the money that we spend on education.''I don't mind admitting that this 'ere scheme of national ownership and
industries is all right if it could only be done,' said Harlow, 'but at
present, all the land, railways and factories, belongs to private
capitalists; they can't be bought without money, and you say you ain't
goin' to take 'em away by force, so I should like to know how the
bloody 'ell you are goin' to get 'em?''We certainly don't propose to buy them with money, for the simple
reason that there is not sufficient money in existence to pay for them.'If all the gold and silver money in the World were gathered together
into one heap, it would scarcely be sufficient to buy all the private
property in England.The people who own all these things now never
really paid for them with money--they obtained possession of them by
means of the "Money Trick" which Owen explained to us some time ago.''They obtained possession of them by usin' their brain,' said Crass.'They tell us themselves that that is
how they got them away from us; they call their profits the "wages of
intelligence".Whilst we have been working, they have been using their
intelligence in order to obtain possession of the things we have
created.The time has now arrived for us to use our intelligence in
order to get back the things they have robbed us of, aid to prevent
them from robbing us any more.As for how it is to be done, we might
copy the methods that they have found so successful.''Oh, then you DO mean to rob them after all,' cried Slyme,
triumphantly.'If it's true that they robbed the workers, and if we're
to adopt the same method then we'll be robbers too!''When a thief is caught having in his possession the property of others
it is not robbery to take the things away from him and to restore them
to their rightful owners,' retorted Barrington.'I can't allow this 'ere disorder to go on no longer,' shouted Philpot,
banging the table with the plumber's hammer as several men began
talking at the same time.'There will be plenty of tuneropperty for questions and opposition at
the hend of the horation, when the pulpit will be throwed open to
anyone as likes to debate the question.I now calls upon the professor
to proceed with the second part of the horation: and anyone wot
interrupts will get a lick under the ear-'ole with this'--waving the
hammer--'and the body will be chucked out of the bloody winder.'It was still raining heavily,
so they thought they might as well pass the time listening to
Barrington as in any other way.'A large part of the land may be got back in the same way as it was
taken from us.The ancestors of the present holders obtained
possession of it by simply passing Acts of Enclosure: the nation should
regain possession of those lands by passing Acts of Resumption.And
with regard to the other land, the present holders should be allowed to
retain possession of it during their lives and then it should revert to
the State, to be used for the benefit of all.Britain should belong to
the British people, not to a few selfish individuals.As for the
railways, they have already been nationalized in some other countries,
and what other countries can do we can do also.In New Zealand,
Australia, South Africa, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Japan and some other
countries some of the railways are already the property of the State.As for the method by which we can obtain possession of them, the
difficulty is not to discover a method, but rather to decide which of
many methods we shall adopt.One method would be to simply pass an Act
declaring that as it was contrary to the public interest that they
should be owned by private individuals, the railways would henceforth
be the property of the nation.All railways servants, managers and
officials would continue in their employment; the only difference being
that they would now be in the employ of the State.As to the
shareholders--'

'They could all be knocked on the 'ead, I suppose,' interrupted Crass.'Or go to the workhouse,' said Slyme.'Or to 'ell,' suggested the man behind the moat.

'--The State would continue to pay to the shareholders the same
dividends they had received on an average for, say, the previous three
years.These payments would be continued to the present shareholders
for life, or the payments might be limited to a stated number of years
and the shares would be made non-transferable, like the railway tickets
of today.As for the factories, shops, and other means of production
and distribution, the State must adopt the same methods of doing
business as the present owners.I mean that even as the big Trusts and
companies are crushing--by competition--the individual workers and
small traders, so the State should crush the trusts by competition.It
is surely justifiable for the State to do for the benefit of the whole
people that which the capitalists are already doing for the profit of a
few shareholders.The first step in this direction will be the
establishment of Retail Stores for the purpose of supplying all
national and municipal employees with the necessaries of life at the
lowest possible prices.At first the Administration will purchase
these things from the private manufacturers, in such large quantities
that it will be able to obtain them at the very cheapest rate, and as
there will be no heavy rents to pay for showy shops, and no advertising
expenses, and as the object of the Administration will be not to make
profit, but to supply its workmen and officials with goods at the
lowest price, they will be able to sell them much cheaper than the
profit-making private stores.'The National Service Retail Stores will be for the benefit of only
those in the public service; and gold, silver or copper money will not
be accepted in payment for the things sold.At first, all public
servants will continue to be paid in metal money, but those who desire
it will be paid all or part of their wages in paper money of the same
nominal value, which will be accepted in payment for their purchases at
the National Stores and at the National Hotels, Restaurants and other
places which will be established for the convenience of those in the
State service.It will be made of
a special very strong paper, and will be of all value, from a penny to
a pound.'As the National Service Stores will sell practically everything that
could be obtained elsewhere, and as twenty shillings in paper money
will be able to purchase much more at the stores than twenty shillings
of metal money would purchase anywhere else, it will not be long before
nearly all public servants will prefer to be paid in paper money.As
far as paying the salaries and wages of most of its officials and
workmen is concerned, the Administration will not then have any need of
metal money.But it will require metal money to pay the private
manufacturers who supply the goods sold in the National Stores.But--all these things are made by labour; so in order to avoid having
to pay metal money for them, the State will now commence to employ
productive labour.All the public land suitable for the purpose will
be put into cultivation and State factories will be established for
manufacturing food, boots, clothing, furniture and all other
necessaries and comforts of life.All those who are out of employment
and willing to work, will be given employment on these farms and in
these factories.In order that the men employed shall not have to work
unpleasantly hard, and that their hours of labour may be as short as
possible--at first, say, eight hours per day--and also to make sure
that the greatest possible quantity of everything shall be produced,
these factories and farms will be equipped with the most up-to-date and
efficient labour-saving machinery.The people employed in the farms
and factories will be paid with paper money... The commodities they
produce will go to replenish the stocks of the National Service Stores,
where the workers will be able to purchase with their paper money
everything they need.'As we shall employ the greatest possible number of labour-saving
machines, and adopt the most scientific methods in our farms and
factories, the quantities of goods we shall be able to produce will be
so enormous that we shall be able to pay our workers very high
wages--in paper money--and we shall be able to sell our produce so
cheaply, that all public servants will be able to enjoy abundance of
everything.'When the workers who are being exploited and sweated by the private
capitalists realize how much worse off they are than the workers in the
employ of the State, they will come and ask to be allowed to work for
the State, and also, for paper money.That will mean that the State
Army of Productive Workers will be continually increasing in numbers.More State factories will be built, more land will be put into
cultivation.Men will be given employment making bricks, woodwork,
paints, glass, wallpapers and all kinds of building materials and
others will be set to work building--on State land--beautiful houses,
which will be let to those employed in the service of the State.The
rent will be paid with paper money.'State fishing fleets will be established and the quantities of
commodities of all kinds produced will be so great that the State
employees and officials will not be able to use it all.With their
paper money they will be able to buy enough and more than enough to
satisfy all their needs abundantly, but there will still be a great and
continuously increasing surplus stock in the possession of the State.'The Socialist Administration will now acquire or build fleets of steam
trading vessels, which will of course be manned and officered by State
employees--the same as the Royal Navy is now.These fleets of National
trading vessels will carry the surplus stocks I have mentioned, to
foreign countries, and will there sell or exchange them for some of the
products of those countries, things that we do not produce ourselves.These things will be brought to England and sold at the National
Service Stores, at the lowest possible price, for paper money, to those
in the service of the State.This of course will only have the effect
of introducing greater variety into the stocks--it will not diminish
the surplus: and as there would be no sense in continuing to produce
more of these things than necessary, it would then be the duty of the
Administration to curtail or restrict production of the necessaries of
life.This could be done by reducing the hours of the workers without
reducing their wages so as to enable them to continue to purchase as
much as before.'Another way of preventing over production of mere necessaries and
comforts will be to employ a large number of workers producing the
refinements and pleasures of life, more artistic houses, furniture,
pictures, musical instruments and so forth.'In the centre of every district a large Institute or pleasure house
could be erected, containing a magnificently appointed and decorated
theatre; Concert Hall, Lecture Hall, Gymnasium, Billiard Rooms, Reading
Rooms, Refreshment Rooms, and so on.A detachment of the Industrial
Army would be employed as actors, artistes, musicians, singers and
entertainers.In fact everyone that could be spared from the most
important work of all--that of producing the necessaries of life--would
be employed in creating pleasure, culture, and education.All these
people--like the other branches of the public service--would be paid
with paper money, and with it all of them would be able to purchase
abundance of all those things which constitute civilization.'Meanwhile, as a result of all this, the kind-hearted private employers
and capitalists would find that no one would come and work for them to
be driven and bullied and sweated for a miserable trifle of metal money
that is scarcely enough to purchase sufficient of the necessaries of
life to keep body and soul together.'These kind-hearted capitalists will protest against what they will
call the unfair competition of State industry, and some of them may
threaten to leave the country and take their capital with them...  As
most of these persons are too lazy to work, and as we will not need
their money, we shall be very glad to see them go.But with regard to
their real capital--their factories, farms, mines or machinery--that
will be a different matter...  To allow these things to remain idle and
unproductive would constitute an injury to the community.So a law
will be passed, declaring that all land not cultivated by the owner, or
any factory shut down for more than a specified time, will be taken
possession of by the State and worked for the benefit of the
community...  Fair compensation will be paid in paper money to the
former owners, who will be granted an income or pension of so much a
year either for life or for a stated period according to circumstances
and the ages of the persons concerned.'As for the private traders, the wholesale and retail dealers in the
things produced by labour, they will be forced by the State competition
to close down their shops and warehouses--first, because they will not
be able to replenish their stocks; and, secondly, because even if they
were able to do so, they would not be able to sell them.This will
throw out of work a great host of people who are at present engaged in
useless occupations; the managers and assistants in the shops of which
we now see half a dozen of the same sort in a single street; the
thousands of men and women who are slaving away their lives producing
advertisements, for, in most cases, a miserable pittance of metal
money, with which many of them are unable to procure sufficient of the
necessaries of life to secure them from starvation.'The masons, carpenters, painters, glaziers, and all the others engaged
in maintaining these unnecessary stores and shops will all be thrown
out of employment, but all of them who are willing to work will be
welcomed by the State and will be at once employed helping either to
produce or distribute the necessaries and comforts of life.They will
have to work fewer hours than before...  They will not have to work so
hard--for there will be no need to drive or bully, because there will
be plenty of people to do the work, and most of it will be done by
machinery--and with their paper money they will be able to buy
abundance of the things they help to produce.The shops and stores
where these people were formerly employed will be acquired by the
State, which will pay the former owners fair compensation in the same
manner as to the factory owners.Some of the buildings will be
utilized by the State as National Service Stores, others transformed
into factories and others will be pulled down to make room for
dwellings, or public buildings...  It will be the duty of the
Government to build a sufficient number of houses to accommodate the
families of all those in its employment, and as a consequence of this
and because of the general disorganization and decay of what is now
called "business", all other house property of all kinds will rapidly
depreciate in value.The slums and the wretched dwellings now occupied
by the working classes--the miserable, uncomfortable, jerry-built
"villas" occupied by the lower middle classes and by "business" people,
will be left empty and valueless upon the hands of their rack renting
landlords, who will very soon voluntarily offer to hand them and the
ground they stand upon to the state on the same terms as those accorded
to the other property owners, namely--in return for a pension.Some of
these people will be content to live in idleness on the income allowed
them for life as compensation by the State: others will devote
themselves to art or science and some others will offer their services
to the community as managers and superintendents, and the State will
always be glad to employ all those who are willing to help in the Great
Work of production and distribution.'By this time the nation will be the sole employer of labour, and as no
one will be able to procure the necessaries of life without paper
money, and as the only way to obtain this will be working, it will mean
that every mentally and physically capable person in the community will
be helping in the great work of PRODUCTION and DISTRIBUTION.We shall
not need as at present, to maintain a police force to protect the
property of the idle rich from the starving wretches whom they have
robbed.There will be no unemployed and no overlapping of labour,
which will be organized and concentrated for the accomplishment of the
only rational object--the creation of the things we require...  For
every one labour-saving machine in use today, we will, if necessary,
employ a thousand machines!and consequently there will be produced
such a stupendous, enormous, prodigious, overwhelming abundance of
everything that soon the Community will be faced once more with the
serious problem of OVER-PRODUCTION.'To deal with this, it will be necessary to reduce the hours of our
workers to four or five hours a day...  All young people will be
allowed to continue at public schools and universities and will not be
required to take any part in the work or the nation until they are
twenty-one years of age.At the age of forty-five, everyone will be
allowed to retire from the State service on full pay...  All these will
be able to spend the rest of their days according to their own
inclinations; some will settle down quietly at home, and amuse
themselves in the same ways as people of wealth and leisure do at the
present day--with some hobby, or by taking part in the organization of
social functions, such as balls, parties, entertainments, the
organization of Public Games and Athletic Tournaments, Races and all
kinds of sports.'Some will prefer to continue in the service of the State.Actors,
artists, sculptors, musicians and others will go on working for their
own pleasure and honour...  Some will devote their leisure to science,
art, or literature.Others will prefer to travel on the State
steamships to different parts of the world to see for themselves all
those things of which most of us have now but a dim and vague
conception.The wonders of India and Egypt, the glories of Rome, the
artistic treasures of the continent and the sublime scenery of other
lands.'Thus--for the first time in the history of humanity--the benefits and
pleasures conferred upon mankind by science and civilization will be
enjoyed equally by all, upon the one condition, that they shall do
their share of the work, that is necessary in order to, make all these
things possible.'These are the principles upon which the CO-OPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH of
the future will be organized.The State in which no one will be
distinguished or honoured above his fellows except for Virtue or
Talent.Where no man will find his profit in another's loss, and we
shall no longer be masters and servants, but brothers, free men, and
friends.Where there will be no weary, broken men and women passing
their joyless lives in toil and want, and no little children crying
because they are hungry or cold.'A State wherein it will be possible to put into practice the teachings
of Him whom so many now pretend to follow.A society which shall have
justice and co-operation for its foundation, and International
Brotherhood and love for its law.but
        What are the deeds of today,
        In the days of the years we dwell in,
        That wear our lives away?Why, then, and for what we are waiting?There are but three words to speak
        "We will it," and what is the foreman
        but the dream strong wakened and weak?'Oh, why and for what are we waiting, while
        our brothers droop and die?And on every wind of the heavens, a
        wasted life goes by.'How long shall they reproach us, where
        crowd on crowd they dwell
        Poor ghosts of the wicked city,
        gold crushed, hungry hell?'Through squalid life they laboured in
        sordid grief they died
        Those sons of a mighty mother, those
        props of England's pride.They are gone, there is none can undo
        it, nor save our souls from the curse,
        But many a million cometh, and shall
        they be better or worse?'It is We must answer and hasten and open wide the door,
        For the rich man's hurrying terror, and the slow foot hope of
        the poor,
        Yea, the voiceless wrath of the wretched and their unlearned
        discontent,
        We must give it voice and wisdom, till the waiting tide be
        spent
        Come then since all things call us, the living and the dead,
        And o'er the weltering tangle a glimmering light is shed.'As Barrington descended from the Pulpit and walked back to his
accustomed seat, a loud shout of applause burst from a few men in the
crowd, who stood up and waved their caps and cheered again and again.When order was restored, Philpot rose and addressed the meeting:

'Is there any gentleman wot would like to ask the Speaker a question?'No one spoke and the Chairman again put the question without obtaining
any response, but at length one of the new hands who had been 'taken
on' about a week previously to replace another painter who had been
sacked for being too slow--stood up and said there was one point that
he would like a little more information about.This man had two
patches on the seat of his trousers, which were also very much frayed
and ragged at the bottoms of the legs: the lining of his coat was all
in rags, as were also the bottoms of the sleeves; his boots were old
and had been many times mended and patched; the sole of one of them had
begun to separate from the upper and he had sewn these parts together
with a few stitches of copper wire.He had been out of employment for
several weeks and it was evident from the pinched expression of his
still haggard face that during that time he had not had sufficient to
eat.This man was not a drunkard, neither was he one of those
semi-mythical persons who are too lazy to work.He was married and had
several children.One of them, a boy of fourteen years old, earned
five shillings a week as a light porter at a Grocer's.Being a householder the man had a vote, but he had never hitherto taken
much interest in what he called 'politics'.In his opinion, those
matters were not for the likes of him.He believed in leaving such
difficult subjects to be dealt with by his betters.In his present
unhappy condition he was a walking testimonial to the wisdom and virtue
and benevolence of those same 'betters' who have hitherto managed the
affairs of the world with results so very satisfactory for themselves.'I should like to ask the speaker,' he said,'supposin' all this that
'e talks about is done--what's to become of the King, and the Royal
Family, and all the Big Pots?'''Ear, 'ear,' cried Crass, eagerly--and Ned Dawson and the man behind
the moat both said that that was what they would like to know, too.'I am much more concerned about what is to become of ourselves if these
things are not done,' replied Barrington.'I think we should try to
cultivate a little more respect of our own families and to concern
ourselves a little less about "Royal" Families.I fail to see any
reason why we should worry ourselves about those people; they're all
right--they have all they need, and as far as I am aware, nobody wishes
to harm them and they are well able to look after themselves.They will
fare the same as the other rich people.''I should like to ask,' said Harlow, 'wot's to become of all the gold
and silver and copper money?Wouldn't it be of no use at all?''It would be of far more use under Socialism than it is at present.The
State would of course become possessed of a large quantity of it in the
early stages of the development of the Socialist system, because--at
first--while the State would be paying all its officers and productive
workers in paper, the rest of the community--those not in State
employ--would be paying their taxes in gold as at present.All
travellers on the State railways--other than State employees--would pay
their fares in metal money, and gold and silver would pour into the
State Treasury from many other sources.The State would receive gold
and silver and--for the most part--pay out paper.By the time the
system of State employment was fully established, gold and silver would
only be of value as metal and the State would purchase it from whoever
possessed and wished to sell it--at so much per pound as raw material:
instead of hiding it away in the vaults of banks, or locking it up in
iron safes, we shall make use of it.Some of the gold will be
manufactured into articles of jewellery, to be sold for paper money and
worn by the sweethearts and wives and daughters of the workers; some of
it will be beaten out into gold leaf to be used in the decoration of
the houses of the citizens and of public buildings.As for the silver,
it will be made into various articles of utility for domestic use.The
workers will not then, as now, have to eat their food with poisonous
lead or brass spoons and forks, we shall have these things of silver
and if there is not enough silver we shall probably have a
non-poisonous alloy of that metal.''As far as I can make out,' said Harlow, 'the paper money will be just
as valuable as gold and silver is now.Well, wot's to prevent artful
dodgers like old Misery and Rushton saving it up and buying and selling
things with it, and so livin' without work?''Of course,' said Crass, scornfully.'That's a very simple matter; any man who lives without doing any
useful work is living on the labour of others, he is robbing others of
part of the result of their labour.The object of Socialism is to stop
this robbery, to make it impossible.So no one will be able to hoard
up or accumulate the paper money because it will be dated, and will
become worthless if it is not spent within a certain time after its
issue.As for buying and selling for profit--from whom would they buy?'Well, they might buy some of the things the workers didn't want, for
less than the workers paid for them, and then they could sell 'em
again.''They'd have to sell them for less than the price charged at the
National Stores, and if you think about it a little you'll see that it
would not be very profitable.It would be with the object of
preventing any attempts at private trading that the Administration
would refuse to pay compensation to private owners in a lump sum.All
such compensations would be paid, as I said, in the form of a pension
of so much per year.'Another very effective way to prevent private trading would be to make
it a criminal offence against the well-being of the community.At
present many forms of business are illegal unless you take out a
licence; under Socialism no one would be allowed to trade without a
licence, and no licences would be issued.''Wouldn't a man be allowed to save up his money if he wanted to,
demanded Slyme with indignation.'There will be nothing to prevent a man going without some of the
things he might have if he is foolish enough to do so, but he would
never be able to save up enough to avoid doing his share of useful
service.Besides, what need would there be for anyone to save?One's
old age would be provided for.If one was ill the State hospitals and Medical Service would be free.As for one's children, they would attend the State Free Schools and
Colleges and when of age they would enter the State Service, their
futures provided for.Can you tell us why anyone would need or wish to
save?''While we are speaking of money,' added Barrington, 'I should like to
remind you that even under the present system there are many things
which cost money to maintain, that we enjoy without having to pay for
directly.The public roads and pavements cost money to make and
maintain and light.Under a Socialist Administration this principle will
be extended--in addition to the free services we enjoy now we shall
then maintain the trains and railways for the use of the public, free.And as time goes on, this method of doing business will be adopted in
many other directions.''I've read somewhere,' said Harlow, 'that whenever a Government in any
country has started issuing paper money it has always led to
bankruptcy.How do you know that the same thing would not happen under
a Socialist Administration?'''Ear, 'ear,' said Crass.'I was just goin' to say the same thing.''If the Government of a country began to issue large amounts of paper
money under the present system,' Barrington replied, 'it would
inevitably lead to bankruptcy, for the simple reason that paper money
under the present system--bank-notes, bank drafts, postal orders,
cheques or any other form--is merely a printed promise to pay the
amount--in gold or silver--on demand or at a certain date.Under the
present system if a Government issues more paper money than it
possesses gold and silver to redeem, it is of course bankrupt.But the
paper money that will be issued under a Socialist Administration will
not be a promise to pay in gold or silver on demand or at any time.It
will be a promise to supply commodities to the amount specified on the
note, and as there could be no dearth of those things there could be no
possibility of bankruptcy.''I should like to know who's goin' to appoint the hofficers of this
'ere hindustrial harmy,' said the man on the pail.'We don't want to
be bullied and chivied and chased about by a lot of sergeants and
corporals like a lot of soldiers, you know.'''Ear, 'ear,' said Crass.Someone's got
to be in charge of the work.''We don't have to put up with any bullying or chivying or chasing now,
do we?''So of course we could not have anything of
that sort under Socialism.We could not put up with it at all!Even
if it were only for four or five hours a day.Under the present system
we have no voice in appointing our masters and overseers and
foremen--we have no choice as to what master we shall work under.If
our masters do not treat us fairly we have no remedy against them.Under Socialism it will be different; the workers will be part of the
community; the officers or managers and foremen will be the servants of
the community, and if any one of these men were to abuse his position
he could be promptly removed.As for the details of the organization
of the Industrial Army, the difficulty is, again, not so much to devise
a way, but to decide which of many ways would be the best, and the
perfect way will probably be developed only after experiment and
experience.The one thing we have to hold fast to is the fundamental
principle of State employment or National service.The national organization of industry under
democratic control.One way of arranging this business would be for
the community to elect a Parliament in much the same way as is done at
present.The only persons eligible for election to be veterans of the
industrial Army, men and women who had put in their twenty-five years
of service.'This Administrative Body would have control of the different State
Departments.There would be a Department of Agriculture, a Department
of Railways and so on, each with its minister and staff.'All these Members of Parliament would be the relatives--in some cases
the mothers and fathers of those in the Industrial Service, and they
would be relied upon to see that the conditions of that service were
the best possible.'As for the different branches of the State Service, they could be
organized on somewhat the same lines as the different branches of the
Public Service are now--like the Navy, the Post Office and as the State
Railways in some other countries, or as are the different branches of
the Military Army, with the difference that all promotions will be from
the ranks, by examinations, and by merit only.As every recruit will
have had the same class of education they will all have absolute
equality of opportunity and the men who would attain to positions of
authority would be the best men, and not as at present, the worst.''Under the present system, the men who become masters and employers
succeed because they are cunning and selfish, not because they
understand or are capable of doing the work out of which they make
their money.Most of the employers in the building trade for instance
would be incapable of doing any skilled work.Very few of them would
be worth their salt as journeymen.The only work they do is to scheme
to reap the benefit of the labour of others.'The men who now become managers and foremen are selected not because
of their ability as craftsmen, but because they are good slave-drivers
and useful producers of profit for their employers.''How are you goin' to prevent the selfish and cunnin', as you call 'em,
from gettin' on top THEN as they do now?''The fact that all workers will receive the same pay, no matter what
class of work they are engaged in, or what their position, will ensure
our getting the very best man to do all the higher work and to organize
our business.''Yes: there will be such an enormous quantity of everything produced,
that their wages will enable everyone to purchase abundance of
everything they require.Even if some were paid more than others they
would not be able to spend it.There would be no need to save it, and
as there will be no starving poor, there will be no one to give it away
to.If it were possible to save and accumulate money it would bring
into being an idle class, living on their fellows: it would lead to the
downfall of our system, and a return to the same anarchy that exists at
present.Besides, if higher wages were paid to those engaged in the
higher work or occupying positions of authority it would prevent our
getting the best men.Unfit persons would try for the positions
because of the higher pay.Under the present
system men intrigue for and obtain or are pitchforked into positions
for which they have no natural ability at all; the only reason they
desire these positions is because of the salaries attached to them.These fellows get the money and the work is done by underpaid
subordinates whom the world never hears of.Under Socialism, this money
incentive will be done away with, and consequently the only men who
will try for these positions will be those who, being naturally fitted
for the work, would like to do it.For instance a man who is a born
organizer will not refuse to undertake such work because he will not be
paid more for it.Such a man will desire to do it and will esteem it a
privilege to be allowed to do it.To think out
all the details of some undertaking, to plan and scheme and organize,
is not work for a man like that.But for a man who
has sought and secured such a position, not because he liked the work,
but because he liked the salary--such work as this would be unpleasant
labour.Under Socialism the unfit man would not apply for that post but
would strive after some other for which he was fit and which he would
therefore desire and enjoy.There are some men who would rather have
charge of and organize and be responsible for work than do it with
their hands.There are others who would rather do delicate or
difficult or artistic work, than plain work.A man who is a born
artist would rather paint a frieze or a picture or carve a statue than
he would do plain work, or take charge of and direct the labour of
others.And there are another sort of men who would rather do ordinary
plain work than take charge, or attempt higher branches for which they
have neither liking or natural talent.'But there is one thing--a most important point that you seem to
entirely lose sight of, and that is, that all these different kinds and
classes are equal in one respect--THEY ARE ALL EQUALLY NECESSARY.Each
is a necessary and indispensable part of the whole; therefore everyone
who has done his full share of necessary work is justly entitled to a
full share of the results.The men who put the slates on are just as
indispensable as the men who lay the foundations.The work of the men
who build the walls and make the doors is just as necessary as the work
of the men who decorate the cornice.None of them would be of much use
without the architect, and the plans of the architect would come to
nothing, his building would be a mere castle in the air, if it were not
for the other workers.Each part of the work is equally necessary,
useful and indispensable if the building is to be perfected.Some of
these men work harder with their brains than with their hands and some
work harder with their hands than with their brains, BUT EACH ONE DOES
HIS FULL SHARE OF THE WORK.This truth will be recognized and acted
upon by those who build up and maintain the fabric of our Co-operative
Commonwealth.Every man who does his full share of the useful and
necessary work according to his abilities shall have his full share of
the total result.Herein will be its great difference from the present
system, under which it is possible for the cunning and selfish ones to
take advantage of the simplicity of others and rob them of part of the
fruits of their labour.As for those who will be engaged in the higher
branches, they will be sufficiently rewarded by being privileged to do
the work they are fitted for and enjoy.The only men and women who are
capable of good and great work of any kind are those who, being
naturally fit for it, love the work for its own sake and not for the
money it brings them.Under the present system, many men who have no
need of money produce great works, not for gain but for pleasure: their
wealth enables them to follow their natural inclinations.Under the
present system many men and women capable of great works are prevented
from giving expression to their powers by poverty and lack of
opportunity: they live in sorrow and die heartbroken, and the community
is the loser.These are the men and women who will be our artists,
sculptors, architects, engineers and captains of industry.'Under the present system there are men at the head of affairs whose
only object is the accumulation of money.Some of them possess great
abilities and the system has practically compelled them to employ those
abilities for their own selfish ends to the hurt of the community.Some of them have built up great fortunes out of the sweat and blood
and tears of men and women and little children.For those who delight
in such work as this, there will be no place in our Co-operative
Commonwealth.''If there won't be no extry pay and if anybody
will have all they need for just doing their part of the work, what
encouragement will there be for anyone to worry his brains out trying
to invent some new machine, or make some new discovery?''Well,' said Barrington, 'I think that's covered by the last answer,
but if it were found necessary--which is highly improbable--to offer
some material reward in addition to the respect, esteem or honour that
would be enjoyed by the author of an invention that was a boon to the
community, it could be arranged by allowing him to retire before the
expiration of his twenty-five years service.The boon he had conferred
on the community by the invention, would be considered equivalent to so
many years work.But a man like that would not desire to cease
working; that sort go on working all their lives, for love.He is one of the very few inventors who have made
money out of their work; he is a rich man, but the only use his wealth
seems to be to him is to procure himself facilities for going on with
his work; his life is a round of what some people would call painful
labour: but it is not painful labour to him; it's just pleasure, he
works for the love of it.Another way would be to absolve a man of
that sort from the necessity of ordinary work, so as to give him a
chance to get on with other inventions.It would be to the interests
of the community to encourage him in every way and to place materials
and facilities at his disposal.'But you must remember that even under the present system, Honour and
Praise are held to be greater than money.How many soldiers would
prefer money to the honour of wearing the intrinsically valueless
Victoria Cross?'Even now men think less of money than they do of the respect, esteem
or honour they are able to procure with it.Many men spend the greater
part of their lives striving to accumulate money, and when they have
succeeded, they proceed to spend it to obtain the respect of their
fellow-men.Some of them spend thousands of pounds for the honour of
being able to write "MP" after their names.Others
pay huge sums to gain admission to exclusive circles of society.Others give the money away in charity, or found libraries or
universities.The reason they do these things is that they desire to
be applauded and honoured by their fellow-men.'This desire is strongest in the most capable men--the men of genius.Therefore, under Socialism the principal incentive to great work will
be the same as now--Honour and Praise.But, under the present system,
Honour and Praise can be bought with money, and it does not matter much
how the money was obtained.The Cross of Honour and the
Laurel Crown will not be bought and sold for filthy lucre.They will
be the supreme rewards of Virtue and of Talent.''What would you do with them what spends all their money in drink?''I might reasonably ask you, "What's done with them or what you propose
to do with them now?"There are many men and women whose lives are so
full of toil and sorrow and the misery caused by abject poverty, who
are so shut out from all that makes life worth living, that the time
they spend in the public house is the only ray of sunshine in their
cheerless lives.Their mental and material poverty is so great that
they are deprived of and incapable of understanding the intellectual
and social pleasures of civilization...  Under Socialism there will be
no such class as this.Everyone will be educated, and social life and
rational pleasure will be within the reach of all.Therefore we do not
believe that there will be such a class.Any individuals who abandoned
themselves to such a course would be avoided by their fellows; but if
they became very degraded, we should still remember that they were our
brother men and women, and we should regard them as suffering from a
disease inherited from their uncivilized forefathers and try to cure
them by placing them under some restraint: in an institute for
instance.''Another good way to deal with 'em,' said Harlow, 'would be to allow
them double pay, so as they could drink themselves to death.We could
do without the likes of them.''Call the next case,' said Philpot.'This 'ere abundance that you're always talking about,' said Crass, you
can't be sure that it would be possible to produce all that.You're
only assoomin' that it could be done.'Barrington pointed to the still visible outlines of the 'Hoblong' that
Owen had drawn on the wall to illustrate a previous lecture.'Even under the present silly system of restricted production, with the
majority of the population engaged in useless, unproductive,
unnecessary work, and large numbers never doing any work at all, there
is enough produced to go all round after a fashion.More than enough,
for in consequence of what they call "Over-Production", the markets are
periodically glutted with commodities of all kinds, and then for a time
the factories are closed and production ceases.And yet we can all
manage to exist--after a fashion.This proves that if productive
industry were organized on the lines advocated by Socialists there
could be produced such a prodigious quantity of everything, that
everyone could live in plenty and comfort.The problem of how to
produce sufficient for all to enjoy abundance is already solved: the
problem that then remains is--How to get rid of those whose greed and
callous indifference to the sufferings of others, prevents it being
done.'and you'll never be able to get rid of 'em, mate,' cried Crass,
triumphantly--and the man with the copper wire stitches in his boot
said that it couldn't be done.'Well, we mean to have a good try, anyhow,' said Barrington.Crass and most of the others tried hard to think of something to say in
defence of the existing state of affairs, or against the proposals put
forward by the lecturer; but finding nothing, they maintained a sullen
and gloomy silence.The man with the copper wire stitches in his boot
in particular appeared to be very much upset; perhaps he was afraid
that if the things advocated by the speaker ever came to pass he would
not have any boots at all.To assume that he had some such thought as
this, is the only rational way to account for his hostility, for in his
case no change could have been for the worse unless it reduced him to
almost absolute nakedness and starvation.To judge by their unwillingness to consider any proposals to alter the
present system, one might have supposed that they were afraid of losing
something, instead of having nothing to lose--except their poverty.It was not till the chairman had made several urgent appeals for more
questions that Crass brightened up: a glad smile slowly spread over and
illuminated his greasy visage: he had at last thought of a most serious
and insurmountable obstacle to the establishment of the Co-operative
Commonwealth.'What,' he demanded, in a loud voice, 'what are you goin' to do, in
this 'ere Socialist Republic of yours, with them wot WON'T WORK'!'As Crass flung this bombshell into the Socialist camp, the miserable,
ragged-trousered crew around him could scarce forbear a cheer; but the
more intelligent part of the audience only laughed.'We don't believe that there will be any such people as that,' said
Barrington.'There's plenty of 'em about now, anyway,' sneered Crass.'You can't change 'uman nature, you know,' cried the man behind the
moat, and the one who had the copper wire stitches in his boot laughed
scornfully.'Yes, I know there are plenty such now,' rejoined Barrington.'It's
only what is to be expected, considering that practically all workers
live in poverty, and are regarded with contempt.The conditions under
which most of the work is done at present are so unpleasant and
degrading that everyone refuses to do any unless they are compelled;
none of us here, for instance, would continue to work for Rushton if it
were not for the fact that we have either to do so or starve; and when
we do work we only just earn enough to keep body and soul together.Under the present system everybody who can possibly manage to do so
avoids doing any work, the only difference being that some people do
their loafing better than others.The aristocracy are too lazy to
work, but they seem to get on all right; they have their tenants to
work for them.Rushton is too lazy to work, so he has arranged that we
and Nimrod shall work instead, and he fares much better than any of us
who do work.Then there is another kind of loafers who go about
begging and occasionally starving rather than submit to such abominable
conditions as are offered to them.These last are generally not much
worse off than we are and they are often better off.At present,
people have everything to gain and but little to lose by refusing to
work.Under Socialism it would be just the reverse; the conditions of
labour would be so pleasant, the hours of obligatory work so few, and
the reward so great, that it is absurd to imagine that any one would be
so foolish as to incur the contempt of his fellows and make himself a
social outcast by refusing to do the small share of work demanded of
him by the community of which he was a member.'As for what we should do to such individuals if there did happen to be
some, I can assure you that we would not treat them as you treat them
now.We would not dress them up in silk and satin and broadcloth and
fine linen: we would not embellish them, as you do, with jewels of gold
and jewels of silver and with precious stones; neither should we allow
them to fare sumptuously every day.Our method of dealing with them
would be quite different from yours.In the Co-operative Commonwealth
there will be no place for loafers; whether they call themselves
aristocrats or tramps, those who are too lazy to work shall have no
share in the things that are produced by the labour of others.If any man will not work, neither
shall he eat.Under the present system a man who is really too lazy to
work may stop you in the street and tell you that he cannot get
employment.For all you know, he may be telling the truth, and if you
have any feeling and are able, you will help him.But in the Socialist
State no one would have such an excuse, because everyone that was
willing would be welcome to come and help in the work of producing
wealth and happiness for all, and afterwards he would also be welcome
to his full share of the results.'inquired the chairman, breaking the gloomy
silence that followed.'I don't want anyone to think that I am blaming any of these
present-day loafers,' Barrington added.'The wealthy ones cannot be
expected voluntarily to come and work under existing conditions and if
they were to do so they would be doing more harm than good--they would
be doing some poor wretches out of employment.They are not to be
blamed; the people who are to blame are the working classes themselves,
who demand and vote for the continuance of the present system.As for
the other class of loafers--those at the bottom, the tramps and people
of that sort, if they were to become sober and industrious tomorrow,
they also would be doing more harm than good to the other workers; it
would increase the competition for work.If all the loafers in
Mugsborough could suddenly be transformed into decent house painters
next week, Nimrod might be able to cut down the wages another penny an
hour.I don't wish to speak disrespectfully of these tramps at all.Some of them are such simply because they would rather starve than
submit to the degrading conditions that we submit to, they do not see
the force of being bullied and chased, and driven about in order to
gain semi-starvation and rags.They are able to get those without
working; and I sometimes think that they are more worthy of respect and
are altogether a nobler type of beings than a lot of broken-spirited
wretches like ourselves, who are always at the mercy of our masters,
and always in dread of the sack.''Do you mean to say as the time will ever come when the gentry will mix
up on equal terms with the likes of us?'demanded the man behind the
moat, scornfully.When we get Socialism there won't be
any people like us.The man behind the moat did not seem very satisfied with this answer,
and told the others that he could not see anything to laugh at.'Now is your chance to
get some of your own back, but don't hall speak at once.''I should like to know who's goin' to do all the dirty work?''If everyone is to be allowed to choose 'is own trade, who'd be
fool enough to choose to be a scavenger, a sweep, a dustman or a sewer
man?nobody wouldn't want to do such jobs as them and everyone would be
after the soft jobs.''Of course,' cried Crass, eagerly clutching at this last straw.'The
thing sounds all right till you comes to look into it, but it wouldn't
never work!''It would be very easy to deal with any difficulty of that sort,'
replied Barrington, 'if it were found that too many people were
desirous of pursuing certain callings, it would be known that the
conditions attached to those kinds of work were unfairly easy, as
compared with other lines, so the conditions in those trades would be
made more severe.If we
found that too many persons wished to be doctors, architects, engineers
and so forth, we would increase the severity of the examinations.This
would scare away all but the most gifted and enthusiastic.We should
thus at one stroke reduce the number of applicants and secure the very
best men for the work--we should have better doctors, better
architects, better engineers than before.'As regards those disagreeable tasks for which there was a difficulty
in obtaining volunteers, we should adopt the opposite means.Suppose
that six hours was the general thing; and we found that we could not
get any sewer men; we should reduce the hours of labour in that
department to four, or if necessary to two, in order to compensate for
the disagreeable nature of the work.'Another way out of such difficulties would be to have a separate
division of the Industrial army to do all such work, and to make it
obligatory for every man to put in his first year of State service as a
member of this corps.Everyone
gets the benefit of such work; there would be no injustice in requiring
everyone to share.This would have the effect also of stimulating
invention; it would be to everyone's interest to think out means of
doing away with such kinds of work and there is no doubt that most of
it will be done by machinery in some way or other.A few years ago the
only way to light up the streets of a town was to go round to each
separate gas lamp and light each jet, one at a time: now, we press a
few buttons and light up the town with electricity.In the future we
shall probably be able to press a button and flush the sewers.''I suppose there won't be no
churches nor chapels; we shall all have to be atheists.''Everybody will be perfectly free to enjoy their own opinions and to
practise any religion they like; but no religion or sect will be
maintained by the State.If any congregation or body of people wish to
have a building for their own exclusive use as a church or chapel or
lecture hall it will be supplied to them by the State on the same terms
as those upon which dwelling houses will be supplied; the State will
construct the special kind of building and the congregation will have
to pay the rent, the amount to be based on the cost of construction, in
paper money of course.As far as the embellishment or decoration of
such places is concerned, there will of course be nothing to prevent
the members of the congregation if they wish from doing any such work
as that themselves in their own spare time of which they will have
plenty.''If everybody's got to do their share of work, where's the minister and
clergymen to come from?''There are at least three ways out of that difficulty.First,
ministers of religion could be drawn from the ranks of the
Veterans--men over forty-five years old who had completed their term of
State service.You must remember that these will not be worn out
wrecks, as too many of the working classes are at that age now.They
will have had good food and clothing and good general conditions all
their lives; and consequently they will be in the very prime of life.They will be younger than many of us now are at thirty; they will be
ideal men for the positions we are speaking of.All well educated in
their youth, and all will have had plenty of leisure for self culture
during the years of their State service and they will have the
additional recommendation that their congregation will not be required
to pay anything for their services.'Another way: If a congregation wished to retain the full-time services
of a young man whom they thought specially gifted but who had not
completed his term of State service, they could secure him by paying
the State for his services; thus the young man would still remain in
State employment, he would still continue to receive his pay from the
National Treasury, and at the age of forty-five would be entitled to
his pension like any other worker, and after that the congregation
would not have to pay the State anything.'A third--and as it seems to me, the most respectable way--would be for
the individual in question to act as minister or pastor or lecturer or
whatever it was, to the congregation without seeking to get out of
doing his share of the State service.The hours of obligatory work
would be so short and the work so light that he would have abundance of
leisure to prepare his orations without sponging on his
co-religionists.''Of course,' added Barrington, 'it would not only be congregations of
Christians who could adopt any of these methods.It is possible that a
congregation of agnostics, for instance, might want a separate building
or to maintain a lecturer.''What the 'ell's an agnostic?''An agnostic,' said the man behind the moat, 'is a bloke wot don't
believe nothing unless 'e see it with 'is own eyes.''All these details,' continued the speaker, 'of the organization of
affairs and the work of the Co-operative Commonwealth, are things which
do not concern us at all.They have merely been suggested by different
individuals as showing some ways in which these things could be
arranged.The exact methods to be adopted will be decided upon by the
opinion of the majority when the work is being done.Meantime, what we
have to do is to insist upon the duty of the State to provide
productive work for the unemployed, the State feeding of
schoolchildren, the nationalization or Socialization of Railways; Land;
the Trusts, and all public services that are still in the hands of
private companies.If you wish to see these things done, you must
cease from voting for Liberal and Tory sweaters, shareholders of
companies, lawyers, aristocrats, and capitalists; and you must fill the
House of Commons with Revolutionary Socialists.That is--with men who
are in favour of completely changing the present system.And in the
day that you do that, you will have solved the poverty "problem".No
more tramping the streets begging for a job!No more women and
children killing themselves with painful labour whilst strong men stand
idly by; but joyous work and joyous leisure for all.''Is it true,' said Easton, 'that Socialists intend to do away with the
Army and Navy?'Socialists believe in International Brotherhood and
peace.Nearly all wars are caused by profit-seeking capitalists,
seeking new fields for commercial exploitation, and by aristocrats who
make it the means of glorifying themselves in the eyes of the deluded
common people.You must remember that Socialism is not only a
national, but an international movement and when it is realized, there
will be no possibility of war, and we shall no longer need to maintain
an army and navy, or to waste a lot of labour building warships or
manufacturing arms and ammunition.All those people who are now
employed will then be at liberty to assist in the great work of
producing the benefits of civilization; creating wealth and knowledge
and happiness for themselves and others--Socialism means Peace on earth
and goodwill to all mankind.But in the meantime we know that the
people of other nations are not yet all Socialists; we do not forget
that in foreign countries--just the same as in Britain--there are large
numbers of profit seeking capitalists, who are so destitute of
humanity, that if they thought it could be done successfully and with
profit to themselves they would not scruple to come here to murder and
to rob.We do not forget that in foreign countries--the same as
here--there are plenty of so-called "Christian" bishops and priests
always ready to give their benediction to any such murderous projects,
and to blasphemously pray to the Supreme Being to help his children to
slay each other like wild beasts.And knowing and remembering all
this, we realize that until we have done away with capitalism,
aristocracy and anti-Christian clericalism, it is our duty to be
prepared to defend our homes and our native land.And therefore we are
in favour of maintaining national defensive forces in the highest
possible state of efficiency.But that does not mean that we are in
favour of the present system of organizing those forces.We do not
believe in conscription, and we do not believe that the nation should
continue to maintain a professional standing army to be used at home
for the purpose of butchering men and women of the working classes in
the interests of a handful of capitalists, as has been done at
Featherstone and Belfast; or to be used abroad to murder and rob the
people of other nations.Socialists advocate the establishment of a
National Citizen Army, for defensive purposes only.We believe that
every able bodied man should be compelled to belong to this force and
to undergo a course of military training, but without making him into a
professional soldier, or taking him away from civil life, depriving him
of the rights of citizenship or making him subject to military "law"
which is only another name for tyranny and despotism.This Citizen
Army could be organized on somewhat similar lines to the present
Territorial Force, with certain differences.For instance, we do not
believe--as our present rulers do--that wealth and aristocratic
influence are the two most essential qualifications for an efficient
officer; we believe that all ranks should be attainable by any man, no
matter how poor, who is capable of passing the necessary examinations,
and that there should be no expense attached to those positions which
the Government grant, or the pay, is not sufficient to cover.The
officers could be appointed in any one of several ways: They might be
elected by the men they would have to command, the only qualification
required being that they had passed their examinations, or they might
be appointed according to merit--the candidate obtaining the highest
number of marks at the examinations to have the first call on any
vacant post, and so on in order of merit.We believe in the total
abolition of courts martial, any offence against discipline should be
punishable by the ordinary civil law--no member of the Citizen Army
being deprived of the rights of a citizen.''Nobody wants to interfere with the Navy except to make its
organization more democratic--the same as that of the Citizen Army--and
to protect its members from tyranny by entitling them to be tried in a
civil court for any alleged offence.'It has been proved that if the soil of this country were
scientifically cultivated, it is capable of producing sufficient to
maintain a population of a hundred millions of people.Our present
population is only about forty millions, but so long as the land
remains in the possession of persons who refuse to allow it to be
cultivated we shall continue to be dependent on other countries for our
food supply.So long as we are in that position, and so long as
foreign countries are governed by Liberal and Tory capitalists, we
shall need the Navy to protect our overseas commerce from them.If we
had a Citizen Army such as I have mentioned, of nine or ten millions of
men and if the land of this country was properly cultivated, we should
be invincible at home.No foreign power would ever be mad enough to
attempt to land their forces on our shores.But they would now be able
to starve us all to death in a month if it were not for the Navy.It's
a sensible and creditable position, isn't it?''Even in times of peace, thousands of people standing idle and tamely
starving in their own fertile country, because a few land "Lords"
forbid them to cultivate it.'demanded Philpot, breaking a prolonged
silence.'Would any Liberal or Tory capitalist like to get up into the pulpit
and oppose the speaker?'the chairman went on, finding that no one
responded to his appeal for questions.'As there's no more questions and no one won't get up into the pulpit,
it is now my painful duty to call upon someone to move a resolution.''Well, Mr Chairman,' said Harlow, 'I may say that when I came on this
firm I was a Liberal, but through listenin' to several lectures by
Professor Owen and attendin' the meetings on the hill at Windley and
reading the books and pamphlets I bought there and from Owen, I came to
the conclusion some time ago that it's a mug's game for us to vote for
capitalists whether they calls theirselves Liberals or Tories.They're
all alike when you're workin' for 'em; I defy any man to say what's the
difference between a Liberal and a Tory employer.There is none--there
can't be; they're both sweaters, and they've got to be, or they
wouldn't be able to compete with each other.And since that's what
they are, I say it's a mug's game for us to vote 'em into Parliament to
rule over us and to make laws that we've got to abide by whether we
like it or not.There's nothing to choose between 'em, and the proof of
it is that it's never made much difference to us which party was in or
which was out.It's quite true that in the past both of 'em have
passed good laws, but they've only done it when public opinion was so
strong in favour of it that they knew there was no getting out of it,
and then it was a toss up which side did it.'That's the way I've been lookin' at things lately, and I'd almost made
up my mind never to vote no more, or to trouble myself about politics
at all, because although I could see there was no sense in voting for
Liberal or Tory capitalists, at the same time I must admit I couldn't
make out how Socialism was going to help us.But the explanation of it
which Professor Barrington has given us this afternoon has been a bit
of an eye opener for me, and with your permission I should like to move
as a resolution, "That it is the opinion of this meeting that Socialism
is the only remedy for Unemployment and Poverty."'The conclusion of Harlow's address was greeted with loud cheers from
the Socialists, but most of the Liberal and Tory supporters of the
present system maintained a sulky silence.'I'll second that resolution,' said Easton.'And I'll lay a bob both ways,' remarked Bundy.The resolution was
then put, and though the majority were against it, the Chairman
declared it was carried unanimously.By this time the violence of the storm had in a great measure abated,
but as rain was still falling it was decided not to attempt to resume
work that day.Besides, it would have been too late, even if the
weather had cleared up.'P'raps it's just as well it 'as rained,' remarked one man.'If it
'adn't some of us might 'ave got the sack tonight.As it is, there'll
be hardly enough for all of us to do tomorrer and Saturday mornin' even
if it is fine.'This was true: nearly all the outside was finished, and what remained
to be done was ready for the final coat.Inside all there was to do
was to colour wash the walls and to give the woodwork of the kitchen
and scullery the last coat of paint.It was inevitable--unless the firm had some other work for them to do
somewhere else--that there would be a great slaughter on Saturday.'Now,' said Philpot, assuming what he meant to be the manner of a
school teacher addressing children, 'I wants you hall to make a
speshall heffort and get 'ere very early in the mornin'--say about four
o'clock--and them wot doos the most work tomorrer, will get a prize on
Saturday.''Yes,' replied Philpot, 'and not honly will you get a prize for good
conduck tomorrer, but if you all keep on workin' like we've bin doing
lately till you're too hold and wore hout to do any more, you'll be
allowed to go to a nice workhouse for the rest of your lives!and each
one of you will be given a title--"Pauper!"'Although the majority of them had mothers or fathers or other near
relatives who had already succeeded to the title--they laughed!As they were going home, Crass paused at the gate, and pointing up to
the large gable at the end of the house, he said to Philpot:

'You'll want the longest ladder--the 65, for that, tomorrow.'Chapter 46

The 'Sixty-five'


The next morning after breakfast, Philpot, Sawkins, Harlow and
Barrington went to the Yard to get the long ladder--the 65--so called
because it had sixty-five rungs.It was really what is known as a
builder's scaffold ladder, and it had been strengthened by several iron
bolts or rods which passed through just under some of the rungs.One
side of the ladder had an iron band or ribbon twisted and nailed round
it spirally.It was not at all suitable for painters' work, being
altogether too heavy and cumbrous.However, as none of the others were
long enough to reach the high gable at the Refuge, they managed, with a
struggle, to get it down from the hooks and put it on one of the
handcarts and soon passed through the streets of mean and dingy houses
in the vicinity of the yard, and began the ascent of the long hill.There had been a lot of rain during the night, and the sky was still
overcast with dark grey clouds.The cart went heavily over the muddy
road; Sawkins was at the helm, holding the end of the ladder and
steering; the others walked a little further ahead, at the sides of the
cart.It was such hard work that by the time they were half-way up the hill
they were so exhausted and out of breath that they had to stop for a
rest.'This is a bit of all right, ain't it?'remarked Harlow as he took off
his cap and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his handkerchief.While they rested they kept a good look out for Rushton or Hunter, who
were likely to pass by at any moment.At first, no one made any reply to Harlow's observation, for they were
all out of breath and Philpot's lean fingers trembled violently as he
wiped the perspiration from his face.'Yes, mate,' he said despondently, after a while.'It's one way of
gettin' a livin' and there's plenty better ways.'In addition to the fact that his rheumatism was exceptionally bad, he
felt unusually low-spirited this morning; the gloomy weather and the
prospect of a long day of ladder work probably had something to do with
it.'A "living" is right,' said Barrington bitterly.He also was exhausted
with the struggle up the hill and enraged by the woebegone appearance
of poor old Philpot, who was panting and quivering from the exertion.The unaccountable depression that
possessed Philpot deprived him of all his usual jocularity and filled
him with melancholy thoughts.He had travelled up and down this hill a
great many times before under similar circumstances and he said to
himself that if he had half a quid now for every time he had pushed a
cart up this road, he wouldn't need to do anyone out of a job all the
rest of his life.The shop where he had been apprenticed used to be just down at the
bottom; the place had been pulled down years ago, and the ground was
now occupied by more pretentious buildings.Not quite so far down the
road--on the other side--he could see the church where he used to
attend Sunday School when he was a boy, and where he was married just
thirty years ago.Presently--when they reached the top of the hill--he
would be able to look across the valley and see the spire of the other
church, the one in the graveyard, where all those who were dear to him
had been one by one laid to rest.He felt that he would not be sorry
when the time came to join them there.Possibly, in the next world--if
there were such a place--they might all be together once more.He was suddenly aroused from these thoughts by an exclamation from
Harlow.Rushton was coming up the hill
in his dog-cart with Grinder sitting by his side.They passed so
closely that Philpot--who was on that side of the cart--was splashed
with mud from the wheels of the trap.'Them's some of your chaps, ain't they?''We're doing a job up this way.''I should 'ave thought it would pay you better to use a 'orse for sich
work as that,' said Grinder.'We do use the horses whenever it's necessary for very big loads, you
know,' answered Rushton, and added with a laugh: 'But the donkeys are
quite strong enough for such a job as that.'The 'donkeys' struggled on up the hill for about another hundred yards
and then they were forced to halt again.'We mustn't stop long, you know,' said Harlow.'Most likely he's gone
to the job, and he'll wait to see how long it takes us to get there.'Barrington felt inclined to say that in that case Rushton would have to
wait, but he remained silent, for he remembered that although he
personally did not care a brass button whether he got the sack or not,
the others were not so fortunately circumstanced.While they were resting, another two-legged donkey passed by pushing
another cart--or rather, holding it back, for he was coming slowly down
the hill.Another Heir of all the ages--another Imperialist--a
degraded, brutalized wretch, clad in filthy, stinking rags, his toes
protruding from the rotten broken boots that were tied with bits of
string upon his stockingless feet.The ramshackle cart was loaded with
empty bottles and putrid rags, heaped loosely in the cart and packed
into a large sack.Old coats and trousers, dresses, petticoats, and
under-clothing, greasy, mildewed and malodorous.As he crept along
with his eyes on the ground, the man gave utterance at intervals to
uncouth, inarticulate sounds.'That's another way of gettin' a livin',' said Sawkins with a laugh as
the miserable creature slunk past.Harlow also laughed, and Barrington regarded them curiously.He
thought it strange that they did not seem to realize that they might
some day become like this man themselves.'I've often wondered what they does with all them dirty old rags,' said
Philpot.'Made into paper,' replied Harlow, briefly.'Some of them are,' said Barrington, 'and some are manufactured into
shoddy cloth and made into Sunday clothes for working men.'There's all sorts of different ways of gettin' a livin',' remarked
Sawkins, after a pause.'I read in a paper the other day about a bloke
wot goes about lookin' for open trap doors and cellar flaps in front of
shops.As soon as he spotted one open, he used to go and fall down in
it; and then he'd be took to the 'orspital, and when he got better he
used to go and threaten to bring a action against the shop-keeper and
get damages, and most of 'em used to part up without goin' in front of
the judge at all.But one day a slop was a watchin' of 'im, and seen
'im chuck 'isself down one, and when they picked 'im up they found he'd
broke his leg.So they took 'im to the 'orspital and when he came out
and went round to the shop and started talkin' about bringin' a action
for damages, the slop collared 'im and they give 'im six months.''Yes, I read about that,' said Harlow, 'and there was another case of a
chap who was run over by a motor, and they tried to make out as 'e put
'isself in the way on purpose; but 'e got some money out of the swell
it belonged to; a 'undered pound I think it was.''I only wish as one of their motors would run inter me,' said Philpot,
making a feeble attempt at a joke.'I lay I'd get some a' me own back
out of 'em.'The others laughed, and Harlow was about to make some reply but at that
moment a cyclist appeared coming down the hill from the direction of
the job.It was Nimrod, so they resumed their journey once more and
presently Hunter shot past on his machine without taking any notice of
them...

When they arrived they found that Rushton had not been there at all,
but Nimrod had.Crass said that he had kicked up no end of a row
because they had not called at the yard at six o'clock that morning for
the ladder, instead of going for it after breakfast--making two
journeys instead of one, and he had also been ratty because the big
gable had not been started the first thing that morning.They carried the ladder into the garden and laid it on the ground along
the side of the house where the gable was.A brick wall about eight
feet high separated the grounds of 'The Refuge' from those of the
premises next door.Between this wall and the side wall of the house
was a space about six feet wide and this space formed a kind of alley
or lane or passage along the side of the house.They laid the ladder
on the ground along this passage, the 'foot' was placed about half-way
through; just under the centre of the gable, and as it lay there, the
other end of the ladder reached right out to the front railings.Next, it was necessary that two men should go up into the attic--the
window of which was just under the point of the gable--and drop the end
of a long rope down to the others who would tie it to the top of the
ladder.Then two men would stand on the bottom rung, so as to keep the
'foot' down, and the three others would have to raise the ladder up,
while the two men up in the attic hauled on the rope.They called Bundy and his mate Ned Dawson to help, and it was arranged
that Harlow and Crass should stand on the foot because they were the
heaviest.Philpot, Bundy, and Barrington were to 'raise', and Dawson
and Sawkins were to go up to the attic and haul on the rope.None of them had thought of bringing
one from the yard.'Why, ain't there one 'ere?''Do you
mean to say as you ain't brought one, then?'Philpot stammered out something about having thought there was one at
the house already, and the others said they had not thought about it at
all.'Well, what the bloody hell are we to do now?''I'll go to the yard and get one,' suggested Barrington.'I can do it
in twenty minutes there and back.'and a bloody fine row there'd be if Hunter was to see you!'Ere
it's nearly ten o'clock and we ain't made a start on this gable wot we
ought to 'ave started first thing this morning.''Couldn't we tie two or three of those short ropes together?''Those that the other two ladders was spliced with?'As there was sure to be a row if they delayed long enough to send to
the yard, it was decided to act on Philpot's suggestion.Several of the short ropes were accordingly tied together but upon
examination it was found that some parts were so weak that even Crass
had to admit it would be dangerous to attempt to haul the heavy ladder
up with them.'Well, the only thing as I can see for it,' he said, 'is that the boy
will 'ave to go down to the yard and get the long rope.It won't do
for anyone else to go: there's been one row already about the waste of
time because we didn't call at the yard for the ladder at six o'clock.'Bert was down in the basement of the house limewashing a cellar.Crass
called him up and gave him the necessary instructions, chief of which
was to get back again as soon as ever he could.The boy ran off, and
while they were waiting for him to come back the others went on with
their several jobs.Philpot returned to the small gable he had been
painting before breakfast, which he had not quite finished.As he
worked a sudden and unaccountable terror took possession of him.He did
not want to do that other gable; he felt too ill; and he almost
resolved that he would ask Crass if he would mind letting him do
something else.There were several younger men who would not object to
doing it--it would be mere child's play to them, and Barrington had
already--yesterday--offered to change jobs with him.But then, when he thought of what the probable consequences would be,
he hesitated to take that course, and tried to persuade himself that he
would be able to get through with the work all right.He did not want
Crass or Hunter to mark him as being too old for ladder work.Bert came back in about half an hour flushed and sweating with the
weight of the rope and with the speed he had made.He delivered it to
Crass and then returned to his cellar and went on with the limewashing,
while Crass passed the word for Philpot and the others to come and
raise the ladder.He handed the rope to Ned Dawson, who took it up to
the attic, accompanied by Sawkins; arrived there they lowered one end
out of the window down to the others.'If you ask me,' said Ned Dawson, who was critically examining the
strands of the rope as he passed it out through the open window, 'If
you ask me, I don't see as this is much better than the one we made up
by tyin' the short pieces together.Look 'ere,'--he indicated a part
of the rope that was very frayed and worn--'and 'ere's another place
just as bad.''Well, for Christ's sake don't say nothing about it now,' replied
Sawkins.'There's been enough talk and waste of time over this job
already.'Ned made no answer and the end having by this time reached the ground,
Bundy made it fast to the ladder, about six rungs from the top.The ladder was lying on the ground, parallel to the side of the house.The task of raising it would have been much easier if they had been
able to lay it at right angles to the house wall, but this was
impossible because of the premises next door and the garden wall
between the two houses.On account of its having to be raised in this
manner the men at the top would not be able to get a straight pull on
the rope; they would have to stand back in the room without being able
to see the ladder, and the rope would have to be drawn round the corner
of the window, rasping against the edge of the stone sill and the
brickwork.The end of the rope having been made fast to the top of the ladder,
Crass and Harlow stood on the foot and the other three raised the top
from the ground; as Barrington was the tallest, he took the middle
position--underneath the ladder--grasping the rungs, Philpot being on
his left and Bundy on his right, each holding one side of the ladder.At a signal from Crass, Dawson and Sawkins began to haul on the rope,
and the top of the ladder began to rise slowly into the air.Philpot was not of much use at this work, which made it all the harder
for the other two who were lifting, besides putting an extra strain on
the rope.His lack of strength, and the efforts of Barrington and
Bundy to make up for him caused the ladder to sway from side to side,
as it would not have done if they had all been equally capable.Meanwhile, upstairs, Dawson and Sawkins--although the ladder was as yet
only a little more than half the way up--noticed, as they hauled and
strained on the rope, that it had worn a groove for itself in the
corner of the brickwork at the side of the window; and every now and
then, although they pulled with all their strength, they were not able
to draw in any part of the rope at all; and it seemed to them as if
those others down below must have let go their hold altogether, or
ceased lifting.The three men found the weight so
overpowering, that once or twice they were compelled to relax their
efforts for a few seconds, and at those times the rope had to carry the
whole weight of the ladder; and the part of the rope that had to bear
the greatest strain was the part that chanced to be at the angle of the
brickwork at the side of the window.And presently it happened that
one of the frayed and worn places that Dawson had remarked about was
just at the angle during one of those momentary pauses.On one end
there hung the ponderous ladder, straining the frayed rope against the
corner of the brickwork and the sharp edge of the stone sill, at the
other end were Dawson and Sawkins pulling with all their strength, and
in that instant the rope snapped like a piece of thread.One end
remained in the hands of Sawkins and Dawson, who reeled backwards into
the room, and the other end flew up into the air, writhing like the
lash of a gigantic whip.For a moment the heavy ladder swayed from
side to side: Barrington, standing underneath, with his hands raised
above his head grasping one of the rungs, struggled desperately to hold
it up.At his right stood Bundy, also with arms upraised holding the
side; and on the left, between the ladder and the wall, was Philpot.For a brief space they strove fiercely to support the overpowering
weight, but Philpot had no strength, and the ladder, swaying over to
the left, crashed down, crushing him upon the ground and against the
wall of the house.He fell face downwards, with the ladder across his
shoulders; the side that had the iron bands twisted round it fell
across the back of his neck, forcing his face against the bricks at the
base of the wall.He uttered no cry and was quite still, with blood
streaming from the cuts on his face and trickling from his ears.Barrington was also hurled to the ground with his head and arms under
the ladder; his head and face were cut and bleeding and he was
unconscious; none of the others was hurt, for they had all had time to
jump clear when the ladder fell.Their shouts soon brought all the
other men running to the spot, and the ladder was quickly lifted off
the two motionless figures.At first it seemed that Philpot was dead,
but Easton rushed off for a neighbouring doctor, who came in a few
minutes.He knelt down and carefully examined the crushed and motionless form of
Philpot, while the other men stood by in terrified silence.Barrington, who fortunately was but momentarily stunned was sitting
against the wall and had suffered nothing more serious than minor cuts
and bruises.The doctor's examination of Philpot was a very brief one, and when he
rose from his knees, even before he spoke they knew from his manner
that their worst fears were realized.Chapter 47

The Ghouls


Barrington did not do any more work that day, but before going home he
went to the doctor's house and the latter dressed the cuts on his head
and arms.Philpot's body was taken away on the ambulance to the
mortuary.Hunter arrived at the house shortly afterwards and at once began to
shout and bully because the painting of the gable was not yet
commenced.When he heard of the accident he blamed them for using the
rope, and said they should have asked for a new one.Before he went
away he had a long, private conversation with Crass, who told him that
Philpot had no relatives and that his life was insured for ten pounds
in a society of which Crass was also a member.He knew that Philpot
had arranged that in the event of his death the money was to be paid to
the old woman with whom he lodged, who was a very close friend.The
result of this confidential talk was that Crass and Hunter came to the
conclusion that it was probable that she would be very glad to be
relieved of the trouble of attending to the business of the funeral,
and that Crass, as a close friend of the dead man, and a fellow member
of the society, was the most suitable person to take charge of the
business for her.He was already slightly acquainted with the old
lady, so he would go to see her at once and get her authority to act on
her behalf.Of course, they would not be able to do much until after
the inquest, but they could get the coffin made--as Hunter knew the
mortuary keeper there would be no difficulty about getting in for a
minute to measure the corpse.This matter having been arranged, Hunter departed to order a new rope,
and shortly afterwards Crass--having made sure that everyone would have
plenty to do while he was gone--quietly slipped away to go to see
Philpot's landlady.He went off so secretly that the men did not know
that he had been away at all until they saw him come back just before
twelve o'clock.The new rope was brought to the house about one o'clock and this time
the ladder was raised without any mishap.Harlow was put on to paint
the gable, and he felt so nervous that he was allowed to have Sawkins
to stand by and hold the ladder all the time.Everyone felt nervous
that afternoon, and they all went about their work in an unusually
careful manner.When Bert had finished limewashing the cellar, Crass set him to work
outside, painting the gate of the side entrance.While the boy was
thus occupied he was accosted by a solemn-looking man who asked him
about the accident.The solemn stranger was very sympathetic and
inquired what was the name of the man who had been killed, and whether
he was married.Bert informed him that Philpot was a widower, and that
he had no children.'Ah, well, that's so much the better, isn't it?'said the stranger
shaking his head mournfully.'It's a dreadful thing, you know, when
there's children left unprovided for.You don't happen to know where
he lived, do you?''Yes,' said Bert, mentioning the address and beginning to wonder what
the solemn man wanted to know for, and why he appeared to be so sorry
for Philpot since it was quite evident that he had never known him.'Thanks very much,' said the man, pulling out his pocket-book and
making a note of it.'Good afternoon, sir,' said Bert and he turned to resume his work.Crass came along the garden just as the mysterious stranger was
disappearing round the corner.said Crass, who had seen the man talking to Bert.'I don't know exactly; he was asking about the accident, and whether
Joe left any children, and where he lived.He must be a very decent
sort of chap, I should think.'Don't
you know who he is?''No,' replied the boy; 'but I thought p'raps he was a reporter of some
paper.''E ain't no reporter: that's old Snatchum the undertaker.'E's
smellin' round after a job; but 'e's out of it this time, smart as 'e
thinks 'e is.'Barrington came back the next morning to work, and at breakfast-time
there was a lot of talk about the accident.They said that it was all
very well for Hunter to talk like that about the rope, but he had known
for a long time that it was nearly worn out.Newman said that only
about three weeks previously when they were raising a ladder at another
job he had shown the rope to him, and Misery had replied that there was
nothing wrong with it.Several others besides Newman claimed to have
mentioned the matter to Hunter, and each of them said he had received
the same sort of reply.But when Barrington suggested that they should
attend the inquest and give evidence to that effect, they all became
suddenly silent and in a conversation Barrington afterwards had with
Newman the latter pointed out that if he were to do so, it would do no
good to Philpot.It would not bring him back but it would be sure to
do himself a lot of harm.He would never get another job at Rushton's
and probably many of the other employers would'mark him' as well.'So if YOU say anything about it,' concluded Newman, 'don't bring my
name into it.'Barrington was constrained to admit that all things considered it was
right for Newman to mind his own business.He felt that it would not
be fair to urge him or anyone else to do or say anything that would
injure themselves.Misery came to the house about eleven o'clock and informed several of
the hands that as work was very slack they would get their back day at
pay time.He said that the firm had tendered for one or two jobs, so
they could call round about Wednesday and perhaps he might then be able
to give some of them another start, Barrington was not one of those who
were'stood off', although he had expected to be on account of the
speech he had made at the Beano, and everyone said that he would have
got the push sure enough if it had not been for the accident.Before he went away, Nimrod instructed Owen and Crass to go to the yard
at once: they would there find Payne the carpenter, who was making
Philpot's coffin, which would be ready for Crass to varnish by the time
they got there.Misery told Owen that he had left the coffin plate and the instructions
with Payne and added that he was not to take too much time over the
writing, because it was a very cheap job.When they arrived at the yard, Payne was just finishing the coffin,
which was of elm.All that remained to be done to it was the pitching
of the joints inside and Payne was in the act of lifting the pot of
boiling pitch off the fire to do this.As it was such a cheap job, there was no time to polish it properly, so
Crass proceeded to give it a couple of coats of spirit varnish, and
while he was doing this Owen wrote the plate, which was made of very
thin zinc lacquered over to make it look like brass:

                                JOSEPH PHILPOT
                                     Died
                              September 1st 19--
                                Aged 56 years.The inquest was held on the following Monday morning, and as both
Rushton and Hunter thought it possible that Barrington might attempt to
impute some blame to them, they had worked the oracle and had contrived
to have several friends of their own put on the jury.There was,
however, no need for their alarm, because Barrington could not say that
he had himself noticed, or called Hunter's attention to the state of
the rope; and he did not wish to mention the names of the others
without their permission.The evidence of Crass and the other men who
were called was to the effect that it was a pure accident.None of them
had noticed that the rope was unsound.Hunter also swore that he did
not know of it--none of the men had ever called his attention to it; if
they had done so he would have procured a new one immediately.Philpot's landlady and Mr Rushton were also called as witnesses, and
the end was that the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, and
added that they did not think any blame attached to anyone.The coroner discharged the jury, and as they and the witnesses passed
out of the room, Hunter followed Rushton outside, with the hope of
being honoured by a little conversation with him on the satisfactory
issue of the case; but Rushton went off without taking any notice of
him, so Hunter returned to the room where the court had been held to
get the coroner's certificate authorizing the interment of the body.This document is usually handed to the friends of the deceased or to
the undertaker acting for them.When Hunter got back to the room he
found that during his absence the coroner had given it to Philpot's
landlady, who had taken it with her.He accordingly hastened outside
again to ask her for it, but the woman was nowhere to be seen.Crass and the other men were also gone; they had hurried off to return
to work, and after a moment's hesitation Hunter decided that it did not
matter much about the certificate.Crass had arranged the business
with the landlady and he could get the paper from her later on.Having
come to this conclusion, he dismissed the subject from his mind: he had
several prices to work out that afternoon--estimates from some jobs the
firm was going to tender for.That evening, after having been home to tea, Crass and Sawkins met by
appointment at the carpenter's shop to take the coffin to the mortuary,
where Misery had arranged to meet them at half past eight o'clock.Hunter's plan was to have the funeral take place from the mortuary,
which was only about a quarter of an hour's walk from the yard; so
tonight they were just going to lift in the body and get the lid
screwed down.It was blowing hard and raining heavily when Crass and Sawkins set out,
carrying the coffin--covered with a black cloth--on their shoulders.They also took a small pair of tressels for the coffin to stand on.Crass carried one of these slung over his arm and Sawkins the other.On their way they had to pass the 'Cricketers' and the place looked so
inviting that they decided to stop and have a drink--just to keep the
damp out, and as they could not very well take the coffin inside with
them, they stood it up against the brick wall a little way from the
side of the door: as Crass remarked with a laugh, there was not much
danger of anyone pinching it.The Old Dear served them and just as
they finished drinking the two half-pints there was a loud crash
outside and Crass and Sawkins rushed out and found that the coffin had
blown down and was lying bottom upwards across the pavement, while the
black cloth that had been wrapped round it was out in the middle of the
muddy road.Having recovered this, they shook as much of the dirt off
as they could, and having wrapped it round the coffin again they
resumed their journey to the mortuary, where they found Hunter waiting
for them, engaged in earnest conversation with the keeper.The
electric light was switched on, and as Crass and Sawkins came in they
saw that the marble slab was empty.'Snatchum came this afternoon with a hand-truck and a corfin,'
explained the keeper.'I was out at the time, and the missis thought
it was all right so she let him have the key.'Hunter and Crass looked blankly at each other.'Well, this takes the biskit!'said the latter as soon as he could
speak.'I thought you said you had settled everything all right with the old
woman?''I seen 'er on Friday, and I told 'er to
leave it all to me to attend to, and she said she would.I told 'er
that Philpot said to me that if ever anything 'appened to 'im I was to
take charge of everything for 'er, because I was 'is best friend.And
I told 'er we'd do it as cheap as possible.''Well, it seems to me as you've bungled it somehow,' said Nimrod,
gloomily.'I ought to have gone and seen 'er myself, I was afraid
you'd make a mess of it,' he added in a wailing tone.'It's always the
same; everything that I don't attend to myself goes wrong.'Crass thought that the principal piece
of bungling in this affair was Hunter's failure to secure possession of
the Coroner's certificate after the inquest, but he was afraid to say
so.Outside, the rain was still falling and drove in through the partly
open door, causing the atmosphere of the mortuary to be even more than
usually cold and damp.The empty coffin had been reared against one of
the walls and the marble slab was still stained with blood, for the
keeper had not had time to clean it since the body had been removed.'I can see 'ow it's been worked,' said Crass at last.'There's one of
the members of the club who works for Snatchum, and 'e's took it on
'isself to give the order for the funeral; but 'e's got no right to do
it.''Right or no right, 'e's done it,' replied Misery,'so you'd better
take the box back to the shop.'Crass and Sawkins accordingly returned to the workshop, where they were
presently joined by Nimrod.'I've been thinking this business over as I came along,' he said, 'and
I don't see being beat like this by Snatchum; so you two can just put
the tressels and the box on a hand cart and we'll take it over to
Philpot's house.'Nimrod walked on the pavement while the other two pushed the cart, and
it was about half past nine, when they arrived at the street in Windley
where Philpot used to live.They halted in a dark part of the street a
few yards away from the house and on the opposite side.'I think the best thing we can do,' said Misery, 'is for me and Sawkins
to wait 'ere while you go to the 'ouse and see 'ow the land lies.You've done all the business with 'er so far.It's no use takin' the
box unless we know the corpse is there; for all we know, Snatchum may
'ave taken it 'ome with 'im.''Yes; I think that'll be the best way,' agreed Crass, after a moment's
thought.Nimrod and Sawkins accordingly took shelter in the doorway of an empty
house, leaving the handcart at the kerb, while Crass went across the
street and knocked at Philpot's door.They saw it opened by an elderly
woman holding a lighted candle in her hand; then Crass went inside and
the door was shut.In about a quarter of an hour he reappeared and,
leaving the door partly open behind him, he came out and crossed over
to where the others were waiting.As he drew near they could see that
he carried a piece of paper in his hand.'It's all right,' he said in a hoarse whisper as he came up.Misery took the paper eagerly and scanned it by the light of a match
that Crass struck.It was the certificate right enough, and with a
sigh of relief Hunter put it into his note-book and stowed it safely
away in the inner pocket of his coat, while Crass explained the result
of his errand.It appeared that the other member of the Society, accompanied by
Snatchum, had called upon the old woman and had bluffed her into giving
them the order for the funeral.It was they who had put her up to
getting the certificate from the Coroner--they had been careful to keep
away from the inquest themselves so as not to arouse Hunter's or
Crass's suspicions.'When they brought the body 'ome this afternoon,' Crass went on,
'Snatchum tried to get the stifficut orf 'er, but she'd been thinkin'
things over and she was a bit frightened 'cos she knowed she'd made
arrangements with me, and she thought she'd better see me first; so she
told 'im she'd give it to 'im on Thursday; that's the day as 'e was
goin' to 'ave the funeral.''He'll find he's a day too late,' said Misery, with a ghastly grin.'We'll get the job done on Wednesday.''She didn't want to give it to me, at first,' Crass concluded, 'but I
told 'er we'd see 'er right if old Snatchum tried to make 'er pay for
the other coffin.''I don't think he's likely to make much fuss about it,' said Hunter.'He won't want everybody to know he was so anxious for the job.'Crass and Sawkins pushed the handcart over to the other side of the
road and then, lifting the coffin off, they carried it into the house,
Nimrod going first.The old woman was waiting for them with the candle at the end of the
passage.'I shall be very glad when it's all over,' she said, as she led the way
up the narrow stairs, closely followed by Hunter, who carried the
tressels, Crass and Sawkins, bringing up the rear with the coffin.'I
shall be very glad when it's all over, for I'm sick and tired of
answerin' the door to undertakers.If there's been one 'ere since
Friday there's been a dozen, all after the job, not to mention all the
cards what's been put under the door, besides the one's what I've had
give to me by different people.I had a pair of boots bein' mended and
the man took the trouble to bring 'em 'ome when they was finished--a
thing 'e's never done before--just for an excuse to give me an
undertaker's card.'Then the milkman brought one, and so did the baker, and the
greengrocer give me another when I went in there on Saturday to buy
some vegetables for Sunday dinner.'Arrived at the top landing the old woman opened a door and entered a
small and wretchedly furnished room.Across the lower sash of the window hung a tattered piece of lace
curtain.The low ceiling was cracked and discoloured.There was a rickety little wooden washstand, and along one side of the
room a narrow bed covered with a ragged grey quilt, on which lay a
bundle containing the clothes that the dead man was wearing at the time
of the accident.There was a little table in front of the window, with a small
looking-glass upon it, and a cane-seated chair was placed by the
bedside and the floor was covered with a faded piece of drab-
carpet of no perceptible pattern, worn into holes in several places.In the middle of this dreary room, upon a pair of tressels, was the
coffin containing Philpot's body.Seen by the dim and flickering light
of the candle, the aspect of this coffin, covered over with a white
sheet, was terrible in its silent, pathetic solitude.Hunter placed the pair of tressels he had been carrying against the
wall, and the other two put the empty coffin on the floor by the side
of the bed.The old woman stood the candlestick on the mantelpiece,
and withdrew, remarking that they would not need her assistance.The
three men then removed their overcoats and laid them on the end of the
bed, and from the pocket of his Crass took out two large screwdrivers,
one of which he handed to Hunter.Sawkins held the candle while they
unscrewed and took off the lid of the coffin they had brought with
them: it was not quite empty, for they had brought a bag of tools
inside it.'I think we shall be able to work better if we takes the other one orf
the trussels and puts it on the floor,' remarked Crass.'Yes, I think so, too,' replied Hunter.Crass took off the sheet and threw it on the bed, revealing the other
coffin, which was very similar in appearance to the one they had
brought with them, being of elms, with the usual imitation brass
furniture.Hunter took hold of the head and Crass the foot and they
lifted it off the tressels on to the floor.''E's not very 'eavy; that's one good thing,' observed Hunter.''E always was a very thin chap,' replied Crass.The screws that held down the lid had been covered over with
large-headed brass nails which had to be wrenched off before they could
get at the screws, of which there were eight altogether.It was
evident from the appearance of the beads of these screws that they were
old ones that had been used for some purpose before: they were rusty
and of different sizes, some being rather larger or smaller, than they
should have been.They were screwed in so firmly that by the time they
had drawn half of them out the two men were streaming with
perspiration.After a while Hunter took the candle from Sawkins and
the latter had a try at the screws.'Anyone would think the dam' things had been there for a 'undred
years,' remarked Hunter, savagely, as he wiped the sweat from his face
and neck with his handkerchief.Kneeling on the lid of the coffin and panting and grunting with the
exertion, the other two continued to struggle with their task.Suddenly
Crass uttered an obscene curse; he had broken off one side of the head
of the screw he was trying to turn and almost at the same instant a
similar misfortune happened to Sawkins.After this, Hunter again took a screwdriver himself, and when they got
all the screws out with the exception of the two broken ones, Crass
took a hammer and chisel out of the bag and proceeded to cut off what
was left of the tops of the two that remained.But even after this was
done the two screws still held the lid on the coffin, and so they had
to hammer the end of the blade of the chisel underneath and lever the
lid up so that they could get hold of it with their fingers.It split
up one side as they tore it off, exposing the dead man to view.Although the marks of the cuts and bruises were still visible on
Philpot's face, they were softened down by the pallor of death, and a
placid, peaceful expression pervaded his features.His hands were
crossed upon his breast, and as he lay there in the snow-white grave
clothes, almost covered in by the white lace frill that bordered the
sides of the coffin, he looked like one in a profound and tranquil
sleep.They laid the broken lid on the bed, and placed the two coffins side by
side on the floor as close together as possible.Sawkins stood at one
side holding the candle in his left hand and ready to render with his
right any assistance that might unexpectedly prove to be necessary.Crass, standing at the foot, took hold of the body by the ankles, while
Hunter at the other end seized it by the shoulders with his huge,
clawlike hands, which resembled the talons of some obscene bird of
prey, and they dragged it out and placed it in the other coffin.Whilst Hunter--hovering ghoulishly over the corpse--arranged the grave
clothes and the frilling, Crass laid the broken cover on the top of the
other coffin and pushed it under the bed out of the way.Then he
selected the necessary screws and nails from the bag, and Hunter having
by this time finished, they proceeded to screw down the lid.Then they
lifted the coffin on to the tressels, covering it over with the sheet,
and the appearance it then presented was so exactly similar to what
they had seen when they first entered the room, that it caused the same
thought to occur to all of them: Suppose Snatchum took it into his head
to come there and take the body out again?If he were to do so and
take it up to the cemetery they might be compelled to give up the
certificate to him and then all their trouble would be lost.After a brief consultation, they resolved that it would be safer to
take the corpse on the handcart to the yard and keep it in the
carpenter's shop until the funeral, which could take place from there.Crass and Sawkins accordingly lifted the coffin off the tressels,
and--while Hunter held the light--proceeded to carry it downstairs, a
task of considerable difficulty owing to the narrowness of the
staircase and the landing.However, they got it down at last and,
having put it on the handcart, covered it over with the black wrapper.It was still raining and the lamp in the cart was nearly out, so
Sawkins trimmed the wick and relit it before they started.Hunter wished them 'Good-night' at the corner of the street, because it
was not necessary for him to accompany them to the yard--they would be
able to manage all that remained to be done by themselves.He said he
would make the arrangements for the funeral as soon as he possibly
could the next morning, and he would come to the job and let them know,
as soon as he knew himself, at what time they would have to be in
attendance to act as bearers.He had gone a little distance on his way
when he stopped and turned back to them.'It's not necessary for either of you to make a song about this
business, you know,' he said.The two men said that they quite understood that: he could depend on
their keeping their mouths shut.When Hunter had gone, Crass drew out his watch.A little way down the road the lights of a public house were
gleaming through the mist.'We shall be just in time to get a drink before closing time if we buck
up,' he said.And with this object they hurried on as fast as they
could.When they reached the tavern they left the cart standing by the kerb,
and went inside, where Crass ordered two pints of four-ale, which he
permitted Sawkins to pay for.'How are we going on about this job?'inquired the latter after they
had each taken a long drink, for they were thirsty after their
exertions.'I reckon we ought to 'ave more than a bob for it, don't
you?It's not like a ordinary "lift in".''Of course it ain't,' replied Crass.'We ought to 'ave about,
say'--reflecting--'say arf a dollar each at the very least.''I was going to say arf a crown,
myself.'Crass agreed that even half a crown would not be too much.''Ow are we going' on about chargin' it on our time sheets?'asked
Sawkins, after a pause.'If we just put a "lift in", they might only
pay us a bob as usual.'As a rule when they had taken a coffin home, they wrote on their time
sheets, 'One lift in', for which they were usually paid one shilling,
unless it happened to be a very high-class funeral, when they sometimes
got one and sixpence.They were never paid by the hour for these jobs.'I think the best way will be to put it like this,' he said at length.Also takin' corpse
to carpenter's shop."Sawkins said that would be a very good way to put it, and they finished
their beer just as the landlord intimated that it was closing time.The cart was standing where they left it, the black cloth saturated
with the rain, which dripped mournfully from its sable folds.When they reached the plot of waste ground over which they had to pass
in order to reach the gates of the yard, they had to proceed very
cautiously, for it was very dark, and the lantern did not give much
light.A number of carts and lorries were standing there, and the path
wound through pools of water and heaps of refuse.After much
difficulty and jolting, they reached the gate, which Crass unlocked
with the key he had obtained from the office earlier in the evening.They soon opened the door of the carpenter's shop and, after lighting
the gas, they arranged the tressels and then brought in the coffin and
placed it upon them.Then they locked the door and placed the key in
its usual hiding-place, but the key of the outer gate they took with
them and dropped into the letter-box at the office, which they had to
pass on their way home.As they turned away from the door, they were suddenly confronted by a
policeman who flashed his lantern in their faces and demanded to know
why they had tried the lock...

The next morning was a very busy one for Hunter, who had to see several
new jobs commenced.Most of them would
only take two or three days from start to finish.Attending to this work occupied most of his morning, but all the same
he managed to do the necessary business connected with the funeral,
which he arranged to take place at two o'clock on Wednesday afternoon
from the mortuary, where the coffin had been removed during the day,
Hunter deciding that it would not look well to have the funeral start
from the workshop.Although Hunter had kept it as quiet as possible, there was a small
crowd, including several old workmates of Philpot's who happened to be
out of work, waiting outside the mortuary to see the funeral start, and
amongst them were Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk, who were both sober.Barrington and Owen were also there, having left work for the day in
order to go to the funeral.They were there too in a sense as the
representatives of the other workmen, for Barrington carried a large
wreath which had been subscribed for voluntarily by Rushton's men.They could not all afford to lose the time to attend the funeral,
although most of them would have liked to pay that tribute of regard to
their old mate, so they had done this as the next best thing.Attached
to the wreath was a strip of white satin ribbon, upon which Owen had
painted a suitable inscription.Promptly at two o'clock the hearse and the mourning coach drove up with
Hunter and the four bearers--Crass, Slyme, Payne and Sawkins, all
dressed in black with frock coats and silk hats.Although they were
nominally attired in the same way, there was a remarkable dissimilarity
in their appearance.Crass's coat was of smooth, intensely black
cloth, having been recently dyed, and his hat was rather low in the
crown, being of that shape that curved outwards towards the top.Hunter's coat was a kind of serge with a rather rusty cast of colour
and his hat was very tall and straight, slightly narrower at the crown
than at the brim.As for the others, each of them had a hat of a
different fashion and date, and their 'black' clothes ranged from rusty
brown to dark blue.These differences were due to the fact that most of the garments had
been purchased at different times from different second-hand clothes
shops, and never being used except on such occasions as the present,
they lasted for an indefinite time.When the coffin was brought out and placed in the hearse, Hunter laid
upon it the wreath that Barrington gave him, together with the another
he had brought himself, which had a similar ribbon with the words:
'From Rushton & Co.Seeing that Barrington and Owen were the only occupants of the
carriage, Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk came up to the door and asked
if there was any objection to their coming and as neither Owen nor
Barrington objected, they did not think it necessary to ask anyone
else's permission, so they got in.Meanwhile, Hunter had taken his position a few yards in front of the
hearse and the bearers each his proper position, two on each side.As
the procession turned into the main road, they saw Snatchum standing at
the corner looking very gloomy.Hunter kept his eyes fixed straight
ahead and affected not to see him, but Crass could not resist the
temptation to indulge in a jeering smile, which so enraged Snatchum
that he shouted out:

'It don't matter!The distance to the cemetery was about three miles, so as soon as they
got out of the busy streets of the town, Hunter called a halt, and got
up on the hearse beside the driver, Crass sat on the other side, and
two of the other bearers stood in the space behind the driver's seat,
the fourth getting up beside the driver of the coach; and then they
proceeded at a rapid pace.As they drew near to the cemetery they slowed down, and finally stopped
when about fifty yards from the gate.Then Hunter and the bearers
resumed their former position, and they passed through the open gate
and up to the door of the church, where they were received by the
clerk--a man in a rusty black cassock, who stood by while they carried
the coffin in and placed it on a kind of elevated table which revolved
on a pivot.They brought it in footfirst, and as soon as they had
placed it upon the table, the clerk swung it round so as to bring the
foot of the coffin towards the door ready to be carried out again.There was a special pew set apart for the undertakers, and in this
Hunter and the bearers took their seats to await the arrival of the
clergyman.Barrington and the three others sat on the opposite side.There was no altar or pulpit in this church, but a kind of reading desk
stood on a slightly raised platform at the other end of the aisle.After a wait of about ten minutes, the clergyman entered and, at once
proceeding to the desk, began to recite in a rapid and wholly
unintelligible manner the usual office.If it had not been for the
fact that each of his hearers had a copy of the words--for there was a
little book in each pew--none of them would have been able to gather
the sense of what the man was gabbling.Under any other circumstances,
the spectacle of a human being mouthing in this absurd way would have
compelled laughter, and so would the suggestion that this individual
really believed that he was addressing the Supreme Being.His attitude
and manner were contemptuously indifferent.While he recited, intoned,
or gabbled, the words of the office, he was reading the certificate and
some other paper the clerk had placed upon the desk, and when he had
finished reading these, his gaze wandered abstractedly round the
chapel, resting for a long time with an expression of curiosity upon
Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk, who were doing their best to follow in
their books the words he was repeating.He next turned his attention to
his fingers, holding his hand away from him nearly at arm's length and
critically examining the nails.From time to time as this miserable mockery proceeded the clerk in the
rusty black cassock mechanically droned out a sonorous 'Ah-men', and
after the conclusion of the lesson the clergyman went out of the
church, taking a short cut through the grave-stones and monuments,
while the bearers again shouldered the coffin and followed the clerk to
the grave.When they arrived within a few yards of their destination,
they were rejoined by the clergyman, who was waiting for them at the
corner of one of the paths.He put himself at the head of the
procession with an open book in his hand, and as they walked slowly
along, he resumed his reading or repetition of the words of the service.He had on an old black cassock and a much soiled and slightly torn
surplice.The unseemly appearance of this dirty garment was heightened
by the circumstance that he had not taken the trouble to adjust it
properly.It hung all lop-sided, showing about six inches more of the
black cassock underneath one side than the other.However, perhaps it
is not right to criticize this person's appearance so severely, because
the poor fellow was paid only seven-and-six for each burial, and as
this was only the fourth funeral he had officiated at that day,
probably he could not afford to wear clean linen--at any rate, not for
the funerals of the lower classes.He continued his unintelligible jargon while they were lowering the
coffin into the grave, and those who happened to know the words of the
office by heart were, with some difficulty, able to understand what he
was saying:

'Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of His great mercy to take
unto Himself the soul of our Dear Brother here departed, we therefore
commit his body to the ground; earth to earth; ashes to ashes, dust to
dust--'

The earth fell from the clerk's hand and rattled on the lid of the
coffin with a mournful sound, and when the clergyman had finished
repeating the remainder of the service, he turned and walked away in
the direction of the church.Hunter and the rest of the funeral party
made their way back towards the gate of the cemetery where the hearse
and the carriage were waiting.On their way they saw another funeral procession coming towards them.It was a very plain-looking closed hearse with only one horse.There
was no undertaker in front and no bearers walked by the sides.Three men, evidently dressed in their Sunday clothes, followed behind
the hearse.As they reached the church door, four old men who were
dressed in ordinary everyday clothes, came forward and opening the
hearse took out the coffin and carried it into the church, followed by
the other three, who were evidently relatives of the deceased.The
four old men were paupers--inmates of the workhouse, who were paid
sixpence each for acting as bearers.They were just taking out the coffin from the hearse as Hunter's party
was passing, and most of the latter paused for a moment and watched
them carry it into the church.The roughly made coffin was of white
deal, not painted or covered in any way, and devoid of any fittings or
ornament with the exception of a square piece of zinc on the lid.None
of Rushton's party was near enough to recognize any of the mourners or
to read what was written on the zinc, but if they had been they would
have seen, roughly painted in black letters

                                     J.L.Aged 67

and some of them would have recognized the three mourners who were Jack
Linden's sons.As for the bearers, they were all retired working men who had come into
their 'titles'.One of them was old Latham, the venetian blind maker.Chapter 48

The Wise men of the East


At the end of the following week there was a terrible slaughter at
Rushton's.Barrington and all the casual hands were sacked, including
Newman, Easton and Harlow, and there was so little work that it looked
as if everyone else would have to stand off also.The summer was
practically over, so those who were stood off had but a poor chance of
getting a start anywhere else, because most other firms were
discharging hands as well.There was only one other shop in the town that was doing anything at
all to speak of, and that was the firm of Dauber and Botchit.This
firm had come very much to the front during the summer, and had
captured several big jobs that Rushton & Co.had expected to get,
besides taking away several of the latter's old customers.This firm took work at almost half the price that Rushton's could do it
for, and they had a foreman whose little finger was thicker than
Nimrod's thigh.Some of the men who had worked for both firms during
the summer, said that after working for Dauber and Botchit, working for
Rushton seemed like having a holiday.'There's one bloke there,' said Newman, in conversation with Harlow and
Easton.'There's one bloke there wot puts up twenty-five rolls o'
paper in a day an' trims and pastes for 'imself; and as for the
painters, nearly everyone of 'em gets over as much work as us three put
together, and if you're working there you've got to do the same or get
the sack.'However much truth or falsehood or exaggeration there may have been in
the stories of the sweating and driving that prevailed at Dauber and
Botchit's, it was an indisputable fact that the other builders found it
very difficult to compete with them, and between the lot of them what
work there was to do was all finished or messed up in about a quarter
of the time that it would have taken to do it properly.By the end of September there were great numbers of men out of
employment, and the practical persons who controlled the town were
already preparing to enact the usual farce of 'Dealing' with the
distress that was certain to ensue.Mr Bosher talked of
reopening the Labour Yard; the secretary of the OBS appealed for more
money and cast-off clothing and boots--the funds of the Society had
been depleted by the payment of his quarter's salary.There were
rumours that the Soup Kitchen would be reopened at an early date for
the sale of 'nourishment', and charitable persons began to talk of
Rummage Sales and soup tickets.Now and then, whenever a 'job' 'came in', a few of Rushton's men were
able to put in a few hours' work, but Barrington never went back.His
manner of life was the subject of much speculation on the part of his
former workmates, who were not a little puzzled by the fact that he was
much better dressed than they had ever known him to be before, and that
he was never without money.He generally had a tanner or a bob to
lend, and was always ready to stand a drink, to say nothing of what it
must have cost him for the quantities of Socialist pamphlets and
leaflets that he gave away broadcast.He lodged over at Windley, but
he used to take his meals at a little coffee tavern down town, where he
used often to invite one or two of his old mates to take dinner with
him.It sometimes happened that one of them would invite him home of
an evening, to drink a cup of tea, or to see some curiosity that the
other thought would interest him, and on these occasions--if there were
any children in the house to which they were going--Barrington usually
made a point of going into a shop on their way, and buying a bag of
cakes or fruit for them.All sorts of theories were put forward to account for his apparent
affluence.Some said he was a toff in disguise; others that he had
rich relations who were ashamed of him because he was a Socialist, and
who allowed him so much a week so long as he kept away from them and
did not use his real name.Some of the Liberals said that he was in
the pay of the Tories, who were seeking by underhand methods to split
up the Progressive Liberal Party.Just about that time several
burglaries took place in the town, the thieves getting clear away with
the plunder, and this circumstance led to a dark rumour that Barrington
was the culprit, and that it was these ill-gotten gains that he was
spending so freely.About the middle of October an event happened that drew the town into a
state of wild excitement, and such comparatively unimportant subjects
as unemployment and starvation were almost forgotten.Sir Graball D'Encloseland had been promoted to yet a higher post in the
service of the country that he owned such a large part of; he was not
only to have a higher and more honourable position, but also--as was
nothing but right--a higher salary.His pay was to be increased to
seven thousand five hundred a year or one hundred and fifty pounds per
week, and in consequence of this promotion it was necessary for him to
resign his seat and seek re-election.The ragged-trousered Tory workmen as they loitered about the streets,
their stomachs empty, said to each other that it was a great honour for
Mugsborough that their Member should be promoted in this way.They
boasted about it and assumed as much swagger in their gait as their
broken boots permitted.They stuck election cards bearing Sir Graball's photograph in their
windows and tied bits of blue and yellow ribbon--Sir Graball's
colours--on their underfed children.They said that an election had been sprung
on them--they had been taken a mean advantage of--they had no candidate
ready.They had no complaint to make about the salary, all they complained of
was the short notice.It wasn't fair because while they--the leading
Liberals--had been treating the electors with the contemptuous
indifference that is customary, Sir Graball D'Encloseland had been most
active amongst his constituents for months past, cunningly preparing
for the contest.He had really been electioneering for the past six
months!Last winter he had kicked off at quite a number of football
matches besides doing all sorts of things for the local teams.He had
joined the Buffalos and the Druids, been elected President of the Skull
and Crossbones Boys' Society, and, although he was not himself an
abstainer, he was so friendly to Temperance that he had on several
occasions, taken the chair at teetotal meetings, to say nothing of the
teas to the poor school children and things of that sort.In short, he
had been quite an active politician, in the Tory sense of the word, for
months past and the poor Liberals had not smelt a rat until the
election was sprung upon them.A hurried meeting of the Liberal Three Hundred was held, and a
deputation sent to London to find a candidate but as there was only a
week before polling day they were unsuccessful in their mission.Another meeting was held, presided over by Mr Adam Sweater--Rushton and
Didlum also being present.Profound dejection was depicted on the countenances of those assembled
slave-drivers as they listened to the delegates' report.The sombre
silence that followed was broken at length by Mr Rushton, who suddenly
started up and said that he began to think they had made a mistake in
going outside the constituency at all to look for a man.It was
strange but true that a prophet never received honour in his own land.They had been wasting the precious time running about all over the
country, begging and praying for a candidate, and overlooking the fact
that they had in their midst a gentleman--a fellow townsman, who, he
believed, would have a better chance of success than any stranger.Surely they would all agree--if they could only prevail upon him to
stand--that Adam Sweater would be an ideal Liberal Candidate!While Mr Rushton was speaking the drooping spirits of the Three Hundred
were reviving, and at the name of Sweater they all began to clap their
hands and stamp their feet.Loud shouts of enthusiastic approval burst
forth, and cries of 'Good old Sweater' resounded through the room.When Sweater rose to reply, the tumult died away as suddenly as it had
commenced.He thanked them for the honour they were conferring upon
him.There was no time to waste in words or idle compliments; rather
than allow the Enemy to have a walk-over, he would accede to their
request and contest the seat.A roar of applause burst from the throats of the delighted Three
Hundred.Outside the hall in which the meeting was being held a large crowd of
poverty-stricken Liberal working men, many of them wearing broken boots
and other men's cast-off clothing, was waiting to hear the report of
the slave-drivers' deputation, and as soon as Sweater had consented to
be nominated, Didlum rushed and opened the window overlooking the
street and shouted the good news down to the crowd, which joined in the
cheering.In response to their demands for a speech, Sweater brought
his obese carcass to the window and addressed a few words to them,
reminding them of the shortness of the time at their disposal, and
intreating them to work hard in order that the Grand old Flag might be
carried to victory.At such times these people forgot all about unemployment and
starvation, and became enthusiastic about 'Grand old Flags'.Their
devotion to this flag was so great that so long as they were able to
carry it to victory, they did not mind being poverty stricken and
hungry and ragged; all that mattered was to score off their hated
'enemies' their fellow countrymen the Tories, and carry the grand old
flag to victory.The fact that they had carried the flag to victory so
often in the past without obtaining any of the spoils, did not seem to
damp their ardour in the least.Being philanthropists, they were
content--after winning the victory--that their masters should always do
the looting.At the conclusion of Sweater's remarks the philanthropists gave three
frantic cheers and then someone in the crowd shouted 'What's the
colour?'After a hasty consultation with Rushton, who being a'master'
decorator, was thought to be an authority on colours--green--grass
green--was decided upon, and the information was shouted down to the
crowd, who cheered again.Then a rush was made to Sweater's Emporium
and several yards of cheap green ribbon were bought, and divided up
into little pieces, which they tied into their buttonholes, and thus
appropriately decorated, formed themselves into military order, four
deep, and marched through all the principal streets, up and down the
Grand Parade, round and round the Fountain, and finally over the hill
to Windley, singing to the tune of 'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the Boys are
marching':

        'Vote, Vote, Vote for Adam Sweater!Adam Sweater is our man,
        And we'll have him if we can,
        Then we'll always have the biggest loaf for tea.'The spectacle presented by these men--some of them with grey heads and
beards--as they marked time or tramped along singing this childish
twaddle, would have been amusing if it had not been disgusting.By way of variety they sang several other things, including:

        'We'll hang ole Closeland
        On a sour apple tree,'

and

        'Rally, Rally, men of Windley
        For Sweater's sure to win.'As they passed the big church in Quality Street, the clock began to
strike.It was one of those that strike four chimes at each quarter of
the hour.It was now ten o'clock so there were sixteen musical chimes:

        Ding, dong!They all chanted A-dam Sweat-er' in time with the striking clock.In
the same way the Tories would chant:

        'Grab--all Close--land!The town was soon deluged with mendacious literature and smothered with
huge posters:

                      'Vote for Adam Sweater!'Vote for Sweater and Temperance Reform.''Vote for Sweater--Free Trade and Cheap Food.'or

      'Vote for D'Encloseland: Tariff Reform and Plenty of Work!'This beautiful idea--'Plenty of Work'--appealed strongly to the Tory
workmen.They seemed to regard themselves and their children as a sort
of machines or beasts of burden, created for the purpose of working for
the benefit of other people.They did not think it right that they
should Live, and enjoy the benefits of civilization.All they desired
for themselves and their children was 'Plenty of Work'.They marched about the streets singing their Marseillaise, 'Work, Boys,
Work and be contented', to the tune of 'Tramp, tramp, tramp the Boys
are marching', and at intervals as they tramped along, they gave three
cheers for Sir Graball, Tariff Reform, and--Plenty of Work.Both sides imported gangs of hired orators who held forth every night
at the corners of the principal streets, and on the open spaces from
portable platforms, and from motor cars and lorries.The Tories said
that the Liberal Party in the House of Commons was composed principally
of scoundrels and fools, the Liberals said that the Tory Party were
fools and scoundrels.A host of richly dressed canvassers descended
upon Windley in carriages and motor cars, and begged for votes from the
poverty-stricken working men who lived there.One evening a Liberal demonstration was held at the Cross Roads on
Windley Hill.Notwithstanding the cold weather, there was a great
crowd of shabbily dressed people, many of whom had not had a really
good meal for months.The moon was at the full,
and the scene was further illuminated by the fitful glare of several
torches, stuck on the end of twelve-foot poles.The platform was a
large lorry, and there were several speakers, including Adam Sweater
himself and a real live Liberal Peer--Lord Ammenegg.This individual
had made a considerable fortune in the grocery and provision line, and
had been elevated to the Peerage by the last Liberal Government on
account of his services to the Party, and in consideration of other
considerations.Both Sweater and Ammenegg were to speak at two other meetings that
night and were not expected at Windley until about eight-thirty, so to
keep the ball rolling till they arrived, several other gentlemen,
including Rushton--who presided--and Didlum, and one of the five pounds
a week orators, addressed the meeting.Mingled with the crowd were
about twenty rough-looking men--strangers to the town--who wore huge
green rosettes and loudly applauded the speakers.They also
distributed Sweater literature and cards with lists of the different
meetings that were to be held during the election.These men were
bullies hired by Sweater's agent.They came from the neighbourhood of
Seven Dials in London and were paid ten shillings a day.One of their
duties was to incite the crowd to bash anyone who disturbed the
meetings or tried to put awkward questions to the speakers.The hired orator was a tall, slight man with dark hair, beard and
moustache, he might have been called well-looking if it had not been
for a ugly scar upon his forehead, which gave him a rather sinister
appearance.He was an effective speaker; the audience punctuated his
speech with cheers, and when he wound up with an earnest appeal to
them--as working men--to vote for Adam Sweater, their enthusiasm knew
no bounds.'I've seen him somewhere before,' remarked Barrington, who was standing
in the crowd with Harlow, Owen and Easton.'So have I,' said Owen, with a puzzled expression.'But for the life
of me, I can't remember where.'Harlow and Easton also thought they had seen the man before, but their
speculations were put an end to by the roar of cheering that heralded
the arrival of the motor car, containing Adam Sweater and his friend,
Lord Ammenegg.Unfortunately, those who had arranged the meeting had
forgotten to provide a pair of steps, so Sweater found it a matter of
considerable difficulty to mount the platform.However, while his
friends were hoisting and pushing him up, the meeting beguiled the time
by singing:


        'Vote, vote, vote for Adam Sweater.'After a terrible struggle they succeeded in getting him on to the cart,
and while he was recovering his wind, Rushton made a few remarks to the
crowd.Sweater then advanced to the front, but in consequence of the
cheering and singing, he was unable to make himself heard for several
minutes.When at length he was able to proceed, ho made a very clever speech--it
had been specially written for him and had cost ten guineas.A large
part of it consisted of warnings against the dangers of Socialism.Sweater had carefully rehearsed this speech and he delivered it very
effectively.Some of those Socialists, he said, were well-meaning but
mistaken people, who did not realize the harm that would result if
their extraordinary ideas were ever put into practice.He lowered his
voice to a blood-curdling stage whisper as he asked:

'What is this Socialism that we hear so much about, but which so few
understand?What is it, and what does it mean?'Then, raising his voice till it rang through the air and fell upon the
ears of the assembled multitude like the clanging of a funeral bell, he
continued:

'It is madness!Black Ruin for the
rich, and consequently, of course, Blacker Ruin still for the poor!'As Sweater paused, a thrill of horror ran through the meeting.Men
wearing broken boots and with patches upon the seats and knees, and
ragged fringes round the bottoms of the legs of their trousers, grew
pale, and glanced apprehensively at each other.If ever Socialism did
come to pass, they evidently thought it very probable that they would
have to walk about in a sort of prehistoric highland costume, without
any trousers or boots at all.Toil-worn women, most of them dressed in other women's shabby cast-off
clothing--weary, tired-looking mothers who fed their children for the
most part on adulterated tea, tinned skimmed milk and bread and
margarine, grew furious as they thought of the wicked Socialists who
were trying to bring Ruin upon them.It never occurred to any of these poor people that they were in a
condition of Ruin, Black Ruin, already.But if Sweater had suddenly
found himself reduced to the same social condition as the majority of
those he addressed, there is not much doubt that he would have thought
that he was in a condition of Black Ruin.The awful silence that had fallen on the panic-stricken crowd, was
presently broken by a ragged-trousered Philanthropist, who shouted out:

'We knows wot they are, sir.Most of 'em is chaps wot's got tired of
workin' for their livin', so they wants us to keep 'em.'Encouraged by numerous expressions of approval from the other
Philanthropists, the man continued:

'But we ain't such fools as they thinks, and so they'll find out next
Monday.Most of 'em wants 'angin', and I wouldn't mind lendin' a 'and
with the rope myself.'Applause and laughter greeted these noble sentiments, and Sweater
resumed his address, when another man--evidently a Socialist--for he
was accompanied by three or four others who like himself wore red
ties--interrupted and said that he would like to ask him a question.No notice was taken of this request either by Mr Sweater or the
chairman, but a few angry cries of 'Order!'Sweater continued, but the man again interrupted and the cries of the
crowd became more threatening.Rushton started up and said that he
could not allow the speaker to be interrupted, but if the gentleman
would wait till the end of the meeting, he would have an opportunity of
asking his question then.The man said he would wait as desired; Sweater resumed his oration, and
presently the interrupter and his friends found themselves surrounded
by the gang of hired bullies who wore the big rosettes and who glared
menacingly at them.Sweater concluded his speech with an appeal to the crowd to deal a
'Slashing Bow at the Enemy' next Monday, and then amid a storm of
applause, Lord Ammenegg stepped to the front.He said that he did not
intend to inflict a long speech upon them that evening, and as it was
nomination day tomorrow he would not be able to have the honour of
addressing them again during the election; but even if he had wished to
make a long speech, it would be very difficult after the brilliant and
eloquent address they had just listened to from Mr Sweater, for it
seemed to him (Ammenegg) that Adam Sweater had left nothing for anyone
else to say.But he would like to tell them of a Thought that had
occurred to him that evening.They read in the Bible that the Wise Men
came from the East.Windley, as they all knew, was the East end of the
town.They were the men of the East, and he was sure that next Monday
they would prove that they were the Wise Men of the East, by voting for
Adam Sweater and putting him at the top of the poll with a 'Thumping
Majority'.The Wise Men of the East greeted Ammenegg's remarks with prolonged,
imbecile cheers, and amid the tumult his Lordship and Sweater got into
the motor car and cleared off without giving the man with the red tie
or anyone else who desired to ask questions any opportunity of doing
so.Rushton and the other leaders got into another motor car, and
followed the first to take part in another meeting down-town, which was
to be addressed by the great Sir Featherstone Blood.The crowd now resolved itself into military order, headed by the men
with torches and a large white banner on which was written in huge
black letters, 'Our man is Adam Sweater'.They marched down the hill singing, and when they reached the Fountain
on the Grand Parade they saw another crowd holding a meeting there.These were Tories and they became so infuriated at the sound of the
Liberal songs and by the sight of the banner, that they abandoned their
meeting and charged the processionists.Both
sides fought like savages, but as the Liberals were outnumbered by
about three to one, they were driven off the field with great
slaughter; most of the torch poles were taken from them, and the banner
was torn to ribbons.Then the Tories went back to the Fountain
carrying the captured torches, and singing to the tune of 'Has anyone
seen a German Band?''Has anyone seen a Lib'ral Flag,
        Lib'ral Flag, Lib'ral Flag?'While the Tories resumed their meeting at the Fountain, the Liberals
rallied in one of the back streets.Messengers were sent in various
directions for reinforcements, and about half an hour afterwards they
emerged from their retreat and swooped down upon the Tory meeting.They
overturned the platform, recaptured their torches, tore the enemy's
banner to tatters and drove them from their position.Then the
Liberals in their turn paraded the streets singing 'Has anyone seen a
Tory Flag?'and proceeded to the hall where Sir Featherstone was
speaking, arriving as the audience left.The crowd that came pouring out of the hall was worked up to a frenzy
of enthusiasm, for the speech they had just listened to had been a sort
of manifesto to the country.In response to the cheering of the processionists--who, of course, had
not heard the speech, but were cheering from force of habit--Sir
Featherstone Blood stood up in the carriage and addressed the crowd,
briefly outlining the great measures of Social Reform that his party
proposed to enact to improve the condition of the working classes; and
as they listened, the Wise Men grew delirious with enthusiasm.He
referred to Land Taxes and Death Duties which would provide money to
build battleships to protect the property of the rich, and provide Work
for the poor.Another tax was to provide a nice, smooth road for the
rich to ride upon in motor cars--and to provide Work for the poor.Another tax would be used for Development, which would also make Work
for the poor.A great point was made of the fact that the
rich were actually to be made to pay something towards the cost of
their road themselves!But nothing was said about how they would get
the money to do it.No reference was made to how the workers would be
sweated and driven and starved to earn Dividends and Rent and Interest
and Profits to put into the pockets of the rich before the latter would
be able to pay for anything at all.These are the things, Gentlemen, that we propose to do for you, and, at
the rate of progress which we propose to adopt, I say without fear or
contradiction, that within the next Five Hundred years we shall so
reform social conditions in this country, that the working classes will
be able to enjoy some of the benefits of civilization.'The only question before you is: Are you willing to wait for Five
Hundred Years?''Yes, sir,' shouted the Wise Men with enthusiasm at the glorious
prospect.'Yes, Sir: we'll wait a thousand years if you like, Sir!''I've been waiting all my life,' said one poor old veteran, who had
assisted to 'carry the "Old Flag" to victory' times out of number in
the past and who for his share of the spoils of those victories was now
in a condition of abject, miserable poverty, with the portals of the
workhouse yawning open to receive him; 'I've waited all my life, hoping
and trusting for better conditions so a few more years won't make much
difference to me.''Don't you trouble to 'urry yourself, Sir,' shouted another Solomon in
the crowd.You know
better than the likes of us 'ow long it ought to take.'In conclusion, the great man warned them against being led away by the
Socialists, those foolish, unreasonable, impractical people who wanted
to see an immediate improvement in their condition; and he reminded
them that Rome was not built in a day.It did not appear to occur to any of
them that the rate at which the ancient Roman conducted their building
operations had nothing whatever to do with the case.Sir Featherstone Blood sat down amid a wild storm of cheering, and then
the procession reformed, and, reinforced by the audience from the hall,
they proceeded to march about the dreary streets, singing, to the tune
of the 'Men of Harlech':

        'Vote for Sweater, Vote for Sweater!Vote for Sweater, VOTE FOR SWEATER!'He's the Man, who has a plan,
        To liberate and reinstate the workers!'Men of Mugs'bro', show your mettle,
        Let them see that you're in fettle!Once for all this question settle
        Sweater shall Prevail!'The carriage containing Sir Featherstone, Adam Sweater, and Rushton and
Didlum was in the middle of the procession.The banner and the torches
were at the head, and the grandeur of the scene was heightened by four
men who walked--two on each side of the carriage, burning green fire in
frying pans.As they passed by the Slave Market, a poor, shabbily
dressed wretch whose boots were so worn and rotten that they were
almost falling off his feet, climbed up a lamp-post, and taking off his
cap waved it in the air and shrieked out: 'Three Cheers for Sir
Featherstone Blood, our future Prime Minister!'The Philanthropists cheered themselves hoarse and finally took the
horses out of the traces and harnessed themselves to the carriage
instead.''Ow much wages will Sir Featherstone get if 'e is made Prime
Minister?'asked Harlow of another Philanthropist who was also pushing
up behind the carriage.'Five thousand a year,' replied the other, who by some strange chance
happened to know.'That comes to a 'underd pounds a week.''Little enough, too, for a man like 'im,' said Harlow.'You're right, mate,' said the other, with deep sympathy in his voice.'Last time 'e 'eld office 'e was only in for five years, so 'e only
made twenty-five thousand pounds out of it.Of course 'e got a pension
as well--two thousand a year for life, I think it is; but after all,
what's that--for a man like 'im?''Nothing,' replied Harlow, in a tone of commiseration, and Newman, who
was also there, helping to drag the carriage, said that it ought to be
at least double that amount.However, they found some consolation in knowing that Sir Featherstone
would not have to wait till he was seventy before he obtained his
pension; he would get it directly he came out of office.The following evening Barrington, Owen and a few others of the same way
of thinking, who had subscribed enough money between them to purchase a
lot of Socialist leaflets, employed themselves distributing them to the
crowds at the Liberal and Tory meetings, and whilst they were doing
this they frequently became involved in arguments with the supporters
of the capitalist system.In their attempts to persuade others to
refrain from voting for either of the candidates, they were opposed
even by some who professed to believe in Socialism, who said that as
there was no better Socialist candidate the thing to do was to vote for
the better of the two.This was the view of Harlow and Easton, whom
they met.Harlow had a green ribbon in his buttonhole, but Easton wore
D'Encloseland's colours.One man said that if he had his way, all those who had votes should be
compelled to record them--whether they liked it or not--or be
disenfranchised!Barrington asked him if he believed in Tarrif Reform.The other replied that he opposed Tariff Reform because he believed it
would ruin the country.Barrington inquired if he were a supporter of
Socialism.The man said he was not, and when further questioned he
said that he believed if it were ever adopted it would bring black ruin
upon the country--he believed this because Mr Sweater had said so.When
Barrington asked him--supposing there were only two candidates, one a
Socialist and the other a Tariff Reformer--how would he like to be
compelled to vote for one of them, he was at a loss for an answer.The hired orators
continued to pour forth their streams of eloquence; and tons of
literature flooded the town.The walls were covered with huge posters:
'Another Liberal Lie.'Unconsciously each of these two parties put in some splendid work for
Socialism, in so much that each of them thoroughly exposed the
hypocrisy of the other.If the people had only had the sense, they
might have seen that the quarrel between the Liberal and Tory leaders
was merely a quarrel between thieves over the spoil; but unfortunately
most of the people had not the sense to perceive this.They were
blinded by bigoted devotion to their parties, and--inflamed with
maniacal enthusiasm--thought of nothing but 'carrying their flags to
victory'.At considerable danger to themselves, Barrington, Owen and the other
Socialists continued to distribute their leaflets and to heckle the
Liberal and Tory speakers.They asked the Tories to explain the
prevalence of unemployment and poverty in protected countries, like
Germany and America, and at Sweater's meetings they requested to be
informed what was the Liberal remedy for unemployment.From both
parties the Socialists obtained the same kinds of answer--threats of
violence and requests 'not to disturb the meeting'.These Socialists held quite a lot of informal meetings on their own.Every now and then when they were giving their leaflets away, some
unwary supporter of the capitalist system would start an argument, and
soon a crowd would gather round and listen.Sometimes the Socialists succeeded in arguing their opponents to an
absolute standstill, for the Liberals and Tones found it impossible to
deny that machinery is the cause of the overcrowded state of the labour
market; that the overcrowded labour market is the cause of
unemployment; that the fact of there being always an army of unemployed
waiting to take other men's jobs away from them destroys the
independence of those who are in employment and keeps them in
subjection to their masters.They found it impossible to deny that
this machinery is being used, not for the benefit of all, but to make
fortunes for a few.In short, they were unable to disprove that the
monopoly of the land and machinery by a comparatively few persons, is
the cause of the poverty of the majority.But when these arguments
that they were unable to answer were put before them and when it was
pointed out that the only possible remedy was the Public Ownership and
Management of the Means of production, they remained angrily silent,
having no alternative plan to suggest.At other times the meeting resolved itself into a number of quarrelsome
disputes between the Liberals and Tories that formed the crowd, which
split itself up into a lot of little groups and whatever the original
subject might have been they soon drifted to a hundred other things,
for most of the supporters of the present system seemed incapable of
pursuing any one subject to its logical conclusion.A discussion would
be started about something or other; presently an unimportant side
issue would crop up, then the original subject would be left
unfinished, and they would argue and shout about the side issue.In a
little while another side issue would arise, and then the first side
issue would be abandoned also unfinished, and an angry wrangle about
the second issue would ensue, the original subject being altogether
forgotten.They did not seem to really desire to discover the truth or to find out
the best way to bring about an improvement in their condition, their
only object seemed to be to score off their opponents.Usually after one of these arguments, Owen would wander off by himself,
with his head throbbing and a feeling of unutterable depression and
misery at his heart; weighed down by a growing conviction of the
hopelessness of everything, of the folly of expecting that his fellow
workmen would ever be willing to try to understand for themselves the
causes that produced their sufferings.It was not that those causes
were so obscure that it required exceptional intelligence to perceive
them; the causes of all the misery were so apparent that a little child
could easily be made to understand both the disease and the remedy; but
it seemed to him that the majority of his fellow workmen had become so
convinced of their own intellectual inferiority that they did not dare
to rely on their own intelligence to guide them, preferring to resign
the management of their affairs unreservedly into the hands of those
who battened upon and robbed them.They did not know the causes of the
poverty that perpetually held them and their children in its cruel
grip, and--they did not want to know!And if one explained those
causes to them in such language and in such a manner that they were
almost compelled to understand, and afterwards pointed out to them the
obvious remedy, they were neither glad nor responsive, but remained
silent and were angry because they found themselves unable to answer
and disprove.They remained silent; afraid to trust their own intelligence, and the
reason of this attitude was that they had to choose between the
evidence and their own intelligence, and the stories told them by their
masters and exploiters.And when it came to making this choice they
deemed it safer to follow their old guides, than to rely on their own
judgement, because from their very infancy they had had drilled into
them the doctrine of their own mental and social inferiority, and their
conviction of the truth of this doctrine was voiced in the degraded
expression that fell so frequently from their lips, when speaking of
themselves and each other--'The Likes of Us!'They did not know the causes of their poverty, they did not want to
know, they did not want to hear.All they desired was to be left alone so that they might continue to
worship and follow those who took advantage of their simplicity, and
robbed them of the fruits of their toil; their old leaders, the fools
or scoundrels who fed them with words, who had led them into the
desolation where they now seemed to be content to grind out treasure
for their masters, and to starve when those masters did not find it
profitable to employ them.It was as if a flock of foolish sheep
placed themselves under the protection of a pack of ravening wolves.Several times the small band of Socialists narrowly escaped being
mobbed, but they succeeded in disposing of most of their leaflets
without any serious trouble.Towards the latter part of one evening
Barrington and Owen became separated from the others, and shortly
afterwards these two lost each other in the crush.About nine o'clock, Barrington was in a large Liberal crowd, listening
to the same hired orator who had spoken a few evenings before on the
hill--the man with the scar on his forehead.The crowd was applauding
him loudly and Barrington again fell to wondering where he had seen
this man before.As on the previous occasion, this speaker made no
reference to Socialism, confining himself to other matters.Barrington
examined him closely, trying to recall under what circumstances they
had met previously, and presently he remembered that this was one of
the Socialists who had come with the band of cyclists into the town
that Sunday morning, away back at the beginning of the summer, the man
who had come afterwards with the van, and who had been struck down by a
stone while attempting to speak from the platform of the van, the man
who had been nearly killed by the upholders of the capitalist system.The Socialist had been clean-shaven--this man
wore beard and moustache--but Barrington was certain he was the same.When the man had concluded his speech he got down and stood in the
shade behind the platform, while someone else addressed the meeting,
and Barrington went round to where he was standing, intending to speak
to him.They were in the
vicinity of the Slave Market, near the Fountain, on the Grand Parade,
where several roads met; there was a meeting going on at every corner,
and a number of others in different parts of the roadway and on the
pavement of the Parade.Some of these meetings were being carried on by
two or three men, who spoke in turn from small, portable platforms they
carried with them, and placed wherever they thought there was a chance
of getting an audience.Every now and then some of these poor wretches--they were all paid
speakers--were surrounded and savagely mauled and beaten by a hostile
crowd.If they were Tariff Reformers the Liberals mobbed them, and
vice versa.Lines of rowdies swaggered to and fro, arm in arm,
singing, 'Vote, Vote, Vote, for good ole Closeland' or 'good ole
Sweater', according as they were green or blue and yellow.Gangs of
hooligans paraded up and down, armed with sticks, singing, howling,
cursing and looking for someone to hit.Others stood in groups on the
pavement with their hands thrust in their pockets, or leaned against
walls or the shutters of the shops with expressions of ecstatic
imbecility on their faces, chanting the mournful dirge to the tune of
the church chimes,

        'Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er.'Other groups--to the same tune--sang 'Good--ole--Close--land'; and
every now and again they used to leave off singing and begin to beat
each other.Fights used to take place, often between workmen, about
the respective merits of Adam Sweater and Sir Graball D'Encloseland.The walls were covered with huge Liberal and Tory posters, which showed
in every line the contempt of those who published them for the
intelligence of the working men to whom they were addressed.There was
one Tory poster that represented the interior of a public house; in
front of the bar, with a quart pot in his hand, a clay pipe in his
mouth, and a load of tools on his back, stood a degraded-looking brute
who represented the Tory ideal of what an Englishman should be; the
letterpress on the poster said it was a man!This is the ideal of
manhood that they hold up to the majority of their fellow countrymen,
but privately--amongst themselves--the Tory aristocrats regard such
'men' with far less respect than they do the lower animals.They were more
cunning, more specious, more hypocritical and consequently more
calculated to mislead and deceive the more intelligent of the voters.When Barrington got round to the back of the platform, he found the man
with the scarred face standing alone and gloomily silent in the shadow.Barrington gave him one of the Socialist leaflets, which he took, and
after glancing at it, put it in his coat pocket without making any
remark.'I hope you'll excuse me for asking, but were you not formerly a
Socialist?'Even in the semi-darkness Barrington saw the other man flush deeply and
then become very pale, and the unsightly scar upon his forehead showed
with ghastly distinctiveness.'I am still a Socialist: no man who has once been a Socialist can ever
cease to be one.''You seem to have accomplished that impossibility, to judge by the work
you are at present engaged in.You must have changed your opinions
since you were here last.''No one who has been a Socialist can ever cease to be one.It is
impossible for a man who has once acquired knowledge ever to relinquish
it.A Socialist is one who understands the causes of the misery and
degradation we see all around us; who knows the only remedy, and knows
that that remedy--the state of society that will be called
Socialism--must eventually be adopted; is the only alternative to the
extermination of the majority of the working people; but it does not
follow that everyone who has sense enough to acquire that amount of
knowledge, must, in addition, be willing to sacrifice himself in order
to help to bring that state of society into being.When I first
acquired that knowledge,' he continued, bitterly, 'I was eager to tell
the good news to others.I sacrificed my time, my money, and my health
in order that I might teach others what I had learned myself.I did it
willingly and happily, because I thought they would be glad to hear,
and that they were worth the sacrifices I made for their sakes.'Even if you no longer believe in working for Socialism, there's no
need to work AGAINST it.If you are not disposed to sacrifice yourself
in order to do good to others, you might at least refrain from doing
evil.If you don't want to help to bring about a better state of
affairs, there's no reason why you should help to perpetuate the
present system.''Oh yes, there is, and a very good
reason too.''I don't think you could show me a reason,' said Barrington.The man with the scar laughed again, the same unpleasant, mirthless
laugh, and thrusting his hand into his trouser pocket drew it out again
full of silver coins, amongst which one or two gold pieces glittered.When I devoted my life and what abilities I
possess to the service of my fellow workmen; when I sought to teach
them how to break their chains; when I tried to show them how they
might save their children from poverty and shameful servitude, I did
not want them to give me money.And they paid me
with hatred and injury.But since I have been helping their masters to
rob them, they have treated me with respect.'Barrington made no reply and the other man, having returned the money
to his pocket, indicated the crowd with a sweep of his hand.the people you are trying to make idealists of!Some of
them howling and roaring like wild beasts, or laughing like idiots,
others standing with dull and stupid faces devoid of any trace of
intelligence or expression, listening to the speakers whose words
convey no meaning to their stultified minds, and others with their eyes
gleaming with savage hatred of their fellow men, watching eagerly for
an opportunity to provoke a quarrel that they may gratify their brutal
natures by striking someone--their eyes are hungry for the sight of
blood!Can't you see that these people, whom you are trying to make
understand your plan for the regeneration of the world, your doctrine
of universal brotherhood and love are for the most
part--intellectually--on a level with Hottentots?The only things they
feel any real interest in are beer, football, betting and--of
course--one other subject.Their highest ambition is to be allowed to
Work.'They have never had an independent thought in their lives.These are
the people whom you hope to inspire with lofty ideals!You might just
as well try to make a gold brooch out of a lump of dung!Try to reason
with them, to uplift them, to teach them the way to higher things.Devote your whole life and intelligence to the work of trying to get
better conditions for them, and you will find that they themselves are
the enemy you will have to fight against.They'll hate you, and, if
they get the chance, they'll tear you to pieces.But if you're a
sensible man you'll use whatever talents and intelligence you possess
for your own benefit.Don't think about Socialism or any other "ism".Concentrate your mind on getting money--it doesn't matter how you get
it, but--get it.If you can't get it honestly, get it dishonestly, but
get it!and then they'll have some respect for you.''There's something in what you say,' replied Barrington, after a long
pause, 'but it's not all.Circumstances make us what we are; and
anyhow, the children are worth fighting for.''You may think so now,' said the other, 'but you'll come to see it my
way some day.As for the children--if their parents are satisfied to
let them grow up to be half-starved drudges for other people, I don't
see why you or I need trouble about it.If you like to listen to
reason,' he continued after a pause, 'I can put you on to something
that will be worth more to you than all your Socialism.''Look here: you're a Socialist; well, I'm a Socialist too: that is, I
have sense enough to believe that Socialism is practical and inevitable
and right; it will come when the majority of the people are
sufficiently enlightened to demand it, but that enlightenment will
never be brought about by reasoning or arguing with them, for these
people are simply not intellectually capable of abstract
reasoning--they can't grasp theories.You know what the late Lord
Salisbury said about them when somebody proposed to give them some free
libraries: He said: "They don't want libraries: give them a circus."You see these Liberals and Tories understand the sort of people they
have to deal with; they know that although their bodies are the bodies
of grown men, their minds are the minds of little children.That is
why it has been possible to deceive and bluff and rob them for so long.But your party persists in regarding them as rational beings, and
that's where you make a mistake--you're simply wasting your time.'The only way in which it is possible to teach these people is by means
of object lessons, and those are being placed before them in increasing
numbers every day.The trustification of industry--the object lesson
which demonstrates the possibility of collective ownership--will in
time compel even these to understand, and by the time they have learnt
that, they will also have learned by bitter experience and not from
theoretical teaching, that they must either own the trusts or perish,
and then, and not, till then, they will achieve Socialism.Do you think it will make any real
difference--for good or evil--which of these two men is elected?''Well, you can't keep them both out--you have no candidate of your
own--why should you object to earning a few pounds by helping one of
them to get in?There are plenty of voters who are doubtful what to
do; as you and I know there is every excuse for them being unable to
make up their minds which of these two candidates is the worse, a word
from your party would decide them.Since you have no candidate of your
own you will be doing no harm to Socialism and you will be doing
yourself a bit of good.If you like to come along with me now, I'll
introduce you to Sweater's agent--no one need know anything about it.'He slipped his arm through Barrington's, but the latter released
himself.'Please yourself,' said the other with an affectation of indifference.You may choose to be a Jesus Christ
if you like, but for my part I'm finished.For the future I intend to
look after myself.As for these people--they vote for what they want;
they get--what they vote for; and by God, they deserve nothing better!They are being beaten with whips of their own choosing and if I had my
way they should be chastised with scorpions!For them, the present
system means joyless drudgery, semi-starvation, rags and premature
death.Well, let them have what
they vote for--let them drudge--let them starve!'The man with the scarred face ceased speaking, and for some moments
Barrington did not reply.'I suppose there is some excuse for your feeling as you do,' he said
slowly at last, 'but it seems to me that you do not make enough
allowance for the circumstances.From their infancy most of them have
been taught by priests and parents to regard themselves and their own
class with contempt--a sort of lower animals--and to regard those who
possess wealth with veneration, as superior beings.The idea that they
are really human creatures, naturally absolutely the same as their
so-called betters, naturally equal in every way, naturally different
from them only in those ways in which their so-called superiors differ
from each other, and inferior to them only because they have been
deprived of education, culture and opportunity--you know as well as I
do that they have all been taught to regard that idea as preposterous.'The self-styled "Christian" priests who say--with their tongues in
their cheeks--that God is our Father and that all men are brethren,
have succeeded in convincing the majority of the "brethren" that it is
their duty to be content in their degradation, and to order themselves
lowly and reverently towards their masters.Your resentment should be
directed against the deceivers, not against the dupes.''Well, go and try to undeceive them,' he said, as he returned to the
platform in response to a call from his associates.'Go and try to
teach them that the Supreme Being made the earth and all its fullness
for the use and benefit of all His children.Go and try to explain to
them that they are poor in body and mind and social condition, not
because of any natural inferiority, but because they have been robbed
of their inheritance.Go and try to show them how to secure that
inheritance for themselves and their children--and see how grateful
they'll be to you.'For the next hour Barrington walked about the crowded streets in a
dispirited fashion.His conversation with the renegade seemed to have
taken all the heart out of him.He still had a number of the leaflets,
but the task of distributing them had suddenly grown distasteful and
after a while he discontinued it.Like
one awakened from a dream he saw the people who surrounded him in a
different light.For the first time he properly appreciated the
offensiveness of most of those to whom he offered the handbills; some,
without even troubling to ascertain what they were about, rudely
refused to accept them; some took them and after glancing at the
printing, crushed them in their hands and ostentatiously threw them
away.Others, who recognized him as a Socialist, angrily or
contemptuously declined them, often with curses or injurious words.His attention was presently attracted to a crowd of about thirty or
forty people, congregated near a gas lamp at the roadside.The sound
of many angry voices rose from the centre of this group, and as he
stood on the outskirts of the crowd, Barrington, being tall, was able
to look into the centre, where he saw Owen.The light of the street
lamp fell full upon the latter's pale face, as he stood silent in the
midst of a ring of infuriated men, who were all howling at him at once,
and whose malignant faces bore expressions of savage hatred, as they
shouted out the foolish accusations and slanders they had read in the
Liberal and Tory papers.Socialists wished to do away with religion and morality!All the money that the working classes had
saved up in the Post Office and the Friendly Societies, was to be
Robbed from them and divided up amongst a lot of drunken loafers who
were too lazy to work.The King and all the Royal Family were to be
Done Away with!Owen made no attempt to reply, and the manner of the crowd became every
moment more threatening.It was evident that several of them found it
difficult to refrain from attacking him.It was a splendid opportunity
of doing a little fighting without running any risks.This fellow was
all by himself, and did not appear to be much of a man even at that.Those in the middle were encouraged by shouts from others in the crowd,
who urged them to 'Go for him' and at last--almost at the instant of
Barrington's arrival--one of the heroes, unable to contain himself any
longer, lifted a heavy stick and struck Owen savagely across the face.The sight of the blood maddened the others, and in an instant everyone
who could get within striking distance joined furiously in the
onslaught, reaching eagerly over each other's shoulders, showering
blows upon him with sticks and fists, and before Barrington could reach
his side, they had Owen down on the ground, and had begun to use their
boots upon him.Barrington felt like a wild beast himself, as he fiercely fought his
way through the crowd, spurning them to right and left with fists and
elbows.He reached the centre in time to seize the uplifted arm of the
man who had led the attack and wrenching the stick from his hand, he
felled him to the ground with a single blow.The remainder shrank
back, and meantime the crowd was augmented by others who came running
up.Some of these newcomers were Liberals and some Tories, and as these did
not know what the row was about they attacked each other.The Liberals
went for those who wore Tory colours and vice versa, and in a few
seconds there was a general free fight, though most of the original
crowd ran away, and in the confusion that ended, Barrington and Owen
got out of the crowd without further molestation.Monday was the last day of the election--polling day--and in
consequence of the number of motor cars that were flying about, the
streets were hardly safe for ordinary traffic.The wealthy persons who
owned these carriages...

The result of the poll was to be shown on an illuminated sign at the
Town Hall, at eleven o'clock that night, and long before that hour a
vast crowd gathered in the adjacent streets.About ten o'clock it
began to rain, but the crowd stood its ground and increased in numbers
as the time went by.At a quarter to eleven the rain increased to a
terrible downpour, but the people remained waiting to know which hero
had conquered.Eleven o'clock came and an intense silence fell upon
the crowd, whose eyes were fixed eagerly upon the window where the sign
was to be exhibited.To judge by the extraordinary interest displayed
by these people, one might have thought that they expected to reap some
great benefit or to sustain some great loss from the result, but of
course that was not the case, for most of them knew perfectly well that
the result of this election would make no more real difference to them
than all the other elections that had gone before.There were ten thousand
voters on the register.At a quarter past eleven the sign was
illuminated, but the figures were not yet shown.Next, the names of
the two candidates were slid into sight, the figures were still
missing, but D'Encloseland's name was on top, and a hoarse roar of
triumph came from the throats of his admirers.Then the two slides
with the names were withdrawn, and the sign was again left blank.After
a time the people began to murmur at all this delay and messing about,
and presently some of them began to groan and hoot.After a few minutes the names were again slid into view, this time with
Sweater's name on top, and the figures appeared immediately afterwards:

        Sweater.4,221
        D'Encloseland.4,200

It was several seconds before the Liberals could believe their eyes; it
was too good to be true.It is impossible to say what was the reason
of the wild outburst of delighted enthusiasm that followed, but
whatever the reason, whatever the benefit was that they expected to
reap--there was the fact.They were all cheering and dancing and
shaking hands with each other, and some of them were so overcome with
inexplicable joy that they were scarcely able to speak.It was
altogether extraordinary and unaccountable.A few minutes after the declaration, Sweater appeared at the window and
made a sort of a speech, but only fragments of it were audible to the
cheering crowd who at intervals caught such phrases as 'Slashing Blow',
'Sweep the Country', 'Grand Old Liberal Flag', and so on.Next
D'Encloseland appeared and he was seen to shake hands with Mr Sweater,
whom he referred to as 'My friend'.When the two 'friends' disappeared from the window, the part of the
Liberal crowd that was not engaged in hand-to-hand fights with their
enemies--the Tories--made a rush to the front entrance of the Town
Hall, where Sweater's carriage was waiting, and as soon as he had
placed his plump rotundity inside, they took the horses out and amid
frantic cheers harnessed themselves to it instead and dragged it
through the mud and the pouring rain all the way to 'The Cave'--most of
them were accustomed to acting as beasts of burden--where he again
addressed a few words to them from the porch.Afterwards as they walked home saturated with rain and covered from
head to foot with mud, they said it was a great victory for the cause
of progress!Chapter 49

The Undesired


That evening about seven o'clock, whilst Easton was down-town seeing
the last of the election, Ruth's child was born.After the doctor was gone, Mary Linden stayed with her during the hours
that elapsed before Easton came home, and downstairs Elsie and
Charley--who were allowed to stay up late to help their mother because
Mrs Easton was ill--crept about very quietly, and conversed in hushed
tones as they washed up the tea things and swept the floor and tidied
the kitchen.Easton did not return until after midnight, and all through the
intervening hours, Ruth, weak and tired, but unable to sleep, was lying
in bed with the child by her side.Her wide-open eyes appeared
unnaturally large and brilliant, in contrast with the almost death-like
paleness of her face, and there was a look of fear in them, as she
waited and listened for the sound of Easton's footsteps.Outside, the silence of the night was disturbed by many unusual noises:
a far-off roar, as of the breaking of waves on a seashore, arose from
the direction of the town, where the last scenes of the election were
being enacted.Every few minutes motor cars rushed past the house at a
furious rate, and the air was full of the sounds of distant shouts and
singing.Ruth listened and started nervously at every passing footstep.Those
who can imagine the kind of expression there would be upon the face of
a hunted thief, who, finding himself encompassed and brought to bay by
his pursuers, looks wildly around in a vain search for some way of
escape, may be able to form some conception of the terror-stricken way
in which she listened to every sound that penetrated into the stillness
of the dimly lighted room.And ever and again, when her wandering
glance reverted to the frail atom of humanity nestling by her side, her
brows contracted and her eyes filled with bitter tears, as she weakly
reached out her trembling hand to adjust its coverings, faintly
murmuring, with quivering lips and a bursting heart, some words of
endearment and pity.And then--alarmed by the footsteps of some chance
passerby, or by the closing of the door of a neighbouring house, and
fearing that it was the sound she had been waiting for and dreading
through all those weary hours, she would turn in terror to Mary Linden,
sitting in the chair at the bedside, sewing by the light of the shaded
lamp, and take hold of her arm as if seeking protection from some
impending danger.It was after twelve o'clock when Easton came home.Ruth recognized his
footsteps before he reached the house, and her heart seemed to stop
beating when she heard the clang of the gate, as it closed after he had
passed through.It had been Mary's intention to withdraw before he came into the room,
but the sick woman clung to her in such evident fear, and entreated her
so earnestly not to go away, that she remained.It was with a feeling of keen disappointment that Easton noticed how
Ruth shrank away from him, for he had expected and hoped, that after
this, they would be good friends once more; but he tried to think that
it was because she was ill, and when she would not let him touch the
child lest he should awaken it, he agreed without question.The next day, and for the greater part of the time during the next
fortnight, Ruth was in a raging fever.There were intervals when
although weak and exhausted, she was in her right mind, but most of the
time she was quite unconscious of her surroundings and often delirious.Mrs Owen came every day to help to look after her, because Mary just
then had a lot of needlework to do, and consequently could only give
part of her time to Ruth, who, in her delirium, lived and told over and
over again all the sorrow and suffering of the last few months.And so
the two friends, watching by her bedside, learned her dreadful secret.Sometimes--in her delirium--she seemed possessed of an intense and
terrible loathing for the poor little creature she had brought into the
world, and was with difficulty prevented from doing it violence.Once
she seized it cruelly and threw it fiercely from her to the foot of the
bed, as if it had been some poisonous or loathsome thing.And so it
often became necessary to take the child away out of the room, so that
she could not see or hear it, but when her senses came back to her, her
first thought was for the child, and there must have been in her mind
some faint recollection of what she had said and done in her madness,
for when she saw that the baby was not in its accustomed place her
distress and alarm were painful to see, as she entreated them with
tears to give it back to her.And then she would kiss and fondle it
with all manner of endearing words, and cry bitterly.Easton did not see or hear most of this; he only knew that she was very
ill; for he went out every day on the almost hopeless quest for work.Rushton's had next to nothing to do, and most of the other shops were
in a similar plight.Dauber and Botchit had one or two jobs going on,
and Easton tried several times to get a start for them, but was always
told they were full up.The sweating methods of this firm continued to
form a favourite topic of conversation with the unemployed workmen, who
railed at and cursed them horribly.It had leaked out that they were
paying only sixpence an hour to most of the skilled workmen in their
employment, and even then the conditions under which they worked were,
if possible, worse than those obtaining at most other firms.The men
were treated like so many convicts, and every job was a hell where
driving and bullying reigned supreme, and obscene curses and blasphemy
polluted the air from morning till night.The resentment of those who
were out of work was directed, not only against the heads of the firm,
but also against the miserable, half-starved drudges in their
employment.These poor wretches were denounced as'scabs' and
'wastrels' by the unemployed workmen but all the same, whenever Dauber
and Botchit wanted some extra hands they never had any difficulty in
obtaining them, and it often happened that those who had been loudest
and bitterest in their denunciations were amongst the first to rush off
eagerly to apply there for a job whenever there was a chance of getting
one.Frequently the light was seen burning late at night in Rushton's
office, where Nimrod and his master were figuring out prices and
writing out estimates, cutting down the amounts to the lowest possible
point in the hope of underbidding their rivals.Now and then they were
successful but whether they secured the work or not, Nimrod always
appeared equally miserable.If they got the 'job' it often showed such
a small margin of profit that Rushton used to grumble at him and
suggest mismanagement.If their estimates were too high and they lost
the work, he used to demand of Nimrod why it was possible for Dauber
and Botchit to do work so much more cheaply.As the unemployed workmen stood in groups at the corners or walked
aimlessly about the streets, they often saw Hunter pass by on his
bicycle, looking worried and harassed.He was such a picture of
misery, that it began to be rumoured amongst the men, that he had never
been the same since the time he had that fall off the bike; and some of
them declared, that they wouldn't mind betting that ole Misery would
finish up by going off his bloody rocker.At intervals--whenever a job came in--Owen, Crass, Slyme, Sawkins and
one or two others, continued to be employed at Rushton's, but they
seldom managed to make more than two or three days a week, even when
there was anything to do.Chapter 50

Sundered


During the next few weeks Ruth continued very ill.Although the
delirium had left her and did not return, her manner was still very
strange, and it was remarkable that she slept but little and at long
intervals.Mrs Owen came to look after her every day, not going back
to her own home till the evening.Frankie used to call for her as he
came out of school and then they used to go home together, taking
little Freddie Easton with them also, for his own mother was not able
to look after him and Mary Linden had so much other work to do.On Wednesday evening, when the child was about five weeks old, as Mrs
Owen was wishing her good night, Ruth took hold of her hand and after
saying how grateful she was for all that she had done, she asked
whether--supposing anything happened to herself--Nora would promise to
take charge of Freddie for Easton.Owen's wife gave the required
promise, at the same time affecting to regard the supposition as
altogether unlikely, and assuring her that she would soon be better,
but she secretly wondered why Ruth had not mentioned the other child as
well.Nora went away about five o'clock, leaving Ruth's bedroom door open so
that Mrs Linden could hear her call if she needed anything.About a
quarter of an hour after Nora and the two children had gone, Mary
Linden went upstairs to see Ruth, who appeared to have fallen fast
asleep; so she returned to her needlework downstairs.The weather had
been very cloudy all day, there had been rain at intervals and it was a
dark evening, so dark that she had to light the lamp to see her work.Charley sat on the hearthrug in front of the fire repairing one of the
wheels of a wooden cart that he had made with the assistance of another
boy, and Elsie busied herself preparing the tea.Easton was not yet home; Rushton & Co.had a few jobs to do and he had
been at work since the previous Thursday.The place where he was
working was some considerable distance away, so it was nearly half past
six when he came home.They heard him at the gate and at her mother's
direction Elsie went quickly to the front door, which was ajar, to ask
him to walk as quietly as possible so as not to wake Ruth.Mary had prepared the table for his tea in the kitchen, where there was
a bright fire with the kettle singing on the hob.He lit the lamp and
after removing his hat and overcoat, put the kettle on the fire and
while he was waiting for it to boil he went softly upstairs.There was
no lamp burning in the bedroom and the place would have been in utter
darkness but for the red glow of the fire, which did not dispel the
prevailing obscurity sufficiently to enable him to discern the
different objects in the room distinctly.The intense silence that
reigned struck him with a sudden terror.He crossed swiftly over to
the bed and a moment's examination sufficed to tell him that it was
empty.He called her name, but there was no answer, and a hurried
search only made it certain that she was nowhere in the house.Mrs Linden now remembered what Owen's wife had told her of the strange
request that Ruth had made, and as she recounted it to Easton, his
fears became intensified a thousandfold.He was unable to form any
opinion of the reason of her going or of where she had gone, as he
rushed out to seek for her.Almost unconsciously he directed his steps
to Owen's house, and afterwards the two men went to every place where
they thought it possible she might have gone, but without finding any
trace of her.Her father lived a short distance outside the town, and this was one of
the first places they went to, although Easton did not think it likely
she would go there, for she had not been on friendly terms with her
stepmother, and as he had anticipated, it was a fruitless journey.They sought for her in every conceivable place, returning often to
Easton's house to see if she had come home, but they found no trace of
her, nor met anyone who had seen her, which was, perhaps, because the
dreary, rain-washed streets were deserted by all except those whose
business compelled them to be out.About eleven o'clock Nora was standing at the front door waiting for
Owen and Easton, when she thought she could discern a woman's figure in
the shadow of the piers of the gate opposite.It was an unoccupied
house with a garden in front, and the outlines of the bushes it
contained were so vague in the darkness that it was impossible to be
certain; but the longer she looked the more convinced she became that
there was someone there.At last she summoned sufficient courage to
cross over the road, and as she nervously drew near the gate it became
evident that she had not been mistaken.There was a woman standing
there--a woman with a child in her arms, leaning against one of the
pillars and holding the iron bars of the gate with her left hand.Nora recognized her even in the semi-darkness.Her attitude
was one of extreme exhaustion, and as Nora touched her, she perceived
that she was wet through and trembling; but although she was almost
fainting with fatigue she would not consent to go indoors until
repeatedly assured that Easton was not there, and that Nora would not
let him see her if he came.And when at length she yielded and went
into the house she would not sit down or take off her hat or jacket
until--crouching on the floor beside Nora's chair with her face hidden
in the latter's lap--she had sobbed out her pitiful confession, the
same things that she had unwittingly told to the same hearer so often
before during the illness, the only fact that was new was the account
of her wanderings that night.She cried so bitterly and looked so forlorn and heartbroken and ashamed
as she faltered out her woeful story; so consumed with
self-condemnation, making no excuse for herself except to repeat over
and over again that she had never meant to do wrong, that Nora could
not refrain from weeping also as she listened.It appeared that, unable to bear the reproach that Easton's presence
seemed to imply, or to endure the burden of her secret any longer, and
always haunted by the thought of the lake in the park, Ruth had formed
the dreadful resolution of taking her own life and the child's.When
she arrived at the park gates they were closed and locked for the night
but she remembered that there was another means of entering--the place
at the far end of the valley where the park was not fenced in, so she
had gone there--nearly three miles--only to find that railings had
recently been erected and therefore it was no longer possible to get
into the park by that way.And then, when she found it impossible to
put her resolve into practice, she had realized for the first time the
folly and wickedness of the act she had meant to commit.But although
she had abandoned her first intention, she said she could never go home
again; she would take a room somewhere and get some work to do, or
perhaps she might be able to get a situation where they would allow her
to have the child with her, or failing that she would work and pay
someone to look after it; but she could never go home any more.If she
only had somewhere to stay for a few days until she could get something
to do, she was sure she would be able to earn her living, but she could
not go back home; she felt that she would rather walk about the streets
all night than go there again.It was arranged that Ruth should have the small apartment which had
been Frankie's playroom, the necessary furniture being obtained from a
second-hand shop close by.Easton did not learn the real reason of her
flight until three days afterwards.At first he attributed it to a
recurrence of the mental disorder that she had suffered from after the
birth of the child, and he had been glad to leave her at Owen's place
in Nora's care, but on the evening of the third day when he returned
home from work, he found a letter in Ruth's handwriting which told him
all there was to tell.When he recovered from the stupefaction into which he was thrown by the
perusal of this letter, his first thought was to seek out Slyme, but he
found upon inquiring that the latter had left the town the previous
morning.Slyme's landlady said he had told her that he had been
offered several months' work in London, which he had accepted.The
truth was that Slyme had heard of Ruth's flight--nearly everyone knew
about it as a result of the inquiries that had been made for her--and,
guessing the cause, he had prudently cleared out.Easton made no attempt to see Ruth, but he went to Owen's and took
Freddie away, saying he would pay Mrs Linden to look after the child
whilst he was at work.His manner was that of a deeply injured
man--the possibility that he was in any way to blame for what had
happened did not seem to occur to his mind at all.As for Ruth she made no resistance to his taking the child away from
her, although she cried about it in secret.She got some work a few
days afterwards--helping the servants at one of the large
boarding-houses on the Grand Parade.Nora looked after the baby for her while she was at work, an
arrangement that pleased Frankie vastly; he said it was almost as good
as having a baby of their very own.For the first few weeks after Ruth went away Easton tried to persuade
himself that he did not very much regret what had happened.Mrs Linden
looked after Freddie, and Easton tried to believe that he would really
be better off now that he had only himself and the child to provide for.At first, whenever he happened to meet Owen, they used to speak of
Ruth, or to be more correct, Easton used to speak of her; but one day
when the two men were working together Owen had expressed himself
rather offensively.He seemed to think that Easton was more to blame
than she was; and afterwards they avoided the subject, although Easton
found it difficult to avoid the thoughts the other man's words
suggested.Now and then he heard of Ruth and learnt that she was still working at
the same place; and once he met her suddenly and unexpectedly in the
street.They passed each other hurriedly and he did not see the
scarlet flush that for an instant dyed her face, nor the deathly pallor
that succeeded it.He never went to Owen's place or sent any communication to Ruth, nor
did she ever send him any; but although Easton did not know it she
frequently saw Freddie, for when Elsie Linden took the child out she
often called to see Mrs Owen.As time went on and the resentment he had felt towards her lost its
first bitterness, Easton began to think there was perhaps some little
justification for what Owen had said, and gradually there grew within
him an immense desire for reconciliation--to start afresh and to forget
all that had happened; but the more he thought of this the more
hopeless and impossible of realization it seemed.Although perhaps he was not conscious of it, this desire arose solely
from selfish motives.The money he earned seemed to melt away almost
as soon as he received it; to his surprise he found that he was not
nearly so well off in regard to personal comfort as he had been
formerly, and the house seemed to grow more dreary and desolate as the
wintry days dragged slowly by.Sometimes--when he had the money--he
sought forgetfulness in the society of Crass and the other frequenters
of the Cricketers, but somehow or other he could not take the same
pleasure in the conversation of these people as formerly, when he had
found it--as he now sometimes wondered to remember--so entertaining as
to almost make him forget Ruth's existence.One evening about three weeks before Christmas, as he and Owen were
walking homewards together from work, Easton reverted for the first
time to their former conversation.He spoke with a superior air: his
manner and tone indicating that he thought he was behaving with great
generosity.He would be willing to forgive her and have her back, he
said, if she would come: but he would never be able to tolerate the
child.Of course it might be sent to an orphanage or some similar
institution, but he was afraid Ruth would never consent to that, and he
knew that her stepmother would not take it.'If you can persuade her to return to you, we'll take the child,' said
Owen.'Do you think your wife would be willing?'We thought it a possible way for you, and my wife would
like to have the child.''But would you be able to afford it?''Of course,' said Easton, 'if Slyme comes back he might agree to pay
something for its keep.'After a long pause Easton continued: 'Would you mind asking Mrs Owen to
suggest it to Ruth?''If you like I'll get her to suggest it--as a message from you.''What I meant,' said Easton hesitatingly, 'was that your wife might
just suggest it--casual like--and advise her that it would be the best
way, and then you could let me know what Ruth said.''No,' replied Owen, unable any longer to control his resentment of the
other's manner, 'as things stand now, if it were not for the other
child, I should advise her to have nothing further to do with you.You
seem to think that you are acting a very generous part in being
"willing" to have her back, but she's better off now than she was with
you.I see no reason--except for the other child--why she should go
back to you.As far as I understand it, you had a good wife and you
ill-treated her.'I never raised my hand to her--at least only
once, and then I didn't hurt her.'Oh no: from what my wife tells me she only blames herself, but I'm
drawing my own conclusions.You may not have struck her, but you did
worse--you treated her with indifference and exposed her to temptation.What has happened is the natural result of your neglect and want of
care for her.The responsibility for what has happened is mainly
yours, but apparently you wish to pose now as being very generous and
to "forgive her"--you're "willing" to take her back; but it seems to me
that it would be more fitting that you should ask her to forgive you.'Easton made no answer and after a long silence the other continued:

'I would not advise her to go back to you on such terms as you seem to
think right, because if you became reconciled on such terms I don't
think either of you could be happy.Your only chance of happiness is
to realize that you have both done wrong; that each of you has
something to forgive; to forgive and never speak of it again.'Easton made no reply and a few minutes afterwards, their ways
diverging, they wished each other 'Good night'.They were working for Rushton--painting the outside of a new
conservatory at Mr Sweater's house, 'The Cave'.This job was finished
the next day and at four o'clock the boy brought the handcart, which
they loaded with their ladders and other materials.They took these
back to the yard and then, as it was Friday night, they went up to the
front shop and handed in their time sheets.Afterwards, as they were
about to separate, Easton again referred to the subject of their
conversation of the previous evening.He had been very reserved and
silent all day, scarcely uttering a word except when the work they had
been engaged in made it necessary to do so, and there was now a sort of
catch in his voice as he spoke.'I've been thinking over what you said last night; it's quite true.I wrote to Ruth last night and
admitted it to her.I'll take it as a favour if you and your wife will
say what you can to help me get her back.'Owen stretched out his hand and as the other took it, said: 'You may
rely on us both to do our best.'Chapter 51

The Widow's Son


The next morning when they went to the yard at half past eight o'clock
Hunter told them that there was nothing to do, but that they had better
come on Monday in case some work came in.They accordingly went on the
Monday, and Tuesday and Wednesday, but as nothing 'came in' of course
they did not do any work.On Thursday morning the weather was dark and
bitterly cold.The sky presented an unbroken expanse of dull grey and
a keen north wind swept through the cheerless streets.Owen--who had
caught cold whilst painting the outside of the conservatory at
Sweater's house the previous week--did not get to the yard until ten
o'clock.He felt so ill that he would not have gone at all if they had
not needed the money he would be able to earn if there was anything to
do.Strange though it may appear to the advocates of thrift, although
he had been so fortunate as to be in employment when so many others
were idle, they had not saved any money.On the contrary, during all
the summer they had not been able to afford to have proper food or
clothing.Every week most of the money went to pay arrears of rent or
some other debts, so that even whilst he was at work they had often to
go without some of the necessaries of life.They had broken boots,
shabby, insufficient clothing, and barely enough to eat.The weather had become so bitterly cold that, fearing he would be laid
up if he went without it any longer, he took his overcoat out of pawn,
and that week they had to almost starve.Not that it was much better
other weeks, for lately he had only been making six and a half hours a
day--from eight-thirty in the morning till four o'clock in the evening,
and on Saturday only four and a half hours--from half past eight till
one.This made his wages--at sevenpence an hour--twenty-one shillings
and sevenpence a week--that is, when there was work to do every day,
which was not always.Sometimes they had to stand idle three days out
of six.The wages of those who got sixpence halfpenny came out at one
pound and twopence--when they worked every day--and as for those
who--like Sawkins--received only fivepence, their week's wages amounted
to fifteen and sixpence.When they were only employed for two or three days or perhaps only a
few hours, their 'Saturday night' sometimes amounted to half a
sovereign, seven and sixpence, five shillings or even less.Then most
of them said that it was better than nothing at all.Many of them were married men, so, in order to make existence possible,
their wives went out charing or worked in laundries.They had children
whom they had to bring up for the most part on'skim' milk, bread,
margarine, and adulterated tea.Many of these children--little mites
of eight or nine years--went to work for two or three hours in the
morning before going to school; the same in the evening after school,
and all day on Saturday, carrying butchers' trays loaded with meat,
baskets of groceries and vegetables, cans of paraffin oil, selling or
delivering newspapers, and carrying milk.As soon as they were old
enough they got Half Time certificates and directly they were fourteen
they left school altogether and went to work all the day.When they
were old enough some of them tried to join the Army or Navy, but were
found physically unfit.It is not much to be wondered at that when they became a little older
they were so degenerate intellectually that they imagined that the
surest way to obtain better conditions would be to elect gangs of
Liberal and Tory land-grabbers, sweaters, swindlers and lawyers to rule
over them.When Owen arrived at the yard he found Bert White cleaning out the
dirty pots in the paint-shop.The noise he made with the scraping
knife prevented him from hearing Owen's approach and the latter stood
watching him for some minutes without speaking.The stone floor of the
paint shop was damp and shiny and the whole place was chilly as a tomb.The boy was trembling with cold and he looked pitifully undersized and
frail as he bent over his work with an old apron girt about him.Because it was so cold he was wearing his jacket with the ends of the
sleeves turned back to keep them clean, or to prevent them getting any
dirtier, for they were already in the same condition as the rest of his
attire, which was thickly encrusted with dried paint of many colours,
and his hands and fingernails were grimed with it.As he watched the poor boy bending over his task, Owen thought of
Frankie, and with a feeling akin to terror wondered whether he would
ever be in a similar plight.When he saw Owen, the boy left off working and wished him good morning,
remarking that it was very cold.There's lots of wood lying about the
yard.'Misery
wouldn't 'arf ramp if 'e caught me at it.I used to 'ave a fire 'ere
last winter till Rushton found out, and 'e kicked up an orful row and
told me to move meself and get some work done and then I wouldn't feel
the cold.''Oh, he said that, did he?'said Owen, his pale face becoming suddenly
suffused with blood.He went out into the yard and crossing over to where--under a
shed--there was a great heap of waste wood, stuff that had been taken
out of places where Rushton & Co.had made alterations, he gathered an
armful of it and was returning to the paintshop when Sawkins accosted
him.'You mustn't go burnin' any of that, you know!That's all got to be
saved and took up to the bloke's house.Misery spoke about it only
this mornin'.'He carried the wood into the shop and after
throwing it into the fireplace he poured some old paint over it, and,
applying a match, produced a roaring fire.Then he brought in several
more armfuls of wood and piled them in a corner of the shop.Bert took
no part in these proceedings, and at first rather disapproved of them
because he was afraid there would be trouble when Misery came, but when
the fire was an accomplished fact he warmed his hands and shifted his
work to the other side of the bench so as to get the benefit of the
heat.Owen waited for about half an hour to see if Hunter would return, but
as that disciple did not appear, he decided not to wait any longer.Before leaving he gave Bert some instructions:

'Keep up the fire with all the old paint that you can scrape off those
things and any other old paint or rubbish that's here, and whenever it
grows dull put more wood on.There's a lot of old stuff here that's of
no use except to be thrown away or burnt.If Hunter says
anything, tell him that I lit the fire, and that I told you to keep it
burning.If you want more wood, go out and take it.'On his way out Owen spoke to Sawkins.His manner was so menacing, his
face so pale, and there was such a strange glare in his eyes, that the
latter thought of the talk there had been about Owen being mad, and
felt half afraid of him.'I am going to the office to see Rushton; if Hunter comes here, you say
I told you to tell him that if I find the boy in that shop again
without a fire, I'll report it to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children.And as for you, if the boy comes out here to get
more wood, don't you attempt to interfere with him.''I don't want to interfere with the bloody kid,' grunted Sawkins.'It
seems to me as if he's gorn orf 'is bloody crumpet,' he added as he
watched Owen walking rapidly down the street.'I can't understand why
people can't mind their own bloody business: anyone would think the boy
belonged to 'IM.'That was just how the matter presented itself to Owen.The idea that
it was his own child who was to be treated in this way possessed and
infuriated him as he strode savagely along.In the vicinity of the
Slave Market on the Grand Parade he passed--without seeing
them--several groups of unemployed artisans whom he knew.Some of them
were offended and remarked that he was getting stuck up, but others,
observing how strange he looked, repeated the old prophecy that one of
these days Owen would go out of his mind.As he drew near to his destination large flakes of snow began to fall.He walked so rapidly and was in such a fury that by the time he reached
the shop he was scarcely able to speak.'Is--Hunter--or Rushton here?''Hunter isn't, but the guv'nor is.'He'll soon--know--that,' panted Owen as he strode up to the office
door, and without troubling to knock, flung it violently open and
entered.The atmosphere of this place was very different from that of the damp
cellar where Bert was working.A grate fitted with asbestos blocks and
lit with gas communicated a genial warmth to the air.Rushton was standing leaning over Miss Wade's chair with his left arm
round her neck.Owen recollected afterwards that her dress was
disarranged.She retired hastily to the far end of the room as Rushton
jumped away from her, and stared in amazement and confusion at the
intruder--he was too astonished and embarrassed to speak.Owen stood
panting and quivering in the middle of the office and pointed a
trembling finger at his employer:

'I've come--here--to tell--you--that--if I find young--Bert
White--working--down in that shop--without a fire--I'll have you
prosecuted.The place is not good enough for a stable--if you owned a
valuable dog--you wouldn't keep it there--I give you fair warning--I
know--enough--about you--to put you--where you deserve to be--if you
don't treat him better I'll have you punished I'll show you up.'Rushton continued to stare at him in mingled confusion, fear and
perplexity; he did not yet comprehend exactly what it was all about; he
was guiltily conscious of so many things which he might reasonably fear
to be shown up or prosecuted for if they were known, and the fact of
being caught under such circumstances with Miss Wade helped to reduce
him to a condition approaching terror.'If the boy has been there without a fire, I 'aven't known anything
about it,' he stammered at last.'Mr 'Unter has charge of all those
matters.''You--yourself--forbade him--to make a fire last winter--and
anyhow--you know about it now.You obtained money from his mother
under the pretence--that you were going--to teach him a trade--but for
the last twelve months--you have been using him--as if he were--a beast
of burden.I advise you to see to it--or I shall--find--means--to make
you--wish you had done so.'With this Owen turned and went out, leaving the door open, and Rushton
in a state of mind compounded of fear, amazement and anger.As he walked homewards through the snow-storm, Owen began to realize
that the consequence of what he had done would be that Rushton would
not give him any more work, and as he reflected on all that this would
mean to those at home, for a moment he doubted whether he had done
right.But when he told Nora what had happened she said there were
plenty of other firms in the town who would employ him--when they had
the work.He had done without Rushton before and could do so again;
for her part--whatever the consequences might be--she was glad that he
had acted as he did.'We'll get through somehow, I suppose,' said Owen, wearily.'There's
not much chance of getting a job anywhere else just now, but I shall
try to get some work on my own account.I shall do some samples of
show-cards the same as I did last winter and try to get orders from
some of the shops--they usually want something extra at this time, but
I'm afraid it is rather too late: most of them already have all they
want.''I shouldn't go out again today if I were you,' said Nora, noticing how
ill he looked.'You should stay at home and read, or write up those
minutes.'The minutes referred to were those of the last meeting of the local
branch of the Painters' Society, of which Owen was the secretary, and
as the snow continued to fall, he occupied himself after dinner in the
manner his wife suggested, until four o'clock, when Frankie returned
from school bringing with him a large snowball, and crying out as a
piece of good news that the snow was still falling heavily, and that he
believed it was freezing!They went to bed very early that night, for it was necessary to
economize the coal, and not only that, but--because the rooms were so
near the roof--it was not possible to keep the place warm no matter how
much coal was used.The fire seemed, if anything, to make the place
colder, for it caused the outer air to pour in through the joints of
the ill-fitting doors and windows.Owen lay awake for the greater part of the night.The terror of the
future made rest or sleep impossible.He got up very early the next
morning--long before it was light--and after lighting the fire, set
about preparing the samples he had mentioned to Nora, but found that it
would not be possible to do much in this direction without buying more
cardboard, for most of what he had was not in good condition.They had bread and butter and tea for breakfast.Frankie had his in
bed and it was decided to keep him away from school until after dinner
because the weather was so very cold and his only pair of boots were so
saturated with moisture from having been out in the snow the previous
day.'I shall make a few inquiries to see if there's any other work to be
had before I buy the cardboard,' said Owen, 'although I'm afraid it's
not much use.'Just as he was preparing to go out, the front door bell rang, and as he
was going down to answer it he saw Bert White coming upstairs.The boy
was carrying a flat, brown-paper parcel under his arm.'A corfin plate,' he explained as he arrived at the door.'Wanted at
once--Misery ses you can do it at 'ome, an' I've got to wait for it.'Owen and his wife looked at each other with intense relief.So he was
not to be dismissed after all.'There's a piece of paper inside the parcel with the name of the party
what's dead,' continued Bert, 'and here's a little bottle of Brunswick
black for you to do the inscription with.''Yes: he told me to tell you there's a job to be started Monday
morning--a couple of rooms to be done out somewhere.Got to be
finished by Thursday; and there's another job 'e wants you to do this
afternoon--after dinner--so you've got to come to the yard at one
o'clock.'E told me to tell you 'e meant to leave a message for you
yesterday morning, but 'e forgot.''What did he say to you about the fire--anything?''Yes: they both of 'em came about an hour after you went away--Misery
and the Bloke too--but they didn't kick up a row.I wasn't arf
frightened, I can tell you, when I saw 'em both coming, but they was
quite nice.The Bloke ses to me, "Ah, that's right, my boy," 'e ses.I'm going to send you some coke," 'e ses.And
then they 'ad a look round and 'e told Sawkins to put some new panes of
glass where the winder was broken, and--you know that great big
packing-case what was under the truck shed?''Well, 'e told Sawkins to saw it up and cover over the stone floor of
the paint-shop with it.It ain't 'arf all right there now.I've
cleared out all the muck from under the benches and we've got two sacks
of coke sent from the gas-works, and the Bloke told me when that's all
used up I've got to get a order orf Miss Wade for another lot.'At one o'clock Owen was at the yard, where he saw Misery, who
instructed him to go to the front shop and paint some numbers on the
racks where the wallpapers were stored.Whilst he was doing this work
Rushton came in and greeted him in a very friendly way.'I'm very glad you let me know about the boy working in that
paint-shop,' he observed after a few preliminary remarks.'I can
assure you as I don't want the lad to be uncomfortable, but you know I
can't attend to everything myself.I'm much obliged to you for telling
me about it; I think you did quite right; I should have done the same
myself.'Owen did not know what to reply, but Rushton walked off without
waiting...



Chapter 52

'It's a Far, Far Better Thing that I do, than I have Ever Done'


Although Owen, Easton and Crass and a few others were so lucky as to
have had a little work to do during the last few months, the majority
of their fellow workmen had been altogether out of employment most of
the time, and meanwhile the practical business-men, and the pretended
disciples of Christ--the liars and hypocrites who professed to believe
that all men are brothers and God their Father--had continued to enact
the usual farce that they called 'Dealing' with the misery that
surrounded them on every side.They continued to organize 'Rummage'
and 'Jumble' sales and bazaars, and to distribute their rotten cast-off
clothes and boots and their broken victuals and soup to such of the
Brethren as were sufficiently degraded to beg for them.The beautiful
Distress Committee was also in full operation; over a thousand Brethren
had registered themselves on its books.Of this number--after careful
investigation--the committee had found that no fewer than six hundred
and seventy-two were deserving of being allowed to work for their
living.The Committee would probably have given these six hundred and
seventy-two the necessary permission, but it was somewhat handicapped
by the fact that the funds at its disposal were only sufficient to
enable that number of Brethren to be employed for about three days.However, by adopting a policy of temporizing, delay, and general artful
dodging, the Committee managed to create the impression that they were
Dealing with the Problem.If it had not been for a cunning device invented by Brother Rushton, a
much larger number of the Brethren would have succeeded in registering
themselves as unemployed on the books of the Committee.In previous
years it had been the practice to issue an application form called a
'Record Paper' to any Brother who asked for one, and the Brother
returned it after filling it in himself.At a secret meeting of the
Committee Rushton proposed--amid laughter and applause, it was such a
good joke--a new and better way, calculated to keep down the number of
applicants.The result of this innovation was that no more forms were
issued, but the applicants for work were admitted into the office one
at a time, and were there examined by a junior clerk, somewhat after
the manner of a French Juge d'Instruction interrogating a criminal, the
clerk filling in the form according to the replies of the culprit.'Where did you live before you went there?''How long were you living at that place?''Did you owe any rent when you left?''What is your Trade, Calling, Employment, or Occupation?''Are you Married or single or a Widower or what?''What kind of a house do you live in?'What have you been doing for the last five years?What kind of work,
how many hours a day?'Give the full names and addresses of all the different employers you
have worked for during the last five years, and the reasons why you
left them?''Give the names of all the foremen you have worked under during the
last five years?''Do you get any money from any Club or Society, or from any Charity, or
from any other source?''Have you ever worked for a Distress Committee before?''Have you ever done any other kinds of work than those you have
mentioned?Do you think you would be fit for any other kind?When the criminal had answered all the questions, and when his answers
had all been duly written down, he was informed that a member of the
Committee, or an Authorized Officer, or some Other Person, would in due
course visit his home and make inquiries about him, after which the
Authorized Officer or Other Person would make a report to the
Committee, who would consider it at their next meeting.As the interrogation of each criminal occupied about half an hour, to
say nothing of the time he was kept waiting, it will be seen that as a
means of keeping down the number of registered unemployed the idea
worked splendidly.When Rushton introduced this new rule it was carried unanimously, Dr
Weakling being the only dissentient, but of course he--as Brother
Grinder remarked--was always opposed to any sensible proposal.There
was one consolation, however, Grinder added, they was not likely to be
pestered with 'im much longer; the first of November was coming and if
he--Grinder--knowed anything of working men they was sure to give
Weakling the dirty kick out directly they got the chance.A few days afterwards the result of the municipal election justified
Brother Grinder's prognostications, for the working men voters of Dr
Weakling's ward did give him the dirty kick out: but Rushton, Didlum,
Grinder and several other members of the band were triumphantly
returned with increased majorities.Mr Dauber, of Dauber and Botchit, had already been elected a Guardian
of the Poor.During all this time Hunter, who looked more worried and miserable as
the dreary weeks went by, was occupied every day in supervising what
work was being done and in running about seeking for more.Nearly
every night he remained at the office until a late hour, poring over
specifications and making out estimates.The police had become so
accustomed to seeing the light in the office that as a rule they took
no notice of it, but one Thursday night--exactly one week after the
scene between Owen and Rushton about the boy--the constable on the beat
observed the light there much later than usual.At first he paid no
particular attention to the fact, but when night merged into morning
and the light still remained, his curiosity was aroused.He knocked at the door, but no one came in answer, and no sound
disturbed the deathlike stillness that reigned within.The door was
locked, but he was not able to tell whether it had been closed from the
inside or outside, because it had a spring latch.The office window
was low down, but it was not possible to see in because the back of the
glass had been painted.The constable thought that the most probable explanation of the mystery
was that whoever had been there earlier in the evening had forgotten to
turn out the light when they went away; it was not likely that thieves
or anyone who had no business to be there would advertise their
presence by lighting the gas.He made a note of the incident in his pocket-book and was about to
resume his beat when he was joined by his inspector.The latter agreed
that the conclusion arrived at by the constable was probably the right
one and they were about to pass on when the inspector noticed a small
speck of light shining through the lower part of the painted window,
where a small piece of the paint had either been scratched or had
shelled off the glass.He knelt down and found that it was possible to
get a view of the interior of the office, and as he peered through he
gave a low exclamation.When he made way for his subordinate to look
in his turn, the constable was with some difficulty able to distinguish
the figure of a man lying prone upon the floor.It was an easy task for the burly policeman to force open the office
door: a single push of his shoulder wrenched it from its fastenings and
as it flew back the socket of the lock fell with a splash into a great
pool of blood that had accumulated against the threshold, flowing from
the place where Hunter was lying on his back, his arms extended and his
head nearly severed from his body.On the floor, close to his right
hand, was an open razor.An overturned chair lay on the floor by the
side of the table where he usually worked, the table itself being
littered with papers and drenched with blood.Within the next few days Crass resumed the role he had played when
Hunter was ill during the summer, taking charge of the work and
generally doing his best to fill the dead man's place, although--as he
confided to certain of his cronies in the bar of the Cricketers--he had
no intention of allowing Rushton to do the same as Hunter had done.One of his first jobs--on the morning after the discovery of the
body--was to go with Mr Rushton to look over a house where some work
was to be done for which an estimate had to be given.It was this
estimate that Hunter had been trying to make out the previous evening
in the office, for they found that the papers on his table were covered
with figures and writing relating to this work.These papers justified
the subsequent verdict of the Coroner's jury that Hunter committed
suicide in a fit of temporary insanity, for they were covered with a
lot of meaningless scribbling, the words wrongly spelt and having no
intelligible connection with each other.There was one sum that he had
evidently tried repeatedly to do correctly, but which came wrong in a
different way every time.The fact that he had the razor in his
possession seemed to point to his having premeditated the act, but this
was accounted for at the inquest by the evidence of the last person who
saw him alive, a hairdresser, who stated that Hunter had left the razor
with him to be sharpened a few days previously and that he had called
for it on the evening of the tragedy.He had ground this razor for Mr
Hunter several times before.Crass took charge of all the arrangements for the funeral.He bought a
new second-hand pair of black trousers at a cast-off clothing shop in
honour of the occasion, and discarded his own low-crowned silk
hat--which was getting rather shabby--in favour of Hunter's tall one,
which he found in the office and annexed without hesitation or scruple.It was rather large for him, but he put some folded strips of paper
inside the leather lining.Crass was a proud man as he walked in
Hunter's place at the head of the procession, trying to look solemn,
but with a half-smile on his fat, pasty face, destitute of colour
except one spot on his chin near his underlip, where there was a small
patch of inflammation about the size of a threepenny piece.This spot
had been there for a very long time.At first--as well as he could
remember--it was only a small pimple, but it had grown larger, with
something the appearance of scurvy.Crass attributed its continuation
to the cold having 'got into it last winter'.It was rather strange,
too, because he generally took care of himself when it was cold: he
always wore the warm wrap that had formerly belonged to the old lady
who died of cancer.However, Crass did not worry much about this
little sore place; he just put a little zinc ointment on it
occasionally and had no doubt that it would get well in time.Chapter 53

Barrington Finds a Situation


The revulsion of feeling that Barrington experienced during the
progress of the election was intensified by the final result.The
blind, stupid, enthusiastic admiration displayed by the philanthropists
for those who exploited and robbed them; their extraordinary apathy
with regard to their own interests; the patient, broken-spirited way in
which they endured their sufferings, tamely submitting to live in
poverty in the midst of the wealth they had helped to create; their
callous indifference to the fate of their children, and the savage
hatred they exhibited towards anyone who dared to suggest the
possibility of better things, forced upon him the thought that the
hopes he cherished were impossible of realization.The words of the
renegade Socialist recurred constantly to his mind:

'You can be a Jesus Christ if you like, but for my part I'm finished.For the future I intend to look after myself.As for these people,
they vote for what they want, they get what they vote for, and, by God!They are being beaten with whips of their
own choosing, and if I had my way they should be chastised with
scorpions.For them, the present system means joyless drudgery,
semi-starvation, rags and premature death; and they vote for it and
uphold it.Let them drudge and let
them starve!'These words kept ringing in his ears as he walked through the crowded
streets early one fine evening a few days before Christmas.The shops
were all brilliantly lighted for the display of their Christmas stores,
and the pavements and even the carriageways were thronged with
sightseers.Barrington was specially interested in the groups of shabbily dressed
men and women and children who gathered in the roadway in front of the
poulterers' and butchers' shops, gazing at the meat and the serried
rows of turkeys and geese decorated with  ribbons and rosettes.He knew that to come here and look at these things was the only share
many of these poor people would have of them, and he marvelled greatly
at their wonderful patience and abject resignation.But what struck him most of all was the appearance of many of the
women, evidently working men's wives.Their faded, ill-fitting
garments and the tired, sad expressions on their pale and careworn
faces.Some of them were alone; others were accompanied by little
children who trotted along trustfully clinging to their mothers' hands.The sight of these poor little ones, their utter helplessness and
dependence, their patched unsightly clothing and broken boots, and the
wistful looks on their pitiful faces as they gazed into the windows of
the toy-shops, sent a pang of actual physical pain to his heart and
filled his eyes with tears.He knew that these children--naked of joy
and all that makes life dear--were being tortured by the sight of the
things that were placed so cruelly before their eyes, but which they
were not permitted to touch or to share; and, like Joseph of old, his
heart yearned over his younger brethren.He felt like a criminal because he was warmly clad and well fed in the
midst of all this want and unhappiness, and he flushed with shame
because he had momentarily faltered in his devotion to the noblest
cause that any man could be privileged to fight for--the uplifting of
the disconsolate and the oppressed.He presently came to a large toy shop outside which several children
were standing admiring the contents of the window.He recognized some
of these children and paused to watch them and to listen to their talk.They did not notice him standing behind them as they ranged to and fro
before the window, and as he looked at them, he was reminded of the way
in which captive animals walk up and down behind the bars of their
cages.These children wandered repeatedly, backwards and forwards from
one end of the window to the other, with their little hands pressed
against the impenetrable plate glass, choosing and pointing out to each
other the particular toys that took their fancies.cried Charley Linden, enthusiastically indicating a
large strongly built waggon.'If I had that I'd give Freddie rides in
it and bring home lots of firewood, and we could play at fire engines
as well.''I'd rather have this railway,' said Frankie Owen.'There's a real
tunnel and real coal in the tenders; then there's the station and the
signals and a place to turn the engine round, and a red lantern to
light when there's danger on the line.''Mine's this doll--not the biggest one, the one in pink with clothes
that you can take off,' said Elsie; 'and this tea set; and this
needlecase for Mother.'Little Freddie had let go his hold of Elsie, to whom he usually clung
tightly and was clapping his hands and chuckling with delight and
desire.'But it's no use lookin' at them any longer,' continued Elsie, with a
sigh, as she took hold of Freddie's hand to lead him away.'It's no
use lookin' at 'em any longer; the likes of us can't expect to have
such good things as them.'This remark served to recall Frankie and Charley to the stern realities
of life, and turning reluctantly away from the window they prepared to
follow Elsie, but Freddie had not yet learnt the lesson--he had not
lived long enough to understand that the good things of the world were
not for the likes of him; so when Elsie attempted to draw him away he
pursed up his underlip and began to cry, repeating that he wanted a
gee-gee.The other children clustered round trying to coax and comfort
him by telling him that no one was allowed to have anything out of the
windows yet--until Christmas--and that Santa Claus would be sure to
bring him a gee-gee then; but these arguments failed to make any
impression on Freddie, who tearfully insisted upon being supplied at
once.Whilst they were thus occupied they caught sight of Barrington, whom
they hailed with evident pleasure born of the recollection of certain
gifts of pennies and cakes they had at different times received from
him.'Hello, Mr Barrington,' said the two boys in a breath.'Hello,' replied Barrington, as he patted the baby's cheek.'He wants that there 'orse, mister, the one with the real 'air on,'
said Charley, smiling indulgently like a grown-up person who realized
the absurdity of the demand.'Fweddie want gee-gee,' repeated the child, taking hold of Barrington's
hand and returning to the window.'Tell him that Santa Claus'll bring it to him on Christmas,' whispered
Elsie.'P'raps he'll believe you and that'll satisfy him, and he's
sure to forget all about it in a little while.''Are you still out of work, Mr Barrington?''I've got something to do at last.''Well, that's a good job, ain't it?''And whom do you think I'm working for?'echoed the children, opening their eyes to the fullest
extent.'Yes,' continued Barrington, solemnly.'You know, he is a very old man
now, so old that he can't do all his work himself.Last year he was so
tired that he wasn't able to get round to all the children he wanted to
give things to, and consequently a great many of them never got
anything at all.So this year he's given me a job to help him.He's
given me some money and a list of children's names, and against their
names are written the toys they are to have.My work is to buy the
things and give them to the boys and girls whose names are on the list.'The children listened to this narrative with bated breath.Incredible
as the story seemed, Barrington's manner was so earnest as to almost
compel belief.'Really and truly, or are you only having a game?'said Frankie at
length, speaking almost in a whisper.Elsie and Charley maintained an
awestruck silence, while Freddie beat upon the glass with the palms of
his hands.'Really and truly,' replied Barrington unblushingly as he took out his
pocket-book and turned over the leaves.'I've got the list here;
perhaps your names are down for something.'The three children turned pale and their hearts beat violently as they
listened wide-eyed for what was to follow.'Let me see,' continued Barrington, scanning the pages of the book,
'Why, yes, here they are!Elsie Linden, one doll with clothes that can
be taken off, one tea-set, one needlecase.Freddie Easton, one horse
with real hair.Charley Linden, one four-wheeled waggon full of
groceries.Frankie Owen, one railway with tunnel, station, train with
real coal for engine, signals, red lamp and place to turn the engines
round.'Barrington closed the book: 'So you may as well have your things now,'
he continued, speaking in a matter-of-fact tone.'We'll buy them here;
it will save me a lot of work.I shall not have the trouble of taking
them round to where you live.It's lucky I happened to meet you, isn't
it?'The children were breathless with emotion, but they just managed to
gasp out that it was--very lucky.As they followed him into the shop, Freddie was the only one of the
four whose condition was anything like normal.All the others were in
a half-dazed state.Frankie was afraid that he was not really awake at
all.It couldn't be true; it must be a dream.In addition to the hair, the horse was furnished with four wheels.They
did not have it made into a parcel, but tied some string to it and
handed it over to its new owner.The elder children were scarcely
conscious of what took place inside the shop; they knew that Barrington
was talking to the shopman, but they did not hear what was said--the
sound seemed far away and unreal.The shopman made the doll, the tea-set and the needlecase into one
parcel and gave it to Elsie.The railway, in a stout cardboard box,
was also wrapped up in brown paper, and Frankie's heart nearly burst
when the man put the package into his arms.When they came out of the toy shop they said 'Good night' to Frankie,
who went off carrying his parcel very carefully and feeling as if he
were walking on air.The others went into a provision merchant's near
by, where the groceries were purchased and packed into the waggon.Then Barrington, upon referring to the list to make quite certain that
he had not forgotten anything, found that Santa Claus had put down a
pair of boots each for Elsie and Charley, and when they went to buy
these, it was seen that their stockings were all ragged and full of
holes, so they went to a draper's and bought some stocking also.Barrington said that although they were not on the list, he was sure
Santa Claus would not object--he had probably meant them to have them,
but had forgotten to put them down.Chapter 54

The End


The following evening Barrington called at Owen's place.He said he
was going home for the holidays and had come to say goodbye for a time.Owen had not been doing very well during these last few months,
although he was one of the few lucky ones who had had some small share
of work.Most of the money he earned went for rent, to pay which they
often had to go short of food.Lately his chest had become so bad that
the slightest exertion brought on fits of coughing and breathlessness,
which made it almost impossible to work even when he had the
opportunity; often it was only by an almost superhuman effort of will
that he was able to continue working at all.He contrived to keep up
appearances to a certain extent before Rushton, who, although he knew
that Owen was not so strong as the other men, was inclined to overlook
it so long as he was able to do his share of work, for Owen was a very
useful hand when things were busy.But lately some of the men with
whom he worked began to manifest dissatisfaction at having him for a
mate.When two men are working together, the master expects to see two
men's work done, and if one of the two is not able to do his share it
makes it all the harder for the other.He never had the money to go to a doctor to get advice, but earlier in
the winter he had obtained from Rushton a ticket for the local
hospital.Every Saturday throughout the year when the men were paid
they were expected to put a penny or twopence in the hospital box.Contributions were obtained in this way from every firm and workshop in
the town.The masters periodically handed these boxes over to the
hospital authorities and received in return some tickets which they
gave to anyone who needed and asked for them.The employer had to fill
in the ticket or application form with the name and address of the
applicant, and to certify that in his opinion the individual was a
deserving case,'suitable to receive this charity'.In common with the
majority of workmen, Owen had a sort of horror of going for advice to
this hospital, but he was so ill that he stifled his pride and went.It happened that it turned out to be more expensive than going to a
private doctor, for he had to be at the hospital at a certain hour on a
particular morning.To do this he had to stay away from work.The
medicine they prescribed and which he had to buy did him no good, for
the truth was that it was not medicine that he--like thousands of
others--needed, but proper conditions of life and proper food; things
that had been for years past as much out of his reach as if he had been
dying alone in the middle of a desert.Occasionally Nora contrived--by going without some other necessary--to
buy him a bottle of one of the many much-advertised medicines; but
although some of these things were good she was not able to buy enough
for him to derive any benefit from them.Although he was often seized with a kind of terror of the future--of
being unable to work--he fought against these feelings and tried to
believe that when the weather became warmer he would be all right once
more.When Barrington came in Owen was sitting in a deck-chair by the fire in
the sitting-room.He had been to work that day with Harlow, washing off
the ceilings and stripping the old paper from the walls of two rooms in
Rushton's home, and he looked very haggard and exhausted.'I have never told you before,' said Barrington, after they had been
talking for a while, 'but I suppose you have guessed that I did not
work for Rushton because I needed to do so in order to live.I just
wanted to see things for myself; to see life as it is lived by the
majority.He doesn't approve of my
opinions, but at same time he does not interfere with me for holding
them, and I have a fairly liberal allowance which I spent in my own
way.I'm going to pass Christmas with my own people, but in the spring
I intend to fit out a Socialist Van, and then I shall come back here.We'll have some of the best speakers in the movement; we'll hold
meetings every night; we'll drench the town with literature, and we'll
start a branch of the party.'Owen's eye kindled and his pale face flushed.'I shall be able to do something to advertise the meetings,' he said.For instance, I could paint some posters and placards.''And I can help to give away handbills,' chimed in Frankie, looking up
from the floor, where he was seated working the railway.'I know a lot
of boys who'll come along with me to put 'em under the doors as well.'They were in the sitting-room and the door was shut.Mrs Owen was in
the next room with Ruth.While the two men were talking the front-door
bell was heard to ring and Frankie ran out to see who it was, closing
the door after him.Barrington and Owen continued their conversation,
and from time to time they could hear a low murmur of voices from the
adjoining room.After a little while they heard some one go out by the
front door, and almost immediately afterward Frankie--wild with
excitement, burst into the room, crying out:

'Dad and Mr Barrington!And he began capering
gleefully about the room, evidently transported with joy.inquired Barrington, rather mystified
by this extraordinary conduct.'Mr Easton came with Freddie to see Mrs Easton, and she's gone home
again with them,' replied Freddie, 'and--she's given the baby to us for
a Christmas box!'Barrington was already familiar with the fact of Easton's separation
from his wife, and Owen now told him the Story of their reconciliation.His train left at eight;
it was already nearly half past seven, and he said he had a letter to
write.Nora brought the baby in to show him before he went, and then
she helped Frankie to put on his overcoat, for Barrington had requested
that the boy might be permitted to go a little way with him.There was a stationer's shop at the end of the street.He went in here
and bought a sheet of notepaper and an envelope, and, having borrowed
the pen and ink, wrote a letter which he enclosed in the envelope with
the two other pieces that he took out of his pocketbook.Having
addressed the letter he came out of the shop; Frankie was waiting for
him outside.'I want you to take this straight home and give it to your dad.I
don't want you to stop to play or even to speak to anyone till you get
home.''I won't stop running all the way.''I think I have time to
go back with you as far as your front door,' he said, 'then I shall be
quite sure you haven't lost it.'They accordingly retraced their steps and in a few minutes reached the
entrance to the house.Barrington opened the door and stood for a
moment in the hall watching Frankie ascend the stairs.inquired the boy, pausing and
looking over the banisters.'Because we can see the bridge from our front-room window, and if you
were to wave your handkerchief as your train goes over the bridge, we
could wave back.'Barrington waited till he heard Frankie open and close the door of
Owen's flat, and then he hurried away.When he gained the main road he
heard the sound of singing and saw a crowd at the corner of one of the
side-streets.As he drew near he perceived that it was a religious
meeting.There was a lighted lamp on a standard in the centre of the crowd and
on the glass of this lamp was painted: 'Be not deceived: God is not
mocked.'Mr Rushton was preaching in the centre of the ring.He said that they
had come hout there that evening to tell the Glad Tidings of Great Joy
to hall those dear people that he saw standing around.The members of
the Shining Light Chapel--to which he himself belonged--was the
organizers of that meeting but it was not a sectarian meeting, for he
was 'appy to say that several members of other denominations was there
co-operating with them in the good work.As he continued his address,
Rushton repeatedly referred to the individuals who composed the crowd
as his 'Brothers and Sisters' and, strange to say, nobody laughed.Barrington looked round upon the 'Brothers': Mr Sweater, resplendent in
a new silk hat of the latest fashion, and a fur-trimmed overcoat.Mr Bosher, Vicar of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, Mr
Grinder--one of the churchwardens at the same place of alleged
worship--both dressed in broadcloth and fine linen and glossy silk
hats, while their general appearance testified to the fact that they
had fared sumptuously for many days.Mr Didlum, Mrs Starvem, Mr
Dauber, Mr Botchit, Mr Smeeriton, and Mr Leavit.John Starr, doing the work for which he
was paid.As he stood there in the forefront of this company, there was nothing
in his refined and comely exterior to indicate that his real function
was to pander to and flatter them; to invest with an air of
respectability and rectitude the abominably selfish lives of the gang
of swindlers, slave-drivers and petty tyrants who formed the majority
of the congregation of the Shining Light Chapel.He was doing the work for which he was paid.By the mere fact of his
presence there, condoning and justifying the crimes of these typical
representatives of that despicable class whose greed and inhumanity
have made the earth into a hell.There was also a number of'respectable', well-dressed people who
looked as if they could do with a good meal, and a couple of shabbily
dressed, poverty-stricken-looking individuals who seemed rather out of
place in the glittering throng.The remainder of the Brothers consisted of half-starved, pale-faced
working men and women, most of them dressed in other people's cast-off
clothing, and with broken, patched-up, leaky boots on their feet.Rushton having concluded his address, Didlum stepped forward to give
out the words of the hymn the former had quoted at the conclusion of
his remarks:


        'Oh, come and jine this 'oly band,
        And hon to glory go.'Strange and incredible as it may appear to the reader, although none of
them ever did any of the things Jesus said, the people who were
conducting this meeting had the effrontery to claim to be followers of
Christ--Christians!Jesus said: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth', 'Love not
the world nor the things of the world', 'Woe unto you that are rich--it
is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter the kingdom of heaven.'Yet all these self-styled
'Followers' of Christ made the accumulation of money the principal
business of their lives.Jesus said: 'Be ye not called masters; for they bind heavy burdens and
grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they
themselves will not touch them with one of their fingers.For one is
your master, even Christ, and ye are all brethren.'But nearly all
these alleged followers of the humble Workman of Nazareth claimed to be
other people's masters or mistresses.And as for being all brethren,
whilst most of these were arrayed in broadcloth and fine linen and
fared sumptuously every day, they knew that all around them thousands
of those they hypocritically called their 'brethren', men, women and
little children, were slowly perishing of hunger and cold; and we have
already seen how much brotherhood existed between Sweater and Rushton
and the miserable, half-starved wretches in their employment.Whenever they were asked why they did not practise the things Jesus
preached, they replied that it is impossible to do so!They did not
seem to realize that when they said this they were saying, in effect,
that Jesus taught an impracticable religion; and they appeared to
forget that Jesus said, 'Wherefore call ye me Lord, Lord, when ye do
not the things I say?...''Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and
doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house
upon the sand.'But although none of these self-styled 'Followers' of Christ, ever did
the things that Jesus said, they talked a great deal about them, and
sang hymns, and for a pretence made long prayers, and came out here to
exhort those who were still in darkness to forsake their evil ways.And
they procured this lantern and wrote a text upon it: 'Be not deceived,
God is not mocked.'They stigmatized as 'infidels' all those who differed from them,
forgetting that the only real infidels are those who are systematically
false and unfaithful to the Master they pretend to love and serve.Grinder, having a slight cold, had not spoken this evening, but several
other infidels, including Sweater, Didlum, Bosher, and Starr, had
addressed the meeting, making a special appeal to the working people,
of whom the majority of the crowd was composed, to give up all the vain
pleasures of the world in which they at present indulged, and, as
Rushton had eloquently put it at the close of his remarks:

        'Come and jine this 'Oly band and hon to glory go!'As Didlum finished reading out the words, the lady at the harmonium
struck up the tune of the hymns, and the disciples all joined in the
singing:

        'Oh, come and join this 'oly band and hon to glory go.'During the singing certain of the disciples went about amongst the
crowd distributing tracts.Presently one of them offered one to
Barrington and as the latter looked at the man he saw that it was
Slyme, who also recognized him at the same instant and greeted him by
name.Barrington made no reply except to decline the tract:

'I don't want that--from you,' he said contemptuously.'Oh, I know what you're thinking of,' he said after
a pause and speaking in an injured tone; 'but you shouldn't judge
anyone too hard.It wasn't only my fault, and you don't know 'ow much
I've suffered for it.If it 'adn't been for the Lord, I believe I
should 'ave drownded myself.'Barrington made no answer and Slyme slunk off, and when the hymn was
finished Brother Sweater stood forth and gave all those present a
hearty invitation to attend the services to be held during the ensuing
week at the Chapel of the Shining Light.He invited them there
specially, of course, because it was the place with which he was
himself connected, but he entreated and begged of them even if they
would not come there to go Somewhere; there were plenty of other places
of worship in the town; in fact, there was one at the corner of nearly
every street.Those who did not fancy the services at the Shining
Light could go to the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, but he really did
hope that all those dear people whom he saw standing round would go
Somewhere.A short prayer from Bosher closed the meeting, and now the reason for
the presence of the two poverty-stricken-looking shabbily dressed
disciples was made manifest, for while the better dressed and therefore
more respectable Brothers were shaking hands with and grinning at each
other or hovering round the two clergymen and Mr Sweater, these two
poor wretches carried away the harmonium and the lantern, together with
the hymn books and what remained of the tracts.As Barrington hurried
off to catch the train one of the 'Followers' gave him a card which he
read by the light of a street lamp--

                   Come and join the Brotherhood
                    at the Shining Light Chapel
                                PSA
                    Every Sunday at 3 o'clock.'Oh come and join this Holy Band
                        and on to Glory go.'Barrington thought he would, rather go to hell--if there were such a
place--with some decent people, than share 'glory' with a crew like
this.Nora sat sewing by the fireside in the front room, with the baby asleep
in her lap.Owen was reclining in the deck-chair opposite.They had
both been rather silent and thoughtful since Barrington's departure.It was mainly by their efforts that the reconciliation between Easton
and Ruth had been effected and they had been so desirous of
accomplishing that result that they had not given much thought to their
own position.'I feel that I could not bear to part with her for anything now,' said
Nora at last breaking the long silence, 'and Frankie is so fond of her
too.But all the same I can't feel happy about it when I think how ill
you are.''Oh, I shall be all right when the weather gets a little warmer,' said
Owen, affecting a cheerfulness he did not feel.'We have always pulled
through somehow or other; the poor little thing is not going to make
much difference, and she'll be as well off with us as she would have
been if Ruth had not gone back.'As he spoke he leaned over and touched the hand of the sleeping child
and the little fingers closed round one of his with a clutch that sent
a thrill all through him.As he looked at this little helpless,
dependent creature, he realized with a kind of thankfulness that he
would never have the heart to carry out the dreadful project he had
sometimes entertained in hours of despondency.'We've always got through somehow or other,' he repeated, 'and we'll do
so still.'Presently they heard Frankie's footsteps ascending the stairs and a
moment afterwards the boy entered the room.'We have to look out of the window and wave to Mr Barrington when his
train goes over the bridge,' he cried breathlessly.Open the window, quick, Dad, or it may be too late.''There's plenty of time yet,' replied Owen, smiling at the boy's
impetuosity.We don't want the window open
all that time.It's only a quarter to eight by our clock now, and
that's five minutes fast.'However, so as to make quite certain that the train should not run past
unnoticed, Frankie pulled up the blind and, rubbing the steam off the
glass, took up his station at the window to watch for its coming, while
Owen opened the letter:

'Dear Owen,

'Enclosed you will find two bank-notes, one for ten pounds and the
other for five.The first I beg you will accept from me for yourself
in the same spirit that I offer it, and as I would accept it from you
if our positions were reversed.If I were in need, I know that you
would willingly share with me whatever you had and I could not hurt you
by refusing.The other note I want you to change tomorrow morning.Give three pounds of it to Mrs Linden and the remainder to Bert White's
mother.'Wishing you all a happy Xmas and hoping to find you well and eager for
the fray when I come back in the spring,

                             'Yours for the cause,

                                                  'George Barrington.'Owen read it over two or three times before he could properly
understand it and then, without a word of comment--for he could not
have spoken at that moment to save his life--he passed it to Nora, who
felt, as she read it in her turn, as if a great burden had been lifted
from her heart.All the undefined terror of the future faded away as
she thought of all this small piece of paper made possible.Meanwhile, Frankie, at the window, was straining his eyes in the
direction of the station.'Don't you think we'd better have the window open now, Dad?'he said at
last as the clock struck eight.'The steam keeps coming on the glass
as fast as I wipe it off and I can't see out properly.I'm sure it's
nearly time now; p'raps our clock isn't as fast as you think it is.''All right, we'll have it open now, so as to be on the safe side,' said
Owen as he stood up and raised the sash, and Nora, having wrapped the
child up in a shawl, joined them at the window.'It can't be much longer now, you know,' said Frankie.They turned the red light off the signal just before you opened
the window.'In a very few minutes they heard the whistle of the locomotive as it
drew out of the station, then, an instant before the engine itself came
into sight round the bend, the brightly polished rails were
illuminated, shining like burnished gold in the glare of its headlight;
a few seconds afterwards the train emerged into view, gathering speed
as it came along the short stretch of straight way, and a moment later
it thundered across the bridge.It was too far away to recognize his
face, but they saw someone looking out of a carriage window waving a
handkerchief, and they knew it was Barrington as they waved theirs in
return.Soon there remained nothing visible of the train except the
lights at the rear of the guard's van, and presently even those
vanished into the surrounding darkness.The lofty window at which they were standing overlooked several of the
adjacent streets and a great part of the town.On the other side of the
road were several empty houses, bristling with different house agents'
advertisement boards and bills.About twenty yards away, the shop
formerly tenanted by Mr Smallman, the grocer, who had become bankrupt
two or three months previously, was also plastered with similar
decorations.A little further on, at the opposite corner, were the
premises of the Monopole Provision Stores, where brilliant lights were
just being extinguished, for they, like most of the other shops, were
closing their premises for the night, and the streets took on a more
cheerless air as one after another their lights disappeared.It had been a fine day, and during the earlier part of the evening the
moon, nearly at the full, had been shining in a clear and starry sky;
but a strong north-east wind had sprung up within the last hour; the
weather had become bitterly cold and the stars were rapidly being
concealed from view by the dense banks of clouds that were slowly
accumulating overhead.As they remained at the window looking out over this scene for a few
minutes after the train had passed out of sight, it seemed to Owen that
the gathering darkness was as a curtain that concealed from view the
Infamy existing beyond.In every country, myriads of armed men waiting
for their masters to give them the signal to fall upon and rend each
other like wild beasts.All around was a state of dreadful anarchy;
abundant riches, luxury, vice, hypocrisy, poverty, starvation, and
crime.Men literally fighting with each other for the privilege of
working for their bread, and little children crying with hunger and
cold and slowly perishing of want.The gloomy shadows enshrouding the streets, concealing for the time
their grey and mournful air of poverty and hidden suffering, and the
black masses of cloud gathering so menacingly in the tempestuous sky,
seemed typical of the Nemesis which was overtaking the Capitalist
System.That atrocious system which, having attained to the fullest
measure of detestable injustice and cruelty, was now fast crumbling
into ruin, inevitably doomed to be overwhelmed because it was all so
wicked and abominable, inevitably doomed to sink under the blight and
curse of senseless and unprofitable selfishness out of existence for
ever, its memory universally execrated and abhorred.But from these ruins was surely growing the glorious fabric of the
Co-operative Commonwealth.Mankind, awaking from the long night of
bondage and mourning and arising from the dust wherein they had lain
prone so long, were at last looking upward to the light that was riving
asunder and dissolving the dark clouds which had so long concealed from
them the face of heaven.The light that will shine upon the world wide
Fatherland and illumine the gilded domes and glittering pinnacles of
the beautiful cities of the future, where men shall dwell together in
true brotherhood and goodwill and joy.The Golden Light that will be
diffused throughout all the happy world from the rays of the risen sun
of Socialism.Appendix

Mugsborough


Mugsborough was a town of about eighty thousand inhabitants, about two
hundred miles from London.It was built in a verdant valley.Looking
west, north or east from the vicinity of the fountain on the Grand
Parade in the centre of the town, one saw a succession of pine-clad
hills.To the south, as far as the eye could see, stretched a vast,
cultivated plain that extended to the south coast, one hundred miles
away.The climate was supposed to be cool in summer and mild in winter.The town proper nestled in the valley: to the west, the most beautiful
and sheltered part was the suburb of Irene: here were the homes of the
wealthy residents and prosperous tradespeople, and numerous
boarding-houses for the accommodation of well-to-do visitors.East,
the town extended up the <DW72> to the top of the hill and down the
other side to the suburb of Windley, where the majority of the working
classes lived.Years ago, when the facilities for foreign travel were fewer and more
costly, Mugsborough was a favourite resort of the upper classes, but of
late years most of these patriots have adopted the practice of going on
the Continent to spend the money they obtain from the working people of
England.However, Mugsborough still retained some semblance of
prosperity.Summer or winter the place was usually fairly full of what
were called good-class visitors, either holidaymakers or invalids.The
Grand Parade was generally crowded with well-dressed people and
carriages.The shops appeared to be well-patronized and at the time of
our story an air of prosperity pervaded the town.But this fair
outward appearance was deceitful.The town was really a vast whited
sepulchre; for notwithstanding the natural advantages of the place the
majority of the inhabitants existed in a state of perpetual poverty
which in many cases bordered on destitution.One of the reasons for
this was that a great part of the incomes of the tradespeople and
boarding-house-keepers and about a third of the wages of the working
classes were paid away as rent and rates.For years the Corporation had been borrowing money for necessary public
works and improvements, and as the indebtedness of the town increased
the rates rose in proportion, because the only works and services
undertaken by the Council were such as did not yield revenue.Every
public service capable of returning direct profit was in the hands of
private companies, and the shares of the private companies were in the
hands of the members of the Corporation, and the members of the
Corporation were in the hands of the four most able and intellectual of
their number, Councillors Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, each of
whom was a director of one or more of the numerous companies which
battened on the town.The Tramway Company, the Water Works Company, the Public Baths Company,
the Winter Gardens Company, the Grand Hotel Company and numerous
others.There was, however, one Company in which Sweater, Rushton,
Didlum and Grinder had no shares, and that was the Gas Company, the
oldest and most flourishing of them all.This institution had grown
with the place; most of the original promoters were dead, and the
greater number of the present shareholders were non-residents; although
they lived on the town, they did not live in it.The profits made by this Company were so great that, being prevented by
law from paying a larger dividend than ten percent, they frequently
found it a difficult matter to decide what to do with the money.They
paid the Directors and principal officials--themselves shareholders, of
course--enormous salaries.They built and furnished costly and
luxurious offices and gave the rest to the shareholders in the form of
Bonuses.There was one way in which the Company might have used some of the
profits: it might have granted shorter hours and higher wages to the
workmen whose health was destroyed and whose lives were shortened by
the terrible labour of the retort-houses and the limesheds; but of
course none of the directors or shareholders ever thought of doing
that.It was not the business of the Company to concern itself about
them.Years ago, when it might have been done for a comparatively small
amount, some hare-brained Socialists suggested that the town should buy
the Gas Works, but the project was wrecked by the inhabitants, upon
whom the mere mention of the word Socialist had the same effect that
the sight of a red rag is popularly supposed to have on a bull.Of course, even now it was still possible to buy out the Company, but
it was supposed that it would cost so much that it was generally
considered to be impracticable.Although they declined to buy the Gas works, the people of Mugsborough
had to buy the gas.The amount paid by the municipality to the Company
for the public lighting of the town loomed large in the accounts of the
Council.Some 60 of the soldiers, besides
  a number of train hands were killed on the spot, and 120 more were
  seriously injured, some of them fatally.This disaster occurred in the midst of some of the most important
  operations of the Rebellion and excited at the time hardly any
  notice.There was a suggestive military promptness in the subsequent
  proceedings."T. J. Ridgeway, Esq., Associate Judge of Pike County,
  was soon on the spot, and, after consultation with Mr.Riddle [the
  superintendent of the Erie road] and the officer in command of the
  men, a jury was impanneled and an inquest held; after which a large
  trench was dug by the soldiers and the railway employés, 76 feet
  long, 8 feet wide and 6 feet deep, in which the bodies were at once
  interred in boxes, hastily constructed--one being allotted to four
  rebels, and one to each Union soldier."There were sixteen of the
  latter killed.Of this disaster nothing could be said either in excuse or in
extenuation; it was not only one of the worst description, but
it was one of that description the occurrence of which is most
frequent.An excursion train, while running against time on a
single-track road, came in collision with a regular train.The
record is full of similar disasters, too numerous to admit of
specific reference.Primarily of course, the conductors of the
special trains are as a rule in fault in such cases.He certainly
was at Camphill, and felt himself to be so, for the next day he
committed suicide by swallowing arsenic.But in reality in these
and in all similar cases,--both those which have happened and those
hereafter surely destined to happen,--the full responsibility
does not rest upon the unfortunate or careless subordinate;--nor
should the weight of punishment be visited upon him.At this late day no board of directors, nor president,
nor superintendent has any right to operate a single track road
without the systematic use of the telegraph in connection with its
train movements.That the telegraph can be used to block, as it is
termed, double-track roads, by dividing them into sections upon no
one of which two trains can be running at the same time, is matter
of long and daily experience.There is nothing new or experimental
about it.It is a system which has been forced on the more crowded
lines of the world as an alternative to perennial killings.That
in the year 1879 excursion trains should rush along single-track
roads and hurl themselves against regular trains, just as was done
twenty-three years ago at Camphill, would be deemed incredible were
not exactly similar accidents still from time to time reported.Louis, for instance, on July 4, 1879.The
simple fact is that to now operate single-track roads without the
constant aid of the telegraph, as a means of blocking them for every
irregular train, indicates a degree of wanton carelessness, or an
excess of incompetence, for which adequate provision should be made
in the criminal law.Nothing but this appeal to the whipping-post,
as it were, seems to produce the needed mental activity; for it is
difficult to realize the stupid conservatism of ordinary men when
brought to the consideration of something to which they are not
accustomed.On this very point of controlling the train movement
of single-track roads by telegraph, for instance, within a very
recent period the superintendent of a leading Massachusetts road
gravely assured the railroad commissioners of that state, that he
considered it a most dangerous reliance which had occasioned many
disasters, and that he had no doubt it would be speedily abandoned
as a practice in favor of the old time-table and running-rules
system, from which no deviations would be allowed.This opinion
was expressed, also, after the Revere disaster of 1871, it might
have been supposed, had branded into the record of the state the
impossibility of safely running any crowded railroad in a reliance
upon the schedule.[6] Such men as this, however, are not accessible
to argument or the teachings of experience, and the gentle stimulant
of a criminal prosecution seems to be the only thing left.TELEGRAPHIC COLLISIONS.And yet, even with the wires in active use, collisions will
occasionally take place.They have sometimes, indeed, even been
caused by the telegraph, so that railroad officials at two adjacent
stations on the same road, having launched trains at each other
beyond recall, have busied themselves while waiting for tidings of
the inevitable collision in summoning medical assistance for those
sure soon to be injured.In such cases, however, the mishap can
almost invariably be traced to some defect in the system under which
the telegraph is used;--such as a neglect to exact return messages
to insure accuracy, or the delegating to inexperienced subordinates
the work which can be properly performed only by a principal.This
was singularly illustrated in a terrible collision which took place
at Thorpe, between Norwich and Great Yarmouth, on the Great Eastern
Railway in England, on the 10th of September, 1874.The line had
in this place but a single track, and the mail train to Norwich,
under the rule, had to wait at a station called Brundell until the
arrival there of the evening express from Yarmouth, or until it
received permission by the telegraph to proceed.On the evening of
the disaster the express train was somewhat behind its time, and
the inspector wrote a dispatch directing the mail to come forward
without waiting for it.This dispatch he left in the telegraph
office unsigned, while he went to attend to other matters.Just then
the express train came along, and he at once allowed it to proceed.Hardly was it under way when the unsigned dispatch occurred to him,
and the unfortunate man dashed to the telegraph office only to learn
that the operator had forwarded it.Under the rules of the company
no return message was required.A second dispatch was instantly sent
to Brundell to stop the mail; the reply came back that the mail was
gone.The two trains were of very equal weight, the one consisting of
fourteen and the other of thirteen carriages.They were both drawn
by powerful locomotives, the drivers of which had reason for putting
on an increased speed, believing, as each had cause to believe, that
the other was waiting for him.The night was intensely dark and
it was raining heavily, so that, even if the brakes were applied,
the wheels would slide along the slippery track.Under these
circumstances the two trains rushed upon each other around a slight
curve which sufficed to conceal their head-lights.The combined
momentum must have amounted to little less than sixty miles an
hour, and the shock was heard through all the neighboring village.The smoke-stack of the locomotive drawing the mail train was swept
away as the other locomotive seemed to rush on top of it, while
the carriages of both trains followed until a mound of locomotives
and shattered cars was formed which the descending torrents alone
hindered from becoming a funeral pyre.So sudden was the collision
that the driver of one of the engines did not apparently have an
opportunity to shut off the steam, and his locomotive, though forced
from the track and disabled, yet remained some time in operation in
the midst of the wreck.In both trains, very fortunately, there were
a number of empty cars between the locomotives and the carriages in
which the passengers were seated, and they were utterly demolished;
but for this fortunate circumstance the Thorpe collision might well
have proved the most disastrous of all railroad accidents.As it
was, the men on both the locomotives were instantly killed, together
with seventeen passengers, and four other passengers subsequently
died of their injuries; making a total of twenty-five deaths,
besides fifty cases of injury.It would be difficult to conceive of a more violent collision
than that which has just been described; and yet, as curiously
illustrating the rapidity with which the force of the most severe
shock is expended, it is said that two gentlemen in the last
carriage of one of the trains, finding it at a sudden standstill
close to the place to which they were going, supposed it had stopped
for some unimportant cause and concluded to take advantage of a
happy chance which left them almost at the doors of their homes.They accordingly got out and hurried away in the rain, learning
only the next morning of the catastrophe in which they had been
unconscious participants.The collision at Thorpe occurred in September, 1874.Seven months
later, on the 4th of April, 1875, there was an accident similar
to it in almost every respect, except fatality, on the Burlington
& Missouri road in Iowa.In this case the operator at Tyrone had
telegraphic orders to hold the east-bound passenger express at that
point to meet the west-bound passenger express.This order he failed
to deliver, and the train accordingly at once went on to the usual
passing place at the next station.It was midnight and intensely
dark, with a heavy mist in the air which at times thickened to rain.Both of the trains approaching each other were made up in the way
usual with through night trains on the great western lines, and
consisted of locomotives, baggage and smoking cars, behind which
were the ordinary passenger cars of the company followed by several
heavy Pullman sleeping coaches.Those in charge of the east-bound
train, knowing that it was behind time, were running it rapidly,
so as to delay as little as possible the west-bound train, which,
having received the order to pass at Tyrone was itself being run at
speed.Both trains were thus moving at some thirty-five miles an
hour, when suddenly in rounding a sharp curve they came upon each
other.Indeed so close were they that the west-bound engineer had no
time in which to reverse, but, jumping straight from the gangway,
he afterwards declared that the locomotives came together before he
reached the ground.The engineer of the east-bound train succeeded
both in reversing his locomotive and in applying his airbrake, but
after reversal the throttle flew open.The trains came together,
therefore, as at Thorpe, with their momentum practically unchecked,
and with such force that the locomotives were completely demolished,
the boilers of the two, though on the same line of rails, actually,
in some way, passing each other.The baggage-cars were also
destroyed, and the smoking cars immediately behind them were more
or less damaged, but the remaining coaches of each train stood
upon the tracks so wholly uninjured that four hours later, other
locomotives having been procured but the track being still blocked,
the passengers were transferred from one set of cars to the other,
and in them were carried to their destinations.So admirably did
Miller's construction serve its purpose in this case, that, while
the superintendent of the road, who happened to be in the rear
sleeping car of one of the trains, merely reported that he "felt the
shock quite sensibly," passengers in the rear coaches of the other
train hardly felt it at all.At Tyrone the wrecks of the trains caught fire from the stoves
thrown out of the baggage cars and from the embers from the
fire-boxes of the locomotives, but the flames were speedily
extinguished.Of the train hands three were killed and two injured,
but no passenger was more than shaken or slightly bruised.This
was solely due to strength of car construction.Heavy as the shock
was,--so heavy that in the similar case at Thorpe the carriages were
crushed like nut-shells under it,--the resisting power was equal to
it.The failure of appliances at one point in the operation of the
road was made good by their perfection at another.Similar in some of its more dramatic features to the Versailles
accident, though originating from a wholly different cause, was the
Abergele disaster, which at the time occupied the attention of the
British public to the exclusion of everything else.It occurred
in 1868, and to the "Irish mail," perhaps the most famous train
which is run in England, if, indeed, not in the world.Leaving
London shortly after 7 A.M., the Irish mail was then timed to make
the distance to Chester, 166 miles, in four hours and eighteen
minutes, or at the rate of 40 miles an hour.For the next 85 miles,
completing the run to Holyhead, the speed was somewhat increased,
two hours and five minutes only being allowed for it.Abergele is a
point on the sea-coast of Wales, nearly midway between Chester and
Holyhead.On the day of the accident, August 20, 1868, the Irish
mail left Chester as usual.It was made up of thirteen carriages
in all, which were occupied, as the carriages of that train usually
were, by a large number of persons whose names at least were widely
known.Among these, on this particular occasion, was the Duchess of
Abercorn, wife of the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, with five
children.Under the running arrangements of the London & North
Western road a freight, or as it is there called a goods train, left
Chester half an hour before the mail, and was placed upon the siding
at Llanddulas, a station about a mile and a half beyond Abergele,
to allow the mail to pass.From Abergele to Llanddulas the track
ascended by a gradient of some sixty feet to the mile.On the day of
the accident it chanced that certain wagons between the engine and
the rear end of the goods train had to be taken out to be left at
Llanddulas, and in doing this it became necessary to separate the
train and to leave five or six of the last wagons in it standing on
the tracks of the main line, while those which were to be left were
backed onto a siding.The employé, whose duty it was, neglected to
set the brakes on the wagons thus left standing, and consequently
when the engine and the rest of the train returned for them, the
moment they were touched and before a coupling could be effected,
the jar set them in motion down the incline towards Abergele.They
started so slowly that a brakeman of the train ran after them,
fully expecting to catch and stop them, but as they went down the
grade they soon outstripped him and it became clear that there was
nothing to check them until they should meet the Irish mail, then
almost due.It also chanced that the cars thus set in motion were
oil cars.The track of the North Western road between Abergele and Llanddulas
runs along the sides of the picturesque Welsh hills, which rise
up to the south, while to the north there stretches out a wide
expanse of sea.The mail train was skirting the hills and laboring
up the grade at a speed of thirty miles an hour, when its engineer
suddenly became aware of the loose wagons coming down upon it around
the curve, and then but a few yards off.Seeing that they were oil
cars he almost instinctively sprang from his locomotive, and was
thrown down by the impetus and rolled to the side of the road-bed.Picking himself up, bruised but not seriously hurt, he saw that
the collision had already taken place, that the tender had ridden
directly over the engine, that the colliding cars were demolished,
and that the foremost carriages of the train were already on fire.Running quickly to the rear of the train he succeeded in uncoupling
six carriages and a van, which were drawn away from the rest, before
the flames extended to them, by an engine which most fortunately was
following the train.All the other carriages were utterly destroyed,
and every person in them perished.The Abergele was probably the solitary instance of a railroad
accident in which but a single survivor sustained any injury.The collision was
not a particularly severe one, and the engineer of the mail train
especially stated that at the moment it occurred the loose cars were
still moving so slowly that he would not have sprung from his engine
had he not seen that they were loaded with oil.The very instant
the collision took place, however, the fluid seemed to ignite and
to flash along the train like lightning, so that it was impossible
to approach a carriage when once it caught fire.The fact was that
the oil in vast quantities was spilled upon the track and ignited by
the fire of the locomotive, and then the impetus of the mail train
forced all of its leading carriages into the dense mass of smoke and
flame.All those who were present concurred in positively stating
that not a cry, nor a moan, nor a sound of any description was heard
from the burning carriages, nor did any one in them apparently make
an effort to escape.The most graphic description of this extraordinary and terrible
catastrophe was that given by the Marquis of Hamilton, the eldest
son of the Duke of Abercorn whose wife and family, fortunately
for themselves, occupied one of those rear carriages which were
unshackled and saved.In this account the Marquis of Hamilton
said:--"We were startled by a collision and a shock which, though
not very severe, were sufficient to throw every one against his
opposite neighbor.I immediately jumped out of the carriage,
when a fearful sight met my view.Already the whole of the three
passengers' carriages in front of ours, the vans, and the engine
were enveloped in dense sheets of flame and smoke, rising fully
twenty feet high, and spreading out in every direction.No words can convey the instantaneous nature
of the explosion and conflagration.I had actually got out almost
before the shock of the collision was over, and this was the
spectacle which already presented itself.Not a sound, not a scream,
not a struggle to escape, not a movement of any sort was apparent
in the doomed carriages.It was as though an electric flash had
at once paralyzed and stricken every one of their occupants.So
complete was the absence of any presence of living or struggling
life in them that as soon as the passengers from the other parts
of the train were in some degree recovered from their first shock
and consternation, it was imagined that the burning carriages were
destitute of passengers; a hope soon changed into feelings of horror
when their contents of charred and mutilated remains were discovered
an hour afterward.From the extent, however, of the flames, the
suddenness of the conflagration, and the absence of any power to
extricate themselves, no human aid would have been of any assistance
to the sufferers, who, in all probability, were instantaneously
suffocated by the black and fetid smoke peculiar to paraffine, which
rose in volumes around the spreading flames."Though the collision took place before one o'clock, in spite
of the efforts of a large gang of men who were kept throwing
water on the tracks, the perfect sea of flame which covered the
line for a distance of some forty or fifty yards could not be
extinguished until nearly eight o'clock in the evening; for the
petroleum had flowed down into the ballasting of the road, and the
rails themselves were red-hot.It was therefore small occasion
for surprise that, when the fire was at last gotten under, the
remains of those who lost their lives were in some cases wholly
undistinguishable, and in others almost so.Among the thirty-three
victims of the disaster the body of no single one retained any
traces of individuality; the faces of all were wholly destroyed,
and in no case were there found feet, or legs, or anything at all
approaching to a perfect head.Ten corpses were finally identified
as those of males, and thirteen as those of females, while the sex
of ten others could not be determined.The body of one passenger,
Lord Farnham, was identified by the crest on his watch; and, indeed,
no better evidence of the wealth and social position of the victims
of this accident could have been asked for than the collection of
articles found on its site.It included diamonds of great size
and singular brilliancy; rubies, opals, emeralds, gold tops of
smelling-bottles, twenty-four watches, of which but two or three
were not gold, chains, clasps of bags, and very many bundles of
keys.Of these the diamonds alone had successfully resisted the
intense heat of the flame; the settings were nearly all destroyed.Of the causes of this accident little need or can be said.No human
appliances, no more ingenious brakes or increased strength of
construction, could have averted it or warded off its consequences
once it was inevitable.It was occasioned primarily by two things,
the most dangerous and the most difficult to reach of all the
many sources of danger against which those managing railroads
have unsleepingly to contend:--a somewhat defective discipline,
aggravated by a little not unnatural carelessness.The rule of
the company was specific that all the wagons of every goods train
should be out of the way and the track clear at least ten minutes
before a passenger train was due; but in this case shunting was
going actively on when the Irish-mail was within a mile and a half.A careless brakeman then forgot for once that he was leaving his
wagons close to the head of an incline; a blow in coupling, a little
heavier perhaps than usual, sufficed to set them in motion; and they
happened to be loaded with oil.A catastrophe strikingly similar to that at Abergele befell an
express train on the Hudson River railroad, upon the night of the
6th of February, 1871.The weather for a number of days preceding
the accident had been unusually cold, and it is to the suffering
of employés incident to exposure, and the consequent neglect of
precautions on their part, that accidents are peculiarly due.On
this night a freight train was going south, all those in charge of
which were sheltering themselves during a steady run in the caboose
car at its rear end.Suddenly, when near a bridge over Wappinger's
Creek, not far from New Hamburg, they discovered that a car in the
centre of the train was off the track.The train was finally stopped
on the bridge, but in stopping it other cars were also derailed,
and one of these, bearing on it two large oil tanks, finally rested
obliquely across the bridge with one end projecting over the up
track.Hardly had the disabled train been brought to a stand-still,
when, before signal lanterns could in the confusion incident to the
disaster be sent out, the Pacific express from New York, which was
a little behind its time, came rapidly along.As it approached the
bridge, its engineer saw a red lantern swung, and instantly gave the
signal to apply the brakes.It was too late to avoid the collision;
but what ensued had in it, so far as the engineer was concerned,
an element of the heroic, which his companion, the fireman of the
engine, afterwards described on the witness stand with a directness
and simplicity of language which exceeded all art.The engineer's
name was Simmons, and he was familiarly known among his companions
as "Doc."His fireman, Nicholas Tallon, also saw the red light swung
on the bridge, and called out to him that the draw was open.In
reply Simmons told him to spring the patent brake, which he did,
and by this time they were alongside of the locomotive of the
disabled train and running with a somewhat slackened speed.Tallon
had now got out upon the step of the locomotive, preparatory to
springing off, and turning asked his companion if he also proposed
to do the same:--"'Doc' looked around at me but made no reply, and
then looked ahead again, watching his business; then I jumped and
rolled down on the ice in the creek; the next I knew I heard the
crash and saw the fire and smoke."The next seen of "Doc" Simmons,
he was dragged up days afterwards from under his locomotive at the
bottom of the river.He went out
of the world and of the sight of men with his hand on the lever,
making no reply to the suggestion that he should leave his post, but
"looking ahead and watching his business."Dante himself could not have imagined a greater complication of
horrors than then ensued: liquid fire and solid frost combined to
make the work of destruction perfect.The shock of the collision
broke in pieces the oil car, igniting its contents and flinging them
about in every direction.In an instant bridge, river, locomotive,
cars, and the glittering surface of the ice were wrapped in a sheet
of flame.At the same time the strain proved too severe for the
trestlework, which gave way, precipitating the locomotive, tender,
baggage cars, and one passenger car onto the ice, through which they
instantly crushed and sank deep out of sight beneath the water.Of the remaining seven cars of the passenger train, two, besides
several of the freight train, were destroyed by fire, and shortly,
as the supports of the remaining portions of the bridge burned away,
the superstructure fell on the half-submerged cars in the water and
buried them from view.Twenty-one persons lost their lives in this disaster, and a large
number of others were injured; but the loss of life, it will be
noticed, was only two-thirds of that at Abergele.The New Hamburg
catastrophe also differed from that at Abergele in that, under
its particular circumstances, it was far more preventable, and,
indeed, with the appliances since brought into use it would surely
be avoided.The modern train-brake had, however, not then been
perfected, so that even the hundred rods at which the signal was
seen did not afford a sufficient space in which to stop the train.DRAW-BRIDGE DISASTERS.It is difficult to see how on double track roads, where the
occurrence of an accident on one line of tracks is always liable to
instantly "foul" the other line, it is possible to guard against
contingencies like that which occurred at New Hamburg.At the time,
as is usual in such cases, the public indignation expended itself
in vague denunciation of the Hudson River Railroad Company, because
the disaster happened to take place upon a bridge in which there was
a draw to permit the passage of vessels.There seemed to be a vague
but very general impression that draw-bridges were dangerous things,
and, because other accidents due to different causes had happened
upon them, that the occurrence of this accident, from whatever
cause, was in itself sufficient evidence of gross carelessness.The
fact was that not even the clumsy Connecticut rule, which compels
the stopping of all trains before entering on any draw-bridge,
would have sufficed to avert the New Hamburg disaster, for the
river was then frozen and the draw was not in use, so that for the
time being the bridge was an ordinary bridge; and not even in the
frenzy of crude suggestions which invariably succeeds each new
accident was any one ever found ignorant enough to suggest the
stopping of all trains before entering upon every bridge, which, as
railroads generally follow water-courses, would not infrequently
necessitate an average of one stop to every thousand feet or so.Only incidentally did the bridge at New Hamburg have anything to
do with the disaster there, the essence of which lay in the sudden
derailment of an oil car immediately in front of a passenger train
running in the opposite direction and on the other track.Of course,
if the derailment had occurred long enough before the passenger
train came up to allow the proper signals to be given, and this
precaution had been neglected, then the disaster would have been
due, not to the original cause, but to the defective discipline
of the employés.Such does not appear to have been the case at
New Hamburg, nor was that disaster by any means the first due to
derailment and the throwing of cars from one track in front of a
train passing upon the other;--nor will it be the last.Indeed, an
accident hardly less destructive, arising from that very cause, had
occurred only eight months previous in England, and resulted in
eighteen deaths and more than fifty cases of injury.A goods train made up of a locomotive and twenty-nine wagons was
running at a speed of some twenty miles an hour on the Great
Northern road, between Newark and Claypole, about one hundred miles
from London, when the forward axle under one of the wagons broke.As
a result of the derailment which ensued the train became divided,
and presently the disabled car was driven by the pressure behind it
out of its course and over the interval, so that it finally rested
partly across the other track.At just this moment an excursion
train from London, made up of twenty-three carriages and containing
some three hundred and forty passengers, came along at a speed of
about thirty-five miles an hour.It was quite dark, and the engineer
of the freight train waved his arm as a signal of danger; one of
the guards, also, showed a red light with his hand lantern, but his
action either was not seen or was misunderstood, for without any
reduction of speed being made the engine of the excursion train
plunged headlong into the disabled goods wagon.The collision was
so violent as to turn the engine aside off the track and cause it
to strike the stone pier of a bridge near by, by which it was flung
completely around and then driven up the <DW72> of the cutting, where
it toppled over like a rearing horse and fell back into the roadway.The tender likewise was overturned; but not so the carriages.They
rushed along holding to the track, and the side of each as it passed
was ripped and torn by the projecting end of the goods wagon.Of the twenty-three carriages and vans in the train scarcely one
escaped damage, while the more forward ones were in several cases
lifted one on top of the other or forced partly up the <DW72> of
the cutting, whence they fell back again, crushing the passengers
beneath them.This accident occurred on the 21st of June, 1870; it was very
thoroughly investigated by Captain Tyler on behalf of the Board of
Trade, with the apparent conclusion that it was one which could
hardly have been guarded against.The freight cars, the broken
axle of which occasioned the disaster, did not belong to the Great
Northern company, and the wheels of the train had been properly
examined by viewing and tapping at the several stopping-places; the
flaw which led to the fracture was, however, of such a nature that
it could have been detected only by the removal of the wheel.It did
not appear that the employés of the company had been guilty of any
negligence; and it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that the
accident was due to one of those defects to which the results of
even the most perfect human workmanship must ever remain liable, and
this had revealed itself under exactly those conditions which must
involve the most disastrous consequences.The English accident did, however, establish one thing, if nothing
else; it showed the immeasurable superiority of the system of
investigation pursued in the case of railroad accidents in England
over that pursued in this country.There a trained expert after
the occurrence of each disaster visits the spot and sifts the
affair to the very bottom, locating responsibility and pointing out
distinctly the measures necessary to guard against its repetition.Here the case ordinarily goes to a coroner's jury, the findings of
which as a rule admirably sustain the ancient reputation of that
august tribunal.It is absolutely sad to follow the course of these
investigations, they are conducted with such an entire disregard of
method and lead to such inadequate conclusions.Indeed, how could it
be otherwise?--The same man never investigates two accidents, and,
for the one investigation he does make, he is competent only in his
own esteem.Take the New Hamburgh accident as an example.Rarely has any
catastrophe merited a more careful investigation, and few
indeed have ever called forth more ill-considered criticism or
crude suggestions.Almost nothing of interest respecting it was
elicited at the inquest, and now no reliable criticism can be
ventured upon it.The question of responsibility in that case,
and of prevention thereafter, involved careful inquiry into at
least four subjects:--First, the ownership and condition of the
freight car, the fractured axle of which occasioned the disaster,
together with the precautions taken by the company, usually and in
this particular case, to test the wheels of freight cars moving
over its road, especially during times of severe cold.--Second,
the conduct of those in charge of the freight train immediately
preceding and at the time of the accident; was the fracture of the
axle at once noticed and were measures taken to stop the train, or
was the derailment aggravated by neglect into the form it finally
took?--Third, was there any neglect in signaling the accident on
the part of those in charge of the disabled train, and how much
time elapsed between the accident and the collision?--Fourth, what,
if any, improved appliances would have enabled those in charge
of either train to have averted the accident?--and what, if any,
defects either in the rules or the equipment in use were revealed?No satisfactory conclusion can now be arrived at upon any of these
points, though the probabilities are that with the appliances since
introduced the train might have been stopped in time.In this case,
as in that at Claybridge, the coroner's jury returned a verdict
exonerating every one concerned from responsibility, and very
possibly they were justified in so doing; though it is extremely
questionable whether Captain Tyler would have arrived at a similar
conclusion.There is a strong probability that the investigation
went off, so to speak, on a wholly false issue,--turned on the
draw-bridge frenzy instead of upon the question of care.So far
as the verdict declared that the disaster was due to a collision
between a passenger train and a derailed oil car, and not to the
existence of a draw in the bridge on which it happened to occur, it
was, indeed, entitled to respect, and yet it was on this very point
that it excited the most criticism.Loud commendation was heard
through the press of the Connecticut law, which had been in force
for twenty years, and, indeed, still is in force there, under which
all trains are compelled to come to a full stop before entering
on any bridge which has a draw in it,--a law which may best be
described as a useless nuisance.Yet the grand jury of the Court of
Oyer and Terminer of New York city even went so far as to recommend,
in a report made by it on the 23d of February, 1871,--sixteen days
after the accident,--the passage by the legislature then in session
at Albany of a similar legal absurdity.Fortunately better counsels
prevailed, and, as the public recovered its equilibrium, the matter
was allowed to drop.The Connecticut law in question, however, originated in an accident
which at the time had startled and shocked the community as much
even as that at Versailles did before or that at Abergele has since
done.It occurred to an express train on the New York & New Haven
road at Norwalk, in Connecticut, on the 6th of May, 1853.CHAPTER X.

THE NORWALK ACCIDENT.The railroad at Norwalk crosses a small inlet of Long Island Sound
by means of a draw-bridge, which is approached from the direction
of New York around a sharp curve.A ball at the mast-head was in
1853 the signal that the draw was open and the bridge closed to
the passage of trains.The express passenger train for Boston,
consisting of a locomotive and two baggage and five passenger cars,
containing about one hundred and fifty persons, left New York as
usual at eight o'clock that morning.The locomotive was not in
charge of its usual engine-driver but of a substitute named Tucker;
a man who some seven years before had been injured in a previous
collision on the same road, for which he did not appear to have
been in any way responsible, but who had then given up his position
and gone to California, whence he had recently returned and was now
again an applicant for an engineer's situation.This was his third
trip over the road, as substitute.In approaching the bridge at
Norwalk he apparently wholly neglected to look for the draw-signal.He was running his train at about the usual rate of speed, and
first became aware that the draw was open when within four hundred
feet of it and after it had become wholly impossible to stop the
train in time.He immediately whistled for brakes and reversed his
engine, and then, without setting the brake on his tender, both he
and the fireman sprang off and escaped with trifling injuries.The
train at this time did not appear to be moving at a speed of over
fifteen miles an hour.The draw was sixty feet in width; the water
in the then state of the tide was about twelve feet deep, and the
same distance below the level of the bridge.Although the speed
of the train had been materially reduced, yet when it came to the
opening it was still moving with sufficient impetus to send its
locomotive clean across the sixty foot interval and to cause it to
strike the opposite abutment about eight feet below the track; it
then fell heavily to the bottom.The tender lodged on top of the
locomotive, bottom up and resting against the pier, while on top
of this again was the first baggage car.The second baggage car,
which contained also a compartment for smokers, followed, but in
falling was canted over to the north side of the draw in such a way
as not to be wholly submerged, so that most of those in it were
saved.The first passenger car next plunged into the opening; its
forward end crushed in, as it fell against the baggage car in front
of it, while its rear end dropped into the deep water below; and
on top of it came the second passenger car, burying the passengers
in the first beneath the _débris_, and itself partially submerged.The succeeding or third passenger car, instead of following the
others, broke in two in the middle, the forward part hanging down
over the edge of the draw, while the rear of it rested on the track
and stayed the course of the remainder of the train.Including those
in the smoking compartment more than a hundred persons were plunged
into the channel, of whom forty-six lost their lives, while some
thirty others were more or less severely injured.The killed were
mainly among the passengers in the first car; for, in falling, the
roof of the second car was split open, and it finally rested in such
a position that, as no succeeding car came on top of it, many of
those in it were enabled to extricate themselves; indeed, more than
one of the passengers in falling were absolutely thrown through the
aperture in the roof, and, without any volition on their part, were
saved with unmoistened garments.Shocking as this catastrophe was, it was eclipsed in horror by
another exactly similar in character, though from the peculiar
circumstances of the case it excited far less public notice, which
occurred eleven years later on the Grand Trunk railway of Canada.In this case a large party of emigrants, over 500 in number and
chiefly Poles, Germans and Norwegians of the better class, had
landed at Quebec and were being forwarded on a special train to
their destination in the West.With their baggage they filled
thirteen cars.The Grand Trunk on the way to Montreal crosses the
Richelieu river at Beloeil by an iron bridge, in the westernmost
span of which was a draw over the canal, some 45 feet below it.Both
by law and under the running rules of the road all trains were to
come to a dead stand on approaching the bridge, and to proceed only
when the safety signal was clearly discerned.This rule, however,
as it appeared at the subsequent inquest, had been systematically
disobeyed, it having been considered sufficient if the train was
"slowed down."In the present case, however--the night of June 29,
1864,--though the danger signal was displayed and in full sight
for a distance of 1,600 feet, the engine-driver, unfamiliar with
the road and its signals, failed to see it, and, without slowing
his train even, ran directly onto the bridge.He became aware of
the danger when too late to stop.The draw was open to permit the
passage of a steamer with six barges in tow, one of which was
directly under the opening.The whole train went through the draw,
sinking the barge and piling itself up in the water on top of it.The three last cars, falling on the accumulated wreck, toppled over
upon the west embankment and were thus less injured than the others.The details of the accident were singularly distressing."As soon
as possible a strong cable was attached to the upper part of the
piling, and by this means two cars, the last of the ill-fated train,
were dragged onto the wharf under the bridge.A shapeless blue mass of hands and heads and feet
protruded among the splinters and frame-work, and gradually resolved
itself into a closely-packed mass of human beings, all ragged and
bloody and dinted from crown to foot with blue bruises and weals
and cuts inflicted by the ponderous iron work, the splinters and
the enormous weight of the train.* * * A great many of the dead
had evidently been asleep; the majority of them had taken off their
boots and coats in the endeavor to make themselves as comfortable
as possible.They lay heaped upon one another like sacks, dressed
in the traditional blue clothing of the German people.* * * A
child was got at and removed nine hours after the accident, being
uninjured in its dead mother's arms."The accident happened at 2 A.M., and before sundown of the next day
86 bodies had been taken out of the canal; others were subsequently
recovered, and yet more died from their hurts.It was altogether a disaster of the most
appalling description, in extenuation of which nothing was to
be said.It befell, however, a body of comparatively friendless
emigrants, and excited not a tithe of the painful interest which yet
attaches to the similar accident to the Boston express at Norwalk.These terrible disasters were both due, not alone to the
carelessness of the two engine-drivers, but to the use of a crude
and inadequate system of signals.It so happened, however, that
the legislature of Connecticut was unfortunately in session at the
time of the Norwalk disaster, and consequently the public panic
and indignation took shape in a law compelling every train on
the railroads of that state to come to a dead stand-still before
entering upon any bridge in which there was a draw.This law is
still in force, and from time to time, as after the New Hamburg
catastrophe, an unreasoning clamor is raised for it in other
states.In point of fact it imposes a most absurd, unnecessary and
annoying delay on travel, and rests upon the Connecticut statute
book a curious illustration of what usually happens when legislators
undertake to incorporate running railroad regulations into the
statutes-at-large.It is of a par with another law, which has for
more than twenty-five years been in force in Connecticut's sister
state of Massachusetts, compelling in all cases where the tracks of
different companies cross each other at a level the trains of each
company to stop before reaching the crossing, and then to pass over
it slowly.The danger of collision at crossings is undoubtedly much
greater than that of going through open draws.Precautions against
danger in each case are unquestionably proper and they cannot be
too perfect, but to have recourse to stopping either in the one
case or the other simply reveals an utter ignorance of the great
advance which has been made in railroad signals and the science of
interlocking.In both these cases it is, indeed, entitled to just
about the same degree of respect as would be a proposal to recur to
pioneer engines as a means of preventing accidents to night trains.The machinery by means of which both draws and grade crossings
can be protected, will be referred to in another connection,[7]
meanwhile it is a curious fact that neither at grade crossings
nor at draws has the mere stopping of trains proved a sufficient
protection.Several times in the experience of Massachusetts' roads
have those in charge of locomotives, after stopping and while moving
at a slow rate of speed, actually run themselves into draws with
their eyes open, and afterwards been wholly unable to give any
satisfactory explanation of their conduct.But the insufficiency
of stopping as a reliable means of prevention was especially
illustrated in the case of an accident which occurred upon the
Boston & Maine railroad on the morning of the 21st of November,
1862, when the early local passenger train was run into the open
draw of the bridge almost at the entrance to the Boston station.It
so happened that the train had stopped at the Charlestown station
just before going onto the bridge, and at the time the accident
occurred was moving at a speed scarcely faster than a man could
walk; and yet the locomotive was entirely submerged, as the water
at that point is deep, and the only thing which probably saved the
train was that the draw was so narrow and the cars were so long that
the foremost one lodged across the opening, and its forward end only
was beneath the water.At the rate at which the train was moving
the resistance thus offered was sufficient to stop it, though, even
as it was, no less than six persons lost their lives and a much
larger number were more or less injured.Here all the precautions
imposed by the Connecticut law were taken, and served only to
reveal the weak point in it.The accident was due to the neglect of
the corporation in not having the draw and its system of signals
interlocked in such a way that the movement of the one should
automatically cause a corresponding movement of the other; and this
neglect in high quarters made it possible for a careless employé to
open the draw on a particularly dark and foggy morning, while he
forgot at the same time to shift his signals.An exactly similar
instance of carelessness on the part of an employé resulted in the
derailment of a train upon the Long Branch line of the Central Road
of New Jersey at the Shrewsbury river draw on August 9, 1877.In
this case the safety signal was shown while the draw fastening had
been left unsecured.The jar of the passing train threw the draw
slightly open so as to disconnect the tracks; thus causing the
derailment of the train, which subsequently plunged over the side
of the bridge.Fortunately the tide was out, or there would have
been a terrible loss of life; as it was, some seventy persons were
injured, five of whom subsequently died.This accident also, like
that on the Boston & Maine road in 1862, very forcibly illustrated
the necessity of an interlocking apparatus.The safety signal was
shown before the draw was secured, which should have been impossible.[7] Chapters XVII and XVIII.Prior to the year 1873 there is no consecutive record of this or
any other class of railroad accidents occurring in America, but
during the six years 1873-8 there occurred twenty-one cases of
minor disaster at draws, three only of them to passenger trains.Altogether, excluding the Shrewsbury river accident, these resulted
in the death of five employés and injury to one other.In Great Britain not a single case of disaster of any
description has been reported as occurring at a draw-bridge since
the year 1870, when the present system of official Board of Trade
reports was begun.The lesson clearly to be drawn from a careful
investigation of all the American accidents reported would seem to
be that a statute provision making compulsory the interlocking of
all draws in railroad bridges with a proper and infallible system
of signals might have claims on the consideration of an intelligent
legislature; not so an enactment which compels the stopping of
trains at points where danger is small, and makes no provision as
respects other points where it is great.Great as were the terrors inspired by the Norwalk disaster in those
comparatively early days of railroad experience, and deep as the
impression on the public memory must have been to leave its mark
on the statute book even to the present time, that and the similar
disaster at the Richelieu river are believed to have been the only
two of great magnitude which have occurred at open railroad draws.That this should be so is well calculated to excite surprise,
for the draw-bridge precautions against accident in America are
wretchedly crude and inadequate, amounting as a rule to little more
than the primitive balls and targets by day and lanterns by night,
without any system of alarms or interlocking.Electricity as an
adjunct to human care, or a corrective rather of human negligence,
is almost never used; and, in fact, the chief reliance is still on
the vigilance of engine-drivers.But, if accidents at draws have
been comparatively rare and unattended with any considerable loss
of life, it has been far otherwise with the rest of the structures
of which the draw forms a part.Bridge accidents in fact always
have been, and will probably always remain, incomparably the worst
to which travel by rail is exposed.It would be impossible for
corporations to take too great precautions against them, and that
the precautions taken are very great is conclusively shown by the
fact that, with thousands of bridges many times each day subjected
to the strain of the passage at speed of heavy trains, so very few
disasters occur.When they do occur, however, the lessons taught
by them are, though distinct enough, apt to be in one important
respect of a far less satisfactory character than those taught by
collisions.In the case of these last the great resultant fact
speaks for itself.The whole community knows when it sees a block
system, or a stronger car construction, or an improved train brake
suddenly introduced that the sacrifice has not been in vain--that
the lesson has been learned.It is by no means always so in the
case of accidents on bridges.With these the cause of disaster
is apt to be so scientific in its nature that it cannot even be
described, except through the use of engineering terms which to the
mass of readers are absolutely incomprehensible.The simplest of
railroad bridges is an inexplicable mystery to at least ninety-nine
persons out of each hundred.Even when the cause of disaster is
understood, the precautions taken against its recurrence cannot be
seen.From the nature of the case they must consist chiefly of a
better material, or a more scientific construction, or an increased
watchfulness on the part of officials and subordinates.This,
however, is not apparent on the surface, and, when the next accident
of the same nature occurs, the inference, as inevitable as it is
usually unjust, is at once drawn that the one which preceded it
had been productive of no results.The truth of this was strongly
illustrated by the two bridge accidents which happened, the one at
Ashtabula, Ohio, on the 29th of December, 1876, and the other at
Tariffville, Connecticut, on the 15th of January, 1878.There has been no recent disaster which combined more elements
of horror or excited more widespread public emotion than that at
Ashtabula bridge.It was, indeed, so terrible in its character and
so heart-rending in its details, that for the time being it fairly
divided the attention of the country with that dispute over the
presidential succession, then the subject uppermost in the minds of
all.A blinding northeasterly snow-storm, accompanied by a heavy
wind, prevailed throughout the day which preceded the accident,
greatly impeding the movement of trains.The Pacific express over
the Michigan Southern & Lake Shore road had left Erie, going west,
considerably behind its time, and had been started only with great
difficulty and with the assistance of four locomotives.It was due
at Ashtabula at about 5.30 o'clock P.M., but was three hours late,
and, the days being then at their shortest, when it arrived at the
bridge which was the scene of the accident the darkness was so great
that nothing could be seen through the driving snow by those on the
leading locomotive even for a distance of 50 feet ahead.The train
was made up of two heavy locomotives, four baggage, mail and express
cars, one smoking car, two ordinary coaches, a drawing-room car
and three sleepers, being in all two locomotives and eleven cars,
in the order named, containing, as nearly as can be ascertained,
190 human beings, of whom 170 were passengers.Ashtabula bridge is
situated only about 1,000 feet east of the station of the same name,
and spans a deep ravine, at the bottom of which flows a shallow
stream, some two or three feet in depth, which empties into Lake
Erie a mile or two away.The bridge was an iron Howe truss of 150
feet span, elevated 69 feet above the bottom of the ravine, and
supported at either end by solid masonwork abutments.As the train approached the bridge it had
to force its way through a heavy snow-drift, and, when it passed
onto it, it was moving at a speed of some twelve or fourteen miles
an hour.The entire length of the bridge afforded space only for
two of the express cars at most in addition to the locomotives,
so that when the wheels of the leading locomotive rested on the
western abutment of the bridge nine of the eleven cars which made up
the train, including all those in which there were passengers, had
yet to reach its eastern end.At the instant when the train stood
in this position, the engineer of the leading locomotive heard a
sudden cracking sound apparently beneath him, and thought he felt
the bridge giving way.Instantly pulling the throttle valve wide
open, his locomotive gave a spring forward and, as it did so, the
bridge fell, the rear wheels of his tender falling with it.The
jerk and impetus of the locomotive, however, sufficed to tear out
the coupling, and as his tender was dragged up out of the abyss
onto the track, though its rear wheels did not get upon the rails,
the frightened engineer caught a fearful glimpse of the second
locomotive as it seemed to turn and then fall bottom upwards into
the ravine.The bridge had given way, not at once but by a slowly
sinking motion, which began at the point where the pressure was
heaviest, under the two locomotives and at the west abutment.There
being two tracks, and this train being on the southernmost of the
two, the southern truss had first yielded, letting that side of
the bridge down, and rolling, as it were, the second locomotive
and the cars immediately behind it off to the left and quite clear
of a straight line drawn between the two abutments; then almost
immediately the other truss gave way and the whole bridge fell, but
in doing so swung slightly to the right.Before this took place the
entire train with the exception of the last two sleepers had reached
the chasm, each car as it passed over falling nearer than the one
which had preceded it to the east abutment, and finally the last two
sleepers came, and, without being deflected from their course at
all, plunged straight down and fell upon the wreck of the bridge at
its east end.It was necessarily all the work of a few seconds.At the bottom of the ravine the snow lay waist deep and the stream
was covered with ice some eight inches in thickness.Upon this
were piled up the fallen cars and engine, the latter on top of the
former near the western abutment and upside down.All the passenger
cars were heated by stoves.At first a dead silence seemed to
follow the successive shocks of the falling mass.In less than
two minutes, however, the fire began to show itself and within
fifteen the holocaust was at its height.As usual, it was a mass of
human beings, all more or less stunned, a few killed, many injured
and helpless, and more yet simply pinned down to watch, in the
possession as full as helpless of all their faculties, the rapid
approach of the flames.The number of those killed outright seems
to have been surprisingly small.In the last car, for instance,
no one was lost.This was due to the energy and presence of mind
of the porter, a <DW64> named Steward, who, when he felt the car
resting firmly on its side, broke a window and crawled through it,
and then passed along breaking the other windows and extricating
the passengers until all were gotten out.Those in the other cars
were far less fortunate.Though an immediate alarm had been given
in the neighboring town, the storm was so violent and the snow so
deep that assistance arrived but slowly.Nor when it did arrive
could much be effected.The essential thing was to extinguish the
flames.The means for so doing were close at hand in a steam pump
belonging to the railroad company, while an abundance of hose could
have been procured at another place but a short distance off.In
the excitement and agitation of the moment contradictory orders
were given, even to forbidding the use of the pump, and practically
no effort to extinguish the fire was made.Within half an hour of
the accident the flames were at their height, and when the next
morning dawned nothing remained in the ravine but a charred and
undistinguishable mass of car trucks, brake-rods, twisted rails and
bent and tangled bridge iron, with the upturned locomotive close to
the west abutment.In this accident some eighty persons are supposed to have lost
their lives, while over sixty others were injured.The exact number
of those killed can never be known, however, as more than half of
those reported were utterly consumed in the fire; indeed, even of
the bodies recovered scarcely one half could be identified.Of the
cause of the disaster much was said at the time in language most
unnecessarily scientific;--but little was required to be said.It
admitted of no extenuation.An iron bridge, built in the early days
of iron-bridges,--that which fell under the train at Ashtabula, was
faulty in its original construction, and the indications of weakness
it had given had been distinct, but had not been regarded.That it
had stood so long and that it should have given way when it did,
were equally matters for surprise.A double track bridge, it should
naturally have fallen under the combined pressure of trains moving
simultaneously in opposite directions.The strain under which it
yielded was not a particularly severe one, even taken in connection
with the great atmospheric pressure of the storm then prevailing.It was, in short, one of those disasters, fortunately of infrequent
occurrence, with which accident has little if any connection.It was due to original inexperience and to subsequent ignorance
or carelessness, or possibly recklessness as criminal as it was
fool-hardy.Besides being a bridge accident, this was also a stove accident,--in
this respect a repetition of Angola.One of the most remarkable
features about it, indeed, was the fearful rapidity with which
the fire spread, and the incidents of its spread detailed in the
subsequent evidence of the survivors were simply horrible.Men,
women and children, full of the instinct of self-preservation, were
caught and pinned fast for the advancing flames, while those who
tried to rescue them were driven back by the heat and compelled
helplessly to listen to their shrieks.It is, however, unnecessary
to enter into these details, for they are but the repetition of
an experience which has often been told, and they do but enforce
a lesson which the railroad companies seem resolved not to learn.Unquestionably the time in this country will come when through
trains will be heated from a locomotive or a heating-car.That time,
however, had not yet come.Meanwhile the evidence would seem to show
that at Ashtabula, as at Angola, at least two lives were sacrificed
in the subsequent fire to each one lost in the immediate shock of
the disaster.[8]

  [8] The Angola was probably the most impressively horrible of the
  many "stove accidents."That which occurred near Prospect, N. Y.,
  upon the Buffalo, Corry & Pittsburgh road, on December 24, 1872,
  should not, however, be forgotten.In this case a trestle bridge
  gave way precipitating a passenger train some thirty feet to the
  bottom of a ravine, where the cars caught fire from the stoves.Nineteen lives were lost, mostly by burning.The Richmond Switch
  disaster of April 19, 1873, on the New York, Providence & Boston
  road was of the same character.Three passengers only were there
  burned to death, but after the disaster the flames rushed "through
  the car as quickly as if the wood had been a lot of hay," and, after
  those who were endeavoring to release the wounded and imprisoned men
  were driven away, their cries were for some time heard through the
  smoke and flame.But a few days more than a year after the Ashtabula accident another
catastrophe, almost exactly similar in its details, occurred on
the Connecticut Western road.It is impossible to even estimate
the amount of overhauling to which bridges throughout the country
had in the meanwhile been subjected, or the increased care used
in their examination.All that can be said is that during the
year 1877 no serious accident due to the inherent weakness of any
bridge occcurred on the 70,000 miles of American railroad.Neither,
so far as can be ascertained, was the Tariffville disaster to be
referred to that cause.It happened on the evening of January 15,
1878.A large party of excursionists were returning from a Moody
and Sankey revival meeting on a special train, consisting of two
locomotives and ten cars.Half a mile west of Tariffville the
railroad crosses the Farmington river.The bridge at this point was
a wooden Howe truss, with two spans of 163 feet each.It had been
in use about seven years and, originally of ample strength and good
construction, there is no evidence that its strength had since been
unduly impaired by neglect or exposure.It should, therefore, have
sufficed to bear twice the strain to which it was now subjected.Exactly as at Ashtabula, however, the west span of the bridge gave
way under the train just as the leading locomotives passed onto the
tressel-work beyond it: the ice broke under the falling wreck, and
the second locomotive with four cars were precipitated into the
river.The remaining cars were stopped by the rear end of the third
car, resting as it did on the centre pier of the bridge, and did
not leave the rails.The fall to the surface of the ice was about
ten feet.There was no fire to add to the horrors in this case, but
thirteen persons were crushed to death or drowned, and thirty-three
others injured.[9]

  [9] Of the same general character with the Tariffville and Ashtabula
  accidents were those which occurred on November 1, 1855, upon the
  Pacific railroad of Missouri at the bridge over the Gasconade, and
  on July 27, 1875, upon the Northern Pacific at the bridge over the
  Mississippi near Brainerd.In the first of these accidents the
  bridge gave way under an excursion train, in honor of the opening
  of the road, and its chief engineer was among the killed.The train
  fell some thirty feet, and 22 persons lost their lives while over 50
  suffered serious injuries.At Brainerd the train,--a "mixed" one,--went down nearly 80 feet
  into the river.The locomotive and several cars had passed the span
  which fell, in safety, but were pulled back and went down on top
  of the train.There were but few passengers in it, of whom three
  were killed.In falling the caboose car at the rear of the train,
  in which most of the passengers were, struck on a pier and broke in
  two, leaving several passengers in it.In the case of the Gasconade,
  the disaster was due to the weakness of the bridge, which fell under
  the weight of the train.There is some question as to the Brainerd
  accident, whether it was occasioned by weakness of the bridge or the
  derailment upon it of a freight car.Naturally the popular inference was at once drawn that this was
a mere repetition of the Ashtabula experience,--that the fearful
earlier lesson had been thrown away on a corporation either
unwilling or not caring to learn.The newspapers far and wide
resounded with ill considered denunciation, and the demand was loud
for legislation of the crudest conceivable character, especially
a law prohibiting the passage over any bridge of two locomotives
attached to one passenger train.The fact, however, seems to be
that, except in its superficial details, the Tariffville disaster
had no features in common with that at Ashtabula; as nearly as
can be ascertained it was due neither to the weakness nor to the
overloading of the bridge.Though the evidence subsequently given
is not absolutely conclusive on this point, the probabilities
would seem to be that, while on the bridge, the second locomotive
was derailed in some unexplained way and consequently fell on
the stringers which yielded under the sudden blow.The popular
impression, therefore, as to the bearing which the first of these
two strikingly similar accidents had upon the last tended only to
bring about results worse than useless.The bridge fell, not under
the steady weight of two locomotives, but under the sudden shock
incident to the derailment of one.The remedy, therefore, lay in the
direction of so planking or otherwise guarding the floors of similar
bridges that in case of derailment the locomotives or cars should
not fall on the stringers or greatly diverge from the rails so as
to endanger the trusses.On the other hand the suggestion of a law
prohibiting the passage over bridges of more than one locomotive
with any passenger train, while in itself little better than a legal
recognition of bad bridge building, also served to divert public
attention from the true lesson of the disaster.Another newspaper
precaution, very favorably considered at the time, was the putting
of one locomotive, where two had to be used, at the rear end of the
train as a pusher, instead of both in front.This expedient might
indeed obviate one cause of danger, but it would do so only by
substituting for it another which has been the fruitful source of
some of the worst railroad disasters on record.[10]

  [10] "The objectionable and dangerous practice also employed on some
  railways of assisting trains up inclines by means of pilot engines
  in the rear instead of in front, has led to several accidents in
  the past year and should be discontinued."--_General Report to the
  Board of Trade upon the Accidents on the Railways of Great Britain
  in 1878, p.Long, varied and terrible as the record of bridge disasters has
become, there are, nevertheless, certain very simple and inexpensive
precautions against them, which, altogether too frequently,
corporations do not and will not take.At Ashtabula the bridge
gave way.There was no derailment as there seems to have been
at Tariffville.The sustaining power of a bridge is, of course,
a question comparatively difficult of ascertainment.A fatal
weakness in this respect may be discernable only to the eye of a
trained expert.Derailment, however, either upon a bridge, or when
approaching it, is in the vast majority of cases a danger perfectly
easy to guard against.The precautions are simple and they are not
expensive, yet, taking the railroads of the United States as a
whole, it may well be questioned whether the bridges at which they
have been taken do not constitute the exception rather than the
rule.Not only is the average railroad superintendent accustomed
to doing his work and running his road under a constant pressure to
make both ends meet, which, as he well knows, causes his own daily
bread to depend upon the economies he can effect; but, while he
finds it hard work at best to provide for the multifarious outlays,
long immunity from disaster breeds a species of recklessness even
in the most cautious:--and yet the single mishap in a thousand
must surely fall to the lot of some one.Many years ago the
terrible results which must soon or late be expected wherever the
consequences of a derailment on the approaches to a bridge are not
securely guarded against, were illustrated by a disaster on the
Great Western railroad of Canada, which combined many of the worst
horrors of both the Norwalk and the New Hamburg tragedies; more
recently the almost forgotten lesson was enforced again on the
Vermont & Massachusetts road, upon the bridge over the Miller River,
at Athol.The accident last referred to occurred on the 16th of
June, 1870, but, though forcible enough as a reminder, it was tame
indeed in comparison with the Des Jardines Canal disaster, which
is still remembered though it happened so long ago as the 17th of
March, 1857.The Great Western railroad of Canada crossed the canal by a bridge
at an elevation of about sixty feet.At the time of the accident
there were some eighteen feet of water in the canal, though, as
is usual in Canada at that season, it was covered by ice some two
feet in thickness.On the afternoon of the 17th of March as the
local accommodation train from Hamilton was nearing the bridge,
its locomotive, though it was then moving at a very slow rate of
speed, was in some way thrown from the track and onto the timbers
of the bridge.These it cut through, and then falling heavily on
the string-pieces it parted them, and instantly pitched headlong
down upon the frozen surface of the canal below, dragging after it
the tender, baggage car and two passenger cars, which composed the
whole train.There was nothing whatever to break the fall of sixty
feet; and even then two feet of ice only intervened between the
ruins of the train and the bottom of the canal eighteen feet below.Two feet of solid ice will afford no contemptible resistance to a
falling body; the locomotive and tender crushed heavily through
it and instantly sank out of sight.In falling the baggage car
struck a corner of the tender and was thus thrown some ten yards
to one side, and was followed by the first passenger car, which,
turning a somersault as it went, fell on its roof and was crushed to
fragments, but only partially broke through the ice, upon which the
next car fell endwise, and rested in that position.That every human
being in the first car was either crushed or drowned seems most
natural; the only cause for astonishment is found in the fact that
any one should have survived such a catastrophe,--a tumble of sixty
feet on ice as solid as a rock!Yet of four persons in the baggage
car three went down with it, and not one of them was more than
slightly injured.The engineer and fireman, and the occupants of the
second passenger car, were less fortunate.The former were found
crushed under the locomotive at the bottom of the canal; while of
the latter ten were killed, and not one escaped severe injury.Very
rarely indeed in the history of railroad accidents have so large a
portion of those on the train lost their lives as in this case, for
out of ninety persons sixty perished, and in the number was included
every woman and child among the passengers, with a single exception.There were two circumstances about this disaster worthy of especial
notice.In the first place, as well as can now be ascertained in
the absence of any trustworthy record of an investigation into
causes, the accident was easily preventable.It appears to have
been immediately caused by the derailment of a locomotive, however
occasioned, just as it was entering on a swing draw-bridge.Thrown
from the tracks, there was nothing in the flooring to prevent the
derailed locomotive from deflecting from its course until it toppled
over the ends of the ties, nor were the ties and the flooring
apparently sufficiently strong to sustain it even while it held to
its course.Under such circumstances the derailment of a locomotive
upon any bridge can mean only destruction; it meant it then,
it means it now; and yet our country is to-day full of bridges
constructed in an exactly similar way.To make accidents from this
cause, if not impossible at least highly improbable, it is only
necessary to make the ties and flooring of all bridges between the
tracks and for three feet on either side of them sufficiently strong
to sustain the whole weight of a train off the track and in motion,
while a third rail, or strong truss of wood, securely fastened,
should be laid down midway between the rails throughout the entire
length of the bridge and its approaches.With this arrangement, as
the flanges of the wheels are on the inside, it must follow that in
case of derailment and a divergence to one side or the other of the
bridge, the inner side of the flange will come against the central
rail or truss just so soon as the divergence amounts to half the
space between the rails, which in the ordinary gauge is two feet and
four inches.The wheels must then glide along this guard, holding
the train from any further divergence from its course, until it
can be checked.Meanwhile, as the ties and flooring extend for the
space of three feet outside of the track, a sufficient support is
furnished by them for the other wheels.A legislative enactment
compelling the construction of all bridges in this way, coupled with
additional provisions for interlocking of draws with their signals
in cases of bridges across navigable waters, would be open to
objection that laws against dangers of accident by rail have almost
invariably proved ineffective when they were not absurd, but in
itself, if enforced, it might not improbably render disasters like
those at Norwalk and Des Jardines terrors of the past.CAR-COUPLINGS IN DERAILMENTS.Wholly apart from the derailment, which was the real occasion of
the Des Jardines disaster, there was one other cause which largely
contributed to its fatality, if indeed that fatality was not in
greatest part immediately due to it.The question as to what is the best method of coupling together
the several individual vehicles which make up every railroad
train has always been much discussed among railroad mechanics.The decided weight of opinion has been in favor of the strongest
and closest couplings, so that under no circumstances should the
train separate into parts.Taking all forms of railroad accident
together, this conclusion is probably sound.It is, however, at
best only a balancing of disadvantages,--a mere question as to
which practice involves the least amount of danger.Yet a very
terrible demonstration that there are two sides to this as to most
other questions was furnished at Des Jardines.It was the custom
on the Great Western road not only to couple the cars together in
the method then in general use, but also, as is often done now, to
connect them by heavy chains on each side of the centre coupling.Accordingly when the locomotive broke through the Des Jardines
bridge, it dragged the rest of the train hopelessly after it.This
certainly would not have happened had the modern self-coupler been
in use, and probably would not have happened had the cars been
connected only by the ordinary link and pins; for the train was
going very slowly, and the signal for brakes was given in ample time
to apply them vigorously before the last cars came to the opening,
into which they were finally dragged by the dead weight before them
and not hurried by their own momentum.On the other hand, we have not far to go in search of scarcely less
fatal disasters illustrating with equal force the other side of the
proposition, in the terrible consequences which have ensued from the
separation of cars in cases of derailment.Take, for instance, the
memorable accident of June 17, 1858, near Port Jervis, on the Erie
railway.As the express train from New York was running at a speed of about
thirty miles an hour over a perfectly straight piece of track
between Otisville and Port Jervis, shortly after dark on the evening
of that day, it encountered a broken rail.The train was made up
of a locomotive, two baggage cars and five passenger cars, all of
which except the last passed safely over the fractured rail.The
last car was apparently derailed, and drew the car before it off the
track.These two cars were then dragged along, swaying fearfully
from side to side, for a distance of some four hundred feet, when
the couplings at last snapped and they went over the embankment,
which was there some thirty feet in height.As they rushed down the
<DW72> the last car turned fairly over, resting finally on its roof,
while one of its heavy iron trucks broke through and fell upon the
passengers beneath, killing and maiming them.The other car, more
fortunate, rested at last upon its side on a pile of stones at the
foot of the embankment.Six persons were killed and fifty severely
injured; all of the former in the last car.In this case, had the couplings held, the derailed cars would
not have gone over the embankment and but slight injuries would
have been sustained.Modern improvements have, however, created
safeguards sufficient to prevent the recurrence of other accidents
under the same conditions as that at Port Jervis.The difficulty lay
in the inability to stop a train, though moving at only moderate
speed, within a reasonable time.The wretched inefficiency of the
old hand-brake in a sudden emergency received one more illustration.The train seems to have run nearly half a mile after the accident
took place before it could be stopped, although the engineer had
instant notice of it and reversed his locomotive.The couplings did
not snap until a distance had been traversed in which the modern
train-brake would have reduced the speed to a point at which they
would have been subjected to no dangerous strain.The accident ten years later at Carr's Rock, sixteen miles west of
Port Jervis, on the same road, was again very similar to the one
just described: and yet in this case the parting of the couplings
alone prevented the rear of the train from dragging its head to
destruction.Both disasters were occasioned by broken rails; but,
while the first occurred on a tangent, the last was at a point where
the road skirted the hills, by a sharp curve, upon the outer side of
which was a steep declivity of some eighty feet, jagged with rock
and bowlders.It befell the night express on the 14th of April,
1876.The train was a long one, consisting of the locomotive, three
baggage and express, and seven passenger cars, and it encountered
the broken rail while rounding the curve at a high rate of speed.Again all except the last car, passed over the fracture in safety;
this was snapped, as it were, off the track and over the embankment.At first it was dragged along, but only for a short distance; the
intense strain then broke the coupling between the four rear cars
and the head of the train, and, the last of the four being already
over the embankment, the others almost instantly toppled over after
it and rolled down the ravine.A passenger on this portion of the
train, described the car he was in "as going over and over, until
the outer roof was torn off, the sides fell out, and the inner roof
was crushed in."Twenty-four persons were killed and eighty injured;
but in this instance, as in that at Des Jardines, the only occasion
for surprise was that there were any survivors.Accidents arising from the parting of defective couplings have of
course not been uncommon, and they constitute one of the greatest
dangers incident to heavy gradients; in surmounting inclines freight
trains will, it is found, break in two, and their hinder parts come
thundering down the grade, as was seen at Abergele.The American
passenger trains, in which each car is provided with brakes, are
much less liable than the English, the speed of which is regulated
by brake-vans, to accidents of this description.Indeed, it may be
questioned whether in America any serious disaster has occurred from
the fact that a portion of a passenger train on a road operated by
steam got beyond control in descending an incline.There have been,
however, terrible catastrophes from this cause in England, and that
on the Lancashire & Yorkshire road near Helmshere, a station some
fourteen miles north of Manchester, deserves a prominent place in
the record of railroad accidents.It occurred in the early hours of the morning of the 4th of
September, 1860.There had been a great _fête_ at the Bellevue
Gardens in Manchester on the 3d, upon the conclusion of which some
twenty-five hundred persons crowded at once upon the return trains.Of these there were, on the Lancashire & Yorkshire road, three; the
first consisting of fourteen, the second of thirty-one, and the last
of twenty-four carriages: and they were started, with intervals of
ten minutes between them, at about eleven o'clock at night.The
first train finished its journey in safety.The Helmshere station is at the top of a steep incline.This the second train, drawn by two locomotives, surmounted, and
then stopped for the delivery of passengers.While these were
leaving the carriages, a snap as of fractured iron was heard, and
the guards, looking back, saw the whole rear portion of the train,
consisting of seventeen carriages and a brake-van, detached from
the rest of it and quietly slipping down the incline.The detached
portion was moving so slowly that one of the guards succeeded in
catching the van and applying the brakes; it was, however, already
too late.The velocity was greater than the brake-power could
overcome, and the seventeen carriages kept descending more and
more rapidly.Meanwhile the third train had reached the foot of
the incline and begun to ascend it, when its engineer, on rounding
a curve, caught sight of the descending carriages.He immediately
reversed his engine, but before he could bring his train to a stand
they were upon him.Fortunately the van-brakes of the detached
carriages, though insufficient to stop them, yet did reduce their
speed; the collision nevertheless was terrific.The force of the
blow, so far as the advancing train was concerned, expended itself
on the locomotive, which was demolished, while the passengers
escaped with a fright.With them there was nothing to break the blow, and the two hindmost
carriages were crushed to fragments and their passengers scattered
over the line.It was shortly after midnight, and the excursionists
clambered out of the trains and rushed frantically about, impeding
every effort to clear away the _débris_ and rescue the injured,
whose shrieks and cries were incessant.The bodies of ten persons,
one of whom had died of suffocation, were ultimately taken out from
the wreck, and twenty-two others sustained fractures of limbs.At Des Jardines the couplings were too strong; at Port Jervis and
at Helmshere they were not strong enough; at Carr's Rock they gave
way not a moment too soon."There are objections to a plenum and
there are objections to a vacuum," as Dr.Johnson remarked, "but a
plenum or a vacuum it must be."There are no arguments, however,
in favor of putting railroad stations or sidings upon an inclined
plane, and then not providing what the English call "catch-points"
or "scotches" to prevent such disasters as those at Abergele or
Helmshere.In these two instances alone the want of them cost
over fifty lives.In railroad mechanics there are after all some
principles susceptible of demonstration.That vehicles, as well as
water, will run down hill may be classed among them.That these
principles should still be ignored is hardly less singular than it
is surprising.THE REVERE CATASTROPHE.The terrible disaster which occurred in front of the little
station-building at Revere, six miles from Boston on the Eastern
railroad of Massachusetts, in August 1871, was, properly speaking,
not an accident at all; it was essentially a catastrophe--the
legitimate and almost inevitable final outcome of an antiquated and
insufficient system.As such it should long remain a subject for
prayerful meditation to all those who may at any time be entrusted
with the immediate operating of railroads.It was terribly dramatic,
but it was also frightfully instructive; and while the lesson was by
no means lost, it yet admits of further and advantageous study.For,
like most other men whose lives are devoted to a special calling,
the managers of railroads are apt to be very much wedded to their
own methods, and attention has already more than once been called to
the fact that, when any new emergency necessitates a new appliance,
they not infrequently, as Captain Tyler well put it in his report
to the Board of Trade for the year 1870, "display more ingenuity in
finding objections than in overcoming them."[Illustration: map]

The Eastern railroad of Massachusetts connects Boston with Portland,
in the state of Maine, by a line which is located close along the
sea-shore.Between Boston and Lynn, a distance of eleven miles, the
main road is in large part built across the salt marshes, but there
is a branch which leaves it at Everett, a small station some miles
out of Boston, and thence, running deviously through a succession
of towns on the higher ground, connects with the main track again
at Lynn; thus making what is known in England as a loop-road.At
the time of the Revere accident this branch was equipped with
but a single track, and was operated wholly by schedule without
any reliance on the telegraph; and, indeed, there were not even
telegraphic offices at a number of the stations upon it.Revere,
the name of the station where the accident took place, was on the
main line about five miles from Boston and two miles from Everett,
where the Saugus branch, as the loop-road was called, began.The
accompanying diagram shows the relative position of the several
points and of the main and branch lines, a thorough appreciation of
which is essential to a correct understanding of the disaster.The travel over the Eastern railroad is of a somewhat exceptional
nature, varying in a more than ordinary degree with the different
seasons of the year.During the winter months the corporation had,
in 1871, to provide for a regular passenger movement of about
seventy-five thousand a week, but in the summer what is known
as the excursion and pleasure travel not infrequently increased
the number to one hundred and ten thousand, and even more.As a
natural consequence, during certain weeks of each summer, and more
especially towards the close of August, it was no unusual thing for
the corporation to find itself taxed beyond its utmost resources.It
is emergencies of this description, periodically occurring on every
railroad, which always subject to the final test the organization
and discipline of companies and the capacity of superintendents.A
railroad in quiet times is like a ship in steady weather; almost
anybody can manage the one or sail the other.It is the sudden
stress which reveals the undeveloped strength or the hidden
weakness; and the truly instructive feature in the Revere accident
lay in the amount of hidden weakness everywhere which was brought to
light under that sudden stress.During the week ending with that
Saturday evening upon which the disaster occurred the rolling stock
of the road had been heavily taxed, not only to accommodate the
usual tide of summer travel, then at its full flood, but also those
attending a military muster and two large camp-meetings upon its
line.The number of passengers going over it had accordingly risen
from about one hundred and ten thousand, the full summer average,
to over one hundred and forty thousand; while instead of the one
hundred and fifty-two trains a day provided for in the running
schedule, there were no less than one hundred and ninety-two.It
had never been the custom with those managing the road to place any
reliance upon the telegraph in directing the train movement, and no
use whatever appears to have been made of it towards straightening
out the numerous hitches inevitable from so sudden an increase in
that movement.If an engine broke down, or a train got off the
track, there had accordingly throughout that week been nothing
done, except patient and general waiting, until things got in
motion again; each conductor or station-master had to look out for
himself, under the running regulations of the road, and need expect
no assistance from headquarters.This, too, in spite of the fact
that, including the Saugus branch, no less than ninety-three of the
entire one hundred and fifteen miles of road operated by the company
were supplied only with a single track.The whole train movement,
both of the main line and of the branches, intricate in the extreme
as it was, thus depended solely on a schedule arrangement and the
watchful intelligence of individual employés.Not unnaturally,
therefore, as the week drew to a close the confusion became so
great that the trains reached and left the Boston station with an
almost total disregard of the schedule; while towards the evening
of Saturday the employés of the road at that station directed their
efforts almost exclusively to dispatching trains as fast as cars
could be procured, thus trying to keep it as clear as possible of
the throng of impatient travellers which continually blocked it up.Taken altogether the situation illustrated in a very striking manner
that singular reliance of the corporation on the individuality
and intelligence of its employés, which in another connection is
referred to as one of the most striking characteristics of American
railroad management, without a full appreciation of which it is
impossible to understand its using or failing to use certain
appliances.According to the regular schedule four trains should have left the
Boston station in succession during the hour and a half between 6.30
and eight o'clock P.M.: a Saugus branch train for Lynn at 6.30; a
second Saugus branch train at seven; an accommodation train, which
ran eighteen miles over the main line, at 7.15; and finally the
express train through to Portland, also over the main line, at
eight o'clock.The collision at Revere was between these last two
trains, the express overtaking and running into the rear of the
accommodation train; but it was indirectly caused by the delays
and irregularity in movement of the two branch trains.It will be
noticed that, according to the schedule, both of the branch trains
should have preceded the accommodation train; in the prevailing
confusion, however, the first of the two branch trains did not leave
the station until about seven o'clock, thirty minutes behind its
time, and it was followed forty minutes later, not by the second
branch train, but by the accommodation train, which in its turn was
twenty-five minutes late.Thirteen minutes afterwards the second
Saugus branch train, which should have preceded, followed it, being
nearly an hour out of time.Then at last came the Portland express,
which got away practically on time, at a few minutes after eight
o'clock.All of these four trains went out over the same track as
far as the junction at Everett, but at that point the first and
third of the four were to go off on the branch, while the second and
fourth kept on over the main line.Between these last two trains
the running schedule of the road allowed an ample time-interval of
forty-five minutes, which, however, on this occasion was reduced,
through the delay in starting, to some fifteen or twenty minutes.No causes of further delay, therefore, arising, the simple case
was presented of a slow accommodation train being sent out to run
eighteen miles in advance of a fast express train, with an interval
of twenty minutes between them.Unfortunately, however, the accommodation train was speedily
subjected to another and very serious delay.It has been mentioned
that the Saugus branch was a single track road, and the rules of
the company were explicit that no outward train was to pass onto
the branch at Everett until any inward train then due there should
have arrived and passed off it.There was no siding at the junction,
upon which an outward branch train could be temporarily placed to
wait for the inward train, thus leaving the main track clear; and
accordingly, under a strict construction of the rules, any outward
branch train while awaiting the arrival at Everett of an inward
branch train was to be kept standing on the main track, completely
blocking it.The outward branch trains, it subsequently appeared,
were often delayed at the junction, but no practical difficulty had
arisen from this cause, as the employé in charge of the signals
and switches there, exercising his common sense, had been in the
custom of moving any delayed train temporarily out of the way onto
the branch or the other main track, under protection of a flag,
and thus relieving the block.The need of a siding to permit the
passage of trains at this point had not been felt, simply because
the employé in charge there had used the branch or other main track
as a siding.On the day of the accident this employé happened to be
sick, and absent from his post.His substitute either had no common
sense or did not feel called upon to use it, if its use involved
any increase of responsibility.Accordingly, when a block took
place, the simple letter of the rule was followed;--and it is almost
needless to add that a block did take place on the afternoon of
August 26th.The first of the branch trains, it will be remembered, had left
Boston at about seven o'clock, instead of at 6.30, its schedule
time.On arriving at Everett this train should have met and passed
an inward branch train, which was timed to leave Lynn at six
o'clock, but which, owing to some accident to its locomotive, and
partaking of the general confusion of the day, on this particular
afternoon did not leave the Lynn station until 7.30 o'clock, or one
hour and a half after its schedule time, and one half-hour after
the other train had left Boston.Accordingly, when the Boston train
reached the junction its conductor found himself confronted by the
rule forbidding him to enter upon the branch until the Lynn train
then due should have passed off it, and so he quietly waited on the
outward track of the main line, blocking it completely to traffic.He had not waited long before a special locomotive, on its way from
Boston to Salem, came up and stopped behind him.This was presently
followed by the accommodation train.Then the next branch train came
along, and finally the Portland express.At such a time, and at that
period of railroad development, there was something ludicrous about
the spectacle.Here was a road utterly unable to accommodate its
passengers with cars, while a succession of trains were standing
idle for hours, because a locomotive had broken down ten miles off.The telegraph was there, but the company was not in the custom of
putting any reliance upon it.A simple message to the branch trains
to meet and pass at any point other than that fixed in the schedule
would have solved the whole difficulty; but, no!--there were the
rules, and all the rolling stock of the road might gather at Everett
in solemn procession, but, until the locomotive at Lynn could be
repaired, the law of the Medes and Persians was plain; and in this
case it read that the telegraph was a new-fangled and unreliable
auxiliary.And so the lengthening procession stood there long enough
for the train which caused it to have gone to its destination and
come back dragging the disabled locomotive from Lynn behind it to
again take its place in the block.At last, at about ten minutes after eight o'clock, the long-expected
Lynn train made its appearance, and the first of the branch trains
from Boston immediately went off the main line.The road was now
clear for the accommodation train, which had been standing some
twelve or fifteen minutes in the block, but which from the moment
of again starting was running on the schedule time of the Portland
express.Every minute was vital,
and yet he never thought to look at his watch.He had a vague
impression that he had been delayed some six or eight minutes, when
in reality he had been delayed fifteen; and, though he was running
wholly out of his schedule time, he took not a single precaution, so
persuaded was he that every one knew where he was.The confusion among those in charge of the various engines and
trains was, indeed, general and complete.As the Portland express
was about to leave the Boston station, the superintendent of the
road, knowing by the non-arrival of the branch train from Lynn that
there must be a block at the Everett junction, had directed the
depot-master to caution the engineer to look out for the trains
ahead of him.The order, a merely verbal one, was delivered after
the train had started, the depot-master walking along by the side of
the slowly-moving locomotive, and was either incorrectly transmitted
or not fully understood; the engine-driver supposed it to apply to
the branch train which had started just before him, out of both its
schedule time and schedule place.Presently, at the junction, he was
stopped by the signal man of this train.The course of reasoning he
would then have had to pass through to divine the true situation
of affairs and to guide himself safely under the schedule in the
light of the running rules was complicated indeed, and somewhat as
follows: "The branch train," he should have argued to himself, "is
stopped, and it is stopped because the train which should have left
Lynn at six o'clock has not yet arrived; but, under the rules, that
train should pass off the branch before the 6.30 train could pass
onto it; if, therefore, the 'wild' train before me is delayed not
only the 6.30 but all intermediate trains must likewise be delayed,
and the accommodation train went out this afternoon after the 6.30
train, so it, too, must be in the block ahead of me; unless, indeed,
as is usually the case, the signal-master has got it out of the
block under the protection of a flag."This line of reasoning was,
perhaps, too intricate; at any rate, the engine-driver did not
follow it out, but, when he saw the tail-lights immediately before
him disappear on the branch, he concluded that the main line was
now clear, and dismissed the depot-master's caution from his mind.Meanwhile, as the engine-driver of this train was fully persuaded
that the only other train in his front had gone off on the branch,
the conductor of the accommodation train was equally persuaded that
the head-light immediately behind him in the block at the junction
had been that of the Portland express which consequently should be
aware of his position.Thus when they left Everett the express was fairly chasing the
accommodation train, and overtaking it with terrible rapidity.Even then no collision ought to have been possible.Unfortunately,
however, the road had no system, even the crudest, of interval
signals; and the utter irregularity prevailing in the train
movement seemed to have demoralized the employés along the line,
who, though they noticed the extreme proximity of the two trains
to each other as they passed various points, all sluggishly took
it for granted that those in charge of them were fully aware of
their relative positions and knew what they were about.Thus, as
the two trains approached the Revere station, they were so close
together as to be on the same piece of straight track at the same
time, and a passenger standing at the rear end of the accommodation
train distinctly saw the head-light of the express locomotive.The
night, however, was not a clear one, for an east wind had prevailed
all day, driving a mist in from the sea which lay in banks over
the marshes, lifting at times so that distant objects were quite
visible, and then obscuring them in its heavy folds.Consequently it
did not at all follow, because the powerful reflecting head-light
of the locomotive was visible from the accommodation train, that
the dim tail-lights of the latter were also visible to those on the
locomotive.The tail-lights in use by
the company were ordinary red lanterns without reflecting power.The station house at Revere stood at the end of a tangent, the
track curving directly before it.In any ordinary weather the
tail-lights of a train standing at this station would have been
visible for a very considerable distance down the track in the
direction of Boston, and even on the night of the accident they
were probably visible for a sufficient distance in which to stop
any train approaching at a reasonable rate of speed.Unfortunately
the engineer of the Portland express did not at once see them,
his attention being wholly absorbed in looking for other signals.Certain freight train tracks to points on the shore diverged from
the main line at Revere, and the engine-drivers of all trains
approaching that place were notified by signals at a masthead close
to the station whether the switches were set for the main line or
for these freight tracks.A red lantern at the masthead indicated
that the main line was closed; in the absence of any signal it
was open.In looking for this signal as he approached Revere the
engine-driver of the Portland express was simply attending closely
to his business, for, had the red light been at the masthead, his
train must at once have been stopped.Unfortunately, however, while
peering through the mist at the masthead he overlooked what was
directly before him, until, when at last he brought his eyes down to
the level, to use his own words at the subsequent inquest, "the tail
lights of the accommodation train seemed to spring right up in his
face."When those in charge of the two trains at almost the same moment
became aware of the danger, there was yet an interval of some eight
hundred feet between them.The express train was, however, moving
at a speed of some twenty-five or thirty miles an hour, and was
equipped only with the old-fashioned hand-brake.In response to the
sharply given signal from the whistle these were rapidly set, but
the rails were damp and slippery, so that the wheels failed to catch
upon them, and, when everything was done which could be done, the
eight hundred feet of interval sufficed only to reduce the speed of
the colliding locomotive to about ten miles an hour.In the rear car of the accommodation train there were at the moment
of the accident some sixty-five or seventy human beings, seated
and standing.They were of both sexes and of all ages; for it was
a Saturday evening in August, and many persons had, through the
confusion of the trains, been long delayed in their return from
the city to their homes at the sea-side.The first intimation the
passengers had of the danger impending over them was from the
sudden and lurid illumination of the car by the glare from the
head-light of the approaching locomotive.One of them who survived
the disaster, though grievously injured, described how he was
carelessly watching a young man standing in the aisle, laughing
and gayly chatting with four young girls, who were seated, when he
saw him turn and instantly his face, in the sudden blaze of the
head-light, assumed a look of frozen horror which was the single
thing in the accident indelibly impressed on the survivor's memory;
that look haunted him.The car was crowded to its full capacity, and
the colliding locomotive struck it with such force as to bury itself
two-thirds of its length in it.At the instant of the crash a panic
had seized upon the passengers, and a sort of rush had taken place
to the forward end of the car, into which furniture, fixtures and
human beings were crushed in a shapeless, indistinguishable mass.Meanwhile the blow had swept away the smoke-stack of the locomotive,
and its forward truck had been forced back in some unaccountable way
until it rested between its driving wheels and the tender, leaving
the entire boiler inside of the passenger car and supported on its
rear truck.The valves had been so broken as to admit of the free
escape of the scalding steam, while the coals from the fire-box
were scattered among the _débris_, and coming in contact with the
fluid from the broken car lamps kindled the whole into a rapid
blaze.Neither was the fire confined to the last car of the train.It has been mentioned that in the block at Everett a locomotive
returning to Salem had found itself stopped just in advance of the
accommodation train.At the suggestion of the engine-driver of that
train this locomotive had there coupled on to it, and consequently
made a part of it at Revere.When the collision took place,
therefore, the four cars of which the accommodation train was made
up were crushed between the weight of the entire colliding train on
one side and that of two locomotives on the other.That they were
not wholly demolished was due simply to the fact that the last car
yielded to the blow, and permitted the locomotive of the express
train fairly to imbed itself in it.As it was, the remaining cars
were jammed and shattered, and, though the passengers in them
escaped, the oil from the broken lamps ignited, and before the
flames could be extinguished the cars were entirely destroyed.This accident resulted in the death of twenty-nine persons, and
in more or less severe injuries to fifty-seven others.No person,
not in the last car of the accommodation train was killed, and
one only was seriously injured.Of those in the last car more
than half lost their lives; many instantly by crushing, others by
inhaling the scalding steam which poured forth from the locomotive
boiler into the wreck, and which, where it did not kill, inflicted
frightful injuries.Indeed, for the severity of injuries and for the
protractedness of agony involved in it, this accident has rarely, if
ever, been exceeded.Crushing, scalding and burning did their work
together.It may with perfect truth be said that the disaster at Revere marked
an epoch in the history of railroad development in New England.At
the moment it called forth the deepest expression of horror and
indignation, which, as usual in such cases, was more noticeable for
its force than for its wisdom.An utter absence of all spirit of
justice is, indeed, a usual characteristic of the more immediate
utterances, both from the press and on the platform, upon occasions
of this character.Writers and orators seem always to forget that,
next to the immediate sufferers and their families, the unfortunate
officials concerned are the greatest losers by railroad accidents.For them, not only reputation but bread is involved.A railroad
employé implicated in the occurrence of an accident lives under a
stigma.And yet, from the tenor of public comment it might fairly be
supposed that these officials are in the custom of plotting to bring
disasters about, and take a fiendish delight in them.Nowhere was
this ever illustrated more perfectly than in Massachusetts during
the last days of August and the early days of September, 1871.Grave
men--men who ought to have known better--indulged in language which
would have been simply ludicrous save for the horror of the event
which occasioned but could not justify it.A public meeting, for
instance, was held at the town of Swampscott on the evening of the
Monday succeeding the catastrophe.The gentleman who presided over
it very discreetly, in his preliminary remarks, urged those who
proposed to join in the discussion to control their feelings.Hardly
had he ceased speaking, however, when Mr.Wendell Phillips was
noticed among the audience, and immediately called to the platform.His remarks were a most singular commentary on the chairman's
injunction to calmness.He began by announcing that the first
requisite to the formation of a healthy public opinion in regard
to railroad accidents, as other things, was absolute frankness of
speech, and he then proceeded as follows:--"So I begin by saying
that to my mind this terrible disaster, which has made the last
thirty-six hours so sad to us all, is a deliberate murder.I think
we should try to get rid in the public mind of any real distinction
between the individual who, in a moment of passion or in a moment of
heedlessness, takes the life of one fellow-man, and the corporation
that in a moment of greed, of little trouble, of little expense, of
little care, of little diligence, takes lives by wholesale.I think
the first requisite of the public mind is to say that there is no
accident in the case, properly speaking.It is a murder; the guilt
of murder rests somewhere."Phillip's definition of the crime of "deliberate murder"
would apparently somewhat unsettle the criminal law as at present
understood, but he was not at all alone in this bathos of
extravagance.Prominent gentlemen seemed to vie with each other
in their display of ignorance.B. F. Butler, for instance,
suggested his view of the disaster and the measure best calculated
to prevent a repetition of it; which last was certainly original,
inasmuch as he urged the immediate raising of the pay of all
engine-men until a sufficiently high order of ability and education
should be brought into the occupation to render impossible the
recurrence of an accident which was primarily caused by the
negligence, not of an engineer, but of a conductor.Another
gentleman described with much feeling his observations during a
recent tour in Europe, and declared that such a catastrophe as that
at Revere would have been impossible there.As a matter of fact
the official reports not only showed that the accident was one of
a class of most frequent occurrence, but also that sixty-one cases
of it had occurred in Great Britain alone during the very year the
gentleman in question was journeying in Europe, and had occasioned
over six hundred cases of death or personal injury.Perhaps, in
order to illustrate how very reckless in statement a responsible
gentleman talking under excitement may become, it is worth while to
quote in his own language Captain Tyler's brief description of one
of those sixty-one accidents which "could not possibly," but yet
did, occur."As four London & North-Western excursion trains on September
     2, 1870, were returning from a volunteer review at Penrith,
     the fourth came into collision at Penruddock with the third of
     those trains.An hundred and ten passengers and three servants
     of the company were injured.These trains were partly in charge
     of acting guards, some of whom were entirely inexperienced, as
     well in the line as in their duties; and of engine-drivers and
     firemen, of whom one, at all events, was very much the worse for
     liquor.The side-lamps on the hind van of the third train were
     obscured by a horse-box, which was wider than the van.There
     were no special means of protection to meet the exceptional
     contingency of three such trains all stopping on their way from
     the eastward, to cross two others from the westward, at this
     station.And the regulations for telegraphing the trains were
     altogether neglected."The annals of railroad accidents are full of cases of "rear-end
collision," as it is termed.[11] Their frequency may almost be
accepted as a very accurate gauge of the pressure of traffic on
any given system of lines, and because of them the companies are
continually compelled to adopt new and more intricate systems of
operation.At first, on almost all roads, trains follow each other
at such great intervals that no precaution at all, other than flags
and lanterns, are found necessary.Then comes a succeeding period
when an interval of time between following trains is provided for,
through a system of signals which at given points indicate danger
during a certain number of minutes after the passage of every
train.Then, presently, the alarming frequency of rear collisions
demonstrates the inadequacy of this system, and a new one has to be
devised, which, through the aid of electricity, secures between the
trains an interval of space as well as of time.This last is known
as the "block-system," of which so much has of late years been heard.[11] In the nine years 1870-8, besides those which occurred and
  were not deemed of sufficient importance to demand special inquiry,
  86 cases of accidents of this description were investigated by the
  inspecting officers of the English Board of Trade and reported upon
  in detail.In America, 732 cases were reported as occurring during
  the six years 1874-8, and 138 cases in 1878 alone.The block-system is so important a feature in the modern operation
of railroads, and in its present stage of development it illustrates
so strikingly the difference between the European and the American
methods, that more particular reference will have presently to be
made to it.[12] For the present it is enough to say that rear-end
collisions occur notwithstanding all the precautions implied in a
thoroughly perfected "block-system."There was such a case on the
Metropolitan road, in the very heart of London, on the 29th of
August, 1873.A train was stalled there,
and an unfortunate signal officer in a moment of flurry gave "line
clear" and sent another train directly into it.A much more impressive disaster, both in its dramatic features
and as illustrating the inadequacy of every precaution depending
on human agency to avert accident under certain conditions, was
afforded in the case of a collision which occurred on the London
& Brighton Railway on August 25, 1861; ten years almost to a day
before that at Revere.Like the Eastern railroad, the London
& Brighton enjoyed an enormous passenger traffic, which became
peculiarly heavy during the vacation season towards the close of
August; and it was to the presence of the excursion trains made
necessary to accomodate this traffic that the catastrophes were
in both cases due.In the case of the London & Brighton road it
occurred on a Sunday.An excursion train from Portsmouth on that
day was to leave Brighton at five minutes after eight A. M., and
was to be followed by a regular Sunday excursion train at 8.15 or
ten minutes later, and that again, after the lapse of a quarter of
an hour, by a regular parliamentary train at 8.30.These trains
were certainly timed to run sufficiently near to each other; but,
owing to existing pressure of traffic on the line, they started
almost simultaneously.The Portsmouth excursion, which consisted of
sixteen carriages, was much behind its time, and did not leave the
Brighton station until 8.28; when, after a lapse of three minutes,
it was followed by the regular excursion train at 8.31, and that
again by the parliamentary train at 8.35.Three passenger trains had
thus left the station on one track in seven minutes!The London and
Brighton Railway traverses the chalky downs, for which that portion
of England is noted, through numerous tunnels, the first of which
after leaving Brighton is known as the Patcham Tunnel, about five
hundred yards in length, while two and a half miles farther on is
the Croydon Tunnel, rather more than a mile and a quarter in length.The line between these tunnels was so crooked and obscured that the
managers had adopted extraordinary precautions against accident.At
each end of the Croydon Tunnel a signal-man was stationed, with a
telegraphic apparatus, a clock and a telegraph bell in his station.The rule was absolute that when any train entered the tunnel the
signal-man at the point of entry was to telegraph "train in," and
no other train could follow until the return signal of "train out"
came from the other side.In face of such a regulation it was
difficult to see how any collision in the tunnel was possible.When
the Portsmouth excursion train arrived, it at once entered the
tunnel and the fact was properly signaled to the opposite outlet.Before the return signal that this train was out was received, the
regular excursion train came in sight.It should have been stopped
by a self-acting signal which was placed about a quarter of a mile
from the mouth of the tunnel, and which each passing locomotive set
at "danger," where it remained until shifted to "safety," by the
signal-man, on receipt of the message, "train out."Through some
unexplained cause, the Portsmouth excursion train had failed to act
on this signal, which consequently still indicated safety when the
Brighton excursion train came up.Accordingly the engine-driver
at once passed it, and went on to the tunnel.As he did so, the
signal-man, perceiving some mistake and knowing that he had not yet
got his return signal that the preceding train was out, tried to
stop him by waving his red flag.It was too late, however, and the
train passed in.A moment later the parliamentary train also came
in sight, and stopped at the signal of danger.Now ensued a most
singular misapprehension between the signal-men, resulting in a
terrible disaster.The second train had run into the tunnel and was
supposed by the signal-man to be on its way to the other end of it,
when he received the return message that the first train was out.To this he instantly responded by again telegraphing "train in,"
referring now to the second train.This dispatch the signal-man
at the opposite end conceived to be a repetition of the message
referring to the first train, and he accordingly again replied that
the train was out.This reply, however, the other operator mistook
as referring to the second train, and accordingly he signaled
"safety," and the third train at once got under way and passed into
the tunnel.Unfortunately the engineer of the second train had
seen the red flag waved by the signal-man, and, in obedience to
it, stopped his locomotive as soon as possible in the tunnel and
began to back out of it.In doing so, he drove his train into the
locomotive of the third train advancing into it.The tunnel was
twenty-four feet in height.The engine of the parliamentary train
struck the rear carriage of the excursion train and mounted upon
its fragments, and then on those of the carriage in front of it,
until its smoke-stack came in contact with the roof of the tunnel.The collision had
taken place so far within the tunnel as to be beyond the reach of
daylight, and the wreck of the trains had quite blocked up the arch,
while the steam and smoke from the engines poured forth with loud
sound and in heavy volumes, filling the empty space with stifling
and scalding vapors.When at last assistance came and the trains
could be separated, twenty-three corpses were taken from the ruins,
while one hundred and seventy-six other persons had sustained more
or less severe injuries.A not less extraordinary accident of the same description,
unaccompanied, however, by an equal loss of life, occured on the
Great Northern Railway upon the 10th of June, 1866.In this case
the tube of a locomotive of a freight train burst at about the
centre of the Welwyn Tunnel, some five miles north of Hatfield,
bringing the train to a stand-still.The guard in charge of the
rear of the train failed from some cause to go back and give the
signal for an obstruction, and speedily another freight train from
the Midland road entered and dashed into the rear of the train
already there.Apparently those in charge of these two trains were
in such consternation that they did not think to provide against a
further disaster; at any rate, before measures to that end had been
taken, an additional freight train, this time belonging to the Great
Northern road, came up and plowed into the ruins which already
blocked the tunnel.One of the trains had contained wagons laden
with casks of oil, which speedily became ignited from contact with
the coals scattered from the fire-boxes, and there then ensued one
of the most extraordinary spectacles ever witnessed on a railroad.The tunnel was filled to the summit of its arch and completely
blocked with the wrecked locomotives and wagons.These had ignited,
and the whole cavity, more than a half a mile in length, was
converted into one huge furnace, belching forth smoke and flame with
a loud roaring sound through its several air shafts.So fierce was
the fire that no attempt was made to subdue it, and eighteen hours
elapsed before any steps could be taken towards clearing the track.Strange to say, in this disaster the lives of but two persons were
lost.Rear-end collisions have been less frequent in this country than
in England, for the simple reason that the volume of traffic has
pressed less heavily on the capacity of the lines.Yet here, also,
they have been by no means unknown.In 1865 two occurred, both of
which were accompanied with a considerable loss of life; though,
coming as they did during the exciting scenes which marked the
close of the war of the Rebellion, they attracted much less public
notice than they otherwise would.The first of these took place in
New Jersey on the 7th of March, 1865, just three days after the
second inauguration of President Lincoln.As the express train
from Washington to New York over the Camden & Amboy road was
passing through Bristol, about thirty miles from Philadelphia, at
half-past-two o'clock in the morning, it dashed into the rear of
the twelve o'clock "owl train," from Kensington to New York, which
had been delayed by meeting an oil train on the track before it.The case appears to have been one of very culpable negligence, for,
though the owl train was some two hours late, those in charge of it
seem to have been so deeply engrossed in what was going on before
them that they wholly neglected to guard their rear.The express
train accordingly, approaching around a curve, plunged at a high
rate of speed into the last car, shattering it to pieces; the engine
is even said to have passed completely through that car and to have
imbedded itself in the one before it.It so happened that most of
the sufferers by this accident, numbering about fifty, were soldiers
on their way home from the army upon furlough.The second of the two disasters referred to, occurred on the 16th of
August, 1865, upon the Housatonic road of Connecticut.A new engine
was out upon an experimental trip, and in rounding a curve it ran
into the rear of a passenger train, which, having encountered a
disabled freight train, had coupled on to it and was then backing
down with it to a siding in order to get by.In this case the
impetus was so great that the colliding locomotive utterly destroyed
the rear car of the passenger train and penetrated some distance
into the car preceding it, where its boiler burst.Fortunately
the train was by no means full of passengers; but, even as it was,
eleven persons were killed and some seventeen badly injured.The great peculiarity of the Revere accident, and that which gave
a permanent interest to it, lay in the revelation it afforded of
the degree in which a system had outgrown its appliances.The railroads of New England had
long been living on their early reputation, and now, when a sudden
test was applied, it was found that they were years behind the time.In August, 1871, the Eastern railroad was run as if it were a line
of stage-coaches in the days before the telegraph.Not in one point
alone, but in everything, it broke down under the test.The disaster
was due not to any single cause but to a combination of causes
implicating not only the machinery and appliances in use by the
company, but its discipline and efficiency from the highest official
down to the meanest subordinate.In the first place the capacity of
the road was taxed to the utmost; it was vital, almost, that every
wheel should be kept in motion.Yet, under that very exigency, the
wheels stopped almost as a matter of necessity.How could it be
otherwise?--Here was a crowded line, more than half of which was
equipped with but a single track, in operating which no reliance was
placed upon the telegraph.With trains running out of their schedule
time and out of their schedule place, engineers and conductors were
left to grope their way along as best they could in the light of
rules, the essence of which was that when in doubt they were to
stand stock still.Then, in the absence of the telegraph, a block
occurred almost at the mouth of the terminal station; and there the
trains stood for hours in stupid obedience to a stupid rule, because
the one man who, with a simple regard to the dictates of common
sense, was habitually accustomed to violate it happened to be sick.Trains commonly left a station out of time and out of place; and
the engineer of an express train was sent out to run a gauntlet the
whole length of the road with a simple verbal injunction to look
out for some one before him.Then, at last, when this express train
through all this chaos got to chasing an accommodation train, much
as a hound might course a hare, there was not a pretence of a signal
to indicate the time which had elapsed between the passage of the
two, and employés, lanterns in hand, gaped on in bewilderment at the
awful race, concluding that they could not at any rate do anything
to help matters, but on the whole they were inclined to think that
those most immediately concerned must know what they were about.Finally, even when the disaster was imminent, when deficiency in
organization and discipline had done its worst, its consequences
might yet have been averted through the use of better appliances;
had the one train been equipped with the Westinghouse brake,
already largely in use in other sections of the country, it might
and would have been stopped; or had the other train been provided
with reflecting tail-lights in place of the dim hand-lanterns which
glimmered on its rear platform, it could hardly have failed to make
its proximity known.Any one of a dozen things, every one of which
should have been but was not, ought to have averted the disaster.Obviously its immediate cause was not far to seek.It lay in the
carelessness of a conductor who failed to consult his watch, and
never knew until the crash came that his train was leisurely moving
along on the time of another.Nevertheless, what can be said in
extenuation of a system under which, at this late day, a railroad is
operated on the principle that each employé under all circumstances
can and will take care of himself and of those whose lives and limbs
are entrusted to his care?There is, however, another and far more attractive side to the
picture.The lives sacrificed at Revere were not lost in vain.Seven
complete railroad years passed by between that and the Wollaston
Heights accident of 1878.During that time not less than two hundred
and thirty millions of persons were carried by rail within the
limits of Massachusetts.Of this vast number while only 50, or
about one in each four and a half millions, sustained any injury
from causes beyond their own power to control, the killed were just
two.This certainly was a record with which no community could well
find fault; and it was due more than anything else to the great
disaster of August 26, 1871.More than once, and on more than one
road, accidents occurred which, but for the improved appliances
introduced in consequence of the experience at Revere, could hardly
have failed of fatal results.Not that these appliances were in
all cases very cheerfully or very eagerly accepted.Neither the
Miller platform nor the Westinghouse brake won its way into general
use unchallenged.Indeed, the earnestness and even the indignation
with which presidents and superintendents then protested that their
car construction was better and stronger than Miller's; that their
antiquated handbrakes were the most improved brakes,--better, much
better, than the Westinghouse; that their crude old semaphores and
targets afforded a protection to trains which no block-system would
ever equal,--all this certainly was comical enough, even in the
very shadow of the great tragedy.Men of a certain type always have
protested and will always continue to protest that they have nothing
to learn; yet, under the heavy burden of responsibility, learn
they still do.On this point the figures
of the Massachusetts annual returns between the year 1871 and the
year 1878 speak volumes.At the time of the Revere disaster, with
one single honorable exception,--that of the Boston & Providence
road,--both the atmospheric train-brake and the Miller platform, the
two greatest modern improvements in American car construction, were
practically unrecognized on the railroads of Massachusetts.Even a
year later, but 93 locomotives and 415 cars had been equipped even
with the train-brake.In September, 1873, the number had, however,
risen to 194 locomotives and 709 cars; and another twelve months
carried these numbers up to 313 locomotives and 997 cars.Finally
in 1877 the state commissioners in their report for that year spoke
of the train-brake as having been then generally adopted, and at
the same time called attention to the very noticeable fact "that
the only railroad accident resulting in the death of a passenger
from causes beyond his control within the state during a period of
two years and eight months, was caused by the failure of a company
to adopt this improvement on all its passenger rolling-stock."The adoption of Miller's method of car construction had meanwhile
been hardly less rapid.Almost unknown at the time of the Revere
catastrophe in September, 1871, in October, 1873, when returns on
the subject were first called for by the state commissioners,
eleven companies had already adopted it on 778 cars out of a total
number of 1548 reported.In 1878 it had been adopted by twenty-two
companies, and applied to 1685 cars out of a total of 1792.In other
words it had been brought into general use.THE AUTOMATIC ELECTRIC BLOCK SYSTEM.A realizing sense of the necessity of ultimately adopting some
system of protection against the danger of rear-end collisions was,
above all else, brought directly home to American railroad managers
through the Revere disaster.In discussing and comparing the
appliances used in the practical operation of railroads in different
countries, there is one element, however, which can never be left
out of the account.The intelligence, quickness of perception
and capacity for taking care of themselves--that combination of
qualities which, taken together, constitute individuality and
adaptability to circumstance--vary greatly among the railroad
employés of different countries.The American locomotive engineer,
as he is called, is especially gifted in this way.He can be relied
on to take care of himself and his train under circumstances which
in other countries would be thought to insure disaster.Volumes
on this point were included in the fact that though at the time
of the Revere disaster many of the American lines, especially in
Massachusetts, were crowded with the trains of a mixed traffic,
the necessity of making any provision against rear-end collisions,
further than by directing those in immediate charge of the trains
to keep a sharp look out and to obey their printed orders, seemed
hardly to have occurred to any one.The English block system was
now and then referred to in a vague, general way; but it was very
questionable whether one in ten of those referring to it knew
anything about it or had ever seen it in operation, much less
investigated it.A characteristic illustration of this was afforded
in the course of those official investigations which followed the
Revere disaster, and have already more than once been alluded to.Prior to that disaster the railroads of Massachusetts had, as a
rule, enjoyed a rather exceptional freedom from accidents, and
there was every reason to suppose that their regulations were as
exact and their system as good as those in use in other parts of
the country.Yet it then appeared that in the rules of very few of
the Massachusetts roads had any provision, even of the simplest
character, been made as to the effect of telegraphic orders, or
the course to be pursued by employés in charge of trains on their
receipt.The appliances for securing intervals between following
trains were marked by a quaint simplicity.They were, indeed,
"singularly primitive," as the railroad commissioners on a
subsequent occasion described them, when it appeared that on one of
the principal roads of the state the interval between two closely
following trains was signalled to the engineer of the second train
by a station-master's holding up to him as he passed a number of
fingers corresponding to the number of minutes since the first
train had gone by.For the rest the examination revealed, as the
nearest approach to a block system, a queer collection of dials,
sand-glasses, green flags,  lanterns and hand-targets.The
climax in the course of that investigation was, however, reached
when some reference, involving a description of it, was made to the
English block.This was met by a protest on the part of one veteran
superintendent, who announced that it might work well under certain
circumstances, but for himself he could not be responsible for the
operation of a road running the number of trains he had charge of in
reliance on any such system.The subject, in fact, was one of which
he knew absolutely nothing;--not even that, through the block system
and through it alone, fourteen trains were habitually and safely
moved under circumstances where he moved one.This occurred in 1871,
and though eight years have since elapsed information in regard
to the block system is not yet very widely disseminated inside of
railroad circles, much less outside of them.It is none the less
a necessity of the future.It has got to be understood, and, in
some form, it has got to be adopted; for even in America there are
limits to the reliance which, when the lives and limbs of many are
at stake, can be placed on the "sharp look out" of any class of men,
no matter how intelligent they may be.The block system is of English origin, and it scarcely needs
to be said that it was adopted by the railroad corporations of
that country only when they were driven to it by the exigencies
of their traffic.But for that system, indeed, the most costly
portion of the tracks of the English roads must of necessity have
been duplicated years ago, as their traffic had fairly outgrown
those appliances of safety which have even to this time been found
sufficient in America.There were points, for instance, where two
hundred and seventy regular trains of one line alone passed daily.On the London & North-Western there are more than sixty through
down trains, taking no account of local trains, each day passing
over the same line of tracks, among which are express trains which
stop nowhere, way trains which stop everywhere, express-freight,
way-freight, mineral trains and parcel trains.On the Midland road
there are nearly twice as many similar trains on each track.On the
Metropolitan railway the average interval is three and one-third
minutes between trains.In one case points were mentioned where
270 regular trains of one line alone passed a given junction
during each twenty-four hours,--where 470 trains passed a single
station, the regular interval between them being but five-eighths
of a mile,--where 132 trains entered and left a single station
during three hours of each evening every day, being one train in
eighty-two seconds.In 1870 there daily reached or left the six
stations of the Boston roads some 385 trains; while no less than
650 trains a day were in the same year received and despatched from
a single one of the London stations.On one single exceptional
occasion 1,111 trains, carrying 145,000 persons, were reported as
entering and leaving this station in the space of eighteen hours,
being rather more than a train a minute.Indeed it may well be
questioned whether the world anywhere else furnishes an illustration
so apt and dramatic of the great mechanical achievements of recent
times as that to be seen during the busy hours of any week-day from
the signal and interlocking galleries which span the tracks as
they enter the Charing Cross or Cannon street stations in London.Below and in front of the galleries the trains glide to and fro,
coming suddenly into sight from beyond the bridges and as suddenly
disappearing,--winding swiftly in and out, and at times four of them
running side by side on as many tracks but in both directions,--the
whole making up a swiftly shifting maze of complex movement under
the influence of which a head unaccustomed to the sight grows
actually giddy.Yet it is all done so quietly and smoothly, with
such an absence of haste and nervousness on the part of the stolid
operators in charge, that it is not easy to decide which most to
wonder at, the almost inconceivable magnitude and despatch of the
train-movement or the perfection of the appliances which make it
possible.No man concerned in the larger management of railroads,
who has not passed a morning in those London galleries, knows what
it is to handle a great city's traffic.Perfect as it is in its way, however, it may well be questioned
whether the block system as developed in England is likely to
be generally adopted on American railroads.Upon one or two of
them, and notably on the New Jersey Central and a division of the
Pennsylvania, it has already been in use for a number of years.From an American point of view, however, it is open to a number
of objections.That in itself it is very perfect and has been
successfully elaborated so as to provide for almost every possible
contingency is proved by the results daily accomplished by means of
it.[13] The English lines are made to do an incredible amount of
work with comparative few accidents.The block system is, however,
none the less a very clumsy and complicated one, necessitating the
constant employment of a large number of skilled operators.Here
is the great defect in it from the American point of view.In this
country labor is scarce and capital costly.The effort is always
towards the perfecting of labor-saving machines.Hitherto the
pressure of traffic on the lines has not been greater than could
be fairly controlled by simpler appliances, and the expense of the
English system is so heavy that its adoption, except partially,
would not have been warranted.As Barry says in his treatise on the
subject, "one can 'buy gold too dear'; for if every possible known
precaution is to be taken, regardless of cost, it may not pay to
work a railway at all."[13] An excellent popular description of this system will be found
  in Barry's _Railway Appliances, Chapter V_.It is tolerably safe, therefore, to predict that the American
block system of the future will be essentially different from the
present English system.The basis--electricity--will of course be
the same; but, while the operator is everywhere in the English
block, his place will be supplied to the utmost possible degree by
automatic action in the American.It is in this direction that the
whole movement since the Revere disaster has been going on, and
the advance has been very great.From peculiarities of condition
also the American block must be made to cover a multitude of weak
points in the operation of roads, and give timely notice of dangers
against which the English block provides only to a limited degree,
and always through the presence of yet other employés.For instance,
as will presently be seen, many more accidents and, in Europe even,
far greater loss of life is caused by locomotives coming in contact
with vehicles at points where highways cross railroad tracks at a
level therewith than by rear-end collisions; meanwhile throughout
America, even in the most crowded suburban neighborhoods, these
crossings are the rule, whereas in Europe they are the exception.The English block affords protection against this danger by giving
electric notice to gatemen; but gatemen are always supposed.So
also as respects the movements of passengers in and about stations
in crossing tracks as they come to or leave the trains, or prepare
to take their places in them.The rule in Europe is that passenger
crossings at local stations are provided over or under the tracks;
in America, however, almost nowhere is any provision at all made,
but passengers, men, women and children, are left to scramble across
tracks as best they can in the face of passing trains.They are
expected to take care of themselves, and the success with which they
do it is most astonishing.Having been brought up to this self-care
all their lives, they do not, as would naturally be supposed, become
confused and stumble under the wheels of locomotives; and the
statistics seem to show that no more accidents from this cause occur
in America than in Europe.Nevertheless some provision is manifestly
desirable to notify employés as well as passengers that trains are
approaching, especially where way-stations are situated on curves.Again, it is well known that, next to collisions, the greatest
source of danger to railroad trains is due to broken tracks.It
is, of course, apparent that tracks may at any time be broken by
accident, as by earth-slides, derailment or the fracture of rails.This danger has to be otherwise provided for; the block has nothing
to do with it further than to prevent a train delayed by any such
break from being run into by any following train.The broken track
which the perfect block should give notice of is that where the
break is a necessary incident to the regular operation of the road.It is these breaks which, both in America and elsewhere, are the
fruitful source of the great majority of railroad accidents, and
draw-bridges and switches, or facing points as they are termed in
the English reports, are most prominent among them.Wherever there
is a switch, the chances are that in the course of time there will
be an accident.Four matters connected with train movement have now been specified,
in regard to which some provision is either necessary or highly
desirable: these are rear collisions, tracks broken at draw-bridges
or at switches, highway grade crossings, and the notification of
agents and passengers at stations.The effort in America, somewhat
in advance of that crowded condition of the lines which makes the
adoption of something a measure of present necessity, has been
directed towards the invention of an automatic system which at
one and the same time should cover all the dangers and provide
for all the needs which have been referred to, eliminating the
risks incident to human forgetfulness, drowsiness and weakness of
nerves.Can reliable automatic provision thus be made?--The English
authorities are of opinion that it cannot.They insist that "if
automatic arrangements be adopted, however suitable they may be to
the duties which they have to perform, they should in all cases be
used as additions to, and not as substitutions for, safety machinery
worked by competent signal-men.The signal-man should be bound to
exercise his observation, care and judgment, and to act thereon; and
the machine, as far as possible, be such that if he attempts to go
wrong it shall check him."It certainly cannot be said that the American electrician has as
yet demonstrated the incorrectness of this conclusion, but he has
undoubtedly made a good deal of progress in that direction.Of the
various automatic blocks which have now been experimented with or
brought into practice, the Hall Electric and the Union Safety Signal
Company systems have been developed to a very marked degree of
perfection.They depend for their working on diametrically opposite
principles: the Hall signals being worked by means of an electric
circuit caused by the action of wheels moving on the rails, and
conveyed through the usual medium of wires; while, under the other
system, the wires being wholly dispensed with, a continuous electric
circuit is kept up by means of the rails, which are connected
for the purpose, and the signals are then acted upon through the
breaking of this normal circuit by the movement of locomotives and
cars.So far as the signals are concerned, there is no essential
difference between the two systems, except that Hall supplies the
necessary motive force by the direct action of electricity, while in
the other case dependence is placed upon suspended weights.Of the
two the Hall system is the oldest and most thoroughly elaborated,
having been compelled to pass through that long and useful tentative
process common to all inventions, during which they are regarded
as of doubtful utility and are gradually developed through a
succession of partial failures.So far as Hall's system is concerned
this period may now fairly be regarded as over, for it is in
established use on a number of the more crowded roads of the North,
and especially of New England, while the imperfections necessarily
incident to the development of an appliance at once so delicate and
so complicated, have for certain purposes been clearly overcome.Its signal arrangements, for instance, to protect draw-bridges,
stations and grade-crossings are wholly distinct from its block
system, through which it provides against dangers from collision and
broken tracks.So far as draw-bridges are concerned, the protection
it affords is perfect.Not only is its interlocking apparatus so
designed that the opening of the draw blocks all approach to it,
but the signals are also reciprocal; and if through carelessness or
automatic derangement any train passes the block, the draw-tender is
notified at once of the fact in ample time to stop it.In the case of a highway crossing at a level, the electric bell
under Hall's system is placed at the crossing, giving notice of
the approaching train from the moment it is within half a mile
until it passes; so that, where this appliance is in use, accidents
can happen only through the gross carelessness of those using the
highway.When the electric bell is silent there is no train within
half a mile and the crossing is safe; it is not safe while the bell
is ringing.As it now stands the law usually provides that the
prescribed signals, either bell or whistle, shall be given from the
locomotive as it approaches the highway, and at a fixed distance
from it.The signal, therefore, is given at a distance of several
hundred yards, more or less, from the point of danger.The electric
system improves on this by placing the signal directly at the point
of danger,--the traveller approaches the bell, instead of the bell
approaching the traveller.At any point of crossing which is really
dangerous,--that is at any crossing where trees or cuttings or
buildings mask the railroad from the highway,--this distinction is
vital.In the one case notice of the unseen danger must be given
and cannot be unobserved; in the other case whether it is really
given or not may depend on the condition of the atmosphere or the
direction of the wind.Usually, however, in New England the level crossings of the more
crowded thoroughfares, perhaps one in ten of the whole number, are
protected by gates or flag-men.Under similar circumstances in
Great Britain there is an electric connection between a bell in the
cabin of the gate-keeper and the nearest signal boxes of the block
system on each side of the crossing, so that due notice is given of
the approach of trains from either direction.In this country it has
heretofore been the custom to warn gate-keepers by the locomotive
whistle, to the intense annoyance of all persons dwelling near the
crossing, or to make them depend for notice on their own eyes.Under
the Hall system, however, the gate-keeper is automatically signalled
to be on the look out, if he is attending to his duty; or, if he is
neglecting it, the electric bell in some degree supplies his place,
without releasing the corporation from its liability.In America
the heavy fogs of England are almost unknown, and the brilliant
head lights, heavy bells and shrill high whistles in use on the
locomotives would at night, it might be supposed, give ample notice
to the most careless of an approaching train.Continually recurring
experience shows, however, that this is not the case.Under these
circumstances the electric bell at the crossing becomes not only a
matter of justice almost to the employé who is stationed there, but
a watchman over him.This, however, like the other forms of signals which have been
referred to, is, in the electric system, a mere adjunct of its chief
use, which is the block,--they are all as it were things thrown
into the bargain.As contradistinguished from the English block,
which insures only an unoccupied track, the automatic blocks seek to
insure an unbroken track as well,--that is not only is each segment
into which a road is divided, protected as respects following trains
by, in the case of Hall's system, double signals watching over each
other, the one at safety, the other at danger,--both having to
combine to open the block,--but every switch or facing point, the
throwing of which may break the main track, is also protected.The
Union Signal Company's system it is claimed goes still further than
this and indicates any break in the track, though due to accidental
fracture or displacement of rails.Without attempting this the Hall
system has one other important feature in common with the English
block, and a very important feature, that of enabling station agents
in case of sudden emergency to control the train movement within
half a mile or more of their stations on either side.Within the
given distance they can stop trains either leaving or approaching.The inability to do this has been the cause of some of the most
disastrous collisions on record, and notably those at Revere and at
Thorpe.The one essential thing, however, in every perfect block system,
whether automatic or worked by operators, is that in case of
accident or derangement or doubt, the signal should rest at danger.This the Hall system now fully provides for, and in case even of
the wilful displacement of a switch, an occurrence by no means
without precedent in railroad experience, the danger signal could
not but be displayed, even though the electric connection had been
tampered with.Accidents due to wilfullness, however, can hardly
be provided for except by police precautions.Train wrecking is
not to be taken into account as a danger incident to the ordinary
operation of a railroad.Carelessness or momentary inadvertence,
or, most dangerous of all, that recklessness--that unnecessary
assumption of risk somewhere or at some time, which is almost
inseparable from a long immunity from disaster--these are the
great sources of peril most carefully to be guarded against.The
complicated and unceasing train movement depends upon many thousand
employés, all of whom make mistakes or assume risks sometimes;--and
did they not do so they would be either more or less than men.Being, however, neither angels nor machines, but ordinary mortals
whose services are bought for money at the average market rate of
wages, it would certainly seem no small point gained if an automatic
machine could be placed on guard over those whom it is the great
effort of railroad discipline to reduce to automatons.Could this
result be attained, the unintentional throwing of a lever or the
carelessness which leaves it thrown, would simply block the track
instead of leaving it broken.An example of this, and at the same
time a most forcible illustration of the possible cost of a small
economy in the application of a safeguard, was furnished in the
case of the Wollaston disaster.At the time of that disaster, the
Old Colony railroad had for several years been partially equipped
on the portion of its track near Boston, upon which the accident
occurred, with Hall's system.It had worked smoothly and easily, was
well understood by the employés, and the company was sufficiently
satisfied with it to have even then made arrangements for its
extension.Unfortunately, with a too careful eye to the expenditure
involved, the line had been but partially equipped; points where
little danger was apprehended had not been protected.Among these
was the "Foundry switch," so called, near Wollaston.Had this switch
been connected with the system and covered by a signal-target, the
mere act of throwing it would have automatically blocked the track,
and only when it was re-set would the track have been opened.The
switch was not connected, the train hands were recklessly careless,
and so a trifling economy cost in one unguarded moment some fifty
persons life and limb, and the corporation more than $300,000.One objection to the automatic block is generally based upon the
delicacy and complicated character of the machinery on which its
action necessarily depends; and this objection is especially urged
against those other portions of the Hall system, covering draws
and level crossings, which have been particularly described.It
is argued that it is always liable to get out of order from a
great multiplicity of causes, some of which are very difficult to
guard against, and that it is sure to get out of order during any
electric disturbance; but it is during storms that accidents are
most likely to occur, and especially is this the case at highway
grade-crossings.It is comparatively easy to avoid accidents so long
as the skies are clear and the elements quiet; but it is exactly
when this is not the case and when it becomes necessary to use every
precaution, that electricity as a safeguard fails or runs mad, and,
by participating in the general confusion, proves itself worse
than nothing.Then it will be found that those in charge of trains
and tracks, who have been educated into a reliance upon it under
ordinary circumstances, will from force of habit, if nothing else,
go on relying upon it, and disaster will surely follow.This line of reasoning is plausible, but none the less open to
one serious objection; it is sustained neither by statistics nor
by practical experience.Moreover it is not new, for, slightly
varied in phraseology, it has been persistently urged against the
introduction of every new railroad appliance, and, indeed, was first
and most persistently of all urged against the introduction of
railroads themselves.Pretty and ingenious in theory, practically it
is not feasible!--for more than half a century this formula has been
heard.That the automatic electric signal system is complicated,
and in many of its parts of most delicate construction, is
undeniable.In point of fact the whole
railroad organization from beginning to end--from machine-shop to
train-movement--is at once so vast and complicated, so delicate
in that action which goes on with such velocity and power, that
it is small cause for wonder that in the beginning all plain,
sensible, practical men scouted it as the fanciful creation of
visionaries.They were wholly justified in so doing; and to-day
any sane man would of course pronounce the combined safety and
rapidity of ordinary railroad movement an utter impossibility, did
he not see it going on before his eyes.So it is with each new
appliance.It is ever suggested that at last the final result has
already been reached.It is but a few years, as will presently be
seen, since the Westinghouse brake encountered the old "pretty and
ingenious" formula.Going yet a step further, and taking the case
of electricity itself, the bold conception of operating an entire
line of single track road wholly as respects one half of its train
movement by telegraph, and without the use of any time table at
all, would once have been condemned as mad.Yet to-day half of the
vast freight movement of this continent is carried on in absolute
reliance on the telegraph.Nevertheless it is still not uncommon
to hear among the class of men who rise to the height of their
capacity in themselves being automaton superintendents that they do
not believe in deviating from their time tables and printed rules;
that, acting under them, the men know or ought to know exactly what
to do, and any interference by a train despatcher only relieves them
of responsibility, and is more likely to lead to accidents than if
they were left alone to grope their own way out.Another and very similar argument frequently urged against the
electric, in common with all other block systems by the large class
who prefer to exercise their ingenuity in finding objections rather
than in overcoming difficulties, is that they breed dependence and
carelessness in employés;--that engine-drivers accustomed to rely
on the signals, rely on them implicitly, and get into habits of
recklessness which lead inevitably to accidents, for which they
then contend the signals, and not they themselves, are responsible.This argument is, indeed, hardly less familiar than the "pretty and
ingenious" formula just referred to.It has, however, been met and
disposed of by Captain Tyler in his annual reports to the Board of
Trade in a way which can hardly be improved upon:--

     It is a favorite argument with those who oppose the introduction
     of some of these improvements, or who make excuses for the want
     of them, that their servants are apt to become more careless
     from the use of them, in consequence of the extra security which
     they are believed to afford; and it is desirable to consider
     seriously how much of truth there is in this assertion.* * *
     Allowing to the utmost for these tendencies to confide too
     much in additional means of safety, the risk is proved by
     experience to be very much greater without them than with them;
     and, in fact, the negligence and mistakes of servants are found
     to occur most frequently, and generally with the most serious
     results, not when the men are over-confident in their appliances
     or apparatus, but when, in the absence of them, they are
     habituated to risk in the conduct of the traffic.In the daily
     practice of railway working station-masters, porters, signalmen,
     engine-drivers or guards are frequently placed in difficulties
     which they have to surmount as best they can.The more they are
     accustomed to incur risk in order to perform their duties, the
     less they think of it, and the more difficult it is to enforce
     discipline and obedience to regulations.The personal risk which
     is encountered by certain classes of railway servants is coming
     to be more precisely ascertained.It is very considerable;
     and it is difficult to prevent men who are in constant danger
     themselves from doing things which may be a source of danger to
     others, or to compel them to obey regulations for which they do
     not see altogether the necessity, and which impede them in their
     work.This difficulty increases with the want of necessary means
     and appliances; and is diminished when, with proper means and
     appliances, stricter discipline becomes possible, safer modes
     of working become habitual, and a higher margin of safety is
     constantly preserved.[14]

  [14] Reports; 1872, page 23, and 1873, page 39.In Great Britain the ingenious theory that superior appliances
or greater personal comfort in some indefinable way lead to
carelessness in employés was carried to such an extent that only
within the last few years has any protection against wind, rain and
sunshine been furnished on locomotives for the engine-drivers and
stokers.The old stage-coach driver faced the elements, and why
should not his successor on the locomotive do the same?--If made too
comfortable, he would become careless and go to sleep!--This was the
line of argument advanced, and the tortures to which the wretched
men were subjected in consequence of it led to their fortifying
nature by drink.They had to be regularly inspected and examined
before mounting the foot-board, to see that they were sober.It took
years in Great Britain for intelligent railroad managers to learn
that the more protected and comfortable a man is the better he will
attend to his duty.And even when the old argument, refuted by long
experience, was at last abandoned as respected the locomotive cab,
it, with perfect freshness and confidence in its own novelty and
force, promptly showed its brutal visage in opposition to the next
new safeguard.For the reasons which Captain Tyler has so forcibly put in the
extracts which have just been quoted, the argument against the block
system from the increased carelessness of employés, supposed to be
induced by it, is entitled to no weight.Neither is the argument
from the delicacy and complication of the automatic, electric signal
system entitled to any more, when urged against that.Not only has
it been too often refuted under similar conditions by practical
results, but in this case it is based on certain assumptions of
fact which are wholly opposed to experience.The record does not
show that there is any peculiar liability to railroad accidents
during periods of storm; perhaps because those in charge of train
movements or persons crossing tracks are under such circumstances
more especially on the look out for danger.On the contrary the
full average of accidents of the worst description appear to
have occurred under the most ordinary conditions of weather, and
usually in the most unanticipated way.This is peculiarly true of
accidents at highway grade crossings.These commonly occur when the
conditions are such as to cause the highway travelers to suppose
that, if any danger existed, they could not but be aware of it.In the next place, the question in regard to automatic electric
signals is exactly what it was in regard to the Westinghouse brake,
with its air-pump, its valves and connecting tubes;--it is the
purely practical question,--Does the thing work?--The burden of
proof is properly on the inventor.Sandra journeyed to the office.In the case of the electric signals they have for years been
in limited but constant use, and while thus in use they have been
undergoing steady improvement.Though now brought to a considerable
degree of comparative perfection they are, of course, still in
their earlier stage of development.In use, however, they have not
been found open to the practical objections urged against them.At
first much too complicated and expensive, requiring more machinery
than could by any reasonable exertions be kept in order and more
care than they were worth, they have now been simplified until a
single battery properly located can do all the necessary work for
a road of indefinite length.As a system they are effective and do
not lead to accidents; nor are they any more subject than telegraph
wires to derangement from atmospheric causes.When any disturbance
does take place, until it can be overcome it amounts simply to a
general signal for operating the road with extreme caution.But with
railroads, as everywhere else in life, it is the normal condition of
affairs for which provision must be made, while the dangers incident
to exceptional circumstances must be met by exceptional precautions.As long as things are in their normal state, that is, probably,
during nineteen days out of twenty, the electric signals have now
through several years of constant trial proved themselves a reliable
safeguard.It can hardly admit of doubt that in the near future they
will be both further perfected and generally adopted.In their management of switches, especially at points of railroad
convergence where a heavy traffic is concentrated and the passage
of trains or movement of cars and locomotives is unceasing,
the English are immeasurably in advance of the Americans; and,
indeed, of all other people.In fact, in this respect the American
managers have shown themselves slow to learn, and have evinced an
indisposition to adopt labor-saving appliances which, considering
their usual quickness of discernment in that regard, is at first
sight inexplicable.Having always been accustomed to the old and
simple methods, just so long as they can through those methods
handle their traffic with a bearable degree of inconvenience and
expense, they will continue to do so.That their present method is
most extravagant, just as extravagant as it would be to rent two
houses or to run two steam engines where one, if properly used,
could be made to suffice, admits of demonstration;--but the waste is
not on the surface, and the necessity for economy is not imperative.The difference of conditions and the difference in results may be
made very obvious by a comparison.Take, for instance, London and
Boston--the Cannon street station in the one and the Beach street
station in the other.The concentration of traffic at London is so
great that it becomes necessary to utilize every foot of ground
devoted to railroad purposes to the utmost possible extent.Not
only must it be packed with tracks, but those tracks must never be
idle.The incessant train movement at Cannon street has already
been referred to as probably the most extraordinary and confusing
spectacle in the whole wide circle of railroad wonders.The result
is that in some way, at this one station and under this single roof,
more trains must daily be made to enter and leave than enter and
leave, not only the Beach street station, but all the eight railroad
stations in Boston combined.[15]

  [15] "It has been estimated that an average of 50,000 persons were,
  in 1869, daily brought into Boston and carried from it, on three
  hundred and eighty-five trains, while the South Eastern railway of
  London received and despatched in 1870, on an average, six hundred
  and fifty trains a day, between 6 A.M.carrying from
  35,000 to 40,000 persons, and this too without the occurrence of a
  single train accident during the year.On one single exceptional
  day eleven hundred and eleven trains, carrying 145,000 persons, are
  said to have entered and left this station in the space of eighteen
  hours."--_Third Annual Report, [1872] of Massachusetts Railroad
  Commissioners, p.141._

  The passenger movement over the roads terminating in Boston was
  probably as heavy on June 17, 1875, as during any twenty-four hours
  in their history.It was returned at 280,000 persons carried in
  641 trains.About twice the passenger movement of the "exceptional
  day" referred to, carried in something more than half the number of
  trains, entering and leaving eight stations instead of one.During eighteen successive hours trains have been made to enter and
leave this station at the rate of more than one in each minute.It
contains four platforms and seven tracks, the longest of which is
720 feet.As compared with the largest station in Boston (the Boston
& Providence), it has the same number of platforms and an aggregate
of 1,500 (three-fifths) more feet of track under cover; it daily
accommodates about nine times as many trains and four times as many
passengers.Of it Barry, in his treatise on Railway Appliances (p.197), says: "The platform area at this station is probably minimised
but, the station accommodates efficiently a very large mixed traffic
of long and short journey trains, amounting at times to as many as
400 trains in and 400 trains out in a working day.[16]"

  [16] The Grand Central Depot on 42d Street in New York City, has
  nearly twice the amount of track room under cover of the Cannon
  street station.The daily train movement of the latter would be
  precisely paralleled in New York, though not equalled in amount, if
  the 42d street station were at Trinity church, and, in addition to
  the trains which now enter and leave it, all the city trains of the
  Elevated road were also provided for there.The American system is, therefore, one of great waste; for, being
conducted in the way it is--that is with stations and tracks
utilized to but a fractional part of their utmost capacity--it
requires a large number of stations and tracks and the services of
many employés.Indeed it is safe to say that, judged by the London
standard, not more than two of the eight stations in Boston are at
this time utilized to above a quarter part of their full working
capacity; and the same is probably true of all other American
cities.Both employés and the travelling public are accustomed to a
slow movement and abundance of room; land is comparatively cheap,
and the pressure of concentration has only just begun to make itself
felt.Accordingly any person, who cares to pass an hour during the
busy time of day in front of an American city station, cannot but
be struck, while watching the constant movement, with the primitive
way in which it is conducted.Here are a multiplicity of tracks all
connected with each other, and cars and locomotives are being passed
from one to another from morning to night.A constant shifting
of switches is going on, and the little shunting engines never
stand still.The switches, however, as a rule, are unprovided with
signals, except of the crudest description; they have no connection
with each other, and during thirty years no change has been made
in the method in which they are worked.When one of them has to be
shifted, a man goes to it and shifts it.To facilitate the process,
the monitor shunting engines are provided with a foot-board in front
and behind, just above the track, upon which the yard hands jump,
and are carried about from switch to switch, thus saving the time
they would occupy if they had to walk.A simpler arrangement could
not be imagined; anyone could devise it.The only wonder is that
even a considerable traffic can be conducted safely in reliance upon
it.Turning from Beach to Cannon street, it is apparent that the
train movement which has there to be accommodated would fall into
inextricable confusion if it was attempted to manage it in the way
which has been described.The number of trains is so great and
the movement so rapid and intricate, that not even a regiment of
employés stationed here and there at the signals and switches could
keep things in motion.From time to time they would block, and then
the whole vast machine would be brought to a standstill until order
could be re-established.The difficulty is overcome in a very simple
way, by means of an equally simple apparatus.The control over
the numerous switches and corresponding signals, instead of being
divided up among many men stationed at many points, is concentrated
in the hands of two men occupying a single gallery, which is
elevated across the tracks in front of the station and commanding
the approaches to it, much as the pilot-house of an American steamer
commands a view of the course before it.From this gallery, by means
of what is known as the interlocking system, every switch and signal
in the yard below is moved; and to such a point of perfection has
the apparatus been carried, that any disaster from the misplacement
of a switch or the display of a wrong signal is rendered impossible.Of this Cannon street apparatus Barry says, "there are here nearly
seventy point and signal levers concentrated in one signal house;
the number of combinations which would be possible if all the
signal and point levers were not interlocked can be expressed only
by millions.Of these only 808 combinations are safe, and by the
interlocking apparatus these 808 combinations are rendered possible,
and all the others impossible."[17]

  [17] _Railway Appliances_, p.It is not proposed to enter at any length into the mechanical
details of this appliance, which, however, must be considered as one
of the three or four great inventions which have marked epochs in
the history of railroad traffic.[18] As, however, it is but little
known in America, and will inevitably within the next few years find
here the widest field for its increased use, a slight sketch of its
gradual development and of its leading mechanical features may not
be out of place.Prior to the year 1846 the switches and signals
on the English roads were worked in the same way that they are now
commonly worked in this country.As a train drew near to a junction,
for instance, the switchman stationed there made the proper track
connection and then displayed the signal which indicated what tracks
were opened and what closed, and which line had the right of way;
and the engine-drivers acted accordingly.As the number of trains
increased and the movement at the junctions became more complicated,
the danger of the wrong switches being thrown or the wrong signals
displayed, increased also.Mistakes from time to time would happen,
even when only the most careful and experienced men were employed;
and mistakes in these matters led to serious consequences.It,
therefore, became the practice, instead of having the switch or
signal lever at the point where the switch or signal itself was, as
is still almost universally the case in this country, to connect
them by rods or wires with their levers, which were concentrated
at some convenient point for working, and placed under the control
of one man instead of several.So far as it went this change was
an improvement, but no provision yet existed against the danger of
mistake in throwing switches and displaying signals.The blunder of
first making one combination of tracks and then showing the signal
for another was less liable to happen after the concentration of
the levers under one hand than before, but it still might happen at
any time, and certainly would happen at some time.If all danger of
accident from human fallibility was ever to be eliminated a far more
complicated mechanical apparatus must be devised.In response to
this need the system of interlocking was gradually developed, though
not until about the year 1856 was it brought to any considerable
degree of perfection.The whole object of this system is to
render it impossible for a switchman, whether because he is weary
or agitated or actually malicious or only inexperienced, to give
contrary signals, or to break his line in one way and to give the
signal for its being broken in another way.To bring this about the
levers are concentrated in a cabin or gallery, and placed side by
side in a frame, their lower ends connecting with the switch-points
and signals by means of rods and wires.Beneath this frame are one
or more long bars, extending its entire length under it and parallel
with it.These are called locking bars; for, being moved to the
right or left by the action of the levers they hold these levers in
certain designated positions, nor do they permit them to occupy any
other.In this way what is termed the interlocking is effected.The
apparatus, though complicated, is simplicity itself compared with
a clock or a locomotive.The complication, also, such as it is,
arises from the fact that each situation is a problem by itself, and
as such has to be studied out and provided for separately.This,
however, is a difficulty affecting the manufacturer rather than the
operator.To the latter the apparatus presents no difficulty which
a fairly intelligent mechanic cannot easily master; while for the
former the highly complicated nature of the problem may, perhaps,
best be inferred from the example given by Mr.Barry, the simplest
that can offer, that of an ordinary junction where a double-track
branch-road connects with its double-track main line.There would
in this case be of necessity two switch levers and four signal
levers, which would admit of sixty-four possible combinations."The
signal might be arranged in any of sixteen ways, and the points
might occupy any of four positions, irrespective of the position
of the signals.Of the sixty-four combinations thus possible
only thirteen are safe, and the rest are such as might lure an
engine-driver into danger."[18] A sufficiently popular description of this apparatus also,
  illustrated by cuts, will be found in Barry's excellent little
  treatise on _Railway Appliances_, already referred to, published by
  Longmans & Co.as one of their series of text-books of science.Originally the locking bar was worked through the direct action of
certain locks, as they were called, between which the levers when
moved played to and fro.These locks were mere bars or plates of
iron, some with inclined sides, and others with sides indented or
notched.At one end they were secured on a pivot to a fixed bar
opposite to and parallel with the movable locking bar, while their
other ends were made fast to the locking bar; whence it necessarily
followed that, as certain of the levers were pushed to and fro
between them, the action of these levers on the inclined sides of
the locks could by a skilful combination be made to throw other
levers into the notches and indentations of other locks, thus
securing them in certain positions, and making it impossible for
them to be in any other positions.The apparatus which has been described, though a great improvement
on anything which had preceded it, was still but a clumsy affair,
and naturally the friction of the levers on the locks was so great
that they soon became worn, and when worn they could not be relied
upon to move the switch-points with the necessary accuracy.The new
appliance of safety had, therefore, as is often the case, introduced
a new and very considerable danger of its own.The signals and
switches, it was true, could no longer disagree, but the points
themselves were sometimes not properly set, or, owing to the great
exertion required to work it, the interlocking gear was strained.This difficulty resulted in the next and last improvement, which
was a genuine triumph of mechanical ingenuity.To insure the proper
length of stroke being made in moving the lever--that is to make
it certain in each case that the switch points were brought into
exactly the proper position--two notches were provided in the slot,
or quadrant, as it is called, in which the lever moved, and, when
it was thrown squarely home, and not until then, a spring catch
caught in one or other of these notches.This spring was worked by
a clasp at the handle of the lever, and the whole was called the
spring catch-rod.By a singularly ingenious contrivance, the process
of interlocking was transferred from the action of the levers and
the keys to these spring catch-rods, which were made to work upon
each other, and thus to become the medium through which the whole
process is effected.The result of this improvement was that, as
the switchman cannot move any lever until the spring-catch rod is
fastened, except for a particular movement, he cannot, do what he
will, even begin any other movement than that one, as the levers
cannot be started.On the other hand, it may be said that, by means
of this improvement, the mere "intention of the signal-man to move
any lever, expressed by his grasping the lever and so raising the
spring catch-rod, independently of his putting his intention in
force, actuates all the necessary locking.[19]"

  [19] In regard to the interlocking system as then in use in England,
  Captain Tyler in his report as head of the railway inspecting
  department of the Board of Trade, used the following language in
  his report on the accidents during 1870."When the apparatus is
  properly constructed and efficiently maintained, the signalman
  cannot make a mistake in the working of his points and signals which
  shall lead to accident or collision, except only by first lowering
  his signal and switching his train forward, then putting up his
  signal again as it approaches, and altering the points as the driver
  comes up to, or while he is passing over them.Such a mistake was
  actually made in one of the cases above quoted.It is, of course,
  impossible to provide completely for cases of this description; but
  the locking apparatus, as now applied, is already of enormous value
  in preventing accidents; and it will have a still greater effect
  on the general safety of railway travelling as it becomes more
  extensively applied on the older lines.Without it, a signalman in
  constantly working points and signals is almost certain sooner or
  later to make a mistake, and to cause an accident of a more or less
  serious character; and it is inexcusable in any railway company to
  allow its mail or express trains to run at high speed through facing
  points which are not interlocked efficiently with the signals, by
  which alone the engine-drivers in approaching them can be guided.There is however, very much yet to be effected in different parts of
  the country in this respect.And it is worth while to record here,
  in illustration of the difficulties that are sometimes met with by
  the inspecting officers, that the Midland Railway Company formally
  protested in June, 1866, against being compelled to apply such
  apparatus before receiving sanction for the opening of new lines
  of railway.They stated that in complying with the requirements in
  this respect of the Board of Trade, they '_were acting in direct
  opposition to their own convictions, and they must, so far as lay in
  their power, decline the responsibility of the locking system_.'"To still further perfect the appliance a simple mechanism has
  since 1870 been attached to the rod actuating the switch-bolt,
  which prevents the signal-man from shifting the switch under a
  passing train in the manner suggested by Captain Tyler in the above
  extract.In fact it is no exaggeration to say that the interlocking
  system has now been so studied, and every possible contingency so
  thoroughly provided for, that in using it accidents can only occur
  through a wilful intention to bring them about.In spite of any theoretical or fanciful objections which may be
urged against it, this appliance will be found an indispensable
adjunct to any really heavy junction or terminal train movement.For
the elevated railroads of New York, for instance, its early adoption
proved a necessity.As for questions of temperature, climate,
etc., as affecting the long connecting rods and wires which are an
essential part of the system, objections based upon them are purely
imaginary.Difficulties from this source were long since met and
overcome by very simple compensating arrangements, and in practice
occasion no inconvenience.That rods may break, and that wires are
at all times liable to get out of gear, every one knows; and yet
this fact is urged as a novel objection to each new mechanical
improvement.That a broken or disordered apparatus will always
occasion a serious disturbance to any heavy train movement, may also
be admitted.The fact none the less remains that in practice, and
daily subjected through long periods of time to incomparably the
heaviest train movement known to railroad experience, the rods of
the interlocking apparatus do not break, nor do its wires get out
of gear; while by means of it, and of it alone, this train movement
goes unceasingly on never knowing any serious disturbance.[20]

  [20] "As an instance of the possibility of preventing the mistakes
  so often made by signal men with conflicting signals or with facing
  points I have shown the traffic for a single day, and at certain
  hours of that day, at the Cannon Street station of the South Eastern
  Railway, already referred to as one of the _no-accident_ lines of
  the year.The traffic of that station, with trains continually
  crossing one another, by daylight and in darkness, in fog or in
  sunshine, amounts to more than 130 trains in three hours in the
  morning, and a similar number in the evening; and, altogether, to
  652 trains, conveying more than 35,000 passengers in the day as
  a winter, or 40,000 passengers a day as a summer average.It is
  probably not too much to say, that without the signal and point
  arrangements which have there been supplied, and the system of
  interlocking which has there been so carefully carried out, the
  signalmen could not carry on their duties _for one hour without
  accident_."_Captain Tyler's report on accidents for 1870, p.35._

It is not, however, alone in connection with terminal stations and
junctions that the interlocking apparatus is of value.It is also
the scientific substitute for the law or regulation compelling
trains to stop as a measure of precaution when they approach
grade-crossings or draw-bridges.It is difficult indeed to pass from
the consideration of this fine result of science and to speak with
patience of the existing American substitute for it.If the former
is a feature in the block system, the latter is a signal example of
the block-head system.As a device to avoid danger it is a standing
disgrace to American ingenuity; and, fortunately, as stopping is
compatible only with a very light traffic, so soon as the passage
of trains becomes incessant a substitute for it has got to be
devised.In this country, as in England, that substitute will be
found in the interlocking apparatus.By means of it the draw-bridge,
for instance, can be so connected with the danger signals--which
may, if desired, be gates closing across the railroad tracks--that
the one cannot be opened except by closing the other.This is the
method adopted in Great Britain not only at draws in bridges, but
frequently also in the case of gates at level road crossings.It
has already been noticed that in Great Britain accidents at draws
in bridges seem to be unknown.Certainly not one has been reported
during the last nine years.The security afforded in this case
by interlocking would, indeed, seem to be absolute; as, if the
apparatus is out of order, either the gates or the bridge would be
closed, and could not be opened until it was repaired.So also as
respects the grade-crossing of one railroad by another.Bringing
all trains to a complete stop when approaching these crossings
is a precaution quite generally observed in America, either as a
matter of statute law or running regulation; and yet during the six
years 1873-8 no less than 104 collisions were reported at these
crossings.In Great Britain during the nine years 1870-8 but nine
cases of accidents of this description were reported, and in both
the years 1877 and 1878 under the head of "Accidents or Collisions
on Level Crossings of Railways," the chief inspector of the Board
of Trade tersely stated that,--"No accident was inquired into under
this head.[21]" The interlocking system there affords the most
perfect protection which can be devised against a most dangerous
practice in railroad construction to which Americans are almost
recklessly addicted.It is, also, matter of daily experience that
the interlocking system does afford a perfect practical safeguard
in this case.Every junction of a branch with a double track
road involves a grade-crossing, and a grade-crossing of the most
dangerous character.On the Metropolitan Elevated railroad of New
York, at 53d street, there is one of these junctions, where, all
day long, trains are crossing at grade at the rate of some twenty
miles an hour.These trains never stop, except when signalled so
to do.The interlocking apparatus, however, makes it impossible
that one track should be open except when the other is closed.An
accident, therefore, can happen only through the wilful carelessness
of the engineer in charge of a train;--and in the face of wilful
carelessness laws are of no more avail than signals.If a man in
control of a locomotive wishes to bring on a collision he can always
do it.Unless he wishes to, however, the interlocking apparatus
not only can prevent him from so doing, but as a matter of fact
always does.The same rule which holds good at junctions would hold
good at level crossings.There is no essential difference between
the two.By means of the interlocking apparatus the crossing can
be so blocked at any desired distance from it in such a way that
when one track is open the other must be closed;--unless, indeed,
the apparatus is out of order, and then both would be closed.The precaution in this case, also, is absolute.Unlike the rule
as to stopping, it does not depend on the caution or judgment of
individuals;--there are the signals and the obstructions, and
if they are not displayed on one road they are on the other.So
superior is this apparatus in every respect--as regards safety as
well as convenience--to the precaution of coming to a stop, that, as
an inducement to introduce an almost perfect scientific appliance,
it would be very desirable that states like Massachusetts and
Connecticut compelling the stop, should except from the operation
of the law all draw-bridges or grade-crossings at which suitable
interlocking apparatus is provided.Surely it is not unreasonable
that in this case science should have a chance to assert itself.[21] "As affecting the safe working of railways, the level crossing
  of one railway by another is a matter of very serious import.Even when signalled on the most approved principles, they are a
  source of danger, and, if possible, should always be avoided.At
  junctions of branch or other railways the practice has been adopted
  by some companies in special cases, to carry the off line under or
  over the main line by a bridge.This course should generally be
  adopted in the case of railways on which the traffic is large, and
  more expressly where express and fast trains are run."_Report on
  Accidents on Railways of the United Kingdom during 1877, p.35._

In any event, however, the general introduction of the interlocking
apparatus into the American railroad system may be regarded as a
mere question of the value of land and concentration of traffic.So long as every road terminating in our larger cities indulges,
at whatever unnecessary cost to its stockholders, in independent
station buildings far removed from business centres, the train
movement can most economically be conducted as it now is.The
expense of the interlocking apparatus is avoided by the very simple
process of incurring the many fold heavier expense of several
station buildings and vast disconnected station grounds.If,
however, in the city of Boston, for instance, the time should come
when the financial and engineering audacity of the great English
companies shall be imitated,--when some leading railroad company
shall fix its central passenger station on Tremont street opposite
the head of Court street, just as in London the South Eastern
established itself on Cannon street, and then this company carrying
its road from Pemberton Square by a tunnel under Beacon Hill and the
State-house should at the crossing of the Charles radiate out so as
to afford all other roads an access for their trains to the same
terminal point, thus concentrating there the whole daily movement of
that busy population which makes of Boston its daily counting-room
and market-place,--then, when this is attempted, the time will have
come for utilizing to its utmost capacity every available inch of
space to render possible the incessant passage of trains.Then also
will it at last be realized that it is far cheaper to use a costly
and intricate apparatus which enables two companies to be run into
one convenient station, than it is to build a separate station, even
at an inconvenient point, to accommodate each company.In March, 1825, there appeared in the pages of the _Quarterly
Review_ an article in which the writer discussed that railway
system, the first vague anticipation of which was then just
beginning to make the world restless.He did this, too, in a very
intelligent and progressive spirit, but unfortunately secured for
his article a permanence of interest he little expected by the
use of one striking illustration.He was peculiarly anxious to
draw a distinct line of demarcation between his own very rational
anticipations and the visionary dreams of those enthusiasts who
were boring the world to death over the impossibilities which they
claimed that the new invention was to work.Among these he referred
to the proposition that passengers would be "whirled at the rate
of eighteen or twenty miles an hour by means of a high pressure
engine," and then contemptuously added,--"We should as soon expect
the people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be fired off upon one
of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as trust themselves to the mercy
of such a machine, going at such a rate; their property perhaps they
may trust."Under the circumstances, the criticism was a perfectly reasonable
one.The danger involved in going at such a rate of speed and the
impossibility of stopping in time to avoid a sudden danger, would
naturally suggest themselves to any one as insuperable objections
to the new system for any practical use.Some means of preserving
a sudden and powerful control over a movement of such unheard of
rapidity would almost as a matter of course be looked upon as a
condition precedent.Yet it is a most noticeable fact in the history
of railroad development that the improvement in appliances for
controlling speed by no means kept pace with the increased rate of
speed attained.Indeed, so far as the possibility of rapid motion
is concerned, there is no reason to suppose that the _Rocket_
could not have held its own very respectably by the side of a
passenger locomotive of the present day.It will be remembered
that on the occasion of the Manchester & Liverpool opening, Mr.Huskisson after receiving his fatal injury was carried seventeen
miles in twenty-five minutes.Since then the details of locomotive
construction have been simplified and improved upon, but no great
change has been or probably will be effected in the matter of
velocity;--as respects that the maximum was practically reached
at once.Yet down to the year 1870 the brake system remained very
much what it was in 1830.Improvements in detail were effected,
but the essential principles were the same.In case of any sudden
emergency, the men in charge of the locomotive had no direct control
over the vehicles in the train; they communicated with them by the
whistle, and when the signal was heard the brakes were applied as
soon as might be.When a train is moving at the rate of forty miles
an hour, by no means a great speed for it while in full motion, it
passes over fifty-eight feet each second;--at sixty miles an hour it
passes over eighty-eight feet.Under these circumstances, supposing
an engine driver to become suddenly aware of an obstruction on the
track, as was the case at Revere, or of something wrong in the train
behind him, as at Shipton, he had first himself to signal danger,
and to this signal the brakemen throughout the train had to respond.Each operation required time, and every second of time represented
many feet of space.It was small matter for surprise, therefore,
that when in 1875 they experimented scientifically in England, it
was ascertained that a train of a locomotive and thirteen cars
moving at a speed of forty-five miles an hour could not be brought
to a stand in less than one minute, or before it had traversed a
distance of half a mile.The same result it will be remembered was
arrived at by practical experience in America, where both at Angola
and at Port Jervis,[22] it was found impossible to stop the trains
in less than half-a-mile, though in each case two derailed cars were
dragging and plunging along at the end of them.[22] _Ante_, pp.The need of a continuous train-brake, operated from the locomotive
and under the immediate control of the engine-driver, had been
emphasized through years by the almost regular recurrence of
accidents of the most appalling character.In answer to this need
almost innumerable appliances had been patented and experimented
with both in Europe and in America.Prior to 1869, however,
these had been almost exclusively what are known as emergency
brakes;--that is, although the trains were equipped with them and
they were operated from the locomotives, they were not relied upon
for ordinary use, but were held in reserve, as it were, against
special exigencies.The Hudson River railroad train at the Hamburg
accident was thus equipped.Practically, appliances which in the
operation of railroads are reserved for emergencies are usually
found of little value when the emergency occurs.Accordingly no
continuous brake had, prior to the development of Westinghouse's
invention, worked its way into general use.Patent brakes had
become a proverb as well as a terror among railroad mechanics,
and they had ceased to believe that any really desirable thing of
the sort would ever be perfected.Westinghouse, therefore, had a
most unbelieving audience to encounter, and his invention had to
fight hard for all the favor it won; nor did his experience with
master mechanics differ, probably, much from Miller's.His first
patents were taken out in 1869, and he early secured the powerful
aid of the Pennsylvania road for his invention.The Pullman Car
Company, also, always anxious to avail themselves of every appliance
of safety as well as of comfort, speedily saw the merits of the
new brake and adopted it; but, as they merely furnished cars and
had nothing to do with the locomotives that pulled them, their
support was not so effective as that of the great railroad company.Naturally enough, also, great hesitation was felt in adopting so
complicated an appliance.It added yet another whole apparatus to
a thing which was already overburdened with machinery.There was,
also, something in the delicacy and precision of the parts of this
new contrivance,--in its air-pump and reservoirs and long connecting
tubes with their numerous valves,--which was peculiarly distasteful
to the average practical railroad mechanic.It was true that the
idea of transmitting power by means of compressed air was by no
means new,--that thousands of drills were being daily driven by
it wherever tunnelling was going on or miners were at work,--yet
the application of this familiar power to the wheels of a railroad
train seemed no less novel than it was bold.It was, in the first
place, evident that the new apparatus would not stand the banging
and hammering to which the old-fashioned hand-brake might safely
be subjected; not indeed without deranging that simple appliance,
but without incurring any very heavy bill for repairs in so doing.Accordingly the new brake was at first carelessly examined and
patronizingly pushed aside as a pretty toy,--nice in theory no
doubt, but wholly unfitted for rough, every-day use.As it was
tersely expressed during a discussion before the Society of Arts
in London, as recently as May, 1877,--"It was no use bringing out
a brake which could not be managed by ordinary officials,--which
was so wonderfully clever that those who had to use it could not
understand it."A line of argument by the way, which, as has been
already pointed out, may with far greater force be applied to the
locomotive itself; and, indeed, unquestionably was so applied
about half a century ago by men of the same calibre who apply it
now, to the intense weariness and discouragement no doubt of the
late George Stephenson.Whether sound or otherwise, however, few
more effective arguments against an appliance can be advanced; and
against the Westinghouse brake it was advanced so effectively,
that even as late as 1871, although largely in use on western
roads, it had found its way into Massachusetts only as an ingenious
device of doubtful merit.It was in August, 1871, that the Revere
disaster occurred, and the Revere disaster, as has been seen,
would unquestionably have been averted had the colliding train
been provided with proper brake power.This at last called serious
attention there to the new appliance.Even then, however, the mere
suggestion of something better being in existence than the venerable
hand-brakes in familiar use did not pass without a vigorous protest;
and at the meeting of railroad officials, which has already been
referred to as having been called by the state commissioners
after the accident, one prominent gentleman, when asked if the
road under his charge was equipped with the most approved brake,
indignantly replied that it was,--that it was equipped with the
good, old-fashioned hand-brake;--and he then proceeded to vehemently
stake his professional reputation on the absolute superiority of
that ancient but somewhat crude appliance over anything else of the
sort in existence.Nevertheless, on this occasion also, the great
dynamic force which is ever latent in first-class railroad accidents
again asserted itself.Even the most opinionated of professional
railroad men, emphatically as he might in public deny it, quietly
yielded as soon as might be.In a surprisingly short time after the
exhibition of ignorance which has been referred to, the railroads in
Massachusetts, as it has already been shown, were all equipped with
train-brakes.[23]

  [23] Page 157.In its present improved shape it is safe to say that in all those
requisites which the highest authorities known on the subject have
laid down as essential to a model train brake, the Westinghouse
stands easily first among the many inventions of the kind.It is
now a much more perfect appliance than it was in 1871, for it was
then simply atmospheric and continuous in its action, whereas it
has since been made automatic and self-regulating.So far as its
fundamental principle is concerned, that is too generally understood
to call for explanation.By means of an air-pump, attached to the
boiler of the locomotive and controlled by the engine-driver, an
atmospheric force is brought to bear, through tubes running under
the cars, upon the break blocks, pressing them against the wheels.The hand of the engine-driver is in fact on every wheel in the
train.This application of power, though unquestionably ingenious
and, like all good things, most simple and obvious when once
pointed out, was originally open to one great objection, which was
persistently and with great force urged against it.The parts of the
apparatus were all delicate, and some injury or derangement of them
was always possible, and sometimes inevitable.The chief advantage
claimed for the brake was, however, that complete dependence could
be placed upon it in the regular movement of trains.It was obvious,
therefore, that if such dependence was placed upon it and any
derangement did occur, the first intimation those in charge of the
train would have that something was wrong might well come in the
shape of a failure of the brake to act, and a subsequent disaster.Both in Massachusetts and in Connecticut, at the crossing of one
railroad by another at the same level in the former state and in the
approach to draws in bridges in the latter, a number of cases of
this failure of the original Westinghouse non-automatic brake to act
did in point of fact occur.Fortunately they, none of them, resulted
in disaster.This, however, was mere good luck, as was illustrated
in the case of the accident of November 11, 1876, at the Communipaw
Ferry on the New Jersey Central.The train was there equipped with
the ordinary train brake.It reached Jersey City on time shortly
after 4 P.M., but, instead of slacking up, it ran directly through
the station and freight offices, carrying away the walls and
supports, and the locomotive then plunged into the river beyond.The baggage and smoking car followed but fortunately lodged on the
locomotive, thus blocking the remainder of the train.Fortunately no
one was killed, and no passengers were seriously injured.Again, on the Metropolitan Elevated railroad in New York city, on
the evening of June 23, 1879, one of the trains was delayed for a
few moments at the Franklin street station.Meanwhile the next train
came along, and, though the engine-driver of this following train
saw the danger signals and endeavored to stop in time, he found his
brake out of order, and a collision ensued resulting in the injury
of one employé and the severe shattering of a passenger coach and
locomotive.It was only a piece of good fortune that the first
of these accidents did not result in a repetition of the Norwalk
disaster and the second in that of Revere.It so chanced that it was the Smith vacuum brake which failed to
work at Communipaw, and the Eames vacuum which failed to work at
Franklin street.It might just
as well have been the original Westinghouse.The difficulty lay, not
in the maker's name, but in the imperfect action of the brake; and
such significant intimations are not to be disregarded.The chances
are naturally large that the failure of the continuous brake to act
will not at once occur under just those circumstances which will
entail a serious disaster and heavy loss of life; that, however, if
such intimations as these are disregarded, it will sooner or later
so occur does not admit of doubt.But the possibility that upon some given occasion it might fail to
work was not the only defect in the original Westinghouse; it might
well be in perfect order and in full action even, and then suddenly,
as the result of derailment or separation of parts, the apparatus
might be broken, and at once the shoes would drop from the wheels,
and the vehicles of the disabled train would either press forward,
or, on an incline, stop and run backwards until their unchecked
momentum was exhausted.This appears to have been the case at
Wollaston, and contributed some of its most disastrous features to
that accident.To obviate these defects Westinghouse in 1872 invented what he
termed a triple valve attachment, by means of which, if the
thing can be so expressed, his brake was made to always stand at
danger.That is, in case of any derangement of its parts, it was
automatically applied and the train stopped.The action of the brake
was thus made to give notice of anything wrong anywhere in the
train.A noticeable case of this occurred on the Midland railway in
England, when on the November 22, 1876, as the Scotch express was
approaching the Heeley station, at a speed of some sixty miles an
hour, the hind-guard felt the automatic brake suddenly self-applied.The forward truck of a Pullman car in the middle of the train had
left the rails; the front part of the train broke the couplings
and went on, while the rear carriages, acted upon by the automatic
brakes, came to a stand immediately behind the Pullman, which
finally rested on its side across the opposite track.On the other hand, as the Scotch express on the
North Eastern road was approaching Morpeth, on March 25, 1877, at
a speed of some twenty-five miles an hour, the locomotive for some
reason left the track.The train was not equipped with an automatic
brake, and the carriages in it accordingly pressed forward upon
each other until three of them were so utterly destroyed as to be
indistinguishable.Five passengers lost their lives; the remains of
one of whom, together with the wheels of a carriage, were afterwards
taken out from the tank of the tender, into which they had been
driven by the force of the shock.The theoretical objection to the automatic brake is obvious.In
case of any derangement of its machinery it applies itself, and,
should these derangements be of frequent occurrence, the consequent
stoppage of trains would prove a great annoyance, if not a source
of serious danger.This objection is not sustained by practical
experience.The triple valve, so called, is the only complicated
portion of the automatic brake, and this valve is well protected
and not liable to get out of order.[24] Should it become deranged
it will stop the working of the brake on that car alone to which it
belongs; and it will become deranged so as to set the brake only
from causes which would render the non-automatic brake inoperative.When anything of this sort occurs, it stops the train until the
defect is remedied.The returns made to the English Board of
Trade enable us to know just how frequently in actual and regular
service these stoppages occur, and what they amount to.Take, for
instance, the North Eastern and the Caledonian railways.During the last six months of 1878 the first
ran 138,000 train miles with it, in the course of which there
were eight delays or stoppages of some three to five minutes each
occasioned by the action of the triple-valve; being in round numbers
one occasion of delay in 17,000 miles of train movement.On the
Caledonian railway, during the same period, four brake failures, due
to the action of the triple-valve, were reported in runs aggregating
over 62,000 miles, being about one failure to 15,000 miles.These
failures moreover occasioned delays of only a few minutes each, and,
where the cause of the difficulty was not so immediately apparent
that it could at once be remedied, the brake-tubes of the vehicle
on which the difficulty occurred were disconnected, and the trains
went on.[25] One of these stoppages, however, resulted in a serious
accident.As a train on the Caledonian road was approaching the
Wemyss Bay junction on December 14th, in a dense fog, the engine
driver, seeing the signals at danger, undertook to apply his brake
slightly, when it went full on, stopping the train between the
distant and home signals, as they are called in the English block
system.After the danger signal was lowered, but before the brake
could be released, the signal-man allowed a following train to enter
upon the same block section, and a collision followed in which some
thirteen passengers were slightly injured.This accident, however,
as the inspecting officer of the Board of Trade very properly found,
was due not at all to the automatic brake, but to "carelessness
on the part of the signal-man, who disregarded the rules for the
working of the block telegraph instruments," and to the driver
of the colliding train, who "disobeyed the company's running
regulations."It gives an American, however, a realizing sense of
one of the difficulties under which those crowded British lines are
operated, to read that in this case the fog was "so thick that the
tail-lamp was not visible from an approaching train for more than a
few yards."[24] Speaking of the modifications introduced into his brake by
  Westinghouse since 1874, Mr.Thomas E. Harrison, civil engineer
  of the North Eastern Railway Company in a communication to the
  directors of that company of April 24, 1879, recommending the
  adoption by it of the Westinghouse, and subsequently ordered to
  be printed for the use of Parliament, thus referred to the triple
  valve: "As the most important [of these modifications] I will
  particularly draw your attention to the "triple-valve" which has
  been made a regular bugbear by the opponents of the system, and has
  been called complicated, delicate, and liable to get out of order,
  etc.* * * It is, in fact, as simple a piece of mechanism as well
  can be imagined, certain in its action, of durable materials, easily
  accessible to an ordinary workman for examination or cleaning, and
  there is nothing about it that can justify the term complication; on
  the contrary, it is a model of ingenuity and simplicity."[25] During the six months ending June 30, 1879, some 300 stops due
  to some derangement of the apparatus of the Westinghouse brake were
  reported by ten companies in runs aggregating about two million
  miles.Being one stop to 6,600 miles run.Very many of these stops
  were obviously due to the want of familiarity of the employés with
  an apparatus new to them, but as a rule the delays occasioned did
  not exceed a very few minutes; of 82 stoppages, for instance,
  reported on the London, Brighton & South Coast road, the two longest
  were ten minutes each and the remainder averaged some three or four
  minutes.After the application of the triple valve had made it automatic,
there remained but one further improvement necessary to render
the Westinghouse a well-nigh perfect brake.A superabundance of
self-acting power had been secured, but no provision was yet made
for graduating the use of that power so that it should be applied
in the exact degree, neither more nor less, which would soonest
stop the train.This for two reasons is mechanically a matter of
no little importance.As is well known a too severe application of
brakes, no matter of what kind they are, causes the wheels to stand
still and slide upon the rails.This is not only very injurious to
rolling stock, the wheels of which are flattened at the points which
slide, but, as has long been practically well-known to those whose
business it is to run locomotives, when once the wheels begin to
slide the retarding power of the brakes is seriously diminished.In order, therefore, to secure the maximum of retarding power, the
pressure of the brake-blocks on the revolving wheels should be very
great when first applied, and just sufficient not to slide them; and
should then be diminished, _pari passu_ with the momentum of the
train, until it wholly stops.Familiar as all this has long been
to engine-drivers and practical railroad mechanics, yet it has not
been conceded in the results of many scientific inquiries.In the
report of one of the Royal Commissions on Accidents, for instance,
it was asserted that the momentum of a train was retarded more by
the action of sliding than of slowly revolving wheels; and again,
as recently as in May, 1877, in a scientific discussion in London
at one of the meetings of the Society of Arts, a gentleman, with
the letters C. E. appended to his name, ventured the surprising
assertion that "no brake could do more than skid the wheels of
a train, and all continuous brakes professed to do this, and he
believed did so about equally well."Now, what it is here asserted
no brake can do is exactly what the perfect brake will be made to
do,--and what Westinghouse's latest improvement, it is claimed,
enables his brake to do.It much more than "skids the wheels," by
measuring out exactly that degree of power necessary to hold the
wheels just short of the skidding point, and in this way always
exerts the maximum retarding force.This is brought about by means
of a contrivance which allows the air to leak out of the brake
cylinders so as to exactly proportion the pressure of the blocks
on the wheels to the speed with which the latter are revolving.In other, and more scientific, language the force with which the
brake-blocks are pressed upon the wheels is made to adjust itself
automatically as the "coefficient of dynamic friction augments with
the reduction of train speed."It hardly needs to be said that in
this way the power of the brake is enormously increased.In America the superiority of the Westinghouse over any other
description of train-brake has long been established through that
large preponderance of use which in such matters constitutes the
final and irreversible verdict.[26] In Europe, however, and
especially in Great Britain, ever since the Shipton-on-Cherwell
accident in 1874, the battle of the brakes, as it may not
inappropriately be called, has waxed hotter and hotter; and not only
has this battle been extremely interesting in a scientific way, but
it has been highly characteristic, and at times enlivened by touches
of human nature which were exceedingly amusing.[26] In Massachusetts, for instance, where no official pressure
  in favor of any particular brake was brought to bear, out of 473
  locomotives equipped with train-brakes 361 have the Westinghouse,
  which is also applied to 1,363 out of 1,669 cars.Of these, however,
  79 locomotives and 358 cars are equipped with both the atmospheric
  and the vacuum brakes.The English battle of the brakes may be said to have fairly opened
with the official report from Captain Tyler on the Shipton accident,
in reference to which he expressed the opinion, which has already
been quoted in describing the accident, that "if the train had
been fitted with continuous brakes throughout its whole length
there is no reason why it should not have been brought to rest
without any casuality."The Royal Commission on railroad accidents
then took the matter up and called for a series of scientifically
conducted experiments.These took place under the supervision of
two engineers appointed by the Commission, who were aided by a
detail of officers and men from the royal engineers.Eight brakes
competed, and a train, consisting of a locomotive and thirteen
cars, was specially prepared for each.With these trains some
seventy runs were made, and their results recorded and tabulated;
the experiments were continued through six consecutive working
days.Of the brakes experimented with three were American in their
origin,--Westinghouse's automatic and vacuum, and Smith's vacuum.The remainder were English, and were steam, hydraulic, and air
brakes; among them also was one simple emergency brake.The result
of the trials was a very decided victory for the Westinghouse
automatic, and upon its performances the Commission based its
conclusion that trains ought to be so equipped that in cases of
emergency they could be brought to rest, when travelling on level
ground at 50 miles an hour, within a distance of 275 yards; with
an allowance of distance in cases of speed greater or less than
50 miles nearly proportioned to its square.These allowances they
tabulated as follows:--

  At 60 miles per hour, stopping distance within 400 yards.
  "55        "            "           "        340   "
  "  50        "            "           "        275   "
  "  45        "            "           "        220   "
  "  40        "            "           "        180   "
  "  35        "            "           "        135   "
  "  30        "            "           "        100   "

To appreciate the enormous advance in what may be called stopping
power which these experiments revealed, it should be added that
the first series of experiments made at Newark were with trains
equipped only with the hand-brake.The average speed in these
experiments was 47 miles, and with the train-brake, according to the
foregoing tabulation, the stop should have been made in about 250
yards; in reality it was made in a little less than five times that
distance, or 1120 yards; in other words the experiments showed that
the improved appliances had more than quadrupled the control over
trains.It has already been noticed that in the cases of the Angola
and the Port Jervis disasters, as well as in that at Shipton, the
trains ran some 2,700 feet before they could be stopped.Under the
English tabulations above given, in the results of which certain
recent improvements do not enter, a train running into the 42d
Street Station in New York, at a speed of forty-five miles an hour
when under the entrance arches, would be stopped before it reached
the buffers at the end of the covered tracks.The Royal Commission experiments were followed in May and June,
1877, by yet others set on foot by the North Eastern Railway
Company for the purpose of making a competitive test of the
Westinghouse automatic and the Smith's vacuum brakes.At this trial
also the average stop at a speed of 50 miles an hour was effected
in 15 seconds, and within a distance of 650 feet.Other series
of experiments with similar results were, about the same time,
conducted under the auspices of the Belgian and German governments,
of which elaborate official reports were made.The result was that
at last, under date of August 30, 1877, the Board of Trade issued
a circular to the railway companies in which it called attention to
the fact that, notwithstanding all the discussion which had taken
place and the elaborate official trials which the government had set
on foot, there had "apparently been no attempt on the part of the
various companies to take the first step of agreeing upon what are
the requirements which, in their opinion, are essential to a good
continuous brake."In other words, the Board found that, instead of
becoming better, matters were rapidly becoming worse.Each company
was equipping its rolling stock with that appliance in which its
officers happened to be interested as owners or inventors, and when
carriages thus equipped passed from the tracks of one road onto
those of another the result was a return to the old hand-brake
system in a condition of impaired efficiency.The Board accordingly
now proceeded to narrow down the field of selection by specifying
the following as what it considered the essentials of a good
continuous brake:--

     _a._ "The brakes to be efficient in stopping trains,
     instantaneous in their actions, and capable of being applied
     without difficulty by engine-drivers or guards._b._ "In case of accident, to be instantaneously self-acting._c._ "The brakes to be put on and taken off (with facility) on
     the engine and on every vehicle of a train._d._ "The brakes to be regularly used in daily working._e._ "The materials employed to be of a durable character, so as
     to be easily maintained and kept in order."These requirements pointed about as directly as they could to the
Westinghouse, to the exclusion of all competing brakes.Not more
than one other complied with them in all respects, and many made
no pretence of complying at all.Then followed what may be termed
the battle royal of the brakes, which as yet shows no signs of
drawing to a close.As the avowed object of the Board of Trade was
to introduce, one brake, to the necessary exclusion of all others,
throughout the railroad system of Great Britain, the magnitude of
the prize was not easy to over-estimate.The weight of scientific
and official authority was decidedly in favor of the Westinghouse
automatic, but among the railroad men the Smith vacuum found
the largest number of adherents.It failed to meet three of the
requirements of the Board of Trade, in that it was neither automatic
nor instantaneous in its action, while the materials employed in
it were not of a durable character.It was, on the other hand, a
brake of unquestioned excellence, while it commended itself to the
judgment of the average railroad official by its simplicity, and to
that of the average railroad director by its apparent cheapness.Any
one could understand it, and its first cost was temptingly small.The real struggle in Great Britain, therefore, has been, and now
is, between these two brakes; and the fact that both of them are
American has been made to enter largely into it, and in a way also
which at times lent to the discussion an element of broad humor.For instance, the energetic agent of the Smith vacuum, feeling
himself aggrieved by some statement which appeared in the _Times_,
responded thereto in a circular, in the composition of which he
certainly evinced more zeal than either judgment or literary skill.This circular and its author were then referred to by the editors
of _Engineering_, a London scientific journal, in the following
slightly _de haut en bas_ style:--

     "It is not a little remarkable, and it is a fact not harmonious
     with the feelings of English engineers, that the two brakes
     recommending themselves for adoption are of American origin.* * * Now we cannot wonder, considering what our past experience
     has been in many of our dealings with Americans, that this
     feeling of distrust and prejudice exists.It is not merely
     sentimental, it is founded on many and untoward and costly
     experiences of the past, and the fear of similar experiences in
     the future.And when we see the representative of one of these
     systems adopting the traditional policy of his country, and
     meeting criticism with abuse--abuse of men pre-eminent in the
     profession, and journals which he apparently forgets are neither
     American nor venal--we do not wonder that our railway engineers
     feel a repugnance to commit themselves."The superiority of the British over the American controversialist,
as respects courtesy and restraint in language, being thus
satisfactorily established, it only remained to illustrate it.This, however, had already been done in the previous May; for at
that time it chanced that Captain Tyler, having retired from his
position at the head of the railway inspectors department of the
Board of Trade, was considering an offer which Mr.Westinghouse had
made him to associate himself with the company owning the brakes
known by that name.Before accepting this offer, Captain Tyler
took advantage of a meeting of the Society of Arts to publicly
give notice that he was considering it.This he did in a really
admirable paper on the whole subject of continuous brakes, at the
close of which a general discussion was invited and took place, and
in the course of it the innate superiority of the British over any
other kind of controversialist, so far at least as courtesy and a
delicate refraining from imputations is concerned, received pointed
illustration.Houghton, C. E., took
occasion to refer to the paper he had read as "an elaborate puff
to the Westinghouse brake, with which he [Tyler] was, as he told,
connected, or about to be."Steele proceeded to say
that:--

     "On receiving the invitation to be present at the meeting, he
     had been somewhat afraid that Captain Tyler was going to lose
     his fine character for impartiality by throwing in his lot with
     the brake-tinkers, but it came out that not only was he going to
     do that, but actually going to be a partner in a concern.* * *
     The speaker then proceeded to discuss the Westinghouse brake,
     which he called the Westinghouse and Tyler brake, designating
     it as a jack-in-the-box, a rattle trap, to please and decoy,
     and not an invention at all.No engineer had a hand in its
     manufacture.It was the discovery of some Philadelphia barber
     or some such thing.This was
     a brake which had all sorts of pretensions.It had not worked
     well, but whenever there was any row about its not working
     well, they got the papers to praise it up, and that was how the
     papers were under the thumb, and would not speak of any other.* * * He thought it would not do for railway companies to take
     a bad brake, and Captain Tyler and Mr.Westinghouse be able
     to make their fortunes by floating a limited company for its
     introduction.They had heard of Emma mines and Lisbon tramways,
     and such like, and he felt it would not be well to stand by and
     allow this to be done."All of which was not only to the point, but finely calculated to
show the American inventors and agents who were present the nice and
mutually respectful manner in which such discussions were carried on
by all Englishmen.Though the avowed adhesion of Sir Henry Tyler to the Westinghouse
was a most important move in the war of the brakes, it did not
prove a decisive one.The complete control of the field was too
valuable a property to be yielded in deference to that, or any other
name without a struggle; and, so to speak, there were altogether
too many ins and outs to the conflict.Back door influences had
everywhere to be encountered.The North Western, for instance, is
the most important of the railway companies of the United Kingdom.The locomotive superintendent of that company was the part inventor
and proprietor of an emergency brake which had been extensively
adopted by it on its rolling stock, but which wholly failed to meet
the requirements laid down in its circular by the Board of Trade.Immediately after issuing that circular the Board of Trade called
the attention of the company to this fact in connection with an
accident which had recently occurred, and in very emphatic language
pointed out that the brakes in question could not "in any reasonable
sense of the word be called continuous brakes," and that it was
clear that the circular requirements were "not complied with by the
brake-system of the London & North Western Railway Company;" in case
that company persisted in the use of that brake, the secretary of
the Board went on to say, "in the event of a casualty occurring,
which an efficient system of brakes might have prevented, a heavy
personal responsibility will rest upon those who are answerable for
such neglect."This was certainly language tolerably direct in its
import.As such it was calculated to cause those to whom it was
addressed to pause in their action.The company, however, treated it
with a superb disregard, all the more contemptuous because veiled
in language of deferential civility.They then quietly went on
applying their locomotive superintendent's emergency brake to their
equipment, until on the 30th of June, 1879, they returned no less
than 2,052 carriages fitted with it; that being by far the largest
number returned by any one company in the United Kingdom.A more direct challenge to the Board of Trade and to Parliament
could not easily have been devised.To appreciate how direct it
was, it is necessary to bear in mind that in its circular of August
30, 1877, in which the requirements of a satisfactory train-brake
were laid down, the Board of Trade threw out to the companies
the very significant hint, that they "would do well to reflect
that if a doubt should arise that from a conflict of interest or
opinion, or from any other cause, they [the companies] are not
exerting themselves, it is obvious that they will call down upon
themselves an interference which the Board of Trade, no less than
the companies, desire to avoid."In his general report on the
accidents of the year 1877, the successor of Captain Tyler expressed
the opinion that "sufficient information and experience would now
appear to be available, and the time is approaching when the railway
companies may fairly be expected to come to a decision as to which
of the systems of continuous brakes is best calculated to fulfil the
requisite conditions, and is most worthy of general adoption."At
the close of another year, however, the official returns seemed to
indicate that, while but a sixth part of the passenger locomotives
and a fifth part of the carriages in use on the railroads of the
United Kingdom were yet equipped with continuous brakes at all, a
concurrence of opinion in favor of any one system was more remote
than ever.During the six months ending December 31, 1878, but 127
additional locomotives out of about 4000, and 1,200 additional
carriages out of some 32,000 were equipped; of which 70 locomotives
and 530 carriages had been equipped with the Smith vacuum, which in
three most important respects failed to comply with the Board of
Trade requirements.Under these circumstances the Board of Trade
was obviously called upon either to withdraw from the position it
had taken, or to invite that "interference" in its support to which
in its circular of August, 1877 it had so portentously referred.It
decided to do the latter, and in March, 1879 the government gave an
intimation in the House of Lords that early Parliamentary action was
contemplated.As it is expressed, the railway companies are to "be
relieved of their indecision."In Great Britain, therefore, the long battle of the brakes would
seem to be drawing to its close.The final struggle, however,
will be a spirited one, and one which Americans will watch with
considerable interest,--for it is in fact a struggle between two
American brakes, the Westinghouse and the Smith vacuum.Of the
907 locomotives hitherto equipped with the continuous brakes no
less than 819 are equipped with one or the other of these American
patents, besides over 4,464 of the 9,919 passenger carriages.The
remaining 3,857 locomotives and 30,000 carriages are the prize of
victory.As the score now stands the vacuum brake is in almost
exactly twice the use of its more scientific rival.The weight
of authority and experience, and the requirements of the Board of
Trade, are, however, on the opposite side.As deduced from the European scientific tests and the official
returns, the balance of advantages would seem to be as follows:--In
favor of the vacuum are its superficial simplicity, and possible
economy in first cost:--In favor of the Westinghouse automatic are
its superior quickness in application, the greater rapidity in
its stopping power, the more durable nature of its materials, the
smaller cost in renewal, its less liability to derangement, and
above all its self-acting adjustment.The last is the point upon
which the final issue of the struggle must probably turn.The use
of any train-brake which is not automatic in its action, as has
already been pointed out, involves in the long run disaster,--and
ultimate serious disaster.The mere fact that the brake is generally
so reliable,--that ninety-nine times out of the hundred it works
perfectly,--simply makes disaster certain by the fatal confidence
it inspires.Ninety-nine times in a hundred the brake proves
reliable;--nine times in the remaining ten of the thousand, in which
it fails, a lucky chance averts disaster;--but the thousandth time
will assuredly come, as it did at Communipaw and on the New York
Elevated railway, and, much the worst of all yet, at Wollaston.Soon or late the use of non-automatic continuous brakes will most
assuredly, if they are not sooner abandoned, be put an end to
by the occurrence of some not-to-be forgotten catastrophe of the
first magnitude, distinctly traceable to that cause.Meanwhile that
automatic brakes are complicated and sometimes cause inconvenience
in their operation is most indisputable.This is an objection, also,
to which they are open in common with most of the riper results of
human ingenuity;--but, though sun-dials are charmingly simple, we do
not, therefore, discard chronometers in their favor; neither do we
insist on cutting our harvests with the scythe, because every man
who may be called upon to drive a mowing machine may not know how
to put one together.But what Sir Henry Tyler has said in respect
to this oldest and most fallacious, as well as most wearisome, of
objections covers the whole ground and cannot be improved upon.After referring to the fact that simplicity in construction and
simplicity in working were two different things, and that, almost
invariably, a certain degree of complication in construction is
necessary to secure simplicity in working,--after pointing this out
he went on to add that,--

     "Simplicity as regards the application of railway brakes is
     not obtained by the system now more commonly employed of
     brake-handles to be turned by different men in different
     parts of the train; but is obtained when, by more complicated
     construction an engine-driver is able easily in an instant to
     apply ample brake-power at pleasure with more or less force
     to every wheel of his train; is obtained when, every time an
     engine-driver starts, or attempts to start his train, the brake
     itself informs him if it is out of order; and is still more
     obtained when, on the occasion of an accident and the separation
     of a coupling, the brakes will unfailingly apply themselves on
     every wheel of the train without the action of the engine-driver
     or guards, [brakemen], and before even they have time to realize
     the necessity for it.This is true simplicity in such a case,
     and that system of continuous brakes which best accomplishes
     such results in the shortest space of time is so far preferable
     to all others."THE RAILROAD JOURNEY RESULTING IN DEATH.One day in May, 1847, as the Queen of Belgium was going from
Verviers to Brussels by rail, the train in which she was journeying
came into collision with another train going in the opposite
direction.There was naturally something of a panic, and, as
royalty was not then accustomed to being knocked about with
railroad equality, some of her suite urged the queen to leave the
train and to finish her journey by carriage.The contemporaneous
court reporter then went on to say, in that language which is
so peculiarly his own,--"But her Majesty, as courageously as
discreetly, declined to set that example of timidity, and she
proceeded to Brussels by the railway."In those days a very
exaggerated idea was universally entertained of the great danger
incident to travel by rail.Even then, however, had her Majesty, who
was doubtless a very sensible woman, happened to be familiar with
the statistics of injuries received by those traveling respectively
by rail and by carriage, she certainly never on any plea of danger
would have been induced to abandon her railroad train in order to
trust herself behind horse-flesh.By pursuing the course urged
upon her, the queen would have multiplied her chances of accident
some sixty fold.Strange as the statement sounds even now, such
would seem to have been the fact.In proportion to the whole number
carried, the accidents to passengers in "the good old days of
stage-coaches" were, as compared to the present time of the railroad
dispensation, about as sixty to one.This result, it is true, cannot
be verified in the experience either of England or of this country,
for neither the English nor we possess any statistics in relation
to the earlier period; but they have such statistics in France,
stretching over the space of more than forty years, and as reliable
as statistics ever are.If these French statistics hold true in New
England,--and considering the character of our roads, conveyances,
and climate, their showing is more likely to be in our favor than
against us,--if they simply hold true, leaving us to assume that
stage-coach traveling was no less safe in Massachusetts than in
France, then it would follow that to make the dangers of the rail
of the present day equal to those of the highway of half a century
back, some eighty passengers should annually be killed and some
eleven hundred injured within the limits of Massachusetts alone.These figures, however, represent rather more than fifty times the
actual average, and from them it would seem to be not unfair to
conclude that, notwithstanding the great increase of population and
the yet greater increase in travel during the last half-century,
there were literally more persons killed and injured each year in
Massachusetts fifty years ago through accidents to stage-coaches
than there are now through accidents to railroad trains.The first impression of nine out of ten persons in no way connected
with the operations of railroads would probably be found to be
the exact opposite to this.A vague but deeply rooted conviction
commonly prevails that the railroad has created a new danger;
that because of it the average human being's hold on life is more
precarious than it was.The first point-blank, bald statement to the
contrary would accordingly strike people in the light not only of a
paradox, but of a somewhat foolish one.Investigation, nevertheless,
bears it out.The fact is that when a railroad accident comes, it is
apt to come in such a way as to leave no doubt whatever in relation
to it.It is heralded like a battle or an earthquake; it fills
columns of the daily press with the largest capitals and the most
harrowing details, and thus it makes a deep and lasting impression
on the minds of many people.When a multitude of persons, traveling
as almost every man now daily travels himself, meet death in such
sudden and such awful shape, the event smites the imagination.People seeing it and thinking of it, and hearing and reading of
it, and of it only, forget of how infrequent occurrence it is.It
was not so in the olden time.Every one rode behind horses,--if not
in public then in private conveyances,--and when disaster came it
involved but few persons and was rarely accompanied by circumstances
which either struck the imagination or attracted any great public
notice.In the first place, the modern newspaper, with its perfect
machinery for sensational exaggeration, did not then exist,--having
itself only recently come in the train of the locomotive;--and, in
the next place, the circle of those included in the consequences of
any disaster was necessarily small.For
weeks and months the vast machinery moves along, doing its work
quickly, swiftly, safely; no one pays any attention to it, while
millions daily make use of it.It is as much a necessity of their
lives as the food they eat and the air they breathe.Suddenly,
somehow, and somewhere,--at Versailles, at Norwalk, at Abergele, at
New Hamburg, or at Revere,--at some hitherto unfamiliar point upon
an insignificant thread of the intricate iron web, an obstruction is
encountered, a jar, as it were, is felt, and instantly, with time
for hardly an ejaculation or a thought, a multitude of human beings
are hurled into eternity.It is no cause for surprise that such an
event makes the community in which it happens catch its breadth;
neither is it unnatural that people should think more of the few who
are killed, of whom they hear so much, than of the myriads who are
carried in safety and of whom they hear nothing.Yet it is well to
bear in mind that there are two sides to that question also, and in
no way could this fact be more forcibly brought to our notice than
by the assertion, borne out by all the statistics we possess, that,
irrespective of the vast increase in the number of those who travel,
a greater number of passengers in stage-coaches were formerly
each year killed or injured by accidents to which they in no way
contributed through their own carelessness, than are now killed
under the same conditions in our railroad cars.In other words, the
introduction of the modern railroad, so far from proportionately
increasing the dangers of traveling, has absolutely diminished them.It is not, after all, the dangers but the safety of the modern
railroad which should excite our special wonder.What is the average length of the railroad journey resulting in
death by accident to a prudent traveler?--What is the average length
of one resulting in some personal injury to him?--These are two
questions which interest every one.Few persons, probably, start
upon any considerable journey, implying days and nights on the
rail, without almost unconsciously taking into some consideration
the risks of accident.Visions of collision, derailment, plunging
through bridges, will rise unbidden.Even the old traveler who
has enjoyed a long immunity is apt at times, with some little
apprehension, to call to mind the musty adage of the pitcher and
the well, and to ask himself how much longer it will be safe for
him to rely on his good luck.A hundred thousand miles, perhaps,
and no accident yet!--Surely, on every doctrine of chances, he
now owes to fate an arm or a leg;--perhaps a life.The statistics
of a long series of years enable us, however, to approximate with
a tolerable degree of precision to an answer to these questions,
and the answer is simply astounding;--so astounding, in fact,
that, before undertaking to give it, the question itself ought to
be stated with all possible precision.It is this:--Taking all
persons who as passengers travel by rail,--and this includes all
dwellers in civilized countries,--what number of journeys of the
average length are safely accomplished, to each one which results
in the death or injury of a passenger from some cause over which he
had no control?--The cases of death or injury must be confined to
passengers, and to those of them only who expose themselves to no
unnecessary risk.When approaching a question of this sort, statisticians are apt to
assume for their answers an appearance of mathematical accuracy.It is needless to say that this is a mere affectation.The best
results which can be arrived at are, after all, mere approximations,
and they also vary greatly year by year.The body of facts from
which conclusions are to be deduced must cover not only a definite
area of space, but also a considerable lapse of time.Even Great
Britain, with its 17,000 miles of track and its hundreds of millions
of annual passenger journeys, shows results which, one year with
another, vary strangely.For instance, during the four years
anterior to 1874, but one passenger was killed, upon an average, to
each 11,000,000 carried; while in 1874 the proportion, under the
influence of a succession of disasters, suddenly doubled, rising to
one in every 5,500,000; and then again in 1877, a year of peculiar
exemption, it fell off to one in every 50,000,000.The percentage of
fatal casualties to the whole number carried was in 1847-9 five fold
what it was in 1878.If such fluctuations reveal themselves in the
statistics of Great Britain, those met with in the narrower field of
a single state in this country might well seem at first glance to
set all computation at defiance.During the ten years, for example,
between 1861 and 1870, about 200,000,000 passengers were returned
as carried on the Massachusetts roads, with 135 cases of injury to
individuals.Then came the year of the Revere disaster, and out of
26,000,000 carried, no less than 115 were killed or injured.Seven
years of comparative immunity then ensued, during which, out of
240,000,000 carried, but two were killed and forty-five injured.In other words, through a period of ten years the casualties were
approximately as one to 1,500,000; then during a single year they
rose to one in 250,000, or a seven-fold increase; and then through
a period of seven years they diminished to one in 3,400,000, a
decrease of about ninety per cent.Taking, however, the very worst of years,--the year of the
Revere disaster, which stands unparalleled in the history of
Massachusetts,--it will yet be found that the answer to the question
as to the length of the average railroad journey resulting in death
or in injury will be expressed, not in thousands nor in hundreds
of thousands of miles, but in millions.During that year some
26,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the limits of the
state, and each journey averaged a distance of about 13 miles.It
would seem, therefore, that, even in that year, the average journey
resulting in death was 11,000,000 miles, while that resulting either
in death or personal injury was not less than 3,300,000.The year 1871, however, represented by no means a fair average.On the contrary, it indicated what may fairly be considered an
excessive degree of danger, exciting nervous apprehensions in the
breasts of those even who were not constitutionally timid.To reach
what may be considered a normal average, therefore, it would be
more proper to include a longer period in the computation.Take,
for instance, the nine years, 1871-79, during which alone has
any effort been made to reach statistical accuracy in respect to
Massachusetts railroad accidents.During those nine years, speaking
in round numbers and making no pretence at anything beyond a
general approximation, some 303,000,000 passenger journeys of 13
miles each have been made on the railroads and within the state.Of these 51 have resulted in death and 308 in injuries to persons
from causes over which they had no control.The average distance,
therefore, traveled by all, before death happened to any one, was
about 80,000,000 miles, and that travelled before any one was either
injured or killed was about 10,800,000.The Revere disaster of 1871, however, as has been seen, brought
about important changes in the methods of operating the railroads
of Massachusetts.Consequently the danger incident to railroad
traveling was materially reduced; and in the next eight years
(1872-9) some 274,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the
limits of the state.The Wollaston disaster of October, 1878, was
included in this period, during which 223 persons were injured and
21 were killed.The average journey for these years resulting in any
injury to a passenger was close upon 15,000,000 miles, while that
resulting in death was 170,000,000.But it may fairly be asked,--What, after all, do these figures
mean?--They are, indeed, so large as to exceed comprehension; for,
after certain comparatively narrow limits are passed the practical
infinite is approached, and the mere adding of a few more ciphers
after a numeral conveys no new idea.On the contrary, the piling up
of figures rather tends to weaken than to strengthen a statement,
for to many it suggests an idea of ridiculous exaggeration.Indeed,
when a few years ago a somewhat similar statement to that just made
was advanced in an official report, a critic undertook to expose
the fallacy of it in the columns of a daily paper by referring to a
case within the writer's own observation in which a family of three
persons had been killed on their very first journey in a railroad
car.It is not, of course, necessary to waste time over such a
criticism as this.Railroad accidents continually take place, and
in consequence of them people are killed and injured, and of these
there may well be some who are then making their first journey by
rail; but in estimating the dangers of railroad traveling the much
larger number who are not killed or injured at all must likewise be
taken into consideration.Any person as he may be reading this page
in a railroad car may be killed or injured through some accident,
even while his eye is glancing over the figures which show how
infinitesimal his danger is; but the chances are none the less as a
million to one that any particular reader will go down to his grave
uninjured by any accident on the rail, unless it be occasioned by
his or her own carelessness.Admitting, therefore, that ill luck or hard fortune must fall to
the lot of certain unascertainable persons, yet the chances of
incurring that ill fortune are so small that they are not materially
increased by any amount of traveling which can be accomplished
within the limits of a human life.So far from exhausting a fair
average immunity from accident by constant traveling, the statistics
of Massachusetts during the last eight years would seem to indicate
that if any given person were born upon a railroad car, and remained
upon it traveling 500 miles a day all his life, he would, with
average good fortune, be somewhat over 80 years of age before he
would be involved in any accident resulting in his death or personal
injury, while he would attain the highly respectable age of 930
years before being killed.Even supposing that the most exceptional
average of the Revere year became usual, a man who was killed by
an accident at 70 years of age should, unless he were fairly to be
accounted unlucky, have accomplished a journey of some 440 miles
every day of his life, Sundays included, from the time of his birth
to that of his death; while even to have brought him within the
fair liability of any injury at all, his daily journey should have
been some 120 miles.Under the conditions of the last eight years
his average daily journey through the three score years and ten to
entitle him to be killed in an accident at the end of them would be
about 600 miles.THE RAILROAD DEATH RATE.In connection with the statistics of railroad casualties it is not
without interest to examine the general vital statistics of some
considerable city, for they show clearly enough what a large degree
of literal truth there was in the half jocose proposition attributed
to John Bright, that the safest place in which a man could put
himself was inside a first-class railroad carriage of a train in
full motion.Take the statistics of Boston, for instance, for the
year 1878.During the four years 1875-8, it will be remembered, a
single passenger only was killed on the railroads of Massachusetts
in consequence of an accident to which he by his own carelessness
in no way contributed.[27] The average number of persons annually
injured, not fatally, during those years was about five.[27] This period did not include the Wollaston disaster, as the
  Massachusetts railroad year closes on the last day of September.The
  Wollaston disaster occurred on the 8th of October, 1878, and was
  accordingly included in the next railroad year.Yet during the year 1878, excluding all cases of mere injury of
which no account was made, no less than 53 persons came to their
deaths in Boston from falling down stairs, and 37 more from falling
out of windows; seven were scalded to death in 1878 alone.In the
year 1874 seventeen were killed by being run over by teams in
the streets, while the pastime of coasting was carried on at a
cost of ten lives more.During the five years 1874-8 there were
more persons murdered in the city of Boston alone than lost their
lives as passengers through the negligence of all the railroad
corporations in the whole state of Massachusetts during the nine
years 1871-8; though in those nine years were included both the
Revere and the Wollaston disasters, the former of which resulted
in the death of 29, and the latter of 21 persons.Neither are the
comparative results here stated in any respect novel or peculiar
to Massachusetts.Years ago it was officially announced in France
that people were less safe in their own houses than while traveling
on the railroads; and, in support of this somewhat startling
proposition, statistics were produced showing fourteen cases of
death of persons remaining at home and there falling over carpets,
or, in the case of females, having their garments catch fire, to ten
deaths on the rail.Even the game of cricket counted eight victims
to the railroad's ten.It will not, of course, be inferred that the cases of death or
injury to passengers from causes beyond their control include
by any means all the casualties involved in the operation of the
railroad system.On the contrary, they include but a very small
portion of them.The experience of the Massachusetts roads during
the seven years between September 30, 1871, and September 30,
1878, may again be cited in reference to this point.During that
time there were but 52 cases of injury to passengers from causes
over which they had no control, but in connection with the entire
working of the railroad system no less than 1,900 cases of injury
were reported, of which 1,008 were fatal; an average of 144 deaths a
year.Of these cases, naturally, a large proportion were employés,
whose occupation not only involves much necessary risk, but whose
familiarity with risk causes them always to incur it even in the
most unnecessary and foolhardy manner.During the seven years 293
of them were killed and 375 were reported as injured.Nor is it
supposed that the list included by any means all the cases of injury
which occurred.About one half of the accidents to employés are
occasioned by their falling from the trains when in motion, usually
from freight trains and in cold weather, and from being crushed
between cars while engaged in coupling them together.From this last
cause alone an average of 27 casualties are annually reported.One
fact, however, will sufficiently illustrate how very difficult it is
to protect this class of men from danger, or rather from themselves.As is well known, on freight trains they are obliged to ride on the
tops of the cars; but these are built so high that their roofs come
dangerously near the bottoms of the highway bridges, which cross
the track sometimes in close proximity to each other.Accordingly
many unfortunate brakemen were killed by being knocked off the
trains as they passed under these bridges.With a view to affording
the utmost possible protection against this form of accident, a
statute was passed by the Massachusetts legislature compelling the
corporations to erect guards at a suitable distance from every
overhead bridge which was less than eighteen feet in the clear
above the track.These guards were so arranged as to swing lightly
across the tops of the cars, giving any one standing upon them a
sharp rap, warning him of the danger he was in.This warning rap,
however, so annoyed the brakemen that the guards were on a number of
the roads systematically destroyed as often as they were put up; so
that at last another law had to be passed, making their destruction
a criminal offense.The brakemen themselves resisted the attempt
to divest their perilous occupation of one of its most insidious
dangers.In this respect, however, brakemen differ in no degree from the
rest of the community.On all hands railroad accidents seem to
be systematically encouraged, and the wonder is that the list of
casualties is not larger.In Massachusetts, for instance, even in
the most crowded portions of the largest cities and towns, not
only do the railroads cross the highways at grade, but whenever new
thoroughfares are laid out the people of the neighborhood almost
invariably insist upon their crossing the railroads at a grade
and not otherwise.Not but that, upon theory and in the abstract,
every one is opposed to grade-crossings; but those most directly
concerned always claim that their particular crossing is exceptional
in character.In vain do corporations protest and public officials
argue; when the concrete case arises all neighborhoods become alike
and strenuously insist on their right to incur everlasting danger
rather than to have the level of their street broken.During the
last seven years to September 30, 1878, 191 persons have been
injured, and 98 of them fatally injured, at these crossings in
Massachusetts, and it is certain as fate that the number is destined
to annually increase.What the result in a remote future will be, it
is not now easy to forecast.One thing only would seem certain: the
time will come when the two classes of traffic thus recklessly made
to cross each other will at many points have to be separated, no
matter at what cost to the community which now challenges the danger
it will then find itself compelled to avoid.The heaviest and most regular cause of death and injury involved
in the operation of the railroad system yet remains to be referred
to; and again it is recklessness which is at the root of it, and
this time recklessness in direct violation of law.The railroad
tracks are everywhere favorite promenades, and apparently even
resting-places, especially for those who are more or less drunk.In Great Britain physical demolition by a railroad train is also a
somewhat favorite method of committing suicide, and that, too, in
the most deliberate and cool-blooded manner.Cases have not been
uncommon in which persons have been seen to coolly lay themselves
down in front of an advancing train, and very neatly effect their
own decapitation by placing their necks across the rail.In England
alone, during the last seven years, there have been no less than 280
cases of death reported under the head of suicides, or an average
of 40 each year, the number in 1878 rising to 60.In America these
cases are not returned in a class by themselves.Under the general
head of accidents to trespassers, however, that is, accidents to
men, women and children, especially the latter, illegally lying,
walking, or playing on the tracks or riding upon the cars,--under
this head are regularly classified more than one third of all
the casualties incident to working the Massachusetts railroads.During the last seven years these have amounted to an aggregate
of 724 cases of injury, no less than 494 of which were fatal.Of
course, very many other cases of this description, which were not
fatal, were never reported.And here again the recklessness of the
public has received further illustration, and this time in a very
unpleasant way.Certain corporations operating roads terminating
in Boston endeavored at one time to diminish this slaughter by
enforcing the laws against walking on railroad tracks.A few
trespassers were arrested and fined, and then the resentment of
those whose wonted privileges were thus interfered with began to
make itself felt.Obstructions were found placed in the way of night
trains.The mere attempt to keep people from risking their lives
by getting in the way of locomotives placed whole trains full of
passengers in imminent jeopardy.Undoubtedly, however, by far the most effective means of keeping
railroad tracks from becoming foot-paths, and thus at once putting
an end to the largest item in the grand total of the expenditure
of life incident to the operation of railroads, is that secured
by the Pennsylvania railroad as an unintentional corollary to its
method of ballasting.That superb organization, every detail of
whose wonderful system is a fit subject for study to all interested
in the operation of railroads, has a roadway peculiar to itself.A principal feature in this is a surface of broken stone ballast,
covering not only the space between the rails, but also the interval
between the tracks as well as the road-bed on the outside of each
track for a distance of some three feet.It resembles nothing so
much as a newly macadamized highway.That, too, is its permanent
condition.To walk on the sharp and uneven edges of this broken
stone is possible, with a sufficient expenditure of patience and
shoe-leather; but certainly no human being would ever walk there
from preference, or if any other path could be found.Not only is
it in itself, as a system of ballasting, looked upon as better than
any other, but it confounds the tramp.Its systematic adoption in
crowded, suburban neighborhoods would, therefore, answer a double
purpose.It would secure to the corporations permanent road-beds
exclusively for their own use, and obviate the necessity of arrests
or futile threats to enforce the penalties of the law against
trespassers.It seems singular that this most obvious and effective
way of putting a stop to what is both a nuisance and a danger has
not yet been resorted to by men familiar with the use of spikes and
broken glass on the tops of fences and walls.Meanwhile, taken even in its largest aggregate, the loss of life
incident to the working of the railroad system is not excessive, nor
is it out of proportion to what might reasonably be expected.It is
to be constantly borne in mind, not only that the railroad performs
a great function in modern life, but that it also and of necessity
performs it in a very dangerous way.A practically irresistible
force crashing through the busy hive of modern civilization at a
wild rate of speed, going hither and thither, across highways and
by-ways and along a path which is in itself a thoroughfare,--such an
agency cannot be expected to work incessantly and yet never to come
in contact with the human frame.Naturally, however, it might be a
very car of Juggernaut.Is it so in fact?--To demonstrate that it
is not, it is but necessary again to recur to the comparison between
the statistics of railroad accidents and those which necessarily
occur in the experience of all considerable cities.Take again those
of Boston and of the railroad system of Massachusetts.These for the
purpose of illustration are as good as any, and in their results
would only be confirmed in the experience of Paris as compared with
the railroad system of France, or in that of London as compared with
the railroad system of Great Britain.During the eight years between
September 30, 1870, and September 30, 1878, the entire railroad
system of Massachusetts was operated at a cost of 1,165 lives, apart
from all cases of injury which did not prove fatal.The returns in
this respect also may be accepted as reasonably accurate, as the
deaths were all returned, though the cases of merely personal injury
probably were not.During the ten
years, 1868-78, 2,587 cases of death from accidental causes, or 259
a year, were recorded as having taken place in the city of Boston.In other words, the annual average of deaths by accident in the city
of Boston alone exceeds that consequent on running all the railroads
of the state by eighty per cent.Unless, therefore, the railroad
system is to be considered as an exception to all other functions of
modern life, and as such is to be expected to do its work without
injury to life or limb, this showing does not constitute a very
heavy indictment against it.AMERICAN AS COMPARED WITH FOREIGN RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.Up to this point, the statistics and experience of Massachusetts
only have been referred to.This is owing to the fact that the
railroad returns of that state are more carefully prepared and
tabulated than are those of any other state, and afford, therefore,
more satisfactory data from which to draw conclusions.The
territorial area from which the statistics are in this case derived
is very limited, and it yet remains to compare the results deduced
from them with those derived from the similar experience of other
communities.This, however, is not an easy thing to do; and, while
it is difficult enough as respects Europe, it is even more difficult
as respects America taken as a whole.This last fact is especially
unfortunate in view of the circumstance that, in regard to railway
accidents, the United States, whether deservedly or not, enjoy a
most undesirable reputation.Foreign authorities have a way of
referring to our "well-known national disregard of human life," with
a sort of complacency, at once patronizing and contemptuous, which
is the reverse of pleasing.Judging by the tone of their comments,
the natural inference would be that railroad disasters of the worst
description were in America matters of such frequent occurrence
as to excite scarcely any remark.As will presently be made very
apparent, this impression, for it is only an impression, can, so
far as the country as a whole is concerned, neither be proved nor
disproved, from the absence of sufficient data from which to argue.As respects Massachusetts, however, and the same statement may
perhaps be made of the whole belt of states north of the Potomac and
the Ohio, there is no basis for it.There is no reason to suppose
that railroad traveling is throughout that region accompanied by any
peculiar or unusual degree of danger.The great difficulty, just referred to, in comparing the results
deduced from equally complete statistics of different countries,
lies in the variety of the arbitrary rules under which the
computations in making them up are effected.As an example in
point, take the railroad returns of Great Britain and those of
Massachusetts.They are in each case prepared with a great deal
of care, and the results deduced from them may fairly be accepted
as approximately correct.As respects accidents, the number of
cases of death and of personal injury are annually reported, and
with tolerable completeness, though in the latter respect there is
probably in both cases room for improvement.The whole comparison
turns, however, on the way in which the entire number of passengers
annually carried is computed.In Great Britain, for instance, in
1878, these were returned, using round numbers only, at 565,000,000,
and in Massachusetts at 34,000,000.By dividing these totals by
the number of cases of death and injury reported as occurring
to passengers from causes beyond their control, we shall arrive
apparently at a fair comparative showing as to the relative safety
of railroad traveling in the two communities.The result for that
particular year would have been that while in Great Britain one
passenger in each 23,500,000 was killed, and one in each 481,600
injured from causes beyond their control, in Massachusetts none
were killed and only one in each 14,000,000 was in any way injured.Unfortunately, however, a closer examination reveals a very great
error in the computation, affecting every comparative result drawn
from it.In the English returns no allowance whatever is made
for the very large number of journeys made by season-ticket or
commutation passengers, while in Massachusetts, on the contrary,
each person of this class enters into the grand total as making two
trips each day, 156 trips on each quarterly ticket, and 626 trips on
each annual.Now in 1878 more than 418,000 holders of season tickets
were returned by the railway companies of Great Britain.How many
of these were quarterly and how many were annual travelers, does not
appear.If they were all annual travelers, no less than 261,000,000
journeys should be added to the 565,000,000 in the returns, in order
to arrive at an equal basis for a comparison between the foreign
and the American roads: this method, however, would be manifestly
inaccurate, so it only remains, in the absence of all reliable data,
and for the purpose of comparison solely, to strike out from the
Massachusetts returns the 8,320,727 season-ticket passages, which at
once reduces by over 3,000,000 the number of journeys to each case
of injury.As season-ticket passengers do travel and are exposed to
danger in the same degree as trip-ticket passengers, no result is
approximately accurate which leaves them out of the computation.At
present, however, the question relates not to the positive danger or
safety of traveling by rail, but to its relative danger in different
communities.Allowance for this discrepancy can, however, be made by adding to
the English official results an additional nineteen per cent., that,
according to the returns of 1877 and 1878, being the proportion
of the season-ticket to other passengers on the roads of Great
Britain.Taking then the Board of Trade returns for the eight
years 1870-7, it will be found that during this period about one
passenger in each 14,500,000 carried in that country has been killed
in railroad accidents, and about one in each 436,000 injured.This may be assumed as a fair average for purpose of comparison,
though it ought to be said that in Great Britain the percentage of
casualties to passengers shows a decided tendency to decrease, and
during the years 1877-8 the percentages of killed fell from one in
15,000,000 to one in 38,000,000 and those of injured from one in
436,000 to one in 766,000.The aggregates from which these results
are deduced are so enormous, rising into the thousands of millions,
that a certain degree of reliance can be placed on them.In the
case of Massachusetts, however, the entire period during which the
statistics are entitled to the slightest weight includes only eight
years, 1872-9, and offers an aggregate of but 274,000,000 journeys,
or but about forty per cent.of those included in the British
returns of the single year 1878.During these years the killed in
Massachusetts were one in each 13,000,000 and the injured one in
each 1,230,000;--or, while the killed in the two cases were very
nearly in the same proportion,--respectively one in 14.5, and one in
13, speaking in millions,--the British injured were really three to
one of the Massachusetts.The equality as respects the killed in this comparison, and the
marked discrepancy as respects the injured is calculated at first
sight to throw doubts on the fullness of the Massachusetts returns.There seems no good reason why the injured should in the one case
be so much more numerous than in the other.This, however, is
susceptible on closer examination of a very simple and satisfactory
explanation.In case of accident the danger of sustaining slight
personal injury is not so great in Massachusetts as in Great
Britain.This is due to the heavier and more solid construction
of the American passenger coaches, and their different interior
arrangement.This fact, and the real cause of the large number of
slightly injured,--"shaken" they call it,--in the English railroad
accidents is made very apparent in the following extract from Mr.Calcroft's report for 1877;--

     "It is no doubt a fact that collisions and other accidents to
     railway trains are attended with less serious consequences
     in proportion to the solidity of construction of passenger
     carriages.The accomodation and internal arrangements of
     third-class carriages, however, especially those used in
     ordinary trains, are defective as regards safety and comfort,
     as compared with many carriages of the same class on foreign
     railways.The first-class passenger, except when thrown against
     his opposite companion, or when some luggage falls upon him, is
     generally saved from severe contusion by the well-stuffed or
     padded linings of the carriages; whilst the second-class and
     third-class passenger is generally thrown with violence against
     the hard wood-work.If the second and third-class carriages
     had a high padded back lining, extending above the head of the
     passenger, it would probably tend to lesson the danger to life
     and limb which, as the returns of accidents show, passengers
     in carriages of this class are much exposed to in train
     accidents."[28]

 [28] _General Report to the Board of Trade upon the accidents which
  have occurred on the Railways of the United Kingdom during the year
  1877, p.37._

In 1878 the passenger journeys made in the second and third class
carriages of the United Kingdom were thirteen to one of those made
in first class carriages;--or, expressed in millions, there were
but 41 of the latter to 523 of the former.There can be very little
question indeed that if, during the last ten years, thirteen out
of fourteen of the passengers on Massachusetts railroads had been
carried in narrow compartments with wooden seats and unlined sides
the number of those returned as slightly injured in the numerous
accidents which occurred would have been at least three-fold larger
than it was.If it had not been ten-fold larger it would have been
surprising.The foregoing comparison, relates however, simply to passengers
killed in accidents for which they are in no degree responsible.When, however, the question reverts to the general cost in life
and limb at which the railroad systems are worked and the railroad
traffic is carried on to the entire communities served, the
comparison is less favorable to Massachusetts.Taking the eight
years of 1871-8, the British returns include 30,641 cases of injury,
and 9,113 of death; while those of Massachusetts for the same
years included 1,165 deaths, with only 1,044 cases of injury; in
the one case a total of 39,745 casualties, as compared with 2,209
the other.It will, however be noticed that while in the British
returns the cases of injury are nearly three-fold those of death, in
the Massachusetts returns the deaths exceed the cases of injury.This fact in the present case cannot but throw grave suspicion
on the completeness of the Massachusetts returns.As a matter of
practical experience it is well known that cases of injury almost
invariably exceed those of death, and the returns in which the
disproportion is greatest, if no sufficient explanation presents
itself, are probably the most full and reliable.Taking, therefore,
the deaths in the two cases as the better basis for comparison, it
will be found that the roads of Great Britain in the grand result
accomplished seventeen-fold the work of those of Massachusetts with
less than eight times as many casualties; had the proportion between
the results accomplished and the fatal injuries inflicted been
maintained, but 536 deaths instead of 1,165 would have appeared in
the Massachusetts returns.The reason of this difference in result
is worth looking for, and fortunately the statistical tables are
in both cases carried sufficiently into detail to make an analysis
possible; and this analysis, when made, seems to indicate very
clearly that while, for those directly connected with the railroads,
either as passengers or as employés, the Massachusetts system
in its working involves relatively a less degree of danger than
that of Great Britain, yet for the outside community it involves
very much more.Take, for instance, the two heads of accidents
at grade-crossings and accidents to trespassers, which have been
already referred to.In Great Britain highway grade-crossings
are discouraged.The results of the policy pursued may in each case be read
with sufficient distinctness in the bills of mortality.During the
years 1872-7, of 1,929 casualties to persons on the railroads of
Massachusetts, no less than 200 occurred at highway grade crossings.Had the accidents of this description in Great Britain been equally
numerous in proportion to the larger volume of the traffic of that
country, they would have resulted in over 3,000 cases of death or
personal injury; they did in fact result in 586 such cases.In
Massachusetts, again, to walk at will on any part of a railroad
track is looked upon as a sort of prescriptive and inalienable
right of every member of the community, irrespective of age, sex,
color, or previous condition of servitude.Accordingly, during the
six years referred to, this right was exercised at the cost of life
or limb to 591 persons,--one in four of all the casualties which
occurred in connection with the railroad system.In Great Britain
the custom of using the tracks of railroads as a foot-path seems to
exist, but, so far from being regarded as a right, it is practiced
in perpetual terror of the law.Accordingly, instead of some 9,000
cases of death or injury from this cause during these six years,
which would have been the proportion under like conditions in
Massachusetts, the returns showed only 2,379.These two are among
the most constant and fruitful causes of accident in connection with
the railroad system of America.In great Britain their proportion
to the whole number of casualties which take place is scarcely a
seventh part of what it is in Massachusetts.Here they constitute
very nearly fifty per cent.of all the accidents which occur; there
they constitute but a little over seven.There is in this comparison
a good deal of solid food for legislative thought, if American
legislators would but take it in; for this is one matter the public
policy in regard to which can only be fixed by law.When we pass from Great Britain to the continental countries of
Europe, the difficulties in the way of any fair comparison of
results become greater and greater.The statistics do not enter
sufficiently into detail, nor is the basis of computation apparent.It is generally conceded that, where a due degree of caution is
exercised by the passenger, railroad traveling in continental
countries is attended with a much less degree of danger than in
England.When we come to the returns, they hardly bear out this
conclusion; at least to the degree commonly supposed.Nowhere is human life more carefully guarded than in
that country; yet their returns show that of 866,000,000 passengers
transported on the French railroads during the eleven years 1859-69,
no less than 65 were killed and 1,285 injured from causes beyond
their control; or one in each 13,000,000 killed as compared with one
in 10,700,000 in Great Britain; and one in every 674,000 injured
as compared with one in each 330,000 in the other country.During
the single year 1859, about 111,000,000 passengers were carried
on the French lines, at a general cost to the community of 2,416
casualties, of which 295 were fatal.In Massachusetts, during the
four years 1871-74, about 95,000,000 passengers were carried, at
a reported cost of 1,158 casualties.This showing might well be
considered favorable to Massachusetts did not the single fact that
her returns included more than twice as many deaths as the French,
with only a quarter as many injuries, make it at once apparent that
the statistics were at fault.Under these circumstances comparison
could only be made between the numbers of deaths reported; which
would indicate that, in proportion to the work done, the railroad
operations of Massachusetts involved about twice and a half more
cases of injury to life and limb than those of the French service.As respects Great Britain the comparison is much more favorable, the
returns showing an almost exactly equal general death-rate in the
two countries in proportion to their volumes of traffic; the volume
of Great Britain being about four times that of France, while its
death-rate by railroad accidents was as 1,100 to 295.With the exception of Belgium, however, in which country the
returns cover only the lines operated by the state, the basis
hardly exists for a useful comparison between the dangers of injury
from accident on the continental railroads and on those of Great
Britain and America.The several systems are operated on wholly
different principles, to meet the needs of communities between
whose modes of life and thought little similarity exists.The
continental trains are far less crowded than either the English or
the American, and, when accidents occur, fewer persons are involved
in them.The movement, also, goes on under much stricter regulation
and at lower rates of speed, so that there is a grain of truth in
the English sarcasm that on a German railway "it almost seems as
if beer-drinking at the stations were the principal business, and
traveling a mere accessory."Limiting, therefore, the comparison to the railroads of Great
Britain, it remains to be seen whether the evil reputation of the
American roads as respects accidents is wholly deserved.Is it
indeed true that the danger to a passenger's life and limbs is so
much greater in this country than elsewhere?--Locally, and so far
as Massachusetts at least is concerned, it certainly is not.How
is it with the country taken as a whole?--The lack of all reliable
statistics as respects this wide field of inquiry has already been
referred to.We do not know with
accuracy even the number of miles of road operated; much less the
number of passengers annually carried.As respects accidents, and
the deaths and injuries resulting therefrom, some information may be
gathered from a careful and very valuable, because the only record
which has been preserved during the last six years in the columns of
the _Railroad Gazette_.It makes, of course, no pretence at either
official accuracy or fullness, but it is as complete probably as
circumstances will permit of its being made.During the five years
1874-8 there have been included in this record 4,846 accidents,
resulting in 1,160 deaths and 4,650 cases of injury;--being an
average of 969 accidents a year, resulting in 232 deaths and 930
cases of injury.These it will be remembered are casualties directly
resulting either to passengers or employés from train accidents.No account is taken of injuries sustained by employés in the
ordinary operation of the roads, or by members of the community
not passengers.In Massachusetts the accidents to passengers and
employés constitute one-half of the whole, but a very small portion
of the injuries reported as sustained by either passengers or
employés are the consequence of train accidents,--not one in three
in the case of passengers or one in seven in that of employés.In
fact, of the 2,350 accidents to persons reported in Massachusetts
in the nine years 1870-8, but 271, or less than twelve per cent.,
belonged to the class alone included in the reports of the _Railroad
Gazette_.In England during the four years 1874-7 the proportion
was larger, being about twenty-five instead of twelve per cent.For
America at large the Massachusetts proportion is undoubtedly the
most nearly correct, and the probabilities would seem to be that
the annual average of injuries to persons incident to operating the
railroads of the United States is not less than 10,000, of which at
least 1,200 are due to train accidents.Of these about two-thirds
may be set down as sustained by passengers, or, approximately, 800 a
year.It remains to be ascertained what proportion this number bears to
the whole number carried.There are no reliable statistics on this
head any more than on the other.Nothing but an approximation of
the most general character is possible.The number of passengers
annually carried on the roads of a few of the states is reported
with more or less accuracy, and averaging these the result would
seem to indicate that there are certainly not more than 350,000,000
passengers annually carried on the roads of all the states.There
is something barbarous about such an approximation, and it is
disgraceful that at this late day we should in America be forced
to estimate the passenger movement on our railroads in much the
same way that we guess at the population of Africa.We are in this respect far in the rear of civilized
communities.Taking, however, 350,000,000 as a fair approximation
to our present annual passenger movement, it will be observed that
it is as nearly as may be half that of Great Britain.In Great
Britain, in 1878, there were 1,200 injuries to passengers from
accidents to trains, and 675 in 1877.The average of the last eight
years has been 1,226.If, therefore, the approximation of 800 a
year for America is at all near the truth, the percentage would seem
to be considerably larger than that arrived at from the statistics
of Great Britain.Meanwhile it is to be noted that while in Great
Britain about 25 cases of injury are reported to each one of death,
in America but four cases are reported to each death--a discrepancy
which is extremely suggestive.Perhaps, however, the most valuable
conclusion to be drawn from these figures is that in America we as
yet are absolutely without any reliable railroad statistics on this
subject at all.Taken as a whole, however, and under the most favorable showing,
it would seem to be a matter of fair inference that the dangers
incident to railroad traveling are materially greater in the United
States than in any country of Europe.How much greater is a question
wholly impossible to answer.So that when a statistical writer
undertakes to show, as one eminent European authority has done, that
in a given year on the American roads one passenger in every 286,179
was killed, and one in every 90,737 was injured, it is charitable
to suppose that in regard to America only is he indebted to his
imagination for his figures.Neither is it possible to analyze with any satisfactory degree of
precision the nature of the accidents in the two countries, with
a view to drawing inferences from them.Without attempting to do
so it maybe said that the English Board of Trade reports for the
last five years, 1874-8, include inquiries into 755 out of 11,585
accidents, the total number of every description reported as having
taken place.Meanwhile the _Railroad Gazette_ contains mention of
4,846 reported train accidents which occurred in America during
the same five years.Of these accidents, 1,310 in America and 81
in Great Britain were due to causes which were either unexplained
or of a miscellaneous character, or are not common to the systems
of the two countries.In so far as the remainder admitted of
classification, it was somewhat as follows:--

  [29] During these five years there were in Great Britain four cases
  of collision between locomotives or trains at level crossings of one
  railroad by another; in America there were 79.The probable cause of
  this discrepancy has already been referred to (_ante pp.The above record, though almost valueless for any purpose of exact
comparison, reveals, it will be noticed, one salient fact.Out of
755 English accidents, no less than 406 came under the head of
collisions--whether head collisions, rear collisions, or collisions
on sidings or at junctions.In other words, to collisions of some
sort between trains were due considerably more than half (54 per
cent.)of the accidents which took place in Great Britain, while
only 88, or less than 13 per cent.of the whole, were due to
derailments from all causes.In America on the other hand, while
of the 3,763 accidents recorded, 1,324, or but one-third part (35
per cent.)were due to collisions, no less than 586, or 24 per
cent., were classed under the head of derailments, due to defects
in the permanent way.During the the six years 1873-8 there were
in all 1698 cases of collision of every description between trains
reported as occurring in America to 1495 in the United Kingdom; but
while in America the derailments amounted to no less than 4016, or
more than twice the collisions, in the United Kingdom they were
but 817, or a little more than half their number.It has already
been noticed that the most disastrous accidents in America are apt
to occur on bridges, and Ashtabula and Tariffville at once suggest
themselves.Under the heading
of "Failures of Tunnels, Bridges, Viaducts or Culverts," there
were returned in that country during the six years 1873-8 only 29
accidents in all; while during the same time in America, under the
heads of broken bridges or tressels and open draws, the _Gazette_
recorded no less than 165.These figures curiously illustrate the
different manner in which the railroads of the two countries have
been constructed, and the different circumstances under which they
are operated.The English collisions are distinctly traceable to
constant overcrowding; the American derailments and bridge accidents
to inferior construction of our road-beds.Finally, what of late years has been done to diminish the dangers
of the rail?--What more can be done?--Few persons realize what a
tremendous pressure in this respect is constantly bearing down upon
those whose business it is to operate railroads.A great accident is
not only a terrible blow to the pride and prestige of a corporation,
not only does it practically ruin the unfortunate officials involved
in it, but it entails also portentous financial consequences.Juries
proverbially have little mercy for railroad corporations, and, when
a disaster comes, these have practically no choice but to follow the
scriptural injunction to settle with their adversaries quickly.The
Revere catastrophe, for instance, cost the railroad company liable
on account of it over half a million of dollars; the Ashtabula
accident over $600,000; the Wollaston over $300,000.A few years ago
in England a jury awarded a sum of $65,000 for damages sustained
through the death of a single individual.During the five years,
1867-71, the railroad corporations of Great Britain paid out over
$11,000,000 in compensation for damages occasioned by accidents.In
view, merely, of such money consequences of disaster, it would be
most unnatural did not each new accident lead to the adoption of
better appliances to prevent its recurrence.[30]

  [30] The other side of this proposition has been argued with
  much force by Mr.William Galt in his report as one of the Royal
  Commission of 1874 on Railway Accidents.Galt's individual
  report bears date February 5, 1877, and in it he asserts that, as
  a matter of actual experience, the principle of self-interest on
  the part of the railway companies has proved a wholly insufficient
  safeguard against accidents.However it may be in theory, he
  contends that, taking into consideration the great cost of the
  appliances necessary to insure safety to the public on the one side,
  and the amount of damages incident to a certain degree of risk on
  the other side, the possible saving in expenditure to the companies
  by assuming the risk far exceeds the loss incurred by an occasional
  accident.The companies become, in a word, insurers of their
  passengers,--the premium being found in the economies effected by
  not adopting improved appliances of recognized value, and the losses
  being the damages incurred in case of accident.He treats the whole
  subject at great length and with much knowledge and ability.His
  report is a most valuable compendium for those who are in favor of a
  closer government supervision over railroads as a means of securing
  an increased safety from accident.To return, however, to the subject of railroad accidents, and the
final conclusion to be drawn from the statistics which have been
presented.That conclusion briefly stated is that the charges of
recklessness and indifference so generally and so widely advanced
against those managing the railroads cannot for an instant be
sustained.After all, as was said in the beginning of the present
volume, it is not the danger but the safety of the railroad which
should excite our special wonder.If any one doubts this, it is
very easy to satisfy himself of the fact,--that is, if by nature
he is gifted with the slightest spark of imagination.It is but
necessary to stand once on the platform of a way-station and to
look at an express train dashing by.There are few sights finer;
few better calculated to quicken the pulse.The glare of the head-light, the rush and throb of the
locomotive,--the connecting rod and driving-wheels of which seem
instinct with nervous life,--the flashing lamps in the cars, and
the final whirl of dust in which the red tail-lights vanish almost
as soon as they are seen,--all this is well calculated to excite
our admiration; but the special and unending cause for wonder is
how, in case of accident, anything whatever is left of the train.As it plunges into the darkness it would seem to be inevitable
that something must happen, and that, whatever happens, it must
necessarily involve both the train and every one in it in utter
and irremediable destruction.Here is a body weighing in the
neighborhood of two hundred tons, moving over the face of the earth
at a speed of sixty feet a second and held to its course only by two
slender lines of iron rails;--and yet it is safe!--We have seen how
when, half a century ago, the possibility of something remotely like
this was first discussed, a writer in the _British Quarterly_ earned
for himself a lasting fame by using the expression that "We should
as soon expect people to suffer themselves to be fired off upon
one of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as to trust themselves to the
mercy of such a machine, going at such a rate;"--while Lord Brougham
exclaimed that "the folly of seven hundred people going fifteen
miles an hour, in six trains, exceeds belief."At the time they
wrote, the chances were ninety-nine in a hundred that both reviewer
and correspondent were right; and yet, because reality, not for the
first nor the last time, saw fit to outstrip the wildest flights of
imagination, the former at least blundered, by being prudent, into
an immortality of ridicule.The thing, however, is still none the
less a miracle because it is with us matter of daily observation.That, indeed, is the most miraculous part of it.At all hours of the
day and of the night, during every season of the year, this movement
is going on.It depends for its even action
on every conceivable contingency, from the disciplined vigilance
of thousands of employés to the condition of the atmosphere, the
heat of an axle, or the strength of a nail.The vast machine is in
constant motion, and the derangement of a single one of a myriad of
conditions may at any moment occasion one of those inequalities of
movement which are known as accidents.Yet at the end of the year,
of the hundreds of millions of passengers fewer have lost their
lives through these accidents than have been murdered in cold blood.Not without reason, therefore, has it been asserted that, viewing
at once the speed, the certainty, and the safety with which the
intricate movement of modern life is carried on, there is no more
creditable monument to human care, human skill, and human foresight
than the statistics of railroad accidents.Abergele, accident at, 72.Accidents, railroad, about stations, 166.

Transcriber's note: The following has been moved from the beginning
of the book to the end.=By the same Author.=


=Railroads and Railroad Questions.= 12mo, cloth, $1 25.The volume
treats of "The Genesis of the Railroad System," "Accidents," and
the "Present Railroad Problem."The author has made himself the
acknowledged authority on this group of subjects.If his book goes
only to those who are interested in the ownership, the use, or the
administration of railroads, it is sure of a large circle of readers.--_Railway World._

"Characterized by broad, progressive, liberal ideas."--_Railway
Review._

"The entire conclusions are of great value."--_N.Y.Gradually the older girls saw that she would not save herself.They
liked her very much, and they, too, had started in with willing feet
and tender hands; but the thousand and one demands of their service
had drained them dry.They were efficient, cool-headed, quick-thinking
machines, doing their best, of course, but differing from Sidney in that
their service was of the mind, while hers was of the heart.To them,
pain was a thing to be recorded on a report; to Sidney, it was written
on the tablets of her soul.Carlotta Harrison went on night duty at the same time--her last night
service, as it was Sidney's first.She had
charge of the three wards on the floor just below Sidney, and of the
ward into which all emergency cases were taken.It was a difficult
service, perhaps the most difficult in the house.Scarcely a night went
by without its patrol or ambulance case.Ordinarily, the emergency ward
had its own night nurse.Belated
vacations and illness had depleted the training-school.Carlotta, given
double duty, merely shrugged her shoulders."I've always had things pretty hard here," she commented briefly."When I go out, I'll either be competent enough to run a whole hospital
singlehanded, or I'll be carried out feet first."Sidney was glad to have her so near.She knew her better than she knew
the other nurses.Small emergencies were constantly arising and finding
her at a loss.Once at least every night, Miss Harrison would hear a
soft hiss from the back staircase that connected the two floors, and,
going out, would see Sidney's flushed face and slightly crooked cap
bending over the stair-rail."I'm dreadfully sorry to bother you," she would say, "but So-and-So
won't have a fever bath"; or, "I've a woman here who refuses her
medicine."Then would follow rapid questions and equally rapid answers.Much as Carlotta disliked and feared the girl overhead, it never
occurred to her to refuse her assistance.Perhaps the angels who keep
the great record will put that to her credit.Sidney saw her first death shortly after she went on night duty.It was
the most terrible experience of all her life; and yet, as death goes, it
was quiet enough.So gradual was it that Sidney, with K.'s little watch
in hand, was not sure exactly when it happened.The light was very dim
behind the little screen.One moment the sheet was quivering slightly
under the struggle for breath, the next it was still.That life, so potential, so tremendous a
thing, could end so ignominiously, that the long battle should terminate
always in this capitulation--it seemed to her that she could not stand
it.Added to all her other new problems of living was this one of dying.She made mistakes, of course, which the kindly nurses forgot to
report--basins left about, errors on her records.She rinsed her
thermometer in hot water one night, and startled an interne by sending
him word that Mary McGuire's temperature was a hundred and ten degrees.She let a delirious patient escape from the ward another night and go
airily down the fire-escape before she discovered what had happened!Then she distinguished herself by flying down the iron staircase and
bringing the runaway back single-handed.For Christine's wedding the Street threw off its drab attire and assumed
a wedding garment.In the beginning it was incredulous about some of the
details."An awning from the house door to the curbstone, and a policeman!"Rosenfeld, who was finding steady employment at the Lorenz
house."And another awning at the church, with a red carpet!"Rosenfeld had arrived home and was making up arrears of rest and
recreation."Why do they ask 'em if they don't trust 'em?"But the mention of the policemen had been unfortunate.It recalled to
him many things that were better forgotten.He rose and scowled at his
wife."You tell Johnny something for me," he snarled."You tell him when he
sees his father walking down street, and he sittin' up there alone on
that automobile, I want him to stop and pick me up when I hail him.Me
walking, while my son swells around in a car!"You let me hear of him road-housin', and
I'll kill him!"The wedding was to be at five o'clock.This, in itself, defied all
traditions of the Street, which was either married in the very early
morning at the Catholic church or at eight o'clock in the evening at
the Presbyterian.There was something reckless about five o'clock.It had a queer feeling that perhaps such a
marriage was not quite legal.The question of what to wear became, for the men, an earnest one.Ed
resurrected an old black frock-coat and had a "V" of black cambric set
in the vest.Jenkins, the grocer, rented a cutaway, and bought a
new Panama to wear with it.The deaf-and-dumb book agent who boarded at
McKees', and who, by reason of his affliction, was calmly ignorant of
the excitement around him, wore a borrowed dress-suit, and considered
himself to the end of his days the only properly attired man in the
church.The younger Wilson was to be one of the ushers.When the newspapers came
out with the published list and this was discovered, as well as that
Sidney was the maid of honor, there was a distinct quiver through the
hospital training-school.A probationer was authorized to find out
particulars.It was the day of the wedding then, and Sidney, who had
not been to bed at all, was sitting in a sunny window in the Dormitory
Annex, drying her hair."I--I just wonder," she said, "if you would let some of the girls come
in to see you when you're dressed?""It's awfully thrilling, isn't it?"Are you going to walk down the aisle with him?"They had a rehearsal last night, but of course I was not
there.The probationer had been instructed to find out other things; so she set
to work with a fan at Sidney's hair."He's awfully good-looking, isn't he?"She was not ignorant of the methods of the school.If
this girl was pumping her--

"I'll have to think that over," she said, with a glint of mischief in
her eyes."When you know a person terribly well, you hardly know whether
he's good-looking or not.""I suppose," said the probationer, running the long strands of Sidney's
hair through her fingers, "that when you are at home you see him often."Sidney got off the window-sill, and, taking the probationer smilingly by
the shoulders, faced her toward the door."You go back to the girls," she said, "and tell them to come in and see
me when I am dressed, and tell them this: I don't know whether I am to
walk down the aisle with Dr.She shoved the probationer out into the hall and locked the door behind
her.That message in its entirety reached Carlotta Harrison.Sidney must be very sure
of herself.She, too, had not slept during the day.When the probationer who
had brought her the report had gone out, she lay in her long white
night-gown, hands clasped under her head, and stared at the vault-like
ceiling of her little room.She saw there Sidney in her white dress going down the aisle of the
church; she saw the group around the altar; and, as surely as she lay
there, she knew that Max Wilson's eyes would be, not on the bride, but
on the girl who stood beside her.The curious thing was that Carlotta felt that she could stop the wedding
if she wanted to.She'd happened on a bit of information--many a wedding
had been stopped for less.It rather obsessed her to think of stopping
the wedding, so that Sidney and Max would not walk down the aisle
together.There came, at last, an hour before the wedding, a lull in the feverish
activities of the previous month.In the Lorenz
kitchen, piles of plates, <DW64> waiters, ice-cream freezers, and Mrs.In the attic, in the center of a
sheet, before a toilet-table which had been carried upstairs for her
benefit, sat, on this her day of days, the bride.All the second story
had been prepared for guests and presents.Florists were still busy in the room below.Bridesmaids were clustered
on the little staircase, bending over at each new ring of the bell and
calling reports to Christine through the closed door:--

"Another wooden box, Christine.What will you
ever do with them all?"Here's another of the neighbors who wants to see how you
look.Do say you can't have any visitors now."Christine sat alone in the center of her sheet.The bridesmaids had been
sternly forbidden to come into her room."I haven't had a chance to think for a month," she said."And I've got
some things I've got to think out."But, when Sidney came, she sent for her.Sidney found her sitting on a
stiff chair, in her wedding gown, with her veil spread out on a small
stand.And, after Sidney had kissed her:--

"I've a good mind not to do it.""You're tired and nervous, that's all."But that isn't what's wrong with me.Throw that veil
some place and sit down."Christine was undoubtedly rouged, a very delicate touch.Sidney thought
brides should be rather pale.But under her eyes were lines that Sidney
had never seen there before."I'm not going to be foolish, Sidney.I'll go through with it, of
course.It would put mamma in her grave if I made a scene now.""Palmer gave his bachelor dinner at the Country Club last night.Somebody called father up to-day and
said that Palmer had emptied a bottle of wine into the piano.He hasn't
been here to-day."And as for the other--perhaps it wasn't Palmer who did
it."Three months before, perhaps, Sidney could not have comforted her; but
three months had made a change in Sidney.The complacent sophistries
of her girlhood no longer answered for truth.She put her arms around
Christine's shoulders."A man who drinks is a broken reed," said Christine."That's what I'm
going to marry and lean on the rest of my life--a broken reed.She got up quickly, and, trailing her long satin train across the floor,
bolted the door.Then from inside her corsage she brought out and held
to Sidney a letter.It was very short; Sidney read it at a glance:--

Ask your future husband if he knows a girl at 213 ---- Avenue.Three months before, the Avenue would have meant nothing to Sidney.Christine, more sophisticated, had always known.Quite suddenly Sidney knew who the girl at 213 ---- Avenue was.The
paper she held in her hand was hospital paper with the heading torn off.The whole sordid story lay before her: Grace Irving, with her thin face
and cropped hair, and the newspaper on the floor of the ward beside her!One of the bridesmaids thumped violently on the door outside."Another electric lamp," she called excitedly through the door."You see," Christine said drearily."I have received another electric
lamp, and Palmer is downstairs!I've got to go through with it, I
suppose.The only difference between me and other brides is that I know
what I'm getting."It's too late to do anything else.I am not going to give this
neighborhood anything to talk about."She picked up her veil and set the coronet on her head.Sidney stood
with the letter in her hands.'s answers to her hot question
had been this:--

"There is no sense in looking back unless it helps us to look ahead.What your little girl of the ward has been is not so important as what
she is going to be.""Even granting this to be true," she said to Christine slowly,--"and it
may only be malicious after all, Christine,--it's surely over and done
with.It's not Palmer's past that concerns you now; it's his future with
you, isn't it?"A band of duchesse lace rose
like a coronet from her soft hair, and from it, sweeping to the end of
her train, fell fold after fold of soft tulle.She arranged the coronet
carefully with small pearl-topped pins.Then she rose and put her hands
on Sidney's shoulders."The simple truth is," she said quietly, "that I might hold Palmer if
I cared--terribly.It's my pride
that's hurt, nothing else."And thus did Christine Lorenz go down to her wedding.Sidney stood for a moment, her eyes on the letter she held.Already, in
her new philosophy, she had learned many strange things.One of them was
this: that women like Grace Irving did not betray their lovers; that the
code of the underworld was "death to the squealer"; that one played the
game, and won or lost, and if he lost, took his medicine.Somebody else in the hospital who knew her story, of course.Before going downstairs, Sidney placed the letter in a saucer and set
fire to it with a match.Some of the radiance had died out of her eyes.The alley, however, was
rather confused by certain things.For instance, it regarded the awning
as essentially for the carriage guests, and showed a tendency to duck
in under the side when no one was looking.Rosenfeld absolutely
refused to take the usher's arm which was offered her, and said she
guessed she was able to walk up alone.Johnny Rosenfeld came, as befitted his position, in a complete
chauffeur's outfit of leather cap and leggings, with the shield that was
his State license pinned over his heart.The Street came decorously, albeit with a degree of uncertainty as to
supper.Should they put something on the stove before they left, in case
only ice cream and cake were served at the house?Or was it just as well
to trust to luck, and, if the Lorenz supper proved inadequate, to sit
down to a cold snack when they got home?To K., sitting in the back of the church between Harriet and Anna, the
wedding was Sidney--Sidney only.He watched her first steps down the
aisle, saw her chin go up as she gained poise and confidence, watched
the swinging of her young figure in its gauzy white as she passed him
and went forward past the long rows of craning necks.Afterward he could
not remember the wedding party at all.The service for him was Sidney,
rather awed and very serious, beside the altar.It was Sidney who came
down the aisle to the triumphant strains of the wedding march, Sidney
with Max beside her!On his right sat Harriet, having reached the first pinnacle of her
new career.They were more than
that--they were triumphant.Sitting there, she cast comprehensive eyes
over the church, filled with potential brides.To Harriet, then, that October afternoon was a future of endless lace
and chiffon, the joy of creation, triumph eclipsing triumph.But to
Anna, watching the ceremony with blurred eyes and ineffectual bluish
lips, was coming her hour.Sitting back in the pew, with her hands
folded over her prayer-book, she said a little prayer for her straight
young daughter, facing out from the altar with clear, unafraid eyes.As Sidney and Max drew near the door, Joe Drummond, who had been
standing at the back of the church, turned quickly and went out.He
stumbled, rather, as if he could not see.CHAPTER XIV


The supper at the White Springs Hotel had not been the last supper
Carlotta Harrison and Max Wilson had taken together.Carlotta had
selected for her vacation a small town within easy motoring distance of
the city, and two or three times during her two weeks off duty Wilson
had gone out to see her.For once that he could see Sidney, he saw Carlotta twice.She knew quite well the kind of man with whom she was dealing--that he
would pay as little as possible.But she knew, too, that, let him want a
thing enough, he would pay any price for it, even marriage.The very ardor in her face was in her favor.She would put the thing
through, and show those puling nurses, with their pious eyes and evening
prayers, a thing or two.During that entire vacation he never saw her in anything more elaborate
than the simplest of white dresses modestly open at the throat, sleeves
rolled up to show her satiny arms.There were no other boarders at the
little farmhouse.She sat for hours in the summer evenings in the square
yard filled with apple trees that bordered the highway, carefully
posed over a book, but with her keen eyes always on the road.She read
Browning, Emerson, Swinburne.Once he found her with a book that she
hastily concealed.He insisted on seeing it, and secured it.Confronted with it, she blushed and dropped her
eyes.His delighted vanity found in it the most insidious of compliments, as
she had intended."I feel such an idiot when I am with you," she said."I wanted to know a
little more about the things you do."That put their relationship on a new and advanced basis.Thereafter
he occasionally talked surgery instead of sentiment.His work, a sealed book to his women before,
lay open to her.Now and then their professional discussions ended in something
different.I can talk
shop with you without either shocking or nauseating you.You are the
most intelligent woman I know--and one of the prettiest."He had stopped the machine on the crest of a hill for the ostensible
purpose of admiring the view."As long as you talk shop," she said, "I feel that there is nothing
wrong in our being together; but when you say the other thing--"

"Is it wrong to tell a pretty woman you admire her?"He twisted himself around in the seat and sat looking at her."The loveliest mouth in the world!"She had expected it for at least a week, but her surprise was well done.Well done also was her silence during the homeward ride.No, she was not angry, she said.It was only that he had set her
thinking.When she got out of the car, she bade him good-night and
good-bye.After that nothing could have kept him away, and she knew it."Man demands both danger and play; therefore he selects woman as the
most dangerous of toys."A spice of danger had entered into their
relationship.He motored out to the farm the next day, to be told that Miss Harrison
had gone for a long walk and had not said when she would be back.Every man likes to think that
he is a bit of a devil.Max settled his tie, and, leaving his
car outside the whitewashed fence, departed blithely on foot in the
direction Carlotta had taken.He found her, face down, under a tree,
looking pale and worn and bearing all the evidence of a severe mental
struggle.She rose in confusion when she heard his step, and retreated a
foot or two, with her hands out before her.I--I have got to
have a little time alone.He knew it was play-acting, but rather liked it; and, because he was
quite as skillful as she was, he struck a match on the trunk of the tree
and lighted a cigarette before he answered."I was afraid of this," he said, playing up.I am not really a villain, Carlotta."It was the first time he had used her name."Sit down and let us talk things over."She sat down at a safe distance, and looked across the little clearing
to him with the somber eyes that were her great asset."You can afford to be very calm," she said, "because this is only play
to you; I know it.I'm a good listener and
not--unattractive.But what is play for you is not necessarily play for
me.For the first time, he found himself believing in her sincerity.If she cried--he was at
the mercy of any woman who cried.This sort of thing cannot go on, Dr.She did cry then--real tears; and he went over beside her and took her
in his arms.You make me feel like
a scoundrel, and I've only been taking a little bit of happiness.Max, and kissed her again on the lips.The one element Carlotta had left out of her calculations was herself.She had known the man, had taken the situation at its proper value.But
she had left out this important factor in the equation,--that factor
which in every relationship between man and woman determines the
equation,--the woman.Into her calculating ambition had come a new and destroying element.She
who, like K. in his little room on the Street, had put aside love and
the things thereof, found that it would not be put aside.By the end of
her short vacation Carlotta Harrison was wildly in love with the younger
Wilson.They continued to meet, not as often as before, but once a week,
perhaps.The meetings were full of danger now; and if for the girl they
lost by this quality, they gained attraction for the man.She was shrewd
enough to realize her own situation.She
cared, and he did not.It was all a game now, not hers.All women are intuitive; women in love are dangerously so.As well as
she knew that his passion for her was not the real thing, so also she
realized that there was growing up in his heart something akin to the
real thing for Sidney Page.Suspicion became certainty after a talk
they had over the supper table at a country road-house the day after
Christine's wedding."How was the wedding--tiresome?"There's always something thrilling to me in a man tying
himself up for life to one woman."That's not exactly the Law and the Prophets, is it?"To think of selecting out of all the world one woman,
and electing to spend the rest of one's days with her!Although--"

His eyes looked past Carlotta into distance."Sidney Page was one of the bridesmaids," he said irrelevantly."She was
lovelier than the bride.""Pretty, but stupid," said Carlotta.I've really tried to
teach her things, but--you know--" She shrugged her shoulders.If there was a twinkle in his eye, he
veiled it discreetly.But, once again in the machine, he bent over and
put his cheek against hers.You're jealous," he said exultantly.Nevertheless, although he might smile, the image of Sidney lay very
close to his heart those autumn days.Sidney came off night duty the middle of November.The night duty had
been a time of comparative peace to Carlotta.Max could bring Sidney back to the hospital in his car.Sidney's half-days at home were occasions for agonies of jealousy on
Carlotta's part.On such an occasion, a month after the wedding, she
could not contain herself.She pleaded her old excuse of headache, and
took the trolley to a point near the end of the Street.After twilight
fell, she slowly walked the length of the Street.Christine and Palmer
had not returned from their wedding journey.The November evening was
not cold, and on the little balcony sat Sidney and Dr.K. was
there, too, had she only known it, sitting back in the shadow and saying
little, his steady eyes on Sidney's profile.She went on down the Street in a frenzy
of jealous anger.After that two ideas ran concurrent in Carlotta's mind: one was to get
Sidney out of the way, the other was to make Wilson propose to her.In
her heart she knew that on the first depended the second.A week later she made the same frantic excursion, but with a different
result.Sidney was not in sight, or Wilson.But standing on the wooden
doorstep of the little house was Le Moyne.The ailanthus trees were
bare at that time, throwing gaunt arms upward to the November sky.The
street-lamp, which in the summer left the doorstep in the shadow, now
shone through the branches and threw into strong relief Le Moyne's tall
figure and set face.She went on, startled, her busy brain scheming anew.It was the first time
she had known that K. lived in the Page house.It gave her a sense of
uncertainty and deadly fear.She made her first friendly overture of many days to Sidney the
following day.They met in the locker-room in the basement where the
street clothing for the ward patients was kept.Here, rolled in bundles
and ticketed, side by side lay the heterogeneous garments in which
the patients had met accident or illness.Rags and tidiness, filth and
cleanliness, lay almost touching.Far away on the other side of the white-washed basement, men were
unloading gleaming cans of milk.Floods of sunlight came down the
cellar-way, touching their white coats and turning the cans to silver.Everywhere was the religion of the hospital, which is order.Sidney, harking back from recent slights to the staircase conversation
of her night duty, smiled at Carlotta cheerfully."Grace Irving is going out to-day.When one remembers how ill she was and how we thought she could not
live, it's rather a triumph, isn't it?"Sidney examined with some dismay the elaborate negligee garments in her
hand."She can't go out in those; I shall have to lend her something."A
little of the light died out of her face."She's had a hard fight, and
she has won," she said."But when I think of what she's probably going
back to--"

Carlotta shrugged her shoulders."It's all in the day's work," she observed indifferently."You can take
them up into the kitchen and give them steady work paring potatoes, or
put them in the laundry ironing.She drew a package from the locker and looked at it ruefully."Well, what do you know about this?Here's a woman who came in in a
nightgown and pair of slippers.And now she wants to go out in half an
hour!"She turned, on her way out of the locker-room, and shot a quick glance
at Sidney."I happened to be on your street the other night," she said."You live
across the street from Wilsons', don't you?""I thought so; I had heard you speak of the house.Your--your brother
was standing on the steps."It isn't really
right to call him a roomer; he's one of the family now."'s name had struck an always responsive chord in Sidney.The two girls
went toward the elevator together.With a very little encouragement,
Sidney talked of K. She was pleased at Miss Harrison's friendly tone,
glad that things were all right between them again.At her floor, she
put a timid hand on the girl's arm."I was afraid I had offended you or displeased you," she said."I'm so
glad it isn't so."Things were not going any too well with K. True, he had received his
promotion at the office, and with this present affluence of twenty-two
dollars a week he was able to do several things.Rosenfeld now
washed and ironed one day a week at the little house, so that Katie
might have more time to look after Anna.He had increased also the
amount of money that he periodically sent East.The thing that rankled and filled him with a sense
of failure was Max Wilson's attitude.It was not unfriendly; it was,
indeed, consistently respectful, almost reverential.But he clearly
considered Le Moyne's position absurd.There was no true comradeship between the two men; but there was
beginning to be constant association, and lately a certain amount of
friction.Wilson began to bring all his problems to Le Moyne.There were long
consultations in that small upper room.Perhaps more than one man or
woman who did not know of K.'s existence owed his life to him that fall.Cases began to come in to him
from the surrounding towns.To his own daring was added a new and
remarkable technique.But Le Moyne, who had found resignation if not
content, was once again in touch with the work he loved.There were
times when, having thrashed a case out together and outlined the next
day's work for Max, he would walk for hours into the night out over the
hills, fighting his battle.The longing was on him to be in the thick
of things again.The thought of the gas office and its deadly round
sickened him.It was on one of his long walks that K. found Tillie.It was December then, gray and raw, with a wet snow that changed to
rain as it fell.The country roads were ankle-deep with mud, the wayside
paths thick with sodden leaves.The dreariness of the countryside that
Saturday afternoon suited his mood.He had ridden to the end of the
street-car line, and started his walk from there.As was his custom, he
wore no overcoat, but a short sweater under his coat.Somewhere along
the road he had picked up a mongrel dog, and, as if in sheer desire for
human society, it trotted companionably at his heels.Seven miles from the end of the car line he found a road-house, and
stopped in for a glass of Scotch.The dog
went in with him, and stood looking up into his face.It was as if he
submitted, but wondered why this indoors, with the scents of the road
ahead and the trails of rabbits over the fields.The house was set in a valley at the foot of two hills.Through the mist
of the December afternoon, it had loomed pleasantly before him.The door
was ajar, and he stepped into a little hall covered with ingrain carpet.To the right was the dining-room, the table covered with a white cloth,
and in its exact center an uncompromising bunch of dried flowers.To the
left, the typical parlor of such places.It might have been the parlor
of the White Springs Hotel in duplicate, plush self-rocker and all.Over
everything was silence and a pervading smell of fresh varnish.The house
was aggressive with new paint--the sagging old floors shone with it, the
doors gleamed.called K.

There were slow footsteps upstairs, the closing of a bureau drawer,
the rustle of a woman's dress coming down the stairs.K., standing
uncertainly on a carpet oasis that was the center of the parlor varnish,
stripped off his sweater.he said to the unseen female on the
staircase.She put a hand against the
doorframe to steady herself.Tillie surely, but a new Tillie!With her
hair loosened around her face, a fresh blue chintz dress open at the
throat, a black velvet bow on her breast, here was a Tillie fuller,
infinitely more attractive, than he had remembered her.But she did not
smile at him.There was something about her eyes not unlike the dog's
expression, submissive, but questioning."Well, you've found me, Mr.And, when he held out his hand,
smiling: "I just had to do it, Mr.You look mighty fine and--happy, Tillie."Schwitter's gone to the postoffice.Will you have a cup of tea, or will you have something else?"The instinct of the Street was still strong in Tillie.The Street did
not approve of "something else.""Scotch-and-soda," said Le Moyne."And shall I buy a ticket for you to
punch?"He was sorry he had made the blunder.Evidently the Street and all that pertained was a sore subject.It was for this that she had exchanged
the virginal integrity of her life at Mrs.McKee's--for this wind-swept
little house, tidily ugly, infinitely lonely.There were two crayon
enlargements over the mantel.The
other was the paper-doll wife.K. wondered what curious instinct of
self-abnegation had caused Tillie to leave the wife there undisturbed.Back of its position of honor he saw the girl's realization of her own
situation.On a wooden shelf, exactly between the two pictures, was
another vase of dried flowers.Tillie brought the Scotch, already mixed, in a tall glass.K. would
have preferred to mix it himself, but the Scotch was good."You gave me a turn at first," said Tillie."But I am right glad to see
you, Mr.Now that the roads are bad, nobody comes very much.Until now, K. and Tillie, when they met, had met conversationally on the
common ground of food.They no longer had that, and between them both
lay like a barrier their last conversation.More attractive it certainly was,
but happy?There was a wistfulness about Tillie's mouth that set him
wondering."He's about the best man on earth.He's never said a cross word to
me--even at first, when I was panicky and scared at every sound.""I burned a lot of victuals when I first came, running off and hiding
when I heard people around the place.It used to seem to me that what
I'd done was written on my face.Tillie glanced up at the two pictures over the mantel."Sometimes it is--when he comes in tired, and I've a chicken ready or
some fried ham and eggs for his supper, and I see him begin to look
rested.He lights his pipe, and many an evening he helps me with the
dishes."I wouldn't go back to where I was, but I am not happy, Mr.This place is his, and he'd like a boy to come into it
when he's gone.if I did have one; what would it be?"'s eyes followed hers to the picture and the everlastings underneath."And she--there isn't any prospect of her--?"There was no solution to Tillie's problem.Le Moyne, standing on the
hearth and looking down at her, realized that, after all, Tillie must
work out her own salvation.They talked far into the growing twilight of the afternoon.Tillie was
hungry for news of the Street: must know of Christine's wedding, of
Harriet, of Sidney in her hospital.And when he had told her all, she
sat silent, rolling her handkerchief in her fingers.Then:--

"Take the four of us," she said suddenly,--"Christine Lorenz and Sidney
Page and Miss Harriet and me,--and which one would you have picked to
go wrong like this?I guess, from the looks of things, most folks would
have thought it would be the Lorenz girl.They'd have picked Harriet
Kennedy for the hospital, and me for the dressmaking, and it would have
been Sidney Page that got married and had an automobile.She looked up at K. shrewdly.They didn't know me, and I
heard them talking.They said Sidney Page was going to marry Dr.As she
stood before him she looked up into his face."If you like her as well as I think you do, Mr.Le Moyne, you won't let
him get her.""I am afraid that's not up to me, is it?What would I do with a wife,
Tillie?"I guess, in the
long run, that would count more than money."That was what K. took home with him after his encounter with Tillie.He
pondered it on his way back to the street-car, as he struggled against
the wind.Wagon-tracks along the road were
filled with water and had begun to freeze.The rain had turned to a
driving sleet that cut his face.Halfway to the trolley line, the dog
turned off into a by-road.The dog stared after
him, one foot raised.Once again his eyes were like Tillie's, as she had
waved good-bye from the porch.His head sunk on his breast, K. covered miles of road with his long,
swinging pace, and fought his battle.Was Tillie right, after all, and
had he been wrong?Why should he efface himself, if it meant Sidney's
unhappiness?Why not accept Wilson's offer and start over again?Then
if things went well--the temptation was strong that stormy afternoon.He
put it from him at last, because of the conviction that whatever he did
would make no change in Sidney's ultimate decision.If she cared enough
for Wilson, she would marry him.CHAPTER XV


Palmer and Christine returned from their wedding trip the day K.
discovered Tillie.Anna Page made much of the arrival, insisted on
dinner for them that night at the little house, must help Christine
unpack her trunks and arrange her wedding gifts about the apartment.She
was brighter than she had been for days, more interested.The wonders of
the trousseau filled her with admiration and a sort of jealous envy for
Sidney, who could have none of these things.In a pathetic sort of way,
she mothered Christine in lieu of her own daughter.And it was her quick eye that discerned something wrong.Under her excitement was an undercurrent of reserve.Anna, rich in maternity if in nothing else, felt it, and in reply to
some speech of Christine's that struck her as hard, not quite fitting,
she gave her a gentle admonishing."Married life takes a little adjusting, my dear," she said."After we
have lived to ourselves for a number of years, it is not easy to live
for some one else."Christine straightened from the tea-table she was arranging.But why should the woman do all the adjusting?""Men are more set," said poor Anna, who had never been set in anything
in her life."It is harder for them to give in.And, of course, Palmer
is older, and his habits--"

"The less said about Palmer's habits the better," flashed Christine."I
appear to have married a bunch of habits."She gave over her unpacking, and sat down listlessly by the fire, while
Anna moved about, busy with the small activities that delighted her.Six weeks of Palmer's society in unlimited amounts had bored Christine
to distraction.She sat with folded hands and looked into a future that
seemed to include nothing but Palmer: Palmer asleep with his mouth open;
Palmer shaving before breakfast, and irritable until he had had his
coffee; Palmer yawning over the newspaper.And there was a darker side to the picture than that.There was a vision
of Palmer slipping quietly into his room and falling into the heavy
sleep, not of drunkenness perhaps, but of drink.She knew now that it would happen again and again, as long as he
lived.The letter she had received on
her wedding day was burned into her brain.There would be that in the
future too, probably.She was making a brave clutch
at happiness.But that afternoon of the first day at home she was
terrified.She was glad when Anna went and left her alone by her fire.But when she heard a step in the hall, she opened the door herself.She
had determined to meet Palmer with a smile.Tears brought nothing;
she had learned that already."Daughters of joy," they called girls like the one on the Avenue.She waited while, with his back to her, he
shook himself like a great dog.He smiled down at her, his kindly eyes lighting."It's good to be home and to see you again.Won't you come in to my
fire?""All the more reason why you should come," she cried gayly, and held the
door wide.The little parlor was cheerful with fire and soft lamps, bright with
silver vases full of flowers.K. stepped inside and took a critical
survey of the room."Between us we have made a pretty good job of this, I
with the paper and the wiring, and you with your pretty furnishings and
your pretty self."Christine saw his approval, and was
happier than she had been for weeks.She put on the thousand little airs
and graces that were a part of her--held her chin high, looked up at
him with the little appealing glances that she had found were wasted on
Palmer.She lighted the spirit-lamp to make tea, drew out the best chair
for him, and patted a cushion with her well-cared-for hands."And see, here's a footstool.""I am ridiculously fond of being babied," said K., and quite basked in
his new atmosphere of well-being.This was better than his empty room
upstairs, than tramping along country roads, than his own thoughts."Do
tell me all the scandal of the Street.""There has been no scandal since you went away," said K. And, because
each was glad not to be left to his own thoughts, they laughed at this
bit of unconscious humor."Seriously," said Le Moyne, "we have been very quiet.I have had my
salary raised and am now rejoicing in twenty-two dollars a week.Just when I had all my ideas fixed for
fifteen, I get twenty-two and have to reassemble them."It is very disagreeable when one's income becomes a burden," said
Christine gravely.She was finding in Le Moyne something that she needed just then--a
solidity, a sort of dependability, that had nothing to do with
heaviness.She felt that here was a man she could trust, almost confide
in.She liked his long hands, his shabby but well-cut clothes, his fine
profile with its strong chin.She left off her little affectations,--a
tribute to his own lack of them,--and sat back in her chair, watching
the fire.When K. chose, he could talk well.The Howes had been to Bermuda on
their wedding trip.He knew Bermuda; that gave them a common ground.As for K., he frankly enjoyed
the little visit--drew himself at last with regret out of his chair."You've been very nice to ask me in, Mrs."I hope you
will allow me to come again.But, of course, you are going to be very
gay."It seemed to Christine she would never be gay again.She did not
want him to go away.The sound of his deep voice gave her a sense of
security.She liked the clasp of the hand he held out to her, when at
last he made a move toward the door.Howe I am sorry he missed our little party," said Le Moyne.As he closed the door behind him, there was a new light in Christine's
eyes.Things were not right, but, after all, they were not hopeless.One
might still have friends, big and strong, steady of eye and voice.When
Palmer came home, the smile she gave him was not forced.The day's exertion had been bad for Anna.Le Moyne found her on the
couch in the transformed sewing-room, and gave her a quick glance of
apprehension.She was propped up high with pillows, with a bottle of
aromatic ammonia beside her."Just--short of breath," she panted.Sidney--is
coming home--to supper; and--the others--Palmer and--"

That was as far as she got.K., watch in hand, found her pulse thin,
stringy, irregular.He had been prepared for some such emergency, and he
hurried into his room for amyl-nitrate.When he came back she was almost
unconscious.He broke the capsule
in a towel, and held it over her face.After a time the spasm relaxed,
but her condition remained alarming.Harriet, who had come home by that time, sat by the couch and held her
sister's hand.Only once in the next hour or so did she speak.Harriet was too wretched to
notice the professional manner in which K. set to work over Anna."I've been a very hard sister to her," she said."If you can pull her
through, I'll try to make up for it."Christine sat on the stairs outside, frightened and helpless.They had
sent for Sidney; but the little house had no telephone, and the message
was slow in getting off.Ed came panting up the stairs and into the room."Well, this is sad, Harriet," said Dr."Why in the name of Heaven,
when I wasn't around, didn't you get another doctor.If she had had some
amyl-nitrate--"

"I gave her some nitrate of amyl," said K. quietly."There was really no
time to send for anybody.She almost went under at half-past five."Max had kept his word, and even Dr.He
gave a quick glance at this tall young man who spoke so quietly of what
he had done for the sick woman, and went on with his work.Sidney arrived a little after six, and from that moment the confusion in
the sick-room was at an end.She moved Christine from the stairs,
where Katie on her numerous errands must crawl over her; set Harriet to
warming her mother's bed and getting it ready; opened windows, brought
order and quiet.And then, with death in her eyes, she took up her
position beside her mother.This was no time for weeping; that would
come later.Once she turned to K., standing watchfully beside her."I think you have known this for a long time," she said.And, when he
did not answer: "Why did you let me stay away from her?It would have
been such a little time!""We were trying to do our best for both of you," he replied.It came as a cry from the depths of the
girl's new experience."She has had so little of life," she said, over and over."After all, Sidney," he said, "the Street IS life: the world is only
many streets.She had love and content, and she
had you."Anna died a little after midnight, a quiet passing, so that only Sidney
and the two men knew when she went away.During all that long evening she had sat looking back over years of
small unkindnesses.The thorn of Anna's inefficiency had always rankled
in her flesh.She had been hard, uncompromising, thwarted.Once he thought she was fainting, and
went to her.Do you think you could get them all out of the room and
let me have her alone for just a few minutes?"He cleared the room, and took up his vigil outside the door.And, as he
stood there, he thought of what he had said to Sidney about the Street.Here in this very house were death and
separation; Harriet's starved life; Christine and Palmer beginning a
long and doubtful future together; himself, a failure, and an impostor.When he opened the door again, Sidney was standing by her mother's bed.He went to her, and she turned and put her head against his shoulder
like a tired child."Take me away, K.," she said pitifully.And, with his arm around her, he led her out of the room.Outside of her small immediate circle Anna's death was hardly felt.Daniel went back to the office.Harriet carried back to her
business a heaviness of spirit that made it difficult to bear with
the small irritations of her day.Perhaps Anna's incapacity, which had
always annoyed her, had been physical.She must have had her trouble a
longtime.She remembered other women of the Street who had crept through
inefficient days, and had at last laid down their burdens and closed
their mild eyes, to the lasting astonishment of their families.What did
they think about, these women, as they pottered about?Did they resent
the impatience that met their lagging movements, the indifference
that would not see how they were failing?Hot tears fell on Harriet's
fashion-book as it lay on her knee.Not only for Anna--for Anna's
prototypes everywhere.On Sidney--and in less measure, of course, on K.--fell the real brunt of
the disaster.Sidney kept up well until after the funeral, but went down
the next day with a low fever.Ed said, and sternly forbade the hospital
again until Christmas.Morning and evening K. stopped at her door and
inquired for her, and morning and evening came Sidney's reply:--

"Much better.But the days dragged on and she did not get about.Downstairs, Christine and Palmer had entered on the round of midwinter
gayeties.Palmer's "crowd" was a lively one.There were dinners
and dances, week-end excursions to country-houses.The Street grew
accustomed to seeing automobiles stop before the little house at all
hours of the night.Johnny Rosenfeld, driving Palmer's car, took to
falling asleep at the wheel in broad daylight, and voiced his discontent
to his mother."You never know where you are with them guys," he said briefly."We
start out for half an hour's run in the evening, and get home with the
milk-wagons.And the more some of them have had to drink, the more they
want to drive the machine.If I get a chance, I'm going to beat it while
the wind's my way."But, talk as he might, in Johnny Rosenfeld's loyal heart there was no
thought of desertion.Palmer had given him a man's job, and he would
stick by it, no matter what came.There were some things that Johnny Rosenfeld did not tell his mother.There were evenings when the Howe car was filled, not with Christine
and her friends, but with women of a different world; evenings when the
destination was not a country estate, but a road-house; evenings when
Johnny Rosenfeld, ousted from the driver's seat by some drunken youth,
would hold tight to the swinging car and say such fragments of prayers
as he could remember.Johnny Rosenfeld, who had started life with few
illusions, was in danger of losing such as he had.One such night Christine put in, lying wakefully in her bed, while the
clock on the mantel tolled hour after hour into the night.Palmer did
not come home at all.He sent a note from the office in the morning:

"I hope you are not worried, darling.The car broke down near the
Country Club last night, and there was nothing to do but to spend the
night there.I would have sent you word, but I did not want to rouse
you.What do you say to the theater to-night and supper afterward?"She telephoned the Country Club that morning,
and found that Palmer had not been there.But, although she knew now
that he was deceiving her, as he always had deceived her, as probably
he always would, she hesitated to confront him with what she knew.She
shrank, as many a woman has shrunk before, from confronting him with his
lie.But the second time it happened, she was roused.It was almost Christmas
then, and Sidney was well on the way to recovery, thinner and very
white, but going slowly up and down the staircase on K.'s arm, and
sitting with Harriet and K. at the dinner table.She was begging to be
back on duty for Christmas, and K. felt that he would have to give her
up soon.At three o'clock one morning Sidney roused from a light sleep to hear a
rapping on her door.She carried a
candle, and before she spoke she looked at Sidney's watch on the bedside
table."I hoped my clock was wrong," she said."I am sorry to waken you,
Sidney, but I don't know what to do."Sidney had lighted the gas and was throwing on her dressing-gown."When he went out did he say--"

"He said nothing.Sidney, I am going home in the
morning.""You don't mean that, do you?""Don't I look as if I mean it?How much of this sort of thing is a woman
supposed to endure?"These things always seem terrible in the
middle of the night, but by morning--"

Christine whirled on her.You remember the letter I got on my wedding
day?""Believe it or not," said Christine doggedly, "that's exactly what has
happened.I got something out of that little rat of a Rosenfeld boy, and
the rest I know because I know Palmer.The hospital had taught Sidney one thing: that it took many people to
make a world, and that out of these some were inevitably vicious.But
vice had remained for her a clear abstraction.There were such people,
and because one was in the world for service one cared for them.Even
the Saviour had been kind to the woman of the streets.But here abruptly Sidney found the great injustice of the world--that
because of this vice the good suffer more than the wicked."It makes me hate all the men in the world.Palmer cares for you, and yet he can do a thing like this!"Christine was pacing nervously up and down the room.Mere companionship
had soothed her.She was now, on the surface at least, less excited than
Sidney."They are not all like Palmer, thank Heaven," she said.My father is one, and your K., here in the house, is
another."At four o'clock in the morning Palmer Howe came home.Christine met
him in the lower hall.She
confronted him in her straight white gown and waited for him to speak."I am sorry to be so late, Chris," he said."The fact is, I am all in.I
was driving the car out Seven Mile Run.We blew out a tire and the thing
turned over."Christine noticed then that his right arm was hanging inert by his side.CHAPTER XVI


Young Howe had been firmly resolved to give up all his bachelor habits
with his wedding day.In his indolent, rather selfish way, he was much
in love with his wife.But with the inevitable misunderstandings of the first months of
marriage had come a desire to be appreciated once again at his face
value.Grace had taken him, not for what he was, but for what he seemed
to be.She knew him now--all his small
indolences, his affectations, his weaknesses.Later on, like other
women since the world began, she would learn to dissemble, to affect to
believe him what he was not.And so, back to Grace six weeks after his wedding day came Palmer
Howe, not with a suggestion to renew the old relationship, but for
comradeship.Christine sulked--he wanted good cheer; Christine was intolerant--he
wanted tolerance; she disapproved of him and showed her disapproval--he
wanted approval.He wanted life to be comfortable and cheerful, without
recriminations, a little work and much play, a drink when one was
thirsty.Distorted though it was, and founded on a wrong basis, perhaps,
deep in his heart Palmer's only longing was for happiness; but this
happiness must be of an active sort--not content, which is passive, but
enjoyment.No taxi working its head
off for us.Just a little run over the country roads, eh?"It was the afternoon of the day before Christine's night visit to
Sidney.The office had been closed, owing to a death, and Palmer was in
possession of a holiday."We'll go out to the Climbing Rose and have
supper.""That's not true, Grace, and you know it."The roads are frozen hard; an hour's run
into the country will bring your color back."Go and ride with your wife," said the girl,
and flung away from him.The last few weeks had filled out her thin figure, but she still bore
traces of her illness.She
looked curiously boyish, almost sexless.Because she saw him wince when she mentioned Christine, her ill temper
increased."You get out of here," she said suddenly."I didn't ask you to come
back.You always knew I would have to marry some day."I didn't hear any reports of you hanging
around the hospital to learn how I was getting along."Besides, one of--" He hesitated over his wife's name."A
girl I know very well was in the training-school.There would have been
the devil to pay if I'd as much as called up.""You never told me you were going to get married."Cornered, he slipped an arm around her."I meant to tell you, honey; but you got sick.Anyhow, I--I hated to
tell you, honey."There was a comfortable feeling of
coming home about going there again.And, now that the worst minute of
their meeting was over, he was visibly happier.But Grace continued to
stand eyeing him somberly."I've got something to tell you," she said."Don't have a fit, and don't
laugh.If you do, I'll--I'll jump out of the window.I've got a place in
a store.She was a nice girl and he was fond of her.And he was not unselfish about it.He did not want her to belong to any one else."One of the nurses in the hospital, a Miss Page, has got me something to
do at Lipton and Homburg's.I am going on for the January white sale.If
I make good they will keep me."He had put her aside without a qualm; and now he met her announcement
with approval.They would have a holiday
together, and then they would say good-bye.He was getting off well, all things considered.But that isn't any
reason why we shouldn't be friends, is it?I would like to feel that I can stop in now and then and say how do you
do."The mention of Sidney's name brought up in his mind Christine as he had
left her that morning.She used to be a good sport,
but she had never been the same since the day of the wedding.He thought
her attitude toward him was one of suspicion.But any attempt on his part to fathom it only met with cold silence."I'll tell you what we'll do," he said."We won't go to any of the old
places.I've found a new roadhouse in the country that's respectable
enough to suit anybody.We'll go out to Schwitter's and get some dinner.And on the way out he lived up to the letter of
their agreement.The situation exhilarated him: Grace with her new air
of virtue, her new aloofness; his comfortable car; Johnny Rosenfeld's
discreet back and alert ears.The adventure had all the thrill of a new conquest in it.He treated the
girl with deference, did not insist when she refused a cigarette, felt
glowingly virtuous and exultant at the same time.When the car drew up before the Schwitter place, he slipped a
five-dollar bill into Johnny Rosenfeld's not over-clean hand."I don't mind the ears," he said.And
Johnny stalled his engine in sheer surprise."There's just enough of the Jew in me," said Johnny, "to know how to
talk a lot and say nothing, Mr.He crawled stiffly out of the car and prepared to crank it."I'll just give her the 'once over' now and then," he said."She'll
freeze solid if I let her stand."Grace had gone up the narrow path to the house.She had the gift of
looking well in her clothes, and her small hat with its long quill
and her motor-coat were chic and becoming.She never overdressed, as
Christine was inclined to do.Fortunately for Palmer, Tillie did not see him.A heavy German maid
waited at the table in the dining-room, while Tillie baked waffles in
the kitchen.Johnny Rosenfeld, going around the side path to the kitchen door with
visions of hot coffee and a country supper for his frozen stomach, saw
her through the window bending flushed over the stove, and hesitated.Then, without a word, he tiptoed back to the car again, and, crawling
into the tonneau, covered himself with rugs.In his untutored mind were
certain great qualities, and loyalty to his employer was one.The five
dollars in his pocket had nothing whatever to do with it.At eighteen he had developed a philosophy of four words.It took the
place of the Golden Rule, the Ten Commandments, and the Catechism.It
was: "Mind your own business."The discovery of Tillie's hiding-place interested but did not thrill
him.If she wanted to do the sort of thing she
was doing, that was her affair.Tillie and her middle-aged lover, Palmer
Howe and Grace--the alley was not unfamiliar with such relationships.It
viewed them with tolerance until they were found out, when it raised its
hands.True to his promise, Palmer wakened the sleeping boy before nine
o'clock.Grace had eaten little and drunk nothing; but Howe was slightly
stimulated."Give her the 'once over,'" he told Johnny, "and then go back and crawl
into the rugs again.Their progress was slow and rough over the
country roads, but when they reached the State road Howe threw open the
throttle.He took chances
and got away with them, laughing at the girl's gasps of dismay."Wait until I get beyond Simkinsville," he said, "and I'll let her out.The girl sat beside him with her eyes fixed ahead.He had been drinking,
and the warmth of the liquor was in his voice.She was going to make him live up to the letter of his promise to
go away at the house door; and more and more she realized that it would
be difficult.Instead of laughing when
she drew back from a proffered caress, he turned surly.Obstinate lines
that she remembered appeared from his nostrils to the corners of his
mouth.Finally she hit on a plan to make him stop somewhere in her neighborhood
and let her get out of the car.Now it passed them, and as
often they passed it.Palmer's car lost on
the hills, but gained on the long level stretches, which gleamed with a
coating of thin ice."I wish you'd let them get ahead, Palmer."I told you we'd travel to-night."What the deuce was the matter with
women, anyhow?Here was Grace as
sober as Christine.His light car skidded and struck the big car heavily.On a smooth road
perhaps nothing more serious than broken mudguards would have been the
result.But on the ice the small car slewed around and slid over the
edge of the bank.At the bottom of the declivity it turned over.Howe freed himself and stood
erect, with one arm hanging at his side.There was no sound at all from
the boy under the tonneau.Down the bank plunged a heavy, gorilla-like
figure, long arms pushing aside the frozen branches of trees.When he
reached the car, O'Hara found Grace sitting unhurt on the ground.In the
wreck of the car the lamps had not been extinguished, and by their light
he made out Howe, swaying dizzily.The other members of O'Hara's party had crawled down the bank by that
time.With the aid of a jack, they got the car up.Johnny Rosenfeld lay
doubled on his face underneath.When he came to and opened his eyes,
Grace almost shrieked with relief."I'm all right," said Johnny Rosenfeld.And, when they offered him
whiskey: "Away with the fire-water.I--I--" A spasm of
pain twisted his face.With his arms he lifted
himself to a sitting position, and fell back again.CHAPTER XVII


By Christmas Day Sidney was back in the hospital, a little wan, but
valiantly determined to keep her life to its mark of service.She had a
talk with K. the night before she left.Katie was out, and Sidney had put the dining-room in order.K. sat by
the table and watched her as she moved about the room.The past few weeks had been very wonderful to him: to help her up and
down the stairs, to read to her in the evenings as she lay on the couch
in the sewing-room; later, as she improved, to bring small dainties home
for her tray, and, having stood over Katie while she cooked them, to
bear them in triumph to that upper room--he had not been so happy in
years."I hope you don't feel as if you must stay on," she said anxiously."Not
that we don't want you--you know better than that.""There is no place else in the whole world that I want to go to," he
said simply."I seem to be always relying on somebody's kindness to--to keep things
together.First, for years and years, it was Aunt Harriet; now it is
you.""Don't you realize that, instead of your being grateful to me, it is
I who am undeniably grateful to you?I have lived
around--in different places and in different ways.I would rather be
here than anywhere else in the world."There was so much that was hopeless in his
eyes that he did not want her to see.She would be quite capable, he
told himself savagely, of marrying him out of sheer pity if she ever
guessed.And he was afraid--afraid, since he wanted her so much--that he
would be fool and weakling enough to take her even on those terms.Everything was ready for her return to the hospital.She had been out
that day to put flowers on the quiet grave where Anna lay with folded
hands; she had made her round of little visits on the Street; and now
her suit-case, packed, was in the hall."In one way, it will be a little better for you than if Christine and
Palmer were not in the house."She likes you, K. She depends on you, too, especially since that night
when you took care of Palmer's arm before we got Dr.I often think,
K., what a good doctor you would have been.You knew so well what to do
for mother."She still could not trust her voice about her mother."Palmer's arm is going to be quite straight.Ed is so proud of Max
over it.Once at least, whenever they were
together, she brought Max into the conversation.He is
interesting, don't you think?""Very," said K.

To save his life, he could not put any warmth into his voice.It was not in human nature to expect more of him."Those long talks you have, shut in your room--what in the world do you
talk about?She was a little jealous of those evenings, when she sat alone, or
when Harriet, sitting with her, made sketches under the lamp to the
accompaniment of a steady hum of masculine voices from across the hall.Max came in always, before he went,
and, leaning over the back of a chair, would inform her of the absolute
blankness of life in the hospital without her."I go every day because I must," he would assure her gayly; "but, I tell
you, the snap is gone out of it.When there was a chance that every cap
was YOUR cap, the mere progress along a corridor became thrilling."He
had a foreign trick of throwing out his hands, with a little shrug of
the shoulders.he said--which, being translated, means:
"What the devil's the use!"And K. would stand in the doorway, quietly smoking, or go back to his
room and lock away in his trunk the great German books on surgery with
which he and Max had been working out a case.So K. sat by the dining-room table and listened to her talk of Max that
last evening together.Rosenfeld to-day not to be too much discouraged about
Johnny.Now that you are
such friends,"--she eyed him wistfully,--"perhaps some day you will come
to one of his operations.Even if you didn't understand exactly, I know
it would thrill you.And--I'd like you to see me in my uniform, K. You
never have."She grew a little sad as the evening went on.She was going to miss K.
very much.While she was ill she had watched the clock for the time to
listen for him.She knew the way he slammed the front door.Palmer never
slammed the door.She knew too that, just after a bang that threatened
the very glass in the transom, K. would come to the foot of the stairs
and call:--

"Ahoy, there!""Aye, aye," she would answer--which was, he assured her, the proper
response.Whether he came up the stairs at once or took his way back to Katie had
depended on whether his tribute for the day was fruit or sweetbreads.He would miss her,
too; but he would have Harriet and Christine and--Max.Back in a circle
to Max, of course.She insisted, that last evening, on sitting up with him until midnight
ushered in Christmas Day.Christine and Palmer were out; Harriet, having
presented Sidney with a blouse that had been left over in the shop from
the autumn's business, had yawned herself to bed.When the bells announced midnight, Sidney roused with a start.She
realized that neither of them had spoken, and that K.The little clock on the shelf took up the burden of the
churches, and struck the hour in quick staccato notes.Sidney rose and went over to K., her black dress in soft folds about
her.Sidney left the little house at
six, with the street light still burning through a mist of falling snow.The hospital wards and corridors were still lighted when she went on
duty at seven o'clock.She had been assigned to the men's surgical ward,
and went there at once.She had not seen Carlotta Harrison since her
mother's death; but she found her on duty in the surgical ward.For the
second time in four months, the two girls were working side by side.Sidney's recollection of her previous service under Carlotta made her
nervous."We were all sorry to hear of your trouble," she said."I hope we shall
get on nicely."Sidney surveyed the ward, full to overflowing.At the far end two cots
had been placed."The ward is heavy, isn't it?"There are three of
us--you, myself, and a probationer."The first light of the Christmas morning was coming through the windows.Carlotta put out the lights and turned in a business-like way to her
records."The probationer's name is Wardwell," she said."Perhaps you'd better
help her with the breakfasts.If there's any way to make a mistake, she
makes it."It was after eight when Sidney found Johnny Rosenfeld.Suffering had refined the boy's features.His dark, heavily fringed eyes
looked at her from a pale face."I was in a private room; but it cost thirty plunks a week, so I moved.Sidney had not seen him since his accident.She had wished to go, but K.
had urged against it.She was not strong, and she had already suffered
much.And now the work of the ward pressed hard.She stood beside him and stroked his hand.He pretended to think that her sympathy was for his fall from the estate
of a private patient to the free ward."Oh, I'm all right, Miss Sidney," he said.Howe is paying six
dollars a week for me.The difference between me and the other fellows
around here is that I get a napkin on my tray and they don't.""Six dollars a week for a napkin is going some.I'm no bloated
aristocrat; I don't have to have a napkin.""Have they told you what the trouble is?"Max Wilson is going to
operate on me.What a thing it was
to be able to take this life-in-death of Johnny Rosenfeld's and make it
life again!All sorts of men made up Sidney's world: the derelicts who wandered
through the ward in flapping slippers, listlessly carrying trays; the
unshaven men in the beds, looking forward to another day of boredom, if
not of pain; Palmer Howe with his broken arm; K., tender and strong, but
filling no especial place in the world.Towering over them all was the
younger Wilson.He meant for her, that Christmas morning, all that the
other men were not--to their weakness strength, courage, daring, power.Johnny Rosenfeld lay back on the pillows and watched her face."When I was a kid," he said, "and ran along the Street, calling Dr.Max
a dude, I never thought I'd lie here watching that door to see him come
in.Ain't it the hell of a world, anyhow?It
ain't much of a Christmas to you, either."Sidney fed him his morning beef tea, and, because her eyes filled up
with tears now and then at his helplessness, she was not so skillful as
she might have been.When one spoonful had gone down his neck, he smiled
up at her whimsically.As much as was possible, the hospital rested on that Christmas Day.The
internes went about in fresh white ducks with sprays of mistletoe in
their buttonholes, doing few dressings.Over the upper floors, where the
kitchens were located, spread toward noon the insidious odor of roasting
turkeys.Every ward had its vase of holly.In the afternoon, services
were held in the chapel downstairs.Wheel-chairs made their slow progress along corridors and down
elevators.Convalescents who were able to walk flapped along in carpet
slippers.Outside the wide doors of the corridor
the wheel-chairs were arranged in a semicircle.Behind them, dressed for
the occasion, were the elevator-men, the orderlies, and Big John, who
drove the ambulance.On one side of the aisle, near the front, sat the nurses in rows, in
crisp caps and fresh uniforms.On the other side had been reserved a
place for the staff.The internes stood back against the wall, ready to
run out between rejoicings, as it were--for a cigarette or an ambulance
call, as the case might be.Over everything brooded the after-dinner peace of Christmas afternoon.The nurses sang, and Sidney sang with them, her fresh young voice rising
above the rest.Yellow winter sunlight came through the stained-glass
windows and shone on her lovely flushed face, her smooth kerchief, her
cap, always just a little awry.Max, lounging against the wall, across the chapel, found his eyes
straying toward her constantly.What
a zest for living and for happiness she had!The Episcopal clergyman read the Epistle:

"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even
thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."She was good, and she had been anointed with the oil of
gladness.And he--

His brother was singing.His deep bass voice, not always true, boomed
out above the sound of the small organ.Ed had been a good brother to
him; he had been a good son.Max's vagrant mind wandered away from the service to the picture of his
mother over his brother's littered desk, to the Street, to K., to the
girl who had refused to marry him because she did not trust him, to
Carlotta last of all.He turned a little and ran his eyes along the line
of nurses.As if she were conscious of his scrutiny, she lifted
her head and glanced toward him.The nurses sang:--

     "O holy Child of Bethlehem!Descend to us, we pray;
      Cast out our sin, and enter in,
      Be born in us to-day."The wheel-chairs and convalescents quavered the familiar words.Ed's
heavy throat shook with earnestness.The Head, sitting a little apart with her hands folded in her lap and
weary with the suffering of the world, closed her eyes and listened.The Christmas morning had brought Sidney half a dozen gifts.K. sent her
a silver thermometer case with her monogram, Christine a toilet mirror.But the gift of gifts, over which Sidney's eyes had glowed, was a
great box of roses marked in Dr.Max's copper-plate writing, "From a
neighbor."Tucked in the soft folds of her kerchief was one of the roses that
afternoon.Max was waiting for Sidney in the
corridor.--she glanced down to the rose
she wore."The others make the most splendid bit of color in the ward.""They are not any the less mine because I am letting other people have a
chance to enjoy them."Under all his gayety he was curiously diffident with her.All the pretty
speeches he would have made to Carlotta under the circumstances died
before her frank glance.There were many things he wanted to say to her.He wanted to tell her
that he was sorry her mother had died; that the Street was empty without
her; that he looked forward to these daily meetings with her as a holy
man to his hour before his saint.What he really said was to inquire
politely whether she had had her Christmas dinner.Sidney eyed him, half amused, half hurt.Is it bad for discipline for us to be good
friends?"Something in her eyes roused
the devil of mischief that always slumbered in him."My car's been stalled in a snowdrift downtown since early this morning,
and I have Ed's Peggy in a sleigh.Put on your things and come for a
ride."He hoped Carlotta could hear what he said; to be certain of it, he
maliciously raised his voice a trifle.She was to be free that afternoon until six o'clock;
but she had promised to go home.Ten to one, he's with her now."The
heavy odor of the hospital, mingled with the scent of pine and evergreen
in the chapel; made her dizzy.And,
besides, if K. were with Christine--

"It's forbidden, isn't it?""And yet, you continue to tempt me and expect me to yield!""One of the most delightful things about temptation is yielding now and
then."Here was her old friend and
neighbor asking to take her out for a daylight ride.The swift rebellion
of youth against authority surged up in Sidney.Carlotta had gone by that time--gone with hate in her heart and black
despair.She knew very well what the issue would be.Sidney would drive
with him, and he would tell her how lovely she looked with the air on
her face and the snow about her.The jerky motion of the little sleigh
would throw them close together.He would
touch Sidney's hand daringly and smile in her eyes.That was his method:
to play at love-making like an audacious boy, until quite suddenly the
cloak dropped and the danger was there.The Christmas excitement had not died out in the ward when Carlotta went
back to it.On each bedside table was an orange, and beside it a pair
of woolen gloves and a folded white handkerchief.There were sprays of
holly scattered about, too, and the after-dinner content of roast turkey
and ice-cream.The lame girl who played the violin limped down the corridor into the
ward.She was greeted with silence, that truest tribute, and with the
instant composing of the restless ward to peace.She was pretty in a young, pathetic way, and because to her Christmas
was a festival and meant hope and the promise of the young Lord, she
played cheerful things.The ward sat up, remembered that it was not the Sabbath, smiled across
from bed to bed.The probationer, whose name was Wardwell, was a tall, lean girl with a
long, pointed nose.She kept up a running accompaniment of small talk to
the music."Last Christmas," she said plaintively, "we went out into the country
in a hay-wagon and had a real time.I don't know what I am here for,
anyhow."Turkey and goose, mince pie and pumpkin pie, four kinds of cake; that's
the sort of spread we have up in our part of the world.When I think of
what I sat down to to-day--!"She had a profound respect for Carlotta, and her motto in the hospital
differed from Sidney's in that it was to placate her superiors, while
Sidney's had been to care for her patients.Seeing Carlotta bored, she ventured a little gossip.She had idly
glued the label of a medicine bottle on the back of her hand, and was
scratching a skull and cross-bones on it."I wonder if you have noticed something," she said, eyes on the label."I have noticed that the three-o'clock medicines are not given," said
Carlotta sharply; and Miss Wardwell, still labeled and adorned, made the
rounds of the ward."I'm no gossip," she said, putting the tray on the table."If you won't
see, you won't.As it was not required that tears be recorded on the record, Carlotta
paid no attention to this.Miss Wardwell swelled with importance
and let her superior ask her twice.A hand seemed to catch Carlotta's heart and hold it.Being an old friend doesn't make you look at a girl as if you
wanted to take a bite out of her.Mark my word, Miss Harrison, she'll
never finish her training; she'll marry him.I wish," concluded the
probationer plaintively, "that some good-looking fellow like that would
take a fancy to me.I am as ugly as a mud fence, but
I've got style."She was long and sinuous, but she wore her
lanky, ill-fitting clothes with a certain distinction.Harriet Kennedy
would have dressed her in jade green to match her eyes, and with long
jade earrings, and made her a fashion.The violinist had seen the tears on Johnny
Rosenfeld's white cheeks, and had rushed into rollicking, joyous music."I'm twenty-one and she's eighteen," hummed the
ward under its breath."Lord, how I'd like to dance!If I ever get out of this charnel-house!"The medicine-tray lay at Carlotta's elbow; beside it the box of labels.Carlotta knew it down to the depths of
her tortured brain.As inevitably as the night followed the day, she was
losing her game.She had lost already, unless--

If she could get Sidney out of the hospital, it would simplify things.She surmised shrewdly that on the Street their interests were wide
apart.It was here that they met on common ground.The lame violin-player limped out of the ward; the shadows of the
early winter twilight settled down.At five o'clock Carlotta sent Miss
Wardwell to first supper, to the surprise of that seldom surprised
person.The ward lay still or shuffled abut quietly.Christmas was over,
and there were no evening papers to look forward to.Carlotta gave the five-o'clock medicines.Then she sat down at the table
near the door, with the tray in front of her.There are certain thoughts
that are at first functions of the brain; after a long time the spinal
cord takes them up and converts them into acts almost automatically.Perhaps because for the last month she had done the thing so often in
her mind, its actual performance was almost without conscious thought.Carlotta took a bottle from her medicine cupboard, and, writing a new
label for it, pasted it over the old one.Then she exchanged it for one
of the same size on the medicine tray.In the dining-room, at the probationers' table, Miss Wardwell was
talking."Believe me," she said, "me for the country and the simple life after
this.They think I'm only a probationer and don't see anything, but I've
got eyes in my head.Wilson, and she
thinks I don't see it.But never mind; I paid, her up to-day for a few
of the jolts she has given me."Throughout the dining-room busy and competent young women came and ate,
hastily or leisurely as their opportunity was, and went on their way
again.In their hands they held the keys, not always of life and death
perhaps, but of ease from pain, of tenderness, of smooth pillows, and
cups of water to thirsty lips.In their eyes, as in Sidney's, burned the
light of service.But here and there one found women, like Carlotta and Miss Wardwell,
who had mistaken their vocation, who railed against the monotony of the
life, its limitations, its endless sacrifices.Fifty or so against two--fifty who looked out on the world with the
fearless glance of those who have seen life to its depths, and, with the
broad understanding of actual contact, still found it good.Fifty who
were learning or had learned not to draw aside their clean starched
skirts from the drab of the streets.And the fifty, who found the very
scum of the gutters not too filthy for tenderness and care, let Carlotta
and, in lesser measure, the new probationer alone.They could not have
voiced their reasons.The supper-room was filled with their soft voices, the rustle of their
skirts, the gleam of their stiff white caps.When Carlotta came in, she greeted none of them.They did not like her,
and she knew it.Before her, instead of the tidy supper-table, she was seeing the
medicine-tray as she had left it."I guess I've fixed her," she said to herself.Her very soul was sick with fear of what she had done.CHAPTER XVIII


K. saw Sidney for only a moment on Christmas Day.This was when the gay
little sleigh had stopped in front of the house.Sidney had hurried radiantly in for a moment.Christine's parlor was
gay with firelight and noisy with chatter and with the clatter of her
tea-cups.K., lounging indolently in front of the fire, had turned to see Sidney
in the doorway, and leaped to his feet."I can't come in," she cried.I am out
sleigh-riding with Dr."Ask him in for a cup of tea," Christine called out."Here's Aunt
Harriet and mother and even Palmer!"Christine had aged during the last weeks, but she was putting up a brave
front.Sidney ran to the front door and called: "Will you come in for a cup of
tea?"As Sidney turned back into the house, she met Palmer.He had come out
in the hall, and had closed the door into the parlor behind him.His arm
was still in splints, and swung suspended in a gay silk sling.The sound of laughter came through the door faintly.The boy's face was
always with him."Better in some ways, but of course--"

"When are they going to operate?""He doesn't seem to blame you; he says it's all in the game.""Sidney, does Christine know that I was not alone that night?""If she guesses, it is not because of anything the boy has said.Out of the firelight, away from the chatter and the laughter, Palmer's
face showed worn and haggard.He put his free hand on Sidney's shoulder."I was thinking that perhaps if I went away--"

"That would be cowardly, wouldn't it?""If Christine would only say something and get it over with!She doesn't
sulk; I think she's really trying to be kind.She turns pale every time I touch her hand."All the light had died out of Sidney's face.Life was terrible, after
all--overwhelming.One did wrong things, and other people suffered; or
one was good, as her mother had been, and was left lonely, a widow, or
like Aunt Harriet.Things were so different from
what they seemed to be: Christine beyond the door, pouring tea and
laughing with her heart in ashes; Palmer beside her, faultlessly dressed
and wretched.The only one she thought really contented was K. He seemed
to move so calmly in his little orbit.He was always so steady, so
balanced.If life held no heights for him, at least it held no depths."There's only one thing, Palmer," she said gravely."Johnny Rosenfeld
is going to have his chance.If anybody in the world can save him, Max
Wilson can."The light of that speech was in her eyes when she went out to the sleigh
again.K. followed her out and tucked the robes in carefully about her.Is there any chance of having you home for supper?"I am to go on duty at six again."He waved them
off smilingly from the pavement, and went rather heavily back into the
house."Just how many men are in love with you, Sidney?"asked Max, as Peggy
started up the Street."No one that I know of, unless--"

"Exactly.Unless--"

"What I meant," she said with dignity, "is that unless one counts very
young men, and that isn't really love.""We'll leave out Joe Drummond and myself--for, of course, I am very
young.Who is in love with you besides Le Moyne?Any of the internes at
the hospital?"Le Moyne is not in love with me."There was such sincerity in her voice that Wilson was relieved.K., older than himself and more grave, had always had an odd attraction
for women.He had been frankly bored by them, but the fact had remained.And Max more than suspected that now, at last, he had been caught."Don't you really mean that you are in love with Le Moyne?"I am not in love with anybody; I haven't time
to be in love.So warm did the argument become that
they passed without seeing a middle-aged gentleman, short and rather
heavy set, struggling through a snowdrift on foot, and carrying in his
hand a dilapidated leather bag.But the cutter slipped by and left him knee-deep,
looking ruefully after them.Ed's mind, only a vague and
inarticulate regret.These things that came so easily to Max, the
affection of women, gay little irresponsibilities like the stealing
of Peggy and the sleigh, had never been his.If there was any faint
resentment, it was at himself.He had raised the boy wrong--he had
taught him to be selfish.Holding the bag high out of the drifts, he
made his slow progress up the Street.At something after two o'clock that night, K. put down his pipe
and listened.He had not been able to sleep since midnight.In his
dressing-gown he had sat by the small fire, thinking.The content of his
first few months on the Street was rapidly giving way to unrest.He
who had meant to cut himself off from life found himself again in close
touch with it; his eddy was deep with it.For the first time, he had begun to question the wisdom of what he had
done.It had taken courage, God knew,
to give up everything and come away.In a way, it would have taken more
courage to have stayed.He had thought, at first, that he could
fight down this love for Sidney.The
innocent touch of her hand on his arm, the moment when he had held her
in his arms after her mother's death, the thousand small contacts of her
returns to the little house--all these set his blood on fire.Under his quiet exterior K. fought many conflicts those winter
days--over his desk and ledger at the office, in his room alone,
with Harriet planning fresh triumphs beyond the partition, even by
Christine's fire, with Christine just across, sitting in silence and
watching his grave profile and steady eyes.He had a little picture of Sidney--a snap-shot that he had taken
himself.It showed Sidney minus a hand, which had been out of range when
the camera had been snapped, and standing on a steep declivity
which would have been quite a level had he held the camera straight.Nevertheless it was Sidney, her hair blowing about her, eyes looking
out, tender lips smiling.When she was not at home, it sat on K.'s
dresser, propped against his collar-box.When she was in the house, it
lay under the pin-cushion.Two o'clock in the morning, then, and K. in his dressing-gown, with the
picture propped, not against the collar-box, but against his lamp, where
he could see it.He sat forward in his chair, his hands folded around his knee, and
looked at it.He was trying to picture the Sidney of the photograph
in his old life--trying to find a place for her.There had been few women in his old life.There had been women who had cared for him, but he put them
impatiently out of his mind.Almost
before he had heaved his long legs out of the chair, she was tapping at
his door outside.Rosenfeld was standing in the lower hall,
a shawl about her shoulders."I've had word to go to the hospital," she said."I thought maybe you'd
go with me.It seems as if I can't stand it alone."Are you afraid to stay in the house alone?"He ran up the staircase to his room and flung on some clothing.Rosenfeld's sobs had become low moans; Christine stood
helplessly over her."I am terribly sorry," she said--"terribly sorry!When I think whose
fault all this is!"Rosenfeld put out a work-hardened hand and caught Christine's
fingers.I guess you and I
understand each other.K. never forgot the scene in the small emergency ward to which Johnny
had been taken.Under the white lights his boyish figure looked
strangely long.There was a group around the bed--Max Wilson, two or
three internes, the night nurse on duty, and the Head.Sitting just inside the door on a straight chair was Sidney--such a
Sidney as he never had seen before, her face colorless, her eyes wide
and unseeing, her hands clenched in her lap.When he stood beside her,
she did not move or look up.The group around the bed had parted to
admit Mrs.Only Sidney and K. remained by
the door, isolated, alone."You must not take it like that, dear.But, after
all, in that condition--"

It was her first knowledge that he was there.Her voice was dreary, inflectionless."They say I gave him the wrong medicine; that he's dying; that I
murdered him."I came on duty at six o'clock and gave the
medicines.When the night nurse came on at seven, everything was all
right.The medicine-tray was just as it should be.I
went to say good-night to him and he--he was asleep.I didn't give him
anything but what was on the tray," she finished piteously."I looked at
the label; I always look."By a shifting of the group around the bed, K.'s eyes looked for a moment
directly into Carlotta's.Just for a moment; then the crowd closed up
again.It was well for Carlotta that it did.She looked as if she had
seen a ghost--closed her eyes, even reeled."Get some one to
take her place."After all, the presence of this man in this room
at such a time meant nothing.He was Sidney's friend, that was all.It was the boy's weakened condition that was turning her
revenge into tragedy."I am all right," she pleaded across the bed to the Head.He had done everything he knew without
result.The boy, rousing for an instant, would lapse again into stupor.With a healthy man they could have tried more vigorous measures--could
have forced him to his feet and walked him about, could have beaten him
with knotted towels dipped in ice-water.But the wrecked body on the bed
could stand no such heroic treatment.It was Le Moyne, after all, who saved Johnny Rosenfeld's life.For, when
staff and nurses had exhausted all their resources, he stepped forward
with a quiet word that brought the internes to their feet astonished.There was a new treatment for such cases--it had been tried abroad."Try it, for Heaven's sake," he said.The apparatus was not in the house--must be extemporized, indeed, at
last, of odds and ends from the operating-room.K. did the work, his
long fingers deft and skillful--while Mrs.Rosenfeld knelt by the bed
with her face buried; while Sidney sat, dazed and bewildered, on her
little chair inside the door; while night nurses tiptoed along the
corridor, and the night watchman stared incredulous from outside the
door.When the two great rectangles that were the emergency ward windows
had turned from mirrors reflecting the room to gray rectangles in the
morning light; Johnny Rosenfeld opened his eyes and spoke the first
words that marked his return from the dark valley.When it was clear that the boy would live, K. rose stiffly from the
bedside and went over to Sidney's chair."He's all right now," he said--"as all right as he can be, poor lad!"How strange that you should know such a thing.The internes, talking among themselves, had wandered down to their
dining-room for early coffee.Wilson was giving a few last instructions
as to the boy's care.'s hand and
held it to her lips.The iron repression of the night, of months indeed,
fell away before her simple caress."My dear, my dear," he said huskily."Anything that I can do--for
you--at any time--"

It was after Sidney had crept like a broken thing to her room that
Carlotta Harrison and K. came face to face.Johnny was quite conscious
by that time, a little blue around the lips, but valiantly cheerful."More things can happen to a fellow than I ever knew there was!"he
said to his mother, and submitted rather sheepishly to her tears and
caresses."You were always a good boy, Johnny," she said."Just you get well
enough to come home.I'll take care of you the rest of my life.We will
get you a wheel-chair when you can be about, and I can take you out in
the park when I come from work.""I'll be passenger and you'll be chauffeur, ma."Le Moyne is going to get your father sent up again.With sixty-five
cents a day and what I make, we'll get along.""Oh, Johnny, if I could see you coming in the door again and yelling
'mother' and'supper' in one breath!"The meeting between Carlotta and Le Moyne was very quiet.She had been
making a sort of subconscious impression on the retina of his mind
during all the night.It would be difficult to tell when he actually
knew her.When the preparations for moving Johnny back to the big ward had been
made, the other nurses left the room, and Carlotta and the boy were
together.K. stopped her on her way to the door.Edwardes here; my name is Le Moyne.""I have not seen you since you left St."No; I--I rested for a few months.""I suppose they do not know that you were--that you have had any
previous hospital experience.""I shall not tell them, of course."And thus, by simple mutual consent, it was arranged that each should
respect the other's confidence.There had been a time, just before dawn,
when she had had one of those swift revelations that sometimes come at
the end of a long night.The boy was
very low, hardly breathing.Her past stretched behind her, a series of
small revenges and passionate outbursts, swift yieldings, slow remorse.She would have given every hope she had in the
world, just then, for Sidney's stainless past.She hated herself with that deadliest loathing that comes of complete
self-revelation.And she carried to her room the knowledge that the night's struggle had
been in vain--that, although Johnny Rosenfeld would live, she had gained
nothing by what he had suffered.The whole night had shown her the
hopelessness of any stratagem to win Wilson from his new allegiance.She
had surprised him in the hallway, watching Sidney's slender figure
as she made her way up the stairs to her room.Never, in all his past
overtures to her, had she seen that look in his eyes.CHAPTER XIX


To Harriet Kennedy, Sidney's sentence of thirty days' suspension came
as a blow.K. broke the news to her that evening before the time for
Sidney's arrival.The little household was sharing in Harriet's prosperity.Katie had
a helper now, a little Austrian girl named Mimi.And Harriet had
established on the Street the innovation of after-dinner coffee.It was
over the after-dinner coffee that K. made his announcement."What do you mean by saying she is coming home for thirty days?"Not ill, although she is not quite well.The fact is, Harriet,"--for
it was "Harriet" and "K."by this time,--"there has been a sort of
semi-accident up at the hospital.It hasn't resulted seriously, but--"

Harriet put down the apostle-spoon in her hand and stared across at him."There was a mistake about the medicine, and she was blamed; that's
all.""She'd better come home and stay home," said Harriet shortly."I hope it
doesn't get in the papers.This dressmaking business is a funny sort of
thing.One word against you or any of your family, and the crowd's off
somewhere else.""There's nothing against Sidney," K. reminded her.It seems it's a
mere matter of discipline.Somebody made a mistake, and they cannot let
such a thing go by.But he believes, as I do, that it was not Sidney."However Harriet had hardened herself against the girl's arrival, all she
had meant to say fled when she saw Sidney's circled eyes and pathetic
mouth.And took her corseted
bosom.For the time at least, Sidney's world had gone to pieces about her.All
her brave vaunt of service faded before her disgrace.When Christine would have seen her, she kept her door locked and asked
for just that one evening alone.But after Harriet had retired, and
Mimi, the Austrian, had crept out to the corner to mail a letter back to
Gratz, Sidney unbolted her door and listened in the little upper hall.Harriet, her head in a towel, her face carefully cold-creamed, had gone
to bed; but K.'s light, as usual, was shining over the transom.Sidney
tiptoed to the door."May I come in and talk to you?"He turned and took a quick survey of the room.The picture was against
the collar-box.But he took the risk and held the door wide.Sidney came in and sat down by the fire.By being adroit he managed to
slip the little picture over and under the box before she saw it.It is
doubtful if she would have realized its significance, had she seen it."I've been thinking things over," she said."It seems to me I'd better
not go back.""That would be foolish, wouldn't it, when you have done so well?And,
besides, since you are not guilty, Sidney--"

"I didn't do it!"I can't keep on; that's all there is to it.All
last night, in the emergency ward, I felt it going.I
kept saying to myself: 'You didn't do it, you didn't do it'; and all the
time something inside of me was saying, 'Not now, perhaps; but sometime
you may.'"Poor K., who had reasoned all this out for himself and had come to the
same impasse!"To go on like this, feeling that one has life and death in one's hand,
and then perhaps some day to make a mistake like that!"She looked up at
him forlornly."I am just not brave enough, K.""Wouldn't it be braver to keep on?Her world was in pieces about her, and she felt alone in a wide and
empty place.And, because her nerves were drawn taut until they were
ready to snap, Sidney turned on him shrewishly."I think you are all afraid I will come back to stay.Nobody really
wants me anywhere--in all the world!Not at the hospital, not here, not
anyplace."When you say that nobody wants you," said K., not very steadily, "I--I
think you are making a mistake."The only person
who ever really wanted me was my mother, and I went away and left her!"She scanned his face closely, and, reading there something she did not
understand, she  suddenly."No; I do not mean Joe Drummond."If he had found any encouragement in her face, he would have gone on
recklessly; but her blank eyes warned him."If you mean Max Wilson," said Sidney, "you are entirely wrong.He's not
in love with me--not, that is, any more than he is in love with a
dozen girls.He likes to be with me--oh, I know that; but that doesn't
mean--anything else.Anyhow, after this disgrace--"

"There is no disgrace, child.""He'll think me careless, at the least."You say he likes to be with you.Sidney had been sitting in a low chair by the fire.She rose with a
sudden passionate movement.In the informality of the household, she,
had visited K. in her dressing-gown and slippers; and now she stood
before him, a tragic young figure, clutching the folds of her gown
across her breast."I worship him, K.," she said tragically."When I see him coming, I want
to get down and let him walk on me.I
know the very way he rings for the elevator.When I see him in the
operating-room, cool and calm while every one else is flustered and
excited, he--he looks like a god."Then, half ashamed of her outburst, she turned her back to him and stood
gazing at the small coal fire.It was as well for K. that she did not
see his face.For that one moment the despair that was in him shone in
his eyes.He glanced around the shabby little room, at the sagging bed,
the collar-box, the pincushion, the old marble-topped bureau under which
Reginald had formerly made his nest, at his untidy table, littered with
pipes and books, at the image in the mirror of his own tall figure,
stooped and weary."You're sure it's not
just--glamour, Sidney?"Her voice was muffled, and he knew then that
she was crying.Tears, of course, except in the privacy
of one's closet, were not ethical on the Street."Give me a handkerchief," said Sidney in a muffled tone, and the little
scene was broken into while K. searched through a bureau drawer.Then:

"It's all over, anyhow, since this.If he'd really cared he'd have come
over to-night.Back in a circle she came inevitably to her suspension.She would never
go back, she said passionately.She was innocent, had been falsely
accused.If they could think such a thing about her, she didn't want to
be in their old hospital.K. questioned her, alternately soothing and probing.I have given him his medicines dozens of times.""Who else had access to the medicine closet?""Carlotta Harrison carried the keys, of course.I was off duty from four
to six.When Carlotta left the ward, the probationer would have them.""Have you reason to think that either one of these girls would wish you
harm?""None whatever," began Sidney vehemently; and then, checking
herself,--"unless--but that's rather ridiculous.""I've sometimes thought that Carlotta--but I am sure she is perfectly
fair with me.Even if she--if she--"

"Yes?"Wilson, I don't believe--Why, K., she wouldn't!"Murder, of course," said K., "in intention, anyhow.I'm only trying to find out whose mistake it was."Soon after that she said good-night and went out.She turned in the
doorway and smiled tremulously back at him."You have done me a lot of good.With a quick movement that was one of her charms, Sidney suddenly closed
the door and slipped back into the room.K., hearing the door close,
thought she had gone, and dropped heavily into a chair.said Sidney suddenly from behind him,
and, bending over, she kissed him on the cheek.The next instant the door had closed behind her, and K. was left alone
to such wretchedness and bliss as the evening had brought him.On toward morning, Harriet, who slept but restlessly in her towel,
wakened to the glare of his light over the transom."I wish you wouldn't go to
sleep and let your light burn!"K., surmising the towel and cold cream, had the tact not to open his
door."I am not asleep, Harriet, and I am sorry about the light.Before he extinguished the light, he walked over to the old dresser and
surveyed himself in the glass.Two nights without sleep and much anxiety
had told on him.He looked old, haggard; infinitely tired.Mentally he
compared himself with Wilson, flushed with success, erect, triumphant,
almost insolent.Nothing had more certainly told him the hopelessness
of his love for Sidney than her good-night kiss.He drew a long breath and proceeded
to undress in the dark.Joe Drummond came to see Sidney the next day.She would have avoided
him if she could, but Mimi had ushered him up to the sewing-room boudoir
before she had time to escape.She had not seen the boy for two months,
and the change in him startled her.He was thinner, rather hectic,
scrupulously well dressed.she said, and then: "Won't you sit down?"He dramatized himself, as he had that
night the June before when he had asked Sidney to marry him.He offered no conventional greeting whatever;
but, after surveying her briefly, her black gown, the lines around her
eyes:--

"You're not going back to that place, of course?""Then somebody's got to decide for you.The thing for you to do is to
stay right here, Sidney.Nobody here
would ever accuse you of trying to murder anybody."In spite of herself, Sidney smiled a little.It was a mistake about the
medicines.His love was purely selfish, for he brushed aside her protest as if she
had not spoken."You give me the word and I'll go and get your things; I've got a car of
my own now.""But, Joe, they have only done what they thought was right.Whoever made
it, there was a mistake.""You don't mean that you are going to stand for this sort of thing?Every time some fool makes a mistake, are they going to blame it on
you?"I can't talk to you
if you explode like a rocket all the time."Her matter-of-fact tone had its effect.He advanced into the room, but
he still scorned a chair."I guess you've been wondering why you haven't heard from me," he said."I've seen you more than you've seen me."The idea of espionage is always repugnant, and
to have a rejected lover always in the offing, as it were, was
disconcerting."I wish you would be just a little bit sensible, Joe.It's so silly of
you, really.It's not because you care for me; it's really because you
care for yourself.""You can't look at me and say that, Sid."He ran his finger around his collar--an old gesture; but the collar was
very loose."I'm just eating my heart out for you, and that's the truth.Everywhere I go, people say, 'There's the fellow Sidney
Page turned down when she went to the hospital.'I've got so I keep off
the Street as much as I can."Sidney was half alarmed, half irritated.This wild, excited boy was not
the doggedly faithful youth she had always known.It seemed to her
that he was hardly sane--that underneath his quiet manner and carefully
repressed voice there lurked something irrational, something she could
not cope with."But what do you want me to do?If you'd
only sit down--"

"I want you to come home.I just want
you to come back, so that things will be the way they used to be.Now
that they have turned you out--"

"They've done nothing of the sort."Because you love the hospital, or because you love somebody connected
with the hospital?"Sidney was thoroughly angry by this time, angry and reckless.She had
come through so much that every nerve was crying in passionate protest."If it will make you understand things any better," she cried, "I am
going back for both reasons!"But her words seemed, surprisingly
enough, to steady him."Then, as far as I am concerned, it's all over, is it?"Suddenly:--

"You think Christine has her hands full with Palmer, don't you?Well,
if you take Max Wilson, you're going to have more trouble than Christine
ever dreamed of.I can tell you some things about him now that will make
you think twice.""Every word that you say shows me how right I am in not marrying you,
Joe," she said."Real men do not say those things about each other under
any circumstances.I don't want you to
come back until you have grown up."He was very white, but he picked up his hat and went to the door."I guess I AM crazy," he said."I've been wanting to go away, but mother
raises such a fuss--I'll not annoy you any more."He reached in his pocket and, pulling out a small box, held it toward
her."Reginald," he said solemnly.Some boys caught
him in the park, and I brought him home."He left her standing there speechless with surprise, with the box in her
hand, and ran down the stairs and out into the Street.At the foot of
the steps he almost collided with Dr.I'm glad
you've made it up."CHAPTER XX


Winter relaxed its clutch slowly that year.March was bitterly cold;
even April found the roads still frozen and the hedgerows clustered with
ice.But at mid-day there was spring in the air.In the courtyard of the
hospital, convalescents sat on the benches and watched for robins.The
fountain, which had frozen out, was being repaired.Here and there on
ward window-sills tulips opened their gaudy petals to the sun.Harriet had gone abroad for a flying trip in March and came back laden
with new ideas, model gowns, and fresh enthusiasm.She carried out and
planted flowers on her sister's grave, and went back to her work with a
feeling of duty done.A combination of crocuses and snow on the ground
had given her an inspiration for a gown.She drew it in pencil on an
envelope on her way back in the street car.Grace Irving, having made good during the white sales, had been sent to
the spring cottons.The day she
sold Sidney material for a simple white gown, she was very happy.Once
a customer brought her a bunch of primroses.All day she kept them under
the counter in a glass of water, and at evening she took them to Johnny
Rosenfeld, still lying prone in the hospital.On Sidney, on K., and on Christine the winter had left its mark heavily.Christine, readjusting her life to new conditions, was graver, more
thoughtful.'s guidance, she
had given up the "Duchess" and was reading real books.She was thinking
real thoughts, too, for the first time in her life.Sidney, as tender as ever, had lost a little of the radiance from her
eyes; her voice had deepened.Where she had been a pretty girl, she
was now lovely.She was back in the hospital again, this time in the
children's ward.K., going in one day to take Johnny Rosenfeld a basket
of fruit, saw her there with a child in her arms, and a light in her
eyes that he had never seen before.It hurt him, rather--things being as
they were with him.With the opening of spring the little house at Hillfoot took on fresh
activities.Tillie was house-cleaning with great thoroughness.She
scrubbed carpets, took down the clean curtains, and put them up again
freshly starched.It was as if she found in sheer activity and fatigue a
remedy for her uneasiness.The impeccable character of the little
house had been against it.Schwitter had a little bar and
served the best liquors he could buy; but he discouraged rowdiness--had
been known to refuse to sell to boys under twenty-one and to men who had
already overindulged.The word went about that Schwitter's was no place
for a good time.Even Tillie's chicken and waffles failed against this
handicap.By the middle of April the house-cleaning was done.One or two motor
parties had come out, dined sedately and wined moderately, and had gone
back to the city again.The
roads dried up, robins filled the trees with their noisy spring songs,
and still business continued dull.By the first day of May, Tillie's uneasiness had become certainty.Schwitter, coming in from the early milking, found her
sitting in the kitchen, her face buried in her apron.He put down the
milk-pails and, going over to her, put a hand on her head."I guess there's no mistake, then?""There's no mistake," said poor Tillie into her apron.He bent down and kissed the back of her neck.Then, when she failed to
brighten, he tiptoed around the kitchen, poured the milk into pans,
and rinsed the buckets, working methodically in his heavy way.The
tea-kettle had boiled dry.Then:--

"Do you want to see a doctor?""I'd better see somebody," she said, without looking up."And--don't
think I'm blaming you.As far as
that goes, I've wanted a child right along.It isn't the trouble I am
thinking of either."He made some tea
clumsily and browned her a piece of toast.When he had put them on one
end of the kitchen table, he went over to her again."I guess I'd ought to have thought of this before, but all I thought of
was trying to get a little happiness out of life.And,"--he stroked
her arm,--"as far as I am concerned, it's been worth while, Tillie.No
matter what I've had to do, I've always looked forward to coming back
here to you in the evening.Maybe I don't say it enough, but I guess you
know I feel it all right."Without looking up, she placed her hand over his."I guess we started wrong," he went on."You can't build happiness on
what isn't right.You and I can manage well enough; but now that there's
going to be another, it looks different, somehow."After that morning Tillie took up her burden stoically.The hope of
motherhood alternated with black fits of depression.She sang at her
work, to burst out into sudden tears.Schwitter had given up his nursery
business; but the motorists who came to Hillfoot did not come back.When, at last, he took the horse and buggy and drove about the country
for orders, he was too late.Other nurserymen had been before him;
shrubberies and orchards were already being set out.The second payment
on his mortgage would be due in July.By the middle of May they were
frankly up against it.Schwitter at last dared to put the situation into
words."We're not making good, Til," he said.We are too decent; that's what's the matter with us."With all her sophistication, Tillie was vastly ignorant of life."We'll have to keep a sort of hotel," he said lamely."Sell to everybody
that comes along, and--if parties want to stay over-night--"

Tillie's white face turned crimson."If it's bad weather, and they're married--"

"How are we to know if they are married or not?"But the
situation was not less acute.There were two or three unfurnished rooms
on the second floor.He began to make tentative suggestions as to their
furnishing.Once he got a catalogue from an installment house, and tried
to hide it from her.She burned it in the kitchen
stove.Schwitter himself was ashamed; but the idea obsessed him.Other people
fattened on the frailties of human nature.Two miles away, on the other
road, was a public house that had netted the owner ten thousand dollars
profit the year before.He was not as young as he had been; there was the expense of keeping
his wife--he had never allowed her to go into the charity ward at the
asylum.Now that there was going to be a child, there would be three
people dependent upon him.One night, after Tillie was asleep, he slipped noiselessly into his
clothes and out to the barn, where he hitched up the horse with nervous
fingers.Tillie never learned of that midnight excursion to the "Climbing Rose,"
two miles away.Lights blazed in every window; a dozen automobiles were
parked before the barn.From the bar came
the jingle of glasses and loud, cheerful conversation.When Schwitter turned the horse's head back toward Hillfoot, his
mind was made up.He would furnish the upper rooms; he would bring a
barkeeper from town--these people wanted mixed drinks; he could get a
second-hand piano somewhere.Tillie's rebellion was instant and complete.When she found him
determined, she made the compromise that her condition necessitated.She
could not leave him, but she would not stay in the rehabilitated little
house.When, a week after Schwitter's visit to the "Climbing Rose," an
installment van arrived from town with the new furniture, Tillie
moved out to what had been the harness-room of the old barn and there
established herself."I am not leaving you," she told him."I don't even know that I am
blaming you.But I am not going to have anything to do with it, and
that's flat."So it happened that K., making a spring pilgrimage to see Tillie,
stopped astounded in the road.The weather was warm, and he carried
his Norfolk coat over his arm.The little house was bustling; a dozen
automobiles were parked in the barnyard.The bar was crowded, and a
barkeeper in a white coat was mixing drinks with the casual indifference
of his kind.There were tables under the trees on the lawn, and a new
sign on the gate.Even Schwitter bore a new look of prosperity.Over his schooner of beer
K. gathered something of the story."I'm not proud of it, Mr.I've come to do a good many things
the last year or so that I never thought I would do.First I took Tillie away from her good position, and after
that nothing went right.Then there were things coming on"--he looked at
K. anxiously--"that meant more expense.I would be glad if you wouldn't
say anything about it at Mrs."I'll not speak of it, of course."It was then, when K. asked for Tillie, that Mr.Schwitter's unhappiness
became more apparent."She wouldn't stand for it," he said."She moved out the day I furnished
the rooms upstairs and got the piano."I--I'll take you
out there, if you would like to see her."K. shrewdly surmised that Tillie would prefer to see him alone, under
the circumstances."I guess I can find her," he said, and rose from the little table."If you--if you can say anything to help me out, sir, I'd appreciate it.Of course, she understands how I am driven.But--especially if you would
tell her that the Street doesn't know--"

"I'll do all I can," K. promised, and followed the path to the barn.Tillie received him with a certain dignity.The little harness-room
was very comfortable.A white iron bed in a corner, a flat table with
a mirror above it, a rocking-chair, and a sewing-machine furnished the
room."I wouldn't stand for it," she said simply; "so here I am.There being but one chair, she sat on the bed.The room was littered
with small garments in the making.She made no attempt to conceal them;
rather, she pointed to them with pride.He's got a
hired girl at the house.It was hard enough to sew at first, with me
making two right sleeves almost every time."Then, seeing his kindly eye
on her: "Well, it's happened, Mr."You're going to be a very good mother, Tillie."K., who also needed cheering
that spring day, found his consolation in seeing her brighten under the
small gossip of the Street.The deaf-and-dumb book agent had taken on
life insurance as a side issue, and was doing well; the grocery store at
the corner was going to be torn down, and over the new store there
were to be apartments; Reginald had been miraculously returned, and was
building a new nest under his bureau; Harriet Kennedy had been to Paris,
and had brought home six French words and a new figure.Outside the open door the big barn loomed cool and shadowy, full of
empty spaces where later the hay would be stored; anxious mother hens
led their broods about; underneath in the horse stable the restless
horses pawed in their stalls.From where he sat, Le Moyne could see only
the round breasts of the two hills, the fresh green of the orchard the
cows in a meadow beyond."I've had more time to think since I
moved out than I ever had in my life before.When the
noise is worst down at the house, I look at the hills there and--"

There were great thoughts in her mind--that the hills meant God, and
that in His good time perhaps it would all come right."The hills help a lot," she repeated.Tillie's work-basket lay near him.He picked up one of the
little garments.In his big hands it looked small, absurd."I--I want to tell you something, Tillie.Don't count on it too much;
but Mrs.Schwitter has been failing rapidly for the last month or two."I wanted to see things work out right for you."All the color had faded from Tillie's face."You're very good to me, Mr."I don't wish the poor
soul any harm, but--oh, my God!if she's going, let it be before the
next four months are over."K. had fallen into the habit, after his long walks, of dropping into
Christine's little parlor for a chat before he went upstairs.Those
early spring days found Harriet Kennedy busy late in the evenings, and,
save for Christine and K., the house was practically deserted.The breach between Palmer and Christine was steadily widening.She was
too proud to ask him to spend more of his evenings with her.On those
occasions when he voluntarily stayed at home with her, he was so
discontented that he drove her almost to distraction.Although she was
convinced that he was seeing nothing of the girl who had been with
him the night of the accident, she did not trust him.Not that girl,
perhaps, but there were others.Into Christine's little parlor, then, K. turned, the evening after he
had seen Tillie.She was reading by the lamp, and the door into the hall
stood open."Come in," she said, as he hesitated in the doorway."There's a brush in the drawer of the hat-rack--although I don't really
mind how you look."The little room always cheered K. Its warmth and light appealed to his
aesthetic sense; after the bareness of his bedroom, it spelled luxury.And perhaps, to be entirely frank, there was more than physical comfort
and satisfaction in the evenings he spent in Christine's firelit parlor.He was entirely masculine, and her evident pleasure in his society
gratified him.He had fallen into a way of thinking of himself as a sort
of older brother to all the world because he was a sort of older brother
to Sidney.The evenings with her did something to reinstate him in his
own self-esteem.It was subtle, psychological, but also it was very
human."Here's a chair, and here are
cigarettes and there are matches.But, for once, K. declined the chair.He stood in front of the fireplace
and looked down at her, his head bent slightly to one side."I wonder if you would like to do a very kind thing," he said
unexpectedly."Something much more trouble and not so pleasant."When she was with him, when his steady eyes
looked down at her, small affectations fell away.She was more genuine
with K. than with anyone else, even herself."Tell me what it is, or shall I promise first?""I want you to promise just one thing: to keep a secret."Christine was not over-intelligent, perhaps, but she was shrewd.That Le
Moyne's past held a secret she had felt from the beginning.I want you to go out to see her."The Street did not go out to see women in
Tillie's situation.She's going to have a child,
Christine; and she has had no one to talk to but her hus--but Mr.I'd really rather not go, K. Not,"
she hastened to set herself right in his eyes--"not that I feel any
unwillingness to see her.But--what in the
world shall I say to her?"It had been rather a long time since Christine had been accused
of having a kind heart.Not that she was unkind, but in all her
self-centered young life there had been little call on her sympathies."I wish I were as good as you think I am."Then Le Moyne spoke briskly:--

"I'll tell you how to get there; perhaps I would better write it."He moved over to Christine's small writing-table and, seating himself,
proceeded to write out the directions for reaching Hillfoot.Behind him, Christine had taken his place on the hearth-rug and stood
watching his head in the light of the desk-lamp."What a strong, quiet
face it is," she thought.Why did she get the impression of such a
tremendous reserve power in this man who was a clerk, and a clerk only?Behind him she made a quick, unconscious gesture of appeal, both hands
out for an instant.She dropped them guiltily as K. rose with the paper
in his hand."I've drawn a sort of map of the roads," he began."You see, this--"

Christine was looking, not at the paper, but up at him."I wonder if you know, K.," she said, "what a lucky woman the woman will
be who marries you?""I wonder how long I could hypnotize her into thinking that.""I've had time to do a little thinking lately," she said, without
bitterness.I've been looking back,
wondering if I ever thought that about him.I wonder--"

She checked herself abruptly and took the paper from his hand."I'll go to see Tillie, of course," she consented."It is like you to
have found her."Although she picked up the book that she had been reading
with the evident intention of discussing it, her thoughts were still on
Tillie, on Palmer, on herself.After a moment:--

"Has it ever occurred to you how terribly mixed up things are?Can you think of anybody on it that--that things
have gone entirely right with?""It's a little world of its own, of course," said K., "and it has plenty
of contact points with life.But wherever one finds people, many or few,
one finds all the elements that make up life--joy and sorrow, birth and
death, and even tragedy.That's rather trite, isn't it?""To a certain extent they make their own
fates.But when you think of the women on the Street,--Tillie,
Harriet Kennedy, Sidney Page, myself, even Mrs.Rosenfeld back in the
alley,--somebody else moulds things for us, and all we can do is to sit
back and suffer.I am beginning to think the world is a terrible place,
K. Why do people so often marry the wrong people?Why can't a man
care for one woman and only one all his life?Why--why is it all so
complicated?""There are men who care for only one woman all their lives.""You're that sort, aren't you?""I don't want to put myself on any pinnacle.If I cared enough for
a woman to marry her, I'd hope to--But we are being very tragic,
Christine."There's going to be another mistake, K., unless you stop
it."He tried to leaven the conversation with a little fun."If you're going to ask me to interfere between Mrs.McKee and the
deaf-and-dumb book and insurance agent, I shall do nothing of the sort.She can both speak and hear enough for both of them."He's mad about her, K.; and, because
she's the sort she is, he'll probably be mad about her all his life,
even if he marries her.But he'll not be true to her; I know the type
now."K. leaned back with a flicker of pain in his eyes.Astute as he was, he did not suspect that Christine was using this
method to fathom his feeling for Sidney.But he had himself in hand by this time, and she learned nothing from
either his voice or his eyes."I'm not in a position to marry anybody.Even
if Sidney cared for me, which she doesn't, of course--"

"Then you don't intend to interfere?You're going to let the Street see
another failure?""I think you can understand," said K. rather wearily, "that if I cared
less, Christine, it would be easier to interfere."After all, Christine had known this, or surmised it, for weeks.But it
hurt like a fresh stab in an old wound.It was K. who spoke again after
a pause:--

"The deadly hard thing, of course, is to sit by and see things happening
that one--that one would naturally try to prevent.""I don't believe that you have always been of those who only stand and
wait," said Christine."Sometime, K., when you know me better and like
me better, I want you to tell me about it, will you?"When I discovered that I
was unfit to hold that trust any longer, I quit.But Christine's eyes were on
him often that evening, puzzled, rather sad.They talked of books, of music--Christine played well in a dashing way.K. had brought her soft, tender little things, and had stood over her
until her noisy touch became gentle.She played for him a little, while
he sat back in the big chair with his hand screening his eyes.When, at last, he rose and picked up his cap; it was nine o'clock."I've taken your whole evening," he said remorsefully."Why don't you
tell me I am a nuisance and send me off?"Christine was still at the piano, her hands on the keys.She spoke
without looking at him:--

"You're never a nuisance, K., and--"

"You'll go out to see Tillie, won't you?"But I'll not go under false pretenses.I am going quite frankly
because you want me to.""I forgot to tell you," she went on."Father has given Palmer five
thousand dollars.He's going to buy a share in a business."I don't believe much in Palmer's business ventures."Underneath it he divined strain and
repression."I hate to go and leave you alone," he said at last from the door."Have
you any idea when Palmer will be back?"Stand behind me; I
don't want to see you, and I want to tell you something."He did as she bade him, rather puzzled."I think I am a fool for saying this.Perhaps I am spoiling the only
chance I have to get any happiness out of life.I was terribly unhappy, K., and then you
came into my life, and I--now I listen for your step in the hall.I
can't be a hypocrite any longer, K."When he stood behind her, silent and not moving, she turned slowly about
and faced him.He towered there in the little room, grave eyes on hers."It's a long time since I have had a woman friend, Christine," he said
soberly.In a good many
ways, I'd not care to look ahead if it were not for you.I value our
friendship so much that I--"

"That you don't want me to spoil it," she finished for him."I know
you don't care for me, K., not the way I--But I wanted you to know.It
doesn't hurt a good man to know such a thing.And it--isn't going to
stop your coming here, is it?""Of course not," said K. heartily."But to-morrow, when we are both
clear-headed, we will talk this over.You are mistaken about this thing,
Christine; I am sure of that.Things have not been going well, and just
because I am always around, and all that sort of thing, you think things
that aren't really so.He tried to make her smile up at him.If she had cried, things might have been different for every one; for
perhaps K. would have taken her in his arms.He was heart-hungry enough,
those days, for anything.And perhaps, too, being intuitive, Christine
felt this.But she had no mind to force him into a situation against his
will."It is because you are good," she said, and held out her hand.Le Moyne took it and bent over and kissed it lightly.There was in
the kiss all that he could not say of respect, of affection and
understanding."Good-night, Christine," he said, and went into the hall and upstairs.The lamp was not lighted in his room, but the street light glowed
through the windows.Once again the waving fronds of the ailanthus tree
flung ghostly shadows on the walls.There was a faint sweet odor of
blossoms, so soon to become rank and heavy.Over the floor in a wild zigzag darted a strip of white paper which
disappeared under the bureau.CHAPTER XXI


Sidney went into the operating-room late in the spring as the result of
a conversation between the younger Wilson and the Head."When are you going to put my protegee into the operating-room?"asked
Wilson, meeting Miss Gregg in a corridor one bright, spring afternoon."That usually comes in the second year, Dr."That isn't a rule, is it?"Miss Page is very young, and of course there are other
girls who have not yet had the experience.But, if you make the
request--"

"I am going to have some good cases soon.I'll not make a request, of
course; but, if you see fit, it would be good training for Miss Page."Miss Gregg went on, knowing perfectly that at his next operation Dr.Wilson would expect Sidney Page in the operating-room.The other doctors
were not so exigent.She would have liked to have all the staff old and
settled, like Dr.These young men came in
and tore things up.The
butter had been bad--she must speak to the matron.The sterilizer in
the operating-room was out of order--that meant a quarrel with the chief
engineer.Requisitions were too heavy--that meant going around to the
wards and suggesting to the head nurses that lead pencils and bandages
and adhesive plaster and safety-pins cost money.It was particularly inconvenient to move Sidney just then.Carlotta
Harrison was off duty, ill.She had been ailing for a month, and now she
was down with a temperature.As the Head went toward Sidney's ward,
her busy mind was playing her nurses in their wards like pieces on a
checkerboard.Sidney went into the operating-room that afternoon.For her blue
uniform, kerchief, and cap she exchanged the hideous operating-room
garb: long, straight white gown with short sleeves and mob-cap,
gray-white from many sterilizations.But the ugly costume seemed to
emphasize her beauty, as the habit of a nun often brings out the placid
saintliness of her face.The relationship between Sidney and Max had reached that point that
occurs in all relationships between men and women: when things must
either go forward or go back, but cannot remain as they are.The
condition had existed for the last three months.As a matter of fact, Wilson could not go ahead.The situation with
Carlotta had become tense, irritating.He felt that she stood ready
to block any move he made.He would not go back, and he dared not go
forward.If Sidney was puzzled, she kept it bravely to herself.In her little
room at night, with the door carefully locked, she tried to think things
out.There were a few treasures that she looked over regularly: a dried
flower from the Christmas roses; a label that he had pasted playfully
on the back of her hand one day after the rush of surgical dressings was
over and which said "Rx, Take once and forever."There was another piece of paper over which Sidney spent much time.It
was a page torn out of an order book, and it read: "Sigsbee may have
light diet; Rosenfeld massage."Underneath was written, very small:

     "You are the most beautiful person in the world."Two reasons had prompted Wilson to request to have Sidney in the
operating-room.He wanted her with him, and he wanted her to see him at
work: the age-old instinct of the male to have his woman see him at his
best.He was in high spirits that first day of Sidney's operating-room
experience.For the time at least, Carlotta was out of the way.Her
somber eyes no longer watched him.Once he looked up from his work and
glanced at Sidney where she stood at strained attention.She  under the eyes that were turned on her."A great many of them faint on the first day.We sometimes have them
lying all over the floor."He challenged Miss Gregg with his eyes, and she reproved him with a
shake of her head, as she might a bad boy.One way and another, he managed to turn the attention of the
operating-room to Sidney several times.It suited his whim, and it did
more than that: it gave him a chance to speak to her in his teasing way.Sidney came through the operation as if she had been through fire--taut
as a string, rather pale, but undaunted.But when the last case had been
taken out, Max dropped his bantering manner.The internes were looking
over instruments; the nurses were busy on the hundred and one tasks of
clearing up; so he had a chance for a word with her alone."I am proud of you, Sidney; you came through it like a soldier."A nurse was coming toward him; he had only a moment."I shall leave a note in the mail-box," he said quickly, and proceeded
with the scrubbing of his hands which signified the end of the day's
work.The operations had lasted until late in the afternoon.The night nurses
had taken up their stations; prayers were over.The internes were
gathered in the smoking-room, threshing over the day's work, as was
their custom.When Sidney was free, she went to the office for the note.It was very brief:--

I have something I want to say to you, dear.I never see you alone at home any more.If you can get off for an
hour, won't you take the trolley to the end of Division Street?I'll be
there with the car at eight-thirty, and I promise to have you back by
ten o'clock.No one saw her as she stood by the mail-box.The
ticking of the office clock, the heavy rumble of a dray outside, the
roll of the ambulance as it went out through the gateway, and in her
hand the realization of what she had never confessed as a hope, even to
herself!He, the great one, was going to stoop to her.It had been in
his eyes that afternoon; it was there, in his letter, now.To get out of her uniform and into
street clothing, fifteen minutes; on the trolley, another fifteen.But she did not meet him, after all.Miss Wardwell met her in the upper
hall."She has been waiting for hours--ever since you went to the
operating-room."Sidney sighed, but she went to Carlotta at once.The girl's condition
was puzzling the staff.--which is hospital for
"typhoid restrictions."has apathy, generally, and Carlotta
was not apathetic.Sidney found her tossing restlessly on her high white
bed, and put her cool hand over Carlotta's hot one.Then, seeing her operating-room uniform: "You've been
THERE, have you?""Is there anything I can do, Carlotta?"Excitement had dyed Sidney's cheeks with color and made her eyes
luminous.The girl in the bed eyed her, and then abruptly drew her hand
away."I'll not keep you if you have an engagement."If you would
like me to stay with you tonight--"

Carlotta shook her head on her pillow.Nothing escaped Carlotta's eyes--the younger girl's radiance, her
confusion, even her operating room uniform and what it signified.How
she hated her, with her youth and freshness, her wide eyes, her soft red
lips!And this engagement--she had the uncanny divination of fury."I was going to ask you to do something for me," she said shortly; "but
I've changed my mind about it.To end the interview, she turned over and lay with her face to the wall.All her training had been to ignore
the irritability of the sick, and Carlotta was very ill; she could see
that."Just remember that I am ready to do anything I can, Carlotta," she
said.She waited a moment, but, receiving no acknowledgement of her offer, she
turned slowly and went toward the door."If it's typhoid, I'm gone."Of course you're not gone, or anything like it.I doze for a little, and when I waken there are
people in the room.They stand around the bed and talk about me."Sidney's precious minutes were flying; but Carlotta had gone into a
paroxysm of terror, holding to Sidney's hand and begging not to be left
alone."I'm too young to die," she would whimper.And in the next breath: "I
want to die--I don't want to live!"The hands of the little watch pointed to eight-thirty when at last she
lay quiet, with closed eyes.Sidney, tiptoeing to the door, was brought
up short by her name again, this time in a more normal voice:--

"Sidney.""Perhaps you are right and I'm going to get over this."Your nerves are playing tricks with you to-night.""I'll tell you now why I sent for you.""If--if I get very bad,--you know what I mean,--will you promise to do
exactly what I tell you?""My trunk key is in my pocket-book.There is a letter in the tray--just
a name, no address on it.Promise to see that it is not delivered; that
it is destroyed without being read."Sidney promised promptly; and, because it was too late now for her
meeting with Wilson, for the next hour she devoted herself to making
Carlotta comfortable.So long as she was busy, a sort of exaltation of
service upheld her.But when at last the night assistant came to sit
with the sick girl, and Sidney was free, all the life faded from her
face.He had waited for her and she had not come.Perhaps, after all, his question had
not been what she had thought.Her stiff cap moved in the breeze as it swung from the corner of her
mirror.Under her window passed and repassed the night life of the
city--taxicabs, stealthy painted women, tired office-cleaners trudging
home at midnight, a city patrol-wagon which rolled in through the gates
to the hospital's always open door.When she could not sleep, she got up
and padded to the window in bare feet.The light from a passing machine
showed a youthful figure that looked like Joe Drummond.Life, that had always seemed so simple, was growing very complicated
for Sidney: Joe and K., Palmer and Christine, Johnny Rosenfeld,
Carlotta--either lonely or tragic, all of them, or both.It
had been a quiet night and she was asleep in her chair.To save her cap
she had taken it off, and early streaks of silver showed in her hair."I want something from my trunk," she said.The assistant wakened reluctantly, and looked at her watch."You don't want me to go to the
trunk-room at this hour!""I can go myself," said Carlotta, and put her feet out of bed.If I wait my temperature will go up and I
can't think.""Bring it here," said Carlotta shortly.The young woman went without haste, to show that a night assistant may
do such things out of friendship, but not because she must.She stopped
at the desk where the night nurse in charge of the rooms on that floor
was filling out records."Give me twelve private patients to look after instead of one nurse like
Carlotta Harrison!""I've got to go to the trunk-room
for her at this hour, and it next door to the mortuary!"As the first rays of the summer sun came through the window, shadowing
the fire-escape like a lattice on the wall of the little gray-walled
room, Carlotta sat up in her bed and lighted the candle on the stand.The night assistant, who dreamed sometimes of fire, stood nervously by."Why don't you let me do it?"The candle was in her hand, and she was
staring at the letter."Because I want to do it myself," she said at last, and thrust the
envelope into the flame.It burned slowly, at first a thin blue flame
tipped with yellow, then, eating its way with a small fine crackling,
a widening, destroying blaze that left behind it black ash and
destruction.The acrid odor of burning filled the room.Not until it was
consumed, and the black ash fell into the saucer of the candlestick, did
Carlotta speak again.Then:--

"If every fool of a woman who wrote a letter burnt it, there would be
less trouble in the world," she said, and lay back among her pillows.She was sleepy and irritated, and she had
crushed her best cap by letting the lid of Carlotta's trunk fall on her.She went out of the room with disapproval in every line of her back."She burned it," she informed the night nurse at her desk."A letter to
a man--one of her suitors, I suppose.The deepening and broadening of Sidney's character had been very
noticeable in the last few months.She had gained in decision without
becoming hard; had learned to see things as they are, not through the
rose mist of early girlhood; and, far from being daunted, had developed
a philosophy that had for its basis God in His heaven and all well with
the world.But her new theory of acceptance did not comprehend everything.She was
in a state of wild revolt, for instance, as to Johnny Rosenfeld, and
more remotely but not less deeply concerned over Grace Irving.Soon
she was to learn of Tillie's predicament, and to take up the cudgels
valiantly for her.But her revolt was to be for herself too.On the day after her failure
to keep her appointment with Wilson she had her half-holiday.No word
had come from him, and when, after a restless night, she went to her new
station in the operating-room, it was to learn that he had been called
out of the city in consultation and would not operate that day.O'Hara
would take advantage of the free afternoon to run in some odds and ends
of cases.The operating-room made gauze that morning, and small packets of
tampons: absorbent cotton covered with sterilized gauze, and fastened
together--twelve, by careful count, in each bundle.Miss Grange, who had been kind to Sidney in her probation months, taught
her the method."Used instead of sponges," she explained."If you noticed yesterday,
they were counted before and after each operation.One of these missing
is worse than a bank clerk out a dollar at the end of the day.There's
no closing up until it's found!"Sidney eyed the small packet before her anxiously.From that time on she handled the small gauze sponges almost reverently.The operating-room--all glass, white enamel, and shining
nickel-plate--first frightened, then thrilled her.It was as if, having
loved a great actor, she now trod the enchanted boards on which he
achieved his triumphs.She was glad that it was her afternoon off, and
that she would not see some lesser star--O'Hara, to wit--usurping his
place.He must have known that
she had been delayed.The operating-room was a hive of industry, and tongues kept pace with
fingers.The hospital was a world, like the Street.The nurses had come
from many places, and, like cloistered nuns, seemed to have left the
other world behind.A new President of the country was less real than a
new interne.The country might wash its soiled linen in public; what was
that compared with enough sheets and towels for the wards?Big buildings
were going up in the city.but the hospital took cognizance of that,
gathering as it did a toll from each new story added.What news of
the world came in through the great doors was translated at once into
hospital terms.It took
up life where the town left it at its gates, and carried it on or saw
it ended, as the case might be.So these young women knew the ending of
many stories, the beginning of some; but of none did they know both the
first and last, the beginning and the end.By many small kindnesses Sidney had made herself popular.And there was
more to it than that.The other girls had the respect
for her of one honest worker for another.The episode that had caused
her suspension seemed entirely forgotten.They showed her carefully what
she was to do; and, because she must know the "why" of everything, they
explained as best they could.It was while she was standing by the great sterilizer that she heard,
through an open door, part of a conversation that sent her through the
day with her world in revolt.The talkers were putting the anaesthetizing-room in readiness for the
afternoon.Sidney, waiting for the time to open the sterilizer, was
busy, for the first time in her hurried morning, with her own thoughts.Because she was very human, there was a little exultation in her mind.What would these girls say when they learned of how things stood between
her and their hero--that, out of all his world of society and clubs and
beautiful women, he was going to choose her?Not shameful, this: the honest pride of a woman in being chosen from
many."Do you think he has really broken with her?"She knows it's coming; that's all.""Sometimes I have wondered--"

"So have others.She oughtn't to be here, of course.But among so many
there is bound to be one now and then who--who isn't quite--"

She hesitated, at a loss for a word."Did you--did you ever think over that trouble with Miss Page about the
medicines?That would have been easy, and like her.""She hates Miss Page, of course, but I hardly think--If that's true, it
was nearly murder."There were two voices, a young one, full of soft southern inflections,
and an older voice, a trifle hard, as from disillusion.Sidney could hear the clatter of
bottles on the tray, the scraping of a moved table.(The younger voice, with a thrill in it.)"I saw her with him in his car one evening.And on her vacation last
summer--"

The voices dropped to a whisper.Sidney, standing cold and white by the
sterilizer, put out a hand to steady herself.How hateful life was, and men and women.Must there always be
something hideous in the background?Now she felt its hot breath on her cheek.She was steady enough in a moment, cool and calm, moving about her work
with ice-cold hands and slightly narrowed eyes.To a sort of physical
nausea was succeeding anger, a blind fury of injured pride.He had been
in love with Carlotta and had tired of her.He was bringing her his
warmed-over emotions.She remembered the bitterness of her month's
exile, and its probable cause.Well he might,
if he suspected the truth.For just a moment she had an illuminating flash of Wilson as he really
was, selfish and self-indulgent, just a trifle too carefully dressed,
daring as to eye and speech, with a carefully calculated daring, frankly
pleasure-loving.The voices in the next room had risen above their whisper."Genius has privileges, of course," said the older voice.To-morrow he is to do the Edwardes operation again.I am
glad I am to see him do it."Sidney still held her hands over her eyes.He WAS a great surgeon: in
his hands he held the keys of life and death.And perhaps he had never
cared for Carlotta: she might have thrown herself at him.He was a man,
at the mercy of any scheming woman.She tried to summon his image to her aid.Instead, there came, clear and distinct, a
picture of K. Le Moyne in the hall of the little house, reaching one of
his long arms to the chandelier over his head and looking up at her as
she stood on the stairs.CHAPTER XXII


"My God, Sidney, I'm asking you to marry me!""I have never been in love with her."He had drawn the car close to a bank, and they were
sitting in the shade, on the grass.It was the Sunday afternoon after
Sidney's experience in the operating-room."You took her out, Max, didn't you?"Good Heavens, you've put me through a catechism in the last
ten minutes!""If my father were living, or even mother, I--one of them would have
done this for me, Max.I've been very wretched for
several days."It was the first encouragement she had given him.There was no coquetry
about her aloofness.It was only that her faith in him had had a shock
and was slow of reviving."You are very, very lovely, Sidney.I wonder if you have any idea what
you mean to me?""You meant a great deal to me, too," she said frankly, "until a few days
ago.I thought you were the greatest man I had ever known, and the best.And then--I think I'd better tell you what I overheard.He listened doggedly to her account of the hospital gossip, doggedly and
with a sinking sense of fear, not of the talk, but of Carlotta herself.Usually one might count on the woman's silence, her instinct for
self-protection.She
had known from the start that the affair was a temporary one; he had
never pretended anything else.There was silence for a moment after Sidney finished.Then:

"You are not a child any longer, Sidney.You have learned a great deal
in this last year.One of the things you know is that almost every man
has small affairs, many of them sometimes, before he finds the woman
he wants to marry.When he finds her, the others are all off--there's
nothing to them.It's the real thing then, instead of the sham.""Palmer was very much in love with Christine, and yet--"

"Palmer is a cad.""I don't want you to think I'm making terms.But if this thing
went on, and I found out afterward that you--that there was anyone else,
it would kill me."There was something boyish in his triumph, in the very gesture with
which he held out his arms, like a child who has escaped a whipping.He
stood up and, catching her hands, drew her to her feet."Then I'm yours, and only yours, if you want me," he said, and took her
in his arms.He was riotously happy, must hold her off for the joy of drawing her to
him again, must pull off her gloves and kiss her soft bare palms.he cried, and bent down to bury his face in the
warm hollow of her neck.Sidney glowed under his caresses--was rather startled at his passion, a
little ashamed."Tell me you love me a little bit."I love you," said Sidney, and flushed scarlet.But even in his arms, with the warm sunlight on his radiant face, with
his lips to her ear, whispering the divine absurdities of passion, in
the back of her obstinate little head was the thought that, while she
had given him her first embrace, he had held other women in his arms.It
made her passive, prevented her complete surrender."You are only letting me love you," he
complained."I don't believe you care, after all."He freed her, took a step back from her."I am afraid I am jealous," she said simply."I keep thinking of--of
Carlotta.""Will it help any if I swear that that is off absolutely?"But he insisted on swearing, standing with one hand upraised, his eyes
on her.The Sunday landscape was very still, save for the hum of busy
insect life.A mile or so away, at the foot of two hills, lay a white
farmhouse with its barn and outbuildings.In a small room in the barn
a woman sat; and because it was Sunday, and she could not sew, she read
her Bible.

"--and that after this there will be only one woman for me," finished
Max, and dropped his hand.He bent over and kissed Sidney on the lips.At the white farmhouse, a little man stood in the doorway and surveyed
the road with eyes shaded by a shirt-sleeved arm.Behind him, in a
darkened room, a barkeeper was wiping the bar with a clean cloth."I guess I'll go and get my coat on, Bill," said the little man heavily.I see a machine about a mile down the
road."Sidney broke the news of her engagement to K. herself, the evening of
the same day.The little house was quiet when she got out of the car at
the door.Harriet was asleep on the couch at the foot of her bed,
and Christine's rooms were empty.She found Katie on the back porch,
mountains of Sunday newspapers piled around her."I'd about give you up," said Katie."I was thinking, rather than see
your ice-cream that's left from dinner melt and go to waste, I'd take it
around to the Rosenfelds."She stood in front of Katie, drawing off her gloves."You're gettin' prettier every day, Miss Sidney.Is that the blue suit
Miss Harriet said she made for you?Sidney obediently turned, and Katie admired."When I think how things have turned out!""You in a
hospital, doing God knows what for all sorts of people, and Miss Harriet
making a suit like that and asking a hundred dollars for it, and that
tony that a person doesn't dare to speak to her when she's in the
dining-room.And your poor ma...well, it's all in a lifetime!"Well, that's what I call it.Don't I hear her dressing
up about four o'clock every afternoon, and, when she's all ready,
sittin' in the parlor with the door open, and a book on her knee, as if
she'd been reading all afternoon?If he doesn't stop, she's at the foot
of the stairs, calling up to him.'K.,' she says, 'K., I'm waiting to
ask you something!'or, 'K., wouldn't you like a cup of tea?'She's
always feedin' him tea and cake, so that when he comes to table he won't
eat honest victuals."Sidney had paused with one glove half off.Was life making another of its queer errors, and were
Christine and K. in love with each other?K. had always been HER
friend, HER confidant.To give him up to Christine--she shook herself
impatiently.Why not be glad that he had some
sort of companionship?She went upstairs to the room that had been her mother's, and took off
her hat.She wanted to be alone, to realize what had happened to
her.It gave her an odd, lost
feeling.She was going to be married--not very soon, but ultimately.A
year ago her half promise to Joe had gratified her sense of romance.She
was loved, and she had thrilled to it.Marriage, that had been but a vision then,
loomed large, almost menacing.She had learned the law of compensation:
that for every joy one pays in suffering.Women who married went down
into the valley of death for their children.One must love and be loved
very tenderly to pay for that.Women grew old, and age was not always
lovely.This very maternity--was it not fatal to beauty?Visions of
child-bearing women in the hospitals, with sagging breasts and relaxed
bodies, came to her.Sidney could hear her moving
about with flat, inelastic steps.One married, happily or not as the case might
be, and took the risk.Or one stayed single, like Harriet, growing a
little hard, exchanging slimness for leanness and austerity of figure,
flat-chested, thin-voiced.One blossomed and withered, then, or one
shriveled up without having flowered.All at once it seemed very
terrible to her.She felt as if she had been caught in an inexorable
hand that had closed about her.Harriet found her a little later, face down on her mother's bed, crying
as if her heart would break."You've been overworking," she said.Your
measurements for that suit showed it.I have never approved of this
hospital training, and after last January--"

She could hardly credit her senses when Sidney, still swollen with
weeping, told her of her engagement.If you care for him and he has asked you to
marry him, why on earth are you crying your eyes out?"It just came over me, all at once,
that I--It was just foolishness.The girl needed her mother, and she,
Harriet, was a hard, middle-aged woman and a poor substitute.She patted
Sidney's moist hand."I'll attend to your wedding things,
Sidney.We'll show this street that even Christine Lorenz can be
outdone."And, as an afterthought: "I hope Max Wilson will settle down
now.K. had taken Christine to see Tillie that Sunday afternoon.Palmer
had the car out--had, indeed, not been home since the morning of the
previous day.He played golf every Saturday afternoon and Sunday at the
Country Club, and invariably spent the night there.So K. and Christine
walked from the end of the trolley line, saying little, but under K.'s
keen direction finding bright birds in the hedgerows, hidden field
flowers, a dozen wonders of the country that Christine had never dreamed
of.The interview with Tillie had been a disappointment to K. Christine,
with the best and kindliest intentions, struck a wrong note.In her
endeavor to cover the fact that everything in Tillie's world was wrong,
she fell into the error of pretending that everything was right.Tillie, grotesque of figure and tragic-eyed, listened to her patiently,
while K. stood, uneasy and uncomfortable, in the wide door of the
hay-barn and watched automobiles turning in from the road.When
Christine rose to leave, she confessed her failure frankly."I've meant well, Tillie," she said."I'm afraid I've said exactly
what I shouldn't.I can only think that, no matter what is wrong, two
wonderful pieces of luck have come to you.Schwitter--cares for you,--you admit that,--and you are going to have a
child.""I used to be a good woman, Mrs.When I look in that glass at myself, and call myself what I am, I'd give
a good bit to be back on the Street again."She found opportunity for a word with K. while Christine went ahead of
him out of the barn."I've been wanting to speak to you, Mr."Joe Drummond's been coming out here pretty regular.Schwitter
says he's drinking a little.He don't like him loafing around here: he
sent him home last Sunday."The barkeeper says he carries a revolver around, and talks wild.I
thought maybe Sidney Page could do something with him.""I think he'd not like her to know.'s face was thoughtful as he followed Christine to the road.Christine was very silent, on the way back to the city.More than once
K. found her eyes fixed on him, and it puzzled him.Poor Christine was
only trying to fit him into the world she knew--a world whose men were
strong but seldom tender, who gave up their Sundays to golf, not to
visiting unhappy outcasts in the country.How masculine he was, and
yet how gentle!It gave her a choking feeling in her throat.She took
advantage of a steep bit of road to stop and stand a moment, her fingers
on his shabby gray sleeve.Sidney was sitting on the low step,
waiting for them.Wilson had come across at seven, impatient because he must see a case
that evening, and promising an early return.In the little hall he had
drawn her to him and kissed her, this time not on the lips, but on the
forehead and on each of her white eyelids.he had said, and was rather ashamed of his own
emotion.From across the Street, as he got into his car, he had waved
his hand to her.Christine went to her room, and, with a long breath of content, K.
folded up his long length on the step below Sidney."Well, dear ministering angel," he said, "how goes the world?"Perhaps because she had a woman's
instinct for making the most of a piece of news, perhaps--more likely,
indeed--because she divined that the announcement would not be entirely
agreeable, she delayed it, played with it."I have gone into the operating-room."There was relief in his eyes, and still a question.Apparently he did not wish to hear her say it; for when, after a moment,
he spoke, it was to forestall her, after all."I think I know what it is, Sidney.""I--it's not an entire surprise.""Aren't you going to wish me happiness?""If my wishing could bring anything good to you, you would have
everything in the world."His voice was not entirely steady, but his eyes smiled into hers."Am I--are we going to lose you soon?"Then, in a burst of confidence:--

"I know so little, K., and he knows so much!I am going to read and
study, so that he can talk to me about his work.That's what marriage
ought to be, a sort of partnership.His mind refused to go forward to the unthinkable future.Instead, he was looking back--back to those days when he had hoped
sometime to have a wife to talk to about his work, that beloved work
that was no longer his.And, finding it agonizing, as indeed all thought
was that summer night, he dwelt for a moment on that evening, a year
before, when in the same June moonlight, he had come up the Street and
had seen Sidney where she was now, with the tree shadows playing over
her.Now it was another and older man, daring,
intelligent, unscrupulous.And this time he had lost her absolutely,
lost her without a struggle to keep her.His only struggle had been with
himself, to remember that he had nothing to offer but failure."Do you know," said Sidney suddenly, "that it is almost a year since
that night you came up the Street, and I was here on the steps?""That's a fact, isn't it!"He managed to get some surprise into his
voice."Because--well, you know, K. Why do men always hate a woman who just
happens not to love them?"It would be much better for them if they
could.As a matter of fact, there are poor devils who go through life
trying to do that very thing, and failing."Sidney's eyes were on the tall house across.Ed's evening
office hour, and through the open window she could see a line of people
waiting their turn.They sat immobile, inert, doggedly patient, until
the opening of the back office door promoted them all one chair toward
the consulting-room."I shall be just across the Street," she said at last."Nearer than I am
at the hospital.""But we will still be friends, K.?"But, after another silence, he astounded her.She had fallen into the
way of thinking of him as always belonging to the house, even, in a
sense, belonging to her.And now--

"Shall you mind very much if I tell you that I am thinking of going
away?""My dear child, you do not need a roomer here any more.I have always
received infinitely more than I have paid for, even in the small
services I have been able to render.You are away, and some day you are going to be married.Don't you see--I
am not needed?""That does not mean you are not wanted."I'll always be near enough, so that I can see
you"--he changed this hastily--"so that we can still meet and talk
things over.Old friends ought to be like that, not too near, but to be
turned on when needed, like a tap.""The Rosenfelds are rather in straits.I thought of helping them to get
a small house somewhere and of taking a room with them.If they could furnish it even plainly, it could be
done."Have you always gone
through life helping people, K.?She bent over and put her hand on his shoulder."It will not be home without you, K."To save him, he could not have spoken just then.A riot of rebellion
surged up in him, that he must let this best thing in his life go out
of it.To go empty of heart through the rest of his days, while his very
arms ached to hold her!And she was so near--just above, with her hand
on his shoulder, her wistful face so close that, without moving, he
could have brushed her hair."You have not wished me happiness, K. Do you remember, when I was going
to the hospital and you gave me the little watch--do you remember what
you said?"You are going to leave us, and I--say it, K.""Good-bye, dear, and--God bless you."CHAPTER XXIII


The announcement of Sidney's engagement was not to be made for a year.Wilson, chafing under the delay, was obliged to admit to himself that
it was best.Carlotta would have
finished her training, and by that time would probably be reconciled to
the ending of their relationship.He had meant every word of what he had sworn to
Sidney.He was genuinely in love, even unselfishly--as far as he could
be unselfish.The secret was to be carefully kept also for Sidney's
sake.The hospital did not approve of engagements between nurses and the
staff.It was disorganizing, bad for discipline.Sidney was very happy all that summer.She glowed with pride when her
lover put through a difficult piece of work; flushed and palpitated when
she heard his praises sung; grew to know, by a sort of intuition, when
he was in the house.She wore his ring on a fine chain around her neck,
and grew prettier every day.Once or twice, however, when she was at home, away from the glamour, her
early fears obsessed her.He was so handsome
and so gifted, and there were women who were mad about him.That was the
gossip of the hospital.Suppose she married him and he tired of her?In
her humility she thought that perhaps only her youth, and such charm as
she had that belonged to youth, held him.And before her, always, she
saw the tragic women of the wards.Sidney had been insistent, and
Harriet had topped the argument in her businesslike way."If you insist
on being an idiot and adopting the Rosenfeld family," she said, "wait
until September.The season for boarders doesn't begin until fall."So K. waited for "the season," and ate his heart out for Sidney in the
interval.Johnny Rosenfeld still lay in his ward, inert from the waist down.As a matter of fact, he was watching the
boy closely, at Max Wilson's request."Tell me when I'm to do it," said Wilson, "and when the time comes,
for God's sake, stand by me.He's got so much
confidence that I'll help him that I don't dare to fail."So K. came on visiting days, and, by special dispensation, on Saturday
afternoons.Not that he knew
anything about it himself; but, by means of a blind teacher, he kept
just one lesson ahead.It found
something absurd and rather touching in this tall, serious young man
with the surprisingly deft fingers, tying raffia knots.The first basket went, by Johnny's request, to Sidney Page."I want her to have it," he said."She got corns on her fingers from
rubbing me when I came in first; and, besides--"

"Yes?"said K. He was tying a most complicated knot, and could not look
up."I'm not going to get in wrong by
talking, but I know something.K. looked up then, and surprised Johnny's secret in his face."If I'd squealed she'd have finished me for good.I'm not running in 2.40 these days.""I'll not tell, or make it uncomfortable for you.The ward was in the somnolence of mid-afternoon.The nearest patient, a man in a wheel-chair, was snoring heavily."It was the dark-eyed one that changed the medicine on me," he said."The one with the heels that were always tapping around, waking me up.After all, it was only what K. had suspected before.But a sense of
impending danger to Sidney obsessed him.If Carlotta would do that, what
would she do when she learned of the engagement?The odd coincidence of
their paths crossing again troubled him.Carlotta Harrison was well again, and back on duty.Luckily for Sidney,
her three months' service in the operating-room kept them apart.For
Carlotta was now not merely jealous.It had been her theory that
Wilson would not marry easily--that, in a sense, he would have to be
coerced into marriage.Some clever woman would marry him some day, and
no one would be more astonished than himself.She thought merely that
Sidney was playing a game like her own, with different weapons.So she
planned her battle, ignorant that she had lost already.She stopped sulking, met Max with smiles,
made no overtures toward a renewal of their relations.To desert a woman was justifiable,
under certain circumstances.But to desert a woman, and have her
apparently not even know it, was against the rules of the game.During a surgical dressing in a private room, one day, he allowed his
fingers to touch hers, as on that day a year before when she had taken
Miss Simpson's place in his office.He was rewarded by the same slow,
smouldering glance that had caught his attention before.A new interne had come into the
house, and was going through the process of learning that from a senior
at the medical school to a half-baked junior interne is a long step
back.He had to endure the good-humored contempt of the older men, the
patronizing instructions of nurses as to rules.His uneasy rounds in
Carlotta's precinct took on the state and form of staff visitations.She
flattered, cajoled, looked up to him.After a time it dawned on Wilson that this junior cub was getting more
attention than himself: that, wherever he happened to be, somewhere in
the offing would be Carlotta and the Lamb, the latter eyeing her with
worship.The enthroning of a
successor galled him.Between them, the Lamb suffered mightily--was
subject to frequent "bawling out," as he termed it, in the
operating-room as he assisted the anaesthetist.He took his troubles to
Carlotta, who soothed him in the corridor--in plain sight of her quarry,
of course--by putting a sympathetic hand on his sleeve.Then, one day, Wilson was goaded to speech."For the love of Heaven, Carlotta," he said impatiently, "stop making
love to that wretched boy.He wriggles like a worm if you look at him."I respect him, and--he respects
me.""It's rather a silly game, you know."I--I don't really care a lot about him, Max.Her attraction for him was almost gone--not quite.She lifted her eyes to his, and for once she was not
acting."I knew it would end, of course.Why, after all, should he not be her friend?He
had treated her cruelly, hideously.If she still desired his friendship,
there was no disloyalty to Sidney in giving it.Not once again did she allow him to see what lay in her eyes.She had
a chance to take up institutional work.She abhorred the thought of
private duty.The Lamb was hovering near, hot eyes on them both."Come to the office and we'll talk it over.""I don't like to go there; Miss Simpson is suspicious."The institution she spoke of was in another city.It occurred to
Wilson that if she took it the affair would have reached a graceful and
legitimate end.Also, the thought of another stolen evening alone with her was not
unpleasant.It would be the last, he promised himself.After all, it was
owing to her.Sidney would be at a lecture that night."Suppose you meet me at the old corner," he said carelessly, eyes on
the Lamb, who was forgetting that he was only a junior interne and was
glaring ferociously."We'll run out into the country and talk things
over."She demurred, with her heart beating triumphantly."What's the use of going back to that?When at last she had yielded, and he
made his way down to the smoking-room, it was with the feeling that he
had won a victory.K. had been uneasy all that day; his ledgers irritated him.He had been
sleeping badly since Sidney's announcement of her engagement.At five
o'clock, when he left the office, he found Joe Drummond waiting outside
on the pavement."Mother said you'd been up to see me a couple of times.I'll go about
town for a half-hour or so."Thus forestalled, K. found his subject hard to lead up to.But here
again Joe met him more than halfway."Well, go on," he said, when they found themselves in the park; "I don't
suppose you were paying a call.""I guess I know what you are going to say.""I'm not going to preach, if you're expecting that.Ordinarily, if a man
insists on making a fool of himself, I let him alone.""One reason is that I happen to like you.The other reason is that,
whether you admit it or not, you are acting like a young idiot, and are
putting the responsibility on the shoulders of some one else."You are a man, and you are acting like a bad boy.It's a
disappointment to me.She's going to marry Wilson, isn't she?"If I'd go to her
to-night and tell her what I know, she'd never see him again."The idea,
thus born in his overwrought brain, obsessed him.He was not certain that the boy's
statement had any basis in fact.His single determination was to save
Sidney from any pain.When Joe suddenly announced his inclination to go out into the country
after all, he suspected a ruse to get rid of him, and insisted on going
along."Car's at Bailey's garage," he said sullenly."I don't know when I'll
get back."That passed unnoticed until they were on the highroad, with the car
running smoothly between yellowing fields of wheat.Then:--

"So you've got it too!"We'd both
be better off if I sent the car over a bank."He gave the wheel a reckless twist, and Le Moyne called him to time
sternly.They had supper at the White Springs Hotel--not on the terrace, but in
the little room where Carlotta and Wilson had taken their first meal
together.K. ordered beer for them both, and Joe submitted with bad
grace.K. found him more amenable to
reason, and, gaining his confidence, learned of his desire to leave the
city."I'm the only one, and mother yells blue
murder when I talk about it.His dilated pupils became more normal, his
restless hands grew quiet.'s even voice, the picture he drew of
life on the island, the stillness of the little hotel in its mid-week
dullness, seemed to quiet the boy's tortured nerves.He was nearer
to peace than he had been for many days.But he smoked incessantly,
lighting one cigarette from another.At ten o'clock he left K. and went for the car.He paused for a moment,
rather sheepishly, by K."I'm feeling a lot better," he said."I haven't got the band around my
head.That was the last K. saw of Joe Drummond until the next day.CHAPTER XXIV


Carlotta dressed herself with unusual care--not in black this time, but
in white.She coiled her yellow hair in a soft knot at the back of her
head, and she resorted to the faintest shading of rouge.The ride was to be a bright spot in Wilson's memory.He expected recriminations; she meant to make him happy.That was the
secret of the charm some women had for men.They went to such women to
forget their troubles.She set the hour of their meeting at nine, when
the late dusk of summer had fallen; and she met him then, smiling, a
faintly perfumed white figure, slim and young, with a thrill in her
voice that was only half assumed."Surely you are not going to be back at
ten.""I have special permission to be out late."And then, recollecting their new situation: "We have a lot to
talk over.At the White Springs Hotel they stopped to fill the gasolene tank of the
car.Joe Drummond saw Wilson there, in the sheet-iron garage alongside
of the road.It did not occur to Joe
that the white figure in the car was not Sidney.He went rather white,
and stepped out of the zone of light.The influence of Le Moyne was
still on him, however, and he went on quietly with what he was doing.But his hands shook as he filled the radiator.When Wilson's car had gone on, he went automatically about his
preparations for the return trip--lifted a seat cushion to investigate
his own store of gasolene, replacing carefully the revolver he always
carried under the seat and packed in waste to prevent its accidental
discharge, lighted his lamps, examined a loose brake-band.He had been an ass: Le Moyne was right.He'd
get away--to Cuba if he could--and start over again.He would forget the
Street and let it forget him."To Schwitter's, of course," one of them grumbled."We might as well go
out of business.""There's no money in running a straight place.Schwitter and half a
dozen others are getting rich.""That was Wilson, the surgeon in town.He cut off my brother-in-law's
leg--charged him as much as if he had grown a new one for him.Now he goes to Schwitter's, like the rest.So Max Wilson was taking Sidney to Schwitter's, making her the butt of
garage talk!Joe's hands grew cold, his
head hot.A red mist spread between him and the line of electric lights.He knew Schwitter's, and he knew Wilson.He flung himself into his car and threw the throttle open."You can't start like that, son," one of the men remonstrated."You let
'er in too fast."Joe snarled, and made a second ineffectual effort.Thus adjured, the men offered neither further advice nor assistance.The
minutes went by in useless cranking--fifteen.But when K., growing uneasy, came out
into the yard, the engine had started at last.He was in time to see Joe
run his car into the road and turn it viciously toward Schwitter's.Carlotta's nearness was having its calculated effect on Max Wilson.His
spirits rose as the engine, marking perfect time, carried them along the
quiet roads.Partly it was reaction--relief that she should be so reasonable, so
complaisant--and a sort of holiday spirit after the day's hard work.Oddly enough, and not so irrational as may appear, Sidney formed a
part of the evening's happiness--that she loved him; that, back in the
lecture-room, eyes and even mind on the lecturer, her heart was with
him.So, with Sidney the basis of his happiness, he made the most of his
evening's freedom.He sang a little in his clear tenor--even, once when
they had slowed down at a crossing, bent over audaciously and kissed
Carlotta's hand in the full glare of a passing train."I like to be reckless," he replied.She did not want the situation to get
out of hand.Moreover, what was so real for her was only too plainly a
lark for him.The hopelessness of her situation was dawning on her.Even when the
touch of her beside him and the solitude of the country roads got in
his blood, and he bent toward her, she found no encouragement in his
words:--"I am mad about you to-night."She took her courage in her hands:--"Then why give me up for some one
else?"No one else will
ever care as I do."I don't care for anyone else in the
world.If you let me go I'll want to die."Then, as he was silent:--

"If you'll marry me, I'll be true to you all my life.The sense, if not the words, of what he had sworn to Sidney that Sunday
afternoon under the trees, on this very road!Swift shame overtook
him, that he should be here, that he had allowed Carlotta to remain in
ignorance of how things really stood between them.I'm engaged to marry some one
else."He was ashamed at the way she took the news.If she had stormed or wept,
he would have known what to do."You must have expected it, sooner or later."He thought she might faint, and looked at her
anxiously.Her profile, indistinct beside him, looked white and drawn.If their
escapade became known, it would end things between Sidney and him.It must become known
without any apparent move on her part.If, for instance, she became ill,
and was away from the hospital all night, that might answer.The thing
would be investigated, and who knew--

The car turned in at Schwitter's road and drew up before the house.The narrow porch was filled with small tables, above which hung rows of
electric lights enclosed in Japanese paper lanterns.Midweek, which had
found the White Springs Hotel almost deserted, saw Schwitter's crowded
tables set out under the trees.Seeing the crowd, Wilson drove directly
to the yard and parked his machine."No need of running any risk," he explained to the still figure beside
him."We can walk back and take a table under the trees, away from those
infernal lanterns."She reeled a little as he helped her out.She leaned rather
heavily on him as they walked toward the house.The faint perfume that
had almost intoxicated him, earlier, vaguely irritated him now.At the rear of the house she shook off his arm and preceded him around
the building.She chose the end of the porch as the place in which to
drop, and went down like a stone, falling back.The visitors at Schwitter's were too
much engrossed with themselves to be much interested.She opened her
eyes almost as soon as she fell--to forestall any tests; she was
shrewd enough to know that Wilson would detect her malingering very
quickly--and begged to be taken into the house."I feel very ill," she
said, and her white face bore her out.Schwitter and Bill carried her in and up the stairs to one of the newly
furnished rooms.He had a
horror of knockout drops and the police.They laid her on the bed, her
hat beside her; and Wilson, stripping down the long sleeve of her glove,
felt her pulse."There's a doctor in the next town," said Schwitter."I was going to
send for him, anyhow--my wife's not very well."He closed the door behind the relieved figure of the landlord, and,
going back to Carlotta, stood looking down at her."You were no more faint than I am."The lanterns--"

He crossed the room deliberately and went out, closing the door behind
him.He saw at once where he stood--in what danger.If she insisted
that she was ill and unable to go back, there would be a fuss.At the foot of the stairs, Schwitter pulled himself together.After all,
the girl was only ill.The doctor ought to be here by this time.Tillie was alone, out
in the harness-room.He looked through the crowded rooms, at the
overflowing porch with its travesty of pleasure, and he hated the whole
thing with a desperate hatred.A young man edged his way into the hall and confronted him."Upstairs--first bedroom to the right."Surely, as
a man sowed he reaped.At the top, on the landing, he confronted
Wilson.He fired at him without a word--saw him fling up his arms and
fall back, striking first the wall, then the floor.The buzz of conversation on the porch suddenly ceased.Joe put his
revolver in his pocket and went quietly down the stairs.The crowd
parted to let him through.Carlotta, crouched in her room, listening, not daring to open the door,
heard the sound of a car as it swung out into the road.CHAPTER XXV


On the evening of the shooting at Schwitter's, there had been a late
operation at the hospital.Sidney, having duly transcribed her lecture
notes and said her prayers, was already asleep when she received the
insistent summons to the operating-room.These night battles with death roused all her fighting blood.There were times when she felt as if, by sheer will, she could force
strength, life itself, into failing bodies.Her sensitive nostrils
dilated, her brain worked like a machine.That night she received well-deserved praise.When the Lamb, telephoning
hysterically, had failed to locate the younger Wilson, another staff
surgeon was called.His keen eyes watched Sidney--felt her capacity, her
fiber, so to speak; and, when everything was over, he told her what was
in his mind."Don't wear yourself out, girl," he said gravely.It was good work to-night--fine work.By midnight the work was done, and the nurse in charge sent Sidney to
bed.It was the Lamb who received the message about Wilson; and because he
was not very keen at the best, and because the news was so startling, he
refused to credit his ears.I mustn't make a mess of this."Wilson, the surgeon, has been shot," came slowly and distinctly."Get the staff there and have a room ready.Get the operating-room
ready, too."The Lamb wakened then, and roused the house.He was incoherent, rather,
so that Dr.Ed got the impression that it was Le Moyne who had been
shot, and only learned the truth when he got to the hospital.He liked K., and his heart was sore within
him.Staff's in the
executive committee room, sir."I thought you said--"

The Lamb turned pale at that, and braced himself."I'm sorry--I thought you understood.Ed, who was heavy and not very young, sat down on an office chair.Out of sheer habit he had brought the bag.He put it down on the floor
beside him, and moistened his lips.The Lamb stood by the door, and Dr.Outside the windows, the night world went
by--taxi-cabs full of roisterers, women who walked stealthily close
to the buildings, a truck carrying steel, so heavy that it shook the
hospital as it rumbled by.The bag with the dog-collar in it was on the
floor.He thought of many things, but mostly of the promise he had made
his mother.And, having forgotten the injured man's shortcomings, he
was remembering his good qualities--his cheerfulness, his courage, his
achievements.He remembered the day Max had done the Edwardes operation,
and how proud he had been of him.He figured out how old he was--not
thirty-one yet, and already, perhaps--There he stopped thinking.Cold
beads of sweat stood out on his forehead."I think I hear them now, sir," said the Lamb, and stood back
respectfully to let him pass out of the door.Carlotta stayed in the room during the consultation.No one seemed to
wonder why she was there, or to pay any attention to her.Ed beside the bed, and
then closed in again.Carlotta waited, her hand over her mouth to keep herself from screaming.Surely they would operate; they wouldn't let him die like that!When she saw the phalanx break up, and realized that they would not
operate, she went mad.She stood against the door, and accused them of
cowardice--taunted them."Do you think he would let any of you die like that?""Die
like a hurt dog, and none of you to lift a hand?"It was Pfeiffer who drew her out of the room and tried to talk reason
and sanity to her."If there was a chance, we'd operate, and you
know it."The staff went hopelessly down the stairs to the smoking-room, and
smoked.The night assistant sent coffee down
to them, and they drank it.Ed stayed in his brother's room, and
said to his mother, under his breath, that he'd tried to do his best by
Max, and that from now on it would be up to her.The country doctor had come, too,
finding Tillie's trial not imminent.On the way in he had taken it
for granted that K. was a medical man like himself, and had placed his
hypodermic case at his disposal.When he missed him,--in the smoking-room, that was,--he asked for him."I don't see the chap who came in with us," he said.K. sat alone on a bench in the hall.He wondered who would tell Sidney;
he hoped they would be very gentle with her.He sat in the shadow,
waiting.He did not want to go home and leave her to what she might have
to face.There was a chance she would ask for him.He wanted to be near,
in that case.He sat in the shadow, on the bench.The night watchman went by twice and
stared at him.At last he asked K. to mind the door until he got some
coffee."One of the staff's been hurt," he explained."If I don't get some
coffee now, I won't get any."Somehow, she had not thought
of it before.Now she wondered how she could have failed to think of it.If only she could find him and he would do it!She would go down on her
knees--would tell him everything, if only he would consent.When she found him on his bench, however, she passed him by.She had a
terrible fear that he might go away if she put the thing to him first.So first she went to the staff and confronted them.They were men of
courage, only declining to undertake what they considered hopeless work.The one man among them who might have done the thing with any chance
of success lay stricken.Not one among them but would have given of his
best--only his best was not good enough."It would be the Edwardes operation, wouldn't it?"There were no rules to cover such conduct on
the part of a nurse.One of them--Pfeiffer again, by chance--replied
rather heavily:--

"If any, it would be the Edwardes operation."How
did this thing happen, Miss Harrison?"Her face was ghastly, save for the trace of
rouge; her eyes were red-rimmed.Edwardes is sitting on a bench in the hall outside!"He was to take up the old
burden.Ed remembered
about her when, tracing his brother's career from his babyhood to man's
estate and to what seemed now to be its ending, he had remembered that
Max was very fond of Sidney.He had hoped that Sidney would take him and
do for him what he, Ed, had failed to do.She thought it was another operation, and her spirit was just a little
weary.She forced her shoes on her
tired feet, and bathed her face in cold water to rouse herself.He was fond of Sidney; she always
smiled at him; and, on his morning rounds at six o'clock to waken the
nurses, her voice was always amiable.So she found him in the hall,
holding a cup of tepid coffee.He was old and bleary, unmistakably dirty
too--but he had divined Sidney's romance.She took it obediently, but over the cup her eyes searched his.He had had another name, but it was
lost in the mists of years.So she finished it, not without anxiety that she might be needed.But
daddy's attentions were for few, and not to be lightly received."Can you stand a piece of bad news?"Strangely, her first thought was of K.It ain't much, but I guess you'd like to know
it."So she went down alone to the room where Dr.Ed sat in a chair, with
his untidy bag beside him on the floor, and his eyes fixed on a straight
figure on the bed.When he saw Sidney, he got up and put his arms around
her.His eyes told her the truth before he told her anything.She hardly
listened to what he said.The fact was all that concerned her--that her
lover was dying there, so near that she could touch him with her hand,
so far away that no voice, no caress of hers, could reach him.Ed's arms
about her, and wait.Sidney's voice sounded strange to her
ears.For suddenly Sidney's small world, which
had always sedately revolved in one direction, began to move the other
way.The door opened, and the staff came in.But where before they had
moved heavily, with drooped heads, now they came quickly, as men with a
purpose.There was a tall man in a white coat with them.He ordered them
about like children, and they hastened to do his will.At first Sidney
only knew that now, at last, they were going to do something--the tall
man was going to do something.He stood with his back to Sidney, and
gave orders.The nurses stood
by, while the staff did nurses' work.The senior surgical interne,
essaying assistance, was shoved aside by the senior surgical consultant,
and stood by, aggrieved.It was the Lamb, after all, who brought the news to Sidney.Ed, and she was alone now, her face buried
against the back of a chair."There'll be something doing now, Miss Page," he offered.Do you know who's going to do it?"His voice echoed the subdued excitement of the room--excitement and new
hope."Did you ever hear of Edwardes, the surgeon?--the Edwardes operation,
you know.They found him
sitting on a bench in the hall downstairs."Sidney raised her head, but she could not see the miraculously found
Edwardes.She could see the familiar faces of the staff, and that other
face on the pillow, and--she gave a little cry.How like
him to be there, to be wherever anyone was in trouble!Tears came to her
eyes--the first tears she had shed.As if her eyes had called him, he looked up and saw her.The staff stood back to let him pass, and gazed after him.The wonder of what had happened was growing on them.K. stood beside Sidney, and looked down at her.Just at first it seemed
as if he found nothing to say.Then:

"There's just a chance, Sidney dear.If a shadow passed over his face, no one saw it."I'll not ask you to go back to your room.If you will wait somewhere
near, I'll see that you have immediate word.""I am going to the operating-room."She was
not herself, of course, what with strain and weariness.Whether she knew him as Le Moyne or as Edwardes mattered very
little, after all.The thing that really mattered was that he must try
to save Wilson for her.If he failed--It ran through his mind that if he
failed she might hate him the rest of her life--not for himself, but for
his failure; that, whichever way things went, he must lose.Edwardes says you are to stay away from the operation, but to
remain near.He--he promises to call you if--things go wrong."She sat in the
anaesthetizing-room, and after a time she knew that she was not alone.She realized dully that Carlotta was there,
too, pacing up and down the little room.She was never sure, for
instance, whether she imagined it, or whether Carlotta really stopped
before her and surveyed her with burning eyes."So you thought he was going to marry you!"Sidney tried to answer, and failed--or that was the way the dream went."If you had enough character, I'd think you did it.How do I know you
didn't follow us, and shoot him as he left the room?"It must have been reality, after all; for Sidney's numbed mind grasped
the essential fact here, and held on to it.He had promised--sworn that this should not happen.It seemed as if nothing more could hurt her.In the movement to and from the operating room, the door stood open for
a moment.A tall figure--how much it looked like K.!--straightened and
held out something in its hand.Then more waiting, a stir of movement in the room beyond the closed
door.Carlotta was standing, her face buried in her hands, against the
door.It
must be tragic to care like that!She herself was not caring much; she
was too numb.Beyond, across the courtyard, was the stable.Before the day of the
motor ambulances, horses had waited there for their summons, eager as
fire horses, heads lifted to the gong.When Sidney saw the outline of
the stable roof, she knew that it was dawn.The city still slept, but
the torturing night was over.And in the gray dawn the staff, looking
gray too, and elderly and weary, came out through the closed door and
took their hushed way toward the elevator.Sidney, straining her ears, gathered that they had seen a
miracle, and that the wonder was still on them.Almost on their heels came K. He was in the white coat, and more and
more he looked like the man who had raised up from his work and held out
something in his hand.Sidney's head was aching and confused.She sat there in her chair, looking small and childish.The dawn was
morning now--horizontal rays of sunlight on the stable roof and across
the windowsill of the anaesthetizing-room, where a row of bottles sat on
a clean towel.The tall man--or was it K.?--looked at her, and then reached up and
turned off the electric light.Why, it was K., of course; and he was
putting out the hall light before he went upstairs.When the light was
out everything was gray.She slid very quietly out of
her chair, and lay at his feet in a dead faint.He held her as he had held her that day
at the park when she fell in the river, very carefully, tenderly, as one
holds something infinitely precious.Not until he had placed her on her
bed did she open her eyes.She was
so tired, and to be carried like that, in strong arms, not knowing where
one was going, or caring--

The nurse he had summoned hustled out for aromatic ammonia.Sidney,
lying among her pillows, looked up at K.All the time I was sitting waiting, I kept
thinking that it was you who were operating!The nurse was a long time getting the ammonia.There was so much to talk
about: that Dr.Max had been out with Carlotta Harrison, and had been
shot by a jealous woman; the inexplicable return to life of the great
Edwardes; and--a fact the nurse herself was willing to vouch for, and
that thrilled the training-school to the core--that this very Edwardes,
newly risen, as it were, and being a miracle himself as well as
performing one, this very Edwardes, carrying Sidney to her bed and
putting her down, had kissed her on her white forehead.And,
after all, the nurse had only seen it in the mirror, being occupied
at the time in seeing if her cap was straight.The school, therefore,
accepted the miracle, but refused the kiss.But something had happened to K.
that savored of the marvelous.His faith in himself was coming back--not
strongly, with a rush, but with all humility.He had been loath to
take up the burden; but, now that he had it, he breathed a sort of
inarticulate prayer to be able to carry it.And, since men have looked for signs since the beginning of time, he too
asked for a sign.Not, of course, that he put it that way, or that he
was making terms with Providence.It was like this: if Wilson got well,
he'd keep on working.He'd feel that, perhaps, after all, this was
meant.If Wilson died--Sidney held out her hand to him."What should I do without you, K.?""All you have to do is to want me."His voice was not too steady, and he took her pulse in a most
businesslike way to distract her attention from it.You are quite professional about
pulses."He was not sure, to be frank, that she'd
be interested.Now, with Wilson as he was, was no time to obtrude his
own story."Will you drink some beef tea if I send it to you?""Sleep, while he--"

"I promise to tell you if there is any change.But, as he rose from the chair beside her low bed, she put out her hand
to him.And, when he hesitated: "I bring all my troubles
to you, as if you had none.Somehow, I can't go to Aunt Harriet, and of
course mother--Carlotta cares a great deal for him.He had so many friends, and no enemies that I knew
of."Her mind seemed to stagger about in a circle, making little excursions,
but always coming back to the one thing."Some drunken visitor to the road-house."He could have killed himself for the words the moment they were spoken."It is not just to judge anyone before you hear the story.""I must get up and go on duty."When the nurse
came in with the belated ammonia, she found K. making an arbitrary
ruling, and Sidney looking up at him mutinously."Miss Page is not to go on duty to-day.She is to stay in bed until
further orders."The confusion in Sidney's mind cleared away suddenly.It was K. who had performed the miracle operation--K. who
had dared and perhaps won!Dear K., with his steady eyes and his long
surgeon's fingers!Then, because she seemed to see ahead as well as
back into the past in that flash that comes to the drowning and to those
recovering from shock, and because she knew that now the little house
would no longer be home to K., she turned her face into her pillow and
cried.Her lover was not true and might
be dying; her friend would go away to his own world, which was not the
Street.K. left her at last and went back to Seventeen, where Dr.If Max would only open
his eyes, so he could tell him what had been in his mind all these
years--his pride in him and all that.With a sort of belated desire to make up for where he had failed, he put
the bag that had been Max's bete noir on the bedside table, and began
to clear it of rubbish--odd bits of dirty cotton, the tubing from a long
defunct stethoscope, glass from a broken bottle, a scrap of paper on
which was a memorandum, in his illegible writing, to send Max a check
for his graduating suit.When K. came in, he had the old dog-collar in
his hand."Belonged to an old collie of ours," he said heavily."Milkman ran over
him and killed him.Max chased the wagon and licked the driver with his
own whip."Got him in
a grape-basket."CHAPTER XXVI


Max had rallied well, and things looked bright for him.His patient did
not need him, but K. was anxious to find Joe; so he telephoned the
gas office and got a day off.The sordid little tragedy was easy to
reconstruct, except that, like Joe, K. did not believe in the innocence
of the excursion to Schwitter's.His spirit was heavy with the
conviction that he had saved Wilson to make Sidney ultimately wretched.And it is doubtful if the Street would
have been greatly concerned even had it known.It had never heard of
Edwardes, of the Edwardes clinic or the Edwardes operation.Its medical
knowledge comprised the two Wilsons and the osteopath around the corner.When, as would happen soon, it learned of Max Wilson's injury, it would
be more concerned with his chances of recovery than with the manner of
it.But Joe's affair with Sidney had been the talk of the neighborhood.If
the boy disappeared, a scandal would be inevitable.Twenty people had
seen him at Schwitter's and would know him again.At first it seemed as if the boy had frustrated him.Christine, waylaying K. in the little hall, told him
that.She
says Joe has not been home all night.She says he looks up to you, and
she thought if you could find him and would talk to him--"

"Joe was with me last night.Drummond he was in good spirits, and that she's not to worry.I feel sure she will hear from him to-day.Something went wrong with his
car, perhaps, after he left me."Katie brought his coffee to his room,
and he drank it standing.He was working out a theory about the boy.Beyond Schwitter's the highroad stretched, broad and inviting, across
the State.Either he would have gone that way, his little car eating up
the miles all that night, or--K. would not formulate his fear of what
might have happened, even to himself.As he went down the Street, he saw Mrs.McKee in her doorway, with a
little knot of people around her.The Street was getting the night's
news.He rented a car at a local garage, and drove himself out into the
country.He was not minded to have any eyes on him that day.Bill was
scrubbing the porch, and a farmhand was gathering bottles from the grass
into a box.The dead lanterns swung in the morning air, and from back on
the hill came the staccato sounds of a reaping-machine.He recognized K., and, mopping dry a part of the porch,
shoved a chair on it.Well, how's the man who got his last night?"County detectives were here bright and early.That's what this house
is--money.""Bill, did you see the man who fired that shot last night?"A sort of haze came over Bill's face, as if he had dropped a curtain
before his eyes.But his reply came promptly:

"Surest thing in the world.Dark man,
about thirty, small mustache--"

"Bill, you're lying, and I know it.The barkeeper kept his head, but his color changed.He thrust his mop into the pail.He's been out at the barn all night."The farmhand had filled his box and disappeared around the corner of the
house.K. put his hand on Bill's shirt-sleeved arm."We've got to get him away from here, Bill."The county men may come back to search the premises.""How do I know you aren't one of them?"As a matter of fact,
I followed him here; but I was too late.Did he take the revolver away
with him?"After all, it was a good world:
Tillie with her baby in her arms; Wilson conscious and rallying; Joe
safe, and, without the revolver, secure from his own remorse.Other
things there were, too--the feel of Sidney's inert body in his arms, the
way she had turned to him in trouble.It was not what he wanted, this
last, but it was worth while.The reaping-machine was in sight now; it
had stopped on the hillside.The men were drinking out of a bucket that
flashed in the sun.What had come over Wilson, to do so reckless
a thing?K., who was a one-woman man, could not explain it.From inside the bar Bill took a careful survey of Le Moyne.He noted his
tall figure and shabby suit, the slight stoop, the hair graying over his
ears.Barkeepers know men: that's a part of the job.After his survey he
went behind the bar and got the revolver from under an overturned pail."Now," he said quietly, "where is he?""In my room--top of the house."He remembered the day when he had sat
waiting in the parlor, and had heard Tillie's slow step coming down.And last night he himself had carried down Wilson's unconscious figure.Surely the wages of sin were wretchedness and misery.From nails in the rafters hung Bill's holiday wardrobe.A tin cup and a
cracked pitcher of spring water stood on the window-sill.Joe was sitting in the corner farthest from the window.When the door
swung open, he looked up.He showed no interest on seeing K., who had to
stoop to enter the low room.You're damned glad you didn't, and so am I.""But never mind about that, Joe;
I'll get some."Loud calls from below took Bill out of the room.As he closed the door
behind him, K.'s voice took on a new tone: "Joe, why did you do it?""You saw him with somebody at the White Springs, and followed them?"I did it, and I'll stand by
it.""Has it occurred to you that you made a mistake?""Go and tell that to somebody who'll believe you!""They
came here and took a room.I'd do it again
if I had a chance, and do it better."I got here not two minutes after you left.Sidney was not out of the hospital
last night.She attended a lecture, and then an operation."It was undoubtedly a relief to him to know that it had not
been Sidney; but if K. expected any remorse, he did not get it."If he is that sort, he deserves what he got," said the boy grimly.The hours he had spent
alone in the little room had been very bitter, and preceded by a time
that he shuddered to remember.K. got it by degrees--his descent of the
staircase, leaving Wilson lying on the landing above; his resolve to
walk back and surrender himself at Schwitter's, so that there could be
no mistake as to who had committed the crime."I intended to write a confession and then shoot myself," he told K."But the barkeeper got my gun out of my pocket.And--"

After a pause: "Does she know who did it?""Then, if he gets better, she'll marry him anyhow."The thing we've got to do is to
hush the thing up, and get you away.""I'd go to Cuba, but I haven't the money.""Sidney need never know who did it."There are times when some cataclysm tears down the walls of reserve
between men.That time had come for Joe, and to a lesser extent for K.
The boy rose and followed him to the door."Why don't you tell her the whole thing?--the whole filthy story?"Schwitter had taken in five hundred dollars the previous day."Five hundred gross," the little man hastened to explain.It's going hard
with her, just now, that she hasn't any women friends about.It's in the
safe, in cash; I haven't had time to take it to the bank."He seemed
to apologize to himself for the unbusinesslike proceeding of lending
an entire day's gross receipts on no security."It's better to get him
away, of course.I have tried to have an orderly
place.If they arrest him here--"

His voice trailed off.He had come a far way from the day he had walked
down the Street, and eyed Its poplars with appraising eyes--a far way.Now he had a son, and the child's mother looked at him with tragic eyes.It was arranged that K. should go back to town, returning late that
night to pick up Joe at a lonely point on the road, and to drive him to
a railroad station.But, as it happened, he went back that afternoon.He had told Schwitter he would be at the hospital, and the message found
him there.Wilson was holding his own, conscious now and making a hard
fight.The message from Schwitter was very brief:--

"Something has happened, and Tillie wants you.I don't like to trouble
you again, but she--wants you."K. was rather gray of face by that time, having had no sleep and little
food since the day before.But he got into the rented machine again--its
rental was running up; he tried to forget it--and turned it toward
Hillfoot.But first of all he drove back to the Street, and walked
without ringing into Mrs.McKee's approaching change of state had
altered the "mealing" house.The ticket-punch still lay on the hat-rack
in the hall.Through the rusty screen of the back parlor window one
viewed the spiraea, still in need of spraying.McKee herself was in
the pantry, placing one slice of tomato and three small lettuce leaves
on each of an interminable succession of plates."I've got a car at the door," he announced, "and there's nothing so
extravagant as an empty seat in an automobile.Being of the class who believe a boudoir cap the
ideal headdress for a motor-car, she apologized for having none."If I'd known you were coming I would have borrowed a cap," she said."Miss Tripp, third floor front, has a nice one.If you'll take me in my
toque--"

K. said he'd take her in her toque, and waited with some anxiety,
having not the faintest idea what a toque was.He was not without other
anxieties.What if the sight of Tillie's baby did not do all that he
expected?And Schwitter had been very
vague.But here K. was more sure of himself: the little man's voice had
expressed as exactly as words the sense of a bereavement that was not a
grief.McKee's old fondness for the girl to bring them
together.But, as they neared the house with its lanterns and tables,
its whitewashed stones outlining the drive, its small upper window
behind which Joe was waiting for night, his heart failed him, rather.He
had a masculine dislike for meddling, and yet--Mrs.McKee had suddenly
seen the name in the wooden arch over the gate: "Schwitter's.""I'm not going in there, Mr."Tillie's not in the house."She didn't approve of all that went on there, so she moved out.It's
very comfortable and clean; it smells of hay.You'd be surprised how
nice it is.""She's late with her conscience,
I'm thinking.""Last night," K. remarked, hands on the wheel, but car stopped, "she
had a child there.It--it's rather like very old times, isn't it?McKee, not in a manger, of course."McKee's tone, which had been fierce at
the beginning, ended feebly."I want you to go in and visit her, as you would any woman who'd had a
new baby and needed a friend.Tell her you've been wanting to see her.""Lie a little, for your soul's sake."She wavered, and while she wavered he drove her in under the arch with
the shameful name, and back to the barn.But there he had the tact to
remain in the car, and Mrs.McKee's peace with Tillie was made alone.When, five minutes later, she beckoned him from the door of the barn,
her eyes were red.They're going
to be married right away."The clergyman was coming along the path with Schwitter at his heels.At the door to Tillie's room he uncovered his head.Lorenz had saved Palmer Howe's
credit.On the strength of the deposit, he borrowed a thousand at the
bank with which he meant to pay his bills, arrears at the University and
Country Clubs, a hundred dollars lost throwing aces with poker dice, and
various small obligations of Christine's.He drank nothing for a week,
went into the details of the new venture with Christine's father, sat at
home with Christine on her balcony in the evenings.With the knowledge
that he could pay his debts, he postponed the day.He liked the feeling
of a bank account in four figures.The first evening or two Christine's pleasure in having him there
gratified him.He felt kind, magnanimous, almost virtuous.On the third
evening he was restless.It occurred to him that his wife was beginning
to take his presence as a matter of course.When he found that the ice was out and the beer warm and flat, he was
furious.Christine had been making a fight, although her heart was only half
in it.She was resolutely good-humored, ignored the past, dressed for
Palmer in the things he liked.They still took their dinners at the
Lorenz house up the street.When she saw that the haphazard table
service there irritated him, she coaxed her mother into getting a
butler.The Street sniffed at the butler behind his stately back.Secretly and
in its heart, it was proud of him.With a half-dozen automobiles, and
Christine Howe putting on low neck in the evenings, and now a butler,
not to mention Harriet Kennedy's Mimi, it ceased to pride itself on
its commonplaceness, ignorant of the fact that in its very lack of
affectation had lain its charm.On the night that Joe shot Max Wilson, Palmer was noticeably restless.He had seen Grace Irving that day for the first time but once since
the motor accident.To do him justice, his dissipation of the past few
months had not included women.Perhaps she typified the
care-free days before his marriage; perhaps the attraction was deeper,
fundamental.He met her in the street the day before Max Wilson was
shot.The sight of her walking sedately along in her shop-girl's black
dress had been enough to set his pulses racing.When he saw that she
meant to pass him, he fell into step beside her."I believe you were going to cut me!"And, after a second's hesitation: "I'm keeping straight, too.""Do you have to walk as fast as this?"Once a week I get off a little early.I--"

He eyed her suspiciously.The Rosenfeld boy is still there, you know."But a moment later he burst out irritably:--

"That was an accident, Grace.The boy took the chance when he engaged
to drive the car.I dream of the little
devil sometimes, lying there.I'll tell you what I'll do," he added
magnanimously."I'll stop in and talk to Wilson.He ought to have done
something before this."I don't think you can do anything for
him, unless--"

The monstrous injustice of the thing overcame her.Palmer and she
walking about, and the boy lying on his hot bed!If you could give her some money, it would
help.""You owe him too, don't you?I don't see that I'm under any
obligation, anyhow.I paid his board for two months in the hospital."When she did not acknowledge this generosity,--amounting to forty-eight
dollars,--his irritation grew.Her manner
galled him, into the bargain.She was too calm in his presence, too
cold.Where she had once palpitated visibly under his warm gaze, she was
now self-possessed and quiet.Where it had pleased his pride to think
that he had given her up, he found that the shoe was on the other foot.At the entrance to a side street she stopped.The next day he drew the thousand dollars from the bank.A good many
of his debts he wanted to pay in cash; there was no use putting checks
through, with incriminating indorsements.Also, he liked the idea of
carrying a roll of money around.The big fellows at the clubs always had
a wad and peeled off bills like skin off an onion.He took a couple of
drinks to celebrate his approaching immunity from debt.He played auction bridge that afternoon in a private room at one of the
hotels with the three men he had lunched with.He won eighty dollars, and thrust it loose in his trousers pocket.If he could carry the thousand around for a
day or so, something pretty good might come of it.When the game was over, he
bought drinks to celebrate his victory.The losers treated, too, to show
they were no pikers.He offered to put up
the eighty and throw for it.The losers mentioned dinner and various
engagements.Christine would greet him with raised
eyebrows.They would eat a stuffy Lorenz dinner, and in the evening
Christine would sit in the lamplight and drive him mad with soft music.He wanted lights, noise, the smiles of women.Luck was with him, and he
wanted to be happy.At nine o'clock that night he found Grace.She had moved to a cheap
apartment which she shared with two other girls from the store.His drunkenness was of the mind, mostly.The lines from his nose to the corners of his mouth were
slightly accentuated, his eyes open a trifle wider than usual.That
and a slight paleness of the nostrils were the only evidences of his
condition.She retreated before him, her eyes watchful.Men in his condition were
apt to be as quick with a blow as with a caress.But, having gained his
point, he was amiable.We can take in a roof-garden.""I've told you I'm not doing that sort of thing.""You've got somebody else on the string."There--there has never been anybody else, Palmer."He caught her suddenly and jerked her toward him."You let me hear of anybody else, and I'll cut the guts out of him!"He held her for a second, his face black and fierce.Then, slowly and
inevitably, he drew her into his arms.But, in the queer loyalty of her class, he was the only man she had
cared for.Sandra went to the hallway.She took him for that moment, felt his hot
kisses on her mouth, her throat, submitted while his rather brutal
hands bruised her arms in fierce caresses.Then she put him from her
resolutely.But he was less steady than he had been.The heat of the little flat
brought more blood to his head.He wavered as he stood just inside the
door.She's in love with a fellow at the house.""Lemme come in and sit down, won't you?"She let him pass her into the sitting-room."You've turned me down, and now Christine--she thinks I don't know.I'm
no fool; I see a lot of things.I know that I've made her
miserable.But I made a merry little hell for you too, and you don't
kick about it."Nothing else, perhaps, could have shown her so well what a broken reed
he was.You were a good girl before I knew you.I'm not going to do you any harm, I swear it.I only
wanted to take you out for a good time.He
drew out the roll of bills and showed it to her.She had never known him to have much money.A new look flashed into her eyes, not cupidity, but purpose."Aren't you going to give me some of that?"The very drunk have the intuition sometimes of savages or brute beasts.He thrust it back into his pocket, but his hand retained its grasp of
it."Don't lemme be happy for a minute!"You give me that for the Rosenfeld boy, and I'll go out with you.""If I give you all that, I won't have any money to go out with!""I'm no piker," he said largely.He held it out to her, and from another pocket produced the eighty
dollars, in crushed and wrinkled notes."It's my lucky day," he said thickly.His head dropped back on his chair; he propped his sagging legs on a
stool.She knew him--knew that he would sleep almost all night.She would have to make up something to tell the other girls; but no
matter--she could attend to that later.She had never had a thousand dollars in her hands before.She paused, in
pinning on her hat, to count the bills.CHAPTER XXVII


K. spent all of the evening of that day with Wilson.He was not to go
for Joe until eleven o'clock.The injured man's vitality was standing
him in good stead.He had asked for Sidney and she was at his bedside.The office is full, they tell me," he said, bending
over the bed."I'll come in later, and if they'll make me a shakedown,
I'll stay with you to-night.""Get some sleep...I've been a
poor stick...try to do better--" His roving eyes fell on the dog collar
on the stand.he said, and put his hand over
Dr.Ed's, as it lay on the bed.K. found Sidney in the room, not sitting, but standing by the window.One shaded light burned in a far corner.It seemed to K. that she looked at
him as if she had never really seen him before, and he was right.Sidney was trying to reconcile the K. she had known so well with this
new K., no longer obscure, although still shabby, whose height had
suddenly become presence, whose quiet was the quiet of infinite power.She was suddenly shy of him, as he stood looking down at her.He saw the
gleam of her engagement ring on her finger.As
though she had meant by wearing it to emphasize her belief in her lover.They did not speak beyond their greeting, until he had gone over the
record.Then:--

"We can't talk here.Far away was the
night nurse's desk, with its lamp, its annunciator, its pile of records.The passage floor reflected the light on glistening boards."I have been thinking until I am almost crazy, K. And now I know how it
happened."The principal thing is, not how it happened, but that he is going to
get well, Sidney."She stood looking down, twisting her ring around her finger."We are going to get him away to-night.He'll
get off safely, I think."You shoulder all our
troubles, K., as if they were your own."You mean--but my part in
getting Joe off is practically nothing.As a matter of fact, Schwitter
has put up the money.My total capital in the world, after paying the
taxicab to-day, is seven dollars."Tillie married
and has a baby--all in twenty-four hours!Squalled like a maniac when the water went on its head."She said she would have to go in her toque."You find Max and save him--don't look like
that!And you get Joe away, borrowing money to send
him.And as if that isn't enough, when you ought to have been getting
some sleep, you are out taking a friend to Tillie, and being godfather
to the baby."I--"

"When I look back and remember how all these months I've been talking
about service, and you said nothing at all, and all the time you were
living what I preached--I'm so ashamed, K."She saw that, and tried to
smile.I'm to take him across the country to the railroad.I was
wondering--"

"Yes?""I'd better explain first what happened, and why it happened.Then if
you are willing to send him a line, I think it would help.He saw a girl
in white in the car and followed in his own machine.He thought it was
you, of course.He didn't like the idea of your going to Schwitter's.And Schwitter and--and Wilson took her upstairs
to a room."I feel very guilty, K., as if it all comes back to
me.He watched her go down the hall toward the night nurse's desk.He would
have given everything just then for the right to call her back, to take
her in his arms and comfort her.He himself had
gone through loneliness and heartache, and the shadow was still on him.He waited until he saw her sit down at the desk and take up a pen.Then
he went back into the quiet room.He stood by the bedside, looking down.Wilson was breathing quietly: his
color was coming up, as he rallied from the shock.'s mind now was
just one thought--to bring him through for Sidney, and then to go away.He could do
sanitation work, or he might try the Canal.The Street would go on working out its own salvation.He would have
to think of something for the Rosenfelds.But there again, perhaps it would be better if he went away.Christine's story would have to work itself out.He was glad in a way that Sidney had asked no questions about him, had
accepted his new identity so calmly.It had been overshadowed by the
night tragedy.It would have pleased him if she had shown more interest,
of course.It was enough, he told himself, that he
had helped her, that she counted on him.But more and more he knew in
his heart that it was not enough."I'd better get away from here," he
told himself savagely.And having taken the first step toward flight, as happens in such cases,
he was suddenly panicky with fear, fear that he would get out of hand,
and take her in his arms, whether or no; a temptation to run from
temptation, to cut everything and go with Joe that night.But there
his sense of humor saved him.That would be a sight for the gods, two
defeated lovers flying together under the soft September moon.He thought it was Sidney and turned with the
light in his eyes that was only for her.She wore a dark skirt and white waist and her
high heels tapped as she crossed the room.Of course it will be a day or two before we are quite
sure."She stood looking down at Wilson's quiet figure."I guess you know I've been crazy about him," she said quietly.I played his game and
I--lost.Quite suddenly she dropped on her knees beside the bed, and put her
cheek close to the sleeping man's hand.When after a moment she rose,
she was controlled again, calm, very white.Edwardes, when he is conscious, that I came in
and said good-bye?"She hesitated, as if the thought tempted her.But K. could not let her go like that.I'm about through with my training, but I've lost my
diploma.""I don't like to see you going away like this."She avoided his eyes, but his kindly tone did what neither the Head nor
the Executive Committee had done that day.One way and another I've known you a long time.""I'll tell you where I live, and--"

"I know where you live."I've tried twice for a diploma and failed.But in the end he prevailed on her to promise not to leave the city
until she had seen him again.It was not until she had gone, a straight
figure with haunted eyes, that he reflected whimsically that once again
he had defeated his own plans for flight.In the corridor outside the door Carlotta hesitated.He was kind; he was going to do something for her.But the old instinct of self-preservation prevailed.Sidney brought her letter to Joe back to K. She was flushed with the
effort and with a new excitement."This is the letter, K., and--I haven't been able to say what I wanted,
exactly.You'll let him know, won't you, how I feel, and how I blame
myself?"Somebody has sent Johnny Rosenfeld a lot of money.The ward nurse wants
you to come back."The well-ordered beds of the daytime
were chaotic now, torn apart by tossing figures.The night was hot and
an electric fan hummed in a far corner.Under its sporadic breezes, as
it turned, the ward was trying to sleep.He was sure it was there, for ever
since it came his hot hand had clutched it.He was quite sure that somehow or other K. had had a hand in it.When he
disclaimed it, the boy was bewildered."It'll buy the old lady what she wants for the house, anyhow," he
said."But I hope nobody's took up a collection for me."You can bet your last match he didn't."In some unknown way the news had reached the ward that Johnny's friend,
Mr."He works in the gas office," he said, "I've seen him there.If he's a
surgeon, what's he doing in the gas office.If he's a surgeon, what's he
doing teaching me raffia-work?After
all, he was a man, or almost.Didn't he have a
state license?"They've got a queer story about you here in the ward.""They say that you're a surgeon; that you operated on Dr.They say that you're the king pin where you came from.""I know it's a damn lie, but if it's true--"

"I used to be a surgeon.As a matter of fact I operated on Dr.I--I am rather apologetic, Jack, because I didn't explain to
you sooner.For--various reasons--I gave up that--that line of business."Don't you think you could do something for me, sir?"When K. did not reply at once, he launched into an explanation."I've been lying here a good while.I didn't say much because I knew I'd
have to take a chance.Either I'd pull through or I wouldn't, and the
odds were--well, I didn't say much.The old lady's had a lot of trouble.But now, with THIS under my pillow for her, I've got a right to ask.I'll take a chance, if you will."But lie here and watch these soaks off the street.Old, a
lot of them, and gettin' well to go out and starve, and--My God!Le
Moyne, they can walk, and I can't."He had started, and now he must go on.Faith in
himself or no faith, he must go on.Life, that had loosed its hold on
him for a time, had found him again."I'll go over you carefully to-morrow, Jack.I'll tell you your chances
honestly."Whatever you charge--"

"I'll take it out of my board bill in the new house!"At four o'clock that morning K. got back from seeing Joe off.Over Sidney's letter Joe had shed a shamefaced tear or two.And during
the night ride, with K. pushing the car to the utmost, he had felt that
the boy, in keeping his hand in his pocket, had kept it on the letter.When the road was smooth and stretched ahead, a gray-white line into the
night, he tried to talk a little courage into the boy's sick heart."You'll see new people, new life," he said."In a month from now you'll
wonder why you ever hung around the Street.I have a feeling that you're
going to make good down there."And once, when the time for parting was very near,--"No matter what
happens, keep on believing in yourself.Joe's response showed his entire self-engrossment."If he dies, I'm a murderer.""He's not going to die," said K. stoutly.At four o'clock in the morning he left the car at the garage and walked
around to the little house.He had had no sleep for forty-five hours;
his eyes were sunken in his head; the skin over his temples looked drawn
and white.His clothes were wrinkled; the soft hat he habitually wore
was white with the dust of the road.As he opened the hall door, Christine stirred in the room beyond.Why in the world aren't you in bed?""Palmer has just come home in a terrible rage.He says he's been robbed
of a thousand dollars.""He doesn't know, or says he doesn't.In the dim hall light he realized that her face was strained and set.The tender words broke down the last barrier of her self-control.She held her arms out to him, and because he was very tired and lonely,
