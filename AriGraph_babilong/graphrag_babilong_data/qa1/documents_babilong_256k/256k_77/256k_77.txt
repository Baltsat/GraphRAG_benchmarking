said Bruin, "I should say I did.He hasn't been in our part
of the wood again, has he?""He is not likely to go anywhere for a long
time, I should say.He has broken his leg, Chipper tells me, and has
been shut up in his cavern for a week and more."How
does the poor old man get his food?""Chipper didn't seem to think he _could_ get any," replied the squirrel."He peeped in at the door, yesterday, and saw him lying in his bunk,
looking very pale and thin.He tried once or twice to get up, but fell
back again; and Chipper is sure there was nothing to eat in the cave.I
thought I wouldn't say anything to <DW53> or Toto last night, but would
wait till I had told you.""I will go
myself, and take care of the poor man till his leg is well.Where are
the Madam and Toto?The blind grandmother was in the kitchen, rolling out pie-crust.She
listened, with exclamations of pity and concern, to Cracker's account of
the poor old hermit, and agreed with Bruin that aid must be sent to him
without delay."I will pack a basket at once," she said, "with
nourishing food, bandages for the broken leg, and some simple medicines;
and Toto, you will take it to the poor man, will you not, dear?"But Bruin said: "No, dear Madam!Our Toto's heart is
big, but he is not strong enough to take care of a sick person.It is
surely best for me to go.""Dear Bruin," she said, "of course you
_would_ be the best nurse on many accounts; but if the man is weak and
nervous, I am afraid--you alarmed him once, you know, and possibly the
sight of you, coming in suddenly, might--"

"Speak out, Granny!""You think Bruin would simply
frighten the man to death, or at best into a fit; and you are quite
right.he added, turning to Bruin, who
looked sadly crestfallen at this throwing of cold water on the fire of
his kindly intentions, "we will go together, and then the whole thing
will be easily managed.I will go in first, and tell the hermit all
about you; and then, when his mind is prepared, you can come in and make
him comfortable."The good bear brightened up at this, and gladly assented to Toto's
proposition; and the two set out shortly after, Bruin carrying a large
basket of food, and Toto a small one containing medicines and bandages.Part of the food was for their own lunch, as they had a long walk before
them, and would not be back till long past dinner-time.They trudged
briskly along,--Toto whistling merrily as usual, but his companion very
grave and silent.asked the boy, when a couple of miles had
been traversed in this manner."Has our account of the wedding made you
pine with envy, and wish yourself a mouse?"replied the bear, slowly, "oh, no!I should not like to be a
mouse, or anything of that sort.But I do wish, Toto, that I was not so
frightfully ugly!"cried Toto, indignantly, "who said you were ugly?What put such
an idea into your head?""Why, you yourself," said the bear, sadly."You said I would frighten
the man to death, or into a fit.Now, one must be horribly ugly to do
that, you know.""My _dear_ Bruin," cried Toto, "it isn't because you are _ugly_; why,
you are a perfect beauty--for a bear.But--well--you are _very_ large,
you know, and somewhat shaggy, if you don't mind my saying so; and you
must remember that most bears are very savage, disagreeable creatures.How is anybody who sees you for the first time to know that you are the
best and dearest old fellow in the world?Besides," he added, "have you
forgotten how you frightened this very hermit when he stole your honey,
last year?"Bruin hung his head, and looked very sheepish."I shouldn't roar, now,
of course," he said."I meant to be very gentle, and just put one paw
in, and then the end of my nose, and so get into the cave by degrees,
you know."Toto had his doubts as to the soothing effect which would have been
produced by this singular measure, but he had not the heart to say so;
and after a pause, Bruin continued:--

"Of course, however, you and Madam were quite right,--quite right you
were, my boy.But I was wondering, just now, whether there were not
some way of making myself less frightful.Now, you and Madam have no
hair on your faces,--none anywhere, in fact, except a very little on the
top of your head.That gives you a gentle expression, you see.Do you
think--would it be possible--would you advise me to--to--in fact, to
shave the hair off my face?"The excellent bear looked wistfully at Toto, to mark the effect of this
proposition; but Toto, after struggling for some moments to preserve his
gravity, burst into a peal of laughter, so loud and clear that it woke
the echoes of the forest.Bruin,
dear, you really _must_ excuse me, but I cannot help it.Bruin looked hurt and vexed for a moment, but it was only a moment.Toto's laughter was too contagious to be resisted; the worthy bear's
features relaxed, and the next instant he was laughing himself,--or
coming as near to it as a black bear can."I am a foolish old fellow, I suppose!""We will say no more
about it, Toto.It sounded like a crow,
only it was too feeble."They listened, and presently the sound was heard again; and this time it
certainly was a faint but distinct "Caw!"and apparently at no great
distance from them.The two companions looked about, and soon saw the
owner of the voice perched on a stump, and croaking dismally.A more
miserable-looking bird was never seen.His feathers drooped in limp
disorder, and evidently had not been trimmed for days; his eyes were
half-shut, and save when he opened his beak to utter a despairing "Caw!"he might have been mistaken for a stuffed bird,--and a badly stuffed
bird at that.shouted Toto, in his cheery voice."What is the matter
that you look so down in the beak?"The crow raised his head, and looked sadly at the two strangers."I am
sick," he said, "and I can't get anything to eat for myself or my
master.""He is a hermit," replied the crow."He lives in a cave near by; but
last week he broke his leg, and has not been able to move since then.He
has nothing to eat, for he will not touch raw snails, and I cannot find
anything else for him.I fear he will die soon, and I shall probably die
too."said the bear, "don't let me hear any nonsense of that
kind.Here, take that, sir, and don't talk foolishness!""That" was neither more nor less than the wing of a roast chicken which
Bruin had pulled hastily from the basket.The famished crow fell upon
it, beak and claw, without more ado; and a silence ensued, while the two
friends, well pleased, watched the first effect of their charitable
mission."Were you ever so hungry as that, Bruin?"said the bear, carelessly, "often and often.When I came out
in the spring, you know.But I never stayed hungry very long," he
added, with a significant grimace."This crow is sick, you see, and
probably cannot help himself much.he
said, addressing the crow, who had polished the chicken-bone till it
shone again, and now looked up with a twinkle in his eyes very different
from the wretched, lacklustre expression they had at first worn.he said warmly; "you have positively
given me life.And now, tell me how I can serve
you, for you are evidently bent on some errand.""We have come to see your master," said Toto."We heard of his accident,
and thought he must be in need of help.So, if you will show us the
way--"

The crow needed no more, but joyfully spread his wings, and half hopped,
half fluttered along the ground as fast as he could go.he cried, "our humble dwelling is close at hand.Follow me,
I pray you, and blessings attend your footsteps."The two friends followed, and soon came upon the entrance to a cave,
around which a sort of rustic porch had been built.Vines were trained
over it, and a rude chair and table stood beneath the pleasant shade."This is my master's study," said the crow."Here we have spent many
happy and profitable hours.May it please you to enter, worshipful
sirs?"asked Toto, glancing at his companion."Shall
we go in, or send the crow first, to announce us?""You had better go in alone," said the bear, decidedly."I will stay
here with Master Crow, and when--that is, _if_ you think it best for me
to come in, later, you have but to call me."Accordingly Toto entered the cavern, which was dimly lighted by a hole
in the roof.As soon as his eyes became accustomed to the gloom, he
perceived a rude pallet at one side, on which was stretched the form of
a tall old man.His long white hair and beard were matted and tangled;
his thin hands lay helpless by his side; it seemed as if he were
scarcely alive.He opened his eyes, however, at the sound of footsteps,
and looked half-fearfully at the boy, who bent softly over him.said Toto, not knowing what else to say."Is your
leg better, to-day?"murmured the old man, feebly.He started for the mouth of the cave, but before he reached it, a huge,
shaggy, black paw was thrust in at the aperture, holding out a bark
dish, while a sort of enormous whisper, which just _was_ not a growl,
murmured, "Here it is!""Thank you, Bru--I mean, thank you!"said Toto, in some confusion,
glancing apprehensively toward the bed.But the old man noticed nothing,
till the clear cool water was held to his lips.He drank eagerly, and
seemed to gain a little strength at once, for he now gazed earnestly at
Toto, and presently said, in a feeble voice:--

"Who are you, dear child, and what good angel has sent you to save my
life?""My name is Toto," replied the boy."As to how I came here, I will tell
you all that by-and-by; but now you are too weak either to talk or to
listen, and I must see at once about getting you some--"

"_Food!_" came the huge whisper again, rolling like a distant muttering
of thunder through the cavern; and again the shaggy paw appeared,
solemnly waving a bowl of jelly.Toto flew to take it, but paused for a moment, overcome with amusement
at the aspect presented by his friend.The good bear had wedged his huge
bulk tightly into a corner behind a jutting fragment of rock.Here he
sat, with the basket of provisions between his knees, and an air of deep
and solemn mystery in his look and bearing.Not seeing Toto, he still
held the bowl of jelly in his outstretched paw, and opening his
cavernous jaws, was about to send out another rolling thunder-whisper of
"Food!"when Toto sprang quickly on the jelly, and taking a spoon from
the basket, rapped the bear on the nose with it, and then returned to
his charge.The poor hermit submitted meekly to being fed with a spoon, and at every
mouthful seemed to gain strength.A faint color stole into his wan
cheek, his eyes brightened, and before the bowl was two thirds empty, he
actually smiled."I little thought I should ever taste jelly again," he said."Indeed, I
had fully made up my mind that I must starve to death here; for I was
unable to move, and never thought of human aid coming to me in this
lonely spot.Even my poor crow, my faithful companion for many years,
has left me.I trust he has found some other shelter, for he was feeble
and lame, himself.""It was he who showed us the
way here; and he's outside now, talking to--that is--talking to himself,
you know."Why does he not come in, and let me thank him also for his kindness?""He--oh--he--he doesn't like to be
thanked."I
am distressed to think of his staying outside."He isn't a boy," said Toto.what a muddle I'm making of it!He's bigger than a boy, sir, a great deal bigger.And--I hope you won't
mind, but--he's black!""My dear boy, I have no
prejudice against the Ethiopian race.I believe they are generally called either
Caesar or Pompey.Pomp--"

"Oh, stop!""His name _isn't_ Pompey, it's
Bruin.And he wouldn't come in yet if I were to--"

"Cut him into inch pieces!"came rolling like muffled thunder through
the doorway.The old hermit started as if he had been shot.He is the best,
dearest, kindest old fellow _in the world_, and it isn't his fault,
because he was--"

"Born so!"resounded from without; and the poor hermit, now speechless
with terror, could only gasp, and gaze at Toto with eyes of agonized
entreaty."And we might have been bears
ourselves, you know, if we had happened to have them for fathers and
mothers; so--" But here he paused in dismay, for the hermit, without
more ado, quietly fainted away."I am afraid he is dead, or
dying.At this summons the crow came hopping and fluttering in, followed by the
unhappy bear, who skulked along, hugging the wall and making himself as
small as possible, while he cast shamefaced and apologetic glances
toward the bed."Oh, you needn't mind now!"Do
you think he is dead, Crow?But the crow never had; and the three were standing beside the bed in
mute dismay, when suddenly a light flutter of wings was heard, and a
soft voice cooed, "Toto!and the next moment Pigeon Pretty came
flying into the cave, with a bunch of dried leaves in her bill.A glance
showed her the situation, and alighting softly on the old man's breast
she held the leaves to his nostrils, fanning him the while with her
outspread wings.she said, "I have flown so fast I am quite out of breath.You see,
dears, I was afraid that something of this sort might happen, as soon as
I heard of your going.I was in the barn, you know, when you were
talking about it, and getting ready.So I flew to my old nest and got
these leaves, of which I always keep a store on hand.See, he is
beginning to revive already."In truth, the pungent fragrance of the leaves, which now filled the air,
seemed to have a magical effect on the sick man.His eyelids fluttered,
his lips moved, and he muttered faintly, "The bear!The wood-pigeon motioned to Bruin and Toto to withdraw, which they
speedily did, casting remorseful glances at one another.Silently and
sadly they sat down in the porch, and here poor Bruin abandoned himself
to despair, clutching his shaggy hair, and even pulling out several
handfuls of it, while he inwardly called himself by every hard name he
could think of.Toto sat looking gloomily at his boots for a long time,
but finally he said, in a whisper:--

"Cheer up, old fellow!I do suppose I am the
stupidest boy that ever lived.If I had only managed a little
better--hark!Both listened, and heard the soft voice of the wood-pigeon calling,
"Bruin!Hermit understands all
about it now, and is ready to welcome _both_ his visitors."Much amazed, the two friends rose, and slowly and hesitatingly
re-entered the cave, the bear making more desperate efforts even than
before to conceal his colossal bulk.To his astonishment, however, the
hermit, who was now lying propped up by an improvised pillow of dry
moss, greeted him with an unflinching gaze, and even smiled and held out
his hand.Bruin," he said, "I am glad to meet you, sir!This sweet bird has
told me all about you, and I am sincerely pleased to make your
acquaintance.So you have walked ten miles and more to bring help and
comfort to an old man who stole your honey!"But this was more than the good bear could stand.He sat down on the
ground, and thrusting his great shaggy paws into his eyes, fairly began
to blubber.At this, I am ashamed to say, all the others fell to
laughing.First, Toto laughed--but Toto, bless him!was always
laughing; and then Pigeon Pretty laughed; and then Jim Crow; and then
the hermit; and finally, Bruin himself.And so they all laughed
together, till the forest echoes rang, and the woodchucks almost stirred
in their holes.IT was late in the afternoon of the same day.In the cottage at home all
was quiet and peaceful.The grandmother was taking a nap in her room,
with the squirrel curled up comfortably on the pillow beside her.In the
kitchen, the fire and the kettle were having it all their own way, for
though two other members of the family were in the room, they were
either asleep or absorbed in their own thoughts, for they gave no sign
of their presence.The kettle was in its glory, for Bruin had polished
it that very morning, and it shone like the good red gold.It sang its
merriest song, and puffed out clouds of snow-white steam from its
slender spout.I
feel almost sure that I must have turned into gold, for I never used to
look like this.A golden kettle is rather a rare thing, I flatter
myself.It really seems a pity that there is no one here except the
stupid parrot, who has gone to sleep, and that odious raccoon, who
always looks at me as if I were a black pot, and a cracked pot at that."I admire you immensely, as you know, and it is my
greatest pleasure to see myself reflected in your bright face.cr-r-r-r-rickety!"And they performed
really a very creditable duet together.Now it happened that the parrot was not asleep, though she had had the
bad taste to turn her back on the fire and the kettle.She was looking
out of the window, in fact, and wondering when the wood-pigeon would
come back.Though not a bird of specially affectionate nature, Miss Mary
was still very fond of Pigeon Pretty, and always missed her when she
was away.This afternoon had seemed particularly long, for no one had
been in the kitchen save <DW53>, with whom she was not on very good terms.Now, she thought, it was surely time for her friend to return; and she
stretched her neck, and peered out of the window, hoping to catch the
flutter of the soft brown wings.Instead of this, however, she caught
sight of something else, which made her start and ruffle up her
feathers, and look again with a very different expression.Outside the cottage stood a man,--an ill-looking fellow, with a heavy
pack strapped on his back.He was looking all about him, examining the
outside of the cottage carefully, and evidently listening for any sound
that might come from within.All being silent, he stepped to the window
(not Miss Mary's window, but the other), and took a long survey of the
kitchen; and then, seeing no living creature in it (for the raccoon
under the table and the parrot on her perch were both hidden from his
view), he laid down his pack, opened the door, and quietly stepped in.An ill-looking fellow, Miss Mary had thought him at the first glance;
but now, as she noiselessly turned on her perch and looked more closely
at him, she thought his aspect positively villanous.He had a hooked
nose and a straggling red beard, and his little green eyes twinkled with
an evil light as he looked about the cosey kitchen, with all its neat
and comfortable appointments.First he stepped to the cupboard, and after examining its contents he
drew out a mutton-bone (which had been put away for Bruin), a hunch of
bread, and a cranberry tart, on which he proceeded to make a hearty
meal, without troubling himself about knife or fork.He ate hurriedly,
looking about him the while,--though, curiously enough, he saw neither
of the two pairs of bright eyes which were following his every movement.The parrot on her perch sat motionless, not a feather stirring; the
raccoon under the table lay crouched against the wall, as still as if
he were carved in stone.Even the kettle had stopped singing, and only
sent out a low, perturbed murmur from time to time.His meal finished, the rascal--his confidence increasing as the moments
went by without interruption--proceeded to warm himself well by the
fire, and then on tiptoe to walk about the room, peering into cupboards
and lockers, opening boxes and pulling out drawers.The parrot's blood
boiled with indignation at the sight of this "unfeathered vulture," as
she mentally termed him, ransacking all the Madam's tidy and well-kept
stores; but when he opened the drawer in which lay the six silver
teaspoons (the pride of the cottage), and the porringer that Toto had
inherited from his great-grandfather,--when he opened this drawer, and
with a low whistle of satisfaction drew the precious treasures from
their resting-place, Miss Mary could contain herself no longer, but
clapped her wings and cried in a clear distinct voice, "Stop thief!"The man started violently, and dropping the silver back into the drawer,
looked about him in great alarm.At first he saw no one, but presently
his eyes fell on the parrot, who sat boldly facing him, her yellow eyes
gleaming with anger.His terror changed to fury, and with a muttered
oath he stepped forward."You'll never say 'Stop thief'
again, my fine bird, for I'll wring your neck before I'm half a minute
older."[Illustration: But at this last mishap the robber, now fairly beside
himself, rushed headlong from the cottage.--PAGE 163.]He stretched his hand toward the parrot, who for her part prepared to
fly at him and fight for her life; but at that moment something
happened.There was a rushing in the air; there was a yell as if a dozen
wild-cats had broken loose, and a heavy body fell on the robber's
back,--a body which had teeth and claws (an endless number of claws, it
seemed, and all as sharp as daggers); a body which yelled and scratched
and bit and tore, till the ruffian, half mad with terror and pain,
yelled louder than his assailant.Vainly trying to loosen the clutch
of those iron claws, the wretch staggered backward against the hob.Was
it accident, or did the kettle by design give a plunge, and come down
with a crash, sending a stream of boiling water over his legs?But at this last mishap the robber,
now fairly beside himself, rushed headlong from the cottage, and still
bearing his terrible burden, fled screaming down the road.At the same moment the door of the grandmother's room was opened
hurriedly, and the old lady cried, in a trembling voice, "What has
happened?"<DW53> has--has just
stepped out, with--in fact, with an acquaintance.He will be back
directly, no doubt.""Was that--"

"The acquaintance, dear Madam!""He was
excited!--about something, and he raised his voice, I confess, higher
than good breeding usually allows.The good old lady, still much mystified, though her fears were set at
rest by the parrot's quiet confidence, returned to her room to put on
her cap, and to smooth the pretty white curls which her Toto loved.No
sooner was the door closed than the squirrel, who had been fairly
dancing up and down with curiosity and eagerness, opened a fire of
questions:--

"Who was it?Why didn't you want Madam to know?"Miss Mary entered into a full account of the thrilling adventure, and
had but just finished it when in walked the raccoon, his eyes sparkling,
his tail cocked in its airiest way.cried the parrot, eagerly, "is he gone?""Yes, my dear, he is gone!"Why didn't you come too, Miss Mary?You might
have held on by his hair.Yes, I went on
quite a good bit with him, just to show him the way, you know.And then
I bade him good-by, and begged him to come again; but he didn't say he
would."<DW53> shook himself, and fairly chuckled with glee, as did also his two
companions; but presently Miss Mary, quitting her perch, flew to the
table, and holding out her claw to the raccoon, said gravely:--

"<DW53>, you have saved my life, and perhaps the Madam's and Cracker's
too.Give me your paw, and receive my warmest thanks for your timely
aid.John travelled to the bathroom.We have not been the best of friends, lately," she added, "but I
trust all will be different now.And the next time you are invited to a
party, if you fancy a feather or so to complete your toilet, you have
only to mention it, and I shall be happy to oblige you.""And for my part, Miss Mary," responded the raccoon warmly, "I beg you
to consider me the humblest of your servants from this day forth.If you
fancy any little relish, such as snails or fat spiders, as a change from
your every-day diet, it will be a pleasure to me to procure them for
you.Beauty," he continued, with his most gallant bow, "is enchanting,
and valor is enrapturing; but beauty and valor _combined_, are--"

"Oh, come!"said the squirrel, who felt rather crusty, perhaps, because
he had not seen the fun, and so did not care for the fine speeches,
"stop bowing and scraping to each other, you two, and let us put this
distracted-looking room in order before Madam comes in again.Pick up
the kettle, will you, <DW53>?the water is running all over the
floor."The raccoon did not answer, being apparently very busy setting the
chairs straight; so Cracker repeated his request, in a sharper voice."Do you hear me, <DW53>?I cannot do it
myself, for it is twice as big as I am, but I should think you could
lift it easily, now that it is empty."The raccoon threw a perturbed glance at the kettle, and then said in a
tone which tried to be nonchalant, "Oh!It will
get up, I suppose, when it feels like it.If it should ask me to help
it, of course I would; but perhaps it may prefer the floor for a change.I--I often lie on the floor, myself," he added.The raccoon beckoned him aside, and said in a low tone, "My good
Cracker, Toto _says_ a great many things, and no doubt he thinks they
are all true.But he is a young boy, and, let me tell you, he does _not_
know everything in the world.If that thing is not alive, why did it
jump off its seat just at the critical moment, and pour hot water over
the robber's legs?"And I don't deny that it was a great help, Cracker, and that I was
very glad the kettle did it.when a creature has no more
self-respect than to lie there for a quarter of an hour, with its head
on the other side of the room, without making the smallest attempt to
get up and put itself together again, why, I tell you frankly _I_ don't
feel much like assisting it.You never knew one of _us_ to behave in
that sort of way, did you, now?""But then, if any of us were to lose
our heads, we should be dead, shouldn't we?""And when that thing loses
its head, it _isn't_ dead.It can go without
its head for an hour!I've seen it, when Toto took it off--the head, I
mean--and forgot to put it on again.I tell you, it just _pretends_ to
be dead, so that it can be taken care of, and carried about like a baby,
and given water whenever it is thirsty.A secret, underhand, sly
creature, I call it, and I sha'n't touch it to put its head on again!"And that was all the thanks the kettle got for its pains.CHAPTER X.


WHEN Toto came home, as he did just when night was closing in around the
little cottage, he was whistling merrily, as usual; and the first sound
of his clear and tuneful whistle brought <DW53>, Cracker, and Miss Mary
all running to the door, to greet, to tell, and to warn him.The boy
listened wide-eyed to the story of the attempted robbery, and at the end
of it he drew a long breath of relief."I am _so_ glad you didn't let Granny know!"what a
good fellow you are, <DW53>!And Miss Mary, you are a
trump, and I would give you a golden nose-ring like your Princess's if
you had a nose to wear it on.To think of you two defending the castle,
and putting the enemy to flight, horse, foot, and dragoons!""I don't think he had any
about him, unless it was concealed.He had no horse, either; but he had
two feet,--and very ugly ones they were.He danced on them when the
kettle poured hot water over his legs,--danced higher than ever you did,
Toto."laughed Toto, who was in high spirits.But," he added, "it is so dark that you do not see our
guest, whom I have brought home for a little visit.Thus adjured, the crow hopped solemnly forward, and made his best bow to
the three inmates, who in turn saluted him, each after his or her
fashion.The raccoon was gracious and condescending, the squirrel
familiar and friendly, the parrot frigidly polite, though inwardly
resenting that a crow should be presented to her,--to _her_, the
favorite attendant of the late lamented Princess of Central
Africa,--without her permission having been asked first.As for the
crow, he stood on one leg and blinked at them all in a manner which
meant a great deal or nothing at all, just as you chose to take it.he said, gravely, "it is with pleasure that I
make your acquaintance.May this day be the least happy of your lives!Lady Parrot," he added, addressing himself particularly to Miss Mary,
"grant me the honor of leading you within.The evening air is chill for
one so delicate and fragile."Miss Mary, highly delighted at being addressed by such a stately title
as "Lady Parrot," relaxed at once the severity of her mien, and
gracefully sidled into the house in company with the sable-clad
stranger, while Toto and the two others followed, much amused.After a hearty supper, in the course of which Toto related as much of
his and Bruin's adventures in the hermit's cave as he thought proper,
the whole family gathered around the blazing hearth.Toto brought the
pan of apples and the dish of nuts; the grandmother took up her
knitting, and said, with a smile: "And who will tell us a story, this
evening?We have had none for two evenings now, and it is high time that
we heard something new.Cracker, my dear, is it not your turn?""I think it is," said the squirrel, hastily cramming a couple of very
large nuts into his cheek-pouches, "and if you like, I will tell you a
story that Mrs.It is about a cow that
jumped over the moon.""Why, I've known that story ever since I was a baby!And it isn't a story, either, it's a rhyme,--

    "Hey diddle diddle,
     The cat and the fiddle,
     The cow--"

"Yes, yes!I know, Toto," interrupted the squirrel."She told me that,
too, and said it was a pack of lies, and that people like you didn't
know anything about the real truth of the matter.So now, if you will
just listen to me, I will tell you how it really happened."There once was a young cow, and she had a calf.said Toto, in rather a provoking manner."No, it isn't, it's only the beginning," said the little squirrel,
indignantly; "and if you would rather tell the story yourself, Toto, you
are welcome to do so."Crackey," said Toto, apologetically."Won't do so again,
Crackey; go on, that's a dear!"and the squirrel, who never bore malice
for more than two minutes, put his little huff away, and continued:--

       *       *       *       *       *

This young cow, you see, she was very fond of her calf,--very fond
indeed she was,--and when they took it away from her, she was very
unhappy, and went about roaring all day long.There's a
piece of poetry about it that I learned once:--

    "'The lowing herd--'

do something or other, I don't remember what.""'The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,'"

quoted the grandmother, softly."Yarn, or a chain-pump like the
one in the yard, or what?""I don't know what you mean by _low_, Toto!"said the squirrel, without
noticing <DW53>'s remarks."Your cow roared so loud the other day that I
fell off her horn into the hay.I don't see anything _low_ in that.""Why, Cracker, can't you understand?""They _low_ when they
_moo_!I don't mean that they moo _low_, but'moo' _is_ 'low,' don't you
see?""No, I do _not_ see!""And I don't
believe there is anything _to_ see, I don't.At this point Madam interfered, and with a few gentle words made the
matter clear, and smoothed the ruffled feathers--or rather fur.The raccoon, who had been listening with ears pricked up, and keen eyes
glancing from one to the other of the disputants, now murmured, "Ah,
yes!and relapsed
into his former attitude of graceful and dignified ease.The squirrel repeated to himself, "Moo!several
times, shook his head, refreshed himself with a nut, and finally, at the
general request, continued his story:

       *       *       *       *       *

So, as I said, this young cow was very sad, and she looed--I mean
mowed--all day to express her grief.And she thought, "If I could only
know where my calf is, it would not be quite so dreadfully bad.But they
would not tell me where they were taking him, though I asked them
politely in seven different tones, which is more than any other cow here
can use."Now, when she was thinking these thoughts it chanced that the maid came
to milk the cows, and with the maid came a young man, who was talking
very earnestly to her."Doesn't thee know me well enough?""I knows a moon-calf when I sees him!"says the maid; and with that she
boxed his ears, and sat down to milk the cow, and he went away in a
huff.But the cow heard what the maid said, and began to wonder what
moon-calves were, and whether they were anything like her calf.Presently, when the maid had gone away with the pail of milk, she said
to the Oldest Ox, who happened to be standing near,--

"Old Ox, pray tell me, what is a moon-calf?"The Oldest Ox did not know anything about moon-calves, but he had no
idea of betraying his ignorance to anybody, much less to a very young
cow; so he answered promptly, "It's a calf that lives in the moon, of
course.""Is it--are they--like other calves?"inquired the cow, timidly, "or a
different sort of animal?""When a creature is called a calf," replied the Ox, severely, "it _is_ a
calf.If it were a cat, a hyena, or a toad with three tails, it would be
called by its own name.Then he shut his eyes and pretended to be asleep, for he did not like to
answer questions on matters of which he knew nothing; it fatigued his
brain, and oxen should always avoid fatigue of the brain.But the young cow had one more question to ask, and could not rest till
it was answered; so mustering all her courage, she said, desperately,
"Oh, Old Ox!before you go to sleep, please--_please_, tell me if people
ever take calves to the moon from here?"and in a few minutes he really was asleep.She thought so hard that when
the farmer's boy came to drive the cattle into the barn, she hardly saw
where she was going, but stumbled first against the door and then
against the wall, and finally walked into Old Brindle's stall instead of
her own, and got well prodded by the latter's horns in consequence."I must give her a warm mash,
and cut an inch or two off her tail to-morrow."Next day the cows were driven out into the pasture, for the weather was
warm, and they found it a pleasant change from the barn-yard.They
cropped the honey-clover, well seasoned with buttercups and with just
enough dandelions scattered about to "give it character," as Mother
Brindle said.They stood knee-deep in the cool, clear stream which
flowed under the willows, and lay down in the shade of the great
oak-tree, and altogether were as happy as cows can possibly be.She cared nothing for any of the pleasures
which she had once enjoyed so keenly; she only walked up and down, up
and down, thinking of her lost calf, and looking for the moon.For she
had fully made up her mind by this time that her darling Bossy had been
taken to the moon, and had become a moon-calf; and she was wondering
whether she might not see or hear something of him when the moon rose.The day passed, and when the evening was still all rosy in the west, a
great globe of shining silver rose up in the east.It was the full moon,
coming to take the place of the sun, who had put on his nightcap and
gone to bed.The young cow ran towards it, stretching out her neck, and
calling,--

"Bossy!Then she listened, and thought she heard a distant voice which said,
"There!"she cried, frantically, "I knew it!Bossy is now a
moon-calf.Something must be done about it at once, if I only knew
what!"And she ran to Mother Brindle, who was standing by the fence, talking to
the neighbor's black cow,--her with the spotted nose."Have you ever had a calf taken to the
moon?My calf, my Bossy, is there, and is now a moon-calf.tell me, how to get at him, I beseech you!"You are excited, and will injure your milk, and that would
reflect upon the whole herd.As for your calf, why should you be better
off than other people?I have lost ten calves, the finest that ever were
seen, and I never made half such a fuss about them as you make over this
puny little red creature.""But he is _there_, in the moon!""I must find him
and get him down."Decidedly, your wits must be in the moon, my dear," said the neighbor's
black cow, not unkindly.Who ever heard
of calves in the moon?Not I, for one; and I am not more ignorant than
others, perhaps."The red cow was about to reply, when suddenly across the meadow came
ringing the farm-boy's call, "Co, Boss!said Mother Brindle, "can it really be milking-time?And you,
child," she added, turning to the red cow, "come straight home with me.I heard James promise you a warm mash, and that will be the best thing
for you."But at these words the young cow started, and with a wild bellow ran to
the farthest end of the pasture.she cried, staring wildly up
at the silver globe, which was rising steadily higher and higher in the
sky, "you are going away from me!Jump down from the moon, and come to
your mother!_Come!_"

And then a distant voice, floating softly down through the air,
answered, "Come!"My darling calls me, and I go.I will
go to the moon; I will be a moon-cow!She ran forward like an antelope, gave a sudden leap into the air, and
went up, up, up,--over the haystacks, over the trees, over the
clouds,--up among the stars.in her frantic desire to reach the moon she overshot the
mark; jumped clear over it, and went down on the other side, nobody
knows where, and she never was seen or heard of again.And Mother Brindle, when she saw what had happened, ran straight home
and gobbled up the warm mash before any of the other cows could get
there, and ate so fast that she made herself ill.*       *       *       *       *

"That is the whole story," said the squirrel, seriously; "and it seemed
to me a very curious one, I confess.""But there's nothing about the others in
it,--the cat and fiddle, and the little dog, you know.""Well, they _weren't_ in it really, at all!"Cow ought to be a good judge of lies, I
should say.""What can be expected," said the raccoon loftily, "from a creature who
eats hay?Be good enough to hand me those nuts, Toto, will you?The
story has positively made me hungry,--a thing that has not happened--"

"Since dinner-time!""Wonderful indeed, <DW53>!But I shall
hand the nuts to Cracker first, for he has told us a very good story,
whether it is true or not."THE apples and nuts went round again and again, and for a few minutes
nothing was heard save the cracking of shells and the gnawing of sharp
white teeth.At length the parrot said, meditatively:--

"That was a very stupid cow, though!"Well, I don't think they are what you would call brilliant, as a rule,"
Toto admitted; "but they are generally good, and that is better.""That is probably why we have no
cows in Central Africa.Our animals being all, without exception, clever
_and_ good, there is really no place for creatures of the sort you
describe.""How about the bogghun, Miss Mary?"asked the raccoon, slyly, with a
wink at Toto.The parrot ruffled up her feathers, and was about to make a sharp reply;
but suddenly remembering the raccoon's brave defence of her an hour
before, she smoothed her plumage again, and replied gently,--

"I confess that I forgot the bogghun, <DW53>.It is indeed a treacherous
and a wicked creature!--a dark blot on the golden roll of African
animals."She paused and sighed, then added, as if to change the
subject, "But, come!If not, I
have a short one in mind, which I will tell you, if you wish."All assented joyfully, and Miss Mary, without more delay, related the
story of


THE THREE REMARKS.There was once a princess, the most beautiful princess that ever was
seen.Her hair was black and soft as the raven's wing [here the Crow
blinked, stood on one leg and plumed himself, evidently highly
flattered by the allusion]; her eyes were like stars dropped in a pool
of clear water, and her speech like the first tinkling cascade of the
baby Nile.She was also wise, graceful, and gentle, so that one would
have thought she must be the happiest princess in the world.No one knew whether it was the fault of her
nurse, or a peculiarity born with her; but the sad fact remained, that
no matter what was said to her, she could only reply in one of three
phrases.The first was,--

"What is the price of butter?"The second, "Has your grandmother sold her mangle yet?"And the third, "With all my heart!"You may well imagine what a great misfortune this was to a young and
lively princess.How could she join in the sports and dances of the
noble youths and maidens of the court?She could not always be silent,
neither could she always say, "With all my heart!"though this was her
favorite phrase, and she used it whenever she possibly could; and it was
not at all pleasant, when some gallant knight asked her whether she
would rather play croquet or Aunt Sally, to be obliged to reply, "What
is the price of butter?"On certain occasions, however, the princess actually found her infirmity
of service to her.She could always put an end suddenly to any
conversation that did not please her, by interposing with her first or
second remark; and they were also a very great assistance to her when,
as happened nearly every day, she received an offer of marriage.Emperors, kings, princes, dukes, earls, marquises, viscounts, baronets,
and many other lofty personages knelt at her feet, and offered her their
hands, hearts, and other possessions of greater or less value.But for
all her suitors the princess had but one answer.Fixing her deep radiant
eyes on them, she would reply with thrilling earnestness, "_Has_ your
grandmother sold her mangle yet?"and this always impressed the suitors
so deeply that they retired weeping to a neighboring monastery, where
they hung up their armor in the chapel, and taking the vows, passed the
remainder of their lives mostly in flogging themselves, wearing hair
shirts, and putting dry toast-crumbs in their beds.Now, when the king found that all his best nobles were turning into
monks, he was greatly displeased, and said to the princess:--

"My daughter, it is high time that all this nonsense came to an end.The
next time a respectable person asks you to marry him, you will say,
'With all my heart!'But this the princess could not endure, for she had never yet seen a man
whom she was willing to marry.Nevertheless, she feared her father's
anger, for she knew that he always kept his word; so that very night she
slipped down the back stairs of the palace, opened the back door, and
ran away out into the wide world.She wandered for many days, over mountain and moor, through fen and
through forest, until she came to a fair city.Here all the bells were
ringing, and the people shouting and flinging caps into the air; for
their old king was dead, and they were just about to crown a new one.The new king was a stranger, who had come to the town only the day
before; but as soon as he heard of the old monarch's death, he told the
people that he was a king himself, and as he happened to be without a
kingdom at that moment, he would be quite willing to rule over them.The
people joyfully assented, for the late king had left no heir; and now
all the preparations had been completed.The crown had been polished up,
and a new tip put on the sceptre, as the old king had quite spoiled it
by poking the fire with it for upwards of forty years.When the people saw the beautiful princess, they welcomed her with many
bows, and insisted on leading her before the new king."Who knows but that they may be related?""They both
came from the same direction, and both are strangers."Accordingly the princess was led to the market-place, where the king was
sitting in royal state.He had a fat, red, shining face, and did not
look like the kings whom she had been in the habit of seeing; but
nevertheless the princess made a graceful courtesy, and then waited to
hear what he would say.The new king seemed rather embarrassed when he saw that it was a
princess who appeared before him; but he smiled graciously, and said, in
a smooth oily voice,--

"I trust your 'Ighness is quite well.And 'ow did yer 'Ighness leave yer
pa and ma?"At these words the princess raised her head and looked fixedly at the
red-faced king; then she replied, with scornful distinctness,--

"What is the price of butter?"At these words an alarming change came over the king's face.The red
faded from it, and left it a livid green; his teeth chattered; his eyes
stared, and rolled in their sockets; while the sceptre dropped from his
trembling hand and fell at the princess's feet.For the truth was, this
was no king at all, but a retired butterman, who had laid by a little
money at his trade, and had thought of setting up a public house; but
chancing to pass through this city at the very time when they were
looking for a king, it struck him that he might just as well fill the
vacant place as any one else.No one had thought of his being an
impostor; but when the princess fixed her clear eyes on him and asked
him that familiar question, which he had been in the habit of hearing
many times a day for a great part of his life, the guilty butterman
thought himself detected, and shook in his guilty shoes.Hastily
descending from his throne, he beckoned he princess into a side-chamber,
and closing the door, besought her in moving terms not to betray him."Here," he said, "is a bag of rubies as big as pigeon's eggs.There are
six thousand of them, and I 'umbly beg your 'Ighness to haccept them as
a slight token hof my hesteem, if your 'Ighness will kindly consent to
spare a respeckable tradesman the disgrace of being hexposed."The princess reflected, and came to the conclusion that, after all, a
butterman might make as good a king as any one else; so she took the
rubies with a gracious little nod, and departed, while all the people
shouted, "Hooray!"and followed her, waving their hats and kerchiefs, to
the gates of the city.With her bag of rubies over her shoulder, the fair princess now pursued
her journey, and fared forward over heath and hill, through brake and
through brier.After several days she came to a deep forest, which she
entered without hesitation, for she knew no fear.She had not gone a
hundred paces under the arching limes, when she was met by a band of
robbers, who stopped her and asked what she did in their forest, and
what she carried in her bag.They were fierce, black-bearded men, armed
to the teeth with daggers, cutlasses, pistols, dirks, hangers,
blunderbusses, and other defensive weapons; but the princess gazed
calmly on them, and said haughtily,--

"Has your grandmother sold her mangle yet?"and here he and the whole band assumed attitudes of supplication.--PAGE
195.]The robbers started back in dismay, crying, "The
countersign!"Then they hastily lowered their weapons, and assuming
attitudes of abject humility, besought the princess graciously to
accompany them to their master's presence.With a lofty gesture she
signified assent, and the cringing, trembling bandits led her on through
the forest till they reached an open glade, into which the sunbeams
glanced right merrily.Here, under a broad oak-tree which stood in the
centre of the glade, reclined a man of gigantic stature and commanding
mien, with a whole armory of weapons displayed upon his person.Hastening to their chief, the robbers conveyed to him, in agitated
whispers, the circumstance of their meeting the princess, and of her
unexpected reply to their questions.Hardly seeming to credit their
statement, the gigantic chieftain sprang to his feet, and advancing
toward the princess with a respectful reverence, begged her to repeat
the remark which had so disturbed his men.With a royal air, and in
clear and ringing tones, the princess repeated,--

"_Has_ your grandmother sold her mangle yet?"and gazed steadfastly at
the robber chief.He turned deadly pale, and staggered against a tree, which alone
prevented him from falling.The enemy is without doubt
close at hand, and all is over.Yet," he added with more firmness, and
with an appealing glance at the princess, "yet there may be one chance
left for us.If this gracious lady will consent to go forward, instead
of returning through the wood, we may yet escape with our lives.and here he and the whole band assumed attitudes of
supplication, "consider, I pray you, whether it would really add to your
happiness to betray to the advancing army a few poor foresters, who earn
their bread by the sweat of their brow.Here," he continued, hastily
drawing something from a hole in the oak-tree, "is a bag containing ten
thousand sapphires, each as large as a pullet's egg.If you will
graciously deign to accept them, and to pursue your journey in the
direction I shall indicate, the Red Chief of the Rustywhanger will be
your slave forever."The princess, who of course knew that there was no army in the
neighborhood, and who moreover did not in the least care which way she
went, assented to the Red Chief's proposition, and taking the bag of
sapphires, bowed her farewell to the grateful robbers, and followed
their leader down a ferny path which led to the farther end of the
forest.When they came to the open country, the robber chieftain took
his leave of the princess, with profound bows and many protestations of
devotion, and returned to his band, who were already preparing to plunge
into the impenetrable thickets of the midforest.The princess, meantime, with her two bags of gems on her shoulders,
fared forward with a light heart, by dale and by down, through moss and
through meadow.By-and-by she came to a fair high palace, built all of
marble and shining jasper, with smooth lawns about it, and sunny gardens
of roses and gillyflowers, from which the air blew so sweet that it was
a pleasure to breathe it.The princess stood still for a moment, to
taste the sweetness of this air, and to look her fill at so fair a spot;
and as she stood there, it chanced that the palace-gates opened, and the
young king rode out with his court, to go a-catching of nighthawks.Now when the king saw a right fair princess standing alone at his
palace-gate, her rich garments dusty and travel-stained, and two heavy
sacks hung upon her shoulders, he was filled with amazement; and leaping
from his steed, like the gallant knight that he was, he besought her to
tell him whence she came and whither she was going, and in what way he
might be of service to her.But the princess looked down at her little dusty shoes, and answered
never a word; for she had seen at the first glance how fair and goodly a
king this was, and she would not ask him the price of butter, nor
whether his grandmother had sold her mangle yet.But she thought in her
heart, "Now, I have never, in all my life, seen a man to whom I would so
willingly say, 'With all my heart!'The king marvelled much at her silence, and presently repeated his
questions, adding, "And what do you carry so carefully in those two
sacks, which seem over-heavy for your delicate shoulders?"Still holding her eyes downcast, the princess took a ruby from one bag,
and a sapphire from the other, and in silence handed them to the king,
for she willed that he should know she was no beggar, even though her
shoes were dusty.Thereat all the nobles were filled with amazement, for
no such gems had ever been seen in that country.But the king looked steadfastly at the princess, and said, "Rubies are
fine, and sapphires are fair; but, maiden, if I could but see those
eyes of yours, I warrant that the gems would look pale and dull beside
them."At that the princess raised her clear dark eyes, and looked at the king
and smiled; and the glance of her eyes pierced straight to his heart, so
that he fell on his knees and cried:

"Ah!sweet princess, now do I know that thou art the love for whom I
have waited so long, and whom I have sought through so many lands.Give
me thy white hand, and tell me, either by word or by sign, that thou
wilt be my queen and my bride!"And the princess, like a right royal maiden as she was, looked him
straight in the eyes, and giving him her little white hand, answered
bravely, "_With all my heart!_"




CHAPTER XII.NOW, if we had looked into the hermit's cave a few days after this, we
should have seen a very pleasant sight.The good old man was sitting up
on his narrow couch, with his lame leg on a stool before him.On another
stool sat our worthy friend Bruin, with a backgammon-board on his knees,
and the two were deep in the mysteries of Russian backgammon."Dear, dear, what luck you do have!""Yes," said the hermit, "this finishes the game and the rubber.But just
remember, my friend, how you beat me yesterday.I was gammoned over and
over again, with never a doublet to save me from ruin."yesterday was one
of my good days.And so to-day you have gammoned me back again.I
suppose that is why the game is called back-gammon, hey?""And how have you been in the habit of playing?""You spoke of playing last winter, you know.Whom did you play with, for
example?""With myself," said the hermit,--"the right hand against the left.I
taught my crow the game once, but it didn't work very well.He could not
lift the dice-box, and could only throw the dice by running against the
box, and upsetting it.This was apt to disarrange the pieces, you see;
and as he would not trust me to throw for him, we gave it up.""And what else did you do in the way
of amusement?""I read, chiefly," replied the old man."You see I have a good many
books, and they are all good ones, which will bear reading many times.""That is _one_ thing about you people that I
cannot understand,--the reading of books.Seems so senseless, you know,
when you can use your eyes for other things.But, tell me," he added,
"have you never thought of trying our way of passing the winter?It is
certainly much the best way, when one is alone.Choose a comfortable
place, like this, for example, curl yourself up in the warmest corner,
and there you are, with nothing to do but to sleep till spring comes
again.""I am afraid I could not do that," said the hermit with a smile."We are
made differently, you see.I cannot sleep more than a few hours at a
time, at any season of the year.""That makes
all the difference, you know.Have you ever _tried_ sucking your paw?"The hermit was forced to admit that he never had.well, you really must try it some day," said Bruin."There is
nothing like it, after all.I will confess to you," he
added in a low tone, and looking cautiously about to make sure that they
were alone, "that I have missed it sadly this winter.In most respects
this has been the happiest season of my life, and I have enjoyed it more
than I can tell you; but still there are times,--when I am tired, you
know, or the weather is dull, or <DW53> is a little trying, as he is
sometimes,--times when I feel as if I would give a great deal for a
quiet corner where I could suck my paw and sleep for a week or two.""Couldn't you manage it, somehow?"asked the hermit, sympathetically."<DW53> thinks the Madam
would not like it.He is very genteel, you know,--very genteel indeed,
<DW53> is; and he says it wouldn't be at all 'the thing' for me to suck
my paw anywhere about the place.I never know just what 'thing' he means
when he says that, but it's a favorite expression of his; and he
certainly knows a great deal about good manners.Besides," he added,
more cheerfully, "there is always plenty of work to do, and that is the
best thing to keep one awake.Baldhead, it is time for your
dinner, sir; and here am I sitting and talking, when I ought to be
warming your broth!"With these words the excellent bear arose, put away the backgammon
board, and proceeded to build up the fire, hang the kettle, and put the
broth on to warm, all as deftly as if he had been a cook all his life.He stirred and tasted, shook his head, tasted again, and then said,--

"You haven't the top of a young pine-tree anywhere about the house, I
suppose?It would give this broth such a nice flavor.""I don't generally keep a
large stock of such things on hand.But I fancy the broth will be very
good without it, to judge from the last I had.""Do you ever put frogs in your
broth?""Whole ones, you know, rolled in a batter,
just like dumplings?""_No!_" said the hermit, quickly and decidedly."I am quite sure I
should not like them, thank you,--though it was very kind of you to make
the suggestion!"he added, seeing that Bruin looked disappointed."You have no idea how nice they are," said the good bear, rather sadly."But you are so strange, you people!I never could induce Toto or Madam
to try them, either.I invented the soup myself,--at least the
frog-dumpling part of it,--and made it one day as a little surprise for
them.But when I told them what the dumplings were, Toto choked and
rolled on the floor, and Madam was quite ill at the very thought, though
she had not begun to eat her soup.So <DW53> and Cracker and I had it all
to ourselves, and uncommonly good it was.It's a pity for people to be
so prejudiced."The good hermit was choking a little himself, for some reason or other,
but he looked very grave when Bruin turned toward him for assent, and
said, "Quite so!"The broth being now ready, the bear proceeded to arrange a tray neatly,
and set it before his patient, who took up his wooden spoon and fell to
with right good-will.The good bear stood watching him with great
satisfaction; and it was really a pity that there was no one there to
watch the bear himself, for as he stood there with a clean cloth over
his arm, his head on one side, and his honest face beaming with pride
and pleasure, he was very well worth looking at.At this moment a sharp cry of terror was heard outside, then a quick
whirr of wings, and the next moment the wood-pigeon darted into the
cave, closely pursued by a large hawk.She was quite
exhausted, and with one more piteous cry she fell fainting at Bruin's
feet.In another instant the hawk would have pounced upon her, but that
instant never came for the winged marauder.Instead, something or
somebody pounced on _him_.A thick white covering enveloped him,
entangling his claws, binding down his wings, well-nigh stifling him.He
felt himself seized in an iron grasp and lifted bodily into the air,
while a deep, stern voice exclaimed,--

"Now, sir!have you anything to say for yourself, before I wring your
neck?"Then the covering was drawn back from his head, and he found himself
face to face with the great bear, whom he knew perfectly well by sight.But he was a bold fellow, too well used to danger to shrink from it,
even in so terrible a form as this; and his fierce yellow eyes met the
stern gaze of his captor without shrinking.repeated the bear, "before I wring your ugly
neck?"replied the hawk, sullenly, "wring away."This answer rather disconcerted our friend Bruin, who, as he sometimes
said sadly to himself, had "lost all taste for killing;" so he only
shook Master Hawk a little, and said,--

"Do you know of any reason why your neck should _not_ be wrung?"Are you
afraid, you great clumsy monster?""I'll soon show you whether I am afraid or not!""If _you_ had had
nothing to eat for a week, you'd have eaten her long before this, I'll
be bound!"Here Bruin began to rub his nose with his disengaged paw, and to look
helplessly about him, as he always did when disturbed in mind.he exclaimed, "you hawk, what do you mean by that?"It _is_ rather short," said Bruin; "but--yes!why, of course, _any one_
can dig, if he wants to.""Ask that old thing," said the hawk, nodding toward the hermit, "whether
_he_ ever dug with his beak; and it's twice as long as mine."replied Bruin, promptly; but then he faltered, for
it suddenly occurred to him that he had never seen either Toto or the
Madam dig with their noses; and it was with some hesitation that he
asked:

"Mr.but--a--have you ever tried digging for roots
in the ground--with your beak--I mean, nose?"The hermit looked up gravely, as he sat with Pigeon Pretty on his knee."No, my friend," he said with great seriousness, "I have never tried
it, and doubt if I could do it.I can dig with my hands, though," he
added, seeing the good bear look more and more puzzled."But you see this bird has no hands, though he
has very ugly claws; so that doesn't help-- Well!"he cried, breaking
off short, and once more addressing the hawk."I don't see anything for
it _but_ to wring your neck, do you?After all, it will keep you from
being hungry again."But here the soft voice of the wood-pigeon interposed.Bruin,
dear," cried the gentle bird."Give him something to eat, and let him
go.If he had eaten nothing for a week, I am sure he was not to blame
for pursuing the first eatable creature he saw.Remember," she added in
a lower tone, which only the bear could hear, "that before this winter,
any of us would have done the same."Bruin scratched his head helplessly; the hawk turned his yellow eyes on
Pigeon Pretty with a strange look, but said nothing.But now the hermit
saw that it was time for him to interfere."Pigeon Pretty," he said, "you are right, as usual.Bruin, my friend,
bring your prisoner here, and let him finish this excellent broth, into
which I have crumbled some bread.I will answer for Master Hawk's good
behavior, for the present at least," he added, "for I know that he comes
of an old and honorable family."In five minutes the hawk was sitting quietly on the
hermit's knee, sipping broth, pursuing the floating bits of bread in the
bowl, and submitting to have his soft black plumage stroked, with the
best grace in the world.On the good man's other knee sat Pigeon Pretty,
now quite recovered from her fright and fatigue, her soft eyes beaming
with pleasure; while Bruin squatted opposite them, looking from one to
the other, and assuring himself over and over again that Pigeon Pretty
was "a most astonishing bird!'pon my word, a _most_ astonishing bird!"His meal ended, the stranger wiped his beak politely on his feathers,
plumed himself, and thanked his hosts for their hospitality, with a
stately courtesy which contrasted strangely with his former sullen and
ferocious bearing.The fierce glare was gone from his eyes, which were,
however, still strangely bright; and with his glossy plumage smooth, and
his head held proudly erect, he really was a noble-looking bird."Long is it, indeed," he said, "since any one has spoken a kind word to
Ger-Falcon.It will not be forgotten, I assure you.We are a wild and
lawless family,--our beak against every one, and every one's claw
against us,--and yet, as you observed, Sir Baldhead, we are an old and
honorable race.for the brave, brave days of old, when my sires
were the honored companions of kings and princes!My grandfather seventy
times removed was served by an emperor, the obsequious monarch carrying
him every day on his own wrist to the hunting.He ate from a golden
dish, and wore a collar of gems about his neck.what would be
the feelings of that noble ancestor if he could see his descendant a
hunted outlaw, persecuted by the sons of those very men who once courted
and caressed him, and supporting a precarious existence by the ignoble
spoils of barn-yards and hen-roosts!"The hawk paused, overcome by these recollections of past glory, and the
good bear said kindly,--

"Dear!And how did this melancholy change come
about, pray?"replied the hawk, "ignoble fashion!The race of
men degenerated, and occupied themselves with less lofty sports than
hawking.My family, left to themselves, knew not what to do.They had
been trained to pursue, to overtake, to slay, through long generations;
they were unfitted for anything else.But when they began to lead this
life on their own account, man, always ungrateful, turned upon them, and
persecuted them for the very deeds which had once been the delight and
pride of his fickle race.So we fell from our high estate, lower and
lower, till the present representative of the Ger-Falcon is the poor
creature you behold before you."The hawk bowed in proud humility, and his hearers all felt, perhaps,
much more sorry for him than he deserved.The wood-pigeon was about to
ask something more about his famous ancestors, when a shadow darkened
the mouth of the cave, and Toto made his appearance, with the crow
perched on his shoulder.he cried in his fresh, cheery voice, "how are you
to-day, sir?And catching sight of the stranger, he stopped short, and looked at the
bear for an explanation.Ger-Falcon, Toto," said Bruin.Toto nodded, and the hawk made him a stately bow; but the two
looked distrustfully at each other, and neither seemed inclined to make
any advances.Bruin continued,--

"Mr.Falcon came here in a--well, not in a friendly way at all, I must
say.But he is in a very different frame of mind, now, and I trust there
will be no further trouble.""Do you ever change your name, sir?"asked Toto, abruptly, addressing
the hawk."I have
no reason to be ashamed of my name.""And yet I am tolerably sure that Mr.Ger-Falcon is no other than Mr.Chicken Hawkon, and that it was he who
tried to carry off my Black Spanish chickens yesterday morning."I was
starving, and the chickens presented themselves to me wholly in the
light of food.May I ask for what purpose you keep chickens, sir?""Why, we eat them when they grow up," said Toto; "but--"

"Ah, precisely!""But we don't steal other people's chickens," said the boy, "we eat our
own.""You eat the tame, confiding
creatures who feed from your hand, and stretch their necks trustfully to
meet their doom.I, on the contrary, when the pangs of hunger force me
to snatch a morsel of food to save me from starvation, snatch it from
strangers, not from my friends."Toto was about to make a hasty reply, but the bear, with a motion of his
paw, checked him, and said gravely to the hawk,--

"Come, come!Falcon, I cannot have any dispute of this kind.There
is some truth in what you say, and I have no doubt that emperors and
other disreputable people have had a large share in forming the bad
habits into which you and all your family have fallen.But those habits
must be changed, sir, if you intend to remain in this forest.You must
not meddle with Toto's chickens; you must not chase quiet and harmless
birds.You must, in short, become a respectable and law-abiding bird,
instead of a robber and a murderer.""But how am I to live, pray?I
can be'respectable,' as you call it, in summer; but in weather like
this--"

"That can be easily managed," said the kind hermit."You can stay with
me, Falcon.I shall soon be able to shift for myself, and I will gladly
undertake to feed you until the snow and frost are gone.You will be a
companion for my crow-- By the way, where is my crow?Surely he came in
with you, Toto?""He did," said Toto, "but he hopped off the moment we entered.Didn't
like the looks of the visitor, I fancy," he added in a low tone.Search was made, and finally the crow was discovered huddled together, a
disconsolate little bunch of black feathers, in the darkest corner of
the cave.cried Toto, who was the first to catch sight of him.Why are you rumpling and humping yourself up in that
absurd fashion?"asked the crow, opening one eye a very little way, and
lifting his head a fraction of an inch from the mass of feathers in
which it was buried."Good Toto, kind Toto, is he gone?I would not be
eaten to-day, Toto, if it could be avoided."If you mean the hawk," said Toto, "he is _not_ gone; and what is more,
he isn't going, for your master has asked him to stay the rest of the
winter.Bruin has bound him
over to keep the peace, and you must come out and make the best of it."The unhappy crow begged and protested, but all in vain.Toto caught him
up, laughing, and carried him to his master, who set him on his knee,
and smoothed his rumpled plumage kindly.The hawk, who was highly
gratified by the hermit's invitation, put on his most gracious manner,
and soon convinced the crow that he meant him no harm."A member of the ancient family of Corvus!""Contemporaries, and probably friends, of the early Falcons.Let us also
be friends, dear sir; and let the names of James Crow and Ger-Falcon go
down together to posterity."But now Bruin and Pigeon Pretty were eager to hear all the home news
from the cottage.They listened with breathless interest to Toto's
account of the attempted robbery, and of <DW53>'s noble "defence of the
castle," as the boy called it.Miss Mary also received her full share of
the credit, nor was the kettle excluded from honorable mention.When all
was told, Toto proceeded to unpack the basket he had brought, which
contained gingerbread, eggs, apples, and a large can of butter-milk
marked "For Bruin."Many were the joyous exclamations called forth by
this present of good cheer; and it seemed as if the old hermit could not
sufficiently express his gratitude to Toto and his good grandmother.cried the boy, half distressed by the oft-repeated thanks."If you only knew how we _like_ it!Besides,"
he added, "I want you to do something for _me_ now, Mr.Baldhead, so
that will turn the tables.A shower is coming up, and it is early yet,
so I need not go home for an hour.So, will you not tell us a story?We
are very fond of stories,--Bruin and Pigeon Pretty and I.""With all my heart, dear
lad!"I have not heard a fairy story
for a long time."said the hermit, after a moment's reflection."When I was a
boy like you, Toto, I lived in Ireland, the very home of the fairy-folk;
so I know more about them than most people, perhaps, and this is an
Irish fairy story that I am going to tell you."And settling himself comfortably on his moss-pillows, the hermit began
the story of--




CHAPTER XIII."'It's Green Men, it's Green Men,
        All in the wood together;
      And, oh!we're feared o' the Green Men
        In all the sweet May weather,'--


"ON'Y I'm _not_ feared o' thim mesilf!"said Eileen, breaking off her
song with a little merry laugh."Wouldn't I be plazed to meet wan o'
thim this day, in the wud!Sure, it 'ud be the lookiest day o' me
loife."She parted the boughs, and entered the deep wood, where she was to
gather <DW19>s for her mother.Holding up her blue apron carefully, the
little girl stepped lightly here and there, picking up the dry brown
sticks, and talking to herself all the while,--to keep herself company,
as she thought."Thin I makes a low curchy," she was saying, "loike that wan Mother made
to the lord's lady yistherday, and the Green Man he gi'es me a nod,
and--

"'What's yer name, me dear?'"'Eileen Macarthy, yer Honor's Riverence!'I mustn't say
'Riverence,' bekase he's not a priest, ava'.'Yer Honor's Grace' wud do
better."'And what wud ye loike for a prisint, Eily?'"And thin I'd say--lit me see!A big green grasshopper, caught be his leg
in a spider's wib.Wait a bit, poor crathur, oi'll lit ye free agin."Full of pity for the poor grasshopper, Eily stooped to lift it carefully
out of the treacherous net into which it had fallen.But what was her
amazement on perceiving that the creature was not a grasshopper, but a
tiny man, clad from head to foot in light green, and with a scarlet cap
on his head.The little fellow was hopelessly entangled in the net, from
which he made desperate efforts to free himself, but the silken strands
were quite strong enough to hold him prisoner.For a moment Eileen stood petrified with amazement, murmuring to
herself, "Howly Saint Bridget!Sure, I niver
thought I'd find wan really in loife!"but the next moment her kindness
of heart triumphed over her fear, and stooping once more she very gently
took the little man up between her thumb and finger, pulled away the
clinging web, and set him respectfully on the top of a large toadstool
which stood conveniently near.The little Green Man shook himself, dusted his jacket with his red cap,
and then looked up at Eileen with twinkling eyes."Ye have saved my life, and ye
shall not be the worse for it, if ye _did_ take me for a grasshopper."Eily was rather abashed at this, but the little man looked very kind; so
she plucked up her courage, and when he asked, "What is yer name, my
dear?"("jist for all the wurrld the way I thought of," she said to
herself) answered bravely, with a low courtesy, "Eileen Macarthy, yer
Honor's Riverence--Grace, I mane!"and then she added, "They calls me
Eily, most times, at home.""Well, Eily," said the Green Man, "I suppose ye know who I am?""A fairy, plaze yer Honor's Grace!""Sure, I've aften heerd av yer Honor's people, but I niver thought I'd
see wan of yez.It's rale plazed I am, sure enough.Manny's the time
Docthor O'Shaughnessy's tell't me there was no sich thing as yez; but I
niver belaved him, yer Honor!"said the Green Man, heartily, "that's very right.And now, Eily, alanna, I'm going to do ye a
fairy's turn before I go.Ye shall have yer wish of whatever ye like in
the world.Take a minute to think about it, and then make up yer mind."Her dreams had then come true; she was to
have a fairy wish!Eily had all the old fairy-stories at her tongue's end, for her
mother told her one every night as she sat at her spinning.Jack and the
Beanstalk, the Sleeping Beauty, the Seven Swans, the Elves that stole
Barney Maguire, the Brown Witch, and the Widdy Malone's Pig,--she knew
them all, and scores of others besides.Her mother always began the
stories with, "Wanst upon a time, and a very good time it was;" or,
"Long, long ago, whin King O'Toole was young, and the praties grew all
ready biled in the ground;" or, "Wan fine time, whin the fairies danced,
and not a poor man lived in Ireland."In this way, the fairies seemed
always to be thrown far back into a remote past, which had nothing in
common with the real work-a-day world in which Eily lived.But now--oh,
wonder of wonders!--now, here was a real fairy, alive and active, with
as full power of blessing or banning as if the days of King O'Toole had
come again,--and what was more, with good-will to grant to Eileen
Macarthy whatever in the wide world she might wish for!The child stood
quite still, with her hands clasped, thinking harder than she had ever
thought in all her life before; and the Green Man sat on the toadstool
and watched her, with eyes which twinkled with some amusement, but no
malice."Take yer time, my dear," he said, "take yer time!Ye'll not meet a
Green Man every day, so make the best o' your chance!"Suddenly Eily's face lighted up with a sudden inspiration.she
cried, "sure I have it, yer Riverence's Grace--Honor, I shud say!it's the di'monds and pearrls I'll have, iv ye plaze!"repeated the fairy, "what diamonds and pearls?You don't want them _all_, surely?""Och, no, yer Honor!""Only wan of aich to dhrop out o' me
mouth ivery time I shpake, loike the girrl in the sthory, ye know.Whiniver she opened her lips to shpake, a di'mond an' a pearrl o' the
richest beauty dhropped from her mouth.That's what I mane, plaze yer
Honor's Grace.wudn't it be beautiful, entirely?""Are ye _quite_ sure that
this is what you wish for most, Eileen?Don't decide hastily, or ye may
be sorry for it."cried Eileen, "what for wud I be sorry?Sure I'd be richer than
the Countess o' Kilmoggen hersilf, let alone the Queen, be the time I'd
talked for an hour.An' I _loove_ to talk!"she added softly, half to
herself."Well, Eily," he said, "ye shall
have yer own way.Eileen bent down, and he touched her lips three times with the scarlet
tassel of his cap.Now go home, Eileen Macarthy, and the good wishes of the Green Men go
with ye.Ye will have yer own wish fulfilled as soon as ye cross the
threshold of yer home."A day
may come when ye will wish with all yer heart to have the charm taken
away.If that ever happens, come to this same place with a sprig of
holly in yer hand.Strike this toadstool three times, and say,
'Slanegher Banegher, Skeen na Lane!'and
clapping his scarlet cap on his head, the little man leaped from the
toadstool, and instantly disappeared from sight among the ferns and
mosses.Eileen stood still for some time, lost in a dream of wonder and delight.Finally rousing herself, she gave a long, happy sigh, and hastily
filling her apron with sticks, turned her steps homeward.The sun was sinking low when she came in sight of the little cabin, at
the door of which her mother was standing, looking anxiously in every
direction."Is it yersilf, Eily?"cried the good woman in a tone of relief, as she
saw the child approaching.It's a wild
colleen y'are, to be sprankin' about o' this way, and it nearly sundown.Where have ye been, I'm askin' ye?"Eily held up her apronful of sticks with a beaming smile, but answered
never a word till she stood on the threshold of the cottage.("Sure I
might lose some," she had been saying to herself, "and that 'ud niver
do.")But as soon as she had entered the little room which was kitchen,
hall, dining-room, and drawing-room for the Macarthy family, she dropped
her bundle of <DW19>s, and clasping her hands together, cried, "Och,
mother!Sure ye'll niver belave me whin I till ye--"

Here she suddenly stopped, for hop!two round shining things
dropped from her mouth, and rolled away over the floor of the cabin.[marbles]" shouted little Phelim, jumping up from his
seat by the fire and running to pick up the shining objects."Eily's
got her mouf full o' marvels!"Wait till I till ye,
mother asthore!I wint to the forest as ye bade me, to gather shticks,
an'--" hop!out flew two more shining things from her mouth and
rolled away after the others.Macarthy uttered a piercing shriek, and clapped her hand over
Eileen's mouth."Me choild's bewitched,
an' shpakin' buttons!Run,
Phelim," she added, "an' call yer father.He's in the praty-patch,
loikely.she said to Eily, who was struggling
vainly to free herself from her mother's powerful grasp."Kape shtill,
I'm tillin' ye, an' don't open yer lips!It's savin' yer body an' sowl I
may be this minute.Saint Bridget, Saint Michael, an' blissid Saint
Patrick!"she ejaculated piously, "save me choild, an' I'll serve ye on
me knees the rist o' me days."This was a sad beginning of all her glory.She tried
desperately to open her mouth, sure that in a moment she could make her
mother understand the whole matter.But Honor Macarthy was a stalwart
woman, and Eily's slender fingers could not stir the massive hand which
was pressed firmly upon her lips.At this moment her father entered hastily, with Phelim panting behind
him."Phwhat's the matther, woman?""Here's Phelim clane
out o' his head, an' shcramin' about Eily, an' marvels an' buttons, an'
I dunno what all.he added in a tone of great
alarm, as he saw Eileen in her mother's arms, flushed and disordered,
the tears rolling down her cheeks.cried Honor, "it's bewitched she is,--clane bewitched out
o' her sinses, an shpakes buttons out av her mouth wid ivery worrd she
siz.Who wud do ye sich an
ill turn as this, whin ye niver harmed annybody since the day ye were
born?""_Buttons!_" said Dennis Macarthy; "what do ye mane by buttons?How can
she shpake buttons, I'm askin' ye?Sure, ye're foolish yersilf, Honor,
woman!Lit the colleen go, an' she'll till me phwhat 'tis all about.""Och, av ye don't belave me!""Show thim to yer father,
Phelim!Look at two av thim there in the corner,--the dirrty things!"Phelim took up the two shining objects cautiously in the corner of his
pinafore and carried them to his father, who examined them long and
carefully.Finally he spoke, but in an altered voice."Lit the choild go, Honor," he said."I want to shpake till her.he added sternly; and very reluctantly his wife released poor
Eily, who stood pale and trembling, eager to explain, and yet afraid to
speak for fear of being again forcibly silenced."Eileen," said her father, "'tis plain to be seen that these things are
not buttons, but jew'ls."said Dennis; "jew'ls, or gims, whichiver ye plaze to call thim.Now, phwhat I want to know is, where did ye get thim?"cried Eily; "don't look at me that a-way!Sure, I've done
no harrum!another splendid diamond and another
white, glistening pearl fell from her lips; but she hurried on, speaking
as quickly as she could: "I wint to the forest to gather shticks, and
there I saw a little Grane Man, all the same loike a hoppergrass, caught
be his lig in a spidher's wib; and whin I lit him free he gi' me a wish,
to have whativer I loiked bist in the wurrld; an' so I wished, an' I
sid--" but by this time the pearls and diamonds were hopping like
hail-stones all over the cabin-floor; and with a look of deep anger and
sorrow Dennis Macarthy motioned to his wife to close Eileen's mouth
again, which she eagerly did."To think," he said, "as iver a child o' mine shud shtale the Countess's
jew'ls, an' thin till me a pack o' lies about thim!Honor, thim is the
beads o' the Countess's nickluss that I was tillin' ye about, that I saw
on her nick at the ball, whin I carried the washin' oop to the Castle.An' this misfortunate colleen has shwallied 'em.""How wud she shwally 'em,
an' have 'em in her mouth all the toime?An' how wud she get thim to
shwally, an' the Countess in Dublin these three weeks, an' her jew'ls
wid her?Shame an ye, Dinnis Macarthy!to suspict yer poor, diminted
choild of shtalin'!It's bewitched she is, I till ye!Look at the face
av her this minute!"Just at that moment the sound of wheels was heard; and Phelim, who was
standing at the open door, exclaimed,--

"Father!here's Docthor O'Shaughnessy dhrivin' past.cried both mother and father in a
breath.Phelim darted out, and soon returned, followed by the doctor,--a tall,
thin man with a great hooked nose, on which was perched a pair of green
spectacles.O'Shaughnessy; and now a cold shiver passed
over her as he fixed his spectacled eyes on her and listened in silence
to the confused accounts which her father and mother poured into his
ear.Let me see the jew'ls, as ye call thim."The pearls and diamonds were brought,--a whole handful of them,--and
poured into the doctor's hand, which closed suddenly over them, while
his dull black eyes shot out a quick gleam under the shading spectacles.The next moment, however, he laughed good-humoredly and turned them
carelessly over one by one."Why, Dinnis," he said, "'tis aisy to see that ye've not had mich
expeerunce o' jew'ls, me bye, or ye'd not mistake these bits o' glass
an' sich fer thim.there's no jew'ls here, wheriver the
Countess's are.An' these bits o' trash dhrop out o' the choild's mouth,
ye till me, ivery toime she shpakes?""Ivery toime, yer Anner!""Out they dhrops, an' goes hoppin'
an' leppin' about the room, loike they were aloive."This is a very sirrious case,
Misther Macarthy,--a very sirrious case _in_dade, sirr; an' I'll be free
to till ye that I know but _wan_ way av curin' it.""Och, whirrasthru!""What is it at all, Docthor
alanna?Is it a witch has overlooked her, or what is it?will I lose ye this-a-way?and in her grief she loosed her hold of Eileen and clapped her hands to
her own face, sobbing aloud.But before the child could open her lips to
speak, she found herself seized in another and no less powerful grasp,
while another hand covered her mouth,--not warm and firm like her
mother's, but cold, bony, and frog-like.Holding her as in a vice, Dr.O'Shaughnessy spoke once more to her parents."I'll save her loife," said he, "and mebbe her wits as well, av the
thing's poassible.But it's not here I can do ut at all.I'll take the
choild home wid me to me house, and Misthress O'Shaughnessy will tind
her as if she wuz her own; and thin I will try th' ixpirimint which is
the ownly thing on airth can save her.""Sure, there's two, three kinds o' mint growin'
here in oor own door-yard, but I dunno av there's anny o' that kind.Will ye make a tay av it, Docthor, or is it a poultuss ye'll be puttin'
an her, to dhraw out the witchcraft, loike?""Whisht, whisht, woman!""Howld yer prate,
can't ye, an' the docthor waitin'?Is there no way ye cud cure her, an'
lave her at home thin, Docthor?Faith, I'd be loth to lave her go away
from uz loike this, let alone the throuble she'll be to yez!""At laste," he added
more gravely, "naw moor thin I'd gladly take for ye an' yer good woman,
Dinnis!Come, help me wid the colleen, now.Now, thin, oop
wid ye, Eily!"And the next moment Eileen found herself in the doctor's narrow gig,
wedged tightly between him and the side of the vehicle."Ye can sind her bits o' clothes over by Phelim," said Dr.O'Shaughnessy, as he gathered up the reins, apparently in great haste.Good-day t' ye, Dinnis!My respicts to ye,
Misthress Macarthy.Ye'll hear av the choild in a day or two!"And
whistling to his old pony, they started off at as brisk a trot as the
latter could produce on such short notice.Was this the result of the fairy's gift?She sat still,
half-paralyzed with grief and terror, for she made no doubt that the
hated doctor was going to do something very, very dreadful to her.Seeing that she made no effort to free herself, or to speak, her captor
removed his hand from her mouth; but not until they were well out of
sight and hearing of her parents."Now, Eileen," he said, not unkindly, "av ye'll be a good colleen, and
not shpake a wurrd, I'll lave yer mouth free.But av ye shpake, so much
as to say, 'Bliss ye!'I'll tie up yer jaw wid me pock'-handkercher, so
as ye can't open ut at all.She had not the slightest desire to say "Bliss
ye!"O'Shaughnessy; nor did she care to fill his rusty old gig,
or to sprinkle the high road, with diamonds and pearls.said the Doctor, "that's a sinsible gyurrl as ye are.See, now, what a foine bit o' sweet-cake Misthress O'Shaughnessy 'ull be
givin' ye, whin we git home."The poor child burst into tears, for the word 'home' made her realize
more fully that she was going every moment farther and farther away from
her own home,--from her kind father, her anxious and loving mother, and
dear little Phelim.What would Phelim do at night, without her shoulder
to curl up on and go to sleep, in the trundle-bed which they had shared
ever since he was a tiny baby?Who would light her father's pipe, and
sing him the little song he always liked to hear while he smoked it
after supper?These, and many other such thoughts, filled Eileen's mind
as she sat weeping silently beside the green-spectacled doctor, who
cared nothing about her crying, so long as she did not try to speak.After a drive of some miles, they reached a tall, dark, gloomy-looking
house, which was not unlike the doctor himself, with its small greenish
window-panes and its gaunt chimneys.Here the pony stopped, and the
doctor, lifting Eileen out of the gig, carried her into the house.O'Shaughnessy came out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron,
and stared in amazement at the burden in her husband's arms.Is she
kilt, or what's the matther?""Open the door o' the best room!""Open it,
woman, I'm tillin' ye!"and entering a large bare room, he set Eileen
down hastily on a stool, and then drew a long breath and wiped his brow."Safe and sound I've got ye now, glory for ut!And ye'll not lave this room until ye've made me _King av Ireland_!"Eileen stared at the man, thinking he had gone mad; for his face was
red, and his eyes, from which he had snatched the green spectacles,
glittered with a strange light.The same idea flashed into his wife's
mind, and she crossed herself devoutly, exclaiming,--

"Howly St.Pathrick, he's clane diminted.he said; "ye'll soon see
av I'm diminted.I till ye I'll be King av Ireland before the month's
oot.Open yer mouth, alanna, and make yer manners
to Misthress O'Shaughnessy."Thus adjured, Eileen dropped a courtesy, and said, timidly, "Good day t'
ye, Ma'm!down dropped a pearl and a diamond, and the doctor, pouncing
on them, held them up in triumph before the eyes of his astonished wife.There's no sich in Queen
Victory's crownd this day.That's a pearrl, an' as big
as a marrowfat pay.The loike of ut's not in Ireland, I till ye.Woman,
there's a fortin' in ivery wurrd this colleen shpakes!And she's goin'
to shpake," he added, grimly, "and to kape an shpakin', till Michael
O'Shaughnessy is rich enough to buy all Ireland,--ay, and England too,
av he'd a mind to!"O'Shaughnessy, utterly bewildered by her
husband's wild talk, and by the sight of the jewels, "what does it all
mane?And won't she die av 'em, av it's
that manny in her stumick?""Whisht wid yer foolery!""Swallied
'em, indade!The gyurrl has met a Grane Man, that's the truth of ut; and
he's gi'n her a wish, and she's got ut,--and now I've got _her_."And he
chuckled, and rubbed his bony hands together, while his eyes twinkled
with greed."Sure, ye always till't me there was no sich thing ava'.""I lied, an' that's all there is to
say about ut.Do ye think I'm obleeged to shpake the thruth ivery day in
the week to an ignor'nt crathur like yersilf?It's worn out I'd be, body
and sowl, at that rate.Now, Eileen Macarthy," he continued, turning to
his unhappy little prisoner, "ye are to do as I till ye, an' no
harrum'll coom to ye, an' maybe good.Ye are to sit in this room and
_talk_; and ye'll kape an talkin' till the room is _full-up_!"No less'll satisfy me, and it's the
laste ye can do for all the throuble I've taken forr ye.Misthress
O'Shaughnessy an' mesilf 'ull take turns sittin' wid ye, so 'at ye'll
have some wan to talk to.Ye'll have plinty to ate an' to dhrink, an'
that's more than manny people have in Ireland this day.With this, the worthy man proceeded to give strict injunctions to his
wife to keep the child talking, and not to leave her alone for an
instant; and finally he departed, shutting the door behind him, and
leaving the captive and her jailer alone together.O'Shaughnessy immediately poured forth a flood of questions, to
which Eileen replied by telling the whole pitiful story from beginning
to end.It was a relief to be able to speak at last, and to rehearse the
whole matter to understanding, if not sympathetic, ears.O'Shaughnessy listened and looked, looked and listened, with open mouth
and staring eyes.With her eyes shut, she would not have believed her
ears; but the double evidence was too much for her.The diamonds and pearls kept on falling, falling, fast and faster.They
filled Eileen's lap, they skipped away over the floor, while the
doctor's wife pursued them with frantic eagerness.Each diamond was
clear and radiant as a drop of dew, each pearl lustrous and perfect; but
they gave no pleasure now to the fairy-gifted child.She could only
think of the task that lay before her,--to FILL this great, empty room;
of the millions and millions, and yet again millions of gems that must
fall from her lips before the floor would be covered even a few inches
deep; of the weeks and months,--perhaps the years,--that must elapse
before she would see her parents and Phelim again.She remembered the
words of the fairy: "A day may come when you will wish with all your
heart to have the charm removed."And then, like a flash, came the
recollection of those other words: "When that day comes, come here to
this spot," and do so and so.In fancy, Eileen was transported again to the pleasant green forest; was
looking at the Green Man as he sat on the toadstool, and begging him to
take away this fatal gift, which had already, in one day, brought her so
much misery.Harshly on her reverie broke in the voice of Mrs.O'Shaughnessy, asking,--

"And has yer father sold his pigs yit?"She started, and came back to the doleful world of reality.But even as
she answered the woman's question, she made in her heart a firm
resolve,--somehow or other, _somehow_, she would escape; she would get
out of this hateful house, away from these greedy, grasping people; she
would manage somehow to find her way to the wood, and then--then for
freedom again!Cheered by her own resolution, she answered the woman
composedly, and went into a detailed account of the birth, rearing, and
selling of the pigs, which so fascinated her auditor that she was
surprised, when the recital was over, to find that it was nearly
supper-time.The doctor now entered, and taking his wife's place, began to ply Eily
with questions, each one artfully calculated to bring forth the longest
possible reply:--

"How is it yer mother is related to the Countess's auld housekeeper,
avick; and why is it, that wid sich grand relations she niver got into
the castle at all?""Phwhat was that I h'ard the other day about the looky bargain yer
father--honest man!--made wid the one-eyed peddler from beyant
Inniskeen?"and--

"Is it thrue that yer mother makes all her butther out av skim-milk just
by making the sign of the cross--God bless it!--over the churn?"Although she did not like the doctor, Eily did, as she had said to the
Green Man, "_loove_ to talk;" so she chattered away, explaining and
disclaiming, while the diamonds and pearls flew like hail-stones from
her lips, and her host and jailer sat watching them with looks of greedy
rapture.Eily paused, fairly out of breath, just as Mrs.O'Shaughnessy entered,
bringing her rather scanty supper.There was quite a pile of jewels in
her lap and about her feet, while a good many had rolled to a distance;
but her heart sank within her as she compared the result of three hours'
steady talking with the end to which the rapacious doctor aspired.She was allowed to eat her supper in peace, but no sooner was it
finished than the questioning began again, and it was not until ten
o'clock had struck that the exhausted child was allowed to lay her head
down on the rude bed which Mrs.O'Shaughnessy had hastily made up for
her.The next day was a weary one for poor Eily.From morning till night she
was obliged to talk incessantly, with only a brief space allowed for her
meals.The doctor and his wife mounted guard by turns, each asking
questions, until to the child's fancy they seemed like nothing but
living interrogation points.All day long, no matter what she was
talking about,--the potato-crop, or the black hen that the fox stole, or
Phelim's measles,--her mind was fixed on one idea, that of escaping from
her prison.If only some fortunate chance would call them both out of
the room at once!There was always a
pair of greedy eyes fixed on her, and on the now hated jewels which
dropped in an endless stream from her lips; always a harsh voice in her
ears, rousing her, if she paused for an instant, by new questions as
stupid as they were long.Once, indeed, the child stopped short, and declared that she could not
and would not talk any more; but she was speedily shown the end of a
birch rod, with the hint that the doctor "would be loth to use the likes
av it on Dinnis Macarthy's choild; but her parints had given him charge
to dhrive out the witchcraft be hook or be crook; and av a birch rod
wasn't first cousin to a crook, what was it at all?"and Eily was forced
to find her powers of speech again.By nightfall of this day the room was ankle-deep in pearls and diamonds.A wonderful sight it was, when the moon looked in at the window, and
shone on the lustrous and glittering heaps which Mrs.O'Shaughnessy
piled up with her broom.The woman was fairly frightened at the sight of
so much treasure, and she crossed herself many times as she lay down on
the mat beside Eileen's truckle-bed, muttering to herself, "Michael
knows bist, I suppose; but sorrow o' me if I can feel as if there was a
blissing an it, ava'!"The third day came, and was already half over, when an urgent summons
came for Doctor O'Shaughnessy.One of his richest patrons had fallen
from his horse and broken his leg, and the doctor must come on the
instant.The doctor grumbled and swore, but there was no help for it; so
he departed, after making his wife vow by all the saints in turn, that
she would not leave Eileen's side for an instant until he returned.When Eily heard the rattle of the gig and the sound of the pony's feet,
and knew that the most formidable of her jailers was actually _gone_,
her heart beat so loud for joy that she feared its throbbing would be
heard.Now, at last, a loop-hole seemed to open for her.She had a plan
already in her head, and now there was a chance for her to carry it out.But an Irish girl of ten has shrewdness beyond her years, and no gleam
of expression appeared in Eileen's face as she spoke to Mrs.O'Shaughnessy, who had been standing by the window to watch her
husband's departure, and who now returned to her seat."We'll be missin' the docthor this day, ma'm, won't we?""He's
so agrayable, ain't he, now?"O'Shaughnessy, with something of a sigh."He's rale agrayable, Michael is--whin he wants to be," she added."Yis,
I'll miss um more nor common to-day, for 'tis worn out I am intirely
wid shlapin so little these two nights past.Sure, I _can't_ shlape, wid
thim things a-shparklin' an' a-glowerin' at me the way they do; and now
I'll not get me nap at all this afthernoon, bein' I must shtay here and
kape ye talkin' till the docthor cooms back.Me hid aches, too, mortial
bad!""Arrah, it's too bad, intirely!Will I till ye a little shtory that me grandmother hed for the hidache?""A shtory for the hidache?""What do ye mane by
that, I'm askin' ye?""I dunno roightly how ut is," replied Eily, innocently, "but Granny used
to call this shtory a cure for the hidache, and mebbe ye'd find ut so.An' annyhow it 'ud kape me talkin'," she added meekly, "for 'tis mortial
long."O'Shaughnessy, settling herself more
comfortably in her chair."I loove a long shtory, to be sure.And Eily began as follows, speaking in a clear, low monotone:--

"Wanst upon a toime there lived an owld, owld woman, an' her name was
Moira Magoyle; an' she lived in an owld, owld house, in an owld, owld
lane that lid through an owld, owld wood be the side of an owld, owld
shthrame that flowed through an owld, owld shthrate av an owld, owld
town in an owld, owld county.An' this owld, owld woman, sure enough,
she had an owld, owld cat wid a white nose; an' she had an owld, owld
dog wid a black tail, an' she had an owld, owld hin wid wan eye, an' she
had an owld, owld cock wid wan leg, an' she had--"

Mrs.O'Shaughnessy yawned, and stirred uneasily on her seat."Seems to
me there's moighty little goin' an in this shtory!"she said, taking up
her knitting, which she had dropped in her lap."I'd loike somethin' a
bit more loively, I'm thinkin', av I had me ch'ice."said Eily, with quiet confidence, "ownly wait till I
coom to the parrt about the two robbers an' the keg o' gunpowdther, an'
its loively enough ye'll foind ut.But I must till ut the same way 'at
Granny did, else it 'ull do no good, ava.Well, thin, I was sayin' to
ye, ma'm, this owld woman (Saint Bridget be good to her!)she had an
owld, owld cow, an' she had an owld, owld shape, an' she had an owld,
owld kitchen wid an owld, owld cheer an' an owld, owld table, an' an
owld, owld panthry wid an owld, owld churn, an' an owld, owld sauce-pan,
an' an owld, owld gridiron, an' an owld, owld--"

Mrs.O'Shaughnessy's knitting dropped again, and her head fell forward
on her breast.Eileen's voice grew lower and softer, but still she went
on,--rising at the same time, and moving quietly, stealthily, towards
the door,--

"An' she had an owld, owld kittle, an' she had an owld, owld pot wid an
owld, owld kiver; an' she had an owld, owld jug, an' an owld, owld
platther, an' an owld, owld tay-pot--"

Eily's hand was on the door, her eyes were fixed on the motionless form
of her jailer; her voice went on and on, its soft monotone now
accompanied by another sound,--that of a heavy, regular breathing which
was fast deepening into a snore."An' she had an owld, owld shpoon, an' an owld, owld fork, an' an owld,
owld knife, an' an owld, owld cup, an' an owld, owld bowl, an' an owld,
owld, owld--"

The door is open!Two little feet go speeding down
the long passage, across the empty kitchen, out at the back door, and
away, away!the story is done and the
bird is flown!Surely it was the next thing to flying, the way in which Eily sped
across the meadows, far from the hated scene of her imprisonment.The
bare brown feet seemed scarcely to touch the ground; the brown locks
streamed out on the wind; the little blue apron fluttered wildly, like a
banner of victory.with panting bosom, with parted lips,
with many a backward glance to see if any one were following; on went
the little maid, over field and fell, through moss and through mire,
till at last--oh, happy, blessed sight!--the dark forest rose before
her, and she knew that she was saved.Quite at the other end of the wood lay the spot she was seeking; but she
knew the way well, and on she went, but more carefully now,--parting the
branches so that she broke no living twig, and treading cautiously lest
she should crush the lady fern, which the Green Men love.How beautiful
the ferns were, uncurling their silver-green fronds and spreading their
slender arms abroad!How pleasant,
how kind, how friendly was everything in the sweet green wood!And here at last was the oak-tree, and at the foot of it there stood the
yellow toadstool, looking as if it did not care about anything or
anybody, which in truth it did not: Breathless with haste and eagerness,
Eileen tapped the toadstool three times with a bit of holly, saying
softly, "Slanegher Banegher!there
sat the Green Man, just as if he had been there all the time, fanning
himself with his scarlet cap, and looking at her with a comical twinkle
in his sharp little eyes."Well, Eily," he said, "is it back so soon ye are?Well, well, I'm not
surprised!"Oh, yer Honor's Riverence--Grace, I mane!"cried poor Eily, bursting
into tears, "av ye'll plaze to take it away!Sure it's nearly kilt I am
along av it, an' no plazure or coomfort in ut at all at all!Take it
away, yer Honor, take it away, and I'll bliss ye all me days!"and, with
many sobs, she related the experiences of the past three days.As she
spoke, diamonds and pearls still fell in showers from her lips, and
half-unconsciously she held up her apron to catch them as they fell, so
that by the time she had finished her story she had more than a quart of
splendid gems, each as big as the biggest kind of pea.The Green Man smiled, but not unkindly, at the recital of Eileen's
woes."Faith, it's a hard time ye've had, my maiden, and no mistake!Hold fast the jewels ye have there, for they're the
last ye'll get."He touched her lips with his cap, and said, "Cabbala
ku!Eily drew a long breath of relief, and the fairy added,--

"The truth is, Eily, the times are past for fairy gifts of this kind.Few people believe in the Green Men now at all, and fewer still ever see
them.Why, ye are the first mortal child I've spoken to for a matter of
two hundred years, and I think ye'll be the last I ever speak to.Fairy
gifts are very pretty things in a story, but they're not convenient at
the present time, as ye see for yourself.There's one thing I'd like to
say to ye, however," he added more seriously; "an' ye'll take it as a
little lesson-like, me dear, before we part.Ye asked me for diamonds
and pearls, and I gave them to ye; and now ye've seen the worth of that
kind for yourself.But there's jewels and jewels in the world, and if
ye choose, Eily, ye can still speak pearls and diamonds, and no harm to
yourself or anybody.""Sure, I don't
undershtand yer Honor at all.""Likely not," said the little man, "but it's now I'm telling ye.Every
gentle and loving word ye speak, child, is a pearl; and every kind deed
done to them as needs kindness, is a diamond brighter than all those
shining stones in your apron.Ye'll grow up a rich woman, Eily, with the
treasure ye have there; but it might all as well be frogs and toads, if
with it ye have not the loving heart and the helping hand that will make
a good woman of ye, and happy folk of yer neighbors.And now good-by,
mavourneen, and the blessing of the Green Men go with ye and stay with
ye, yer life long!""Good-by, yer Honor," cried Eily, gratefully."The saints reward yer
Honor's Grace for all yer kindness to a poor silly colleen like me!But,
oh, wan minute, yer Honor!"she cried, as she saw the little man about
to put on his cap."Will Docthor O'Shaughnessy be King av Ireland?Sure
it's the wicked king he'd make, intirely.Don't let him, plaze, yer
Honor!"Have no fears, Eily,
alanna!O'Shaughnessy has come into his kingdom by this time, and I
wish him joy of it."With these words he clapped his scarlet cap on his head, and vanished
like the snuff of a candle.*       *       *       *       *

Now, just about this time Dr.Michael O'Shaughnessy was dismounting from
his gig at his own back door, after a long and weary drive.He thought
little, however, about his bodily fatigue, for his heart was full of joy
and triumph, his mind absorbed in dreams of glory.He could not even
contain his thoughts, but broke out into words, as he unharnessed the
rusty old pony."An' whin I coom to the palace, I'll knock three times wid the knocker;
or maybe there'll be a bell, loike the sheriff's house (bad luck to um!)And the gossoon'll open the dure, and--

"'Phwhat's yer arrind?'"'It's Queen Victory I'm wantin',' says I.'An' ye'll till her King
Michael av Ireland is askin' for her,' I says."Thin whin Victory hears that, she'll coom roonnin' down hersilf, to bid
me welkim; an' she'll take me oop to the best room, an'--

"'Sit down an the throne, King Michael,' says she.'The other cheers
isn't good enough for the loikes of ye,' says she."'Afther ye, ma'm,' says I, moinding me manners."'An' is there annythin' I can du for ye, to-day, King Michael?'says
she, whin we've sat down an the throne."An' I says, loight and aisy loike, all as if I didn't care, 'Nothin' in
loife, ma'm, I'm obleeged to ye, widout ye'd lind me the loan o' yer
Sunday crownd,' says I, 'be way av a patthern,' says I."An' says she--"

But at this moment the royal meditations were rudely broken in upon by a
wild shriek which resounded from the house.The door was flung violently
open, and Mrs.O'Shaughnessy rushed out like a mad woman."The colleen's gone, an' me niver
shtirrin' from her side!Och, wirra, wirra!It must be the
witches has taken her clane up chimley."O'Shaughnessy stood for a moment transfixed, glaring with speechless
rage at the unhappy woman; then rushing suddenly at her, he seized and
shook her till her teeth chattered together.he yelled, beside himself with rage and
disappointment."Ye've fell ashlape, an' laved her shlip out!Sorrow
seize ye, ye're always the black bean in me porridge!"Then flinging her
from him, he cried, "I don't care!I'll be king wid
what's in there now!"He paused before the door of the best room, lately poor Eily's prison,
to draw breath and to collect his thoughts.The door was closed, and
from within--hark!Waking suddenly from her nap, had she
failed to see the girl, who had perhaps been sleeping, too?At all
events the jewels were there, in shining heaps on the floor, as he had
last seen them, with thousands more covering the floor in every
direction,--a king's ransom in half a handful of them.He would be king
yet, even if the girl were gone.Cautiously he opened the door and
looked in, his eyes glistening, his mouth fairly watering at the thought
of all the splendor which would meet his glance.Captive was there none, yet the room was not empty.Jewels were there none, yet the floor was covered; covered with living
creatures,--toads, snakes, newts, all hideous and unclean reptiles that
hop or creep or wriggle.And as the wretched man stared, with open mouth
and glaring eye-balls, oh, horror!they were all hopping, creeping,
wriggling towards the open door,--towards him!With a yell beside which
his wife's had been a whisper, O'Shaughnessy turned and fled; but after
him--through the door, down the passage and out of the house--came
hopping, creeping, wriggling his myriad pursuers.stretch your long legs, and run like a hunted hare
over hill and dale, over moss and moor.They are close behind you; they
are catching at your heels; they come from every side, surrounding you!Fly, King O'Shaughnessy!The Green Men are
hunting you, if you could but know it, in sport and in revenge; and
three times they will chase you round County Kerry, for thrice three
days, till at last they suffer you to drop exhausted in a bog, and
vanish from your sight.Eily went home with her apron full of pearls and diamonds, to
tell her story again, and this time to be believed.And she grew up a
good woman and a rich woman; and she married the young Count of
Kilmoggan, and spoke diamonds and pearls all her life long,--at least
her husband said she did, and he ought to know.cried Toto, springing lightly into the barn, and waving a
basket round his head.Spanish, Dame Clucket, where
are you all?I want all the fresh eggs you can spare, please!directly-now-this-very-moment!"and the boy tossed his basket up in the
air and caught it again, and danced a little dance of pure enjoyment,
while he waited for the hens to answer his summons.Speckle and Dame Clucket, who had been having a quiet chat together
in the mow, peeped cautiously over the billows of hay, and seeing that
Toto was alone, bade him good-morning."I don't know about eggs, to-day, Toto!""I want to
set soon, and I cannot be giving you eggs every day.""Oh, but I haven't had any for two or three days!""And I
_must_ have some to-day.Good old Clucket, dear old Cluckety, give me
some, please!""Well, I never can refuse that boy, somehow!"said Dame Clucket, half to
herself; and Mrs.Speckle agreed with her that it could not be done.Indeed, it would have been hard to say "No!"to Toto at that moment, for
he certainly was very pleasant to look at.The dusty sunbeams came
slanting through the high windows, and fell on his curly head, his
ruddy-brown cheeks, and honest gray eyes; and as the eyes danced, and
the curls danced, and the whole boy danced with the dancing sunbeams,
why, what could two soft-hearted old hens do but meekly lead the way to
where their cherished eggs lay, warm and white, in their fragrant nests
of hay?"And what is to be done with them?"Speckle, as the last egg
disappeared into the basket."We are going to have a party
to-night,--a real party!Baldhead is coming, and Jim Crow, and
Ger-Falcon.And Granny and Bruin are making all sorts of good
things,--I'll bring you out some, if I can, dear old Speckly,--and these
eggs are for a custard, don't you see?""And <DW53> and I are decorating the kitchen," continued he; "and Cracker
is cracking the nuts and polishing the apples; and Pigeon Pretty and
Miss Mary are dusting the ornaments,--so you see we are all very busy
indeed.and off ran boy Toto, with his basket of eggs, leaving the
two old hens to scratch about in the hay, clucking rather sadly over the
memories of their own chickenhood, when they, too, went to parties,
instead of laying eggs for other people's festivities.In the cottage, what a bustle was going on!The grandmother was at her
pastry-board, rolling out paste, measuring and filling and covering, as
quickly and deftly as if she had had two pairs of eyes instead of none
at all.The bear, enveloped in a huge blue-checked apron, sat with a
large mortar between his knees, pounding away at something as if his
life depended on it.On the hearth sat the squirrel, cracking nuts and
piling them up in pretty blue china dishes; and the two birds were
carefully brushing and dusting, each with a pair of dusters which she
always carried about with her,--one pair gray, and the other soft brown.As for Toto and the raccoon, they were here, there, and everywhere, all
in a moment."Now, then, where are those greens?"called the boy, when he had
carefully deposited his basket of eggs in the pantry.replied <DW53>, appearing at the same moment from the
shed, dragging a mass of ground-pine, fragrant fir-boughs, and
alder-twigs with their bright coral-red berries."We will stand these
big boughs in the corners, Toto.The creeping stuff will go over the
looking-glass and round the windows."Yes, that will do very well," said Toto."We shall need steps, though,
to reach so high, and the step-ladder is broken.""Bruin will be the step-ladder.Stand up here,
Bruin, and make yourself useful."The good bear meekly obeyed, and the raccoon, mounting nimbly upon his
shoulders, proceeded to arrange the trailing creepers with much grace
and dexterity."This reminds me of some of our honey-hunts, old fellow!""Do you remember the famous one we had in the
autumn, a little while before we came here?""That was, indeed, a famous hunt!It gave us our whole winter's supply of honey.And we might have got
twice as much more, if it hadn't been for the accident.""Tell us about it," said Toto."I wasn't with you, you know; and then
came the moving, and I forgot to ask you."<DW53>, you see, had discovered this hive in a big oak-tree, hollow
from crotch to ground.He couldn't get at it alone, for the clever bees
had made it some way down inside the trunk, and he couldn't reach far
enough down unless some one held him on the outside.So we went
together, and I stood on my hind tip-toes, and then he climbed up and
stood on my head, and I held his feet while he reached down into the
hole."said the grandmother, "that was very dangerous, Bruin."Well, you see, dear Madam," replied the bear, apologetically, "it was
really the only way.I couldn't stand on <DW53>'s head and have him hold
_my_ feet, you know; and we couldn't give up the honey, the finest crop
of the season.So--"

"Oh, it was all right!""At least, it was at
first.There was such a quantity of honey,--pots and pots of it!--and
all of the very best quality.I took out comb after comb, laying them in
the crotch of the tree for safe-keeping till I was ready to go down.""But where were the bees all the time?"replied the raccoon, "buzzing about and making a
fine fuss.They tried to sting me, of course, but my fur was too much
for them.The only part I feared for was my nose, and that I had covered
with two or three thicknesses of mullein-leaves, tied on with stout
grass.But as ill-luck would have it, they found out Bruin, and began to
buzz about him, too.One flew into his eye, and he let my feet go for an
instant,--just just for the very instant when I was leaning down as far
as I could possibly stretch to reach a particularly fine comb.Up went
my heels, of course, and down went I.""My _dear_ <DW53>!do you mean--"

"I mean _down_, dear Madam!"repeated the raccoon, gravely,--"the very
downest down there was, I assure you.I fell through that hollow tree as
the falling star darts through the ambient heavens.Luckily there was a
soft bed of moss and rotten wood at the bottom, or I might not have had
the happiness of being here at this moment.As it was--"

"As it was," interrupted the bear, "I dragged him out by the tail
through the hole at the bottom.Indeed, he looked like a hive
himself, covered from head to foot with wax and honey, and a cloud of
bees buzzing about him.But he had a huge piece of comb in each paw, and
was gobbling away, eating honey, wax, bees and all, as if nothing had
happened.""Naturally," said the raccoon, "I am of a saving disposition, as you
know, and cannot bear to see anything wasted.It is not generally known
that bees add a slight pungent flavor to the honey, which is very
agreeable.he repeated, throwing his head back, and
screwing up one eye, to contemplate the arrangement he had just
completed."How is that, Toto; pretty, eh?""But, see here, if you keep Bruin there all
day, we shall never get through all we have to do.Jump down, that's a
good fellow, and help me to polish these tankards."When all was ready, as in due time it was, surely it would have been
hard to find a pleasanter looking place than that kitchen.The clean
white walls were hung with wreaths and garlands, while the great
fir-boughs in the corners filled the air with their warm, spicy
fragrance.Every bit of metal--brass, copper, or steel--was polished so
that it shone resplendent, giving back the joyous blaze of the crackling
fire in a hundred tiny reflections.The kettle was especially glorious,
and felt the importance of its position keenly."I trust you have no unpleasant feeling about this," it said to the
black soup-kettle."Every one cannot be beautiful, you know.If you are
useful, you should be content with that."Some have the fun, and some have the trouble!""My business is to make soup, and I make it.The table was covered with a snowy cloth, and set with glistening
crockery--white and blue--and clean shining pewter.The great tankard
had been brought out of its cupboard, and polished within an inch of its
life; while the three blue ginger-jars, filled with scarlet
alder-berries, looked down complacently from their station on the
mantelpiece.As for the floor, I cannot give you an idea of the
cleanness of it.When everything else was ready and in place, the bear
had fastened a homemade scrubbing-brush to each of his four feet, and
then executed a sort of furious scrubbing-dance, which fairly made the
house shake; and the result was a shining purity which vied with that
of the linen table-cloth, or the very kettle itself.And you should have seen the good bear, when his toilet was completed!The scrubbing-brushes had been applied to his own shaggy coat as well as
to the floor, and it shone, in its own way, with as much lustre as
anything else; and in his left ear was stuck a red rose, from the
monthly rose-bush which stood in the sunniest window and blossomed all
winter long.It is extremely uncomfortable to have a rose stuck in one's
ear,--you may try it yourself, and see how you like it; but Toto had
stuck it there, and nothing would have induced Bruin to remove it.And
you should have seen our Toto himself, carrying his own roses on his
cheeks, and enough sunshine in his eyes to make a thunder-cloud laugh!And you should have seen the great <DW53>, glorious in scarlet
neck-ribbon, and behind his ear (_not_ in it!<DW53> was not Bruin) a
scarlet feather, the gift of Miss Mary, and very precious.And you
should have seen the little squirrel, attired in his own bushy tail,
and rightly thinking that he needed no other adornment; and the parrot
and the wood-pigeon, both trim and elegant, with their plumage arranged
to the last point of perfection.Last of all, you should have seen the
dear old grandmother, the beloved Madam, with her snowy curls and cap
and kerchief; and the ebony stick which generally lived in a drawer and
silver paper, and only came out on great occasions.How proud Toto was
of his Granny!and how the others all stood around her, gazing with
wondering admiration at her gold-bowed spectacles (for those she usually
wore were of horn) and the large breastpin, with a weeping-willow
displayed upon it, which fastened her kerchief."Made out of your grandfather's tail, did you say, Toto?"said the bear,
in an undertone.cried the boy, half pettishly.Surely you might know by this time that we have no tails.""I beg your pardon,
Toto, boy.You are not really vexed with old Bruin?"Toto rubbed his curly head affectionately against the shaggy black one,
in token of amity, and the bear continued:--

"When Madam was a young grandmother, was she as beautiful as she is
now?""Why, yes, I fancy so," replied Toto."Only she wasn't a grandmother
then, you know."You never were
anything but a boy, were you?"When Granny
was young, she was a girl, you see.""I--do--_not_--believe it!I saw a girl once--many years ago; it squinted, and its hair was frowzy,
and it wore a hideous basket of flowers on its head,--a dreadful
creature!Madam never can have looked like _that_!"At this moment a knock was heard at the door.Toto flew to open it, and
with a beaming face ushered in the old hermit, who entered leaning on
his stick, with his crow perched on one shoulder and the hawk on the
other.What bows and
courtesies, and whisking of tails and flapping of wings!The hermit's
bow in greeting to the old lady was so stately that Master <DW53> was
consumed with a desire to imitate it; and in so doing, he stepped back
against the nose of the tea-kettle and burned himself, which caused him
to retire suddenly under the table with a smothered shriek.And the hawk and the pigeon, the raccoon and the crow,
the hermit and the bear, all shook paws and claws, and vowed that they
were delighted to see each other; and what is more, they really _were_
delighted, which is not always the case when such vows are made.Now, when all had become well acquainted, and every heart was prepared
to be merry, they sat down to supper; and the supper was not one which
was likely to make them less cheerful.For there was chicken and ham,
and, oh, such a mutton-pie!You never saw such a pie; the standing crust
was six inches high, and solid as a castle wall; and on that lay the
upper-crust, as lightly as a butterfly resting on a leaf; while inside
was store of good mutton, and moreover golden eggballs and tender little
onions, and gravy as rich as all the kings of the earth put together.and besides all that there was white bread like snow, and brown
bread as sweet as clover-blossoms, and jam and gingerbread, and apples
and nuts, and pitchers of cream and jugs of buttermilk.Truly, it does
one's heart good to think of such a supper, and I only wish that you and
I had been there to help eat it.However, there was no lack of hungry
mouths, with right good-will to keep their jaws at work, and for a time
there was little conversation around the table, but much joy and comfort
in the good victuals.The good grandmother ate little herself, though she listened with
pleasure to the stirring sound of knives and forks, which told her that
her guests were well and pleasantly employed.Presently the hermit
addressed her, and said:--

"Honored Madam, you will be glad to know that there has been a great
change in the weather during the past week.Truly, I think the spring is
at hand; for the snow is fast melting away, the sun shines with more
than winter's heat, and the air to-day is mild and soft."At these words there was a subdued but evident excitement among the
company.The raccoon and the squirrel exchanged swift and significant
glances; the birds, as if by one unconscious impulse, ruffled their
feathers and plumed themselves a little.But boy Toto's face fell, and
he looked at the bear, who, for his part, scratched his nose and looked
intently at the pattern on his plate."It has been a long, an unusually long, season," continued the hermit,
"though doubtless it has seemed much shorter to you in your cosey
cottage than to me in my lonely cavern.But I have lived the
forest-life long enough to know that some of you, my friends," and he
turned with a smile to the forest-friends, "must be already longing to
hear the first murmur of the greenwood spring, and to note in tree and
shrub the first signs of awakening life."There was a moment of silence, during which the raccoon shifted uneasily
on his seat, and looked about him with restless, gleaming eyes.Suddenly
the silence was broken by a singular noise, which made every one start.It was a long-drawn sound, something between a snort, a squeal, and a
snore; and it came from--where _did_ it come from?"It seemed to come," said the hawk, who sat facing the fire, "from the
wall near the fireplace."At this moment the sound was heard again, louder and more distinct, and
this time it certainly _did_ come from the wall,--or rather from the
cupboard in the wall, near the fireplace.Then came a muffled, scuffling sound, and finally
a shrill peevish voice cried, "Let me out!<DW53>, I
know your tricks; let me out, or I'll tell Bruin this minute!"The bear burst into a volcanic roar of laughter, which made the hermit
start and turn pale in spite of himself, and going to the cupboard he
drew out the unhappy woodchuck, hopelessly entangled in his worsted
covering, from which he had been vainly struggling to free himself.It seemed as they would never have done
laughing; while every moment the woodchuck grew more furious,--squeaking
and barking, and even trying to bite the mighty paw which held him.But
the wood-pigeon had pity on him, and with a few sharp pulls broke the
worsted net, and begged Bruin to set him down on the table.This being
done, Master Chucky found his nose within precisely half an inch of a
most excellent piece of dried beef, upon which he fell without more ado,
and stayed not to draw breath till the plate was polished clean and
dry.That made every one laugh again, and altogether they were very merry,
and fell to playing games and telling stories, leaving the woodchuck to
try the keen edge of his appetite upon every dish on the table.By-and-by, however, this gentleman could eat no more; so he wiped his
paws and whiskers, brushed his coat a little, and then joined in the
sport with right good-will.It was a pleasant sight to see the great bear blindfolded, chasing Toto
and <DW53> from one corner to another, in a grand game of blindman's buff;
it was pleasant to see them playing leap-frog, and spin-the-platter, and
many a good old-fashioned game besides.Then, when these sat down to
rest and recover their breath, what a treat it was to see the four birds
dance a quadrille, to the music of Toto's fiddle!How they fluttered and
sidled, and hopped and bridled!How gracefully Miss Mary courtesied to
the stately hawk; and how jealous the crow was of this rival, who stood
on one leg with such a perfect grace!altogether that was a party worth going to.And when late in the
evening it broke up, and the visitors started on their homeward walk,
all declared it was the merriest time they had yet had together, and all
wished that they might have many more such times.And yet each one knew
in his heart,--and grieved to know,--that it was the last, and that the
end was come.The woodchuck sounded, the next morning, the note
which had for days been vibrating in the hearts of all the wild
creatures, but which they had been loth to strike, for Toto's sake.I don't know what you are all
thinking of, to stay on here after you are awake.I smelt the wet earth
and the water, and the sap running in the trees, even in that dungeon
where you had put me.The young reeds will soon be starting beside the
pool, and it is my work to trim them and thin them out properly;
besides, I am going to dig a new burrow, this year.And the squirrel with a chuckle, and the wood-pigeon with a sigh, and
the raccoon with a strange feeling which he hardly understood, but
which was not all pleasure, echoed the words, "We must be off!"Only the
bear said nothing, for he was in the wood-shed, splitting kindling-wood
with a fury of energy which sent the chips flying as if he were a
saw-mill.So it came to pass that on a soft, bright day in April, when the sun was
shining sweetly, and the wind blew warm from the south, and the buds
were swelling on willow and alder, the party of friends stood around the
door of the little cottage, exchanging farewells, half merry, half sad,
and wholly loving."After all, it is hardly good-by!""We shall
be here half the time, just as we were last summer; and the other half,
Toto will be in the forest.But Bruin rubbed his nose with his right paw, and said nothing."And you will come to the forest, too, dear Madam!"cried the raccoon,
"will you not?You will bring the knitting and the gingerbread, and we
will have picnics by the pool, and you will learn to love the forest as
much as Toto does.But Bruin rubbed his nose with his left paw, and still said nothing."And when my nest is made, and my little ones are fledged," cooed the
wood-pigeon in her tender voice, "their first flight shall be to you,
dear Madam, and their first song shall tell you that they love you, and
that we love you, every day and all day.For we do love you; don't we,
Bruin?"But the bear only looked helplessly around him, and scratched his head,
and again said nothing."Well," said Toto, cheerily, though with a suspicion of a quiver in his
voice, "you are all jolly good fellows, and we have had a merry winter
together.Of course we shall miss you sadly, Granny and I; but as you
say, Cracker, we shall all see each other every day; and I am longing
for the forest, too, almost as much as you are.""Dear friends," said the blind grandmother, folding her hands upon her
stick, and turning her kindly face from one to the other of the
group,--"dear friends, merry and helpful companions, this has indeed
been a happy season that we have spent together.You have, one and all,
been a comfort and a help to me, and I think you have not been
discontented yourselves; still, the confinement has of course been
strange to you, and we cannot wonder that you pine for your free,
wildwood life.it is a mischievous paw, but it
has never played any tricks on me, and has helped me many and many a
time.My little Cracker, I shall miss your merry chatter as I sit at my
spinning-wheel.Mary, and Pigeon Pretty, let me stroke your soft
feathers once more, by way of 'good-by.'Woodchuck, I have seen little
of you, but I trust you have enjoyed your visit, in your own way."And now, last of all, Bruin!come here and let
me shake your honest, shaggy paw, and thank you for all that you have
done for me and for my boy.""Why, where _is_ Bruin?"cried Toto, starting and looking round; "surely
he was here a minute ago.But no deep voice was heard, roaring cheerfully, "Here, Toto boy!"No
shaggy form came in sight."He has gone on ahead, probably," said the raccoon; "he said something,
this morning, about not liking to say good-by.Come, you others, we must
follow our leader.And with many a backward glance, and many a wave of paw, or tail, or
fluttering wing, the party of friends took their way to the forest home.Boy Toto stood with his hands in his pockets, looking after them with
bright, wide-open eyes.He did not cry,--it was a part of Toto's creed
that boys did not cry after they had left off petticoats,--but he felt
that if he had been a girl, the tears might have come in spite of him.So he stared very hard, and puckered his mouth in a silent whistle, and
felt of the marbles in his pockets,--for that is always a soothing and
comforting thing to do."Toto, dear," said his grandmother, "do you think our Bruin is really
_gone_, without saying a word of farewell to us?"cried the old lady, putting her handkerchief
to her sightless eyes,--"very, very much grieved!If it had been <DW53>,
now, I should not have been so much surprised; but for Bruin, our
faithful friend and helper, to leave us so, seems--"

"_Hello!_" cried Toto, starting suddenly, "what is that noise?"on the quiet air came the sharp crashing sound
of an axe.I'll go--" and with that
he went, as if he had been shot out of a catapult.Rushing into the wood-shed, he caught sight of the well-beloved shaggy
figure, just raising the axe to deliver a fearful blow at an unoffending
log of wood.Flinging his arms round it (the figure, not the axe nor the
log), he gave it such a violent hug that bear and boy sat down suddenly
on the ground, while the axe flew to the other end of the shed.cried Toto, "we thought you were gone, without
saying a word to us.The bear rubbed his nose confusedly, and muttered something about "a few
more sticks in case of cold weather."But here Toto burst out laughing in spite of himself, for the shed was
piled so high with kindling-wood that the bear sat as it were at the
bottom of a pit whose sides of neatly split sticks rose high above his
head."There's kindling-wood enough here to
last us ten years, at the very least.She
thought--"

"There will be more butter to make, now, Toto, since that new calf has
come," said the bear, breaking in with apparent irrelevance."And that pig is getting too big for you to manage," continued Bruin, in
a serious tone."He was impudent to _me_ the other day, and I had to
take him up by the tail and swing him, before he would apologize.Now,
you _couldn't_ take him up by the tail, Toto, much less swing him, and
there is no use in your deceiving yourself about it.""No one could, except you, old
monster.But what _are_ you thinking about that for, now?Granny will think you are gone, after all."And catching the
bear by the ear, he led him back in triumph to the cottage-door, crying,
"Granny, Granny!Now give him a good scolding, please, for
frightening us so."She only stroked the shaggy black
fur, and said, "Bruin, dear!my good, faithful, true-hearted Bruin!I
could not bear to think that you had left me without saying good-by.But you would not have done it, would you,
Bruin?The bear looked about him distractedly, and bit his paw severely, as if
to relieve his feelings."At least, if I meant
to say good-by.I wouldn't say it, because I couldn't.But I don't mean
to say it,--I mean I don't mean to do it.If you don't want me in the
house,--being large and clumsy, as I am well aware, and ugly too,--I can
sleep out by the pump, and come in to do the work.But I cannot leave
the boy, please, dear Madam, nor you.And the calf wants attention, and
that pig _ought_ to be swung at least once a week, and--and--"

But there was no need of further speech, for Toto's arms were clinging
round his neck, and Toto's voice was shouting exclamations of delight;
and the grandmother was shaking his great black paw, and calling him
her best friend, her dearest old Bruin, and telling him that he should
never leave them.And, in fact, he never did leave them.He settled down quietly in the
little cottage, and washed and churned, baked and brewed, milked the cow
and kept the pig in order.Happy was the good bear, and happy was Toto,
in those pleasant days.For every afternoon, when the work was done,
they welcomed one or all of their forest friends; or else they sought
the green, beloved forest themselves, and sat beside the fairy pool, and
wandered in the cool green mazes where all was sweetness and peace, with
rustle of leaves and murmur of water, and chirp of bird and insect.But
evening found them always at the cottage door again, bringing their
woodland joyousness to the blind grandmother, making the kitchen ring
with laughter as they related the last exploits of the raccoon or the
squirrel, or described the courtship of the parrot and the crow.And if you had asked any of the three, as they sat together in the
porch, who was the happiest person in the world, why, Toto and the
Grandmother would each have answered, "I!"But Bruin, who had never
studied grammar, and knew nothing whatever about his nominatives and his
accusatives, would have roared with a thunder-burst of enthusiasm,

Transcriber's Notes:

Obvious punctuation errors repaired.Page 44, illustration caption, "Wah-song!When they do occur, however, the lessons taught
by them are, though distinct enough, apt to be in one important
respect of a far less satisfactory character than those taught by
collisions.In the case of these last the great resultant fact
speaks for itself.The whole community knows when it sees a block
system, or a stronger car construction, or an improved train brake
suddenly introduced that the sacrifice has not been in vain--that
the lesson has been learned.It is by no means always so in the
case of accidents on bridges.With these the cause of disaster
is apt to be so scientific in its nature that it cannot even be
described, except through the use of engineering terms which to the
mass of readers are absolutely incomprehensible.The simplest of
railroad bridges is an inexplicable mystery to at least ninety-nine
persons out of each hundred.Even when the cause of disaster is
understood, the precautions taken against its recurrence cannot be
seen.From the nature of the case they must consist chiefly of a
better material, or a more scientific construction, or an increased
watchfulness on the part of officials and subordinates.This,
however, is not apparent on the surface, and, when the next accident
of the same nature occurs, the inference, as inevitable as it is
usually unjust, is at once drawn that the one which preceded it
had been productive of no results.The truth of this was strongly
illustrated by the two bridge accidents which happened, the one at
Ashtabula, Ohio, on the 29th of December, 1876, and the other at
Tariffville, Connecticut, on the 15th of January, 1878.There has been no recent disaster which combined more elements
of horror or excited more widespread public emotion than that at
Ashtabula bridge.It was, indeed, so terrible in its character and
so heart-rending in its details, that for the time being it fairly
divided the attention of the country with that dispute over the
presidential succession, then the subject uppermost in the minds of
all.A blinding northeasterly snow-storm, accompanied by a heavy
wind, prevailed throughout the day which preceded the accident,
greatly impeding the movement of trains.The Pacific express over
the Michigan Southern & Lake Shore road had left Erie, going west,
considerably behind its time, and had been started only with great
difficulty and with the assistance of four locomotives.It was due
at Ashtabula at about 5.30 o'clock P.M., but was three hours late,
and, the days being then at their shortest, when it arrived at the
bridge which was the scene of the accident the darkness was so great
that nothing could be seen through the driving snow by those on the
leading locomotive even for a distance of 50 feet ahead.The train
was made up of two heavy locomotives, four baggage, mail and express
cars, one smoking car, two ordinary coaches, a drawing-room car
and three sleepers, being in all two locomotives and eleven cars,
in the order named, containing, as nearly as can be ascertained,
190 human beings, of whom 170 were passengers.Ashtabula bridge is
situated only about 1,000 feet east of the station of the same name,
and spans a deep ravine, at the bottom of which flows a shallow
stream, some two or three feet in depth, which empties into Lake
Erie a mile or two away.The bridge was an iron Howe truss of 150
feet span, elevated 69 feet above the bottom of the ravine, and
supported at either end by solid masonwork abutments.As the train approached the bridge it had
to force its way through a heavy snow-drift, and, when it passed
onto it, it was moving at a speed of some twelve or fourteen miles
an hour.The entire length of the bridge afforded space only for
two of the express cars at most in addition to the locomotives,
so that when the wheels of the leading locomotive rested on the
western abutment of the bridge nine of the eleven cars which made up
the train, including all those in which there were passengers, had
yet to reach its eastern end.At the instant when the train stood
in this position, the engineer of the leading locomotive heard a
sudden cracking sound apparently beneath him, and thought he felt
the bridge giving way.Instantly pulling the throttle valve wide
open, his locomotive gave a spring forward and, as it did so, the
bridge fell, the rear wheels of his tender falling with it.The
jerk and impetus of the locomotive, however, sufficed to tear out
the coupling, and as his tender was dragged up out of the abyss
onto the track, though its rear wheels did not get upon the rails,
the frightened engineer caught a fearful glimpse of the second
locomotive as it seemed to turn and then fall bottom upwards into
the ravine.The bridge had given way, not at once but by a slowly
sinking motion, which began at the point where the pressure was
heaviest, under the two locomotives and at the west abutment.There
being two tracks, and this train being on the southernmost of the
two, the southern truss had first yielded, letting that side of
the bridge down, and rolling, as it were, the second locomotive
and the cars immediately behind it off to the left and quite clear
of a straight line drawn between the two abutments; then almost
immediately the other truss gave way and the whole bridge fell, but
in doing so swung slightly to the right.Before this took place the
entire train with the exception of the last two sleepers had reached
the chasm, each car as it passed over falling nearer than the one
which had preceded it to the east abutment, and finally the last two
sleepers came, and, without being deflected from their course at
all, plunged straight down and fell upon the wreck of the bridge at
its east end.It was necessarily all the work of a few seconds.At the bottom of the ravine the snow lay waist deep and the stream
was covered with ice some eight inches in thickness.Upon this
were piled up the fallen cars and engine, the latter on top of the
former near the western abutment and upside down.All the passenger
cars were heated by stoves.At first a dead silence seemed to
follow the successive shocks of the falling mass.In less than
two minutes, however, the fire began to show itself and within
fifteen the holocaust was at its height.As usual, it was a mass of
human beings, all more or less stunned, a few killed, many injured
and helpless, and more yet simply pinned down to watch, in the
possession as full as helpless of all their faculties, the rapid
approach of the flames.The number of those killed outright seems
to have been surprisingly small.In the last car, for instance,
no one was lost.This was due to the energy and presence of mind
of the porter, a <DW64> named Steward, who, when he felt the car
resting firmly on its side, broke a window and crawled through it,
and then passed along breaking the other windows and extricating
the passengers until all were gotten out.Those in the other cars
were far less fortunate.Though an immediate alarm had been given
in the neighboring town, the storm was so violent and the snow so
deep that assistance arrived but slowly.Nor when it did arrive
could much be effected.The essential thing was to extinguish the
flames.The means for so doing were close at hand in a steam pump
belonging to the railroad company, while an abundance of hose could
have been procured at another place but a short distance off.In
the excitement and agitation of the moment contradictory orders
were given, even to forbidding the use of the pump, and practically
no effort to extinguish the fire was made.Within half an hour of
the accident the flames were at their height, and when the next
morning dawned nothing remained in the ravine but a charred and
undistinguishable mass of car trucks, brake-rods, twisted rails and
bent and tangled bridge iron, with the upturned locomotive close to
the west abutment.In this accident some eighty persons are supposed to have lost
their lives, while over sixty others were injured.The exact number
of those killed can never be known, however, as more than half of
those reported were utterly consumed in the fire; indeed, even of
the bodies recovered scarcely one half could be identified.Of the
cause of the disaster much was said at the time in language most
unnecessarily scientific;--but little was required to be said.It
admitted of no extenuation.An iron bridge, built in the early days
of iron-bridges,--that which fell under the train at Ashtabula, was
faulty in its original construction, and the indications of weakness
it had given had been distinct, but had not been regarded.That it
had stood so long and that it should have given way when it did,
were equally matters for surprise.A double track bridge, it should
naturally have fallen under the combined pressure of trains moving
simultaneously in opposite directions.The strain under which it
yielded was not a particularly severe one, even taken in connection
with the great atmospheric pressure of the storm then prevailing.It was, in short, one of those disasters, fortunately of infrequent
occurrence, with which accident has little if any connection.It was due to original inexperience and to subsequent ignorance
or carelessness, or possibly recklessness as criminal as it was
fool-hardy.Besides being a bridge accident, this was also a stove accident,--in
this respect a repetition of Angola.One of the most remarkable
features about it, indeed, was the fearful rapidity with which
the fire spread, and the incidents of its spread detailed in the
subsequent evidence of the survivors were simply horrible.Men,
women and children, full of the instinct of self-preservation, were
caught and pinned fast for the advancing flames, while those who
tried to rescue them were driven back by the heat and compelled
helplessly to listen to their shrieks.It is, however, unnecessary
to enter into these details, for they are but the repetition of
an experience which has often been told, and they do but enforce
a lesson which the railroad companies seem resolved not to learn.Unquestionably the time in this country will come when through
trains will be heated from a locomotive or a heating-car.That time,
however, had not yet come.Meanwhile the evidence would seem to show
that at Ashtabula, as at Angola, at least two lives were sacrificed
in the subsequent fire to each one lost in the immediate shock of
the disaster.[8]

  [8] The Angola was probably the most impressively horrible of the
  many "stove accidents."That which occurred near Prospect, N. Y.,
  upon the Buffalo, Corry & Pittsburgh road, on December 24, 1872,
  should not, however, be forgotten.In this case a trestle bridge
  gave way precipitating a passenger train some thirty feet to the
  bottom of a ravine, where the cars caught fire from the stoves.Nineteen lives were lost, mostly by burning.The Richmond Switch
  disaster of April 19, 1873, on the New York, Providence & Boston
  road was of the same character.Three passengers only were there
  burned to death, but after the disaster the flames rushed "through
  the car as quickly as if the wood had been a lot of hay," and, after
  those who were endeavoring to release the wounded and imprisoned men
  were driven away, their cries were for some time heard through the
  smoke and flame.But a few days more than a year after the Ashtabula accident another
catastrophe, almost exactly similar in its details, occurred on
the Connecticut Western road.It is impossible to even estimate
the amount of overhauling to which bridges throughout the country
had in the meanwhile been subjected, or the increased care used
in their examination.All that can be said is that during the
year 1877 no serious accident due to the inherent weakness of any
bridge occcurred on the 70,000 miles of American railroad.Neither,
so far as can be ascertained, was the Tariffville disaster to be
referred to that cause.It happened on the evening of January 15,
1878.A large party of excursionists were returning from a Moody
and Sankey revival meeting on a special train, consisting of two
locomotives and ten cars.Half a mile west of Tariffville the
railroad crosses the Farmington river.John journeyed to the kitchen.The bridge at this point was
a wooden Howe truss, with two spans of 163 feet each.It had been
in use about seven years and, originally of ample strength and good
construction, there is no evidence that its strength had since been
unduly impaired by neglect or exposure.It should, therefore, have
sufficed to bear twice the strain to which it was now subjected.Exactly as at Ashtabula, however, the west span of the bridge gave
way under the train just as the leading locomotives passed onto the
tressel-work beyond it: the ice broke under the falling wreck, and
the second locomotive with four cars were precipitated into the
river.The remaining cars were stopped by the rear end of the third
car, resting as it did on the centre pier of the bridge, and did
not leave the rails.The fall to the surface of the ice was about
ten feet.There was no fire to add to the horrors in this case, but
thirteen persons were crushed to death or drowned, and thirty-three
others injured.[9]

  [9] Of the same general character with the Tariffville and Ashtabula
  accidents were those which occurred on November 1, 1855, upon the
  Pacific railroad of Missouri at the bridge over the Gasconade, and
  on July 27, 1875, upon the Northern Pacific at the bridge over the
  Mississippi near Brainerd.In the first of these accidents the
  bridge gave way under an excursion train, in honor of the opening
  of the road, and its chief engineer was among the killed.The train
  fell some thirty feet, and 22 persons lost their lives while over 50
  suffered serious injuries.At Brainerd the train,--a "mixed" one,--went down nearly 80 feet
  into the river.The locomotive and several cars had passed the span
  which fell, in safety, but were pulled back and went down on top
  of the train.There were but few passengers in it, of whom three
  were killed.In falling the caboose car at the rear of the train,
  in which most of the passengers were, struck on a pier and broke in
  two, leaving several passengers in it.In the case of the Gasconade,
  the disaster was due to the weakness of the bridge, which fell under
  the weight of the train.There is some question as to the Brainerd
  accident, whether it was occasioned by weakness of the bridge or the
  derailment upon it of a freight car.Naturally the popular inference was at once drawn that this was
a mere repetition of the Ashtabula experience,--that the fearful
earlier lesson had been thrown away on a corporation either
unwilling or not caring to learn.The newspapers far and wide
resounded with ill considered denunciation, and the demand was loud
for legislation of the crudest conceivable character, especially
a law prohibiting the passage over any bridge of two locomotives
attached to one passenger train.The fact, however, seems to be
that, except in its superficial details, the Tariffville disaster
had no features in common with that at Ashtabula; as nearly as
can be ascertained it was due neither to the weakness nor to the
overloading of the bridge.Though the evidence subsequently given
is not absolutely conclusive on this point, the probabilities
would seem to be that, while on the bridge, the second locomotive
was derailed in some unexplained way and consequently fell on
the stringers which yielded under the sudden blow.The popular
impression, therefore, as to the bearing which the first of these
two strikingly similar accidents had upon the last tended only to
bring about results worse than useless.The bridge fell, not under
the steady weight of two locomotives, but under the sudden shock
incident to the derailment of one.The remedy, therefore, lay in the
direction of so planking or otherwise guarding the floors of similar
bridges that in case of derailment the locomotives or cars should
not fall on the stringers or greatly diverge from the rails so as
to endanger the trusses.On the other hand the suggestion of a law
prohibiting the passage over bridges of more than one locomotive
with any passenger train, while in itself little better than a legal
recognition of bad bridge building, also served to divert public
attention from the true lesson of the disaster.Another newspaper
precaution, very favorably considered at the time, was the putting
of one locomotive, where two had to be used, at the rear end of the
train as a pusher, instead of both in front.This expedient might
indeed obviate one cause of danger, but it would do so only by
substituting for it another which has been the fruitful source of
some of the worst railroad disasters on record.[10]

  [10] "The objectionable and dangerous practice also employed on some
  railways of assisting trains up inclines by means of pilot engines
  in the rear instead of in front, has led to several accidents in
  the past year and should be discontinued."--_General Report to the
  Board of Trade upon the Accidents on the Railways of Great Britain
  in 1878, p.Long, varied and terrible as the record of bridge disasters has
become, there are, nevertheless, certain very simple and inexpensive
precautions against them, which, altogether too frequently,
corporations do not and will not take.At Ashtabula the bridge
gave way.There was no derailment as there seems to have been
at Tariffville.The sustaining power of a bridge is, of course,
a question comparatively difficult of ascertainment.A fatal
weakness in this respect may be discernable only to the eye of a
trained expert.Derailment, however, either upon a bridge, or when
approaching it, is in the vast majority of cases a danger perfectly
easy to guard against.The precautions are simple and they are not
expensive, yet, taking the railroads of the United States as a
whole, it may well be questioned whether the bridges at which they
have been taken do not constitute the exception rather than the
rule.Not only is the average railroad superintendent accustomed
to doing his work and running his road under a constant pressure to
make both ends meet, which, as he well knows, causes his own daily
bread to depend upon the economies he can effect; but, while he
finds it hard work at best to provide for the multifarious outlays,
long immunity from disaster breeds a species of recklessness even
in the most cautious:--and yet the single mishap in a thousand
must surely fall to the lot of some one.Many years ago the
terrible results which must soon or late be expected wherever the
consequences of a derailment on the approaches to a bridge are not
securely guarded against, were illustrated by a disaster on the
Great Western railroad of Canada, which combined many of the worst
horrors of both the Norwalk and the New Hamburg tragedies; more
recently the almost forgotten lesson was enforced again on the
Vermont & Massachusetts road, upon the bridge over the Miller River,
at Athol.The accident last referred to occurred on the 16th of
June, 1870, but, though forcible enough as a reminder, it was tame
indeed in comparison with the Des Jardines Canal disaster, which
is still remembered though it happened so long ago as the 17th of
March, 1857.The Great Western railroad of Canada crossed the canal by a bridge
at an elevation of about sixty feet.At the time of the accident
there were some eighteen feet of water in the canal, though, as
is usual in Canada at that season, it was covered by ice some two
feet in thickness.On the afternoon of the 17th of March as the
local accommodation train from Hamilton was nearing the bridge,
its locomotive, though it was then moving at a very slow rate of
speed, was in some way thrown from the track and onto the timbers
of the bridge.These it cut through, and then falling heavily on
the string-pieces it parted them, and instantly pitched headlong
down upon the frozen surface of the canal below, dragging after it
the tender, baggage car and two passenger cars, which composed the
whole train.There was nothing whatever to break the fall of sixty
feet; and even then two feet of ice only intervened between the
ruins of the train and the bottom of the canal eighteen feet below.Two feet of solid ice will afford no contemptible resistance to a
falling body; the locomotive and tender crushed heavily through
it and instantly sank out of sight.In falling the baggage car
struck a corner of the tender and was thus thrown some ten yards
to one side, and was followed by the first passenger car, which,
turning a somersault as it went, fell on its roof and was crushed to
fragments, but only partially broke through the ice, upon which the
next car fell endwise, and rested in that position.That every human
being in the first car was either crushed or drowned seems most
natural; the only cause for astonishment is found in the fact that
any one should have survived such a catastrophe,--a tumble of sixty
feet on ice as solid as a rock!Yet of four persons in the baggage
car three went down with it, and not one of them was more than
slightly injured.The engineer and fireman, and the occupants of the
second passenger car, were less fortunate.The former were found
crushed under the locomotive at the bottom of the canal; while of
the latter ten were killed, and not one escaped severe injury.Very
rarely indeed in the history of railroad accidents have so large a
portion of those on the train lost their lives as in this case, for
out of ninety persons sixty perished, and in the number was included
every woman and child among the passengers, with a single exception.There were two circumstances about this disaster worthy of especial
notice.In the first place, as well as can now be ascertained in
the absence of any trustworthy record of an investigation into
causes, the accident was easily preventable.It appears to have
been immediately caused by the derailment of a locomotive, however
occasioned, just as it was entering on a swing draw-bridge.Thrown
from the tracks, there was nothing in the flooring to prevent the
derailed locomotive from deflecting from its course until it toppled
over the ends of the ties, nor were the ties and the flooring
apparently sufficiently strong to sustain it even while it held to
its course.Under such circumstances the derailment of a locomotive
upon any bridge can mean only destruction; it meant it then,
it means it now; and yet our country is to-day full of bridges
constructed in an exactly similar way.To make accidents from this
cause, if not impossible at least highly improbable, it is only
necessary to make the ties and flooring of all bridges between the
tracks and for three feet on either side of them sufficiently strong
to sustain the whole weight of a train off the track and in motion,
while a third rail, or strong truss of wood, securely fastened,
should be laid down midway between the rails throughout the entire
length of the bridge and its approaches.With this arrangement, as
the flanges of the wheels are on the inside, it must follow that in
case of derailment and a divergence to one side or the other of the
bridge, the inner side of the flange will come against the central
rail or truss just so soon as the divergence amounts to half the
space between the rails, which in the ordinary gauge is two feet and
four inches.The wheels must then glide along this guard, holding
the train from any further divergence from its course, until it
can be checked.Meanwhile, as the ties and flooring extend for the
space of three feet outside of the track, a sufficient support is
furnished by them for the other wheels.A legislative enactment
compelling the construction of all bridges in this way, coupled with
additional provisions for interlocking of draws with their signals
in cases of bridges across navigable waters, would be open to
objection that laws against dangers of accident by rail have almost
invariably proved ineffective when they were not absurd, but in
itself, if enforced, it might not improbably render disasters like
those at Norwalk and Des Jardines terrors of the past.CAR-COUPLINGS IN DERAILMENTS.Wholly apart from the derailment, which was the real occasion of
the Des Jardines disaster, there was one other cause which largely
contributed to its fatality, if indeed that fatality was not in
greatest part immediately due to it.The question as to what is the best method of coupling together
the several individual vehicles which make up every railroad
train has always been much discussed among railroad mechanics.The decided weight of opinion has been in favor of the strongest
and closest couplings, so that under no circumstances should the
train separate into parts.Taking all forms of railroad accident
together, this conclusion is probably sound.It is, however, at
best only a balancing of disadvantages,--a mere question as to
which practice involves the least amount of danger.Yet a very
terrible demonstration that there are two sides to this as to most
other questions was furnished at Des Jardines.It was the custom
on the Great Western road not only to couple the cars together in
the method then in general use, but also, as is often done now, to
connect them by heavy chains on each side of the centre coupling.Accordingly when the locomotive broke through the Des Jardines
bridge, it dragged the rest of the train hopelessly after it.This
certainly would not have happened had the modern self-coupler been
in use, and probably would not have happened had the cars been
connected only by the ordinary link and pins; for the train was
going very slowly, and the signal for brakes was given in ample time
to apply them vigorously before the last cars came to the opening,
into which they were finally dragged by the dead weight before them
and not hurried by their own momentum.On the other hand, we have not far to go in search of scarcely less
fatal disasters illustrating with equal force the other side of the
proposition, in the terrible consequences which have ensued from the
separation of cars in cases of derailment.Take, for instance, the
memorable accident of June 17, 1858, near Port Jervis, on the Erie
railway.As the express train from New York was running at a speed of about
thirty miles an hour over a perfectly straight piece of track
between Otisville and Port Jervis, shortly after dark on the evening
of that day, it encountered a broken rail.The train was made up
of a locomotive, two baggage cars and five passenger cars, all of
which except the last passed safely over the fractured rail.The
last car was apparently derailed, and drew the car before it off the
track.These two cars were then dragged along, swaying fearfully
from side to side, for a distance of some four hundred feet, when
the couplings at last snapped and they went over the embankment,
which was there some thirty feet in height.As they rushed down the
<DW72> the last car turned fairly over, resting finally on its roof,
while one of its heavy iron trucks broke through and fell upon the
passengers beneath, killing and maiming them.The other car, more
fortunate, rested at last upon its side on a pile of stones at the
foot of the embankment.Six persons were killed and fifty severely
injured; all of the former in the last car.In this case, had the couplings held, the derailed cars would
not have gone over the embankment and but slight injuries would
have been sustained.Modern improvements have, however, created
safeguards sufficient to prevent the recurrence of other accidents
under the same conditions as that at Port Jervis.The difficulty lay
in the inability to stop a train, though moving at only moderate
speed, within a reasonable time.The wretched inefficiency of the
old hand-brake in a sudden emergency received one more illustration.The train seems to have run nearly half a mile after the accident
took place before it could be stopped, although the engineer had
instant notice of it and reversed his locomotive.The couplings did
not snap until a distance had been traversed in which the modern
train-brake would have reduced the speed to a point at which they
would have been subjected to no dangerous strain.The accident ten years later at Carr's Rock, sixteen miles west of
Port Jervis, on the same road, was again very similar to the one
just described: and yet in this case the parting of the couplings
alone prevented the rear of the train from dragging its head to
destruction.Both disasters were occasioned by broken rails; but,
while the first occurred on a tangent, the last was at a point where
the road skirted the hills, by a sharp curve, upon the outer side of
which was a steep declivity of some eighty feet, jagged with rock
and bowlders.It befell the night express on the 14th of April,
1876.The train was a long one, consisting of the locomotive, three
baggage and express, and seven passenger cars, and it encountered
the broken rail while rounding the curve at a high rate of speed.Again all except the last car, passed over the fracture in safety;
this was snapped, as it were, off the track and over the embankment.At first it was dragged along, but only for a short distance; the
intense strain then broke the coupling between the four rear cars
and the head of the train, and, the last of the four being already
over the embankment, the others almost instantly toppled over after
it and rolled down the ravine.A passenger on this portion of the
train, described the car he was in "as going over and over, until
the outer roof was torn off, the sides fell out, and the inner roof
was crushed in."Twenty-four persons were killed and eighty injured;
but in this instance, as in that at Des Jardines, the only occasion
for surprise was that there were any survivors.Accidents arising from the parting of defective couplings have of
course not been uncommon, and they constitute one of the greatest
dangers incident to heavy gradients; in surmounting inclines freight
trains will, it is found, break in two, and their hinder parts come
thundering down the grade, as was seen at Abergele.The American
passenger trains, in which each car is provided with brakes, are
much less liable than the English, the speed of which is regulated
by brake-vans, to accidents of this description.Indeed, it may be
questioned whether in America any serious disaster has occurred from
the fact that a portion of a passenger train on a road operated by
steam got beyond control in descending an incline.There have been,
however, terrible catastrophes from this cause in England, and that
on the Lancashire & Yorkshire road near Helmshere, a station some
fourteen miles north of Manchester, deserves a prominent place in
the record of railroad accidents.It occurred in the early hours of the morning of the 4th of
September, 1860.There had been a great _fête_ at the Bellevue
Gardens in Manchester on the 3d, upon the conclusion of which some
twenty-five hundred persons crowded at once upon the return trains.Of these there were, on the Lancashire & Yorkshire road, three; the
first consisting of fourteen, the second of thirty-one, and the last
of twenty-four carriages: and they were started, with intervals of
ten minutes between them, at about eleven o'clock at night.The
first train finished its journey in safety.The Helmshere station is at the top of a steep incline.This the second train, drawn by two locomotives, surmounted, and
then stopped for the delivery of passengers.While these were
leaving the carriages, a snap as of fractured iron was heard, and
the guards, looking back, saw the whole rear portion of the train,
consisting of seventeen carriages and a brake-van, detached from
the rest of it and quietly slipping down the incline.The detached
portion was moving so slowly that one of the guards succeeded in
catching the van and applying the brakes; it was, however, already
too late.The velocity was greater than the brake-power could
overcome, and the seventeen carriages kept descending more and
more rapidly.Meanwhile the third train had reached the foot of
the incline and begun to ascend it, when its engineer, on rounding
a curve, caught sight of the descending carriages.He immediately
reversed his engine, but before he could bring his train to a stand
they were upon him.Fortunately the van-brakes of the detached
carriages, though insufficient to stop them, yet did reduce their
speed; the collision nevertheless was terrific.The force of the
blow, so far as the advancing train was concerned, expended itself
on the locomotive, which was demolished, while the passengers
escaped with a fright.With them there was nothing to break the blow, and the two hindmost
carriages were crushed to fragments and their passengers scattered
over the line.It was shortly after midnight, and the excursionists
clambered out of the trains and rushed frantically about, impeding
every effort to clear away the _débris_ and rescue the injured,
whose shrieks and cries were incessant.The bodies of ten persons,
one of whom had died of suffocation, were ultimately taken out from
the wreck, and twenty-two others sustained fractures of limbs.At Des Jardines the couplings were too strong; at Port Jervis and
at Helmshere they were not strong enough; at Carr's Rock they gave
way not a moment too soon."There are objections to a plenum and
there are objections to a vacuum," as Dr.Johnson remarked, "but a
plenum or a vacuum it must be."There are no arguments, however,
in favor of putting railroad stations or sidings upon an inclined
plane, and then not providing what the English call "catch-points"
or "scotches" to prevent such disasters as those at Abergele or
Helmshere.In these two instances alone the want of them cost
over fifty lives.In railroad mechanics there are after all some
principles susceptible of demonstration.That vehicles, as well as
water, will run down hill may be classed among them.That these
principles should still be ignored is hardly less singular than it
is surprising.THE REVERE CATASTROPHE.The terrible disaster which occurred in front of the little
station-building at Revere, six miles from Boston on the Eastern
railroad of Massachusetts, in August 1871, was, properly speaking,
not an accident at all; it was essentially a catastrophe--the
legitimate and almost inevitable final outcome of an antiquated and
insufficient system.As such it should long remain a subject for
prayerful meditation to all those who may at any time be entrusted
with the immediate operating of railroads.It was terribly dramatic,
but it was also frightfully instructive; and while the lesson was by
no means lost, it yet admits of further and advantageous study.For,
like most other men whose lives are devoted to a special calling,
the managers of railroads are apt to be very much wedded to their
own methods, and attention has already more than once been called to
the fact that, when any new emergency necessitates a new appliance,
they not infrequently, as Captain Tyler well put it in his report
to the Board of Trade for the year 1870, "display more ingenuity in
finding objections than in overcoming them."[Illustration: map]

The Eastern railroad of Massachusetts connects Boston with Portland,
in the state of Maine, by a line which is located close along the
sea-shore.Between Boston and Lynn, a distance of eleven miles, the
main road is in large part built across the salt marshes, but there
is a branch which leaves it at Everett, a small station some miles
out of Boston, and thence, running deviously through a succession
of towns on the higher ground, connects with the main track again
at Lynn; thus making what is known in England as a loop-road.At
the time of the Revere accident this branch was equipped with
but a single track, and was operated wholly by schedule without
any reliance on the telegraph; and, indeed, there were not even
telegraphic offices at a number of the stations upon it.Revere,
the name of the station where the accident took place, was on the
main line about five miles from Boston and two miles from Everett,
where the Saugus branch, as the loop-road was called, began.The
accompanying diagram shows the relative position of the several
points and of the main and branch lines, a thorough appreciation of
which is essential to a correct understanding of the disaster.The travel over the Eastern railroad is of a somewhat exceptional
nature, varying in a more than ordinary degree with the different
seasons of the year.During the winter months the corporation had,
in 1871, to provide for a regular passenger movement of about
seventy-five thousand a week, but in the summer what is known
as the excursion and pleasure travel not infrequently increased
the number to one hundred and ten thousand, and even more.As a
natural consequence, during certain weeks of each summer, and more
especially towards the close of August, it was no unusual thing for
the corporation to find itself taxed beyond its utmost resources.It
is emergencies of this description, periodically occurring on every
railroad, which always subject to the final test the organization
and discipline of companies and the capacity of superintendents.A
railroad in quiet times is like a ship in steady weather; almost
anybody can manage the one or sail the other.It is the sudden
stress which reveals the undeveloped strength or the hidden
weakness; and the truly instructive feature in the Revere accident
lay in the amount of hidden weakness everywhere which was brought to
light under that sudden stress.During the week ending with that
Saturday evening upon which the disaster occurred the rolling stock
of the road had been heavily taxed, not only to accommodate the
usual tide of summer travel, then at its full flood, but also those
attending a military muster and two large camp-meetings upon its
line.The number of passengers going over it had accordingly risen
from about one hundred and ten thousand, the full summer average,
to over one hundred and forty thousand; while instead of the one
hundred and fifty-two trains a day provided for in the running
schedule, there were no less than one hundred and ninety-two.It
had never been the custom with those managing the road to place any
reliance upon the telegraph in directing the train movement, and no
use whatever appears to have been made of it towards straightening
out the numerous hitches inevitable from so sudden an increase in
that movement.If an engine broke down, or a train got off the
track, there had accordingly throughout that week been nothing
done, except patient and general waiting, until things got in
motion again; each conductor or station-master had to look out for
himself, under the running regulations of the road, and need expect
no assistance from headquarters.This, too, in spite of the fact
that, including the Saugus branch, no less than ninety-three of the
entire one hundred and fifteen miles of road operated by the company
were supplied only with a single track.The whole train movement,
both of the main line and of the branches, intricate in the extreme
as it was, thus depended solely on a schedule arrangement and the
watchful intelligence of individual employés.Not unnaturally,
therefore, as the week drew to a close the confusion became so
great that the trains reached and left the Boston station with an
almost total disregard of the schedule; while towards the evening
of Saturday the employés of the road at that station directed their
efforts almost exclusively to dispatching trains as fast as cars
could be procured, thus trying to keep it as clear as possible of
the throng of impatient travellers which continually blocked it up.Taken altogether the situation illustrated in a very striking manner
that singular reliance of the corporation on the individuality
and intelligence of its employés, which in another connection is
referred to as one of the most striking characteristics of American
railroad management, without a full appreciation of which it is
impossible to understand its using or failing to use certain
appliances.According to the regular schedule four trains should have left the
Boston station in succession during the hour and a half between 6.30
and eight o'clock P.M.: a Saugus branch train for Lynn at 6.30; a
second Saugus branch train at seven; an accommodation train, which
ran eighteen miles over the main line, at 7.15; and finally the
express train through to Portland, also over the main line, at
eight o'clock.The collision at Revere was between these last two
trains, the express overtaking and running into the rear of the
accommodation train; but it was indirectly caused by the delays
and irregularity in movement of the two branch trains.It will be
noticed that, according to the schedule, both of the branch trains
should have preceded the accommodation train; in the prevailing
confusion, however, the first of the two branch trains did not leave
the station until about seven o'clock, thirty minutes behind its
time, and it was followed forty minutes later, not by the second
branch train, but by the accommodation train, which in its turn was
twenty-five minutes late.Thirteen minutes afterwards the second
Saugus branch train, which should have preceded, followed it, being
nearly an hour out of time.Then at last came the Portland express,
which got away practically on time, at a few minutes after eight
o'clock.All of these four trains went out over the same track as
far as the junction at Everett, but at that point the first and
third of the four were to go off on the branch, while the second and
fourth kept on over the main line.Between these last two trains
the running schedule of the road allowed an ample time-interval of
forty-five minutes, which, however, on this occasion was reduced,
through the delay in starting, to some fifteen or twenty minutes.No causes of further delay, therefore, arising, the simple case
was presented of a slow accommodation train being sent out to run
eighteen miles in advance of a fast express train, with an interval
of twenty minutes between them.Unfortunately, however, the accommodation train was speedily
subjected to another and very serious delay.It has been mentioned
that the Saugus branch was a single track road, and the rules of
the company were explicit that no outward train was to pass onto
the branch at Everett until any inward train then due there should
have arrived and passed off it.There was no siding at the junction,
upon which an outward branch train could be temporarily placed to
wait for the inward train, thus leaving the main track clear; and
accordingly, under a strict construction of the rules, any outward
branch train while awaiting the arrival at Everett of an inward
branch train was to be kept standing on the main track, completely
blocking it.The outward branch trains, it subsequently appeared,
were often delayed at the junction, but no practical difficulty had
arisen from this cause, as the employé in charge of the signals
and switches there, exercising his common sense, had been in the
custom of moving any delayed train temporarily out of the way onto
the branch or the other main track, under protection of a flag,
and thus relieving the block.The need of a siding to permit the
passage of trains at this point had not been felt, simply because
the employé in charge there had used the branch or other main track
as a siding.On the day of the accident this employé happened to be
sick, and absent from his post.His substitute either had no common
sense or did not feel called upon to use it, if its use involved
any increase of responsibility.Accordingly, when a block took
place, the simple letter of the rule was followed;--and it is almost
needless to add that a block did take place on the afternoon of
August 26th.The first of the branch trains, it will be remembered, had left
Boston at about seven o'clock, instead of at 6.30, its schedule
time.On arriving at Everett this train should have met and passed
an inward branch train, which was timed to leave Lynn at six
o'clock, but which, owing to some accident to its locomotive, and
partaking of the general confusion of the day, on this particular
afternoon did not leave the Lynn station until 7.30 o'clock, or one
hour and a half after its schedule time, and one half-hour after
the other train had left Boston.Accordingly, when the Boston train
reached the junction its conductor found himself confronted by the
rule forbidding him to enter upon the branch until the Lynn train
then due should have passed off it, and so he quietly waited on the
outward track of the main line, blocking it completely to traffic.He had not waited long before a special locomotive, on its way from
Boston to Salem, came up and stopped behind him.This was presently
followed by the accommodation train.Then the next branch train came
along, and finally the Portland express.At such a time, and at that
period of railroad development, there was something ludicrous about
the spectacle.Here was a road utterly unable to accommodate its
passengers with cars, while a succession of trains were standing
idle for hours, because a locomotive had broken down ten miles off.The telegraph was there, but the company was not in the custom of
putting any reliance upon it.A simple message to the branch trains
to meet and pass at any point other than that fixed in the schedule
would have solved the whole difficulty; but, no!--there were the
rules, and all the rolling stock of the road might gather at Everett
in solemn procession, but, until the locomotive at Lynn could be
repaired, the law of the Medes and Persians was plain; and in this
case it read that the telegraph was a new-fangled and unreliable
auxiliary.And so the lengthening procession stood there long enough
for the train which caused it to have gone to its destination and
come back dragging the disabled locomotive from Lynn behind it to
again take its place in the block.At last, at about ten minutes after eight o'clock, the long-expected
Lynn train made its appearance, and the first of the branch trains
from Boston immediately went off the main line.The road was now
clear for the accommodation train, which had been standing some
twelve or fifteen minutes in the block, but which from the moment
of again starting was running on the schedule time of the Portland
express.Every minute was vital,
and yet he never thought to look at his watch.He had a vague
impression that he had been delayed some six or eight minutes, when
in reality he had been delayed fifteen; and, though he was running
wholly out of his schedule time, he took not a single precaution, so
persuaded was he that every one knew where he was.The confusion among those in charge of the various engines and
trains was, indeed, general and complete.As the Portland express
was about to leave the Boston station, the superintendent of the
road, knowing by the non-arrival of the branch train from Lynn that
there must be a block at the Everett junction, had directed the
depot-master to caution the engineer to look out for the trains
ahead of him.The order, a merely verbal one, was delivered after
the train had started, the depot-master walking along by the side of
the slowly-moving locomotive, and was either incorrectly transmitted
or not fully understood; the engine-driver supposed it to apply to
the branch train which had started just before him, out of both its
schedule time and schedule place.Presently, at the junction, he was
stopped by the signal man of this train.The course of reasoning he
would then have had to pass through to divine the true situation
of affairs and to guide himself safely under the schedule in the
light of the running rules was complicated indeed, and somewhat as
follows: "The branch train," he should have argued to himself, "is
stopped, and it is stopped because the train which should have left
Lynn at six o'clock has not yet arrived; but, under the rules, that
train should pass off the branch before the 6.30 train could pass
onto it; if, therefore, the 'wild' train before me is delayed not
only the 6.30 but all intermediate trains must likewise be delayed,
and the accommodation train went out this afternoon after the 6.30
train, so it, too, must be in the block ahead of me; unless, indeed,
as is usually the case, the signal-master has got it out of the
block under the protection of a flag."This line of reasoning was,
perhaps, too intricate; at any rate, the engine-driver did not
follow it out, but, when he saw the tail-lights immediately before
him disappear on the branch, he concluded that the main line was
now clear, and dismissed the depot-master's caution from his mind.Meanwhile, as the engine-driver of this train was fully persuaded
that the only other train in his front had gone off on the branch,
the conductor of the accommodation train was equally persuaded that
the head-light immediately behind him in the block at the junction
had been that of the Portland express which consequently should be
aware of his position.Thus when they left Everett the express was fairly chasing the
accommodation train, and overtaking it with terrible rapidity.Even then no collision ought to have been possible.Unfortunately,
however, the road had no system, even the crudest, of interval
signals; and the utter irregularity prevailing in the train
movement seemed to have demoralized the employés along the line,
who, though they noticed the extreme proximity of the two trains
to each other as they passed various points, all sluggishly took
it for granted that those in charge of them were fully aware of
their relative positions and knew what they were about.Thus, as
the two trains approached the Revere station, they were so close
together as to be on the same piece of straight track at the same
time, and a passenger standing at the rear end of the accommodation
train distinctly saw the head-light of the express locomotive.The
night, however, was not a clear one, for an east wind had prevailed
all day, driving a mist in from the sea which lay in banks over
the marshes, lifting at times so that distant objects were quite
visible, and then obscuring them in its heavy folds.Consequently it
did not at all follow, because the powerful reflecting head-light
of the locomotive was visible from the accommodation train, that
the dim tail-lights of the latter were also visible to those on the
locomotive.The tail-lights in use by
the company were ordinary red lanterns without reflecting power.The station house at Revere stood at the end of a tangent, the
track curving directly before it.In any ordinary weather the
tail-lights of a train standing at this station would have been
visible for a very considerable distance down the track in the
direction of Boston, and even on the night of the accident they
were probably visible for a sufficient distance in which to stop
any train approaching at a reasonable rate of speed.Unfortunately
the engineer of the Portland express did not at once see them,
his attention being wholly absorbed in looking for other signals.Certain freight train tracks to points on the shore diverged from
the main line at Revere, and the engine-drivers of all trains
approaching that place were notified by signals at a masthead close
to the station whether the switches were set for the main line or
for these freight tracks.A red lantern at the masthead indicated
that the main line was closed; in the absence of any signal it
was open.In looking for this signal as he approached Revere the
engine-driver of the Portland express was simply attending closely
to his business, for, had the red light been at the masthead, his
train must at once have been stopped.Unfortunately, however, while
peering through the mist at the masthead he overlooked what was
directly before him, until, when at last he brought his eyes down to
the level, to use his own words at the subsequent inquest, "the tail
lights of the accommodation train seemed to spring right up in his
face."When those in charge of the two trains at almost the same moment
became aware of the danger, there was yet an interval of some eight
hundred feet between them.The express train was, however, moving
at a speed of some twenty-five or thirty miles an hour, and was
equipped only with the old-fashioned hand-brake.In response to the
sharply given signal from the whistle these were rapidly set, but
the rails were damp and slippery, so that the wheels failed to catch
upon them, and, when everything was done which could be done, the
eight hundred feet of interval sufficed only to reduce the speed of
the colliding locomotive to about ten miles an hour.In the rear car of the accommodation train there were at the moment
of the accident some sixty-five or seventy human beings, seated
and standing.They were of both sexes and of all ages; for it was
a Saturday evening in August, and many persons had, through the
confusion of the trains, been long delayed in their return from
the city to their homes at the sea-side.The first intimation the
passengers had of the danger impending over them was from the
sudden and lurid illumination of the car by the glare from the
head-light of the approaching locomotive.One of them who survived
the disaster, though grievously injured, described how he was
carelessly watching a young man standing in the aisle, laughing
and gayly chatting with four young girls, who were seated, when he
saw him turn and instantly his face, in the sudden blaze of the
head-light, assumed a look of frozen horror which was the single
thing in the accident indelibly impressed on the survivor's memory;
that look haunted him.The car was crowded to its full capacity, and
the colliding locomotive struck it with such force as to bury itself
two-thirds of its length in it.At the instant of the crash a panic
had seized upon the passengers, and a sort of rush had taken place
to the forward end of the car, into which furniture, fixtures and
human beings were crushed in a shapeless, indistinguishable mass.Meanwhile the blow had swept away the smoke-stack of the locomotive,
and its forward truck had been forced back in some unaccountable way
until it rested between its driving wheels and the tender, leaving
the entire boiler inside of the passenger car and supported on its
rear truck.The valves had been so broken as to admit of the free
escape of the scalding steam, while the coals from the fire-box
were scattered among the _débris_, and coming in contact with the
fluid from the broken car lamps kindled the whole into a rapid
blaze.Neither was the fire confined to the last car of the train.It has been mentioned that in the block at Everett a locomotive
returning to Salem had found itself stopped just in advance of the
accommodation train.At the suggestion of the engine-driver of that
train this locomotive had there coupled on to it, and consequently
made a part of it at Revere.When the collision took place,
therefore, the four cars of which the accommodation train was made
up were crushed between the weight of the entire colliding train on
one side and that of two locomotives on the other.That they were
not wholly demolished was due simply to the fact that the last car
yielded to the blow, and permitted the locomotive of the express
train fairly to imbed itself in it.As it was, the remaining cars
were jammed and shattered, and, though the passengers in them
escaped, the oil from the broken lamps ignited, and before the
flames could be extinguished the cars were entirely destroyed.This accident resulted in the death of twenty-nine persons, and
in more or less severe injuries to fifty-seven others.No person,
not in the last car of the accommodation train was killed, and
one only was seriously injured.Of those in the last car more
than half lost their lives; many instantly by crushing, others by
inhaling the scalding steam which poured forth from the locomotive
boiler into the wreck, and which, where it did not kill, inflicted
frightful injuries.Indeed, for the severity of injuries and for the
protractedness of agony involved in it, this accident has rarely, if
ever, been exceeded.Crushing, scalding and burning did their work
together.It may with perfect truth be said that the disaster at Revere marked
an epoch in the history of railroad development in New England.At
the moment it called forth the deepest expression of horror and
indignation, which, as usual in such cases, was more noticeable for
its force than for its wisdom.An utter absence of all spirit of
justice is, indeed, a usual characteristic of the more immediate
utterances, both from the press and on the platform, upon occasions
of this character.Writers and orators seem always to forget that,
next to the immediate sufferers and their families, the unfortunate
officials concerned are the greatest losers by railroad accidents.For them, not only reputation but bread is involved.A railroad
employé implicated in the occurrence of an accident lives under a
stigma.And yet, from the tenor of public comment it might fairly be
supposed that these officials are in the custom of plotting to bring
disasters about, and take a fiendish delight in them.Nowhere was
this ever illustrated more perfectly than in Massachusetts during
the last days of August and the early days of September, 1871.Grave
men--men who ought to have known better--indulged in language which
would have been simply ludicrous save for the horror of the event
which occasioned but could not justify it.A public meeting, for
instance, was held at the town of Swampscott on the evening of the
Monday succeeding the catastrophe.The gentleman who presided over
it very discreetly, in his preliminary remarks, urged those who
proposed to join in the discussion to control their feelings.Hardly
had he ceased speaking, however, when Mr.Wendell Phillips was
noticed among the audience, and immediately called to the platform.His remarks were a most singular commentary on the chairman's
injunction to calmness.He began by announcing that the first
requisite to the formation of a healthy public opinion in regard
to railroad accidents, as other things, was absolute frankness of
speech, and he then proceeded as follows:--"So I begin by saying
that to my mind this terrible disaster, which has made the last
thirty-six hours so sad to us all, is a deliberate murder.I think
we should try to get rid in the public mind of any real distinction
between the individual who, in a moment of passion or in a moment of
heedlessness, takes the life of one fellow-man, and the corporation
that in a moment of greed, of little trouble, of little expense, of
little care, of little diligence, takes lives by wholesale.I think
the first requisite of the public mind is to say that there is no
accident in the case, properly speaking.It is a murder; the guilt
of murder rests somewhere."Phillip's definition of the crime of "deliberate murder"
would apparently somewhat unsettle the criminal law as at present
understood, but he was not at all alone in this bathos of
extravagance.Prominent gentlemen seemed to vie with each other
in their display of ignorance.B. F. Butler, for instance,
suggested his view of the disaster and the measure best calculated
to prevent a repetition of it; which last was certainly original,
inasmuch as he urged the immediate raising of the pay of all
engine-men until a sufficiently high order of ability and education
should be brought into the occupation to render impossible the
recurrence of an accident which was primarily caused by the
negligence, not of an engineer, but of a conductor.Another
gentleman described with much feeling his observations during a
recent tour in Europe, and declared that such a catastrophe as that
at Revere would have been impossible there.As a matter of fact
the official reports not only showed that the accident was one of
a class of most frequent occurrence, but also that sixty-one cases
of it had occurred in Great Britain alone during the very year the
gentleman in question was journeying in Europe, and had occasioned
over six hundred cases of death or personal injury.Perhaps, in
order to illustrate how very reckless in statement a responsible
gentleman talking under excitement may become, it is worth while to
quote in his own language Captain Tyler's brief description of one
of those sixty-one accidents which "could not possibly," but yet
did, occur."As four London & North-Western excursion trains on September
     2, 1870, were returning from a volunteer review at Penrith,
     the fourth came into collision at Penruddock with the third of
     those trains.An hundred and ten passengers and three servants
     of the company were injured.These trains were partly in charge
     of acting guards, some of whom were entirely inexperienced, as
     well in the line as in their duties; and of engine-drivers and
     firemen, of whom one, at all events, was very much the worse for
     liquor.The side-lamps on the hind van of the third train were
     obscured by a horse-box, which was wider than the van.There
     were no special means of protection to meet the exceptional
     contingency of three such trains all stopping on their way from
     the eastward, to cross two others from the westward, at this
     station.And the regulations for telegraphing the trains were
     altogether neglected."The annals of railroad accidents are full of cases of "rear-end
collision," as it is termed.[11] Their frequency may almost be
accepted as a very accurate gauge of the pressure of traffic on
any given system of lines, and because of them the companies are
continually compelled to adopt new and more intricate systems of
operation.At first, on almost all roads, trains follow each other
at such great intervals that no precaution at all, other than flags
and lanterns, are found necessary.Then comes a succeeding period
when an interval of time between following trains is provided for,
through a system of signals which at given points indicate danger
during a certain number of minutes after the passage of every
train.Then, presently, the alarming frequency of rear collisions
demonstrates the inadequacy of this system, and a new one has to be
devised, which, through the aid of electricity, secures between the
trains an interval of space as well as of time.This last is known
as the "block-system," of which so much has of late years been heard.[11] In the nine years 1870-8, besides those which occurred and
  were not deemed of sufficient importance to demand special inquiry,
  86 cases of accidents of this description were investigated by the
  inspecting officers of the English Board of Trade and reported upon
  in detail.In America, 732 cases were reported as occurring during
  the six years 1874-8, and 138 cases in 1878 alone.The block-system is so important a feature in the modern operation
of railroads, and in its present stage of development it illustrates
so strikingly the difference between the European and the American
methods, that more particular reference will have presently to be
made to it.[12] For the present it is enough to say that rear-end
collisions occur notwithstanding all the precautions implied in a
thoroughly perfected "block-system."There was such a case on the
Metropolitan road, in the very heart of London, on the 29th of
August, 1873.A train was stalled there,
and an unfortunate signal officer in a moment of flurry gave "line
clear" and sent another train directly into it.A much more impressive disaster, both in its dramatic features
and as illustrating the inadequacy of every precaution depending
on human agency to avert accident under certain conditions, was
afforded in the case of a collision which occurred on the London
& Brighton Railway on August 25, 1861; ten years almost to a day
before that at Revere.Like the Eastern railroad, the London
& Brighton enjoyed an enormous passenger traffic, which became
peculiarly heavy during the vacation season towards the close of
August; and it was to the presence of the excursion trains made
necessary to accomodate this traffic that the catastrophes were
in both cases due.In the case of the London & Brighton road it
occurred on a Sunday.An excursion train from Portsmouth on that
day was to leave Brighton at five minutes after eight A. M., and
was to be followed by a regular Sunday excursion train at 8.15 or
ten minutes later, and that again, after the lapse of a quarter of
an hour, by a regular parliamentary train at 8.30.These trains
were certainly timed to run sufficiently near to each other; but,
owing to existing pressure of traffic on the line, they started
almost simultaneously.The Portsmouth excursion, which consisted of
sixteen carriages, was much behind its time, and did not leave the
Brighton station until 8.28; when, after a lapse of three minutes,
it was followed by the regular excursion train at 8.31, and that
again by the parliamentary train at 8.35.Three passenger trains had
thus left the station on one track in seven minutes!The London and
Brighton Railway traverses the chalky downs, for which that portion
of England is noted, through numerous tunnels, the first of which
after leaving Brighton is known as the Patcham Tunnel, about five
hundred yards in length, while two and a half miles farther on is
the Croydon Tunnel, rather more than a mile and a quarter in length.The line between these tunnels was so crooked and obscured that the
managers had adopted extraordinary precautions against accident.At
each end of the Croydon Tunnel a signal-man was stationed, with a
telegraphic apparatus, a clock and a telegraph bell in his station.The rule was absolute that when any train entered the tunnel the
signal-man at the point of entry was to telegraph "train in," and
no other train could follow until the return signal of "train out"
came from the other side.In face of such a regulation it was
difficult to see how any collision in the tunnel was possible.When
the Portsmouth excursion train arrived, it at once entered the
tunnel and the fact was properly signaled to the opposite outlet.Before the return signal that this train was out was received, the
regular excursion train came in sight.It should have been stopped
by a self-acting signal which was placed about a quarter of a mile
from the mouth of the tunnel, and which each passing locomotive set
at "danger," where it remained until shifted to "safety," by the
signal-man, on receipt of the message, "train out."Through some
unexplained cause, the Portsmouth excursion train had failed to act
on this signal, which consequently still indicated safety when the
Brighton excursion train came up.Accordingly the engine-driver
at once passed it, and went on to the tunnel.As he did so, the
signal-man, perceiving some mistake and knowing that he had not yet
got his return signal that the preceding train was out, tried to
stop him by waving his red flag.It was too late, however, and the
train passed in.A moment later the parliamentary train also came
in sight, and stopped at the signal of danger.Now ensued a most
singular misapprehension between the signal-men, resulting in a
terrible disaster.The second train had run into the tunnel and was
supposed by the signal-man to be on its way to the other end of it,
when he received the return message that the first train was out.To this he instantly responded by again telegraphing "train in,"
referring now to the second train.This dispatch the signal-man
at the opposite end conceived to be a repetition of the message
referring to the first train, and he accordingly again replied that
the train was out.This reply, however, the other operator mistook
as referring to the second train, and accordingly he signaled
"safety," and the third train at once got under way and passed into
the tunnel.Unfortunately the engineer of the second train had
seen the red flag waved by the signal-man, and, in obedience to
it, stopped his locomotive as soon as possible in the tunnel and
began to back out of it.In doing so, he drove his train into the
locomotive of the third train advancing into it.The tunnel was
twenty-four feet in height.The engine of the parliamentary train
struck the rear carriage of the excursion train and mounted upon
its fragments, and then on those of the carriage in front of it,
until its smoke-stack came in contact with the roof of the tunnel.The collision had
taken place so far within the tunnel as to be beyond the reach of
daylight, and the wreck of the trains had quite blocked up the arch,
while the steam and smoke from the engines poured forth with loud
sound and in heavy volumes, filling the empty space with stifling
and scalding vapors.When at last assistance came and the trains
could be separated, twenty-three corpses were taken from the ruins,
while one hundred and seventy-six other persons had sustained more
or less severe injuries.A not less extraordinary accident of the same description,
unaccompanied, however, by an equal loss of life, occured on the
Great Northern Railway upon the 10th of June, 1866.In this case
the tube of a locomotive of a freight train burst at about the
centre of the Welwyn Tunnel, some five miles north of Hatfield,
bringing the train to a stand-still.The guard in charge of the
rear of the train failed from some cause to go back and give the
signal for an obstruction, and speedily another freight train from
the Midland road entered and dashed into the rear of the train
already there.Apparently those in charge of these two trains were
in such consternation that they did not think to provide against a
further disaster; at any rate, before measures to that end had been
taken, an additional freight train, this time belonging to the Great
Northern road, came up and plowed into the ruins which already
blocked the tunnel.One of the trains had contained wagons laden
with casks of oil, which speedily became ignited from contact with
the coals scattered from the fire-boxes, and there then ensued one
of the most extraordinary spectacles ever witnessed on a railroad.The tunnel was filled to the summit of its arch and completely
blocked with the wrecked locomotives and wagons.These had ignited,
and the whole cavity, more than a half a mile in length, was
converted into one huge furnace, belching forth smoke and flame with
a loud roaring sound through its several air shafts.So fierce was
the fire that no attempt was made to subdue it, and eighteen hours
elapsed before any steps could be taken towards clearing the track.Strange to say, in this disaster the lives of but two persons were
lost.Rear-end collisions have been less frequent in this country than
in England, for the simple reason that the volume of traffic has
pressed less heavily on the capacity of the lines.Yet here, also,
they have been by no means unknown.In 1865 two occurred, both of
which were accompanied with a considerable loss of life; though,
coming as they did during the exciting scenes which marked the
close of the war of the Rebellion, they attracted much less public
notice than they otherwise would.The first of these took place in
New Jersey on the 7th of March, 1865, just three days after the
second inauguration of President Lincoln.As the express train
from Washington to New York over the Camden & Amboy road was
passing through Bristol, about thirty miles from Philadelphia, at
half-past-two o'clock in the morning, it dashed into the rear of
the twelve o'clock "owl train," from Kensington to New York, which
had been delayed by meeting an oil train on the track before it.The case appears to have been one of very culpable negligence, for,
though the owl train was some two hours late, those in charge of it
seem to have been so deeply engrossed in what was going on before
them that they wholly neglected to guard their rear.The express
train accordingly, approaching around a curve, plunged at a high
rate of speed into the last car, shattering it to pieces; the engine
is even said to have passed completely through that car and to have
imbedded itself in the one before it.It so happened that most of
the sufferers by this accident, numbering about fifty, were soldiers
on their way home from the army upon furlough.The second of the two disasters referred to, occurred on the 16th of
August, 1865, upon the Housatonic road of Connecticut.A new engine
was out upon an experimental trip, and in rounding a curve it ran
into the rear of a passenger train, which, having encountered a
disabled freight train, had coupled on to it and was then backing
down with it to a siding in order to get by.In this case the
impetus was so great that the colliding locomotive utterly destroyed
the rear car of the passenger train and penetrated some distance
into the car preceding it, where its boiler burst.Fortunately
the train was by no means full of passengers; but, even as it was,
eleven persons were killed and some seventeen badly injured.The great peculiarity of the Revere accident, and that which gave
a permanent interest to it, lay in the revelation it afforded of
the degree in which a system had outgrown its appliances.The railroads of New England had
long been living on their early reputation, and now, when a sudden
test was applied, it was found that they were years behind the time.In August, 1871, the Eastern railroad was run as if it were a line
of stage-coaches in the days before the telegraph.Not in one point
alone, but in everything, it broke down under the test.The disaster
was due not to any single cause but to a combination of causes
implicating not only the machinery and appliances in use by the
company, but its discipline and efficiency from the highest official
down to the meanest subordinate.In the first place the capacity of
the road was taxed to the utmost; it was vital, almost, that every
wheel should be kept in motion.Yet, under that very exigency, the
wheels stopped almost as a matter of necessity.How could it be
otherwise?--Here was a crowded line, more than half of which was
equipped with but a single track, in operating which no reliance was
placed upon the telegraph.With trains running out of their schedule
time and out of their schedule place, engineers and conductors were
left to grope their way along as best they could in the light of
rules, the essence of which was that when in doubt they were to
stand stock still.Then, in the absence of the telegraph, a block
occurred almost at the mouth of the terminal station; and there the
trains stood for hours in stupid obedience to a stupid rule, because
the one man who, with a simple regard to the dictates of common
sense, was habitually accustomed to violate it happened to be sick.Trains commonly left a station out of time and out of place; and
the engineer of an express train was sent out to run a gauntlet the
whole length of the road with a simple verbal injunction to look
out for some one before him.Then, at last, when this express train
through all this chaos got to chasing an accommodation train, much
as a hound might course a hare, there was not a pretence of a signal
to indicate the time which had elapsed between the passage of the
two, and employés, lanterns in hand, gaped on in bewilderment at the
awful race, concluding that they could not at any rate do anything
to help matters, but on the whole they were inclined to think that
those most immediately concerned must know what they were about.Finally, even when the disaster was imminent, when deficiency in
organization and discipline had done its worst, its consequences
might yet have been averted through the use of better appliances;
had the one train been equipped with the Westinghouse brake,
already largely in use in other sections of the country, it might
and would have been stopped; or had the other train been provided
with reflecting tail-lights in place of the dim hand-lanterns which
glimmered on its rear platform, it could hardly have failed to make
its proximity known.Any one of a dozen things, every one of which
should have been but was not, ought to have averted the disaster.Obviously its immediate cause was not far to seek.It lay in the
carelessness of a conductor who failed to consult his watch, and
never knew until the crash came that his train was leisurely moving
along on the time of another.Nevertheless, what can be said in
extenuation of a system under which, at this late day, a railroad is
operated on the principle that each employé under all circumstances
can and will take care of himself and of those whose lives and limbs
are entrusted to his care?There is, however, another and far more attractive side to the
picture.The lives sacrificed at Revere were not lost in vain.Seven
complete railroad years passed by between that and the Wollaston
Heights accident of 1878.During that time not less than two hundred
and thirty millions of persons were carried by rail within the
limits of Massachusetts.Of this vast number while only 50, or
about one in each four and a half millions, sustained any injury
from causes beyond their own power to control, the killed were just
two.This certainly was a record with which no community could well
find fault; and it was due more than anything else to the great
disaster of August 26, 1871.More than once, and on more than one
road, accidents occurred which, but for the improved appliances
introduced in consequence of the experience at Revere, could hardly
have failed of fatal results.Not that these appliances were in
all cases very cheerfully or very eagerly accepted.Neither the
Miller platform nor the Westinghouse brake won its way into general
use unchallenged.Indeed, the earnestness and even the indignation
with which presidents and superintendents then protested that their
car construction was better and stronger than Miller's; that their
antiquated handbrakes were the most improved brakes,--better, much
better, than the Westinghouse; that their crude old semaphores and
targets afforded a protection to trains which no block-system would
ever equal,--all this certainly was comical enough, even in the
very shadow of the great tragedy.Men of a certain type always have
protested and will always continue to protest that they have nothing
to learn; yet, under the heavy burden of responsibility, learn
they still do.On this point the figures
of the Massachusetts annual returns between the year 1871 and the
year 1878 speak volumes.At the time of the Revere disaster, with
one single honorable exception,--that of the Boston & Providence
road,--both the atmospheric train-brake and the Miller platform, the
two greatest modern improvements in American car construction, were
practically unrecognized on the railroads of Massachusetts.Even a
year later, but 93 locomotives and 415 cars had been equipped even
with the train-brake.In September, 1873, the number had, however,
risen to 194 locomotives and 709 cars; and another twelve months
carried these numbers up to 313 locomotives and 997 cars.Finally
in 1877 the state commissioners in their report for that year spoke
of the train-brake as having been then generally adopted, and at
the same time called attention to the very noticeable fact "that
the only railroad accident resulting in the death of a passenger
from causes beyond his control within the state during a period of
two years and eight months, was caused by the failure of a company
to adopt this improvement on all its passenger rolling-stock."The adoption of Miller's method of car construction had meanwhile
been hardly less rapid.Almost unknown at the time of the Revere
catastrophe in September, 1871, in October, 1873, when returns on
the subject were first called for by the state commissioners,
eleven companies had already adopted it on 778 cars out of a total
number of 1548 reported.In 1878 it had been adopted by twenty-two
companies, and applied to 1685 cars out of a total of 1792.In other
words it had been brought into general use.THE AUTOMATIC ELECTRIC BLOCK SYSTEM.A realizing sense of the necessity of ultimately adopting some
system of protection against the danger of rear-end collisions was,
above all else, brought directly home to American railroad managers
through the Revere disaster.In discussing and comparing the
appliances used in the practical operation of railroads in different
countries, there is one element, however, which can never be left
out of the account.The intelligence, quickness of perception
and capacity for taking care of themselves--that combination of
qualities which, taken together, constitute individuality and
adaptability to circumstance--vary greatly among the railroad
employés of different countries.The American locomotive engineer,
as he is called, is especially gifted in this way.He can be relied
on to take care of himself and his train under circumstances which
in other countries would be thought to insure disaster.Volumes
on this point were included in the fact that though at the time
of the Revere disaster many of the American lines, especially in
Massachusetts, were crowded with the trains of a mixed traffic,
the necessity of making any provision against rear-end collisions,
further than by directing those in immediate charge of the trains
to keep a sharp look out and to obey their printed orders, seemed
hardly to have occurred to any one.The English block system was
now and then referred to in a vague, general way; but it was very
questionable whether one in ten of those referring to it knew
anything about it or had ever seen it in operation, much less
investigated it.A characteristic illustration of this was afforded
in the course of those official investigations which followed the
Revere disaster, and have already more than once been alluded to.Prior to that disaster the railroads of Massachusetts had, as a
rule, enjoyed a rather exceptional freedom from accidents, and
there was every reason to suppose that their regulations were as
exact and their system as good as those in use in other parts of
the country.Yet it then appeared that in the rules of very few of
the Massachusetts roads had any provision, even of the simplest
character, been made as to the effect of telegraphic orders, or
the course to be pursued by employés in charge of trains on their
receipt.The appliances for securing intervals between following
trains were marked by a quaint simplicity.They were, indeed,
"singularly primitive," as the railroad commissioners on a
subsequent occasion described them, when it appeared that on one of
the principal roads of the state the interval between two closely
following trains was signalled to the engineer of the second train
by a station-master's holding up to him as he passed a number of
fingers corresponding to the number of minutes since the first
train had gone by.For the rest the examination revealed, as the
nearest approach to a block system, a queer collection of dials,
sand-glasses, green flags,  lanterns and hand-targets.The
climax in the course of that investigation was, however, reached
when some reference, involving a description of it, was made to the
English block.This was met by a protest on the part of one veteran
superintendent, who announced that it might work well under certain
circumstances, but for himself he could not be responsible for the
operation of a road running the number of trains he had charge of in
reliance on any such system.The subject, in fact, was one of which
he knew absolutely nothing;--not even that, through the block system
and through it alone, fourteen trains were habitually and safely
moved under circumstances where he moved one.This occurred in 1871,
and though eight years have since elapsed information in regard
to the block system is not yet very widely disseminated inside of
railroad circles, much less outside of them.It is none the less
a necessity of the future.It has got to be understood, and, in
some form, it has got to be adopted; for even in America there are
limits to the reliance which, when the lives and limbs of many are
at stake, can be placed on the "sharp look out" of any class of men,
no matter how intelligent they may be.The block system is of English origin, and it scarcely needs
to be said that it was adopted by the railroad corporations of
that country only when they were driven to it by the exigencies
of their traffic.But for that system, indeed, the most costly
portion of the tracks of the English roads must of necessity have
been duplicated years ago, as their traffic had fairly outgrown
those appliances of safety which have even to this time been found
sufficient in America.There were points, for instance, where two
hundred and seventy regular trains of one line alone passed daily.On the London & North-Western there are more than sixty through
down trains, taking no account of local trains, each day passing
over the same line of tracks, among which are express trains which
stop nowhere, way trains which stop everywhere, express-freight,
way-freight, mineral trains and parcel trains.On the Midland road
there are nearly twice as many similar trains on each track.On the
Metropolitan railway the average interval is three and one-third
minutes between trains.In one case points were mentioned where
270 regular trains of one line alone passed a given junction
during each twenty-four hours,--where 470 trains passed a single
station, the regular interval between them being but five-eighths
of a mile,--where 132 trains entered and left a single station
during three hours of each evening every day, being one train in
eighty-two seconds.In 1870 there daily reached or left the six
stations of the Boston roads some 385 trains; while no less than
650 trains a day were in the same year received and despatched from
a single one of the London stations.On one single exceptional
occasion 1,111 trains, carrying 145,000 persons, were reported as
entering and leaving this station in the space of eighteen hours,
being rather more than a train a minute.Indeed it may well be
questioned whether the world anywhere else furnishes an illustration
so apt and dramatic of the great mechanical achievements of recent
times as that to be seen during the busy hours of any week-day from
the signal and interlocking galleries which span the tracks as
they enter the Charing Cross or Cannon street stations in London.Below and in front of the galleries the trains glide to and fro,
coming suddenly into sight from beyond the bridges and as suddenly
disappearing,--winding swiftly in and out, and at times four of them
running side by side on as many tracks but in both directions,--the
whole making up a swiftly shifting maze of complex movement under
the influence of which a head unaccustomed to the sight grows
actually giddy.Yet it is all done so quietly and smoothly, with
such an absence of haste and nervousness on the part of the stolid
operators in charge, that it is not easy to decide which most to
wonder at, the almost inconceivable magnitude and despatch of the
train-movement or the perfection of the appliances which make it
possible.No man concerned in the larger management of railroads,
who has not passed a morning in those London galleries, knows what
it is to handle a great city's traffic.Perfect as it is in its way, however, it may well be questioned
whether the block system as developed in England is likely to
be generally adopted on American railroads.Upon one or two of
them, and notably on the New Jersey Central and a division of the
Pennsylvania, it has already been in use for a number of years.From an American point of view, however, it is open to a number
of objections.That in itself it is very perfect and has been
successfully elaborated so as to provide for almost every possible
contingency is proved by the results daily accomplished by means of
it.[13] The English lines are made to do an incredible amount of
work with comparative few accidents.The block system is, however,
none the less a very clumsy and complicated one, necessitating the
constant employment of a large number of skilled operators.Here
is the great defect in it from the American point of view.In this
country labor is scarce and capital costly.The effort is always
towards the perfecting of labor-saving machines.Hitherto the
pressure of traffic on the lines has not been greater than could
be fairly controlled by simpler appliances, and the expense of the
English system is so heavy that its adoption, except partially,
would not have been warranted.As Barry says in his treatise on the
subject, "one can 'buy gold too dear'; for if every possible known
precaution is to be taken, regardless of cost, it may not pay to
work a railway at all."[13] An excellent popular description of this system will be found
  in Barry's _Railway Appliances, Chapter V_.It is tolerably safe, therefore, to predict that the American
block system of the future will be essentially different from the
present English system.The basis--electricity--will of course be
the same; but, while the operator is everywhere in the English
block, his place will be supplied to the utmost possible degree by
automatic action in the American.It is in this direction that the
whole movement since the Revere disaster has been going on, and
the advance has been very great.From peculiarities of condition
also the American block must be made to cover a multitude of weak
points in the operation of roads, and give timely notice of dangers
against which the English block provides only to a limited degree,
and always through the presence of yet other employés.For instance,
as will presently be seen, many more accidents and, in Europe even,
far greater loss of life is caused by locomotives coming in contact
with vehicles at points where highways cross railroad tracks at a
level therewith than by rear-end collisions; meanwhile throughout
America, even in the most crowded suburban neighborhoods, these
crossings are the rule, whereas in Europe they are the exception.The English block affords protection against this danger by giving
electric notice to gatemen; but gatemen are always supposed.So
also as respects the movements of passengers in and about stations
in crossing tracks as they come to or leave the trains, or prepare
to take their places in them.The rule in Europe is that passenger
crossings at local stations are provided over or under the tracks;
in America, however, almost nowhere is any provision at all made,
but passengers, men, women and children, are left to scramble across
tracks as best they can in the face of passing trains.They are
expected to take care of themselves, and the success with which they
do it is most astonishing.Having been brought up to this self-care
all their lives, they do not, as would naturally be supposed, become
confused and stumble under the wheels of locomotives; and the
statistics seem to show that no more accidents from this cause occur
in America than in Europe.Nevertheless some provision is manifestly
desirable to notify employés as well as passengers that trains are
approaching, especially where way-stations are situated on curves.Again, it is well known that, next to collisions, the greatest
source of danger to railroad trains is due to broken tracks.It
is, of course, apparent that tracks may at any time be broken by
accident, as by earth-slides, derailment or the fracture of rails.This danger has to be otherwise provided for; the block has nothing
to do with it further than to prevent a train delayed by any such
break from being run into by any following train.The broken track
which the perfect block should give notice of is that where the
break is a necessary incident to the regular operation of the road.It is these breaks which, both in America and elsewhere, are the
fruitful source of the great majority of railroad accidents, and
draw-bridges and switches, or facing points as they are termed in
the English reports, are most prominent among them.Wherever there
is a switch, the chances are that in the course of time there will
be an accident.Four matters connected with train movement have now been specified,
in regard to which some provision is either necessary or highly
desirable: these are rear collisions, tracks broken at draw-bridges
or at switches, highway grade crossings, and the notification of
agents and passengers at stations.The effort in America, somewhat
in advance of that crowded condition of the lines which makes the
adoption of something a measure of present necessity, has been
directed towards the invention of an automatic system which at
one and the same time should cover all the dangers and provide
for all the needs which have been referred to, eliminating the
risks incident to human forgetfulness, drowsiness and weakness of
nerves.Can reliable automatic provision thus be made?--The English
authorities are of opinion that it cannot.They insist that "if
automatic arrangements be adopted, however suitable they may be to
the duties which they have to perform, they should in all cases be
used as additions to, and not as substitutions for, safety machinery
worked by competent signal-men.The signal-man should be bound to
exercise his observation, care and judgment, and to act thereon; and
the machine, as far as possible, be such that if he attempts to go
wrong it shall check him."It certainly cannot be said that the American electrician has as
yet demonstrated the incorrectness of this conclusion, but he has
undoubtedly made a good deal of progress in that direction.Of the
various automatic blocks which have now been experimented with or
brought into practice, the Hall Electric and the Union Safety Signal
Company systems have been developed to a very marked degree of
perfection.They depend for their working on diametrically opposite
principles: the Hall signals being worked by means of an electric
circuit caused by the action of wheels moving on the rails, and
conveyed through the usual medium of wires; while, under the other
system, the wires being wholly dispensed with, a continuous electric
circuit is kept up by means of the rails, which are connected
for the purpose, and the signals are then acted upon through the
breaking of this normal circuit by the movement of locomotives and
cars.So far as the signals are concerned, there is no essential
difference between the two systems, except that Hall supplies the
necessary motive force by the direct action of electricity, while in
the other case dependence is placed upon suspended weights.Of the
two the Hall system is the oldest and most thoroughly elaborated,
having been compelled to pass through that long and useful tentative
process common to all inventions, during which they are regarded
as of doubtful utility and are gradually developed through a
succession of partial failures.So far as Hall's system is concerned
this period may now fairly be regarded as over, for it is in
established use on a number of the more crowded roads of the North,
and especially of New England, while the imperfections necessarily
incident to the development of an appliance at once so delicate and
so complicated, have for certain purposes been clearly overcome.Its signal arrangements, for instance, to protect draw-bridges,
stations and grade-crossings are wholly distinct from its block
system, through which it provides against dangers from collision and
broken tracks.So far as draw-bridges are concerned, the protection
it affords is perfect.Not only is its interlocking apparatus so
designed that the opening of the draw blocks all approach to it,
but the signals are also reciprocal; and if through carelessness or
automatic derangement any train passes the block, the draw-tender is
notified at once of the fact in ample time to stop it.In the case of a highway crossing at a level, the electric bell
under Hall's system is placed at the crossing, giving notice of
the approaching train from the moment it is within half a mile
until it passes; so that, where this appliance is in use, accidents
can happen only through the gross carelessness of those using the
highway.When the electric bell is silent there is no train within
half a mile and the crossing is safe; it is not safe while the bell
is ringing.As it now stands the law usually provides that the
prescribed signals, either bell or whistle, shall be given from the
locomotive as it approaches the highway, and at a fixed distance
from it.The signal, therefore, is given at a distance of several
hundred yards, more or less, from the point of danger.The electric
system improves on this by placing the signal directly at the point
of danger,--the traveller approaches the bell, instead of the bell
approaching the traveller.At any point of crossing which is really
dangerous,--that is at any crossing where trees or cuttings or
buildings mask the railroad from the highway,--this distinction is
vital.In the one case notice of the unseen danger must be given
and cannot be unobserved; in the other case whether it is really
given or not may depend on the condition of the atmosphere or the
direction of the wind.Usually, however, in New England the level crossings of the more
crowded thoroughfares, perhaps one in ten of the whole number, are
protected by gates or flag-men.Under similar circumstances in
Great Britain there is an electric connection between a bell in the
cabin of the gate-keeper and the nearest signal boxes of the block
system on each side of the crossing, so that due notice is given of
the approach of trains from either direction.In this country it has
heretofore been the custom to warn gate-keepers by the locomotive
whistle, to the intense annoyance of all persons dwelling near the
crossing, or to make them depend for notice on their own eyes.Under
the Hall system, however, the gate-keeper is automatically signalled
to be on the look out, if he is attending to his duty; or, if he is
neglecting it, the electric bell in some degree supplies his place,
without releasing the corporation from its liability.In America
the heavy fogs of England are almost unknown, and the brilliant
head lights, heavy bells and shrill high whistles in use on the
locomotives would at night, it might be supposed, give ample notice
to the most careless of an approaching train.Continually recurring
experience shows, however, that this is not the case.Under these
circumstances the electric bell at the crossing becomes not only a
matter of justice almost to the employé who is stationed there, but
a watchman over him.This, however, like the other forms of signals which have been
referred to, is, in the electric system, a mere adjunct of its chief
use, which is the block,--they are all as it were things thrown
into the bargain.As contradistinguished from the English block,
which insures only an unoccupied track, the automatic blocks seek to
insure an unbroken track as well,--that is not only is each segment
into which a road is divided, protected as respects following trains
by, in the case of Hall's system, double signals watching over each
other, the one at safety, the other at danger,--both having to
combine to open the block,--but every switch or facing point, the
throwing of which may break the main track, is also protected.The
Union Signal Company's system it is claimed goes still further than
this and indicates any break in the track, though due to accidental
fracture or displacement of rails.Without attempting this the Hall
system has one other important feature in common with the English
block, and a very important feature, that of enabling station agents
in case of sudden emergency to control the train movement within
half a mile or more of their stations on either side.Within the
given distance they can stop trains either leaving or approaching.The inability to do this has been the cause of some of the most
disastrous collisions on record, and notably those at Revere and at
Thorpe.The one essential thing, however, in every perfect block system,
whether automatic or worked by operators, is that in case of
accident or derangement or doubt, the signal should rest at danger.This the Hall system now fully provides for, and in case even of
the wilful displacement of a switch, an occurrence by no means
without precedent in railroad experience, the danger signal could
not but be displayed, even though the electric connection had been
tampered with.Accidents due to wilfullness, however, can hardly
be provided for except by police precautions.Train wrecking is
not to be taken into account as a danger incident to the ordinary
operation of a railroad.Carelessness or momentary inadvertence,
or, most dangerous of all, that recklessness--that unnecessary
assumption of risk somewhere or at some time, which is almost
inseparable from a long immunity from disaster--these are the
great sources of peril most carefully to be guarded against.The
complicated and unceasing train movement depends upon many thousand
employés, all of whom make mistakes or assume risks sometimes;--and
did they not do so they would be either more or less than men.Being, however, neither angels nor machines, but ordinary mortals
whose services are bought for money at the average market rate of
wages, it would certainly seem no small point gained if an automatic
machine could be placed on guard over those whom it is the great
effort of railroad discipline to reduce to automatons.Could this
result be attained, the unintentional throwing of a lever or the
carelessness which leaves it thrown, would simply block the track
instead of leaving it broken.An example of this, and at the same
time a most forcible illustration of the possible cost of a small
economy in the application of a safeguard, was furnished in the
case of the Wollaston disaster.At the time of that disaster, the
Old Colony railroad had for several years been partially equipped
on the portion of its track near Boston, upon which the accident
occurred, with Hall's system.It had worked smoothly and easily, was
well understood by the employés, and the company was sufficiently
satisfied with it to have even then made arrangements for its
extension.Unfortunately, with a too careful eye to the expenditure
involved, the line had been but partially equipped; points where
little danger was apprehended had not been protected.Among these
was the "Foundry switch," so called, near Wollaston.Had this switch
been connected with the system and covered by a signal-target, the
mere act of throwing it would have automatically blocked the track,
and only when it was re-set would the track have been opened.The
switch was not connected, the train hands were recklessly careless,
and so a trifling economy cost in one unguarded moment some fifty
persons life and limb, and the corporation more than $300,000.One objection to the automatic block is generally based upon the
delicacy and complicated character of the machinery on which its
action necessarily depends; and this objection is especially urged
against those other portions of the Hall system, covering draws
and level crossings, which have been particularly described.It
is argued that it is always liable to get out of order from a
great multiplicity of causes, some of which are very difficult to
guard against, and that it is sure to get out of order during any
electric disturbance; but it is during storms that accidents are
most likely to occur, and especially is this the case at highway
grade-crossings.It is comparatively easy to avoid accidents so long
as the skies are clear and the elements quiet; but it is exactly
when this is not the case and when it becomes necessary to use every
precaution, that electricity as a safeguard fails or runs mad, and,
by participating in the general confusion, proves itself worse
than nothing.Then it will be found that those in charge of trains
and tracks, who have been educated into a reliance upon it under
ordinary circumstances, will from force of habit, if nothing else,
go on relying upon it, and disaster will surely follow.This line of reasoning is plausible, but none the less open to
one serious objection; it is sustained neither by statistics nor
by practical experience.Moreover it is not new, for, slightly
varied in phraseology, it has been persistently urged against the
introduction of every new railroad appliance, and, indeed, was first
and most persistently of all urged against the introduction of
railroads themselves.Pretty and ingenious in theory, practically it
is not feasible!--for more than half a century this formula has been
heard.That the automatic electric signal system is complicated,
and in many of its parts of most delicate construction, is
undeniable.In point of fact the whole
railroad organization from beginning to end--from machine-shop to
train-movement--is at once so vast and complicated, so delicate
in that action which goes on with such velocity and power, that
it is small cause for wonder that in the beginning all plain,
sensible, practical men scouted it as the fanciful creation of
visionaries.They were wholly justified in so doing; and to-day
any sane man would of course pronounce the combined safety and
rapidity of ordinary railroad movement an utter impossibility, did
he not see it going on before his eyes.So it is with each new
appliance.It is ever suggested that at last the final result has
already been reached.It is but a few years, as will presently be
seen, since the Westinghouse brake encountered the old "pretty and
ingenious" formula.Going yet a step further, and taking the case
of electricity itself, the bold conception of operating an entire
line of single track road wholly as respects one half of its train
movement by telegraph, and without the use of any time table at
all, would once have been condemned as mad.Yet to-day half of the
vast freight movement of this continent is carried on in absolute
reliance on the telegraph.Nevertheless it is still not uncommon
to hear among the class of men who rise to the height of their
capacity in themselves being automaton superintendents that they do
not believe in deviating from their time tables and printed rules;
that, acting under them, the men know or ought to know exactly what
to do, and any interference by a train despatcher only relieves them
of responsibility, and is more likely to lead to accidents than if
they were left alone to grope their own way out.Another and very similar argument frequently urged against the
electric, in common with all other block systems by the large class
who prefer to exercise their ingenuity in finding objections rather
than in overcoming difficulties, is that they breed dependence and
carelessness in employés;--that engine-drivers accustomed to rely
on the signals, rely on them implicitly, and get into habits of
recklessness which lead inevitably to accidents, for which they
then contend the signals, and not they themselves, are responsible.This argument is, indeed, hardly less familiar than the "pretty and
ingenious" formula just referred to.It has, however, been met and
disposed of by Captain Tyler in his annual reports to the Board of
Trade in a way which can hardly be improved upon:--

     It is a favorite argument with those who oppose the introduction
     of some of these improvements, or who make excuses for the want
     of them, that their servants are apt to become more careless
     from the use of them, in consequence of the extra security which
     they are believed to afford; and it is desirable to consider
     seriously how much of truth there is in this assertion.* * *
     Allowing to the utmost for these tendencies to confide too
     much in additional means of safety, the risk is proved by
     experience to be very much greater without them than with them;
     and, in fact, the negligence and mistakes of servants are found
     to occur most frequently, and generally with the most serious
     results, not when the men are over-confident in their appliances
     or apparatus, but when, in the absence of them, they are
     habituated to risk in the conduct of the traffic.In the daily
     practice of railway working station-masters, porters, signalmen,
     engine-drivers or guards are frequently placed in difficulties
     which they have to surmount as best they can.The more they are
     accustomed to incur risk in order to perform their duties, the
     less they think of it, and the more difficult it is to enforce
     discipline and obedience to regulations.The personal risk which
     is encountered by certain classes of railway servants is coming
     to be more precisely ascertained.It is very considerable;
     and it is difficult to prevent men who are in constant danger
     themselves from doing things which may be a source of danger to
     others, or to compel them to obey regulations for which they do
     not see altogether the necessity, and which impede them in their
     work.This difficulty increases with the want of necessary means
     and appliances; and is diminished when, with proper means and
     appliances, stricter discipline becomes possible, safer modes
     of working become habitual, and a higher margin of safety is
     constantly preserved.[14]

  [14] Reports; 1872, page 23, and 1873, page 39.In Great Britain the ingenious theory that superior appliances
or greater personal comfort in some indefinable way lead to
carelessness in employés was carried to such an extent that only
within the last few years has any protection against wind, rain and
sunshine been furnished on locomotives for the engine-drivers and
stokers.The old stage-coach driver faced the elements, and why
should not his successor on the locomotive do the same?--If made too
comfortable, he would become careless and go to sleep!--This was the
line of argument advanced, and the tortures to which the wretched
men were subjected in consequence of it led to their fortifying
nature by drink.They had to be regularly inspected and examined
before mounting the foot-board, to see that they were sober.It took
years in Great Britain for intelligent railroad managers to learn
that the more protected and comfortable a man is the better he will
attend to his duty.And even when the old argument, refuted by long
experience, was at last abandoned as respected the locomotive cab,
it, with perfect freshness and confidence in its own novelty and
force, promptly showed its brutal visage in opposition to the next
new safeguard.For the reasons which Captain Tyler has so forcibly put in the
extracts which have just been quoted, the argument against the block
system from the increased carelessness of employés, supposed to be
induced by it, is entitled to no weight.Neither is the argument
from the delicacy and complication of the automatic, electric signal
system entitled to any more, when urged against that.Not only has
it been too often refuted under similar conditions by practical
results, but in this case it is based on certain assumptions of
fact which are wholly opposed to experience.The record does not
show that there is any peculiar liability to railroad accidents
during periods of storm; perhaps because those in charge of train
movements or persons crossing tracks are under such circumstances
more especially on the look out for danger.On the contrary the
full average of accidents of the worst description appear to
have occurred under the most ordinary conditions of weather, and
usually in the most unanticipated way.This is peculiarly true of
accidents at highway grade crossings.These commonly occur when the
conditions are such as to cause the highway travelers to suppose
that, if any danger existed, they could not but be aware of it.In the next place, the question in regard to automatic electric
signals is exactly what it was in regard to the Westinghouse brake,
with its air-pump, its valves and connecting tubes;--it is the
purely practical question,--Does the thing work?--The burden of
proof is properly on the inventor.In the case of the electric signals they have for years been
in limited but constant use, and while thus in use they have been
undergoing steady improvement.Though now brought to a considerable
degree of comparative perfection they are, of course, still in
their earlier stage of development.In use, however, they have not
been found open to the practical objections urged against them.At
first much too complicated and expensive, requiring more machinery
than could by any reasonable exertions be kept in order and more
care than they were worth, they have now been simplified until a
single battery properly located can do all the necessary work for
a road of indefinite length.As a system they are effective and do
not lead to accidents; nor are they any more subject than telegraph
wires to derangement from atmospheric causes.When any disturbance
does take place, until it can be overcome it amounts simply to a
general signal for operating the road with extreme caution.But with
railroads, as everywhere else in life, it is the normal condition of
affairs for which provision must be made, while the dangers incident
to exceptional circumstances must be met by exceptional precautions.As long as things are in their normal state, that is, probably,
during nineteen days out of twenty, the electric signals have now
through several years of constant trial proved themselves a reliable
safeguard.It can hardly admit of doubt that in the near future they
will be both further perfected and generally adopted.In their management of switches, especially at points of railroad
convergence where a heavy traffic is concentrated and the passage
of trains or movement of cars and locomotives is unceasing,
the English are immeasurably in advance of the Americans; and,
indeed, of all other people.In fact, in this respect the American
managers have shown themselves slow to learn, and have evinced an
indisposition to adopt labor-saving appliances which, considering
their usual quickness of discernment in that regard, is at first
sight inexplicable.Having always been accustomed to the old and
simple methods, just so long as they can through those methods
handle their traffic with a bearable degree of inconvenience and
expense, they will continue to do so.That their present method is
most extravagant, just as extravagant as it would be to rent two
houses or to run two steam engines where one, if properly used,
could be made to suffice, admits of demonstration;--but the waste is
not on the surface, and the necessity for economy is not imperative.The difference of conditions and the difference in results may be
made very obvious by a comparison.Take, for instance, London and
Boston--the Cannon street station in the one and the Beach street
station in the other.The concentration of traffic at London is so
great that it becomes necessary to utilize every foot of ground
devoted to railroad purposes to the utmost possible extent.Not
only must it be packed with tracks, but those tracks must never be
idle.The incessant train movement at Cannon street has already
been referred to as probably the most extraordinary and confusing
spectacle in the whole wide circle of railroad wonders.The result
is that in some way, at this one station and under this single roof,
more trains must daily be made to enter and leave than enter and
leave, not only the Beach street station, but all the eight railroad
stations in Boston combined.[15]

  [15] "It has been estimated that an average of 50,000 persons were,
  in 1869, daily brought into Boston and carried from it, on three
  hundred and eighty-five trains, while the South Eastern railway of
  London received and despatched in 1870, on an average, six hundred
  and fifty trains a day, between 6 A.M.carrying from
  35,000 to 40,000 persons, and this too without the occurrence of a
  single train accident during the year.On one single exceptional
  day eleven hundred and eleven trains, carrying 145,000 persons, are
  said to have entered and left this station in the space of eighteen
  hours."--_Third Annual Report, [1872] of Massachusetts Railroad
  Commissioners, p.141._

  The passenger movement over the roads terminating in Boston was
  probably as heavy on June 17, 1875, as during any twenty-four hours
  in their history.It was returned at 280,000 persons carried in
  641 trains.About twice the passenger movement of the "exceptional
  day" referred to, carried in something more than half the number of
  trains, entering and leaving eight stations instead of one.During eighteen successive hours trains have been made to enter and
leave this station at the rate of more than one in each minute.It
contains four platforms and seven tracks, the longest of which is
720 feet.As compared with the largest station in Boston (the Boston
& Providence), it has the same number of platforms and an aggregate
of 1,500 (three-fifths) more feet of track under cover; it daily
accommodates about nine times as many trains and four times as many
passengers.Of it Barry, in his treatise on Railway Appliances (p.197), says: "The platform area at this station is probably minimised
but, the station accommodates efficiently a very large mixed traffic
of long and short journey trains, amounting at times to as many as
400 trains in and 400 trains out in a working day.[16]"

  [16] The Grand Central Depot on 42d Street in New York City, has
  nearly twice the amount of track room under cover of the Cannon
  street station.The daily train movement of the latter would be
  precisely paralleled in New York, though not equalled in amount, if
  the 42d street station were at Trinity church, and, in addition to
  the trains which now enter and leave it, all the city trains of the
  Elevated road were also provided for there.The American system is, therefore, one of great waste; for, being
conducted in the way it is--that is with stations and tracks
utilized to but a fractional part of their utmost capacity--it
requires a large number of stations and tracks and the services of
many employés.Indeed it is safe to say that, judged by the London
standard, not more than two of the eight stations in Boston are at
this time utilized to above a quarter part of their full working
capacity; and the same is probably true of all other American
cities.Both employés and the travelling public are accustomed to a
slow movement and abundance of room; land is comparatively cheap,
and the pressure of concentration has only just begun to make itself
felt.Accordingly any person, who cares to pass an hour during the
busy time of day in front of an American city station, cannot but
be struck, while watching the constant movement, with the primitive
way in which it is conducted.Here are a multiplicity of tracks all
connected with each other, and cars and locomotives are being passed
from one to another from morning to night.A constant shifting
of switches is going on, and the little shunting engines never
stand still.The switches, however, as a rule, are unprovided with
signals, except of the crudest description; they have no connection
with each other, and during thirty years no change has been made
in the method in which they are worked.When one of them has to be
shifted, a man goes to it and shifts it.To facilitate the process,
the monitor shunting engines are provided with a foot-board in front
and behind, just above the track, upon which the yard hands jump,
and are carried about from switch to switch, thus saving the time
they would occupy if they had to walk.A simpler arrangement could
not be imagined; anyone could devise it.The only wonder is that
even a considerable traffic can be conducted safely in reliance upon
it.Turning from Beach to Cannon street, it is apparent that the
train movement which has there to be accommodated would fall into
inextricable confusion if it was attempted to manage it in the way
which has been described.The number of trains is so great and
the movement so rapid and intricate, that not even a regiment of
employés stationed here and there at the signals and switches could
keep things in motion.From time to time they would block, and then
the whole vast machine would be brought to a standstill until order
could be re-established.The difficulty is overcome in a very simple
way, by means of an equally simple apparatus.The control over
the numerous switches and corresponding signals, instead of being
divided up among many men stationed at many points, is concentrated
in the hands of two men occupying a single gallery, which is
elevated across the tracks in front of the station and commanding
the approaches to it, much as the pilot-house of an American steamer
commands a view of the course before it.From this gallery, by means
of what is known as the interlocking system, every switch and signal
in the yard below is moved; and to such a point of perfection has
the apparatus been carried, that any disaster from the misplacement
of a switch or the display of a wrong signal is rendered impossible.Of this Cannon street apparatus Barry says, "there are here nearly
seventy point and signal levers concentrated in one signal house;
the number of combinations which would be possible if all the
signal and point levers were not interlocked can be expressed only
by millions.Of these only 808 combinations are safe, and by the
interlocking apparatus these 808 combinations are rendered possible,
and all the others impossible."[17]

  [17] _Railway Appliances_, p.It is not proposed to enter at any length into the mechanical
details of this appliance, which, however, must be considered as one
of the three or four great inventions which have marked epochs in
the history of railroad traffic.[18] As, however, it is but little
known in America, and will inevitably within the next few years find
here the widest field for its increased use, a slight sketch of its
gradual development and of its leading mechanical features may not
be out of place.Prior to the year 1846 the switches and signals
on the English roads were worked in the same way that they are now
commonly worked in this country.As a train drew near to a junction,
for instance, the switchman stationed there made the proper track
connection and then displayed the signal which indicated what tracks
were opened and what closed, and which line had the right of way;
and the engine-drivers acted accordingly.As the number of trains
increased and the movement at the junctions became more complicated,
the danger of the wrong switches being thrown or the wrong signals
displayed, increased also.Mistakes from time to time would happen,
even when only the most careful and experienced men were employed;
and mistakes in these matters led to serious consequences.It,
therefore, became the practice, instead of having the switch or
signal lever at the point where the switch or signal itself was, as
is still almost universally the case in this country, to connect
them by rods or wires with their levers, which were concentrated
at some convenient point for working, and placed under the control
of one man instead of several.So far as it went this change was
an improvement, but no provision yet existed against the danger of
mistake in throwing switches and displaying signals.The blunder of
first making one combination of tracks and then showing the signal
for another was less liable to happen after the concentration of
the levers under one hand than before, but it still might happen at
any time, and certainly would happen at some time.If all danger of
accident from human fallibility was ever to be eliminated a far more
complicated mechanical apparatus must be devised.In response to
this need the system of interlocking was gradually developed, though
not until about the year 1856 was it brought to any considerable
degree of perfection.The whole object of this system is to
render it impossible for a switchman, whether because he is weary
or agitated or actually malicious or only inexperienced, to give
contrary signals, or to break his line in one way and to give the
signal for its being broken in another way.To bring this about the
levers are concentrated in a cabin or gallery, and placed side by
side in a frame, their lower ends connecting with the switch-points
and signals by means of rods and wires.Beneath this frame are one
or more long bars, extending its entire length under it and parallel
with it.These are called locking bars; for, being moved to the
right or left by the action of the levers they hold these levers in
certain designated positions, nor do they permit them to occupy any
other.In this way what is termed the interlocking is effected.The
apparatus, though complicated, is simplicity itself compared with
a clock or a locomotive.The complication, also, such as it is,
arises from the fact that each situation is a problem by itself, and
as such has to be studied out and provided for separately.This,
however, is a difficulty affecting the manufacturer rather than the
operator.To the latter the apparatus presents no difficulty which
a fairly intelligent mechanic cannot easily master; while for the
former the highly complicated nature of the problem may, perhaps,
best be inferred from the example given by Mr.Barry, the simplest
that can offer, that of an ordinary junction where a double-track
branch-road connects with its double-track main line.There would
in this case be of necessity two switch levers and four signal
levers, which would admit of sixty-four possible combinations."The
signal might be arranged in any of sixteen ways, and the points
might occupy any of four positions, irrespective of the position
of the signals.Of the sixty-four combinations thus possible
only thirteen are safe, and the rest are such as might lure an
engine-driver into danger."[18] A sufficiently popular description of this apparatus also,
  illustrated by cuts, will be found in Barry's excellent little
  treatise on _Railway Appliances_, already referred to, published by
  Longmans & Co.as one of their series of text-books of science.Originally the locking bar was worked through the direct action of
certain locks, as they were called, between which the levers when
moved played to and fro.These locks were mere bars or plates of
iron, some with inclined sides, and others with sides indented or
notched.At one end they were secured on a pivot to a fixed bar
opposite to and parallel with the movable locking bar, while their
other ends were made fast to the locking bar; whence it necessarily
followed that, as certain of the levers were pushed to and fro
between them, the action of these levers on the inclined sides of
the locks could by a skilful combination be made to throw other
levers into the notches and indentations of other locks, thus
securing them in certain positions, and making it impossible for
them to be in any other positions.The apparatus which has been described, though a great improvement
on anything which had preceded it, was still but a clumsy affair,
and naturally the friction of the levers on the locks was so great
that they soon became worn, and when worn they could not be relied
upon to move the switch-points with the necessary accuracy.The new
appliance of safety had, therefore, as is often the case, introduced
a new and very considerable danger of its own.The signals and
switches, it was true, could no longer disagree, but the points
themselves were sometimes not properly set, or, owing to the great
exertion required to work it, the interlocking gear was strained.This difficulty resulted in the next and last improvement, which
was a genuine triumph of mechanical ingenuity.To insure the proper
length of stroke being made in moving the lever--that is to make
it certain in each case that the switch points were brought into
exactly the proper position--two notches were provided in the slot,
or quadrant, as it is called, in which the lever moved, and, when
it was thrown squarely home, and not until then, a spring catch
caught in one or other of these notches.This spring was worked by
a clasp at the handle of the lever, and the whole was called the
spring catch-rod.By a singularly ingenious contrivance, the process
of interlocking was transferred from the action of the levers and
the keys to these spring catch-rods, which were made to work upon
each other, and thus to become the medium through which the whole
process is effected.The result of this improvement was that, as
the switchman cannot move any lever until the spring-catch rod is
fastened, except for a particular movement, he cannot, do what he
will, even begin any other movement than that one, as the levers
cannot be started.On the other hand, it may be said that, by means
of this improvement, the mere "intention of the signal-man to move
any lever, expressed by his grasping the lever and so raising the
spring catch-rod, independently of his putting his intention in
force, actuates all the necessary locking.[19]"

  [19] In regard to the interlocking system as then in use in England,
  Captain Tyler in his report as head of the railway inspecting
  department of the Board of Trade, used the following language in
  his report on the accidents during 1870."When the apparatus is
  properly constructed and efficiently maintained, the signalman
  cannot make a mistake in the working of his points and signals which
  shall lead to accident or collision, except only by first lowering
  his signal and switching his train forward, then putting up his
  signal again as it approaches, and altering the points as the driver
  comes up to, or while he is passing over them.Such a mistake was
  actually made in one of the cases above quoted.It is, of course,
  impossible to provide completely for cases of this description; but
  the locking apparatus, as now applied, is already of enormous value
  in preventing accidents; and it will have a still greater effect
  on the general safety of railway travelling as it becomes more
  extensively applied on the older lines.Without it, a signalman in
  constantly working points and signals is almost certain sooner or
  later to make a mistake, and to cause an accident of a more or less
  serious character; and it is inexcusable in any railway company to
  allow its mail or express trains to run at high speed through facing
  points which are not interlocked efficiently with the signals, by
  which alone the engine-drivers in approaching them can be guided.There is however, very much yet to be effected in different parts of
  the country in this respect.And it is worth while to record here,
  in illustration of the difficulties that are sometimes met with by
  the inspecting officers, that the Midland Railway Company formally
  protested in June, 1866, against being compelled to apply such
  apparatus before receiving sanction for the opening of new lines
  of railway.They stated that in complying with the requirements in
  this respect of the Board of Trade, they '_were acting in direct
  opposition to their own convictions, and they must, so far as lay in
  their power, decline the responsibility of the locking system_.'"To still further perfect the appliance a simple mechanism has
  since 1870 been attached to the rod actuating the switch-bolt,
  which prevents the signal-man from shifting the switch under a
  passing train in the manner suggested by Captain Tyler in the above
  extract.In fact it is no exaggeration to say that the interlocking
  system has now been so studied, and every possible contingency so
  thoroughly provided for, that in using it accidents can only occur
  through a wilful intention to bring them about.In spite of any theoretical or fanciful objections which may be
urged against it, this appliance will be found an indispensable
adjunct to any really heavy junction or terminal train movement.For
the elevated railroads of New York, for instance, its early adoption
proved a necessity.As for questions of temperature, climate,
etc., as affecting the long connecting rods and wires which are an
essential part of the system, objections based upon them are purely
imaginary.Difficulties from this source were long since met and
overcome by very simple compensating arrangements, and in practice
occasion no inconvenience.That rods may break, and that wires are
at all times liable to get out of gear, every one knows; and yet
this fact is urged as a novel objection to each new mechanical
improvement.That a broken or disordered apparatus will always
occasion a serious disturbance to any heavy train movement, may also
be admitted.The fact none the less remains that in practice, and
daily subjected through long periods of time to incomparably the
heaviest train movement known to railroad experience, the rods of
the interlocking apparatus do not break, nor do its wires get out
of gear; while by means of it, and of it alone, this train movement
goes unceasingly on never knowing any serious disturbance.[20]

  [20] "As an instance of the possibility of preventing the mistakes
  so often made by signal men with conflicting signals or with facing
  points I have shown the traffic for a single day, and at certain
  hours of that day, at the Cannon Street station of the South Eastern
  Railway, already referred to as one of the _no-accident_ lines of
  the year.The traffic of that station, with trains continually
  crossing one another, by daylight and in darkness, in fog or in
  sunshine, amounts to more than 130 trains in three hours in the
  morning, and a similar number in the evening; and, altogether, to
  652 trains, conveying more than 35,000 passengers in the day as
  a winter, or 40,000 passengers a day as a summer average.It is
  probably not too much to say, that without the signal and point
  arrangements which have there been supplied, and the system of
  interlocking which has there been so carefully carried out, the
  signalmen could not carry on their duties _for one hour without
  accident_."_Captain Tyler's report on accidents for 1870, p.35._

It is not, however, alone in connection with terminal stations and
junctions that the interlocking apparatus is of value.It is also
the scientific substitute for the law or regulation compelling
trains to stop as a measure of precaution when they approach
grade-crossings or draw-bridges.It is difficult indeed to pass from
the consideration of this fine result of science and to speak with
patience of the existing American substitute for it.If the former
is a feature in the block system, the latter is a signal example of
the block-head system.As a device to avoid danger it is a standing
disgrace to American ingenuity; and, fortunately, as stopping is
compatible only with a very light traffic, so soon as the passage
of trains becomes incessant a substitute for it has got to be
devised.In this country, as in England, that substitute will be
found in the interlocking apparatus.By means of it the draw-bridge,
for instance, can be so connected with the danger signals--which
may, if desired, be gates closing across the railroad tracks--that
the one cannot be opened except by closing the other.This is the
method adopted in Great Britain not only at draws in bridges, but
frequently also in the case of gates at level road crossings.It
has already been noticed that in Great Britain accidents at draws
in bridges seem to be unknown.Certainly not one has been reported
during the last nine years.The security afforded in this case
by interlocking would, indeed, seem to be absolute; as, if the
apparatus is out of order, either the gates or the bridge would be
closed, and could not be opened until it was repaired.So also as
respects the grade-crossing of one railroad by another.Bringing
all trains to a complete stop when approaching these crossings
is a precaution quite generally observed in America, either as a
matter of statute law or running regulation; and yet during the six
years 1873-8 no less than 104 collisions were reported at these
crossings.In Great Britain during the nine years 1870-8 but nine
cases of accidents of this description were reported, and in both
the years 1877 and 1878 under the head of "Accidents or Collisions
on Level Crossings of Railways," the chief inspector of the Board
of Trade tersely stated that,--"No accident was inquired into under
this head.[21]" The interlocking system there affords the most
perfect protection which can be devised against a most dangerous
practice in railroad construction to which Americans are almost
recklessly addicted.It is, also, matter of daily experience that
the interlocking system does afford a perfect practical safeguard
in this case.Every junction of a branch with a double track
road involves a grade-crossing, and a grade-crossing of the most
dangerous character.On the Metropolitan Elevated railroad of New
York, at 53d street, there is one of these junctions, where, all
day long, trains are crossing at grade at the rate of some twenty
miles an hour.These trains never stop, except when signalled so
to do.The interlocking apparatus, however, makes it impossible
that one track should be open except when the other is closed.An
accident, therefore, can happen only through the wilful carelessness
of the engineer in charge of a train;--and in the face of wilful
carelessness laws are of no more avail than signals.If a man in
control of a locomotive wishes to bring on a collision he can always
do it.Unless he wishes to, however, the interlocking apparatus
not only can prevent him from so doing, but as a matter of fact
always does.The same rule which holds good at junctions would hold
good at level crossings.There is no essential difference between
the two.By means of the interlocking apparatus the crossing can
be so blocked at any desired distance from it in such a way that
when one track is open the other must be closed;--unless, indeed,
the apparatus is out of order, and then both would be closed.The precaution in this case, also, is absolute.Unlike the rule
as to stopping, it does not depend on the caution or judgment of
individuals;--there are the signals and the obstructions, and
if they are not displayed on one road they are on the other.So
superior is this apparatus in every respect--as regards safety as
well as convenience--to the precaution of coming to a stop, that, as
an inducement to introduce an almost perfect scientific appliance,
it would be very desirable that states like Massachusetts and
Connecticut compelling the stop, should except from the operation
of the law all draw-bridges or grade-crossings at which suitable
interlocking apparatus is provided.Surely it is not unreasonable
that in this case science should have a chance to assert itself.[21] "As affecting the safe working of railways, the level crossing
  of one railway by another is a matter of very serious import.Even when signalled on the most approved principles, they are a
  source of danger, and, if possible, should always be avoided.At
  junctions of branch or other railways the practice has been adopted
  by some companies in special cases, to carry the off line under or
  over the main line by a bridge.This course should generally be
  adopted in the case of railways on which the traffic is large, and
  more expressly where express and fast trains are run."_Report on
  Accidents on Railways of the United Kingdom during 1877, p.35._

In any event, however, the general introduction of the interlocking
apparatus into the American railroad system may be regarded as a
mere question of the value of land and concentration of traffic.So long as every road terminating in our larger cities indulges,
at whatever unnecessary cost to its stockholders, in independent
station buildings far removed from business centres, the train
movement can most economically be conducted as it now is.The
expense of the interlocking apparatus is avoided by the very simple
process of incurring the many fold heavier expense of several
station buildings and vast disconnected station grounds.If,
however, in the city of Boston, for instance, the time should come
when the financial and engineering audacity of the great English
companies shall be imitated,--when some leading railroad company
shall fix its central passenger station on Tremont street opposite
the head of Court street, just as in London the South Eastern
established itself on Cannon street, and then this company carrying
its road from Pemberton Square by a tunnel under Beacon Hill and the
State-house should at the crossing of the Charles radiate out so as
to afford all other roads an access for their trains to the same
terminal point, thus concentrating there the whole daily movement of
that busy population which makes of Boston its daily counting-room
and market-place,--then, when this is attempted, the time will have
come for utilizing to its utmost capacity every available inch of
space to render possible the incessant passage of trains.Then also
will it at last be realized that it is far cheaper to use a costly
and intricate apparatus which enables two companies to be run into
one convenient station, than it is to build a separate station, even
at an inconvenient point, to accommodate each company.In March, 1825, there appeared in the pages of the _Quarterly
Review_ an article in which the writer discussed that railway
system, the first vague anticipation of which was then just
beginning to make the world restless.He did this, too, in a very
intelligent and progressive spirit, but unfortunately secured for
his article a permanence of interest he little expected by the
use of one striking illustration.He was peculiarly anxious to
draw a distinct line of demarcation between his own very rational
anticipations and the visionary dreams of those enthusiasts who
were boring the world to death over the impossibilities which they
claimed that the new invention was to work.Among these he referred
to the proposition that passengers would be "whirled at the rate
of eighteen or twenty miles an hour by means of a high pressure
engine," and then contemptuously added,--"We should as soon expect
the people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be fired off upon one
of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as trust themselves to the mercy
of such a machine, going at such a rate; their property perhaps they
may trust."Under the circumstances, the criticism was a perfectly reasonable
one.The danger involved in going at such a rate of speed and the
impossibility of stopping in time to avoid a sudden danger, would
naturally suggest themselves to any one as insuperable objections
to the new system for any practical use.Some means of preserving
a sudden and powerful control over a movement of such unheard of
rapidity would almost as a matter of course be looked upon as a
condition precedent.Yet it is a most noticeable fact in the history
of railroad development that the improvement in appliances for
controlling speed by no means kept pace with the increased rate of
speed attained.Indeed, so far as the possibility of rapid motion
is concerned, there is no reason to suppose that the _Rocket_
could not have held its own very respectably by the side of a
passenger locomotive of the present day.It will be remembered
that on the occasion of the Manchester & Liverpool opening, Mr.Huskisson after receiving his fatal injury was carried seventeen
miles in twenty-five minutes.Since then the details of locomotive
construction have been simplified and improved upon, but no great
change has been or probably will be effected in the matter of
velocity;--as respects that the maximum was practically reached
at once.Yet down to the year 1870 the brake system remained very
much what it was in 1830.Improvements in detail were effected,
but the essential principles were the same.In case of any sudden
emergency, the men in charge of the locomotive had no direct control
over the vehicles in the train; they communicated with them by the
whistle, and when the signal was heard the brakes were applied as
soon as might be.When a train is moving at the rate of forty miles
an hour, by no means a great speed for it while in full motion, it
passes over fifty-eight feet each second;--at sixty miles an hour it
passes over eighty-eight feet.Under these circumstances, supposing
an engine driver to become suddenly aware of an obstruction on the
track, as was the case at Revere, or of something wrong in the train
behind him, as at Shipton, he had first himself to signal danger,
and to this signal the brakemen throughout the train had to respond.Each operation required time, and every second of time represented
many feet of space.It was small matter for surprise, therefore,
that when in 1875 they experimented scientifically in England, it
was ascertained that a train of a locomotive and thirteen cars
moving at a speed of forty-five miles an hour could not be brought
to a stand in less than one minute, or before it had traversed a
distance of half a mile.The same result it will be remembered was
arrived at by practical experience in America, where both at Angola
and at Port Jervis,[22] it was found impossible to stop the trains
in less than half-a-mile, though in each case two derailed cars were
dragging and plunging along at the end of them.[22] _Ante_, pp.The need of a continuous train-brake, operated from the locomotive
and under the immediate control of the engine-driver, had been
emphasized through years by the almost regular recurrence of
accidents of the most appalling character.In answer to this need
almost innumerable appliances had been patented and experimented
with both in Europe and in America.Prior to 1869, however,
these had been almost exclusively what are known as emergency
brakes;--that is, although the trains were equipped with them and
they were operated from the locomotives, they were not relied upon
for ordinary use, but were held in reserve, as it were, against
special exigencies.The Hudson River railroad train at the Hamburg
accident was thus equipped.Practically, appliances which in the
operation of railroads are reserved for emergencies are usually
found of little value when the emergency occurs.Accordingly no
continuous brake had, prior to the development of Westinghouse's
invention, worked its way into general use.Patent brakes had
become a proverb as well as a terror among railroad mechanics,
and they had ceased to believe that any really desirable thing of
the sort would ever be perfected.Westinghouse, therefore, had a
most unbelieving audience to encounter, and his invention had to
fight hard for all the favor it won; nor did his experience with
master mechanics differ, probably, much from Miller's.His first
patents were taken out in 1869, and he early secured the powerful
aid of the Pennsylvania road for his invention.The Pullman Car
Company, also, always anxious to avail themselves of every appliance
of safety as well as of comfort, speedily saw the merits of the
new brake and adopted it; but, as they merely furnished cars and
had nothing to do with the locomotives that pulled them, their
support was not so effective as that of the great railroad company.Naturally enough, also, great hesitation was felt in adopting so
complicated an appliance.It added yet another whole apparatus to
a thing which was already overburdened with machinery.There was,
also, something in the delicacy and precision of the parts of this
new contrivance,--in its air-pump and reservoirs and long connecting
tubes with their numerous valves,--which was peculiarly distasteful
to the average practical railroad mechanic.It was true that the
idea of transmitting power by means of compressed air was by no
means new,--that thousands of drills were being daily driven by
it wherever tunnelling was going on or miners were at work,--yet
the application of this familiar power to the wheels of a railroad
train seemed no less novel than it was bold.It was, in the first
place, evident that the new apparatus would not stand the banging
and hammering to which the old-fashioned hand-brake might safely
be subjected; not indeed without deranging that simple appliance,
but without incurring any very heavy bill for repairs in so doing.Accordingly the new brake was at first carelessly examined and
patronizingly pushed aside as a pretty toy,--nice in theory no
doubt, but wholly unfitted for rough, every-day use.As it was
tersely expressed during a discussion before the Society of Arts
in London, as recently as May, 1877,--"It was no use bringing out
a brake which could not be managed by ordinary officials,--which
was so wonderfully clever that those who had to use it could not
understand it."A line of argument by the way, which, as has been
already pointed out, may with far greater force be applied to the
locomotive itself; and, indeed, unquestionably was so applied
about half a century ago by men of the same calibre who apply it
now, to the intense weariness and discouragement no doubt of the
late George Stephenson.Whether sound or otherwise, however, few
more effective arguments against an appliance can be advanced; and
against the Westinghouse brake it was advanced so effectively,
that even as late as 1871, although largely in use on western
roads, it had found its way into Massachusetts only as an ingenious
device of doubtful merit.It was in August, 1871, that the Revere
disaster occurred, and the Revere disaster, as has been seen,
would unquestionably have been averted had the colliding train
been provided with proper brake power.This at last called serious
attention there to the new appliance.Even then, however, the mere
suggestion of something better being in existence than the venerable
hand-brakes in familiar use did not pass without a vigorous protest;
and at the meeting of railroad officials, which has already been
referred to as having been called by the state commissioners
after the accident, one prominent gentleman, when asked if the
road under his charge was equipped with the most approved brake,
indignantly replied that it was,--that it was equipped with the
good, old-fashioned hand-brake;--and he then proceeded to vehemently
stake his professional reputation on the absolute superiority of
that ancient but somewhat crude appliance over anything else of the
sort in existence.Nevertheless, on this occasion also, the great
dynamic force which is ever latent in first-class railroad accidents
again asserted itself.Even the most opinionated of professional
railroad men, emphatically as he might in public deny it, quietly
yielded as soon as might be.In a surprisingly short time after the
exhibition of ignorance which has been referred to, the railroads in
Massachusetts, as it has already been shown, were all equipped with
train-brakes.[23]

  [23] Page 157.In its present improved shape it is safe to say that in all those
requisites which the highest authorities known on the subject have
laid down as essential to a model train brake, the Westinghouse
stands easily first among the many inventions of the kind.It is
now a much more perfect appliance than it was in 1871, for it was
then simply atmospheric and continuous in its action, whereas it
has since been made automatic and self-regulating.So far as its
fundamental principle is concerned, that is too generally understood
to call for explanation.By means of an air-pump, attached to the
boiler of the locomotive and controlled by the engine-driver, an
atmospheric force is brought to bear, through tubes running under
the cars, upon the break blocks, pressing them against the wheels.The hand of the engine-driver is in fact on every wheel in the
train.This application of power, though unquestionably ingenious
and, like all good things, most simple and obvious when once
pointed out, was originally open to one great objection, which was
persistently and with great force urged against it.The parts of the
apparatus were all delicate, and some injury or derangement of them
was always possible, and sometimes inevitable.The chief advantage
claimed for the brake was, however, that complete dependence could
be placed upon it in the regular movement of trains.It was obvious,
therefore, that if such dependence was placed upon it and any
derangement did occur, the first intimation those in charge of the
train would have that something was wrong might well come in the
shape of a failure of the brake to act, and a subsequent disaster.Both in Massachusetts and in Connecticut, at the crossing of one
railroad by another at the same level in the former state and in the
approach to draws in bridges in the latter, a number of cases of
this failure of the original Westinghouse non-automatic brake to act
did in point of fact occur.Fortunately they, none of them, resulted
in disaster.This, however, was mere good luck, as was illustrated
in the case of the accident of November 11, 1876, at the Communipaw
Ferry on the New Jersey Central.The train was there equipped with
the ordinary train brake.It reached Jersey City on time shortly
after 4 P.M., but, instead of slacking up, it ran directly through
the station and freight offices, carrying away the walls and
supports, and the locomotive then plunged into the river beyond.The baggage and smoking car followed but fortunately lodged on the
locomotive, thus blocking the remainder of the train.Fortunately no
one was killed, and no passengers were seriously injured.Again, on the Metropolitan Elevated railroad in New York city, on
the evening of June 23, 1879, one of the trains was delayed for a
few moments at the Franklin street station.Meanwhile the next train
came along, and, though the engine-driver of this following train
saw the danger signals and endeavored to stop in time, he found his
brake out of order, and a collision ensued resulting in the injury
of one employé and the severe shattering of a passenger coach and
locomotive.It was only a piece of good fortune that the first
of these accidents did not result in a repetition of the Norwalk
disaster and the second in that of Revere.It so chanced that it was the Smith vacuum brake which failed to
work at Communipaw, and the Eames vacuum which failed to work at
Franklin street.It might just
as well have been the original Westinghouse.The difficulty lay, not
in the maker's name, but in the imperfect action of the brake; and
such significant intimations are not to be disregarded.The chances
are naturally large that the failure of the continuous brake to act
will not at once occur under just those circumstances which will
entail a serious disaster and heavy loss of life; that, however, if
such intimations as these are disregarded, it will sooner or later
so occur does not admit of doubt.But the possibility that upon some given occasion it might fail to
work was not the only defect in the original Westinghouse; it might
well be in perfect order and in full action even, and then suddenly,
as the result of derailment or separation of parts, the apparatus
might be broken, and at once the shoes would drop from the wheels,
and the vehicles of the disabled train would either press forward,
or, on an incline, stop and run backwards until their unchecked
momentum was exhausted.This appears to have been the case at
Wollaston, and contributed some of its most disastrous features to
that accident.To obviate these defects Westinghouse in 1872 invented what he
termed a triple valve attachment, by means of which, if the
thing can be so expressed, his brake was made to always stand at
danger.That is, in case of any derangement of its parts, it was
automatically applied and the train stopped.The action of the brake
was thus made to give notice of anything wrong anywhere in the
train.A noticeable case of this occurred on the Midland railway in
England, when on the November 22, 1876, as the Scotch express was
approaching the Heeley station, at a speed of some sixty miles an
hour, the hind-guard felt the automatic brake suddenly self-applied.The forward truck of a Pullman car in the middle of the train had
left the rails; the front part of the train broke the couplings
and went on, while the rear carriages, acted upon by the automatic
brakes, came to a stand immediately behind the Pullman, which
finally rested on its side across the opposite track.On the other hand, as the Scotch express on the
North Eastern road was approaching Morpeth, on March 25, 1877, at
a speed of some twenty-five miles an hour, the locomotive for some
reason left the track.The train was not equipped with an automatic
brake, and the carriages in it accordingly pressed forward upon
each other until three of them were so utterly destroyed as to be
indistinguishable.Five passengers lost their lives; the remains of
one of whom, together with the wheels of a carriage, were afterwards
taken out from the tank of the tender, into which they had been
driven by the force of the shock.The theoretical objection to the automatic brake is obvious.In
case of any derangement of its machinery it applies itself, and,
should these derangements be of frequent occurrence, the consequent
stoppage of trains would prove a great annoyance, if not a source
of serious danger.This objection is not sustained by practical
experience.The triple valve, so called, is the only complicated
portion of the automatic brake, and this valve is well protected
and not liable to get out of order.[24] Should it become deranged
it will stop the working of the brake on that car alone to which it
belongs; and it will become deranged so as to set the brake only
from causes which would render the non-automatic brake inoperative.When anything of this sort occurs, it stops the train until the
defect is remedied.The returns made to the English Board of
Trade enable us to know just how frequently in actual and regular
service these stoppages occur, and what they amount to.Take, for
instance, the North Eastern and the Caledonian railways.During the last six months of 1878 the first
ran 138,000 train miles with it, in the course of which there
were eight delays or stoppages of some three to five minutes each
occasioned by the action of the triple-valve; being in round numbers
one occasion of delay in 17,000 miles of train movement.On the
Caledonian railway, during the same period, four brake failures, due
to the action of the triple-valve, were reported in runs aggregating
over 62,000 miles, being about one failure to 15,000 miles.These
failures moreover occasioned delays of only a few minutes each, and,
where the cause of the difficulty was not so immediately apparent
that it could at once be remedied, the brake-tubes of the vehicle
on which the difficulty occurred were disconnected, and the trains
went on.[25] One of these stoppages, however, resulted in a serious
accident.As a train on the Caledonian road was approaching the
Wemyss Bay junction on December 14th, in a dense fog, the engine
driver, seeing the signals at danger, undertook to apply his brake
slightly, when it went full on, stopping the train between the
distant and home signals, as they are called in the English block
system.After the danger signal was lowered, but before the brake
could be released, the signal-man allowed a following train to enter
upon the same block section, and a collision followed in which some
thirteen passengers were slightly injured.This accident, however,
as the inspecting officer of the Board of Trade very properly found,
was due not at all to the automatic brake, but to "carelessness
on the part of the signal-man, who disregarded the rules for the
working of the block telegraph instruments," and to the driver
of the colliding train, who "disobeyed the company's running
regulations."It gives an American, however, a realizing sense of
one of the difficulties under which those crowded British lines are
operated, to read that in this case the fog was "so thick that the
tail-lamp was not visible from an approaching train for more than a
few yards."[24] Speaking of the modifications introduced into his brake by
  Westinghouse since 1874, Mr.Thomas E. Harrison, civil engineer
  of the North Eastern Railway Company in a communication to the
  directors of that company of April 24, 1879, recommending the
  adoption by it of the Westinghouse, and subsequently ordered to
  be printed for the use of Parliament, thus referred to the triple
  valve: "As the most important [of these modifications] I will
  particularly draw your attention to the "triple-valve" which has
  been made a regular bugbear by the opponents of the system, and has
  been called complicated, delicate, and liable to get out of order,
  etc.* * * It is, in fact, as simple a piece of mechanism as well
  can be imagined, certain in its action, of durable materials, easily
  accessible to an ordinary workman for examination or cleaning, and
  there is nothing about it that can justify the term complication; on
  the contrary, it is a model of ingenuity and simplicity."[25] During the six months ending June 30, 1879, some 300 stops due
  to some derangement of the apparatus of the Westinghouse brake were
  reported by ten companies in runs aggregating about two million
  miles.Being one stop to 6,600 miles run.Very many of these stops
  were obviously due to the want of familiarity of the employés with
  an apparatus new to them, but as a rule the delays occasioned did
  not exceed a very few minutes; of 82 stoppages, for instance,
  reported on the London, Brighton & South Coast road, the two longest
  were ten minutes each and the remainder averaged some three or four
  minutes.After the application of the triple valve had made it automatic,
there remained but one further improvement necessary to render
the Westinghouse a well-nigh perfect brake.A superabundance of
self-acting power had been secured, but no provision was yet made
for graduating the use of that power so that it should be applied
in the exact degree, neither more nor less, which would soonest
stop the train.This for two reasons is mechanically a matter of
no little importance.As is well known a too severe application of
brakes, no matter of what kind they are, causes the wheels to stand
still and slide upon the rails.This is not only very injurious to
rolling stock, the wheels of which are flattened at the points which
slide, but, as has long been practically well-known to those whose
business it is to run locomotives, when once the wheels begin to
slide the retarding power of the brakes is seriously diminished.In order, therefore, to secure the maximum of retarding power, the
pressure of the brake-blocks on the revolving wheels should be very
great when first applied, and just sufficient not to slide them; and
should then be diminished, _pari passu_ with the momentum of the
train, until it wholly stops.Familiar as all this has long been
to engine-drivers and practical railroad mechanics, yet it has not
been conceded in the results of many scientific inquiries.In the
report of one of the Royal Commissions on Accidents, for instance,
it was asserted that the momentum of a train was retarded more by
the action of sliding than of slowly revolving wheels; and again,
as recently as in May, 1877, in a scientific discussion in London
at one of the meetings of the Society of Arts, a gentleman, with
the letters C. E. appended to his name, ventured the surprising
assertion that "no brake could do more than skid the wheels of
a train, and all continuous brakes professed to do this, and he
believed did so about equally well."Now, what it is here asserted
no brake can do is exactly what the perfect brake will be made to
do,--and what Westinghouse's latest improvement, it is claimed,
enables his brake to do.It much more than "skids the wheels," by
measuring out exactly that degree of power necessary to hold the
wheels just short of the skidding point, and in this way always
exerts the maximum retarding force.This is brought about by means
of a contrivance which allows the air to leak out of the brake
cylinders so as to exactly proportion the pressure of the blocks
on the wheels to the speed with which the latter are revolving.In other, and more scientific, language the force with which the
brake-blocks are pressed upon the wheels is made to adjust itself
automatically as the "coefficient of dynamic friction augments with
the reduction of train speed."It hardly needs to be said that in
this way the power of the brake is enormously increased.In America the superiority of the Westinghouse over any other
description of train-brake has long been established through that
large preponderance of use which in such matters constitutes the
final and irreversible verdict.[26] In Europe, however, and
especially in Great Britain, ever since the Shipton-on-Cherwell
accident in 1874, the battle of the brakes, as it may not
inappropriately be called, has waxed hotter and hotter; and not only
has this battle been extremely interesting in a scientific way, but
it has been highly characteristic, and at times enlivened by touches
of human nature which were exceedingly amusing.[26] In Massachusetts, for instance, where no official pressure
  in favor of any particular brake was brought to bear, out of 473
  locomotives equipped with train-brakes 361 have the Westinghouse,
  which is also applied to 1,363 out of 1,669 cars.Of these, however,
  79 locomotives and 358 cars are equipped with both the atmospheric
  and the vacuum brakes.The English battle of the brakes may be said to have fairly opened
with the official report from Captain Tyler on the Shipton accident,
in reference to which he expressed the opinion, which has already
been quoted in describing the accident, that "if the train had
been fitted with continuous brakes throughout its whole length
there is no reason why it should not have been brought to rest
without any casuality."The Royal Commission on railroad accidents
then took the matter up and called for a series of scientifically
conducted experiments.These took place under the supervision of
two engineers appointed by the Commission, who were aided by a
detail of officers and men from the royal engineers.Eight brakes
competed, and a train, consisting of a locomotive and thirteen
cars, was specially prepared for each.With these trains some
seventy runs were made, and their results recorded and tabulated;
the experiments were continued through six consecutive working
days.Of the brakes experimented with three were American in their
origin,--Westinghouse's automatic and vacuum, and Smith's vacuum.The remainder were English, and were steam, hydraulic, and air
brakes; among them also was one simple emergency brake.The result
of the trials was a very decided victory for the Westinghouse
automatic, and upon its performances the Commission based its
conclusion that trains ought to be so equipped that in cases of
emergency they could be brought to rest, when travelling on level
ground at 50 miles an hour, within a distance of 275 yards; with
an allowance of distance in cases of speed greater or less than
50 miles nearly proportioned to its square.These allowances they
tabulated as follows:--

  At 60 miles per hour, stopping distance within 400 yards.
  "55        "            "           "        340   "
  "  50        "            "           "        275   "
  "  45        "            "           "        220   "
  "  40        "            "           "        180   "
  "  35        "            "           "        135   "
  "  30        "            "           "        100   "

To appreciate the enormous advance in what may be called stopping
power which these experiments revealed, it should be added that
the first series of experiments made at Newark were with trains
equipped only with the hand-brake.The average speed in these
experiments was 47 miles, and with the train-brake, according to the
foregoing tabulation, the stop should have been made in about 250
yards; in reality it was made in a little less than five times that
distance, or 1120 yards; in other words the experiments showed that
the improved appliances had more than quadrupled the control over
trains.It has already been noticed that in the cases of the Angola
and the Port Jervis disasters, as well as in that at Shipton, the
trains ran some 2,700 feet before they could be stopped.Under the
English tabulations above given, in the results of which certain
recent improvements do not enter, a train running into the 42d
Street Station in New York, at a speed of forty-five miles an hour
when under the entrance arches, would be stopped before it reached
the buffers at the end of the covered tracks.The Royal Commission experiments were followed in May and June,
1877, by yet others set on foot by the North Eastern Railway
Company for the purpose of making a competitive test of the
Westinghouse automatic and the Smith's vacuum brakes.At this trial
also the average stop at a speed of 50 miles an hour was effected
in 15 seconds, and within a distance of 650 feet.Other series
of experiments with similar results were, about the same time,
conducted under the auspices of the Belgian and German governments,
of which elaborate official reports were made.The result was that
at last, under date of August 30, 1877, the Board of Trade issued
a circular to the railway companies in which it called attention to
the fact that, notwithstanding all the discussion which had taken
place and the elaborate official trials which the government had set
on foot, there had "apparently been no attempt on the part of the
various companies to take the first step of agreeing upon what are
the requirements which, in their opinion, are essential to a good
continuous brake."In other words, the Board found that, instead of
becoming better, matters were rapidly becoming worse.Each company
was equipping its rolling stock with that appliance in which its
officers happened to be interested as owners or inventors, and when
carriages thus equipped passed from the tracks of one road onto
those of another the result was a return to the old hand-brake
system in a condition of impaired efficiency.The Board accordingly
now proceeded to narrow down the field of selection by specifying
the following as what it considered the essentials of a good
continuous brake:--

     _a._ "The brakes to be efficient in stopping trains,
     instantaneous in their actions, and capable of being applied
     without difficulty by engine-drivers or guards._b._ "In case of accident, to be instantaneously self-acting._c._ "The brakes to be put on and taken off (with facility) on
     the engine and on every vehicle of a train._d._ "The brakes to be regularly used in daily working._e._ "The materials employed to be of a durable character, so as
     to be easily maintained and kept in order."These requirements pointed about as directly as they could to the
Westinghouse, to the exclusion of all competing brakes.Not more
than one other complied with them in all respects, and many made
no pretence of complying at all.Then followed what may be termed
the battle royal of the brakes, which as yet shows no signs of
drawing to a close.As the avowed object of the Board of Trade was
to introduce, one brake, to the necessary exclusion of all others,
throughout the railroad system of Great Britain, the magnitude of
the prize was not easy to over-estimate.The weight of scientific
and official authority was decidedly in favor of the Westinghouse
automatic, but among the railroad men the Smith vacuum found
the largest number of adherents.It failed to meet three of the
requirements of the Board of Trade, in that it was neither automatic
nor instantaneous in its action, while the materials employed in
it were not of a durable character.It was, on the other hand, a
brake of unquestioned excellence, while it commended itself to the
judgment of the average railroad official by its simplicity, and to
that of the average railroad director by its apparent cheapness.Any
one could understand it, and its first cost was temptingly small.The real struggle in Great Britain, therefore, has been, and now
is, between these two brakes; and the fact that both of them are
American has been made to enter largely into it, and in a way also
which at times lent to the discussion an element of broad humor.For instance, the energetic agent of the Smith vacuum, feeling
himself aggrieved by some statement which appeared in the _Times_,
responded thereto in a circular, in the composition of which he
certainly evinced more zeal than either judgment or literary skill.This circular and its author were then referred to by the editors
of _Engineering_, a London scientific journal, in the following
slightly _de haut en bas_ style:--

     "It is not a little remarkable, and it is a fact not harmonious
     with the feelings of English engineers, that the two brakes
     recommending themselves for adoption are of American origin.* * * Now we cannot wonder, considering what our past experience
     has been in many of our dealings with Americans, that this
     feeling of distrust and prejudice exists.It is not merely
     sentimental, it is founded on many and untoward and costly
     experiences of the past, and the fear of similar experiences in
     the future.And when we see the representative of one of these
     systems adopting the traditional policy of his country, and
     meeting criticism with abuse--abuse of men pre-eminent in the
     profession, and journals which he apparently forgets are neither
     American nor venal--we do not wonder that our railway engineers
     feel a repugnance to commit themselves."The superiority of the British over the American controversialist,
as respects courtesy and restraint in language, being thus
satisfactorily established, it only remained to illustrate it.This, however, had already been done in the previous May; for at
that time it chanced that Captain Tyler, having retired from his
position at the head of the railway inspectors department of the
Board of Trade, was considering an offer which Mr.Westinghouse had
made him to associate himself with the company owning the brakes
known by that name.Before accepting this offer, Captain Tyler
took advantage of a meeting of the Society of Arts to publicly
give notice that he was considering it.This he did in a really
admirable paper on the whole subject of continuous brakes, at the
close of which a general discussion was invited and took place, and
in the course of it the innate superiority of the British over any
other kind of controversialist, so far at least as courtesy and a
delicate refraining from imputations is concerned, received pointed
illustration.Houghton, C. E., took
occasion to refer to the paper he had read as "an elaborate puff
to the Westinghouse brake, with which he [Tyler] was, as he told,
connected, or about to be."Steele proceeded to say
that:--

     "On receiving the invitation to be present at the meeting, he
     had been somewhat afraid that Captain Tyler was going to lose
     his fine character for impartiality by throwing in his lot with
     the brake-tinkers, but it came out that not only was he going to
     do that, but actually going to be a partner in a concern.* * *
     The speaker then proceeded to discuss the Westinghouse brake,
     which he called the Westinghouse and Tyler brake, designating
     it as a jack-in-the-box, a rattle trap, to please and decoy,
     and not an invention at all.No engineer had a hand in its
     manufacture.It was the discovery of some Philadelphia barber
     or some such thing.This was
     a brake which had all sorts of pretensions.It had not worked
     well, but whenever there was any row about its not working
     well, they got the papers to praise it up, and that was how the
     papers were under the thumb, and would not speak of any other.* * * He thought it would not do for railway companies to take
     a bad brake, and Captain Tyler and Mr.Westinghouse be able
     to make their fortunes by floating a limited company for its
     introduction.They had heard of Emma mines and Lisbon tramways,
     and such like, and he felt it would not be well to stand by and
     allow this to be done."All of which was not only to the point, but finely calculated to
show the American inventors and agents who were present the nice and
mutually respectful manner in which such discussions were carried on
by all Englishmen.Though the avowed adhesion of Sir Henry Tyler to the Westinghouse
was a most important move in the war of the brakes, it did not
prove a decisive one.The complete control of the field was too
valuable a property to be yielded in deference to that, or any other
name without a struggle; and, so to speak, there were altogether
too many ins and outs to the conflict.Back door influences had
everywhere to be encountered.The North Western, for instance, is
the most important of the railway companies of the United Kingdom.The locomotive superintendent of that company was the part inventor
and proprietor of an emergency brake which had been extensively
adopted by it on its rolling stock, but which wholly failed to meet
the requirements laid down in its circular by the Board of Trade.Immediately after issuing that circular the Board of Trade called
the attention of the company to this fact in connection with an
accident which had recently occurred, and in very emphatic language
pointed out that the brakes in question could not "in any reasonable
sense of the word be called continuous brakes," and that it was
clear that the circular requirements were "not complied with by the
brake-system of the London & North Western Railway Company;" in case
that company persisted in the use of that brake, the secretary of
the Board went on to say, "in the event of a casualty occurring,
which an efficient system of brakes might have prevented, a heavy
personal responsibility will rest upon those who are answerable for
such neglect."This was certainly language tolerably direct in its
import.As such it was calculated to cause those to whom it was
addressed to pause in their action.The company, however, treated it
with a superb disregard, all the more contemptuous because veiled
in language of deferential civility.They then quietly went on
applying their locomotive superintendent's emergency brake to their
equipment, until on the 30th of June, 1879, they returned no less
than 2,052 carriages fitted with it; that being by far the largest
number returned by any one company in the United Kingdom.A more direct challenge to the Board of Trade and to Parliament
could not easily have been devised.To appreciate how direct it
was, it is necessary to bear in mind that in its circular of August
30, 1877, in which the requirements of a satisfactory train-brake
were laid down, the Board of Trade threw out to the companies
the very significant hint, that they "would do well to reflect
that if a doubt should arise that from a conflict of interest or
opinion, or from any other cause, they [the companies] are not
exerting themselves, it is obvious that they will call down upon
themselves an interference which the Board of Trade, no less than
the companies, desire to avoid."In his general report on the
accidents of the year 1877, the successor of Captain Tyler expressed
the opinion that "sufficient information and experience would now
appear to be available, and the time is approaching when the railway
companies may fairly be expected to come to a decision as to which
of the systems of continuous brakes is best calculated to fulfil the
requisite conditions, and is most worthy of general adoption."At
the close of another year, however, the official returns seemed to
indicate that, while but a sixth part of the passenger locomotives
and a fifth part of the carriages in use on the railroads of the
United Kingdom were yet equipped with continuous brakes at all, a
concurrence of opinion in favor of any one system was more remote
than ever.During the six months ending December 31, 1878, but 127
additional locomotives out of about 4000, and 1,200 additional
carriages out of some 32,000 were equipped; of which 70 locomotives
and 530 carriages had been equipped with the Smith vacuum, which in
three most important respects failed to comply with the Board of
Trade requirements.Under these circumstances the Board of Trade
was obviously called upon either to withdraw from the position it
had taken, or to invite that "interference" in its support to which
in its circular of August, 1877 it had so portentously referred.It
decided to do the latter, and in March, 1879 the government gave an
intimation in the House of Lords that early Parliamentary action was
contemplated.As it is expressed, the railway companies are to "be
relieved of their indecision."In Great Britain, therefore, the long battle of the brakes would
seem to be drawing to its close.The final struggle, however,
will be a spirited one, and one which Americans will watch with
considerable interest,--for it is in fact a struggle between two
American brakes, the Westinghouse and the Smith vacuum.Of the
907 locomotives hitherto equipped with the continuous brakes no
less than 819 are equipped with one or the other of these American
patents, besides over 4,464 of the 9,919 passenger carriages.The
remaining 3,857 locomotives and 30,000 carriages are the prize of
victory.As the score now stands the vacuum brake is in almost
exactly twice the use of its more scientific rival.The weight
of authority and experience, and the requirements of the Board of
Trade, are, however, on the opposite side.As deduced from the European scientific tests and the official
returns, the balance of advantages would seem to be as follows:--In
favor of the vacuum are its superficial simplicity, and possible
economy in first cost:--In favor of the Westinghouse automatic are
its superior quickness in application, the greater rapidity in
its stopping power, the more durable nature of its materials, the
smaller cost in renewal, its less liability to derangement, and
above all its self-acting adjustment.The last is the point upon
which the final issue of the struggle must probably turn.The use
of any train-brake which is not automatic in its action, as has
already been pointed out, involves in the long run disaster,--and
ultimate serious disaster.The mere fact that the brake is generally
so reliable,--that ninety-nine times out of the hundred it works
perfectly,--simply makes disaster certain by the fatal confidence
it inspires.Ninety-nine times in a hundred the brake proves
reliable;--nine times in the remaining ten of the thousand, in which
it fails, a lucky chance averts disaster;--but the thousandth time
will assuredly come, as it did at Communipaw and on the New York
Elevated railway, and, much the worst of all yet, at Wollaston.Soon or late the use of non-automatic continuous brakes will most
assuredly, if they are not sooner abandoned, be put an end to
by the occurrence of some not-to-be forgotten catastrophe of the
first magnitude, distinctly traceable to that cause.Meanwhile that
automatic brakes are complicated and sometimes cause inconvenience
in their operation is most indisputable.This is an objection, also,
to which they are open in common with most of the riper results of
human ingenuity;--but, though sun-dials are charmingly simple, we do
not, therefore, discard chronometers in their favor; neither do we
insist on cutting our harvests with the scythe, because every man
who may be called upon to drive a mowing machine may not know how
to put one together.But what Sir Henry Tyler has said in respect
to this oldest and most fallacious, as well as most wearisome, of
objections covers the whole ground and cannot be improved upon.After referring to the fact that simplicity in construction and
simplicity in working were two different things, and that, almost
invariably, a certain degree of complication in construction is
necessary to secure simplicity in working,--after pointing this out
he went on to add that,--

     "Simplicity as regards the application of railway brakes is
     not obtained by the system now more commonly employed of
     brake-handles to be turned by different men in different
     parts of the train; but is obtained when, by more complicated
     construction an engine-driver is able easily in an instant to
     apply ample brake-power at pleasure with more or less force
     to every wheel of his train; is obtained when, every time an
     engine-driver starts, or attempts to start his train, the brake
     itself informs him if it is out of order; and is still more
     obtained when, on the occasion of an accident and the separation
     of a coupling, the brakes will unfailingly apply themselves on
     every wheel of the train without the action of the engine-driver
     or guards, [brakemen], and before even they have time to realize
     the necessity for it.This is true simplicity in such a case,
     and that system of continuous brakes which best accomplishes
     such results in the shortest space of time is so far preferable
     to all others."THE RAILROAD JOURNEY RESULTING IN DEATH.One day in May, 1847, as the Queen of Belgium was going from
Verviers to Brussels by rail, the train in which she was journeying
came into collision with another train going in the opposite
direction.There was naturally something of a panic, and, as
royalty was not then accustomed to being knocked about with
railroad equality, some of her suite urged the queen to leave the
train and to finish her journey by carriage.The contemporaneous
court reporter then went on to say, in that language which is
so peculiarly his own,--"But her Majesty, as courageously as
discreetly, declined to set that example of timidity, and she
proceeded to Brussels by the railway."In those days a very
exaggerated idea was universally entertained of the great danger
incident to travel by rail.Even then, however, had her Majesty, who
was doubtless a very sensible woman, happened to be familiar with
the statistics of injuries received by those traveling respectively
by rail and by carriage, she certainly never on any plea of danger
would have been induced to abandon her railroad train in order to
trust herself behind horse-flesh.By pursuing the course urged
upon her, the queen would have multiplied her chances of accident
some sixty fold.Strange as the statement sounds even now, such
would seem to have been the fact.In proportion to the whole number
carried, the accidents to passengers in "the good old days of
stage-coaches" were, as compared to the present time of the railroad
dispensation, about as sixty to one.This result, it is true, cannot
be verified in the experience either of England or of this country,
for neither the English nor we possess any statistics in relation
to the earlier period; but they have such statistics in France,
stretching over the space of more than forty years, and as reliable
as statistics ever are.If these French statistics hold true in New
England,--and considering the character of our roads, conveyances,
and climate, their showing is more likely to be in our favor than
against us,--if they simply hold true, leaving us to assume that
stage-coach traveling was no less safe in Massachusetts than in
France, then it would follow that to make the dangers of the rail
of the present day equal to those of the highway of half a century
back, some eighty passengers should annually be killed and some
eleven hundred injured within the limits of Massachusetts alone.These figures, however, represent rather more than fifty times the
actual average, and from them it would seem to be not unfair to
conclude that, notwithstanding the great increase of population and
the yet greater increase in travel during the last half-century,
there were literally more persons killed and injured each year in
Massachusetts fifty years ago through accidents to stage-coaches
than there are now through accidents to railroad trains.The first impression of nine out of ten persons in no way connected
with the operations of railroads would probably be found to be
the exact opposite to this.A vague but deeply rooted conviction
commonly prevails that the railroad has created a new danger;
that because of it the average human being's hold on life is more
precarious than it was.The first point-blank, bald statement to the
contrary would accordingly strike people in the light not only of a
paradox, but of a somewhat foolish one.Investigation, nevertheless,
bears it out.The fact is that when a railroad accident comes, it is
apt to come in such a way as to leave no doubt whatever in relation
to it.It is heralded like a battle or an earthquake; it fills
columns of the daily press with the largest capitals and the most
harrowing details, and thus it makes a deep and lasting impression
on the minds of many people.When a multitude of persons, traveling
as almost every man now daily travels himself, meet death in such
sudden and such awful shape, the event smites the imagination.People seeing it and thinking of it, and hearing and reading of
it, and of it only, forget of how infrequent occurrence it is.It
was not so in the olden time.Every one rode behind horses,--if not
in public then in private conveyances,--and when disaster came it
involved but few persons and was rarely accompanied by circumstances
which either struck the imagination or attracted any great public
notice.In the first place, the modern newspaper, with its perfect
machinery for sensational exaggeration, did not then exist,--having
itself only recently come in the train of the locomotive;--and, in
the next place, the circle of those included in the consequences of
any disaster was necessarily small.For
weeks and months the vast machinery moves along, doing its work
quickly, swiftly, safely; no one pays any attention to it, while
millions daily make use of it.It is as much a necessity of their
lives as the food they eat and the air they breathe.Suddenly,
somehow, and somewhere,--at Versailles, at Norwalk, at Abergele, at
New Hamburg, or at Revere,--at some hitherto unfamiliar point upon
an insignificant thread of the intricate iron web, an obstruction is
encountered, a jar, as it were, is felt, and instantly, with time
for hardly an ejaculation or a thought, a multitude of human beings
are hurled into eternity.It is no cause for surprise that such an
event makes the community in which it happens catch its breadth;
neither is it unnatural that people should think more of the few who
are killed, of whom they hear so much, than of the myriads who are
carried in safety and of whom they hear nothing.Yet it is well to
bear in mind that there are two sides to that question also, and in
no way could this fact be more forcibly brought to our notice than
by the assertion, borne out by all the statistics we possess, that,
irrespective of the vast increase in the number of those who travel,
a greater number of passengers in stage-coaches were formerly
each year killed or injured by accidents to which they in no way
contributed through their own carelessness, than are now killed
under the same conditions in our railroad cars.In other words, the
introduction of the modern railroad, so far from proportionately
increasing the dangers of traveling, has absolutely diminished them.It is not, after all, the dangers but the safety of the modern
railroad which should excite our special wonder.What is the average length of the railroad journey resulting in
death by accident to a prudent traveler?--What is the average length
of one resulting in some personal injury to him?--These are two
questions which interest every one.Few persons, probably, start
upon any considerable journey, implying days and nights on the
rail, without almost unconsciously taking into some consideration
the risks of accident.Visions of collision, derailment, plunging
through bridges, will rise unbidden.Even the old traveler who
has enjoyed a long immunity is apt at times, with some little
apprehension, to call to mind the musty adage of the pitcher and
the well, and to ask himself how much longer it will be safe for
him to rely on his good luck.A hundred thousand miles, perhaps,
and no accident yet!--Surely, on every doctrine of chances, he
now owes to fate an arm or a leg;--perhaps a life.The statistics
of a long series of years enable us, however, to approximate with
a tolerable degree of precision to an answer to these questions,
and the answer is simply astounding;--so astounding, in fact,
that, before undertaking to give it, the question itself ought to
be stated with all possible precision.It is this:--Taking all
persons who as passengers travel by rail,--and this includes all
dwellers in civilized countries,--what number of journeys of the
average length are safely accomplished, to each one which results
in the death or injury of a passenger from some cause over which he
had no control?--The cases of death or injury must be confined to
passengers, and to those of them only who expose themselves to no
unnecessary risk.When approaching a question of this sort, statisticians are apt to
assume for their answers an appearance of mathematical accuracy.It is needless to say that this is a mere affectation.The best
results which can be arrived at are, after all, mere approximations,
and they also vary greatly year by year.The body of facts from
which conclusions are to be deduced must cover not only a definite
area of space, but also a considerable lapse of time.Even Great
Britain, with its 17,000 miles of track and its hundreds of millions
of annual passenger journeys, shows results which, one year with
another, vary strangely.For instance, during the four years
anterior to 1874, but one passenger was killed, upon an average, to
each 11,000,000 carried; while in 1874 the proportion, under the
influence of a succession of disasters, suddenly doubled, rising to
one in every 5,500,000; and then again in 1877, a year of peculiar
exemption, it fell off to one in every 50,000,000.The percentage of
fatal casualties to the whole number carried was in 1847-9 five fold
what it was in 1878.If such fluctuations reveal themselves in the
statistics of Great Britain, those met with in the narrower field of
a single state in this country might well seem at first glance to
set all computation at defiance.During the ten years, for example,
between 1861 and 1870, about 200,000,000 passengers were returned
as carried on the Massachusetts roads, with 135 cases of injury to
individuals.Then came the year of the Revere disaster, and out of
26,000,000 carried, no less than 115 were killed or injured.Seven
years of comparative immunity then ensued, during which, out of
240,000,000 carried, but two were killed and forty-five injured.In other words, through a period of ten years the casualties were
approximately as one to 1,500,000; then during a single year they
rose to one in 250,000, or a seven-fold increase; and then through
a period of seven years they diminished to one in 3,400,000, a
decrease of about ninety per cent.Taking, however, the very worst of years,--the year of the
Revere disaster, which stands unparalleled in the history of
Massachusetts,--it will yet be found that the answer to the question
as to the length of the average railroad journey resulting in death
or in injury will be expressed, not in thousands nor in hundreds
of thousands of miles, but in millions.During that year some
26,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the limits of the
state, and each journey averaged a distance of about 13 miles.It
would seem, therefore, that, even in that year, the average journey
resulting in death was 11,000,000 miles, while that resulting either
in death or personal injury was not less than 3,300,000.The year 1871, however, represented by no means a fair average.On the contrary, it indicated what may fairly be considered an
excessive degree of danger, exciting nervous apprehensions in the
breasts of those even who were not constitutionally timid.To reach
what may be considered a normal average, therefore, it would be
more proper to include a longer period in the computation.Take,
for instance, the nine years, 1871-79, during which alone has
any effort been made to reach statistical accuracy in respect to
Massachusetts railroad accidents.During those nine years, speaking
in round numbers and making no pretence at anything beyond a
general approximation, some 303,000,000 passenger journeys of 13
miles each have been made on the railroads and within the state.Of these 51 have resulted in death and 308 in injuries to persons
from causes over which they had no control.The average distance,
therefore, traveled by all, before death happened to any one, was
about 80,000,000 miles, and that travelled before any one was either
injured or killed was about 10,800,000.The Revere disaster of 1871, however, as has been seen, brought
about important changes in the methods of operating the railroads
of Massachusetts.Consequently the danger incident to railroad
traveling was materially reduced; and in the next eight years
(1872-9) some 274,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the
limits of the state.The Wollaston disaster of October, 1878, was
included in this period, during which 223 persons were injured and
21 were killed.The average journey for these years resulting in any
injury to a passenger was close upon 15,000,000 miles, while that
resulting in death was 170,000,000.But it may fairly be asked,--What, after all, do these figures
mean?--They are, indeed, so large as to exceed comprehension; for,
after certain comparatively narrow limits are passed the practical
infinite is approached, and the mere adding of a few more ciphers
after a numeral conveys no new idea.On the contrary, the piling up
of figures rather tends to weaken than to strengthen a statement,
for to many it suggests an idea of ridiculous exaggeration.Indeed,
when a few years ago a somewhat similar statement to that just made
was advanced in an official report, a critic undertook to expose
the fallacy of it in the columns of a daily paper by referring to a
case within the writer's own observation in which a family of three
persons had been killed on their very first journey in a railroad
car.It is not, of course, necessary to waste time over such a
criticism as this.Railroad accidents continually take place, and
in consequence of them people are killed and injured, and of these
there may well be some who are then making their first journey by
rail; but in estimating the dangers of railroad traveling the much
larger number who are not killed or injured at all must likewise be
taken into consideration.Any person as he may be reading this page
in a railroad car may be killed or injured through some accident,
even while his eye is glancing over the figures which show how
infinitesimal his danger is; but the chances are none the less as a
million to one that any particular reader will go down to his grave
uninjured by any accident on the rail, unless it be occasioned by
his or her own carelessness.Admitting, therefore, that ill luck or hard fortune must fall to
the lot of certain unascertainable persons, yet the chances of
incurring that ill fortune are so small that they are not materially
increased by any amount of traveling which can be accomplished
within the limits of a human life.So far from exhausting a fair
average immunity from accident by constant traveling, the statistics
of Massachusetts during the last eight years would seem to indicate
that if any given person were born upon a railroad car, and remained
upon it traveling 500 miles a day all his life, he would, with
average good fortune, be somewhat over 80 years of age before he
would be involved in any accident resulting in his death or personal
injury, while he would attain the highly respectable age of 930
years before being killed.Even supposing that the most exceptional
average of the Revere year became usual, a man who was killed by
an accident at 70 years of age should, unless he were fairly to be
accounted unlucky, have accomplished a journey of some 440 miles
every day of his life, Sundays included, from the time of his birth
to that of his death; while even to have brought him within the
fair liability of any injury at all, his daily journey should have
been some 120 miles.Under the conditions of the last eight years
his average daily journey through the three score years and ten to
entitle him to be killed in an accident at the end of them would be
about 600 miles.THE RAILROAD DEATH RATE.In connection with the statistics of railroad casualties it is not
without interest to examine the general vital statistics of some
considerable city, for they show clearly enough what a large degree
of literal truth there was in the half jocose proposition attributed
to John Bright, that the safest place in which a man could put
himself was inside a first-class railroad carriage of a train in
full motion.Take the statistics of Boston, for instance, for the
year 1878.During the four years 1875-8, it will be remembered, a
single passenger only was killed on the railroads of Massachusetts
in consequence of an accident to which he by his own carelessness
in no way contributed.[27] The average number of persons annually
injured, not fatally, during those years was about five.[27] This period did not include the Wollaston disaster, as the
  Massachusetts railroad year closes on the last day of September.The
  Wollaston disaster occurred on the 8th of October, 1878, and was
  accordingly included in the next railroad year.Yet during the year 1878, excluding all cases of mere injury of
which no account was made, no less than 53 persons came to their
deaths in Boston from falling down stairs, and 37 more from falling
out of windows; seven were scalded to death in 1878 alone.In the
year 1874 seventeen were killed by being run over by teams in
the streets, while the pastime of coasting was carried on at a
cost of ten lives more.During the five years 1874-8 there were
more persons murdered in the city of Boston alone than lost their
lives as passengers through the negligence of all the railroad
corporations in the whole state of Massachusetts during the nine
years 1871-8; though in those nine years were included both the
Revere and the Wollaston disasters, the former of which resulted
in the death of 29, and the latter of 21 persons.Neither are the
comparative results here stated in any respect novel or peculiar
to Massachusetts.Years ago it was officially announced in France
that people were less safe in their own houses than while traveling
on the railroads; and, in support of this somewhat startling
proposition, statistics were produced showing fourteen cases of
death of persons remaining at home and there falling over carpets,
or, in the case of females, having their garments catch fire, to ten
deaths on the rail.Even the game of cricket counted eight victims
to the railroad's ten.It will not, of course, be inferred that the cases of death or
injury to passengers from causes beyond their control include
by any means all the casualties involved in the operation of the
railroad system.On the contrary, they include but a very small
portion of them.The experience of the Massachusetts roads during
the seven years between September 30, 1871, and September 30,
1878, may again be cited in reference to this point.During that
time there were but 52 cases of injury to passengers from causes
over which they had no control, but in connection with the entire
working of the railroad system no less than 1,900 cases of injury
were reported, of which 1,008 were fatal; an average of 144 deaths a
year.Of these cases, naturally, a large proportion were employés,
whose occupation not only involves much necessary risk, but whose
familiarity with risk causes them always to incur it even in the
most unnecessary and foolhardy manner.During the seven years 293
of them were killed and 375 were reported as injured.Nor is it
supposed that the list included by any means all the cases of injury
which occurred.About one half of the accidents to employés are
occasioned by their falling from the trains when in motion, usually
from freight trains and in cold weather, and from being crushed
between cars while engaged in coupling them together.From this last
cause alone an average of 27 casualties are annually reported.One
fact, however, will sufficiently illustrate how very difficult it is
to protect this class of men from danger, or rather from themselves.As is well known, on freight trains they are obliged to ride on the
tops of the cars; but these are built so high that their roofs come
dangerously near the bottoms of the highway bridges, which cross
the track sometimes in close proximity to each other.Accordingly
many unfortunate brakemen were killed by being knocked off the
trains as they passed under these bridges.With a view to affording
the utmost possible protection against this form of accident, a
statute was passed by the Massachusetts legislature compelling the
corporations to erect guards at a suitable distance from every
overhead bridge which was less than eighteen feet in the clear
above the track.These guards were so arranged as to swing lightly
across the tops of the cars, giving any one standing upon them a
sharp rap, warning him of the danger he was in.This warning rap,
however, so annoyed the brakemen that the guards were on a number of
the roads systematically destroyed as often as they were put up; so
that at last another law had to be passed, making their destruction
a criminal offense.The brakemen themselves resisted the attempt
to divest their perilous occupation of one of its most insidious
dangers.In this respect, however, brakemen differ in no degree from the
rest of the community.On all hands railroad accidents seem to
be systematically encouraged, and the wonder is that the list of
casualties is not larger.In Massachusetts, for instance, even in
the most crowded portions of the largest cities and towns, not
only do the railroads cross the highways at grade, but whenever new
thoroughfares are laid out the people of the neighborhood almost
invariably insist upon their crossing the railroads at a grade
and not otherwise.Not but that, upon theory and in the abstract,
every one is opposed to grade-crossings; but those most directly
concerned always claim that their particular crossing is exceptional
in character.In vain do corporations protest and public officials
argue; when the concrete case arises all neighborhoods become alike
and strenuously insist on their right to incur everlasting danger
rather than to have the level of their street broken.During the
last seven years to September 30, 1878, 191 persons have been
injured, and 98 of them fatally injured, at these crossings in
Massachusetts, and it is certain as fate that the number is destined
to annually increase.What the result in a remote future will be, it
is not now easy to forecast.One thing only would seem certain: the
time will come when the two classes of traffic thus recklessly made
to cross each other will at many points have to be separated, no
matter at what cost to the community which now challenges the danger
it will then find itself compelled to avoid.The heaviest and most regular cause of death and injury involved
in the operation of the railroad system yet remains to be referred
to; and again it is recklessness which is at the root of it, and
this time recklessness in direct violation of law.The railroad
tracks are everywhere favorite promenades, and apparently even
resting-places, especially for those who are more or less drunk.In Great Britain physical demolition by a railroad train is also a
somewhat favorite method of committing suicide, and that, too, in
the most deliberate and cool-blooded manner.Cases have not been
uncommon in which persons have been seen to coolly lay themselves
down in front of an advancing train, and very neatly effect their
own decapitation by placing their necks across the rail.In England
alone, during the last seven years, there have been no less than 280
cases of death reported under the head of suicides, or an average
of 40 each year, the number in 1878 rising to 60.In America these
cases are not returned in a class by themselves.Under the general
head of accidents to trespassers, however, that is, accidents to
men, women and children, especially the latter, illegally lying,
walking, or playing on the tracks or riding upon the cars,--under
this head are regularly classified more than one third of all
the casualties incident to working the Massachusetts railroads.During the last seven years these have amounted to an aggregate
of 724 cases of injury, no less than 494 of which were fatal.Of
course, very many other cases of this description, which were not
fatal, were never reported.And here again the recklessness of the
public has received further illustration, and this time in a very
unpleasant way.Certain corporations operating roads terminating
in Boston endeavored at one time to diminish this slaughter by
enforcing the laws against walking on railroad tracks.A few
trespassers were arrested and fined, and then the resentment of
those whose wonted privileges were thus interfered with began to
make itself felt.Obstructions were found placed in the way of night
trains.The mere attempt to keep people from risking their lives
by getting in the way of locomotives placed whole trains full of
passengers in imminent jeopardy.Undoubtedly, however, by far the most effective means of keeping
railroad tracks from becoming foot-paths, and thus at once putting
an end to the largest item in the grand total of the expenditure
of life incident to the operation of railroads, is that secured
by the Pennsylvania railroad as an unintentional corollary to its
method of ballasting.That superb organization, every detail of
whose wonderful system is a fit subject for study to all interested
in the operation of railroads, has a roadway peculiar to itself.A principal feature in this is a surface of broken stone ballast,
covering not only the space between the rails, but also the interval
between the tracks as well as the road-bed on the outside of each
track for a distance of some three feet.It resembles nothing so
much as a newly macadamized highway.That, too, is its permanent
condition.To walk on the sharp and uneven edges of this broken
stone is possible, with a sufficient expenditure of patience and
shoe-leather; but certainly no human being would ever walk there
from preference, or if any other path could be found.Not only is
it in itself, as a system of ballasting, looked upon as better than
any other, but it confounds the tramp.Its systematic adoption in
crowded, suburban neighborhoods would, therefore, answer a double
purpose.It would secure to the corporations permanent road-beds
exclusively for their own use, and obviate the necessity of arrests
or futile threats to enforce the penalties of the law against
trespassers.It seems singular that this most obvious and effective
way of putting a stop to what is both a nuisance and a danger has
not yet been resorted to by men familiar with the use of spikes and
broken glass on the tops of fences and walls.Meanwhile, taken even in its largest aggregate, the loss of life
incident to the working of the railroad system is not excessive, nor
is it out of proportion to what might reasonably be expected.It is
to be constantly borne in mind, not only that the railroad performs
a great function in modern life, but that it also and of necessity
performs it in a very dangerous way.A practically irresistible
force crashing through the busy hive of modern civilization at a
wild rate of speed, going hither and thither, across highways and
by-ways and along a path which is in itself a thoroughfare,--such an
agency cannot be expected to work incessantly and yet never to come
in contact with the human frame.Naturally, however, it might be a
very car of Juggernaut.Is it so in fact?--To demonstrate that it
is not, it is but necessary again to recur to the comparison between
the statistics of railroad accidents and those which necessarily
occur in the experience of all considerable cities.Take again those
of Boston and of the railroad system of Massachusetts.These for the
purpose of illustration are as good as any, and in their results
would only be confirmed in the experience of Paris as compared with
the railroad system of France, or in that of London as compared with
the railroad system of Great Britain.During the eight years between
September 30, 1870, and September 30, 1878, the entire railroad
system of Massachusetts was operated at a cost of 1,165 lives, apart
from all cases of injury which did not prove fatal.The returns in
this respect also may be accepted as reasonably accurate, as the
deaths were all returned, though the cases of merely personal injury
probably were not.During the ten
years, 1868-78, 2,587 cases of death from accidental causes, or 259
a year, were recorded as having taken place in the city of Boston.In other words, the annual average of deaths by accident in the city
of Boston alone exceeds that consequent on running all the railroads
of the state by eighty per cent.Unless, therefore, the railroad
system is to be considered as an exception to all other functions of
modern life, and as such is to be expected to do its work without
injury to life or limb, this showing does not constitute a very
heavy indictment against it.AMERICAN AS COMPARED WITH FOREIGN RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.Up to this point, the statistics and experience of Massachusetts
only have been referred to.This is owing to the fact that the
railroad returns of that state are more carefully prepared and
tabulated than are those of any other state, and afford, therefore,
more satisfactory data from which to draw conclusions.The
territorial area from which the statistics are in this case derived
is very limited, and it yet remains to compare the results deduced
from them with those derived from the similar experience of other
communities.This, however, is not an easy thing to do; and, while
it is difficult enough as respects Europe, it is even more difficult
as respects America taken as a whole.This last fact is especially
unfortunate in view of the circumstance that, in regard to railway
accidents, the United States, whether deservedly or not, enjoy a
most undesirable reputation.Foreign authorities have a way of
referring to our "well-known national disregard of human life," with
a sort of complacency, at once patronizing and contemptuous, which
is the reverse of pleasing.Judging by the tone of their comments,
the natural inference would be that railroad disasters of the worst
description were in America matters of such frequent occurrence
as to excite scarcely any remark.As will presently be made very
apparent, this impression, for it is only an impression, can, so
far as the country as a whole is concerned, neither be proved nor
disproved, from the absence of sufficient data from which to argue.As respects Massachusetts, however, and the same statement may
perhaps be made of the whole belt of states north of the Potomac and
the Ohio, there is no basis for it.There is no reason to suppose
that railroad traveling is throughout that region accompanied by any
peculiar or unusual degree of danger.The great difficulty, just referred to, in comparing the results
deduced from equally complete statistics of different countries,
lies in the variety of the arbitrary rules under which the
computations in making them up are effected.As an example in
point, take the railroad returns of Great Britain and those of
Massachusetts.They are in each case prepared with a great deal
of care, and the results deduced from them may fairly be accepted
as approximately correct.As respects accidents, the number of
cases of death and of personal injury are annually reported, and
with tolerable completeness, though in the latter respect there is
probably in both cases room for improvement.The whole comparison
turns, however, on the way in which the entire number of passengers
annually carried is computed.In Great Britain, for instance, in
1878, these were returned, using round numbers only, at 565,000,000,
and in Massachusetts at 34,000,000.By dividing these totals by
the number of cases of death and injury reported as occurring
to passengers from causes beyond their control, we shall arrive
apparently at a fair comparative showing as to the relative safety
of railroad traveling in the two communities.The result for that
particular year would have been that while in Great Britain one
passenger in each 23,500,000 was killed, and one in each 481,600
injured from causes beyond their control, in Massachusetts none
were killed and only one in each 14,000,000 was in any way injured.Unfortunately, however, a closer examination reveals a very great
error in the computation, affecting every comparative result drawn
from it.In the English returns no allowance whatever is made
for the very large number of journeys made by season-ticket or
commutation passengers, while in Massachusetts, on the contrary,
each person of this class enters into the grand total as making two
trips each day, 156 trips on each quarterly ticket, and 626 trips on
each annual.Now in 1878 more than 418,000 holders of season tickets
were returned by the railway companies of Great Britain.How many
of these were quarterly and how many were annual travelers, does not
appear.If they were all annual travelers, no less than 261,000,000
journeys should be added to the 565,000,000 in the returns, in order
to arrive at an equal basis for a comparison between the foreign
and the American roads: this method, however, would be manifestly
inaccurate, so it only remains, in the absence of all reliable data,
and for the purpose of comparison solely, to strike out from the
Massachusetts returns the 8,320,727 season-ticket passages, which at
once reduces by over 3,000,000 the number of journeys to each case
of injury.As season-ticket passengers do travel and are exposed to
danger in the same degree as trip-ticket passengers, no result is
approximately accurate which leaves them out of the computation.At
present, however, the question relates not to the positive danger or
safety of traveling by rail, but to its relative danger in different
communities.Allowance for this discrepancy can, however, be made by adding to
the English official results an additional nineteen per cent., that,
according to the returns of 1877 and 1878, being the proportion
of the season-ticket to other passengers on the roads of Great
Britain.Taking then the Board of Trade returns for the eight
years 1870-7, it will be found that during this period about one
passenger in each 14,500,000 carried in that country has been killed
in railroad accidents, and about one in each 436,000 injured.This may be assumed as a fair average for purpose of comparison,
though it ought to be said that in Great Britain the percentage of
casualties to passengers shows a decided tendency to decrease, and
during the years 1877-8 the percentages of killed fell from one in
15,000,000 to one in 38,000,000 and those of injured from one in
436,000 to one in 766,000.The aggregates from which these results
are deduced are so enormous, rising into the thousands of millions,
that a certain degree of reliance can be placed on them.In the
case of Massachusetts, however, the entire period during which the
statistics are entitled to the slightest weight includes only eight
years, 1872-9, and offers an aggregate of but 274,000,000 journeys,
or but about forty per cent.of those included in the British
returns of the single year 1878.During these years the killed in
Massachusetts were one in each 13,000,000 and the injured one in
each 1,230,000;--or, while the killed in the two cases were very
nearly in the same proportion,--respectively one in 14.5, and one in
13, speaking in millions,--the British injured were really three to
one of the Massachusetts.The equality as respects the killed in this comparison, and the
marked discrepancy as respects the injured is calculated at first
sight to throw doubts on the fullness of the Massachusetts returns.There seems no good reason why the injured should in the one case
be so much more numerous than in the other.This, however, is
susceptible on closer examination of a very simple and satisfactory
explanation.In case of accident the danger of sustaining slight
personal injury is not so great in Massachusetts as in Great
Britain.This is due to the heavier and more solid construction
of the American passenger coaches, and their different interior
arrangement.This fact, and the real cause of the large number of
slightly injured,--"shaken" they call it,--in the English railroad
accidents is made very apparent in the following extract from Mr.Calcroft's report for 1877;--

     "It is no doubt a fact that collisions and other accidents to
     railway trains are attended with less serious consequences
     in proportion to the solidity of construction of passenger
     carriages.The accomodation and internal arrangements of
     third-class carriages, however, especially those used in
     ordinary trains, are defective as regards safety and comfort,
     as compared with many carriages of the same class on foreign
     railways.The first-class passenger, except when thrown against
     his opposite companion, or when some luggage falls upon him, is
     generally saved from severe contusion by the well-stuffed or
     padded linings of the carriages; whilst the second-class and
     third-class passenger is generally thrown with violence against
     the hard wood-work.If the second and third-class carriages
     had a high padded back lining, extending above the head of the
     passenger, it would probably tend to lesson the danger to life
     and limb which, as the returns of accidents show, passengers
     in carriages of this class are much exposed to in train
     accidents."[28]

 [28] _General Report to the Board of Trade upon the accidents which
  have occurred on the Railways of the United Kingdom during the year
  1877, p.37._

In 1878 the passenger journeys made in the second and third class
carriages of the United Kingdom were thirteen to one of those made
in first class carriages;--or, expressed in millions, there were
but 41 of the latter to 523 of the former.There can be very little
question indeed that if, during the last ten years, thirteen out
of fourteen of the passengers on Massachusetts railroads had been
carried in narrow compartments with wooden seats and unlined sides
the number of those returned as slightly injured in the numerous
accidents which occurred would have been at least three-fold larger
than it was.If it had not been ten-fold larger it would have been
surprising.The foregoing comparison, relates however, simply to passengers
killed in accidents for which they are in no degree responsible.When, however, the question reverts to the general cost in life
and limb at which the railroad systems are worked and the railroad
traffic is carried on to the entire communities served, the
comparison is less favorable to Massachusetts.Taking the eight
years of 1871-8, the British returns include 30,641 cases of injury,
and 9,113 of death; while those of Massachusetts for the same
years included 1,165 deaths, with only 1,044 cases of injury; in
the one case a total of 39,745 casualties, as compared with 2,209
the other.It will, however be noticed that while in the British
returns the cases of injury are nearly three-fold those of death, in
the Massachusetts returns the deaths exceed the cases of injury.This fact in the present case cannot but throw grave suspicion
on the completeness of the Massachusetts returns.As a matter of
practical experience it is well known that cases of injury almost
invariably exceed those of death, and the returns in which the
disproportion is greatest, if no sufficient explanation presents
itself, are probably the most full and reliable.Taking, therefore,
the deaths in the two cases as the better basis for comparison, it
will be found that the roads of Great Britain in the grand result
accomplished seventeen-fold the work of those of Massachusetts with
less than eight times as many casualties; had the proportion between
the results accomplished and the fatal injuries inflicted been
maintained, but 536 deaths instead of 1,165 would have appeared in
the Massachusetts returns.The reason of this difference in result
is worth looking for, and fortunately the statistical tables are
in both cases carried sufficiently into detail to make an analysis
possible; and this analysis, when made, seems to indicate very
clearly that while, for those directly connected with the railroads,
either as passengers or as employés, the Massachusetts system
in its working involves relatively a less degree of danger than
that of Great Britain, yet for the outside community it involves
very much more.Take, for instance, the two heads of accidents
at grade-crossings and accidents to trespassers, which have been
already referred to.In Great Britain highway grade-crossings
are discouraged.The results of the policy pursued may in each case be read
with sufficient distinctness in the bills of mortality.During the
years 1872-7, of 1,929 casualties to persons on the railroads of
Massachusetts, no less than 200 occurred at highway grade crossings.Had the accidents of this description in Great Britain been equally
numerous in proportion to the larger volume of the traffic of that
country, they would have resulted in over 3,000 cases of death or
personal injury; they did in fact result in 586 such cases.In
Massachusetts, again, to walk at will on any part of a railroad
track is looked upon as a sort of prescriptive and inalienable
right of every member of the community, irrespective of age, sex,
color, or previous condition of servitude.Accordingly, during the
six years referred to, this right was exercised at the cost of life
or limb to 591 persons,--one in four of all the casualties which
occurred in connection with the railroad system.In Great Britain
the custom of using the tracks of railroads as a foot-path seems to
exist, but, so far from being regarded as a right, it is practiced
in perpetual terror of the law.Accordingly, instead of some 9,000
cases of death or injury from this cause during these six years,
which would have been the proportion under like conditions in
Massachusetts, the returns showed only 2,379.These two are among
the most constant and fruitful causes of accident in connection with
the railroad system of America.In great Britain their proportion
to the whole number of casualties which take place is scarcely a
seventh part of what it is in Massachusetts.Here they constitute
very nearly fifty per cent.of all the accidents which occur; there
they constitute but a little over seven.There is in this comparison
a good deal of solid food for legislative thought, if American
legislators would but take it in; for this is one matter the public
policy in regard to which can only be fixed by law.When we pass from Great Britain to the continental countries of
Europe, the difficulties in the way of any fair comparison of
results become greater and greater.The statistics do not enter
sufficiently into detail, nor is the basis of computation apparent.It is generally conceded that, where a due degree of caution is
exercised by the passenger, railroad traveling in continental
countries is attended with a much less degree of danger than in
England.When we come to the returns, they hardly bear out this
conclusion; at least to the degree commonly supposed.Nowhere is human life more carefully guarded than in
that country; yet their returns show that of 866,000,000 passengers
transported on the French railroads during the eleven years 1859-69,
no less than 65 were killed and 1,285 injured from causes beyond
their control; or one in each 13,000,000 killed as compared with one
in 10,700,000 in Great Britain; and one in every 674,000 injured
as compared with one in each 330,000 in the other country.During
the single year 1859, about 111,000,000 passengers were carried
on the French lines, at a general cost to the community of 2,416
casualties, of which 295 were fatal.In Massachusetts, during the
four years 1871-74, about 95,000,000 passengers were carried, at
a reported cost of 1,158 casualties.This showing might well be
considered favorable to Massachusetts did not the single fact that
her returns included more than twice as many deaths as the French,
with only a quarter as many injuries, make it at once apparent that
the statistics were at fault.Under these circumstances comparison
could only be made between the numbers of deaths reported; which
would indicate that, in proportion to the work done, the railroad
operations of Massachusetts involved about twice and a half more
cases of injury to life and limb than those of the French service.As respects Great Britain the comparison is much more favorable, the
returns showing an almost exactly equal general death-rate in the
two countries in proportion to their volumes of traffic; the volume
of Great Britain being about four times that of France, while its
death-rate by railroad accidents was as 1,100 to 295.With the exception of Belgium, however, in which country the
returns cover only the lines operated by the state, the basis
hardly exists for a useful comparison between the dangers of injury
from accident on the continental railroads and on those of Great
Britain and America.The several systems are operated on wholly
different principles, to meet the needs of communities between
whose modes of life and thought little similarity exists.The
continental trains are far less crowded than either the English or
the American, and, when accidents occur, fewer persons are involved
in them.The movement, also, goes on under much stricter regulation
and at lower rates of speed, so that there is a grain of truth in
the English sarcasm that on a German railway "it almost seems as
if beer-drinking at the stations were the principal business, and
traveling a mere accessory."Limiting, therefore, the comparison to the railroads of Great
Britain, it remains to be seen whether the evil reputation of the
American roads as respects accidents is wholly deserved.Is it
indeed true that the danger to a passenger's life and limbs is so
much greater in this country than elsewhere?--Locally, and so far
as Massachusetts at least is concerned, it certainly is not.How
is it with the country taken as a whole?--The lack of all reliable
statistics as respects this wide field of inquiry has already been
referred to.We do not know with
accuracy even the number of miles of road operated; much less the
number of passengers annually carried.As respects accidents, and
the deaths and injuries resulting therefrom, some information may be
gathered from a careful and very valuable, because the only record
which has been preserved during the last six years in the columns of
the _Railroad Gazette_.It makes, of course, no pretence at either
official accuracy or fullness, but it is as complete probably as
circumstances will permit of its being made.During the five years
1874-8 there have been included in this record 4,846 accidents,
resulting in 1,160 deaths and 4,650 cases of injury;--being an
average of 969 accidents a year, resulting in 232 deaths and 930
cases of injury.These it will be remembered are casualties directly
resulting either to passengers or employés from train accidents.No account is taken of injuries sustained by employés in the
ordinary operation of the roads, or by members of the community
not passengers.In Massachusetts the accidents to passengers and
employés constitute one-half of the whole, but a very small portion
of the injuries reported as sustained by either passengers or
employés are the consequence of train accidents,--not one in three
in the case of passengers or one in seven in that of employés.In
fact, of the 2,350 accidents to persons reported in Massachusetts
in the nine years 1870-8, but 271, or less than twelve per cent.,
belonged to the class alone included in the reports of the _Railroad
Gazette_.In England during the four years 1874-7 the proportion
was larger, being about twenty-five instead of twelve per cent.For
America at large the Massachusetts proportion is undoubtedly the
most nearly correct, and the probabilities would seem to be that
the annual average of injuries to persons incident to operating the
railroads of the United States is not less than 10,000, of which at
least 1,200 are due to train accidents.Of these about two-thirds
may be set down as sustained by passengers, or, approximately, 800 a
year.It remains to be ascertained what proportion this number bears to
the whole number carried.There are no reliable statistics on this
head any more than on the other.Nothing but an approximation of
the most general character is possible.The number of passengers
annually carried on the roads of a few of the states is reported
with more or less accuracy, and averaging these the result would
seem to indicate that there are certainly not more than 350,000,000
passengers annually carried on the roads of all the states.There
is something barbarous about such an approximation, and it is
disgraceful that at this late day we should in America be forced
to estimate the passenger movement on our railroads in much the
same way that we guess at the population of Africa.We are in this respect far in the rear of civilized
communities.Taking, however, 350,000,000 as a fair approximation
to our present annual passenger movement, it will be observed that
it is as nearly as may be half that of Great Britain.In Great
Britain, in 1878, there were 1,200 injuries to passengers from
accidents to trains, and 675 in 1877.The average of the last eight
years has been 1,226.If, therefore, the approximation of 800 a
year for America is at all near the truth, the percentage would seem
to be considerably larger than that arrived at from the statistics
of Great Britain.Meanwhile it is to be noted that while in Great
Britain about 25 cases of injury are reported to each one of death,
in America but four cases are reported to each death--a discrepancy
which is extremely suggestive.Perhaps, however, the most valuable
conclusion to be drawn from these figures is that in America we as
yet are absolutely without any reliable railroad statistics on this
subject at all.Taken as a whole, however, and under the most favorable showing,
it would seem to be a matter of fair inference that the dangers
incident to railroad traveling are materially greater in the United
States than in any country of Europe.How much greater is a question
wholly impossible to answer.So that when a statistical writer
undertakes to show, as one eminent European authority has done, that
in a given year on the American roads one passenger in every 286,179
was killed, and one in every 90,737 was injured, it is charitable
to suppose that in regard to America only is he indebted to his
imagination for his figures.Neither is it possible to analyze with any satisfactory degree of
precision the nature of the accidents in the two countries, with
a view to drawing inferences from them.Without attempting to do
so it maybe said that the English Board of Trade reports for the
last five years, 1874-8, include inquiries into 755 out of 11,585
accidents, the total number of every description reported as having
taken place.Meanwhile the _Railroad Gazette_ contains mention of
4,846 reported train accidents which occurred in America during
the same five years.Of these accidents, 1,310 in America and 81
in Great Britain were due to causes which were either unexplained
or of a miscellaneous character, or are not common to the systems
of the two countries.In so far as the remainder admitted of
classification, it was somewhat as follows:--

  [29] During these five years there were in Great Britain four cases
  of collision between locomotives or trains at level crossings of one
  railroad by another; in America there were 79.The probable cause of
  this discrepancy has already been referred to (_ante pp.The above record, though almost valueless for any purpose of exact
comparison, reveals, it will be noticed, one salient fact.Out of
755 English accidents, no less than 406 came under the head of
collisions--whether head collisions, rear collisions, or collisions
on sidings or at junctions.In other words, to collisions of some
sort between trains were due considerably more than half (54 per
cent.)of the accidents which took place in Great Britain, while
only 88, or less than 13 per cent.of the whole, were due to
derailments from all causes.In America on the other hand, while
of the 3,763 accidents recorded, 1,324, or but one-third part (35
per cent.)were due to collisions, no less than 586, or 24 per
cent., were classed under the head of derailments, due to defects
in the permanent way.During the the six years 1873-8 there were
in all 1698 cases of collision of every description between trains
reported as occurring in America to 1495 in the United Kingdom; but
while in America the derailments amounted to no less than 4016, or
more than twice the collisions, in the United Kingdom they were
but 817, or a little more than half their number.It has already
been noticed that the most disastrous accidents in America are apt
to occur on bridges, and Ashtabula and Tariffville at once suggest
themselves.Under the heading
of "Failures of Tunnels, Bridges, Viaducts or Culverts," there
were returned in that country during the six years 1873-8 only 29
accidents in all; while during the same time in America, under the
heads of broken bridges or tressels and open draws, the _Gazette_
recorded no less than 165.These figures curiously illustrate the
different manner in which the railroads of the two countries have
been constructed, and the different circumstances under which they
are operated.The English collisions are distinctly traceable to
constant overcrowding; the American derailments and bridge accidents
to inferior construction of our road-beds.Finally, what of late years has been done to diminish the dangers
of the rail?--What more can be done?--Few persons realize what a
tremendous pressure in this respect is constantly bearing down upon
those whose business it is to operate railroads.A great accident is
not only a terrible blow to the pride and prestige of a corporation,
not only does it practically ruin the unfortunate officials involved
in it, but it entails also portentous financial consequences.Juries
proverbially have little mercy for railroad corporations, and, when
a disaster comes, these have practically no choice but to follow the
scriptural injunction to settle with their adversaries quickly.The
Revere catastrophe, for instance, cost the railroad company liable
on account of it over half a million of dollars; the Ashtabula
accident over $600,000; the Wollaston over $300,000.A few years ago
in England a jury awarded a sum of $65,000 for damages sustained
through the death of a single individual.During the five years,
1867-71, the railroad corporations of Great Britain paid out over
$11,000,000 in compensation for damages occasioned by accidents.In
view, merely, of such money consequences of disaster, it would be
most unnatural did not each new accident lead to the adoption of
better appliances to prevent its recurrence.[30]

  [30] The other side of this proposition has been argued with
  much force by Mr.William Galt in his report as one of the Royal
  Commission of 1874 on Railway Accidents.Galt's individual
  report bears date February 5, 1877, and in it he asserts that, as
  a matter of actual experience, the principle of self-interest on
  the part of the railway companies has proved a wholly insufficient
  safeguard against accidents.However it may be in theory, he
  contends that, taking into consideration the great cost of the
  appliances necessary to insure safety to the public on the one side,
  and the amount of damages incident to a certain degree of risk on
  the other side, the possible saving in expenditure to the companies
  by assuming the risk far exceeds the loss incurred by an occasional
  accident.The companies become, in a word, insurers of their
  passengers,--the premium being found in the economies effected by
  not adopting improved appliances of recognized value, and the losses
  being the damages incurred in case of accident.He treats the whole
  subject at great length and with much knowledge and ability.His
  report is a most valuable compendium for those who are in favor of a
  closer government supervision over railroads as a means of securing
  an increased safety from accident.To return, however, to the subject of railroad accidents, and the
final conclusion to be drawn from the statistics which have been
presented.That conclusion briefly stated is that the charges of
recklessness and indifference so generally and so widely advanced
against those managing the railroads cannot for an instant be
sustained.After all, as was said in the beginning of the present
volume, it is not the danger but the safety of the railroad which
should excite our special wonder.If any one doubts this, it is
very easy to satisfy himself of the fact,--that is, if by nature
he is gifted with the slightest spark of imagination.It is but
necessary to stand once on the platform of a way-station and to
look at an express train dashing by.There are few sights finer;
few better calculated to quicken the pulse.The glare of the head-light, the rush and throb of the
locomotive,--the connecting rod and driving-wheels of which seem
instinct with nervous life,--the flashing lamps in the cars, and
the final whirl of dust in which the red tail-lights vanish almost
as soon as they are seen,--all this is well calculated to excite
our admiration; but the special and unending cause for wonder is
how, in case of accident, anything whatever is left of the train.As it plunges into the darkness it would seem to be inevitable
that something must happen, and that, whatever happens, it must
necessarily involve both the train and every one in it in utter
and irremediable destruction.Here is a body weighing in the
neighborhood of two hundred tons, moving over the face of the earth
at a speed of sixty feet a second and held to its course only by two
slender lines of iron rails;--and yet it is safe!--We have seen how
when, half a century ago, the possibility of something remotely like
this was first discussed, a writer in the _British Quarterly_ earned
for himself a lasting fame by using the expression that "We should
as soon expect people to suffer themselves to be fired off upon
one of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as to trust themselves to the
mercy of such a machine, going at such a rate;"--while Lord Brougham
exclaimed that "the folly of seven hundred people going fifteen
miles an hour, in six trains, exceeds belief."At the time they
wrote, the chances were ninety-nine in a hundred that both reviewer
and correspondent were right; and yet, because reality, not for the
first nor the last time, saw fit to outstrip the wildest flights of
imagination, the former at least blundered, by being prudent, into
an immortality of ridicule.The thing, however, is still none the
less a miracle because it is with us matter of daily observation.That, indeed, is the most miraculous part of it.At all hours of the
day and of the night, during every season of the year, this movement
is going on.It depends for its even action
on every conceivable contingency, from the disciplined vigilance
of thousands of employés to the condition of the atmosphere, the
heat of an axle, or the strength of a nail.The vast machine is in
constant motion, and the derangement of a single one of a myriad of
conditions may at any moment occasion one of those inequalities of
movement which are known as accidents.Yet at the end of the year,
of the hundreds of millions of passengers fewer have lost their
lives through these accidents than have been murdered in cold blood.Not without reason, therefore, has it been asserted that, viewing
at once the speed, the certainty, and the safety with which the
intricate movement of modern life is carried on, there is no more
creditable monument to human care, human skill, and human foresight
than the statistics of railroad accidents.Abergele, accident at, 72.Accidents, railroad, about stations, 166.

Transcriber's note: The following has been moved from the beginning
of the book to the end.=By the same Author.=


=Railroads and Railroad Questions.= 12mo, cloth, $1 25.The volume
treats of "The Genesis of the Railroad System," "Accidents," and
the "Present Railroad Problem."The author has made himself the
acknowledged authority on this group of subjects.If his book goes
only to those who are interested in the ownership, the use, or the
administration of railroads, it is sure of a large circle of readers.--_Railway World._

"Characterized by broad, progressive, liberal ideas."--_Railway
Review._

"The entire conclusions are of great value."--_N.Y.In the
Lizard district the divisions of land are made not by fences, but by
walls, built in a peculiar fashion, half stones, half earth, varying
from six to ten feet high, and about two feet broad.On the top of this
narrow giddy path, fringed on either side by deceitful grass, you are
expected to walk!--in fact, are obliged to walk, for there is often no
other road.Once upon a time I could have walked upon
walls as well as anybody, but now--!"I'll help you, ma'am; and I'm sure you can manage it," said Charles
consolingly."It's only three-quarters of a mile."Three-quarters of a mile along a two-foot path on the top of a wall,
and in this deceitful light, when one false step would entail a certain
fall.And at my age one doesn't fall exactly like a feather or an
india-rubber ball."Ma'am, if you go slow and steady, with me before and Curgenven behind,
you'll _not_ fall."Nor did I. I record it with gratitude to those two honest men--true
_gentlemen_, such as I have found at times in all ranks--who never
once grumbled or relaxed in their care of their tardy and troublesome
charge; one instance more of that kindly courtesy which it does any
man good to offer, and which any woman, "lady" though she be, may feel
proud to receive.When we reached "home," as we had already begun to call it, a smiling
face and a comfortable tea justified the word.And when we retired,
a good deal fatigued, but quite happy, we looked out upon the night,
where the fiery stream of the Lizard Lights was contending with the
brightest of harvest moons.It was a hopeful ending of our second day.[Illustration: CORNISH FISH.]DAY THE THIRD


"And a beautiful day it is, ladies, though it won't do for Kynance."Only 8 a.m., yet there stood the faithful Charles, hat in hand, having
heard that his ladies were at breakfast, and being evidently anxious
that they should not lose an hour of him and his carriage, which were
both due at Falmouth to-night.For this day was Saturday, and we were
sending him home for Sunday."As I found out last night, the tide won't suit for Kynance till
Wednesday or Thursday, and you'll be too tired to walk much to-day.Suppose I were to drive you to Kennack
Sands, back by the serpentine works to Cadgwith, and home to dinner?Then after dinner I'll give the horse a rest for two hours, and take
you to Mullion; we can order tea at Mary Mundy's, and go on to the cove
as far as I can get with the carriage.I'll leave it at the farm and be
in time to help you over the rocks to see the caves, run ahead and meet
you again with the carriage, and drive you back to Mary Mundy's.You
can have tea and be home in the moonlight before nine o'clock."we asked, a good deal bewildered by this carefully-outlined
plan and all the strange names of places and people, yet not a little
touched by the kindly way in which we were "taken in and done for" by
our faithful squire of dames.Oh, after an hour or two's rest the horse can start
again--say at midnight, and be home by daylight.Or we could go to bed
and be up early at four, and still get to Falmouth by eight, in time
for the church work.Don't you trouble about us, we'll manage.He" (the
other and four-footed half of the "we") "is a capital animal, and he'd
get much harder work than this if he was at home."So we decided to put ourselves entirely in the hands of Charles,
who seemed to have our interest so much at heart, and yet evinced a
tenderness over his horse that is not too common among hired drivers.We promised to be ready in half an hour, so as to waste nothing of this
lovely day, in which we had determined to enjoy ourselves.It was delightful to wake up early and refreshed,
and come down to this sunshiny, cheerful breakfast-table, where, though
nothing was grand, all was thoroughly comfortable."I'm sure you're very kind, ladies, to be so pleased with everything,"
apologised our bright-looking handmaiden; "and since you really wish
to keep this room"--a very homely parlour which we had chosen in
preference to a larger one, because it looked on the sea--"I only wish
things was better for you; still, if you can make shift--"

Well, if travellers cannot "make shift" with perfectly clean tidy
rooms, well-cooked plain food, and more than civil, actually kindly,
attendance, they ought to be ashamed of themselves!So we declared we
would settle down in the evidently despised little parlour.The wall-paper and carpet
would have driven Morris and Co.nearly frantic; the furniture--mere
chairs and a table--belonged "to the year one"--but (better than many
modern chairs and tables) you could sit down upon the first and dine
upon the second, in safety.There was no sofa, so we gladly accepted
an offered easy-chair, and felt that all really useful things were now
ours.There was a paper arrangement in the grate, and
certain vases on the chimney-piece which literally made our hair stand
on end!After a private consultation as to how far we might venture,
without wounding the feelings of our landlady, we mildly suggested that
"perhaps we could do without these ornaments."All we wanted in their
stead were a few jars, salt-jars or jam-pots, in which to arrange our
wild flowers, of which yesterday the girls had gathered a quantity.The exchange was accepted, though with some surprise.But when, half
an hour afterwards, the parlour appeared quite transformed, decorated
in every available corner with brilliant autumn flowers--principally
yellow--intermixed with the lovely Cornish heath; when, on some excuse
or other, the hideous "ornament for your fire-stoves" was abolished,
and the grate filled with a mass of green fern and grey sea-holly--I
know no combination more exquisite both as to colour and form--then we
felt that we could survive, at least for a week, even if shut up within
this humble room, innocent of the smallest attraction as regarded art,
music, or literature.Literally swimming in sunshine, from the sparkling
sea in the distance, to the beds of marigolds close by--huge marigolds,
double and single, mingled with carnations that filled the air with
rich autumnal scent, all the more delicious because we feel it is
autumnal, and therefore cannot last.It was a very simple garden,
merely a square grass-plot with a walk and a border round it, and its
only flowers were these marigolds, carnations, with quantities of
mignonette, and bounded all round with a hedge of tamarisk; yet I think
we shall always remember it as if it were the Garden of Armida--without
a Tancred to spoil it!For--under the rose--one of the pleasures of our tour was that it was
so exclusively feminine.We could feed as we liked, dress as we liked,
talk to whom we liked, without any restriction, from the universal
masculine sense of dignity and decorum in travelling.We felt ourselves
unconventional, incognito, able to do exactly as we chose, provided we
did nothing wrong.So off we drove through Lizard Town into the "wide, wide world;" and
I repeat, what a world it was!Full filled with sunlight, and with an
atmosphere so fresh and bracing, yet so dry and mild and balmy, that
every breath was a pleasure to draw.We had felt nothing like it since
we stood on the top of the highest peak in the Island of Capri, looking
down on the blue Mediterranean.But this sea was equally blue, the sky
equally clear, yet it was home--dear old England, so often misprized.Yet, I believe, when one does get really fine English weather, there is
nothing like it in the whole world.The region we traversed was not picturesque--neither mountains, nor
glens, nor rivers, nor woods; all was level and bare, for the road lay
mostly inland, until we came out upon Kennack Sands.They might have been the very "yellow sands" where Shakespeare's elves
were bidden to "take hands" and "foot it featly here and there."You
might almost have searched for the sea-maids' footsteps along the
smooth surface where the long Atlantic waves crept harmlessly in,
making a glittering curve, and falling with a gentle "thud"--the only
sound in the solitary bay, until all at once we caught voices and
laughter, and from among some rock, emerged a party of girls.They had evidently come in a cart, which took up its station beside
our carriage, laden with bundles which looked uncommonly like bathing
gowns; and were now seeking a convenient dressing-room--one of
those rock-parlours, roofed with serpentine and floored with silver
sand--which are the sole bathing establishments here.All along the Cornish coast the bathing is delightful--when you can
get it; but sometimes for miles and miles the cliffs rise in a huge
impregnable wall, without a single break.Then perhaps there comes a
sudden cleft in the rock, a green descent, possibly with a rivulet
trickling through it, and leading to a sheltered cove or a sea-cave,
accessible only at low water, but one of the most delicious little
nooks that could be imagined.Kynance, we were told, with its "kitchen"
and "drawing-room," was the most perfect specimen of the kind; but
Kennack was sufficiently lovely.With all sorts of fun, shouting, and
laughter, the girls disappeared to their evidently familiar haunts, to
reappear as merry mermaids playing about in a crystalline sea.A most tantalising sight to my two, who vowed never again to attempt
a day's excursion without taking bathing dresses, towels, and the
inevitable fish-line, to be tied round the waist,--with a mother
holding the other end.For we had been warned against these long and
strong Atlantic waves, the recoil of which takes you off your feet even
in calm weather.As bathing must generally be done at low water, to
ensure a sandy floor and a comfortable cave, it is easy enough to be
swept out of one's depth; and the cleverest swimmer, if tossed about
among these innumerable rocks circled round by eddies of boiling white
water, would have small chance of returning with whole bones, or of
returning at all.Indeed, along this Cornish coast, life and death seem very near
together.Every pleasure carries with it a certain amount of risk; the
utmost caution is required both on land and sea, and I cannot advise
either rash or nervous people to go travelling in Cornwall.Bathing being impracticable, we consoled ourselves with ascending the
sandy hillock, which bounded one side of the bay, and sat looking from
it towards the coast-line eastwards.What a strange peace there is in a solitary shore, an empty sea, for
the one or two white dots of silent ships seemed rather to add to than
diminish its loneliness--lonelier in sunshine, I think, than even in
storm.The latter gives a sense of human life, of struggle and of
pain; while the former is all repose, the bright but solemn repose of
infinity or eternity.But these thoughts were for older heads; the only idea of the young
heads--uncommonly steady they must have been!--was of scrambling
into the most inaccessible places, and getting as near to the sea as
possible without actually tumbling into it.After a while the land
attracted them in turn, and they came back with their hands full of
flowers, some known, some unknown; great bunches of honeysuckle,
curious sand-plants, and cliff-plants; also water-plants, which fringed
a little rivulet that ran into the bay, while, growing everywhere
abundantly, was the lovely grey-green cringo, or sea-holly.All these treasures, to make the parlour pretty, required much
ingenuity to carry home safely, the sun withered them so fast.We could willingly have stayed here all day--how natural is that wish
of poor young Shelley, that in every pretty place he saw he might
remain "for ever"!--but the forenoon was passing, and we had much to
see."Poltesco, everybody goes to Poltesco," observed the patient Charles.At Poltesco are the principal
serpentine works--the one commerce of the district.The monotonous hum
of its machinery mingled oddly with the murmur of a trout-stream which
ran through the pretty little valley, crossed by a wooden bridge, where
a solitary angler stood fishing in imperturbable content.There were only about a dozen workmen visible; one of whom came
forward and explained to us the mode of work, afterwards taking us
to the show-room, which contained everything possible to be made of
serpentine, from mantelpieces and tombstones, down to brooches and
studs.Very delicate and beautiful was the workmanship; the forms of
some of the things--vases and candlesticks especially--were quite
Pompeian.In truth, throughout Cornwall, we often came upon shapes,
Roman or Greek, proving how even yet relics of its early masters or
colonisers linger in this western corner of England.When, as we passed, more than one busy
workman lifted up his head for a moment, we noticed faces almost
classic in type, quite different from the bovine, agricultural
Hodge of the midland counties.There was neither stupidity nor servility, but a sort of dignified
independence.No pressing to buy, no looking out for gratuities,
only a kindly politeness, which did not fail even when we departed,
taking only a few little ornaments.We should have liked to carry off
a cart-load--especially two enormous vases and a chimney-piece--but
travellers have limits to luggage, and purse as well.we left it with regret, but we were in the hands
of the ever-watchful Charles, anxious that we should see as much as
possible."The driving-road goes far inland, but there's a splendid cliff-walk
from Poltesco to Cadgwith direct.The young ladies might do it with a
guide--here he is, a man I know, quite reliable.They'll walk it easily
in half an hour.But you, ma'am, I think you'd better come with me."So I put my "chickens" in safe charge, meekly
re-entered the carriage, and drove, humbly and alone, across a flat
dull country, diversified here and there by a few cottages, politely
called a village--the two villages of Ruan Minor and Ruan Major.I
afterwards found that they were not without antiquarian interest, that
I might have gone to examine a curious old church, well, and oratory,
supposed to have been inhabited by St.But we had left the
guide-book at home, with the so longed-for bathing gowns, and Charles
was not of archaeological mind, so I heard nothing and investigated
nothing.Except, indeed, numerous huge hand-bills, posted on barn doors and
gates, informing the inhabitants that an Exhibition of Fine Arts,
admittance one shilling, was on view close by.Charles was most anxious
I should stop and visit it, saying it was "very fine."But as within
the last twelvemonth I had seen the Royal Academy, Grosvenor Gallery,
and most of the galleries and museums in Italy, the Fine Art Exhibition
of Ruan Minor was not overwhelmingly attractive.However, not to wound
the good Cornishman, who was evidently proud of it, I explained that,
on the whole, I preferred nature to art.And how grand nature was in this fishing-village of Cadgwith, to which
after a long round, we came at last![Illustration: CADGWITH COVE.]Nestled snugly in a bend of the coast which shelters it from north
and east, leaving it open to southern sunshine, while another curve
of land protects it from the dense fogs which are so common at the
Lizard, Cadgwith is, summer and winter, one of the pleasantest nooks
imaginable.The climate, Charles told me, is so mild, that invalids
often settle down in the one inn--a mere village inn externally, but
very comfortable.And, as I afterwards heard at Lizard Town, the parson
and his wife--"didn't I know them?"and I felt myself rather looked
down upon because I did not know them--are the kindest of people,
who take pleasure in looking after the invalids, rich or poor."Yes,"
Charles considered Cadgwith was a nice place to winter in, "only just a
trifle dull."Probably so, to judge by the interest which, even in this
tourist-season, our carriage excited, as we wound down one side and
up another of the ravine in which the village is built, with a small
fishing-station at the bottom, rather painfully odoriferous.The
fisher-wives came to their doors, the old fisher-men stood, hands in
pockets, the roly-poly healthy fisher-children stopped playing, to
turn round and stare.In these parts everybody stares at everybody,
and generally everybody speaks to everybody--a civil "good-day" at any
rate, sometimes more."This is a heavy pull for you," said a sympathetic old woman, who had
watched me leave the carriage and begin mounting the cliff towards the
Devil's Frying-pan--the principal thing to be seen at Cadgwith.She
followed me, and triumphantly passed me, though she had to carry a bag
of potatoes on her back.I wondered if her feeling was pity or envy
towards another old person who had to carry nothing but her own self.She and I sat down together on the hill-side and had a chat, while I
waited for the two little black dots which I could see moving round the
opposite headland.She gave me all kinds of information, in the simple
way peculiar to country folk, whose innocent horizon comprises the
whole world, which, may be, is less pleasant than the little world of
Cadgwith.The Devil's Frying-pan is a wonderful sight.Imagine a natural
amphitheatre two acres in extent, inclosed by a semi-circular <DW72>
about two hundred feet high, covered with grass and flowers and low
bushes.Outside, the wide, open sea, which pours in to the shingly
beach at the bottom through an arch of serpentine, the colouring of
which, and of the other rocks surrounding it, is most exquisite,
varying from red to green, with sometimes a tint of grey.Were Cadgwith
a little nearer civilisation, what a show-place it would become!The tiny farm-house on the
hill-side near the Frying-pan looked, within and without, much as it
must have looked for the last hundred years; and the ragged, unkempt,
tongue-tied little girl, from whom we succeeded in getting a drink
of milk in a tumbler which she took five minutes to search for, had
certainly never been to a Board School.She investigated the penny
which we deposited as if it were a great natural curiosity rarely
attainable, and she gazed after us as we climbed the stile leading to
the Frying-pan as if wondering what on earth could tempt respectable
people, who had nothing to do, into such a very uncomfortable place.[Illustration: THE DEVIL'S FRYING PAN, NEAR CADGWITH.]Uncomfortable, certainly, as we sat with our feet stuck in the long
grass to prevent slipping down the <DW72>--a misadventure which would
have been, to say the least, awkward.Those boiling waves, roaring each
after each through the arch below; and those jagged rocks, round which
innumerable sea-birds were flying--one could quite imagine that were
any luckless vessel to find itself in or near the Frying-pan, it would
never get out again.To meditative minds there is something very startling in the perpetual
contrast between the summer tourist-life, so cheerful and careless,
and the winter life of the people here, which must be so full of
privations; for one half the year there is nothing to do, no market
for serpentine, and almost no fishing possible: they have to live
throughout the dark days upon the hay made while the sun shines."No, no," said one of the Lizard folk, whom I asked if there was much
drunkenness thereabout, for I had seen absolutely none; "no, us don't
drink; us can't afford it.Winter's a bad time for we--sometimes for
four months a man doesn't earn a halfpenny.He has to save in summer,
or he'd starve the rest of the year."I have seldom seen,
in any part of England or Scotland, such an honest, independent,
respectable race as the working people on this coast, and indeed
throughout Cornwall.We left with regret the pretty village, resolving to come back again
in a day or two; it was barely three miles from the Lizard, though the
difference in climate was said to be so great.And then we drove back
across the bleak down and through the keen "hungry" sea-air, which made
dinner a matter of welcome importance.And without dwelling too much
on the delights of the flesh--very mild delights after all--I will say
that the vegetables grown in the garden, and the grapes in the simple
green-house beside it, were a credit to Cornwall, especially so near
the sea-coast.We had just time to dine, repose a little, and communicate our address
to our affectionate friends at home--so as to link ourselves for a few
brief days with the outside world--when appeared the punctual Charles."Don't be afraid, ladies, he's had a good rest,"--this was the
important animal about whose well-being we were naturally anxious.Charles patted his shoulder, and a little person much given to deep
equine affections tenderly stroked his nose.He seemed sensible of the
attention and of what was expected from him, and started off, as lively
as if he had been idle for a week, across the Lizard Down and Pradenack
Down to Mullion."I hope Mary will be at home," said Charles, turning round as usual to
converse; "she'll be sure to make you comfortable.Of course you've
heard of Mary Mundy?"There was in one of our guide-books a most
glowing description of the Old Inn, and also an extract from a poem,
apostrophising the charms of Mary Mundy.When we said we knew the
enthusiastic Scotch Professor who had written it, we felt that we rose
a step in the estimation of Charles."And Mary will be so pleased to see anybody who knows the
gentleman"--in Cornwall the noted Greek Professor was merely "the
gentleman.""She's got his poem in her visitors' book and his portrait
in her album.When we reached Mullion and drove up to the
door of the Old Inn, there darted out to meet us, not Mary, but an
individual concerning whom Fame has been unjustly silent."It's only Mary's brother," said Charles, with an accent of deep
disappointment.But as the honest man who had apparently gone through life as "Mary's
brother" stood patting our horse and talking to our driver, with both
of whom he seemed on terms of equal intimacy, his welcome to ourselves
was such a mixture of cordiality and despair that we could scarcely
keep from laughing."Mary's gone to Helstone, ladies; her would have been delighted, but
her's gone marketing to Helstone.I hope her'll be back soon, for I
doesn't know what to do without she.The house is full, and there's a
party of eleven come to tea, and actually wanting it sent down to them
at the Cove.And you shall get your tea,
ladies, even if they have to go without."We expressed our gratitude, and left Charles to arrange all for us,
which he did in the most practical way."And you think Mary may be back at six?""Her said her would, and I hope her will," answered the brother
despondently."Her's very seldom out; us can't get on at all without
she."This, and several more long and voluble speeches given in broad
Cornish, with the true Cornish confusion of pronouns, and with an air
of piteous perplexity--nay, abject helplessness, the usual helplessness
of man without woman--proved too much for our risible nerves.We
maintained a decorous gravity till we had driven away, and then fell
into shouts of laughter--the innocent laughter of happy-minded people
over the smallest joke or the mildest species of fun."Never mind, ladies, you'll get your tea all right.If Mary said she'd
be back at six, back she'll be.And you'll find a capital tea waiting
for you; there isn't a more comfortable inn in all Cornwall."Which, we afterwards found, was saying a great deal.Mullion Cove is a good mile from Mullion village, and as we jolted over
the rough road I was remorseful over both carriage and horse."Not at all, ma'am, he's used to it.Often and often he comes here with
pic-nic parties, all the way from Falmouth.I'll put him in at the
farm, and be down with you at the Cove directly.You'll find the rocks
pretty bad walking, but there's a cave which you ought to see.There was no resisting the way the kindly young Cornishman thus
identified himself with our interests, and gave himself all sorts
of extra trouble on our account.And when after a steep and not too
savoury descent--the cove being used as a fish cellar--we found
ourselves on the beach, shut in by those grand rocks of serpentine,
with Mullion Island lying ahead about a quarter of a mile off, we felt
we had not come here for nothing.The great feature of Mullion Cove is its sea-caves, of which there are
two, one on the beach, the other round the point, and only accessible
at low water.Now, we saw the tide was rising fast."They'll have to wade; I told them they would have to wade!"cried an
anxious voice behind me; and "I was ware," as ancient chroniclers say,
of the presence of another "old hen," the same whom we had noticed
conducting her brood of chickens, or ducklings--they seemed more like
the latter now--to bathe on Kennack Sands."Yes, they have been away more than half an hour, all my children
except this one"--a small boy who looked as if he wished he had gone
too."They would go, though I warned them they would have to wade.And
there they are, just going into the cave.One, two, three, four, five,
six," counting the black specks that were seen moving on, or rather in,
the water."Oh dear, they've _all_ gone in![Illustration: MULLION COVE, CORNWALL.]Nevertheless, in the midst of her distress, the benevolent lady stopped
to give me a helping hand into the near cave, a long, dark passage,
with light at either end.My girls had already safely threaded it and
come triumphantly out at the other side.But what with the darkness and
the uncertain footing over what felt like beds of damp seaweed, with
occasional stones, through which one had to grope every inch of one's
way, my heart rather misgave me, until I was cheered by the apparition
of the faithful Charles."Don't go back, ma'am, you'll be so sorry afterwards.I'll strike a
light and help you.Slow and steady, you'll come to no harm.And it's
beautiful when you get out at the other end."The most exquisite little nook; where you could have
imagined a mermaid came daily to comb her hair; one can easily believe
in mermaids or anything else in Cornwall.What a charming dressing-room
she would have, shut in on three sides by those great walls of
serpentine, and in front the glittering sea, rolling in upon a floor of
the loveliest silver sand.But the only mermaid there was an artist's wife, standing beside her
husband's easel, at which he was painting away so earnestly that he
scarcely noticed us.Very picturesque he looked, and she too, in her
rough serge dress, with her pretty bare feet and ankles, the shoes and
stockings lying in a corner as if they had not been worn for hours.they were quite unnecessary on those soft sands,
and their owner stood and talked with me as composedly as if it were
the height of the fashion to go barefoot.And far more than anything
concerning herself, she seemed interested in my evident interest in the
picture, which promised to be a remarkably good one, and which, if I
see it on the R. A. walls next year will furnish my only clue to the
identity of the couple, or theirs to mine.But the tide was fast advancing; they began to take down the easel, and
I remembered that the narrow winding cave was our only way out from
this rock-inclosed fairy paradise to the prosaic beach."Look, they are wading ashore up to the knees!And we shall have to
wade too if we don't make haste back."So cried the perplexed mother of the six too-adventurous ducklings.But mine, more considerate, answered me from the rocks where they were
scrambling, and helped me back through the cave into safe quarters,
where we stood watching the waders with mingled excitement and--envy?I can still recall the delicious sensation of paddling across the
smooth sea-sand, and of walking up the bed of a Highland burn.the change twixt Now and Then," I sat calmly on a stone, dry-shod; as
was best.Still, is it not a benign law of nature, that the things we
are no longer able to do, we almost cease to wish to do?Perhaps even
the last cessation of all things will come naturally at the end, as
naturally as we turn round and go to sleep at night?I am proud to think how high and steep was
the cliff we re-ascended, all three of us, and from which we stood
and looked at sky and sea.Such a sea and such a sky: amber clear, so
that one could trace the whole line of coast--Mount's Bay, with St.Michael's Mount dotted in the midst of it, and even the Land's End,
beyond which the sun, round and red, was just touching the top of the
waves.We should have liked to watch him drop below them--that splendid
sea-sunset of which one never tires, but we had some distance to walk,
and we began to rejoice in the prospect of Mary Mundy's tea."I'll go on ahead and have the carriage ready," said the ever
thoughtful Charles."You can't miss your way, ladies.Just follow the
hedges"--that tempting aerial promenade, to which we were now getting
accustomed, becoming veritable Blondins in petticoats--"then cross the
cornfield; and take to the hedges again.You'll be at the farm-yard
directly."Not quite--for we lingered, tempted by the abundance of corn-flowers,
of which we gathered, not handfuls but armfuls.When we reached
it, what a picture of an English farm-yard it was!With a regular
old-fashioned English milk-maid--such as Izaak Walton would have loved
to describe--sitting amidst her shining pails, her cows standing round
her, meekly waiting their turn.Sleek, calm creatures they were,
Juno-eyed and soft-skinned--of that peculiar shade of grey which I
have seen only in Cornwall.And, being rather a connoisseur in cows,
I have often amused myself to notice how the kine of each country
have their own predominant colour, which seems to harmonise with its
special landscape.The curious yellow tint of Highland cattle, the red,
white, or brown of those of the midland counties, and the delicate
grey of Cornish cows, alike suit the scene around them, and belong to
it as completely as the dainty little Swiss herds do to their Alpine
pastures, or the large, mild, cream- oxen to the Campagna at
Rome.But we had to tear ourselves away from this Arcadia, for in the midst
of the farm-yard appeared the carriage and Charles.So we jolted
back--it seemed as if Cornish carriages and horses could go anywhere
and over everything--to the Old Inn and Mary Mundy.She _had_ come home, and everything was right.As we soon found,
everything and everybody was accustomed to be put to rights by Miss
Mary Mundy.She stood at the door to greet us--a bright, brown-faced little
woman with the reddest of cheeks and the blackest of eyes; I have no
hesitation in painting her portrait here, as she is, so to speak,
public property, known and respected far and wide.[Illustration: A CRABBER'S HOLE, GERRAN'S BAY.]"Delighted to see you, ladies; delighted to see any friends of the
Professor's; and I hope you enjoyed the Cove, and that you're all
hungry, and will find your tea to your liking.It's the best we can do;
we're very homely folk here, but we try to make people comfortable,"
and so on and so on, a regular stream of chatty conversation, given in
the strongest Cornish, with the kindliest of Cornish hearts, as she
ushered us into a neat little parlour at the back of the inn.There lay spread, not one of your dainty afternoon teas, with two or
three wafery slices of bread and butter, but a regular substantial
meal.Cheerful candles--of course in serpentine candlesticks--were
already lit, and showed us the bright teapot full of that welcome drink
to weary travellers, hot, strong and harmless; the gigantic home-baked
loaf, which it seemed sacrilegious to have turned into toast; the rich,
yellow butter--I am sure those lovely cows had something to do with
it, and also with the cream, so thick that the spoon could almost have
stood upright in it.Besides, there was a quantity of that delicious
clotted cream, which here accompanies every meal and of which I had
vainly tried to get the receipt, but was answered with polite scorn,
"Oh, ma'am, it would be of no use to _you_: Cornish cream can only be
made from Cornish cows!"Whether this remarkable fact in natural history be true or not, let me
record the perfection of Mary Mundy's cream, which, together with her
jam and her marmalade, was a refection worthy of the gods.She pressed us again and again to "have some more," and her charge for
our magnificent meal was as small as her gratitude was great for the
slight addition we made to it."No, I'll not say no, ma'am, it'll come in handy; us has got a young
niece to bring up--my brother and me--please'm.Yes, I'm glad you came,
and I hope you'll come again, please'm.And if you see the Professor,
you'll tell him he's not forgotten, please'm."This garniture of "please'm" at the end of every sentence reminded
us of the Venetian "probbedirla," _per ubbedirla_, with which our
gondolier Giovanna used to amuse us, often dragging it in in the oddest
way."Yes, the Signora will get a beautiful day, probbedirla," or "My
wife has just lost her baby, probbedirla."Mary Mundy's "please'm"
often came in with equal incongruity, and her voluble tongue ran on
nineteen to the dozen; but her talk was so shrewd and her looks so
pleasant--once, no doubt, actually pretty, and still comely enough for
a middle-aged woman--that we departed, fully agreeing with her admiring
Professor that

  "The brightest thing on Cornish land
  Is the face of Miss Mary Mundy."Recrossing Pradenack down in the dim light of a newly-risen moon,
everything looked so solitary and ghostly that we started to see moving
from behind a furz-bush, a mysterious figure, which crossed the road
slowly, and stood waiting for us.Was it man or ghost, or--

Only a donkey!It might have been Tregeagle
himself--Tregeagle, the grim mad-demon of Cornish tradition, once a
dishonest steward, who sold his soul to the devil, and is doomed to
keep on emptying Dozmare Pool, near St.Neots (the same mere wherein
Excalibur was thrown), with a limpet-shell; and to spend his nights in
other secluded places balancing interminable accounts, which are always
just sixpence wrong.I fear some of us, weak in arithmetic, had a secret
sympathy for him!But we never met him--nor anything worse than that
spectral donkey, looming large and placid against the level horizon.Soon, "the stars came out by twos and threes,"--promising a fine night
and finer morning, during which, while we were comfortably asleep,
our good horse and man would be driving across this lonely region to
Falmouth, in time to take the good people to church on Sunday morning."And we'll do it, too--don't you be anxious about us, ladies," insisted
Charles."I'll feed him well, and groom him well.I likes to take care
of a good horse, and you'll see, he'll take no harm.I'll be back when
you want me, at the week's end, or perhaps before then, with some party
or other--we're always coming to the Lizard--and I'll just look in and
see how you're getting on, and how you liked Kynance.We thanked our kindly charioteer, bade him and his horse good-bye,
wished him a pleasant journey through the moonlight, which was every
minute growing more beautiful, then went indoors to supper--no!supper
would have been an insult to Mary Mundy's tea--to bed.DAY THE FOURTH


Sunday, September 4th--and we had started on September 1st; was it
possible we had only been travelling four days?We had seen so much, taken in so many
new interests--nay, made several new friends.Already we began to plan
another meeting with John Curgenven, who we found was a relation of
our landlady, or of our bright-faced serving maiden, Esther--I forget
which.But everybody seemed connected with everybody at the Lizard,
and everybody took a friendly interest in everybody.The arrival of
new lodgers in the "genteel" parlour which we had not appreciated
was important information, and we were glad to hear that Charles had
started about four in the morning quite cheery.And what a morning it was!--a typical Sabbath, a day of rest, a day
to rejoice in.Strolling round the garden at eight o'clock, while the
dew still lay thick on the grass, and glittered like diamonds on the
autumnal spider-webs, even the flowers seemed to know it was Sunday,
the mignonette bed to smell sweeter, the marigolds--yes!aesthetic
fashion is right in its love for marigolds--burnt in a perfect blaze
of golden colour and aromatic scent.The air was so mild that we could
imagine summer was still with us: and the great wide circle of sea
gleamed in the sunshine as if there never had been, never could be,
such a thing as cloud or storm.Having ascertained that there was no service nearer than Grade, some
miles off, until the afternoon, we "went to church" on the cliffs, in
Pistol Meadow, beside the green mounds where the two hundred drowned
sailors sleep in peace.[Illustration: STEAM SEINE BOATS GOING OUT.]Absolutely solitary: not a living creature,
not even a sheep came near me the whole morning:--and in the silence
I could hear almost every word said by my young folks, searching for
sea-treasures among the rocks and little pools far below.Westwards
towards Kynance, and eastwards towards Landewednack--the church we were
to go to in the afternoon--the cliff path was smooth and green, the
short grass full of those curious dainty flowers, some of which were
new to our eager eyes.At other times the road was so precipitous that
we did not wonder at those carefully white-washed stones every few
yards, which are the sole guide to the coastguard men of dark nights.Even in daylight, if the wind were high, or the footing slippery with
rain, the cliff-walk from the Lizard to Kynance would be no joke to
uninitiated feet.Now, all was so still that the wind never once fluttered the letter I
was writing, and so warm that we were glad to escape the white glare of
the wall of the Lizard Lights and sit in a cool hollow, watching sky
and ocean, with now and then a sea-bird floating lazily between, a dark
speck on the perpetual blue."If it will only keep like this all week!"And, as we sat, we planned
out each day, so as to miss nothing, and lose nothing--either of time
or strength: doing enough, but never too much--as is often the fatal
mistake of tourists.And then, following the grand law of travelling,
to have one's "meals reg'lar"--we went indoors and dined.Afterwards in
honour of the day

        "that comes between
  The Saturday and Monday,"

we dressed ourselves in all our best--very humble best it was!--to join
the good people going to church at Landewednack.This, which in ancient Cornish means "the white-roofed church of St.Wednack"--hagiologists must decide who that individual was!--is the
name of the parish to which the comparatively modern Lizard Town
belongs.The church is in a very picturesque corner, close to the sea,
though both it and the rectory are protected by a sudden dip in the
ground, so that you see neither till you are close upon them.A fine
Norman doorway, a curious hagioscope, and other points, interesting to
archaeologists--also the neatest and prettiest of churchyards--make
note-worthy this, the most southerly church in England.A fine old
building, not spoiled though "restored."The modern open pews, and a
modern memorial pulpit of serpentine, jarred less than might have been
expected with the carefully-preserved remains of the past.In Landewednack church is said to have been preached the last sermon in
Cornish.Since, the ancient tongue has completely
died out, and the people of King Arthur's country have become wholly
English.Still, they are not the English of the midland and northern districts,
but of a very different type and race.I have heard it said that a
seaboard population, accustomed to wrestle with the dangers of the
coast, to move about from place to place, see foreign countries, and
carry on its business in the deep waters, is always more capable, more
intelligent, as a whole, than an inland people, whether agricultural
or manufacturing.It may be so: but certainly the aborigines of
Lizard Town, who could easily be distinguished from the visitors--of
whom there was yet a tolerable sprinkling--made a very interesting
congregation; orderly, respectable, reverent; simple in dress and
manner, yet many of them, both the men and women, exceedingly
picturesque.That is, the old men and the old women: the younger ones
aped modern fashion even here, in this out-of-the-way corner, and
consequently did not look half so well as their seniors.I must name one more member of the congregation--a large black dog,
who walked in and settled himself in the pew behind, where he behaved
during half the service in an exemplary manner, worthy of the Highland
shepherds' dogs, who always come to church with their masters, and
conduct themselves with equal decorum.There is always a certain pathos in going in to worship in a strange
church, with a strange congregation, of whom you are as ignorant as
they of you.In the intervals of kneeling with them as "miserable
sinners," one finds oneself speculating upon them, their possible
faults and virtues, joys and sorrows, hopes and fears, watching the
unknown faces, and trying to read thereon the records of a common
humanity.A silent homily, better perhaps than most sermons.Not that there was aught to complain of in the sermon, and the singing
was especially good.Many a London choir might have taken a lesson from
this village church at the far end of Cornwall.When service was over,
we lingered in the pretty and carefully tended churchyard, where the
evening light fell softly upon many curious gravestones, of seafaring
men, and a few of wrecked sailors--only a few, since it is but within
a generation that bodies washed ashore from the deep were allowed to
be buried in consecrated ground; most of them, like the two hundred in
Pistol Meadow, being interred as near as convenient to where they were
found, without any burial rites.Still, in all the churchyards along
this coast are graves with a story.A little corner railed off has an
old and sad one.There lie buried the victims of the plague, which in
1645 devastated the village.No one since has ever ventured to disturb
their resting-place.Very green and peaceful the churchyard looked: the beautiful day was
dying, beautiful to the last.We stood and watched the congregation
melt slowly away, disappearing down the lane, and then, attracted by
the sound of music, we re-entered the church.There we sat and listened
for another half-hour to the practising of an anthem ready for the
harvest festival, which had been announced for the following Tuesday;
exceedingly well done too, the rector's voice leading it all, with an
energy and enthusiasm that at once accounted for the capital condition
of the choir.was our earnest sigh as we walked
home; and anxious not to lose a minute of it, we gave ourselves the
briefest rest, and turned out again, I to watch the sunset from the
cliffs, while the others descended once more to their beloved sea-pools."Such anemones, such sea-weed!Besides,
sunsets are all alike," added the youthful, practical, and slightly
unpoetical mind.Every one has a mysterious charm of its
own--just like that in every new human face.I have seen hundreds of
sunsets in my time, and those I shall see are narrowing down now, but
I think to the end of my life I shall always feel a day incomplete of
which I did not see the sunset.The usual place where the sun dropped into the
sea, just beyond the point of the Land's End, was all a golden mist.I hastened west, climbing one intervening cliff after the other,
anxious not to miss the clear sight of him as he set his glowing
feet, or rather his great round disc, on the sea.At last I found a
"comfortable" stone, sheltered from the wind, which blew tolerably
fresh, and utterly solitary (as I thought), the intense silence
being such that one could almost hear the cropping of three placid
sheep--evidently well accustomed to sunsets, and thinking them of
little consequence.There I sat until the last red spark had gone out, quenched in the
Atlantic waters, and from behind the vanished sun sprung a gleam of
absolutely green light, "like a firework out of a rocket," the young
people said; such as I had never seen before, though we saw it once
afterwards.Nature's fireworks they were; and I could see even the two
little black figures moving along the rocks below stand still to watch
them.I watched too, with that sort of lonely delight--the one shadow
upon it being that it is so lonely--with which all one's life one is
accustomed to watch beautiful and vanishing things.Then seeing how
fast the colours were fading and the sky darkening, I rose; but just
took a step or two farther to look over the edge of my stone into the
next dip of the cliff, and there I saw--

[Illustration: HAULING IN THE BOATS--EVENING.]Nothing else would have
sat so long and so silently, for I had been within three yards of them
all the time, and had never discovered them, nor they me.They sat, quite absorbed in
one another, hand in hand, looking quietly seaward, their faces bathed
in the rosy sunset--which to them was a sunrise, the sort of sun which
never rises twice in a life-time.Evidently they did not see me, in fact I just
peered over the rock's edge and drew back again; any slight sound they
probably attributed to the harmless sheep.Well, it was but an equally
harmless old woman, who did not laugh at them, as some might have done,
but smiled and wished them well, as she left them to their sunset, and
turned to face the darkening east, where the sun would rise to-morrow.The moon was rising there now, and it was a picture to behold.Indeed,
all these Cornish days seemed so full of moonrises and sunsets--and
sunrises too--that it was really inconvenient.Going to bed seemed
almost a sin--as on this night, when, opening our parlour door, which
looked right on to the garden, we saw the whole world lying in a flood
of moonlight peace, the marigolds and carnations leaning cheek to
cheek, as motionless as the two young lovers on the cliff.must long ago have had their dream broken, for five minutes afterwards
I had met a most respectable fat couple from Lizard Town taking their
Sunday evening stroll, in all their Sunday best, along those very
cliffs.But perhaps, the good folks had once
been lovers too.How the stars
shone, without a mist or a cloud; how the Lizard Lights gleamed, even
in spite of the moonlight, and how clear showed the black outline of
Kynance Cove, from which came through the silence a dull murmur of
waves!It was, as we declared, a sin and a shame to go to bed at all
though we had been out the whole day, and hoped to be out the whole of
to-morrow.Still, human nature could not keep awake for ever.We passed
from the poetical to the practical, and decided to lay us down and
sleep.But, in the middle of the night I woke, rose, and looked out of the
window.Sea and sky were one blackness, literally as "black as
ink," and melting into one another so that both were undistinguishable.As for the moon and stars--heaven knows where they had gone to, for
they seemed utterly blotted out.The only light visible was the ghostly
gleam of those two great eyes, the Lizard Lights, stretching far out
into the intense darkness.I never saw such darkness--unbroken even by
the white crest of a wave.And the stillness was like the stillness of
death, with a heavy weight in the air which made me involuntarily go
to sleep again, though with an awed impression of "something going to
happen."And sure enough in another hour something did happen.I started awake,
feeling as if a volley of artillery had been poured in at my window.It was the wildest deluge of rain, beating against the panes, and with
it came a wind that howled and shrieked round the house as if all the
demons in Cornwall, Tregeagle himself included, were let loose at once.Now we understood what a Lizard storm could be.I have seen
Mediterranean storms, sweeping across the Campagna like armed
battalions of avenging angels, pouring out their vials of wrath--rain,
hail, thunder, and lightning--unceasingly for two whole days.I have
been in Highland storms, so furious that one had to sit down in the
middle of the road with one's plaid over one's head, till the worst of
their rage was spent.But I never saw or heard anything more awful than
this Lizard storm, to which I lay and listened till the day began to
dawn.Then the wind lulled a little, but the rain still fell in torrents,
and the sky and sea were as black as ever.The weather had evidently
broken for good--that is, for evil.the harvest, and the harvest
festival!And alas--of minor importance, but still some, to us at
least--alas for our holiday in Cornwall!It was with a heavy heart that, feeling there was not the slightest use
in getting up, I turned round and took another sleep.DAY THE FIFTH


"Hope for the best, and be prepared for the worst," had been the motto
of our journey.So when we rose to one of the wettest mornings that
ever came out of the sky, there was a certain satisfaction in being
prepared for it."We must have a fire, that is certain," was our first decision.This
entailed the abolition of our beautiful decorations--our sea-holly
and ferns; also some anxious looks from our handmaiden.Apparently no
fire, had been lit in this rather despised room for many months--years
perhaps--and the chimney rather resented being used.A few agonised
down-puffs greatly interfered with the comfort of the breakfast table,
and an insane attempt to open the windows made matters worse.Which was most preferable--to be stifled or deluged?We were just
considering the question, when the chimney took a new and kinder
thought, or the wind took a turn--it seemed to blow alternately from
every quarter, and then from all quarters at once--the smoke went up
straight, the room grew warm and bright, with the cosy peace of the
first fire of the season.Existence became once more endurable, nay,
pleasant."We shall survive, spite of the rain!"And we began to laugh over our
lost day which we had meant to begin by bathing in Housel Cove; truly,
just to stand outside the door would give an admirable douche bath in
three minutes."But how nice it is to be inside, with a roof over our
heads, and no necessity for travelling.Fancy the unfortunate tourists
who have fixed on to-day for visiting the Lizard!"(Charles had told us
that Monday was a favourite day for excursions.)"Fancy anybody being
obliged to go out such weather as this!"And in our deep pity for our fellow-creatures we forgot to pity
ourselves.Nor was there much pity needed; we had provided against emergencies,
with a good store of needlework and knitting, anything that would
pack in small compass, also a stock of unquestionably "light"
literature--paper-covered, double-columned, sixpenny volumes, inclosing
an amount of enjoyment which those only can understand who are true
lovers of Walter Scott.We had enough of him to last for a week of wet
days.And we had a one-volume Tennyson, all complete, and a "Morte
d'Arthur"--Sir Thomas Malory's.On this literary provender we felt that
as yet we should not starve.Also, some little fingers having a trifling turn for art, brought out
triumphantly a colour-box, pencils, and pictures.And the wall-paper
being one of the very ugliest that ever eye beheld, we sought and
obtained permission to adorn it with these, our _chefs-d'[oe]uvre_,
pasted at regular intervals.Where we hope they still remain, for the
edification of succeeding lodgers.We read the "Idylls of the King" all through, finishing with "The
Passing of Arthur," where the "bold Sir Bedivere" threw Excalibur into
the mere--which is supposed to be Dozmare Pool.Here King Arthur's
faithful lover was so melted--for the hundredth time--by the pathos
of the story, and by many old associations, that the younger and
more practical minds grew scornful, and declared that probably King
Arthur had never existed at all--or if he had, was nothing but a rough
barbarian, unlike even the hero of Sir Thomas Malory, and far more
unlike the noble modern gentleman of Tennyson's verse.Maybe: and yet,
seeing that

  "'Tis better to have loved and lost
  Than never to have loved at all,"

may it not be better to have believed in an impossible ideal man, than
to accept contentedly a low ideal, and worship blindly the worldly, the
mean, or the base?This topic furnished matter for so much hot argument, that, besides
doing a quantity of needlework, we succeeded in making our one wet day
by no means the least amusing of our seventeen days in Cornwall.[Illustration: HAULING IN THE LINES.]Hour after hour we watched the rain--an even down-pour.In the midst
of it we heard a rumour that Charles had been seen about the town, and
soon after he appeared at the door, hat in hand, soaked but smiling,
to inquire for and sympathise with his ladies.Yes, he _had_ brought a
party to the Lizard that day!--unfortunate souls (or bodies), for there
could not have been a dry thread left on them!We gathered closer round
our cosy fire; ate our simple dinner with keen enjoyment, and agreed
that after all we had much to be thankful for.In the afternoon the storm abated a little, and we thought we would
seize the chance of doing some shopping, if there was a shop in Lizard
Town.So we walked--I ought rather to say waded, for the road was
literally swimming--meeting not one living creature, except a family of
young ducks, who, I need scarcely say, were enjoying supreme felicity."Yes, ladies, this is the sort of weather we have pretty well all
winter.Very little frost or snow, but rain and storm, and plenty of
it.Also fogs; I've heard there's nothing anywhere like the fogs at the
Lizard."So said the woman at the post-office, which, except the serpentine
shops, seemed to be the one emporium of commerce in the place.There we
could get all we wanted, and a good deal that we were very thankful we
did not want, of eatables, drinkables, and wearables.Also ornaments,
china vases, &c., of a kind that would have driven frantic any person
of aesthetic tastes.Among them an active young Cornishman of about a
year old was meandering aimlessly, or with aims equally destructive
to himself and the community.He all but succeeded in bringing down a
row of plates upon his devoted head, and then tied himself up, one fat
finger after another, in a ball of twine, upon which he began to howl
violently."He's a regular little trial," said the young mother proudly."He's
only sixteen months old, and yet he's up to all sorts of mischief.I
don't know what in the world I shall do with he, presently."Not naughty, only active," suggested another maternal spirit, and
pleaded that the young jackanapes should be found something to do that
was not mischief, but yet would occupy his energies, and fill his mind.At which, the bright bold face looked up as if he had understood it
all--an absolutely fearless face, brimming with fun, and shrewdness
too.The "regular little trial" may grow into a valuable
member of society--fisherman, sailor, coastguardman--daring and doing
heroic deeds; perhaps saving many a life on nights such as last night,
which had taught us what Cornish coast-life was all winter through.The storm was now gradually abating; the wind had lulled entirely, the
rain had ceased, and by sunset a broad yellow streak all along the west
implied that it might possibly be a fine day to-morrow.But the lane was almost a river still, and the slippery altitudes of
the "hedges" were anything but desirable.As the only possible place
for a walk I ventured into a field where two or three cows cropped
their supper of damp grass round one of those green hillocks seen in
every Cornish pasture field--a manure heap planted with cabbages, which
grow there with a luxuriance that turns ugliness into positive beauty.Very dreary everything was--the soaking grass, the leaden sky, the
angry-looking sea, over which a rainy moon was just beginning to throw
a faint glimmer; while shorewards one could just trace the outline of
Lizard Point and the wheat-field behind it.Yesterday those fields had
looked so sunshiny and fair, but to-night they were all dull and grey,
with rows of black dots indicating the soppy, sodden harvest sheaves.Which reminded me that to-morrow was the harvest festival at
Landewednack, when all the world and his wife was invited by shilling
tickets to have tea in the rectory garden, and afterwards to assist at
the evening thanksgiving service in the church.some poor farmer might well exclaim,
especially on such a day as this.Some harvest festivals must
occasionally seem a bitter mockery.Indeed, I doubt if the next
generation will not be wise in taking our "Prayers for Rain,"
"Prayers for Fair Weather," clean out of the liturgy.Such conceited
intermeddling with the government of the world sounds to some
ridiculous, to others actually profane."Snow and hail, mists and
vapours, wind and storm, fulfilling His Word."And it must be
fulfilled, no matter at what cost to individuals or to nations.The
laws of the universe must be carried out, even though the mystery
of sorrow, like the still greater mystery of evil, remains for ever
unexplained."Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"How marvellously beautiful He can make this
world!until we can hardly imagine anything more beautiful in the world
everlasting.Ay, even after such a day as to-day, when the world seems
hardly worth living in, yet we live on, live to wake up unto such a
to-morrow--

But I must wait to speak of it in another page.DAY THE SIXTH


And a day absolutely divine!Not a cloud upon the sky, not a ripple
upon the water, or it appeared so in the distance.Nearer, no doubt,
there would have been that heavy ground-swell which is so long in
subsiding, in fact is scarcely ever absent on this coast.The land,
like the sea, was all one smile; the pasture fields shone in brilliant
green, the cornfields gleaming yellow--at once a beauty and a
thanksgiving.It was the very perfection of an autumn morning.We would not lose
an hour of it, but directly after breakfast started leisurely to
find Housel Cove and try our first experiment of bathing in the wide
Atlantic.Not a rood of land lay between us and
America.Yet the illimitable ocean "where the great ships go down,"
rolled in to our feet in baby ripples, disporting itself harmlessly,
and tempting my two little mermaids to swim out to the utmost limit
that prudence allowed.And how delightful it was to run back barefoot
across the soft sand to the beautiful dressing-room of serpentine
rock, where one could sit and watch the glittering sea, untroubled by
any company save the gulls and cormorants.What a contrast to other
bathing places--genteel Eastbourne and Brighton, or vulgar Margate and
Ramsgate, where, nevertheless, the good folks look equally happy.Shall we stamp ourselves
as persons of little mind, easily satisfied, if I confess that we
spent the whole morning in Housel Cove without band or promenade,
without even a Christy Minstrel or a Punch and Judy, our sole amusement
being the vain attempt to catch a tiny fish, the Robinson Crusoe of
a small pool in the rock above high-water mark, where by some ill
chance he found himself.But he looked extremely contented with his
sea hermitage, and evaded so cleverly all our efforts to get hold of
him, that after a while we left him to his solitude--where possibly he
resides still.[Illustration: THE LIZARD LIGHTS BY DAY.]How delicious it is for hard-worked people to do nothing, absolutely
nothing!Of course only for a little while--a few days, a few hours.The love of work and the necessity for it soon revive.But just for
those few harmless hours to let the world and its duties and cares
alike slip by, to be absolutely idle, to fold one's hands and look
at the sea and the sky, thinking of nothing at all, except perhaps
to count and watch for every ninth wave--said to be the biggest
always--and wonder how big it will be, and whether it will reach that
stone with the little colony of limpets and two red anemones beside
them, or stop short at the rock where we sit placidly dangling our
feet, waiting, Canute-like, for the supreme moment when the will of
humanity sinks conquered by the immutable powers of nature.Then,
greatest crisis of all, the sea will attack that magnificent castle and
moat, which we grown-up babies have constructed with such pride.Well,
have we not all built our sand-castles and seen them swept away?happy
if by no unkinder force than the remorseless wave of Time, which will
soon flow over us all.But how foolish is moralising--making my narrative halt like that horse
whom we amused ourselves with half the afternoon.He was tied by the
leg, poor beast, the fore leg fastened to the hind one, as seemed to be
the ordinary Cornish fashion with all animals--horses, cows, and sheep.It certainly saves a deal of trouble, preventing them from climbing the
"hedges" which form the sole boundary of property, but it makes the
creatures go limping about in rather a melancholy fashion.However,
as it is their normal condition, probably they communicate it to one
another, and each generation accepts its lot.He was a handsome animal, who came and peered at
the sketch which one of us was doing, after the solemn fashion of
quadrupedal connoisseurship, and kept us company all the afternoon.We
sat in a row on the top of the "hedge," enjoying the golden afternoon,
and scarcely believing it possible that yesterday had been yesterday.Of the wild storm and deluge of rain there was not a single trace;
everything looked as lovely as if it had been, and was going to be,
summer all the year.We were so contented, and were making such progress in our sketch and
distant view of Kynance over the now dry and smiling cornfield, that we
had nigh forgotten the duties of civilisation, until some one brought
the news that all the household was apparently dressing itself in its
very best, to attend the rectory tea.We determined to do the same,
though small were our possibilities of toilette."Nobody knows us, and we know
nobody."A position rather rare to those who "dwell among their own people,"
who take a kindly interest in everybody, and believe with a pardonable
credulity that everybody takes a kindly interest in them.But human nature is the same all the world over.And here we saw it in
its pleasantest phase; rich and poor meeting together, not for charity,
but courtesy--a courtesy that was given with a kindliness and accepted
with a quiet independence which seemed characteristic of these Cornish
folk.Among the little crowd, gentle and simple, we, of course, did not know
a single soul.Nevertheless, delivering up our tickets to the gardener
at the gate, we entered, and wandered at ease through the pretty
garden, gorgeous with asters, marigolds, carnations, and all sorts of
rich- and rich-scented autumn flowers; where the hydrangeas
grew in enormous bushes, and the fuchsias had stems as thick and solid
as trees.In front of the open hall door was a gravel sweep where were ranged
two long tea-tables filled with the humbler but respectable class of
parishioners, chiefly elderly people, and some very old.The Lizard is
a place noted for longevity, as is proved by the register books, where
several deaths at over a hundred may be found recorded, and one--he was
the rector of Landewednack in 1683--is said to have died at the age of
120 years.The present rector is no such Methuselah.He moved actively to and fro
among his people, and so did his wife, whom we should have recognised
by her omnipresent kindliness, even if she had not come and welcomed
us strangers--easily singled out as strangers, where all the rest were
friends.Besides the poor and the aged, there was a goodly number of guests
who were neither the one nor the other, playing energetically at
lawn-tennis behind the house, on a "lawn" composed of sea-sand.All
seemed determined to amuse themselves and everybody else, and all did
their very best--including the band.I would fain pass it over in silence (would it
had returned the compliment!); but truth is truth, and may benefit
rather than harm.The calm composure with which those half-dozen
wind-instruments sat in a row, playing determinedly flat, bass coming
in with a tremendous boom here and there, entirely at his own volition,
without regard to time or tune, was the most awful thing I ever heard
in music!Agony, pure and simple, was the only sensation it produced.When they struck up, we just ran away till the tune was ended--what
tune, familiar or unfamiliar, it was impossible to say.Between us
three, all blessed, or cursed, with musical ears, there existed such
difference of opinion on this head, that decision became vain.And
when at last, as the hour of service approached, little groups began
strolling towards the church, the musicians began a final "God save the
Queen," barely recognisable, a feeling of thankfulness was the only
sensation left.[Illustration: THE FISHERMAN'S DAUGHTER--A CORNISH STUDY.]Now, let me not be hard upon these village Orpheuses.They did their
best, and for a working man to study music in any form is a good and
desirable thing.But whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing
well.The great bane of provincial life is that people have so few
opportunities of finding out when they do _not_ do things well, and so
little ambition to learn to do them better.If these few severe remarks
should spur on that anonymous band to try and emulate the Philharmonic
or the Crystal Palace orchestra, it will be all the better for the
little community at the Lizard.A crowded congregation--not a
seat vacant--listened to the excellent chanting, hymns, and a harvest
anthem, most accurately and correctly sung.The organist too--it was
a pleasure to watch that young man's face and see with what interest
and enthusiasm he entered into it all.Besides the rector, there were
several other clergymen, one of whom, an old man, read the prayers
with an intonation and expression which I have rarely heard equalled,
and another preached what would have been called anywhere a thoroughly
good sermon.All the statelier guests at the Rectory tea--probably
county families (one stout lady had the dignity of a duchess at
least)--"assisted" at this evening service, and behind them was a
throng of humbler folk, among whom we recognised our sole friend here,
John Curgenven.We had passed him at the church door, and he had lifted
his hat with the air of a _preux chevalier_ of the olden time; "more
like King Arthur than ever"--we observed to one another.He, and we, and the aristocratic groups, with a few more of the
congregation, lingered for several minutes after service was over,
admiring the beautiful flowers and fruit.I think I never saw any
decorations so rich or so tasteful.And then, as the organ played us
out with an exceedingly brilliant voluntary, the vision of light and
colour melted away, and we came out upon the quiet churchyard, lying in
the cold, still moonlight.Clear as day, the round silver orb sailing
through a cloudless sky of that deep dark which we know is blue, only
moonlight shows no colours.Oh, Lady Moon, Lady Moon, what a dangerous
night for some of those groups to go walking home in!We saw them in
twos and threes, various young people whom we had got to know by sight,
and criticise, and take an interest in, wandering slowly on through
Lizard Town, and then diverging into quieter paths.For there, in an open space near the two hotels
which co-exist close together--I hope amicably, and divide the tourist
custom of the place--in front of a row of open windows which showed the
remains of a _table d'hote_, and playing lively tunes to a group of
delighted listeners, including some children, who had struck up a merry
dance--stood that terrible wind band!All our sympathy with our fellow-creatures, our
pleasure in watching them enjoy themselves, our interest in studying
human nature in the abstract, nay, even the picturesqueness of the
charming moonlight scene, could not tempt us to stay.We paused a
minute, then put our fingers in our ears and fled.Gradually those
fearful sounds melted away into distance, and left us to the silence of
moonshine, and the sight, now grown familiar, but never less beautiful,
of the far-gleaming Lizard Lights.DAY THE SEVENTH


John Curgenven had said last night, with his air of tender patronising,
half regal, half paternal, which we declared always reminded us of King
Arthur--"Ladies, whenever you settle to go to Kynance, I'll take you."And sure enough there he stood, at eight in the morning, quite a
picture, his cap in one hand, a couple of fishes dangling from the
other--he had brought them as a present, and absolutely refused to be
paid--smiling upon us at our breakfast, as benignly as did the sun.He
came to say that he was at our service till 10 A.M.We did not like venturing in strange and
dangerous ground, or rather sea, without our protector.But this was
our last chance, and such a lovely day."You won't come to any harm, ladies," said the consoling John."I'll
take you by a short cut across the down, much better than the cliff.You can't possibly miss your way: it'll lead you straight to Kynance,
and then you go down a steep path to the Cove.You'll have plenty of
time before the tide comes in to see everything.""Oh yes, miss, there's the Drawing-room, the Dining-room, and the
Kitchen--all capital caves close together; I wouldn't advise you to
swim out far, though.And keep a sharp look out for the tide--it runs
in pretty fast.""Oh, you can easy get on Asparagus Island, miss; it's quite safe.Only
don't try the Devil's Throat--or Hell's Mouth, as some folk call it."Neither name was inviting; but studying our guide-books, we thought we
could manage even without our friend.So, long ere the dew was dried on
the sunshiny down, we all started off together, Curgenven slackening
his quick active steps--very light and most enviably active for a man
of his years--to accommodate us, and conversing courteously with us all
the way.[Illustration: KYNANCE COVE, CORNWALL.]"Ower the muir amang the heather" have I tramped many a mile in
bonnie Scotland, but this Cornish moor and Cornish heather were quite
different.As different as the Cornishman with his bright, frank face,
and his mixture of British honesty and Gallic courtesy, from the Scotch
peasant--equally worthy, but sometimes just a trifle "dour."John had plenty to say for himself, and said it well, with a quiet
independence that there was no mistaking; never forgetting meanwhile to
stop and offer a helping hand over every bit of rough road, puddle, or
bog.He gave us a vivid picture of winter life at the Lizard: when the
little community has to hybernate, like the squirrels and field-mice,
upon its summer savings."Sometimes we don't earn a halfpenny for weeks and months, and then if
we've got nothing to fall back upon it's a bad job, you see, ma'am."I asked him if much money went for drink; they seemed to me a
remarkably sober set at the Lizard."Yes, I think we are; we're obliged to be; we can't spend money at the
public-house, for we've got none to spend.I'm no teetotaller myself,"
added John boldly."I don't dislike a glass of beer now and then, if I
can afford it, and when I can't afford it I can do without it, and if I
do take it I always know when to stop."Ay, that is the crucial test--the knowing when to stop.It is this
which makes all the difference between a good man and a villain, a wise
man and a fool.Self-control--a quality which, guided by conscience and
common sense, is the best possession of any human being.And looking at
the honest fisherman, one felt pretty sure he had his share of it."Now I must leave you, ladies," said he, a great deal sooner than we
wished, for we much liked talking to him."My time's nearly up, and I
mustn't keep my gentleman waiting; he goes out in my boat every day,
and has been a good friend to me.The road's straight before you,
ladies; and there's another party just ahead of you.Follow the track,
and you'll soon be at Kynance.It's a lovely day for the Cove, and I
hope you'll enjoy yourselves."John bared his grey head, with a salutation worthy of some old knight
of the Round Table, and then strode back, in double-quick time, as
active and upright as any young fellow of twenty-five, across the level
down.When, afterwards, I stood one dull winter day
in a London Art Gallery, opposite the _Cornish Lions_, how well I
recalled this day!How truly Brett's picture gives the long roll of
the wave upon the silver sands, the richly-tinted rocks and caves, the
brightness and freshness of everything.And those merry girls beside
me, who had the faculty of enjoying all they had, and all they did,
without regretting what they had not or what they might not do--with
heroic resignation they promised not to attempt to swim in the tempting
smooth water beyond the long rollers.Though knocked down again and
again, they always emerged from the waves with shouts of laughter.Mere
dots they looked to my anxious eyes--a couple of corks tossed hither
and thither on the foaming billows--and very thankful I was to get them
safe back into the "drawing-room," the loveliest of lovely caves.There was no time to lose; by noon our parlour floor--what a fairy
floor it was!of the softest, most delicious sand--would be all covered
with waves.And before then there was a deal to be seen and done, the
Bellows, the Gull Rock, Asparagus Island--even if we left out the
dangerous points with the ugly names that Curgenven had warned us
against.What is there in humanity, certainly in youthful humanity, that if
it can attain its end in two ways, one quiet and decorous, the other
difficult and dangerous, is certain to choose the latter?"We must manage to get you to the Bellows, it is such a curious sight,"
said my girls as they returned from it."Don't be frightened--come
along!"By dint of pulling, pushing, and the help of stick and arm, I came:
stood watching the spout of water which, in certain conditions of the
tide, forces itself through a tiny fissure in the rock with a great
roar, and joined in the childish delight of waiting, minute by minute,
for the biggest spout, the loudest roar.But Asparagus Island (where was no asparagus at all) I totally
declined.Not being a goat or a chamois, I contented myself with
sitting where I could gain the best view of the almost invisible
path by which my adventurous young "kids" disappeared.Happily they
had both steady heads and cool nerves; they were neither rash nor
unconscientious.I knew they would come back as soon as they could.So
I waited patiently, contemplating a fellow-victim who seemed worse off
than myself; a benign-looking clergyman, who kept walking up and down
the soppy sands, and shouting at intervals to two young people, a man
and a woman, who appeared to be crawling like flies along the face of
the rock towards another rock, with a yawning cave and a wide fissure
between.the clergyman cried at the top of his voice."Your young people seem rather venturesome," said I sympathetically.[Illustration: THE STEEPLE ROCK, KYNANCE COVE.]"Not _my_ young people," was the dignified answer."My girls are up
there, on Asparagus Rock, which is easy enough climbing.They promised
not to go farther, and they never disobey their mother and me.I declare he is taking her to the most dangerous part, that
rock where you have to jump--a good jump it is, and if you miss your
footing you are done for, you go right into the boiling waves below.Well, it's no business of mine; she is his own property; he is engaged
to her, but"--

I fear I made some very severe remarks on the folly of a young man who
could thus risk life and limbs--not only his own, but those of his wife
to be; and on the weakness of a girl who could allow herself to be
tempted, even by a lover, into such selfish foolhardiness."They must manage their own affairs," said the old gentleman
sententiously, perhaps not being so much given to preaching (out of the
pulpit) as I was.And very sensible girls they looked, clad in a practical, convenient
fashion, just fitted for scrambling.By them I sent a message to my own
girls, explaining the best descent from Asparagus Island, and repeating
the warning against attempting Hell's Mouth."Yes, you are quite right," said my elderly friend, as we sat down
together on the least uncomfortable stone we could find, and watched
the juniors disappear over the rocks."I like to see girls active and
brave; I never hinder them in any reasonable enjoyment, even though
there may be risk in it--one must run some risk--and a woman may
have to save life as well as a man.But foolhardy bravado I not only
dislike--I _despise_ it."In which sentiments I so entirely agreed that we fraternised there
and then; began talking on all sorts of subjects--some of them the
very serious and earnest subjects that one occasionally drops into by
mere chance, with mere strangers.I recall that half hour on Kynance
Sands as one of the pleasant memories of our tour, though to this day
I have not the remotest idea who my companion was.Except that as soon
as he spoke I recognised the reader whose voice had so struck me in
last night's thanksgiving service; reminding me of Frederick Denison
Maurice, whom this generation is almost beginning to forget, but whom
we elders never can forget.The tide was creeping on now--nay, striding, wave after wave, through
"parlour" and "drawing-room," making ingress and egress alike
impossible.In fact, a newly arrived party of tourists, who had stood
unwisely long contemplating the Bellows, were seen to gaze in despair
from their rock which had suddenly become an island.No chance for them
except to wade--and in a few minutes more they would probably have
to swim ashore.What became of them we did not stay to see, for an
anxious, prudent little voice, always thoughtful for "mother," insisted
on our precipitate flight before the advancing tide.Kynance, lovely as
it is, has its inconveniences.Departing, we met a whole string of tourist-looking people, whom we
benevolently warned that they were too late, at which they did not
seem in the least disappointed.Probably they were one of the numerous
pic-nic parties who come here from Falmouth or Helstone, to spend a
jovial day of eating and drinking, and enjoy the delights of the flesh
rather than the spirit.At any rate the romance and solitude of the place were gone.The quaint
old woman at the serpentine shop--a mild little wooden erection under
the cliff--was being chaffed and bargained with by three youths with
cigars, which defiled the whole air around, and made us take refuge up
the hill.But even there a white umbrella had sprung up like a gigantic
mushroom, and under it sat an energetic lady artist, who, entering at
once into conversation, with a cheerful avidity that implied her not
having talked for a week, informed us of all she was painting, and all
she had meant to paint, where she lodged, and how much she paid for her
lodging--evidently expecting the same confidences from us in return.But we were getting hungry, and between us and dinner was a long
two-miles walk over the steep downs, that were glowing, nay, burning,
under the September sun.So we turned homeward, glad of more than one
rest by the way, and a long pause beside a pretty little stream; where
we were able to offer the immemorial cup of cold water to several
thirsty souls besides ourselves.Some of us by this time were getting
to feel not so young as we had fancied ourselves in the early morning,
and to wish regretfully for Charles and his carriage.However, we got home at last--to find that sad accompaniment of many a
holiday--tidings of sickness and death.Nothing very near us--nothing
that need hurry us home--but enough to sadden us, and make our evening
walk, which we bravely carried out, a far less bright one than that of
the forenoon.The girls had found a way, chiefly on the tops of "hedges," to the
grand rock called Lizard Point.Thither we went, and watched the
sunset--a very fine one; then came back through the village, and made
various purchases of serpentine from John Curgenven's wife, who was
a great deal younger than himself, but not near so handsome or so
original.But a cloud had come over us; it did not, and must not stay--still,
there it was for the time.When the last thing at night I went out into
the glorious moonlight--bright as day--and thought of the soul who had
just passed out of a long and troubled life into the clearness of life
eternal, it seemed as if all was right still.Small cares and worries
dwindled down or melted away--as the petty uglinesses around melted
in the radiance of this glorious harvest moon, which seemed to wrap
one round in a silent peace, like the "garment of praise," which David
speaks about--in exchange for "the spirit of heaviness."DAY THE EIGHTH


And seven days were all we could allow ourselves at the Lizard, if we
meant to see the rest of Cornwall.We began to reckon with sore hearts
that five days were already gone, and it seemed as if we had not seen
half we ought to see, even of our near surroundings."We will take no excursion to-day.We will just have our bath at Housel
Cove and then we will wander about the shore, and examine the Lizard
Lights.Only fancy, our going away to-morrow without having seen the
inside of the Lizard Lights!Oh, I wish we were not leaving so soon.We
shall never like any place as we like the Lizard."Directly after breakfast--and we are
people who never vary from our eight o'clock breakfast, so that we
always see the world in its early morning brightness and freshness--we
went

  "Brushing with hasty steps the dew away,"

along the fields, which led down to Housel or Househole Cove.Before
us, clear in the sunshine, rose the fine headland of Penolver, and
the green <DW72>s of the amphitheatre of Belidden, supposed to be the
remains of a Druidical temple.That, and the chair of Belidden, a
recess in the rock, whence there is a splendid view, with various
archaeological curiosities, true or traditionary, we ought to have
examined, I know.Some of us were content to
rejoice in the general atmosphere of beauty and peace without minute
investigation, and some of us were so eminently practical that "a good
bathe" appeared more important than all the poetry and archaeology in
the world.So we wandered slowly on, rejoicing at having the place all to
ourselves, when we came suddenly upon a tall black figure intently
watching three other black figures, or rather dots, which were climbing
slowly over Penolver.It was our clerical friend of Kynance; with whom, in the natural and
right civility of holiday-makers, we exchanged a courteous good morning.[Illustration: THE LION ROCKS--A SEA IN WHICH NOTHING CAN LIVE.]"Yes, those are my girls up on the cliff there.They have been bathing,
and are now going to walk to Cadgwith.""Then nobody fell into the Devil's Throat at Kynance?They all came
back to you with whole limbs?""Yes," said he smiling, "and they went again for another long walk
in the afternoon.At night, when it turned out to be such splendid
moonlight, they actually insisted on going launce-fishing.Of course
you know about launce-fishing?"I pleaded my utter ignorance of that noble sport."Oh, it is _the_ thing at the Lizard.My boys--and girls too--consider
it the best fun going.The launce is a sort of sand-eel peculiar to
these coasts.It swims about all day, and at night burrows in the sand
just above the waterline, where, when the moon shines on it, you can
trace the silvery gleam of the creature.So you stand up to your ankles
on wet sand, with a crooked iron spear which you dart in and hook him
up, keeping your left hand free to seize him with.""Easy fishing," said I, with a certain pity for the sand-eel.You are apt either to chop him right in
two, or miss him altogether, when off he wriggles in the sand and
disappears.My young people say it requires a practised hand and a
peculiar twist of the wrist, to have any success at all in launce
fishing.It can only be done on moonlight nights--the full moon and
a day or two after--and they are out half the night.They go about
barefoot, which is much safer than soaked shoes and stockings.About
midnight they light a fire on the sand, cook all the fish they have
caught, and have a grand supper, as they had last night.They came home
as merry as crickets about two o'clock this morning.Perhaps you might
not have noticed what a wonderful moonlight night it was?"I had; but it would not have occurred to me to spend it in standing for
hours up to the knees in salt water, catching unfortunate fish.However, tastes differ, and launce-fishing may be a prime delight to
some people; so I faithfully chronicle it, and the proper mode of
pursuing it, as one of the attractions at the Lizard.I am not aware
that it is practised at any other part of the Cornish coast, nor can
I say whether or not it was a pastime of King Arthur and his Knights.One cannot imagine Sir Tristram or Sir Launcelot occupied in spearing a
small sand-eel.The bathing at Housel Cove was delightful as ever.And afterwards we
saw that very rare and beautiful sight, a perfect solar rainbow.Not
the familiar bow of Noah, but a great luminous circle round the sun,
like the halo often seen round the moon, extending over half the sky;
yellow at first, then gradually assuming faint prismatic tints.This
colouring, though never so bright as the ordinary arched rainbow, was
wonderfully tender and delicate.We stood a long time watching it,
till at last it melted slowly out of the sky, leaving behind a sense of
mystery, as of something we had never seen before and might never see
again in all our lives.It was a lovely day, bright and warm as midsummer, tempting us to some
distant excursion; but we had decided to investigate the Lizard Lights.We should have been content to take them for granted, in their purely
poetical phase, as we had watched them night after night.But some of
us were blessed with scientific relatives, who would have despised us
utterly if we had spent a whole week at the Lizard and never gone to
see the Lizard Lights.So we felt bound to do our duty, and admire, if
we could not understand.I chronicle with shame that the careful and
courteous explanations of that most intelligent young man, who met us
at the door of the huge white building, apparently quite glad to have
an opportunity of conducting us through it, were entirely thrown away.We mounted ladders, we looked at Brobdingnagian lamps, we poked into
mysterious machinery for lighting them and for sounding the fog-horn,
we listened to all that was told us, and tried to look as if we took it
in.Very much interested we could not but be at such wonderful results
of man's invention, but as for comprehending!we came away with our
minds as dark as when we went in.I have always found through life that, next to being clever, the safest
thing is to know one's own ignorance and acknowledge it.Therefore let
me leave all description of the astonishing mechanism of the Lizard
Lights--I believe the first experiment of their kind, and not very
long established--to abler pens and more intelligent brains.To see
that young man, scarcely above the grade of a working man, handling
his instruments and explaining them and their uses, seeming to take
for granted that we could understand--which alas!we didn't, not
an atom!--inspired me with a sense of humiliation and awe.Also of
pride at the wonders this generation has accomplished, and is still
accomplishing; employing the gradually comprehended forces of Nature
against herself, as it were, and dominating her evil by ever-new
discoveries and applications of the recondite powers of good.The enormous body of light produced nightly--equal, I think he said,
to 30,000 candles--and the complicated machinery for keeping the
fog-horn continually at work, when even that gigantic blaze became
invisible--all this amount of skill, science, labour, and money,
freely expended for the saving of life, gave one a strong impression of
not only British power but British beneficence.Could King Arthur have
come back again from his sea-engulfed Land of Lyonesse, and stood where
we stood, beside the Lizard Lights, what would he have said to it all?[Illustration: HAULING IN THE BOATS.]Even though we did not understand, we were keenly interested in all we
saw, and still more so in the stories of wrecks which this young man
had witnessed even during the few years, or months--I forget which--of
his stay at the Lizard.He, too, agreed, that the rocks there, called
by the generic name of the Stags, were the most fatal of all on our
coasts to ships outward and homeward bound.Probably because in the
latter case, captain and crews get a trifle careless; and in the
former--as I have heard in sad explanation of many emigrant ships being
lost almost immediately after quitting port--they get drunk.Many of
the sailors are said to come on board "half-seas over," and could the
skilfullest of pilots save a ship with a drunken crew?Be that as it may, the fact remains, that throughout winter almost
every week's chronicle at the Lizard is the same story--wild storms, or
dense fogs, guns of distress heard, a hasty manning of the life-boat,
dragged with difficulty down the steep cliff-road, a brief struggle
with the awful sea, and then, even if a few lives are saved, with the
ship herself all is over."Only last Christmas I saw a vessel go to pieces in ten minutes on the
rocks below there," said the man, after particularising several wrecks,
which seemed to have imprinted themselves on his memory with all their
incidents."Yes, we have a bad time in winter, and the coastguard
men lead a risky life.They are the picked men of the service, and
tolerably well paid, but no money could ever pay them for what they go
through--or the fishermen, who generally are volunteers, and get little
or nothing.""It must be a hard life in these parts, especially in winter," we
observed."Well, perhaps it is, but it's our business, you see."Yes, but not all people do their business, as the mismanagements and
mistakes of this world plainly show.Still, it is a good world, and we felt it so as we strolled along the
sunshiny cliff, talking over all these stories, tragical or heroic,
which had been told us in such a simple matter-of-fact way, as if they
were every-day occurrences.And then, while the young folks went on
"for a good scramble" over Penolver, I sat down for a quiet "think";
that enforced rest, which, as years advance, becomes not painful, but
actually pleasant; in which, if one fails to solve the problems of the
universe, one is prone to con them over, wondering at them all.From the sunny sea and sunny sky, full of a silence so complete that I
could hear every wave as it broke on the unseen rocks below, my mind
wandered to that young fellow among his machinery, with his sickly
eager face and his short cough--indicating that _his_ "business" in
this world, over which he seemed so engrossed, might only too soon
come to an end.Between these apparently eternal powers of Nature,
so strong, so fierce, so irresistible, against which man fought so
magnificently with all his perfection of scientific knowledge and
accuracy of handiwork--and this poor frail human life, which in a
moment might be blown out like a candle, suddenly quenched in darkness,
"there is no skill or knowledge in the grave whither thou goest"--what
a contrast it was!And yet--and yet?--We shall sleep with our fathers, and some of us feel
sometimes so tired that we do not in the least mind going to sleep.But
notwithstanding this, notwithstanding everything without that seems to
imply our perishableness, we are conscious of something within which
is absolutely imperishable.We feel it only stronger and clearer as
life begins to melt away from us; as "the lights in the windows are
darkened, and the daughters of music are brought low."To the young,
death is often a terror, for it seems to put an end to the full, rich,
passionate life beyond which they can see nothing; but to the old,
conscious that this their tabernacle is being slowly dissolved, and yet
its mysterious inhabitant, the wonderful, incomprehensible _me_, is
exactly the same--thinks, loves, suffers, and enjoys, precisely as it
did heaven knows how many years ago--to them, death appears in quite
another shape.He is no longer Death the Enemy, but Death the Friend,
who may--who can tell?--give back all that life has denied or taken
away.He cannot harm us, and he may bless us, with the blessing of
loving children, who believe that, whatever happens, nothing can take
them out of their Father's arms.But I had not come to Cornwall to preach, except to myself now and
then, as this day.My silent sermon was all done by the time the
young folks came back, full of the beauties of their cliff walk, and
their affectionate regrets that I "could never manage it," but must
have felt so dull, sitting on a stone and watching the sheep and the
sea-gulls.I was obliged to confess that I never am "dull,"
as people call it, and love solitude almost as much as society.[Illustration: ENYS DODNAN AND PARDENICK POINTS.]So, each contented in our own way, we went merrily home, to find
waiting for us our cosy tea--the last!--and our faithful Charles, who,
according to agreement, appeared overnight, to take charge of us till
we got back to civilisation and railways."Yes, ladies, here I am," said he with a beaming countenance."And
I've got you the same carriage and the same horse, as you wished, and
I've come in time to give him a good night's rest.Now, when shall you
start, and what do you want to do to-morrow?"Our idea had been to take for our next resting-place Marazion.This
queer-named town had attracted us ever since the days when we learnt
geography.Since, we had heard a good deal about it: how it had
been inhabited by Jewish colonists, who bought tin from the early
Ph[oe]nician workers of the Cornish mines, and been called by them
Mara-Zion--bitter Zion--corrupted by the common people into Market-Jew.Michael's Mount opposite; and attracted
us much more than genteel Penzance.So did a letter we got from the
landlord of its one hotel, promising to take us in, and make us
thoroughly comfortable.Charles declared we could, and even see
a good deal on the road.Mary will be delighted to get another
peep at you ladies, and while I rest the horse you can go in and look
at the old church--it's very curious, they say.And then we'll go on
to Gunwalloe,--there's another church there, close by the sea, built
by somebody who was shipwrecked.But then it's so old and so small.However, we can stop and look at it if you like."His good common sense, and kindliness, when he might so easily have
done his mere duty and taken us the shortest and ugliest route, showing
us nothing, decided us to leave all in Charles's hands, and start at
10 A.M.for Penzance, _via_ Helstone, where we all wished to
stay an hour or two, and find out a "friend," the only one we had in
Cornwall.So all was settled, with but a single regret, that several boating
excursions we had planned with John Curgenven had all fallen through,
and we should never behold some wonderful sea-caves between the Lizard
and Cadgwith, which we had set our hearts upon visiting.Charles fingered his cap with a thoughtful air."I don't see why you
shouldn't, ladies.If I was to go direct and tell John Curgenven to
have a boat ready at Church Cove, and we was to start at nine instead
of ten, and drive there, the carriage might wait while you rowed to
the caves and back; we should still reach Helstone by dinner-time, and
Marazion before dark."And at this addition to his
work Charles looked actually pleased!So--all was soon over, our easy packing done, our bill paid--a very
small one--our goodnights said to the kindly handmaid, Esther, who
hoped we would come back again some time, and promised to keep the
artistic mural decorations of our little parlour in memory of us.My
young folks went to bed, and then, a little before midnight, when all
the house was quiet, I put a shawl over my head, unlatched the innocent
door--no bolts or bars at the Lizard--and went out into the night.What a night it was!--mild as summer, clear as day: the full moon
sailing aloft in an absolutely cloudless sky.Not a breath, not a
sound--except the faint thud-thud of the in-coming waves, two miles
off, at Kynance, the outline of which, and of the whole coast, was
distinctly visible.A silent earth, lying under a silent heaven.Looking up, one felt almost like a disembodied soul, free to cleave
through infinite space and gain--what?Is it human or divine, this ceaseless longing after something never
attained, this craving after the eternal life, which, if fully believed
in, fully understood, would take all the bitterness out of this life?But so much is given, and all given is so infinitely good, except where
we ourselves turn it into evil, that surely more, and better, will be
given to us by and by.Those only truly enjoy life who fear not death:
who can say of the grave as if it were their bed: "I will lay me down
in peace and take my rest, for it is Thou only, O God, who makest me to
dwell in safety."DAY THE NINTH


And our last at the Lizard, which a week ago had been to us a mere word
or dot in a map; now we carried away from it a living human interest in
everything and everybody.Esther bade us a cordial farewell: Mrs.Curgenven, standing at the
door of her serpentine shop, repeated the good wishes, and informed
us that John and his boat had already started for Church Cove.As we
drove through the bright little Lizard Town, and past the Church of
Landewednack, wondering if we should ever see either again, we felt
quite sad.Leaving the carriage and Charles at the nearest point to the Cove, we
went down the steep descent, and saw John rocking in his boat, and
beckoning to us with a bland and smiling countenance.But between us
and him lay a sort of causeway, of the very roughest rocks, slippery
with sea-weed, and beat upon by waves--such waves!Yet clearly, if we
meant to get into the boat at all, we must seize our opportunity and
jump in between the flux and reflux of that advancing tide.I am not a coward: I love boats, and was well used to them in my youth,
but now--my heart misgave me.There were but two alternatives--to
stop the pleasure of the whole party, and leave Cornwall with these
wonderful sea-caves unseen, or to let my children go alone.Neither was
possible; so I hailed a sturdy youth at work hard by, and asked him if
he would take charge of an old lady across the rocks.He grinned from
ear to ear, but came forward, and did his duty manfully and kindly.My
young folks, light as feathers, bounded after; and with the help of
John Curgenven, chivalrous and careful as ever, we soon found ourselves
safely in the boat.[Illustration: JOHN CURGENVEN FISHING.]"Here we go up, up, up, and here we go down,
down, down," was the principle of our voyage, the most serious one we
ever took in an open boat with a single pair of oars.Never did I see
such waves,--at least, never did I float upon them, in a boat that went
tossing like a bit of cork out into the open sea.John seemed not to mind them in the least.His strong arms swept the
boat along, and he still found breath to talk to us, pointing out the
great gloomy cliffs we were passing under, and telling us stories of
wrecks, the favourite theme--and no wonder.This sunshiny morning that iron-bound coast looked awful enough; what
must it have looked like, on the winter night when the emigrant ship
_Brest_ went down!"Yes, it was about ten o'clock at night," said John."I was fast asleep
in bed, but they knocked me up; I got on my clothes and was off in
five minutes.They are always glad enough to get us fishermen, the
coastguard are.Mine was the first boat-load we brought ashore; we
would only take women and children that time.They were all in their
night-gowns, and they couldn't speak a word of English, but we made
them understand somehow.One woman threw her three children down to me,
and stayed behind on the wreck with two more.""Oh, no, they were very quiet, dazed like.Some of them seemed to be
saying their prayers.But they made no fuss at all, not even the little
ones.They lay down in the bottom of the boat, and we rowed ashore
as fast as we could, to Cadgwith.Then we rowed back and fetched two
boatloads more.We saved a lot of lives that wreck, but only their
lives; they had scarcely a rag of clothes on, and some of the babies
were as naked as when they were born.""Everybody: we always do it," answered John, as if surprised at
the question."The fishermen's cottages were full, and so was the
parsonage.We gave them clothes, and kept them till they could be sent
away.Yes, it was an awful night; I got something to remember it by,
here."He held out his hand, from which we noticed half of one finger was
missing."It got squeezed off with a rope somehow.I didn't heed it much at
the time," said John carelessly."But look, we're at the first of the
caves.I'll row in close, ladies, and let you see it."So we had to turn our minds from the vision of the wreck of the
_Brest_, which John's simple words made so terribly vivid, to examine
Raven's Ugo, and Dolor Ugo; _ugo_ is Cornish for cave.Over the
entrance of the first a pair of ravens have built from time immemorial.It is just accessible, the opening being above the sea-line, and hung
with quantities of sea-ferns.Here in smuggling days, many kegs of
spirits used to be secreted: and many a wild drama no doubt has been
acted there--daring encounters between smugglers and coastguard men,
not bloodless on either side.Dolor Ugo is now inaccessible and unusable.Its only floor is of
heaving water, a deep olive green, and so clear that we could see the
fishes swimming about pursuing a shoal of launce.Its high-vaulted roof
and sides were tinted all colours--rose-pink, rich dark brown, and
purple.The entrance was wide enough to admit a boat, but it gradually
narrowed into impenetrable darkness.How far inland it goes no one can
tell, as it could only be investigated by swimming, a rather dangerous
experiment.Boats venture as far as the daylight goes; and it is a
favourite trick of the boatman suddenly to fire off a pistol, which
reverberates like thunder through the mysterious gloom of the cave.A solemn place; an awful place, some of us thought, as we rowed in, and
out again, into the sunshiny open sea.Which we had now got used to;
and it was delicious to go dancing like a feather up and down, trusting
to John Curgenven's stout arm and fearless, honest face.We felt sad to
think this would be our last sight of him and of the magnificent Lizard
coast.But the minutes were lessening, and we had some way still to
row.Also to land, which meant a leap between the waves upon slippery
sea-weedy rocks.In silent dread I watched my children accomplish this
feat, and then--

Well, it is over, and I sit here writing these details.But I would
not do it again, not even for the pleasure of revisiting Dolor Ugo and
having a row with John Curgenven.he looked relieved when he saw "the old lady" safe on
_terra firma_, and we left him waving adieux, as he "rocked in his
boat in the bay."May his stout arms and kindly heart long remain to
him!May his summer tourists be many and his winter shipwrecks few!I am sure he will always do his duty, and see that other people do
theirs, or, like the proverbial Cornishmen, he "will know the reason
why."Charles was ready; waiting patiently in front of a blacksmith's shop.fate had overtaken us in the shape of an innocent leak in
John Curgenven's boat; nothing, doubtless, to him, who was in the habit
of baling it out with his boots, and then calmly putting them on again,
but a little inconvenient to us.To drive thirty miles with one's
garments soaked up to the knees was not desirable.There was a cottage close by, whence came the gleam of a delicious fire
and the odour of ironing clothes.We went in: the mistress, evidently
a laundress, advanced and offered to dry us--which she did, chattering
all the while in the confidential manner of country folks.A hard working, decent body she was, and as for her house, it was a
perfect picture of cleanliness and tidiness.Its two rooms, kitchen and
bedroom, were absolutely speckless.When we noticed this, and said we
found the same in many Cornish cottages; she almost seemed offended at
the praise."Oh, that's nothing, ma'am.We hereabouts all likes to have our places
tidy.Mine's not over tidy to-day because of the washing.But if you was to come of a Sunday.Her eye
caught something in a dark corner, at which she flew, apron in hand."I
declare, I'm quite ashamed.I didn't think we had one in the house."Dried, warmed, and refreshed, but having found the greatest difficulty
in inducing the good woman to receive any tangible thanks for her
kindness, we proceeded on our journey; going over the same ground which
we had traversed already, and finding Pradenack Down as bleak and
beautiful as ever.Our first halt was at the door of Mary Mundy, who,
with her unappreciated brother, ran out to meet us, and looked much
disappointed when she found we had not come to stay."But you will come some time, ladies, and I'll make you so comfortable.And you'll give my duty to the professor"--it was vain to explain that
four hundred miles lay between our home and his.He was a very nice gentleman, please'm.I shall be delighted to
see him again, please'm," &c., &c.

We left the three--Mary, her brother, and Charles--chattering together
in a dialect which I do not attempt to reproduce, and sometimes could
hardly understand.Us, the natives indulged with their best English,
but among themselves they talked the broadest Cornish.It was a very old church, and a preternaturally old beadle showed it in
a passive manner, not recognising in the least its points of interest
and beauty, except some rows of open benches with ancient oak backs,
wonderfully carved."Our vicar dug them up from under the flooring and turned them into
pews.There was a gentleman here the other day who said there was
nothing like them in all England."Most curious, in truth, they were, and suited well the fine old
building--a specimen of how carefully and lavishly our forefathers
built "for God."We, who build for ourselves, are rather surprised
to find in out-of-the-way nooks like this, churches that in size and
adornment must have cost years upon years of loving labour as well as
money.It was pleasant to know that the present incumbent, a man of
archaeological tastes, appreciated his blessings, and took the utmost
care of his beautiful old church.even though he cannot
boast the power of his predecessor, the Reverend Thomas Flavel, who
died in 1682, and whose monument in the chancel really expresses the
sentiments--in epitaph--of the period:

  "Earth, take thine earth; my sin, let Satan have it;
  The world my goods; my soul my God who gave it.For from these four, Earth, Satan, World, and God,
  My flesh, my sin, my goods, my soul, I had."But it does not mention that the reverend gentleman was the best
_ghost-layer_ in all England, and that when he died his ghost also
required to be laid, by a brother clergyman, in a spot on the down
still pointed out by the people of Mullion, who, being noted for
extreme longevity, have passed down this tradition from generation
to generation, with an earnest credulity that we of more enlightened
counties can hardly understand.From Mullion we went on to Gunwalloe.Its church, "small and old," as
Charles had depreciatingly said, had been so painfully "restored,"
and looked so bran-new and uninteresting that we contented ourselves
with a distant look.It was close to the sea--probably built on the
very spot where its pious founder had been cast ashore.The one curious
point about it was the detached belfry, some yards distant from the
church itself.It sat alone in a little cove, down which a sluggish
river crawled quietly seaward.A sweet quiet place, but haunted, as
usual, by tales of cruel shipwrecks--of sailors huddled for hours on
a bit of rock just above the waves, till a boat could put out and
save the few survivors; of sea treasures continually washed ashore
from lost ships--Indian corn, coffee, timber, dollars--many are still
found in the sand after a storm.And one treasure more, of which the
recollection is still kept at Gunwalloe, "a little dead baby in its cap
and night-gown, with a necklace of coral beads."Our good horse, with the dogged
persistency of Cornish horses and Cornish men, plodded on mile after
mile.Sometimes for an hour or more we did not meet a living soul;
then we came upon a stray labourer, or passed through a village where
healthy-looking children, big-eyed, brown-faced, and dirty-handed,
picturesque if not pretty, stared at us from cottage doors, or from the
gates of cottage gardens full of flowers and apples.Hungry and thirsty, we could not
resist them.After passing several trees, hung thickly with delicious
fruit, we attacked the owner of one of them, a comely young woman, with
a baby in her arms and another at her gown."Oh yes, ma'am, you may have as many apples as you like, if your young
ladies will go and get them."And while they did it, she stood talking by the carriage door, pouring
out to me her whole domestic history with a simple frankness worthy of
the golden age."No, really I couldn't," putting back my payment--little enough-- for
the splendid basket of apples which the girls brought back in triumph."This is such a good apple year; the pigs would get them if the young
ladies didn't.You're kindly welcome to them--well then, if you are
determined, say sixpence."On which magnificent "sixpenn'orth," we lived for days!Indeed I think
we brought some of it home as a specimen of Cornish fruit and Cornish
liberality.[Illustration: THE ARMED KNIGHT AND THE LONG SHIP'S LIGHTHOUSE.]Helstone was reached at last, and we were not sorry for rest and food
in the old-fashioned inn, whence we could look out of window, and
contemplate the humours of the little town, which doubtless considered
itself a very great one.It was market day, and the narrow street was
thronged with beasts and men--the latter as sober as the former,
which spoke well for Cornwall.Sober and civil too was every one we
addressed in asking our way to the house of our unknown friend, whose
only address we had was Helstone.But he seemed well known in the town,
though neither a rich man, nor a great man, nor--No, I cannot say he
was not a clever man, for in his own line, mechanical engineering, he
must have been exceedingly clever.And he was what people call "a great
character;" would have made such an admirable study for a novelist,
manipulated into an unrecognisable ideal--the only way in which it is
fair to put people in books.When I saw him I almost regretted that I
write novels no more.We passed through the little garden--all ablaze with autumn colour,
every inch utilised for either flowers, vegetables, or fruit--went into
the parlour, sent our cards and waited the result.In two minutes our friend appeared, and gave us such a welcome!But to
explain it I must trench a little upon the sanctities of private life,
and tell the story of this honest Cornishman.When still young he went to Brazil, and was employed by an English
gold-mining company there, for some years.Afterwards he joined
an engineering firm, and superintended dredging, the erection of
saw-mills, &c., finally building a lighthouse, of which latter work he
had the sole charge, and was exceedingly proud.His conscientiousness,
probity, and entire reliableness made him most valuable to the
firm; whom he served faithfully for many years.When they, as well
as himself, returned to England, he still kept up a correspondence
with them, preserving towards every member of the family the most
enthusiastic regard and devotion.He rushed into the parlour, a tall, gaunt, middle-aged man, with a
shrewd, kindly face, which beamed all over with delight, as he began
shaking hands indiscriminately, saying how kind it was of us to come,
and how welcome we were.It was explained which of us he had specially to welcome, the others
being only humble appendages, friends of the family, this well-beloved
family, whose likenesses for two generations we saw everywhere about
the room."Yes, miss, there they all are, your dear grandfather" (alas, only a
likeness now!They were all so good to
me, and I would do anything for them, or for any one of their name.If
I got a message that they wanted me for anything, I'd be off to London,
or to Brazil, or anywhere, in half-an-hour."added the good man when the rapture and
excitement of the moment had a little subsided, and his various
questions as to the well-being of "the family" had been asked and
answered."You have dined, you say, but you'll have a cup of tea.My
wife (that's the little maid I used to talk to your father about, miss;
I always told him I wouldn't stay in Brazil, I must go back to England
and marry my little maid), my wife makes the best cup of tea in all
Cornwall.And there entered, in afternoon gown and cap, probably just put on, a
middle-aged, but still comely matron, who insisted that, even at this
early hour--3 P.M.--to get a cup of tea for us was "no trouble
at all.""Indeed, she wouldn't think anything a trouble, no more than I should,
miss, if it was for your family.It was here suggested that they were not a "forgetting" family.Nor
was he a man likely to be soon forgotten.While the cup of tea, which
proved to be a most sumptuous meal, was preparing, he took us all over
his house, which was full of foreign curiosities, and experimental
inventions.One, I remember, being a musical instrument, a sort of
organ, which he had begun making when a mere boy, and taken with him
all the way to Brazil and back.It had now found refuge in the little
room he called his "workshop," which was filled with odds and ends that
would have been delightful to a mechanical mind.He expounded them with
enthusiasm, and we tried not to betray an ignorance, which in some of
us would have been a sort of hereditary degradation.they were clever--your father and your uncle!--and how proud we
all were when we finished our lighthouse, and got the Emperor to light
it up for the first time.Look here, ladies, what do you think this is?"He took out a small parcel, and solemnly unwrapped from it fold after
fold of paper, till he came to the heart of it--a small wax candle!"This was the candle the Emperor used to light our lighthouse.I've
kept it for nearly thirty years, and I'll keep it as long as I live.Every year on the anniversary of the day I light it, drink his
Majesty's health, and the health of all your family, miss, and then I
put it out again.So"--carefully re-wrapping the relic in its numerous
envelopes--"so I hope it will last my time."Here the mistress came behind her good man, and they exchanged a
smile--the affectionate smile of two who had never been more than two,
Darby and Joan, but all sufficient to each other.How we got through it I hardly know,
but travelling is hungry work, and the viands were delicious.The
beneficence of our kind hosts, however, was not nearly done."Come, ladies, I'll show you my garden, and--(give me a basket and the
grape-scissors,)" added he in a conjugal aside.Which resulted in our
carrying away with us the biggest bunches in the whole vinery, as well
as a quantity of rosy apples, stuffed into every available pocket and
bag."Nonsense, nonsense," was the answer to vain remonstrances."D'ye
think I wouldn't give the best of everything I had to your family?How your father used to laugh at me about my
little maid!Oh yes, I'm glad I came
home.And now your father and your uncle are home too, and perhaps some
day they'll come to see me down here--wouldn't it be a proud day for
me!It was touching, and rare as touching, this passionate personal
fidelity.It threw us back, at least such of us as were sentimentally
inclined, upon that something in Cornish nature which found its
exposition in Arthur and his faithful knights, down to "bold Sir
Bedevere," and apparently, is still not lost in Cornwall.With a sense of real regret, feeling that it would be long ere we
might meet his like--such shrewd simplicity, earnest enthusiasm, and
exceeding faithfulness--we bade good-bye to the honest man; leaving him
and his wife standing at their garden-gate, an elderly Adam and Eve,
desiring nothing outside their own little paradise.Which of us could
say more, or as much?Gratefully we "talked them over," as we drove on through the pretty
country round Helstone--inland country; for we had no time to go and
see the Loe Pool, a small lake, divided from the sea by a bar of sand.This is supposed to be the work of the Cornwall man-demon, Tregeagle;
and periodically cut through, with solemn ceremonial, by the Mayor of
Helstone, when the "meeting of the waters," fresh and salt, is said to
be an extremely curious sight.But we did not see it, nor yet Nonsloe
House, close by, which is held by the tenure of having to provide a
boat and nets whenever the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Cornwall
wishes to fish in the Loe Pool.A circumstance which has never happened
yet, certainly!Other curiosities _en route_ we also missed, the stones of
Tremenkeverne, half a ton each, used as missiles in a notable fight
between two saints, St.Just of the Land's End, and St.Keverne of the
Lizard, and still lying in a field to prove the verity of the legend.Also the rock of Goldsithney, where, when the "fair land of Lyonesse"
was engulfed by the sea, an ancestor of the Trevelyans saved himself by
swimming his horse, and landing; and various other remarkable places,
with legends attached, needing much credulity, or imagination, to
believe in.But, fearing to be benighted ere reaching Marazion, we passed them all,
and saw nothing more interesting than the ruins of disused tin mines,
which Charles showed us, mournfully explaining how the mining business
had of late years drifted away from Cornwall, and how hundreds of the
once thriving community had been compelled to emigrate or starve.As we
neared Marazion, these melancholy wrecks with their little hillocks of
mining debris rose up against the evening sky, the image of desolation.Michael's Mount, the picture in little of Mont St.Michel,
in Normandy, appeared in the middle of Mount's Bay.Lastly, after
a gorgeous sunset, in a golden twilight and silvery moonlight, we
entered Marazion;-and found it, despite its picturesque name, the most
commonplace little town imaginable!We should have regretted our rash decision, and gone on to Penzance,
but for the hearty welcome given us at a most comfortable and home-like
inn, which determined us to keep to our first intention, and stay.So, after our habit of making the best of things, we walked down to the
ugly beach, and investigated the dirty-looking bay--in the lowest of
all low tides, with a soppy, sea-weedy causeway running across to St.By advice of Charles, we made acquaintance with an old
boatman he knew, a Norwegian who had drifted hither--shipwrecked, I
believe--settled down and married an English woman, but whose English
was still of the feeblest kind.However, he had an honest face; so we
engaged him to take us out bathing early to-morrow."Wouldn't you
like to row round the Mount?--When you've had your tea, I'll come back
for you, and help you down to the shore--it's rather rough, but nothing
like what you have done, ma'am," added he encouragingly."And it will
be bright moonlight, and the Mount will look so fine."So, the spirit of adventure conquering our weariness, we went.When
I think how it looked next morning--the small, shallow bay, with its
toy-castle in the centre, I am glad our first vision of it was under
the glamour of moonlight, with the battlemented rock throwing dark
shadows across the shimmering sea.In the mysterious beauty of that
night row round the Mount, we could imagine anything; its earliest
inhabitant, the giant Cormoran, killed by that "valiant Cornishman,"
the illustrious Jack; the lovely St.Keyne, a king's daughter, who came
thither on pilgrimage; and, passing down from legend to history, Henry
de la Pomeroy, who, being taken prisoner, caused himself to be bled to
death in the Castle; Sir John Arundel, slain on the sands, and buried
in the Chapel; Perkin Warbeck's unfortunate wife, who took refuge at
St.And so on, and so on,
through the centuries, to the family of St.Aubyn, who bought it in
1660, and have inhabited it ever since."Very nice people," we heard
they were; who have received here the Queen, the Prince of Wales, and
other royal personages.Yet, looking up as we rowed under the gloomy rock, we could fancy his
giant ghost sitting there, on the spot where he killed his wife, for
bringing in her apron greenstone, instead of granite, to build the
chapel with.Which being really built of greenstone the story must be
true!What a pleasure it is to be able to believe anything!Some of us could have stayed out half the night, floating along in the
mild soft air and dreamy moonlight, which made even the commonplace
little town look like a fairy scene, and exalted St.Michael's Mount
into a grand fortress, fit for its centuries of legendary lore--but
others preferred going to bed.Not however without taking a long look out
of the window upon the bay, which now, at high tide, was one sheet of
rippling moon-lit water, with the grim old Mount, full of glimmering
lights like eyes, sitting silent in the midst of the silent sea.[Illustration: CORNISH FISHERMAN.]DAY THE TENTH


I cannot advise Marazion as a bathing place.What a down-come from the
picturesque vision of last night, to a small ugly fishy-smelling beach,
which seemed to form a part of the town and its business, and was
overlooked from everywhere!Yet on it two or three family groups were
evidently preparing for a dip, or rather a wade of about a quarter of a
mile in exceedingly dirty sea water."This will never do," we said to our old Norwegian."You must row us to
some quiet cove along the shore, and away from the town."He nodded his head, solemn and mute as the dumb boatman of dead Elaine,
rowed us out seaward for about half-a-mile, and then proceeded to
fasten the boat to a big stone, and walk ashore.The water still did
not come much above his knees--he seemed quite indifferent to it.Well, we could but do at Rome as the Romans do.Toilette in an open
boat was evidently the custom of the country.And the sun was warm, the
sea safe and shallow.Indeed, so rapidly did it subside, that by the
time the bath was done, we were aground, and had to call at the top of
our voices to our old man, who sat, with his back to us, dim in the
distance, on another big stone, calmly smoking the pipe of peace."We'll not try this again," was the unanimous resolve, as, after
politely declining a suggestion that "the ladies should walk ashore--"
did he think we were amphibious?--we got ourselves floated off at last,
and rowed to the nearest landing point, the entrance to St.Probably nowhere in England is found the like of this place.Such
a curious mingling of a mediaeval fortress and modern residence; of
antiquarian treasures and everyday business; for at the foot of the
rock is a fishing village of about thirty cottages, which carries
on a thriving trade; and here also is a sort of station for the tiny
underground-railway, which worked by a continuous chain, fulfils the
very necessary purpose (failing Giant Cormoran, and wife) of carrying
up coals, provisions, luggage, and all other domestic necessaries to
the hill top.Thither we climbed by a good many weary steps, and thought, delightful
as it may be to dwell on the top of a rock in the midst of the sea,
like eagles in an eyrie, there are certain advantages in living on a
level country road, or even in a town street.Aubyns manage when they go out to dinner?Two years afterwards,
when I read in the paper that one of the daughters of the house,
leaning over the battlements, had lost her balance and fallen down,
mercifully unhurt, to the rocky <DW72> below--the very spot where we
to-day sat so quietly gazing out on the lovely sea view--I felt with
a shudder that on the whole, it would be a trying thing to bring up a
young family on St.Still, generation after generation of honourable St.Aubyns have
brought up their families there, and oh!How fresh, and yet mild blew the soft sea-wind outside of it, and
inside, what endless treasures there were for the archaeological mind!The chapel alone was worth a morning's study, even though shown--odd
anachronism--by a footman in livery, who pointed out with great gusto
the entrance to a vault discovered during the last repairs, where was
found the skeleton of a large man--his bones only--no clue whatever as
to who he was or when imprisoned there.The "Jeames" of modern days
told us this tale with a noble indifference.Nothing of the kind was
likely to happen to him.Further still we were fortunate enough to penetrate, and saw the Chevy
Chase Hall, with its cornice of hunting scenes, the drawing-room, the
school-room--only fancy learning lessons there, amidst the veritable
evidence of the history one was studying!And perhaps the prettiest bit
of it all was our young guide, herself a St.Aubyn, with her simple
grace and sweet courtesy, worthy of one of the fair ladies worshipped
by King Arthur's knights.[Illustration: THE SEINE BOAT--A PERILOUS MOMENT.]We did not like encroaching on her kindness, though we could have
stayed all day, admiring the curious things she showed us.So we
descended the rock, and crossed the causeway, now dry, but very rough
walking--certainly St.Michael's Mount has its difficulties as a modern
dwelling-house--and went back to our inn.For, having given our
horse a forenoon's rest, we planned a visit to that spot immortalised
by nursery rhyme--

  "As I was going to St.Ives
  I met a man with seven wives.Each wife had seven sacks;
  Each sack had seven cats;
  Each cat had seven kits;
  Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,--
  How many were there going to St.--One; and after we had been there, we felt sure he never went again!There were two roads, we learnt, to that immortal town; one very good,
but dull; the other bad--and beautiful.We chose the latter, and never
repented.Nor, in passing through Penzance, did we repent not having taken up our
quarters there.It was pretty, but so terribly "genteel," so extremely
civilised.Glancing up at the grand hotel, we thought with pleasure of
our old-fashioned inn at Marazion, where the benign waiter took quite
a fatherly interest in our proceedings, even to giving us for dinner
our very own blackberries, gathered yesterday on the road, and politely
hindering another guest from helping himself to half a dishful, as
"they belonged to the young ladies."Truly, there are better things in
life than fashionable hotels.But the neighbourhood of Penzance is lovely.Shrubs and flowers such
as one sees on the shores of the Mediterranean grew and flourished in
cottage-gardens, and the forest trees we drove under, whole avenues
of them, were very fine; gentlemen's seats appeared here and there,
surrounded with the richest vegetation, and commanding lovely views.As
the road gradually mounted upwards, we saw, clear as in a panorama, the
whole coast from the Lizard Point to the Land's End,--which we should
behold to-morrow.For, hearing that every week-day about a hundred tourists in carriages,
carts, and omnibuses, usually flocked thither, we decided that the
desire of our lives, the goal of our pilgrimage, should be visited
by us on a Sunday.We thought that to drive us thither in solitary
Sabbatic peace would be fully as good for Charles's mind and morals as
to hang all day idle about Marazion; and he seemed to think so himself.Therefore, in prospect of to-morrow, he dealt very tenderly with his
horse to-day, and turned us out to walk up the heaviest hills, of which
there were several, between Penzance and Castle-an-Dinas."There it is," he said at last, stopping in the midst of a wide moor
and pointing to a small building, sharp against the sky."The carriage
can't get further, but you can go on, ladies, and I'll stop and gather
some blackberries for you."For brambles, gorse bushes, and clumps of fading heather, with one or
two small stunted trees, were now the only curiosities of this, King
Arthur's famed hunting castle, and hunting ground, which spread before
us for miles and miles.Passing a small farm-house, we made our way to
the building Charles pointed out, standing on the highest ridge of the
promontory, whose furthest point is the Land's End.Standing there, we
could see--or could have seen but that the afternoon had turned grey
and slightly misty--the ocean on both sides.Inland, the view seemed
endless.Roughtor and Brown Willy, two Dartmoor hills, are said to be
visible sometimes.Nearer, little white dots of houses show the mining
districts of Redruth and Camborne.A single wayfarer, looking like a
working man in his Sunday best going to visit friends, but evidently
tired, as if he had walked for miles, just glanced at us, and passed
on.We stood, all alone, on the very spot where many a time must have
stood King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, Sir Launcelot, and the other
knights--or the real human beings, whether barbarian or not, who formed
the originals of those mythical personages.Nothing was left but a common-place little tower,
built up of the fragments of the old castle, and a wide, pathless
moor, over which the wind sighed, and the mist crept.No memorial
whatever of King Arthur, except the tradition--which time and change
have been powerless to annihilate--that such a man once existed.The
long vitality which the legend keeps proves that he must have been
a remarkable man in his day.Romance itself cannot exist without a
foundation in reality.So I preached to my incredulous juniors, who threw overboard King
Arthur and took to blackberry-gathering; and to conversation with a
most comely Cornishwoman, milking the prettiest of Cornish cows in the
lonely farm-yard, which was the only sign of humanity for miles and
miles.We admired herself and her cattle; we drank her milk, offering
for it the usual payment.But the picturesque milkmaid shook her head
and demanded just double what even the dearest of London milk-sellers
would have asked for the quantity.Which sum we paid in silence,
and I only record the fact here in order to state that spite of our
foreboding railway friend at Falmouth, this was the only instance in
which we were ever "taken in," or in the smallest degree imposed upon,
in Cornwall.Another hour, slowly driving down the gradual <DW72> of the country,
through a mining district much more cheerful than that beyond Marazion.The mines were all apparently in full work, and the mining villages
were pretty, tidy, and cosy-looking, even picturesque.Ives the houses had quite a foreign look, but when we descended to
the town, its dark, narrow streets, pervaded by a "most ancient and
fish-like smell," were anything but attractive.As was our hotel, where, as a matter of duty, we ordered tea, but
doubted if we should enjoy it, and went out again to see what little
there seemed to be seen, puzzling our way through the gloomy and not
too fragrant streets, till at last in despair we stopped a bland,
elderly, Methodist-minister-looking gentleman, and asked him the way to
the sea."You're strangers here, ma'am?"I owned the humbling fact, as the inhabitant of St."And is it the pilchard fishery you want to see?A few pilchards have been seen already.There are the boats, the
fishermen are all getting ready.It's a fine sight to see them start.Would you like to come and look at them?"He had turned back and was walking with us down the street, pointing
out everything that occurred to him as noticeable, in the kindest and
civilest way.When we apologised for troubling him, and would have
parted company, our friend made no attempt to go."Oh, I've nothing at all to do, except"--he took out the biggest and
most respectable of watches--"except to attend a prayer-meeting at
half-past six.I should have time to show you the town; we think it is
a very nice little town.I ought to know it; I've lived in it, boy and
man for thirty-seven years.But now I have left my business to my sons,
and I just go about and amuse myself, looking into the shop now and
then just for curiosity.You must have seen my old shop, ladies, if you
came down that street."Which he named, and also gave us his own name, which we had seen over
the shop door, but I shall not record either.Not that I think the
honest man is ever likely to read such "light" literature as this book,
or to recall the three wanderers to whom he was so civil and kind, and
upon whom he poured out an amount of local and personal facts, which
we listened to--as a student of human nature is prone to do--with an
amused interest in which the comic verged on the pathetic.How large
to each man seems his own little world, and what child-like faith he
has in its importance to other people!I shall always recall our friend
at St.Ives, with his prayer-meetings, his chapel-goings--I concluded
he was a Methodist, a sect very numerous in Cornwall--his delight in
his successful shop and well-brought-up sons, who managed it so well,
leaving him to enjoy his _otium cum dignitate_--no doubt a municipal
dignity, for he showed us the Town Hall with great gusto.Evidently to
his honest, simple soul, St.By and by again he pulled out the turnip-like watch."Just ten minutes
to get to my prayer-meeting, and I never like to be late, I have been a
punctual man all my life, ma'am," added he, half apologetically, till
I suggested that this was probably the cause of his peace and success.Upon which he smiled, lifted his hat with a benign adieu, hoped we had
liked St.Ives--we had liked his company at any rate--and with a final
pointing across the street, "There's my shop, ladies, if you would care
to look at it," trotted away to his prayer-meeting.Ives, especially Tregenna, its
ancient mansion transformed into an hotel, is exceedingly pretty, but
night was falling fast, and we saw nothing.Speedily we despatched a
most untempting meal, and hurried Charles's departure, lest we should
be benighted, as we nearly were, during the long miles of straight and
unlovely road--the good road--between here and Penzance.We had done
our duty, we had seen the place, but as, in leaving it behind us, we
laughingly repeated the nursery rhyme, we came to the conclusion that
the man who was "_going_ to St.Ives" was the least fortunate of all
those notable individuals.DAY THE ELEVENTH


The last thing before retiring, we had glanced out on a gloomy sea, a
starless sky, pitch darkness, broken only by those moving lights on St.Michael's Mount, and thought anxiously of the morrow.It would be hard,
if after journeying thus far and looking forward to it so many years,
the day on which we went to the Land's End should turn out a wet day!Still "hope on, hope ever," as we used to write in our copy-books.Some
of us, I think, still go on writing it in empty air, and will do so
till the hand is dust.It was with a feeling almost of solemnity that we woke and looked out
on the dawn, grey and misty, but still not wet.To be just on the point
of gaining the wish of a life-time, however small, is a fact rare
enough to have a certain pathos in it.We slept again, and trusted
for the best, which by breakfast-time really came, in flickering
sun-gleams, and bits of hopeful blue sky.We wondered for the last
time, as we had wondered for half a century, "what the Land's End would
be like," and then started, rather thoughtful than merry, to find out
the truth of the case.Glad as we were to have for our expedition this quiet Sunday instead
of a tumultuous week day, conscience smote us in driving through
Penzance, with the church-bells ringing, and the people streaming along
to morning service, all in their Sunday best.Perhaps we might manage
to go to afternoon church at Sennen, or St.Sennen's, which we knew
by report, as the long-deceased father of a family we were acquainted
with had been curate there early in the century, and we had promised
faithfully "just to go and look at the old place."But one can keep Sunday sometimes even outside church-doors.I shall
never forget the Sabbatic peace of that day; those lonely and lovely
roads, first rich with the big trees and plentiful vegetation about
Penzance, then gradually growing barer and barer as we drove along the
high promontory which forms the extreme point westward of our island.The way along which so many tourist-laden vehicles pass daily was
now all solitary; we scarcely saw a soul, except perhaps a labourer
leaning over a gate in his decent Sunday clothes, or two or three
children trotting to school or church, with their books under their
arms.Unquestionably Cornwall is a respectable, sober-minded county;
religious-minded too, whether Methodist, Quaker, or other nonconformist
sects, of which there are a good many, or decent, conservative Church
of England.Buryan's--a curious old church founded on the place where
an Irishwoman, Saint Buriana, is said to have made her hermitage.A
few stray cottages comprised the whole village.There was nothing
special to see, except to drink in the general atmosphere of peace and
sunshine and solitude, till we came to Treryn, the nearest point to the
celebrated Logan or rocking-stone.From childhood we had read about it; the most remarkable specimen in
England of those very remarkable stones, whether natural or artificial,
who can decide?"Which the touch of a finger alone sets moving,
  But all earth's powers cannot shake from their base."Not quite true, this; since in 1824 a rash and foolish Lieutenant
Goldsmith (let his name be gibbeted for ever!)did come with a boat's
crew, and by main force remove the Logan a few inches from the point
on which it rests.Indignant justice very properly compelled him, at
great labour and pains, to put it back again, but it has never rocked
properly since.By Charles's advice we took a guide, a solemn-looking youth, who
stalked silently ahead of us along the "hedges," which, as at the
Lizard, furnished the regular path across the fields coastwards.Soon the gleaming circle of sea again flashed upon us, from behind a
labyrinth of rocks, whence we met a couple of tourists returning."You'll find it a pretty stiff climb to the Logan, ladies," said one of
them in answer to a question.And so we should have done, indeed, had not our guide's hand been
much readier than his tongue.I, at least, should never have got even
so far as that little rock-nest where I located myself--a somewhat
anxious-minded old hen--and watched my chickens climb triumphantly that
enormous mass of stone which we understood to be the Logan.they shouted across the dead stillness, the
lovely solitude of sky and sea.And I suppose it did rock, but must
honestly confess _I_ could not see it stir a single inch.However, it was a big stone, a very big stone, and the stones
around it were equally huge and most picturesquely thrown together.Also--delightful to my young folks!--they furnished the most
adventurous scramble that heart could desire.I alone felt a certain
relief when we were all again on smooth ground, with no legs or arms
broken.The cliff-walk between the Logan and the Land's End is said to be one
of the finest in England for coast scenery.Treryn or Treen Dinas,
Pardeneck Point, and Tol Pedn Penwith had been named as places we ought
to see, but this was impracticable.We had to content ourselves with a
dull inland road, across a country gradually getting more barren and
ugly, till we found ourselves suddenly at what seemed the back-yard of
a village public-house, where two or three lounging stable-men came
forward to the carriage, and Charles jumped down from his box.I forbear to translate the world of meaning implied in that brief
exclamation.Perhaps we shall admire the place more
when we have ceased to be hungry."The words of wisdom were listened to; and we spent our first quarter of
an hour at the Land's End in attacking a skeleton "remain" of not too
daintily-cooked beef, and a cavernous cheese, in a tiny back parlour
of the--let me give it its right name--First and Last Inn, of Great
Britain."We never provide for Sunday," said the waitress, responding to a
sympathetic question on the difficulty it must be to get food here."It's very seldom any tourists come on a Sunday."At which we felt altogether humbled; but in a few minutes more our
contrition passed into sovereign content.We went out of doors, upon the narrow green plateau in front of the
house, and then we recognised where we were--standing at the extreme
end of a peninsula, with a long line of rocks running out still further
into the sea.That "great and wide sea, wherein are moving things
innumerable," the mysterious sea "kept in the hollow of His hand," who
is Infinity, and looking at which, in the intense solitude and silence,
one seems dimly to guess at what Infinity may be.Any one who wishes to
go to church for once in the Great Temple which His hands have builded,
should spend a Sunday at the Land's End.At first, our thought had been, What in the world shall we do here for
two mortal hours!Now, we wished we had had two whole days.A sunset, a
sunrise, a star-lit night, what would they not have been in this grand
lonely place--almost as lonely as a ship at sea?It would be next best
to finding ourselves in the middle of the Atlantic.But this bliss could not be; so we proceeded to make the best of what
we had.The bright day was darkening, and a soft greyness began to
creep over land and sea.No, not soft, that is the very last adjective
applicable to the Land's End.Even on that calm day there was a fresh
wind--there must be always wind--and the air felt sharper and more salt
than any sea-air I ever knew.Stimulating too, so that one's nerves
were strung to the highest pitch of excitement.We felt able to do
anything, without fear and without fatigue.So that when a guide came
forward--a regular man-of-war's-man he looked--we at once resolved to
adventure along the line of rocks, seaward, "out as far as anybody was
accustomed to go.""Ay, ay; I'll take you, ladies.That is--the young ladies might go--but
you--" eying me over with his keen sailor's glance, full of honesty and
good humour, "you're pretty well on in years, ma'am."Laughing, I told him how far on, but that I was able to do a good deal
yet."Oh, I've taken ladies much older than you.One the other day was
nearly seventy.So we'll do our best, ma'am.He offered a rugged, brown hand, as firm and steady as a mast, to hold
by, and nothing could exceed the care and kindliness with which he
guided every step of every one of us, along that perilous path, that
is, perilous except for cautious feet and steady heads.If you make one false step, you are done
for," said our guide, composedly as he pointed to the boiling whirl of
waters below.[Illustration: THE LAND'S END AND THE LOGAN ROCK.]Still, though a narrow and giddy path, there was a path, and the
exploit, though a little risky, was not fool-hardy.We should have
been bitterly sorry not to have done it--not to have stood for one
grand ten minutes, where in all our lives we may never stand again, at
the farthest point where footing is possible, gazing out upon that
magnificent circle of sea which sweeps over the submerged "land of
Lyonesse," far, far away, into the wide Atlantic.There were just two people standing with us, clergymen evidently, and
one, the guide told us, was "the parson at St.We spoke to
him, as people do speak, instinctively, when mutually watching such a
scene, and by and by we mentioned the name of the long-dead curate of
St.The "parson" caught instantly at the name.Oh, yes, my father knew him quite well.He used constantly
to walk across from Sennen to our house, and take us children long
rambles across the cliffs, with a volume of Southey or Wordsworth under
his arm.He was a fine young fellow in those days, I have heard, and an
excellent clergyman.And he afterwards married a very nice girl from
the north somewhere."The "nice girl" was now a sweet silver-haired little
lady of nearly eighty; the "fine young fellow" had long since departed;
and the boy was this grave middle-aged gentleman, who remembered both
as a tradition of his youth.What a sermon it all preached, beside this
eternal rock, this ever-moving, never-changing sea!But time was passing--how fast it does pass, minutes, ay, and years!We
bade adieu to our known unknown friend, and turned our feet backwards,
cautiously as ever, stopping at intervals to listen to the gossip of
our guide."Yes, ladies, that's the spot--you may see the hoof-mark--where General
Armstrong's horse fell over; he just slipped off in time, but the poor
beast was drowned.And here, over that rock, happened the most curious
thing.I wouldn't have believed it myself, only I knew a man that saw
it with his own eyes.Once a bullock fell off into the pool below
there--just look, ladies."(We did look, into a perfect Maelstrom of
boiling waves.)"Everybody thought he was drowned, till he was seen
swimming about unhurt.They fished him up, and exhibited him as a
curiosity."And again, pointing to a rock far out in the sea.Thirty years ago a ship went to pieces there, and
the captain and his wife managed to climb on to that rock.They held
on there for two days and a night, before a boat could get at them.At last they were taken off one at a time, with rockets and a rope;
the wife first.But the rope slipped and she fell into the water.She
was pulled out in a minute or so, and rowed ashore, but they durst
not tell her husband she was drowned.I was standing on the beach at
Whitesand Bay when the boat came in.I was only a lad, but I remember
it well, and her too lifted out all dripping and quite dead."They went back for him, and got him off safe, telling him nothing.But
when he found she was dead he went crazy-like--kept for ever saying,
'She saved my life, she saved my life,' till he was taken away by his
friends.Look out, ma'am, mind your footing; just here a lady slipped
and broke her leg a week ago.I had to carry her all the way to the
hotel.We all smiled at the comical candour of the honest sailor, who
proceeded to give us bits of his autobiography.He was Cornish born,
but had seen a deal of the world as an A.B.on board her Majesty's ship
_Agamemnon_."Of course you have heard of the _Agamemnon_, ma'am.I was in her off
Balaklava.His eyes brightened as we discussed names and places once
so familiar, belonging to that time, which now seems so far back as to
be almost historical."Then you know what a winter we had, and what a summer afterwards.I
came home invalided, and didn't attempt the service afterwards; but I
never thought I should come home at all.Yes, it's a fine place the
Land's End, though the air is so strong that it kills some folks right
off.Once an invalid gentleman came, and he was dead in a fortnight.But I'm not dead yet, and I stop here mostly all the year round."He sniffed the salt air and smiled all over his weather-beaten
face--keen, bronzed, blue-eyed, like one of the old Vikings.He was a
fine specimen of a true British tar.When, having seen all we could, we
gave him his small honorarium, he accepted it gratefully, and insisted
on our taking in return a memento of the place in the shape of a stone
weighing about two pounds, glittering with ore, and doubtless valuable,
but ponderous.Oh, the trouble it gave me to carry it home, and pack
and unpack it among my small luggage!But I did bring it home, and
I keep it still in remembrance of the Land's End, and of the honest
sailor of H.M.S.We could dream of an unknown Land's End no more.It
became now a real place, of which the reality, though different from
the imagination, was at least no disappointment.How few people in
attaining a life-long desire can say as much!Our only regret, an endurable one now, was that we had not carried out
our original plan of staying some days there--tourist-haunted, troubled
days they might have been, but the evenings and mornings would have
been glorious.With somewhat heavy hearts we summoned Charles and the
carriage, for already a misty drift of rain began sweeping over the sea."Still, we must see Whitesand Bay," said one of us, recalling a story
a friend had once told how, staying at Land's End, she crossed the bay
alone in a blinding storm, took refuge at the coastguard station, where
she was hospitably received, and piloted back with most chivalric care
by a coastguard, who did not tell her till their journey's end that he
had left at home a wife, and a baby just an hour old.We only caught a glimmer of the
bay through drizzling rain, which by the time we reached Sennen village
had become a regular downpour.Evidently, we could do no more that day,
which was fast melting into night."We'll go home," was the sad resolve, glad nevertheless that we had a
comfortable "home" to go to.So closing the carriage and protecting ourselves as well as we could
from the driving rain, we went forward, passing the Quakers' burial
ground, where is said to be one of the finest views in Cornwall; the
Nine Maidens, a circle of Druidical stones, and many other interesting
things, without once looking at or thinking of them.Half a mile from Marazion the rain ceased, and a light like that of the
rising moon began to break through the clouds.What a night it might
be, or might have been, could we have stayed at the Land's End!It is in great things as in small, the
worry, the torment, the paralysing burden of life.We
have done our best to be happy, and we have been happy.DAY THE TWELFTH


Monday morning.Black Monday we were half inclined to call it, knowing
that by the week's end our travels must be over and done, and that if
we wished still to see all we had planned, we must inevitably next
morning return to civilisation and railways, a determination which
involved taking this night "a long, a last farewell" of our comfortable
carriage and our faithful Charles."But it needn't be until night," said he, evidently loth to part from
his ladies."If I get back to Falmouth by daylight to-morrow morning,
master will be quite satisfied.I can take you wherever you like
to-day.""Oh, he shall get a good feed and a rest till the middle of the night,
then he'll do well enough.We shall have the old moon after one o'clock
to get home by.Between Penzance and Falmouth it's a good road, though
rather lonely."I should think it was, in the "wee hours" by the dim light of a waning
moon.But Charles seemed to care nothing about it, so we said no more,
but decided to take the drive--our last drive.Our minds were perplexed between Botallack Mine, the Gurnard's Head,
Lamorna Cove, and several other places, which we were told we must on
no account miss seeing, the first especially.Some of us, blessed with
scientific relatives, almost dreaded returning home without having seen
a single Cornish mine; others, lovers of scenery, longed for more of
that magnificent coast.But finally, a meek little voice carried the
day.[Illustration: SENNEN COVE."I was so disappointed--more than I liked to say--when it rained,
and I couldn't get my shells for our bazaar.If it wouldn't trouble anybody very much, mightn't we go again to
Whitesand Bay?"It was a heavenly day; to spend it
in delicious idleness on that wide sweep of sunshiny sand would be a
rest for the next day's fatigue.there
would be no temptation to put on miners' clothes, and go dangling in
a basket down to the heart of the earth, as the Princess of Wales was
reported to have done.The pursuit of knowledge may be delightful, but
some of us owned to a secret preference for _terra firma_ and the upper
air.We resolved to face opprobrium, and declare boldly we had "no
time" (needless to add no inclination) to go and see Botallack Mine.The Gurnard's Head cost us a pang to miss; but then we should catch a
second view of the Land's End.Yes, we would go to Whitesand Bay.It was a far shorter journey in sunshine than in rain, even though we
made various divergencies for blackberries and other pleasures.Never
had the sky looked bluer or the sea brighter, and much we wished that
we could have wandered on in dreamy peace, day after day, or even gone
through England, gipsy-fashion, in a house upon wheels, which always
seemed to me the very ideal of travelling.Pretty little Sennen, with its ancient
church and its new school house, where the civil schoolmaster gave me
some ink to write a post-card for those to whom even the post-mark
"Sennen" would have a touching interest, and where the boys and girls,
released for dinner, were running about.Board school pupils, no doubt,
weighted with an amount of learning which would have been appalling
to their grandfathers and grandmothers, the simple parishioners of
the "fine young fellow" half a century ago.As we passed through the
village with its pretty cottages and "Lodgings to Let," we could not
help thinking what a delightful holiday resort this would be for
a large small family, who could be turned out as we were when the
carriage could no farther go, on the wide sweep of green common,
gradually melting into silvery sand, so fine and soft that it was
almost a pleasure to tumble down the <DW72>s, and get up again, shaking
yourself like a dog, without any sense of dirt or discomfort.What a
paradise for children, who might burrow like rabbits and wriggle about
like sand-eels, and never come to any harm!Without thought of any danger, we began selecting our bathing-place,
shallow enough, with long strips of wet shimmering sand to be crossed
before reaching even the tiniest waves; when one of us, the cautious
one, appealed to an old woman, the only human being in sight."Folks ne'er bathe here.Whether she understood us or not, or whether we
quite understood her, I am not sure, and should be sorry to libel such
a splendid bathing ground--apparently.But maternal wisdom interposed,
and the girls yielded.When, half an hour afterwards, we saw a solitary
figure moving on a distant ledge of rock, and a black dot, doubtless
a human head, swimming or bobbing about in the sea beneath--maternal
wisdom was reproached as arrant cowardice.But the sand was delicious,
the sea-wind so fresh, and the sea so bright, that disappointment could
not last.We made an encampment of our various impedimenta, stretched
ourselves out, and began the search for shells, in which every
arm's-length involved a mine of wealth and beauty.Never except at one place, on the estuary of the Mersey, have I
seen a beach made up of shells so lovely in colour and shape; very
minute; some being no bigger than a grain of rice or a pin's head.The
collecting of them was a fascination.We forgot all the historical
interests that ought to have moved us, saw neither Athelstan, King
Stephen, King John, nor Perkin Warbeck, each of whom is said to have
landed here--what were they to a tiny shell, like that moralised over
by Tennyson in "Maud"--"small, but a work divine"?I think infinite
greatness sometimes touches one less than infinite littleness--the
exceeding tenderness of Nature, or the Spirit which is behind Nature,
who can fashion with equal perfectness a starry hemisphere and a
glow-worm; an ocean and a little pink shell.The only imperfection in
creation seems--oh, strange mystery!--to be man.But away with moralising, or dreaming, though this was just a day for
dreaming, clear, bright, warm, with not a sound except the murmur
of the low waves, running in an enormous length--curling over and
breaking on the soft sands.Everything was so heavenly calm, it seemed
impossible to believe in that terrible scene when the captain and his
wife were seen clinging to the Brisons rock, just ahead.Doubtless our friend of the _Agamemnon_ was telling this and all
his other stories to an admiring circle of tourists, for we saw the
Land's End covered with a moving swarm like black flies.How thankful
we felt that we had "done" it on a Sunday!Still, we were pleased
to have another gaze at it, with its line of picturesque rocks, the
Armed Knight and the Irish Lady--though, I confess, I never could make
out which was the knight and which was the lady.Can it be that some
fragment of the legend of Tristram and Iseult originated these names?After several sweet lazy hours, we went through a "fish-cellar," a
little group of cottages, and climbed a headland, to take our veritable
farewell of the Land's End, and then decided to go home.We had rolled
or thrown our provision basket, rugs, &c., down the sandy <DW72>, but it
was another thing to carry them up again.I went in quest of a small
boy, and there presented himself a big man, coastguard, as the only
unemployed hand in the place, who apologised with such a magnificent
air for not having "cleaned" himself, that I almost blushed to ask
him to do such a menial service as to carry a bundle of wraps.But
he accepted it, conversing amiably as we went, and giving me a most
graphic picture of life at Sennen during the winter.When he left me,
making a short cut to our encampment--a black dot on the sands, with
two moving black dots near it--a fisher wife joined me, and of her own
accord began a conversation.She and I fraternised at once, chiefly on the subject of children, a
group of whom were descending the road from Sennen School.She told me
how many of them were hers, and what prizes they had gained, and what
hard work it was.She could neither read nor write, she said, but she
liked her children to be good scholars, and they learnt a deal up at
Sennen.Apparently they did, and something else besides learning, for when I
had parted from my loquacious friend, I came up to the group just in
time to prevent a stand-up fight between two small mites, the _casus
belli_ of which I could no more arrive at, than a great many wiser
people can discover the origin of national wars.So I thought the
strong hand of "intervention"--civilised intervention--was best, and
put an end to it, administering first a good scolding, and then a coin.The division of this coin among the little party compelled an extempore
sum in arithmetic, which I required them to do (for the excellent
reason that I couldn't do it myself!)Therefore I
conclude that the heads of the Sennen school-children are as solid as
their fists, and equally good for use.[Illustration: ON THE ROAD TO ST.which as the fisher wife told me, only goes to
Penzance about once a year, and is, as yet, innocent of tourists, for
the swarm at the Land's End seldom goes near Whitesand Bay.Existence
here must be very much that of an oyster,--but perhaps oysters are
happy.By the time we reached Penzance the lovely day was dying into an
equally lovely evening.It was high water, the bay was all alive with boats, and there was
quite a little crowd of people gathered at the mild little station of
Marazion.A princess was expected, that young half-English, half-foreign
princess, in whose romantic story the British public has taken such an
interest, sympathising with the motherly kindness of our good Queen,
with the wedding at Windsor, and the sad little infant funeral there,
a year after.The Princess Frederica of Hanover, and the Baron Von
Pawel-Rammingen, her father's secretary, who, like a stout mediaeval
knight, had loved, wooed, and married her, were coming to St.Michael's
Mount on a visit to the St.Marazion had evidently roused itself, and risen to the occasion.Half
the town must have turned out to the beach, and the other half secured
every available boat, in which it followed, at respectful distance,
the two boats, one full of luggage, the other of human beings, which
were supposed to be the royal party.People speculated with earnest
curiosity, which was the princess, and which her husband, and what the
St.Aubyns would do with them; whether they would be taken to see the
Land's End, and whether they would go there as ordinary tourists, or in
a grand visit of state.How hard it is that royal folk can never see
anything except in state, or in a certain adventitious garb, beautiful,
no doubt, but satisfactorily hiding the real thing.How they must long
sometimes for a walk, after the fashion of Haroun Alraschid, up and
down Regent Street and Oxford Street!or an incognito foreign tour, or
even a solitary country walk, without a "lady-in-waiting."We had no opera-glass to add to the many levelled at those two boats,
so we went in--hoping host and guests would spend a pleasant evening in
the lovely old rooms we knew.We spent ours in rest, and in arranging
for to-morrow's flight.Also in consulting with our kindly landlady
as to a possible house at Marazion for some friends whom the winter
might drive southwards, like the swallows, to a climate which, in this
one little bay shut out from east and north, is--they told us--during
all the cruel months which to many of us means only enduring life, not
living--as mild and equable almost as the Mediterranean shores.And
finally, we settled all with our faithful Charles, who looked quite
mournful at parting with his ladies."Yes, it is rather a long drive, and pretty lonely," said he."But I'll
wait till the moons up, and that'll help us.We'll get into Falmouth
by daylight.I've got to do the same thing often enough through the
summer, so I don't mind it."Thus said the good fellow, putting a cheery face on it, then with a
hasty "Good-bye, ladies," he rushed away.But we had taken his address,
not meaning to lose sight of him.(Nor have we done so up to this date
of writing; and the fidelity has been equal on both sides.)Then, in the midst of a peal of bells which was kept up unweariedly
till 10 P.M.--evidently Marazion is not blessed with the sight
of a princess every day--we closed our eyes upon all outward things,
and went away to the Land of Nod.DAY THE THIRTEENTH


Into King Arthurs land--Tintagel his birth-place, and Camelford,
where he fought his last battle--the legendary region of which one
may believe as much or as little as one pleases--we were going
to-day.With the good common sense which we flattered ourselves had
accompanied every step of our unsentimental journey, we had arranged
all before-hand, ordered a carriage to meet the mail train, and hoped
to find at Tintagel--not King Uther Pendragon, King Arthur or King
Mark, but a highly respectable landlord, who promised us a welcome at
an inn--which we only trusted would be as warm and as kindly as that we
left behind us at Marazion.The line of railway which goes to the far west of England is one of the
prettiest in the kingdom on a fine day, which we were again blessed
with.It had been a wet summer, we heard, throughout Cornwall, but
in all our journey, save that one wild storm at the Lizard, sunshine
scarcely ever failed us.Ives
Bay or sweeping through the mining district of Redruth, and the wooded
country near Truro, Grampound, and St.Austell, till we again saw the
glittering sea on the other side of Cornwall--all was brightness.Then
darting inland once more, our iron horse carried us past Lostwithiel,
the little town which once boasted Joseph Addison, M.P., as its
representative; gave us a fleeting vision of Ristormel, one of the
ancient castles of Cornwall, and on through a leafy land, beginning to
change from rich green to the still richer yellows and reds of autumn,
till we stopped at Bodmin Road.No difficulty in finding our carriage, for it was the only one there;
a huge vehicle, of ancient build, the horses to match, capable of
accommodating a whole family and its luggage.We missed our compact
little machine, and our brisk, kindly Charles, but soon settled
ourselves in dignified, roomy state, for the twenty miles, or rather
more, which lay between us and the coast.Our way ran along lonely
quiet country roads and woods almost as green as when Queen Guinevere
rode through them "a maying," before the dark days of her sin and King
Arthur's death.Here it occurs to me, as it did this day to a practical youthful mind,
"What in the world do people know about King Arthur?"Well, most people have read Tennyson, and a few are acquainted with
the "Morte d'Arthur" of Sir Thomas Malory.But, perhaps I had better
briefly give the story, or as much of it as is necessary for the
edification of outsiders.Uther Pendragon, King of Britain, falling in love with Ygrayne, wife of
the duke of Cornwall, besieged them in their twin castles of Tintagel
and Terrabil, slew the husband, and the same day married the wife.Unto
whom a boy was born, and by advice of the enchanter Merlin, carried
away, from the sea-shore beneath Tintagel, and confided to a good
knight, Sir Ector, to be brought up as his own son, and christened
Arthur.On the death of the king, Merlin produced the youth, who was
recognized by his mother Ygrayne, and proclaimed king in the stead
of Uther Pendragon.He instituted the Order of Knights of the Round
Table, who were to go everywhere, punishing vice and rescuing oppressed
virtue, for the love of God and of some noble lady.He married
Guinevere, daughter of King Leodegrance, who forsook him for the love
of Sir Launcelot, his bravest knight and dearest friend.One by one,
his best knights fell away into sin, and his nephew Mordred raised a
rebellion, fought with him, and conquered him at Camelford.Seeing his
end was near, Arthur bade his last faithful knight, Sir Bedevere, carry
him to the shore of a mere (supposed to be Dozmare Pool) and throw in
there his sword Excalibur; when appeared a boat with three queens,
who lifted him in, mourning over him.With them he sailed away across
the mere, to be healed of his grievous wound.Some say that he was
afterwards buried in a chapel near, others declare that he lives still
in fairy land, and will reappear in latter days, to reinstate the Order
of Knights of the Round Table, and rule his beloved England, which will
then be perfect as he once tried to make it, but in vain.Camelford of to-day is certainly not the Camelot of King Arthur--but
a very respectable, commonplace little town, much like other country
towns; the same genteel linendrapers' and un-genteel ironmongers'
shops; the same old-established commercial inn, and a few ugly, but
solid-looking private houses, with their faces to the street and
their backs nestled in gardens and fields.Some of the inhabitants of
these said houses were to be seen taking a quiet afternoon stroll.Doubtless they are eminently respectable and worthy folk, leading a
mild provincial life like the people in Miss Martineau's _Deerbrook_,
or Miss Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_--of which latter quality they
have probably a good share.We let our horses rest, but we ourselves felt not the slightest wish to
rest at Camelford, so walked leisurely on till we came to the little
river Camel, and to Slaughter Bridge, said to be the point where King
Arthur's army was routed and where he received his death-wound.A
slab of stone, some little distance up the stream, is still called
"King Arthur's Tomb."But as his coffin is preserved, as well as his
Round Table, at Winchester; where, according to mediaeval tradition,
the bodies of both Arthur and Guinevere were found, and the head
of Guinevere had yellow hair; also that near the little village of
Davidstow, is a long barrow, having in the centre a mound, which is
called "King Arthur's grave"--inquiring minds have plenty of "facts" to
choose from.Possibly at last they had better resort to fiction, and
believe in Arthur's disappearance, as Tennyson makes him say,

  "To the island-valley of Avillion...
  Where I may heal me of my grievous wound."Dozmare Pool we found so far out of our route that we had to make a
virtue of necessity, and imagine it all; the melancholy moorland lake,
with the bleak hill above it, and stray glimpses of the sea beyond.A ghostly spot, and full of many ghostly stories besides the legend
of Arthur.Here Tregeagle, the great demon of Cornwall, once had his
dwelling, until, selling his soul to the devil, his home was sunk to
the bottom of the mere, and himself is heard of stormy nights, wailing
round it with other ghost-demons, in which the Cornish mind still
lingeringly believes.Visionary packs of hounds; a shadowy coach and
horses, which drives round and round the pool, and then drives into it;
flitting lights, kindled by no human hand, in places where no human
foot could go--all these tales are still told by the country folk, and
we might have heard them all.Might also have seen, in fancy, the flash
of the "brand Excalibur"; heard the wailing song of the three queens;
and pictured the dying Arthur lying on the lap of his sister Morgane la
Faye.But, I forgot, this is an un-sentimental journey.The Delabole quarries are as un-sentimental a place as one could
desire.It was very curious to come suddenly upon this world of slate,
piled up in enormous masses on either side the road, and beyond them
hills of debris, centuries old--for the mines have been worked ever
since the time of Queen Elizabeth.Houses, walls, gates, fences,
everything that can possibly be made of slate, is made.No green or
other colour tempers the all-pervading shade of bluish-grey, for
vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the quarries is abolished,
the result of which would be rather dreary, save for the cheerful
atmosphere of wholesome labour, the noise of waggons, horses,
steam-engines--such a contrast to the silence of the deserted tin-mines.But, these Delabole quarries passed, silence and solitude come back
again.Even the yearly-increasing influx of tourists fails to make
the little village of Trevena anything but a village, where the
said tourists lounge about in the one street, if it can be called a
street, between the two inns and the often-painted, picturesque old
post-office.Everything looked so simple, so home-like, that we were
amused to find we had to get ready for a _table d'hote_ dinner, in
the only available eating room where the one indefatigable waitress,
a comely Cornish girl, who seemed Argus and Briareus rolled into one,
served us--a party small enough to make conversation general, and
pleasant and intelligent enough to make it very agreeable, which does
not always happen at an English hotel.Then we sallied out to find the lane which leads to Tintagel Castle,
or Castles--for one sits in the sea, the other on the opposite heights
in the mainland, with power of communicating by the narrow causeway
which now at least exists between the rock and the shore.This seems to
confirm the legend, how the luckless husband of Ygrayne shut up himself
and his wife in two castles, he being slain in the one, and she married
to the victorious King Uther Pendragon, in the other.Both looked so steep and dangerous in the fast-coming twilight that we
thought it best to attempt neither, so contented ourselves with a walk
on the cliffs and the smooth green field which led thither.Leaning
against a gate, we stood and watched one of the grandest out of the
many grand sunsets which had blessed us in Cornwall.The black rock of
Tintagel filled the foreground; beyond, the eye saw nothing but sea,
the sea which covers vanished Lyonesse, until it met the sky, a clear
amber with long bars like waves, so that you could hardly tell where
sea ended and sky began.Then into it there swam slowly a long low
cloud, shaped like a boat, with a raised prow, and two or three figures
sitting at the stern."King Arthur and the three queens," we declared, and really a very
moderate imagination could have fancied it this."But what is that long
black thing at the bow?""Oh," observed drily the most practical of the three, "it's King
Arthur's luggage."We fell into fits of laughter, and
went home to tea and bed.DAYS FOURTEENTH, FIFTEENTH, AND SIXTEENTH--


And all Arthurian days, so I will condense them into one chapter, and
not spin out the hours that were flying so fast.Yet we hardly wished
to stop them; for pleasant as travelling is, the best delight of all
is--the coming home.Walking, to one more of those exquisite autumn days, warm as summer,
yet with a tender brightness that hot summer never has, like the love
between two old people, out of whom all passion has died--we remembered
that we were at Tintagel, the home of Ygrayne and Arthur, of King Mark
and Tristram and Iseult.I had to tell that story to my girls in the
briefest form, how King Mark sent his nephew, Sir Tristram, to fetch
home Iseult of Ireland for his queen, and on the voyage Bragswaine,
her handmaiden, gave each a love-potion, which caused the usual fatal
result; how at last Tristram fled from Tintagel into Brittany, where
he married another Iseult "of the white hands," and lived peacefully,
till, stricken by death, his fancy went back to his old love, whom he
implored to come to him.A tale--of which
the only redeeming point is the innocence, simplicity, and dignity of
the second Iseult, the unloved Breton wife, to whom none of our modern
poets who have sung or travestied the wild, passionate, miserable, ugly
story, have ever done full justice.These sinful lovers, the much-wronged but brutal King Mark, the
scarcely less brutal Uther Pendragon, and hapless Ygrayne--what a
curious condition of morals and manners the Arthurian legends unfold!A time when might was right; when every one seized what he wanted just
because he wanted it, and kept it, if he could, till a stronger hand
wrenched it from him.That in such a state of society there should
ever have arisen the dimmest dream of a man like Arthur--not perhaps
Tennyson's Arthur, the "blameless king," but even Sir Thomas Malory's,
founded on mere tradition--is a remarkable thing.Clear through all
the mists of ages shines that ideal of knighthood, enjoining courage,
honour, faith, chastity, the worship of God and the service of men.Also, in the very highest degree, inculcating that chivalrous love of
woman--not women--which barbaric nations never knew.As we looked at
that hoar ruin sitting solitary in the sunny sea, and thought of the
days when it was a complete fortress, inclosing a mass of human beings,
all with human joys, sorrows, passions, crimes--things that must have
existed in essence, however legend has exaggerated or altered them--we
could not but feel that the mere possibility of a King Arthur shining
down the dim vista of long-past centuries, is something to prove that
goodness, like light, has an existence as indestructible as Him from
whom it comes.We looked at Tintagel with its risky rock-path."It will be a hot
climb, and our bathing days are numbered.Let us go in the opposite
direction to Bossinney Cove."Practicality when weighed against Poetry is poor--Poetry always kicks
the beam.While waiting for
the tide to cover the little strip of sand, we re-mounted the winding
path, and settled ourselves like seabirds on the furthermost point of
rock, whence, just by extending a hand, we could have dropped anything,
ourselves even, into a sheer abyss of boiling waves, dizzy to look down
into, and yet delicious.So was the bath, though a little gloomy, for the sun could barely reach
the shut-in cove; and we were interfered with considerably by--not
tourists--but a line of donkeys!They were seen solemnly descending the
narrow cliff-path one by one--eleven in all--each with an empty sack
over his shoulder.Lastly came a very old man, who, without taking the
least notice of us, disposed himself to fill these sacks with sand.One after the other the eleven meek animals came forward and submitted
each to his load, which proceeding occupied a good hour and a half.I hardly know which was the most patient, the old man or his donkeys.[Illustration: CRESWICK'S MILL IN THE ROCKY VALLEY.]We began some of us to talk to his beasts, and others to himself."Yes,
it was hard work," he said, "but he managed to come down to the cove
three times a day.They all had their
names; Lucy, Cherry, Sammy, Tom, Jack, Ned;" each animal pricked up its
long ears and turned round its quiet eyes when called.Some were young
and some old, but all were very sure-footed, which was necessary here."The weight some of 'em would carry was wonderful."The old man seemed proud of the creatures, and kind to them too in a
sort of way.He had been a fisherman, he said, but now was too old for
that; so got his living by collecting sand."It makes capital garden-paths, this sand.I'd be glad to bring you
some, ladies," said he, evidently with an eye to business.When we
explained that this was impracticable, unless he would come all the way
to London, he merely said, "Oh," and accepted the disappointment.Then
bidding us a civil "Good day," he disappeared with his laden train.Nothing of the past knightly days, nothing of the
busy existing modern present affected him, or ever would do so.He
might have been own brother, or cousin, to Wordsworth's "Leech-gatherer
on the lonely moor."Whenever we think of Bossinney Cove, we shall
certainly think of that mild old man and his eleven donkeys.The day was hot, and it had been a steep climb; we decided to drive in
the afternoon, "for a rest," to Boscastle.Artists and tourists haunt this picturesque nook.A village built at
the end of a deep narrow creek, which runs far inland, and is a safe
shelter for vessels of considerable size.On either side is a high
footpath, leading to two headlands, from both of which the views of
sea and coast are very fine.And there are relics of antiquity and
legends thereto belonging--a green mound, all that remains of Bottrieux
Castle; and Ferrabury Church, with its silent tower.A peal of bells
had been brought, and the ship which carried them had nearly reached
the cove, when the pilot, bidding the captain "thank God for his safe
voyage," was answered that he "thanked only himself and a fair wind."Immediately a storm arose; and the ship went down with every soul on
board--except the pilot.So the church tower is mute--but on winter
nights the lost bells are still heard, sounding mournfully from the
depths of the sea.As we sat, watching with a vague fascination the spouting, minute by
minute, of a "blow-hole," almost as fine as the Kynance post-office--we
moralised on the story of the bells, and on the strange notions people
have, even in these days, of Divine punishments; imputing to the
Almighty Father all their own narrow jealousies and petty revenges,
dragging down God into the likeness of men, such an one as themselves,
instead of striving to lift man into the image of God.Meantime the young folks rambled and scrambled--watched with anxious
and even envious eyes--for it takes one years to get entirely
reconciled to the quiescence of the down-hill journey.And then we
drove slowly back--just in time for another grand sunset, with Tintagel
black in the foreground, until it and all else melted into darkness,
and there was nothing left but to

  "Watch the twilight stars come out
    Above the lonely sea."Next morning we must climb Tintagel, for it would be our last day.How softly the waves crept in upon the
beach--just as they might have done when they laid at Merlin's feet
"the little naked child," disowned of man but dear to Heaven, who was
to grow up into the "stainless king."He and his knights--the "shadowy people of the realm of dream,"--were
all about us, as, guided by a rheumatic old woman, who climbed feebly
up the stair, where generations of ghostly feet must have ascended and
descended, we reached a bastion and gateway, quite pre-historic.Other
ruins apparently belong to the eleventh or twelfth centuries.It may have been the very landing-place of King
Uther or King Mark, or other Cornish heroes, who held this wonderful
natural-artificial fortress in the dim days of old romance."Here are King Arthur's cups and saucers," said the old woman, pausing
in the midst of a long lament over her own ailments, to point out some
holes in the slate rock."And up there you'll find the chapel.It's an
easy climb--if you mind the path--just where it passes the spring."That spring, trickling down from the very top of the rock, and making
a verdant space all round it--what a treasure it must have been to the
unknown inhabitants who, centuries ago, entrenched themselves here--for
offence or defence--against the main-land.Peacefully it flowed on
still, with the little ferns growing, and the sheep nibbling beside
it.We idle tourists alone occupied that solitary height where those
long-past warlike races--one succeeding the other--lived and loved,
fought and died.The chapel--where the high altar and a little burial-ground beside it
can still be traced--is clearly much later than Arthur's time.However,
there are so few data to go upon, and the action of sea-storms destroys
so much every year, that even to the learned archaeologist, Tintagel is
a great mystery, out of which the imaginative mind may evolve almost
anything it likes.We sat a long time on the top of the rock--realising only the one
obvious fact that our eyes were gazing on precisely the same scene,
seawards and coastwards, that all these long-dead eyes were accustomed
to behold.Beaten by winds and waves till the grey of its slate
formation is nearly black; worn into holes by the constant action of
the tide which widens yearly the space between it and the main-land,
and gnaws the rock below into dangerous hollows that in time become
sea-caves, Tintagel still remains--and one marvels that so much of it
does still remain--a landmark of the cloudy time between legend and
actual history.Whether the ruin on the opposite height was once a portion of
Tintagel Castle, before the sea divided it, making a promontory into
an island--or whether it was the Castle Terrabil, in which Gorlois,
Ygrayne's husband, was slain--no one now can say.That both the twin
fortresses were habitable till Elizabeth's time, there is evidence to
prove.But since then they have been left to decay, to the silent sheep
and the screeching ravens, including doubtless that ghostly chough, in
whose shape the soul of King Arthur is believed still to revisit the
familiar scene.We did not see that notable bird--though we watched with interest two
tame and pretty specimens of its almost extinct species walking about
in a flower-garden in the village, and superstitiously cherished there.We were told that to this day no Cornishman likes to shoot a chough
or a raven.So they live and breed in peace among the twin ruins, and
scream contentedly to the noisy stream which dances down the rocky
hollow from Trevena, and leaps into the sea at Porth Hern--the "iron
gate," over against Tintagel.We thought we had seen everything, and come to an end, but at the hotel
we found a party who had just returned from visiting some sea-caves
beyond Tintagel, which they declared were "the finest things they had
found in Cornwall."It was a lovely calm day, and it was our last day.And, I think, the looser grows one's grasp of life, the greater is
one's longing to make the most of it, to see all we can see of this
wonderful, beautiful world.So, after a hasty meal, we found ourselves
once more down at Porth Hern, seeking a boat and man--alas!not John
Curgenven--under whose guidance we might brave the stormy deep.No sooner had we rounded the rock, than the baby
waves of the tiny bay grew into hills and valleys, among which our boat
went dancing up and down like a sea-gull!"Ay, there's some sea on, there always is here, but we'll be through it
presently," indifferently said the elder of the two boatmen; and plied
his oars, as, I think, only these Cornish boatmen can do, talking all
the while.He pointed out a slate quarry, only accessible from the sea,
unless the workmen liked to be let down by ropes, which sometimes had
to be done.We saw them moving about like black emmets among the clefts
of the rocks, and heard plainly above the sound of the sea the click
of their hammers.Strange, lonely, perilous work it must be, even in
summer.In winter--

"Oh, they're used to it; we're all used to it," said our man, who was
intelligent enough, though nothing equal to John Curgenven."Many a
time I've got sea-fowls' eggs on those rocks there," pointing to a
cliff which did not seem to hold footing for a fly.The
gentry buy them, and we're glad of the money.Dangerous?--yes, rather;
but one must earn one's bread, and it's not so bad when you take to it
young."Nevertheless, I think I shall never look at a collection of sea-birds'
eggs without a slight shudder, remembering those awful cliffs."Here you are, ladies, and the sea's down a bit, as I said.Hold on,
mate, the boat will go right into the cave."And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out
of daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking
on a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow
that it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them;
while beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of
the everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from
which no one could ever hope to come out alive."I don't like this at all," said a small voice."Hadn't we better get out again?"But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to
return; and begged for "only five minutes" in that wonderful place,
compared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as
nothing.Yet with its
terror was mingled an awful delight."Give me but five, nay, two
minutes more!""Very well, just as you choose," was the response of meek despair.The boatmen were told to row on into
daylight and sunshine--at least as much sunshine as the gigantic
overhanging cliffs permitted.And never, never, never in this world
shall I again behold that wonderful, mysterious sea-cave.But like all things incomplete, resigned, or lost, it has fixed itself
on my memory with an almost painful vividness.However, I promised not
to regret--not to say another word about it; and I will not.I did see
it, for just a glimpse; and that will serve.Two more pictures remain, the last gorgeous sunset, which I watched in
quiet solitude, sitting on a tombstone by Tintagel church--a building
dating from Saxon times, perched on the very edge of a lofty cliff,
and with a sea-view that reaches from Trevose Head on one side to Bude
Haven on the other.Also, our last long dreamy drive; in the mild
September sunshine, across the twenty-one miles of sparsely inhabited
country which lie between Tintagel and Launceston.In the midst of
it, on the top of a high flat of moorland, our driver turned round
and pointed with his whip to a long low mound, faintly visible about
half-a-mile off."There, ladies, that's King Arthur's grave."The third, at least, that we had either seen or heard of.These varied
records of the hero's last resting-place remind one of the three heads,
said to be still extant, of Oliver Cromwell, one when he was a little
boy, one as a young man, and the third as an old man.But after all my last and vividest recollection of King Arthur's
country is that wild sail--so wild that I wished I had taken it
alone--in the solitary boat, up and down the tossing waves in face of
Tintagel rock; the dark, iron-bound coast with its awful caves, the
bright sunshiny land, and ever-threatening sea.Just the region, in
short, which was likely to create a race like that which Arthurian
legend describes, full of passionate love and deadly hate, capable of
barbaric virtues, and equally barbaric crimes.An age in which the mere
idea of such a hero as that ideal knight

  "Who reverenced his conscience as his God:
  Whose glory was redressing human wrong:
  Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it:
  Who loved one only, and who clave to her--"

rises over the blackness of darkness like a morning star.If Arthur could "come again"--perhaps in the person of one of the
descendants of a prince who was not unlike him, who lived and died
among us in this very nineteenth century--

  "Wearing the white flower of a blameless life--"

if this could be--what a blessing for Arthur's beloved England![Illustration: THE OLD POST-OFFICE, TREVENA.]L'ENVOI

  R. CLAY, SONS, AND TAYLOR,
  BREAD STREET HILL, E.C."You seem to forget that if I had not shielded her with my name, she
would undoubtedly have been arrested on the train.""Oh, I don't doubt you meant well.""Thanks," murmured Cyril sarcastically."All I say is that you must not see her again till this mystery is
cleared up.I didn't forget about the number of her apartment, but I
wasn't going to help you to sneak in to her at all hours.Now, if you
want to see her, you will have to go boldly up to the hotel and have
yourself properly announced.And I don't think you will care about
that.""I don't care a fig for your promises.You shan't see her as long as she
believes you to be her husband."Luckily the room was empty, for both men had risen to their feet."I shall see her," repeated Cyril."If you do, I warn you that I shall tell her the truth and risk the
consequences.She shall not, if I can help it, be placed in a position
where she will be forced to marry a man who has, after all, lived his
life."She ought, in other words, to be given the choice between my battered
heart and your virgin affections."I mean----"

"Oh, you have made your meaning quite clear, I assure you!""But what you have been saying is sheer nonsense.You have been
calling me to account for things that have not happened, and blaming me
for what I have not done.She is not being dragged through the divorce
court, and I see no reason to suppose that she ever will be.I am not
trying to force her to marry me, and can promise that I shall never do
so.Far from taking advantage of the situation, I assure you my conduct
has been most circumspect.Don't cross a bridge till you get to it, and
don't accuse a man of being a cad just because--" Cyril paused abruptly
and looked at Guy, and as he did so, his expression slowly relaxed till
he finally smiled indulgently--"just because a certain lady is very
charming," he added.He would neither retract nor modify his
ultimatum.He knew, of course, that Cyril would not dare to write the
girl; for if the letter miscarried or was found by the police, it might
be fatal to both.But while they were still heatedly debating the question, a way suddenly
occurred to Cyril by which he could communicate with her with absolute
safety.So he waited placidly for Guy to take himself off, which he
eventually did, visibly elated at having, as he thought, effectually put
a stop to further intercourse between the two.He had hardly left the
club, however, before Cyril was talking to Priscilla over the telephone!He explained to her as best he could that he had been called out of town
for a few days, and begged her on no account to leave her apartments
till he returned.He also tried to impress on her that she had better
talk about him as little as possible and above all things not to mention
either to Campbell or Miss Trevor that she had heard from him and
expected to see him before long.It cost Cyril a tremendous effort to restrict himself to necessary
instructions and polite inquiries, especially as she kept begging him to
come back to her as soon as possible.Finally he could bear the strain
no longer, and in the middle of a sentence he resolutely hung up the
receiver.CHAPTER XIV

WHAT IS THE TRUTH?When Cyril arrived in Newhaven that evening, he was unpleasantly
surprised to find, as he got out of the train, that Judson had been
travelling in the adjoining compartment.Had the man been following him,
or was it simply chance that had brought them together, he wondered.If he could only get rid of the fellow!"You have come to see me, I suppose," he remarked ungraciously."Very well, then, get into the car."Cyril was in no mood to talk, so the first part of the way was
accomplished in silence, but at last, thinking that he might as well
hear what the man had to say, he turned to him and asked:

"Have you found out anything of any importance?""If you will excuse me, my lord, I should suggest that we wait till we
get to the castle," replied Judson, casting a meaning look at the
chauffeur's back.His contempt for Judson was so great that Cyril
was not very curious to hear his revelations."Now," said Cyril, as he flung himself into a low chair before the
library fire, "what have you to tell me?"Before answering Judson peered cautiously around; then, drawing forward
a straight-backed chair, he seated himself close to Cyril and folded his
hands in his lap."In dealing with my clients," he began, "I make it a rule instead of
simply stating the results of my work to show them how I arrive at my
conclusions.Having submitted to them all the facts I have collected,
they are able to judge for themselves as to the value of the evidence on
which my deductions are based.And so, my lord, I should like to go over
the whole case with you from the very beginning."Cyril gave a grunt which Judson evidently construed into an assent, for
he continued even more glibly:

"The first point I considered was, whether her Ladyship had premeditated
her escape.But in order to determine this, we must first decide whom
she could have got to help her to accomplish such a purpose.The most
careful inquiry has failed to reveal any one who would have been both
willing and able to do so, except the sempstress, and as both mistress
and maid disappeared almost simultaneously, one's first impulse is to
take it for granted that Prentice was her Ladyship's accomplice.This is
what every one, Scotland Yard included, believes.""Before either accepting or rejecting this theory, I decided to visit
this girl's home.I did not feel clear in my mind about her.All the
servants were impressed by her manner and personality, the butler
especially so, and he more than hinted that there must be some mystery
attached to her.One of the things that stimulated their curiosity was
that she kept up a daily correspondence with some one in Plumtree.On
reaching the village I called at once on the vicar.He is an elderly
man, much respected and beloved by his parishioners.I found him in a
state of great excitement, having just read in the paper of Prentice's
disappearance.I had no difficulty in inducing him to tell me the main
facts of her history; the rest I picked up from the village gossips.And till she came to Geralton she was an inmate of
the vicar's household.He told me that he would have adopted her, but
knowing that he had not sufficient means to provide for her future, he
wisely refrained from educating her above her station.Nevertheless, I
gathered that the privilege of his frequent companionship had refined
her speech and manners, and I am told that she now could pass muster in
any drawing-room.""Not that I know of, and I do not believe the vicar would have taught
her an accomplishment so useless to one in her position.""No matter--I--but go on with your story.""Owing partly to the mystery which surrounded her birth and gave rise to
all sorts of rumours, and partly to her own personality, the gentry of
the neighbourhood made quite a pet of her.As a child she was asked
occasionally to play with the Squire's crippled daughter and later she
used to go to the Hall three times a week to read aloud to her.So,
notwithstanding the vicar's good intentions, she grew up to be neither
'fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring.'Now all went well till about
a year ago, when the Squire's eldest son returned home and fell in love
with her.His people naturally opposed the match and, as he is entirely
dependent upon them, there seemed no possibility of his marrying her.The girl appeared broken-hearted, and when she came to the castle, every
one, the vicar included, thought the affair at an end.I am sure,
however, that such was not the case, for as no one at the vicarage wrote
to her daily, the letters she received must have come from her young
man.Furthermore, she told the servants that she had a cousin in
Newhaven, but as she has not a relative in the world, this is obviously
a falsehood.Who, then, is this mysterious person she visited?It seems
to me almost certain that it was her lover.""But I don't quite see what you are trying to
prove by all this.If Prentice did not help her Ladyship to escape, who
did?""I have not said that Prentice is not a factor in the case, only I
believe her part to have been a very subordinate one.Of one thing,
however, I am sure, and that is that she did not return to Geralton on
the night of the murder.""Because she asked for permission early in the morning to spend the
night in Newhaven and had already left the castle before the doctors'
visit terminated.Now, although I think it probable that her Ladyship
may for a long time have entertained the idea of leaving Geralton, yet I
believe that it was the doctors' visit that gave the necessary impetus
to convert her idle longing into definite action.Therefore I conclude
that Prentice could have had no knowledge of her mistress's sudden
flight.""But how can you know that the whole thing had not been carefully
premeditated?""Because her Ladyship showed such agitation and distress at hearing the
doctors' verdict.If her plans for leaving the castle had been
completed, she would have accepted the situation more calmly."We have been able to trace them only as far as London.They
could not have been reputable physicians or they would have answered our
advertisements, and so I am inclined to believe that you were right and
that it was his Lordship who spread the rumours of her Ladyship's
insanity.""I am sure of it," said Cyril.Assuming, therefore, that Lady Wilmersley is sane, we will
proceed to draw logical inferences from her actions."Judson paused a
moment before continuing: "Now I am convinced that the only connection
Prentice had with the affair was to procure some clothes for her
mistress, and these had probably been sometime in the latter's
possession.""I think it would have been pretty
difficult to have concealed anything from that maid of hers.""Difficult, I grant you, but not impossible, my lord.""But if Prentice had no knowledge of the tragedy, why did she not return
to the castle?Why have the police been unable
to find her?""I believe that she joined her lover and that they are together on the
continent, for in Plumtree I was told that the young man had recently
gone to Paris.As I am sure that she knows nothing of any importance, I
thought it useless to waste time and money trying to discover their
exact locality.That the police have not succeeded in finding her, I
ascribe to the fact that they are looking for a young woman who left
Newhaven after and not before the murder.""Yes, and I have two reasons for this supposition.First, I can discover
no place where he or she, either separately or together, could have
spent the night.Secondly, if they had left Newhaven the following
morning or in fact at any time after the murder, they would certainly
have been apprehended, as all the boats and trains were most carefully
watched.""But no one knew of her disappearance till twenty-four hours later, and
during that interval she could easily have got away unobserved.""No, my lord, there you are mistaken.From the moment that the police
were notified that a crime had been committed, every one, especially
every woman, who left Newhaven was most attentively scrutinised.""You are certain that Prentice could not have left Newhaven unnoticed,
yet her Ladyship managed to do so!The detective paused a moment and looked fixedly at Cyril."Her Ladyship had a very powerful protector, my lord," he finally said."It's no use beating about the bush, my lord, I know everything.""Well then, out with it," cried Cyril impatiently.Have you found her Ladyship or have you not?"Then why on earth didn't you tell me at once?There was a pause during which the detective regarded Cyril through
narrowed lids."She is at present at the nursing home of Dr.Stuart-Smith," he said at
last.exclaimed Cyril, sinking back into his chair and negligently
lighting another cigarette.You
mean my wife, Lady Wilmersley----"

"Pardon me for interrupting you, my lord.I repeat, the Dowager Lady Wilmersley is under the care of Dr.The man's tone was so assured that Cyril was staggered for a moment."It isn't true," he asserted angrily."Is it possible that you really do not know who the lady is that you
rescued that day from the police?"exclaimed the detective, startled out
of his habitual impassivity.But of one thing I am sure, and that is that
she is not the person you suppose.""Well, my lord, I must say that you have surprised me."I tell you that you are on the wrong track."She has not, for it has turned completely white," exclaimed Cyril,
triumphantly."Her Ladyship is cleverer than I supposed," remarked the detective with
a pitying smile."I am not such a fool as you seem to think," retorted Cyril."And I can
assure you that the lady in question is incapable of deception.""All I can say is, my lord, that I am absolutely sure of her Ladyship's
identity and that you yourself gave me the clue to her whereabouts.""I of course noticed that when you heard her Ladyship had golden hair,
you were not only extremely surprised but also very much relieved.I at
once asked myself why such an apparently trivial matter should have so
great and so peculiar an effect on you.As you had never seen her
Ladyship, I argued that you must that very day have met some one you had
reason to suppose to be Lady Wilmersley and that this person had dark
hair.By following your movements from the time you landed I found that
the only woman with whom you had come in contact was a young lady who
had joined you in Newhaven, and that she answered to the description of
Lady Wilmersley in every particular, with the sole exception that she
had dark hair!I was, however, told that you had said that she was your
wife and had produced a passport to prove it.Now I had heard from your
valet that her Ladyship was still in France, so you can hardly blame me
for doubting the correctness of your statement.But in order to make
assurance doubly sure, I sent one of my men to the continent.He
reported that her Ladyship had for some months been a patient at
Charleroi, but had recently escaped from there, and that you are still
employing detectives to find her.""I did not engage you to pry into my affairs," exclaimed Cyril savagely."Nor have I exceeded my duty as I conceive it," retorted the detective."As your Lordship refused to honour me with your confidence, I had to
find out the facts by other means; and you must surely realise that
without facts it is impossible for me to construct a theory, and till I
can do that my work is practically valueless.""But my wife has nothing to do with the case.""Quite so, my lord, but a lady who claimed to be her Ladyship is
intimately concerned with it.""If your Lordship will listen to me, I think I can prove to you that as
far as the lady's identity is concerned, I have made no mistake.But to
do this convincingly, I must reconstruct the tragedy as I conceive that
it happened.""Go ahead; I don't mind hearing your theory.""First, I must ask you to take it for granted that I am right in
believing that Prentice was ignorant of her Ladyship's flight.""I will admit that much," agreed Cyril.Now let us try and imagine exactly what was her
Ladyship's position on the night of the murder.Her first care must have
been to devise some means of eluding his Lordship's vigilance.This was
a difficult problem, for Mustapha tells me that his Lordship was not
only a very light sleeper but that he suffered from chronic insomnia.You may or may not know that his Lordship had long been addicted to the
opium habit and would sometimes for days together lie in a stupor.Large
quantities of the drug were found in his room and that explains how her
Ladyship managed to get hold of the opium with which she doctored his
Lordship's coffee.""This is, however, mere supposition on your part," objected Cyril.I had the sediment of the two cups analysed and
the chemist found that one of them contained a small quantity of opium.Her Ladyship, being practically ignorant as to the exact nature of the
drug and of the effect it would have on a man who was saturated with it,
gave his Lordship too small a dose.Nevertheless, he became immediately
stupefied.""Now, how on earth can you know that?"If his Lordship had not been rendered at once
unconscious, he would--knowing that an attempt had been made to drug
him--have sounded the alarm and deputed Mustapha to guard her Ladyship,
which was what he always did when he knew that he was not equal to the
task.""Well, that sounds plausible, at all events," acknowledged Cyril."As soon as her Ladyship knew that she was no longer watched," continued
the detective, "she at once set to work to disguise herself.As we know,
she had provided herself with clothes, but I fancy her hair, her most
noticeable feature, must have caused her some anxious moments.""She may have worn a wig," suggested Cyril, hoping that Judson would
accept this explanation of the difficulty, in which case he would be
able triumphantly to demolish the latter's theory of the girl's
identity, by stating that he could positively swear that her hair was
her own.After carefully investigating the matter I have come to
the conclusion that she did not.And my reasons are, first, that no
hairdresser in Newhaven has lately sold a dark wig to any one, and,
secondly, that no parcel arrived, addressed either to her Ladyship or to
Prentice, which could have contained such an article.On the other hand,
as his Lordship had for years dyed his hair and beard, her Ladyship had
only to go into his dressing-room to procure a very simple means of
transforming herself.""But doesn't it take ages to dye hair?""If it is done properly, yes; but the sort of stain his Lordship used
can be very quickly applied.I do not believe it took her Ladyship more
than half an hour to dye enough of her hair to escape notice, but in all
probability she had no time to do it very thoroughly and that which
escaped may have turned white.This was a possibility which had not occurred to Cyril; but still he
refused to be convinced.Let me continue my story: Before her Ladyship had
completed her preparations, his Lordship awoke from his stupor.""Because, if his Lordship had not tried to prevent her escape, she would
have had no reason for killing him.Probably they had a struggle, her
hand fell on the pistol, and the deed was done----"

"But what about the ruined picture?""Her Ladyship, knowing that there was no other portrait of her in
existence, destroyed it in order to make it difficult for the police to
follow her.""You make her Ladyship out a nice, cold-blooded,
calculating sort of person.If you think she at all resembles the young
lady at the nursing home, I can only tell you that you are vastly
mistaken.""As I have not the honour of knowing the lady in question, I cannot form
any opinion as to that.But let us continue: I wish to confess at once
that I am not at all sure how her Ladyship reached Newhaven.On the face of it, it seems as
if it must have some connection with the case.I have also a feeling
that it has, and yet for the life of me I cannot discover the connecting
link.Whatever the younger man was, the elder was undoubtedly a
Frenchman, and I have ascertained that with the exception of an old
French governess, who lived with her Ladyship before her marriage, and
of Mustapha and Valdriguez, Lady Wilmersley knew no foreigner whatever.Besides, these two men seem to have been motoring about the country
almost at random, and it may have been the merest accident which brought
them to the foot of the long lane just at the time when her Ladyship was
in all probability leaving the castle.Whether they gave her a lift as
far as Newhaven, I do not know.How her Ladyship reached the town
constitutes the only serious--I will not call it break--but hiatus--in
my theory.From half-past six the next morning, however, her movements
can be easily followed.A young lady, dressed as you know, approached
the station with obvious nervousness.Three things attracted the
attention of the officials: first, the discrepancy between the
simplicity, I might almost say the poverty, of her clothes, and the fact
that she purchased a first-class ticket; secondly, that she did not wish
her features to be seen; and thirdly, that she had no luggage except a
small hand-bag.How her Ladyship managed to elude the police, and what
has subsequently occurred to her, I do not need to tell your Lordship.""You haven't in the least convinced me that the young lady is her
Ladyship, not in the least.You yourself admit that there is a hiatus in
your story; well, that hiatus is to me a gulf which you have failed to
bridge.Because one lady disappears from Geralton and another appears
the next morning in Newhaven, you insist the two are identical.But you
have not offered me one iota of proof that such is the case."She is the only person who left Newhaven
by train or boat who even vaguely resembled her Ladyship."Her Ladyship may not have come to Newhaven at all,
but have been driven to some hiding-place in the Frenchman's car.""I think that quite impossible, for every house, every cottage, every
stable and barn even, for twenty-five miles around, has been carefully
searched.Besides, this would mean that the murder had been premeditated
and the coming of the motor had been pre-arranged; and lastly, as the
gardener's wife testifies that the car left Geralton certainly no
earlier than eleven-thirty, and as the two men reached the hotel before
twelve, this precludes the possibility that they could have done more
than drive straight back to the Inn, as the motor is by no means a fast
one.""But, my man, they may have secreted her Ladyship in the town itself and
have taken her with them to France the next morning."In the first place, they left alone, the porter saw them
off; and secondly, no one except the two Frenchmen purchased a ticket
for the continent either in the Newhaven office or on the boat."Judson's logic was horribly convincing; no
smallest detail had apparently escaped him.As the man piled argument on
argument, he had found himself slowly and grudgingly accepting his
conclusions."As you are in my employ, I take it for granted that you will not inform
the police or the press of your--suspicions," he said at last.On the other hand, I must ask you to allow me
to withdraw from the case.""Because my duty to you, as my client, prevents me from taking any
further steps in this matter.""I gather that you are less anxious to clear up the mystery than to
protect her Ladyship."You would even wish me to assist you in providing a safe retreat for
her.""Well, my lord, that is just what I cannot do.It is my duty, as I
conceive it, to hold my tongue, but I should not feel justified in
aiding her Ladyship to escape the consequences of her--her--action.In
order to be faithful to my engagement to you, I am willing to let the
public believe that I have made a failure of the case.I shall not even
allow my imagination to dwell on your future movements, but more than
that I cannot do.""You take the position that her Ladyship is an ordinary criminal, but
you must realise that that is absurd.Even granting that she is
responsible for her husband's death--of which, by the way, we have no
absolute proof--are you not able to make allowances for a poor woman
goaded to desperation by an opium fiend?""I do not constitute myself her Ladyship's judge, but I don't think your
Lordship quite realises all that you are asking of me.Even if I were
willing to waive the question of my professional honour, I should still
decline to undertake a task which, I know, is foredoomed to failure.For, if _I_ discovered Lady Wilmersley with so little difficulty,
Scotland Yard is bound to do so before long.It is impossible--absolutely impossible, I assure you,
that the secret can be kept.""I wish I could convince your Lordship of this and induce you to allow
the law to take its course.Her Ladyship ought to come forward at once
and plead justifiable homicide.If she waits till she is arrested, it
will tell heavily against her.""But she is ill, really ill," insisted Cyril.Stuart-Smith tells me
that if she is not kept perfectly quiet for the next few weeks, her
nervous system may never recover from the shock."That certainly complicates the situation; on the other hand, you
must remember that discovery is not only inevitable but imminent, and
that the police will not stop to consider her Ladyship's nervous system.No, my lord, the only thing for you to do is to break the news to her
yourself and to persuade her to give herself up.If you don't, you will
both live to regret it.""That may be so," replied Cyril after a minute's hesitation, "but in
this matter I must judge for myself.I still hope that you are wrong and
that either the young woman in question is not Lady Wilmersley or that
it was not her Ladyship who killed my cousin, and I refuse to jeopardise
her life till I am sure that there is no possibility of your having made
a mistake.So far you have only sought
for evidence which would strengthen your theory of her Ladyship's guilt,
now I want you to look at the case from a fresh point of view.I want
you to start all over again and to work on the assumption that her
Ladyship did not fire the shot.I cannot accept your conclusion as final
till we have exhausted every other possibility.These Frenchmen, for
instance, have they or have they not a connection with the case?At the
inquest she acknowledged that no one had seen her leave her Ladyship's
apartments and we have only her word for it that she spent the evening
in her room."But, if I went on the principle of suspecting every one who
cannot prove themselves innocent, I should soon be lost in a quagmire of
barren conjectures.Of course, I have considered Valdriguez, but I can
find no reason for suspecting her.""Well, I could give you a dozen reasons.""Indeed, my lord, and what are they?""In the first place, we know that she is a hard, unprincipled woman, or
she would never have consented to aid my cousin in depriving his
unfortunate wife of her liberty.A woman who would do that, is capable
of any villainy.Then, on the witness-stand didn't you feel that she was
holding something back?Oh, I forgot you were not present at the
inquest.""I was there, my lord, but I took good care that no one should recognise
me.""Well, and what impression did she make on you?"I think she spoke the truth and I
fancy that she is almost a religious fanatic.""You don't mean to say, Judson, that you allowed yourself to be taken in
by her sanctimonious airs and the theatrical way that she kept clutching
at that cross on her breast?Why, don't you
see that no woman with a spark of religion in her could have allowed her
mistress to be treated as Lady Wilmersley was?""Quite so, my lord, and it is because Valdriguez impressed me as an
honest old creature that I am still doubtful whether her Ladyship is
insane or not, and this uncertainty hampers me very much in my work.""Lady Upton assured me that her granddaughter's mind had never been
unbalanced and that his Lordship, although he frequently wrote to her,
had never so much as hinted at such a thing; and if you believe the
young lady at the nursing home to be Lady Wilmersley, I give you my word
that she shows no sign of mental derangement.""Well, that seems pretty final, and yet--and yet--I cannot believe that
Valdriguez is a vicious woman.A man in my profession acquires a curious
instinct in such matters, my lord."The detective paused a moment and
when he began again, he spoke almost as if he were reasoning with
himself."Now, if my estimate of Valdriguez is correct, and if it is
also a fact that Lady Wilmersley has never been insane, there are
certainly possibilities connected with this affair which I have by no
means exhausted--and so, my lord, I am not only willing but anxious to
continue on the case, if you will agree to allow me to ignore her
Ladyship's existence."But tell me, Judson, how can you hope to reconcile two such
absolutely contradictory facts?""Two such apparently contradictory facts," gently corrected the
detective."Well, my lord, I propose to find out more of this woman's
antecedents.I have several times tried to get her to talk, but so far
without the least success.She says that she will answer any question
put to her on the witness-stand, but that it is against her principles
to gossip about her late master and mistress.She is equally reticent as
to her past life and when I told her that her silence seemed to me very
suspicious, she demanded--suspicious of what?She went on to say that
she could not see that it was anybody's business, where she lived or
what she had done, and that she had certainly no intention of gratifying
my idle curiosity; and that was the last word I could get out of her.Although she treated me so cavalierly, I confess to a good deal of
sympathy with her attitude.""She was
housekeeper here when Valdriguez first came to Geralton and ought to be
able to tell you what sort of person she was in her youth."The only thing she told me which may
have a bearing on the case is, that in the old days his Lordship
appeared to admire Valdriguez very much.""But we cannot be too sure of this, my lord.For when I tried to find
out what grounds she had for her statement, she had so little proof to
offer that I cannot accept her impression as conclusive evidence.As far
as I can make out, the gossip about them was started by his Lordship
going to the Catholic church in Newhaven."Not a very compromising act on his Lordship's part, one would
think.But as his Lordship was not a Catholic, his doing so naturally
aroused a good deal of comment.At first the neighbourhood feared that
he had been converted by his mother, who had often lamented that she had
not been allowed to bring up her son in her own faith.It was soon
noticed, however, that whenever his Lordship attended a popish service,
his mother's pretty maid was invariably present, and so people began to
put two and two together and before long it was universally assumed that
she was the magnet which had drawn him away from his own church.Eversley if they had been seen together elsewhere, and she
reluctantly admitted that they had.On several occasions they were seen
walking in the Park but always, so Mrs.Eversley assured me, in full
view of the castle.She had felt it her duty to speak to Valdriguez on
the subject, and the latter told her that his Lordship was interested in
her religion and that she was willing to run the risk of having her
conduct misconstrued if she could save his soul from eternal damnation.Eversley to understand that she had her mistress's
sanction, and as her Ladyship treated Valdriguez more as a companion and
friend than as a maid, Mrs.Eversley thought this quite likely and did
not venture to remonstrate further.So the intimacy, if such it could be
called, continued as before.What the outcome of this state of things
would have been we do not know, for shortly afterwards both Lord and
Lady Wilmersley died and Valdriguez left Geralton.When his Lordship
went away a few weeks later, a good many people suspected that he had
joined her on the continent.Eversley, however, does not believe
this.She has the most absolute confidence in Valdriguez's virtue, and I
think her testimony is pretty reliable."Eversley is an honest, simple old soul.A clever adventuress
would have little difficulty in hoodwinking her.Mark my words, you have
found the key to the mystery.What more likely than that his
Lordship--whose morals, even as a boy, were none of the best--seduced
Valdriguez and that she returned to Geralton so as to have the
opportunity of avenging her wrongs.""I can think of nothing more unlikely than that his Lordship should have
selected his cast-off mistress as his wife's attendant," Judson drily
remarked.You didn't know him," replied Cyril."I can quite fancy
that the situation would have appealed to his cynical humour.""Your opinion of the late Lord Wilmersley is certainly not flattering,
but even if we take for granted that such an arrangement would not have
been impossible to his Lordship, I still refuse to believe that
Valdriguez would have agreed to it; even assuming that his Lordship had
wronged her and that she had nursed a murderous resentment against him
all these years, I cannot see how she could have hoped to further her
object by accepting the humiliating position of his wife's maid.It also
seems to me incredible that a woman whose passions were so violent as to
find expression in murder could have controlled them during a lifetime.But leaving aside these considerations, I have another reason to urge
against your theory: Would his Lordship have trusted a woman who, he
knew, had a grievance against him, as he certainly trusted Valdriguez?What was there to have prevented
her from giving him an overdose of some drug during one of the many
times when he was half-stupefied with opium?The risk of
detection would have been infinitesimal.No, my lord, why Valdriguez
returned to Geralton is an enigma, I grant you, but your explanation
does not satisfy me.""As long as you acknowledge that Valdriguez's presence here needs an
explanation and are willing to work to find that explanation, I don't
care whether you accept my theory or not; all I want to get at is the
truth.""The truth, my lord," said the detective, as he rose to take his leave,
"is often more praised than appreciated."CHAPTER XV

FINGER PRINTS IN THE DUST


As Cyril sat toying with his dinner, it was little by little borne in on
him that the butler had something on his mind.How he got this
impression he really did not know, for Douglas performed his duties as
precisely, as unobtrusively as ever.Yet long before the last course had
been reached, Cyril was morally certain that he had not been mistaken.He waited for the dessert to be placed on the table; then, having
motioned the footmen to leave the room, he half turned to the butler,
who was standing behind his chair.The man stepped forward, so as to face his master.asked Cyril, scrutinising the other
attentively.The abrupt question seemed neither to surprise nor to discompose the
butler; yet he hesitated before finally answering:

"I--I don't quite know, my lord.""You must know whether or not
something has happened to upset you.""Well, my lord--it's this way, my lord--Susan, the upper 'ousemaid, says
as how there has been somebody or--" here his voice sank to a whisper
and he cast an apprehensive glance over his shoulder--"or something in
the library last night!"Cyril put down the glass of wine he was carrying to his lips untasted."She thinks she saw a ghost in the library?"She didn't see anything, but this morning she found
finger-marks on the top of his Lordship's desk."One of the servants may have gone in there out of
curiosity.""But what would anybody be doing there in the night, I should like to
know?And Susan says those marks could only 'ave been made last night,
my lord.""On account of the dust, my lord.It takes time for dust to settle and a
'ousemaid, who knows 'er business, can tell, after she's been in a place
a couple of months, just about 'ow long it's been since any particular
piece of furniture has been dusted.No young
'ousemaid can pull the wool over 'er eyes, I can tell you.""Does every one know of Susan's suspicions?"Susan's a sensible woman, and though she was frightened
something terrible, she only told Mrs.Eversley told
me and we three agreed we'd hold our tongues.Every one's that upset as
it is, that they'd all 'ave 'ighstrikes if they knew that It was
walking."But even
if there were such things, an intangible spirit couldn't possibly leave
finger-marks behind it.""But, my lord, if you'll excuse me, my aunt's cousin--" began the
butler, but Cyril cut him short."I have no time now to hear about your aunt's cousin, though no doubt it
is a most interesting story.Susan had, however, no further information to impart.She was positive
that the marks must have been made some time during the night."And it's my belief they were made by a skeleton hand," she added."And
as for going into that room again, indeed I just couldn't, not for
nobody, meaning no disrespect to your Lordship; and as for the other
'ousemaids, they'll not go near the place either and haven't been since
the murder.""Very well, Susan, I shall not ask you to do so.Those rooms shall not
be opened again till this mystery is cleared up.I will go now and lock
them up myself."Striding rapidly across the hall, Cyril opened the door of the library.This part of the castle had been equipped with electric light and steam
heat, and as he stepped into the darkness, the heavy-scented air almost
made him reel.Having found the switch, he noticed at once that the room
had indefinably changed since he had been in it last.Notwithstanding
the heat, notwithstanding the flood of crimson light, which permeated
even the farthest corners, it had already assumed the chill, gloomy
aspect of an abandoned apartment.Stooping over the desk, he eagerly inspected the marks which had so
startled the housemaid.Yes, they were still quite visible, although a
delicate film of dust had already begun to soften the precision of their
outline--very strange!They certainly did look like the imprint of
skeleton fingers.His fingers left a
mark at least twice as wide as those of the mysterious visitant.For a long time he stood with bent head pondering deeply; then, throwing
back his shoulders, as if he had arrived at some decision, he proceeded
to explore the entire suite.Having satisfied himself that no one was
secreted on the premises, he turned off the light, shut the door--but he
did not turn the key.Some hours later Cyril, in his great four-posted bed, lay watching, with
wide-open eyes, the fantastic shadows thrown by the dancing firelight on
the panelled walls.To woo sleep was evidently not his intention, for
from time to time he lighted a wax vesta and consulted the watch he held
in his hand.At last the hour seemed to satisfy him, for he got out of
bed and made a hasty toilet.Having accomplished this as best he could
in the semi-obscurity, he slipped a pistol into his pocket and left his
room.Groping his way through the darkness, he descended the stairs and
cautiously traversed the hall.His stockinged
feet moved noiselessly over the heavy carpet.At the door of the library
he paused a moment and listened intently; then, pistol in hand, he threw
open the door.Closing the
door behind him, he lighted a match and carefully inspected the desk.Having assured himself that no fresh marks had appeared on its polished
surface, he blew out the match and ensconced himself as comfortably as
the limited space permitted behind the curtains of one of the windows.There he waited patiently for what seemed to him an eternity.He had
just begun to fear that his vigil would prove fruitless, when his ear
was gladdened by a slight sound.A moment later the light was switched
on.Hardly daring to breathe, Cyril peered through the curtains.Cyril's heart gave a bound of exultation.Had he not guessed
that those marks could only have been made by her small, bony fingers?Clad like a nun in a loose, black garment, which fell in straight,
austere folds to her feet; a black shawl, thrown over her head, casting
strange shadows on her pale, haggard face, she advanced slowly, almost
majestically, into the room.Cyril had to acknowledge that she looked
more like a medieval saint than a midnight marauder.Evidently the woman had no fear of detection, for she never even cast
one suspicious glance around her; nor did she appear to feel that there
was any necessity for haste, for she lingered for some time near the
writing-table, gazing at it, as if it had a fascination for her; but,
finally, she turned away with a hopeless sigh and directed her attention
to the bookcase.This she proceeded to examine in the most methodical
manner.Book after book was taken down, shaken, and the binding
carefully scrutinised.Having cleared a shelf, she drew a tape measure
from her pocket and rapped and measured the back and sides of the case
itself.What on earth could she be looking for, wondered Cyril.For his cousin's will, executed at the date of his marriage, had
been found safely deposited with his solicitor.One in which she hoped that her master had remembered her, as he had
probably promised her that he would?Well, there was no further need of concealment, he decided, so, parting
the curtains, he stepped into the room.His own voice startled him, it rang out so loud and harsh in the silence
of the night.Valdriguez knelt on the floor with her back to him, and it seemed as if
the sudden shock had paralysed her, for she made no effort to move, and
her hand, arrested in the act of replacing a book, remained
outstretched, as if it had been turned to stone.He saw her shudder convulsively, then slowly she raised her head, and as
her great, tragic eyes met his, Cyril was conscious of a revulsion of
feeling toward her.Never had he seen anything so hopeless yet so
undaunted as the look she gave him.It reminded him, curiously enough,
of a look he had once seen in the eyes of a lioness, who, with a bullet
through her heart, still fought to protect her young.Staggering a little as she rose, Valdriguez nevertheless managed to draw
herself up to her full height."I am here, my lord, to get what is mine--mine," she repeated almost
fiercely.It was absurd, he reasoned, to allow
himself to be impressed by her strange personality.he exclaimed; and the very fact that he was more than
half-inclined to believe her, made him speak more roughly than he would
otherwise have done."Think what you like," she cried, shrugging her shoulders
contemptuously."Have me arrested--have me hung--what do I care?"So you confess that it was you who murdered his Lordship?Your sanctimonious airs didn't deceive me," exclaimed
Cyril triumphantly."No, I did not murder him," she replied calmly, almost indifferently."I think you will have some difficulty convincing the police of that.You have no alibi to prove that you were not in these rooms at the time
of the murder, and now when I tell them that I found you trying to
steal----"

"I am no thief," she interrupted him with blazing eyes."I tell you, I
came here to get what is mine by right.""Do you really expect me to believe that?Even if what you say were
true, you would not have had to sneak in here in the middle of the
night.You know very well that I should have made no objections to your
claiming your own."But if I had gone to you and told you that a great lord had
robbed me, a poor woman, of something which is dearer to me than life
itself, would you have believed me?If I had said to you, 'I must look
through his Lordship's papers; I must be free to search everywhere,'
would you have given me permission to do so?That it was because I was ashamed of my errand that I came here at
this hour?All I feared was that I should be prevented from
discovering the truth.Valdriguez's voice suddenly dropped
and she seemed to forget Cyril's presence.She
continued speaking as if to herself and her wild eyes swept feverishly
around the room."He told me it was here--and yet how can I be sure of
it?He may have lied to me about this as he did about everything else.I cannot bear it any
longer, oh, my God!"she cried, clasping her hands and lifting her
streaming eyes to heaven, "Thou knowest that I have striven all my life
to do Thy will; I have borne the cross that Thou sawest fit to lay upon
me without a murmur, nor have I once begged for mercy at Thy hands; but
now, now, oh, my Father, I beseech thee, give me to know the truth
before I die----"

Cyril watched the woman narrowly.He felt that he must try and maintain
a judicial attitude toward her and not allow himself to be led astray by
his sympathies which, as he knew to his cost, were only too easily
aroused.After all, he reasoned, was it not more than likely that she
was delivering this melodramatic tirade for his benefit?On the other
hand, it was against his principles as well as against his inclinations
to deal harshly with a woman."Calm yourself, Valdriguez," he said at last."If you can convince me
that his Lordship had in his possession something which rightfully
belonged to you, I promise that, if it can be found, it shall be
restored to you.Tell me, what it is that you are looking for?"You promise--so did he--the
smooth-tongued villain!Never
will I trust one of his race again.""You have got to trust me whether you want to or not.Your position
could not be worse than it is, could it?Don't you see that your only
hope lies in being able to persuade me that you are an honest woman?"For the first time Valdriguez looked at Cyril attentively.He felt as if
her great eyes were probing his very soul."Indeed, you do not look cruel or deceitful.And, as you say, I am
powerless without you, so I must take the risk of your being what you
seem.But first, my lord, will you swear not
to betray my secret to any living being?"That is--" he hastily added, "if it has
nothing to do with the murder."CHAPTER XVI

THE STORY OF A WRONG


Cyril waited for her to continue, but for a long time it seemed doubtful
if she would have the courage to do so."I am looking," she said at last, speaking slowly and with a visible
effort, "for a paper which will tell me whether my--son is alive or
dead."So you were his Lordship's mistress----"

"Before God I was his wife!"The old story--" began Cyril, but Valdriguez stopped him with a furious
gesture."Do not dare to say that my child's mother was a loose woman!Arthur Wilmersley--may his Maker judge him as he
deserves--wrecked my life, but at least he never doubted my virtue.He
knew that the only way to get me was to marry me.""No--but for a long time I believed that he had.How could a young,
innocent girl have suspected that the man she loved was capable of such
cold-blooded deception?Even now, I cannot blame myself for having
fallen into the trap he baited with such fiendish cunning.Think of
it--he induced me to consent to a secret marriage by promising that if I
made this sacrifice for his sake, he would become a convert to my
religion--my religion!And as we stood together before the altar, I
remember that I thanked God for giving me this opportunity of saving a
soul from destruction.I never dreamed that the church he took me to was
nothing but an old ruin he had fitted up as a chapel for the occasion.How could I guess that the man who married us was not a priest but a
mountebank, whom he had hired to act the part?"Valdriguez bowed her head and the tears trickled through her thin
fingers."I know that not many people would believe you but, well--I do."It
seemed to Cyril as if the words sprang to his lips unbidden."Then indeed you are a good man," exclaimed Valdriguez, "for it is given
only to honest people to have a sure ear for the truth.Now it will be
easier to tell you the rest.Some weeks after we had gone through this
ceremony, first Lord and then Lady Wilmersley died; on her deathbed I
confided to my lady that I was her son's wife and she gave me her
blessing.My humble birth she forgave--after all it was less humble than
her own--and was content that her son had chosen a girl of her own race
and faith.As soon as the funeral was over, I urged my husband to
announce our marriage, but he would not.He proposed that we should go
for a while to the continent so that on our return it would be taken for
granted that we had been married there, and in this way much unpleasant
talk avoided.So we went to Paris and there we lived together openly as
man and wife, not indeed under his name but under mine.He pretended
that he wanted for once to see the world from the standpoint of the
people; that he desired for a short time to be free from the
restrictions of his rank.I myself dreaded so much entering a class so
far above me that I was glad of the chance of spending a few more months
in obscurity.For some weeks I was happy, then Lord Wilmersley began to
show himself to me as he really was.We had taken a large apartment near
the Luxembourg, and soon it became the meeting-ground for the most
reckless element of the Latin Quarter.Ah, if you but knew what sights I
saw, what things I heard in those days!I feared that my very soul was
being polluted, so I consulted a priest as to what I should do.He told
me it was my duty to remain constantly at my husband's side; with prayer
and patience I might some day succeed in reforming him.So I stayed in
that hell and bore the insults and humiliations he heaped upon me
without a murmur.Now, looking back on the past, I think my meekness and
resignation only exasperated him, for he grew more and more cruel and
seemed to think of nothing but how to torture me into revolt.Whether I
should have been given the strength to endure indefinitely, the life he
led me I do not know, but one evening, when we were as usual
entertaining a disreputable rabble, a young man entered.He was dressed in a
brown velveteen suit; a red sash encircled his waist; and on his arm he
flaunted a painted woman.I stood up and turned to
my husband.I could not speak--and he, the man I had loved, only
laughed--laughed!Never shall I forget the sound of that laughter....

"That night my child was born.That was twenty-eight years ago, but it
seems as if it were but yesterday that I held his small, warm body in my
arms.... Then comes a period of which I remember nothing, and when I
finally recovered my senses, they told me my child was dead.... As soon
as I was able to travel, I returned to my old home in Seville and there
I lived, working and praying--praying for my own soul and for that of my
poor baby, who had died without receiving the sacrament of baptism....
Years passed.I had become resigned to my lot, when one day I received a
letter from Lord Wilmersley.If I had only destroyed it unopened,
how much anguish would have been spared me!But at first when I read it,
I thought my happiness would have killed me, for Lord Wilmersley wrote
that my boy was not dead and that if I would meet him in Paris, he would
give me further news of him.At once did I set
out on my journey.On arriving in Paris I went to the hotel he had
indicated and was shown into a private _salon_.There for the first time
in a quarter of a century I saw again the man I had once regarded as my
husband.At first I had difficulty in recognising him, for now his true
character was written in every line of his face and figure.But I hardly
gave a thought either to him or to my wrongs, so great was my impatience
to hear news of my son.... Then that fiend began to play with me as a
cat with a mouse.Yes, my boy lived, had made his way in the world--that
was all he would tell me.My child had been adopted by some well-to-do
people, who had brought him up as their own--no, I needn't expect to
hear another word.Yes, he was a fine, strong lad--he would say no
more.... Can you imagine the scene?Finally, having wrought me up to the
point where I would have done anything to wring the truth from him, he
said to me: 'I have recently married a young wife and I am not such a
fool as to trust my honour in the keeping of a girl who married an old
man like me for his money.Now I have a plan to propose to you.Come and
live with her as her maid and help me to guard her from all eyes, and if
you fulfil your duties faithfully, at the end of three years I promise
that you shall see your son.'"His revolting proposition made my blood boil.Never, never, I told him,
would I accept such a humiliating situation.He merely shrugged his
shoulders and said that in that case I need never hope to hear what had
become of my son.I raved, threatened, pleaded, but he remained
inflexible, and finally I agreed to do his bidding.""So you, who call yourself a Christian, actually consented to help that
wretch to persecute his unfortunate young wife?"Valdriguez flung her head back defiantly.Besides, had she not taken him for better
or worse?Why should I have helped her to break the bonds her own vows
had imposed on her?He did not ill-treat her, far from it.He deprived
her of her liberty, but what of that?A nun has even less freedom than
she had.Think of it, day
after day I had to stand aside and watch the man I had once looked upon
as my husband, lavish his love, his thought, his very life indeed, on
that pretty doll.Although I no longer loved him, my flesh quivered at
the sight.""My lord, I care not for your judgment nor for that of any man.Would you have had me give up that sacred task
because a pink and white baby wanted to flaunt her beauty before the
world?Lady Wilmersley's fate troubles me not at all; but what
breaks my heart is that, as Arthur died just before the three years were
up, I fear that now I shall never know what has become of my boy.Sometimes I have feared that he is dead--but no, I will not believe it!"And in this
room--perhaps within reach of my hand as I stand here--is the paper
which would tell me where he is.Ah, my lord, I beg, I entreat you to
help me to find it!""I will gladly do so, but what reason have you for supposing that there
is such a paper?""It is true that I have only Lord Wilmersley's word for it," she
replied, and her voice sounded suddenly hopeless."Yet not once but many
times he said to me: 'I have a paper in which is written all you wish to
know, but as I do not trust you, I have hidden it, yes, in this very
room have I hidden it.'And now he is dead and I cannot find it!"Even if we cannot find the paper, there are other means of tracing your
son.We will advertise----"

"Never!""I will never consent to do
anything which might reveal to him the secret of his birth.I would long
ago have taken steps to find him, if I had not realised that I could not
do so without taking a number of people into my confidence, and, if I
did that, the story of my shame would be bound to leak out.Not for
myself did I care, but for him.Think of it, if what Lord Wilmersley
told me was true, he holds an honourable position, believes himself the
son of respectable parents.Would it not be horrible, if he should
suddenly learn that he is the nameless child of a servant girl and a
villain?The fear that he should somehow discover the truth is always
before me.That is why I made you swear to keep my secret.""Of course, I will do as you wish, but I assure you that you exaggerate
the risk.Still, let us first search this room thoroughly; then, if we
do not find the paper, it will be time enough to decide what we shall do
next.""Ah, my lord, you are very good to me and may God reward you as you
deserve.And to Cyril's dismay,
Valdriguez suddenly bent down and covered his hands with kisses.CHAPTER XVII

GUY RELENTS


Cyril and Valdriguez spent the next morning making a thorough search of
the library, but the paper they were looking for could not be found.Cyril had from the first been sceptical of success.He could not believe
that her child was still alive and was convinced that Arthur Wilmersley
had fabricated the story simply to retain his hold over the unfortunate
mother.Valdriguez, however, for a long time refused to abandon the
quest.Again and again she ransacked places they had already carefully
examined.When it was finally borne in upon her that there was no
further possibility of finding what she so sought, the light suddenly
went out of her face and she would have fallen if Cyril had not caught
her and placed her in a chair.With arms hanging limply to her sides,
her half-closed eyes fixed vacantly in front of her, she looked as if
death had laid his hand upon her.Thoroughly alarmed, Cyril had the
woman carried to her room and sent for a doctor.When the latter
arrived, he shook his head hopelessly.She had had a stroke; there was
very little he could do for her.In his opinion it was extremely
doubtful if she would ever fully recover her faculties, he said.Cyril having made every possible arrangement for the comfort of the
afflicted woman, at last allowed his thoughts to revert to his own
troubles.He realised that with the elimination of both Valdriguez and Prentice
there was no one but Anita left who could reasonably be suspected of the
murder; for that the two Frenchmen were implicated in the affair, was
too remote a possibility to be seriously considered.No, he must make up
his mind to face the facts: the girl was Anita Wilmersley and she had
killed her husband!What was he going to do, now that he knew the truth?Judson's advice that Anita should give herself up, he rejected without a
moment's hesitation.Yet, he had to acknowledge that there was little
hope of her being able to escape detection, as long as the police knew
her to be alive.... Suddenly an idea occurred to him.If they could only
be made to believe that she was dead, that and that alone would free her
at once and forever from their surveillance.She would be able to leave
England; to resume her life in some distant country where he.... Cyril
shrank instinctively from pursuing the delicious dream further.He tried
to force himself to consider judicially the scheme that was shaping
itself in his mind; to weigh calmly and dispassionately the chances for
and against its success.If a corpse resembling Anita were found,
dressed in the clothes she wore the day she left Geralton, it would
surely be taken for granted that the body was hers and that she had been
murdered.But how on earth was he to procure such a corpse and, having
procured it, where was he to hide it?The neighbourhood of the castle
had been so thoroughly searched that it would be no easy task to
persuade the police that they had overlooked any spot where a body might
be secreted.Certainly the plan presented almost insurmountable
difficulties, but as it was the only one he could think of, Cyril clung
to it with bull-dog tenacity.Impossible is but a word
designed to shield the incompetent or frighten the timid," he muttered
loudly in his heart, unconsciously squaring his broad shoulders.He decided to leave Geralton at once, for the plan must be carried out
immediately or not at all, and it was only in London that he could hope
to procure the necessary assistance.On arriving in town, however, Cyril had to admit that he had really no
idea what he ought to do next.If he could only get in touch with an
impoverished medical student who would agree to provide a body, the
first and most difficult part of his undertaking would be achieved.But
how and where was he to find this indispensable accomplice?Well, it was
too late to do anything that evening, he decided.He might as well go to
the club and get some dinner and try to dismiss the problem from his
mind for the time being.The first person he saw on entering the dining-room was Campbell.He was
sitting by himself at a small table; his round, rosy face depicted the
utmost dejection and he thrust his fork through an oyster with much the
same expression a man might have worn who was spearing a personal enemy.On catching sight of Cyril, he dropped his fork, jumped from his seat,
and made an eager step forward.Then, he suddenly wavered, evidently
uncertain as to the reception Cyril was going to accord him."Well, this is a piece of luck!"cried Cyril, stretching out his hand.Guy, looking decidedly sheepish, clasped it eagerly."I might as well tell you at once that I know I made no end of an ass of
myself the other day," he said, averting his eyes from his friend's
face."It is really pretty decent of you not to have resented my
ridiculous accusations.""Oh, that's all right," Cyril assured him, "I quite understood your
motive.But I am awfully glad you have changed your attitude towards me,
for to tell you the truth, I am in great need of your assistance."ejaculated Campbell, screwing up his face into an expression
of comic despair.As soon as there was no danger of their being overheard, Cyril told
Campbell of his interview with Judson.At first Guy could not be
persuaded that the girl was Anita Wilmersley."She is not a liar, I am sure of it!If she said that her hair had
turned white, it had turned white, and therefore it is impossible that
she had dyed it," objected Campbell."Judson suggested that she dyed only part of her hair and that it was
the rest which turned white."Having finally convinced Guy that there was no doubt as to the girl's
identity, Cyril proceeded to unfold his plan for rescuing her from the
police.Guy adjusted his eye-glass and stared at his friend speechless with
consternation."This affair has turned your brain," he finally gasped."Your plan is
absurd, absolutely absurd, I tell you.Mary travelled to the kitchen.Why, even if I could bribe some
one to procure me a corpse, how on earth could you get it to Geralton?""And where under Heaven are you to hide it?""Get me a corpse and I will arrange the rest," Cyril assured him with
more confidence than he really felt."First you saddle me with a lot of stolen jewels and now you want me to
travel around the country with a corpse under my arm!I say, you do
select nice, pleasant jobs for me!""Can't say I have," acknowledged Guy."Are you willing to sit still and see Anita Wilmersley arrested?""Certainly not, but your scheme is a mad one--madder than anything I
should have credited even you with having conceived."Campbell paused a
moment as if considering the question in all its aspects."However, the
fact that it is crazy may save us.The police will not be likely to
suspect two reputable members of society, whose sanity has so far not
been doubted, of attempting to carry through such a wild, impossible
plot.Yes," he mused, "the very impossibility of the thing may make it
possible.""Glad you agree with me," cried Cyril enthusiastically."Now how soon
can you get a corpse, do you think?"You talk as if I could order one from Whiteley's.When
can I get you a corpse--indeed?To-morrow--in a week--a month--a
year--never.The last-mentioned date I consider the most likely.I will
do what I can, that is all I can say; but how I am to go to work, upon
my word, I haven't the faintest idea.""You are an awfully clever chap, Guy."I am the absolute fool, but I am
still sane enough to know it.""Very well, I'll acknowledge that you are a fool and I only wish there
were more like you," said Cyril, clapping his friend affectionately on
the back."By the way," he added, turning away as if in search of a match and
trying to speak as carelessly as possible, "How is Anita?"For a moment Guy did not answer and Cyril stood fumbling with the
matches fearful of the effect of the question.He was still doubtful how
far his friend had receded from his former position and was much
relieved when Guy finally answered in a very subdued voice:

"She is pretty well--but--" He hesitated.He noticed that Guy's face had lengthened
perceptibly and that he toyed nervously with his eye-glass."The fact is," replied Campbell, speaking slowly and carefully avoiding
the other's eye, "I think it is possible that she misses you."Cyril's heart gave a sudden jump."I can hardly believe it," he managed to stutter."Of course, Miss Trevor may be mistaken.It was her idea, not mine, that
Ani--Lady Wilmersley I mean--is worrying over your absence.But whatever
the cause, the fact remains that she has changed very much.She is no
longer frank and cordial in her manner either to Miss Trevor or myself.It seems almost as if she regarded us both with suspicion, though what
she can possibly suspect us of, I can't for the life of me imagine.That
day at lunch she was gay as a child, but now she is never anything but
sad and preoccupied.""Perhaps she is beginning to remember the past," suggested Cyril.Miss Trevor and I have tried everything we could think
of to induce her to confide in us, but she won't.Possibly you might be
more successful--" An involuntary sigh escaped Campbell."I am sorry now
that I prevented you from seeing her.Mind you, I still think it wiser
not to do so, but I ought to have left you free to use your own
judgment.The number of her sitting-room is 62, on the second floor and,
for some reason or other, she insists on being left there alone every
afternoon from three to four.Now I have told you all I know of the
situation and you must handle it as you think best."CHAPTER XVIII

A SLIP OF THE TONGUE


Cyril spent the night in a state of pitiable indecision.Should he or
should he not risk a visit to Anita?If the police were shadowing him,
it would be fatal, but he had somehow lately acquired the conviction
that they were not.On the other hand, if he could only see her, how it
would simplify everything!As she distrusted both Guy and Miss Trevor,
even if his plot succeeded, she would probably refuse to leave England
unless he himself told her that he wished her to do so.Besides, there
were so many details to be discussed, so many arrangements to be talked
over."Yes," he said to himself as he lay staring into the darkness, "it
is my duty to see her.I shall go to her not because I want to...." A
horrid doubt made him pause.Was he so sure that his decision was not
the outcome of his own desire?How could he trust his judgment in a
matter where his inclinations were so deeply involved?Yet it would be
shocking if he allowed his own feelings to induce him to do something
which might be injurious to Anita.It was a nice question to determine
whether her need of him was sufficient to justify him in risking a
visit?For hours he debated with himself but could arrive at no
conclusion.No sooner did he resolve to stay away from her than the
thought of her unhappiness again made him waver.If he only knew why she
was so unhappy, he told himself that the situation would not be so
unendurable.When he had talked to her over the telephone, she had
seemed cheerful; she had spoken of Guy and Miss Trevor with enthusiasm.What could have occurred since then to make her distrust them and to
plunge her into such a state of gloom?As he tossed to and fro on his
hot, tumbled bed, his imagination pictured one dire possibility after
another, till at last he made up his mind that he could bear the
uncertainty no longer.Having reached this decision, Cyril could hardly refrain from rushing
off to her as soon as it was light.However, he had to curb his
impatience.Three o'clock was the only hour he could be sure of finding
her alone; so he must wait till three o'clock.But how on earth, he
asked himself, was he going to get through the intervening time?He was
in a state of feverish restlessness that was almost agony; he could not
apply himself to anything; he could only wait--wait.Although he knew
that there was no chance of his meeting Anita, he haunted the
neighbourhood of the "George" all the morning.Every few minutes he
consulted his watch and the progress of the hands seemed to him so
incredibly slow that more than once he thought that it must have stopped
altogether.Flinging back his shoulders and assuming a carelessness that almost
amounted to a swagger, Cyril entered the hotel.He was so self-conscious
that it was with considerable surprise as well as relief that he noticed
that no one paid the slightest attention to him.Even the porter hardly
glanced at him, being at the moment engaged in speeding a parting guest.Cyril decided to use the stairs in preference to the lift, as they were
less frequented than the latter, and as it happened, he made his way up
to the second landing without encountering anybody.There, however, he came face to face with a pretty housemaid, who to his
dismay looked at him attentively.Had he but
known it, she had been attracted by his tall, soldierly figure and had
merely offered him the tribute of an admiring glance.But this
explanation never occurred to our modest hero and he hurried, quite
absurdly flustered by this trifling incident.62
opened on a small, ill-lighted hall, which was for the moment completely
deserted.Now that he actually stood on the threshold of Anita's room, Cyril felt
a curious reluctance to proceed farther.It was unwise.... She might not
want to see him.... But even as these objections flashed through his
mind, he knocked almost involuntarily.His heart was beating like a sledge-hammer and
his hands were trembling.Never had he experienced such a curious
sensation before and he wondered vaguely what could be the matter with
him."I can't stand here forever," he said in his heart."I wanted to see
her; well then, why don't I open the door?Still reasoning with himself, he finally entered the room.A bright fire was burning on the hearth and before it were heaped a
number of cushions and from this lowly seat Anita had apparently hastily
arisen.The length of time he had taken to answer her summons had
evidently alarmed her, for she stood like a creature at bay, her eyes
wide open and frightened.On recognising Cyril a deep blush suffused her
face and even coloured the whiteness of her throat.Her relief was obvious, yet her manner was distant, almost repellent.Cyril had confidently anticipated such a different reception that her
unexpected coldness completed his discomfiture.He felt as if the
foundations of his world were giving away beneath his feet.He managed,
however, to murmur something, he knew not what.The pounding of his
heart prevented him from thinking coherently.When his emotion had
subsided sufficiently for him to realise what he was doing, he found
himself sitting stiffly on one side of the fire with Anita sitting
equally stiffly on the other.She was talking--no, rather she was
engaging him in polite conversation.How long she had been doing so he
did not know, but he gathered that it could not have been long, as she
was still on the subject of the weather.I hope you had better luck in the
country.To-day has been especially disagreeable," she was saying.Cyril abused the weather with a vigour which was rather surprising, in
view of the fact that till she had mentioned it, he had been sublimely
unconscious whether the sun had been shining or not.But finally even
that prolific topic was exhausted and as no other apparently suggested
itself to either, they relapsed into a constrained silence.He had so longed to see her, and now an
impalpable barrier had somehow arisen between them which separated them
more completely than mere bricks and mortar, than any distance could
have done.True, he could feast his eyes on her cameo-like profile; on
the soft curve of her cheek; on the long, golden-tipped lashes; on the
slender, white throat, which rose like a column from the laces of her
dress.But he dared not look at her too long.Cyril was not
introspective and was only dimly aware of the cause of the turmoil which
was raging in his heart.He did not know that he averted his eyes for
fear that the primitive male within him would break loose from the
fetters of his will and forcibly seize the small creature so temptingly
within his reach."If I only knew what I have done to displease her!"He longed to question her, but she held herself so rigidly aloof that he
had not the courage to do so.It was in vain that he told himself that
her coldness simplified the situation; that it would have been terrible
to have had to repel her advances; but he could find no consolation in
the thought.In speechless misery he sat gazing into the fire.Suddenly he thrilled with the consciousness that she was looking at him.The glance they exchanged was of the briefest duration, but it sufficed
to lift the weight which had been crushing him.The corners of her mouth quivered slightly, but she did not answer."If I have," he continued, "I assure you it was quite unintentionally.Why, I would give my life to save you a moment's pain.Can't you feel
that I am speaking the truth?"She turned her face towards him, and as he looked at her, Cyril realised
that it was not only her manner which had altered; she herself had
mysteriously altered.At first he could not define wherein the
difference lay, but suddenly it flashed upon him.It was the expression
of her eyes which had changed.Heretofore he had been confident that
they reflected her every emotion; but now they were inscrutable.It was
as if she had drawn a veil over her soul."I don't know what you mean," she said.There was more than a hint of
hostility in her voice.If my visit is
distasteful to you, you have only to say so and I will go."As she did not immediately answer, he added:

"Perhaps I had better go."His tone, however, somehow implied more of a
threat than a suggestion; for since they had exchanged that fleeting
glance Cyril had felt unreasonably reassured.Despite her coldness, the
memory of her tender entreaties for his speedy return, buoyed up his
conceit.She could not be as indifferent to him as she seemed, he argued
to himself.However, as the moments passed and she offered no objection
to his leaving her, his newly-aroused confidence evaporated.But he made
no motion to do so; he could not."I can't leave her till I know how I have offended her.... There are so
many arrangements to be made.... I must get in touch with her again,--"
were some of the excuses with which he tried to convince himself that he
had a right to linger.He tried to read her face, but she had averted her head till he could
see nothing but one small, pink ear, peeping from beneath her curls."It is a little difficult to know how you wish to be treated!"Her
manner was icy, but his relief was so intense that he scarcely noticed
it."She is piqued, that
is the whole trouble."He felt a man once more, master of the situation."She probably expected me to--" He shrank from pursuing the thought any
further as the hot blood surged to his face.He was again conscious of
his helplessness."I suppose you
think me cold and unfeeling?She seemed startled by his vehemence, for she looked up at him timidly."Won't you tell me what has come
between us?"Right and wrong ceased to exist for
him.He forgot everything; stooping forward he gathered her into his
arms and crushed her small body against his heart.She thrust him from her with unexpected force and stood before him with
blazing eyes."You cannot treat me like a child, who can be neglected one day and
fondled the next!At the nursing home I was too weak
and confused to realise how strangely you were behaving, but now I know.You dare to complain of my coldness--my coldness indeed!Is my coldness
a match to yours?"If you do, then your conduct is all the more inexplicable.If you do,
then I ask you, what is it, who is it, that stands between us?""If I could tell you, don't you suppose I would?""Then there is some one, some person who is keeping us apart!""Ah, you see, you can't deny it!He hardly knew what he was saying; the words seemed to have leaped to
his lips.She regarded him for a second in silence evidently only partially
convinced.He had momentarily forgotten his wife, and
although he tried to convince himself that he had spoken the truth and
that it was not she who was keeping them apart, yet he had to
acknowledge that if he had been free, he would certainly have behaved
very differently towards Anita.So in a sense he had lied to her and as
he realised this, his eyes sank before hers.She did not fail to note
his embarrassment and pressed her point inexorably."Swear that there is no other woman who has a claim on you and I will
believe you."He could not lie to her in cold blood.Yet to tell her the truth was
also out of the question, he said to himself.While he still hesitated, she continued more vehemently."I don't ask you to tell me anything of your past or my past, if you had
rather not do so.One thing, however, I must and will know--who is this
woman and what are her pretensions?""I--I cannot tell you," he said at last.Some day,
I promise you, you shall know everything, but now it is impossible.But
this much I will say--I love you as I have never loved any one in my
whole life."She trembled from head to foot and half closed her eyes.Cyril felt that this very silence
established a communion between them, more complete, more intense than
any words could have done.But as he gazed at the small, drooping
figure, he felt that his self-control was deserting him completely.He
almost reeled with the violence of his emotion."I can't stand it another moment," he said to himself."I must go
before--" He did not finish the sentence but clenched his hands till the
knuckles showed white through the skin.I can't tell you
what I feel.He murmured incoherently and seizing her hands,
he pressed them for an instant against his lips, then dropping them
abruptly, he fled from the room.Cyril in his excitement had not noticed that he had called Anita by her
name nor did he perceive the start she gave when she heard it.After the
door had clicked behind him, she sat as if turned to stone, white to her
very lips.Slowly, as if with an effort, her lips moved.she repeated over and over
again as if she were trying to learn a difficult lesson.But the tension had been too great; with a little gasp she sank fainting
to the floor.CHAPTER XIX

AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR


What he did during the next few hours, Cyril never quite knew.He
retained a vague impression of wandering through endless streets and of
being now and then arrested in his heedless course by the angry
imprecations of some wayfarer he had inadvertently jostled or of some
Jehu whose progress he was blocking.How could he have behaved like such a fool, he kept asking himself.He
had not said a thing to Anita that he had meant to say--not one.Worse
still, he had told her that he loved her!He had even held her in his
arms!Cyril tried not to exult at the thought.He told himself again and
again that he had acted like a cad; nevertheless the memory of that
moment filled him with triumphant rapture.Had he lost all sense of
shame, he wondered.He tried to consider Anita's situation, his own
situation; but he could not.He could think
neither of the past nor of the future; he could think of nothing
connectedly.The daylight waned and still he tramped steadily onward.Finally,
however, his body began to assert itself.His footsteps grew gradually
slower, till at last he realised that he was miles from home and that he
was completely exhausted.Hailing a passing conveyance, he drove to his
lodgings.He was still so engrossed in his dreams that he felt no surprise at
finding Peter sitting in the front hall, nor did he notice the dejected
droop of the latter's shoulders.On catching sight of his master, Peter sprang forward.My lord," he whispered with his finger on his lip; and turning
slightly, he cast an apprehensive glance over his shoulder towards the
top of the stairs.With an effort Cyril shook off his preoccupation.Following the
direction of his servant's eyes, he saw nothing more alarming than a few
dusty plants which were supposed to adorn the small landing where the
stairs turned.Before he had time to form a conjecture as to the cause
of Peter's agitation, the latter continued breathlessly: "Her Ladyship
'ave arrived, my lord!"Having made this announcement, he stepped back as if to watch what
effect this information would have on his master.There was no doubt
that Peter's alarm was very genuine, yet one felt that in spite of it he
was enjoying the dramatic possibilities of the situation.Cyril, however, only blinked at him uncomprehendingly."Lady Wilmersley, my lord, and she brought her baggage.I haven't known
what to do, that I haven't.I knew she ought not to stay here, but I
couldn't turn 'er out, could I?"Cyril's mind was so full of Anita that he never doubted that it was she
to whom Peter was referring, so without waiting to ask further
questions, he rushed upstairs two steps at a time, and threw open the
door of his sitting-room.On a low chair in front of the fire his wife sat reading quietly.Cyril staggered back as if he had been struck.She, however, only turned
her head languidly and closing her book, surveyed him with a mocking
smile.His disappointment added fuel to his
indignation.She seemed in nowise affected by his anger; only her expression became,
if possible, a trifle more contemptuous."Your manners have sadly deteriorated since we parted," she remarked,
raising her eyebrows superciliously.he exclaimed and his voice actually shook with rage."May I
ask how you expected to be received?Is it possible that you imagine
that I am going to take you back?"Her eyes narrowed, but she still appeared quite unconcerned."Do you know, I rather think you will," she drawled."Take you back, now that you have tired of your lover or he has become
disgusted with you, which is probably nearer the truth.Do you think I
am mad, or are you?"He fancied that he saw her wince, but she replied calmly:

"Do not let us indulge in mutual recriminations.What have you to reproach
me with?Didn't I marry you to save you from disgrace and penury?Haven't I done everything I could to keep you straight?"She rose slowly from her seat and he noticed for the first time that she
wore a low-cut gown of some diaphanous material, which revealed and yet
softened the too delicate lines of her sinuous figure.Her black hair
lay in thick waves around her face, completely covering the ears, and
wound in a coil at the back of her neck.He had never seen it arranged
in this fashion and reluctantly he had to admit that it was strangely
becoming to her.A wide band of dull gold, set with uncut gems,
encircled her head and added a barbaric note to her exotic beauty.It
was his last gift to her, he remembered.Yes, she was still beautiful, he acknowledged, although the life she had
led, had left its marks upon her.She looked older and frailer than when
he had seen her last.But to-night the sunken eyes glowed with
extraordinary brilliancy and a soft colour gave a certain roundness to
her hollow cheeks.As she stood before him, Cyril was conscious, for the
first time in years, of the alluring charm of her personality.She regarded him for a moment, her full red lips parted in an
inscrutable smile.In some mysterious way it suggested infinite
possibilities."You tried everything, I grant you," she said at last, "except the one
thing which would have proved efficacious."Yes, it was true, he
acknowledged to himself.Had he not realised it during the last few days
as he had never done before?"You don't even take the trouble to deny it," she continued."You
married me out of pity and instead of being ashamed of it, you actually
pride yourself on the purity of your motive.""Well, at any rate I can't see what there was to be ashamed of," he
replied indignantly.Oh, how you good people exasperate me!You seem to
lack all comprehension of the natural cravings of a normal human being."It was not my fault that I could not love you.""No, but knowing that you did not love me, it was dastardly of you to
have married me without telling me the truth.In doing so, you took from
me my objective in life--you destroyed my ideals.Oh, don't look so
sceptical, you fool!Can't you see that I should never have remained a
governess until I was twenty-five, if I had not had ideals?It was
because I had such lofty conceptions of love that I kept myself
scrupulously aloof from men, so that I might come to my mate, when I
found him, with soul, mind, and body unsullied."She spoke with such passionate sincerity that it was with an effort
Cyril reminded himself that her past had not been as blameless as she
pictured it."Your fine ideals did not prevent you from becoming a drunkard--" he
remarked drily."When I married, I was not a drunkard," she vehemently protested."The
existence I led was abhorrent to me, and it is true that occasionally
when I felt I could not stand it another moment, I would go to my room
after dinner and get what comfort I could out of alcohol; but what I
did, I did deliberately and not to satisfy an ungovernable appetite.I
was no more a drunkard than a woman who takes a dose of morphine during
bodily agony is a drug fiend.Of course, my conduct seems inexcusable to
you, for you are quite incapable of understanding the torture my life
was to me.""Other women have suffered far greater misfortunes and have borne them
with fortitude and dignity.""Look at me, Cyril; even now am I like other women?""Was it my fault that I was born with beauty that demanded its
due?Was I to blame that my blood leaped wildly through my veins, that
my imagination was always on fire?But I was, and still am,
instinctively and fundamentally a virtuous woman.Oh, you may sneer, but
it is true!Although as a girl I was starving for love, I never accepted
passion as a substitute, and you can't realise how incessantly the
latter was offered me.Wherever I went, I was persecuted by it.At times
I had a horrible fear that desire was all that I was capable of evoking;
and when you came to me in my misery, poverty, and disgrace, I hailed
you as my king--my man!I believed that you were offering me a love so
great that it welcomed the sacrifice of every minor consideration.It
never occurred to me that you would dare to ask me for myself, my life,
my future, unless you were able to give me in exchange something more
than the mere luxuries of existence.""I also offered you my life----"

"You did not!""You offered up your life, not to
me, but to your own miserable conception of chivalry.The greatness of
your sacrifice intoxicated you and consequently it seemed to you
inevitable that I also would spend the rest of my days in humble
contemplation of your sublime character?""Such an idea never occurred to me," Cyril angrily objected."Oh, you never formulated it in so many words, I know that!You are too
self-conscious to be introspective and are actually proud of the fact
that you never stop to analyse either yourself or your motives.So you
go blundering through life without in the least realising what are the
influences which shape your actions.You fancy that you are not
self-centred because you are too shy, yes, and too vain to probe the
hidden recesses of your heart.You imagine that you are unselfish
because you make daily sacrifices to your own ideal of conduct.But of
that utter forgetfulness of self, of that complete merging and
submerging of your identity in another's, you have never had even the
vaguest conception.When you married me, it never occurred to you that I
had the right to demand both love and comprehension.You, the idealist,
expected me to be satisfied with the material advantages you offered;
but I, the degraded creature you take me to be, had I known the truth,
would never have consented to sell my birthright for a mess of pottage.""That sounds all very fine, and I confess I may not have been a perfect
husband, but after all, what would you have done, I should like to know,
if I had not married you?"I would have worked and hoped, and if work had failed me, I would
have begged and hoped.I would even have starved, before abandoning the
hope that some day I should find the man who was destined for me.When I
at last realised that you did not love me, you cannot imagine my
despair.I consumed myself in futile efforts to please you, but the very
intensity of my love prevented me from exercising those arts and
artifices which might have brought you to my feet.My emotion in your
presence was so great that it sealed my lips and made you find me a dull
companion."You know very well that it was not that which
alienated me from you.When I married you, I may not have been what is
called in love with you, but I was certainly fond of you, and if you had
behaved yourself, I should no doubt in time have become more closely
united to you.You talk of 'consuming' yourself to please me.But you chose a
strange means of gaining my affections when you took to disgracing
yourself both privately and publicly."The passionate resentment which had transfigured her slowly faded from
Amy's face, leaving it drawn and old; her voice, when she spoke, sounded
infinitely weary."When I knew for a certainty that a lukewarm affection was all you would
ever feel for me, I lost hope, and in losing hope, I lost my foothold on
life.I wanted to die--I determined to die.Time and time again, I
pressed your pistol to my forehead, but something stronger than my will
always prevented me from pulling the trigger; and finally I sought
forgetfulness in drink, because I had not the courage to find it in
death.At first I tried to hide my condition from you, but there came a
moment when the sight of your bland self-satisfaction became unbearable,
when your absolute unconsciousness of the havoc you had made of my life
maddened me.Oh, not as I had suffered, you are
not capable of that; but at any rate I could hurt your vanity and deal a
death-blow to your pride!You had disgraced me when you tricked me into
giving myself to a man who did not love me; I determined to disgrace you
by reeling through the public streets.she cried
with indescribable bitterness."When I saw you grow pale with anger,
when I saw you tremble with shame, I suppose you fancy that I must, at
times, have suffered from remorse and humiliation?I swear that never
for a moment have I regretted the course I chose.I am ashamed of
nothing except that I lacked the courage to kill myself.How I welcomed the gradual deadening of my senses, the dulling of my
fevered brain!When I awoke from my long torpor and found myself at
Charleroi, I cursed the doctor who had brought me back to life.The thought of you haunted me day and
night, while a raging thirst racked my body, and from this twofold
torture the constant supervision of the nurses prevented me from
obtaining even a temporary respite.For a moment Cyril felt a wave of pity sweep over him, but suddenly he
stiffened."You forget to mention that--consolation was offered you."Had I found that, I should not be here!I admit, however,
that when I first noticed that M. de Brissac was attracted by me, I was
mildly pleased.It was a solace to my wounded vanity to find that some
one still found me desirable.But I swear that it never even occurred to
me to give myself to him, till the doctor told me that you were coming
to take me away with you.Subject myself anew to your
indifference--your contempt?So I took the only means of escaping
from you which offered itself.And I am glad, glad that I flung myself
into the mire, for by defiling love, I killed it.I am at last free from
the obsession which has been the torment of my life.Neither you nor any
other man will again fire my imagination or stir my senses.I am dead,
but I am also free--free!"As she spoke the last words her expression was so exalted that Cyril was
forced to grant her his grudging admiration.As she stood before him,
she seemed more a spirit than a woman; she seemed the incarnation of
life, of love, of the very fundamentals of existence.She was really an
extraordinary woman; why did he not love her, he asked himself.But even
as this flashed through his mind the memory of his long martyrdom
obtruded itself.He saw her again not as she appeared then, but as the
central figure in a succession of loathsome scenes."Your attempt to justify yourself may impose on others, but not on me.What you term love is
nothing but an abnormal craving, which no healthy-minded man with his
work in life to do could have possibly satisfied.Our code, however, is
too different for me to discuss the matter with you.And so, if you have
quite finished expatiating on my shortcomings, would you kindly tell me
to what I owe the honour of your visit?"She turned abruptly from him and leaned for a minute against the
mantelpiece; then, sinking into a chair, she took a cigarette from a box
which lay on the table near her and proceeded to light it with apparent
unconcern.Cyril, however, noticed that her hand trembled violently.After inhaling a few puffs, she threw her head back and looked at him
tauntingly from between her narrowed lids."Because, my dear Cyril, I read in yesterday's paper that your wife had
been your companion on your ill-timed journey from Paris.So I thought
it would be rather amusing to run over and find out a few particulars as
to the young person who is masquerading under my name."She had caught Cyril completely off his guard and he felt for a moment
incapable of parrying her attack."I assure you," he stuttered, "it is all a mistake--" He hesitated; he
could think of no explanation which would satisfy her."I expected you to tell me that she was as pure as snow!""But how you with your puritanic ideas managed to
get yourself into such an imbroglio passes my understanding.Really, I
consider that you owe it to me, to satisfy my curiosity.""I regret that I am unable to do so."Still, as I shall no doubt solve the riddle in a few days, I
can possess my soul in patience.Meanwhile I shall enjoy watching your
efforts to prevent me from learning the truth.""Unfortunately for you, that pleasure will be denied you.You are going
to leave this house at once and we shall not meet again till we do so
before judge and jury.""So you will persist in trying to bluff it out?Don't you
realise that I hold all the cards and that I am quite clever enough to
use them to the best advantage?You see, knowing you as I do, I am
convinced that the motive which led you to sacrifice both truth and
honour is probably as praiseworthy as it is absurd.But having made such
a sacrifice, why are you determined to render it useless?I cannot
believe that you are willing to face the loss not only of your own
reputation but of that of the young person who has accepted your
protection.How do you fancy she would enjoy figuring as corespondent in
a divorce suit?"Cyril felt as if he were caught in a trap."My God," he cried, "you wouldn't do that!I swear to you that she is
absolutely innocent.She was in a terrible situation and to say that she
was my wife seemed the only way to save her.She doesn't even know I am
married!"And have you never considered that when she finds out the
truth, she may fail to appreciate the delicacy which no doubt prevented
you from mentioning the trifling fact of my existence?It is rather
funny that your attempts to rescue forlorn damsels seem doomed to be
unsuccessful!Or were your motives in this case not quite so impersonal
as I fancied?Has Launcelot at last found his Guinevere?If so, I may
yet be avenged vicariously.""Your presence is punishment enough, I assure you, for all the sins I
ever committed!What exactly is it that you are
threatening me with?"If neither you nor this woman object to its
being known that you travelled together as man and wife, then I am
powerless.""But you have just acknowledged that you know that our relation is a
harmless one," cried Cyril."I do not know it--but--yes, I believe it.Do you think, however, that
any one else will do so?""Surely you would not be such a fiend as to wreck the life of an
innocent young girl?""If her life is wrecked, whose fault is it?It
was you who by publicly proclaiming her to be your wife, made it
impossible for her disgrace to remain a secret.Don't you realise that
even if I took no steps in the matter, sooner or later the truth is
bound to be discovered?Now I--and I alone--can save you from the
consequences of your folly.If you will agree not to divorce me, I
promise not only to keep your secret, but to protect the good name of
this woman by every means in my power.""I should like to know what you expect to gain by trying to force me to
take you back?Is it the title that you covet, or do you long to shine
in society?But remember that in order to do that, you would have
radically to reform your habits.""I have no intention of reforming and I don't care a fig for
conventional society!""You tell me that you no longer love me and that you found existence
with me unsupportable.Why then are you not willing to end it?""It is true, I no longer love you, but while I live, no other woman
shall usurp my place."When you broke your marriage vows, you forfeited your right
to a place in my life.You can have
all the money you can possibly want as long as you neither do nor say
anything to imperil the reputation of the young lady in question.""All the wealth in the world could not buy my silence!""In order to
shield a poor innocent child, you demand that I sacrifice my freedom, my
future, even my honour?Have you no sense of justice, no pity?"It is now for you to decide whether I
am to go or stay.Cyril looked into her white, set face; what he read there destroyed his
last, lingering hope."Stay," he muttered through his clenched teeth.CHAPTER XX

"I KNOW IT, COUSIN CYRIL"


Cyril leaned wearily back in his chair.He was in that state of
apathetic calm which sometimes succeeds a violent emotion.Of his wife
he had neither seen or heard anything since they parted the night
before.Cyril started, for he had not noticed Peter's entrance and the
suppressed excitement of the latter's manner alarmed him."She's 'ere, my lord," replied Peter, dropping his voice till it was
almost a whisper."The--the young lady, my lord, as you took charge of on the train.I was
just passing through the 'all as she came in and so----"

"Here?""Why didn't you show her up at once?""If 'er Ladyship should 'ear----"

"Mind your own business, you fool, or----"

But Peter had already scuttled out of the room.Cyril waited, every nerve strung to the highest tension.Yet if his visitor was really Anita, some new
misfortune must have occurred!It seemed to him ages before the door
again opened and admitted a small, cloaked figure, whose features were
practically concealed by a heavy veil.A glance, however, sufficed to
assure him that it was indeed Anita who stood before him.While Cyril
was struggling to regain his composure, she lifted her veil.The
desperation of her eyes appalled him.cried Cyril, striding forward and seizing
her hands."Lord Wilmersley--" Cyril jumped as if he had been shot."Yes," she
continued, "I know who you are.For the first time the ghost of a smile hovered round her lips.What a blundering fool I have been from first to last!"For some days I had been haunted by
fragmentary visions of the past and before I saw you yesterday, I was
practically certain that you were not my husband.It was not without
a struggle that I finally made up my mind that you had deceived me.I
told myself again and again that you were not the sort of a man who
would take advantage of an unprotected girl; yet the more I thought
about it, the more convinced I became that my suspicions were correct.Then I tried to imagine what reason you could have for posing as my
husband, but I could think of none.I didn't know what
to do, whom to turn to; for if I could not trust you, whom could I
trust?When I heard my name, it was as if a dim light suddenly flooded
my brain.I remembered leaving Geralton, but little by
little I realised with dismay that I was still completely in the dark as
to who you were, why you had come into my life.It seemed to me that if
I could not discover the truth, I should go mad.Then I decided to
appeal to Miss Trevor.I was somehow convinced that she did not know who I was, but I said
to myself that she would certainly have heard of my disappearance, for I
could not believe that Arthur had allowed me to go out of his life
without moving heaven and earth to find me.""No; it was Miss Trevor who told me that Arthur was dead--that he had
been murdered.""You see," she added with
pathetic humility, "there are still so many things I do not remember.Even now I can hardly believe that I, I of all people, killed my
husband."Cyril ached for pity of her."Why take it for granted that you did?"he suggested, partly from a
desire to comfort her, but also because there really lingered a doubt in
his mind."Not at present, but----"

She threw up her hands with a gesture of despair.But I never meant to--you will believe that, won't
you?Those doctors were right, I must have been insane!"Arthur only intended to frighten you by sending
for those men.""But if I was not crazy, why can I remember so little of what took place
on that dreadful night and for some time afterwards?""I am told that a severe shock often has that effect," replied Cyril."But, oh, how I wish you could answer a few questions!I don't want to
raise your hopes; but there is one thing that has always puzzled me and
till that is explained I for one shall always doubt whether it was you
who killed Arthur."Again the eager light leaped into her eyes."Oh, tell me quickly what--what makes you think that I may not have done
so?"Cyril contemplated her a moment in silence.He longed to pursue the
topic, but was fearful of the effect it might have on her."Yet now that she knows the worst, it may be a relief to her to talk
about it," he said to himself."Yes, I will risk it," he finally
decided."Do you remember that you put a drug in Arthur's coffee?""Then you must have expected to make your escape before he regained
consciousness.""Then why did you arm yourself with a pistol?""But if you shot Arthur, you must have had a pistol."She stared at Cyril in evident bewilderment."I could have sworn I had no pistol."Cyril tried to control his rising excitement."You knew, however, that
Arthur owned one?""Yes, but I never knew where he kept it.""You are sure you have not forgotten----"

"No, no!""My memory is perfectly clear up to the
time when Arthur seized me and threw me on the floor.""Oh, yes, I have a vague recollection of a long walk through the
dark--of a train--of you--of policemen.But everything is so confused
that I can be sure of nothing."Cyril paced the room deep in thought."It seems to me incredible," he said at last, "that if you did not even
know where to look for a pistol, you should have found it, to say
nothing of having been able to use it, while you were being beaten into
unconsciousness by that brute.""It is extraordinary, and yet I must have done so.For it has been
proved, has it not, that Arthur and I were absolutely alone?"How can we be sure that some one was not concealed in
the room or did not climb in through the window or--why, there are a
thousand possibilities which can never be proved!"she exclaimed, her whole body trembling with eagerness."I now
remember that I had put all my jewels in a bag, and as that has
disappeared, a burglar--" But as she scanned Cyril's face, she paused."You had the bag with you at the nursing home.The jewels are safe," he
said very gently."Then," she cried, "it is useless trying to deceive ourselves any
longer--I killed Arthur and must face the consequences.""But don't you see that I can't spend the rest of my life in hiding?Think what it would mean to live in daily, hourly dread of exposure?That is not what
I am afraid of.But the idea of you, Anita, in prison.Why, it is out of
the question."And if it did, what of it?"There is nothing you can do," she said, laying her hand gently on his
arm.Oh, I can never thank you enough
for all your goodness to me!""Don't--don't--I would gladly give my life for you!""I know it, Cousin Cyril," she murmured, with downcast eyes.A wave of
colour swept for a moment over her face.With a mighty effort he strove to regain his composure.Yes, that was what he was to her--that was all he could
ever be to her."I know how noble, how unselfish you are," she continued, lifting her
brimming eyes to his.Anita, is it possible that you----"

"Hush!Let me go," she cried, for Cyril had seized
her hand and was covering it with kisses.Cyril and Anita moved hurriedly
away from each other."Inspector Griggs is 'ere, my lord."Peter's face had resumed its usual stolid expression.He appeared not to
notice that his master and the latter's guest were standing in strained
attitudes at opposite ends of the room.Cyril motioned Peter impatiently away."This is the best
time for me to give myself up."I have a plan----"

He was interrupted by the reappearance of Peter."The inspector is very sorry, my lord, but he has to see you at once, 'e
says.""It is no use putting it off," Anita said firmly.If you don't, I shall go down and speak to him myself."Cyril did not know what to do.So turning to the latter, he said:

"You can bring him up in ten minutes--not before."Anita," implored Cyril, as soon as they were again alone, "I beg you
not to do this thing.If a plan that I have in mind succeeds, you will
be able to leave the country and begin life again under another name."She listened attentively, but when he had finished she shook her head."I will not allow you to attempt it.If your fraud were discovered--and
it would surely be discovered--your life would be ruined.""I tell you I will not hear of it.No, I am determined to end this
horrible suspense."I entreat you at all events to wait a little while longer."Was there
nothing he could say to turn her from her purpose?If she should hear, if she should know--" he began
tentatively.He was amazed at the effect of his words."Why didn't you tell me that she was here?""Of course, I haven't the slightest intention of
involving her in my affairs."But you can't leave the house without Griggs seeing you, and he would
certainly guess who you are.Stay in the next room till he is gone, that
is all I ask of you.Here, quick, I hear footsteps on the stairs."Cyril had hardly time to fling himself into a chair before the inspector
was announced.CHAPTER XXI

THE TRUTH


"Good-morning, my lord.Rather early to disturb you, I am afraid."Cyril noticed that Griggs's manner had undergone a subtle change.Although perfectly respectful, he seemed to hold himself rigidly aloof.There was even a certain solemnity about his trivial greeting.Cyril
felt that another blow was impending.Instantly and instinctively he
braced himself to meet it."The fact is, my lord, I should like to ask you a few questions, but I
warn you that your answers may be used against you.""Have you missed a bag, my lord?"Sandra moved to the kitchen.It has turned up at last," thought Cyril.He knows more about my things than I do," he
managed to answer, as he lifted a perfectly expressionless face to
Griggs's inspection.But I fancy that as far as this particular bag is
concerned, that is not the case.""Because I do not see what reason he could have had for hiding one of
his master's bags up the chimney.""So the bag was found up the chimney?Will you tell me what motive I am
supposed to have had for wishing to conceal it?Did it contain anything you thought I might want to
get rid of?"We know that Priscilla Prentice bought this bag a
fortnight ago in Newhaven.Now, if you are able to explain how it came
into your possession, I would strongly advise your doing so.""I have never to my knowledge laid eyes on the girl, and I cannot,
therefore, believe that a bag of hers has been found here.""We can prove it," replied the inspector."The maker's name is inside
and the man who sold it to her is willing to swear that it is the
identical bag.One of our men has made friends with your chamber-maid
and she confessed that she had discovered it stuffed up the chimney in
your bedroom.She is a stupid girl and thought you had thrown it away,
so she took it.Only afterwards, it occurred to her that you had a
purpose in placing the bag where she had found it and she was going to
return it when my man prevented her from doing so."I congratulate
you, Inspector," said Cyril, trying to speak superciliously."But you
omitted to mention the most important link in the chain of evidence you
have so cleverly forged against me," he continued."How am I supposed to
have got hold of this bag?I did not stop in Newhaven and you have had
me so closely watched that you must know that since my arrival in
England I have met no one who could have given it to me.""No, my lord, we are by no means sure of this.It is
true that we have, so to speak, kept an eye on you, but, till yesterday,
we had no reason to suspect that you had any connection with the murder,
so we did not think it necessary to have you closely followed.There
have been hours when we have had no idea where you were.""It is quite possible," continued the inspector without heeding Cyril's
interruption, "that you have met either Prentice or Lady Wilmersley, the
dowager, I mean."And why should they have given this bag to me, of all people?Surely you must see that they could have found many easier, as well as
safer, ways of disposing of it.""Quite so, my lord, and that is why I am inclined to believe that it was
not through either of them that the bag came into your possession.I
think it more probable that her Ladyship brought it with her.""You told me yourself that her Ladyship met you in Newhaven; that, in
fact, she had spent the night of the murder there."Cyril clutched the table convulsively.Why had it never
occurred to him that his lies might involve an innocent person?"But this is absurd, you know," he stammered, in a futile effort to gain
time."There has been a terrible mistake, I tell you.""In that case her Ladyship can no doubt easily explain it."But if you
wish it, I will not question her till she has been examined by our
doctors."Cyril rose and moved automatically towards the door."Sorry, my lord, but for the present you can see her Ladyship only
before witnesses."What is the use of asking my permission?You are master here, so it
seems," exclaimed Cyril.His nerves were at last getting beyond his
control."I am only doing my duty and I assure you that I want to cause as little
unpleasantness as possible.""Ask her Ladyship please to come here as soon as she can get ready.If
she is asleep, it will be necessary to wake her."The two men sat facing each other in silence.Cyril was hardly conscious of the other's presence.He must think; he
knew he must think; but his brain seemed paralysed.There must be a way
of clearing his wife without casting suspicion on Anita.Was it possible that he was now called upon to choose
between the woman he hated and the woman he loved, between honour and
dishonour?The door opened and Amy came slowly into the room.She was wrapped in a red velvet dressing-gown and its warm colour
contrasted painfully with the greyness of her face and lips.On catching
sight of the inspector, she started, but controlling herself with an
obvious effort, she turned to her husband."You can see for yourself, Inspector, that her Ladyship is in no
condition to be questioned," remonstrated Cyril, moving quickly to his
wife's side."Just as you say, my lord, but in that case her Ladyship had better
finish her dressing.It will be necessary for her to accompany me to
headquarters.""I will not allow it," cried Cyril, almost beside himself and throwing a
protecting arm around Amy's shoulders.Her bloodshot eyes rested a moment on her husband, then gently
disengaging herself, she drew herself to her full height and faced the
inspector."His Lordship----"

"Do not listen to his Lordship.It is I who demand to be told the
truth.""Amy, I beg you--" interposed Cyril."No, no," she cried, shaking off her husband's hand.Don't you see that you are torturing me?"It is all my fault," began Cyril."I am waiting to hear what the inspector has to say."Griggs cast a questioning look at Cyril, which the latter answered by a
helpless shrug."A bag has been found in his Lordship's chimney, which was lately
purchased in Newhaven.But perhaps before
answering, you may wish to consult your legal adviser.""I will neither acknowledge nor deny anything until I have seen this bag
and know of what I am accused," she answered after a barely perceptible
pause.Griggs opened the door and called:

"Jones, the bag, please."Had the moment come when he must proclaim the truth?"Am I supposed to have bought this bag?"It was sold to Prentice, who was sempstress at Geralton
and we believe it is the one in which Lady Wilmersley carried off her
jewels."Amy gave a muffled exclamation, but almost instantly she regained her
composure."If that is so, how do you connect me with it?Because it happens to
have been found here, do you accuse me of having robbed my cousin?""No, my lady, but as you spent the night of the murder in Newhaven----"

To Cyril's surprise she shuddered from head to foot.she cried, stretching out her hands as if to ward off a blow.His Lordship himself told me that you had
joined him there."It was not her Ladyship who was with me.Her Ladyship was in
Paris at the time.Thank God, thought Cyril, he had at last found
a way of saving both his love and his honour.Of a murder which was committed while you were
still in France--" asked Griggs, lifting his eyebrows incredulously.I mean I instigated it--I hated my cousin--I needed the money, so
I hired an accomplice.Of course, if you insist upon it, I shall have to
arrest you, but I don't believe you had anything more to do with the
murder than I had, and I would stake my reputation on your being as
straight a gentleman as I ever met professionally.Wait a bit, my lord,
don't be 'asty."In his excitement Griggs dropped one of his carefully
guarded aitches."You have arrived in the nick of time.Campbell cast a bewildered look at the inspector."His Lordship says that he hired an assassin to murder Lord Wilmersley.""He _shall_ believe me," cried Cyril."I alone am responsible for
Wilmersley's death.The person who actually fired the shot was nothing
but my tool.Really, Cyril, you are too ridiculous,"
exclaimed Campbell.Suddenly he caught sight of Amy, cowering in the shadow of the curtain.Cyril gave Guy a look
in which he tried to convey all that he did not dare to say.I told him you were engaged, but he says
he would like to speak to you most particular.""I don't want to see him," began Cyril."Don't be a greater fool than you can help," exclaimed Campbell."How do
you know that he has not some important news?"I took the liberty of forcing
myself upon you at this moment, my lord, because I have just learnt
certain facts which----"

"It is too late to report," interposed Cyril hastily."Why, my lord, what is the use of pretending that you had anything to do
with the murder?I hurried here to tell you that there is no further
need of your sacrificing yourself.I have found out who----"

"Shut up, I say.cried
Cyril incoherently."Don't listen to his Lordship," said Amy."We all know, of course, that
he is perfectly innocent.She
cast a keen look at Cyril."That's just it," Judson agreed.I convinced
his Lordship that Lord Wilmersley was murdered by his wife.I have come
here to tell him that I was mistaken.It is lucky that I discovered the
truth in time."His relief
was so intense that it robbed him of all power of concealment.Amy's mouth hardened into a straight, inflexible line; her eyes
narrowed."I suppose that you have some fact to support your extraordinary
assertion?"demanded Griggs, unable to hide his vexation at finding that
his rival had evidently outwitted him."Certainly, but I will say no more till I have his Lordship's
permission."I am more anxious than
any one to discover the truth.""Permit me to suggest, my lord, that it would be better if I could first
speak to you in private.""Nonsense," exclaimed Cyril impatiently."I am tired of this eternal
secrecy."Very well, only remember, I warned you.""Have you forgotten, my lord, that I told you I always had an idea that
those two Frenchmen who were staying at the Red Lion Inn, were somehow
implicated in the affair?""But what possible motive could they have had for murdering my cousin?"The detective's eyes appeared to wander aimlessly from one of his
auditors to another.She moved slowly forward, and leaning her arm on
the mantelpiece confronted the four men.The detective inclined his head and again turned towards Cyril."Having once discovered their identity, my lord, their motive was quite
apparent.""The elder," began Judson, speaking very slowly, "is Monsieur de
Brissac.For a moment Cyril was too stunned to speak.He could do nothing but
stare stupidly at the detective.He
hardly knew what he was saying.He only realised confusedly that
something within him was crying to him to save her.A wonderful light suddenly transfigured Amy's drawn face."Cyril, would you really do this for----"

"Hush!""I don't care now who knows the truth.Don't you see that she is not accountable for what
she is saying?"He had forgotten everything but that she
was a woman--his wife."I killed Lord Wilmersley," Amy repeated, as if he had not spoken, "but
I did not murder him.""Does your Ladyship expect us to believe that you happened to call at
the castle at half-past ten in the evening, and that during an amicable
conversation you accidentally shot Lord Wilmersley?""No," replied Amy contemptuously, "of course not!"If your Ladyship had not ulterior purpose in going to Newhaven, why did
you disguise yourself as a boy and live there under an assumed name?And
who is this Frenchman who posed as your brother?""Monsieur de Brissac was my lover.When we discovered that his Lordship
was employing detectives, we went to Newhaven, because we thought that
it was the last place where they would be likely to look for us.I
disguised myself to throw them off the scent.""But the description the inspector gave me of the boy did not resemble
you in the least," insisted Cyril.I merely cut off my hair and dyed it.She
snatched the black wig from her head, disclosing a short crop of reddish
curls."You have yet to explain," resumed the inspector sternly, "what took you
to Geralton in the middle of the night.Under the circumstances I should
have thought your Ladyship would hardly have cared to visit his
Lordship's relations."Ignoring Griggs, Amy turned to her husband."My going there was the purest accident," she began in a dull,
monotonous voice, almost as if she were reciting a lesson, but as she
proceeded, her excitement increased till finally she became so absorbed
in her story that she appeared to forget her hearers completely."I was
horribly restless, so we spent most of our time motoring and often
stayed out very late.I noticed that we had
stopped within a short walk of the castle.As I had never seen it except
at a distance, it occurred to me that I would like to have a nearer view
of the place.In my boy's clothes I found it fairly easy to climb the
low wall which separates the gardens from the park.Not a light was to
be seen, so, as there seemed no danger of my being discovered, I
ventured on to the terrace.As I stood there, I heard a faint cry.My
first impulse was to retrace my footsteps as quickly as possible, but
when I realised that it was a woman who was crying for help, I felt that
I must find out what was the matter.Running in the direction from which
the sound came, I turned a corner and found myself confronted by a
lighted window.The shrieks were now positively blood-curdling and there
was no doubt in my mind that some poor creature was being done to death
only a few feet away from me.The window was high above my head, but I
was determined to reach it.After several unsuccessful attempts I
managed to gain a foothold on the uneven surface of the wall and hoist
myself on to the window-sill.Luckily the window was partially open, so
I was able to slip noiselessly into the room and hide behind the
curtain.Peering through the folds, I saw a woman lying on the floor.Her bodice was torn open, exposing her bare back.Over her stood a man
who was beating her with a piece of cord which was attached to the waist
of a sort of Eastern dressing-gown he wore."'So you thought you would leave me, did you?'he cried over and over
again as the lash fell faster and faster.Not till I
send you to hell, which I will some day.'"At last he paused and wiped the perspiration from his brow.He was very
fat and his exertions were evidently telling on him.I have my pistol within reach of my
hand.Ah, you didn't know that, did you?'"The woman shuddered but made no attempt to rise."I was slowly recovering from the terror which had at first paralysed
me.I realised I must act at once if I meant to save Lady Wilmersley's
life."Dropping on my hands and knees, I crept cautiously toward it.'Kill
you, kill you, that is what I ought to do,' he kept repeating.No pistol was to be seen; yet I knew it was there.As I fumbled among his papers, my hand touched an ancient steel
gauntlet.Some instinct told me that I had found what I sought.But how
to open it was the question.Some agonising moments passed before I at
last accidentally pressed the spring and a pistol lay in my hand."He swung around and as he caught sight of the pistol levelled at his
head, the purple slowly faded from his face."Then seemingly reassured at finding that it was only a boy who
confronted him, he took a step forward.he blustered, but I noticed that his knees
shook and he made no further effort to move.There is a car waiting in the road,' I called
to the girl."I held him with my eye and saw his coward soul quiver with fear as I
moved deliberately nearer him."I knew rather than saw that she picked up a jacket and bag which lay
near the window.With a soft thud she dropped into the night.That is
the last I saw of her."As Lord Wilmersley saw his wife disappear, he gave a cry like a wounded
animal and rushed after her.He staggered back a few steps,
then turning he ran into the adjoining room.I heard a splash but did
not stop to find out what happened.Almost beside myself with terror, I
fled from the castle.If you have any more questions to ask, you had
better hurry."She stopped abruptly, trembling from head to foot, and glanced wildly
about her till her eyes rested on her husband.For a long, long moment
she regarded him in silence.She seemed to be gathering herself together
for a supreme effort.All four men watched her in breathless suspense.With her eyes still fastened on Cyril she fumbled in the bosom of her
dress, then her hand shot out, and before any one could prevent her, she
jabbed a hypodermic needle deep into her arm.cried Cyril, springing forward and wrenching the
needle from her.A beatific smile spread slowly over her face.She swayed a little and would have fallen if Cyril had not caught her."It is too late," she murmured.I--loved--you--so----"




CHAPTER XXII

CAMPBELL RESIGNS


Under a yew tree, overlooking a wide lawn, bordered on the farther side
by a bank of flowers, three people are sitting clustered around a
tea-table.One of them is a little old lady, the dearest old lady imaginable.By
her side, in a low basket chair, a girl is half sitting, half reclining.Her small figure, clad in a simple black frock, gives the impression of
extreme youth, which impression is heightened by the fact that her
curly, yellow hair, reaching barely to the nape of her neck, is caught
together by a black ribbon like a schoolgirl's.But when one looks more
closely into her pale face, one realises somehow that she is a woman and
a woman who has suffered--who still suffers.On the ground facing the younger woman a red-headed young man in white
flannels is squatting tailor-fashion.He is holding out an empty cup to
be refilled.exclaims the little old lady in a horrified tone."Why,
you have had three already!""My dear Trevie, let me inform you once and for all that I have
abandoned my figure.Why should I persist in the struggle now that Anita
refuses to smile on me?When one's heart is broken, one had better make
the most of the few pleasures one can still enjoy.Anita took no notice of his sally; her eyes were fixed on the distant
horizon; she seemed absorbed in her own thoughts."By the way," remarked Campbell casually as he sipped his tea, "I spent
last Sunday at Geralton."A faint flutter of
the eyelids was the only indication she gave of having heard him, yet
Guy was convinced that she was waiting breathlessly for him to continue.You would hardly
know it--the interior, I mean."Although he had pointedly addressed
Anita, she made no comment.It was only after a long silence that she
finally spoke.She plays all day long with the dolls Cyril bought for
her.Miss Trevor took up her knitting, which had been lying in her lap, and
was soon busy avoiding the pitfalls a heel presents to the unwary."I think I will go for a walk," said Anita, rising slowly from her seat.There was a hint of exasperation in her voice which escaped neither of
her hearers.Miss Trevor peered anxiously over her spectacles at the retreating
figure.Campbell's rubicund countenance had grown strangely grave.he asked as soon as Anita was out of earshot.Miss Trevor shook her head disconsolately.I can't imagine what can be the matter with her.She
seemed at one time to have recovered from her terrible experience.But
now, as you can see for yourself, she is absolutely wretched.She hardly eats enough to keep a bird alive.If
she goes on like this much longer, she will fret herself into her grave.Yet whenever I question her, she assures me that she is all right.I
really don't know what I ought to do.""Has it never occurred to you that she may be wondering why Wilmersley
has never written to her, nor been to see her?""She inquires after everybody
at Geralton except Cyril.Doesn't that strike you as very suspicious?""Oh, you don't mean that----"

He nodded.You told me yourself that she had only seen
him three or four times.""True, but you must remember that they met under very romantic
conditions.And Cyril is the sort of chap who would be likely to appeal
to a girl's imagination.""I wish I didn't," muttered Guy under his breath.She heard him, however, and laid her small, wrinkled hand tenderly on
his shoulder."My poor boy, I guessed your trouble long ago."It doesn't hurt any longer--not much at least.When one
realises a thing is quite hopeless, one somehow ends by adjusting
oneself to the inevitable.What I feel for her now is more worship than
love.I want above all things that she should be happy, and if Cyril can
make her so, I would gladly speed his wooing.""Do you think he has any thought of her?""Then why has he given no sign of life all these months?""I fancy he is waiting for the year of their mourning to elapse.But I
confess that I am surprised that he has been able to restrain his
impatience as long as this.Every day I have expected--"

"By Jove!"cried Campbell, springing to his feet, "there he is now!"Miss Trevor turned and saw a tall figure emerge from the house.Being plunged suddenly into the midst of romance, together with the
unexpected and dramatic arrival of the hero, was too much for the little
lady's composure.Her bag, her knitting, her glasses fell to the ground
unheeded as she rose hurriedly to receive Lord Wilmersley.Let me give you a cup of tea, or would you prefer
some whiskey and soda?"She was so flustered that she hardly knew what
she was saying.Rather fancied I
might run across you."Cyril's eyes strayed anxiously hither and thither.Cyril gave a start of guilty surprise."Yes, I was wondering where
she was.""She has gone for a little walk, but as she never leaves the grounds,
she can't be very far off," said Miss Trevor."Perhaps--" Cyril hesitated; he was painfully embarrassed."I will show you where you are likely to find
her."I did rather want to see her--ahem, on business!"jeered Campbell as he sauntered off.For a moment Cyril glared at Guy's back indignantly; then mumbling an
apology to Miss Trevor, he hastened after him.They had gone only a short distance before they espied a small,
black-robed figure coming towards them.Guy stopped short; he glanced at
Cyril, but the latter was no longer conscious of his presence.Without a
word he turned and hurriedly retraced his footsteps."Well, Trevie," he said, "I must be going.His manner was quite ostentatiously cheerful.Miss Trevor, however, was not deceived by it."You are a dear,
courageous boy," she murmured.With a flourish of his hat that seemed to repudiate all sympathy, Guy
turned on his heel and marched gallantly away.Meanwhile, in another part of the garden, a very different scene was
being enacted.On catching sight of each other Cyril and Anita had both halted
simultaneously.Cyril's heart pounded so violently that he could hardly
hear himself think."I must be calm," he said to himself.If I only had a little more time to collect my wits!I know I
shall make an ass of myself!"As these thoughts went racing through his brain, he had been moving
almost automatically forward.Already he could distinguish the soft
curve of her parted lips and the colour of her dilated eyes.He was conscious of a wild desire to fly from
her presence; but it was too late.For a moment neither moved, but under the insistence of his gaze her
eyes slowly sank before his.Then, without a word, as one who merely
claims his own, he flung his arms around her and crushed her to his
heart.THE END

her._"--London Standard."In these days of overmuch involved plot and diction in the writing of
novels, a book like this brings a sense of refreshment, as much by the
virility and directness of its style as by the interest of the story it
tells.... The human interest of the book is absorbing.The descriptions
of life in India and England are delightful.... But it is the intense
humanity of the story--above all, that of its dominating character, Nick

[Footnote C: The food is partly prepared by the liver and some other
organs.]WHAT DOES THE BODY NEED FOR FOOD?[Illustration: N]OW that you know how the body is fed, you must next
learn what to feed it with; and what each part needs to make it grow and
to keep it strong and well.A large part of your body is made of water.So you need, of course, to
drink water, and to have it used in preparing your food.Water comes from the clouds, and is stored up in cisterns or in springs
in the ground.From these pipes are laid to lead the water to our
houses.Sometimes, men dig down until they reach a spring, and so make a well
from which they can pump the water, or dip it out with a bucket.Water that has been standing in lead pipes, may have some of the lead
mixed with it.Such water would be very likely to poison you, if you
drank it.Impurities are almost sure to soak into a well if it is near a drain or
a stable.If you drink the water from such a well, you may be made very sick by
it.It is better to go thirsty, until you can get good water.A sufficient quantity of pure water to drink is just as important for
us, as good food to eat.We could not drink all the water that our bodies need.We take a large
part of it in our food, in fruits and vegetables, and even in beefsteak
and bread.You remember the bone that was nothing but crumbling
lime after it had been in the fire.We can not eat lime; but the grass and the grains take it out of the
earth.Then the cows eat the grass and turn it into milk, and in the
milk we drink, we get some of the lime to feed our bones.[Illustration: _Lime being prepared for our use._]

In the same way, the grain growing in the field takes up lime and other
things that we need, but could not eat for ourselves.The lime that thus
becomes a part of the grain, we get in our bread, oat-meal porridge, and
other foods.Animals need salt, as children who live in the country know very well.They have seen how eagerly the cows and the sheep lick up the salt that
the farmer gives them.Even wild cattle and buffaloes seek out places where there are salt
springs, and go in great herds to get the salt.We, too, need some salt mixed with our food.If we did not put it in,
either when cooking, or afterward, we should still get a little in the
food itself.Muscles are lean meat, that is flesh; so muscles need flesh-making
foods.These are milk, and grains like wheat, corn and oats; also, meat
and eggs.Most of these foods really come to us out of the ground.Meat
and eggs are made from the grain, grass, and other vegetables that the
cattle and hens eat.We need cushions and wrappings of fat, here and there in our bodies, to
keep us warm and make us comfortable.So we must have certain kinds of
food that will make fat.[Illustration: _Esquimaux catching walrus._]

There are right places and wrong places for fat, as well as for other
things in this world.When alcohol puts fat into the muscles, that is
fat badly made, and in the wrong place.The good fat made for the parts of the body which need it, comes from
fat-making foods.In cold weather, we need more fatty food than we do in summer, just as
in cold countries people need such food all the time.The Esquimaux, who live in the lands of snow and ice, catch a great many
walrus and seal, and eat a great deal of fat meat.You would not be well
unless you ate some fat or butter or oil.Sugar will make fat, and so will starch, cream, rice, butter, and fat
meat.As milk will make muscle and fat and bones, it is the best kind of
food.Here, again, it is the earth that sends us our food.Fat meat
comes from animals well fed on grain and grass; sugar, from sugar-cane,
maple-trees, or beets; oil, from olive-trees; butter, from cream; and
starch, from potatoes, and from corn, rice, and other grains.Green apples and other unripe fruits are not yet ready to be eaten.The
starch which we take for food has to be changed into sugar, before it
can mix with the blood and help feed the body.As the sun ripens fruit,
it changes its starch to sugar.You can tell this by the difference in
the taste of ripe and unripe apples.Most children like candy so well, that they are in danger of eating more
sugar than is good for them.We would not need to be quite so much afraid of a little candy if it
were not for the poison with which it is often.Even what is called pure, white candy is sometimes not really such.There is a simple way by which you can find this out for yourselves.If you put a spoonful of sugar into a tumbler of water, it will all
dissolve and disappear.Put a piece of white candy into a tumbler of
water; and, if it is made of pure sugar only, it will dissolve and
disappear.If it is not, you will find at the bottom of the tumbler some white
earth.Candy-makers often put it
into candy in place of sugar, because it is cheaper than sugar.Why is it not safe to drink water that has been
          standing in lead pipes?Why is the water of a well that is near a drain
          or a stable, not fit to drink?What is said of the fat made by alcohol?John went back to the hallway.How does the sun change unripe fruits?HOW FOOD BECOMES PART OF THE BODY.[Illustration: H]ERE, at last, is the bill of fare for our dinner:

          Roast beef,
          Potatoes,
          Tomatoes,
          Squash,
          Bread,
          Butter,
          Salt,
          Water,
          Peaches,
          Bananas,
          Oranges,
          Grapes.What must be done first, with the different kinds of food that are to
make up this dinner?The meat, vegetables, and bread must be cooked.Cooking prepares them to
be easily worked upon by the mouth and stomach.If they were not cooked,
this work would be very hard.Instead of going on quietly and without
letting us know any thing about it, there would be pains and aches in
the overworked stomach.The fruit is not cooked by a fire; but we might almost say the sun had
cooked it, for the sun has ripened and sweetened it.When you are older, some of you may have charge of the cooking in your
homes.You must then remember that food well cooked is worth twice as
much as food poorly cooked."A good cook has more to do with the health of the family, than a good
doctor."As soon as we begin to chew our food, a juice in the mouth, called
saliva (sa l[=i]'va), moistens and mixes with it.Saliva has the wonderful power of turning starch into sugar; and the
starch in our food needs to be turned into sugar, before it can be taken
into the blood.You can prove for yourselves that saliva can turn starch into sugar.Chew slowly a piece of dry cracker.The cracker is made mostly of
starch, because wheat is full of starch.At first, the cracker is dry
and tasteless.Soon, however, you find it tastes sweet; the saliva is
changing the starch into sugar.All your food should be eaten slowly and chewed well, so that the saliva
may be able to mix with it.Otherwise, the starch may not be changed;
and if one part of your body neglects its work, another part will have
more than its share to do.If you swallow your food in a hurry and do not let the saliva do its
work, the stomach will have extra work.But it will find it hard to do
more than its own part, and, perhaps, will complain.It can not speak in words; but will by aching, and that is almost as
plain as words.One is to the lungs, for
breathing; the other, to the stomach, for swallowing.Do you wonder why the food does not sometimes go down the wrong way?The windpipe leading to the lungs is in front of the other tube.It has
at its top a little trap-door.This opens when we breathe and shuts when
we swallow, so that the food slips over it safely into the passage
behind, which leads to the stomach.If you try to speak while you have food in your mouth, this little door
has to open, and some bit of food may slip in.The windpipe will not
pass it to the lungs, but tries to force it back.Then we say the food
chokes us.If the windpipe can not succeed in forcing back the food, the
person will die.HOW THE FOOD IS CARRIED THROUGH THE BODY.But we will suppose that the food of our dinner has gone safely down
into the stomach.There the stomach works it over, and mixes in gastric
juice, until it is all a gray fluid.Now it is ready to go into the intestines,--a long, coiled tube which
leads out of the stomach,--from which the prepared food is taken into
the blood.The heart pumps it out with the blood
into the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle,
and skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain.Besides feeding all these parts, this dinner can help to mend any parts
that may be broken.Suppose a boy should break one of the bones of his arm, how could it be
mended?If you should bind together the two parts of a broken stick and leave
them a while, do you think they would grow together?But the doctor could carefully bind together the ends of the broken bone
in the boy's arm and leave it for awhile, and the blood would bring it
bone food every day, until it had grown together again.So a dinner can both make and mend the different parts of the body.What is the first thing to do to our food?What is the first thing to do after taking the
          food into your mouth?How can you prove that saliva turns starch into
          sugar?What happens if the food is not chewed and
          mixed with the saliva?What must you be careful about, when you are
          swallowing?What happens to the food after it is
          swallowed?What carries the food to every part of the
          body?[Illustration: H]ERE are the names of some of the different kinds of
food.If you write them on the blackboard or on your slates, it will

Perhaps some of you noticed that we had no wine, beer, nor any drink
that had alcohol in it, on our bill of fare for dinner.We had no
cigars, either, to be smoked after dinner.If these are good things, we
ought to have had them._We should eat in order to grow strong and keep
          strong._


STRENGTH OF BODY.If you wanted to measure your strength, one way of doing so would be to
fasten a heavy weight to one end of a rope and pass the rope over a
pulley.Then you might take hold at the other end of the rope and pull
as hard and steadily as you could, marking the place to which you raised
the weight.By trying this once a week, or once a month, you could tell
by the marks, whether you were gaining strength.We must exercise in the open air, and take pure air into our lungs to
help purify our blood, and plenty of exercise to make our muscles grow.We must eat good and simple food, that the blood may have supplies to
take to every part of the body.People used to think that alcohol made them strong.Can alcohol make good muscles, or bone, or nerve, or brain?If it can not make muscles, nor bone nor nerve, nor brain, it can not
give you any strength.Some people may tell you that drinking beer will make you strong.The grain from which the beer is made, would have given you strength.If
you should measure your strength before and after drinking beer, you
would find that you had not gained any.Most of the food part of the
grain has been turned into alcohol.The juice of crushed apples, you know, is called cider.As soon as the
cider begins to turn sour, or "hard," as people say, alcohol begins to
form in it.Pure water is good, and apples are good.But the apple-juice begins to
be a poison as soon as there is the least drop of alcohol in it.In
cider-making, the alcohol forms in the juice, you know, in a few hours
after it is pressed out of the apples.None of the drinks in which there is alcohol, can give you real
strength.Because alcohol puts the nerves to sleep, they can not, truly, tell the
brain how hard the work is, or how heavy the weight to be lifted.The alcohol has in this way cheated men into thinking they can do more
than they really can.This false feeling of strength lasts only a little
while.When it has passed, men feel weaker than before.A story which shows that alcohol does not give strength, was told me by
the captain of a ship, who sailed to China and other distant places.Many years ago, when people thought a little alcohol was good, it was
the custom to carry in every ship, a great deal of rum.This liquor is
distilled from molasses and contains about one half alcohol.This rum
was given to the sailors every day to drink; and, if there was a great
storm, and they had very hard work to do, it was the custom to give
them twice as much rum as usual.[Illustration]

The captain watched his men and saw that they were really made no
stronger by drinking the rum; but that, after a little while, they felt
weaker.So he determined to go to sea with no rum in his ship.Once out
on the ocean, of course the men could not get any.At first, they did not like it; but the captain was very careful to have
their food good and plentiful; and, when a storm came, and they were wet
and cold and tired, he gave them hot coffee to drink.By the time they
had crossed the ocean, the men said: "The captain is right.We have
worked better, and we feel stronger, for going without the rum."We have been talking about the strength of muscles; but the very best
kind of strength we have is brain strength, or strength of mind.Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they can
not carry their messages correctly.Some people have little or no money, and no houses or lands; but every
person ought to own a body and a mind that can work for him, and make
him useful and happy.Suppose you have a strong, healthy body, hands that are well-trained to
work, and a clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole.Would you
be willing to change places with a man whose body and mind had been
poisoned by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though he lived in a
palace, and had a million of dollars?If you want a mind that can study, understand, and think well, do not
let alcohol and tobacco have a chance to reach it.What things were left out of our bill of fare?Show why drinking wine or any other alcoholic
          drink will not make you strong.Why do people imagine that they feel strong
          after taking these drinks?Tell the story which shows that alcohol does
          not help sailors do their work.What is the best kind of strength to have?How does alcohol affect the strength of the
          mind?[Illustration: T]HE heart is in the chest, the upper part of the strong
box which the ribs, spine, shoulder-blades, and collar-bones make for
each of us.It is made of very thick, strong muscles, as you can see by looking at a
beef's heart, which is much like a man's, but larger.Probably some of you have seen a fire-engine throwing a stream of water
through a hose upon a burning building.As the engine forces the water through the hose, so the heart, by the
working of its strong muscles, pumps the blood through tubes, shaped
like hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the
body.These tubes are called arteries (aer't[)e]r iz).Those tubes which bring the blood back again to the heart, are called
veins (v[=a]nz).You can see some of the smaller veins in your wrist.If you press your finger upon an artery in your wrist, you can feel the
steady beating of the pulse.This tells just how fast the heart is
pumping and the blood flowing.The doctor feels your pulse when you are sick, to find out whether the
heart is working too fast, or too slowly, or just right.Some way is needed to send the gray fluid that is made from the food we
eat and drink, to every part of the body.To send the food with the blood is a sure way of making it reach every
part.So, when the stomach has prepared the food, the blood takes it up and
carries it to every part of the body.It then leaves with each part,
just what it needs.As the brain has so much work to attend to, it must have very pure, good
blood sent to it, to keep it strong.It can not be good if it has been poisoned with alcohol or tobacco.We must also remember that the brain needs a great deal of blood.If we
take alcohol into our blood, much of it goes to the brain.There it
affects the nerves, and makes a man lose control over his actions.When you run, you can feel your heart beating.It gets an instant of
rest between the beats.Good exercise in the fresh air makes the heart work well and warms the
body better than a fire could do.DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE HEART?You know what harm alcohol does to the
muscles.Could a fatty heart work as well as a muscular heart?No more than a
fatty arm could do the work of a muscular arm.Besides, alcohol makes
the heart beat too fast, and so it gets too tired.How does the food we eat reach all parts of the
          body?How does alcohol in the blood affect the brain?How does exercise in the fresh air help the
          heart?[Illustration: T]HE blood flows all through the body, carrying good food
to every part.It also gathers up from every part the worn-out matter
that can no longer be used.By the time it is ready to be sent back by
the veins, the blood is no longer pure and red.It is dull and bluish in
color, because it is full of impurities.If you look at the veins in your wrist, you will see that they look
blue.If all this bad blood goes back to the heart, will the heart have to
pump out bad blood next time?No, for the heart has neighbors very near
at hand, ready to change the bad blood to pure, red blood again.They are in the chest on each side of
the heart.When you breathe, their little air-cells swell out, or
expand, to take in the air.Then they contract again, and the air passes
out through your mouth or nose.The lungs must have plenty of fresh air,
and plenty of room to work in.[Illustration: _The lungs, heart, and air-passages._]

If your clothes are too tight and the lungs do not have room to expand,
they can not take in so much air as they should.Then the blood can not
be made pure, and the whole body will suffer.For every good breath of fresh air, the lungs take in, they send out one
of impure air.In this way, by taking out what is bad, they prepare the blood to go
back to the heart pure and red, and to be pumped out through the body
again.How the lungs can use the fresh air for doing this good work, you can
not yet understand.By and by, when you are older, you will learn more
about it.You never stop breathing, not even in the night.But if you watch your
own breathing you will notice a little pause between the breaths.But the lungs are very steady workers, both by night
and by day.The least we can do for them, is to give them fresh air and
plenty of room to work in.You may say: "We can't give them more room than they have.I have seen people who wore such tight clothes that their lungs did not
have room to take a full breath.If any part of the lungs can not
expand, it will become useless.If your lungs can not take in air enough
to purify the blood, you can not be so well and strong as God intended,
and your life will be shortened.If some one was sewing for you, you would not think of shutting her up
in a little place where she could not move her hands freely.The lungs
are breathing for you, and need room enough to do their work.The lungs breathe out the waste matter that they have taken from the
blood.If we should close all the
doors and windows, and the fireplace or opening into the chimney, and
leave not even a crack by which the fresh air could come in, we would
die simply from staying in such a room.The lungs could not do their
work for the blood, and the blood could not do its work for the body.If your head
aches, and you feel dull and sleepy from being in a close room, a run in
the fresh air will make you feel better.The good, pure air makes your blood pure; and the blood then flows
quickly through your whole body and refreshes every part.We must be careful not to stay in close rooms in the day-time, nor sleep
in close rooms at night.We must not keep out the fresh air that our
bodies so much need.It is better to breathe through the nose than through the mouth.You can
soon learn to do so, if you try to keep your mouth shut when walking or
running.If you keep the mouth shut and breathe through the nose, the little
hairs on the inside of the nose will catch the dust or other impurities
that are floating in the air, and so save their going to the lungs.You
will get out of breath less quickly when running if you keep your mouth
shut.DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE LUNGS?The little air-cells of the lungs have very delicate muscular (m[)u]s'ku
lar) walls.Every time we breathe, these walls have to move.The muscles
of the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you
breathe.All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is
directed by the nerves.You have learned already what alcohol will do to muscles and nerves, so
you are ready to answer for stomach, for heart, and for lungs.Besides carrying food all over the body, what
          other work does the blood do?Why does the blood in the veins look blue?Where is the blood made pure and red again?What must the lungs have in order to do this
          work?How does the air in a room become spoiled?Why is it better to breathe through the nose
          than through the mouth?[Illustration: T]HERE is another part of your body carrying away waste
matter all the time--it is the skin.It is also lined with a more delicate
kind of skin.You can see where the outside skin and the lining skin
meet at your lips.There is a thin outside layer of skin which we can pull off without
hurting ourselves; but I advise you not to do so.Because under the
outside skin is the true skin, which is so full of little nerves that it
will feel the least touch as pain.When the outer skin, which protects
it, is torn away, we must cover the true skin to keep it from harm.In hot weather, or when any one has been working or playing hard, the
face, and sometimes the whole body, is covered with little drops of
water.We call these drops perspiration (p[~e]r sp[)i] r[=a]'sh[)u]n).[Illustration: _Perspiratory tube._]

Where does it come from?It comes through many tiny holes in the skin,
called pores (p[=o]rz).Every pore is the mouth of a tiny tube which is
carrying off waste matter and water from your body.If you could piece
together all these little perspiration tubes that are in the skin of one
person, they would make a line more than three miles long.Sometimes, you can not see the perspiration, because there is not enough
of it to form drops.But it is always coming out through your skin, both
in winter and summer.Your body is kept healthy by having its worn-out
matter carried off in this way, as well as in other ways.The finger nails are little shields to protect the ends of your fingers
from getting hurt.These finger ends are full of tiny nerves, and would
be badly off without such shields.No one likes to see nails that have
been bitten.Waste matter is all the time passing out through the perspiration tubes
in the skin.This waste matter must not be left to clog up the little
openings of the tubes.It should be washed off with soap and water.When children have been playing out-of-doors, they often have very dirty
hands and faces.Any one can see, then, that they need to be washed.But
even if they had been in the cleanest place all day and had not touched
any thing dirty, they would still need the washing; for the waste matter
that comes from the inside of the body is just as hurtful as the mud or
dust of the street.You do not see it so plainly, because it comes out
very little at a time.Wash it off well, and your skin will be fresh and
healthy, and able to do its work.If the skin could not do its work, you
would die.Do not keep on your rubber boots or shoes all through school-time.Rubber will not let the perspiration pass off, so the little pores get
clogged and your feet begin to feel uncomfortable, or your head may
ache.No part can fail to do its work without causing trouble to the
rest of the body.But you should always wear rubbers out-of-doors when
the ground is wet.When you are out in the fresh air, you are giving the other parts of
your body such a good chance to perspire, that your feet can bear a
little shutting up.But as soon as you come into the house, take the
rubbers off.Now that you know what the skin is doing all the time, you will
understand that the clothes worn next to your skin are full of little
worn-out particles, brought out by the perspiration.When these clothes
are taken off at night, they should be so spread out, that they will
air well before morning.Never wear any of the clothes through the
night, that you have worn during the day.Do not roll up your night-dress in the morning and put it under your
pillow.Give it first a good airing at the window and then hang it where
the air can reach it all day.By so doing, you will have sweeter sleep
at night.You are old enough to throw the bed-clothes off from the bed, before
leaving your rooms in the morning.In this way, the bed and bed-clothes
may have a good airing.Be sure to give them time enough for this.You have now learned about four important kinds of work:--

1st.The stomach prepares the food for the blood to take.The blood is pumped out of the heart to carry food to every part of
the body, and to take away worn-out matter.The lungs use fresh air in making the dark, impure blood, bright and
pure again.The skin carries away waste matter through the little perspiration
tubes.All this work goes on, day and night, without our needing to think about
it at all; for messages are sent to the muscles by the nerves which keep
them faithfully at work, whether we know it or not.What is the common name
          for it?How does the perspiration help to keep you
          well?Why should you not wear rubber boots or
          overshoes in the house?Why should you change under-clothing night and
          morning?Where should the night-dress be placed in the
          morning?What should be done with the bed-clothes?Name the four kinds of work about which you
          have learned.How are the organs of the body kept at work?[Illustration: W]E have five ways of learning about all things around
us.We can see them, touch them, taste them, smell them, or hear them.Sight, touch, taste, smell, and hearing, are called the five senses.You already know something about them, for you are using them all the
time.In this lesson, you will learn a little more about seeing and hearing.In the middle of your eye is a round, black spot, called the pupil.This
pupil is only a hole with a muscle around it.When you are in the light,
the muscle draws up, and makes the pupil small, because you can get all
the light you need through a small opening.When you are in the dark,
the muscle stretches, and opens the pupil wide to let in more light.The pupils of the cat's eyes are very large in the dark.They want all
the light they can get, to see if there are any mice about.[Illustration: _The eyelashes and the tear-glands._]

The pupil of the eye opens into a little, round room where the nerve of
sight is.This is a safe place for this delicate nerve, which can not
bear too much light.It carries to the brain an account of every thing
we see.We might say the eye is taking pictures for us all day long, and that
the nerve of sight is describing these pictures to the brain.The nerves of sight need great care, for they are very delicate.Do not face a bright light when you are reading or studying.While
writing, you should sit so that the light will come from the left side;
then the shadow of your hand will not fall upon your work.One or two true stories may help you to remember that you must take good
care of your eyes.The nerve of sight can not bear too bright a light.It asks to have the
pupil made small, and even the eyelid curtains put down, when the light
is too strong.Once, there was a boy who said boastfully to his playmates: "Let us see
which of us can look straight at the sun for the longest time."Then they foolishly began to look at the sun.The delicate nerves of
sight felt a sharp pain, and begged to have the pupils made as small as
possible and the eyelid curtains put down.They were trying to see which would bear
it the longest.Great harm was done to the brains as well as eyes of
both these boys.The one who looked longest at the sun died in
consequence of his foolish act.The second story is about a little boy who tried to turn his eyes to
imitate a schoolmate who was cross-eyed.He turned them; but he could
not turn them back again.Although he is now a gentleman more than fifty
years old and has had much painful work done upon his eyes, the doctors
have never been able to set them quite right.You see from the first story, that you must be careful not to give your
eyes too much light.But you must also be sure to give them light
enough.When one tries to read in the twilight, the little nerve of sight says:
"Give me more light; I am hurt, by trying to see in the dark."If you should kill these delicate nerves, no others would ever grow in
place of them, and you would never be able to see again.What you call your ears are only pieces of gristle, so curved as to
catch the sounds and pass them along to the true ears.These are deeper
in the head, where the nerve of hearing is waiting to send an account
of each sound to the brain.The ear nerve is in less danger than that of the eye.Careless children
sometimes put pins into their ears and so break the "drum."That is a
very bad thing to do.Use only a soft towel in washing your ears.You
should never put any thing hard or sharp into them.I must tell you a short ear story, about my father, when he was a small
boy.One day, when playing on the floor, he laid his ear to the crack of the
door, to feel the wind blow into it.He was so young that he did not
know it was wrong; but the next day he had the earache severely.Although he lived to be an old man, he often had the earache.He thought
it began from the time when the wind blew into his ear from under that
door.ALCOHOL AND THE SENSES.All this fine work of touching, tasting, seeing, smelling, and hearing,
is nerve work.The man who is in the habit of using alcoholic drinks can not touch,
taste, see, smell, or hear so well as he ought.His hands tremble, his
speech is sometimes thick, and often he can not walk straight.Sometimes, he thinks he sees things when he does not, because his poor
nerves are so confused by alcohol that they can not do their work.Answer now for your taste, smell, and touch, and also for your sight and
hearing; should their beautiful work be spoiled by alcohol?Where should the light be for reading or
          studying?Tell the story of the boys who looked at the
          sun.Tell the story of the boy who made himself
          cross-eyed.What would be the result, if you should kill
          the nerves of sight?Tell the story of the boy who injured his ear.How is the work of the senses affected by
          drinking liquor?"[Illustration: M]Y thick, warm clothes make me warm," says some child.Take a brisk run, and your blood will flow faster and you will be warm
very quickly.On a cold day, the teamster claps his hands and swings his arms to make
his blood flow quickly and warm him.Every child knows that he is warm inside; for if his fingers are cold,
he puts them into his mouth to warm them.If you should put a little thermometer into your mouth, or under your
tongue, the mercury (m[~e]r'ku r[)y]) would rise as high as it does out
of doors on a hot, summer day.This would be the same in summer or winter, in a warm country or a cold
one, if you were well and the work of your body was going on steadily.Some of the work which is all the time going on inside your body, makes
this heat.The blood is thus warmed, and then it carries the heat to every part of
the body.The faster the blood flows, the more heat it brings, and the
warmer we feel.In children, the heart pumps from eighty to ninety times a minute.This is faster than it works in old people, and this is one reason why
children are generally much warmer than old people.You may breathe in cold air; but that which you breathe out is warm.A
great deal of heat from your warm body is all the time passing off
through your skin, into the cooler air about you.For this reason, a
room full of people is much warmer than the same room when empty.We put on clothes to keep in the heat which we already have, and to
prevent the cold air from reaching our skins and carrying off too much
heat in that way.Most of you children are too young to choose what clothes you will wear.You know, however, that woolen under-garments
keep you warm in winter, and that thick boots and stockings should be
worn in cold weather.Thin dresses or boots may look pretty; but they
are not safe for winter wear, even at a party.A healthy, happy child, dressed in clothes which are suitable for the
season, is pleasanter to look at than one whose dress, though rich and
handsome, is not warm enough for health or comfort.When you feel cold, take exercise, if possible.This will make the hot
blood flow all through your body and warm it.If you can not, you should
put on more clothes, go to a warm room, in some way get warm and keep
warm, or the cold will make you sick.If your skin is chilled, the tiny mouths of the perspiration tubes are
sometimes closed and can not throw out the waste matter.Then, if one
part fails to do its work, other parts must suffer.Perhaps the inside
skin becomes inflamed, or the throat and lungs, and you have a cold, or
a cough.People used to think that nothing would warm one so well on a cold day,
as a glass of whiskey, or other alcoholic drink.It is true that, if a person drinks a little alcohol, he will feel a
burning in the throat, and presently a glowing heat on the skin.The alcohol has made the hot blood rush into the tiny tubes near the
skin, and he thinks it has warmed him.But if all this heat comes to the skin, the cold air has a chance to
carry away more than usual.In a very little time, the drinker will be
colder than before.Perhaps he will not know it; for the cheating
alcohol will have deadened his nerves so that they send no message to
the brain.Then he may not have sense enough to put on more clothing and
may freeze.He may even, if it is very cold, freeze to death.People, who have not been drinking alcohol are sometimes frozen; but
they would have frozen much quicker if they had drunk it.Horse-car drivers and omnibus drivers have a hard time on a cold winter
day.They are often cheated into thinking that alcohol will keep them
warm; but doctors have learned that it is the water-drinkers who hold
out best against the cold.Alcohol can not really keep a person warm.All children are interested in stories about Arctic explorers, whose
ships get frozen into great ice-fields, who travel on sledges drawn by
dogs, and sometimes live in Esquimau huts, and drink oil, and eat walrus
meat.These men tell us that alcohol will not keep them warm, and you know
why.Daniel went to the hallway.The hunters and trappers in the snowy regions of the Rocky Mountains say
the same thing.Alcohol not only can not keep them warm; but it lessens
their power to resist cold.[Illustration: _Scene in the Arctic regions._]

Many of you have heard about the Greely party who were brought home from
the Arctic seas, after they had been starving and freezing for many
months.Seven were
found alive by their rescuers; one of these died soon afterward.The
first man who died, was the only one of the party who had ever been a
drunkard.Of the nineteen who died, all but one used tobacco.Of the six now
living,--four never used tobacco at all; and the other two, very seldom.The tobacco was no real help to them in time of trouble.It had probably
weakened their stomachs, so that they could not make the best use of
such poor food as they had.Why do you wear thick clothes in cold weather?How can you prove that you are warm inside?How can you warm yourself without going to the
          fire?How does it cheat you into thinking that you
          will be warmer for drinking it?What do the people who travel in very cold
          countries, tell us about the use of alcohol?How did tobacco affect the men who went to the
          Arctic seas with Lieutenant Greely?[Illustration: N]OW that you have learned about your bodies, and what
alcohol will do to them, you ought also to know that alcohol costs a
great deal of money.Money spent for that which will do no good, but
only harm, is certainly wasted, and worse than wasted.If a boy or a girl save ten cents a week, it will take ten weeks to save
a dollar.You can all think of many good and pleasant ways to spend a dollar.What
would the beer-drinker do with it?If he takes two mugs of beer a day,
the dollar will be used up in ten days.But we ought not to say used,
because that word will make us think it was spent usefully.We will say,
instead, the dollar will be wasted, in ten days.If he spends it for wine or whiskey, it will go sooner, as these cost
more.If no money was spent for liquor in this country, people would not
so often be sick, or poor, or bad, or wretched.We should not need so
many policemen, and jails, and prisons, as we have now.If no liquor was
drunk, men, women, and children would be better and happier.Most of you have a little money of your own.Perhaps you earned a part,
or the whole of it, yourselves.You are planning what to do with it, and
that is a very pleasant kind of planning.Do you think it would be wise to make a dollar bill into a tight little
roll, light one end of it with a match, and then let it slowly burn up?(_See Frontispiece._)

Yes!It would be worse than wasted,
if, while burning, it should also hurt the person who held it.If you
should buy cigars or tobacco with your dollar, and smoke them, you could
soon burn up the dollar and hurt yourselves besides.Then, when you begin to have some idea how much six
hundred millions is, remember that six hundred million dollars are spent
in this country every year for tobacco--burned up--wasted--worse than
wasted.Do you think the farmer who planted tobacco instead of corn, did any
good to the world by the change?How does the liquor-drinker spend his money?What could we do, if no money was spent for
          liquor?Tell two ways in which you could burn up a
          dollar bill.How much money is spent for tobacco, yearly, in
          this country?*       *       *       *       *

Obvious punctuation errors repaired.The impression left on my mind
was--ah--unfavourable; a certain talent, no doubt, some felicity of
expression, but a noticeable lack of the--ah--reticence, the discipline,
the--the scholarly touch which a training at one of our great Public
Schools (I forbear to particularise), and at a University, can alone
impart.I was also pained to observe a crude discontent with the
existing Social System--a system which, if not absolutely perfect,
cannot be upset or even modified without the gravest danger.But I was
still more distressed to note in several passages a decided taint of the
morbid sensuousness which renders so much of our modern literature
sickly and unwholesome._Lady Cant._ All prejudice, my dear Bishop; why, you haven't even _read_
the book!However, the author is staying here now, and I feel convinced
that if you only knew him, you'd alter your opinion.Such an unassuming,
inoffensive creature!I'll call him over
here.... Goodness, why does he shuffle along in that way!_Spurrell_ (_meeting_ Sir RUPERT).Hope I've kept nobody waiting for
_me_, Sir RUPERT.(_Confidentially._) I'd rather a job to get these
things on; but they're really a wonderful fit, considering![_He passes on, leaving his host speechless._

_Lady Cant._ That's right, Mr.Come here, and let me present
you to the Bishop of BIRCHESTER.The Bishop has just been telling me he
considers your _Andromeda_ sickly, or unhealthy, or something.I'm sure
you'll be able to convince him it's nothing of the sort.[_She leaves him with the_ Bishop, _who is visibly annoyed._

_Spurr._ (_to himself, overawed_).Wish I knew the right way to
talk to a Bishop.Can't call _him_ nothing--so doosid familiar.(_Aloud._) _Andromeda_ sickly, your--(_tentatively_)--your Right
Reverence?Not a bit of it--sound as a roach!_The Bishop._ If I had thought my--ah--criticisms were to be repeated--I
might say misrepresented, as the Countess has thought proper to do, Mr.SPURRELL, I should not have ventured to make them.At the same time, you
must be conscious yourself, I think, of certain blemishes which would
justify the terms I employed._Spurr._ I never saw any in _Andromeda_ myself, your--your Holiness.You're the first to find a fault in her.I don't say there mayn't be
something dicky about the setting and the turn of the tail, but that's a
trifle._The Bishop._ I did not refer to the setting of the tale, and the
portions I object to are scarcely trifles.But pardon me if I prefer to
end a discussion that is somewhat unprofitable.(_To himself, as he
turns on his heel._) A most arrogant, self-satisfied, and conceited
young man--a truly lamentable product of this half-educated age!_Spurr._ (_to himself_).Well, he may be a dab at dogmas--he don't know
much about dogs._Drummy_'s got a constitution worth a dozen of _his_!_Lady Culv._ (_approaching him_).SPURRELL, Lord LULLINGTON
wishes to know you.(_To herself, as she leads
him up to_ Lord L.)I do _wish_ ROHESIA wouldn't force me to do this
sort of thing![_She presents him._

_Lord Lullington_ (_to himself_).I suppose I _ought_ to know all
about his novel, or whatever it is he's done.(_Aloud, with
courtliness._) Very pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr.SPURRELL;
you've--ah--delighted the world by your _Andromeda_.When are we to look
for your next production?_Spurr._ (_to himself_).Never met such a doggy
lot in my life!(_Aloud._) Er--well, my lord, I've promised so many as
it is, that I hardly see my way to----

_Lord Lull._ (_paternally_).Take my advice, my dear young man, leave
yourself as free as possible.Expect you to give us your best, you know.[_He turns to continue a conversation._

_Spurr._ (_to himself_).He won't get it under a five-pound
note, I can tell him.(_He makes his way to_ Miss SPELWANE.)I say, what
do you think the old Bishop's been up to?Pitching into _Andromeda_ like
the very dooce--says she's _sickly_!_Miss Spelwane_ (_to herself_).He brings his literary disappointments
to _me_, not MAISIE!(_Aloud, with the sweetest sympathy._) How
dreadfully unjust!Oh, I've dropped my fan--no, pray don't trouble; I
can pick it up.My arms are so long, you know--like a kangaroo's--no,
what _is_ that animal which has such long arms?You're so clever, you
_ought_ to know!_Spurr._ I suppose you mean a gorilla?_Miss Spelw._ How crushing of you!But you must go away now, or else
you'll find nothing to say to me at dinner--you take me in, you know.I feel----But if I told you, I might make you
too conceited!_Spurr._ Oh, no, you wouldn't.[Sir RUPERT _approaches with_ Mr._Sir Rupert._ VIVIEN, my dear, let me introduce Mr.SHORTHORN--Miss
SPELWANE.Let me see--ha--yes, you take in Mrs.Come this way, and I'll find her for you.[_He marches_ SPURRELL _off._

_Mr.Shorthorn_ (_to_ Miss SPELWANE).Good thing getting this rain at
last; a little more of this dry weather and we should have had no grass
to speak of!_Miss Spelw._ (_who has not quite recovered from her disappointment_).And now you _will_ have some grass to speak of?_Spurr._ (_as dinner is announced, to_ Lady MAISIE).I say, Lady MAISIE,
I've just been told I've got to take in a married lady.I don't know
what to talk to her about.I should feel a lot more at home with you._Lady Maisie_ (_to herself_).What a fearful suggestion--but I simply
_daren't_ snub him!(_Aloud._) I'm afraid, Mr.SPURRELL, we must both
put up with the partners we have; most distressing, isn't it--_but_![_She gives a little shrug._

_Captain Thicknesse_ (_immediately behind her, to himself_).Gad,
_that_'s pleasant!I knew I'd better have gone to Aldershot!(_Aloud._)
I've been told off to take you in, Lady MAISIE, not _my_ fault, don't
you know._Lady Maisie._ There's no need to be so apologetic about it.(_To
herself._) Oh, I _hope_ he didn't hear what I said to that wretch.Thick._ Well, I rather thought there _might_ be, perhaps._Lady Maisie_ (_to herself_).If he's going to be so
stupid as to misunderstand, I'm sure _I_ shan't explain.[_They take their place in the procession to the Dining Hall._

RATIONAL DRESS.(_A Reformer's Note to a Current Controversy._)

  OH, ungallant must be the man indeed
  Who calls "nine women out of ten" "knock-kneed"!And he should not remain in peace for long,
  Who says "the nether limbs of women" are "all wrong."Such are the arguments designed to prove
  That Woman's ill-advised to make a move
  To mannish clothes.These arguments are such
  As to be of the kind that prove too much.If Woman's limbs in truth unshapely grow,

IN THREE VOLUMES.VOLUME I.--_Awakening._

AND so the work was done.BELINDA, after a year's hard writing, had
completed her self-appointed task._Douglas the Doomed One_ had grown by
degrees into its present proportions.First the initial volume was
completed; then the second was finished; and now the third was ready for
the printer's hands.BELINDA knew no publishers and had no influence.How could she get
anyone to take the novel up?And yet, if she was to believe the
_Author_, there was plenty of room for untried talent.According to that
interesting periodical publishers were constantly on the lookout for
undiscovered genius.Why should she not try the firm of Messrs.She set her face hard, and muttered,
"Yes, they _shall_ do it!_Douglas the Doomed One_ shall appear with the
assistance of Messrs.And when BELINDA made up her
mind to do anything, not wild omnibus-horses would turn her from her
purpose.[Illustration]

VOLUME II.--_Wide Awake._

Messrs.BINDING AND PRINT had received their visitor with courtesy.They
did not require to read _Douglas the Doomed One_.They had discovered
that it was sufficiently long to make the regulation three volumes.They would be happy to
publish it."When we have paid for the outlay we shall divide the residue," cried
Mr."And do you think I shall soon get a cheque?""Well, that is a question not easy to answer.You see, we usually spend
any money we make in advertising.It does the work good in the long run,
although at first it rather checks the profits."BELINDA was satisfied, and took her departure."We must advertise _Douglas the Doomed One_ in the _Skatemaker's
Quarterly Magazine_," said Mr."And in the _Crossing Sweeper's Annual_," replied Mr.Then the
two partners smiled at one another knowingly.They laughed as they
remembered that of both the periodicals they had mentioned they were the
proprietors.VOLUME III.--_Fast Asleep._

The poor patient at Slocum-on-Slush moaned.He had been practically
awake for a month, and nothing could send him to sleep.The Doctor held
his wrist, and as he felt the rapid beats of his pulse became graver and
graver."And you have no friends, no relatives?"My only visitor was the man who brought that box of books from a
metropolitan library.""There may yet be time to save
his life!"The man of science rose abruptly, and approaching the casket containing
the current literature of the day, roughly forced it open.He turned over the volumes impatiently until he
reached a set."If I can but get him to read this he
will be saved."Then turning to his patient he continued, "You should
peruse this novel.It is one that I recommend in cases such as yours.""I am afraid I am past reading," returned the invalid."However, I will
do my best."An hour later the Doctor (who had had to make some calls) returned and
found that his patient was sleeping peacefully.The first volume of
_Douglas the Doomed One_ had the desired result."Excellent, excellent," murmured the medico."It had the same effect
upon another of my patients.Insomnia has been conquered for the second time by
_Douglas the Doomed One_, and who now shall say that the three-volume
novel of the amateur is not a means of spreading civilisation?It must
be a mine of wealth to somebody."BINDING AND PRINT, had they heard the Doctor's remark,
would have agreed with him!*       *       *       *       *

All the Difference."THE SPEAKER then called Mr.Quite right in our wise and most vigilant warder.Oh that, without fuss,
  The SPEAKER could only call Order to us!*       *       *       *       *

    the salaries of the officers of the House of Lords.... If there is
    to be a contest between the House of Lords and the House of Commons,
    let us take it upon higher ground than this."--_Sir William
    Harcourt._]

  There was a little urchin, and he had an old horse-pistol,
    Which he rammed with powder damp and shots of lead, lead, lead;
  And he cried "I know not fear!For this little cove was slightly off his head, head, head.This ambitious little lad was a Paddy and a Rad,
    And himself he rather fancied as a shot, shot, shot;
  And he held the rules of sport, and close season, and, in short,
    The "regulation rubbish" was all rot, rot, rot.He held a "bird" a thing to be potted on the wing,
    Or perched upon a hedge, or up a tree, tree, tree;
  And, says he, "If a foine stag I can add to my small bag,
    A pistol _or_ a Maxim will suit me, me, me!"And so upon all fours he would crawl about the moors,
    To the detriment of elbows, knees, and slack, slack, slack;
  And he says, "What use a-talking?If I choose to call this'stalking,'
    And _I bag my game_, who's going to hould me back, back, back?"Says he, "I scoff at raisons, and stale talk of toimes and saisons;
    I'm game to shoot a fox, or spear a stag, stag, stag;
  Nay, I'd net, or club, a salmon; your old rules of sport are gammon,
    For wid me it's just a question of the bag, bag, bag!"There are omadhauns, I know, who would let a foine buck go
    Just bekase 'twas out of toime, or they'd no gun, gun, gun;
  But if oi can hit, and hurt, wid a pistol--or a squirt--
    By jabers, it is all the betther fun, fun, fun!"So he scurryfunged around with his stomach on the ground
    (For stalking seems of crawling a mere branch, branch, branch).And he spied "a stag of ten," and he cried, "Hurroo!Now then,
    I fancy I can hit _him_--in the haunch, haunch haunch!I'll bag that foine Stag Royal, or at any rate oi'll troy all
    The devoices of a sportshman from the Oisle, Oisle, Oisle.One who's used to shoot asprawl from behoind a hedge or wall,
    At the risks of rock and heather well may smoile, smoile, smoile!"But our sportsman bold, though silly, by a stalwart Highland gillie,
    Was right suddenly arrested ere he fired, fired, fired.--
  "Hoots!If you'll excuse the hint, that old thing, with lock of flint,
    As a weapon for _this_ sport can't be admired, mired, mired!"It will not bring down _that_ quarry, your horse-pistol!Don't _you_
        worry!That Royal Stag _we_'ll stalk, boy, in good time, time, time;
  But to pop at it just now, and kick up an awful row,
    Scare, and _miss_ it were a folly, nay a crime, crime, crime!"Be you sure 'Our Party' will this fine quarry track and kill;
    Our guns need not your poor toy blunderbuss, buss, buss.This is not the time or place for a-following up this chase;
    So just clear out and leave this game to us, us, us!"*       *       *       *       *

"AUXILIARY ASSISTANCE" IN THE PROVINCES.(_A Tragedy-Farce in several painful Scenes, with many unpleasant
Situations._)

LOCALITY--_The Interior of Country Place taken for the Shooting Season.Preparations for a feast in all directions.It is Six o' Clock, and the
household are eagerly waiting the appearance of_ MONTAGU MARMADUKE, the
Auxiliary Butler, _sent in by Contract.Enter_ MONTAGU MARMADUKE, _in
comic evening dress._

_Master_ (_looking at_ MONTAGU _with an expression of disappointment on
his face_).What, are _you_ the man they have sent me?And I answers to MONTAGU MARMADUKE, or some gentlemen
prefers to call me by my real name BINKS._Master._ Oh, MONTAGU will do._Mon._ Which I was in service, Sir, with Sir BARNABY JINKS, for
twenty-six years, and----

_Master._ Very well, I daresay you will do.I've been a teetotaler ever since I left Sir
BARNABY'S.And mind, do not murder the names of the guests.[_Exit._

    attracted so much attention, is waited upon by_ NISBET.When I was with Sir BARNABY----

"You really must join the Army," said the stern old Puritan to the Lord
Protector."The fate of this fair realm of England depends upon the
promptness with which you assume command."He had laid aside his buff doublet, and had
donned a coat of a thinner material.His sword also was gone, and
hanging by his side was a pair of double spy-glasses--new in those
days--new in very deed."I cannot go," cried the Lord Protector at last, "it would be too great
a sacrifice.""You said not that," pursued IRETON--for it was he--"when you called
upon CHARLES to lose his head.""But in this case, good sooth, I would wish a head to be won, or the
victory to be by a head;" and then the Uncrowned King laughed long and
heartily, as was his wont when some jest tickled him."This is no matter for merriment," exclaimed IRETON sternly."OLIVER,
you are playing the fool.You are sacrificing for pleasure, business,
duty.""Well, I cannot help it," was the response."But mind you, IRETON, it
shall be the last time.""What is it that attracts you so strongly?What is the pleasure that
lures you away from the path of duty?""I will tell you, and then you will pity, perchance forgive me.To-day

SITTING ON OUR SENATE.SIR,--It struck me that the best and simplest way of finding out what
were the intentions of the Government with regard to the veto of the
Peers was to write and ask each individual Member his opinion on the
subject.Accordingly I have done so, and it seems to me that there is a
vast amount of significance in the nature of the replies I have
received, to anyone capable of reading between the lines; or, as most of
the communications only extended to a single line, let us say to anyone
capable of reading beyond the full-stop.Lord ROSEBERY'S Secretary, for
example, writes that "the Prime Minister is at present out of town"--_at
present_, you see, but obviously on the point of coming back, in order
to grapple with my letter and the question generally.Sir WILLIAM
HARCOURT, his Secretary, writes, "is at Wiesbaden, but upon his return
your communication will no doubt receive his attention"--_receive his
attention_, an ominous phrase for the Peers, who seem hardly to realise
that between them and ruin there is only the distance from Wiesbaden to
Downing Street.MORLEY "sees no reason to alter his published
opinion on the subject"--_alter_, how readily, by the prefixing of a
single letter, that word becomes _halter_!I was unable to effect
personal service of my letter on the ATTORNEY-GENERAL, possibly because
I called at his chambers during the Long Vacation; but the fact that a
card should have been attached to his door bearing the words "Back at 2
P.M."surely indicates that Sir JOHN RIGBY will _back up_ his leaders in
any approaching attack on the fortress of feudalism!Then surely the
circumstance that the other Ministers to whom my letters were addressed
_have not as yet sent any answer_ shows how seriously they regard the
situation, and how disinclined they are to commit themselves to a too
hasty reply!In fact, the outlook for the House of Lords, judging from
these Ministerial communications, is decidedly gloomy, and I am inclined
to think that an Autumn Session devoted to abolishing it is a most
probable eventuality.Yours,

  FUSSY-CUSS EXSPECTANS.SIR,--The real way of dealing with the Lords is as follows.The next
time that they want to meet, cut off their gas and water!Tell the
butcher and baker _not_ to call at the House for orders, and dismiss the
charwomen who dust their bloated benches.If _this_ doesn't bring them
to reason, nothing will.HIGH-MINDED DEMOCRAT.*       *       *       *       *

public.I am surprised that a nobleman like Lord RAYLEIGH should even
attempt to make such a thoroughly useless, and, indeed, revolutionary
discovery.It is enough to turn anyone into a democrat at once.And what
was Lord SALISBURY, as a Conservative, doing, in allowing such a subject
to be mooted at Oxford?Why did he not at once turn the new gas off at
the meter?*       *       *       *       *

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.[Illustration]

From HENRY SOTHERAN & CO.(so a worthy Baronite reports) comes a second
edition of _Game Birds and Shooting Sketches_, by JOHN GUILLE MILLAIS.Every sportsman who is something more than a mere bird-killer ought to
buy this beautiful book.MILLAIS' drawings are wonderfully delicate,
and, so far as I can judge, remarkably accurate.He has a fine touch for
plumage, and renders with extraordinary success the bold and resolute
bearing of the British game-bird in the privacy of his own peculiar
haunts.I am glad the public have shown themselves sufficiently
appreciative to warrant Mr.MILLAIS in putting forth a second edition of
a book which is the beautiful and artistic result of very many days of
patient and careful observation.By the way, there is an illustration of
a Blackcock Tournament, which is, for knock-about primitive humour, as
good as a pantomime rally.Are we in future to
spell Capercailzie with an extra l in place of the z, as Mr.Surely it is rather wanton thus to annihilate the pride of
the sportsman who knew what was what, and who never pronounced the z. If
you take away the z you take away all merit from him.MILLAIS will consider the matter in his third edition.*       *       *       *       *

WET-WILLOW.A SONG OF A SLOPPY SEASON.(_By a Washed-Out Willow-Wielder._)

AIR--"_Titwillow._"

  In the dull, damp pavilion a popular "Bat"
    Sang "Willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"great slogger, pray what are you at,
    Singing 'Willow, wet-willow, wet-willow'?Is it lowness of average, batsman," I cried;
  "Or a bad 'brace of ducks' that has lowered your pride?"With a low-muttered swear-word or two he replied,
    "Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"He said "In the mud one can't score, anyhow,
    Singing willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!The people are raising a deuce of a row,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!I've been waiting all day in these flannels--they're damp!--
  The spectators impatiently shout, shriek, and stamp,
  But a batsman, you see, cannot play with a Gamp,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"Now I feel just as sure as I am that my name
    Isn't willow, wet-willow, wet-willow,
  The people will swear that I don't play the game,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!My spirits are low and my scores are not high,
  But day after day we've soaked turf and grey sky,
  And I shan't have a chance till the wickets get dry,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!!!"*       *       *       *       *

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P._House of Commons, Monday, August 20._--ASHMEAD-BARTLETT (Knight) is the
CASABIANCA of Front Opposition Bench.Now his
opportunity; will show jealous colleagues, watchful House, and
interested country, how a party should be led.Had an innings on
Saturday, when, in favourite character of Dompter of British and other
Lions, he worried Under Secretaries for Foreign Affairs and the
Colonies.In fact what happened seems to
confirm quaint theory SARK advances.Says he believes those two astute young men, EDWARD GREY and SYDNEY
BUXTON, "control" the Sheffield Knight.Moreover, things are managed so well both at
Foreign Office and Colonial Office that they have no opportunity of
distinguishing themselves.The regular representatives on the Front
Opposition Bench of Foreign Affairs and Colonies say nothing;
patriotically acquiescent in management of concerns in respect of which
it is the high tradition of English statesmanship that the political
game shall not be played.In such circumstances no opening for able
young men.But, suppose they could induce some blatant, irresponsible
person, persistently to put groundless questions, and make insinuations
derogatory to the character of British statesmen at home and British
officials abroad?Then they step in, and, amid applause on both sides of
House, knock over the intruder.Sort of game of House of Commons
nine-pins.Nine-pin doesn't care so that it's noticed; admirable
practice for young Parliamentary Hands._Invaluable to Budding Statesmen._]

This is SARK'S suggestion of explanation of phenomenon.Fancy much
simpler one might be found.To-night BARTLETT-ELLIS in better luck.Turns upon ATTORNEY-GENERAL; darkly hints that escape of JABEZ was a
put-up job, of which Law Officers of the Crown might, an' they would,
disclose some interesting particulars.RIGBY, who, when he bends his
step towards House of Commons, seems to leave all his shrewdness and
knowledge of the world in his chambers, rose to the fly; played
BASHMEAD-ARTLETT'S obvious game by getting angry, and delivering long
speech whilst progress of votes, hitherto going on swimmingly, was
arrested for fully an hour._Business done._--Supply voted with both hands._Tuesday._--A precious sight, one worthy of the painter's or sculptor's
art, to see majestic figure of SQUIRE OF MALWOOD standing between House
of Lords and imminent destruction.Irish members and Radicals opposite
have sworn to have blood of the Peers.SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE is
taking the waters elsewhere.Sat up
all last night, the Radicals trying to get at the Lords by the kitchen
entrance; SQUIRE withstanding them till four o'clock in the morning.Education Vote on, involving expenditure of six
millions and welfare of innumerable children.Afterwards the Post Office
Vote, upon which the Postmaster-General, ST.ARNOLD-LE-GRAND, endeavours
to reply to HENNIKER-HEATON without betraying consciousness of bodily
existence of such a person.These matters of great and abiding interest;
but only few members present to discuss them.The rest waiting outside
till the lists are cleared and battle rages once more round citadel of
the Lords sullenly sentineled by detachment from the Treasury Bench.When engagement reopened SQUIRE gone for his holiday trip, postponed by
the all-night sitting, JOHN MORLEY on guard.Breaks force of assault by
protest that the time is inopportune.By-and-by the Lords shall be
handed over to tender mercies of gentlemen below gangway.Not just now,
and not in this particular way.CHIEF SECRETARY remembers famous case of
absentee landlord not to be intimidated by the shooting of his agent.So
Lords, he urges, not to be properly punished for throwing out Evicted
Tenants Bill by having the salaries of the charwomen docked, and BLACK
ROD turned out to beg his bread.Radicals at least not to be denied satisfaction of division.Salaries
of House of Lords staff secured for another year by narrow majority
of 31._Wednesday._--The SQUIRE OF MALWOOD at last got off for his well-earned
holiday.Carries with him consciousness of having done supremely well
amid difficulties of peculiar complication.As JOSEPH in flush of
unexpected and still unexplained frankness testified, the Session will
in its accomplished work beat the record of any in modern times.The
SQUIRE been admirably backed by a rare team of colleagues; but in House
of Commons everything depends on the Leader.Had the Session been a
failure, upon his head would have fallen obloquy.As it has been a
success, his be the praise."Well, good bye," said JOHN MORLEY, tears standing in his tender eyes as
he wrung the hand of the almost Lost Leader."But you know it's not all
over yet.What shall we do if WEIR comes
up on Second Reading?""Oh, dam WEIR," said the SQUIRE.For a moment thought a usually
equable temper had been ruffled by the almost continuous work of twenty
months, culminating in an all-night sitting.On reflection he saw that
the SQUIRE was merely adapting an engineering phrase, describing a
proceeding common enough on river courses.The only point on which
remark open to criticism is that it is tautological._Business done._--Appropriation Bill brought in._Thursday._--GEORGE NEWNES looked in just now; much the same as ever;
the same preoccupied, almost pensive look; a mind weighed down by
ever-multiplying circulation.Troubled with consideration of proposal
made to him to publish special edition of _Strand Magazine_ in tongue
understanded of the majority of the peoples of India.Has conquered
the English-speaking race from Chatham to Chattanooga, from Southampton
to Sydney.The poor Indian brings his annas, and begs a boon.Meanwhile one of the candidates for vacant Poet Laureateship has broken
out into elegiac verse."NEWNES," he exclaims,

  "NEWNES, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;
  Though not of royal, yet of hallowed line."That sort of thing would make some men vain.There is no couplet to
parallel it since the famous one written by POPE on a place frequented
by a Sovereign whose death is notorious, a place where

  Great ANNA, whom three realms obey,
  Did sometimes counsel take and sometimes tea.The poet, whose volume bears the proudly humble pseudonym "A Village
Peasant," should look in at the House of Commons and continue his
studies.There are a good many of us here worth a poet's attention.SARK
says the thing is easy enough."Toss 'em off in no time," says he."There's the SQUIRE now, who has not lately referred to his Plantagenet
parentage.Apostrophising him in Committee on Evicted Tenants Bill one
might have said:--

  SQUIRE, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;
  Though not of hallowed yet of royal line."_Business done._--Appropriation Bill read second time.Sir WILFRID LAWSON and others said "Dam."_Saturday._--Appropriation Bill read third time this morning.Prorogation served with five o'clock tea.said one of the House of Commons waiters loitering at the
gateway of Palace Yard and replying to inquiring visitor from the
country.[Illustration: THE IMPERIAL SHEFFIELD NINE-PIN.*       *       *       *       *

[Transcriber's Note:

Alternative spellings retained.His quick mind
had grasped the fact that it was the girl's bedroom he had taken.Other
things he had gathered that afternoon from the humming sewing-machine,
from Sidney's businesslike way of renting the little room, from the
glimpse of a woman in a sunny window, bent over a needle.Genteel
poverty was what it meant, and more--the constant drain of disheartened,
middle-aged women on the youth and courage of the girl beside him.K. Le Moyne, who was living his own tragedy those days, what with
poverty and other things, sat on the doorstep while Sidney talked, and
swore a quiet oath to be no further weight on the girl's buoyant spirit.And, since determining on a virtue is halfway to gaining it, his voice
lost its perfunctory note.He had no intention of letting the Street
encroach on him.He had built up a wall between himself and the rest of
the world, and he would not scale it.Let others get what they could out of living.Sidney, suddenly practical, broke in on his thoughts:--

"Where are you going to get your meals?"I can stop in somewhere on my way downtown.I work in the gas office--I don't believe I told you.It's rather
haphazard--not the gas office, but the eating."It's very bad for you," said Sidney, with decision."It leads to
slovenly habits, such as going without when you're in a hurry, and that
sort of thing.The only thing is to have some one expecting you at a
certain time."McKee's boarding-house at the corner.Twenty-one
meals for five dollars, and a ticket to punch.Tillie, the dining-room
girl, punches for every meal you get.If you miss any meals, your ticket
is good until it is punched.McKee doesn't like it if you
miss."McKee for me," said Le Moyne."I daresay, if I know
that--er--Tillie is waiting with the punch, I'll be fairly regular to my
meals."The Street, which mistrusted night air, even on a
hot summer evening, was closing its windows.Reginald, having eaten
his fill, had cuddled in the warm hollow of Sidney's lap, and slept.By shifting his position, the man was able to see the girl's face.Very
lovely it was, he thought.From
the middle age of his almost thirty years, she was a child.There had
been a boy in the shadows when he came up the Street.Of course there
would be a boy--a nice, clear-eyed chap--

Sidney was looking at the moon.With that dreamer's part of her that she
had inherited from her dead and gone father, she was quietly worshiping
the night.But her busy brain was working, too,--the practical brain
that she had got from her mother's side.K. Le Moyne, who had built a wall between himself and the world, had
already married her to the youth of the shadows, and was feeling an odd
sense of loss."I suppose you've been sending things to the laundry, and--what do you
do about your stockings?""Buy cheap ones and throw 'em away when they're worn out."There seemed
to be no reserve with this surprising young person.When they're closed one can button over them as well
as--"

"I think," said Sidney, "that it is quite time some one took a little
care of you.If you will give Katie, our maid, twenty-five cents a week,
she'll do your washing and not tear your things to ribbons.Sheer stupefaction was K. Le Moyne's.After a moment:--

"You're really rather wonderful, Miss Page.Here am I, lodged, fed,
washed, ironed, and mended for seven dollars and seventy-five cents a
week!""I hope," said Sidney severely, "that you'll put what you save in the
bank."He was still somewhat dazed when he went up the narrow staircase to
his swept and garnished room.Never, in all of a life that had been
active,--until recently,--had he been so conscious of friendliness and
kindly interest.Some of the tired lines left his
face.Under the gas chandelier, he straightened and threw out his arms.Then he reached down into his coat pocket and drew out a wide-awake and
suspicious Reginald.It was quite cheerful, although the little
room was hot, and although, when he stood, he had a perilous feeling
that the ceiling was close above.He deposited Reginald carefully on
the floor in front of the bureau, and the squirrel, after eyeing him,
retreated to its nest.It was late when K. Le Moyne retired to bed.Wrapped in a paper and
securely tied for the morning's disposal, was considerable masculine
underclothing, ragged and buttonless.Not for worlds would he have had
Sidney discover his threadbare inner condition."New underwear for yours
tomorrow, K. Le Moyne," he said to himself, as he unknotted his cravat."New underwear, and something besides K. for a first name."He pondered over that for a time, taking off his shoes slowly and
thinking hard."Kenneth, King, Kerr--" None of them appealed to him.And, after all, what did it matter?He dropped a shoe, and Reginald, who had gained enough courage to emerge
and sit upright on the fender, fell over backward.Sidney did not sleep much that night.She lay awake, gazing into the
scented darkness, her arms under her head.Love had come into her life
at last.A man--only Joe, of course, but it was not the boy himself, but
what he stood for, that thrilled her had asked her to be his wife.In her little back room, with the sweetness of the tree blossoms
stealing through the open window, Sidney faced the great mystery of life
and love, and flung out warm young arms.Joe would be thinking of her
now, as she thought of him.Or would he have gone to sleep, secure in
her half promise?There was coming to Sidney a time when love
would mean, not receiving, but giving--the divine fire instead of the
pale flame of youth.A night breeze came through the windows and spread coolness through
the little house.The ailanthus tree waved in the moonlight and sent
sprawling shadows over the wall of K. Le Moyne's bedroom.In the yard
the leaves of the morning-glory vines quivered as if under the touch of
a friendly hand.K. Le Moyne slept diagonally in his bed, being very long.In sleep the
lines were smoothed out of his face.He looked like a tired, overgrown
boy.And while he slept the ground-squirrel ravaged the pockets of his
shabby coat.CHAPTER II


Sidney could not remember when her Aunt Harriet had not sat at the
table.It was one of her earliest disillusionments to learn that Aunt
Harriet lived with them, not because she wished to, but because Sidney's
father had borrowed her small patrimony and she was "boarding it out."Eighteen years she had "boarded it out."Sidney had been born and grown
to girlhood; the dreamer father had gone to his grave, with valuable
patents lost for lack of money to renew them--gone with his faith in
himself destroyed, but with his faith in the world undiminished: for he
left his wife and daughter without a dollar of life insurance.Harriet Kennedy had voiced her own view of the matter, the after the
funeral, to one of the neighbors:--

"He left no insurance.To the little widow, her sister, she had been no less bitter, and more
explicit."It looks to me, Anna," she said, "as if by borrowing everything I had
George had bought me, body and soul, for the rest of my natural life.I'll stay now until Sidney is able to take hold.Then I'm going to live
my own life.It will be a little late, but the Kennedys live a long
time."The day of Harriet's leaving had seemed far away to Anna Page.Sidney
was still her baby, a pretty, rather leggy girl, in her first year
at the High School, prone to saunter home with three or four
knickerbockered boys in her train, reading "The Duchess" stealthily, and
begging for longer dresses.She had given up her dolls, but she still
made clothes for them out of scraps from Harriet's sewing-room.In the
parlance of the Street, Harriet "sewed"--and sewed well.She had taken Anna into business with her, but the burden of the
partnership had always been on Harriet.To give her credit, she had not
complained.She was past forty by that time, and her youth had slipped
by in that back room with its dingy wallpaper covered with paper
patterns.On the day after the arrival of the roomer, Harriet Kennedy came down to
breakfast a little late.Katie, the general housework girl, had tied
a small white apron over her generous gingham one, and was serving
breakfast.From the kitchen came the dump of an iron, and cheerful
singing.Page, who had taken advantage
of Harriet's tardiness to read the obituary column in the morning paper,
dropped it.It was her custom to jerk her chair out
and drop into it, as if she grudged every hour spent on food.Sidney,
not hearing the jerk, paused with her iron in air.She's all dressed up, and she doesn't want any coffee."It was to her that Harriet made her speech:--

"Sidney, when your father died, I promised to look after both you and
your mother until you were able to take care of yourself.Of course, even before that I had helped to support you.""If you would only have your coffee, Harriet!"Page sat with her hand on the handle of the old silver-plated
coffee-pot.You have health and energy, and you have
youth, which I haven't.In the next twenty years, at the
outside, I've got not only to support myself, but to save something to
keep me after that, if I live.I don't
want to live forever, but I've always played in hard luck."Well, Aunt Harriet, you're quite right.You've been a saint to
us, but if you want to go away--"

"Harriet!"Page, "you're not thinking--"

"Please, mother."Harriet's eyes softened as she looked at the girl

"We can manage," said Sidney quietly."We'll miss you, but it's time we
learned to depend on ourselves."After that, in a torrent, came Harriet's declaration of independence.And, mixed in with its pathetic jumble of recriminations, hostility to
her sister's dead husband, and resentment for her lost years, came
poor Harriet's hopes and ambitions, the tragic plea of a woman who must
substitute for the optimism and energy of youth the grim determination
of middle age."I can do good work," she finished."I'm full of ideas, if I could get a
chance to work them out.There isn't a woman
on the Street who knows real clothes when she sees them.They don't even
know how to wear their corsets.They send me bundles of hideous stuff,
with needles and shields and imitation silk for lining, and when I
turn out something worth while out of the mess they think the dress is
queer!"Page could not get back of Harriet's revolt to its cause.To her,
Harriet was not an artist pleading for her art; she was a sister and a
bread-winner deserting her trust."I'm sure," she said stiffly, "we paid you back every cent we borrowed.If you stayed here after George died, it was because you offered to."She fumbled for the handkerchief at her belt.But
Sidney went around the table and flung a young arm over her aunt's
shoulders."Why didn't you say all that a year ago?We've been selfish, but we're
not as bad as you think.And if any one in this world is entitled to
success you are.She covered her emotion with
details:--

"Mrs.Lorenz is going to let me make Christine some things, and if
they're all right I may make her trousseau.""She's not engaged, but her mother says it's only a matter of a short
time.I'm going to take two rooms in the business part of town, and put
a couch in the backroom to sleep on."Sidney's mind flew to Christine and her bright future, to a trousseau
bought with the Lorenz money, to Christine settled down, a married
woman, with Palmer Howe.Harriet had two
triangular red spots in her sallow cheeks."I can get a few good models--that's the only way to start.And if you
care to do hand work for me, Anna, I'll send it to you, and pay you the
regular rates.There isn't the call for it there used to be, but just a
touch gives dash."Page's grievances had worked their way to the surface.Sidney
and Harriet had made her world, such as it was, and her world was in
revolt.With you leaving, and Sidney renting her
room and sleeping on a folding-bed in the sewing-room, everything seems
upside down.I never thought I should live to see strange men running in
and out of this house and carrying latch-keys."This in reference to Le Moyne, whose tall figure had made a hurried exit
some time before.Nothing could have symbolized Harriet's revolt more thoroughly than her
going upstairs after a hurried breakfast, and putting on her hat and
coat.She had heard of rooms, she said, and there was nothing urgent in
the work-room.Her eyes were brighter already as she went out.Sidney,
kissing her in the hall and wishing her luck, realized suddenly what
a burden she and her mother must have been for the last few years.They would never be a burden again--never, as
long as she had strength and health!Page had worked herself into a state bordering on
hysteria.She came in at three o'clock,
and Katie gave her a cup of tea.At the news of her sister's condition,
she merely shrugged her shoulders."She'll not die, Katie," she said calmly."But see that Miss Sidney eats
something, and if she is worried tell her I said to get Dr.Very significant of Harriet's altered outlook was this casual summoning
of the Street's family doctor.She was already dealing in larger
figures.A sort of recklessness had come over her since the morning.Already she was learning that peace of mind is essential to successful
endeavor.Somewhere Harriet had read a quotation from a Persian poet;
she could not remember it, but its sense had stayed with her: "What
though we spill a few grains of corn, or drops of oil from the cruse?So Harriet, having spilled oil from her cruse in the shape of Dr.The recklessness of pure adventure was in her blood.She had taken rooms at a rental that she determinedly put out of her
mind, and she was on her way to buy furniture.No pirate, fitting out
a ship for the highways of the sea, ever experienced more guilty and
delightful excitement.Ed was out "on a case" and might not be
in until evening.Sidney sat in the darkened room and waved a fan over
her mother's rigid form.At half after five, Johnny Rosenfeld from the alley, who worked for a
florist after school, brought a box of roses to Sidney, and departed
grinning impishly.He knew Joe, had seen him in the store.Soon the
alley knew that Sidney had received a dozen Killarney roses at three
dollars and a half, and was probably engaged to Joe Drummond.Ed," said Sidney, as he followed her down the stairs, "can you
spare the time to talk to me a little while?"Perhaps the elder Wilson had a quick vision of the crowded office
waiting across the Street; but his reply was prompt:

"Any amount of time."Sidney led the way into the small parlor, where Joe's roses, refused by
the petulant invalid upstairs, bloomed alone."First of all," said Sidney, "did you mean what you said upstairs?"It said--which was perfectly true--that he had sacrificed himself to his
brother's career: that, for the sake of that brilliant young surgeon,
Dr.Ed had done without wife and children; that to send him abroad
he had saved and skimped; that he still went shabby and drove the old
buggy, while Max drove about in an automobile coupe.Sidney, not at
all of the stuff martyrs are made of, sat in the scented parlor and,
remembering all this, was ashamed of her rebellion."I'm going into a hospital," said Sidney.He liked to have all the symptoms before he made a
diagnosis or ventured an opinion.So Sidney, trying to be cheerful, and
quite unconscious of the anxiety in her voice, told her story."It's fearfully hard work, of course," he commented, when she had
finished."I don't think I like the idea," he said at last."It's splendid work
for an older woman.But it's life, child--life in the raw.As we get
along in years we lose our illusions--some of them, not all, thank God.But for you, at your age, to be brought face to face with things as
they are, and not as we want them to be--it seems such an unnecessary
sacrifice.""Don't you think," said Sidney bravely, "that you are a poor person to
talk of sacrifice?Haven't you always, all your life--"

Dr.Ed  to the roots of his straw- hair."Certainly not," he said almost irritably."Max had genius; I
had--ability.One real success is better than two
halves.Not"--he smiled down at her--"not that I minimize my usefulness.Somebody has to do the hack-work, and, if I do say it myself, I'm a
pretty good hack.""Then I shall be a hack, too.Of course, I had
thought of other things,--my father wanted me to go to college,--but I'm
strong and willing.And one thing I must make up my mind to, Dr.Ed; I
shall have to support my mother."Harriet passed the door on her way in to a belated supper.The man in
the parlor had a momentary glimpse of her slender, sagging shoulders,
her thin face, her undisguised middle age."Yes," he said, when she was out of hearing."It's hard, but I dare say
it's right enough, too.Only--I wish
it didn't have to be."Sidney, left alone, stood in the little parlor beside the roses.She
touched them tenderly, absently.Life, which the day before had called
her with the beckoning finger of dreams, now reached out grim insistent
hands.CHAPTER III


K. Le Moyne had wakened early that first morning in his new quarters.When he sat up and yawned, it was to see his worn cravat disappearing
with vigorous tugs under the bureau."You and I, Reginald," he apostrophized the bureau, "will have to come
to an understanding.What I leave on the floor you may have, but what
blows down is not to be touched."Because he was young and very strong, he wakened to a certain lightness
of spirit.The morning sun had always called him to a new day, and the
sun was shining.But he grew depressed as he prepared for the office.He told himself savagely, as he put on his shabby clothing, that, having
sought for peace and now found it, he was an ass for resenting it.The
trouble was, of course, that he came of fighting stock: soldiers and
explorers, even a gentleman adventurer or two, had been his forefather.He loathed peace with a deadly loathing.Having given up everything else, K. Le Moyne had also given up the
love of woman.He had been too busy for
women; and now he was too idle.A small part of his brain added figures
in the office of a gas company daily, for the sum of two dollars and
fifty cents per eight-hour working day.But the real K. Le Moyne
that had dreamed dreams, had nothing to do with the figures, but sat
somewhere in his head and mocked him as he worked at his task."Time's going by, and here you are!"mocked the real person--who was, of
course, not K. Le Moyne at all."You're the hell of a lot of use, aren't
you?Two and two are four and three are seven--take off the discount.It's a man's work, isn't it?""Somebody's got to do this sort of thing," protested the small part of
his brain that earned the two-fifty per working day."And it's a great
anaesthetic.He can't think when he's doing it.There's something
practical about figures, and--rational."He dressed quickly, ascertaining that he had enough money to buy a
five-dollar ticket at Mrs.McKee's; and, having given up the love of
woman with other things, he was careful not to look about for Sidney on
his way.McKee's, and was initiated into the mystery of
the ticket punch.The food was rather good, certainly plentiful;
and even his squeamish morning appetite could find no fault with the
self-respecting tidiness of the place.Tillie proved to be neat and
austere.He fancied it would not be pleasant to be very late for one's
meals--in fact, Sidney had hinted as much.Some of the "mealers"--the
Street's name for them--ventured on various small familiarities of
speech with Tillie.K. Le Moyne himself was scrupulously polite, but
reserved.He was determined not to let the Street encroach on his
wretchedness.Because he had come to live there was no reason why it
should adopt him.When the deaf-and-dumb book
agent wrote something on a pencil pad and pushed it toward him, he
replied in kind."We are very glad to welcome you to the McKee family," was what was
written on the pad."Very happy, indeed, to be with you," wrote back Le Moyne--and realized
with a sort of shock that he meant it.The greeting and the breakfast
cheered him; also, he had evidently made some headway with Tillie.'s previous walk of life there had been no toothpicks; or, if there
were any, they were kept, along with the family scandals, in a closet.But nearly a year of buffeting about had taught him many things.He took
one, and placed it nonchalantly in his waistcoat pocket, as he had seen
the others do.Tillie, her rush hour over, wandered back into the kitchen and poured
herself a cup of coffee.McKee was reweighing the meat order."Kind of a nice fellow," Tillie said, cup to lips--"the new man."He'd be handsome if he wasn't so grouchy-looking.Wagner sent him one of his love letters.McKee drew a long breath and entered the lam stew in a book."When I think of Anna Page taking a roomer, it just about knocks me
over, Tillie.And where they'll put him, in that little house--he
looked thin, what I saw of him.This last
referred, not to K. Le Moyne, of course, but to the lamb stew."Thin as a fiddle-string.""Just keep an eye on him, that he gets enough."Then, rather ashamed of
her unbusinesslike methods: "A thin mealer's a poor advertisement.Do
you suppose this is the dog meat or the soup scraps?"In such manner was most of the
Street and its environs connected; in such wise did its small gossip
start at one end and pursue its course down one side and up the other."Sidney Page is engaged to Joe Drummond," announced Tillie."He sent her
a lot of pink roses yesterday."There was no malice in her flat statement, no envy.Sidney and she,
living in the world of the Street, occupied different spheres.But the
very lifelessness in her voice told how remotely such things touched
her, and thus was tragic."Mealers" came and went--small clerks, petty
tradesmen, husbands living alone in darkened houses during the summer
hegira of wives.Various and catholic was Tillie's male acquaintance,
but compounded of good fellowship only.Once, years before, romance had
paraded itself before her in the garb of a traveling nurseryman--had
walked by and not come back."And Miss Harriet's going into business for herself.She's taken rooms
downtown; she's going to be Madame Something or other."If she
raises her prices she can't make my new foulard."Tillie sat at the table, her faded blue eyes fixed on the back yard,
where her aunt, Mrs.Rosenfeld, was hanging out the week's wash of table
linen."I don't know as it's so selfish," she reflected.I guess a body's got the right to live it."McKee eyed her suspiciously, but Tillie's face showed no emotion."You don't ever hear of Schwitter, do you?""No; I guess she's still living."Schwitter, the nurseryman, had proved to have a wife in an insane
asylum.That was why Tillie's romance had only paraded itself before her
and had gone by.Tillie rose and tied a gingham apron over her white one.Only sometimes--"

"I don't know as it would have been so wrong.He ain't young, and I
ain't.He had nice manners; he'd have
been good to me."Then:

"And him a married man!""Well, I'm not going to do it," Tillie soothed her."I get to thinking
about it sometimes; that's all.He's got the same nice way about him."Aye, the new man had made her think of him, and June, and the lovers
who lounged along the Street in the moonlit avenues toward the park and
love; even Sidney's pink roses.Change was in the very air of the Street
that June morning.It was in Tillie, making a last clutch at youth, and
finding, in this pale flare of dying passion, courage to remember what
she had schooled herself to forget; in Harriet asserting her right to
live her life; in Sidney, planning with eager eyes a life of service
which did not include Joe; in K. Le Moyne, who had built up a wall
between himself and the world, and was seeing it demolished by a
deaf-and-dumb book agent whose weapon was a pencil pad!And yet, for a week nothing happened: Joe came in the evenings and sat
on the steps with Sidney, his honest heart, in his eyes.She could not
bring herself at first to tell him about the hospital.She put it off
from day to day.Anna, no longer sulky, accepted wit the childlike faith
Sidney's statement that "they'd get along; she had a splendid scheme,"
and took to helping Harriet in her preparations for leaving.Tillie,
afraid of her rebellious spirit, went to prayer meeting.And K. Le
Moyne, finding his little room hot in the evenings and not wishing to
intrude on the two on the doorstep, took to reading his paper in the
park, and after twilight to long, rapid walks out into the country.The
walks satisfied the craving of his active body for exercise, and tired
him so he could sleep.Wagner, and they
carried on an animated conversation until it was too dark to see the
pad.Even then, it developed that Wagner could write in the dark; and
he secured the last word in a long argument by doing this and striking a
match for K. to read by.When K. was sure that the boy had gone, he would turn back toward the
Street.Some of the heaviness of his spirit always left him at sight of
the little house.Its kindly atmosphere seemed to reach out and envelop
him.Within was order and quiet, the fresh-down bed, the tidiness of
his ordered garments.There was even affection--Reginald, waiting on
the fender for his supper, and regarding him with wary and bright-eyed
friendliness.Life, that had seemed so simple, had grown very complicated for Sidney.There was her mother to break the news to, and Joe.Harriet would
approve, she felt; but these others!To assure Anna that she must
manage alone for three years, in order to be happy and comfortable
afterward--that was hard enough to tell Joe she was planning a future
without him, to destroy the light in his blue eyes--that hurt.One Friday evening, coming home late,
as usual, he found her on the doorstep, and Joe gone.The moon had waxed and waned, and the Street was dark.Even
the ailanthus blossoms had ceased their snow-like dropping.The <DW52>
man who drove Dr.Ed in the old buggy on his daily rounds had brought
out the hose and sprinkled the street.Within this zone of freshness, of
wet asphalt and dripping gutters, Sidney sat, cool and silent.My idea of luxury is to have the
Street sprinkled on a hot night."K. disposed of his long legs on the steps.He was trying to fit his own
ideas of luxury to a garden hose and a city street."I'm afraid you're working too hard."I do a minimum of labor for a minimum of wage."But you work at night, don't you?"Then:

"No, Miss Page.""I do believe--why, how silly of you!""Really, I like it," he protested."I hang over a desk all day, and in
the evening I want to walk.I ramble around the park and see lovers on
benches--it's rather thrilling.They sit on the same benches evening
after evening.I know a lot of them by sight, and if they're not there
I wonder if they have quarreled, or if they have finally got married and
ended the romance.Why should their
getting married end the romance?And don't you know that, if you insist
on walking the streets and parks at night because Joe Drummond is here,
I shall have to tell him not to come?"They had rather a heated argument
over it, and became much better acquainted."If I were engaged to him," Sidney ended, her cheeks very pink, "I--I
might understand.But, as I am not--"

"Ah!"said K., a trifle unsteadily.Only a week--and love was one of the things she had had to give up, with
others.Not, of course, that he was in love with Sidney then.But he had
been desperately lonely, and, for all her practical clearheadedness,
she was softly and appealingly feminine.By way of keeping his head, he
talked suddenly and earnestly of Mrs.McKee, and food, and Tillie, and
of Mr."It's like a game," he said."We disagree on everything, especially
Mexico.If you ever tried to spell those Mexican names--"

"Why did you think I was engaged?"'s walk of life--that walk of life where there are no
toothpicks, and no one would have believed that twenty-one meals could
have been secured for five dollars with a ticket punch thrown in--young
girls did not receive the attention of one young man to the exclusion of
others unless they were engaged.I am quite certain, for
instance, that Reginald suspects it.""It's Johnny Rosenfeld," said Sidney, with decision."It's horrible, the
way things get about.Because Joe sent me a box of roses--As a matter
of fact, I'm not engaged, or going to be, Mr.I'm going into a
hospital to be a nurse."A man is in
a rather a bad way when, every time he closes his eyes, he sees the
same thing, especially if it is rather terrible.When it gets to a point
where he lies awake at night and reads, for fear of closing them--

"You're too young, aren't you?"Ed--one of the Wilsons across the Street--is going to help me about
that.We're very proud of him in the Street."Lucky for K. Le Moyne that the moon no longer shone on the low gray
doorstep, that Sidney's mind had traveled far away to shining floors
and rows of white beds.Closer to her than the hospital was life in the raw that
night.So, even here, on this quiet street in this distant city, there was
to be no peace.Was
there no place where a man could lose himself?He would have to move on
again, of course.But that, it seemed, was just what he could not do.For:

"I want to ask you to do something, and I hope you'll be quite frank,"
said Sidney."Anything that I can do--"

"It's this.If you are comfortable, and--and like the room and all that,
I wish you'd stay."She hurried on: "If I could feel that mother had a
dependable person like you in the house, it would all be easier.""But--forgive my asking; I'm really interested--can your mother manage?You'll get practically no money during your training."A friend of mine, Christine Lorenz, is going to
be married.Her people are wealthy, but she'll have nothing but what
Palmer makes.She'd like to have the parlor and the sitting room
behind.They wouldn't interfere with you at all," she added hastily."Christine's father would build a little balcony at the side for them, a
sort of porch, and they'd sit there in the evenings."Behind Sidney's carefully practical tone the man read appeal.Never
before had he realized how narrow the girl's world had been.The Street,
with but one dimension, bounded it!In her perplexity, she was appealing
to him who was practically a stranger.And he knew then that he must do the thing she asked.He, who had fled
so long, could roam no more.Here on the Street, with its menace just
across, he must live, that she might work.In his world, men had worked
that women might live in certain places, certain ways.This girl was
going out to earn her living, and he would stay to make it possible.But
no hint of all this was in his voice."I shall stay, of course," he said gravely."I--this is the nearest
thing to home that I've known for a long time.So they moved their puppets about, Anna and Harriet, Christine and
her husband-to-be, Dr.Ed, even Tillie and the Rosenfelds; shifted and
placed them, and, planning, obeyed inevitable law."Christine shall come, then," said Sidney forsooth, "and we will throw
out a balcony."So they planned, calmly ignorant that poor Christine's story and
Tillie's and Johnny Rosenfeld's and all the others' were already written
among the things that are, and the things that shall be hereafter."You are very good to me," said Sidney.When she rose, K. Le Moyne sprang to his feet.Anna had noticed that he always rose when she entered his room,--with
fresh towels on Katie's day out, for instance,--and she liked him for
it.Years ago, the men she had known had shown this courtesy to their
women; but the Street regarded such things as affectation."I wonder if you would do me another favor?I'm afraid you'll take to
avoiding me, if I keep on.""I don't think you need fear that.""This stupid story about Joe Drummond--I'm not saying I'll never marry
him, but I'm certainly not engaged.Now and then, when you are taking
your evening walks, if you would ask me to walk with you--"

K. looked rather dazed."I can't imagine anything pleasanter; but I wish you'd explain just
how--"

Sidney smiled at him.As he stood on the lowest step, their eyes were
almost level."If I walk with you, they'll know I'm not engaged to Joe," she said,
with engaging directness.He waited in the lower hall until she had reached
the top of the staircase.For some curious reason, in the time to come,
that was the way Sidney always remembered K. Le Moyne--standing in the
little hall, one hand upstretched to shut off the gas overhead, and his
eyes on hers above."Good-night," said K. Le Moyne.And all the things he had put out of his
life were in his voice.CHAPTER IV


On the morning after Sidney had invited K. Le Moyne to take her to walk,
Max Wilson came down to breakfast rather late.Ed had breakfasted an
hour before, and had already attended, with much profanity on the part
of the patient, to a boil on the back of Mr."Better change your laundry," cheerfully advised Dr.Ed, cutting a strip
of adhesive plaster."Your neck's irritated from your white collars."Rosenfeld eyed him suspiciously, but, possessing a sense of humor also,
he grinned."It ain't my everyday things that bother me," he replied."It's my
blankety-blank dress suit.But if a man wants to be tony--"

"Tony" was not of the Street, but of its environs.Harriet was "tony"
because she walked with her elbows in and her head up.Max was
"tony" because he breakfasted late, and had a man come once a week and
take away his clothes to be pressed.He was "tony," too, because he had
brought back from Europe narrow-shouldered English-cut clothes, when the
Street was still padding its shoulders.Even K. would have been classed
with these others, for the stick that he carried on his walks, for the
fact that his shabby gray coat was as unmistakably foreign in cut as Dr.Max's, had the neighborhood so much as known him by sight.But K., so
far, had remained in humble obscurity, and, outside of Mrs.McKee's, was
known only as the Pages' roomer.Rosenfeld buttoned up the blue flannel shirt which, with a pair of
Dr.Ed's cast-off trousers, was his only wear; and fished in his pocket.My old woman works a day and a half
for two dollars.""I guess it's worth two dollars to you to be able to sleep on your
back."He was imperturbably straightening his small glass table."If you don't like my price, I'll lend you the knife the next
time, and you can let your wife attend to you."Rosenfeld drew out a silver dollar, and followed it reluctantly with a
limp and dejected dollar bill."There are times," he said, "when, if you'd put me and the missus and a
knife in the same room, you wouldn't have much left but the knife."Ed waited until he had made his stiff-necked exit.Then he took the
two dollars, and, putting the money into an envelope, indorsed it in his
illegible hand.He heard his brother's step on the stairs, and Dr.Ed
made haste to put away the last vestiges of his little operation.Ed's lapses from surgical cleanliness were a sore trial to the younger
man, fresh from the clinics of Europe.In his downtown office, to which
he would presently make his leisurely progress, he wore a white coat,
and sterilized things of which Dr.So, as he came down the stairs, Dr.Ed, who had wiped his tiny
knife with a bit of cotton,--he hated sterilizing it; it spoiled the
edge,--thrust it hastily into his pocket.He had cut boils without
boiling anything for a good many years, and no trouble.But he was wise
with the wisdom of the serpent and the general practitioner, and there
was no use raising a discussion.Max's morning mood was always a cheerful one.Now and then the way of
the transgressor is disgustingly pleasant.Max, who sat up until all
hours of the night, drinking beer or whiskey-and-soda, and playing
bridge, wakened to a clean tongue and a tendency to have a cigarette
between shoes, so to speak.Ed, whose wildest dissipation had perhaps
been to bring into the world one of the neighborhood's babies, wakened
customarily to the dark hour of his day, when he dubbed himself failure
and loathed the Street with a deadly loathing.So now Max brought his handsome self down the staircase and paused at
the office door."It's after nine," protested Ed mildly."If I don't start early, I never
get through.""If things go on as they've been doing,
I'll have to have an assistant.I'd rather have you than anybody, of
course."He put his lithe surgeon's hand on his brother's shoulder."Where would I be if it hadn't been for you?All the fellows know what
you've done."It was one thing to work hard that there
might be one success instead of two half successes.It was a different
thing to advertise one's mediocrity to the world.His sphere of the
Street and the neighborhood was his own.To give it all up and become
his younger brother's assistant--even if it meant, as it would, better
hours and more money--would be to submerge his identity."I guess I'll stay where I am," he said."They know me around here, and
I know them.By the way, will you leave this envelope at Mrs.Maggie Rosenfeld is ironing there to-day."You'll go on here to the end of your days, working for a pittance,"
he objected."Inside of ten years there'll be no general practitioners;
then where will you be?""I'll manage somehow," said his brother placidly."I guess there will
always be a few that can pay my prices better than what you specialists
ask.""I dare say, if this is the way you let them pay your prices."He held out the envelope, and the older man.Max was his brother, unselfishly proud, of his skill,
of his handsome person, of his easy good manners; very humble, too, of
his own knowledge and experience.If he ever suspected any lack of
finer fiber in Max, he put the thought away.He prepared his black bag for the day's calls--stethoscope, thermometer,
eye-cup, bandages, case of small vials, a lump of absorbent cotton in
a not over-fresh towel; in the bottom, a heterogeneous collection of
instruments, a roll of adhesive plaster, a bottle or two of sugar-milk
tablets for the children, a dog collar that had belonged to a dead
collie, and had put in the bag in some curious fashion and there
remained.He prepared the bag a little nervously, while Max ate.He felt that
modern methods and the best usage might not have approved of the bag.On
his way out he paused at the dining-room door."Operating at four--wish you could come in."I've promised Sidney Page to speak about her to
you."Why, she can't be over sixteen."Do you think any girl of that age is responsible
enough to have life and death put in her hands?Besides, although I
haven't noticed her lately, she used to be a pretty little thing.There
is no use filling up the wards with a lot of ornaments; it keeps the
internes all stewed up."Ed mildly, "have you found good looks in a girl
a handicap?"It
would be better than having her run across the Street--would put things
on the right footing.For, if he did have her admitted, she would have
to learn at once that he was no longer "Dr.Max"; that, as a matter of
fact, he was now staff, and entitled to much dignity, to speech without
contradiction or argument, to clean towels, and a deferential interne at
his elbow.Having given his promise, Max promptly forgot about it.Christine and Sidney had been children when he went to
Vienna, and since his return he had hardly noticed them.Society, always
kind to single men of good appearance and easy good manners, had taken
him up.He wore dinner or evening clothes five nights out of seven, and
was supposed by his conservative old neighbors to be going the pace.The
rumor had been fed by Mrs.Rosenfeld, who, starting out for her day's
washing at six o'clock one morning, had found Dr.Max's car, lamps
lighted, and engine going, drawn up before the house door, with its
owner asleep at the wheel.The story traveled the length of the Street
that day.Rosenfeld, who was occasionally flowery, "sittin' up
as straight as this washboard, and his silk hat shinin' in the sun; but
exceptin' the car, which was workin' hard and gettin' nowhere, the whole
outfit in the arms of Morpheus."Lorenz, whose day it was to have Mrs.Rosenfeld, and who was
unfamiliar with mythology, gasped at the last word."Do you mean to say he's got that awful drug habit!"Max that morning, a big man, almost as
tall as K. Le Moyne, eager of life, strong and a bit reckless, not fine,
perhaps, but not evil.He had the same zest of living as Sidney, but
with this difference--the girl stood ready to give herself to life: he
knew that life would come to him.Max, that
morning, as he drew on his gloves before stepping into his car.K. Le Moyne had been an hour at his desk.The McKee
napkins lay ironed in orderly piles.Max was suffering under a sense of defeat as he rode
downtown.The night before, he had proposed to a girl and had been
rejected.He was not in love with the girl,--she would have been a
suitable wife, and a surgeon ought to be married; it gives people
confidence,--but his pride was hurt.He recalled the exact words of the
rejection."You're too good-looking, Max," she had said, "and that's the truth.Now
that operations are as popular as fancy dancing, and much less bother,
half the women I know are crazy about their surgeons.I'm too fond of my
peace of mind."She had looked at him with level,
understanding eyes.He put the disagreeable recollection out of his mind as he parked his
car and made his way to his office.Here would be people who believed
in him, from the middle-aged nurse in her prim uniform to the row of
patients sitting stiffly around the walls of the waiting-room.Max,
pausing in the hall outside the door of his private office, drew a long
breath.This was the real thing--work and plenty of it, a chance to show
the other men what he could do, a battle to win!No humanitarian was he,
but a fighter: each day he came to his office with the same battle lust.When she turned, he faced an
agreeable surprise.Instead of Miss Simpson, he faced a young and
attractive girl, faintly familiar."We tried to get you by telephone," she explained.Miss Simpson's father died this morning, and she knew you
would have to have some one.I was just starting for my vacation, so
they sent me.""Rather a poor substitute for a vacation," he commented.He had seen her before in the hospital, but
he had never really noticed how attractive she was.The combination of yellow hair and dark eyes
was unusual.He remembered, just in time, to express regret at Miss
Simpson's bereavement."I am Miss Harrison," explained the substitute, and held out his long
white coat.The ceremony, purely perfunctory with Miss Simpson on duty,
proved interesting, Miss Harrison, in spite of her high heels, being
small and the young surgeon tall.When he was finally in the coat, she
was rather flushed and palpitating."But I KNEW your name, of course," lied Dr."And--I'm sorry about
the vacation."Miss Harrison was nimble and alert, but the
surgeon worked quickly and with few words, was impatient when she could
not find the things he called for, even broke into restrained profanity
now and then.She went a little pale over her mistakes, but preserved
her dignity and her wits.Now and then he found her dark eyes fixed
on him, with something inscrutable but pleasing in their depths.The
situation was: rather piquant.Consciously he was thinking only of what
he was doing.Subconsciously his busy ego was finding solace after last
night's rebuff.Once, during the cleaning up between cases, he dropped to a personality.He was drying his hands, while she placed freshly sterilized instruments
on a glass table."You are almost a foreign type, Miss Harrison.Last year, in a London
ballet, I saw a blonde Spanish girl who looked like you."Where Miss Simpson was in the habit of clumping through the morning in
flat, heavy shoes, Miss Harrison's small heels beat a busy tattoo on
the tiled floor.With the rustling of her starched dress, the sound was
essentially feminine, almost insistent.When he had time to notice it,
it amused him that he did not find it annoying.Once, as she passed him a bistoury, he deliberately placed his fine
hand over her fingers and smiled into her eyes.It was play for him; it
lightened the day's work.Sidney was in the waiting-room.There had been no tedium in the
morning's waiting.Like all imaginative people, she had the gift of
dramatizing herself.She was seeing herself in white from head to
foot, like this efficient young woman who came now and then to the
waiting-room door; she was healing the sick and closing tired eyes; she
was even imagining herself proposed to by an aged widower with grown
children and quantities of money, one of her patients.She sat very demurely in the waiting-room with a magazine in her lap,
and told her aged patient that she admired and respected him, but that
she had given herself to the suffering poor."Everything in the world that you want," begged the elderly gentleman."You should see the world, child, and I will see it again through your
eyes.To Paris first for clothes and the opera, and then--"

"But I do not love you," Sidney replied, mentally but steadily."In all
the world I love only one man.He is--"

She hesitated here.It certainly was not Joe, or K. Le Moyne of the
gas office.It seem to her suddenly very sad that there was no one
she loved.So many people went into hospitals because they had been
disappointed in love.Max--not the
gloved and hatted Dr.Max of the Street, but a new person, one she had
never known--stood in his white office, tall, dark-eyed, dark-haired,
competent, holding out his long, immaculate surgeon's hand, and smiling
down at her.A clerk on a high stool, poring
over a ledger, is not unimpressive, or a cook over her stove.But place
the cook on the stool, poring over the ledger!Max, who had lived
all his life on the edge of Sidney's horizon, now, by the simple
changing of her point of view, loomed large and magnificent.Certainly, too, there was
considerable manner in the way in which he asked Miss Harrison to go out
and close the door behind her.Sidney's heart, considering what was happening to it, behaved very well."For goodness' sake, Sidney," said Dr.Max, "here you are a young lady
and I've never noticed it!"This, of course, was not what he had intended to say, being staff and
all that.But Sidney, visibly palpitant, was very pretty, much prettier
than the Harrison girl, beating a tattoo with her heels in the next
room.Max, belonging to the class of man who settles his tie every time he
sees an attractive woman, thrust his hands into the pockets of his long
white coat and surveyed her quizzically.How's your mother and
Aunt Harriet?""Very well--that is, mother's never quite well."She was sitting forward
on her chair, her wide young eyes on him."Is that--is your nurse from
the hospital here?"with all the things she had
meant to say about a life of service, and that, although she was young,
she was terribly in earnest."It takes a lot of plugging before one gets the uniform.Look here,
Sidney; if you are going to the hospital because of the uniform, and
with any idea of soothing fevered brows and all that nonsense--"

She interrupted him, deeply flushed.She was young and strong, and surely a pair of willing hands--that was
absurd about the uniform.There was so much to
do in the world, and she wanted to help.Some people could give money,
but she couldn't.And, partly through
earnestness and partly through excitement, she ended in a sort of
nervous sob, and, going to the window, stood with her back to him.He followed her, and, because they were old neighbors, she did not
resent it when he put his hand on her shoulder."I don't know--of course, if you feel like that about it," he said,
"we'll see what can be done.It's hard work, and a good many times it
seems futile.They die, you know, in spite of all we can do.And there
are many things that are worse than death--"

His voice trailed off.When he had started out in his profession, he
had had some such ideal of service as this girl beside him.For just
a moment, as he stood there close to her, he saw things again with the
eyes of his young faith: to relieve pain, to straighten the crooked,
to hurt that he might heal,--not to show the other men what he could
do,--that had been his early creed.He sighed a little as he turned
away."I'll speak to the superintendent about you," he said."Perhaps you'd
like me to show you around a little."He had meant in a month, or a year.It was quite a minute before he
replied:--

"Yes, to-day, if you say.She held out both hands, and he took them, smiling."You are the kindest person I ever met.""And--perhaps you'd better not say you are applying until we find out if
there is a vacancy."He dropped her hands and looked at her in mock severity.You know, I've always been more than
half in love with you myself!"Play for him--the same victorious instinct that had made him touch Miss
Harrison's fingers as she gave him the instrument.And Sidney knew how
it was meant; she smiled into his eyes and drew down her veil briskly."Then we'll say at three," she said calmly, and took an orderly and
unflurried departure.But the little seed of tenderness had taken root.Sidney, passing in the
last week or two from girlhood to womanhood,--outgrowing Joe, had she
only known it, as she had outgrown the Street,--had come that day into
her first contact with a man of the world.True, there was K. Le Moyne.But K. was now of the Street, of that small world of one dimension that
she was leaving behind her.She sent him a note at noon, with word to Tillie at Mrs.McKee's to put
it under his plate:--

DEAR MR.LE MOYNE,--I am so excited I can hardly write.Wilson, the
surgeon, is going to take me through the hospital this afternoon.K. read it, and, perhaps because the day was hot and his butter soft
and the other "mealers" irritable with the heat, he ate little or no
luncheon.Before he went out into the sun, he read the note again.To his jealous eyes came a vision of that excursion to the hospital.Sidney, all vibrant eagerness, luminous of eye, quick of bosom; and
Wilson, sardonically smiling, amused and interested in spite of himself.He drew a long breath, and thrust the note in his pocket.The little house across the way sat square in the sun.The shades of his
windows had been lowered against the heat.K. Le Moyne made an impulsive
movement toward it and checked himself.As he went down the Street, Wilson's car came around the corner.Le
Moyne moved quietly into the shadow of the church and watched the car go
by.CHAPTER V

Sidney and K. Le Moyne sat under a tree and talked.In Sidney's lap
lay a small pasteboard box, punched with many holes.It was the day of
releasing Reginald, but she had not yet been able to bring herself to
the point of separation.Now and then a furry nose protruded from one of
the apertures and sniffed the welcome scent of pine and buttonball, red
and white clover, the thousand spicy odors of field and woodland."And so," said K. Le Moyne, "you liked it all?"Well, in one way, of course--you see, I didn't know it was quite like
that: all order and peace and quiet, and white beds and whispers, on
top,--you know what I mean,--and the misery there just the same.K. Le Moyne was stretched out on the grass, his arms under his head.For
this excursion to the end of the street-car line he had donned a pair
of white flannel trousers and a belted Norfolk coat.Sidney had been
divided between pride in his appearance and fear that the Street would
deem him overdressed.At her question he closed his eyes, shutting out the peaceful arch and
the bit of blue heaven overhead."Good gracious, I believe he's asleep!"said Sidney to the pasteboard
box.But he opened his eyes and smiled at her.I suppose now there is no question
about your going?""The superintendent said I was young, but that any protegee of Dr."It is hard work, night and day.""Do you think I am afraid of work?"He's taken all sorts of idiotic notions in his head.""Such as--"

"Well, he HATES the hospital, of course.As if, even if I meant to marry
him, it wouldn't be years before he can be ready.""Do you think you are quite fair to Joe?"If you have quite made up your mind not to,
better tell him, don't you think?Sidney considered, poking a slim finger into the little holes in the
box."You can see how stupid he is, and--and young.For one thing, he's
jealous of you!"Of course that is silly, although your attitude toward his
suspicion is hardly flattering to me.""I told him that I had asked you to bring me here to-day."He said I was flirting desperately with Dr.You see, the day
we went through the hospital, it was hot, and we went to Henderson's for
soda-water.K. Le Moyne was daily gaining the ability to see things from the angle
of the Street.A month ago he could have seen no situation in two
people, a man and a girl, drinking soda-water together, even with a boy
lover on the next stool.Now he could view things through Joe's tragic
eyes.All day he had noticed how inevitably
the conversation turned to the young surgeon.Did they start with
Reginald, with the condition of the morning-glory vines, with the
proposition of taking up the quaint paving-stones and macadamizing the
Street, they ended with the younger Wilson.Sidney's active young brain, turned inward for the first time in her
life, was still on herself."Mother is plaintively resigned--and Aunt Harriet has been a trump.I hope you noticed
that you got one of the apostle spoons with the custard she sent up
to you the other night.And she didn't object to this trip to-day.Of
course, as she said herself, it isn't as if you were young, or at all
wild."In spite of himself, K. was rather startled.He felt old enough, God
knew, but he had always thought of it as an age of the spirit.How old
did this child think he was?"I have promised to stay on, in the capacity of watch-dog,
burglar-alarm, and occasional recipient of an apostle spoon in a dish of
custard.Lightning-conductor, too--your mother says she isn't afraid of
storms if there is a man in the house.He rose to his feet and threw
back his fine shoulders."Aunt Harriet and your mother and Christine and her husband-to-be,
whatever his name is--we'll be a happy family.But, I warn you, if I
ever hear of Christine's husband getting an apostle spoon--"

She smiled up at him."You are looking very grand to-day.But you have
grass stains on your white trousers.Quite suddenly K. felt that she thought him too old for such frivolity
of dress."How old do you think I am, Miss Sidney?"She considered, giving him, after her kindly way, the benefit of the
doubt.It is middle age, of course, but it is not
senility.""Perhaps we'd better not tell mother," she said."You don't mind being
thought older?"Clearly the subject of his years did not interest her vitally, for she
harked back to the grass stains."I'm afraid you're not saving, as you promised.Those are new clothes,
aren't they?"Bought years ago in England--the coat in London, the
trousers in Bath, on a motor tour.Sidney must hear about England; and
she marveled politely, in view of his poverty, about his being there.Poor Le Moyne floundered in a sea of mendacity, rose to a truth here and
there, clutched at luncheon, and achieved safety at last."To think," said Sidney, "that you have really been across the ocean!I
never knew but one person who had been abroad.Le Moyne, unpacking sandwiches from a basket, was
aroused by a sheer resentment to an indiscretion."You like this Wilson chap pretty well, don't you?"He did not look up, but busied himself with the luncheon.When the
silence grew oppressive, he ventured to glance toward her.She was
leaning forward, her chin cupped in her palms, staring out over the
valley that stretched at their feet."Don't speak to me for a minute or two," she said."I'm thinking over
what you have just said."Manlike, having raised the issue, K. would have given much to evade it.Not that he had owned himself in love with Sidney.But into his loneliness and despair the girl had came like a ray of
light.She typified that youth and hope that he had felt slipping away
from him.Through her clear eyes he was beginning to see a new world.Lose her he must, and that he knew; but not this way.Down through the valley ran a shallow river, making noisy pretensions to
both depth and fury.He remembered just such a river in the Tyrol, with
this same Wilson on a rock, holding the hand of a pretty Austrian girl,
while he snapped the shutter of a camera.He had that picture somewhere
now; but the girl was dead, and, of the three, Wilson was the only one
who had met life and vanquished it."I've known him all my life," Sidney said at last."You're perfectly
right about one thing: I talk about him and I think about him.I'm being
candid, because what's the use of being friends if we're not frank?I admire him--you'd have to see him in the hospital, with every one
deferring to him and all that, to understand.And when you think of
a manlike that, who holds life and death in his hands, of course you
rather thrill.I--I honestly believe that's all there is to it.""If that's the whole thing, that's hardly a mad passion."He tried to
smile; succeeded faintly."Well, of course, there's this, too.I'll be one of forty nurses; indeed, for three months I'll be only a
probationer.He'll probably never even remember I'm in the hospital at
all."Then, if you thought he was in love with you, things would be
different?"Max Wilson was in love with me," said Sidney solemnly,
"I'd go out of my head with joy."One of the new qualities that K. Le Moyne was cultivating was of living
each day for itself.Having no past and no future, each day was worth
exactly what it brought.He was to look back to this day with mingled
feelings: sheer gladness at being out in the open with Sidney; the
memory of the shock with which he realized that she was, unknown to
herself, already in the throes of a romantic attachment for Wilson; and,
long, long after, when he had gone down to the depths with her and
saved her by his steady hand, with something of mirth for the untoward
happening that closed the day.They had released Reginald, released him with the tribute of a
shamefaced tear on Sidney's part, and a handful of chestnuts from K. The
little squirrel had squeaked his gladness, and, tail erect, had darted
into the grass."Do you
suppose he'll ever think of the nuts again, or find them?""He'll be all right," K. replied."The little beggar can take care of
himself, if only--"

"If only what?"He's apt to crawl into the pockets of
any one who happens around."To make up for his indiscretion, K. suggested a
descent to the river.She accepted eagerly, and he helped her down.That
was another memory that outlasted the day--her small warm hand in his;
the time she slipped and he caught her; the pain in her eyes at one of
his thoughtless remarks."I'm going to be pretty lonely," he said, when she had paused in the
descent and was taking a stone out of her low shoe."Reginald gone, and
you going!And then, seeing her
wince: "I've been whining all day.For Heaven's sake, don't look like
that.If there's one sort of man I detest more than another, it's a man
who is sorry for himself.Do you suppose your mother would object if
we stayed, out here at the hotel for supper?I've ordered a moon,
orange-yellow and extra size.""I should hate to have anything ordered and wasted.""I'll be thrifty as to moons while you are in the hospital."And, as it happened, Sidney had to stay, anyhow.For,
having perched herself out in the river on a sugar-loaf rock, she slid,
slowly but with a dreadful inevitability, into the water.K. happened
to be looking in another direction.So it occurred that at one moment,
Sidney sat on a rock, fluffy white from head to feet, entrancingly
pretty, and knowing it, and the next she was standing neck deep in
water, much too startled to scream, and trying to be dignified under the
rather trying circumstances."If you will be good enough," said Sidney, with her chin well up, "to
give me your hand or a pole or something--because if the river rises an
inch I shall drown."To his undying credit, K. Le Moyne did not laugh when he turned and saw
her.He went out on the sugar-loaf rock, and lifted her bodily up its
slippery sides.He had prodigious strength, in spite of his leanness.said Sidney, when they were both on the rock, carefully
balanced.Then,
remembering her manners, as the Street had it, she said primly:--

"Thank you for saving me.""There wasn't any danger, really, unless--unless the river had risen."And then, suddenly, he burst into delighted laughter, the first,
perhaps, for months.He shook with it, struggled at the sight of her
injured face to restrain it, achieved finally a degree of sobriety by
fixing his eyes on the river-bank."When you have quite finished," said Sidney severely, "perhaps you will
take me to the hotel.I dare say I shall have to be washed and ironed."Her wet skirts clung to her; her
shoes were sodden and heavy.She clung to him frantically, her eyes on
the river below.With the touch of her hands the man's mirth died.He held her very carefully, very tenderly, as one holds something
infinitely precious.It was a Wilson day, the
young surgeon having six cases.Max had
made was to change the hour for major operations from early morning to
mid-afternoon.He could do as well later in the day,--his nerves were
steady, and uncounted numbers of cigarettes did not make his hand
shake,--and he hated to get up early.The staff had fallen into the way of attending Wilson's operations.His
technique was good; but technique alone never gets a surgeon anywhere.Even the most jealous of that most jealous
of professions, surgery, had to admit that he got results.The last case had been
wheeled out of the elevator.The pit of the operating-room was
in disorder--towels everywhere, tables of instruments, steaming
sterilizers.Orderlies were going about, carrying out linens, emptying
pans.At a table two nurses were cleaning instruments and putting
them away in their glass cases.Irrigators were being emptied, sponges
recounted and checked off on written lists.In the midst of the confusion, Wilson stood giving last orders to the
interne at his elbow.As he talked he scoured his hands and arms with a
small brush; bits of lather flew off on to the tiled floor.At the hospital they said his nerves were iron;
there was no let-down after the day's work.The internes worshiped and
feared him.To be able to work like
that, so certainly, with so sure a touch, and to look like a Greek god!Wilson's only rival, a gynecologist named O'Hara, got results, too; but
he sweated and swore through his operations, was not too careful as to
asepsis, and looked like a gorilla.Two
or three probationers had been sent to help cleanup, and a senior nurse.Wilson's eyes caught the nurse's eyes as she passed him."Have they set you on my
trail?"With the eyes of the room on her, the girl answered primly:--

"I'm to be in your office in the mornings, Dr.Wilson, and anywhere I am
needed in the afternoons.""I shall take it when Miss Simpson comes back."Although he went on at once with his conversation with the interne, he
still heard the click of her heels about the room.He had not lost the
fact that she had flushed when he spoke to her.The mischief that was
latent in him came to the surface.When he had rinsed his hands, he
followed her, carrying the towel to where she stood talking to the
superintendent of the training school."Thanks very much, Miss Gregg," he said."I was sorry about that catgut.We have no trouble with what we prepare
ourselves.But with so many operations--"

He was in a magnanimous mood.He smiled' at Miss Gregg, who was elderly
and gray, but visibly his creature.It's the first time, and of course it will be the
last."He glanced over it, noting accurately sponges prepared, used, turned in.But he missed no gesture of the girl who stood beside Miss Gregg."That was a mighty pretty probationer
I brought you yesterday."Two small frowning lines appeared between Miss Harrison's dark brows.He caught them, caught her somber eyes too, and was amused and rather
stimulated."Prefer 'em young," said Dr.You'll
have to watch her, though.You'll have all the internes buzzing around,
neglecting business."She was divided between her disapproval
of internes at all times and of young probationers generally, and her
allegiance to the brilliant surgeon whose word was rapidly becoming law
in the hospital.When an emergency of the cleaning up called her away,
doubt still in her eyes, Wilson was left alone with Miss Harrison.He adopted the gentle, almost tender tone that made most women
his slaves."What are you going to do this evening?"Lectures are over for the summer.I shall go to prayers, and after that
to the roof for air."There was a note of bitterness in her voice.Under the eyes of the other
nurses, she was carefully contained.They might have been outlining the
morning's work at his office.She brought it obediently and poured it into his cupped hands.The
solutions of the operating-room played havoc with the skin: the
surgeons, and especially Wilson, soaked their hands plentifully with a
healing lotion.Over the bottle their eyes met again, and this time the girl smiled
faintly."Can't you take a little ride to-night and cool off?I'll have the car
wherever you say.A ride and some supper--how does it sound?You could
get away at seven--"

"Miss Gregg is coming!"With an impassive face, the girl took the bottle away.The workers
of the operating-room surged between them.An interne presented an
order-book; moppers had come in and waited to clean the tiled floor.There seemed no chance for Wilson to speak to Miss Harrison again.But he was clever with the guile of the pursuing male.Eyes of all on
him, he turned at the door of the wardrobe-room, where he would exchange
his white garments for street clothing, and spoke to her over the heads
of a dozen nurses."That patient's address that I had forgotten, Miss Harrison, is the
corner of the Park and Ellington Avenue."She played the game well, was quite calm.Certainly she was pretty, and certainly, too, she was interested in
him.The hurt to his pride of a few nights before was healed.He went
whistling into the wardrobe-room.As he turned he caught the interne's
eye, and there passed between them a glance of complete comprehension.His brother was there, listening to the comments
of O'Hara, his friendly rival.said O'Hara, and clapped a hairy hand on his shoulder.I'm proud of you, and your brother here is
indecently exalted.It was the Edwardes method, wasn't it?I saw it done
at his clinic in New York."Edwardes was a pal at mine in Berlin.A great
surgeon, too, poor old chap!""There aren't three men in the country with the nerve and the hand for
it."O'Hara went out, glowing with his own magnanimity.Deep in his heart
was a gnawing of envy--not for himself, but for his work.These young
fellows with no family ties, who could run over to Europe and bring back
anything new that was worth while, they had it all over the older men.Ed stood by and waited while his brother got into his street
clothes.There were many times when he wished that
their mother could have lived to see how he had carried out his promise
to "make a man of Max."Not that he took any
credit for Max's brilliant career--but he would have liked her to know
that things were going well.He had a picture of her over his office
desk.Sometimes he wondered what she would think of his own untidy
methods compared with Max's extravagant order--of the bag, for instance,
with the dog's collar in it, and other things.On these occasions he
always determined to clear out the bag."I guess I'll be getting along," he said.I'll--I'm going to run out of town, and eat where it's
cool."Max was newly home
from Europe, and Dr.Ed was selling a painfully acquired bond or two
to furnish the new offices downtown, the brothers had occasionally gone
together, by way of the trolley, to the White Springs Hotel for supper.Those had been gala days for the older man.To hear names that he had
read with awe, and mispronounced, most of his life, roll off Max's
tongue--"Old Steinmetz" and "that ass of a Heydenreich"; to hear the
medical and surgical gossip of the Continent, new drugs, new technique,
the small heart-burnings of the clinics, student scandal--had brought
into his drab days a touch of color.Max had new
friends, new social obligations; his time was taken up.And pride would
not allow the older brother to show how he missed the early days.Forty-two he was, and; what with sleepless nights and twenty years of
hurried food, he looked fifty.Fifty, then, to Max's thirty.It's a pity to cook a roast for one."Wasteful, too, this cooking of food for two and only one to eat it.A
roast of beef meant a visit, in Dr.He
still paid the expenses of the house on the Street."Sorry, old man; I've made another arrangement."Everywhere the younger man received the
homage of success.The elevator-man bowed and flung the doors open,
with a smile; the pharmacy clerk, the doorkeeper, even the convalescent
patient who was polishing the great brass doorplate, tendered their
tribute.Ed stood for a moment with his
hand on the car."I was thinking, up there this afternoon," he said slowly, "that I'm not
sure I want Sidney Page to become a nurse.""There's a good deal in life that a girl need not know--not, at least,
until her husband tells her.Sidney's been guarded, and it's bound to be
a shock."For the moment, at least, the younger Wilson had
no interest in Sidney Page.Plenty of other girls have taken the training
and come through without spoiling their zest for life."Already, as the car moved off, his mind was on his appointment for the
evening.Sidney, after her involuntary bath in the river, had gone into temporary
eclipse at the White Springs Hotel.In the oven of the kitchen stove sat
her two small white shoes, stuffed with paper so that they might dry
in shape.Back in a detached laundry, a sympathetic maid was ironing
various soft white garments, and singing as she worked.Sidney sat in a rocking-chair in a hot bedroom.She was carefully
swathed in a sheet from neck to toes, except for her arms, and she was
being as philosophic as possible.After all, it was a good chance to
think things over.She had very little time to think, generally.Well,
there was that to think over and a matter of probation dresses to be
talked over later with her Aunt Harriet.Also, there was a great deal of
advice to K. Le Moyne, who was ridiculously extravagant, before trusting
the house to him.She folded her white arms and prepared to think over
all these things.As a matter of fact, she went mentally, like an arrow
to its mark, to the younger Wilson--to his straight figure in its white
coat, to his dark eyes and heavy hair, to the cleft in his chin when he
smiled."You know, I have always been more than half in love with you myself..."

Some one tapped lightly at the door.She was back again in the stuffy
hotel room, clutching the sheet about her.Whatever visions K. Le Moyne may have had of a chill or of a feverish
cold were dispelled by that."The moon has arrived, as per specifications.Shall we eat on the
terrace?""I have never eaten on a terrace in my life.K. Le Moyne assured her through the door that he would order a salad,
and prepared to descend.But he stood for a moment in front of the closed door, for the mere
sound of her moving, beyond it.Things had gone very far with the Pages'
roomer that day in the country; not so far as they were to go, but far
enough to let him see on the brink of what misery he stood.He had promised her to stay: he was needed.He
thought he could have endured seeing her marry Joe, had she cared for
the boy.That way, at least, lay safety for her.The boy had fidelity
and devotion written large over him.But this new complication--her
romantic interest in Wilson, the surgeon's reciprocal interest in her,
with what he knew of the man--made him quail.From the top of the narrow staircase to the foot, and he had lived
a year's torment!At the foot, however, he was startled out of his
reverie.Joe Drummond stood there waiting for him, his blue eyes
recklessly alight.Le Moyne took the frenzied boy by
the elbow and led him past the door to the empty porch."Now," he said, "if you will keep your voice down, I'll listen to what
you have to say.""You know what I've got to say."This failing to draw from K. Le Moyne anything but his steady glance,
Joe jerked his arm free, and clenched his fist."What did you bring her out here for?""I do not know that I owe you any explanation, but I am willing to
give you one.I brought her out here for a trolley ride and a picnic
luncheon.Incidentally we brought the ground squirrel out and set him
free."Life not having been all beer and skittles to
him, he knew that Joe was suffering, and was marvelously patient with
him."She had the misfortune to fall in the river.And,
seeing the light of unbelief in Joe's eyes: "If you care to make a tour
of investigation, you will find that I am entirely truthful.In the
laundry a maid--"

"She is engaged to me"--doggedly."Everybody in the neighborhood knows
it; and yet you bring her out here for a picnic!It's--it's damned
rotten treatment."Before K. Le Moyne's eyes his own fell.He felt
suddenly young and futile; his just rage turned to blustering in his
ears."Even in that case, isn't it rather arrogant to say that--that the young
lady in question can accept no ordinary friendly attentions from another
man?"Utter astonishment left Joe almost speechless.The Street, of course,
regarded an engagement as a setting aside of the affianced couple, an
isolation of two, than which marriage itself was not more a solitude a
deux.After a moment:--

"I don't know where you came from," he said, "but around here decent men
cut out when a girl's engaged.""What's more, what do we know about you?Even at your office they don't know anything.You may be
all right, but how do I know it?And, even if you are, renting a room in
the Page house doesn't entitle you to interfere with the family.You get
her into trouble and I'll kill you!"It took courage, that speech, with K. Le Moyne towering five inches
above him and growing a little white about the lips."Are you going to say all these things to Sidney?""Does she allow you to call her Sidney?"And I am going to find out why you were upstairs just now."Perhaps never in his twenty-two years had young Drummond been so near a
thrashing.Fury that he was ashamed of shook Le Moyne.For very fear of
himself, he thrust his hands in the pockets of his Norfolk coat."You go to her with just one of these ugly
insinuations, and I'll take mighty good care that you are sorry for it.You're younger than I am, and lighter.But
if you are going to behave like a bad child, you deserve a licking, and
I'll give it to you."An overflow from the parlor poured out on the porch.Le Moyne had got
himself in hand somewhat.He was still angry, but the look in Joe's eyes
startled him.He put a hand on the boy's shoulder."You're wrong, old man," he said."You're insulting the girl you care
for by the things you are thinking.And, if it's any comfort to you, I
have no intention of interfering in any way.Joe picked his straw hat from a chair and stood
turning it in his hands."Even if you don't care for her, how do I know she isn't crazy about
you?""My word of honor, she isn't.""Just to clear the air, I'll show it to you.Into the breast pocket of his coat he dived and brought up a wallet.The wallet had had a name on it in gilt letters that had been carefully
scraped off.But Joe did not wait to see the note.he said--and went swiftly down the steps and
into the gathering twilight of the June night.It was only when he reached the street-car, and sat huddled in a corner,
that he remembered something.Only about the hospital--but Le Moyne had kept the note, treasured it!Joe was not subtle, not even clever; but he was a lover, and he knew the
ways of love.The Pages' roomer was in love with Sidney whether he knew
it or not.CHAPTER VII


Carlotta Harrison pleaded a headache, and was excused from the
operating-room and from prayers."I'm sorry about the vacation," Miss Gregg said kindly, "but in a day or
two I can let you off.The girl managed to dissemble the triumph in her eyes."Thank you," she said languidly, and turned away.Then: "About the
vacation, I am not in a hurry.If Miss Simpson needs a few days to
straighten things out, I can stay on with Dr.Young women on the eve of a vacation were not usually so reasonable.I wish more of the girls
were as thoughtful, with the house full and operations all day and every
day."Outside the door of the anaesthetizing-room Miss Harrison's languor
vanished.She sped along corridors and up the stairs, not waiting for
the deliberate elevator.Inside of her room, she closed and bolted the
door, and, standing before her mirror, gazed long at her dark eyes and
bright hair.Though she was only three years older
than Sidney, her experience of life was as of three to Sidney's one.The product of a curious marriage,--when Tommy Harrison of Harrison's
Minstrels, touring Spain with his troupe, had met the pretty daughter of
a Spanish shopkeeper and eloped with her,--she had certain qualities of
both, a Yankee shrewdness and capacity that made her a capable nurse,
complicated by occasional outcroppings of southern Europe, furious
bursts of temper, slow and smouldering vindictiveness.A passionate
creature, in reality, smothered under hereditary Massachusetts caution.She was well aware of the risks of the evening's adventure.The only
dread she had was of the discovery of her escapade by the hospital
authorities.Nurses were forbidden more than
the exchange of professional conversation with the staff.In that
world of her choosing, of hard work and little play, of service and
self-denial and vigorous rules of conduct, discovery meant dismissal.She put on a soft black dress, open at the throat, and with a wide white
collar and cuffs of some sheer material.Her yellow hair was drawn high
under her low black hat.From her Spanish mother she had learned to
please the man, not herself.Max would wish her to
be inconspicuous, and she dressed accordingly.Then, being a cautious
person, she disarranged her bed slightly and thumped a hollow into
her pillow.The nurses' rooms were subject to inspection, and she had
pleaded a headache.Max, driving up to the corner five minutes
late, found her there, quite matter-of-fact but exceedingly handsome,
and acknowledged the evening's adventure much to his taste."A little air first, and then supper--how's that?"He turned the car toward the suburbs, and then, bending toward her,
smiled into her eyes."I'm cool for the first time to-day."Even Wilson's superb nerves had
felt the strain of the afternoon, and under the girl's dark eyes were
purplish shadows.She leaned back, weary but luxuriously content.I've driven
Miss Simpson about a lot."It was almost eight when he turned the car into the drive of the White
Springs Hotel.The six-to-eight supper was almost over.One or two motor
parties were preparing for the moonlight drive back to the city.All
around was virgin country, sweet with early summer odors of new-cut
grass, of blossoming trees and warm earth.On the grass terrace over the
valley, where ran Sidney's unlucky river, was a magnolia full of creamy
blossoms among waxed leaves.Its silhouette against the sky was quaintly
heart-shaped.Under her mask of languor, Carlotta's heart was beating wildly.Let him lose his head a little; she could keep
hers.If she were skillful and played things right, who could tell?To
marry him, to leave behind the drudgery of the hospital, to feel safe as
she had not felt for years, that was a stroke to play for!She reached up and, breaking off one
of the heavy-scented flowers, placed it in the bosom of her black dress.Sidney and K. Le Moyne were dining together.The novelty of the
experience had made her eyes shine like stars.She saw only the magnolia
tree shaped like a heart, the terrace edged with low shrubbery, and
beyond the faint gleam that was the river.For her the dish-washing
clatter of the kitchen was stilled, the noises from the bar were lost in
the ripple of the river; the scent of the grass killed the odor of stale
beer that wafted out through the open windows.The unshaded glare of the
lights behind her in the house was eclipsed by the crescent edge of the
rising moon.Sidney was experiencing the rare treat of
after-dinner coffee.Le Moyne, grave and contained, sat across from her.To give so much
pleasure, and so easily!No wonder the
boy was mad about her.Another table was being brought; they were not to
be alone.But, what roused him in violent resentment only appealed to
Sidney's curiosity."A box of candy against a good cigar, they are a stolid married couple."If they loll back and watch the kitchen door, I win.If
they lean forward, elbows on the table, and talk, you get the candy."Sidney, who had been leaning forward, talking eagerly over the table,
suddenly straightened and flushed.Although the tapping of her heels was
dulled by the grass, although she had exchanged her cap for the black
hat, Sidney knew her at once.Was it possible--but of
course not!The book of rules stated explicitly that such things were
forbidden."Don't turn around," she said swiftly."It is the Miss Harrison I told
you about.Carlotta's eyes were blinded for a moment by the glare of the house
lights.She dropped into her chair, with a flash of resentment at the
proximity of the other table.Then she sat up, her eyes on Le Moyne's grave profile turned toward the
valley.Lucky for her that Wilson had stopped in the bar, that Sidney's
instinctive good manners forbade her staring, that only the edge of the
summer moon shone through the trees.She went white and clutched the
edge of the table, with her eyes closed.She was always seeing him even in
her dreams.K. Le
Moyne, quite unconscious of her presence, looked down into the valley.Wilson appeared on the wooden porch above the terrace, and stood, his
eyes searching the half light for her.If he came down to her, the man
at the next table might turn, would see her--

She rose and went swiftly back toward the hotel.All the gayety was
gone out of the evening for her, but she forced a lightness she did not
feel:--

"It is so dark and depressing out there--it makes me sad.""Surely you do not want to dine in the house?"The prospect of the glaring lights and soiled
linen of the dining-room jarred on his aesthetic sense.He wanted a
setting for himself, for the girl.But
when, in the full light of the moon, he saw the purplish shadows under
her eyes, he forgot his resentment.He leaned over and ran his and
caressingly along her bare forearm."Your wish is my law--to-night," he said softly.After all, the evening was a disappointment to him.The spontaneity had
gone out of it, for some reason.The girl who had thrilled to his glance
those two mornings in his office, whose somber eyes had met his fire for
fire, across the operating-room, was not playing up.She sat back in her
chair, eating little, starting at every step.Her eyes, which by every
rule of the game should have been gazing into his, were fixed on the
oilcloth-covered passage outside the door."I think, after all, you are frightened!""A little danger adds to the zest of things.You know what Nietzsche
says about that."Then, with an effort: "What does he say?""Two things are wanted by the true man--danger and play.Therefore he
seeketh woman as the most dangerous of toys.""Women are dangerous only when you think of them as toys.When a man
finds that a woman can reason,--do anything but feel,--he regards her
as a menace.But the reasoning woman is really less dangerous than the
other sort."To talk careful abstractions like
this, with beneath each abstraction its concealed personal application,
to talk of woman and look in her eyes, to discuss new philosophies with
their freedoms, to discard old creeds and old moralities--that was
his game.She challenged his philosophy and gave him a chance to
defend it.With the conviction, as their meal went on, that Le Moyne and
his companion must surely have gone, she gained ease.It was only by wild driving that she got back to the hospital by ten
o'clock.Wilson left her at the corner, well content with himself.He had had the
rest he needed in congenial company.Even if she talked, there was nothing to tell.But
he felt confident that she would not talk.As he drove up the Street, he glanced across at the Page house.Sidney
was there on the doorstep, talking to a tall man who stood below and
looked up at her.Sidney was a
mighty pretty girl.He was sorry he had
not kissed Carlotta good-night.He rather thought, now he looked back,
she had expected it.As he got out of his car at the curb, a young man who had been standing
in the shadow of the tree-box moved quickly away.CHAPTER VIII


Sidney entered the hospital as a probationer early in August.Christine
was to be married in September to Palmer Howe, and, with Harriet and K.
in the house, she felt that she could safely leave her mother.The balcony outside the parlor was already under way.On the night
before she went away, Sidney took chairs out there and sat with her
mother until the dew drove Anna to the lamp in the sewing-room and her
"Daily Thoughts" reading.Sidney sat alone and viewed her world from this new and pleasant
angle.She could see the garden and the whitewashed fence with its
morning-glories, and at the same time, by turning her head, view the
Wilson house across the Street.K. Le Moyne was upstairs in his room.She could hear him tramping up and
down, and catch, occasionally, the bitter-sweet odor of his old brier
pipe.All the small loose ends of her life were gathered up--except Joe.She
would have liked to get that clear, too.She wanted him to know how she
felt about it all: that she liked him as much as ever, that she did not
want to hurt him.But she wanted to make it clear, too, that she knew
now that she would never marry him.She thought she would never marry;
but, if she did, it would be a man doing a man's work in the world.Her
eyes turned wistfully to the house across the Street.'s lamp still burned overhead, but his restless tramping about had
ceased.He must be reading--he read a great deal.A neighborhood cat came stealthily across the Street, and stared
up at the little balcony with green-glowing eyes."Come on, Bill Taft," she said."Reginald is gone, so you are welcome.Joe Drummond, passing the house for the fourth time that evening, heard
her voice, and hesitated uncertainly on the pavement."It's late; I'd better get home.""You're not very kind to me, Joe."Isn't the kindest thing I can do
to keep out of your way?""Not if you are hating me all the time.""Then why haven't you been to see me?If I have done anything--" Her
voice was a-tingle with virtue and outraged friendship."You haven't done anything but--show me where I get off."He sat down on the edge of the balcony and stared out blankly."If that's the way you feel about it--"

"I'm not blaming you.I was a fool to think you'd ever care about me.I
don't know that I feel so bad--about the thing.I've been around seeing
some other girls, and I notice they're glad to see me, and treat me
right, too."There was boyish bravado in his voice."But what makes me
sick is to have everyone saying you've jilted me.""Well, we look at it in different ways; that's all.Then suddenly all his carefully conserved indifference fled.He bent
forward quickly and, catching her hand, held it against his lips.The cat, finding no active antagonism, sprang up on the balcony and
rubbed against the boy's quivering shoulders; a breath of air stroked
the morning-glory vine like the touch of a friendly hand.Sidney,
facing for the first time the enigma of love and despair sat, rather
frightened, in her chair.If it wasn't for the folks, I'd jump in the
river.I lied when I said I'd been to see other girls."No girl's worth what I've been going through," he retorted bitterly.I don't eat; I don't sleep--I'm afraid
sometimes of the way I feel.When I saw you at the White Springs with
that roomer chap--"

"Ah!"If I'd had a gun I'd have killed him.I thought--" So far, out of sheer
pity, she had left her hand in his.But he made a clutch at his self-respect.He was acting like a crazy
boy, and he was a man, all of twenty-two!"You'll be
seeing him every day, I suppose."I shall also be seeing twenty or thirty other doctors, and
a hundred or so men patients, not to mention visitors."No," he said heavily, "I'm not.If it's got to be someone, Sidney, I'd
rather have it the roomer upstairs than Wilson.There's a lot of talk
about Wilson.""It isn't necessary to malign my friends.""I thought perhaps, since you are going away, you would let me keep
Reginald."One would think I was about to die!I set Reginald free that day in the
country.You'll come to see me now and then, won't you?""If I do, do you think you may change your mind?""I've got to fight this out alone, and the less I see of you the
better."If I see him playing any of his tricks around
you--well, he'd better look out!"That, as it turned out, was Joe's farewell.He gave her a long look, blinked, and walked rapidly out
to the Street.Some of the dignity of his retreat was lost by the fact
that the cat followed him, close at his heels.If this was love, she did not want
it--this strange compound of suspicion and despair, injured pride and
threats.Lovers in fiction were of two classes--the accepted ones, who
loved and trusted, and the rejected ones, who took themselves away in
despair, but at least took themselves away.The thought of a future
with Joe always around a corner, watching her, obsessed her.She even shed a tear or two, very surreptitiously;
and then, being human and much upset, and the cat startling her by its
sudden return and selfish advances, she shooed it off the veranda and
set an imaginary dog after it.Whereupon, feeling somewhat better, she
went in and locked the balcony window and proceeded upstairs.There was a movement inside, the sound of a book put down."I may not see you in the morning.From the sounds, she judged that he was putting on his shabby gray
coat.The next moment he had opened the door and stepped out into the
corridor.I started downstairs a while ago, but you had a
visitor."He knows now that I--that I shall not marry him.""I believe you think I should have married him.""I am only putting myself in his place and realizing--When do you
leave?"Then, hurriedly:--

"I got a little present for you--nothing much, but your mother was quite
willing.He went back into his room, and returned with a small box."With all sorts of good luck," he said, and placed it in her hands.Because, if you would rather have something else--"

She opened the box with excited fingers.Ticking away on its satin bed
was a small gold watch."You'll need it, you see," he explained nervously, "It wasn't
extravagant under the circumstances.Your mother's watch, which you had
intended to take, had no second-hand.You'll need a second-hand to take
pulses, you know.""A watch," said Sidney, eyes on it."A dear little watch, to pin on and
not put in a pocket."I was afraid you might think it presumptuous," he said."I haven't any
right, of course.I thought of flowers--but they fade and what have you?You said that, you know, about Joe's roses.And then, your mother said
you wouldn't be offended--"

"Don't apologize for making me so happy!"After that she must pin it on, and slip in to stand before his mirror
and inspect the result.It gave Le Moyne a queer thrill to see her there
in the room among his books and his pipes.It make him a little sick,
too, in view of to-morrow and the thousand-odd to-morrows when she would
not be there."I've kept you up shamefully,'" she said at last, "and you get up so
early.I shall write you a note from the hospital, delivering a little
lecture on extravagance--because how can I now, with this joy shining on
me?And about how to keep Katie in order about your socks, and all sorts
of things.She had moved to the door, and he followed her, stooping a little to
pass under the low chandelier."Good-bye--and God bless you."She went out, and he closed the door softly behind her.CHAPTER IX


Sidney never forgot her early impressions of the hospital, although they
were chaotic enough at first.There were uniformed young women
coming and going, efficient, cool-eyed, low of voice.There were
medicine-closets with orderly rows of labeled bottles, linen-rooms with
great stacks of sheets and towels, long vistas of shining floors and
lines of beds.There were brisk internes with duck clothes and brass
buttons, who eyed her with friendly, patronizing glances.There were
bandages and dressings, and great white screens behind which were played
little or big dramas, baths or deaths, as the case might be.And over
all brooded the mysterious authority of the superintendent of the
training-school, dubbed the Head, for short.Twelve hours a day, from seven to seven, with the off-duty intermission,
Sidney labored at tasks which revolted her soul.She swept and
dusted the wards, cleaned closets, folded sheets and towels, rolled
bandages--did everything but nurse the sick, which was what she had come
to do.She sat on the edge of her narrow white
bed and soaked her aching feet in hot water and witch hazel, and
practiced taking pulses on her own slender wrist, with K.Out of all the long, hot days, two periods stood out clearly, to be
waited for and cherished.One was when, early in the afternoon, with
the ward in spotless order, the shades drawn against the August sun, the
tables covered with their red covers, and the only sound the drone of
the bandage-machine as Sidney steadily turned it, Dr.Max passed the
door on his way to the surgical ward beyond, and gave her a cheery
greeting.At these times Sidney's heart beat almost in time with the
ticking of the little watch.The other hour was at twilight, when, work over for the day, the night
nurse, with her rubber-soled shoes and tired eyes and jangling keys,
having reported and received the night orders, the nurses gathered in
their small parlor for prayers.It was months before Sidney got over the
exaltation of that twilight hour, and never did it cease to bring her
healing and peace.In a way, it crystallized for her what the day's work
meant: charity and its sister, service, the promise of rest and peace.Into the little parlor filed the nurses, and knelt, folding their tired
hands."The Lord is my shepherd," read the Head out of her worn Bible; "I shall
not want."And the nurses: "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth
me beside the still waters."And so on through the psalm to the assurance at the end, "And I will
dwell in the house of the Lord forever."Now and then there was a death
behind one of the white screens.It caused little change in the routine
of the ward.A nurse stayed behind the screen, and her work was done by
the others.When everything was over, the time was recorded exactly on
the record, and the body was taken away.At first it seemed to Sidney that she could not stand this nearness to
death.She thought the nurses hard because they took it quietly.Then
she found that it was only stoicism, resignation, that they had learned.These things must be, and the work must go on.Some such patient detachment must be that of the
angels who keep the Great Record.On her first Sunday half-holiday she was free in the morning, and went
to church with her mother, going back to the hospital after the service.So it was two weeks before she saw Le Moyne again.Even then, it was
only for a short time.Christine and Palmer Howe came in to see her, and
to inspect the balcony, now finished.But Sidney and Le Moyne had a few words together first.She was
a trifle subdued, with a puzzled look in her blue eyes.Her mouth was
tender, as always, but he thought it drooped.There was a new atmosphere
of wistfulness about the girl that made his heart ache.They were alone in the little parlor with its brown lamp and blue silk
shade, and its small nude Eve--which Anna kept because it had been a
gift from her husband, but retired behind a photograph of the minister,
so that only the head and a bare arm holding the apple appeared above
the reverend gentleman.K. never smoked in the parlor, but by sheer force of habit he held the
pipe in his teeth.Aunt Harriet, who left you her love,
has had the complete order for the Lorenz trousseau.She and I have
picked out a stunning design for the wedding dress.I thought I'd ask
you about the veil.Do you like this new
fashion of draping the veil from behind the coiffure in the back--"

Sidney had been sitting on the edge of her chair, staring."There," she said--"I knew it!They're making an
old woman of you already.""Miss Lorenz likes the new method, but my personal preference is for the
old way, with the bride's face covered.""Katie has a new prescription--recipe--for bread.It has more bread and
fewer air-holes.One cake of yeast--"

Sidney sprang to her feet."Because you rent a room in
this house is no reason why you should give up your personality and
your--intelligence.But Katie has
made bread without masculine assistance for a good many years, and if
Christine can't decide about her own veil she'd better not get married.Mother says you water the flowers every evening, and lock up the house
before you go to bed.I--I never meant you to adopt the family!"K. removed his pipe and gazed earnestly into the bowl."Bill Taft has had kittens under the porch," he said."And the
groceryman has been sending short weight.We've bought scales now, and
weigh everything.""Dear child, I am doing these things because I like to do them.For--for
some time I've been floating, and now I've got a home.Every time I
lock up the windows at night, or cut a picture out of a magazine as a
suggestion to your Aunt Harriet, it's an anchor to windward."Sidney gazed helplessly at his imperturbable face.He seemed older than
she had recalled him: the hair over his ears was almost white.That was Palmer Howe's age, and Palmer seemed like a
boy.But he held himself more erect than he had in the first days of his
occupancy of the second-floor front."And now," he said cheerfully, "what about yourself?You've lost a lot
of illusions, of course, but perhaps you've gained ideals."Life," observed Sidney, with the wisdom of two weeks out in the world,
"life is a terrible thing, K. We think we've got it, and--it's got us.""When I think of how simple I used to think it all was!One grew up and
got married, and--and perhaps had children.And when one got very
old, one died.Lately, I've been seeing that life really consists of
exceptions--children who don't grow up, and grown-ups who die before
they are old.And"--this took an effort, but she looked at him
squarely--"and people who have children, but are not married."All knowledge that is worth while hurts in the getting."Sidney got up and wandered around the room, touching its little familiar
objects with tender hands.There was this curious
element in his love for her, that when he was with her it took on the
guise of friendship and deceived even himself.It was only in the lonely
hours that it took on truth, became a hopeless yearning for the touch of
her hand or a glance from her clear eyes.Sidney, having picked up the minister's picture, replaced it absently,
so that Eve stood revealed in all her pre-apple innocence."There is something else," she said absently."I cannot talk it over
with mother.There is a girl in the ward--"

"A patient?"She has had typhoid, but she is a little
better."At first I couldn't bear to go near her.I shivered when I had to
straighten her bed.I--I'm being very frank, but I've got to talk this
out with someone.I worried a lot about it, because, although at first I
hated her, now I don't.She looked at K. defiantly, but there was no disapproval in his eyes.She'll be able to
go out soon.Don't you think something ought to be done to keep her
from--going back?"She was so young to face all this;
and yet, since face it she must, how much better to have her do it
squarely."Does she want to change her mode of life?"She
cares a great deal for some man.The other day I propped her up in bed
and gave her a newspaper, and after a while I found the paper on the
floor, and she was crying.The other patients avoid her, and it was
some time before I noticed it.The next day she told me that the man
was going to marry some one else.'He wouldn't marry me, of course,' she
said; 'but he might have told me.'"Le Moyne did his best, that afternoon in the little parlor, to provide
Sidney with a philosophy to carry her through her training.He told her
that certain responsibilities were hers, but that she could not reform
the world.Broad charity, tenderness, and healing were her province."Help them all you can," he finished, feeling inadequate and hopelessly
didactic."Cure them; send them out with a smile; and--leave the rest to
the Almighty."Sidney was resigned, but not content.Newly facing the evil of the
world, she was a rampant reformer at once.Only the arrival of Christine
and her fiance saved his philosophy from complete rout.He had time for
a question between the ring of the bell and Katie's deliberate progress
from the kitchen to the front door.He stops at the door of the ward and speaks to me.It
makes me quite distinguished, for a probationer.Usually, you know, the
staff never even see the probationers.""I think he is very wonderful," said Sidney valiantly.Christine Lorenz, while not large, seemed to fill the little room.Her
voice, which was frequent and penetrating, her smile, which was wide
and showed very white teeth that were a trifle large for beauty, her
all-embracing good nature, dominated the entire lower floor.K., who had
met her before, retired into silence and a corner.Young Howe smoked a
cigarette in the hall.said Christine, and put her cheek against Sidney's.Palmer gives you a month to tire of it
all; but I said--"

"I take that back," Palmer spoke indolently from the corridor."There
is the look of willing martyrdom in her face.I've
brought some nuts for him.""Reginald is back in the woods again.""Now, look here," he said solemnly."When we arranged about these rooms,
there were certain properties that went with them--the lady next door
who plays Paderewski's 'Minuet' six hours a day, and K. here, and
Reginald.If you must take something to the woods, why not the minuet
person?"Howe was a good-looking man, thin, smooth-shaven, aggressively well
dressed.This Sunday afternoon, in a cutaway coat and high hat, with
an English malacca stick, he was just a little out of the picture.The
Street said that he was "wild," and that to get into the Country Club
set Christine was losing more than she was gaining.Christine had stepped out on the balcony, and was speaking to K. just
inside."It's rather a queer way to live, of course," she said."But Palmer is a
pauper, practically.We are going to take our meals at home for a while.You see, certain things that we want we can't have if we take a house--a
car, for instance.We'll need one for running out to the Country Club to
dinner.Of course, unless father gives me one for a wedding present, it
will be a cheap one.And we're getting the Rosenfeld boy to drive it.He's crazy about machinery, and he'll come for practically nothing."K. had never known a married couple to take two rooms and go to the
bride's mother's for meals in order to keep a car.Also, certain sophistries of his former world about a cheap
chauffeur being costly in the end rose in his mind and were carefully
suppressed."You'll find a car a great comfort, I'm sure," he said politely.She liked his graying hair
and steady eyes, and insisted on considering his shabbiness a pose.She
was conscious that she made a pretty picture in the French window, and
preened herself like a bright bird."You'll come out with us now and then, I hope.""Isn't it odd to think that we are going to be practically one family!"He caught the flash of Christine's smile, and smiled back.Christine was
glad she had decided to take the rooms, glad that K. lived there.This
thing of marriage being the end of all things was absurd.A married
woman should have men friends; they kept her up.She would take him to
the Country Club.Across the Street, the Rosenfeld boy had stopped by Dr.Wilson's car,
and was eyeing it with the cool, appraising glance of the street
boy whose sole knowledge of machinery has been acquired from the
clothes-washer at home.Joe Drummond, eyes carefully ahead, went up the
Street.McKee's, stood in the doorway and fanned herself
with her apron.Max Wilson came out of the house and got into his car.For a minute, perhaps, all the actors, save Carlotta and Dr.It was that bete noir of the playwright, an ensemble; K. Le
Moyne and Sidney, Palmer Howe, Christine, Tillie, the younger Wilson,
Joe, even young Rosenfeld, all within speaking distance, almost touching
distance, gathered within and about the little house on a side street
which K. at first grimly and now tenderly called "home."CHAPTER X


On Monday morning, shortly after the McKee prolonged breakfast was over,
a small man of perhaps fifty, with iron-gray hair and a sparse goatee,
made his way along the Street.He moved with the air of one having a
definite destination but a by no means definite reception.As he walked along he eyed with a professional glance the ailanthus and
maple trees which, with an occasional poplar, lined the Street.McKee's boarding-house he stopped.Owing to a slight change
in the grade of the street, the McKee house had no stoop, but one flat
doorstep.Thus it was possible to ring the doorbell from the pavement,
and this the stranger did.It gave him a curious appearance of being
ready to cut and run if things were unfavorable.She recognized him at once, but no smile met the nervous one
that formed itself on the stranger's face."Oh, it's you, is it?""I was thinking, as I came along," he said, "that you and the neighbors
had better get after these here caterpillars."If you want to see Tillie, she's busy.""I only want to say how-d 'ye-do.A certain doggedness took the place of his tentative smile."I'll say it to myself, I guess.I don't want any unpleasantness, but
I've come a good ways to see her and I'll hang around until I do."McKee knew herself routed, and retreated to the kitchen."You're wanted out front," she said.Only, my advice to you is, don't be a fool."The hands with which she tied a white apron
over her gingham one were shaking.Her visitor had accepted the open door as permission to enter and was
standing in the hall.He went rather white himself when he saw Tillie coming toward him down
the hall.He knew that for Tillie this visit would mean that he was
free--and he was not free.Sheer terror of his errand filled him."Well, here I am, Tillie."said poor Tillie, with the
question in her eyes."I was passing through, and I just thought I'd call around and tell
you--My God, Tillie, I'm glad to see you!"She made no reply, but opened the door into the cool and, shaded little
parlor.He followed her in and closed the door behind him.Playing with paper dolls--that's the latest."Tillie sat down suddenly on one of the stiff chairs.Her lips were as
white as her face."I thought, when I saw you--"

"I was afraid you'd think that."Tillie's hands twisted nervously in her lap.Schwitter's eyes were fixed on the window, which looked back on the
McKee yard."That spiraea back there's not looking very good.If you'll save the
cigar butts around here and put them in water, and spray it, you'll kill
the lice.""I don't know why you come around bothering me," she said dully."I've
been getting along all right; now you come and upset everything."Schwitter rose and took a step toward her."Well, I'll tell you why I came.I ain't getting any
younger, am I?Time's going on, and I'm wanting you all the time.What've I got out of life, anyhow?"What's that got to do with me?""You're lonely, too, ain't you?"And, anyhow, there's always a crowd
here.""You can be lonely in a crowd, and I guess--is there any one around here
you like better than me?""We can talk our heads off and
not get anywhere.You've got a wife living, and, unless you intend to do
away with her, I guess that's all there is to it."Haven't you got a right to be happy?"She was quick of wit, and she read his tone as well as his words."You get out of here--and get out quick!"She had jumped to her feet; but he only looked at her with understanding
eyes."That's the way I thought of it at first.Maybe I've
just got used to the idea, but it doesn't seem so bad to me now.Here
are you, drudging for other people when you ought to have a place all
your own--and not gettin' younger any more than I am.Here's both of us
lonely.I'd be a good husband to you, Till--because, whatever it'd be in
law, I'd be your husband before God."Tillie cowered against the door, her eyes on his.Here before her,
embodied in this man, stood all that she had wanted and never had.He
meant a home, tenderness, children, perhaps.He turned away from the
look in her eyes and stared out of the front window."Them poplars out there ought to be taken away," he said heavily.Tillie found her voice at last:--

"I couldn't do it, Mr."Perhaps, if you got used to the idea--"

"What's that to do with the right and wrong of it?"It seems to
me that the Lord would make an exception of us if He knew the
circumstances.Perhaps, after you get used to the idea--What I thought
was like this.I've got a little farm about seven miles from the city
limits, and the tenant on it says that nearly every Sunday somebody
motors out from town and wants a chicken-and-waffle supper.There ain't
much in the nursery business anymore.These landscape fellows buy their
stuff direct, and the middleman's out.I've got a good orchard, and
there's a spring, so I could put running water in the house.I'd be good
to you, Tillie,--I swear it."Don't a man respect a woman that's got courage enough to give up
everything for him?"Tillie was crying softly into her apron.He put a work-hardened hand on
her head."It isn't as if I'd run around after women," he said."You're the only
one, since Maggie--" He drew a long breath."I'll give you time to think
it over.Suppose I stop in to-morrow morning.It doesn't commit you to
anything to talk it over."There had been no passion in the interview, and there was none in
the touch of his hand.He was not young, and the tragic loneliness of
approaching old age confronted him.He was trying to solve his problem
and Tillie's, and what he had found was no solution, but a compromise."To-morrow morning, then," he said quietly, and went out the door.All that hot August morning Tillie worked in a daze.McKee watched
her and said nothing.She interpreted the girl's white face and set lips
as the result of having had to dismiss Schwitter again, and looked for
time to bring peace, as it had done before.Le Moyne came late to his midday meal.For once, the mental anaesthesia
of endless figures had failed him.On his way home he had drawn his
small savings from the bank, and mailed them, in cash and registered, to
a back street in the slums of a distant city.He had done this before,
and always with a feeling of exaltation, as if, for a time at least,
the burden he carried was lightened.But to-day he experienced no
compensatory relief.Life was dull and stale to him, effort ineffectual.At thirty a man should look back with tenderness, forward with hope.K.
Le Moyne dared not look back, and had no desire to look ahead into empty
years.Although he ate little, the dining-room was empty when he finished.Usually he had some cheerful banter for Tillie, to which she responded
in kind.But, what with the heat and with heaviness of spirit, he did
not notice her depression until he rose."Why, you're not sick, are you, Tillie?"If I send you two tickets to a
roof garden where there's a variety show, can't you take a friend and go
to-night?""Thanks; I guess I'll not go out."Then, unexpectedly, she bent her head against a chair-back and fell to
silent crying.Then:--

"Now--tell me about it.""I'm just worried; that's all.""Let's see if we can't fix up the worries."Then I'm the person to tell it to.I--I'm pretty much a lost soul
myself."He put an arm over her shoulders and drew her up, facing him."Suppose we go into the parlor and talk it out.I'll bet things are not
as bad as you imagine."But when, in the parlor that had seen Mr.Schwitter's strange proposal
of the morning, Tillie poured out her story, K."The wicked part is that I want to go with him," she finished."I keep
thinking about being out in the country, and him coming into supper, and
everything nice for him and me cleaned up and waiting--O my God!I've
always been a good woman until now.""I--I understand a great deal better than you think I do.The only thing is--"

"Go on."You might go on and be very happy.And as for the--for his wife, it
won't do her any harm.But when they come, and you cannot give
them a name--don't you see?God forbid that
I--But no happiness is built on a foundation of wrong.It's been tried
before, Tillie, and it doesn't pan out."He was conscious of a feeling of failure when he left her at last.She
had acquiesced in what he said, knew he was right, and even promised
to talk to him again before making a decision one way or the other.But
against his abstractions of conduct and morality there was pleading in
Tillie the hungry mother-heart; law and creed and early training were
fighting against the strongest instinct of the race.CHAPTER XI


The hot August days dragged on.Merciless sunlight beat in through the
slatted shutters of ward windows.At night, from the roof to which the
nurses retired after prayers for a breath of air, lower surrounding
roofs were seen to be covered with sleepers.Children dozed precariously
on the edge of eternity; men and women sprawled in the grotesque
postures of sleep.There was a sort of feverish irritability in the air.Even the nurses,
stoically unmindful of bodily discomfort, spoke curtly or not at all.Miss Dana, in Sidney's ward, went down with a low fever, and for a day
or so Sidney and Miss Grange got along as best they could.Sidney worked
like two or more, performed marvels of bed-making, learned to give
alcohol baths for fever with the maximum of result and the minimum
of time, even made rounds with a member of the staff and came through
creditably.Ed Wilson had sent a woman patient into the ward, and his visits
were the breath of life to the girl.Some of them will
try to take it out of you.It's been hot, and of course it's troublesome to tell
me everything.I--I think they're all very kind."He reached out a square, competent hand, and put it over hers."We miss you in the Street," he said."It's all sort of dead there since
you left.Joe Drummond doesn't moon up and down any more, for one thing.What was wrong between you and Joe, Sidney?""I didn't want to marry him; that's all."Then, seeing her face:--

"But you're right, of course.Don't marry anyone unless you can't live
without him.That's been my motto, and here I am, still single."During the lonely times when Max was at college and in Europe, he had
watched her grow from a child to a young girl.He did not suspect for
a moment that in that secret heart of hers he sat newly enthroned, in
a glow of white light, as Max's brother; that the mere thought that
he lived in Max's house (it was, of course Max's house to her), sat at
Max's breakfast table, could see him whenever he wished, made the touch
of his hand on hers a benediction and a caress.Sidney finished folding linen and went back to the ward.Almost every bed had its visitor beside it; but
Sidney, running an eye over the ward, found the girl of whom she had
spoken to Le Moyne quite alone.She was propped up in bed, reading; but
at each new step in the corridor hope would spring into her eyes and die
again.If these people would only get out and let me read
in peace--Say, sit down and talk to me, won't you?It beats the mischief
the way your friends forget you when you're laid up in a place like
this.""People can't always come at visiting hours."A girl I knew was sick here last year, and it wasn't too hot for me to
trot in twice a week with a bunch of flowers for her.Do you think she's
been here once?Then, suddenly:--

"You know that man I told you about the other day?""It was a shock to me, that's all.I didn't want you to think I'd break
my heart over any fellow.All I meant was, I wished he'd let me know."They looked unnaturally large and somber in
her face.Her hair had been cut short, and her nightgown, open at the
neck, showed her thin throat and prominent clavicles."You're from the city, aren't you, Miss Page?""You told me the street, but I've forgotten it."Sidney repeated the name of the Street, and slipped a fresh pillow under
the girl's head."The evening paper says there's a girl going to be married on your
street."A friend of mine is going to be married.I--I don't remember the man's name."I suppose you'll be going to that wedding?""If I ever get time to have a dress made, I'll surely go."Toward six o'clock the next morning, the night nurse was making out her
reports.On one record, which said at the top, "Grace Irving, age 19,"
and an address which, to the initiated, told all her story, the night
nurse wrote:--

"Did not sleep at all during night.Face set and eyes staring, but
complains of no pain.Carlotta Harrison, back from her vacation, reported for duty the next
morning, and was assigned to E ward, which was Sidney's.She gave Sidney
a curt little nod, and proceeded to change the entire routine with the
thoroughness of a Central American revolutionary president.Sidney, who
had yet to learn that with some people authority can only assert itself
by change, found herself confused, at sea, half resentful.Once she ventured a protest:--

"I've been taught to do it that way, Miss Harrison.If my method is
wrong, show me what you want, and I'll do my best.""I am not responsible for what you have been taught.And you will not
speak back when you are spoken to."Small as the incident was, it marked a change in Sidney's position
in the ward.She got the worst off-duty of the day, or none.Small
humiliations were hers: late meals, disagreeable duties, endless and
often unnecessary tasks.Even Miss Grange, now reduced to second place,
remonstrated with her senior."I think a certain amount of severity is good for a probationer," she
said, "but you are brutal, Miss Harrison."She's going to be one of the best nurses in
the house."Wilson's pet
probationer, that I don't always say 'please' when I ask her to change a
bed or take a temperature."Miss Grange was not lacking in keenness.She died not go to the Head,
which is unethical under any circumstances; but gradually there spread
through the training-school a story that Carlotta Harrison was jealous
of the new Page girl, Dr.Things were still highly
unpleasant in the ward, but they grew much better when Sidney was off
duty.She was asked to join a small class that was studying French at
night.As ignorant of the cause of her popularity as of the reason of
her persecution, she went steadily on her way.For the first time, she was facing problems and
demanding an answer.Why must there be Grace Irvings in the world?Why
must the healthy babies of the obstetric ward go out to the slums and
come back, in months or years, crippled for the great fight by the
handicap of their environment, rickety, tuberculous, twisted?Why need
the huge mills feed the hospitals daily with injured men?And there were other things that she thought of.Every night, on her
knees in the nurses' parlor at prayers, she promised, if she were
accepted as a nurse, to try never to become calloused, never to regard
her patients as "cases," never to allow the cleanliness and routine of
her ward to delay a cup of water to the thirsty, or her arms to a sick
child.On the whole, the world was good, she found.And, of all the good things
in it, the best was service.True, there were hot days and restless
nights, weary feet, and now and then a heartache.But to offset these there was the sound of Dr.Max's step
in the corridor, and his smiling nod from the door; there was a "God
bless you" now and then for the comfort she gave; there were wonderful
nights on the roof under the stars, until K.While Sidney watched the stars from her hospital roof, while all around
her the slum children, on other roofs, fought for the very breath of
life, others who knew and loved her watched the stars, too.K. was
having his own troubles in those days.Late at night, when Anna and
Harriet had retired, he sat on the balcony and thought of many things.He had noticed that her lips were rather blue,
and had called in Dr.Anna was not to
be told, or Sidney."Sidney can't help any," said Harriet, "and for Heaven's sake let her
have her chance.If you tell her anything at all, she'll have Sidney here, waiting on her
hand and foot."And Le Moyne, fearful of urging too much because his own heart was
crying out to have the girl back, assented.The boy did not seem to get over the
thing the way he should.Now and then Le Moyne, resuming his old habit
of wearying himself into sleep, would walk out into the country.On one
such night he had overtaken Joe, tramping along with his head down.Joe had not wanted his company, had plainly sulked."I'll not talk," he said; "but, since we're going the same way, we might
as well walk together."But after a time Joe had talked, after all.It was not much at first--a
feverish complaint about the heat, and that if there was trouble in
Mexico he thought he'd go."Wait until fall, if you're thinking of it," K. advised."This is tepid
compared with what you'll get down there.""I've got to get away from here."Since the scene at the White Springs Hotel,
both knew that no explanation was necessary."It isn't so much that I mind her turning me down," Joe said, after a
silence."A girl can't marry all the men who want her.But I don't
like this hospital idea.Sometimes"--he turned bloodshot eyes on Le Moyne--"I think she went
because she was crazy about somebody there.""She went because she wanted to be useful."For almost twenty minutes they tramped on without speech.They had made
a circle, and the lights of the city were close again.K. stopped and
put a kindly hand on Joe's shoulder."A man's got to stand up under a thing like this, you know.I mean, it
mustn't be a knockout."I'll tell you what's
eating me up," he exploded.Don't talk to me about her
going to the hospital to be useful.She's crazy about him, and he's as
crooked as a dog's hind leg."He felt immeasurably old beside Joe's boyish blustering--old and rather
helpless.Some of these days I'll get something on him.Then
she'll know what to think of her hero!""That's not quite square, is it?"Joe had left him then, wheeling abruptly off into the shadows.K. had
gone home alone, rather uneasy.There seemed to be mischief in the very
air.CHAPTER XII


Tillie was gone.Oddly enough, the last person to see her before she left was Harriet
Kennedy.Schwitter's visit, Harriet's 
maid had announced a visitor.She had taken expensive rooms
in a good location, and furnished them with the assistance of a decor
store.Then she arranged with a New York house to sell her models on
commission.Her short excursion to New York had marked for Harriet the beginning of
a new heaven and a new earth.Here, at last, she found people speaking
her own language.She ventured a suggestion to a manufacturer, and found
it greeted, not, after the manner of the Street, with scorn, but with
approval and some surprise."About once in ten years," said Mr.Arthurs, "we have a woman from out
of town bring us a suggestion that is both novel and practical.When we
find people like that, we watch them.They climb, madame,--climb."Harriet's climbing was not so rapid as to make her dizzy; but business
was coming.The first time she made a price of seventy-five dollars
for an evening gown, she went out immediately after and took a drink of
water.She began to learn little quips of the feminine mind: that a woman who
can pay seventy-five will pay double that sum; that it is not considered
good form to show surprise at a dressmaker's prices, no matter how high
they may be; that long mirrors and artificial light help sales--no woman
over thirty but was grateful for her pink-and-gray room with its soft
lights.She took a lesson
from the New York modistes, and wore trailing black gowns.She strapped
her thin figure into the best corset she could get, and had her black
hair marcelled and dressed high.And, because she was a lady by birth
and instinct, the result was not incongruous, but refined and rather
impressive.She took her business home with her at night, lay awake scheming, and
wakened at dawn to find fresh color combinations in the early sky.She
wakened early because she kept her head tied up in a towel, so that her
hair need be done only three times a week.That and the corset were the
penalties she paid.Her high-heeled shoes were a torment, too; but in
the work-room she kicked them off.To this new Harriet, then, came Tillie in her distress.Tillie was
rather overwhelmed at first.The Street had always considered Harriet
"proud."But Tillie's urgency was great, her methods direct.While she worked at the fingers of
her silk gloves, what Harriet took for nervousness was pure abstraction."It's very nice of you to come to see me.Tillie surveyed the rooms, and Harriet caught her first full view of her
face.If you have had any words--"

"It's not that.I'd like to talk to you, if you don't
mind.""I'm up against something, and I can't seem to make up my mind.Last
night I said to myself, 'I've got to talk to some woman who's not
married, like me, and not as young as she used to be.McKee: she's a widow, and wouldn't understand.'"Harriet's voice was a trifle sharp as she replied.She never lied about
her age, but she preferred to forget it."I wish you'd tell me what you're getting at.""It ain't the sort of thing to come to too sudden.You and I can pretend all we like, Miss Harriet; but we're not getting
all out of life that the Lord meant us to have.You've got them wax
figures instead of children, and I have mealers."A little spot of color came into Harriet's cheek.Regardless of the corset, she bent forward.Ten years more at the most, and I'm through.Can't get around the tables as I used to.Why, yesterday I
put sugar into Mr.Le Moyne's coffee--well, never mind about that.Now
I've got a chance to get a home, with a good man to look after me--I
like him pretty well, and he thinks a lot of me.""No'm," said Tillie; "that's it."The gray curtains with their pink cording swung gently in the open
windows.From the work-room came the distant hum of a sewing-machine and
the sound of voices.Harriet sat with her hands in her lap and listened
while Tillie poured out her story.She told it
all, consistently and with unconscious pathos: her little room under the
roof at Mrs.McKee's, and the house in the country; her loneliness,
and the loneliness of the man; even the faint stirrings of potential
motherhood, her empty arms, her advancing age--all this she knit into
the fabric of her story and laid at Harriet's feet, as the ancients put
their questions to their gods.Too much that Tillie poured out to her found
an echo in her own breast.What was this thing she was striving for but
a substitute for the real things of life--love and tenderness, children,
a home of her own?Quite suddenly she loathed the gray carpet on the
floor, the pink chairs, the shaded lamps.Tillie was no longer the
waitress at a cheap boarding-house.She loomed large, potential,
courageous, a woman who held life in her hands."She thinks any woman's a fool to take up with a man.""You're giving me a terrible responsibility, Tillie, if you're asking my
advice."I'm asking what you'd do if it happened to you.Suppose you had
no people that cared anything about you, nobody to disgrace, and all
your life nobody had really cared anything about you.And then a chance
like this came along."I don't know," said poor Harriet."It seems to me--I'm afraid I'd be
tempted.It does seem as if a woman had the right to be happy, even
if--"

Her own words frightened her.It was as if some hidden self, and not
she, had spoken.She hastened to point out the other side of the matter,
the insecurity of it, the disgrace.Like K., she insisted that no right
can be built out of a wrong.Tillie sat and smoothed her gloves.At
last, when Harriet paused in sheer panic, the girl rose."I know how you feel, and I don't want you to take the responsibility of
advising me," she said quietly."I guess my mind was made up anyhow.But
before I did it I just wanted to be sure that a decent woman would think
the way I do about it."And so, for a time, Tillie went out of the life of the Street as she
went out of Harriet's handsome rooms, quietly, unobtrusively, with calm
purpose in her eyes.The Lorenz house was being
painted for Christine's wedding.Johnny Rosenfeld, not perhaps of the
Street itself, but certainly pertaining to it, was learning to drive
Palmer Howe's new car, in mingled agony and bliss.He walked along the
Street, not "right foot, left foot," but "brake foot, clutch foot," and
took to calling off the vintage of passing cars."So-and-So 1910,"
he would say, with contempt in his voice.He spent more than he could
afford on a large streamer, meant to be fastened across the rear of the
automobile, which said, "Excuse our dust," and was inconsolable when
Palmer refused to let him use it.K. had yielded to Anna's insistence, and was boarding as well as
rooming at the Page house.The Street, rather snobbish to its occasional
floating population, was accepting and liking him.It found him tender,
infinitely human.And in return he found that this seemingly empty eddy
into which he had drifted was teeming with life.He busied himself with
small things, and found his outlook gradually less tinged with despair.When he found himself inclined to rail, he organized a baseball
club, and sent down to everlasting defeat the Linburgs, consisting of
cash-boys from Linden and Hofburg's department store.The Rosenfelds adored him, with the single exception of the head of
the family.The elder Rosenfeld having been "sent up," it was K. who
discovered that by having him consigned to the workhouse his family
would receive from the county some sixty-five cents a day for his labor.As this was exactly sixty-five cents a day more than he was worth to
them free, Mrs.Rosenfeld voiced the pious hope that he be kept there
forever.K. made no further attempt to avoid Max Wilson.Some day they would meet
face to face.He hoped, when it happened, they two might be alone; that
was all.Even had he not been bound by his promise to Sidney, flight
would have been foolish.The world was a small place, and, one way and
another, he had known many people.Wherever he went, there would be the
same chance.Other things being equal,--the eddy
and all that it meant--, he would not willingly take himself out of his
small share of Sidney's life.She was never to know what she meant to him, of course.He had scourged
his heart until it no longer shone in his eyes when he looked at her.But he was very human--not at all meek.There were plenty of days when
his philosophy lay in the dust and savage dogs of jealousy tore at it;
more than one evening when he threw himself face downward on the bed
and lay without moving for hours.And of these periods of despair he was
always heartily ashamed the next day.The meeting with Max Wilson took place early in September, and under
better circumstances than he could have hoped for.Sidney had come home for her weekly visit, and her mother's condition
had alarmed her for the first time.When Le Moyne came home at six
o'clock, he found her waiting for him in the hall."I am just a little frightened, K.," she said."Do you think mother is
looking quite well?""She has felt the heat, of course.The summer--I often think--"

"Her lips are blue!"She put her hands on his arm and looked up at him with appeal and
something of terror in her face.Thus cornered, he had to acknowledge that Anna had been out of sorts.It's tragic and absurd that I should be
caring for other people, when my own mother--"

She dropped her head on his arm, and he saw that she was crying.If he
made a gesture to draw her to him, she never knew it."I'm much braver than this in the hospital.K. was sorely tempted to tell her the truth and bring her back to the
little house: to their old evenings together, to seeing the younger
Wilson, not as the white god of the operating-room and the hospital, but
as the dandy of the Street and the neighbor of her childhood--back even
to Joe.But, with Anna's precarious health and Harriet's increasing engrossment
in her business, he felt it more and more necessary that Sidney go on
with her training.And there was another
point: it had been decided that Anna was not to know her condition.If
she was not worried she might live for years.There was no surer way to
make her suspect it than by bringing Sidney home.She insisted on coming downstairs, and
even sat with them on the balcony until the stars came out, talking
of Christine's trousseau, and, rather fretfully, of what she would do
without the parlors."You shall have your own boudoir upstairs," said Sidney valiantly."Katie can carry your tray up there.We are going to make the
sewing-room into your private sitting-room, and I shall nail the
machine-top down."When K. insisted on carrying her upstairs, she went in
a flutter.she said, when he had placed her on her bed."How can a clerk, bending over a ledger, be so muscular?When I have
callers, will it be all right for Katie to show them upstairs?"She dropped asleep before the doctor came; and when, at something after
eight, the door of the Wilson house slammed and a figure crossed the
street, it was not Ed at all, but the surgeon.Sidney had been talking rather more frankly than usual.Lately there
had been a reserve about her.K., listening intently that night, read
between words a story of small persecutions and jealousies.But the girl
minimized them, after her way."It's always hard for probationers," she said."I often think Miss
Harrison is trying my mettle."And now that Miss Gregg has said she will accept
me, it's really all over.The other nurses are wonderful--so kind and so
helpful.I hope I shall look well in my cap."A thousand contingencies
flashed through his mind.Sidney might grow to like her and bring her to
the house.Sidney might insist on the thing she always spoke of--that he
visit the hospital; and he would meet her, face to face.He could have
depended on a man to keep his secret.This girl with her somber eyes and
her threat to pay him out for what had happened to her--she meant danger
of a sort that no man could fight."Soon," said Sidney, through the warm darkness, "I shall have a cap,
and be always forgetting it and putting my hat on over it--the new ones
always do.One of the girls slept in hers the other night!They are
tulle, you know, and quite stiff, and it was the most erratic-looking
thing the next day!"It was then that the door across the street closed.Sidney did not
hear it, but K. bent forward.There was a part of his brain always
automatically on watch."I shall get my operating-room training, too," she went on."That is
the real romance of the hospital.A--a surgeon is a sort of hero in
a hospital.There was a lot of
excitement to-day.Even the probationers' table was talking about it.The figure across the Street was lighting a cigarette.Perhaps, after
all--

"Something tremendously difficult--I don't know what.Edwardes invented it, or whatever they
call it.They took a picture of the operating-room for the article.The photographer had to put on operating clothes and wrap the camera in
sterilized towels.It was the most thrilling thing, they say--"

Her voice died away as her eyes followed K.'s.Max, cigarette in
hand, was coming across, under the ailanthus tree.He hesitated on the
pavement, his eyes searching the shadowy balcony."My brother is not at home, so I came over.How select you are, with
your balcony!"K. had risen and pushed back his chair.Here in the darkness he could hold the situation for a moment.If he
could get Sidney into the house, the rest would not matter.Luckily, the
balcony was very dark.Le Moyne, and he knows who you are very
well, indeed."Didn't the Street beat the Linburgs
the other day?And I believe the Rosenfelds are in receipt of sixty-five
cents a day and considerable peace and quiet through you, Mr.You're the most popular man on the Street."Wilson is here to see
your mother--"

"Going," said Sidney.Wilson is a very great person, K., so be
polite to him."Max had roused at the sound of Le Moyne's voice, not to suspicion,
of course, but to memory.Without any apparent reason, he was back in
Berlin, tramping the country roads, and beside him--

"Wonderful night!""The mind's a curious thing, isn't it.In the
instant since Miss Page went through that window I've been to Berlin and
back!K. struck a match with his steady hands.Now that the thing had come, he
was glad to face it.In the flare, his quiet profile glowed against the
night."Perhaps my voice took you back to Berlin."Blackness had descended on them again, except
for the dull glow of K.The neighbors next door have a bad habit of sitting just inside the
curtains."Sidney will be back in a moment.I'll talk to you, if you'll
sit still."I've been here--in the city, I mean--for a year.Don't
forget it--Le Moyne.I've got a position in the gas office, clerical.I have reason to think I'm going to be moved
up.That will be twenty, maybe twenty-two."Wilson stirred, but he found no adequate words.Only a part of what K.
said got to him.For a moment he was back in a famous clinic, and this
man across from him--it was not believable!"It's not hard work, and it's safe.If I make a mistake there's no life
hanging on it.Once I made a blunder, a month or two ago.It cost me three dollars out of my own pocket.Wilson's voice showed that he was more than incredulous; he was
profoundly moved.When a year
went by--the Titanic had gone down, and nobody knew but what you were on
it--we gave up.I--in June we put up a tablet for you at the college.I
went down for the--for the services.""Let it stay," said K. quietly."I'm dead as far as the college goes,
anyhow.And, for Heaven's sake,
don't be sorry for me.I'm more contented than I've been for a long
time."The wonder in Wilson's voice was giving way to irritation.Why, good Heavens, man, I did your
operation to-day, and I've been blowing about it ever since."When that
happened I gave up.All a man in our profession has is a certain method,
knowledge--call it what you like,--and faith in himself.I lost my
self-confidence; that's all.For about a year I was
damned sorry for myself."If every surgeon gave up because he lost cases--I've just told you I
did your operation to-day.There was just a chance for the man, and I
took my courage in my hands and tried it.K. rose rather wearily and emptied his pipe over the balcony rail.Pipe in hand, he stood staring out at the ailanthus tree with its crown
of stars.Instead of the Street with its quiet houses, he saw the men
he had known and worked with and taught, his friends who spoke his
language, who had loved him, many of them, gathered about a bronze
tablet set in a wall of the old college; he saw their earnest faces and
grave eyes.He heard--

He heard the soft rustle of Sidney's dress as she came into the little
room behind them.CHAPTER XIII


A few days after Wilson's recognition of K., two most exciting things
happened to Sidney.One was that Christine asked her to be maid of honor
at her wedding.She was accepted, and
given her cap.Because she could not get home that night, and because the little house
had no telephone, she wrote the news to her mother and sent a note to Le
Moyne:

DEAR K.,--I am accepted, and IT is on my head at this minute.I am as
conscious of it as if it were a halo, and as if I had done something to
deserve it, instead of just hoping that someday I shall.I am writing
this on the bureau, so that when I lift my eyes I may see It.I am
afraid just now I am thinking more of the cap than of what it means.Very soon I shall slip down and show it to the ward.I shall go to the door when the night nurse is busy somewhere, and
turn all around and let them see it, without saying a word.You have been very good to me, dear K. It is you who have made possible
this happiness of mine to-night.I am promising myself to be very good,
and not so vain, and to love my enemies--, although I have none now.Miss Harrison has just congratulated me most kindly, and I am sure poor
Joe has both forgiven and forgotten.K. found the note on the hall table when he got home that night, and
carried it upstairs to read.Whatever faint hope he might have had that
her youth would prevent her acceptance he knew now was over.With the
letter in his hand, he sat by his table and looked ahead into the empty
years.But more and more the life of the hospital would engross her.He
surmised, too, very shrewdly, that, had he ever had a hope that she
might come to care for him, his very presence in the little house
militated against him.There was none of the illusion of separation;
he was always there, like Katie.When she opened the door, she called
"Mother" from the hall.If Anna did not answer, she called him, in much
the same voice.He had built a wall of philosophy that had withstood even Wilson's
recognition and protest.But enduring philosophy comes only with time;
and he was young.Now and then all his defenses crumbled before a
passion that, when he dared to face it, shook him by its very strength.And that day all his stoicism went down before Sidney's letter.Its very
frankness and affection hurt--not that he did not want her affection;
but he craved so much more.He threw himself face down on the bed, with
the paper crushed in his hand.Sidney's letter was not the only one he received that day.When, in
response to Katie's summons, he rose heavily and prepared for dinner, he
found an unopened envelope on the table.It was from Max Wilson:--

DEAR LE MOYNE,--I have been going around in a sort of haze all day.The
fact that I only heard your voice and scarcely saw you last night has
made the whole thing even more unreal.I have a feeling of delicacy about trying to see you again so soon.I'm
bound to respect your seclusion.But there are some things that have got
to be discussed.You said last night that things were "different" with you.Do you know any man in our
profession who has not?And, for fear you think I do not know what I am
talking about, the thing was threshed out at the State Society when the
question of the tablet came up.Old Barnes got up and said: "Gentlemen,
all of us live more or less in glass houses.Let him who is without
guilt among us throw the first stone!"I took my little car and drove around the
country roads, and the farther I went the more outrageous your position
became.I'm not going to write any rot about the world needing men like
you, although it's true enough.You working in
a gas office, while old O'Hara bungles and hacks, and I struggle along
on what I learned from you!It takes courage to step down from the pinnacle you stood on.So it's
not cowardice that has set you down here.The first, and best, is for you to go back.No one has taken your place, because no one could do the work.But if
that's out of the question,--and only you know that, for only you know
the facts,--the next best thing is this, and in all humility I make the
suggestion.Take the State exams under your present name, and when you've got your
certificate, come in with me.I'll be getting a
damn sight more than I give.It is a curious fact that a man who is absolutely untrustworthy about
women is often the soul of honor to other men.The younger Wilson,
taking his pleasures lightly and not too discriminatingly, was making an
offer that meant his ultimate eclipse, and doing it cheerfully, with his
eyes open.It was like Max to make such an offer, like him to make it
as if he were asking a favor and not conferring one.But the offer left
him untempted.He had weighed himself in the balance, and found himself
wanting.No tablet on the college wall could change that.And when,
late that night, Wilson found him on the balcony and added appeal to
argument, the situation remained unchanged.He realized its hopelessness
when K. lapsed into whimsical humor."I'm not absolutely useless where I am, you know, Max," he said."I've
raised three tomato plants and a family of kittens this summer, helped
to plan a trousseau, assisted in selecting wall-paper for the room just
inside,--did you notice it?--and developed a boy pitcher with a ball
that twists around the bat like a Colles fracture around a splint!""If you're going to be humorous--"

"My dear fellow," said K. quietly, "if I had no sense of humor, I should
go upstairs to-night, turn on the gas, and make a stertorous entrance
into eternity.By the way, that's something I forgot!"Among my other activities, I wired the parlor for
electric light.The bride-to-be expects some electroliers as wedding
gifts, and--"

Wilson rose and flung his cigarette into the grass.K. rose with him, and all the suppressed feeling of the interview was
crowded into his last few words."I'm not as ungrateful as you think, Max," he said."I--you've helped
a lot.I'm as well off as I deserve to be, and
better.Wilson's unexpected magnanimity put K. in a curious position--left him,
as it were, with a divided allegiance.Sidney's frank infatuation for
the young surgeon was growing.And where before
he might have felt justified in going to the length of warning her, now
his hands were tied.More than once he had
taken Sidney back to the hospital in his car.Le Moyne, handicapped at
every turn, found himself facing two alternatives, one but little better
than the other.The affair might run a legitimate course, ending in
marriage--a year of happiness for her, and then what marriage with
Max, as he knew him, would inevitably mean: wanderings away, remorseful
returns to her, infidelities, misery.Or, it might be less serious but
almost equally unhappy for her.Max might throw caution to the winds,
pursue her for a time,--K. had seen him do this,--and then, growing
tired, change to some new attraction.In either case, he could only wait
and watch, eating his heart out during the long evenings when Anna read
her "Daily Thoughts" upstairs and he sat alone with his pipe on the
balcony.Sidney went on night duty shortly after her acceptance.All of her
orderly young life had been divided into two parts: day, when one
played or worked, and night, when one slept.Now she was compelled to
a readjustment: one worked in the night and slept in the day.At the end of her first night report Sidney
added what she could remember of a little verse of Stevenson's.She
added it to the end of her general report, which was to the effect that
everything had been quiet during the night except the neighborhood."And does it not seem hard to you,
      When all the sky is clear and blue,
      And I should like so much to play,
      To have to go to bed by day?"The day assistant happened on the report, and was quite scandalized."If the night nurses are to spend their time making up poetry," she
said crossly, "we'd better change this hospital into a young ladies'
seminary.If she wants to complain about the noise in the street, she
should do so in proper form.""I don't think she made it up," said the Head, trying not to smile."I've heard something like it somewhere, and, what with the heat and the
noise of traffic, I don't see how any of them get any sleep."But, because discipline must be observed, she wrote on the slip the
assistant carried around: "Please submit night reports in prose."She tumbled into her low bed at nine o'clock
in the morning, those days, with her splendid hair neatly braided down
her back and her prayers said, and immediately her active young mind
filled with images--Christine's wedding, Dr.Max passing the door of her
old ward and she not there, Joe--even Tillie, whose story was now the
sensation of the Street.A few months before she would not have cared
to think of Tillie.She would have retired her into the land of
things-one-must-forget.But the Street's conventions were not holding
Sidney's thoughts now.She puzzled over Tillie a great deal, and over
Grace and her kind.On her first night on duty, a girl had been brought in from the Avenue.She had taken a poison--nobody knew just what.When the internes had
tried to find out, she had only said: "What's the use?"Sidney kept asking herself, "Why?"those mornings when she could not get
to sleep.People were kind--men were kind, really,--and yet, for some
reason or other, those things had to be.After a time Sidney would doze fitfully.But by three o'clock she was
always up and dressing.Lack of
sleep wrote hollows around her eyes and killed some of her bright color.Between three and four o'clock in the morning she was overwhelmed on
duty by a perfect madness of sleep.There was a penalty for sleeping on
duty.The old night watchman had a way of slipping up on one nodding.The night nurses wished they might fasten a bell on him!Luckily, at four came early-morning temperatures; that roused her.And
after that came the clatter of early milk-wagons and the rose hues of
dawn over the roofs.Twice in the night, once at supper and again toward
dawn, she drank strong black coffee.But after a week or two her nerves
were stretched taut as a string.Her station was in a small room close to her three wards.But she sat
very little, as a matter of fact.Her responsibility was heavy on her;
she made frequent rounds.The late summer nights were fitful, feverish;
the darkened wards stretched away like caverns from the dim light near
the door.And from out of these caverns came petulant voices, uneasy
movements, the banging of a cup on a bedside, which was the signal of
thirst.To them, perhaps just
a little weary with time and much service, the banging cup meant not so
much thirst as annoyance."Don't jump like that, child; they're not parched, you know.""But if you have a fever and are thirsty--"

"Thirsty nothing!"Then," Sidney would say, rising resolutely, "they are going to see me."Gradually the older girls saw that she would not save herself.They
liked her very much, and they, too, had started in with willing feet
and tender hands; but the thousand and one demands of their service
had drained them dry.They were efficient, cool-headed, quick-thinking
machines, doing their best, of course, but differing from Sidney in that
their service was of the mind, while hers was of the heart.To them,
pain was a thing to be recorded on a report; to Sidney, it was written
on the tablets of her soul.Carlotta Harrison went on night duty at the same time--her last night
service, as it was Sidney's first.She had
charge of the three wards on the floor just below Sidney, and of the
ward into which all emergency cases were taken.It was a difficult
service, perhaps the most difficult in the house.Scarcely a night went
by without its patrol or ambulance case.Ordinarily, the emergency ward
had its own night nurse.Belated
vacations and illness had depleted the training-school.Carlotta, given
double duty, merely shrugged her shoulders."I've always had things pretty hard here," she commented briefly."When I go out, I'll either be competent enough to run a whole hospital
singlehanded, or I'll be carried out feet first."Sidney was glad to have her so near.She knew her better than she knew
the other nurses.Small emergencies were constantly arising and finding
her at a loss.Once at least every night, Miss Harrison would hear a
soft hiss from the back staircase that connected the two floors, and,
going out, would see Sidney's flushed face and slightly crooked cap
bending over the stair-rail."I'm dreadfully sorry to bother you," she would say, "but So-and-So
won't have a fever bath"; or, "I've a woman here who refuses her
medicine."Then would follow rapid questions and equally rapid answers.Much as Carlotta disliked and feared the girl overhead, it never
occurred to her to refuse her assistance.Perhaps the angels who keep
the great record will put that to her credit.Sidney saw her first death shortly after she went on night duty.It was
the most terrible experience of all her life; and yet, as death goes, it
was quiet enough.So gradual was it that Sidney, with K.'s little watch
in hand, was not sure exactly when it happened.The light was very dim
behind the little screen.One moment the sheet was quivering slightly
under the struggle for breath, the next it was still.That life, so potential, so tremendous a
thing, could end so ignominiously, that the long battle should terminate
always in this capitulation--it seemed to her that she could not stand
it.Added to all her other new problems of living was this one of dying.She made mistakes, of course, which the kindly nurses forgot to
report--basins left about, errors on her records.She rinsed her
thermometer in hot water one night, and startled an interne by sending
him word that Mary McGuire's temperature was a hundred and ten degrees.She let a delirious patient escape from the ward another night and go
airily down the fire-escape before she discovered what had happened!Then she distinguished herself by flying down the iron staircase and
bringing the runaway back single-handed.For Christine's wedding the Street threw off its drab attire and assumed
a wedding garment.In the beginning it was incredulous about some of the
details."An awning from the house door to the curbstone, and a policeman!"Rosenfeld, who was finding steady employment at the Lorenz
house."And another awning at the church, with a red carpet!"Rosenfeld had arrived home and was making up arrears of rest and
recreation."Why do they ask 'em if they don't trust 'em?"But the mention of the policemen had been unfortunate.It recalled to
him many things that were better forgotten.He rose and scowled at his
wife."You tell Johnny something for me," he snarled."You tell him when he
sees his father walking down street, and he sittin' up there alone on
that automobile, I want him to stop and pick me up when I hail him.Me
walking, while my son swells around in a car!"You let me hear of him road-housin', and
I'll kill him!"The wedding was to be at five o'clock.This, in itself, defied all
traditions of the Street, which was either married in the very early
morning at the Catholic church or at eight o'clock in the evening at
the Presbyterian.There was something reckless about five o'clock.It had a queer feeling that perhaps such a
marriage was not quite legal.The question of what to wear became, for the men, an earnest one.Ed
resurrected an old black frock-coat and had a "V" of black cambric set
in the vest.Jenkins, the grocer, rented a cutaway, and bought a
new Panama to wear with it.The deaf-and-dumb book agent who boarded at
McKees', and who, by reason of his affliction, was calmly ignorant of
the excitement around him, wore a borrowed dress-suit, and considered
himself to the end of his days the only properly attired man in the
church.The younger Wilson was to be one of the ushers.When the newspapers came
out with the published list and this was discovered, as well as that
Sidney was the maid of honor, there was a distinct quiver through the
hospital training-school.A probationer was authorized to find out
particulars.It was the day of the wedding then, and Sidney, who had
not been to bed at all, was sitting in a sunny window in the Dormitory
Annex, drying her hair."I--I just wonder," she said, "if you would let some of the girls come
in to see you when you're dressed?""It's awfully thrilling, isn't it?"Are you going to walk down the aisle with him?"They had a rehearsal last night, but of course I was not
there.The probationer had been instructed to find out other things; so she set
to work with a fan at Sidney's hair."He's awfully good-looking, isn't he?"She was not ignorant of the methods of the school.If
this girl was pumping her--

"I'll have to think that over," she said, with a glint of mischief in
her eyes."When you know a person terribly well, you hardly know whether
he's good-looking or not.""I suppose," said the probationer, running the long strands of Sidney's
hair through her fingers, "that when you are at home you see him often."Sidney got off the window-sill, and, taking the probationer smilingly by
the shoulders, faced her toward the door."You go back to the girls," she said, "and tell them to come in and see
me when I am dressed, and tell them this: I don't know whether I am to
walk down the aisle with Dr.She shoved the probationer out into the hall and locked the door behind
her.That message in its entirety reached Carlotta Harrison.Sidney must be very sure
of herself.She, too, had not slept during the day.When the probationer who
had brought her the report had gone out, she lay in her long white
night-gown, hands clasped under her head, and stared at the vault-like
ceiling of her little room.She saw there Sidney in her white dress going down the aisle of the
church; she saw the group around the altar; and, as surely as she lay
there, she knew that Max Wilson's eyes would be, not on the bride, but
on the girl who stood beside her.The curious thing was that Carlotta felt that she could stop the wedding
if she wanted to.She'd happened on a bit of information--many a wedding
had been stopped for less.It rather obsessed her to think of stopping
the wedding, so that Sidney and Max would not walk down the aisle
together.There came, at last, an hour before the wedding, a lull in the feverish
activities of the previous month.In the Lorenz
kitchen, piles of plates, <DW64> waiters, ice-cream freezers, and Mrs.In the attic, in the center of a
sheet, before a toilet-table which had been carried upstairs for her
benefit, sat, on this her day of days, the bride.All the second story
had been prepared for guests and presents.Florists were still busy in the room below.Bridesmaids were clustered
on the little staircase, bending over at each new ring of the bell and
calling reports to Christine through the closed door:--

"Another wooden box, Christine.What will you
ever do with them all?"Here's another of the neighbors who wants to see how you
look.Do say you can't have any visitors now."Christine sat alone in the center of her sheet.The bridesmaids had been
sternly forbidden to come into her room."I haven't had a chance to think for a month," she said."And I've got
some things I've got to think out."But, when Sidney came, she sent for her.Sidney found her sitting on a
stiff chair, in her wedding gown, with her veil spread out on a small
stand.And, after Sidney had kissed her:--

"I've a good mind not to do it.""You're tired and nervous, that's all."But that isn't what's wrong with me.Throw that veil
some place and sit down."Christine was undoubtedly rouged, a very delicate touch.Sidney thought
brides should be rather pale.But under her eyes were lines that Sidney
had never seen there before."I'm not going to be foolish, Sidney.I'll go through with it, of
course.It would put mamma in her grave if I made a scene now.""Palmer gave his bachelor dinner at the Country Club last night.Somebody called father up to-day and
said that Palmer had emptied a bottle of wine into the piano.He hasn't
been here to-day."And as for the other--perhaps it wasn't Palmer who did
it."Three months before, perhaps, Sidney could not have comforted her; but
three months had made a change in Sidney.The complacent sophistries
of her girlhood no longer answered for truth.She put her arms around
Christine's shoulders."A man who drinks is a broken reed," said Christine."That's what I'm
going to marry and lean on the rest of my life--a broken reed.She got up quickly, and, trailing her long satin train across the floor,
bolted the door.Then from inside her corsage she brought out and held
to Sidney a letter.It was very short; Sidney read it at a glance:--

Ask your future husband if he knows a girl at 213 ---- Avenue.Three months before, the Avenue would have meant nothing to Sidney.Christine, more sophisticated, had always known.Quite suddenly Sidney knew who the girl at 213 ---- Avenue was.The
paper she held in her hand was hospital paper with the heading torn off.The whole sordid story lay before her: Grace Irving, with her thin face
and cropped hair, and the newspaper on the floor of the ward beside her!One of the bridesmaids thumped violently on the door outside."Another electric lamp," she called excitedly through the door."You see," Christine said drearily."I have received another electric
lamp, and Palmer is downstairs!I've got to go through with it, I
suppose.The only difference between me and other brides is that I know
what I'm getting."It's too late to do anything else.I am not going to give this
neighborhood anything to talk about."She picked up her veil and set the coronet on her head.Sidney stood
with the letter in her hands.'s answers to her hot question
had been this:--

"There is no sense in looking back unless it helps us to look ahead.What your little girl of the ward has been is not so important as what
she is going to be.""Even granting this to be true," she said to Christine slowly,--"and it
may only be malicious after all, Christine,--it's surely over and done
with.It's not Palmer's past that concerns you now; it's his future with
you, isn't it?"A band of duchesse lace rose
like a coronet from her soft hair, and from it, sweeping to the end of
her train, fell fold after fold of soft tulle.She arranged the coronet
carefully with small pearl-topped pins.Then she rose and put her hands
on Sidney's shoulders."The simple truth is," she said quietly, "that I might hold Palmer if
I cared--terribly.It's my pride
that's hurt, nothing else."And thus did Christine Lorenz go down to her wedding.Sidney stood for a moment, her eyes on the letter she held.Already, in
her new philosophy, she had learned many strange things.One of them was
this: that women like Grace Irving did not betray their lovers; that the
code of the underworld was "death to the squealer"; that one played the
game, and won or lost, and if he lost, took his medicine.Somebody else in the hospital who knew her story, of course.Before going downstairs, Sidney placed the letter in a saucer and set
fire to it with a match.Some of the radiance had died out of her eyes.The alley, however, was
rather confused by certain things.For instance, it regarded the awning
as essentially for the carriage guests, and showed a tendency to duck
in under the side when no one was looking.Rosenfeld absolutely
refused to take the usher's arm which was offered her, and said she
guessed she was able to walk up alone.Johnny Rosenfeld came, as befitted his position, in a complete
chauffeur's outfit of leather cap and leggings, with the shield that was
his State license pinned over his heart.The Street came decorously, albeit with a degree of uncertainty as to
supper.Should they put something on the stove before they left, in case
only ice cream and cake were served at the house?Or was it just as well
to trust to luck, and, if the Lorenz supper proved inadequate, to sit
down to a cold snack when they got home?To K., sitting in the back of the church between Harriet and Anna, the
wedding was Sidney--Sidney only.He watched her first steps down the
aisle, saw her chin go up as she gained poise and confidence, watched
the swinging of her young figure in its gauzy white as she passed him
and went forward past the long rows of craning necks.Afterward he could
not remember the wedding party at all.The service for him was Sidney,
rather awed and very serious, beside the altar.It was Sidney who came
down the aisle to the triumphant strains of the wedding march, Sidney
with Max beside her!On his right sat Harriet, having reached the first pinnacle of her
new career.They were more than
that--they were triumphant.Sitting there, she cast comprehensive eyes
over the church, filled with potential brides.To Harriet, then, that October afternoon was a future of endless lace
and chiffon, the joy of creation, triumph eclipsing triumph.But to
Anna, watching the ceremony with blurred eyes and ineffectual bluish
lips, was coming her hour.Sitting back in the pew, with her hands
folded over her prayer-book, she said a little prayer for her straight
young daughter, facing out from the altar with clear, unafraid eyes.As Sidney and Max drew near the door, Joe Drummond, who had been
standing at the back of the church, turned quickly and went out.He
stumbled, rather, as if he could not see.CHAPTER XIV


The supper at the White Springs Hotel had not been the last supper
Carlotta Harrison and Max Wilson had taken together.Carlotta had
selected for her vacation a small town within easy motoring distance of
the city, and two or three times during her two weeks off duty Wilson
had gone out to see her.For once that he could see Sidney, he saw Carlotta twice.She knew quite well the kind of man with whom she was dealing--that he
would pay as little as possible.But she knew, too, that, let him want a
thing enough, he would pay any price for it, even marriage.The very ardor in her face was in her favor.She would put the thing
through, and show those puling nurses, with their pious eyes and evening
prayers, a thing or two.During that entire vacation he never saw her in anything more elaborate
than the simplest of white dresses modestly open at the throat, sleeves
rolled up to show her satiny arms.There were no other boarders at the
little farmhouse.She sat for hours in the summer evenings in the square
yard filled with apple trees that bordered the highway, carefully
posed over a book, but with her keen eyes always on the road.She read
Browning, Emerson, Swinburne.Once he found her with a book that she
hastily concealed.He insisted on seeing it, and secured it.Confronted with it, she blushed and dropped her
eyes.His delighted vanity found in it the most insidious of compliments, as
she had intended."I feel such an idiot when I am with you," she said."I wanted to know a
little more about the things you do."That put their relationship on a new and advanced basis.Thereafter
he occasionally talked surgery instead of sentiment.His work, a sealed book to his women before,
lay open to her.Now and then their professional discussions ended in something
different.I can talk
shop with you without either shocking or nauseating you.You are the
most intelligent woman I know--and one of the prettiest."He had stopped the machine on the crest of a hill for the ostensible
purpose of admiring the view."As long as you talk shop," she said, "I feel that there is nothing
wrong in our being together; but when you say the other thing--"

"Is it wrong to tell a pretty woman you admire her?"He twisted himself around in the seat and sat looking at her."The loveliest mouth in the world!"She had expected it for at least a week, but her surprise was well done.Well done also was her silence during the homeward ride.No, she was not angry, she said.It was only that he had set her
thinking.When she got out of the car, she bade him good-night and
good-bye.After that nothing could have kept him away, and she knew it."Man demands both danger and play; therefore he selects woman as the
most dangerous of toys."A spice of danger had entered into their
relationship.He motored out to the farm the next day, to be told that Miss Harrison
had gone for a long walk and had not said when she would be back.Every man likes to think that
he is a bit of a devil.Max settled his tie, and, leaving his
car outside the whitewashed fence, departed blithely on foot in the
direction Carlotta had taken.He found her, face down, under a tree,
looking pale and worn and bearing all the evidence of a severe mental
struggle.She rose in confusion when she heard his step, and retreated a
foot or two, with her hands out before her.I--I have got to
have a little time alone.He knew it was play-acting, but rather liked it; and, because he was
quite as skillful as she was, he struck a match on the trunk of the tree
and lighted a cigarette before he answered."I was afraid of this," he said, playing up.I am not really a villain, Carlotta."It was the first time he had used her name."Sit down and let us talk things over."She sat down at a safe distance, and looked across the little clearing
to him with the somber eyes that were her great asset."You can afford to be very calm," she said, "because this is only play
to you; I know it.I'm a good listener and
not--unattractive.But what is play for you is not necessarily play for
me.For the first time, he found himself believing in her sincerity.If she cried--he was at
the mercy of any woman who cried.This sort of thing cannot go on, Dr.She did cry then--real tears; and he went over beside her and took her
in his arms.You make me feel like
a scoundrel, and I've only been taking a little bit of happiness.Max, and kissed her again on the lips.The one element Carlotta had left out of her calculations was herself.She had known the man, had taken the situation at its proper value.But
she had left out this important factor in the equation,--that factor
which in every relationship between man and woman determines the
equation,--the woman.Into her calculating ambition had come a new and destroying element.She
who, like K. in his little room on the Street, had put aside love and
the things thereof, found that it would not be put aside.By the end of
her short vacation Carlotta Harrison was wildly in love with the younger
Wilson.They continued to meet, not as often as before, but once a week,
perhaps.The meetings were full of danger now; and if for the girl they
lost by this quality, they gained attraction for the man.She was shrewd
enough to realize her own situation.She
cared, and he did not.It was all a game now, not hers.All women are intuitive; women in love are dangerously so.As well as
she knew that his passion for her was not the real thing, so also she
realized that there was growing up in his heart something akin to the
real thing for Sidney Page.Suspicion became certainty after a talk
they had over the supper table at a country road-house the day after
Christine's wedding."How was the wedding--tiresome?"There's always something thrilling to me in a man tying
himself up for life to one woman."That's not exactly the Law and the Prophets, is it?"To think of selecting out of all the world one woman,
and electing to spend the rest of one's days with her!Although--"

His eyes looked past Carlotta into distance."Sidney Page was one of the bridesmaids," he said irrelevantly."She was
lovelier than the bride.""Pretty, but stupid," said Carlotta.I've really tried to
teach her things, but--you know--" She shrugged her shoulders.If there was a twinkle in his eye, he
veiled it discreetly.But, once again in the machine, he bent over and
put his cheek against hers.You're jealous," he said exultantly.Nevertheless, although he might smile, the image of Sidney lay very
close to his heart those autumn days.Sidney came off night duty the middle of November.The night duty had
been a time of comparative peace to Carlotta.Max could bring Sidney back to the hospital in his car.Sidney's half-days at home were occasions for agonies of jealousy on
Carlotta's part.On such an occasion, a month after the wedding, she
could not contain herself.She pleaded her old excuse of headache, and
took the trolley to a point near the end of the Street.After twilight
fell, she slowly walked the length of the Street.Christine and Palmer
had not returned from their wedding journey.The November evening was
not cold, and on the little balcony sat Sidney and Dr.K. was
there, too, had she only known it, sitting back in the shadow and saying
little, his steady eyes on Sidney's profile.She went on down the Street in a frenzy
of jealous anger.After that two ideas ran concurrent in Carlotta's mind: one was to get
Sidney out of the way, the other was to make Wilson propose to her.In
her heart she knew that on the first depended the second.A week later she made the same frantic excursion, but with a different
result.Sidney was not in sight, or Wilson.But standing on the wooden
doorstep of the little house was Le Moyne.The ailanthus trees were
bare at that time, throwing gaunt arms upward to the November sky.The
street-lamp, which in the summer left the doorstep in the shadow, now
shone through the branches and threw into strong relief Le Moyne's tall
figure and set face.She went on, startled, her busy brain scheming anew.It was the first time
she had known that K. lived in the Page house.It gave her a sense of
uncertainty and deadly fear.She made her first friendly overture of many days to Sidney the
following day.They met in the locker-room in the basement where the
street clothing for the ward patients was kept.Here, rolled in bundles
and ticketed, side by side lay the heterogeneous garments in which
the patients had met accident or illness.Rags and tidiness, filth and
cleanliness, lay almost touching.Far away on the other side of the white-washed basement, men were
unloading gleaming cans of milk.Floods of sunlight came down the
cellar-way, touching their white coats and turning the cans to silver.Everywhere was the religion of the hospital, which is order.Sidney, harking back from recent slights to the staircase conversation
of her night duty, smiled at Carlotta cheerfully."Grace Irving is going out to-day.When one remembers how ill she was and how we thought she could not
live, it's rather a triumph, isn't it?"Sidney examined with some dismay the elaborate negligee garments in her
hand."She can't go out in those; I shall have to lend her something."A
little of the light died out of her face."She's had a hard fight, and
she has won," she said."But when I think of what she's probably going
back to--"

Carlotta shrugged her shoulders."It's all in the day's work," she observed indifferently."You can take
them up into the kitchen and give them steady work paring potatoes, or
put them in the laundry ironing.She drew a package from the locker and looked at it ruefully."Well, what do you know about this?Here's a woman who came in in a
nightgown and pair of slippers.And now she wants to go out in half an
hour!"She turned, on her way out of the locker-room, and shot a quick glance
at Sidney."I happened to be on your street the other night," she said."You live
across the street from Wilsons', don't you?""I thought so; I had heard you speak of the house.Your--your brother
was standing on the steps."It isn't really
right to call him a roomer; he's one of the family now."'s name had struck an always responsive chord in Sidney.The two girls
went toward the elevator together.With a very little encouragement,
Sidney talked of K. She was pleased at Miss Harrison's friendly tone,
glad that things were all right between them again.At her floor, she
put a timid hand on the girl's arm."I was afraid I had offended you or displeased you," she said."I'm so
glad it isn't so."Things were not going any too well with K. True, he had received his
promotion at the office, and with this present affluence of twenty-two
dollars a week he was able to do several things.Rosenfeld now
washed and ironed one day a week at the little house, so that Katie
might have more time to look after Anna.He had increased also the
amount of money that he periodically sent East.The thing that rankled and filled him with a sense
of failure was Max Wilson's attitude.It was not unfriendly; it was,
indeed, consistently respectful, almost reverential.But he clearly
considered Le Moyne's position absurd.There was no true comradeship between the two men; but there was
beginning to be constant association, and lately a certain amount of
friction.Wilson began to bring all his problems to Le Moyne.There were long
consultations in that small upper room.Perhaps more than one man or
woman who did not know of K.'s existence owed his life to him that fall.Cases began to come in to him
from the surrounding towns.To his own daring was added a new and
remarkable technique.But Le Moyne, who had found resignation if not
content, was once again in touch with the work he loved.There were
times when, having thrashed a case out together and outlined the next
day's work for Max, he would walk for hours into the night out over the
hills, fighting his battle.The longing was on him to be in the thick
of things again.The thought of the gas office and its deadly round
sickened him.It was on one of his long walks that K. found Tillie.It was December then, gray and raw, with a wet snow that changed to
rain as it fell.The country roads were ankle-deep with mud, the wayside
paths thick with sodden leaves.The dreariness of the countryside that
Saturday afternoon suited his mood.He had ridden to the end of the
street-car line, and started his walk from there.As was his custom, he
wore no overcoat, but a short sweater under his coat.Somewhere along
the road he had picked up a mongrel dog, and, as if in sheer desire for
human society, it trotted companionably at his heels.Seven miles from the end of the car line he found a road-house, and
stopped in for a glass of Scotch.The dog
went in with him, and stood looking up into his face.It was as if he
submitted, but wondered why this indoors, with the scents of the road
ahead and the trails of rabbits over the fields.The house was set in a valley at the foot of two hills.Through the mist
of the December afternoon, it had loomed pleasantly before him.The door
was ajar, and he stepped into a little hall covered with ingrain carpet.To the right was the dining-room, the table covered with a white cloth,
and in its exact center an uncompromising bunch of dried flowers.To the
left, the typical parlor of such places.It might have been the parlor
of the White Springs Hotel in duplicate, plush self-rocker and all.Over
everything was silence and a pervading smell of fresh varnish.The house
was aggressive with new paint--the sagging old floors shone with it, the
doors gleamed.called K.

There were slow footsteps upstairs, the closing of a bureau drawer,
the rustle of a woman's dress coming down the stairs.K., standing
uncertainly on a carpet oasis that was the center of the parlor varnish,
stripped off his sweater.he said to the unseen female on the
staircase.She put a hand against the
doorframe to steady herself.Tillie surely, but a new Tillie!With her
hair loosened around her face, a fresh blue chintz dress open at the
throat, a black velvet bow on her breast, here was a Tillie fuller,
infinitely more attractive, than he had remembered her.But she did not
smile at him.There was something about her eyes not unlike the dog's
expression, submissive, but questioning."Well, you've found me, Mr.And, when he held out his hand,
smiling: "I just had to do it, Mr.You look mighty fine and--happy, Tillie."Schwitter's gone to the postoffice.Will you have a cup of tea, or will you have something else?"The instinct of the Street was still strong in Tillie.The Street did
not approve of "something else.""Scotch-and-soda," said Le Moyne."And shall I buy a ticket for you to
punch?"He was sorry he had made the blunder.Evidently the Street and all that pertained was a sore subject.It was for this that she had exchanged
the virginal integrity of her life at Mrs.McKee's--for this wind-swept
little house, tidily ugly, infinitely lonely.There were two crayon
enlargements over the mantel.The
other was the paper-doll wife.K. wondered what curious instinct of
self-abnegation had caused Tillie to leave the wife there undisturbed.Back of its position of honor he saw the girl's realization of her own
situation.On a wooden shelf, exactly between the two pictures, was
another vase of dried flowers.Tillie brought the Scotch, already mixed, in a tall glass.K. would
have preferred to mix it himself, but the Scotch was good."You gave me a turn at first," said Tillie."But I am right glad to see
you, Mr.Now that the roads are bad, nobody comes very much.Until now, K. and Tillie, when they met, had met conversationally on the
common ground of food.They no longer had that, and between them both
lay like a barrier their last conversation.More attractive it certainly was,
but happy?There was a wistfulness about Tillie's mouth that set him
wondering."He's about the best man on earth.He's never said a cross word to
me--even at first, when I was panicky and scared at every sound.""I burned a lot of victuals when I first came, running off and hiding
when I heard people around the place.It used to seem to me that what
I'd done was written on my face.Tillie glanced up at the two pictures over the mantel."Sometimes it is--when he comes in tired, and I've a chicken ready or
some fried ham and eggs for his supper, and I see him begin to look
rested.He lights his pipe, and many an evening he helps me with the
dishes."I wouldn't go back to where I was, but I am not happy, Mr.This place is his, and he'd like a boy to come into it
when he's gone.if I did have one; what would it be?"'s eyes followed hers to the picture and the everlastings underneath."And she--there isn't any prospect of her--?"There was no solution to Tillie's problem.Le Moyne, standing on the
hearth and looking down at her, realized that, after all, Tillie must
work out her own salvation.They talked far into the growing twilight of the afternoon.Tillie was
hungry for news of the Street: must know of Christine's wedding, of
Harriet, of Sidney in her hospital.And when he had told her all, she
sat silent, rolling her handkerchief in her fingers.Then:--

"Take the four of us," she said suddenly,--"Christine Lorenz and Sidney
Page and Miss Harriet and me,--and which one would you have picked to
go wrong like this?I guess, from the looks of things, most folks would
have thought it would be the Lorenz girl.They'd have picked Harriet
Kennedy for the hospital, and me for the dressmaking, and it would have
been Sidney Page that got married and had an automobile.She looked up at K. shrewdly.They didn't know me, and I
heard them talking.They said Sidney Page was going to marry Dr.As she
stood before him she looked up into his face."If you like her as well as I think you do, Mr.Le Moyne, you won't let
him get her.""I am afraid that's not up to me, is it?What would I do with a wife,
Tillie?"I guess, in the
long run, that would count more than money."That was what K. took home with him after his encounter with Tillie.He
pondered it on his way back to the street-car, as he struggled against
the wind.Wagon-tracks along the road were
filled with water and had begun to freeze.The rain had turned to a
driving sleet that cut his face.Halfway to the trolley line, the dog
turned off into a by-road.The dog stared after
him, one foot raised.Once again his eyes were like Tillie's, as she had
waved good-bye from the porch.His head sunk on his breast, K. covered miles of road with his long,
swinging pace, and fought his battle.Was Tillie right, after all, and
had he been wrong?Why should he efface himself, if it meant Sidney's
unhappiness?Why not accept Wilson's offer and start over again?Then
if things went well--the temptation was strong that stormy afternoon.He
put it from him at last, because of the conviction that whatever he did
would make no change in Sidney's ultimate decision.If she cared enough
for Wilson, she would marry him.CHAPTER XV


Palmer and Christine returned from their wedding trip the day K.
discovered Tillie.Anna Page made much of the arrival, insisted on
dinner for them that night at the little house, must help Christine
unpack her trunks and arrange her wedding gifts about the apartment.She
was brighter than she had been for days, more interested.The wonders of
the trousseau filled her with admiration and a sort of jealous envy for
Sidney, who could have none of these things.In a pathetic sort of way,
she mothered Christine in lieu of her own daughter.And it was her quick eye that discerned something wrong.Under her excitement was an undercurrent of reserve.Anna, rich in maternity if in nothing else, felt it, and in reply to
some speech of Christine's that struck her as hard, not quite fitting,
she gave her a gentle admonishing."Married life takes a little adjusting, my dear," she said."After we
have lived to ourselves for a number of years, it is not easy to live
for some one else."Christine straightened from the tea-table she was arranging.But why should the woman do all the adjusting?""Men are more set," said poor Anna, who had never been set in anything
in her life."It is harder for them to give in.And, of course, Palmer
is older, and his habits--"

"The less said about Palmer's habits the better," flashed Christine."I
appear to have married a bunch of habits."She gave over her unpacking, and sat down listlessly by the fire, while
Anna moved about, busy with the small activities that delighted her.Six weeks of Palmer's society in unlimited amounts had bored Christine
to distraction.She sat with folded hands and looked into a future that
seemed to include nothing but Palmer: Palmer asleep with his mouth open;
Palmer shaving before breakfast, and irritable until he had had his
coffee; Palmer yawning over the newspaper.And there was a darker side to the picture than that.There was a vision
of Palmer slipping quietly into his room and falling into the heavy
sleep, not of drunkenness perhaps, but of drink.She knew now that it would happen again and again, as long as he
lived.The letter she had received on
her wedding day was burned into her brain.There would be that in the
future too, probably.She was making a brave clutch
at happiness.But that afternoon of the first day at home she was
terrified.She was glad when Anna went and left her alone by her fire.But when she heard a step in the hall, she opened the door herself.She
had determined to meet Palmer with a smile.Tears brought nothing;
she had learned that already."Daughters of joy," they called girls like the one on the Avenue.She waited while, with his back to her, he
shook himself like a great dog.He smiled down at her, his kindly eyes lighting."It's good to be home and to see you again.Won't you come in to my
fire?""All the more reason why you should come," she cried gayly, and held the
door wide.The little parlor was cheerful with fire and soft lamps, bright with
silver vases full of flowers.K. stepped inside and took a critical
survey of the room."Between us we have made a pretty good job of this, I
with the paper and the wiring, and you with your pretty furnishings and
your pretty self."Christine saw his approval, and was
happier than she had been for weeks.She put on the thousand little airs
and graces that were a part of her--held her chin high, looked up at
him with the little appealing glances that she had found were wasted on
Palmer.She lighted the spirit-lamp to make tea, drew out the best chair
for him, and patted a cushion with her well-cared-for hands."And see, here's a footstool.""I am ridiculously fond of being babied," said K., and quite basked in
his new atmosphere of well-being.This was better than his empty room
upstairs, than tramping along country roads, than his own thoughts."Do
tell me all the scandal of the Street.""There has been no scandal since you went away," said K. And, because
each was glad not to be left to his own thoughts, they laughed at this
bit of unconscious humor."Seriously," said Le Moyne, "we have been very quiet.I have had my
salary raised and am now rejoicing in twenty-two dollars a week.Just when I had all my ideas fixed for
fifteen, I get twenty-two and have to reassemble them."It is very disagreeable when one's income becomes a burden," said
Christine gravely.She was finding in Le Moyne something that she needed just then--a
solidity, a sort of dependability, that had nothing to do with
heaviness.She felt that here was a man she could trust, almost confide
in.She liked his long hands, his shabby but well-cut clothes, his fine
profile with its strong chin.She left off her little affectations,--a
tribute to his own lack of them,--and sat back in her chair, watching
the fire.When K. chose, he could talk well.The Howes had been to Bermuda on
their wedding trip.He knew Bermuda; that gave them a common ground.As for K., he frankly enjoyed
the little visit--drew himself at last with regret out of his chair."You've been very nice to ask me in, Mrs."I hope you
will allow me to come again.But, of course, you are going to be very
gay."It seemed to Christine she would never be gay again.She did not
want him to go away.The sound of his deep voice gave her a sense of
security.She liked the clasp of the hand he held out to her, when at
last he made a move toward the door.Howe I am sorry he missed our little party," said Le Moyne.As he closed the door behind him, there was a new light in Christine's
eyes.Things were not right, but, after all, they were not hopeless.One
might still have friends, big and strong, steady of eye and voice.When
Palmer came home, the smile she gave him was not forced.The day's exertion had been bad for Anna.Le Moyne found her on the
couch in the transformed sewing-room, and gave her a quick glance of
apprehension.She was propped up high with pillows, with a bottle of
aromatic ammonia beside her."Just--short of breath," she panted.Sidney--is
coming home--to supper; and--the others--Palmer and--"

That was as far as she got.K., watch in hand, found her pulse thin,
stringy, irregular.He had been prepared for some such emergency, and he
hurried into his room for amyl-nitrate.When he came back she was almost
unconscious.He broke the capsule
in a towel, and held it over her face.After a time the spasm relaxed,
but her condition remained alarming.Harriet, who had come home by that time, sat by the couch and held her
sister's hand.Only once in the next hour or so did she speak.Harriet was too wretched to
notice the professional manner in which K. set to work over Anna."I've been a very hard sister to her," she said."If you can pull her
through, I'll try to make up for it."Christine sat on the stairs outside, frightened and helpless.They had
sent for Sidney; but the little house had no telephone, and the message
was slow in getting off.Ed came panting up the stairs and into the room."Well, this is sad, Harriet," said Dr."Why in the name of Heaven,
when I wasn't around, didn't you get another doctor.If she had had some
amyl-nitrate--"

"I gave her some nitrate of amyl," said K. quietly."There was really no
time to send for anybody.She almost went under at half-past five."Max had kept his word, and even Dr.He
gave a quick glance at this tall young man who spoke so quietly of what
he had done for the sick woman, and went on with his work.Sidney arrived a little after six, and from that moment the confusion in
the sick-room was at an end.She moved Christine from the stairs,
where Katie on her numerous errands must crawl over her; set Harriet to
warming her mother's bed and getting it ready; opened windows, brought
order and quiet.And then, with death in her eyes, she took up her
position beside her mother.This was no time for weeping; that would
come later.Once she turned to K., standing watchfully beside her."I think you have known this for a long time," she said.And, when he
did not answer: "Why did you let me stay away from her?It would have
been such a little time!""We were trying to do our best for both of you," he replied.It came as a cry from the depths of the
girl's new experience."She has had so little of life," she said, over and over."After all, Sidney," he said, "the Street IS life: the world is only
many streets.She had love and content, and she
had you."Anna died a little after midnight, a quiet passing, so that only Sidney
and the two men knew when she went away.During all that long evening she had sat looking back over years of
small unkindnesses.The thorn of Anna's inefficiency had always rankled
in her flesh.She had been hard, uncompromising, thwarted.Once he thought she was fainting, and
went to her.Do you think you could get them all out of the room and
let me have her alone for just a few minutes?"He cleared the room, and took up his vigil outside the door.And, as he
stood there, he thought of what he had said to Sidney about the Street.Here in this very house were death and
separation; Harriet's starved life; Christine and Palmer beginning a
long and doubtful future together; himself, a failure, and an impostor.When he opened the door again, Sidney was standing by her mother's bed.He went to her, and she turned and put her head against his shoulder
like a tired child."Take me away, K.," she said pitifully.And, with his arm around her, he led her out of the room.Outside of her small immediate circle Anna's death was hardly felt.Harriet carried back to her
business a heaviness of spirit that made it difficult to bear with
the small irritations of her day.Perhaps Anna's incapacity, which had
always annoyed her, had been physical.She must have had her trouble a
longtime.She remembered other women of the Street who had crept through
inefficient days, and had at last laid down their burdens and closed
their mild eyes, to the lasting astonishment of their families.What did
they think about, these women, as they pottered about?Did they resent
the impatience that met their lagging movements, the indifference
that would not see how they were failing?Hot tears fell on Harriet's
fashion-book as it lay on her knee.Not only for Anna--for Anna's
prototypes everywhere.On Sidney--and in less measure, of course, on K.--fell the real brunt of
the disaster.Sidney kept up well until after the funeral, but went down
the next day with a low fever.Ed said, and sternly forbade the hospital
again until Christmas.Morning and evening K. stopped at her door and
inquired for her, and morning and evening came Sidney's reply:--

"Much better.But the days dragged on and she did not get about.Downstairs, Christine and Palmer had entered on the round of midwinter
gayeties.Palmer's "crowd" was a lively one.There were dinners
and dances, week-end excursions to country-houses.The Street grew
accustomed to seeing automobiles stop before the little house at all
hours of the night.Johnny Rosenfeld, driving Palmer's car, took to
falling asleep at the wheel in broad daylight, and voiced his discontent
to his mother."You never know where you are with them guys," he said briefly."We
start out for half an hour's run in the evening, and get home with the
milk-wagons.And the more some of them have had to drink, the more they
want to drive the machine.If I get a chance, I'm going to beat it while
the wind's my way."But, talk as he might, in Johnny Rosenfeld's loyal heart there was no
thought of desertion.Palmer had given him a man's job, and he would
stick by it, no matter what came.There were some things that Johnny Rosenfeld did not tell his mother.There were evenings when the Howe car was filled, not with Christine
and her friends, but with women of a different world; evenings when the
destination was not a country estate, but a road-house; evenings when
Johnny Rosenfeld, ousted from the driver's seat by some drunken youth,
would hold tight to the swinging car and say such fragments of prayers
as he could remember.Johnny Rosenfeld, who had started life with few
illusions, was in danger of losing such as he had.One such night Christine put in, lying wakefully in her bed, while the
clock on the mantel tolled hour after hour into the night.Palmer did
not come home at all.He sent a note from the office in the morning:

"I hope you are not worried, darling.The car broke down near the
Country Club last night, and there was nothing to do but to spend the
night there.I would have sent you word, but I did not want to rouse
you.What do you say to the theater to-night and supper afterward?"She telephoned the Country Club that morning,
and found that Palmer had not been there.But, although she knew now
that he was deceiving her, as he always had deceived her, as probably
he always would, she hesitated to confront him with what she knew.She
shrank, as many a woman has shrunk before, from confronting him with his
lie.But the second time it happened, she was roused.It was almost Christmas
then, and Sidney was well on the way to recovery, thinner and very
white, but going slowly up and down the staircase on K.'s arm, and
sitting with Harriet and K. at the dinner table.She was begging to be
back on duty for Christmas, and K. felt that he would have to give her
up soon.At three o'clock one morning Sidney roused from a light sleep to hear a
rapping on her door.She carried a
candle, and before she spoke she looked at Sidney's watch on the bedside
table."I hoped my clock was wrong," she said."I am sorry to waken you,
Sidney, but I don't know what to do."Sidney had lighted the gas and was throwing on her dressing-gown."When he went out did he say--"

"He said nothing.Sidney, I am going home in the
morning.""You don't mean that, do you?""Don't I look as if I mean it?How much of this sort of thing is a woman
supposed to endure?"These things always seem terrible in the
middle of the night, but by morning--"

Christine whirled on her.You remember the letter I got on my wedding
day?""Believe it or not," said Christine doggedly, "that's exactly what has
happened.I got something out of that little rat of a Rosenfeld boy, and
the rest I know because I know Palmer.The hospital had taught Sidney one thing: that it took many people to
make a world, and that out of these some were inevitably vicious.But
vice had remained for her a clear abstraction.There were such people,
and because one was in the world for service one cared for them.Even
the Saviour had been kind to the woman of the streets.But here abruptly Sidney found the great injustice of the world--that
because of this vice the good suffer more than the wicked."It makes me hate all the men in the world.Palmer cares for you, and yet he can do a thing like this!"Christine was pacing nervously up and down the room.Mere companionship
had soothed her.She was now, on the surface at least, less excited than
Sidney."They are not all like Palmer, thank Heaven," she said.My father is one, and your K., here in the house, is
another."At four o'clock in the morning Palmer Howe came home.Christine met
him in the lower hall.She
confronted him in her straight white gown and waited for him to speak."I am sorry to be so late, Chris," he said."The fact is, I am all in.I
was driving the car out Seven Mile Run.We blew out a tire and the thing
turned over."Christine noticed then that his right arm was hanging inert by his side.CHAPTER XVI


Young Howe had been firmly resolved to give up all his bachelor habits
with his wedding day.In his indolent, rather selfish way, he was much
in love with his wife.But with the inevitable misunderstandings of the first months of
marriage had come a desire to be appreciated once again at his face
value.Grace had taken him, not for what he was, but for what he seemed
to be.She knew him now--all his small
indolences, his affectations, his weaknesses.Later on, like other
women since the world began, she would learn to dissemble, to affect to
believe him what he was not.And so, back to Grace six weeks after his wedding day came Palmer
Howe, not with a suggestion to renew the old relationship, but for
comradeship.Christine sulked--he wanted good cheer; Christine was intolerant--he
wanted tolerance; she disapproved of him and showed her disapproval--he
wanted approval.He wanted life to be comfortable and cheerful, without
recriminations, a little work and much play, a drink when one was
thirsty.Distorted though it was, and founded on a wrong basis, perhaps,
deep in his heart Palmer's only longing was for happiness; but this
happiness must be of an active sort--not content, which is passive, but
enjoyment.No taxi working its head
off for us.Just a little run over the country roads, eh?"It was the afternoon of the day before Christine's night visit to
Sidney.The office had been closed, owing to a death, and Palmer was in
possession of a holiday."We'll go out to the Climbing Rose and have
supper.""That's not true, Grace, and you know it."The roads are frozen hard; an hour's run
into the country will bring your color back."Go and ride with your wife," said the girl,
and flung away from him.The last few weeks had filled out her thin figure, but she still bore
traces of her illness.She
looked curiously boyish, almost sexless.Because she saw him wince when she mentioned Christine, her ill temper
increased."You get out of here," she said suddenly."I didn't ask you to come
back.You always knew I would have to marry some day."I didn't hear any reports of you hanging
around the hospital to learn how I was getting along."Besides, one of--" He hesitated over his wife's name."A
girl I know very well was in the training-school.There would have been
the devil to pay if I'd as much as called up.""You never told me you were going to get married."Cornered, he slipped an arm around her."I meant to tell you, honey; but you got sick.Anyhow, I--I hated to
tell you, honey."There was a comfortable feeling of
coming home about going there again.And, now that the worst minute of
their meeting was over, he was visibly happier.But Grace continued to
stand eyeing him somberly."I've got something to tell you," she said."Don't have a fit, and don't
laugh.If you do, I'll--I'll jump out of the window.I've got a place in
a store.She was a nice girl and he was fond of her.And he was not unselfish about it.He did not want her to belong to any one else."One of the nurses in the hospital, a Miss Page, has got me something to
do at Lipton and Homburg's.I am going on for the January white sale.If
I make good they will keep me."He had put her aside without a qualm; and now he met her announcement
with approval.They would have a holiday
together, and then they would say good-bye.He was getting off well, all things considered.But that isn't any
reason why we shouldn't be friends, is it?I would like to feel that I can stop in now and then and say how do you
do."The mention of Sidney's name brought up in his mind Christine as he had
left her that morning.She used to be a good sport,
but she had never been the same since the day of the wedding.He thought
her attitude toward him was one of suspicion.But any attempt on his part to fathom it only met with cold silence."I'll tell you what we'll do," he said."We won't go to any of the old
places.I've found a new roadhouse in the country that's respectable
enough to suit anybody.We'll go out to Schwitter's and get some dinner.And on the way out he lived up to the letter of
their agreement.The situation exhilarated him: Grace with her new air
of virtue, her new aloofness; his comfortable car; Johnny Rosenfeld's
discreet back and alert ears.The adventure had all the thrill of a new conquest in it.He treated the
girl with deference, did not insist when she refused a cigarette, felt
glowingly virtuous and exultant at the same time.When the car drew up before the Schwitter place, he slipped a
five-dollar bill into Johnny Rosenfeld's not over-clean hand."I don't mind the ears," he said.And
Johnny stalled his engine in sheer surprise."There's just enough of the Jew in me," said Johnny, "to know how to
talk a lot and say nothing, Mr.He crawled stiffly out of the car and prepared to crank it."I'll just give her the 'once over' now and then," he said."She'll
freeze solid if I let her stand."Grace had gone up the narrow path to the house.She had the gift of
looking well in her clothes, and her small hat with its long quill
and her motor-coat were chic and becoming.She never overdressed, as
Christine was inclined to do.Fortunately for Palmer, Tillie did not see him.A heavy German maid
waited at the table in the dining-room, while Tillie baked waffles in
the kitchen.Johnny Rosenfeld, going around the side path to the kitchen door with
visions of hot coffee and a country supper for his frozen stomach, saw
her through the window bending flushed over the stove, and hesitated.Then, without a word, he tiptoed back to the car again, and, crawling
into the tonneau, covered himself with rugs.In his untutored mind were
certain great qualities, and loyalty to his employer was one.The five
dollars in his pocket had nothing whatever to do with it.At eighteen he had developed a philosophy of four words.It took the
place of the Golden Rule, the Ten Commandments, and the Catechism.It
was: "Mind your own business."The discovery of Tillie's hiding-place interested but did not thrill
him.If she wanted to do the sort of thing she
was doing, that was her affair.Tillie and her middle-aged lover, Palmer
Howe and Grace--the alley was not unfamiliar with such relationships.It
viewed them with tolerance until they were found out, when it raised its
hands.True to his promise, Palmer wakened the sleeping boy before nine
o'clock.Grace had eaten little and drunk nothing; but Howe was slightly
stimulated."Give her the 'once over,'" he told Johnny, "and then go back and crawl
into the rugs again.Their progress was slow and rough over the
country roads, but when they reached the State road Howe threw open the
throttle.He took chances
and got away with them, laughing at the girl's gasps of dismay."Wait until I get beyond Simkinsville," he said, "and I'll let her out.The girl sat beside him with her eyes fixed ahead.He had been drinking,
and the warmth of the liquor was in his voice.She was going to make him live up to the letter of his promise to
go away at the house door; and more and more she realized that it would
be difficult.Instead of laughing when
she drew back from a proffered caress, he turned surly.Obstinate lines
that she remembered appeared from his nostrils to the corners of his
mouth.Finally she hit on a plan to make him stop somewhere in her neighborhood
and let her get out of the car.Now it passed them, and as
often they passed it.Palmer's car lost on
the hills, but gained on the long level stretches, which gleamed with a
coating of thin ice."I wish you'd let them get ahead, Palmer."I told you we'd travel to-night."What the deuce was the matter with
women, anyhow?Here was Grace as
sober as Christine.His light car skidded and struck the big car heavily.On a smooth road
perhaps nothing more serious than broken mudguards would have been the
result.But on the ice the small car slewed around and slid over the
edge of the bank.At the bottom of the declivity it turned over.Howe freed himself and stood
erect, with one arm hanging at his side.There was no sound at all from
the boy under the tonneau.Down the bank plunged a heavy, gorilla-like
figure, long arms pushing aside the frozen branches of trees.When he
reached the car, O'Hara found Grace sitting unhurt on the ground.In the
wreck of the car the lamps had not been extinguished, and by their light
he made out Howe, swaying dizzily.The other members of O'Hara's party had crawled down the bank by that
time.With the aid of a jack, they got the car up.Johnny Rosenfeld lay
doubled on his face underneath.When he came to and opened his eyes,
Grace almost shrieked with relief."I'm all right," said Johnny Rosenfeld.And, when they offered him
whiskey: "Away with the fire-water.I--I--" A spasm of
pain twisted his face.With his arms he lifted
himself to a sitting position, and fell back again.CHAPTER XVII


By Christmas Day Sidney was back in the hospital, a little wan, but
valiantly determined to keep her life to its mark of service.She had a
talk with K. the night before she left.Katie was out, and Sidney had put the dining-room in order.K. sat by
the table and watched her as she moved about the room.The past few weeks had been very wonderful to him: to help her up and
down the stairs, to read to her in the evenings as she lay on the couch
in the sewing-room; later, as she improved, to bring small dainties home
for her tray, and, having stood over Katie while she cooked them, to
bear them in triumph to that upper room--he had not been so happy in
years."I hope you don't feel as if you must stay on," she said anxiously."Not
that we don't want you--you know better than that.""There is no place else in the whole world that I want to go to," he
said simply."I seem to be always relying on somebody's kindness to--to keep things
together.First, for years and years, it was Aunt Harriet; now it is
you.""Don't you realize that, instead of your being grateful to me, it is
I who am undeniably grateful to you?I have lived
around--in different places and in different ways.I would rather be
here than anywhere else in the world."There was so much that was hopeless in his
eyes that he did not want her to see.She would be quite capable, he
told himself savagely, of marrying him out of sheer pity if she ever
guessed.And he was afraid--afraid, since he wanted her so much--that he
would be fool and weakling enough to take her even on those terms.Everything was ready for her return to the hospital.She had been out
that day to put flowers on the quiet grave where Anna lay with folded
hands; she had made her round of little visits on the Street; and now
her suit-case, packed, was in the hall."In one way, it will be a little better for you than if Christine and
Palmer were not in the house."She likes you, K. She depends on you, too, especially since that night
when you took care of Palmer's arm before we got Dr.I often think,
K., what a good doctor you would have been.You knew so well what to do
for mother."She still could not trust her voice about her mother."Palmer's arm is going to be quite straight.Ed is so proud of Max
over it.Once at least, whenever they were
together, she brought Max into the conversation.He is
interesting, don't you think?""Very," said K.

To save his life, he could not put any warmth into his voice.It was not in human nature to expect more of him."Those long talks you have, shut in your room--what in the world do you
talk about?She was a little jealous of those evenings, when she sat alone, or
when Harriet, sitting with her, made sketches under the lamp to the
accompaniment of a steady hum of masculine voices from across the hall.Max came in always, before he went,
and, leaning over the back of a chair, would inform her of the absolute
blankness of life in the hospital without her."I go every day because I must," he would assure her gayly; "but, I tell
you, the snap is gone out of it.When there was a chance that every cap
was YOUR cap, the mere progress along a corridor became thrilling."He
had a foreign trick of throwing out his hands, with a little shrug of
the shoulders.he said--which, being translated, means:
"What the devil's the use!"And K. would stand in the doorway, quietly smoking, or go back to his
room and lock away in his trunk the great German books on surgery with
which he and Max had been working out a case.So K. sat by the dining-room table and listened to her talk of Max that
last evening together.Rosenfeld to-day not to be too much discouraged about
Johnny.Now that you are
such friends,"--she eyed him wistfully,--"perhaps some day you will come
to one of his operations.Even if you didn't understand exactly, I know
it would thrill you.And--I'd like you to see me in my uniform, K. You
never have."She grew a little sad as the evening went on.She was going to miss K.
very much.While she was ill she had watched the clock for the time to
listen for him.She knew the way he slammed the front door.Palmer never
slammed the door.She knew too that, just after a bang that threatened
the very glass in the transom, K. would come to the foot of the stairs
and call:--

"Ahoy, there!""Aye, aye," she would answer--which was, he assured her, the proper
response.Whether he came up the stairs at once or took his way back to Katie had
depended on whether his tribute for the day was fruit or sweetbreads.He would miss her,
too; but he would have Harriet and Christine and--Max.Back in a circle
to Max, of course.She insisted, that last evening, on sitting up with him until midnight
ushered in Christmas Day.Christine and Palmer were out; Harriet, having
presented Sidney with a blouse that had been left over in the shop from
the autumn's business, had yawned herself to bed.When the bells announced midnight, Sidney roused with a start.She
realized that neither of them had spoken, and that K.The little clock on the shelf took up the burden of the
churches, and struck the hour in quick staccato notes.Sidney rose and went over to K., her black dress in soft folds about
her.Sidney left the little house at
six, with the street light still burning through a mist of falling snow.The hospital wards and corridors were still lighted when she went on
duty at seven o'clock.She had been assigned to the men's surgical ward,
and went there at once.She had not seen Carlotta Harrison since her
mother's death; but she found her on duty in the surgical ward.For the
second time in four months, the two girls were working side by side.Sidney's recollection of her previous service under Carlotta made her
nervous."We were all sorry to hear of your trouble," she said."I hope we shall
get on nicely."Sidney surveyed the ward, full to overflowing.At the far end two cots
had been placed."The ward is heavy, isn't it?"There are three of
us--you, myself, and a probationer."The first light of the Christmas morning was coming through the windows.Carlotta put out the lights and turned in a business-like way to her
records."The probationer's name is Wardwell," she said."Perhaps you'd better
help her with the breakfasts.If there's any way to make a mistake, she
makes it."It was after eight when Sidney found Johnny Rosenfeld.Suffering had refined the boy's features.His dark, heavily fringed eyes
looked at her from a pale face."I was in a private room; but it cost thirty plunks a week, so I moved.Sidney had not seen him since his accident.She had wished to go, but K.
had urged against it.She was not strong, and she had already suffered
much.And now the work of the ward pressed hard.She stood beside him and stroked his hand.He pretended to think that her sympathy was for his fall from the estate
of a private patient to the free ward."Oh, I'm all right, Miss Sidney," he said.Howe is paying six
dollars a week for me.The difference between me and the other fellows
around here is that I get a napkin on my tray and they don't.""Six dollars a week for a napkin is going some.I'm no bloated
aristocrat; I don't have to have a napkin.""Have they told you what the trouble is?"Max Wilson is going to
operate on me.What a thing it was
to be able to take this life-in-death of Johnny Rosenfeld's and make it
life again!All sorts of men made up Sidney's world: the derelicts who wandered
through the ward in flapping slippers, listlessly carrying trays; the
unshaven men in the beds, looking forward to another day of boredom, if
not of pain; Palmer Howe with his broken arm; K., tender and strong, but
filling no especial place in the world.Towering over them all was the
younger Wilson.He meant for her, that Christmas morning, all that the
other men were not--to their weakness strength, courage, daring, power.Johnny Rosenfeld lay back on the pillows and watched her face."When I was a kid," he said, "and ran along the Street, calling Dr.Max
a dude, I never thought I'd lie here watching that door to see him come
in.Ain't it the hell of a world, anyhow?It
ain't much of a Christmas to you, either."Sidney fed him his morning beef tea, and, because her eyes filled up
with tears now and then at his helplessness, she was not so skillful as
she might have been.When one spoonful had gone down his neck, he smiled
up at her whimsically.As much as was possible, the hospital rested on that Christmas Day.The
internes went about in fresh white ducks with sprays of mistletoe in
their buttonholes, doing few dressings.Over the upper floors, where the
kitchens were located, spread toward noon the insidious odor of roasting
turkeys.Every ward had its vase of holly.In the afternoon, services
were held in the chapel downstairs.Wheel-chairs made their slow progress along corridors and down
elevators.Convalescents who were able to walk flapped along in carpet
slippers.Outside the wide doors of the corridor
the wheel-chairs were arranged in a semicircle.Behind them, dressed for
the occasion, were the elevator-men, the orderlies, and Big John, who
drove the ambulance.On one side of the aisle, near the front, sat the nurses in rows, in
crisp caps and fresh uniforms.On the other side had been reserved a
place for the staff.The internes stood back against the wall, ready to
run out between rejoicings, as it were--for a cigarette or an ambulance
call, as the case might be.Over everything brooded the after-dinner peace of Christmas afternoon.The nurses sang, and Sidney sang with them, her fresh young voice rising
above the rest.Yellow winter sunlight came through the stained-glass
windows and shone on her lovely flushed face, her smooth kerchief, her
cap, always just a little awry.Max, lounging against the wall, across the chapel, found his eyes
straying toward her constantly.What
a zest for living and for happiness she had!The Episcopal clergyman read the Epistle:

"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even
thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."She was good, and she had been anointed with the oil of
gladness.And he--

His brother was singing.His deep bass voice, not always true, boomed
out above the sound of the small organ.Ed had been a good brother to
him; he had been a good son.Max's vagrant mind wandered away from the service to the picture of his
mother over his brother's littered desk, to the Street, to K., to the
girl who had refused to marry him because she did not trust him, to
Carlotta last of all.He turned a little and ran his eyes along the line
of nurses.As if she were conscious of his scrutiny, she lifted
her head and glanced toward him.The nurses sang:--

     "O holy Child of Bethlehem!Descend to us, we pray;
      Cast out our sin, and enter in,
      Be born in us to-day."The wheel-chairs and convalescents quavered the familiar words.Ed's
heavy throat shook with earnestness.The Head, sitting a little apart with her hands folded in her lap and
weary with the suffering of the world, closed her eyes and listened.The Christmas morning had brought Sidney half a dozen gifts.K. sent her
a silver thermometer case with her monogram, Christine a toilet mirror.But the gift of gifts, over which Sidney's eyes had glowed, was a
great box of roses marked in Dr.Max's copper-plate writing, "From a
neighbor."Tucked in the soft folds of her kerchief was one of the roses that
afternoon.Max was waiting for Sidney in the
corridor.--she glanced down to the rose
she wore."The others make the most splendid bit of color in the ward.""They are not any the less mine because I am letting other people have a
chance to enjoy them."Under all his gayety he was curiously diffident with her.All the pretty
speeches he would have made to Carlotta under the circumstances died
before her frank glance.There were many things he wanted to say to her.He wanted to tell her
that he was sorry her mother had died; that the Street was empty without
her; that he looked forward to these daily meetings with her as a holy
man to his hour before his saint.What he really said was to inquire
politely whether she had had her Christmas dinner.Sidney eyed him, half amused, half hurt.Is it bad for discipline for us to be good
friends?"Something in her eyes roused
the devil of mischief that always slumbered in him."My car's been stalled in a snowdrift downtown since early this morning,
and I have Ed's Peggy in a sleigh.Put on your things and come for a
ride."He hoped Carlotta could hear what he said; to be certain of it, he
maliciously raised his voice a trifle.She was to be free that afternoon until six o'clock;
but she had promised to go home.Ten to one, he's with her now."The
heavy odor of the hospital, mingled with the scent of pine and evergreen
in the chapel; made her dizzy.And,
besides, if K. were with Christine--

"It's forbidden, isn't it?""And yet, you continue to tempt me and expect me to yield!""One of the most delightful things about temptation is yielding now and
then."Here was her old friend and
neighbor asking to take her out for a daylight ride.The swift rebellion
of youth against authority surged up in Sidney.Carlotta had gone by that time--gone with hate in her heart and black
despair.She knew very well what the issue would be.Sidney would drive
with him, and he would tell her how lovely she looked with the air on
her face and the snow about her.The jerky motion of the little sleigh
would throw them close together.He would
touch Sidney's hand daringly and smile in her eyes.That was his method:
to play at love-making like an audacious boy, until quite suddenly the
cloak dropped and the danger was there.The Christmas excitement had not died out in the ward when Carlotta went
back to it.On each bedside table was an orange, and beside it a pair
of woolen gloves and a folded white handkerchief.There were sprays of
holly scattered about, too, and the after-dinner content of roast turkey
and ice-cream.The lame girl who played the violin limped down the corridor into the
ward.She was greeted with silence, that truest tribute, and with the
instant composing of the restless ward to peace.She was pretty in a young, pathetic way, and because to her Christmas
was a festival and meant hope and the promise of the young Lord, she
played cheerful things.The ward sat up, remembered that it was not the Sabbath, smiled across
from bed to bed.The probationer, whose name was Wardwell, was a tall, lean girl with a
long, pointed nose.She kept up a running accompaniment of small talk to
the music."Last Christmas," she said plaintively, "we went out into the country
in a hay-wagon and had a real time.I don't know what I am here for,
anyhow."Turkey and goose, mince pie and pumpkin pie, four kinds of cake; that's
the sort of spread we have up in our part of the world.When I think of
what I sat down to to-day--!"She had a profound respect for Carlotta, and her motto in the hospital
differed from Sidney's in that it was to placate her superiors, while
Sidney's had been to care for her patients.Seeing Carlotta bored, she ventured a little gossip.She had idly
glued the label of a medicine bottle on the back of her hand, and was
scratching a skull and cross-bones on it."I wonder if you have noticed something," she said, eyes on the label."I have noticed that the three-o'clock medicines are not given," said
Carlotta sharply; and Miss Wardwell, still labeled and adorned, made the
rounds of the ward."I'm no gossip," she said, putting the tray on the table."If you won't
see, you won't.As it was not required that tears be recorded on the record, Carlotta
paid no attention to this.Miss Wardwell swelled with importance
and let her superior ask her twice.A hand seemed to catch Carlotta's heart and hold it.Being an old friend doesn't make you look at a girl as if you
wanted to take a bite out of her.Mark my word, Miss Harrison, she'll
never finish her training; she'll marry him.I wish," concluded the
probationer plaintively, "that some good-looking fellow like that would
take a fancy to me.I am as ugly as a mud fence, but
I've got style."She was long and sinuous, but she wore her
lanky, ill-fitting clothes with a certain distinction.Harriet Kennedy
would have dressed her in jade green to match her eyes, and with long
jade earrings, and made her a fashion.The violinist had seen the tears on Johnny
Rosenfeld's white cheeks, and had rushed into rollicking, joyous music."I'm twenty-one and she's eighteen," hummed the
ward under its breath."Lord, how I'd like to dance!If I ever get out of this charnel-house!"The medicine-tray lay at Carlotta's elbow; beside it the box of labels.Carlotta knew it down to the depths of
her tortured brain.As inevitably as the night followed the day, she was
losing her game.She had lost already, unless--

If she could get Sidney out of the hospital, it would simplify things.She surmised shrewdly that on the Street their interests were wide
apart.It was here that they met on common ground.The lame violin-player limped out of the ward; the shadows of the
early winter twilight settled down.At five o'clock Carlotta sent Miss
Wardwell to first supper, to the surprise of that seldom surprised
person.The ward lay still or shuffled abut quietly.Christmas was over,
and there were no evening papers to look forward to.Carlotta gave the five-o'clock medicines.Then she sat down at the table
near the door, with the tray in front of her.There are certain thoughts
that are at first functions of the brain; after a long time the spinal
cord takes them up and converts them into acts almost automatically.Perhaps because for the last month she had done the thing so often in
her mind, its actual performance was almost without conscious thought.Carlotta took a bottle from her medicine cupboard, and, writing a new
label for it, pasted it over the old one.Then she exchanged it for one
of the same size on the medicine tray.In the dining-room, at the probationers' table, Miss Wardwell was
talking."Believe me," she said, "me for the country and the simple life after
this.They think I'm only a probationer and don't see anything, but I've
got eyes in my head.Wilson, and she
thinks I don't see it.But never mind; I paid, her up to-day for a few
of the jolts she has given me."Throughout the dining-room busy and competent young women came and ate,
hastily or leisurely as their opportunity was, and went on their way
again.In their hands they held the keys, not always of life and death
perhaps, but of ease from pain, of tenderness, of smooth pillows, and
cups of water to thirsty lips.In their eyes, as in Sidney's, burned the
light of service.But here and there one found women, like Carlotta and Miss Wardwell,
who had mistaken their vocation, who railed against the monotony of the
life, its limitations, its endless sacrifices.Fifty or so against two--fifty who looked out on the world with the
fearless glance of those who have seen life to its depths, and, with the
broad understanding of actual contact, still found it good.Fifty who
were learning or had learned not to draw aside their clean starched
skirts from the drab of the streets.And the fifty, who found the very
scum of the gutters not too filthy for tenderness and care, let Carlotta
and, in lesser measure, the new probationer alone.They could not have
voiced their reasons.The supper-room was filled with their soft voices, the rustle of their
skirts, the gleam of their stiff white caps.When Carlotta came in, she greeted none of them.They did not like her,
and she knew it.Before her, instead of the tidy supper-table, she was seeing the
medicine-tray as she had left it."I guess I've fixed her," she said to herself.Her very soul was sick with fear of what she had done.CHAPTER XVIII


K. saw Sidney for only a moment on Christmas Day.This was when the gay
little sleigh had stopped in front of the house.Sidney had hurried radiantly in for a moment.Christine's parlor was
gay with firelight and noisy with chatter and with the clatter of her
tea-cups.K., lounging indolently in front of the fire, had turned to see Sidney
in the doorway, and leaped to his feet."I can't come in," she cried.I am out
sleigh-riding with Dr."Ask him in for a cup of tea," Christine called out."Here's Aunt
Harriet and mother and even Palmer!"Christine had aged during the last weeks, but she was putting up a brave
front.Sidney ran to the front door and called: "Will you come in for a cup of
tea?"As Sidney turned back into the house, she met Palmer.He had come out
in the hall, and had closed the door into the parlor behind him.His arm
was still in splints, and swung suspended in a gay silk sling.The sound of laughter came through the door faintly.The boy's face was
always with him."Better in some ways, but of
