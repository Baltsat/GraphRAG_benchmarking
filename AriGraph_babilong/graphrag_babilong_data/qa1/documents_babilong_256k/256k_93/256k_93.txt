It was disorganizing, bad for discipline.Sidney was very happy all that summer.She glowed with pride when her
lover put through a difficult piece of work; flushed and palpitated when
she heard his praises sung; grew to know, by a sort of intuition, when
he was in the house.She wore his ring on a fine chain around her neck,
and grew prettier every day.Once or twice, however, when she was at home, away from the glamour, her
early fears obsessed her.He was so handsome
and so gifted, and there were women who were mad about him.That was the
gossip of the hospital.Suppose she married him and he tired of her?In
her humility she thought that perhaps only her youth, and such charm as
she had that belonged to youth, held him.And before her, always, she
saw the tragic women of the wards.Sidney had been insistent, and
Harriet had topped the argument in her businesslike way."If you insist
on being an idiot and adopting the Rosenfeld family," she said, "wait
until September.The season for boarders doesn't begin until fall."So K. waited for "the season," and ate his heart out for Sidney in the
interval.Johnny Rosenfeld still lay in his ward, inert from the waist down.As a matter of fact, he was watching the
boy closely, at Max Wilson's request."Tell me when I'm to do it," said Wilson, "and when the time comes,
for God's sake, stand by me.He's got so much
confidence that I'll help him that I don't dare to fail."So K. came on visiting days, and, by special dispensation, on Saturday
afternoons.Not that he knew
anything about it himself; but, by means of a blind teacher, he kept
just one lesson ahead.It found
something absurd and rather touching in this tall, serious young man
with the surprisingly deft fingers, tying raffia knots.The first basket went, by Johnny's request, to Sidney Page."I want her to have it," he said."She got corns on her fingers from
rubbing me when I came in first; and, besides--"

"Yes?"said K. He was tying a most complicated knot, and could not look
up."I'm not going to get in wrong by
talking, but I know something.K. looked up then, and surprised Johnny's secret in his face."If I'd squealed she'd have finished me for good.I'm not running in 2.40 these days.""I'll not tell, or make it uncomfortable for you.The ward was in the somnolence of mid-afternoon.The nearest patient, a man in a wheel-chair, was snoring heavily."It was the dark-eyed one that changed the medicine on me," he said."The one with the heels that were always tapping around, waking me up.After all, it was only what K. had suspected before.But a sense of
impending danger to Sidney obsessed him.If Carlotta would do that, what
would she do when she learned of the engagement?The odd coincidence of
their paths crossing again troubled him.Carlotta Harrison was well again, and back on duty.Luckily for Sidney,
her three months' service in the operating-room kept them apart.For
Carlotta was now not merely jealous.It had been her theory that
Wilson would not marry easily--that, in a sense, he would have to be
coerced into marriage.Some clever woman would marry him some day, and
no one would be more astonished than himself.She thought merely that
Sidney was playing a game like her own, with different weapons.So she
planned her battle, ignorant that she had lost already.She stopped sulking, met Max with smiles,
made no overtures toward a renewal of their relations.To desert a woman was justifiable,
under certain circumstances.But to desert a woman, and have her
apparently not even know it, was against the rules of the game.During a surgical dressing in a private room, one day, he allowed his
fingers to touch hers, as on that day a year before when she had taken
Miss Simpson's place in his office.He was rewarded by the same slow,
smouldering glance that had caught his attention before.A new interne had come into the
house, and was going through the process of learning that from a senior
at the medical school to a half-baked junior interne is a long step
back.He had to endure the good-humored contempt of the older men, the
patronizing instructions of nurses as to rules.His uneasy rounds in
Carlotta's precinct took on the state and form of staff visitations.She
flattered, cajoled, looked up to him.After a time it dawned on Wilson that this junior cub was getting more
attention than himself: that, wherever he happened to be, somewhere in
the offing would be Carlotta and the Lamb, the latter eyeing her with
worship.The enthroning of a
successor galled him.Between them, the Lamb suffered mightily--was
subject to frequent "bawling out," as he termed it, in the
operating-room as he assisted the anaesthetist.He took his troubles to
Carlotta, who soothed him in the corridor--in plain sight of her quarry,
of course--by putting a sympathetic hand on his sleeve.Then, one day, Wilson was goaded to speech."For the love of Heaven, Carlotta," he said impatiently, "stop making
love to that wretched boy.He wriggles like a worm if you look at him."I respect him, and--he respects
me.""It's rather a silly game, you know."I--I don't really care a lot about him, Max.Her attraction for him was almost gone--not quite.She lifted her eyes to his, and for once she was not
acting."I knew it would end, of course.Why, after all, should he not be her friend?He
had treated her cruelly, hideously.If she still desired his friendship,
there was no disloyalty to Sidney in giving it.Not once again did she allow him to see what lay in her eyes.She had
a chance to take up institutional work.She abhorred the thought of
private duty.The Lamb was hovering near, hot eyes on them both."Come to the office and we'll talk it over.""I don't like to go there; Miss Simpson is suspicious."The institution she spoke of was in another city.It occurred to
Wilson that if she took it the affair would have reached a graceful and
legitimate end.Also, the thought of another stolen evening alone with her was not
unpleasant.It would be the last, he promised himself.After all, it was
owing to her.Sidney would be at a lecture that night."Suppose you meet me at the old corner," he said carelessly, eyes on
the Lamb, who was forgetting that he was only a junior interne and was
glaring ferociously."We'll run out into the country and talk things
over."She demurred, with her heart beating triumphantly."What's the use of going back to that?When at last she had yielded, and he
made his way down to the smoking-room, it was with the feeling that he
had won a victory.K. had been uneasy all that day; his ledgers irritated him.He had been
sleeping badly since Sidney's announcement of her engagement.At five
o'clock, when he left the office, he found Joe Drummond waiting outside
on the pavement."Mother said you'd been up to see me a couple of times.I'll go about
town for a half-hour or so."Thus forestalled, K. found his subject hard to lead up to.But here
again Joe met him more than halfway."Well, go on," he said, when they found themselves in the park; "I don't
suppose you were paying a call.""I guess I know what you are going to say.""I'm not going to preach, if you're expecting that.Ordinarily, if a man
insists on making a fool of himself, I let him alone.""One reason is that I happen to like you.The other reason is that,
whether you admit it or not, you are acting like a young idiot, and are
putting the responsibility on the shoulders of some one else."You are a man, and you are acting like a bad boy.It's a
disappointment to me.She's going to marry Wilson, isn't she?"If I'd go to her
to-night and tell her what I know, she'd never see him again."The idea,
thus born in his overwrought brain, obsessed him.He was not certain that the boy's
statement had any basis in fact.His single determination was to save
Sidney from any pain.When Joe suddenly announced his inclination to go out into the country
after all, he suspected a ruse to get rid of him, and insisted on going
along."Car's at Bailey's garage," he said sullenly."I don't know when I'll
get back."That passed unnoticed until they were on the highroad, with the car
running smoothly between yellowing fields of wheat.Then:--

"So you've got it too!"We'd both
be better off if I sent the car over a bank."He gave the wheel a reckless twist, and Le Moyne called him to time
sternly.They had supper at the White Springs Hotel--not on the terrace, but in
the little room where Carlotta and Wilson had taken their first meal
together.K. ordered beer for them both, and Joe submitted with bad
grace.K. found him more amenable to
reason, and, gaining his confidence, learned of his desire to leave the
city."I'm the only one, and mother yells blue
murder when I talk about it.His dilated pupils became more normal, his
restless hands grew quiet.'s even voice, the picture he drew of
life on the island, the stillness of the little hotel in its mid-week
dullness, seemed to quiet the boy's tortured nerves.He was nearer
to peace than he had been for many days.But he smoked incessantly,
lighting one cigarette from another.At ten o'clock he left K. and went for the car.He paused for a moment,
rather sheepishly, by K."I'm feeling a lot better," he said."I haven't got the band around my
head.That was the last K. saw of Joe Drummond until the next day.CHAPTER XXIV


Carlotta dressed herself with unusual care--not in black this time, but
in white.She coiled her yellow hair in a soft knot at the back of her
head, and she resorted to the faintest shading of rouge.The ride was to be a bright spot in Wilson's memory.He expected recriminations; she meant to make him happy.That was the
secret of the charm some women had for men.They went to such women to
forget their troubles.She set the hour of their meeting at nine, when
the late dusk of summer had fallen; and she met him then, smiling, a
faintly perfumed white figure, slim and young, with a thrill in her
voice that was only half assumed."Surely you are not going to be back at
ten.""I have special permission to be out late."And then, recollecting their new situation: "We have a lot to
talk over.At the White Springs Hotel they stopped to fill the gasolene tank of the
car.Joe Drummond saw Wilson there, in the sheet-iron garage alongside
of the road.It did not occur to Joe
that the white figure in the car was not Sidney.He went rather white,
and stepped out of the zone of light.The influence of Le Moyne was
still on him, however, and he went on quietly with what he was doing.But his hands shook as he filled the radiator.When Wilson's car had gone on, he went automatically about his
preparations for the return trip--lifted a seat cushion to investigate
his own store of gasolene, replacing carefully the revolver he always
carried under the seat and packed in waste to prevent its accidental
discharge, lighted his lamps, examined a loose brake-band.He had been an ass: Le Moyne was right.He'd
get away--to Cuba if he could--and start over again.He would forget the
Street and let it forget him."To Schwitter's, of course," one of them grumbled."We might as well go
out of business.""There's no money in running a straight place.Schwitter and half a
dozen others are getting rich.""That was Wilson, the surgeon in town.He cut off my brother-in-law's
leg--charged him as much as if he had grown a new one for him.Now he goes to Schwitter's, like the rest.So Max Wilson was taking Sidney to Schwitter's, making her the butt of
garage talk!Joe's hands grew cold, his
head hot.A red mist spread between him and the line of electric lights.He knew Schwitter's, and he knew Wilson.He flung himself into his car and threw the throttle open."You can't start like that, son," one of the men remonstrated."You let
'er in too fast."Joe snarled, and made a second ineffectual effort.Thus adjured, the men offered neither further advice nor assistance.The
minutes went by in useless cranking--fifteen.But when K., growing uneasy, came out
into the yard, the engine had started at last.He was in time to see Joe
run his car into the road and turn it viciously toward Schwitter's.Carlotta's nearness was having its calculated effect on Max Wilson.His
spirits rose as the engine, marking perfect time, carried them along the
quiet roads.Partly it was reaction--relief that she should be so reasonable, so
complaisant--and a sort of holiday spirit after the day's hard work.Oddly enough, and not so irrational as may appear, Sidney formed a
part of the evening's happiness--that she loved him; that, back in the
lecture-room, eyes and even mind on the lecturer, her heart was with
him.So, with Sidney the basis of his happiness, he made the most of his
evening's freedom.He sang a little in his clear tenor--even, once when
they had slowed down at a crossing, bent over audaciously and kissed
Carlotta's hand in the full glare of a passing train."I like to be reckless," he replied.She did not want the situation to get
out of hand.Moreover, what was so real for her was only too plainly a
lark for him.The hopelessness of her situation was dawning on her.Even when the
touch of her beside him and the solitude of the country roads got in
his blood, and he bent toward her, she found no encouragement in his
words:--"I am mad about you to-night."She took her courage in her hands:--"Then why give me up for some one
else?"No one else will
ever care as I do."I don't care for anyone else in the
world.If you let me go I'll want to die."Then, as he was silent:--

"If you'll marry me, I'll be true to you all my life.The sense, if not the words, of what he had sworn to Sidney that Sunday
afternoon under the trees, on this very road!Swift shame overtook
him, that he should be here, that he had allowed Carlotta to remain in
ignorance of how things really stood between them.I'm engaged to marry some one
else."He was ashamed at the way she took the news.If she had stormed or wept,
he would have known what to do."You must have expected it, sooner or later."He thought she might faint, and looked at her
anxiously.Her profile, indistinct beside him, looked white and drawn.If their
escapade became known, it would end things between Sidney and him.It must become known
without any apparent move on her part.If, for instance, she became ill,
and was away from the hospital all night, that might answer.The thing
would be investigated, and who knew--

The car turned in at Schwitter's road and drew up before the house.The narrow porch was filled with small tables, above which hung rows of
electric lights enclosed in Japanese paper lanterns.Midweek, which had
found the White Springs Hotel almost deserted, saw Schwitter's crowded
tables set out under the trees.Seeing the crowd, Wilson drove directly
to the yard and parked his machine."No need of running any risk," he explained to the still figure beside
him."We can walk back and take a table under the trees, away from those
infernal lanterns."She reeled a little as he helped her out.She leaned rather
heavily on him as they walked toward the house.The faint perfume that
had almost intoxicated him, earlier, vaguely irritated him now.At the rear of the house she shook off his arm and preceded him around
the building.She chose the end of the porch as the place in which to
drop, and went down like a stone, falling back.The visitors at Schwitter's were too
much engrossed with themselves to be much interested.She opened her
eyes almost as soon as she fell--to forestall any tests; she was
shrewd enough to know that Wilson would detect her malingering very
quickly--and begged to be taken into the house."I feel very ill," she
said, and her white face bore her out.Schwitter and Bill carried her in and up the stairs to one of the newly
furnished rooms.He had a
horror of knockout drops and the police.They laid her on the bed, her
hat beside her; and Wilson, stripping down the long sleeve of her glove,
felt her pulse."There's a doctor in the next town," said Schwitter."I was going to
send for him, anyhow--my wife's not very well."He closed the door behind the relieved figure of the landlord, and,
going back to Carlotta, stood looking down at her."You were no more faint than I am."The lanterns--"

He crossed the room deliberately and went out, closing the door behind
him.He saw at once where he stood--in what danger.If she insisted
that she was ill and unable to go back, there would be a fuss.At the foot of the stairs, Schwitter pulled himself together.After all,
the girl was only ill.The doctor ought to be here by this time.Tillie was alone, out
in the harness-room.He looked through the crowded rooms, at the
overflowing porch with its travesty of pleasure, and he hated the whole
thing with a desperate hatred.A young man edged his way into the hall and confronted him."Upstairs--first bedroom to the right."Surely, as
a man sowed he reaped.At the top, on the landing, he confronted
Wilson.He fired at him without a word--saw him fling up his arms and
fall back, striking first the wall, then the floor.The buzz of conversation on the porch suddenly ceased.Joe put his
revolver in his pocket and went quietly down the stairs.The crowd
parted to let him through.Carlotta, crouched in her room, listening, not daring to open the door,
heard the sound of a car as it swung out into the road.CHAPTER XXV


On the evening of the shooting at Schwitter's, there had been a late
operation at the hospital.Sidney, having duly transcribed her lecture
notes and said her prayers, was already asleep when she received the
insistent summons to the operating-room.These night battles with death roused all her fighting blood.There were times when she felt as if, by sheer will, she could force
strength, life itself, into failing bodies.Her sensitive nostrils
dilated, her brain worked like a machine.That night she received well-deserved praise.When the Lamb, telephoning
hysterically, had failed to locate the younger Wilson, another staff
surgeon was called.His keen eyes watched Sidney--felt her capacity, her
fiber, so to speak; and, when everything was over, he told her what was
in his mind."Don't wear yourself out, girl," he said gravely.It was good work to-night--fine work.By midnight the work was done, and the nurse in charge sent Sidney to
bed.It was the Lamb who received the message about Wilson; and because he
was not very keen at the best, and because the news was so startling, he
refused to credit his ears.I mustn't make a mess of this."Wilson, the surgeon, has been shot," came slowly and distinctly."Get the staff there and have a room ready.Get the operating-room
ready, too."The Lamb wakened then, and roused the house.He was incoherent, rather,
so that Dr.Ed got the impression that it was Le Moyne who had been
shot, and only learned the truth when he got to the hospital.He liked K., and his heart was sore within
him.Staff's in the
executive committee room, sir."I thought you said--"

The Lamb turned pale at that, and braced himself."I'm sorry--I thought you understood.Ed, who was heavy and not very young, sat down on an office chair.Out of sheer habit he had brought the bag.He put it down on the floor
beside him, and moistened his lips.The Lamb stood by the door, and Dr.Outside the windows, the night world went
by--taxi-cabs full of roisterers, women who walked stealthily close
to the buildings, a truck carrying steel, so heavy that it shook the
hospital as it rumbled by.The bag with the dog-collar in it was on the
floor.He thought of many things, but mostly of the promise he had made
his mother.And, having forgotten the injured man's shortcomings, he
was remembering his good qualities--his cheerfulness, his courage, his
achievements.He remembered the day Max had done the Edwardes operation,
and how proud he had been of him.He figured out how old he was--not
thirty-one yet, and already, perhaps--There he stopped thinking.Cold
beads of sweat stood out on his forehead."I think I hear them now, sir," said the Lamb, and stood back
respectfully to let him pass out of the door.Carlotta stayed in the room during the consultation.No one seemed to
wonder why she was there, or to pay any attention to her.Ed beside the bed, and
then closed in again.Carlotta waited, her hand over her mouth to keep herself from screaming.Surely they would operate; they wouldn't let him die like that!When she saw the phalanx break up, and realized that they would not
operate, she went mad.She stood against the door, and accused them of
cowardice--taunted them."Do you think he would let any of you die like that?""Die
like a hurt dog, and none of you to lift a hand?"It was Pfeiffer who drew her out of the room and tried to talk reason
and sanity to her."If there was a chance, we'd operate, and you
know it."The staff went hopelessly down the stairs to the smoking-room, and
smoked.The night assistant sent coffee down
to them, and they drank it.Ed stayed in his brother's room, and
said to his mother, under his breath, that he'd tried to do his best by
Max, and that from now on it would be up to her.The country doctor had come, too,
finding Tillie's trial not imminent.On the way in he had taken it
for granted that K. was a medical man like himself, and had placed his
hypodermic case at his disposal.When he missed him,--in the smoking-room, that was,--he asked for him."I don't see the chap who came in with us," he said.K. sat alone on a bench in the hall.He wondered who would tell Sidney;
he hoped they would be very gentle with her.He sat in the shadow,
waiting.He did not want to go home and leave her to what she might have
to face.There was a chance she would ask for him.He wanted to be near,
in that case.He sat in the shadow, on the bench.The night watchman went by twice and
stared at him.At last he asked K. to mind the door until he got some
coffee."One of the staff's been hurt," he explained."If I don't get some
coffee now, I won't get any."Somehow, she had not thought
of it before.Now she wondered how she could have failed to think of it.If only she could find him and he would do it!She would go down on her
knees--would tell him everything, if only he would consent.When she found him on his bench, however, she passed him by.She had a
terrible fear that he might go away if she put the thing to him first.So first she went to the staff and confronted them.They were men of
courage, only declining to undertake what they considered hopeless work.The one man among them who might have done the thing with any chance
of success lay stricken.Not one among them but would have given of his
best--only his best was not good enough."It would be the Edwardes operation, wouldn't it?"There were no rules to cover such conduct on
the part of a nurse.One of them--Pfeiffer again, by chance--replied
rather heavily:--

"If any, it would be the Edwardes operation."How
did this thing happen, Miss Harrison?"Her face was ghastly, save for the trace of
rouge; her eyes were red-rimmed.Edwardes is sitting on a bench in the hall outside!"He was to take up the old
burden.Ed remembered
about her when, tracing his brother's career from his babyhood to man's
estate and to what seemed now to be its ending, he had remembered that
Max was very fond of Sidney.He had hoped that Sidney would take him and
do for him what he, Ed, had failed to do.She thought it was another operation, and her spirit was just a little
weary.She forced her shoes on her
tired feet, and bathed her face in cold water to rouse herself.He was fond of Sidney; she always
smiled at him; and, on his morning rounds at six o'clock to waken the
nurses, her voice was always amiable.So she found him in the hall,
holding a cup of tepid coffee.He was old and bleary, unmistakably dirty
too--but he had divined Sidney's romance.She took it obediently, but over the cup her eyes searched his.He had had another name, but it was
lost in the mists of years.So she finished it, not without anxiety that she might be needed.But
daddy's attentions were for few, and not to be lightly received."Can you stand a piece of bad news?"Strangely, her first thought was of K.It ain't much, but I guess you'd like to know
it."So she went down alone to the room where Dr.Ed sat in a chair, with
his untidy bag beside him on the floor, and his eyes fixed on a straight
figure on the bed.When he saw Sidney, he got up and put his arms around
her.His eyes told her the truth before he told her anything.She hardly
listened to what he said.The fact was all that concerned her--that her
lover was dying there, so near that she could touch him with her hand,
so far away that no voice, no caress of hers, could reach him.Ed's arms
about her, and wait.Sidney's voice sounded strange to her
ears.For suddenly Sidney's small world, which
had always sedately revolved in one direction, began to move the other
way.The door opened, and the staff came in.But where before they had
moved heavily, with drooped heads, now they came quickly, as men with a
purpose.There was a tall man in a white coat with them.He ordered them
about like children, and they hastened to do his will.At first Sidney
only knew that now, at last, they were going to do something--the tall
man was going to do something.He stood with his back to Sidney, and
gave orders.The nurses stood
by, while the staff did nurses' work.The senior surgical interne,
essaying assistance, was shoved aside by the senior surgical consultant,
and stood by, aggrieved.It was the Lamb, after all, who brought the news to Sidney.Ed, and she was alone now, her face buried
against the back of a chair."There'll be something doing now, Miss Page," he offered.Do you know who's going to do it?"His voice echoed the subdued excitement of the room--excitement and new
hope."Did you ever hear of Edwardes, the surgeon?--the Edwardes operation,
you know.They found him
sitting on a bench in the hall downstairs."Sidney raised her head, but she could not see the miraculously found
Edwardes.She could see the familiar faces of the staff, and that other
face on the pillow, and--she gave a little cry.John went back to the garden.How like
him to be there, to be wherever anyone was in trouble!Tears came to her
eyes--the first tears she had shed.As if her eyes had called him, he looked up and saw her.The staff stood back to let him pass, and gazed after him.The wonder of what had happened was growing on them.K. stood beside Sidney, and looked down at her.Just at first it seemed
as if he found nothing to say.Then:

"There's just a chance, Sidney dear.If a shadow passed over his face, no one saw it."I'll not ask you to go back to your room.If you will wait somewhere
near, I'll see that you have immediate word.""I am going to the operating-room."She was
not herself, of course, what with strain and weariness.Whether she knew him as Le Moyne or as Edwardes mattered very
little, after all.The thing that really mattered was that he must try
to save Wilson for her.If he failed--It ran through his mind that if he
failed she might hate him the rest of her life--not for himself, but for
his failure; that, whichever way things went, he must lose.Edwardes says you are to stay away from the operation, but to
remain near.He--he promises to call you if--things go wrong."She sat in the
anaesthetizing-room, and after a time she knew that she was not alone.She realized dully that Carlotta was there,
too, pacing up and down the little room.She was never sure, for
instance, whether she imagined it, or whether Carlotta really stopped
before her and surveyed her with burning eyes."So you thought he was going to marry you!"Sidney tried to answer, and failed--or that was the way the dream went."If you had enough character, I'd think you did it.How do I know you
didn't follow us, and shoot him as he left the room?"It must have been reality, after all; for Sidney's numbed mind grasped
the essential fact here, and held on to it.He had promised--sworn that this should not happen.It seemed as if nothing more could hurt her.In the movement to and from the operating room, the door stood open for
a moment.A tall figure--how much it looked like K.!--straightened and
held out something in its hand.Then more waiting, a stir of movement in the room beyond the closed
door.Carlotta was standing, her face buried in her hands, against the
door.It
must be tragic to care like that!She herself was not caring much; she
was too numb.Beyond, across the courtyard, was the stable.Before the day of the
motor ambulances, horses had waited there for their summons, eager as
fire horses, heads lifted to the gong.When Sidney saw the outline of
the stable roof, she knew that it was dawn.The city still slept, but
the torturing night was over.And in the gray dawn the staff, looking
gray too, and elderly and weary, came out through the closed door and
took their hushed way toward the elevator.Sidney, straining her ears, gathered that they had seen a
miracle, and that the wonder was still on them.Almost on their heels came K. He was in the white coat, and more and
more he looked like the man who had raised up from his work and held out
something in his hand.Sidney's head was aching and confused.She sat there in her chair, looking small and childish.The dawn was
morning now--horizontal rays of sunlight on the stable roof and across
the windowsill of the anaesthetizing-room, where a row of bottles sat on
a clean towel.The tall man--or was it K.?--looked at her, and then reached up and
turned off the electric light.Why, it was K., of course; and he was
putting out the hall light before he went upstairs.When the light was
out everything was gray.She slid very quietly out of
her chair, and lay at his feet in a dead faint.He held her as he had held her that day
at the park when she fell in the river, very carefully, tenderly, as one
holds something infinitely precious.Not until he had placed her on her
bed did she open her eyes.She was
so tired, and to be carried like that, in strong arms, not knowing where
one was going, or caring--

The nurse he had summoned hustled out for aromatic ammonia.Sidney,
lying among her pillows, looked up at K.All the time I was sitting waiting, I kept
thinking that it was you who were operating!The nurse was a long time getting the ammonia.There was so much to talk
about: that Dr.Max had been out with Carlotta Harrison, and had been
shot by a jealous woman; the inexplicable return to life of the great
Edwardes; and--a fact the nurse herself was willing to vouch for, and
that thrilled the training-school to the core--that this very Edwardes,
newly risen, as it were, and being a miracle himself as well as
performing one, this very Edwardes, carrying Sidney to her bed and
putting her down, had kissed her on her white forehead.And,
after all, the nurse had only seen it in the mirror, being occupied
at the time in seeing if her cap was straight.The school, therefore,
accepted the miracle, but refused the kiss.But something had happened to K.
that savored of the marvelous.His faith in himself was coming back--not
strongly, with a rush, but with all humility.He had been loath to
take up the burden; but, now that he had it, he breathed a sort of
inarticulate prayer to be able to carry it.And, since men have looked for signs since the beginning of time, he too
asked for a sign.Not, of course, that he put it that way, or that he
was making terms with Providence.It was like this: if Wilson got well,
he'd keep on working.He'd feel that, perhaps, after all, this was
meant.If Wilson died--Sidney held out her hand to him."What should I do without you, K.?""All you have to do is to want me."His voice was not too steady, and he took her pulse in a most
businesslike way to distract her attention from it.You are quite professional about
pulses."He was not sure, to be frank, that she'd
be interested.Now, with Wilson as he was, was no time to obtrude his
own story."Will you drink some beef tea if I send it to you?""Sleep, while he--"

"I promise to tell you if there is any change.But, as he rose from the chair beside her low bed, she put out her hand
to him.And, when he hesitated: "I bring all my troubles
to you, as if you had none.Somehow, I can't go to Aunt Harriet, and of
course mother--Carlotta cares a great deal for him.He had so many friends, and no enemies that I knew
of."Her mind seemed to stagger about in a circle, making little excursions,
but always coming back to the one thing."Some drunken visitor to the road-house."He could have killed himself for the words the moment they were spoken."It is not just to judge anyone before you hear the story.""I must get up and go on duty."When the nurse
came in with the belated ammonia, she found K. making an arbitrary
ruling, and Sidney looking up at him mutinously."Miss Page is not to go on duty to-day.She is to stay in bed until
further orders."The confusion in Sidney's mind cleared away suddenly.It was K. who had performed the miracle operation--K. who
had dared and perhaps won!Dear K., with his steady eyes and his long
surgeon's fingers!Then, because she seemed to see ahead as well as
back into the past in that flash that comes to the drowning and to those
recovering from shock, and because she knew that now the little house
would no longer be home to K., she turned her face into her pillow and
cried.Her lover was not true and might
be dying; her friend would go away to his own world, which was not the
Street.K. left her at last and went back to Seventeen, where Dr.If Max would only open
his eyes, so he could tell him what had been in his mind all these
years--his pride in him and all that.With a sort of belated desire to make up for where he had failed, he put
the bag that had been Max's bete noir on the bedside table, and began
to clear it of rubbish--odd bits of dirty cotton, the tubing from a long
defunct stethoscope, glass from a broken bottle, a scrap of paper on
which was a memorandum, in his illegible writing, to send Max a check
for his graduating suit.When K. came in, he had the old dog-collar in
his hand."Belonged to an old collie of ours," he said heavily."Milkman ran over
him and killed him.Max chased the wagon and licked the driver with his
own whip."Got him in
a grape-basket."CHAPTER XXVI


Max had rallied well, and things looked bright for him.His patient did
not need him, but K. was anxious to find Joe; so he telephoned the
gas office and got a day off.The sordid little tragedy was easy to
reconstruct, except that, like Joe, K. did not believe in the innocence
of the excursion to Schwitter's.His spirit was heavy with the
conviction that he had saved Wilson to make Sidney ultimately wretched.And it is doubtful if the Street would
have been greatly concerned even had it known.It had never heard of
Edwardes, of the Edwardes clinic or the Edwardes operation.Its medical
knowledge comprised the two Wilsons and the osteopath around the corner.When, as would happen soon, it learned of Max Wilson's injury, it would
be more concerned with his chances of recovery than with the manner of
it.But Joe's affair with Sidney had been the talk of the neighborhood.If
the boy disappeared, a scandal would be inevitable.Twenty people had
seen him at Schwitter's and would know him again.At first it seemed as if the boy had frustrated him.Christine, waylaying K. in the little hall, told him
that.She
says Joe has not been home all night.She says he looks up to you, and
she thought if you could find him and would talk to him--"

"Joe was with me last night.Drummond he was in good spirits, and that she's not to worry.I feel sure she will hear from him to-day.Something went wrong with his
car, perhaps, after he left me."Katie brought his coffee to his room,
and he drank it standing.He was working out a theory about the boy.Beyond Schwitter's the highroad stretched, broad and inviting, across
the State.Either he would have gone that way, his little car eating up
the miles all that night, or--K. would not formulate his fear of what
might have happened, even to himself.As he went down the Street, he saw Mrs.McKee in her doorway, with a
little knot of people around her.The Street was getting the night's
news.He rented a car at a local garage, and drove himself out into the
country.He was not minded to have any eyes on him that day.Bill was
scrubbing the porch, and a farmhand was gathering bottles from the grass
into a box.The dead lanterns swung in the morning air, and from back on
the hill came the staccato sounds of a reaping-machine.He recognized K., and, mopping dry a part of the porch,
shoved a chair on it.Well, how's the man who got his last night?"County detectives were here bright and early.That's what this house
is--money.""Bill, did you see the man who fired that shot last night?"A sort of haze came over Bill's face, as if he had dropped a curtain
before his eyes.But his reply came promptly:

"Surest thing in the world.Dark man,
about thirty, small mustache--"

"Bill, you're lying, and I know it.The barkeeper kept his head, but his color changed.He thrust his mop into the pail.He's been out at the barn all night."The farmhand had filled his box and disappeared around the corner of the
house.K. put his hand on Bill's shirt-sleeved arm."We've got to get him away from here, Bill."The county men may come back to search the premises.""How do I know you aren't one of them?"As a matter of fact,
I followed him here; but I was too late.Did he take the revolver away
with him?"After all, it was a good world:
Tillie with her baby in her arms; Wilson conscious and rallying; Joe
safe, and, without the revolver, secure from his own remorse.Other
things there were, too--the feel of Sidney's inert body in his arms, the
way she had turned to him in trouble.It was not what he wanted, this
last, but it was worth while.The reaping-machine was in sight now; it
had stopped on the hillside.The men were drinking out of a bucket that
flashed in the sun.What had come over Wilson, to do so reckless
a thing?K., who was a one-woman man, could not explain it.From inside the bar Bill took a careful survey of Le Moyne.He noted his
tall figure and shabby suit, the slight stoop, the hair graying over his
ears.Barkeepers know men: that's a part of the job.After his survey he
went behind the bar and got the revolver from under an overturned pail."Now," he said quietly, "where is he?""In my room--top of the house."He remembered the day when he had sat
waiting in the parlor, and had heard Tillie's slow step coming down.And last night he himself had carried down Wilson's unconscious figure.Surely the wages of sin were wretchedness and misery.From nails in the rafters hung Bill's holiday wardrobe.A tin cup and a
cracked pitcher of spring water stood on the window-sill.Joe was sitting in the corner farthest from the window.When the door
swung open, he looked up.He showed no interest on seeing K., who had to
stoop to enter the low room.You're damned glad you didn't, and so am I.""But never mind about that, Joe;
I'll get some."Loud calls from below took Bill out of the room.As he closed the door
behind him, K.'s voice took on a new tone: "Joe, why did you do it?""You saw him with somebody at the White Springs, and followed them?"I did it, and I'll stand by
it.""Has it occurred to you that you made a mistake?""Go and tell that to somebody who'll believe you!""They
came here and took a room.I'd do it again
if I had a chance, and do it better."I got here not two minutes after you left.Sidney was not out of the hospital
last night.She attended a lecture, and then an operation."It was undoubtedly a relief to him to know that it had not
been Sidney; but if K. expected any remorse, he did not get it."If he is that sort, he deserves what he got," said the boy grimly.The hours he had spent
alone in the little room had been very bitter, and preceded by a time
that he shuddered to remember.K. got it by degrees--his descent of the
staircase, leaving Wilson lying on the landing above; his resolve to
walk back and surrender himself at Schwitter's, so that there could be
no mistake as to who had committed the crime."I intended to write a confession and then shoot myself," he told K."But the barkeeper got my gun out of my pocket.And--"

After a pause: "Does she know who did it?""Then, if he gets better, she'll marry him anyhow."The thing we've got to do is to
hush the thing up, and get you away.""I'd go to Cuba, but I haven't the money.""Sidney need never know who did it."There are times when some cataclysm tears down the walls of reserve
between men.That time had come for Joe, and to a lesser extent for K.
The boy rose and followed him to the door."Why don't you tell her the whole thing?--the whole filthy story?"Schwitter had taken in five hundred dollars the previous day."Five hundred gross," the little man hastened to explain.It's going hard
with her, just now, that she hasn't any women friends about.It's in the
safe, in cash; I haven't had time to take it to the bank."He seemed
to apologize to himself for the unbusinesslike proceeding of lending
an entire day's gross receipts on no security."It's better to get him
away, of course.I have tried to have an orderly
place.If they arrest him here--"

His voice trailed off.He had come a far way from the day he had walked
down the Street, and eyed Its poplars with appraising eyes--a far way.Now he had a son, and the child's mother looked at him with tragic eyes.It was arranged that K. should go back to town, returning late that
night to pick up Joe at a lonely point on the road, and to drive him to
a railroad station.But, as it happened, he went back that afternoon.He had told Schwitter he would be at the hospital, and the message found
him there.Wilson was holding his own, conscious now and making a hard
fight.The message from Schwitter was very brief:--

"Something has happened, and Tillie wants you.I don't like to trouble
you again, but she--wants you."K. was rather gray of face by that time, having had no sleep and little
food since the day before.But he got into the rented machine again--its
rental was running up; he tried to forget it--and turned it toward
Hillfoot.But first of all he drove back to the Street, and walked
without ringing into Mrs.McKee's approaching change of state had
altered the "mealing" house.The ticket-punch still lay on the hat-rack
in the hall.Through the rusty screen of the back parlor window one
viewed the spiraea, still in need of spraying.McKee herself was in
the pantry, placing one slice of tomato and three small lettuce leaves
on each of an interminable succession of plates."I've got a car at the door," he announced, "and there's nothing so
extravagant as an empty seat in an automobile.Being of the class who believe a boudoir cap the
ideal headdress for a motor-car, she apologized for having none."If I'd known you were coming I would have borrowed a cap," she said."Miss Tripp, third floor front, has a nice one.If you'll take me in my
toque--"

K. said he'd take her in her toque, and waited with some anxiety,
having not the faintest idea what a toque was.He was not without other
anxieties.What if the sight of Tillie's baby did not do all that he
expected?And Schwitter had been very
vague.But here K. was more sure of himself: the little man's voice had
expressed as exactly as words the sense of a bereavement that was not a
grief.McKee's old fondness for the girl to bring them
together.But, as they neared the house with its lanterns and tables,
its whitewashed stones outlining the drive, its small upper window
behind which Joe was waiting for night, his heart failed him, rather.He
had a masculine dislike for meddling, and yet--Mrs.McKee had suddenly
seen the name in the wooden arch over the gate: "Schwitter's.""I'm not going in there, Mr."Tillie's not in the house."She didn't approve of all that went on there, so she moved out.It's
very comfortable and clean; it smells of hay.You'd be surprised how
nice it is.""She's late with her conscience,
I'm thinking.""Last night," K. remarked, hands on the wheel, but car stopped, "she
had a child there.It--it's rather like very old times, isn't it?McKee, not in a manger, of course."McKee's tone, which had been fierce at
the beginning, ended feebly."I want you to go in and visit her, as you would any woman who'd had a
new baby and needed a friend.Tell her you've been wanting to see her.""Lie a little, for your soul's sake."She wavered, and while she wavered he drove her in under the arch with
the shameful name, and back to the barn.But there he had the tact to
remain in the car, and Mrs.McKee's peace with Tillie was made alone.When, five minutes later, she beckoned him from the door of the barn,
her eyes were red.They're going
to be married right away."The clergyman was coming along the path with Schwitter at his heels.At the door to Tillie's room he uncovered his head.Lorenz had saved Palmer Howe's
credit.On the strength of the deposit, he borrowed a thousand at the
bank with which he meant to pay his bills, arrears at the University and
Country Clubs, a hundred dollars lost throwing aces with poker dice, and
various small obligations of Christine's.He drank nothing for a week,
went into the details of the new venture with Christine's father, sat at
home with Christine on her balcony in the evenings.With the knowledge
that he could pay his debts, he postponed the day.He liked the feeling
of a bank account in four figures.The first evening or two Christine's pleasure in having him there
gratified him.He felt kind, magnanimous, almost virtuous.On the third
evening he was restless.It occurred to him that his wife was beginning
to take his presence as a matter of course.When he found that the ice was out and the beer warm and flat, he was
furious.Christine had been making a fight, although her heart was only half
in it.She was resolutely good-humored, ignored the past, dressed for
Palmer in the things he liked.They still took their dinners at the
Lorenz house up the street.When she saw that the haphazard table
service there irritated him, she coaxed her mother into getting a
butler.The Street sniffed at the butler behind his stately back.Secretly and
in its heart, it was proud of him.With a half-dozen automobiles, and
Christine Howe putting on low neck in the evenings, and now a butler,
not to mention Harriet Kennedy's Mimi, it ceased to pride itself on
its commonplaceness, ignorant of the fact that in its very lack of
affectation had lain its charm.On the night that Joe shot Max Wilson, Palmer was noticeably restless.He had seen Grace Irving that day for the first time but once since
the motor accident.To do him justice, his dissipation of the past few
months had not included women.Perhaps she typified the
care-free days before his marriage; perhaps the attraction was deeper,
fundamental.He met her in the street the day before Max Wilson was
shot.The sight of her walking sedately along in her shop-girl's black
dress had been enough to set his pulses racing.When he saw that she
meant to pass him, he fell into step beside her."I believe you were going to cut me!"And, after a second's hesitation: "I'm keeping straight, too.""Do you have to walk as fast as this?"Once a week I get off a little early.I--"

He eyed her suspiciously.The Rosenfeld boy is still there, you know."But a moment later he burst out irritably:--

"That was an accident, Grace.The boy took the chance when he engaged
to drive the car.I dream of the little
devil sometimes, lying there.I'll tell you what I'll do," he added
magnanimously."I'll stop in and talk to Wilson.He ought to have done
something before this."I don't think you can do anything for
him, unless--"

The monstrous injustice of the thing overcame her.Palmer and she
walking about, and the boy lying on his hot bed!If you could give her some money, it would
help.""You owe him too, don't you?I don't see that I'm under any
obligation, anyhow.I paid his board for two months in the hospital."When she did not acknowledge this generosity,--amounting to forty-eight
dollars,--his irritation grew.Her manner
galled him, into the bargain.She was too calm in his presence, too
cold.Where she had once palpitated visibly under his warm gaze, she was
now self-possessed and quiet.Where it had pleased his pride to think
that he had given her up, he found that the shoe was on the other foot.At the entrance to a side street she stopped.The next day he drew the thousand dollars from the bank.A good many
of his debts he wanted to pay in cash; there was no use putting checks
through, with incriminating indorsements.Also, he liked the idea of
carrying a roll of money around.The big fellows at the clubs always had
a wad and peeled off bills like skin off an onion.He took a couple of
drinks to celebrate his approaching immunity from debt.He played auction bridge that afternoon in a private room at one of the
hotels with the three men he had lunched with.He won eighty dollars, and thrust it loose in his trousers pocket.If he could carry the thousand around for a
day or so, something pretty good might come of it.When the game was over, he
bought drinks to celebrate his victory.The losers treated, too, to show
they were no pikers.He offered to put up
the eighty and throw for it.The losers mentioned dinner and various
engagements.Christine would greet him with raised
eyebrows.They would eat a stuffy Lorenz dinner, and in the evening
Christine would sit in the lamplight and drive him mad with soft music.He wanted lights, noise, the smiles of women.Luck was with him, and he
wanted to be happy.At nine o'clock that night he found Grace.She had moved to a cheap
apartment which she shared with two other girls from the store.His drunkenness was of the mind, mostly.The lines from his nose to the corners of his mouth were
slightly accentuated, his eyes open a trifle wider than usual.That
and a slight paleness of the nostrils were the only evidences of his
condition.She retreated before him, her eyes watchful.Men in his condition were
apt to be as quick with a blow as with a caress.But, having gained his
point, he was amiable.We can take in a roof-garden.""I've told you I'm not doing that sort of thing.""You've got somebody else on the string."There--there has never been anybody else, Palmer."He caught her suddenly and jerked her toward him."You let me hear of anybody else, and I'll cut the guts out of him!"He held her for a second, his face black and fierce.Then, slowly and
inevitably, he drew her into his arms.But, in the queer loyalty of her class, he was the only man she had
cared for.She took him for that moment, felt his hot
kisses on her mouth, her throat, submitted while his rather brutal
hands bruised her arms in fierce caresses.Then she put him from her
resolutely.But he was less steady than he had been.The heat of the little flat
brought more blood to his head.He wavered as he stood just inside the
door.She's in love with a fellow at the house.""Lemme come in and sit down, won't you?"She let him pass her into the sitting-room."You've turned me down, and now Christine--she thinks I don't know.I'm
no fool; I see a lot of things.I know that I've made her
miserable.But I made a merry little hell for you too, and you don't
kick about it."Nothing else, perhaps, could have shown her so well what a broken reed
he was.You were a good girl before I knew you.I'm not going to do you any harm, I swear it.I only
wanted to take you out for a good time.He
drew out the roll of bills and showed it to her.She had never known him to have much money.A new look flashed into her eyes, not cupidity, but purpose."Aren't you going to give me some of that?"The very drunk have the intuition sometimes of savages or brute beasts.He thrust it back into his pocket, but his hand retained its grasp of
it."Don't lemme be happy for a minute!"You give me that for the Rosenfeld boy, and I'll go out with you.""If I give you all that, I won't have any money to go out with!""I'm no piker," he said largely.He held it out to her, and from another pocket produced the eighty
dollars, in crushed and wrinkled notes."It's my lucky day," he said thickly.His head dropped back on his chair; he propped his sagging legs on a
stool.She knew him--knew that he would sleep almost all night.She would have to make up something to tell the other girls; but no
matter--she could attend to that later.She had never had a thousand dollars in her hands before.She paused, in
pinning on her hat, to count the bills.CHAPTER XXVII


K. spent all of the evening of that day with Wilson.He was not to go
for Joe until eleven o'clock.The injured man's vitality was standing
him in good stead.He had asked for Sidney and she was at his bedside.The office is full, they tell me," he said, bending
over the bed."I'll come in later, and if they'll make me a shakedown,
I'll stay with you to-night.""Get some sleep...I've been a
poor stick...try to do better--" His roving eyes fell on the dog collar
on the stand.he said, and put his hand over
Dr.Ed's, as it lay on the bed.K. found Sidney in the room, not sitting, but standing by the window.One shaded light burned in a far corner.It seemed to K. that she looked at
him as if she had never really seen him before, and he was right.Sidney was trying to reconcile the K. she had known so well with this
new K., no longer obscure, although still shabby, whose height had
suddenly become presence, whose quiet was the quiet of infinite power.She was suddenly shy of him, as he stood looking down at her.He saw the
gleam of her engagement ring on her finger.As
though she had meant by wearing it to emphasize her belief in her lover.They did not speak beyond their greeting, until he had gone over the
record.Then:--

"We can't talk here.Far away was the
night nurse's desk, with its lamp, its annunciator, its pile of records.The passage floor reflected the light on glistening boards."I have been thinking until I am almost crazy, K. And now I know how it
happened."The principal thing is, not how it happened, but that he is going to
get well, Sidney."She stood looking down, twisting her ring around her finger."We are going to get him away to-night.He'll
get off safely, I think."You shoulder all our
troubles, K., as if they were your own."You mean--but my part in
getting Joe off is practically nothing.As a matter of fact, Schwitter
has put up the money.My total capital in the world, after paying the
taxicab to-day, is seven dollars."Tillie married
and has a baby--all in twenty-four hours!Squalled like a maniac when the water went on its head."She said she would have to go in her toque."You find Max and save him--don't look like
that!And you get Joe away, borrowing money to send
him.And as if that isn't enough, when you ought to have been getting
some sleep, you are out taking a friend to Tillie, and being godfather
to the baby."I--"

"When I look back and remember how all these months I've been talking
about service, and you said nothing at all, and all the time you were
living what I preached--I'm so ashamed, K."She saw that, and tried to
smile.I'm to take him across the country to the railroad.I was
wondering--"

"Yes?""I'd better explain first what happened, and why it happened.Then if
you are willing to send him a line, I think it would help.He saw a girl
in white in the car and followed in his own machine.He thought it was
you, of course.He didn't like the idea of your going to Schwitter's.And Schwitter and--and Wilson took her upstairs
to a room."I feel very guilty, K., as if it all comes back to
me.He watched her go down the hall toward the night nurse's desk.He would
have given everything just then for the right to call her back, to take
her in his arms and comfort her.He himself had
gone through loneliness and heartache, and the shadow was still on him.He waited until he saw her sit down at the desk and take up a pen.Then
he went back into the quiet room.He stood by the bedside, looking down.Wilson was breathing quietly: his
color was coming up, as he rallied from the shock.'s mind now was
just one thought--to bring him through for Sidney, and then to go away.He could do
sanitation work, or he might try the Canal.The Street would go on working out its own salvation.He would have
to think of something for the Rosenfelds.But there again, perhaps it would be better if he went away.Christine's story would have to work itself out.He was glad in a way that Sidney had asked no questions about him, had
accepted his new identity so calmly.It had been overshadowed by the
night tragedy.It would have pleased him if she had shown more interest,
of course.It was enough, he told himself, that he
had helped her, that she counted on him.But more and more he knew in
his heart that it was not enough."I'd better get away from here," he
told himself savagely.And having taken the first step toward flight, as happens in such cases,
he was suddenly panicky with fear, fear that he would get out of hand,
and take her in his arms, whether or no; a temptation to run from
temptation, to cut everything and go with Joe that night.But there
his sense of humor saved him.That would be a sight for the gods, two
defeated lovers flying together under the soft September moon.He thought it was Sidney and turned with the
light in his eyes that was only for her.She wore a dark skirt and white waist and her
high heels tapped as she crossed the room.Of course it will be a day or two before we are quite
sure."She stood looking down at Wilson's quiet figure."I guess you know I've been crazy about him," she said quietly.I played his game and
I--lost.Quite suddenly she dropped on her knees beside the bed, and put her
cheek close to the sleeping man's hand.When after a moment she rose,
she was controlled again, calm, very white.Edwardes, when he is conscious, that I came in
and said good-bye?"She hesitated, as if the thought tempted her.But K. could not let her go like that.I'm about through with my training, but I've lost my
diploma.""I don't like to see you going away like this."She avoided his eyes, but his kindly tone did what neither the Head nor
the Executive Committee had done that day.One way and another I've known you a long time.""I'll tell you where I live, and--"

"I know where you live."I've tried twice for a diploma and failed.But in the end he prevailed on her to promise not to leave the city
until she had seen him again.It was not until she had gone, a straight
figure with haunted eyes, that he reflected whimsically that once again
he had defeated his own plans for flight.In the corridor outside the door Carlotta hesitated.He was kind; he was going to do something for her.But the old instinct of self-preservation prevailed.Sidney brought her letter to Joe back to K. She was flushed with the
effort and with a new excitement."This is the letter, K., and--I haven't been able to say what I wanted,
exactly.You'll let him know, won't you, how I feel, and how I blame
myself?"Somebody has sent Johnny Rosenfeld a lot of money.The ward nurse wants
you to come back."The well-ordered beds of the daytime
were chaotic now, torn apart by tossing figures.The night was hot and
an electric fan hummed in a far corner.Under its sporadic breezes, as
it turned, the ward was trying to sleep.He was sure it was there, for ever
since it came his hot hand had clutched it.He was quite sure that somehow or other K. had had a hand in it.When he
disclaimed it, the boy was bewildered."It'll buy the old lady what she wants for the house, anyhow," he
said."But I hope nobody's took up a collection for me."You can bet your last match he didn't."In some unknown way the news had reached the ward that Johnny's friend,
Mr."He works in the gas office," he said, "I've seen him there.If he's a
surgeon, what's he doing in the gas office.If he's a surgeon, what's he
doing teaching me raffia-work?After
all, he was a man, or almost.Didn't he have a
state license?"They've got a queer story about you here in the ward.""They say that you're a surgeon; that you operated on Dr.They say that you're the king pin where you came from.""I know it's a damn lie, but if it's true--"

"I used to be a surgeon.As a matter of fact I operated on Dr.I--I am rather apologetic, Jack, because I didn't explain to
you sooner.For--various reasons--I gave up that--that line of business."Don't you think you could do something for me, sir?"When K. did not reply at once, he launched into an explanation."I've been lying here a good while.I didn't say much because I knew I'd
have to take a chance.Either I'd pull through or I wouldn't, and the
odds were--well, I didn't say much.The old lady's had a lot of trouble.But now, with THIS under my pillow for her, I've got a right to ask.I'll take a chance, if you will."But lie here and watch these soaks off the street.Old, a
lot of them, and gettin' well to go out and starve, and--My God!Le
Moyne, they can walk, and I can't."He had started, and now he must go on.Faith in
himself or no faith, he must go on.Life, that had loosed its hold on
him for a time, had found him again."I'll go over you carefully to-morrow, Jack.I'll tell you your chances
honestly."Whatever you charge--"

"I'll take it out of my board bill in the new house!"At four o'clock that morning K. got back from seeing Joe off.Over Sidney's letter Joe had shed a shamefaced tear or two.And during
the night ride, with K. pushing the car to the utmost, he had felt that
the boy, in keeping his hand in his pocket, had kept it on the letter.When the road was smooth and stretched ahead, a gray-white line into the
night, he tried to talk a little courage into the boy's sick heart."You'll see new people, new life," he said."In a month from now you'll
wonder why you ever hung around the Street.I have a feeling that you're
going to make good down there."And once, when the time for parting was very near,--"No matter what
happens, keep on believing in yourself.Joe's response showed his entire self-engrossment."If he dies, I'm a murderer.""He's not going to die," said K. stoutly.At four o'clock in the morning he left the car at the garage and walked
around to the little house.He had had no sleep for forty-five hours;
his eyes were sunken in his head; the skin over his temples looked drawn
and white.His clothes were wrinkled; the soft hat he habitually wore
was white with the dust of the road.As he opened the hall door, Christine stirred in the room beyond.Why in the world aren't you in bed?""Palmer has just come home in a terrible rage.He says he's been robbed
of a thousand dollars.""He doesn't know, or says he doesn't.In the dim hall light he realized that her face was strained and set.The tender words broke down the last barrier of her self-control.She held her arms out to him, and because he was very tired and lonely,
and because more than anything else in the world just then he needed a
woman's arms, he drew her to him and held her close, his cheek to her
hair.Surely there must be some
happiness for us somewhere."But the next moment he let her go and stepped back."I shouldn't have
done that--You know how it is with me.""I'm afraid it will always be Sidney."CHAPTER XXVIII


Johnny Rosenfeld was dead.'s skill had not sufficed to save
him.The operation had been a marvel, but the boy's long-sapped strength
failed at the last.K., set of face, stayed with him to the end.The boy did not know he was
going.He roused from the coma and smiled up at Le Moyne."I've got a hunch that I can move my right foot," he said."Brake foot, clutch foot," said Johnny, and closed his eyes again.K. had forbidden the white screens, that outward symbol of death.So the ward had no suspicion, nor had the boy.It was Sunday, and from the chapel far below
came the faint singing of a hymn.When Johnny spoke again he did not
open his eyes.I'll put in a word for you whenever
I get a chance.""Yes, put in a word for me," said K. huskily.He felt that Johnny would be a good mediator--that whatever he, K., had
done of omission or commission, Johnny's voice before the Tribunal would
count.The lame young violin-player came into the ward.She had cherished a
secret and romantic affection for Max Wilson, and now he was in the
hospital and ill.So she wore the sacrificial air of a young nun and
played "The Holy City."Johnny was close on the edge of his long sleep by that time, and very
comfortable."Tell her nix on the sob stuff," he complained."Ask her to play 'I'm
twenty-one and she's eighteen.'"'s quick explanation she changed to
the staccato air."Ask her if she'll come a little nearer; I can't hear her."So she moved to the foot of the bed, and to the gay little tune Johnny
began his long sleep.But first he asked K. a question: "Are you sure
I'm going to walk, Mr."I give you my solemn word," said K. huskily, "that you are going to be
better than you have ever been in your life."It was K. who, seeing he would no longer notice, ordered the screens to
be set around the bed, K. who drew the coverings smooth and folded the
boy's hands over his breast."It was the result of a man's damnable folly," said K. grimly.The immediate result of his death was that K., who had gained some of
his faith in himself on seeing Wilson on the way to recovery, was beset
by his old doubts.What right had he to arrogate to himself again powers
of life and death?Over and over he told himself that there had been no
carelessness here, that the boy would have died ultimately, that he
had taken the only chance, that the boy himself had known the risk and
begged for it.And now came a question that demanded immediate answer.Wilson would
be out of commission for several months, probably.And he wanted K. to take over his work.You're not thinking about going back to that
ridiculous gas office, are you?""I had some thought of going to Cuba."You've done a marvelous thing; I lie
here and listen to the staff singing your praises until I'm sick of your
name!And now, because a boy who wouldn't have lived anyhow--"

"That's not it," K. put in hastily.I guess I could do
it and get away with it as well as the average.All that deters me--I've
never told you, have I, why I gave up before?"K. was walking restlessly about the
room, as was his habit when troubled."I've heard the gossip; that's all.""When you recognized me that night on the balcony, I told you I'd lost
my faith in myself, and you said the whole affair had been gone over
at the State Society.As a matter of fact, the Society knew of only two
cases."Even at that--"

"You know what I always felt about the profession, Max.We went into
that more than once in Berlin.When I left Lorch and built my own hospital, I hadn't
a doubt of myself.And because I was getting results I got a lot of
advertising.I found I was making
enough out of the patients who could pay to add a few free wards.I want
to tell you now, Wilson, that the opening of those free wards was the
greatest self-indulgence I ever permitted myself.I'd seen so much
careless attention given the poor--well, never mind that.It was almost
three years ago that things began to go wrong.All this doesn't influence me, Edwardes."We had a system in the operating-room as perfect as I
could devise it.I never finished an operation without having my first
assistant verify the clip and sponge count.But that first case died
because a sponge had been left in the operating field.You know how
those things go; you can't always see them, and one goes by the count,
after reasonable caution.Then I lost another case in the same way--a
free case."As well as I could tell, the precautions had not been relaxed.I was
doing from four to six cases a day.After the second one I almost went
crazy.I made up my mind, if there was ever another, I'd give up and go
away."When the last case died, a free case again, I
performed my own autopsy.I allowed only my first assistant in the room.He was almost as frenzied as I was.When I
told him I was going away, he offered to take the blame himself, to
say he had closed the incision.He tried to make me think he was
responsible.I've sent them money from time to time.I used to sit and think
about the children he left, and what would become of them.The ironic
part of it was that, for all that had happened, I was busier all the
time.Men were sending me cases from all over the country.It was either
stay and keep on working, with that chance, or--quit."But if
you had stayed, and taken extra precautions--"

"We'd taken every precaution we knew."K. stood, his tall figure outlined
against the window.Far off, in the children's ward, children were
laughing; from near by a very young baby wailed a thin cry of protest
against life; a bell rang constantly.'s mind was busy with the
past--with the day he decided to give up and go away, with the months of
wandering and homelessness, with the night he had come upon the Street
and had seen Sidney on the doorstep of the little house.You had an enemy somewhere--on your
staff, probably.This profession of ours is a big one, but you know its
jealousies.Let a man get his shoulders above the crowd, and the pack
is after him.""Mixed figure, but you know what I
mean."He had had that gift of the big man everywhere, in
every profession, of securing the loyalty of his followers.He would
have trusted every one of them with his life."You're going to do it, of course."To stay on, to be near Sidney, perhaps to stand
by as Wilson's best man when he was married--it turned him cold.But he
did not give a decided negative.The sick man was flushed and growing
fretful; it would not do to irritate him."Give me another day on it," he said at last.Max's injury had been productive of good, in one way.It had brought the
two brothers closer together.In the mornings Max was restless until
Dr.When he came, he brought books in the shabby bag--his
beloved Burns, although he needed no book for that, the "Pickwick
Papers," Renan's "Lives of the Disciples."Very often Max world doze
off; at the cessation of Dr.Ed's sonorous voice the sick man would stir
fretfully and demand more.But because he listened to everything without
discrimination, the older man came to the conclusion that it was the
companionship that counted.It reminded him of
Max's boyhood, when he had read to Max at night.For once in the last
dozen years, he needed him.What in blazes makes you stop every five minutes?"Ed, who had only stopped to bite off the end of a stogie to hold in
his cheek, picked up his book in a hurry, and eyed the invalid over it.Have you any idea what I'm
reading?"For ten minutes I've been reading across both pages!"Max laughed, and suddenly put out his hand.Demonstrations of affection
were so rare with him that for a moment Dr.Then, rather
sheepishly, he took it."When I get out," Max said, "we'll have to go out to the White Springs
again and have supper."Morning and evening, Sidney went to Max's room.In the morning she only
smiled at him from the doorway.In the evening she went to him after
prayers.The shooting had been a closed book between them.At first, when he
began to recover, he tried to talk to her about it.She was very gentle with him, but very firm."I know how it happened, Max," she said--"about Joe's mistake and all
that.The rest can wait until you are much better."If there had been any change in her manner to him, he would not
have submitted so easily, probably.But she was as tender as ever,
unfailingly patient, prompt to come to him and slow to leave.After a
time he began to dread reopening the subject.She seemed so effectually
to have closed it.And, after all, what good could he
do his cause by pleading it?The fact was there, and Sidney knew it.On the day when K. had told Max his reason for giving up his work, Max
was allowed out of bed for the first time.A box of
red roses came that day from the girl who had refused him a year or more
ago.He viewed them with a carelessness that was half assumed.The news had traveled to the Street that he was to get up that day.Early that morning the doorkeeper had opened the door to a gentleman
who did not speak, but who handed in a bunch of early chrysanthemums and
proceeded to write, on a pad he drew from his pocket:--

"From Mrs.McKee's family and guests, with their congratulations on your
recovery, and their hope that they will see you again soon.If their
ends are clipped every day and they are placed in ammonia water, they
will last indefinitely."Sidney spent her hour with Max that evening as
usual.His big chair had been drawn close to a window, and she found him
there, looking out.But this time, instead of letting
her draw away, he put out his arms and caught her to him."Very glad, indeed," she said soberly.You ought to smile; your
mouth--"

"I am almost always tired; that's all, Max.""Aren't you going to let me make love to you at all?"I was looking for the paper to read to you.""You don't like me to touch you any more.The fear of agitating him brought her quickly.For a moment he was
appeased.He lifted first one
hand and then the other to his lips."If you mean about Carlotta, I forgave that long ago."Many a woman would have held that over him for years--not that
he had done anything really wrong on that nightmare excursion.But so
many women are exigent about promises."We needn't discuss that to-night, Max."Let me tell Ed
that you will marry me soon.Then, when I go away, I'll take you with
me.""Can't we talk things over when you are stronger?"Her tone caught his attention, and turned him a little white.He faced
her to the window, so that the light fell full on her.She had meant to wait; but, with his keen eyes
on her, she could not dissemble."I am going to make you very unhappy for a little while.""I've had a lot of time to think.If you had really wanted me, Max--"

"My God, of course I want you!"I think you care for me--"

"I love you!I swear I never loved any other woman as I love you."Suddenly he remembered that he had also sworn to put Carlotta out of his
life.He knew that Sidney remembered, too; but she gave no sign.But there would always be other women, Max."If you loved me you could do anything with me."By the way her color leaped, he knew he had struck fire.All
his conjectures as to how Sidney would take the knowledge of his
entanglement with Carlotta had been founded on one major premise--that
she loved him."But, good Heavens, Sidney, you do care for me, don't you?""I'm afraid I don't, Max; not enough."After one look at his face, she
spoke to the window.To me you were the best
and greatest man that ever lived.I--when I said my prayers, I--But that
doesn't matter.When the Lamb--that's one
of the internes, you know--nicknamed you the 'Little Tin God,' I was
angry.You could never be anything little to me, or do anything that
wasn't big."No man could live up to that, Sidney."Now I know that I
didn't care for you, really, at all.I built up an idol and worshiped
it.I always saw you through a sort of haze.You were operating, with
everybody standing by, saying how wonderful it was.Or you were coming
to the wards, and everything was excitement, getting ready for you.It isn't that I think you
are wicked.It's just that I never loved the real you, because I never
knew you."When he remained silent, she made an attempt to justify herself."I'd known very few men," she said."I came into the hospital, and for
a time life seemed very terrible.There were wickednesses I had never
heard of, and somebody always paying for them.Then you would come in, and a lot of them you cured and sent out.You gave them their chance, don't you see?Until I knew about Carlotta,
you always meant that to me.In the nurses' parlor, a few feet down the
corridor, the nurses were at prayers."The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want," read the Head, her voice
calm with the quiet of twilight and the end of the day."He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the
still waters."The nurses read the response a little slowly, as if they, too, were
weary."Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death--"

The man in the chair stirred.He had come through the valley of the
shadow, and for what?He said to himself savagely
that they would better have let him die."You say you never loved me
because you never knew me.Isn't it possible
that the man you, cared about, who--who did his best by people and all
that--is the real me?"He missed something out of her eyes, the
sort of luminous, wistful look with which she had been wont to survey
his greatness.Measured by this new glance, so clear, so appraising, he
sank back into his chair."The man who did his best is quite real.You have always done the best
in your work; you always will.But the other is a part of you too, Max.Even if I cared, I would not dare to run the risk."Under the window rang the sharp gong of a city patrol-wagon.It rumbled
through the gates back to the courtyard, where its continued clamor
summoned white-coated orderlies.Sidney, chin lifted, listened
carefully.If it was a case for her, the elevator would go up to the
operating-room.With a renewed sense of loss, Max saw that already she
had put him out of her mind.The call to service was to her a call to
battle.Her sensitive nostrils quivered; her young figure stood erect,
alert.She took a step toward the door, hesitated, came back, and put a light
hand on his shoulder.She had kissed him lightly on the cheek before he knew what she intended
to do.So passionless was the little caress that, perhaps more than
anything else, it typified the change in their relation.When the door closed behind her, he saw that she had left her ring
on the arm of his chair.He held it to his lips with a quick gesture.In all his
successful young life he had never before felt the bitterness of
failure.He didn't want to live--he wouldn't live.He would--

His eyes, lifted from the ring, fell on the red glow of the roses that
had come that morning.Even in the half light, they glowed with fiery
color.With the left he settled his collar and
soft silk tie.K. saw Carlotta that evening for the last time.Katie brought word to
him, where he was helping Harriet close her trunk,--she was on her way
to Europe for the fall styles,--that he was wanted in the lower hall.she said, closing the door behind her by way of caution."And
a good thing for her she's not from the alley.The way those people beg
off you is a sin and a shame, and it's not at home you're going to be to
them from now on."So K. had put on his coat and, without so much as a glance in Harriet's
mirror, had gone down the stairs.She
stood under the chandelier, and he saw at once the ravages that trouble
had made in her.She was a dead white, and she looked ten years older
than her age.Now and then, when some one came to him for help, which was generally
money, he used Christine's parlor, if she happened to be out.So now,
finding the door ajar, and the room dark, he went in and turned on the
light."Come in here; we can talk better."She did not sit down at first; but, observing that her standing kept him
on his feet, she sat finally."You were to come," K. encouraged her, "to see if we couldn't plan
something for you."If it's another hospital--and I don't want to stay here, in the city.""You like surgical work, don't you?""Before we settle this, I'd better tell you what I'm thinking of.You know, of course, that I closed my hospital.I--a series of things
happened, and I decided I was in the wrong business.That wouldn't be
important, except for what it leads to.They are trying to persuade me
to go back, and--I'm trying to persuade myself that I'm fit to go back.You see,"--his tone was determinedly cheerful, "my faith in myself has
been pretty nearly gone.When one loses that, there isn't much left.""Well, I had and I hadn't.I'm not going to worry you about that.My
offer is this: We'll just try to forget about--about Schwitter's and all
the rest, and if I go back I'll take you on in the operating-room.""Well, I can ask you to come back, can't I?"He smiled at her
encouragingly."Are you sure you understand about Max Wilson and myself?""Don't you think you are taking a risk?""Every one makes mistakes now and then, and loving women have made
mistakes since the world began.Most people live in glass houses, Miss
Harrison.And don't make any mistake about this: people can always come
back.But the offer
he made was too alluring.It meant reinstatement, another chance, when
she had thought everything was over.After all, why should she damn
herself?She would work her finger-ends off for him.She would make it up to him in other ways.But she could not tell him
and lose everything."Shall we go back and start over again?"CHAPTER XXIX


Late September had come, with the Street, after its summer indolence
taking up the burden of the year.At eight-thirty and at one the school
bell called the children.Little girls in pig-tails, carrying freshly
sharpened pencils, went primly toward the school, gathering, comet
fashion, a tail of unwilling brothers as they went.Le Moyne had promised
the baseball club a football outfit, rumor said, but would not coach
them himself this year.Le Moyne
intended to go away.The Street had been furiously busy for a month.The cobblestones had
gone, and from curb to curb stretched smooth asphalt.The fascination
of writing on it with chalk still obsessed the children.Every few yards
was a hop-scotch diagram.Generally speaking, too, the Street had put up
new curtains, and even, here and there, had added a coat of paint.To this general excitement the strange case of Mr.One day he was in the gas office, making out statements that
were absolutely ridiculous.(What with no baking all last month, and
every Sunday spent in the country, nobody could have used that amount of
gas.They could come and take their old meter out!)And the next there
was the news that Mr.Le Moyne had been only taking a holiday in the
gas office,--paying off old scores, the barytone at Mrs.McKee's
hazarded!--and that he was really a very great surgeon and had saved Dr.The Street, which was busy at the time deciding whether to leave the old
sidewalks or to put down cement ones, had one evening of mad excitement
over the matter,--of K., not the sidewalks,--and then had accepted the
new situation.What was
the matter with things, anyhow?Here was Christine's marriage, which had
promised so well,--awnings and palms and everything,--turning out badly.True, Palmer Howe was doing better, but he would break out again.And
Johnny Rosenfeld was dead, so that his mother came on washing-days,
and brought no cheery gossip; but bent over her tubs dry-eyed and
silent--even the approaching move to a larger house failed to thrill
her.She was
married now, of course; but the Street did not tolerate such a reversal
of the usual processes as Tillie had indulged in.McKee
severely for having been, so to speak, and accessory after the fact.The Street made a resolve to keep K., if possible.If he had shown
any "high and mightiness," as they called it, since the change in his
estate, it would have let him go without protest.But when a man is the
real thing,--so that the newspapers give a column to his having been
in the city almost two years,--and still goes about in the same shabby
clothes, with the same friendly greeting for every one, it demonstrates
clearly, as the barytone put it, that "he's got no swelled head on him;
that's sure.""Anybody can see by the way he drives that machine of Wilson's that he's
been used to a car--likely a foreign one.Still the barytone, who was almost as fond of conversation as
of what he termed "vocal."Do you notice the way
he takes Dr.The old boy's
tickled to death."A little later, K., coming up the Street as he had that first day, heard
the barytone singing:--

      "Home is the hunter, home from the hill,
       And the sailor, home from sea."The Street seemed to stretch out its arms to
him.The ailanthus tree waved in the sunlight before the little house.Tree and house were old; September had touched them.Christine sat
sewing on the balcony.A boy with a piece of chalk was writing something
on the new cement under the tree.He stood back, head on one side, when
he had finished, and inspected his work.K. caught him up from behind,
and, swinging him around--

"Hey!""Don't you know better than to write all over
the street?"Aw, lemme down, Mr."You tell the boys that if I find this street scrawled over any more,
the picnic's off."Go and spend some of that chalk energy of yours in school."There was a certain tenderness in his hands, as in
his voice, when he dealt with children.'s eye fell on what he had written on the cement.At a certain part of his career, the child of such a neighborhood as the
Street "cancels" names.He does it as he
whittles his school desk or tries to smoke the long dried fruit of the
Indian cigar tree.So K. read in chalk an the smooth street:--

     Max Wilson Marriage.[Note: the a, l, s, and n of "Max Wilson" are crossed through, as are
the S, d, n, and a of "Sidney Page"]

The childish scrawl stared up at him impudently, a sacred thing profaned
by the day.The barytone was still singing;
but now it was "I'm twenty-one, and she's eighteen."It was a cheerful
air, as should be the air that had accompanied Johnny Rosenfeld to his
long sleep.After all, the
Street meant for him not so much home as it meant Sidney.And now,
before very long, that book of his life, like others, would have to be
closed.He turned and went heavily into the little house.Christine called to him from her little balcony:--

"I thought I heard your step outside.K. went through the parlor and stood in the long window.His steady eyes
looked down at her."I see very little of you now," she complained.And, when he did not
reply immediately: "Have you made any definite plans, K.?""I shall do Max's work until he is able to take hold again.After
that--"

"You will go away?"I am getting a good many letters, one way and another.I
suppose, now I'm back in harness, I'll stay.I'd
go back there--they want me.But it seems so futile, Christine, to leave
as I did, because I felt that I had no right to go on as things were;
and now to crawl back on the strength of having had my hand forced, and
to take up things again, not knowing that I've a bit more right to do it
than when I left!"He took an uneasy turn up and down the balcony.I tell you,
Christine, it isn't possible."Her thoughts had flown ahead to the
little house without K., to days without his steps on the stairs or the
heavy creak of his big chair overhead as he dropped into it.But perhaps it would be better if he went.She had no expectation of happiness, but, somehow or other, she must
build on the shaky foundation of her marriage a house of life, with
resignation serving for content, perhaps with fear lurking always.Misery implied affection, and her
love for Palmer was quite dead."Sidney will be here this afternoon.""Has it occurred to you, K., that Sidney is not very happy?""I'm not quite sure, but I think I know.She's lost faith in Max, and
she's not like me.I--I knew about Palmer before I married him.It's all rather hideous--I needn't go into it.I was afraid to
back out; it was just before my wedding.But Sidney has more character
than I have.Max isn't what she thought he was, and I doubt whether
she'll marry him."K. glanced toward the street where Sidney's name and Max's lay open to
the sun and to the smiles of the Street.Christine might be right, but
that did not alter things for him.Christine's thoughts went back inevitably to herself; to Palmer, who was
doing better just now; to K., who was going away--went back with an ache
to the night K. had taken her in his arms and then put her away."When you go away," she said at last, "I want you to remember this.I'm
going to do my best, K. You have taught me all I know.All my life I'll
have to overlook things; I know that.But, in his way, Palmer cares for
me.He will always come back, and perhaps sometime--"

Her voice trailed off.Far ahead of her she saw the years stretching
out, marked, not by days and months, but by Palmer's wanderings away,
his remorseful returns."Do a little more than forgetting," K. said."Try to care for him,
Christine.It's always a
woman's strongest weapon."I shall try, K.," she answered obediently.But he turned away from the look in her eyes.She had sent cards from Paris to her "trade."The two or three people on the Street who received her
engraved announcement that she was there, "buying new chic models
for the autumn and winter--afternoon frocks, evening gowns, reception
dresses, and wraps, from Poiret, Martial et Armand, and others," left
the envelopes casually on the parlor table, as if communications from
Paris were quite to be expected.So K. lunched alone, and ate little.After luncheon he fixed a broken
ironing-stand for Katie, and in return she pressed a pair of trousers
for him.He had it in mind to ask Sidney to go out with him in Max's
car, and his most presentable suit was very shabby."I'm thinking," said Katie, when she brought the pressed garments up
over her arm and passed them in through a discreet crack in the door,
"that these pants will stand more walking than sitting, Mr."I'll take a duster along in case of accident," he promised her; "and
to-morrow I'll order a suit, Katie.""I'll believe it when I see it," said Katie from the stairs."Some fool
of a woman from the alley will come in to-night and tell you she can't
pay her rent, and she'll take your suit away in her pocket-book--as like
as not to pay an installment on a piano.There's two new pianos in the
alley since you came here.""Show it to me," said Katie laconically."And don't go to picking up
anything you drop!"Sidney came home at half-past two--came delicately flushed, as if she
had hurried, and with a tremulous smile that caught Katie's eye at once."There's no need to ask how he is to-day."Katie, some one has written my name out on the street, in chalk."I'm about crazy with their old chalk.But when she learned that K. was upstairs, oddly enough, she did not go
up at once.Her lips parted slightly as she
listened.Christine, looking in from her balcony, saw her there, and, seeing
something in her face that she had never suspected, put her hand to her
throat."Won't you come and sit with me?""I haven't much time--that is, I want to speak to K.""You can see him when he comes down."Sidney came slowly through the parlor.It occurred to her, all at once,
that Christine must see a lot of K., especially now.No doubt he was
in and out of the house often.All that seemed to be necessary to win K.Well, surely, in that case--

"How is Max?"Sidney sat down on the edge of the railing; but she was careful,
Christine saw, to face the staircase.Christine sewed; Sidney sat and swung her feet idly.Ed says Max wants you to give up your training and marry him now.""I'm not going to marry him at all, Chris."It was one of his failings that he always
slammed doors.Harriet used to be quite disagreeable about it.Perhaps, in all her frivolous, selfish life, Christine had never had a
bigger moment than the one that followed.She could have said nothing,
and, in the queer way that life goes, K. might have gone away from the
Street as empty of heart as he had come to it."Be very good to him, Sidney," she said unsteadily.CHAPTER XXX


K. was being very dense.For so long had he considered Sidney as
unattainable that now his masculine mind, a little weary with much
wretchedness, refused to move from its old attitude."It was glamour, that was all, K.," said Sidney bravely."But, perhaps," said K., "it's just because of that miserable incident
with Carlotta.That wasn't the right thing, of course, but Max has told
me the story.She fainted in the yard,
and--"

Sidney was exasperated."Do you want me to marry him, K.?""I want you to be happy, dear."They were on the terrace of the White Springs Hotel again.K. had
ordered dinner, making a great to-do about getting the dishes they both
liked.But now that it was there, they were not eating.K. had placed
his chair so that his profile was turned toward her.He had worn the
duster religiously until nightfall, and then had discarded it.It hung
limp and dejected on the back of his chair.'s profile Sidney
could see the magnolia tree shaped like a heart."It seems to me," said Sidney suddenly, "that you are kind to every one
but me, K."He fairly stammered his astonishment:--

"Why, what on earth have I done?""You are trying to make me marry Max, aren't you?"She was very properly ashamed of that, and, when he failed of reply out
of sheer inability to think of one that would not say too much, she went
hastily to something else:

"It is hard for me to realize that you--that you lived a life of your
own, a busy life, doing useful things, before you came to us.I wish you
would tell me something about yourself.If we're to be friends when you
go away,"--she had to stop there, for the lump in her throat--"I'll want
to know how to think of you,--who your friends are,--all that."He was thinking, of course, that he would be
visualizing her, in the hospital, in the little house on its side
street, as she looked just then, her eyes like stars, her lips just
parted, her hands folded before her on the table."I shall be working," he said at last."Does that mean you won't have time to think of me?""I'm afraid I'm stupider than usual to-night.You can think of me as
never forgetting you or the Street, working or playing."Of course he would not work all the time.And he was going back
to his old friends, to people who had always known him, to girls--

He did his best then.He told her of the old family house, built by one
of his forebears who had been a king's man until Washington had put the
case for the colonies, and who had given himself and his oldest son then
to the cause that he made his own.He told of old servants who had wept
when he decided to close the house and go away.When she fell silent, he
thought he was interesting her.He told her the family traditions that
had been the fairy tales of his childhood.He described the library, the
choice room of the house, full of family paintings in old gilt frames,
and of his father's collection of books.Because it was home, he waxed
warm over it at last, although it had rather hurt him at first to
remember.It brought back the other things that he wanted to forget.Side by side with the
wonders he described so casually, she was placing the little house.What
an exile it must have been for him!How hopelessly middle-class they
must have seemed!How idiotic of her to think, for one moment, that she
could ever belong in this new-old life of his!None, of course, save to be honest and good
and to do her best for the people around her.Her mother's people, the
Kennedys went back a long way, but they had always been poor.She remembered the lamp with the blue-silk
shade, the figure of Eve that used to stand behind the minister's
portrait, and the cherry bookcase with the Encyclopaedia in it and
"Beacon Lights of History."When K., trying his best to interest her and
to conceal his own heaviness of spirit, told her of his grandfather's
old carriage, she sat back in the shadow."Fearful old thing," said K.,--"regular cabriolet.I can remember yet
the family rows over it.But the old gentleman liked it--used to have
it repainted every year.Strangers in the city used to turn around and
stare at it--thought it was advertising something!""When I was a child," said Sidney quietly, "and a carriage drove up and
stopped on the Street, I always knew some one had died!"K., whose ear was attuned to
every note in her voice, looked at her quickly."My great-grandfather,"
said Sidney in the same tone, "sold chickens at market.He didn't do it
himself; but the fact's there, isn't it?"But Sidney's agile mind had already traveled on.This K. she had never
known, who had lived in a wonderful house, and all the rest of it--he
must have known numbers of lovely women, his own sort of women, who had
traveled and knew all kinds of things: girls like the daughters of the
Executive Committee who came in from their country places in summer
with great armfuls of flowers, and hurried off, after consulting their
jeweled watches, to luncheon or tea or tennis."Tell me about the women you have known,
your friends, the ones you liked and the ones who liked you.""I've always been so busy," he confessed."I know a lot, but I don't
think they would interest you.They don't do anything, you know--they
travel around and have a good time.They're rather nice to look at, some
of them.But when you've said that you've said it all."Of course they would be, with nothing else to think of
in all the world but of how they looked.She wanted to go back to the hospital,
and turn the key in the door of her little room, and lie with her face
down on the bed."Would you mind very much if I asked you to take me back?"He had a depressed feeling that the evening had failed.And his depression grew as he brought the car around.After all, a girl couldn't care as
she had for a year and a half, and then give a man up because of another
woman, without a wrench."Do you really want to go home, Sidney, or were you tired of sitting
there?In that case, we could drive around for an hour or two.I'll not
talk if you'd like to be quiet."Being with K. had become an agony, now
that she realized how wrong Christine had been, and that their worlds,
hers and K.Soon they would be separated
by as wide a gulf as that which lay between the cherry bookcase--for
instance,--and a book-lined library hung with family portraits.But she
was not disposed to skimp as to agony.She would go through with it,
every word a stab, if only she might sit beside K. a little longer,
might feel the touch of his old gray coat against her arm."I'd like to
ride, if you don't mind."K. turned the automobile toward the country roads.He was remembering
acutely that other ride after Joe in his small car, the trouble he
had had to get a machine, the fear of he knew not what ahead, and his
arrival at last at the road-house, to find Max lying at the head of the
stairs and Carlotta on her knees beside him."Was there anybody you cared about,--any girl,--when you left home?""I was not in love with anyone, if that's what you mean.""You knew Max before, didn't you?""If you knew things about him that I should have known, why didn't you
tell me?""I couldn't do that, could I?It seemed to me that the mere
fact of your caring for him--" That was shaky ground; he got off it
quickly.Schwitter's had closed up, indeed.The lanterns had been taken down,
and in the dusk they could see Tillie rocking her baby on the porch.As
if to cover the last traces of his late infamy, Schwitter himself was
watering the worn places on the lawn with the garden can.Above the low hum of the engine they could hear
Tillie's voice, flat and unmusical, but filled with the harmonies of
love as she sang to the child.When they had left the house far behind, K. was suddenly aware that
Sidney was crying.She sat with her head turned away, using her
handkerchief stealthily.He drew the car up beside the road, and in a
masterful fashion turned her shoulders about until she faced him."Now, tell me about it," he said.I'm--I'm a little bit lonely.""Aunt Harriet's in Paris, and with Joe gone and everybody--"

"Aunt Harriet!"If she had said she was lonely
because the cherry bookcase was in Paris, he could not have been more
bewildered."And with you going away and never coming back--"

"I'll come back, of course.I'll promise to come back when
you graduate, and send you flowers.""I think," said Sidney, "that I'll become an army nurse.""You won't know, K. You'll be back with your old friends.You'll have
forgotten the Street and all of us.""Girls who have been everywhere, and have lovely clothes, and who won't
know a T bandage from a figure eight!""There will never be anybody in the world like you to me, dear."I--who have wanted you so long that it hurts even to
think about it!Ever since the night I came up the Street, and you were
sitting there on the steps--oh, my dear, my dear, if you only cared a
little!"Because he was afraid that he would get out of hand and take her in his
arms,--which would be idiotic, since, of course, she did not care for
him that way,--he gripped the steering-wheel.It gave him a curious
appearance of making a pathetic appeal to the wind-shield."I have been trying to make you say that all evening!""I
love you so much that--K., won't you take me in your arms?"He held her to him and
muttered incoherencies until she gasped.It was as if he must make up
for long arrears of hopelessness.He held her off a bit to look at her,
as if to be sure it was she and no changeling, and as if he wanted her
eyes to corroborate her lips.There was no lack of confession in her
eyes; they showed him a new heaven and a new earth."It was you always, K.," she confessed.But
now, when you look back, don't you see it was?"He looked back over the months when she had seemed as unattainable as
the stars, and he did not see it."Not when I came to you with everything?I brought you all my troubles,
and you always helped."She bent down and kissed one of his hands.He was so
happy that the foolish little caress made his heart hammer in his ears."I think, K., that is how one can always tell when it is the right one,
and will be the right one forever and ever.It is the person--one goes
to in trouble."He had no words for that, only little caressing touches of her arm, her
hand.Perhaps, without knowing it, he was formulating a sort of prayer
that, since there must be troubles, she would, always come to him and he
would always be able to help her.She was recalling the day she became
engaged to Max, and the lost feeling she had had.She did not feel the
same at all now.She felt as if she had been wandering, and had come
home to the arms that were about her.She would be married, and take the
risk that all women took, with her eyes open.She would go through the
valley of the shadow, as other women did; but K. would be with her.Looking into his steady eyes, she knew that she
was safe.Where before she had felt the clutch of inexorable destiny, the woman's
fate, now she felt only his arms about her, her cheek on his shabby
coat."I shall love you all my life," she said shakily.The little house was dark when they got back to it.The Street, which
had heard that Mr.Le Moyne approved of night air, was raising its
windows for the night and pinning cheesecloth bags over its curtains to
keep them clean.In the second-story front room at Mrs.McKee's, the barytone slept
heavily, and made divers unvocal sounds.He was hardening his throat,
and so slept with a wet towel about it.Wagner sat and made love with
the aid of a lighted match and the pencil-pad.The car drew up at the little house, and Sidney got out.Then it drove
away, for K. must take it to the garage and walk back.Sidney sat on the doorstep and waited.If one did one's best by life, it did its best too.She saw the flicker of the match across the
street, and knew what it meant.Once she would have thought that that
was funny; now it seemed very touching to her.Katie had heard the car, and now she came heavily along the hall."If you think it's a begging
letter, you'd better keep it until he's bought his new suit to-morrow.Almost any moment he's likely to bust out."K. read it in the hall, with Sidney's
shining eyes on him.It began abruptly:--

"I'm going to Africa with one of my cousins.It is a bad station on
the West Coast.I am not going because I feel any call to the work, but
because I do not know what else to do."You were kind to me the other day.I believe, if I had told you then,
you would still have been kind.I tried to tell you, but I was so
terribly afraid."If I caused death, I did not mean to.You will think that no excuse,
but it is true.In the hospital, when I changed the bottles on Miss
Page's medicine-tray, I did not care much what happened.I had been careless about a sponge
count.I made up my mind to get back at you.It seemed hopeless--you
were so secure.For two or three days I tried to think of some way to
hurt you."You remember the packets of gauze sponges we made and used in the
operating-room?When we counted them
as we got them out, we counted by packages.On the night before I left,
I went to the operating-room and added one sponge every here and there.Out of every dozen packets, perhaps, I fixed one that had thirteen.I had meant to give you
trouble, so you would have to do certain cases a second time.I was so frightened that I went down sick over it.When
I got better, I heard you had lost a case and the cause was being
whispered about."I tried to get back into the hospital one night.I went up the
fire-escape, but the windows were locked."I am not going to sign this letter.And I am
not going to ask your forgiveness, or anything of that sort.But one thing hurt me more than anything else, the other
night.You said you'd lost your faith in yourself.This is to tell you
that you need not.And you said something else--that any one can 'come
back.'K. stood in the hall of the little house with the letter in his hand.Just beyond on the doorstep was Sidney, waiting for him.His arms were
still warm from the touch of her.Beyond lay the Street, and beyond that
lay the world and a man's work to do.Work, and faith to do it, a good
woman's hand in the dark, a Providence that made things right in the
end.And, when he was beside her, his long figure folded
to the short measure of the step, he stooped humbly and kissed the hem
of her soft white dress.Wagner wrote something in the dark and then
lighted a match."So K. is in love with Sidney Page, after all!""She
is a sweet girl, and he is every inch a man.But, to my mind, a certain
lady--"

Mrs.McKee flushed and blew out the match.Late September now on the Street, with Joe gone and his mother eyeing
the postman with pitiful eagerness; with Mrs.Rosenfeld moving heavily
about the setting-up of the new furniture; and with Johnny driving
heavenly cars, brake and clutch legs well and Strong.Late September,
with Max recovering and settling his tie for any pretty nurse who
happened along, but listening eagerly for Dr.Ed's square tread in the
hall; with Tillie rocking her baby on the porch at Schwitter's, and
Carlotta staring westward over rolling seas; with Christine taking up
her burden and Grace laying hers down; with Joe's tragic young eyes
growing quiet with the peace of the tropics."The Lord is my shepherd," she reads."Yea, though
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."Sidney, on her knees in the little parlor, repeats the words with the
others.K. has gone from the Street, and before long she will join him.With the vision of his steady eyes before her, she adds her own prayer
to the others--that the touch of his arms about her may not make her
forget the vow she has taken, of charity and its sister, service, of a
cup of water to the thirsty, of open arms to a tired child.These devils were generally disgraced and fallen gods.These
devils generally sympathized with man.In nearly all the theologies,
mythologies and religions, the devils have been much more humane and
merciful than the gods.No devil ever gave one of his generals an order
to kill children and to rip open the bodies of pregnant women.Such
barbarities were always ordered by the good gods!The pestilences were
sent by the most merciful gods!The frightful famine, during which the
dying child with pallid lips sucked the withered bosom of a dead
mother, was sent by the loving gods.No devil was ever charged with such
fiendish brutality.Is it possible that an infinite God created this world simply to be the
dwelling-place of slaves and serfs?simply for the purpose of raising
orthodox Christians?That he did a few miracles to astonish them; that
all the evils of life are simply his punishments, and that he is finally
going to turn heaven into a kind of religious museum filled with Baptist
barnacles, petrified Presbyterians and Methodist mummies?I want no
heaven for which I must give my reason; no happiness in exchange for
my liberty, and no immortality that demands the surrender of my
individuality.Better rot in the windowless tomb, to which there is no
door but the red mouth of the pallid worm, than wear the jeweled collar
even of a god.It is impossible to conceive of a more thoroughly despicable, hateful,
and arrogant being, than the Jewish god.In the mythology of the world he has no parallel.He, only, is
never touched by agony and tears.He cares neither for love nor music,
beauty nor joy.A false friend, an unjust judge, a braggart, hypocrite,
and tyrant.Compared with Jehovah, Pharaoh was a benefactor, and the
tyranny of Egypt was freedom to those who suffered the liberty of God.HEAVEN AND HELL




302.Hope of a Future Life

For my part I know nothing of any other state of existence, either
before or after this, and I have never become personally acquainted with
anybody who did.There may be another life, and if there is the best
way to prepare for it is by making somebody happy in this.God certainly
cannot afford to put a man in hell who has made a little heaven in this
world.I would like to see how things come
out in this world when I am dead.There are some people I should like to
see again, but if there is no other life I shall never know it.I am Immortal

So far as I am concerned I am immortal; that is to say, I can't
recollect when I did not exist, and there never will be a time when I
will remember that I do not exist.I would like to have several millions
of dollars, and I may say I have a lively hope that some day I may be
rich; but to tell you the truth I have very little evidence of it.Our
hope of immortality does not come from any religions, but nearly all
religions come from that hope.The Old Testament, instead of telling
us that we are immortal, tells us how we lost immortality.You will
recollect that if Adam and Eve could have gotten to the tree of life,
they would have eaten of its fruit and would have lived forever; but for
the purpose of preventing immortality God turned them out of the Garden
of Eden, and put certain angels with swords or sabres at the gate to
keep them from getting back.The Old Testament proves, if it proves
anything, which I do not think it does, that there is no life after
this; and the New Testament is not very specific on the subject.There
were a great many opportunities for the Savior and his apostles to
tell us about another world, but they didn't improve them to any great
extent; and the only evidence so far as I know about another life is,
first, that we have no evidence; and, secondly, that we are rather sorry
that we have not, and wish we had.And suppose, after all, that death does end all.Next to eternal joy,
next to being forever with those we love and those who have loved us,
next to that is to be wrapped in the dreamless drapery of eternal peace.Upon the shadowy shore of death
the sea of trouble casts no wave.Eyes that have been curtained by the
everlasting dark will never know again the touch of tears.Lips that
have been touched by the eternal silence will never utter another word
of grief.And I had
rather think of those I have loved, and those I have lost, as having
returned to earth, as having become a part of the elemental wealth of
the the world.I would rather think of them as unconscious dust.I would
rather think of them as gurgling in the stream, floating in the cloud,
bursting into light upon the shores of worlds.I would rather think
of them thus than to have even a suspicion that their souls had been
clutched by an orthodox God.The Old World Ignorant of Destiny

Moses differed from most of the makers of sacred books by his failure
to say anything of a future life, by failing to promise heaven, and to
threaten hell.Upon the subject of a future state, there is not one
word in the Pentateuch.Probably at that early day God did not deem
it important to make a revelation as to the eternal destiny of man.He seems to have thought that he could control the Jews, at least, by
rewards and punishments in this world, and so he kept the frightful
realities of eternal joy and torment a profound secret from the people
of his choice.He thought it far more important to tell the Jews their
origin than to enlighten them as to their destiny.Where the Doctrine of Hell was born

I honestly believe that the doctrine of hell was born in the glittering
eyes of snakes that run in frightful coils watching for their prey.I
believe it was born in the yelping and howling and growling and snarling
of wild beasts.I believe it was born in the grin of hyenas and in the
malicious clatter of depraved apes.I despise it, I defy it, and I hate
it; and when the great ship freighted with the world goes down in
the night of death, chaos and disaster, I will not be guilty of the
ineffable meanness of pushing from my breast my wife and children and
paddling off in some orthodox canoe.I will go down with those I love
and with those who love me.I will go down with the ship and with my
race.Nothing can make me believe that there is any being that is going to
burn and torment and damn his children forever.The Grand Companionships of Hell

Since hanging has got to be a means of grace, I would prefer hell.I had
a thousand times rather associate with the pagan philosophers than with
the inquisitors of the middle ages.I certainly should prefer the worst
man in Greek or Roman history to John Calvin, and I can imagine no man
in the world that I would not rather sit on the same bench with than the
puritan fathers and the founders of orthodox churches.I would trade off
my harp any minute for a seat in the other country.All the poets will
be in perdition, and the greatest thinkers, and, I should think, most
of the women whose society would tend to increase the happiness of
man, nearly all the painters, nearly all the sculptors, nearly all
the writers of plays, nearly all the great actors, most of the best
musicians, and nearly all the good fellows--the persons who know good
stories, who can sing songs, or who will loan a friend a dollar.They will mostly all be in that country, and if I did not live there
permanently, I certainly would want it so I could spend my winter months
there.Let me put one case and I will be through with this branch of the
subject.The husband is a good
fellow and the wife a splendid woman.They live and love each other and
all at once he is taken sick, and they watch day after day and night
after night around his bedside until their property is wasted and
finally she has to go to work, and she works through eyes blinded with
tears, and the sentinel of love watches at the bedside of her prince,
and at the least breath or the least motion she is awake; and she
attends him night after night and day after day for years, and finally
he dies, and she has him in her arms and covers his wasted face with the
tears of agony and love.He dies, and
she buries him and puts flowers above his grave, and she goes there in
the twilight of evening and she takes her children, and tells her little
boys and girls through her tears how brave and how true and how tender
their father was, and finally she dies and goes to hell, because she was
not a believer; and he goes to the battlements of heaven and looks over
and sees the woman who loved him with all the wealth of her love, and
whose tears made his dead face holy and sacred, and he looks upon her
in the agonies of hell without having his happiness diminished in the
least.With all due respect to everybody I say, damn any such doctrine
as that.The Drama of Damnation

When you come to die, as you look back upon the record of your life, no
matter how many men you have wrecked and ruined, and no matter how many
women you have deceived and deserted--all that may be forgiven you;
but if you recollect that you have laughed at God's book you will see
through the shadows of death, the leering looks of fiends and the forked
tongues of devils.For instance, it
is the day of judgment.When the man is called up by the recording
secretary, or whoever does the cross-examining, he says to his soul:
"Where are you from?""Well, I don't like to talk about myself.""Well, I was a good fellow; I loved
my wife; I loved my children.My home was my heaven; my fireside was my
paradise, and to sit there and see the lights and shadows falling on the
faces of those I love, that to me was a perpetual joy.I never gave one
of them a solitary moment of pain.I don't owe a dollar in the world,
and I left enough to pay my funeral expenses and keep the wolf of want
from the door of the house I loved.That is the kind of a man I am."They were always expecting to be happy simply because somebody else was
to be damned.""Well, did you believe that rib story?"To tell you the
God's truth, that was a little more than I could swallow.""Yes, sir, and to the Young Men's Christian
Association.""Did you
ever run off with any of the money?""I don't like to tell, sir.""What kind of a bank did you have?""How much did you
run off with?""Did you take anything
else along with you?""Did you have a wife and children of your own?""Oh, yes; but such was my confidence in God that I
believed he would take care of them."I believed all of it, sir; I often used to be sorry that there were
not harder stories yet in the Bible, so that I could show what my faith
could do."Annihilation rather than be a God

No God has a right to make a man he intends to drown.Eternal wisdom has
no right to make a poor investment, no right to engage in a speculation
that will not finally pay a dividend.No God has a right to make
a failure, and surely a man who is to be damned forever is not a
conspicuous success.Yet upon love's breast, the Church has placed that
asp; around the child of immortality the Church has coiled the worm that
never dies.For my part I want no heaven, if there is to be a hell.I
would rather be annihilated than be a god and know that one human soul
would have to suffer eternal agony."All that have Red Hair shall be Damned."I admit that most Christians are honest--always have admitted it.I
admit that most ministers are honest, and that they are doing the best
they can in their way for the good of mankind; but their doctrines are
hurtful; they do harm in the world; and I am going to do what I can
against their doctrines.They preach this infamy: "He that believes
shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned."Every word
of that text has been an instrument of torture; every letter in that
text has been a sword thrust into the bleeding and quivering heart of
man; every letter has been a dungeon; every line has been a chain; and
that infamous sentence has covered this world with blood.I deny that
"whoso believes shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be
damned."No man can control his belief; you might as well say, "All that
have red hair shall be damned."The Conscience of a Hyena

But, after all, what I really want to do is to destroy the idea of
eternal punishment.That
doctrine fills hell with honest men, and heaven with intellectual and
moral paupers.That doctrine allows people to sin on a credit.That
doctrine allows the basest to be eternally happy and the most honorable
to suffer eternal pain.I think of all doctrines it is the most
infinitely infamous, and would disgrace the lowest savage, and any man
who believes it, and has imagination enough to understand it, has the
heart of a serpent and the conscience of a hyena.I Leave the Dead

But for me I leave the dead where nature leaves them, and whatever
flower of hope springs up in my heart I will cherish.But I cannot
believe that there is any being in this universe who has created a
soul for eternal pain, and I would rather that every God would destroy
himself, I would rather that we all should go back to the eternal chaos,
to the black and starless night, than that just one soul should suffer
eternal agony.Swedenborg did one thing for which I feel almost grateful.He gave an
account of having met John Calvin in hell.Nothing connected with the
supernatural could be more natural than this.The only thing detracting
from the value of this report is, that if there is a hell, we know
without visiting the place that John Calvin must be there.GOVERNING GREAT MEN




315.Jesus Christ

And let me say here once for all, that for the man Christ I have
infinite respect.Let me say once for all that the place where man has
died for man is holy ground.Let me say once for all, to that great and
serene man I gladly pay--I _gladly_ pay the tribute of my admiration and
my tears.He was an infidel in his
time.He was regarded as a blasphemer, and his life was destroyed by
hypocrites who have in all ages done what they could to trample freedom
out of the human mind.Had I lived at that time I would have been his
friend.And should he come again he will not find a better friend than
I will be.For the theological creation I have
a different feeling.If he was in fact God, he knew there was no such
thing as death; he knew that what we call death was but the eternal
opening of the golden gates of everlasting joy.And it took no heroism
to face a death that was simply eternal life.The Emperor Constantine, who lifted Christianity into power, murdered
his wife Fausta and his eldest son Crispus the same year that he
convened the council of Nice to decide whether Jesus Christ was a man or
the son of God.The council decided that Christ was substantial with
the Father.We are thus indebted to a wife
murderer for settling the vexed question of the divinity of the Savior.Theodosius called a council at Constantinople in 381, and this council
decided that the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father.Theodosius,
the younger, assembled another council at Ephesus to ascertain who the
Virgin Mary really was, and it was solemnly decided in the year 431 that
she was the mother of God.In 451 it was decided by a council held at
Chalcedon, called together by the Emperor Marcian, that Christ had two
natures--the human and divine.In 680, in another general council, held
at Constantinople, convened by order of Pognatius, it was also decided
that Christ had two wills, and in the year 1274 it was decided at the
council of Lyons that the Holy Ghost proceeded not only from the Father,
but from the Son as well.Had it not been for these councils we might
have been without a trinity even unto this day.When we take into
consideration the fact that a belief in the trinity is absolutely
essential to salvation, how unfortunate it was for the world that this
doctrine was not established until the year 1274.Think of the millions
that dropped into hell while these questions were being discussed.The church never has pretended that Jefferson or Franklin died in fear.Franklin wrote no books against the fables of the ancient Jews.He
thought it useless to cast the pearls of thought before the swine of
ignorance and fear.He was the father of a
great party.He gave his views in letters and to trusted friends.He
was a Virginian, author of the Declaration of Independence, founder of a
university, father of a political party, President of the United States,
a statesman and philosopher.He was too powerful for the churches of
his day.Paine was a foreigner, a citizen of the world.He had done these things openly, and what
he had said could not be answered.His arguments were so good that his
character was bad.The Emperor, stained with every crime, is supposed to have died like a
Christian.We hear nothing of fiends leering at him in the shadows of
death.He does not see the forms of his murdered wife and son covered
with the blood he shed.From his white and shriveled lips issued no
shrieks of terror.He does not cover his glazed eyes with thin and
trembling hands to shut out the visions of hell.His chamber is filled
with the rustle of wings waiting to bear his soul to the thrilling
realms of joy.Against the Emperor Constantine the church has hurled no
anathema.She has accepted the story of his vision in the clouds, and
his holy memory has been guarded by priest and pope.Diderot

Diderot was born in 1713.His parents were in what may be called the
humbler walks of life.Like Voltaire, he was educated by the Jesuits.He
had in him something of the vagabond, and was for several years almost a
beggar in Paris.He was endeavoring to live by his pen.In that day and
generation a man without a patron, endeavoring to live by literature,
was necessarily almost a beggar.He nearly starved--frequently going
for days without food.Afterward, when he had something himself, he was
generous as the air.No man ever was more willing to give, and no man
less willing to receive, than Diderot.His motto was, "Incredulity
is the first step toward philosophy."He had the vices of most
Christians--was nearly as immoral as the majority of priests.His vices
he shared in common--his virtues were his own--All who knew him united
in saying that he had the pity of a woman, the generosity of a prince,
the self-denial of an anchorite, the courage of Caesar, an insatiate
thirst foi knowledge, and the enthusiasm of a poet.He attacked with
every power of his mind the superstition of his day.He was in favor of universal
education--the church despised it.He wished to put the knowledge of
the whole world within reach of the poorest.He wished to drive from
the gate of the Garden of Eden the cherubim of superstition, so that
the child of Adam might return to eat once more the fruit of the tree
of knowledge.His poor little desk was
ransacked by the police, searching for manuscripts in which something
might be found that would justify the imprisonment of such a dangerous
man.Whoever, in 1750, wished to increase the knowledge of mankind was
regarded as the enemy of social order.Benedict Spinoza

One of the greatest thinkers of the world was Benedict Spinoza--a Jew,
born at Amsterdam in 1638.He asked the rabbis so many questions, and insisted to such a degree on
what he called reason, that his room was preferred to his company.His Jewish brethren excommunicated him from the synagogue.Under the
terrible curse of their religion he was made an outcast from every
Jewish home.His own father could not give him shelter, and his mother,
after the curse had been pronounced, could not give him bread, could not
even speak to him, without becoming an outcast herself.All the cruelty
of Jehovah was in this curse.Spinoza was but twenty-four years old
when he found himself without friends and without kindred.He earned his bread with willing hands, and cheerfully
divided his poor crust with those below.He tried to solve the problem
of existence.According to him the universe did not commence to
be.It is; from eternity it was; and to eternity it will be.He insisted
that God is inside, not outside, of what we call substance.Thomas Paine

Poverty was his mother--Necessity his master.He had more brains than
books; more sense than education; more courage than politeness;
more strength than polish.He had no veneration for old mistakes--no
admiration for ancient lies.He loved the truth for the truth's
sake, and for man's sake.He saw oppression on every hand; injustice
everywhere; hypocrisy at the altar, venality on the bench, tyranny on
the throne; and with a splendid courage he espoused the cause of the
weak against the strong--of the enslaved many against the titled few.The Greatest of all Political Writers

In my judgment, Thomas Paine was the best political writer that ever
lived."What he wrote was pure nature, and his soul and his pen ever
went together."Ceremony, pageantry, and all the paraphernalia of
power, had no effect upon him.He examined into the why and wherefore of
things.He was perfectly radical in his mode of thought.Nothing short
of the bed-rock satisfied him.His enthusiasm for what he believed to
be right knew no bounds.During all the dark scenes of the Revolution,
never for one moment did he despair.Year after year his brave words
were ringing through the land, and by the bivouac fires the weary
soldiers read the inspiring words of "Common Sense," filled with ideas
sharper than their swords, and consecrated themselves anew to the cause
of Freedom.The Writings of Paine

The writings of Paine are gemmed with compact statements that carry
conviction to the dullest.Day and night he labored for America, until
there was a government of the people and for the people.At the close
of the Revolution no one stood higher than Thomas Paine.Had he been
willing to live a hypocrite, he would have been respectable, he at least
could have died surrounded by other hypocrites, and at his death there
would have been an imposing funeral, with miles of carriages, filled
with hypocrites, and above his hypocritical dust there would have been a
hypocritical monument covered with lies.The truth is, he died as he had lived.Some ministers were impolite
enough to visit him against his will.Several of them he ordered
from his room.A couple of Catholic priests, in all the meekness of
hypocrisy, called that they might enjoy the agonies of a dying friend
of man.Thomas Paine, rising in his bed, the few embers of expiring life
blown into flame by the breath of indignation, had the goodness to curse
them both.His physician, who seems to have been a meddling fool, just
as the cold hand of death was touching the patriot's heart, whispered
in the dull ear of the dying man: "Do you believe, or do you wish to
believe, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?"And the reply was: "I
have no wish to believe on that subject."These were the last remembered
words of Thomas Paine.He died as serenely as ever Christian passed
away.He died in the full possession of his mind, and on the very brink
and edge of death proclaimed the doctrines of his life.Paine Believed in God

Thomas Paine was a champion in both hemispheres of human liberty; one of
the founders and fathers of the Republic; one of the foremost men of his
age.He never wrote a word in favor of injustice.He was a despiser of
slavery.He wast in the widest and
best sense, a friend of all his race.His head was as clear as his heart
was good, and he had the courage to speak his honest thought.He was
the first man to write these words: "The United States of America."He furnished every thought
that now glitters in the Declaration of Independence.He believed in one
God and no more.He was a believer even in special providence, and he
hoped for immortality.The Intellectual Hera

Thomas Paine was one of the intellectual heroes--one of the men to whom
we are indebted.His name is associated forever with the Great Republic.As long as free government exists he will be remembered, admired and
honored.He lived a long, laborious and useful life.The world is better
for his having lived.For the sake of truth he accepted hatred and
reproach for his portion.His friends
were untrue to him because he was true to himself, and true to them.He
lost the respect of what is called society, but kept his own.His life
is what the world calls failure and what history calls success.If to
love your fellow-men more than self is goodness, Thomas Paine was good.If to be in advance of your time--to be a pioneer in the direction of
right--is greatness.If to avow your principles and discharge your
duty in the presence of death is heroic, Thomas Paine was a hero.At the
age of seventy-three, death touched his tired heart.He died in the land
his genius defended--under the flag he gave to the skies.Slander cannot
touch him now--hatred cannot reach him more.He sleeps in the sanctuary
of the tomb, beneath the quiet of the stars.Paine, Franklin, Jefferson

In our country there were three infidels--Paine, Franklin and Jefferson.The colonies were full of superstition, the Puritans with the spirit
of persecution.Laws savage, ignorant, and malignant had been passed in
every colony for the purpose of destroying intellectual liberty.The toleration acts of
Maryland tolerated only Christians--not infidels, not thinkers, not
investigators.The charity of Roger Williams was not extended to those
who denied the Bible, or suspected the divinity of Christ.It was not
based upon the rights of man, but upon the rights of believers, who
differed in non-essential points.David Hume

On the 26th of April, 1711, David Hume was born.David Hume was one of
the few Scotchmen of his day who were not owned by the church.He had
the manliness to examine historical and religious questions for himself,
and the courage to give his conclusions to the world.He was singularly
capable of governing himself.He was a philosopher, and lived a calm
and cheerful life, unstained by an unjust act, free from all excess,
and devoted in a reasonable degree to benefiting his fellow-men.After
examining the Bible he became convinced that it was not true.For
failing to suppress his real opinion, for failing to tell a deliberate
falsehood, he brought upon him the hatred of the church.Voltaire

Voltaire was the intellectual autocrat of his time.From his throne at
the foot of the Alps he pointed the finger of scorn at every hypocrite
in Europe.He left the quiver of ridicule without an arrow.He was the
pioneer of his century.Through the
shadows of faith and fable, through the darkness of myth and miracle,
through the midnight of Christianity, through the blackness of bigotry,
past cathedral and dungeon, past rack and stake, past altar and throne,
he carried, with brave and chivalric hands, the torch of reason.John Calvin

Calvin was of a pallid, bloodless complexion, thin, sickly, irritable,
gloomy, impatient, egotistic, tyrannical, heartless, and infamous.He
was a strange compound of revengeful morality, malicious forgiveness,
ferocious charity, egotistic humility, and a kind of hellish justice.In other words, he was as near like the God of the Old Testament as his
health permitted.Calvin's Five Fetters

This man forged five fetters for the brain.That is to say, predestination, particular redemption, total
depravity, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints.About
the neck of each follower he put a collar bristling with these five iron
points.The presence of all these points on the collar is still the test
of orthodoxy in the church he founded.This man, when in the flush of
youth, was elected to the office of preacher in Geneva.He at once,
in union with Farel, drew up a condensed statement of the Presbyterian
doctrine, and all the citizens of Geneva, on pain of banishment, were
compelled to take an oath that they believed this statement.Of this
proceeding Calvin very innocently remarked that it produced great
satisfaction.A man named Caroli had the audacity to dispute with
Calvin.Humboldt

Humboldt breathed the atmosphere of investigation.Old ideas were
abandoned; old creeds, hallowed by centuries, were thrown aside; thought
became courageous; the athlete, Reason, challenged to mortal combat the
monsters of superstition.Humbolt's Travels

Europe becoming too small for his genius, he visited the tropics.He
sailed along the gigantic Amazon--the mysterious Orinoco--traversed the
Pampas--climbed the Andes until he stood upon the crags of Chimborazo,
more than eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, and climbed
on until blood flowed from his eyes and lips.For nearly five years he
pursued his investigations in the new world, accompanied by the intrepid
Bonplandi.He was the best intellectual
organ of these new revelations of science.He was calm, reflective and
eloquent; filled with a sense of the beautiful, and the love of truth.His collections were immense, and valuable beyond calculation to every
science.He endured innumerable hardships, braved countless dangers in
unknown and savage lands, and exhausted his fortune for the advancement
of true learning.Humboldt's Illustrious Companions

Humboldt was the friend and companion of the greatest poets, historians,
philologists, artists, statesmen, critics, and logicians of his time.He was the companion of Schiller, who believed that man would be
regenerated through the influence of the Beautiful of Goethe, the grand
patriarch of German literature; of Weiland, who has been called
the Voltaire of Germany; of Herder, who wrote the outlines of a
philosophical history of man; of Kotzebue, who lived in the world of
romance; of Schleiermacher, the pantheist; of Schlegel, who gave to
his countrymen the enchanted realm of Shakespeare; of the sublime Kant,
author of the first work published in Germany on Pure Reason; of Fichte,
the infinite idealist; of Schopenhauer, the European Buddhist who
followed the great Gautama to the painless and dreamless Nirwana, and
of hundreds of others, whose names are familiar to and honored by the
scientific world.Humboldt the Apostle of Science

Upon his return to Europe he was hailed as the second Columbus; as the
scientific discover of America; as the revealer of a new world; as the
great demonstrator of the sublime truth, that the universe is governed
by law.I have seen a picture of the old man, sitting upon a mountain
side--above him the eternal snow--below, the smiling valley of the
tropics, filled with vine and palm; his chin upon his breast, his
eyes deep, thoughtful and calm his forehead majestic--grander than the
mountain upon which he sat--crowned with the snow of his whitened hair,
he looked the intellectual autocrat of this world.Not satisfied with
his discoveries in America, he crossed the steppes of Asia, the wastes
of

Siberia, the great Ural range adding to the knowledge of mankind at
every step.H is energy acknowledged no obstacle, his life knew no
leisure; every day was filled with labor and with thought.He was one
of the apostles of science, and he served his divine master with
a self-sacrificing zeal that knew no abatement; with an ardor that
constantly increased, and with a devotion unwavering and constant as the
polar star.Ingersoll Muses by Napoleon's Tomb

A little while ago I stood by the grave of the old Napoleon--a
magnificent tomb of gilt and gold, fit almost for a dead deity--and
gazed upon the sarcophagus of black Egyptian marble, where rest at last
the ashes of the restless man.I leaned over the balustrade and thought
about the career of the greatest soldier of the modern world.I saw him
walking upon the banks of the Seine, contemplating suicide--I saw him
at Toulon--I saw him putting down the mob in the streets of Paris--I saw
him at the head of the army of Italy--I saw him crossing the bridge of
Lodi with the tri-color in his hand--I saw him in Egypt in the shadows
of the pyramids--I saw him conquer the Alps and mingle the eagles of
France with the eagles of the crags.I saw him at Marengo--at Ulm and
Austerlitz.I saw him in Russia, where the infantry of the snow and the
cavalry of the wild blast scattered his legions like Winter's withered
leaves.I saw him at Leipsic in defeat and disaster--driven by a million
bayonets back upon Paris--clutched like a wild beast--banished to Elba.I saw him escape and retake an empire by the force of his genius.I saw
him upon the frightful field of Waterloo, where chance and fate combined
to wreck the fortunes of their former king.Helena,
with his hands crossed behind him, gazing out upon the sad and solemn
sea.I thought of the orphans and widows he had made--of the tears that
had been shed for his glory, and of the only woman who ever loved him,
pushed from his heart by the cold hand of ambition.And I said I would
rather have been a French peasant, and worn wooden shoes.I would rather
have lived in a hut with a vine growing over the door, and the grapes
growing purple in the kisses of the Autumn sun.I would rather have been
that poor peasant with my loving wife by my side, knitting as the day
died out of the sky--with my children upon my knees and their arms about
me; I would rather have been that man and gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless dust, than to have been that imperial
impersonation of force and murder known as Napoleon the Great.And so I
would, ten thousand times.Eulogy on J. G. Blaine

This is a grand year--a year filled with recollections of the
Revolution; filled with the proud and tender memories of the past; with
the sacred legends of liberty; a year in which the sons of freedom will
drink from the fountains of enthusiasm; a year in which the people call
for a man who has preserved in Congress what our soldiers won upon
the field; a year in which they call for the man who has torn from the
throat of treason the tongue of slander--for the man who has snatched
the mask of Democracy from the hideous face of rebellion; for this man
who, like an intellectual athlete, has stood in the arena of debate and
challenged all comers, and who is still a total stranger to defeat.Like
an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, James G. Blaine marched down the
halls of the American Congress and threw his shining lance full and
fair against the brazen foreheads of the defamers of his country and the
maligners of her honor.For the Republican party to desert this gallant
leader now is as though an army should desert their General upon the
field of battle.James G. Blaine is now and has been for years the
bearer of the sacred standard of the Republican party.A Model Leader

The Republicans of the United States want a man who knows that this
Government should protect every citizen, at home and abroad; who knows
that any Government that will not defend its defenders and protect its
protectors is a disgrace to the map of the world.They demand a man who
believes in the eternal separation and divorcement of church and school.They demand a man whose political reputation is as spotless as a star;
but they do not demand that their candidate shall have a certificate of
moral character signed by a Confederate Congress.The man who has, in
full, heaped and rounded measure, all these splendid qualifications is
the present grand and gallant leader of the Republican party--James G.
Blaine.Our country, crowned with the vast and marvelous achievements
of its first century, asks for a man worthy of the past and prophetic
of her future; asks for a man who has the audacity of genius; asks for
a man who is the grandest combination of heart, conscience and brain
beneath her flag.Such a man is James G. Blaine.Abraham Lincoln

This world has not been fit to live in fifty years.There is no liberty
in it--very little.Why, it is only a few years ago that all the
Christian nations were engaged in the slave trade.It was not until 1808
that England abolished the slave trade, and up to that time her priests
in her churches and her judges on her benches owned stock in slave
ships, and luxuriated on the profits of piracy and murder; and when a
man stood up and denounced it they mobbed him as though he had been a
common burglar or a horse thief.It was not until the 28th
day of August, 1833, that England abolished slavery in her colonies; and
it was not until the 1st day of January, 1862, that Abraham Lincoln, by
direction of the entire North, wiped that infamy out of this country;
and I never speak of Abraham Lincoln but I want to say that he was, in
my judgment, in many respects the grandest man ever President of the
United States.I say that upon his tomb there ought to be this line--and
I know of no other man deserving it so well as he: "Here lies one who
having been clothed with almost absolute power never abused it except on
the side of mercy."Swedenborg

Swedenborg was a man of great intellect, of vast acquirements, and of
honest intentions; and I think it equally clear that upon one subject,
at least, his mind was touched, shattered and shaken.Misled by
analogies, imposed upon by the bishop, deceived by the woman, borne to
other worlds upon the wings of dreams, living in the twilight of reason
and the dawn of insanity, he regarded every fact as a patched and ragged
garment with a lining of the costliest silk, and insisted that the wrong
side, even of the silk, was far more beautiful than the right.Jeremy Bentham

The glory of Bentham is, that he gave the true basis of morals, and
furnished the statesmen with the star and compass of this sentence: "The
greatest happiness of the greatest number."Charles Fourier

Fourier sustained about the same relation to this world that Swedenborg
did to the other.There must be something wrong about the brain of one
who solemnly asserts that "the elephant, the ox and the diamond were
created by the Sun; the horse, the lily, and the ruby, by Saturn; the
cow, the jonquil and the topaz, by Jupiter; and the dog, the violet
and the opal stones by the earth itself."And yet, forgetting these
aberrations of the mind, this lunacy of a great and loving soul, for
one, that's in tender-est regard the memory of Charles Fourier, one of
the best and noblest of our race.Auguste Comte

There was in the brain of the great Frenchman--Auguste Comte--the dawn
of that happy day in which humanity will be the only religion, good the
only God, happiness the only object, restitution the only atonement,
mistake the only sin, and affection guided by intelligence, the only
savior of mankind.This dawn enriched his poverty, illuminated the
darkness of his life, peopled his loneliness with the happy millions yet
to be, and filled his eyes with proud and tender tears.When everything
connected with Napoleon, except his crimes, shall be forgotten, Auguste
Comte will be lovingly remembered as a benefactor of the human race.Herbert Spencer

Herbert Spencer relies upon evidence, upon demonstration, upon
experience; and occupies himself with one world at a time.He perceives
that there is a mental horizon that we cannot pierce, and that beyond
that is the unknown, possibly the unknowable.He endeavors to examine
only that which is capable of being examined, and considers the
theological method as not only useless, but hurtful.After all God is
but a guess, throned and established by arrogance and assertion.Turning his attention to those things that have in some way affected
the condition of mankind, Spencer leaves the unknowable to priests and
believers.Robert Collyer

I have the honor of a slight acquaintance with Robert Collyer.I have
read with pleasure some of his exquisite productions.He has a brain
full of the dawn, the head of a philosopher, the imagination of a poet
and the sincere heart of a child.Had such men as Robert Collyer and
John Stuart Mill been present at the burning of Servetus, they would
have extinguished the flames with their tears.Had the presbytery of
Chicago been there, they would have quietly turned their backs, solemnly
divided their coat tails, and warmed themselves.John Milton

England was filled with Puritan gloom and Episcopal ceremony.All
religious conceptions were of the grossest nature.The ideas of crazy
fanatics and extravagant poets were taken as sober facts.Milton had
clothed Christianity in the soiled and faded finery of the gods--had
added to the story of Christ the fables of Mythology, He gave to the
Protestant Church the most outrageously material ideas of the Deity.He turned all the angels into soldiers--made heaven a battlefield, put
Christ in uniform, and described God as a militia general.His works
were considered by the Protestants nearly as sacred as the Bible
itself, and the imagination of the people was thoroughly polluted by the
horrible imagery, the sublime absurdity of the blind Milton.Ernst Haeckel

Amongst the bravest, side by side with the greatest of the world in
Germany, the land of science--stands Ernst Haeckel, who may be said
not only to have demonstrated the theories of Darwin, but the monistic
conception of the world.He has endeavored--and I think with complete
success--to show that there is not, and never was, and never can be,
the creator of anything.Haeckel is one of the bitterest enemies of the
church, and is, therefore, one of the bravest friends of man.Professor Swing, a Dove amongst Vultures

Professor Swing was too good a man to stay in the Presbyterian Church.He was a rose amongst thistles; he was a dove amongst vultures; and they
hunted him out, and I am glad he came out.I have the greatest respect
for Professor Swing, but I want him to tell whether the 109th Psalm is
inspired.Queen Victoria and George Eliot

Compare George Eliot with Queen Victoria.The Queen is clad in garments
given her by blind fortune and unreasoning chance, while George Eliot
wears robes of glory woven in the loom of her own genius.The time is coming when men will be rated at their real
worth; when we shall care nothing for an officer if he does not fill his
place.Bough on Rabbi Bien

I will not answer Rabbi Bien, and I will tell you why.Because he has
taken himself outside of all the limits of a gentleman; because he has
taken upon himself to traduce American women in language the beastliest
I ever read; and any man who says that the American women are not just
as good women as any God can make, and pick his mind to-day, is an
unappreciative barbarian.I will let him alone because he denounced all
the men in this country, all the members of Congress, all the members
of the Senate, all the Judges on the bench, as thieves and robbers.I
pronounce him a vulgar falsifier, and let him alone.General Garfield

No man has been nominated for the office since I was born, by either
party, who had more brains and more heart than James A. Garfield.He
was a soldier, he is a statesman.In time of peace he preferred the
avocations of peace; when the bugle of war blew in his ears he withdrew
from his work and fought for the flag, and then he went back to the
avocation of peace.And I say to-day that a man who, in a time of
profound peace, makes up his mind that he would like to kill folks for
a living is no better, to say the least of it, than the man who loves
peace in the time of peace, and who, when his country is attacked,
rushes to the rescue of her flag."Wealthy in Integrity; In Brain a Millionaire."James A. Garfield is to-day a poor man, and you know that there is not
money enough in this magnificent street to buy the honor and manhood of
James A. Garfield.Money cannot make such a man, and I will swear to you
that money cannot buy him.James A. Garfield to-day wears the glorious
robe of honest poverty.He is a poor man; but I like to say it here in
Wall street; I like to say it surrounded by the millions of America; I
like to say it in the midst of banks, and bonds, and stocks; I love to
say it where gold is piled--that, although a poor man, he is rich in
honor, in integrity he is wealthy, and in brain he is a millionaire.Garfield a Certificate of the Splendor of the American Constitution

Garfield is a certificate of the splendor of our Government, that says
to every poor boy: "All the avenues of honor are open to you."He is a scholar; he is a statesman; he was a
soldier; he is a patriot; and above all he is a magnificent man, and if
every man in New York knew him as well as I do, Garfield would not lose
a hundred votes in this city.W. Hiram Thomas

The best thing that has come from the other side is from Dr.I
regard him as by far the grandest intellect in the Methodist Church.He
is intellectually a wide and tender man.I cannot conceive of an article
being written in a better spirit.He finds a little fault with me for
not being exactly fair.Thomas
the probability is I never should have laid myself liable to criticism.There is some human nature in me, and I find it exceedingly difficult
to preserve at all times perfect serenity.I have the greatest possible
respect for Dr.Thomas, and must heartily thank him for his perfect
fairness.MISCELLANEOUS




355.Heresy and Orthodoxy

It has always been the man ahead that has been called the heretic.Heresy is the last and best thought always!Heresy extends the
hospitality of the brain to a new idea; that is what the rotting says to
flax growing; that is what the dweller in the swamp says to the man on
the sun-lit hill; that is what the man in the darkness cries out to the
grand man upon whose forehead is shining the dawn of a grander day; that
is what the coffin says to the cradle.Orthodoxy is a kind of shroud,
and heresy is a banner--Orthodoxy is a fog and Heresy a star shining
forever upon the cradle of truth.I do not mean simply in religion, I
mean in everything and the idea I wish to impress upon you is that you
should keep your minds open to all the influences of nature, you should
keep your minds open to reason; hear what a man has to say, and do not
let the turtle-shell of bigotry grow above your brain.Give everybody a
chance and an opportunity; that is all.We used to worship the golden calf, and the worst you can say of us now,
is, we worship the gold of the calf, and even the calves are beginning
to see this distinction.We used to go down on our knees to every man
that held office, now he must fill it if he wishes any respect.We care
nothing for the rich, except what will they do with their money?How does he fill it?--that is the question.And there is rapidly growing
up in the world an aristocracy of heart and brain--the only aristocracy
that has a right to exist.Truth will Bear the Test

If a man has a diamond that has been examined by the lapidaries of the
world, and some ignorant stonecutter told him that it is nothing but
an ordinary rock, he laughs at him; but if it has not been examined
by lapidaries, and he is a little suspicious himself that it is not
genuine, it makes him mad.Any doctrine that will not bear investigation
is not a fit tenant for the mind of an honest man.Any man who is afraid
to have his doctrine investigated is not only a coward but a hypocrite.Paring Nails

Why should we in this age of the world be dominated by the dead?Why
should barbarian Jews who went down to death and dust three thousand
years ago, control the living world?Why should we care for the
superstition of men who began the sabbath by paring their nails,
"beginning at the fourth finger, then going to the second, then to the
fifth, then to the third, and ending with the thumb?"How pleasing to
God this must have been.There may be a God

There may be for aught I know, somewhere in the unknown shoreless vast,
some being whose dreams are constellations and within whose thought the
infinite exists.About this being, if such an one exists, I have nothing
to say.He has written no books, inspired no barbarians, required no
worship, and has prepared no hell in which to burn the honest seeker
after truth.The People are Beginning to Think

The people are beginning to think, to reason and to investigate.Slowly,
painfully, but surely, the gods are being driven from the earth.Only
upon rare occasions are they, even by the most religious, supposed to
interfere in the affairs of men.In most matters we are at last supposed
to be free.Since the invention of steamships and railways, so that the
products of all countries can be easily interchanged, the gods have quit
the business of producing famine.Unchained Thought

For the vagaries of the clouds the infidels propose to substitute the
realities of earth; for superstition, the splendid demonstrations and
achievements of science; and for theological tyranny, the chainless
liberty of thought.Man the Victor of the Future

If abuses are destroyed, man must destroy them.If slaves are freed, man
must free them.If new truths are discovered, man must discover them.If the naked are clothed; if the hungry are fed; if justice is done;
if labor is rewarded; if superstition is driven from the mind; if the
defenseless are protected, and if the right finally triumphs, all must
be the work of man.The grand victories of the future must be won by
man, and by man alone.The Sacred Sabbath

Of all the superstitious of mankind, this insanity about the "sacred
Sabbath" is the most absurd.The idea of feeling it a duty to be solemn
and sad one-seventh of the time!To think that we can please an infinite
being by staying in some dark and sombre room, instead of walking in the
perfumed fields!Why should God hate to see a man happy?Why should it
excite his wrath to see a family in the woods, by some babbling stream,
talking, laughing and loving?Nature works on that "sacred" day.The
earth turns, the rivers run, the trees grow, buds burst into flower, and
birds fill the air with song.Why should we look sad, and think about
death, and hear about-hell?Why should that day be filled with gloom
instead of joy?Make the Sabbath Merry

Freethinkers should make the Sabbath a day of mirth and music; a day to
spend with wife and child--a day of games, and books, and dreams--a day
to put fresh flowers above our sleeping dead--a day of memory and hope,
of love and rest.Away to the Hills and the Sea

A poor mechanic, working all the week in dust and noise, needs a day of
rest and joy, a day to visit stream and wood--a day to live with wife
and child; a day in which to laugh at care, and gather hope and strength
for toils to come.And his weary wife needs a breath of sunny air, away
from street and wall, amid the hills or by the margin of the sea, where
she can sit and prattle with her babe, and fill with happy dreams the
long, glad day.Melancholy Sundays

When I was a little fellow most everybody thought that some days were
too sacred for the young ones to enjoy themselves in.Sunday used to commence Saturday night at sundown, under
the old text, "The evening and the morning were the first day."They
commenced then, I think, to get a good ready.When the sun went down
Saturday night, darkness ten thousand times deeper than ordinary night
fell upon that house.The boy that looked the sickest was regarded as
the most pious.You could not crack hickory nuts that night, and if you
were caught chewing gum it was another evidence of the total depravity
of the human heart.We would sometimes
sing, "Another day has passed."Everybody looked as though they had the
dyspesia--you know lots of people think they are pious, just because
they are bilious, as Mr.It was a solemn night, and the next
morning the solemnity had increased.Then we went to church, and the
minister was in a pulpit about twenty feet high.If it was in the winter
there was no fire; it was not thought proper to be comfortable while you
were thanking the Lord.The minister commenced at firstly and ran up to
about twenty-fourthly, and then he divided it up again; and then he
made some concluding remarks, and then he said lastly, and when he said
lastly he was about half through.Moses took Egyptian Law for his Model

It has been contended for many years that the ten commandments are the
foundation of all ideas of justice and of law.Eminent jurists have
bowed to popular prejudice, and deformed their works by statements to
the effect that the Mosaic laws are the fountains from which sprang all
ideas of right and wrong.Nothing can be more stupidly false than such
assertions.Thousands of years before Moses was born, the Egyptians
had a code of laws.They had laws against blasphemy, murder, adultery,
larceny, perjury, laws for the collection of debts, and the enforcement
of contracts.A False Standard of Success

It is not necessary to be rich, nor powerful, nor great, to be a
success; and neither is it necessary to have your name between the
putrid lips of rumor to be great.We have had a false standard of
success.In the years when I was a little boy we read in our books that
no fellow was a success that did not make a fortune or get a big office,
and he generally was a man that slept about three hours a night.They
never put down in the books the gentlemen who succeeded in life and yet
slept all they wanted to.Toilers and Idlers

You can divide mankind into two classes: the laborers and the idlers,
the supporters and the supported, the honest and the dishonest.Every
man is dishonest who lives upon the unpaid labor of others, no matter
if he occupies a throne.The laborers
should have equal-rights before the world and before the law.And I want
every farmer to consider every man who labors either with hand or brain
as his brother.Until genius and labor formed a partnership there was
no such thing as prosperity among men.Every reaper and mower, every
agricultural implement, has elevated the work of the farmer, and his
vocation grows grander with every invention.In the olden time the
agriculturist was ignorant; he knew nothing of machinery, he was the
slave of superstition.The Sad Wilderness History

While reading the Pentateuch, I am filled with indignation, pity and
horror.Nothing can be sadder than the history of the starved and
frightened wretches who wandered over the desolate crags and sands of
wilderness and desert, the prey of famine, sword and plague.Ignorant
and superstitious to the last degree, governed by falsehood, plundered
by hypocrisy, they were the sport of priests, and the food of fear.God
was their greatest enemy, and death their only friend.Law Much Older than Sinai

Laws spring from the instinct of self-preservation.Industry objected
to supporting idleness, and laws were made against theft.Laws were made
against murder, because a very large majority of the people have always
objected to being murdered.All fundamental laws were born simply of the
instinct of self-defence.Long before the Jewish savages assembled at
the foot of Sinai, laws had been made and enforced, not only in Egypt
and India, but by every tribe that ever existed.God raised the black flag, and
commanded his soldiers to kill even the smiling infant in its mother's
arms.Who is the blasphemer; the man who denies the existence of God, or
he who covers the robes of the infinite with innocent blood?Standing Tip for God

We are told in the Pentateuch that God, the father of us all, gave
thousands of maidens, after having killed their fathers, their mothers,
and their brothers, to satisfy the brutal lusts of savage men.If there
be a God, I pray him to write in his book, opposite my name, that I
denied this lie for him.Matter and Force

The statement in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, I
cannot accept.It is contrary to my reason, and I cannot believe it.It
appears reasonable for me that force has existed from eternity.Force
cannot, as it appears to me, exist apart from matter.Force, in its
nature, is forever active, and without matter it could not act; and so
I think matter must have existed forever.To conceive of matter without
force, or of force without matter, or of a time when neither existed,
or of a being who existed for an eternity without either, and who out of
nothing created both, is to me utterly impossible.It may be that I am led to these conclusions by "total depravity," or
that I lack the necessary humility of spirit to satisfactorily harmonize
Haeckel and Moses; or that I am carried away by pride, blinded by
reason, given over to hardness of heart that I might be damned, but I
never can believe that the earth was covered with leaves, and buds, and
flowers, and fruits, before the sun with glittering spear had driven
back the hosts of night.We are told that God made man; and the question naturally arises, how
was this done?Was it by a process of "evolution," "development;" the
"transmission of acquired habits;" the "survival of the fittest," or was
the necessary amount of clay kneaded to the proper consistency, and then
by the hands of God moulded into form?Modern science tells that man has
been evolved, through countless epochs, from the lower forms; that he
is the result of almost an infinite number of actions, reactions,
experiences, states, forms, wants and adaptations.General Joshua

My own opinion is that General Joshua knew no more about the motions of
the earth than he did mercy and justice.If he had known that the earth
turned upon its axis at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, and swept
in its course about the sun at the rate of sixty-eight thousand miles
an hour, he would have doubled the hailstones, spoken of in the same
chapter, that the Lord cast down from heaven, and allowed the sun and
moon to rise and set in the usual way.This getting up so early in the morning is a relic of barbarism.It has
made hundreds of thousands of young men curse business.There is no need
of getting up at three or four o'clock in the winter morning.The farmer
who persists in dragging his wife and children from their beds ought to
be visited by a missionary.It is time enough to rise after the sun has
set the example.Why
not feed them more the night before?In the old
times they used to get up about three o'clock in the morning, and go to
work long before the sun had risen with "healing upon his wings," and as
a just punishment they all had the ague; and they ought to have it now.Sleep is the best medicine
in the world.There is no such thing as health, without plenty of sleep.When you work, work;
and when you get through take a good, long and refreshing sleep.Never Rise at Four O'Clock

The man who cannot get a living upon Illinois soil without rising before
daylight ought to starve.Eight hours a day is enough for any farmer to
work except in harvest time.When you rise at four and work till dark
what is life worth?Of what use are all the improvements in farming?Of what use is all the improved machinery unless it tends to give the
farmer a little more leisure?What is harvesting now, compared with what
it was in the old time?Think of the days of reaping, of cradling, of
raking and binding and mowing.Think of threshing with the flail and
winnowing with the wind.And now think of the reapers and mowers, the
binders and threshing machines, the plows and cultivators, upon which
the farmer rides protected from the sun.If, with all these advantages,
you cannot get a living without rising in the middle of the night, go
into some other business.The Hermit is Mad

A hermit is a mad man.Without friends and wife and child, there is
nothing left worth living for.They
are filled with egotism and envy, with vanity and hatred.People who
live much alone become narrow and suspicious.They are apt to be the
property of one idea.They begin to think there is no use in anything.They look upon the happiness of others as a kind of folly.They hate
joyous folks, because, way down in their hearts, they envy them.Duke Orang-Outang

I think we came from the lower animals.I am not dead sure of it, but
think so.When I first read about it I didn't like it.My heart was
filled with sympathy for those people who leave nothing to be proud of
except ancestors.I thought how terrible this will be upon the nobility
of the old world.Think of their being forced to trace their ancestry
back to the Duke Orang-Outang or to the Princess Chimpanzee.After
thinking it all over I came to the conclusion that I liked that
doctrine.I read about
rudimentary bones and muscles.I was told that everybody had rudimentary
muscles extending from the ear into the cheek.I was told: "They are the remains of muscles; they became rudimentary
from the lack of use."They are the muscles
with which your ancestors used to flap their ears.Well, at first I was
greatly astonished, and afterward I was more astonished to find they had
become rudimentary.Self-Made Men

It is often said of this or that man that he is a self-made man--that
he was born of the poorest and humblest parents, and that with every
obstacle to overcome he became great.Most of the intellectual giants of the world
have been nursed at the sad but loving breast of poverty.Most of those
who have climbed highest on the shining ladder of fame commenced at the
lowest round.They were reared in the straw thatched cottages of Europe;
in the log houses of America; in the factories of the great cities; in
the midst of toil; in the smoke and din of labor.The One Window in the Ark

A cubit is twenty-two inches; so that the ark was five hundred and fifty
feet long, ninety-one feet and eight inches wide, and fifty-five feet
high.The ark was divided into three stories, and had on top, one window
twenty-two inches square.Ventillation must have been one of Jehovah's
hobbies.Think of a ship larger than the Great Eastern with only one
window, and that but twenty-two inches square!No Ante-Diluvian Camp-Meetings!It is a little curious that when God wished to reform the ante-diluvian
world he said nothing about hell; that he had no revivals, no
camp-meetings, no tracts, no out-pourings of the Holy Ghost, no
baptisms, no noon prayer meetings, and never mentioned the great
doctrine of salvation by faith.If the orthodox creeds of the world are
true, all those people went to hell without ever having heard that such
a place existed.If eternal torment is a fact, surely these miserable
wretches ought to have been warned.They were threatened only with water
when they were in fact doomed to eternal fire!Hard Work in the Ark

Eight persons did all the work.They attended to the wants of 175,000
birds, 3,616 beasts, 1,300 reptiles, and 2,000,000 insects, saying
nothing of countless animalculae.Can we believe that the inspired writer had any idea of the size of the
sun?Draw a circle five inches in diameter, and by its side thrust a pin
through the paper.The hole made by the pin will sustain about the same
relation to the circle that the earth does to the sun.Did he know that
the sun was eight hundred and sixty thousand miles in diameter; that it
was enveloped in an ocean of fire thousands of miles in depth, hotter
even than the Christian's hell?Did he know that the volume of the Earth
is less than one-millionth of that of the sun?Did he know of the one
hundred and four planets belonging to our solar system, all children of
the sun?Did he know of Jupiter eighty-five thousand miles in diameter,
hundreds of times as large as our earth, turning on his axis at the rate
of twenty-five thousand miles an hour accompanied by four moons making
the tour of his orbit once only in fifty years?Something for Nothing

It is impossible for me to conceive of something being created for
nothing.Nothing, regarded in the light of raw material, is a decided
failure.Neither is it
possible to think of force disconnected with matter.You cannot imagine
matter going back to absolute nothing.Neither can you imagine nothing
being changed into something.You may be eternally damned if you do not
say that you can conceive these things, but you cannot conceive them.Polygamy

Polygamy is just as pure in Utah as it could have been in the promised
land.Love and virtue are the same the whole world around, and justice
is the same in every star.All the languages of the world are not
sufficient to express the filth of polygamy.It makes of man a beast,
of woman a trembling slave.It destroys the fireside, makes virtue an
outcast, takes from human speech its sweetest words, and leaves the
heart a den, where crawl and hiss the slimy serpents of most loathsome
lust.The good family is the unit
of good government.The virtues grow about the holy hearth of home--they
cluster, bloom, and shed their perfume round the fireside where the
one man loves the one woman.Lover--husband--wife--mother--father--child--home!--without these sacred
words the world is but a lair, and men and women merely beasts.The Colonel in the Kitchen--How to Cook a Beefsteak

There ought to be a law making it a crime, punishable by imprisonment,
to fry a beefsteak.Broil it; it is just as easy, and when broiled it
is delicious.Fried beefsteak is not fit for a wild beast.You can broil
even on a stove.Shut the front damper--open the back one, and then take
off a griddle.There will then be a draft down through this opening.Put
on your steak, using a wire broiler, and not a particle of smoke will
touch it, for the reason that the smoke goes down.If you try to broil
it with the front damper open the smoke will rise.For broiling, coal,
even soft coal, makes a better fire than wood.Do not huddle together in a little room
around a red-hot stove, with every window fastened down.Do not live in
this poisoned atmosphere, and then, when one of your children dies, put
a piece in the papers commencing with, "Whereas, it has pleased divine
Providence to remove from our midst--."Have plenty of air, and plenty
of warmth.Do not imagine anything is unhealthy
simply because it is pleasant.Cooking a Fine Art

Cooking is one of the fine arts.Give your wives and daughters things to
cook, and things to cook with, and they will soon become most excellent
cooks.The man whose arteries
and veins are filled with rich blood made of good and well cooked food,
has pluck, courage, endurance and noble impulses.Remember that your
wife should have things to cook with.Scathing Impeachment of Intemperance

Intemperance cuts down youth in its vigor, manhood in its strength, and
age in its weakness.It breaks the father's heart, bereaves the doting
mother, extinguishes natural affections, erases conjugal loves, blots
out filial attachments, blights parental hope, and brings down mourning
age in sorrow to the grave.It produces weakness, not strength;
sickness, not health; death, not life.It makes wives widows; children
orphans; fathers fiends, and all of them paupers and beggars.It feeds
rheumatism, nurses gout, welcomes epidemics, invites cholera, imports
pestilence and embraces consumption.It covers the land with idleness,
misery and crime.It fills your jails, supplies your almshouses and
demands your asylums.It engenders controversies, fosters quarrels, and
cherishes riots.It crowds your penitentiaries and furnishes victims to
your scaffolds.It is the life blood of the gambler, the element of
the burglar, the prop of the highwayman and the support of the midnight
incendiary.It countenances the liar, respects the thief, esteems
the blasphemer.It violates obligations, reverences fraud, and honors
infamy.It defames benevolence, hates love, scorns virtue and slanders
innocence.It incites the father to butcher his helpless offspring,
helps the husband to massacre his wife, and the child to grind the
parricidal ax.It burns up men, consumes women, detests life, curses God,
and despises heaven.It suborns witnesses, nurses perjury, defiles
the jury box, and stains the judicial ermine.It degrades the citizen,
debases the legislator, dishonors statesmen, and disarms the patriot.It
brings shame, not honor; terror, not safety; despair, not hope; misery,
not happiness; and with the malevolence of a fiend, it calmly surveys
its frightful desolation, and unsatisfied with its havoc, it poisons
felicity, kills peace, ruins morals, blights confidence, slays
reputation, and wipes out national honors, then curses the world and
laughs at its ruin.Liberty Defined

The French convention gave the best definition of liberty I have ever
read: "The liberty of one citizen ceases only where the liberty of
another citizen commences."I ask you
to-day to make a declaration of individual independence.And if you are
independent, be just.Allow everybody else to make his declaration of
individual independence.Allow your wife, allow your husband, allow
your children to make theirs.It is a grand thing to be the owner of
yourself.It is a grand thing to protect the rights of others.It is a
sublime thing to be free and just.Free, Honest Thought

I am going to say what little I can to make the American people brave
enough and generous enough and kind enough to give everybody else the
rights they have themselves.Can there ever be any progress in this
world to amount to anything until we have liberty?The thoughts of a man
who is not free are not worth much--not much.A man who thinks with the
club of a creed above his head--a man who thinks casting his eye askance
at the flames of hell, is not apt to have very good thoughts.And for
my part, I would not care to have any status or social position even in
heaven if I had to admit that I never would have been there only I got
scared.When we are frightened we do not think very well.If you want to
get at the honest thoughts of a man he must free.If he is not free you
will not get his honest thought.Ingersoll Prefers Shoemakers to Princes

The other day there came shoemakers, potters, workers in wood and iron,
from Europe, and they were received in the city of New York as though
they had been princes.They had been sent by the great republic of
France to examine into the arts and manufactures of the great republic
of America.They looked a thousand times better to me than the Edward
Alberts and Albert Edwards--the royal vermin, that live on the body
politic.And I would think much more of our government if it would fete
and feast them, instead of wining and dining the imbeciles of a royal
line.I never saw a dignified man that was not after all an
old idiot Dignity is a mask; a dignified man is afraid that you will
know he does not know everything.A man of sense and argument is always
willing to admit what he don't know--why?--because there is so much
that he does know; and that is the first step towards learning
anything--willingness to admit what you don't know, and when you don't
understand a thing, ask--no matter how small and silly it may look to
other people--ask, and after that you know.A man never is in a state of
mind that he can learn until he gets that dignified nonsense out of him.The time is coming when a man will be rated at his real worth, and that
by his brain and heart.We care nothing now about an officer unless he
fills his place.The time will come when no matter how much money a man
has he will not be respected unless he is using it for the benefit of
his fellow-men.Three millions have increased to fifty--thirteen
States to thirty-eight.We have better homes, and more of the
conveniences of life than any other people upon the face of the globe.The farmers of our country live better than did the kings and princes
two hundred years ago--and they have twice as much sense and heart.Remember that the man who acts best his part--who loves
his friends the best--is most willing to help others--truest to the
obligation--who has the best heart--the most feeling--the deepest
sympathies--and who freely gives to others the rights that he claims for
himself, is the true nobleman.We have disfranchised the aristocrats of
the air and have given one country to mankind.Wanted!--More Manliness

I had a thousand times rather have a farm and be independent, than to be
President of the United States, without independence, filled with
doubt and trembling, feeling of the popular pulse, resorting to art and
artifice, inquiring about the wind of opinion, and succeeding at last in
losing my self-respect without gaining the respect of others.Man needs
more manliness, more real independence.This we can do by labor, and in this way we can preserve our
independence.We should try and choose that business or profession the
pursuit of which will give us the most happiness.We can be happy without being rich--without holding office--without
being famous.I am not sure that we can be happy with wealth, with
office, or with fame.Education of Nature

It has been a favorite idea with me that our forefathers were educated
by nature; that they grew grand as the continent upon which they landed;
that the great rivers--the wide plains--the splendid lakes--the lonely
forests--the sublime mountains--that all these things stole into and
became a part of their being, and they grew great as the country in
which they lived.They began to hate the narrow, contracted views of
Europe.The Worker Wearing the Purple

I want to see a workingman have a good house, painted white, grass in
the front yard, carpets on the floor and pictures on the wall.I want to
see him a man feeling that he is a king by the divine right of living in
the Republic.And every man here is just a little bit a king, you know.Every man here is a part of the sovereign power.Every man wears a
little of purple; every man has a little of crown and a little of
sceptre; and every man that will sell his vote for money or be ruled by
prejudice is unfit to be an American citizen.Flowers

Beautify your grounds with plants and flowers and vines.Remember that everything of beauty tends to the elevation of
man.Every little morning-glory whose purple bosom is thrilled with the
amorous kisses of the sun tends to put a blossom in your heart.Do not
judge of the value of everything by the market reports.Every flower
about a house certifies to the refinement of somebody.Every vine,
climbing and blossoming, tells of love and joy.The grave is not a throne, and a corpse is not a king.The living have
a right to control this world.I think a good deal more of to day than
I do of yesterday, and I think more of to-morrow than I do of this day;
because it is nearly gone--that is the way I feel.The time to be happy
is now; the way to be happy is to make somebody else happy and the place
to be happy is here.The School House a Fort

Education is the most radical thing in the world.To teach the alphabet is to inaugurate a revolution.To build a school
house is to construct a fort.We are Getting Free

We are getting free.We are
investigating with the microscope and the telescope.We are digging
into the earth and finding souvenirs of all the ages.We are finding out
something about the laws of health and disease.We are adding years to
the span of human life and we are making the world fit to live in.That is what we are doing, and every man that has an honest thought and
expresses it helps, and every man that tries to keep honest thought from
being expressed is an obstruction and a hindrance.The Solid Rock

I have made up my mind that if there is a God He will be merciful to the
merciful.That He will forgive the forgiving;
upon that rock I stand.That every man should be true to himself, and
that there is no world, no star, in which honesty is a crime; and upon
that rock I stand.An honest man, a good, kind, sweet woman, or a happy
child, has nothing to fear, neither in this world nor the world to come;
and upon that rock I stand.INGERSOLL'S FIVE GOSPELS




408.The Gospel of Cheerfulness

I believe in the gospel of cheerfulness; the gospel of good nature; in
the gospel of good health.Let us pay some attention to our bodies; take
care of our bodies, and our souls will take care of themselves.I believe the time will come when the public thought will be so
great and grand that it will be looked upon as infamous to perpetuate
disease.I believe the time will come when men will not fill the future
with consumption and with insanity.I believe the time will come when
with studying ourselves and understanding the laws of health, we will
say we are under obligations to put the flags of health in the cheeks of
our children.Even if I got to Heaven, and had a harp, I would hate to
look back upon my children and see them diseased, deformed, crazed, all
suffering the penalty of crimes that I had committed.The Gospel of Liberty

And I believe, too, in the gospel of liberty,---of giving to others what
we claim.And I believe there is room everywhere for thought, and
the more liberty you give away the more you will have.In liberty
extravagance is economy.Let us be just, let us be generous to each
other.The Gospel of 'Good Living

I believe in the gospel of good living.You cannot make any God happy by
fasting.Let us have good food, and let us have it well cooked; it is
a thousand times better to know how to cook it than it is to understand
any theology in the world.I
believe in the gospel of good houses; in the gospel of water and soap.The Gospel of Intelligence

I believe in the gospel of intelligence.That is the only lever capable
of raising mankind.I believe in the gospel of intelligence; in the
gospel of education.The school-house is my cathedral; the universe
is my Bible.And no God can put a man into hell in another world who has
made a little heaven in this.God cannot make miserable a man who has
made somebody else happy.God can not hate anybody who is capable of
loving his neighbor.So I believe in this great gospel of generosity.Ah, but they say it won't do.My gospel
of health will prolong life; my gospel of intelligence, my gospel of
loving, my gospel of good-fellowship will cover the world with happy
homes.My doctrine will put carpets upon your floors, pictures upon your
walls.My doctrine will put books upon your shelves, ideas in your mind.My doctrine will relieve the world of the abnormal monsters born of the
ignorance of superstition.My doctrine will give us health, wealth, and
happiness.The Gospel of Justice

I believe in the gospel of justice,--that we must reap what we sow.Smith, and God forgive me,
how does that help Smith?If I by slander cover some poor girl with
the leprosy of some imputed crime, and she withers away like a blighted
flower, and afterwards I get forgiveness, how does that help her?If
there is another world, we have got to settle; no bankruptcy court
there.Among the ancient Jews if you committed a crime you
had to kill a sheep; now they say, "Charge it.For every crime you commit you must answer to yourself and
to the one you injure.And if you have ever clothed another with
unhappiness as with a garment cf pain, you will never be quite as
happy as though you hadn't done that thing.No forgiveness, eternal,
inexorable, everlasting justice--that is what I believe in.And if it goes hard with me, I will stand it.And I will stick to my
logic, and I will bear it like a man.GEMS FROM THE CONTROVERSIAL GASKET

     Latest Utterances of Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll,
     in a Controversy with Judge Jere 8.Black,
     on "The Christian Religion"




413.The Origin of the Controversy

Several months ago, _The North American Review_ asked me to write an
article, saying that it would be published if some one would furnish a
reply.I wrote the article that appeared in the August number, and by
me it was entitled "Is All of the Bible Inspired?"Not until the
article was written did I know who was expected to answer.I make this
explanation for the purpose of dissipating the impression that Mr.To have struck his shield with my lance might
have given birth to the impression that I was somewhat doubtful as to
the correctness of my position.I naturally expected an answer from some
professional theologian, and was surprised to find that a reply had been
written by a "policeman," who imagined that he had answered my arguments
by simply telling me that my statements were false.It is somewhat
unfortunate that in a discussion like this any one should resort to the
slightest personal detraction.The theme is great enough to engage the
highest faculties of the human mind, and in the investigation of such a
subject vituperation is singularly and vulgarly out of place.Arguments
cannot be answered with insults.It is unfortunate that the intellectual
arena should be entered by a "policeman," who has more confidence in
concussion than discussion.Good nature is often
mistaken for virtue, and good health sometimes passes for genius.Anger blows out the lamp of the mind.In the examination of a great and
important question, every one should be serene, slow-pulsed, and calm.Black's reply, feeling that so
grand a subject should not be blown and tainted with malicious words, I
proceed to answer as best I may the arguments he has urged.Of course it is still claimed that we are a Christian people, indebted
to something we call Christianity, for all the progress we have made.There is still a vast difference of opinion as to what Christianity
really is, although many wavering sects have been discussing that
question, with fire and sword through centuries of creed and crime.Every new sect has been denounced at its birth as illegitimate, as
something born out of orthodox wedlock, and that should have been
allowed to perish on the steps where it was found.Summary of Evangelical Belief

Among the evangelical churches there is a substantial agreement
upon what they consider the fundamental truths of the gospel.These
fundamental truths, as I understand them, are:--That there is a personal
God, the creator of the material universe; that he made man of the dust,
and woman from part of the man; that the man and woman were tempted by
the devil; that they were turned out of the garden of Eden; that, about
fifteen hundred years afterward, God's patience having been exhausted by
the wickedness of mankind, He drowned His children, with the exception
of eight persons; that afterward He selected from their descendants
Abraham, and through him the Jewish people; that He gave laws to these
people, and tried to govern them in all things; that He made known His
will in many ways; that He wrought a vast number of miracles; that
He inspired men to write the Bible; that, in the fullness of time, it
having been found impossible to reform mankind, this God came upon earth
as a child born of the Virgin Mary; that He lived in Palestine; that He
preached for about three years, going from place to place, occasionally
raising the dead, curing the blind and the halt; that He was
crucified--for the crime of blasphemy, as the Jews supposed, but, that
as a matter of fact, He was offered as a sacrifice for the sins of
all who might have faith in Him; that He was raised from the dead and
ascended into heaven, where He now is, making intercession for His
followers; that He will forgive the sins of all who believe on Him,
and that those who do not believe will be consigned to the dungeons of
eternal pain.These--(it may be with the addition of the sacraments of
Baptism and the Last Supper)--constitute what is generally known as the
Christian religion.A Profound Change in the World of Thought

A profound change has taken place in the world of thought.The pews are
trying to set themselves somewhat above the pulpit.The layman discusses
theology with the minister, and smiles.Christians excuse themselves
for belonging to the church by denying a part of the creed.The idea
is abroad that they who know the most of nature believe the least about
theology.The sciences are regarded as infidels, and facts as scoffers.Thousands of most excellent people avoid churches, and, with few
exceptions, only those attend prayer meetings who wish to be alone.The
pulpit is losing because the people are rising.The Believer in the Inspiration of the Bible has too Much to Believe

But the believer in the inspiration of the Bible is compelled to declare
that there was a time when slavery was right--when men could buy and
women sell their babes.He is compelled to insist that there was a time
when polygamy was the highest form of virtue; when wars of extermination
were waged with the sword of mercy; when religious toleration was a
crime, and when death was the just penalty for having expressed an
honest thought.He must maintain that Jehovah is just as bad now as he
was four thousand years ago, or that he was just as good then as he is
now, but that human conditions have so changed that slavery, polygamy,
religious persecutions and wars of conquest are now perfectly devilish.Once they were right--once they were commanded by God himself; now, they
are prohibited.There has been such a change in the conditions of man
that, at the present time, the devil is in favor of slavery, polygamy,
religious persecution and wars of conquest.That is to say, the devil
entertains the same opinion to-day that Jehovah held four thousand
years ago, but in the meantime Jehovah has remained exactly the
same--changeless and incapable of change.A Frank Admission

It is most cheerfully admitted that a vast number of people not only
believe these things, but hold them in exceeding reverence, and imagine
them to be of the utmost importance to mankind.They regard the Bible as
the only light that God has given for the guidance of His children; that
it is the one star in nature's sky--the foundation of all morality, of
all law, of all order, and of all individual and national progress.They
regard it as the only means we have for ascertaining the will of God,
the origin of man, and the destiny of the soul.The mistake has hindered in countless ways the civilization of
man.The Bible Should be Better than any other Book

In all ages of which any record has been preserved, there have been
those who gave their ideas of justice, charity, liberty, love, and
law.Now, if the Bible is really the work of God, it should contain the
grandest and sublimest truths.It should, in all respects, excel the
works of man.Within that book should be found the best and loftiest
definitions of justice; the truest conceptions of human liberty; the
clearest outlines of duty; the tenderest, the highest, and the noblest
thoughts,--not that the human mind has produced, but that the human mind
is capable of receiving.Upon every page should be found the luminous
evidence of its divine origin.Unless it contains grander and more
wonderful things than man has written, we are not only justified in
saying, but we are compelled to say, that it was written by no being
superior to man.A Serious Charge

The Bible has been the fortress and the defense of nearly every crime.No civilized country could re-enact its laws.And in many respects its
moral code is abhorrent to every good and tender man.It is admitted,
however, that many of its precepts are pure, that many of its laws are
wise and just, and that many of its statements are absolutely true.If the Bible is Not Verbally Inspired, What Then?It may be said that it is unfair to call attention to certain bad things
in the Bible, while the good are not so much as mentioned.To this it
may be replied that a divine being would not put bad things in a book.Certainly a being of infinite intelligence, power, and goodness could
never fall below the ideal of "depraved and barbarous" man.It will not
do, after we find that the Bible upholds what we now call crimes, to say
that it is not verbally inspired.If the words are not inspired, what
is?It may be said that the thoughts are inspired.But this would
include only the thoughts expressed without words.If the ideas are
inspired, they must be contained in and expressed only by inspired
words; that is to say, the arrangement of the words, with relation to
each other, must have been inspired.A Hindu Example

Suppose that we should now discover a Hindu book of equal antiquity with
the Old Testament, containing a defense of slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution, would we regard it as evidence
that the writers were inspired by an infinitely wise and merciful God?A Test Fairly Applied

Suppose we knew that after "inspired" men had finished the Bible, the
devil had got possession of it and wrote a few passages, what part of
the sacred Scriptures would Christians now pick out as being probably
his work?Which of the following passages would naturally be selected
as having been written by the devil--"Love thy neighbor as thyself," or
"Kill all the males among the little ones, and kill every woman; but all
the women children keep alive for yourselves?"It will hardly be claimed at this day, that the passages in the
Bible upholding slavery, polygamy, war, and religious persecution are
evidences of the inspiration of that book.Suppose that there had been
nothing in the Old Testament upholding these crimes would any modern
Christian suspect that it was not inspired on account of that omission?Suppose that there had been nothing in the Old Testament but laws in
favor of these crimes, would any intelligent Christian now contend that
it was the work of the true God?Proofs of Civilization

We know that there was a time in the history of almost every nation when
slavery, polygamy, and wars of extermination were regarded as divine
institutions; when women were looked upon as beasts of burden, and when,
among some people, it was considered the duty of the husband to murder
the wife for differing with him on the subject of religion.Nations that
entertain these views to-day are regarded as savage, and, probably, with
the exception of the South Sea islanders, the Feejees, some citizens
of Delaware, and a few tribes in Central Africa, no human beings can be
found degraded enough to agree upon these subjects with the Jehovah of
the ancient Jews.The only evidence we have, or can have, that a
nation has ceased to be savage is the fact that it has abandoned these
doctrines.To every one, except the theologian, it is perfectly easy to
account for the mistakes, atrocities, and crimes of the past, by
saying that civilization is a slow and painful growth; that the moral
perceptions are cultivated through ages of tyranny, of want, of crime,
and of heroism; that it requires centuries for man to put out the eyes
of self and hold in lofty and in equal poise the scales of justice;
that conscience is born of suffering; that mercy is the child of the
imagination--of the power to put oneself in the sufferers place, and
that man advances only as he becomes acquainted with his surroundings,
with the mutual obligations of life, and learns to take advantage of the
forces of nature.A Persian Gospel

Do not misunderstand me.My position is that the cruel passages in
the Old Testament are not inspired; that slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution always have been, are, and
forever will be, abhorred and cursed by the honest, virtuous, and the
loving; that the innocent cannot justly suffer for the guilty, and that
vicarious vice and vicarious virtue are equally absurd; that eternal
punishment is eternal revenge; that only the natural can happen; that
miracles prove the dishonesty of the few and the credulity of the many;
and that, according to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, salvation does not
depend upon belief, nor the atonement, nor a "second birth," but that
these gospels are in exact harmony with the declaration of the great
Persian: "Taking the first footstep with the good thought, the second
with the good word, and the third with the good deed, I entered
paradise."The dogmas of the past no longer reach the level of the
highest thought, nor satisfy the hunger of the heart.While dusty
faiths, embalmed and sepulchered in ancient texts, remain the same,
the sympathies of men enlarge; the brain no longer kills its young; the
happy lips give liberty to honest thoughts; the mental firmament expands
and lifts; the broken clouds drift by; the hideous dreams, the foul,
misshapen children of the monstrous night, dissolve and fade.Man the Author of all Books

So far as we know, man is the author of all books.If a book had been
found on the earth by the first man, he might have regarded it as the
work of God; but as men were here a good while before any books were
found, and as man has produced a great many books, the probability is
that the Bible is no exception.God and Brahma

Can we believe that God ever said of any: "Let his children be
fatherless and his wife a widow; let his children be continually
vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also out of their desolate
places; let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the stranger
spoil his labor, let there be none to extend mercy unto him, neither let
there be any to favor his fatherless children."If he ever said these
words, surely he had never heard this line, this strain of music, from
the Hindu: "Sweet is the lute to those who have not heard the prattle of
their own children."Jehovah, "from the clouds and darkness of Sinai,"
said to the Jews: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me.... Thou
shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy
God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me."Contrast this with the words put by the Hindu in the mouth of Brahma:
"I am the same to all mankind.They who honestly serve other gods,
involuntarily worship me.I am he who partaketh of all worship, and I
am the reward of all worshipers."The first, a
dungeon where crawl the things begot of jealous slime; the other, great
as the domed firmament inlaid with suns.Matthew, Mark, and Luke

And I here take occasion to say, that with most of the teachings of the
gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke I most heartily agree.The miraculous
parts must, of course, be thrown aside.I admit that the necessity of
belief, the atonement, and the scheme of salvation are all set forth
in the Gospel of John,--a gospel, in my opinion, not written until long
after the others.Christianity Takes no Step in Advance

All the languages of the world have not words of horror enough to
paint the agonies of man when the church had power.Tiberius, Caligula,
Claudius, Nero, Domitian, and Commodus were not as cruel, false,
and base as many of the Christian Popes.Opposite the names of these
imperial criminals write John the XII., Leo the VIII., Boniface the VII.,
Benedict the IX., Innocent the III., and Alexander the VI.Was it under
these pontiffs that the "church penetrated the moral darkness like a
new sun," and covered the globe with institutions of mercy?Rome was far
better when Pagan than when Catholic.It was better to allow gladiators
and criminals to fight than to burn honest men.The greatest of Romans
denounced the cruelties of the arena.Seneca condemned the combats even
of wild beasts.He was tender enough to say that "we should have a bond
of sympathy for all sentiment beings, knowing that only the depraved
and base take pleasure in the sight of blood and suffering."Aurelius
compelled the gladiators to fight with blunted swords.Roman lawyers
declared that all men are by nature free and equal.Woman, under Pagan
rule in Rome, become as free as man.Zeno, long before the birth of
Christ, taught that virtue alone establishes a difference between men.We know that the Civil Law is the foundation of our codes.We know that
fragments of Greek and Roman art--a few manuscripts saved from Christian
destruction, some inventions and discoveries of the Moors--were the
seeds of modern civilization.Christianity, for a thousand years,
taught memory to forget and reason to believe.Not one step was taken in
advance.Over the manuscripts of philosophers and poets, priests, with
their ignorant tongues thrust out, devoutly scrawled the forgeries of
faith.Christianity a Mixture of Good and Evil

Mr.Black attributes to me the following expression: "Christianity is
pernicious in its moral effect, darkens the mind, narrows the soul,
arrests the progress of human society, and hinders civilization."Strange, that he is only able to answer what I did
not say.I endeavored to show that the passages in the Old Testament
upholding slavery, polygamy, wars of extermination, and religious
intolerance had filled the world with blood and crime.I admitted
that there are many wise and good things in the Old Testament.I also
insisted that the doctrine of the atonement--that is to say, of moral
bankruptcy--the idea that a certain belief is necessary to salvation,
and the frightful dogma of eternal pain, had narrowed the soul, had
darkened the mind, and had arrested the progress of human society.Like
other religions, Christianity is a mixture of good and evil.The church
has made more orphans than it has fed.It has never built asylums enough
to hold the insane of its own making.Jehovah, Epictetus and Cicero

If the Bible is really inspired, Jehovah commanded the Jewish people to
buy the children of the strangers that sojourned among them, and ordered
that the children thus bought should be an inheritance for the children
of the Jews, and that they should be bondmen and bondwomen forever.Yet
Epictetus, a man to whom no revelation was ever made, a man whose soul
followed only the light of nature, and who had never heard of the Jewish
God, was great enough to say: "Will you not remember that your servants
are by nature your brothers, the children of God?In saying that you
have bought them, you look down on the earth and into the pit, on the
wretched law of men long since dead,--but you see not the laws of the
Gods."We find that Jehovah, speaking to his chosen people, assured them
that their bondmen and bondmaids must be "of the heathen that were
round about them.""Of them," said Jehovah, "shall ye buy bondmen
and bondmaids."And yet Cicero, a pagan, Cicero, who had never been
enlightened by reading the Old Testament, had the moral grandeur to
declare: "They who say that we should love our fellow-citizens, but not
foreigners, destroy the universal brotherhood of mankind, with which
benevolence and justice would perish forever."The Atonement

In countless ways the Christian world has endeavored, for nearly two
thousand years, to explain the atonement, and every effort has ended in
an an mission that it cannot be understood, and a declaration that it
must be believed.Is it not immoral to teach that man can sin, that he
can harden his heart and pollute his soul, and that, by repenting
and believing something that he does not comprehend, he can avoid the
consequences of his crimes?Has the promise and hope of forgiveness ever
prevented the commission of a sin?Should men be taught that sin gives
happiness here; that they ought to bear the evils of a virtuous life in
this world for the sake of joy in the next; that they can repent between
the last sin and the last breath; that after repentance every stain
of the soul is washed away by the innocent blood of another; that the
serpent of regret will not hiss in the ear of memory; that the saved
will not even pity the victims of their own crimes; that the goodness
of another can be transferred to them; and that sins forgiven cease to
affect the unhappy wretches sinned against?Sin as a Debt

The Church says that the sinner is in debt to God, and that the
obligation is discharged by the Saviour.The best that can possibly be
said of such a transaction is, that the debt is transferred, not paid.The truth is, that a sinner is in debt to the person he has injured.If a man injures his neighbor, it is not enough for him to get the
forgiveness of God, but he must have the forgiveness of his neighbor.If a man puts his hand in the fire and God forgives him, his hand will
smart exactly the same.You must, after all, reap what you sow.No god
can give you wheat when you sow tares, and no devil can give you tares
when you sow wheat.The Logic of the Coffin

As to the doctrine of the atonement, Mr.Black has nothing to offer
except the barren statement that it is believed by the wisest and the
best.A Mohammedan, speaking in Constantinople, will say the same of the
Koran.A Brahman, in a Hindu temple, will make the same remark, and so
will the American Indian, when he endeavors to enforce something upon
the young of his tribe.He will say: "The best, the greatest of our
tribe have believed in this."This is the argument of the cemetery, the
philosophy of epitaphs, the logic of the coffin.We are the greatest and
wisest and most virtuous of mankind?This statement, that it has been
believed by the best, is made in connection with an admission that it
cannot be fathomed by the wisest.It is not claimed that a thing is
necessarily false because it is not understood, but I do claim that
it is not necessarily true because it cannot be comprehended.I still
insist that "the plan of redemption," as usually preached, is absurd,
unjust, and immoral.Judas Iscariot

For nearly two thousand years Judas Iscariot has been execrated by
mankind; and yet, if the doctrine of the atonement is true, upon his
treachery hung the plan of salvation.Suppose Judas had known of this
plan--known that he was selected by Christ for that very purpose, that
Christ was depending on him.And suppose that he also knew that only
by betraying Christ could he save either himself or others; what ought
Judas to have done?Are you willing to rely upon an argument that
justifies the treachery of that wretch?The Standard of Right

According to Mr.Black, the man who does not believe in a supreme being
acknowledges no standard of right and wrong in this world, and therefore
can have no theory of rewards and punishments in the next.Is it
possible that only those who believe in the God who persecuted for
opinion's sake have any standard of right and wrong?Were the greatest
men of all antiquity without this standard?In the eyes of intelligent
men of Greece and Rome, were all deeds, whether good or evil, morally
alike?Is it necessary to believe in the existence of an infinite
intelligence before you can have any standard of right and wrong?Is it
possible that a being cannot be just or virtuous unless he believes in
some being infinitely superior to himself?If this doctrine be true, how
can God be just or virtuous?Does He believe in some being superior to
himself?If man were incapable of suffering, if man could not
feel pain, the word "conscience" never would have passed his lips.The
man who puts himself in the place of another, whose imagination has been
cultivated to the point of feeling the agonies suffered by another, is
the man of conscience.Black says, "We have neither jurisdiction or capacity to rejudge
the justice of God."In other words, we have no right to think upon
this subject, no right to examine the questions most vitally affecting
human-kind.We are simply to accept the ignorant statements of barbarian
dead.This question cannot be settled by saying that "it would be a
mere waste of time and space to enumerate the proofs which show that the
universe was created by a pre-existent and self-conscious being."The
time and space should have been "wasted," and the proofs should have
been enumerated.These "proofs" are what the wisest and greatest are
trying to find.It cares nothing
for the opinions of the "great," nothing for the prejudices of the many,
and least of all, for the superstitions of the dead.In the world of
science--a fact is a legal tender.Assertions and miracles are base and
spurious coins.We have the right to rejudge the justice even of a god.No one should throw away his reason--the fruit of all experience.It is
the intellectual capital of the soul, the only light, the only guide,
and without it the brain becomes the palace of an idiot king, attended
by a retinue of thieves and hypocrites.The Liberty of the Bible

This is the religious liberty of the Bible.If you had lived in
Palestine, and if the wife of your bosom, dearer to you than your
own soul, had said: "I like the religion of India better than that of
Palestine," it would have been your duty to kill her."Your eye must not
pity her, your hand must be first upon her, and afterwards the hand of
all the people."If she had said: "Let us worship the sun--the sun that
clothes the earth in garments of green--the sun, the great fireside of
the world--the sun that covers the hills and valleys with flowers--that
gave me your face, and made it possible for me to look into the eyes
of my babe,--let us worship the sun," it was your duty to kill her.You
must throw the first stone, and when against her bosom--a bosom filled
with love for you--you had thrown the jagged and cruel rock, and had
seen the red stream of her life oozing from the dumb lips of death,
you could then look up and receive the congratulations of the God whose
commandment you had obeyed.Is it possible that a being of infinite
mercy ordered a husband to kill his wife for the crime of having
expressed, an opinion on the subject of religion?Has there been found
upon the records of the savage world anything more perfectly fiendish
than this commandment of Jehovah?This is justified on the ground that
"blasphemy was a breach of political allegiance, and idolatry an act of
overt treason."We can understand how a human king stands in need of the
service of his people.We can understand how the desertion of any of
his soldiers weakens his army; but were the king infinite in power,
his strength would still remain the same, and under no conceivable
circumstances could the enemy triumph.Slavery in Heaven

According to Mr.Black, there will be slavery in Heaven, and fast by
the throne of God will be the auction-block, and the streets of the New
Jerusalem will be adorned with the whipping-post, while the music of
the harp will be supplemented by the crack of the driver's whip.Black, "incorporate him into his family,
tame him, teach him to think, and give him a knowledge of the true
principles of human liberty and government, he would confer upon him a
most beneficent boon."Black is too late with his protest against
the freedom of his fellow-men.Liberty is making the tour of the world.Russia has emancipated her serfs; the slave trade is prosecuted only
by thieves and pirates; Spain feels upon her cheek the burning blush
of shame; Brazil, with proud and happy eyes, is looking for the dawn of
freedom's day; the people of the South rejoice that slavery is no more,
and every good and honest man (excepting Mr.Black) of every land and
clime hopes that the limbs of men will never feel again the weary weight
of chains.Jehovah Breaking His Own Laws

A very curious thing about these Commandments is that their supposed
author violated nearly every one.From Sinai, according to the account,
He said: "Thou shalt not kill," and yet He ordered the murder of
millions; "Thou shalt not commit adultery," and He gave captured maidens
to gratify the lust of captors; "Thou shalt not steal," and yet He gave
to Jewish marauders the flocks and herds of others; "Thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's house, nor his wife," and yet He allowed His chosen
people to destroy the homes of neighbors and to steal their wives;
"Honor thy father and mother," and yet this same God had thousands of
fathers butchered, and with the sword of war killed children yet unborn;
"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," and yet
He sent abroad "lying spirits" to deceive His own prophets, and in a
hundred ways paid tribute to deceit.So far as we know, Jehovah kept
only one of these Commandments--He worshiped no other god.I know as little as anyone else about the "pla" of the universe; and as
to the "design," I know just as little.It will not do to say that the
universe was designed, and therefore there must be a designer.There
must first be proof that it was "designed."It will not do to say that
the universe has a "plan," and then assert that there must have been an
infinite maker.The idea that a design must have a beginning, and that a
designer need not, is a simple expression of human ignorance.We find
a watch, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a thing must have had a
maker."We find the watchmaker, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a
thing as man must have had a maker."We find God and we then say: "He is
so wonderful that he must _not_ have had a maker."In other words, all
things a little wonderful must have been created, but it is possible for
something to be so wonderful that it always existed.One would suppose
that just as the wonder increased the necessity for a creator increased,
because it is the wonder of the thing that suggests the idea of
creation.Is it possible that a designer exists from all eternity
without design?Was there no design in having an infinite designer?For
me, it is hard to see the plan or design in earthquakes and pestilences.It is somewhat difficult to discern the design or the benevolence in so
making the world that billions of animals live only on the agonies of
others.The justice of God is not visible to me in the history of this
world.When I think of the suffering and death, of the poverty and
crime, of the cruelty and malice, of the heartlessness of this "design"
and "plan," where beak and claw and tooth tear and rend the quivering
flesh of weakness and despair, I cannot convince myself that it is the
result of infinite wisdom, benevolence, and justice.What we Know of the Infinite

Of course, upon a question like this, nothing can be absolutely known.We live on an atom called Earth, and what we know of the infinite is
almost infinitely limited; but, little as we know, all have an equal
right to give their honest thought.Life is a shadowy, strange,
and winding road on which we travel for a little way--a few short
steps--just from the cradle, with its lullaby of love, to the low and
quiet wayside inn, where all at last must sleep, and where the only
salutation is--Good-night.The Universe Self-Existent

The universe, according to my idea, is, always was, and forever will
be.It did not "come into being;" it is the one eternal being--the only
thing that ever did, does, or can exist.We know nothing of what we call the laws of Nature except as we gather
the idea of law from the uniformity of phenomena springing from like
conditions.To make myself clear: Water always runs down hill.The
theist says that this happens because there is behind the phenomenon an
active law.As a matter of fact law is this side of the phenomenon.Law
does not cause the phenomenon, but the phenomenon causes the idea of law
in our minds, and this idea is produced from the fact that under like
circumstances the same phenomena always happens.Black probably
thinks that the difference in the weight of rocks and clouds was created
by law; that parallel lines fail to imite only because it is illegal;
that diameter and circumference could have been so made that it would
be a greater distance across than around a circle, that a straight line
could inclose a triangle if not prevented by law, and that a little
legislation could make it possible for two bodies to occupy the same
space at the same time.It seems to me that law can not be the cause of
phenomena, but it is an effect produced in our minds by their succession
and resemblance.To put a God back of the universe compels us to admit
that there was a time when nothing existed except this God; that this
God had lived from eternity in an infinite vacuum and in an absolute
idleness.The mind of every thoughtful man is forced to one of these two
conclusions, either that the universe is self-existent or that it
was created by a self-existent being.To my mied there are far more
difficulties in the second hypothesis than in the first.Jehovah's Promise Broken

If Jehovah was in fact God, He knew the end from the beginning.He knew
that his Bible would be a breastwork behind which tyranny and hypocrisy
would crouch; that it would be quoted by tyrants; that it would be the
defense of robbers called kings and of hypocrites called priests.He
knew that He had taught the Jewish people but little of importance.He
knew that He found them free and left them captives.He knew that He
had never fulfilled the promises made to them.He knew that while other
nations had advanced in art and science his chosen people were savage
still.He promised them the world, and gave them a desert.He promised
them liberty, and He made them slaves.He promised them victory, and He
gave them defeat.He said they should be kings, and He made them
serfs.He promised them universal empire, and gave them exile.When one
finishes the Old Testament, he is compelled to say: Nothing can add to
the misery of a nation whose King is Jehovah!Character Bather than Creed

For a thousand years the torch of progress was extinguished in the blood
of Christ, and His disciples, moved by ignorant zeal, by insane, cruel
creeds, destroyed with flame and sword a hundred millions of their
fellow-men.But if cathedrals had been
universities--if dungeons of the Inquisition had been laboratories--if
Christians had believed in character instead of creed--if they had taken
from the Bible all the good and thrown away the wicked and absurd--if
domes of temples had been observatories--if priests had been
philosophers--if missionaries had taught the useful arts--if astrology
had been astronomy--if the black art had been chemistry--if superstition
had been science--if religion had been humanity--it would have been a
heaven filled with love, with liberty, and joy.Mohammed the Prophet of God

Mohammed was a poor man, a driver of camels.He was without education,
without influence, and without wealth, and yet in a few years he
consolidated thousands of tribes, and millions of men confess that there
is "one God, and Mohammed is his prophet."His success was a thousand
times greater during his life than that of Christ.He was not crucified;
he was a conqueror."Of all men, he exercised the greatest influence
upon the human race."Never in the world's history did a religion
spread with the rapidity of his.It burst like a storm over the fairest
portions of the globe.Black is right in his position that
rapidity is secured only by the direct aid of the Divine Being,
then Mohammed was most certainly the prophet of God.As to wars of
extermination and slavery, Mohammed agreed with Mr.Black, and upon
polygamy with Jehovah.As to religious toleration, he was great enough
to say that "men holding to any form of faith might be saved, provided
they were virtuous."In this he was far in advance both of Jehovah and
Mr.Wanted!--A Little More Legislation

We are informed by Mr.Black that "polygamy is neither commanded or
prohibited in the Old Testament--that it is only discouraged."It seems
to me that a little legislation on that subject might have tended to its
"discouragement."Black assures us "consists of certain immutable rules to govern the
conduct of all men at all times and at all places in their private and
personal relations with others," not one word is found on the subject of
polygamy.There is nothing "discouraging" in the Ten Commandments, nor
in the records of any conversation Jehovah is claimed to have had with
Moses upon Sinai.The life of Abraham, the story of Jacob and Laban,
the duty of a brother to be the husband of the widow of his deceased
brother, the life of David, taken in connection with the practice of
one who is claimed to have been the wisest of men--all these things are
probably relied on to show that polygamy was at least "discouraged."Certainly Jehovah had time to instruct Moses as to the infamy of
polygamy.He could have spared a few moments from a description of
patterns of tongs and basins for a subject so important as this.A
few-words in favor of the one wife and one husband--in favor of the
virtuous and loving home--might have taken the place of instructions
as to cutting the garments of priests and fashioning candlesticks and
ounces of gold.If he had left out simply the order that rams' skins
should be dyed red, and in its place had said, "A man shall have but one
wife, and the wife but one husband," how much better it would have been.Again, it is urged that "the acceptance of Christianity by a large
portion of the generation contemporary with its Founder and His
Apostles, was under the circumstances, an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."If this is true,
then "the acceptance of Buddhism by a large portion of the generation
contemporary with its Founder was an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."The same could
be said of Mohammedanism, and, in fact, of every religion that has
ever benefited or cursed this world.This argument, when reduced to its
simplest form, is this: All that succeeds is inspired.The Morality in Christianity

The morality in Christianity has never opposed the freedom of thought.It has never put, nor tended to put, a chain on a human mind, nor a
manacle on a human limb; but the doctrines distinctively Christian--the
necessity of believing a certain thing; the idea that eternal punishment
awaited him who failed to believe; the idea that the innocent can suffer
for the guilty--these things have |opposed, and for a thousand years
substantially destroyed the freedom of the human mind.All religions
have, with ceremony, magic, and mystery, deformed, darkened, and
corrupted, the soul.Around the sturdy oaks of morality have grown and
clung the parasitic, poisonous vines of the miraculous and monstrous.Irenaeus assures us that all Christians possessed the power of
working miracles; that they prophesied, cast out devils, healed the
sick, and even raised the dead.Epiphanius asserts that some rivers
and fountains were annually transmuted into wine, in attestation of the
miracle of Cana, adding that he himself had drunk of these fountains.Augustine declares that one was told in a dream where the bones of
St.Stephen were buried and the bones were thus discovered and brought
to Hippo, and that they raised five dead persons to life, and that in
two years seventy miracles were performed with these relics.Justin
Martyr states that God once sent some angels to guard the human race,
that these angels fell in love with the daughters of men, and became the
fathers of innumerable devils.For hundreds of years miracles were
about the only things that happened.They were wrought by thousands of
Christians, and testified to by millions.The saints and martyrs, the
best and greatest, were the witnesses and workers of wonders.Even
heretics, with the assistance of the devil, could suspend the "laws
of nature."Must we believe these wonderful accounts because they were
written by "good men," by Christians," who made their statements in the
presence and expectation of death"?The truth is that these "good men"
were mistaken.They fed their minds on prodigies, and their imaginations
feasted on effects without causes.Doubts were regarded as "rude disturbers of the congregation."Credulity
and sanctity walked hand in hand.As the philosophy of the ancients was rendered almost worthless by the
credulity of the common people, so the proverbs of Christ, his religion
of forgiveness, his creed of kindness, were lost in the mist of miracle
and the darkness of superstition.The Honor Due to Christ

For the man Christ--for the reformer who loved his fellow-men--for the
man who believed in an Infinite Father, who would shield the innocent
and protect the just--for the martyr who expected to be rescued from the
cruel cross, and who at last, finding that his rope was dust, cried out
in the gathering gloom of death; "My God!--for that great and suffering man, mistaken though he was, I have
the highest admiration and respect.That man did not, as I believe,
claim a miraculous origin; he did not pretend to heal the sick nor raise
the dead.He claimed simply to be a man, and taught his fellow-men
that love is stronger far than hate.His life was written by reverent
ignorance.Loving credulity belittled his career with feats of jugglery
and magic art, and priests wishing to persecute and slay, put in his
mouth the words of hatred and revenge.The theological Christ is the
impossible union of the human and divine--man with the attributes of
God, and God with the limitations and weakness of man.Christianity has no Monopoly in Morals

The morality of the world is not distinctively Christian.Zoroaster,
Gautama, Mohammed, Confucius, Christ, and, in fact, all founders of
religions, have said to their disciples: You must not steal; You must
not murder; You must not bear false witness; You must discharge your
obligations.Christianity is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the
miraculous origin of Jesus Christ, his crucifixion, his resurrection,
his ascension, the inspiration of the Bible, the doctrine of the
atonement, and the necessity of belief.Buddhism is the ordinary moral
code, _plus_ the miraculous illumination of Buddha, the performance of
certain ceremonies, a belief in the transmigration of the soul, and
in the final absorption of the human by the infinite.The religion of
Mohammed is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the belief that Mohammed
was the prophet of God, total abstinence from the use of intoxicating
drinks, a harem for the faithful here and hereafter, ablutions, prayers,
alms, pilgrimages, and fasts.Old Age in Superstition's Lap

And here I take occasion to thank Mr.Black for having admitted that
Jehovah gave no commandment against the practice of polygamy, that he
established slavery, waged wars of extermination, and persecuted for
opinions' sake even unto death, Most theologians endeavor to putty,
patch, and paint the wretched record of inspired crime, but Mr.Black
has been bold enough and honest enough to admit the truth.In this age
of fact and demonstration it is refreshing to find a man who believes
so thoroughly in the monstrous and miraculous, the impossible and
immoral--who still clings lovingly to the legends of the bib and
rattle--who through the bitter experiences of a wicked world has kept
the credulity of the cradle, and finds comfort and joy in thinking about
the Garden of Eden, the subtile serpent, the flood, and Babel's tower,
stopped by the jargon of a thousand tongues--who reads with happy eyes
the story of the burning brimstone storm that fell upon the cities
of the plain, and smilingly explains the transformation of the
retrospective Mrs.Lot--who laughs at Egypt's plagues and Pharaoh's
whelmed and drowning hosts--eats manna with the wandering Jews, warms
himself at the burning bush, sees Korah's company by the hungry earth
devoured, claps his wrinkled hands with glee above the heathens'
butchered babes, and longingly looks back to the patriarchal days of
concubines and slaves.How touching when the learned and wise crawl back
in cribs and ask to hear the rhymes and fables once again!How charming
in these hard and scientific times to see old age in Superstition's lap,
with eager lips upon her withered breast!Ararat in Chicago

A little while ago, in the city of Chicago, a gentleman addressed a
number of Sunday-school children.In his address he stated that some
people were wicked enough to deny the story of the deluge; that he was
a traveler; that he had been to the top of Mount Ararat, and had brought
with him a stone from that sacred locality.The children were then
invited to form in procession and walk by the pulpit, for the purpose of
seeing this wonderful stone.After they had looked at it, the lecturer
said: "Now, children, if you ever hear anybody deny the story of the
deluge, or say that the ark did not rest on Mount Ararat, you can tell
them that you know better, because you have seen with your own eyes a
stone from that very mountain."How Gods and Devils are Made

It was supposed that God demanded worship; that he loved to be
flattered; that he delighted in sacrifice; that nothing made him happier
than to see ignorant faith upon its knees; that above all things he
hated and despised doubters and heretics, and regarded investigation as
rebellion.Each community felt it a duty to see that the enemies of God
were converted or killed.To allow a heretic to live in peace was
to invite the wrath of God.Every public evil--every misfortune--was
accounted for by something the community had permitted or done.When
epidemics appeared, brought by ignorance and welcomed by filth, the
heretic was brought out and sacrificed to appease the anger of God.By putting intention behind what man called good, God was produced.By
putting intention behind what man called bad, the Devil was created.Leave this "intention" out, and gods and devils fade away.If not a
human being existed, the sun would continue to shine, and tempest now
and then would devastate the earth; the rain would fall in pleasant
showers; violets would spread their velvet bosoms to the sun, the
earthquake would devour, birds would sing, and daisies bloom, and
roses blush, and volcanoes fill the heavens with their lurid glare; the
procession of the seasons would not be broken, and the stars would shine
as serenely as though the world were filled with loving hearts and happy
homes.The Romance of Figures

How long, according to the universal benevolence of the New Testament,
can a man be reasonably punished in the next world for failing to
believe something unreasonable in this?Can it be possible that any
punishment can endure forever?Suppose that every flake of snow that
ever fell was a figure nine, and that the first flake was multiplied by
the second, and that product by the third, and so on to the last flake.And then suppose that this total should be multiplied by every drop of
rain that ever fell, calling each drop a figure nine; and that total by
each blade of grass that ever helped to weave a carpet for the earth,
calling each blade a figure nine; and that again by every grain of sand
on every shore, so that the grand total would make a line of nines so
long that it would require millions upon millions of years for light,
traveling at the rate of one hundred and eighty-five thousand miles per
second, to reach the end.And suppose, further, that each unit in this
almost infinite total, stood for billions of ages--still that vast and
almost endless time, measured by all the years beyond, is as one flake,
one drop, one leaf, one blade, one grain, compared with all the flakes,
and drops, and leaves, and blades and grains.Upon love's breast the
Church has placed the eternal asp.And yet, in the same book in which is
taught this most infamous of doctrines, we are assured that "The Lord is
good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works."God and Zeno

If the Bible is inspired, Jehovah, God of all worlds, actually said:
"And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die under
his hand, he shall be surely punished; notwithstanding, if he continue
a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money."And yet
Zeno, founder of the Stoics, centuries before Christ was born, insisted
that no man could be the owner of another, and that the title was bad,
whether the slave had become so by conquest, or by purchase.Jehovah,
ordered a Jewish general to make war, and gave, among others, this
command: "When the Lord thy God shall drive them before thee, thou shalt
smite them and utterly destroy them."And yet Epictetus, whom we have
already quoted, gave this marvelous rule for the guidance of human
conduct: "Live with thy inferiors as thou wouldst have thy superiors
live with thee."If Christ was in fact God, he knew all the future.Before him, like a
panorama, moved the history yet to be.He knew exactly how his words
would be interpreted.He knew what crimes, what horrors, what infamies,
would be committed in his name.He knew that the fires of persecution
would climb around the limbs of countless martyrs.He knew that brave
men would languish in dungeons, in darkness, filled with pain; that the
church would use instruments of torture, that his followers would appeal
to whip and chain.He must have seen the horizon of the future red with
the flames of the _auto da fe_.He knew all the creeds that would spring
like poison fungi from every text.He saw the sects waging war against
each other.He saw thousands of men, under the orders of priests,
building dungeons for their fellow-men.He heard the groans, saw the faces white with agony, the tears,
the blood--heard the shrieks and sobs of all the moaning, martyred
multitudes.He knew that commentaries would be written on his words with
swords, to be read by the light of fagots.He knew that the Inquisition
would be born of teachings attributed to him.He saw all the
interpolations and falsehoods that hypocrisy would write and tell.He
knew that above these fields of death, these dungeons, these burnings,
for a thousand years would float the dripping banner of the cross.He
knew that in his name his followers would trade in human flesh, that
cradles would be robbed and women's breasts unbabed for gold;--and yet
he died with voiceless lips.Why did he not
tell his disciples, and through them the world, that man should not
persecute, for opinion's sake, his fellow-man?Why did he not cry, You
shall not persecute in my name; you shall not burn and torment those who
differ from you in creed?Why did he not plainly say, I am the Son of
God?Why did he not explain the doctrine of the trinity?Why did he not
tell the manner of baptism that was pleasing to him?Why did he not say
something positive, definite, and satisfactory about another world?Why
did he not turn the tear-stained hope of heaven to the glad knowledge
of another life?Why did he go dumbly to his death, leaving the world to
misery and to doubt?The Philosophy of Action

Consequences determine the quality of an action.If consequences are
good, so is the action.If actions had no consequences, they would be
neither good nor bad.Man did not get his knowledge of the consequences
of actions from God, but from experience and reason.If man can, by
actual experiment, discover the right and wrong of actions, is it not
utterly illogical to declare that they who do not believe in God can
have no standard of right and wrong?Consequences are the standard by
which actions are judged.They are the children that testify as to the
real character of their parents.God or no God, larceny is the enemy of
industry--industry is the mother of prosperity--prosperity is a good,
and therefore larceny is an evil.God or no God, murder is a crime.There has always been a law against larceny, because the laborer wishes
to enjoy the fruit of his toil.As long as men object to being killed,
murder will be illegal.I have insisted, and I still insist, that it is still impossible for
a finite man to commit a crime deserving infinite punishment; and upon
this subject Mr.Black admits that "no revelation has lifted the veil
between time and eternity;" and, consequently, neither the priest nor
the "policeman" knows anything with certainty regarding another world.He simply insists that "in shadowy figures we are warned that a very
marked distinction will be made between the good and bad in the next
world."There is "a very marked distinction" in this; but there is this
rainbow in the darkest human cloud: The worst have hope of reform.All I
insist is, if there is another life, the basest soul that finds its way
to that dark or radiant shore will have the everlasting chance of
doing right.Nothing but the most cruel ignorance, the most heartless
superstition, the most ignorant theology, ever imagined that the
few days of human life spent here, surrounded by mists and clouds of
darkness, blown over life's sea by storms and tempests of passion, fixed
for all eternity the condition of the human race.If this doctrine be
true, this life is but a net, in which Jehovah catches souls for hell.We are told that "there is no good reason to doubt that the statements
of the Evangelists, as we have them now, are genuine."The fact is, no
one knows who made the "statements of the Evangelists."There are three
important manuscripts upon which the Christian world relies."The first
appeared in the catalogue of the Vatican, in 1475.Of the New, it contains the four gospels,--the Acts, the
seven Catholic Epistles, nine of the Pauline Epistles, and the
Epistle to the Hebrews, so far as the fourteenth verse of the ninth
chapter,"--and nothing more."The
second, the Alexandrine, was presented to King Charles the First, in
1628.It contains the Old and New Testaments, with some exceptions;
passages are wanting in Matthew, in John, and in II.It
also contains the Epistle of Clemens Romanus, a letter of Athanasius,
and the treatise of Eusebius on the Psalms."The last is the Sinaitic
Codex, discovered about 1850, at the Convent of St."It contains the Old and New Testaments, and in addition
the entire Epistle of Barnabas, and a portion of the Shepherd of
Hennas--two books which, up to the beginning of the fourth century, were
looked upon by many as Scripture."In this manuscript, or codex, the
gospel of St.Mark concludes with the eighth verse of the sixteenth
chapter, leaving out the frightful passage: "Go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature.He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."In
matters of the utmost importance these manuscripts disagree, but even if
they all agreed it would not furnish the slightest evidence of their
truth.It will not do to call the statements made in the gospels
"depositions," until it is absolutely established who made them, and the
circumstances under which they were made.Neither can we say that "they
were made in the immediate prospect of death," until we know who made
them.It is absurd to say that "the witnesses could not have been
mistaken, because the nature of the facts precluded the possibility of
any delusion about them."Can it be pretended that the witnesses could
not have been mistaken about the relation the Holy Ghost is alleged to
have sustained to Jesus Christ?Is there no possibility of delusion
about a circumstance of that kind?Did the writers of the four gospels
have "the sensible and true avouch of their own eyes and ears" in that
behalf?How was it possible for any one of the four Evangelists to know
that Christ was the Son of God, or that he was God?Matthew says that an angel of the Lord told
Joseph in a dream, but Joseph never wrote an account of this wonderful
vision.Luke tells us that the angel had a conversation with Mary, and
that Mary told Elizabeth, but Elizabeth never wrote a word.There is no
account of Mary, or Joseph, or Elizabeth, or the angel, having had any
conversation with Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, in which one word was
said about the miraculous origin of Jesus Christ.The persons who knew
did not write, so that the account is nothing but hearsay.Black pretend that such statements would be admitted as evidence in any
court?But how do we know that the disciples of Christ wrote a word of
the gospels?How do we know
that the writers of the gospels "were men of unimpeachable character?"Black's Admission

For the purpose of defending the character of his infallible God, Mr.Black is forced to defend religious intolerance, wars of extermination,
human slavery, and almost polygamy.He admits that God established
slavery; that he commanded his chosen people to buy the children of the
heathen; that heathen fathers and mothers did right to sell their girls
and boys; that God ordered the Jews to wage wars of extermination and
conquest; that it was right to kill the old and young; that God forged
manacles for the human brain; that he commanded husbands to murder their
wives for suggesting the worship of the sun or moon; and that every
cruel, savage passage in the Old Testament was inspired by him.Such is
a "policeman's" view of God.The Stars Upon the Door of France

Mr.Black justifies all the crimes and horrors, excuses all the tortures
of all the Christian years, by denouncing the cruelties of the French
Revolution.Thinking people will not hasten to admit that an infinitely
good being authorized slavery in Judea, because of the atrocities of the
French Revolution.They will remember the sufferings of the Huguenots.They will not forget
the countless cruelties of priest and king.They will not forget the
dungeons of the Bastile.They will know that the Revolution was an
effect, and that liberty was not the cause--that atheism was not the
cause.Behind the Revolution they will see altar and throne--sword and
fagot--palace and cathedral--king and priest--master and slave--tyrant
and hypocrite.They will see that the excesses, the cruelties, and
crimes were but the natural fruit of seeds the church had sown.Upon that cloud of war, black with
the myriad miseries of a thousand years, dabbled with blood of king and
queen, of patriot and priest, there was this bow: "Beneath the flag of
France all men are free."In spite of all the blood and crime, in spite
of deeds that seem insanely base, the People placed upon a Nation's brow
these stars:--Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--grander words than ever
issued from Jehovah's lips.A KIND WORD FOR JOHN CHINAMAN

On the 27th day of March, 1880, Messrs.Wright, Dickey, O'Conner, and
Murch, of the Select Committee appointed by Congress to "Consider
the causes of the present depression of labor," presented the majority
special report on Chinese Immigration.The following quotations are
excerpts from Col.R. G. Ingersoll's caustic review of that report.The Select Committee Afraid

These gentlemen are in great fear for the future of our most holy and
perfectly authenticated religion, and have, like faithful watchmen,
from the walls and towers of Zion, hastened to give the alarm.They have
informed Congress that "Joss has his temple of worship in the Chinese
quarters, in San Francisco.Within the walls of a dilapidated structure
is exposed to the view of the faithful the God of the Chinaman, and here
are his altars of worship, Here he tears up his pieces of paper; here he
offers up his prayers; here he receives his religious consolations,
and here is his road to the celestial land."That "Joss is located in a
long, narrow room, in a building in a back alley, upon a kind of altar;"
that "he is a wooden image, looking as much like an alligator as like a
human being;" that the Chinese "think there is such a place as heaven;"
that "all classes of Chinamen worship idols;" that "the temple is open
every day at all hours;" that "the Chinese have no Sunday;" that this
heathen god has "huge jaws, a big red tongue, large white teeth, a half
dozen arms, and big, fiery, eyeballs.About him are placed offerings of
meat, and other eatables--a sacrificial offering."The Gods of the Joss-House and Patmos

No wonder that these members of the committee were shocked at such a
god, knowing as they did, that the only true God was correctly described
by the inspired lunatic of Patmos in the following words: "And there sat
in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of
Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps
with a golden girdle.His head and his hairs were white like wool, as
white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like
unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the
sound of many waters.And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out
of his mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword; and his countenance was as
the sun shining in his strength."Certainly, a large mouth, filled
with white teeth, is preferable to one used as the scabbard of a sharp,
two-edged sword.Why should these gentlemen object to a god with big
fiery eyeballs, when their own Deity has eyes like a flame of fire?A Little Too Late

Is it not a little late in the day to object to people because they
sacrifice meat and other eatables to their god?We all know, that for
thousands of years the "real" God was exceedingly fond of roasted meat;
that He loved the savor of burning flesh, and delighted in the perfume
of fresh warm blood.Christianity has a Fair Show in San Francisco

The world is also informed by these gentlemen that "the idolatry of
the Chinese produces a demoralizing effect upon our American youth by
bringing sacred things into disrespect and making religion a theme of
disgust and contempt."In San Francisco there are some three hundred
thousand people.Is it possible that a few Chinese can bring "our holy
religion" into disgust and contempt?In that city there are fifty times
as many churches as joss-houses.Scores of sermons are uttered every
week; religious books and papers are plentiful as leaves in autumn, and
somewhat dryer; thousands of bibles are within the reach of all.An Arrow from the Quiver of Satire

And there, too, is the example of a Christian city.Why should we send
missionaries to China, if we cannot convert the heathen when they come
here?When missionaries go to a foreign land the poor benighted people
have to take their word for the blessings showered upon a Christian
people; but when the heathen come here, they can see for themselves.What was simply a story becomes a demonstrated fact.They come in
contact with people who love their enemies.They see that in a Christian
land men tell the truth; that they will not take advantage of strangers;
that they are just and patient; kind and tender; and have no prejudice
on account of color, race or religion; that they look upon mankind as
brethren; that they speak of God as a Universal Father, and are
willing to work and even to suffer, for the good, not only of their own
countrymen, but of the heathen as well.All this the Chinese see and
know, and why they still cling to the religion of their country is, to
me, a matter of amazement.We Have no Religious System

I take this, the earliest opportunity, to inform these gentlemen
composing a majority of the committee, that we have in the United States
no "religious system;" that this is a secular government.That it has
no religious creed; that it does not believe nor disbelieve in a future
state of reward or punishment; that it neither affirms nor denies the
existence of a "living" God.Congress Nothing to Do with Religion

Congress has nothing to do with the religion of the people.Its members
are not responsible to God for the opinions of their constituents, and
it may tend to the happiness of the constituents for me to state that
they are in no way responsible for the religion of the members.Religion
is an individual, not a national matter.And where the nation interferes
with the right of conscience, the liberties of the people are devoured
by the monster Superstition.But I am astonished that four Christian statesmen, four members of
Congress in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, who seriously
object to people on account of their religious convictions, should
still assert that the very religion in which they believe--and the only
religion established by the living god-head of the American system--is
not adapted to the spiritual needs of one-third of the human race.It is
amazing that these four gentlemen have, in the defense of the Christian
religion, announced the discovery that it is wholly inadequate for
the civilization of mankind; that the light of the cross can never
penetrate the darkness of China; "that all the labors of the missionary,
the example of the good, the exalted character of our civilization, make
no impression upon the pagan life of the Chinese;" and that even
the report of this committee will not tend to elevate, refine and
Christianize the yellow heathen of the Pacific coast.In the name
of religion these gentlemen have denied its power and mocked at the
enthusiasm of its founder.Worse than this, they have predicted for the
Chinese a future of ignorance and idolatry in this world, and, if the
"American system" of religion is true, hell-fire in the next.Do not Trample on John Chinaman

Do not trample upon these people because they have a different
conception of things about which even this committee knows nothing.Give them the same privilege you enjoy of making a God after their own
fashion.Would you be willing
to have them remain, if one of their race, thousands of years ago, had
pretended to have seen God, and had written of him as follows: "There
went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth; coals
were kindled by it, * * * and he rode upon a cherub and did fly."Why
should you object to these people on account of their religion?Your
objection has in it the spirit of hate and intolerance.That spirit lighted the fagot, made the
thumb-screw, put chains upon the limbs, and lashes upon the backs of
men.The same spirit bought and sold, captured and kidnapped human
beings; sold babes, and justified all the horrors of slavery.Be Honest with the Chinese

If you wish to drive out the Chinese, do not make a pretext of religion.Do not pretend that you are trying to do God a favor.Injustice in his
name is doubly detestable.The assassin cannot sanctify his dagger by
falling on his knees, and it does not help a falsehood if it be uttered
as a prayer.Religion, used, to intensify the hatred of men toward men,
under the pretense of pleasing God, has cursed this world.An Honest Merchant the Best Missionary

I am almost sure that I have read somewhere that "Christ died for _all_
men," and that "God is no respecter of persons."It was once taught
that it was the duty of Christians to tell to all people the "tidings of
great joy."I have never believed these things myself, but have always
contended that an honest merchant was the best missionary.Commerce
makes friends, religion makes enemies; the one enriches, and the other
impoverishes; the one thrives best where the truth is told, the other
where falsehoods are believed.For myself, I have but little confidence
in any business, or enterprise, or investment, that promises dividends
only after the death of the stockholders.Good Words from Confucius

For the benefit of these four philosophers and prophets, I will give a
few extracts from the writings of Confucius that will, in my judgment,
compare favorably with the best passages of their report:

"My doctrine is that man must be true to the principles of his nature,
and the benevolent exercises of them toward others.""With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and with my bended arm
for a pillow, I still have joy.""Riches and honor acquired by injustice are to me but floating clouds.""The man who, in view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who, in view of
danger, forgets life; and who remembers an old agreement, however far
back it extends, such a man may be reckoned a complete man.""Recompense injury with justice, and kindness with kindness."There is one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's
life: Reciprocity is that word.The Ancient Chinese

When the ancestors of the four Christian Congressmen were barbarians,
when they lived in caves, gnawed bones, and worshiped dry snakes; the
infamous Chinese were reading these sublime sentences of Confucius.When
the forefathers of these Christian statesmen were hunting toads to
get the jewels out of their heads to be used as charms, the wretched
Chinamen were calculating eclipses, and measuring the circumference
of the earth.When the progenitors of these representatives of the
"American system of religion" were burning women charged with nursing
devils, these people "incapable of being influenced by the exalted
character of our civilization," were building asylums for the insane.The Chinese and Civil Service Reform

Neither should it be forgotten that, for thousands of years, the Chinese
have honestly practised the great principle known as civil service
reform--a something that even the administration of Mr.Hayes has
reached only through the proxy of promise.Invading China in the Name of Opium and Christ

The English battered down the door of China in the names of Opium and
Christ.This infamy was regarded as another triumph of the gospel.At last in self-defense the Chinese allowed Christians to touch their
shores.Their wise men, their philosophers, protested, and prophesied
that time would show that Christians could not be trusted.This re port
proves that the wise men were not only philosophers but prophets.Don't be Dishonest in the Name of God

Treat China as you would England.Change it if you will, according to the laws of nations, but on no
account excuse a breach of national faith by pretending that we are
dishonest for God's sake.CONCERNING CREEDS AND THE TYRANNY OF SECTS




482.Diversity of Opinion Abolished by Henry VIII

In the reign of Henry VIII--that pious and moral founder of the
apostolic Episcopal Church,--there was passed by the parliament
of England an act entitled, "An act for abolishing of diversity of
opinion."And in this act was set forth what a good Christian was
obliged to believe:

First, That in the sacrament was the real body and blood of Jesus
Christ.Second, That the body and blood of Jesus Christ was in the bread, and
the blood and body of Jesus Christ was in the wine.Fourth, That vows of chastity were of perpetual obligation.Fifth, That private masses ought to be continued; and,

Sixth, That auricular confession to a priest must be maintained.This creed was made by law, in order that all men might know just what
to believe by simply reading the statute.The Church hated to see the
people wearing out their brains in thinking upon these subjects.Spencer and Darwin Damned

According to the philosophy of theology, man has continued to degenerate
for six thousand years.To teach that there is that in nature which
impels to higher forms and grander ends, is heresy, of course.The
Deity will damn Spencer and his "Evolution," Darwin and his "Origin
of Species," Bastian and his "Spontaneous Generation," Huxley and his
"Protoplasm," Tyndall and his "Prayer Gauge," and will save those, and
those only, who declare that the universe has been cursed, from the
smallest atom to the grandest star; that everything tends to evil and to
that only, and that the only perfect thing in nature is the Presbyterian
Confession of Faith.The Dead do Not Persecute

Imagine a vine that grows at one end and decays at the other.The
end that grows is heresy, the end that rots is orthodox.The dead are
orthodox, and your cemetery is the most perfect type of a well regulated
church.No thought, no progress, no heresy there.Slowly and silently,
side by side, the satisfied members peacefully decay.There is only this
difference--the dead do not persecute.The Atheist a Legal Outcast in Illinois

The supreme court of Illinois decided, in the year of grace 1856, that
an unbeliever in the existence of an intelligent First Cause could not
be allowed to testify in any court.His wife and children might have
been murdered before his very face, and yet in the absence of other
witnesses, the murderer could not have even been indicted.To him, Justice was not only blind, but deaf.He
was liable, like other men, to support the government, and was forced to
contribute his share towards paying the salaries of the very judges
who decided that under no circumstances could his voice be heard in any
court.This was the law of Illinois, and so remained until the adoption
of the new Constitution By such infamous means has the Church endeavored
to chain the human mind, and protect the majesty of her God.How the Owls Hoot

Now and then somebody examines, and in spite of all keeps his manhood,
and has the courage to follow where his reason leads.Then the pious
get together and repeat wise saws, and exchange knowing nods and most
prophetic winks.The stupidly wise sit owl-like on the dead limbs of the
tree of knowledge, and solemnly hoot.The Fate of Theological Students

Thousands of young men are being educated at this moment by the various
Churches.In order that they may be prepared to investigate
the phenomena by which we are surrounded?The object, and the only
object, is that they may be prepared to defend a creed; that they may
learn the arguments of their respective churches, and repeat them in
the dull ears of a thoughtless congregation.If one, after being thus
trained at the expense of the Methodists, turns Presbyterian or Baptist,
he is denounced as an ungrateful wretch.Honest investigation is utterly
impossible within the pale of any Church, for the reason, that if you
think the Church is right you will not investigate, and if you think it
wrong, the Church will investigate you.The consequence of this is,
that most of the theological literature is the result of suppression, of
fear, tyranny and hypocrisy.Trials for Heresy

A trial for heresy means that the spirit of persecution still lingers in
the Church; that it still denies the right of private judgment; that it
still thinks more of creed than truth, and that it is still determined
to prevent the intellectual growth of man.It means the churches are
shambles in which are bought and sold the souls of men.It means that
the Church is still guilty of the barbarity of opposing thought with
force.It means that if it had the power, the mental horizon would be
bound by a creed; that it would bring again the whips and chains and
dungeon keys, the rack and fagot of the past.Presbyterianism Softening

Fortunately for us, civilization has had a softening effect even upon
the Presbyterian Church.To the ennobling influence of the arts and
sciences the savage spirit of Calvinism has, in some slight degree,
succumbed.True, the old creed remains substantially as it was written,
but by a kind of tacit understanding it has come to be regarded as a
relic of the past.The cry of "heresy" has been growing fainter and
fainter, and, as a consequence, the ministers of that denomination
have ventured, now and then, to express doubts as to the damnation of
infants, and the doctrine of total depravity.The Methodist "Hoist with his own Petard."A few years ago a Methodist clergyman took it upon himself to give me a
piece of friendly advice."Although you may disbelieve the bible," said
he, "you ought not to say so."Do
you believe the bible," said I. He replied, "Most assuredly."To which
I retorted, "Your answer conveys no information to me.You may be
following your own advice.Of
course a man who will advise others to dissimulate will not always be
particular about telling the truth himself."The Precious Doctrine of Total Depravity

What a precious doctrine is that of the total depravity of the human
heart!How sweet it is to believe that the lives of all the good and
great were continual sins and perpetual crimes; that the love a mother
bears her child is, in the sight of God, a sin; that the gratitude of
the natural heart is simple meanness; that the tears of pity are impure;
that for the unconverted to live and labor for others is an offense to
heaven; that the noblest aspirations of the soul are low and groveling
in the sight of God.Guilty of Heresy

Whoever has an opinion of his own, and honestly expresses it, will be
guilty of heresy.Heresy is what the minority believe; it is the name
given by the powerful to the doctrine of the weak.This word was born of
the hatred, arrogance and cruelty of those who love their enemies, and
who, when smitten on one cheek, turn the other.This word was born of
intellectual slavery in the feudal ages of thought.It was an epithet
used in the place of argument.From the commencement of the Christian
era, every art has been exhausted and every conceivable punishment
inflicted to force all people to hold the same religious opinions.This
effort was born of the idea that a certain belief was necessary to the
salvation of the soul.One great trouble is that most teachers are dishonest.They teach as
certainties those things concerning which they entertain doubts.They
do not say, "we _think_ this is so," but "we _know_ this is so."They do
not appeal to the reason of the pupil, but they command his faith.They
keep all doubts to themselves; they do not explain, they assert.In all ages reason has been regarded as the enemy of religion.Nothing
has been considered so pleasing to the Deity as a total denial of the
authority of your own mind.Self-reliance has been thought a deadly
sin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and consolation
of superstition has always horrified the Church.By some unaccountable
infatuation, belief has been and still is considered of immense
importance.All religions have been based upon the idea that God will
forever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who doubts
or denies.Belief is regarded as the one essential thing.To practice
justice, to love mercy, is not enough.You must believe in some
incomprehensible creed.You must say, "Once one is three, and three
times one is one."The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to
believe, was execrated.Nothing so outrages the feelings of the Church
as a moral unbeliever--nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago

One hundred and fifty years ago the foremost preachers would have
perished at the stake.A Universalist would have been torn in pieces in
England, Scotland, and America.Unitarians would have found themselves
in the stocks, pelted by the rabble with dead cats, after which their
ears would have been cut off, their tongues bored, and their foreheads
branded.The Despotism of Faith

The despotism of faith is justified upon the ground that Christian
countries are the grandest and most prosperous of the world.At one time
the same thing could have been truly said in India, in Egypt, in Greece,
in Rome, and in every other country that has, in the history of the
world, swept to empire.This argument proves too much not only, but the
assumption upon which it is based is utterly false.Believe, or Beware

And what does a trial for heresy mean?It means that the Church says
a heretic, "Believe as I do, or I will withdraw my support.I will pursue you until your garments are rags; until your
children cry for bread; until your cheeks are furrowed with tears.I
will hunt you to the very portals of the grave."Calvin's Petrified Heart

Luther denounced mental liberty with all the coarse and brutal vigor
of his nature; Calvin despised, from the very bottom of his petrified
heart, anything that even looked like religious toleration, and solemnly
declared that to advocate it was to crucify Christ afresh.All the
founders of all the orthodox churches have advocated the same infamous
tenet.The truth is, that what is called religion is necessarily
inconsistent with free thought.Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his opinion
as to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God?Common sense
belongs exclusively to no tongue.Logic is not confined to, nor has it
been buried with, the dead languages.Paine attacked the bible as it is
translated.If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.A gentleman, walking among the ruins of Athens came upon a fallen statue
of Jupiter; making an exceedingly low bow he said: "O Jupiter!He then added: "Should you ever sit upon the throne of heaven
again, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you
were prostrate."The Tail of a Lion

There is no saying more degrading than this: "It is better to be the
tail of a lion than the head of a dog."It is a responsibility to think
and act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they
join something and become the tail of some lion.They say, "My party
can act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to
pay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself
about the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore."While the Preachers Talked the People Slept

The fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The
fall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began
to have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the
congregations slept.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories
themselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short
of irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside
world was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while
the church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress

Christianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human
race.Across the highway of progress it has always been building
breastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,
dogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered
together behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of
malice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into
a deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be
crowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of
hearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you
will not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to
smilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not
been found.The Real Eden is Beyond

Nations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy
becomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the
years sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are
behind us and the real Eden is beyond.It is said that a desire for
knowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,
it will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men

Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,
Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and
women.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All
other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,
given up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS




507.On which of the six days was he
created?Is it possible that God would make a successful
rival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what
a snake with a "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced
woman.He knew that if the serpent
got into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive
them out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he
himself would die upon the cross.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?Must we, in order to be
good, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman
was a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to
take one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it
not possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these
fables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God
take him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam
and Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not
acquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent's
reputation.Questions About the Ark

How was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what
was done with the filth?How were some
portions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others
kept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their
respective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,
and they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things
must have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept
up a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the
slowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the
plains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate
rate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and
so sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon
their health.Of course, all the polar
bears did not go.It could be confounded only by the
destruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at
that time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain
presiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak
the words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch
the brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in
the machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the
language of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man
to be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in
the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take
myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a
holy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,
candlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,
at the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put
any of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,
the Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,
that whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off
from his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot
believe it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep
are?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the
earth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters
happen to run up hill?Would a Real God Uphold Slavery?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of
others?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a
legal tender for labor performed?Must we regard the auction block as an
altar?Were the
stealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and
eloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these
things; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who
will burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who
burns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the
investigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,
laugh at the honest folks in hell?Will the agony of the damned increase
or decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an
eternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has
not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and
entitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat
this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG

I do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the
clouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,
soil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every
heretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast
out and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give
his individuality for what is called respectability.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really
valuable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or
State solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically
we are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect
minds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give
up your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory
of reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,
the ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:
"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of
man."Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,
but after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of
men and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the
human heart.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only
justice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the
same as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been
wet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne
have leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated
to excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his
existence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the
conditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what
would have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen
is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all
religions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our
right to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his
intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this
sense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own
in which is found this passage: "Blessed is the man and beloved of all
the gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid."The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;
they have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think
a man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long
time.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike
ourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than
servile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt
to ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any
time, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from
human speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of
the Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too
much thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the
sword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition
Science has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality
enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one
who had the grandeur to say his say."The Church says the earth is flat; but I have seen its shadow on the
moon, and I have more confidence even in a shadow than in the Church.""On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and
success.INGERSOLL'S ORATION AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVE

     A Tribute to Ebon C. Ingersoll, by his Brother
     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs
     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our
     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish
     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would
do for me.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where
manhood's morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were
falling toward the west.He had not passed on life's highway the stone that marks the highest
point; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,
using his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that
kisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured
with the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour
of all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash
against the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a
sunken ship For whether in mid sea or '<DW41> the breakers of the farther
shore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every
life, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment
jeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep
and dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but
in the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic
souls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,
while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to
tears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly
gave alms.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully
discharged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand
times I have heard him quote these words: "For Justice all place a
temple, and all season, summer."He believed that happiness was the only
good, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only
religion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;
and were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom
to his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet
flowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
eternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,
and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless
lips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of
death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the
return of health, whispered with his latest breath, "I am better now."Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that
these dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,
to do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,
stronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL'S DREAM OF THE WAR

     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were
     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran
     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the
great struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the
music of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We
see thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see
the pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those
assemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the
great army of freedom.Some are
walking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they
adore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as
they lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing
babes that are asleep.Some are parting with
mothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,
and say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her
arms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand
waves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,
keeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the
great cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the
fields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.We are by their side on all the gory
fields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.We stand
guard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with
them in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are
with them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,
the life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them
pierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in
the whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech
can never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden
in the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man
bowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings
governed by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the
strokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through
tangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the
sacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the
brutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner
of the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting
shell.Instead of
slaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches
the auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see
homes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want
and crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They
are at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag
they rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the
tearful willows, the embracing vines.They sleep beneath the shadows of
the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or storm, each in the window-less
palace of rest.Earth may run red with other wars--they are at peace.In
the midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they found the serenity of
death.I have one sentiment for the soldiers living and dead--cheers for
the living and tears for the dead.It is not necessary to be a pig in order to raise one.A blow from a parent leaves a scar on the soul of the child.A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.Agriculture is the basis of all wealth.It is better to be a whole farmer than part of a mechanic.One good school-master is worth a thousand priests.Out in the intellectual sea there is room for every sail.An honest God is the noblest work of man.A King is a non-producing thief, sitting on a throne, surrounded by
vermin.Whiskey is the son of villainies, the father of all crimes, the mother
of all abominations, the devil's best friend, and God's worst enemy.An Orthodox Man is a gentleman petrified in his mind.Chicago is a marvel of energy, a miracle of nerva

The Pulpit is a pillory.Civilization is the Child of Forethought

Prejudice is the Child of Ignorance.I believe in the democracy of the fireside, in the republicanism of the
home.I believe in truth, in
investigation, in forethought.I believe in the gospel of education, of cheerfulness, of justice and
intelligence.BOYCE’S MEDITATIONS.The changes in Thessaly’s external appearance did not particularly
impress young Mr.Horace Boyce as he walked down the main street in the
direction of his father’s house.For one thing, he had been here for a
fortnight only a few months before, upon his return from Europe, and had
had pointed out to him all of novelty that his native village offered.And again, nearly four years of acquaintance with the chief capitals
of the Old World had so dulled his vision, so to speak, that it was
no longer alert to detect the presence of new engine-houses and brick
stores in the place of earlier and less imposing structures.To be
accurate, he did not think much about Thessaly, one way or the other.So
long as his walk led him along the busier part of the thoroughfare, his
attention was fully occupied by encounters and the exchange of greetings
with old school-fellows and neighbors, who all seemed glad to see him
home again; and when he had passed the last store on the street, and
had of necessity exchanged the sidewalk for one of the two deep-beaten
tracks in the centre of the drifted road, his thoughts were still upon
a more engrossing subject than the growth and prosperity of any North
American town.They were pleasant thoughts, though, as any one might read in a glance
at his smooth-shaven, handsome face, with its satisfied half smile and
its bold, confident expression of eyes.He stopped once in his rapid
walk and stood for a minute or two in silent contemplation, just before
he reached the open stretch of country which lay like a wedge between
the two halves of the village.The white surface in front of him was
strewn here with dry boughs and twigs, broken from the elms above by
the weight of the recent snowfall.Beyond the fence some boys with
comforters tied about their ears were skating on a pond in the fields.Boyce looked over these to the darkened middle-distance of the
wintry picture, where rose the grimy bulk and tall smoke-belching
chimneys of the Minster iron-works.He seemed to find exhilaration in
his long, intent gaze at these solid evidences of activity and wealth,
for he filled his lungs with a deep, contented draught of the nipping
air when he finally turned and resumed his walk, swinging his shoulders
and lightly tapping the crusted snowbanks at his side with his stick as
he stepped briskly forward.The Minster iron-works were undoubtedly worth thinking about, and all
the more so because they were not new.During all the dozen or more
years of their existence they had never once been out of blast.At
seasons of extreme depression in the market, when even Pennsylvania
was idle and the poor smelters of St.Louis and Chicago could scarcely
remember when they had been last employed, these chimneys upon which he
had just looked had never ceased for a day to hurl their black clouds
into the face of the sky.They had been built by one of the
cleverest and most daring of all the strong men whom that section had
produced--the late Stephen Minster.It was he who had seen in the hills
close about the choicest combination of ores to be found in the whole
North; it was he who had brought in the capital to erect and operate the
works, who had organized and controlled the enterprise by which a direct
road to the coal-fields was opened, and who, in affording employment
to thousands and good investments to scores, had not failed to himself
amass a colossal fortune.He had been dead now nearly three years, but
the amount of his wealth, left in its entirety to his family, was still
a matter of conjecture.Popular speculation upon this point had but a
solitary clew with which to work.In a contest which arose a year before
his death, over the control of the Northern Union Telegraph Company, he
had sent down proxies representing a clear six hundred thousand dollars’
worth of shares.With this as a basis for calculation, curious people
had arrived at a shrewd estimate of his total fortune as ranging
somewhere between two and three millions of dollars.Stephen Minster had died very suddenly, and had been sincerely mourned
by a community which owed him nothing but good-will, and could remember
no single lapse from honesty or kindliness in his whole unostentatious,
useful career.It was true that the absence of public-spirited bequests
in his will created for the moment a sense of disappointment; but the
explanation quickly set afoot--that he had not foreseen an early death,
and had postponed to declining years, which, alas!never came, the task
of apportioning a moiety of his millions among deserving charities--was
plausible enough to be received everywhere.By virtue of a testament
executed two years before--immediately after the not altogether edifying
death of his only son--all his vast property devolved upon Mrs.Minster, and her two daughters, Kate and Ethel.Every unmarried man in
Thessaly--and perhaps, with a certain vague repining, here and there one
of the married men too--remembered all these facts each time he passed
the home of the Minsters on the Seminary road, and looked over the low
wall of masonry at the close-trimmed lawn, the costly fountain, the
gravelled carriage-drive, and the great house standing back and aloof in
stately seclusion among the trees and the rose-bushes.Most of these facts were familiar as well to Mr.As he
strode along, filliping the snow with his cane and humming to himself,
he mentally embellished them with certain deductions drawn from
information gathered during the journey by rail from New York.The Miss
Kate Minster whom he had met was the central figure in his meditations,
as indeed she was the important personage in her family.The mother had
impressed him as an amiable and somewhat limited woman, without much
force of character; the younger daughter, Ethel, he remembered dimly, as
a delicate and under-sized girl who was generally kept home from school
by reason of ill-health, and it was evident from such remarks as the two
ladies dropped that she was still something of an invalid.But it was
clear that Miss Kate lacked neither moral nor bodily strength.He was quite frank with himself in thinking that, apart from all
questions of money, she was one of the most beautiful women he had ever
seen.It was an added charm that her beauty fitted so perfectly the
idea of great wealth.She might have been the daughter of the millions
themselves, so tall and self-contained and regal a creature was she,
with the firm, dark face of her father reproduced in feminine grace
and delicacy of outline; with a skin as of an Oriental queen, softly
luxuriant in texture and in its melting of creamy and damask and
deepening olive hues; and with large, richly brown, deep-fringed eyes
which looked proudly and steadily on all the world, young men included.These fine orbs were her most obvious physical inheritance from her
father.The expression “the Minster eyes,” would convey as distinct an
impression to the brain of the average Thessalian as if one had said
“the Minster iron-works.” The great founder of the millions, Stephen
Minster, had had them, and they were the notable feature of even his
impressive face.The son who was dead, Stephen junior, had also had
them, as Horace now recalled to mind; but set in his weak head they had
seemed to lose significance, and had been, in truth, very generally in
his latter years dimmed and opacated by the effects of dissipation.The
pale, sweet-faced little Ethel Minster, as he remembered her, had them
as well, although with her they were almost hazel in color, and produced
a timid, mournful effect.But to no other face in the entire family
gallery did they seem to so wholly belong of right as to the countenance
of Miss Kate.Boyce’s thoughts wandered easily from the image of the
heiress to the less tangible question of her disposition, and, more
particularly, of her attitude toward him.There were obscurities here
over which a less sanguine young man might have bitten his lips.He had
ventured upon recalling himself to mother and daughter very soon after
the train left New York, and they had not shown any shadow of annoyance
when he took a vacant chair opposite them and began a conversation which
lasted, such as it was, through all the long journey.But now that he
came to think of it, his share in that conversation had been not only
the proverbial lion’s, but more nearly that of a whole zoological
garden.Minster had not affected any especial reserve; it was
probable that she was by nature a listener rather than a talker, for she
had asked him numerous questions about himself and about Europe.As for
Miss Minster, he could scarcely recall anything she had said, what time
she was looking at him instead of at her book.And he had not always
been strictly comfortable under this look.There had been nothing
unfriendly in it, it was true, nor could it occur to anybody to suspect
in it a lack of comprehension or of interest.In fact, he said to
himself, it was eloquent with both.The trouble was, as he uneasily
attempted to define it, that she seemed to comprehend too much.Still,
after all, he had said nothing to which she could take the faintest
exception, and, if she was the intelligent woman he took her to be,
there must have been a good deal in his talk to entertain her.Even a less felicitous phrase-maker than Horace Boyce could have
manufactured pleasant small-talk out of such experiences as his had
been.The only son of a well-to-do and important man in Thessaly, he
had had the further advantage of inheriting some twenty thousand dollars
upon attaining his majority, and after finishing his course at college
had betaken himself to Europe to pursue more recondite studies there,
both in and out of his chosen profession of the law.The fact that he
had devoted most of his attention to the gleaning of knowledge
lying beyond the technical pale of the law did not detract from the
interesting quality of his observations.Besides listening to lectures
at Heidelberg, he had listened to the orchestra swaying in unison under
the baton of Strauss at Vienna, and to a good many other things in Pesth
and Paris and Brussels and London, a large number of which could with
propriety be described in polite conversation.And he flattered himself
that he had discoursed upon these things rather cleverly, skirting
delicate points with neatness, and bringing in effective little
descriptions and humorous characterizations in quite a natural way.Moreover, he said to himself, it had been his privilege to see America
in perspective--to stand upon a distant eminence, as it were, and look
the whole country over, by and large, at a glance.This had enabled him
on his return to discover the whimsical aspect of a good many things
which the stay-at-home natives took with all seriousness.He had
indicated some of these to the two ladies with a light and amiably
bantering touch, and with a consciousness that he was opening up novel
ground to both his hearers.Still--he wondered if Miss Minster had really liked it.Could it be
possible that she belonged to that thin-skinned class of Americans who
cannot brook any comment upon anything in or of their country that is
not wholly eulogistic--who resent even the most harmless and obvious
pleasantry pointed at a cis-Atlantic institution?He decided this
promptly in the negative.He had met such people, but he could not
associate them in his mind with the idea of great wealth.And Miss
Minster was rich--incredibly rich.No doubt she was thinking, even while
she listened to him, of the time when she too should go to Europe, and
dazzle its golden youth with her beauty and her millions.Now that he
thought of it, he had seen much that same look before on the face of
an American heiress, on her return from a London “five-o’clock tea,” at
which she had met an eligible marquis.Could it be that her thoughts ran, instead, upon an eligible somebody
nearer home?He devoted himself at this to canvassing the chances of her
fancy being already fixed.It was of little importance that nothing in
their conversation suggested this, because it was a subject to which
they naturally would not have alluded.Minster
had spoken of their great seclusion more than once.He had gathered,
moreover, that they knew very few people in New York City, and that
they had little acquaintance with the section of its population which
is colloquially known as “society.” This looked mightily like a clear
field.Boyce stopped to thrust his cane under a twisted branch which
lay on the snow, and toss it high over the fence, when he reached this
stage of his meditations.His squared, erect shoulders took on a more
buoyant swing than ever as he resumed his walk.And now as to the problem of proceeding to occupy that field.Where was
there a gap in the wall?Millions were not to be approached and gained
by simple and primitive methods, as one knocks apples off an overhanging
bough with a fence-rail.Strategy and finesse of the first order were
required.Without doubt there was an elaborate system of defences reared
around this girl of girls.Minster’s reference to seclusion might
have itself been a warning that they lived inside a fort, and were as
ready to train a gun on him as on anybody else.Battlements of this sort
had been stormed time and time again, no doubt; human history was
full of such instances.Boyce’s tastes were not for violent or
desperate adventures.To go over a parapet with one’s sword in one’s
teeth, in deadly peril and tempestuous triumph, might suit his father
the General: for his own part, it seemed more sagacious and indubitably
safer to tunnel under the works, and emerge on the inside at the proper
psychological moment to be welcomed as a friend and adviser.The young man cast up in his mind the
list of Thessaly’s legal practitioners, as far as he could
remember them.It seemed most probable that Benoni Clarke, the
ex-district-attorney, would have the Minster business, if for no other
reason than that he needed it less than the rest did.Clarke was
getting old, and was in feeble health as well.Perhaps he would be glad
to have a young, active, and able partner, who had had the advantage of
European study.Or it might be--who could tell?--that the young man
with the European education could go in on his own account, and by sheer
weight of cleverness, energy, and superior social address win over the
Minster business.What unlimited opportunities such a post would afford
him!Not only would he be the only young man in Thessaly who had been
outside of his own country, the best talker, the best-informed man,
the best-mannered man of the place--but he would be able to exhibit
all these excellences from the favored vantage-ground of an intimate,
confidential relation.Horace Boyce was so pre-occupied with these pleasing meditations
that he overtook a man walking in the other track, and had nearly passed
him, before something familiar in the figure arrested his attention.He
turned, and recognized an old schoolmate whom he had not seen for years,
and had not expected to find in Thessaly.“Why--Reuben Tracy, as I live!” he exclaimed, cordially.“So you’re back
again, eh?On a visit to your folks?”

The other shook hands with him.“No,” he made answer.“I’ve had an
office here for nearly a year.I’m glad to see you
again.Have you come back for good?”

“Yes.That’s all settled,” replied Mr.Horace, without a moment’s
hesitation.The two young men walked along together, separated by the ridge of
snow between the tracks.They had never been more than friendly
acquaintances, and they talked now of indifferent topics--of the grim
climatic freak which had turned late November into mid-winter, of
the results of the recent elections, and then of English weather
and politics as contrasted with ours.It was a desultory enough
conversation, for each had been absorbed in his own mind by thoughts
a thousand leagues away from snowfalls and partisan strife, and the
transition back to amiable commonplaces was not easy.The music of a sleigh-bell, which for some time had been increasing in
volume behind them, swelled suddenly into a shrill-voiced warning
close at their backs, and they stepped aside into the snow to let the
conveyance pass.It was then that the express-man called out his cheery
greeting, and that Reuben lifted his hat.As the sleigh grew small in the near distance, Reuben turned to his
companion.“I notice that you told him you weren’t quite sure about
staying here for good,” he remarked.“Perhaps I was mistaken--I
understood you to say a few minutes ago that it was all settled.”

Horace was not to be embarrassed by so slight a discrepancy as
this--although for the instant the reappearance of Jessica had sent his
wits tripping--and he was ready with a glib explanation.“What I meant was that I am quite settled in my desire to stay here.But of course there is just a chance that there may be no opening, and I
don’t want to prematurely advertise what may turn out a failure.By the
way, wasn’t that that Lawton girl?”

“Yes--Ben Lawton’s oldest daughter.”

Reuben’s tone had a slow preciseness in it which caused Horace to glance
closely at him, and wonder if it were possible that it masked some
ulterior meaning.Then he reflected that Reuben had always taken serious
views of things, and talked in that grave, measured way, and that this
was probably a mere mannerism.So he continued, with a careless voice:

“I haven’t seen her in years--should scarcely have known her.Isn’t it a
little queer, her coming back?”

Reuben Tracy was a big man, with heavy shoulders, a large, impassive
countenance, and an air which to the stranger suggested lethargy.It was
his turn to look at Horace now, and he did so with a deliberate, steady
gaze, to which the wide space between his eyes and the total absence
of lines at the meeting of his brows lent almost the effect of a stare.When he had finished this inspection of his companion’s face, he asked
simply:

“Why?”

“Well, of course, I have only heard it from others--but there seems to
be no question about it--that she--”

“That she has been a sadly unfortunate and wretched girl,” interposed
Reuben, finishing the sentence over which the other hesitated.There _is_ no question about that--no question whatever.”

“Well, that is why I spoke as I did--why I am surprised at seeing her
here again.Weren’t you yourself surprised?”

“No, I knew that she was coming.I have a letter telling me the train
she would arrive by.”

“Oh!”

The two walked on in silence for a minute or two.Then Horace said, with
a fine assumption of good feeling and honest regret:

“I spoke thoughtlessly, old fellow; of course I couldn’t know that you
were interested in--in the matter.I truly hope I didn’t say anything to
wound your feelings.”

“Not at all,” replied Reuben.What you said is what
everybody will say--must say.Besides, my feelings are of no interest
whatever, so far as this affair is concerned.It is her feelings that I
am thinking of; and the more I think--well, the truth is, I am
completely puzzled.I have never in all my experience been so wholly at
sea.”

Manifestly Horace could do nothing at this juncture but look his
sympathy.To ask any question might have been to learn nothing.But his
curiosity was so great that he almost breathed a sigh of relief when
Reuben spoke again, even though the query he put had its disconcerting
side:

“I daresay you never knew much about her before she left Thessaly?”

“I knew her by sight, of course, just as a village boy knows everybody.I can remember that she was a pretty girl.”

If there was an underlying hint in this conjunction of sentences, it
missed Reuben’s perception utterly.He replied in a grave tone:

“She was in my school, up at the Burfield.And if you had asked me in
those days to name the best-hearted girl, the brightest girl, the one
who in all the classes had the making of the best woman in her, I don’t
doubt that I should have pointed to her.That is what makes the thing so
inexpressibly sad to me now; and, what is more, I can’t in the least see
my way.”

“Your way to what?”

“Why, to helping her, of course.She has undertaken something that
frightens me when I think of it.This is the point: She has made up her
mind to come back here, earn her own living decently, face the past out
and live it down here among those who know that past best.”

“That’s a resolution that will last about three weeks.”

“No, I think she is determined enough.But I fear that she cruelly
underestimates the difficulties of her task.To me it looks hopeless,
and I’ve thought it over pretty steadily the last few days.”

“Pardon my asking you,” said Horace, “but you have confided thus far
in me--what the deuce have you got to do with either her success or her
failure?”

“I’ve told you that I was her teacher,” answered Reuben, still with the
slow, grave voice.“That in itself would give me an interest in her.But
there has been a definite claim made on me in her behalf.You remember
Seth Fairchild, don’t you?”

“Perfectly.He edits a paper down in Tecumseh, doesn’t he?He did, I
know, when I went abroad.”

“Yes.Well, his wife--who was his cousin, Annie Fairchild, and who took
the Burfield school after I left it to study law--she happens to be an
angel.She is the sort of woman who, when you know her, enables you
to understand all the exalted and sublime things that have ever been
written about her sex.Well, a year or so after she married Seth and
went to live in Tecumseh, she came to hear about poor Jessica Lawton,
and her woman’s heart prompted her to hunt the girl up and give her a
chance for her life.I don’t know much about what followed--this all
happened a good many months ago--but I get a letter now from Seth,
telling me that the girl is resolved to come home, and that his wife
wants me to do all I can to help her.”

“Well, that’s what I call letting a friend in for a particularly nice
thing.”

“Oh, don’t misunderstand me,” said Reuben; “I shall be only too glad if
I can serve the poor girl.But how to do it--that’s what troubles me.”

“Her project is a crazy one, to begin with.I wonder that sane people
like the Fairchilds should have encouraged it.”

“I don’t think they did.My impression is that they regarded it as
unwise and tried to dissuade her from it.Seth doesn’t write as if he
thought she would succeed.”

“No, I shouldn’t say there was much danger of it.She will be back
again in Tecumseh before Christmas.” After a pause Horace added, in a
confidential way: “It’s none of my business, old fellow; but if I were
you I’d be careful how I acted in this matter.You can’t afford to be
mixed up with her in the eyes of the people here.Of course your motives
are admirable, but you know what an overgrown village is for gossip.You
won’t be credited with good intentions or any disinterestedness, believe
me.”

This seemed to be a new view of the situation to Reuben.He made no
immediate answer, but walked along with his gaze bent on the track
before him and his hands behind his back.At last he said, with an air
of speaking to himself:

“But if one does mean well and is perfectly clear about it in his own
mind, how far ought he to allow his course to be altered by the possible
misconceptions of others?That opens up a big question, doesn’t it?”

“But you have said that you were not clear about it--that you were all
at sea.”

“As to means, yes; but not as to motives.”

“Nobody but you will make the distinction.And you have your practice to
consider--the confidence of your clients.Fancy the effect it will have
on them--your turning up as the chief friend and patron of a--of the
Lawton girl!You can’t afford it.” Reuben looked at his companion again
with the same calm, impassive gaze.Then he said slowly: “I can see how
the matter presents itself to you.I had thought first of going to the
dépôt to meet her; but, on consideration, it seemed better to wait and
have a talk with her after she had seen her family.I am going out to
their place now.”

The tone in which this announcement was made served to change the topic
of conversation.The talk became general again, and Horace turned
it upon the subject of the number of lawyers in town, their relative
prosperity and value, and the local condition of legal business.He
found that he was right in guessing that Mr.Clarke enjoyed Thessaly’s
share of the business arising from the Minster ironworks, and that this
share was more important than formerly, when all important affairs were
in the hands of a New York firm.He was interested, too, in what Reuben
Tracy revealed about his own practice.“Oh, I have nothing to complain of,” Reuben said, in response to a
question.“It is a good thing to be kept steadily at work--good for a
man’s mind as well as for his pocket.Latterly I have had almost too
much to attend to, since the railroad business on this division was put
in my charge; and I grumble to myself sometimes over getting so little
spare time for reading and for other things I should like to attempt.I suppose a good many of the young lawyers here would call that an
ungrateful frame of mind.Some of them have a pretty hard time of it, I
am afraid.Occasionally I can put some work in their way; but it isn’t
easy, because clients seem to resent having their business handled by
unsuccessful men.That would be an interesting thing to trace, wouldn’t
it?--the law of the human mind which prompts people to boost a man as
soon as he has shown that he can climb without help, and to pull down
those who could climb well enough with a little assistance.”

“So you think there isn’t much chance for still another young lawyer to
enter the field here?” queried Horace, bringing the discussion back to
concrete matters.“Oh, that’s another thing,” replied Reuben.“There is no earthly reason
why you shouldn’t try.There are too many lawyers here, it is true, but
then I suppose there are too many lawyers everywhere--except heaven.A
certain limited proportion of them always prosper--the rest don’t.It
depends upon yourself which class you will be in.Go ahead, and if I can
help you in any way I shall be very glad.”

“You’re kind, I’m sure.But, you know, it won’t be as if I came a
stranger to the place,” said Horace.“My father’s social connections
will help me a good deal”--Horace thought he noted a certain incredulous
gesture by his companion here, and wondered at it, but went on--“and
then my having studied in Europe ought to count.I have another
advantage, too, in being on very friendly terms with Mrs.I rode up with them from New York to-day, and we had a long
talk.I don’t want anything said about it yet, but it looks mightily as
if I were to get the whole law business of the ironworks and of their
property in general.”

Young Mr.Boyce did not wince or change color under the meditative gaze
with which Reuben regarded him upon hearing this; but he was conscious
of discomfort, and he said to himself that his companion’s way of
staring like an introspective ox at people was unpleasant.“That would be a tremendous start for you,” remarked Reuben at last.“I
hope you won’t be disappointed in it.”

“It seems a tolerably safe prospect,” answered Horace, lightly.“You say
that you’re overworked.”

“Not quite that, but I don’t get as much time as I should like for
outside matters.I want to go on the school board here, for example--I
see ever so many features of the system which seem to me to be flaws,
and which I should like to help remedy--but I can’t spare the time.And
then there is the condition of the poor people in the quarter grown up
around the iron-works and the factories, and the lack of a good library,
and the saloon question, and the way in which the young men and boys of
the village spend their evenings, and so on.These are the things I
am really interested in; and instead of them I have to devote all my
energies to deeds and mortgages and specifications for trestle-works.That’s what I meant.”

“Why don’t you take in a partner?That would relieve you of a good deal
of the routine.”

“Do you know, I’ve thought of that more than once lately.I daresay that
if the right sort of a young man had been at hand, the idea would have
attracted me long ago.But, to tell the truth, there isn’t anybody in
Thessaly who meets precisely my idea of a partner--whom I quite feel
like taking into my office family, so to speak.”

“Perhaps I may want to talk with you again on this point,” said Horace.To this Reuben made no reply, and the two walked on for a few moments in
silence.They were approaching a big, ungainly, shabby-looking structure, which
presented a receding roof, a row of windows with small, old-fashioned
panes of glass, and a broad, rickety veranda sprawling the whole width
of its front, to the highway on their left.This had once been a rural
wayside tavern, but now, by the encircling growth of the village, it had
taken on a hybrid character, and managed to combine in a very complete
way the coarse demerits of a town saloon with the evil license of a
suburban dive.Its location rendered it independent of most of the
restrictions which the village authorities were able to enforce
in Thessaly itself, and this freedom from restraint attracted the
dissipated imagination of town and country alike.It was Dave Rantell’s
place, and being known far and wide as the most objectionable resort in
Dearborn County, was in reality much worse than its reputation.The open sheds at the side of the tavern were filled with horses and
sleighs, and others were ranged along at the several posts by the
roadside in front--these latter including some smart city cutters, and
even a landau on runners.From the farther side of the house came, at
brief intervals, the sharp report of rifle-shots, rising loud above the
indistinct murmuring of a crowd’s conversation.“It must be a turkey-shoot,” said Reuben.“This man Rantell has them
every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas,” he added, as they came in
view of the scene beyond the tavern.Have you seen anything
in Europe like that?” Let it be stated without delay that there was no
trace of patriotic pride in his tone.The wide gate of the tavern yard was open, and the path through it
had been trampled smooth by many feet.In the yard just beyond were
clustered some forty or fifty men, standing about in the snow, and with
their backs to the road.Away in the distance, and to the right, were
visible two or three slouching figures of men.Traversing laterally and
leftward the broad, unbroken field of snow, the eye caught a small,
dark object on the great white sheet; if the vision was clear and
far-sighted, a closer study would reveal this to be a bird standing
alone in the waste of whiteness, tied by the leg to a stake near by,
and waiting to be shot at.The attention of every man in the throng was
riveted on this remote and solitary fowl.There was a deep hush for a
fraction of a second after each shot.Then the turkey either hopped to
one side, which meant that the bullet had gone whistling past, or sank
to the ground after a brief wild fluttering of wings.In the former
case, another loaded rifle was handed out, and suspense began again; in
the latter event, there ensued a short intermission devoted to beverages
and badinage, the while a boy started across the fields toward the
throng with the dead turkey, and the distant slouching figures busied
themselves in tying up a new feathered target.“No, it isn’t what you would call elevating, is it?” said Horace, as
the two stood looking over the fence upon the crowd.“Still, it has its
interest as a national product.I’ve seen dog-fights and cock-mains in
England attended by whole thousands of men, that were ever so much worse
than this.If you think of it, this isn’t particularly brutal, as such
sports go.”

“But what puzzles me is that men should like such sports at all,” said
Reuben.“At any rate,” replied Horace, “we’re better off in that respect than
the English are.The massacre of rats in a pit is a thing that you can
get an assemblage of nobility, and even royalty, for, over there.Now, that isn’t even relatively true here.Take this turkey-shoot of
Rantell’s, for example.You won’t find any gentlemen here; that is,
anybody who sets up to be a gentleman in either the English or the
American sense of the word.”

As if in ironical answer, a sharp, strident voice rose above the vague
babble of the throng inside the yard, and its accents reached the two
young men with painful distinctness:

“I’ll bet five dollars that General Boyce kills his six birds in ten
shots--bad cartridges barred!”




CHAPTER V.--THE TURKEY-SHOOT.The compassionate Reuben was quick to feel the humiliation with which
this brawling announcement of the General’s presence must cover the
General’s son.It had been apparent to him before that Horace would have
to considerably revise the boyish estimate of his father’s position and
importance which, he brought back with him from Europe.But it was cruel
to have the work of disillusion begun in this rude, blunt form.He tried
to soften the effect of the blow.“It isn’t as bad as all that,” he said, tacitly ignoring what they had
just heard.“No doubt some rough people do come to these gatherings;
but, on the other hand, if a man is fond of shooting, why, don’t you
see, this furnishes him with the best kind of test of his skill.Really,
there is no reason why he shouldn’t come--and--besides--”

Reuben was not clever at saying things he did not wholly mean, and his
good-natured attempt to gloss over the facts came to an abrupt halt from
sheer lack of ideas.“I suppose I shall have to learn to be a Thessalian all over again,”
 said Horace.“If you don’t mind, well go in.It’s just as well to see
the thing.”

Suiting the action to the word, he moved toward the gate.Reuben
hesitated for a moment, and then, with an “All right--for a few
minutes”--followed him into the yard.The two young men stood upon the
outskirts of the crowd for a time, and then, as opportunity favored,
edged their way through until they were a part of the inner half-ring
around a table, upon which were rifles, cartridges, cleaning rags, a
bottle and some tumblers.At their feet, under and about the table, lay
several piles of turkeys.The largest of these heaps, containing some
dozen birds, was, as they were furtively informed by a small boy, the
property of the “General.”

This gentleman, who stood well to the front of the table, might be
pardoned for not turning around to note the presence of new-comers,
since he himself had some money wagered on his work.He had on the
instant fired his third shot, and stood with the smoking gun lowered,
and his eyes fixed on the target in concentrated expectancy.The turkey
made a movement and somebody called out “hit!” But the General’s keen
vision told him better.“No, it was a line shot,” he said, “a foot too
high.” He kept his gaze still fixed on the remote object, mechanically
taking the fresh gun which was handed to him, but not immediately
raising it to his shoulder.General Sylvanus--familiarly called “Vane”--Boyce was now close
upon sixty, of middle height and a thick and portly figure, and with
perfectly white, close-cropped hair and mustache.His face had in its
day boasted both regular, well-cut features and a clear complexion.But
the skin was now of one uniform florid tint, even to the back of his
neck, and the outlines of the profile were blurred and fattened.His
gray eyes, as they swept the field of snow, had still their old, sharp,
commanding glance, but they looked out from red and puffy lids.Just as he lifted his gun, an interested bystander professed to discover
Horace for the first time, and called out exuberantly: “Why, hello, Hod!I say, ‘Vane,'here’s your boy Hod!”

“Oh, here, fair play!” shouted some of the General’s backers; “you
mustn’t try that on--spoiling his aim in that way.” Their solicitude was
uncalled for.“Damn my boy Hod, and you too!” remarked the General calmly, raising his
rifle with an uninterrupted movement, levelling it with deliberation,
firing, and killing his bird.Amid the hum of conversation which arose at this, the General turned,
laid his gun down, and stepped across the space to where Horace and
Reuben stood.“Well, my lad,” he said heartily, shaking his son’s hand, “I’m glad to
see you back.I’d have been at the dépôt to meet you, only I had this
match on with Blodgett, and the money was up.I hope you didn’t mind my
damning you just now--I daresay I haven’t enough influence to have it
do you much harm--and it was Grigg’s scheme to rattle my nerve just as
I was going to shoot.This is rye whiskey here, but they’ll bring out anything
else you want.”

“I’ll take a mouthful of this,” said Horace; “hold on, not so much.” He
poured back some of the generous portion which had been given him, and
touched glasses with his father.“You’re sure you won’t have anything, Tracy?” said the General.You
don’t know what’s good for you.Standing around in the cold here, a man
needs something.”

“But I’m not going to stand around in the cold,” answered Reuben with a
half-smile.“I must be going on in a moment or two.”

“Don’t go yet,” said the General, cheerily, as he put down his glass
and took up the gun.“Wait and see me shoot my score.I’ve got the range
now.”

“You’ve got to kill every bird but one, now, General,” said one of his
friends, in admonition.“All right; don’t be afraid,” replied the champion, in a confident tone.But it turned out not to be all right.The seventh shot was a miss, and
so was the tenth, upon which, as the final and conclusive one, great
interest hung.Some of those who had lost money by reason of their
faith in the General seemed to take it to heart, but the General himself
displayed no sign of gloom.He took another drink, and then emptied his
pockets of all the bank-bills they contained, and distributed them among
his creditors with perfect amiability.There was not enough money to go
around, evidently, for he called out in a pleasant voice to his son:

“Come here a minute, Hod.Have you got thirty dollars loose in your
pocket?I’m that much short.” He pushed about the heap of limp turkeys
on the snow under the table with one foot, in amused contemplation, and
added: “These skinny wretches have cost us about nine dollars apiece.You might at least have fed ’em a trifle better, Dave.”

Horace produced the sum mentioned and handed it over to his father with
a somewhat subdued, not to say rueful, air.He did not quite like the
way in which the little word “us” had been used.While the General was light-heartedly engaged in apportioning out his
son’s money, and settling his bill, a new man came up, and, taking a
rifle in his hands, inquired the price of a shot.He was told that it
was ten cents, and to this information was added with cold emphasis the
remark that before he fooled with the guns he must put down his money.“Oh, I’ve got the coin fast enough,” said the newcomer, ringing four
dimes on the table.“Wait a moment,” said Horace to his father and Reuben, who were about
to quit the yard.“Let’s watch Ben Lawton shoot.I might as well see the
last of my half-dollar.He’s had one drink out of it already.”

Lawton lifted the gun as if he were accustomed to firearms, and after
he had made sure of his footing on the hard-trodden snow, took a long,
careful aim, and fired.It was with evident sorrow that he saw the snow
fly a few feet to one side of the turkey.He decided to have only two
shots more, and one drink, and the drink first--a drink of such full
and notable dimensions that Dave Rantell was half-tempted to intervene
between the cup and the lip.The two shots which followed were very good
shots indeed--one of them even seemed to have cut some feathers into the
air--but they killed no turkey.Poor Ben looked for a long time after his last bullet, as if in some
vague hope that it might have paused on the way, and would resume its
fatal course in due season.Then he laid the rifle down with a deep
sigh, and walked slowly out, with his hands plunged dejectedly into his
trousers pockets, and his shoulders more rounded than ever.The habitual
expression of helpless melancholy which his meagre, characterless visage
wore was deepened now to despair.“Well, Ben,” said Horace to him, as he shuffled past them, “you were
right.You might just as well have hung around the dépôt, and let some
one else carry my things.You’ve got no more to show for it now than if
you had.”

The young man spoke in the tone of easy, paternal banter which
prosperous people find it natural to adopt toward their avowedly weak
and foolish brethren, and it did not occur to Lawton to resent it.He
stopped, and lifted his head just high enough to look in a gloomy way
at Horace and his companions for a moment; then he dropped it again
and turned to resume his course without answering.On second thought he
halted, and without again looking up, groaned out:

“There ain’t another such a darned worthless fool as I be in the whole
darned county.I don’t know what I’ll say to her.I’m a good mind not
to go home at all.Here I was, figurin’ on havin’ a real Thanksgiving
dinner for her, to try and make her feel glad she’d come back amongst us
again; and if I’d saved my money and fired all five shots, I’d a got
a bird, sure--and that’s what makes me so blamed mad.It’s always my
darned luck!”

While he spoke a boy came up to them, dragging a hand-sled upon which
General Boyce’s costly collection of poultry was piled.Horace stopped
the lad, and took from the top of the heap two of the best of the fowls.“Here, Ben,” he said, “take these home with you.We’ve got more than we
know what to do with.We should only give them away to people who didn’t
need them.”

Lawton had been moved almost to tears by the force of his
self-depreciatory emotions.His face brightened now on the instant,
as he grasped the legs of the turkeys and felt their weight.He looked
satisfiedly down at their ruffling circumference of blue-black feathers,
and at their pimply pink heads dragging sidewise on the snow.“You’re a regular brick, Hod,” he said, with more animation than it was
his wont to display.“They’ll be tickled to death down to the house.I’m
obliged to you, and so she’ll be--”

He stopped short, weighed the birds again in his hand with a saddened
air, and held them out toward Horace.All the joy had gone out of his
countenance and tone.“No; I’m much obliged to you, Hod, but I can’t take ’em,” he said,
with pathetic reluctance.“Nonsense!” replied the young man, curtly.“Don’t make a fool of
yourself twice in the same afternoon.Only
go straight home with them, instead of selling them for drinks.”

Horace turned upon his heel as he spoke and rejoined his father and
Reuben, who had walked on slowly ahead.The General had been telling
his companion some funny story, and his eyes were still twinkling with
merriment as his son came up, and he repeated to him the gist of his
humorous narrative.Horace did not seem to appreciate the joke, and kept a serious face even
at the most comical part of the anecdote.This haunting recurrence of
the Lawton business, as he termed it in his thoughts, annoyed him; and
still more was he disturbed and vexed by what he had seen of his father.During his previous visit to Thessaly upon his return from Europe,
some months before, the General had been leading a temperate and almost
monastic life under the combined restraints of rheumatism and hay-fever,
and this present revelation of his tastes and habits came therefore in
the nature of a surprise to Horace.The latter was unable to find
any elements of pleasure in this surprise, and scowled at the snow
accordingly, instead of joining in his father’s laughter.Besides, the
story was not altogether of the kind which sits with most dignity on
paternal lips.The General noted his son’s solemnity and deferred to it.“I’m glad you
gave that poor devil the turkeys,” he said.“I suppose they’re as poor
as they make ’em.Only--what do you think, Tracy; as long as I’d shot
all the birds, I might have been consulted, eh, about giving them away?”

The query was put in a jocular enough tone, but it grated upon the young
man’s mood.“I don’t think the turkey business is one that either of us
particularly shines in,” he replied, with a snap in his tone.“You say
that your turkeys cost you nine dollars apiece.Apparently I am by way
of paying fifteen dollars each for my two.”

“‘By way of’--that’s an English expression, isn’t it?” put in Reuben,
hastily, to avert the threatened domestic dispute.“I’ve seen it in
novels, but I never heard it used before.”

The talk was fortunately turned at this from poultry to philology; and
the General, though he took no part in the conversation, evinced no
desire to return to the less pleasant subject.Thus the three walked
on to the corner where their ways separated.As they stood here for the
parting moment, Reuben said in an aside to Horace:

“That was a kindly act of yours--to give Lawton the turkeys.I can’t
tell you how much it pleased me.Those little things show the character
of a man.If you like to come down to my office Friday, and are still of
the same mind about a partnership, we will talk it over.”




CHAPTER VI.--THANKSGIVING AT THE MINSTERS’.I REMEMBER having years ago been introduced to one of America’s richest
men, as he sat on the broad veranda of a Saratoga hotel in the full
glare of the morning sunlight.It is evident that at such a solemn
moment I should have been filled with valuable and impressive
reflections; yet, such is the perversity and wrong-headedness of the
human mind, I could for the life of me evolve no weightier thought than
this: “Here is a man who can dispose of hundreds of millions of dollars
by a nod of the head, yet cannot with all this countless wealth command
a dye for his whiskers which will not turn violet in the sunshine!”

The sleek and sober-visaged butler who moved noiselessly about the
dining-room of the Minster household may have had some such passing
vision of the vanity of riches, as he served what was styled a
Thanksgiving dinner.Vast as the fortune was, it could not surround
that board with grateful or lighthearted people upon even this selected
festal day.The room itself must have dampened any but the most indomitably cheerful
spirits.It had a sombre and formal aspect, to which the tall oleanders
and dwarf palms looking through the glass on the conservatory side lent
only an added sense of coldness.The furniture was of dark oak and
even darker leather; the walls were panelled in two shades of the same
serious tint; the massive, carved sideboard and the ponderous mantel
declined to be lifted out of their severe dignity by such trivial
accessories as silver and rare china and vases of flowers.There were
pictures in plenty, and costly lace curtains inside the heavy outer
hangings at the windows, and pretty examples of embroidery here and
there which would have brightened any less resolutely grave environment:
in this room they went for nothing, or next to nothing.Four women sat at this Thanksgiving dinner, and each, being in her own
heart conscious of distinct weariness, politely took it for granted that
the others were enjoying their meal.Talk languished, or fitfully flared up around some strictly
uninteresting subject with artificial fervor the while the butler was in
the room.His presence in the house was in the nature of an experiment,
and Mrs.Minster from time to time eyed him in a furtive way, and then
swiftly turned her glance aside on the discovery that he was eying
her.Probably he was as good as other butlers, she reflected; he was
undoubtedly English, and he had come to her well recommended by a friend
in New York.But she was unaccustomed to having a man servant in the
dining-room, and it jarred upon her to call him by his surname, which
was Cozzens, instead of by the more familiar Daniel or Patrick as she
did the gardener and the coachman.Before he came--a fortnight or so
ago--she had vaguely thought of him as in livery; but the idea of
seeing him in anything but what she called a “dress suit,” and he termed
“evening clothes,” had been definitely abandoned.What she chiefly
wished about him now was that he would not look at her all the time.Minster, being occupied in this way, contributed very little to
what conversation there was during the dinner.It was not her wont to
talk much at any time.She was perhaps a trifle below the medium height
of her sex, full-figured rather than stout, and with a dark, capable,
and altogether singular face, in which the most marked features were a
proud, thin-lipped mouth, which in repose closed tight and drew downward
at the corners; small black eyes, that had an air of seeing very
cleverly through things; and a striking arrangement of her prematurely
white hair, which was brushed straight from the forehead over a high
roll.From a more or less careful inspection of this face, even astute
people were in the habit of concluding that Mrs.Minster was a clever
and haughty woman.Her reserve was due in
part to timidity, in part to lack of interest in the matters which
seemed to concern those with whom she was most thrown into contact
outside her own house.Her natural disposition had been the reverse of
unkindly, but it included an element of suspicion, which the short and
painful career of her son, and the burden of responsibility for a great
estate, had tended unduly to develop.She did not like many of the
residents of Thessaly, yet it had never occurred to her to live
elsewhere.If the idea had dawned in her mind, she would undoubtedly
have picked out as an alternative her native village on the Hudson,
where her Dutch ancestors had lived from early colonial times.The
life of a big city had never become even intelligible to her, much less
attractive.She went to the Episcopal church regularly, although she
neither professed nor felt any particular devotion to religious ideals
or tenets.She gave of her substance generously, though not profusely,
to all properly organized and certified charities, but did not look
about for, or often recognize when they came in her way, subjects for
private benefaction.She applied the bulk of her leisure time to the
writing of long and perfectly commonplace letters to female relatives
in various sections of the Republic.She was profoundly fond of her
daughters, but was rarely impelled to demonstrative proofs of this
affection.Very often she grew tired of inaction, mental and physical;
but she accepted this without murmuring as a natural and proper result
of her condition in life, much as one accepts an uncomfortable sense
of repletion after a dinner.When she did not know what else to do, she
ordinarily took a nap.It must have been by the law of oppositive attraction that her chosen
intimate was Miss Tabitha Wilcox, the spare and angular little lady
who sat across the table from her, the sole guest at the Thanksgiving
dinner.The most vigorous imagination could not conceive _her_ in the
act of dozing for so much as an instant during hours when others kept
awake.Vigilant observation and an unwearying interest in affairs were
written in every line of her face: you could read them in her bright,
sharp eyes; in the alert, almost anxious posture of her figure; in the
very conformation of the little rows of iron-gray curls, which mounted
like circular steps above each ear.She was a kindly soul, was Miss
Tabitha, who could not listen unmoved to any tale of honest suffering,
and who gave of her limited income to the poor with more warmth than
prudence.Her position in Thessaly was a unique one.She belonged, undoubtedly, to
the first families, for her grandfather, Judge Abijah Wilcox, had been
one of the original settlers, in those halcyon years following the close
of the Revolution, when the good people of Massachusetts and Connecticut
swarmed, uninvited, across the Hudson, and industriously divided up
among themselves the territorial patrimony of the slow and lackadaisical
Dutchmen.Miss Tabitha still lived in the roomy old house which the
judge had built; she sat in one of the most prominent pews in the
Episcopal church, and her prescriptive right to be president of the
Dorcas Mite Society had not been questioned now these dozen years.Although she was far from being wealthy, her place in the very best and
most exclusive society of Thessaly was taken for granted by everybody.But Miss Tabitha was herself not at all exclusive.She knew most of the
people in the village: only the insuperable limitations of time and
space prevented her knowing them all.And not even these stern barriers
availed to bound her information concerning alike acquaintances and
strangers.There were persons who mistook her eager desire to be of
service in whatever was going forward for meddlesomeness.Some there
were who even resented her activity, and thought of her as a malevolent
old gossip.Miss Tabitha loved
everybody, and had never consciously done injury to any living soul.As
for gossip, she could no more help talking than the robin up in the elm
boughs of a sunny April morning can withhold the song that is in him.It has been said that the presence of the butler threw a gloom over the
dinner-party.It did not silence Miss Tabitha, but at least she felt
constrained to discourse upon general and impersonal subjects while he
was in hearing.The two daughters of the house, who faced each other
at the ends of the table, asked her questions or offered comments at
intervals, and once or twice their mother spoke.All ate from the plates
that were set before them, in a perfunctory way, without evidence of
appreciation.There was some red wine in a decanter on the table--I
fancy none of them could have told precisely what it was--and of this
Miss Tabitha drank a little, diluted with water.The two girls had
allowed the butler to fill their glasses as well, and from time to time
they made motions as of sipping from these, merely to keep their guest
in company.Minster had no wine-glasses at her plate, and drank
ice-water.Every time that any one of the others lifted the wine to
her lips, a common thought seemed to flash through the minds around the
table--the memory of the son and heir who had died from drink.When the butler, with an accession of impressiveness in his reserved
demeanor, at last handed around plates containing each its thin layer of
pale meat, Ethel Minster was moved to put into words what all had been
feeling:

“Mamma, this isn’t like Thanksgiving at all!” she said, with the freedom
of a favorite child; “it was ever so much nicer to have the turkey on
the table where we could all see him, and pick out in our minds what
part we would especially like.To have the carving done outside, and
only slices of the breast brought in to us--it is as if we were away
from home somewhere, in a hotel among strangers.”

Mrs.Minster, by way of answer, looked at the butler, the glance being
not so much an inquiry as a reference of the matter to one who was a
professor of this particular sort of thing.Her own inclination jumped
with that of her daughter, but the possession of a butler entailed
certain responsibilities, which must be neither ignored nor evaded.Happily Cozzens’s mind was not wholly inelastic.He uttered no word,
but, with a slight obeisance which comprehended mistress and daughter
and guest in careful yet gracious gradations of significance, went
out, and presently returned with a huge dish, which he set in front of
Mrs.He brought the carving instruments, and dignifiedly laid
them in their place, as a chamberlain might invest a queen with her
sceptre.Even when Miss Kate said, “If we need you any more, Cozzens,
we will ring,” he betrayed neither surprise nor elation, but bowed again
gravely, and left the room, closing the door noiselessly behind him.“I am sure he will turn out a perfect jewel,” said Miss Tabitha.“You
were very fortunate to get him.”

“But there are times,” said Kate, “when one likes to take off one’s
rings, even if the stones are perfection itself.”

This guarded reference to the fact that Mrs.Minster had secured an
admirable servant who was a nuisance at small feminine dinner-parties
sufficed to dismiss the subject.Miss Tabitha assumed on the moment a
more confidential manner and tone:

“I wonder if you’ve heard,” she said, “that young Horace Boyce has come
back.Why, now I think of it, he must have come up in your train.”

“He was in our car,” replied Mrs.“He sat by us, and talked all
the way up.I never heard a man’s tongue run on so in all my born days.”

“He takes that from his grandmother Beekman,” explained Miss Tabitha,
by way of parenthesis.“She was something dreadful: talking ‘thirteen to
the dozen’ doesn’t begin to express it.She
went down to New York when I was a mere slip of a girl, to have a set of
false teeth fitted--they were a novelty in those days--and it was winter
time, and she wouldn’t listen to the dentist’s advice to keep her mouth
shut, and she caught cold, and it turned into lockjaw, and that was the
last of her.It was just after her daughter Julia had been married to
young Sylvanus Boyce.I can remember her old
bombazine gown and her black Spanish mits, and her lace cap on one side
of her head, as if it were only yesterday.And here Julia’s been dead
twenty years and more, and her grown-up son’s come home from Europe, and
the General--”

The old maid stopped short, because her sentence could not be charitably
finished.“How did _you_ like Horace?” she asked, to shift the subject,
and looking at Kate Minster.The tall, dark girl with the rich complexion and the beautiful, proud
eyes glanced up at her questioner impatiently, as if disposed to resent
the inquiry.Then she seemed to reflect that no offence could possibly
have been intended, for she answered pleasantly enough:

“He seemed an amiable sort of person; and I should judge he was clever,
too.He always was a smart boy--I think that is the phrase.He talked to
mamma most of the time.”

“How can you say that, Kate?I’m sure it was because you scarcely
answered him at all, and read your book--which was not very polite.”

“I was afraid to venture upon anything more than monosyllables with
him,” said Kate, “or I should have been ruder still.I should have had
to tell him that I did not like Americans who made the accident of their
having been to Europe an excuse for sneering at those who haven’t been
there, and that would have been highly impolite, wouldn’t it?”

“I don’t think he sneered,” replied Mrs.“I thought he tried to
be as affable and interesting as he knew how.Pray what did he say that
was sneering?”

“Oh, dear me, I don’t in the least remember what he said.It was his
tone, I think, more than any special remark.He had an air of condoling
with me because he had seen so many things that I have only read about;
and he patronized the car, and the heating-apparatus, and the conductor,
and the poor little black porter, and all of us.”

“He was a pretty boy.Does he hold his own, now he’s grown up?” asked
Miss Tabitha.“He used to favor the Boyce side a good deal.”

“I should say he favored the Boyce side to the exclusion of everybody
else’s side,” said Kate, with a little smile at her own conceit,
“particularly his own individual section of it.He is rather tall, with
light hair, light eyes, light mustache, light talk, light everything;
and he looks precisely like all the other young men you see in New York
nowadays, with their coats buttoned in just such a way, and their gloves
of just such a shade, and a scarf of just such a shape with the same
kind of pin in it, and their hats laid sidewise in the rack so that you
can observe that they have a London maker’s brand in-side.you
have his portrait to a _t_.Do you recognize it?”

“What will poor countrified Thessaly ever do with such a metropolitan
model as this?” asked Ethel.“We shall all be afraid to go out in the
street, for fear he should discover us to be out of the fashion.”

“Oh, he is not going to stay here,” said Mrs.“He told us that
he had decided to enter some law firm in New York.It seems a number of
very flattering openings have been offered him.”

“I happen to know,” put in Miss Tabitha, “that he _is_ going to stay
here.What is more, he has as good as struck up a partnership with
Reuben Tracy.I had it this morning from a lady whose brother-in-law is
extremely intimate with the General.”

“That is very curious,” mused Mrs.“He certainly talked
yesterday of settling in New York, and mentioned the offers he had had,
and his doubt as to which to accept.”

“Are you sure, mamma,” commented Kate, “that he wasn’t talking merely to
hear himself talk?”

“I like the looks of that Reuben Tracy,” interposed Ethel.“He always
suggests the idea that he is the kind of man you could tie something to,
and come back hours afterward and find it all there just as you had left
it.”

The girl broke into an amused laugh at the appearance of this metaphor,
when she had finished it, and the others joined in her gayety.Under
the influence of this much-needed enlivenment, Miss Tabitha took another
piece of turkey and drank some of her wine and water.“It will be a good thing for Horace Boyce,” said Miss Tabitha.“He
couldn’t have a steadier or better partner for business.They tell me
that Tracy handles more work, as it is, than any other two lawyers in
town.He’s a very good-hearted man too, and charitable, as everybody
will admit who knows him.What a pity it is that he doesn’t take an
interest in church affairs, and rent a pew, and set an example to young
men in that way.”

“On the contrary, I sometimes think, Tabitha,” said Miss Kate, idly
crumbling the bread on the cloth before her, “that it is worth while to
have an occasional good man or woman altogether outside the Church.They
prevent those on the inside from getting too conceited about their own
virtues.There would be no living with the parsons and the deacons and
the rest if you couldn’t say to them now and then: ‘See, you haven’t a
monopoly of goodness.Here are people just as honest and generous and
straightforward as you are yourselves, who get along without any altar
or ark whatever.’”

Mrs.Minster looked at her daughter with an almost imperceptible lifting
of the brows.Her comment had both apology and mild reproof in it:

“To hear Kate talk, one would think she was a perfect atheist.She is
always defending infidels and such people.I am sure I can’t imagine
where she takes it from.”

“Why, mamma!” protested the girl, “who has said anything about infidels?We have no earthly right to brand people with that word, simply because
we don’t see them going to church as we do.Tracy to even bow to him--at least I don’t--and we know no more about
his religious opinions than we do about--what shall I say?--about the
man in the moon.But I have heard others speak of him frequently, and
always with respect.I merely
said it was worth while to keep in mind that men could be good without
renting a pew in church.”

“I don’t like to hear you speak against religion, that is all,” replied
the mother, placidly.“It isn’t--ladylike.”

“And if you come to inquire,” interposed Miss Tabitha, speaking
with great gentleness, as of one amiably admonishing impetuous and
ill-informed youth, “you will generally find that there is something not
quite as it should be about these people who are so sure that they
need no help to be good.Only last evening Sarah Cheeseborough told me
something about your Mr.Tracy--”

“_My_ Mr.Tracy!”

“Well, about _the_ Mr.Tracy, then, that she saw with her own eyes.It only goes to show what poor worms
the best of us are, if we just rely upon our own strength alone.”

“What was it?” asked Mrs.Minster, with a slight show of interest.Miss Tabitha by way of answer threw a meaning glance at the two girls,
and discreetly took a sip of her wine and water.“Oh, don’t mind us, Tabitha!” said Kate.“I am twenty-three, and Ethel
is nearly twenty, and we are allowed to sit up at the table quite as if
we were grown people.”

The sarcasm was framed in pleasantry, and Miss Tabitha took it in
smiling good part, with no further pretence of reservation.“Well, then, you must know that Ben Lawton--he’s a shiftless sort of
coot who lives out in the hollow, and picks up odd jobs; the sort of
people who were brought up on the canal, and eat woodchucks--Ben Lawton
has a whole tribe of daughters.Some of them work around among the
farmers, and some are in the button factory, and some are at home doing
nothing; and the oldest of the lot, she ran away from here five years
ago or so, and went to Tecumseh.She was a good-looking girl--she worked
one season for my sister near Tyre, and I really liked her looks--but
she went altogether to the dogs, and, as I say, quit these parts,
everybody supposed for good.what must she do but
turn up again like a bad penny, after all this time, and, now I think of
it, come back on the very train you travelled by, yesterday, too!”

“There is nothing very remarkable about that,” commented Kate.“So far
as I have seen, one doesn’t have to show a certificate of character to
buy a railway ticket.The man at the window scowls upon the just and the
unjust with impartial incivility.”

“Just wait,” continued Miss Tabitha, impressively, “wait till you have
heard all!This girl--Jess Lawton, they call her--drove home on the
express-sleigh with her father right in broad daylight.And who do you
think followed up there on foot--in plain sight, too--and went into the
house, and stayed there a full half hour?Sarah Cheeseborough saw him pass the place, and watched him go into
their house--you can see across lots from her side windows to where the
Lawtons live--and just for curiosity she kept track of the time.The
girl hadn’t been home an hour before he made his appearance, and Sarah
vows she hasn’t seen him on that road before in years._Now_ what do you
think?”

“I think Sarah Cheesborough might profitably board up her side windows.It would help her to concentrate her mind on her own business,” said
Kate.Her sister Ethel carried this sentiment farther by adding: “So do
I!She is a mean, meddlesome old cat.I’ve heard you say so yourself,
Tabitha.”

The two elder ladies took a different view of the episode, and let it be
seen; but Mrs.Minster seized the earliest opportunity of changing
the topic of conversation, and no further mention was made during the
afternoon of either Reuben Tracy or the Lawtons.The subject was, indeed, brought up later on, when the two girls were
alone together in the little boudoir connecting their apartments.Pale-faced Ethel sat before the fire, dreamily looking into the coals,
while her sister stood behind her, brushing out and braiding for the
night the younger maiden’s long blonde hair.“Do you know, Kate,” said Ethel, after a long pause, “it hurt me almost
as if that Mr.Tracy had been a friend of ours, when Tabitha told
about him and--and that woman.It is so hard to have to believe evil of
everybody.You would like to think well of some particular person whom
you have seen--just as a pleasant fancy of the mind--and straightway
they come and tell odious things about him.And
did you believe it?” Kate drew the ivory brush slowly over the flowing,
soft-brown ringlets lying across her hand, again and again, but kept
silence until Ethel repeated her latter question.Then she said,
evasively:

“When we get to be old maids, we sha’n’t spend our time in collecting
people’s shortcomings, as boys collect postage-stamps, shall we, dear?”




CHAPTER VII.--THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER’S WELCOME.The President of the United States, that year, had publicly professed
himself of the opinion that “the maintenance of pacific relations with
all the world, the fruitful increase of the earth, the rewards accruing
to honest toil throughout the land, and the nation’s happy immunity
from pestilence, famine, and disastrous visitations of the elements,”
 deserved exceptional recognition at the hands of the people on the last
Thursday in November.The Governor of the State went further, both in
rhetorical exuberance and in his conception of benefits received, for he
enumerated “the absence of calamitous strife between capital and labor,”
 “the patriotic spirit which had dominated the toilers of the mine, the
forge, the factory, and the mill, in their judicious efforts to unite
and organize their common interests,” and “the wise and public-spirited
legislation which in the future, like a mighty bulwark, would protect
the great and all-important agricultural community from the debasing
competition of unworthy wares”--as among the other things for which
everybody should be thankful.There were many, no doubt, who were conscious of a kindly glow as they
read beneath the formal words designating the holiday, and caught the
pleasant and gracious significance of the Thanksgiving itself--strange
and perverted survival as it is of a gloomy and unthankful festival.There were others, perhaps, who smiled a little at his Excellency’s
shrewd effort to placate the rising and hostile workingmen’s movement
and get credit from the farmers for the recent oleomargarine bill, and
for the rest took the day merely as a welcome breathing spell, with an
additional drink or two in the forenoon, and a more elaborate dinner
than was usual.In the Lawton household they troubled their heads neither about the text
and tricks of the proclamations nor the sweet and humane meaning of the
day.There were much more serious matters to think of.The parable of the Prodigal Son has long been justly regarded as a
model of terse and compact narrative; but modern commentators of the
analytical sort have a quarrel with the abruptness of its ending.They
would have liked to learn what the good stay-at-home son said and did
after his father had for a second time explained the situation to him.Did he, at least outwardly, agree that “it was meet that we should make
merry and be glad”?And if he consented to go into the house, and even
to eat some of the fatted calf, did he do it with a fine, large, hearty
pretence of being glad?Did he deceive the returned Prodigal, for
example, into believing in the fraternal welcome?Or did he lie in wait,
and, when occasion offered, quietly, and with a polite smile, rub gall
and vinegar into the wayfarer’s wounds?Poor Ben Lawton had been left in no doubt as to the attitude of his
family toward the prodigal daughter.A sharp note of dissent had been
raised at the outset, on the receipt of her letter--a note so shrill and
strenuous that for the moment it almost scared him into begging her not
to come.Then his better nature asserted itself, and he contrived to
mollify somewhat the wrath of his wife and daughters by inventing a
tortuous system of lies about Jessica’s intentions and affairs.He first
established the fiction that she meant only to pay them a flying visit.Upon this he built a rambling edifice of falsehood as to her financial
prosperity, and her desire to do a good deal toward helping the family.Lastly, as a crowning superstructure of deception, he fabricated a
theory that she was to bring with her a lot of trunks filled with
costly and beautiful dresses, with citified bonnets and parasols and
high-heeled shoes, beyond belief--all to be distributed among her
sisters.Once well started, he lied so luxuriantly and with such a
flowing fancy about these things, that his daughters came to partially
believe him--him whom they had not believed before since they could
remember--and prepared themselves to be civil to their half-sister.There were five of these girls--the offspring of a second marriage
Lawton contracted a year or so after the death of baby Jessica’s
mother.The eldest, Melissa, was now about twenty, and worked out at the
Fairchild farm-house some four miles from Thessaly--a dull, discontented
young woman, with a heavy yet furtive face and a latent snarl in her
voice.Lucinda was two years younger, and toiled in the Scotch-cap
factory in the village.She also was a commonplace girl, less obviously
bad-tempered than Melissa, but scarcely more engaging in manner.Next
in point of age was Samantha, who deserves some notice by herself, and
after her came the twins, Georgiana and Arabella, two overgrown, coarse,
giggling hoydens of fifteen, who obtained intermittent employment in the
button factory.Miss Samantha, although but seventeen, had for some time been tacitly
recognized as the natural leader of the family.She did no work either
in factory or on farm, and the local imagination did not easily conceive
a condition of things in which she could find herself reduced to the
strait of manual labor.Her method, baldly stated, was to levy more
or less reluctant contributions upon whatever the rest of the family
brought in.There was a fiction abroad that Samantha stayed at home to
help her mother.The facts were that she was only visible at the Law-ton
domicile at meal-times and during inclement weather, and that her mother
was rather pleased than otherwise at this being the case.Samantha was of small and slight figure, with a shrewd,
prematurely-sapient face that was interesting rather than pretty, and
with an eye which, when it was not all demure innocence, twinkled coldly
like that of a rodent of prey.She had several qualities of mind and
deportment which marked her as distinct from the mass of village girls;
that which was most noticeable, perhaps, was her ability to invent
and say sharp, comical, and cuttingly sarcastic things without herself
laughing at them.This was felt to be a rare attainment indeed in
Thessaly, and its possession gave her much prestige among the young
people of both sexes, who were conscious of an insufficient command
alike over their tongues and their boisterous tendencies.Samantha could
have counted her friends, in the true, human sense of the word, upon her
thumbs; but of admirers and toadies she swayed a regiment.Her own elder
sisters, Melissa and Lucinda, alternated between sulky fear of her
and clumsy efforts at propitiation; the junior twins had never as
yet emerged from a plastic state of subordination akin to reverence.Samantha’s attitude toward them all was one of lofty yet observant
criticism, relieved by lapses into half-satirical, half-jocose
amiability as their pay-days approached.On infrequent occasions she
developed a certain softness of demeanor toward her father, but to her
mother she had been uniformly and contemptuously uncivil for years.Lawton, there is little enough to say.She was a pallid, ignorant, helpless slattern, gaunt of frame, narrow of
forehead, and bowed and wrinkled before her time.Like her husband, she
came of an ancestry of lake and canal boatmen; and though twenty odd
years had passed since increasing railroad competition forced her
parents to abandon their over-mortgaged scow and seek a living in the
farm country, and she married the young widower Ben Lawton in preference
to following them, her notions of housekeeping and of existence
generally had never expanded beyond the limits of a canal-boat cabin.She rose at a certain hour, maundered along wearily through such tasks
of the day as forced themselves upon her, and got to bed again as early
as might be, inertly thankful that the day was done.She rarely went out
upon the street, and still more rarely had any clothes fit to go out
in.She had a vague pride in her daughter Samantha, who seemed to her
to resemble the heroines of the continued stories which she assiduously
followed in the _Fireside Weekly_, and sometimes she harbored a formless
kind of theory that if her baby boy Alonzo had lived, things would have
been different; but her interest in the rest of the family was of the
dimmest and most spasmodic sort.In England she would have taken to
drink, and been beaten for it, and thus at least extracted from life’s
pilgrimage some definite sensations.As it was, she lazily contributed
vile cooking, a foully-kept house, and a grotesque waste of the
pittances which came into her hands, to the general squalor which hung
like an atmosphere over the Lawtons.The house to which Jessica had come with her father the previous
afternoon was to her a strange abode.At the time of her flight, five
years before, the family had lived on a cross-road some miles away;
at present they were encamped, so to speak, in an old and battered
structure which had been a country house in its time, but was now in the
centre of a new part of Thessaly built up since war.The building, with
its dingy appearance and poverty-stricken character, was an eyesore to
the neighborhood, and everybody looked hopefully forward to the day when
the hollow in which it stood should be filled up, and the house and its
inhabitants cleared away out of sight.Jessica upon her arrival had been greeted with constrained coolness
by her stepmother, who did not even offer to kiss her, but shook hands
limply instead, and had been ushered up to her room by her father.It
was a low and sprawling chamber, with three sides plastered, and the
fourth presenting a time-worn surface of naked lathing.In it were a
bed, an old chest of drawers, a wooden chair, and a square piece of rag
carpet just large enough to emphasize the bareness of the surrounding
floor.This was the company bedroom; and after Ben had brought up all
her belongings and set them at the foot of the bed, and tiptoed his way
down-stairs again, Jessica threw herself into the chair in the centre of
its cold desolation, and wept vehemently.There came after a time, while she still sat sobbing in solitude, a
soft rap at her door.When it was repeated, a moment later, she hastily
attempted to dry her eyes, and answered, “Come in.” Then the door
opened, and the figure of Samantha appeared.She was smartly dressed,
and she had a half-smile on her face.“Don’t you know me?” she said, as Jessica rose and looked at her
doubtfully in the fading light.Of course, I’ve grown a
good deal; but Lord!I’m glad to see you.”

Her tone betrayed no extravagance of heated enthusiasm, but still it
_was_ a welcome in its way; and as the two girls kissed each other,
Jessica choked down the last of her sobs, and was even able to smile a
little.“Yes, I think I should have known you,” she replied.“Oh, now I look
at you, of course I should.Yes, you’ve grown into a fine girl.I’ve
thought of you very, very often.”

“I’ll bet not half as often as I’ve thought of you,” Samantha made
answer, cheerfully.“You’ve been living in a big city, where there’s
plenty to take up your time; but it gets all-fired slow down here
sometimes, and then there’s nothing to do but to envy them that’s been
able to get out.”

Samantha had been moving the small pieces of luggage at the foot of the
bed with her feet as she spoke.With her eyes still on them she asked,
in a casual way:

“Father gone for the rest of your things?It’s like him to make two jobs
of it.”

“This is all I have brought; there is nothing more,” said Jessica.“_What!_”

Samantha was eying her sister with open-mouthed incredulity.She
stammered forth, after a prolonged pause of mental confusion:

“You mean to say you ain’t brought any swell dresses, or fancy bonnets,
or silk wrappers, or sealskins, or--or anything?Why, dad swore you was
bringing whole loads of that sort of truck with you!” She added, as if
in angry quest for consolation: “Well, there’s one comfort, he always
_was_ a liar!”

“I’m sorry if you’re disappointed,” said Jessica, stiffly; “but this is
all I’ve brought, and I can’t help it.”

“But you must have had no end of swell things,” retorted the younger
girl.And what have you
done with ’em?” She broke out in loud satire: “Oh, yes!A precious
lot you thought about me and the rest of us!I daresay it kept you awake
nights, thinking about us so much!”

Jessica gazed in painful astonishment at this stripling girl, who had
regarded her melancholy home-coming merely in the light of a chance to
enjoy some cast-off finery.All the answers that came into her head were
too bitter and disagreeable.She did not trust herself to reply, but,
still wearing her hat and jacket, walked to the window and looked out
down the snowy road.The impulse was strong within her to leave the
house on the instant.Samantha had gone away, slamming the door viciously behind her, and
Jessica stood for a long time at the window, her mind revolving
in irregular and violent sequence a score of conflicting plans and
passionate notions.There were moments in this gloomy struggle of
thought when she was tempted to throw everything to the winds--her
loyalty to pure-souled Annie Fairchild, her own pledges to herself, her
hopes and resolves for the future, everything--and not try any more.And
when she had put these evil promptings behind her, that which remained
was only less sinister.As she stood thus, frowning down through the unwashed panes at the
white, cheerless prospect, and tearing her heart in the tumultuous
revery of revolt, the form of a man advancing up the road came suddenly
under her view.He stopped when he was in front of the Lawton house, and
looked inquiringly about him.The glance which he directed upwards fell
full upon her at the window.The recognition was mutual, and he turned
abruptly from the road and came toward the house.Jessica hurriedly took
off her hat and cloak.It was her stepmother who climbed the stairs to notify her, looking more
lank and slatternly than ever, holding the bedroom door wide open, and
saying sourly: “There’s a man down-stairs to see you already,” as if the
visit were an offence, and Jessica could not pretend to be surprised.“Yes, I saw him,” she answered, and hurried past Mrs.Lawton, and down
to the gaunt, dingy front room, with its bare walls, scant furniture,
and stoveless discomfort, which not even Samantha dared call a parlor.She could remember afterward that Reuben stood waiting for her with his
hat in his left hand, and that he had taken the glove from his right
to shake hands with her; and this she recalled more distinctly than
anything else.He had greeted her with grave kindness, had mentioned
receiving notice from the Fairchilds of her coming, and had said that of
course whatever he could do to help her he desired to do.Then there had
been a pause, during which she vaguely wavered between a wish that he
had not come, and a wild, childish longing to hide her flushed face
against his overcoat, and weep out her misery.What she did do was to
point to a chair, and say, “Won’t you take a seat?”

“It is very kind of you to come,” she went on, “but--” She broke
off suddenly and looked away from him, and through the window at the
snow-banks outside.“How early the winter has closed in,” she added,
with nervous inconsequence.Reuben did not even glance out at the snow.“I’m bound to say that it
isn’t very clear to me what use I can be to you,” he said.“Of course,
I’m all in the dark as to what you intend to do.Fairchild did not
mention that you had any definite plans.”

“I had thought some of starting a milliner’s shop, of course very
small, by myself.You know I have been working in one for some months at
Tecumseh, ever since Mrs.Fairchild--ever since she--”

The girl did not finish the sentence, for Reuben nodded gravely, as if
he understood, and that seemed to be all that was needed.“That might do,” he said, after a moment’s thought, and speaking even
more deliberately than usual.“I suppose I ought to tell you this
doesn’t seem to me a specially wise thing, your coming back here.Don’t
misunderstand me; I wouldn’t say anything to discourage you, for the
world.And since you _have_ come, it wasn’t of much use, perhaps, to say
that.Still, I wanted to be frank with you, and I don’t understand why
you did come.It doesn’t appear that the Fairchilds thought it was wise,
either.”

“_She_ did,” answered Jessica, quickly, “because she understood what I
meant--what I had in mind to do when I got here.But I’m sure he laughed
at it when she explained it to him; she didn’t say so, but I know he
did.He is a man, and men don’t understand.”

Reuben smiled a little, but still compassionately.“Then perhaps I would
better give it up in advance, without having it explained at all,” he
said.“No; when I saw your name on the sign, down on Main Street, this
afternoon, I knew that you would see what I meant.I felt sure you
would: you are different from the others.You were kind to me when I was
a girl, when nobody else was.You know the miserable childhood I had,
and how everybody was against me--all but you.”

Jessica had begun calmly enough, but she finished with something very
like a sob, and, rising abruptly, went to the window.Reuben sat still, thinking over his reply.The suggestion that he
differed from the general run of men was not precisely new to his mind,
but it had never been put to him in this form before, and he was at a
loss to see its exact bearings.Perhaps, too, men are more nearly
alike in the presence of a tearful young woman than under most other
conditions.At all events, it took him a long time to resolve his
answer--until, in fact, the silence had grown awkward.“I’m glad you have a pleasant recollection of me,” he said at last.“I
remember you very well, and I was very sorry when you left the school.”
 He had touched the painful subject rather bluntly, but she did not turn
or stir from her post near the window, and he forced himself forward.“I was truly much grieved when I heard of it, and I wished that I could
have talked with you, or could have known the circumstances in time,
or--that is to say--that I could have helped you.Nothing in all my
teacher experience pained me more.I--”

“Don’t let us talk of it,” she broke in.Then she turned and came close
beside him, and lifted her hand as if to place it on his shoulder by a
frank gesture of friendship.The hand paused in mid-air, and then sank
to her side.“I know you were always as good as good could be.You don’t
need to tell me that.”

“And I wasn’t telling you that, I hope,” he rejoined, speaking more
freely now.“But you have never answered my question.What is it that
Seth Fairchild failed to understand, yet which you are sure I will
comprehend?Perhaps it is a part of your estimate of me that I should
see without being told; but I don’t.”

“My reason for coming back?I hardly know how to explain it to you.”

Reuben made no comment upon this, and after a moment she went on:

“It sounds unlikely and self-conceited, but for months back I have been
full of the idea.It was her talk that gave me the notion.I want to be
a friend to other girls placed as I was when I went to your school, with
miserable homes and miserable company, and hating the whole thing as I
hated it, and aching to get away from it, no matter how; and I want
to try and keep them from the pitch-hole I fell into.That’s what I
want--only I can’t explain it to you as I could to _her_; and you think
it’s silly, don’t you?And I--begin to think--so--myself.”

Reuben had risen now and stood beside her, and put his hand lightly on
her shoulder as she finished with this doleful confession.He spoke with
grave softness:

“No, not silly: it seems to me a very notable kind of wisdom.I had
been thinking only of you, and that you could live more comfortably and
happily elsewhere.But it seems that you were thinking of matters much
greater than your own.And that surprises me, and pleases me, and makes
me ashamed of my own view.My dear child, I think
you are superb.Only”--he spoke more slowly, and in a less confident
tone--“unfortunately, though it is wisdom to do the right thing, it
doesn’t always follow that it is easy, or successful for that matter.You will need to be very strong, in order to stand up straight under the
big task you have undertaken--very strong and resolute indeed.”

The touch of his hand upon her shoulder had been more to Jessica than
his words, the line of which, in truth, she had not clearly followed.And when he ended with his exhortation to robust bravery, she was
conscious of feeling weaker than for months before.The woman’s nature
that was in her softened under the gentle pressure of that strong hand,
and all the nameless feminine yearnings for wardenship and shelter from
life’s battle took voice and pleaded in her heart.he spoke
of her being strong, and the very sound of his voice unnerved her.She
could not think; there was no answer to be made to his words, for she
had scarcely heard them.No reply of any kind would come to her lips.In place of a mind, she seemed to have only a single sense--vast,
overpowering, glorious--and that was of his hand upon her shoulder.And
enwrapped, swallowed up in this sense, she stood silent.the hand was gone, and with a start her wits came back.The
lawyer was buttoning his overcoat, and saying that he must be going.She shook hands with him mechanically, in confused apprehension lest
she should think of nothing more to say to him before he departed.She
followed him to the hall, and opened the front door for him.On the
threshold the words she wanted came to her.“I will try to be strong,” she said, “and I thank you a thousand times
for coming.”

“Now, you will let me help you; you will come to me freely, won’t you?”
 Reuben said as he lifted his hat.“Good-by,” answered Jessica, slowly, as she closed the door.CHAPTER VIII.--THANKSGIVING AT THE LAWTONS’.The church-bells rang out next morning through a crisp and frosty air.A dazzling glare of reflected sunshine lay on the dry snow, but it
gave no suggestion of warmth.The people who passed on their way to
Thanksgiving services walked hurriedly, and looked as if their minds
were concentrated on the hope that the sexton had lighted the fire in
the church furnace the previous day.The milkman who stopped his sleigh
just beyond the house of the Law-tons had to beat off a great rim of
chalk-white ice with the dipper before he could open his can.The younger members of the Lawton family were not dependent upon
external evidences, however, for their knowledge that it was bitterly
cold.It was nearly noon when they began to gather in the kitchen, and
cluster about the decrepit old cooking-stove where burned the only fire
in the house.A shivering and unkempt group they made, in the bright
daylight, holding their red hands over the cracked stove-lids, and
snarling sulkily at the weather and one another when they spoke at all.Jessica had slept badly, and, rising early and dressing in self-defence
against the cold, had found her father in the act of lighting the
kitchen fire.An original impulse prompted her to kiss him when she
bade him good-morning; and Ben, rising awkwardly from where he had been
kneeling in front of the grate, looked both surprised and shamefacedly
gratified.It seemed ages since one of his daughters had kissed him
before.“It’s a regular stinger of a morning, ain’t it?” he said, blowing his
fingers.“The boards in the sidewalk jest riz up and went off under my
feet like pistols last night, when I was coming home.” He added with an
accent of uneasiness: “Suppose you didn’t hear me come in?”

He seemed pleased when she shook her head, and his face visibly
lightened.He winked at her mysteriously, and going over to a recess in
the wall, back of the woodbox, dragged out a lank and dishevelled turkey
of a dingy gray color, not at all resembling the fowls that had been
presented to him the previous day.“Trouble with me was,” he said, reflectively, “I shot four turkeys.If
I hadn’t been a bang-up shot, and had only killed one, why, I’d been
all right.But no, I couldn’t help hitting ’em, and so I got four.Of
course, I hadn’t any use for so many: so I got to raffling ’em off,
and that’s where my darned luck come in.” He held the bird up, and
turned it slowly around, regarding it with an amused chuckle.“You know
this cuss ain’t one of them I shot, at all.You see, I got to raffling,
and one time I stood to win nine turkeys and a lamp and a jag of
firewood.But then the thing kind o’ turned, and went agin me, and darn
me if I didn’t come out of the little end of the horn, with nothing but
this here.Sh-h!--M’rye’s coming.I told her I
earnt it carrying in some coal.”

Mrs.Lawton entered the room as her husband was putting back the
turkey.She offered no remarks beyond a scant “mornin’!” to Jessica, and
directed a scowl toward Lawton, before which he promptly disappeared.She replied curtly in the negative when Jessica asked if there was
anything she could do; but the novelty of the offer seemed to slowly
impress her mind, for after a time she began to talk of her own accord.Ben had come home drunk the night before, she said; there wasn’t
anything new in that, but it was decidedly new for him to bring
something to eat with him.He said he’d been carrying in coal, which was
her reason for believing he had been really shaving shingles or breaking
up old barrels.He couldn’t tell the truth if he tried--it wasn’t in
him not to lie.The worst of his getting drunk was he was so pesky
good-natured the next day.Her father used always to have a headache
under similar conditions, and make things peculiarly interesting for
everybody round about, from her mother at the helm of the boat to the
<DW65>-boy and the mule on the tow-path ahead.That was the way all
other men behaved, too: that is, all who were good for anything.But
Ben, he just grinned and did more chores than usual, and hung around
generally, as if everybody was bound to like him because he had made a
fool of himself.This monologue of information and philosophy was not delivered
consecutively, but came in disjointed and irrelevant instalments, spread
over a considerable space of time.There was nothing in it all which
suggested a reply, and Jessica did not even take the trouble to
listen very attentively.Her own thoughts were a more than sufficient
occupation.The failure of the experiment upon which she had ventured was looming
in unpleasant bulk before her.Every glance about her, every word which
fell upon her ears, furnished an added reason why she was not going to
be able to live on the lines she had laid out.Viewed even as a visit,
the experience was hateful.Contemplated as a career, it was simply
impossible.Rather than bear it, she would go back to Tecumseh or New
York; and rather than do this, she would kill herself.Too depressed to control her thoughts, much less to bend them definitely
upon consideration of some possible middle course between suicide and
existence in this house, Jessica sat silent at the back of the stove,
and suffered.Her evening here with her sisters seemed to blend in
retrospect with the sleepless night into one long, confused, intolerable
nightmare.They had scarcely spoken to her, and she had not known what
to say to them.For some reason they had chosen to stay indoors after
supper--although this was plainly not their habit--and under Samantha’s
lead had entered into a clumsy conspiracy to make her unhappy by
meaning looks, and causeless giggles, and more or less ingenious remarks
directed at her, but to one another.Lucinda had indeed seemed to shrink
from full communion with this cabal, but she had shown no overt act of
friendship, and the three younger girls had been openly hostile.Even
after she had taken refuge in her cold room, at an abnormally early
hour, her sense of their enmity and her isolation had been kept
painfully acute by their loud talk in the hall, and in the chamber
adjoining hers.Oh, no!--she was not even going to try to live with
them, she said resolutely and with set teeth to herself.They straggled into the kitchen now, and Lucinda was the only one of
them who said “good-morning” to her.Jessica answered her greeting
almost with effusion, but she would have had her tongue torn out rather
than allow it to utter a solitary first word to the others.They stood
about the stove for a time, and then sat down to the bare kitchen table
upon which the maternal slattern had spread a kind of breakfast.Jessica
took her place silently, and managed to eat a little of the bread,
dipped in pork fat.The coffee, a strange, greasy, light-brown fluid
without milk, she could not bring herself to touch.After this odious meal was over Samantha brought down a cheap novel, and
ensconced herself at the side of the stove, with her feet on a stick of
wood in the oven.The twins, after some protest, entered lazily upon
the task of plucking the turkey.Lucinda drew a chair to the window, and
began some repairs on her bonnet.For sheer want of other employment,
Jessica stood by the window for a time, looking down upon this crude
millinery.Then she diffidently asked to be allowed to suggest some
changes, and Lucinda yielded the chair to her; and her deft fingers
speedily wrought such a transformation in the work that the owner made
an exclamation of delight.At this the twins left their turkey to come
over and look, and even Samantha at last quitted the stove and sauntered
to the window with an exaggerated show of indifference.She looked on
for a moment, and then returned with a supercilious sniff, which scared
the twins also away.When the hat was finished, and Lucinda had tried it
on with obvious satisfaction, Jessica asked her to go for a little walk,
and the two went out together.There was a certain physical relief in escaping from the close and
evil-smelling kitchen into the keen, clear cold, but of mental comfort
there was little.The sister had nothing beyond a few commonplaces to
offer in the way of conversation, and Jessica was in no mood to create
small-talk.She walked vigorously forward as far as the sidewalks were
shovelled, indifferent to direction and to surroundings, and intent only
upon the angry and distracting thoughts which tore one another in her
mind.It was not until the drifts forced them to turn that she spoke.“I always dread to get downright mad: it makes me sick,” she exclaimed,
in defiant explanation to the dull Lucinda, who did not seem to have
enjoyed her walk.“If I was you, I wouldn’t mind ’em,” said the sister.“You just keep a stiff upper lip and tend to your own knitting, and
they’ll be coming around in no time to get you to fix their bonnets for
’em.I bet you Samanthy’ll have her brown plush hat to pieces, and be
bringing it to you before Sunday.”

“She’ll have to bring it to me somewhere else, then.To-day’s my last
day in _that_ house, and don’t you forget it!”

Jessica spoke with such vehemence that Lucinda could only stare at her
in surprise, and the town girl went excitedly on: “When I saw father
yesterday, I was almost glad I’d come back; and you--well, you’ve been
decent to me, too.But the rest--ah-h!--I’ve been swearing in my mind
every second since they came into the kitchen this morning.I started out crying at the dépôt, and I cried
the best part of last night; but I’ve got all through.If there’s got to be any more weeping, they’re the ones that’ll
do it!”

She ground her teeth together as she spoke, as if to prevent a further
outpouring of angry words.All at once she stopped, on some sudden
impulse, and looked her half-sister in the face.It was a long, intent
scrutiny, under which Lucinda flushed and fidgeted, but its result was
to soften Jessica’s mood.She resumed the walk again, but with a less
energetic step, and the hard, wrathful lines in her face had begun to
melt.“Probably there will be no need for any one else to weep,” she said,
ashamed of her recent outburst.“God knows, _I_ oughtn’t to want to make
anybody unhappy!” Then after a moment’s silence she asked: “Do you work
anywhere?”

“I’ve got a job at the Scotch-cap factory as long as it’s running.”

“How much can you earn there?”

“Three dollars a week is what I’m getting, but they’re liable to shut
down any time now.”

Jessica pondered upon this information for a little.Then she put
another question, with increased interest.“And do you like it at home,
with the rest of them, there?”

“Like it?Yes, about as much as a cat likes hot soap.It’s worse now a
hundred times than it was when you lit out.If there was any place to go
to, I’d be off like a shot.”

“Well, then, here’s what I wanted to ask you.When I leave it, what’s
the matter with your coming with me?And I’ll look after
you.” The girl’s revolt against her new and odious environment had
insensibly carried her back into the free phraseology of her former
life.As this was equally familiar to Lucinda’s factory-attuned ear, it
could not have been the slang expression at which she halted.But she
did stop, and in turn looked sharply into Jessica’s face.Her own cheeks,
red with exposure to the biting air, flushed to a deeper tint.“You
better ask Samantha, if that’s your game,” she said.“She’s more in your
line.I ain’t on that lay myself.”

Before Jessica had fairly comprehended the purport of this remark,
her sister had started briskly off by herself.The town girl stood
bewildered for a moment, with a little inarticulate moan of pained
astonishment trembling on her lips.Then she turned and ran after
Lucinda.“Wait a minute!” she panted out as she overtook her.“You didn’t
understand me.I wouldn’t for a million dollars have you think _that_ of
me.Please wait, and let me tell you what I really meant.You’ll break
my heart if you don’t!”

Thus adjured, Lucinda stopped, and consented to fall in with the other’s
slower step.She let it be seen plainly enough that she was a hostile
auditor, but still she listened.As Jessica, with a readier tongue than
she had found in Reuben Tracy’s presence the day before, outlined her
plan, the factory-girl heard her, first with incredulity, then with
inter-est, and soon with enthusiasm.You just bet I will!” was the form of her adhesion to the
plan, when it had been presented to her.The two young women extended their walk by tacit consent far beyond the
original intention, and it was past the hour set for the dinner when
they at last reluctantly entered the inhospitable-looking domicile.Its
shabby aspect and the meanness of its poverty-stricken belongings had
never seemed so apparent before to either of them, as they drew near to
it, but it was even less inviting within.They were warned that it would be so by their father, whom they
encountered just outside the kitchen door, chopping up an old plank for
firewood.Ben had put on a glaringly white paper collar, to mark his
sense of the importance of the festival, and the effect seemed to
heighten the gloom on his countenance.“There’s the old Harry to pay in there,” he said, nodding his head
toward the door.“Melissa’s come in from the farm to spend the day,
because she heard you was here, Jess, and somehow she got the idee you’d
bring a lot of dresses and fixings, and she wanted her share, and got
mad because there wasn’t any; and Samantha she pitched into her about
coming to eat up our dinner, and M’rye she took Melissa’s part, and so I
kind o’ sashayed out.They don’t need this wood any more’n a frog needs
a tail, but I’m going to whack ’er all up.”

The Thanksgiving dinner which shortly ensued had a solitary merit: it
did not last very long.But hurried as it was, Jessica did not sit
it out.The three sisters with whom she was not friendly had been
quarrelling, it seemed, with Melissa, the heavy-browed and surly girl
who worked out at the Fair-child farm, but all four combined in an
instant against the new-comers.Lucinda had never shone in repartee,
and, though she did not shrink from bearing a part in the conflict to
which she suddenly found herself a party, what she was able to say
only made matters worse.As for Jessica, she bit her lips in fierce
restraint, and for a long time said nothing at all.Melissa had formally
shaken hands with her, and had not spoken a word.When the thin turkey was put upon the table, and Mrs.Lawton had with
some difficulty mangled it into eight approximately equal portions, a
period of silence fell on the party--silence broken only by sounds of
the carnivora which are not expected at the banquets of the polite.Even this measly fowl, badly cooked and defiled by worse than tasteless
dressing though it was, represented a treat in the Lawton household, and
the resident members fell upon it with eager teeth.Melissa sniffed a
trifle at her portion, to let it be seen that they were better fed out
on the farm, but she ate vigorously none the less.It was only Jessica
who could summon no appetite, and who sat silent and sick at heart,
wearily striving at the pretence of eating in order not to attract
attention.She was conscious of hostile glances being cast upon her from
either side, but she kept her eyes as steadily as she could upon
her plate or on her father, who sat opposite and who smiled at her
encouragingly from time to time.It was one of the ungracious twins who first attained the leisure in
which to note Jessica’s failure to eat, and commented audibly upon the
difficulty of catering to the palates of “fine ladies.” The phrase was
instantly repeated with a sneering emphasis by Samantha, which was the
signal for a burst of giggling, in which Melissa joined.Then
Samantha, speaking very distinctly and with an ostentatious parade of
significance, informed Melissa that young Horace Boyce had returned to
Thessaly only the previous day, “on the very train which father
went down to meet.” This treatment of Melissa as a vehicle for the
introduction of disagreeable topics impressed the twins as a shrewd
invention, and one of them promptly added:

“Yes, M’liss’, and who do you think called here yesterday?He was there in the parlor for half an hour--pretty cold he
must have found it--but he wasn’t alone.”

“Oh, yes, we’re getting quite fashionable,” put in Samantha.“Father
ought to set out a hitching-post and a carriage-block, so that we can
receive our callers in style.I hope it will be a stone one, dad.”

“And so do I,” broke in Lucinda, angrily, “and then I’d like to see your
head pounded on it, for all it was worth.”

“Well, if it was,” retorted Samantha, “it would make a noise.And that’s
more than yours would.”

“You shut up!” shouted Ben Lawton, with the over-vehemence of a weak
nature in excitement.“Hain’t you got no decency nor compassion in ye?Can’t you give her a chance--to--to live
it down?”

While the echoes of this loud, indignant voice were still on the air,
Jessica had pushed her chair back, risen, and walked straight to the
door leading up-stairs.She looked at nobody as she passed, but held her
pale face proudly erect, though her lips were quivering.After she had opened the door, some words seemed to come to her, and she
turned.“Live it down!” she said, speaking more loudly than was her wont, to
keep her faltering voice from breaking.Why, father,
these people don’t want me to live at all!”

Then she closed the door and was seen no more that day.CHAPTER IX.--THE PARTNERSHIP.Either through the softening influence of the Thanksgiving festival
upon litigious natures, or by reason of the relaxing reaction from
over-feasting, it happened that no clients of any kind visited Reuben
Tracy’s law office next day.He came down early enough to light his own
fires in both the inner and outer rooms--an experience for which he had
been prepared by long observation of the effect produced by holidays
upon his clerk--and he sat for a couple of hours by the stove, with his
feet on the table and a book in his lap, waiting for Horace Boyce
to keep the appointment.The book was an old collection of Carlyle’s
earlier essays, and Reuben liked it better, perhaps, than any other
member of his library family.He had not read it through, and there was
a good deal in it which he seemed likely never to read.But there were
other portions, long since very familiar to his mind and eye, which it
was his habit to go over again whenever he had nothing else to do.The
rough, thought-compelling diction rested his brain, by some curious rule
of paradox.In the front of the volume he had written, “Not new books,
but good books,” an apothegm adapted from a preface of an old English
play which had pleased him.He was indolently ruminating on the wealth of epithet with which the
portrait of Cagliostro is painted, when his expected visitor arrived.He
laughed aloud at some whimsical conceit that this association of people
suggested, and tossed the book aside as he rose.“I’ve been killing time,” he said, still smiling, “by reading about the
prize impostor of the eighteenth century.You know it?--_The Diamond
Necklace_.For good, downright swindling and
effrontery there’s nothing anywhere like that fellow.”

Horace glanced at the book as he shook hands and took off his overcoat.He said nothing, but made a mental note that Reuben had come to know
about Carlyle after everybody else had ceased reading him.The two young men sat down together, and their talk for the first hour
or so was of business matters.Reuben made clear what his practice was
like, its dimensions, its profits, and its claims upon his time.The
railroad business had come to him through the influence of his old
friend Congressman Ansdell, of Tecumseh, and was very important.The farmers in the vicinity, too, had brought him the bulk of their
patronage in the matter of drawing deeds and mortgages--most frequently
the latter, he was sorry to say--because he was a farmer’s son.This
conveyancing work had grown to such proportions, and entailed such an
amount of consultation, that he had been more and more crowded out from
active court practice, which he was reluctant to abandon.This was his
reason for thinking of a partner.Then the conversation drifted into
discussion of Horace’s fitness for the place, and his proper share in
the earnings of the firm.They went over for dinner to the Dearborn
House, where Reuben lived, before this branch of the talk was concluded.Upon their return, over some cigars which Horace thought very bad, they
made more headway, and arrived at an understanding satisfactory to both.Reuben printed the firm name of “Tracy & Boyce” on a blotter, to see how
it would look, and Horace talked confidently of the new business which
the long connection of his family with Thessaly would bring to them.“You know, they’ve been here from the very beginning.My
great-grandfather was county judge here as far back as 1796, almost the
first one after the county was created.And his son, my great-uncle, was
congressman one term, and assemblyman for years; and another brother
was the president of the bank; and my grandfather was the rector of St.Matthew’s; and then my father being the best-known soldier Dearborn sent
out during the war--what I mean is, all this ought to help a good deal.It’s something to have a name that is as much a part of the place as
Thessaly itself.You see what I mean?”

Horace finished with an almost nervous query, for it had dawned upon him
that his companion might not share this high opinion of the value of an
old name and pedigree.Come to think of it, the Tracys were nobody in
particular, and he glanced apprehensively at Reuben’s large, placid face
for signs of pique.But there was none visible to the naked eye, and
Horace lighted a fresh cigar, and put his feet up on the table beside
those of his new partner.“I daresay there’s something in that,” Reuben remarked after a time.“Of
course there must be, and for that matter I guess a name goes for more
in our profession than it does anywhere else.I suppose it’s natural for
people to assume that jurisprudence runs in families, like snub-noses
and drink.” As soon as he had uttered this last word, it occurred to him
that possibly Horace might construe it with reference to his father, and
he made haste to add:

“I never told you, I think, about my own career.I don’t talk about
it often, for it makes a fellow sound like Mr.Bounderby in _Hard
Times_--the chap who was always bragging about being a self-made man.”

“No; I’d like to hear about it,” said Horace.“The first I remember of
you was at the seminary here.”

“Well, I was only fifteen years old then, and all the story I’ve got
dates before that.I can just remember when we moved into this part of
the world--coming from Orange County.My father had bought a small farm
some fifteen miles from here, over near Tyre, and we moved onto it in
the spring.I had an older brother, Ezra, and two
younger ones.There was a good deal of hard work to do, and father tried
to do it all himself, and so by harvest time he was laid up; and the men
who came and got in the crops on shares robbed us down to the ground.When winter came, father had to get up, whether he was well enough
or not, and chop wood for the market, to make up for the loss on
harvesting.One evening he didn’t come home, and the team was away
all night, too, with mother never going to bed at all, and then before
daybreak taking Ezra to carry a lantern, and starting through the drifts
for our patch of woods.They found my father dead in the forest, crushed
under a falling tree.“I suppose it was a terrible winter.I only dimly remember it, or the
summer that followed.When another winter was coming on, my mother grew
frightened.Try the best she knew how, she was worse off every month
than she had been the month before.To pay interest on the mortgage, she
had to sell what produce we had managed to get in, keeping only a bare
moiety for ourselves, and to give up the woodland altogether.Soon the
roads would be blocked; there was not enough fodder for what stock we
had, nor even food enough for us.We had no store of fuel, and no means
of staving off starvation.Under stern compulsion, solely to secure
a home for her boys, my mother married a well-to-do farmer in the
neighborhood--a man much older than herself, and the owner of a
hundred-acre farm and of the mortgages on our own little thirty acres.“I suppose he meant to be a just man, but he was as hard as a steel
bloom.He was a prodigious worker, and he made us all work, without
rest or reward.When I was nine years old, narrow-chested and physically
delicate, I had to get up before sunrise for the milking, and then work
all day in the hay-field, making and cocking, and obliged to keep ahead
of the wagon under pain of a flogging.Three years of this I had, and
I recall them as you might a frightful nightmare.I had some stray
schooling--my mother insisted upon that--but it wasn’t much; and I
remember that the weekly paper was stopped after that because Ezra and I
wasted too much time in reading it.My mother feared that I would die, and at
last gained the point of my being allowed to go to Tyre to school, if I
could earn my board and clothes there.I went through the long village
street there, stopping at every house to ask if they wanted a little
boy to do chores for his board and go to school.I said nothing about
clothes after the first few inquiries.It took me almost all day to
find a place.It was nearly the last house in the village.The people
happened to want a boy, and agreed to take me.I had only to take
care of two horses, milk four cows, saw wood for three stoves, and run
errands.When I lay awake in my new bed that night, it was with joy that
I had found such a kind family and such an easy place!“I went to school for a year, and learned something--not much, I
daresay, but something.Then I went back to the farm, alternating
between that and other places in Tyre, some better, some worse, until
finally I had saved eight dollars.Then I told my mother that I was
going to Thessaly seminary.She laughed at me--they all laughed--but in
the end I had my way.They fitted me out with some clothes--a vest of
Ezra’s, an old hat, trousers cut perfectly straight and much too short,
and clumsy boots two sizes too big for me, which had been bought by my
stepfather in wrath at our continual trouble in the winter to get on our
stiffened and shrunken boots.“I walked the first ten miles with a light heart.Then I began to grow
frightened.I had never been to Thessaly, and though I knew pretty well
from others that I should be well received, and even helped to find work
to maintain myself, the prospect of the new life, now so close at hand,
unnerved me.I remember once sitting down by the roadside, wavering
whether to go on or not.At last I stood on the brow of the hill, and
saw Thessaly lying in the valley before me.If I were to live a thousand
years, I couldn’t forget that sight--the great elms, the white buildings
of the seminary, the air of peace and learning and plenty which it all
wore.I tell you, tears came to my eyes as I looked, and more than once
they’ve come again, when I’ve recalled the picture.I remember, too,
that later on in the day old Dr.Burdick turned me loose in the library,
as it were There were four thousand books there, and the sight of them
took my breath away.I looked at them for a long time, I know, with my
mouth wide open.It was clear to me that I should never be able to read
them all--nobody, I thought, could do that--but at last I picked out a
set of the encyclopaedia at the end of the shelf nearest the door, and
decided to begin there, and at least read as far through the room as I
could.”

Reuben stopped here, and relighted his cigar.“That’s my story,” he said
after a pause, as if he had brought the recital up to date.“I should call that only the preface--or rather, the prologue,” said
Horace.“No; the rest is nothing out of the ordinary.I managed to live
through the four years here--peddling a little, then travelling for
a photographer in Tecumseh who made enlarged copies of old pictures
collected from the farm-houses, then teaching school.I studied law
first by myself, then with Ansdell at Tecumseh, and then one year in New
York at the Columbia Law School.I was admitted down there, and had a
fair prospect of remaining there, but I couldn’t make myself like New
York.It is too big; a fellow has no chance to be himself there.And so
I came back here; and I haven’t done so badly, all things considered.”

“No, indeed; I should think not!” was Horace’s hearty comment.“But I see the way now, I think,” continued Reuben, meditatively, “to
doing much better still.I see a good many ways in which you can help me
greatly.”

“I should hope so,” smiled young Mr.“That’s what I’m coming in
for.”

“I’m not thinking so much of the business,” answered Reuben; “there need
be no borrowing-of trouble about that.But there are things outside that
I want to do.I spoke a little about this the other day, I think.”

“You said something about going into politics,” replied Horace, not
so heartily.The notion had already risen in his mind that the junior
member of the new partnership might be best calculated to shine in the
arena of the public service, if the firm was to go in for that sort of
thing.not ‘politics’ in the sense you mean,” explained Reuben.“My
ambition doesn’t extend beyond this village that we’re in.I’m not
satisfied with it; there are a thousand things that we ought to be doing
better than we are, and I’ve got a great longing to help improve them.That is what has been in my mind ever
since my return.Strictly speaking,
‘politics’ ought to embrace in its meaning all the ways by which the
general good is served, and nothing else.But, as a matter of fact, it
has come to mean first of all the individual good, and quite often the
sacrifice of everything else.Unless
a man watches himself very closely, it is easy for him to grow to attach
importance to the honor and the profit of the place he holds, and
to forget its responsibilities.In that way you come to have a whole
community regarding an office as a prize, as a place to be fought for,
and not as a place to do more work in than the rest perform.This notion
once established, why, politics comes naturally enough to mean--well,
what it does mean.They merely
reflect the ideas of the public.If they didn’t, they couldn’t stand up
a minute by their own strength.You catch my idea?”

“Perfectly,” said Horace, politely dissembling a slight yawn.“Well, then, the thing to do is to get at the public mind--to get the
people into the right, way of regarding these things.It is no good
effecting temporary reforms in certain limited directions by outbursts
of popular feeling; for just as soon as the public indignation cools
down, back come the abuses.And so they will do inevitably until the
people get up to a calm, high level of intelligence about the management
of such affairs as they have in common.”

“Quite so,” remarked Horace.“Of course all this is trite commonplace,” continued Reuben.“You can
read it in any newspaper any day.It’s all well enough to say these things in a general way.Everybody
knows they are true; nobody disputes them any more than the
multiplication-table.But the exhortation does no good for that very
reason.Each reader says: ‘Yes, it’s too bad that my neighbors don’t
comprehend these things better;’ and there’s an end to the matter.Nothing is effected, because no particular person is addressed.Now, my
notion is that the way to do is to take a single small community, and go
at it systematically--a house-to-house canvass, so to speak--and labor
to improve its intelligence, its good taste, its general public attitude
toward its own public affairs.One can fairly count on at least some
results, going at it in that way.”

“No doubt,” said the junior partner, smiling faintly.“Well, then, I’ve got a scheme for a sort of society here--perhaps in
the nature of a club--made up of men who have an interest in the town
and who want to do good.I’ve spoken to two or three about it.Perhaps
it is your coming--I daresay it is--but all at once I feel that it is
time to start it.My notion is it ought to establish as a fundamental
principle that it has nothing to do with anything outside Thessaly and
the district roundabout.That is what we need in this country as much
as anything else--the habit of minding our own immediate business.The
newspapers have taught us to attend every day to what is going on in New
York and Chicago and London and Paris, and every other place under the
sun except our own.We have become like a gossiping
woman who spends all her time in learning what her neighbors are doing,
and lets the fire go out at home.Now, I like to think this can be
altered a good deal, if we only set to work at it.You have been abroad;
you have seen how other people do things, and have wider notions than
the rest of us, no doubt, as to what should be done.Does the idea attract you?”

Horace’s manner confessed to some surprise.“It’s a pretty large order,”
 he said at last, smilingly.“I’ve never regarded myself as specially
cut out for a reformer.Still, there’s a good deal in what you say.I
suppose it is practicable enough, when you come really to examine it.”

“At all events, we can try,” answered Reuben, with the glow of
earnestness shining on his face.“John Fairchild is almost as fond of
the notion as I am, and his paper will be of all sorts of use.Then,
there’s Father Chance, the Catholic priest, a splendid fellow, and Dr.Turner, and a number of others more or less
friendly to the scheme.I’m sure they will all feel the importance of
having you in it.Your having lived in Europe makes such a difference.You can see things with a new eye.”

Horace gave a little laugh.“What my new eye has seen principally so
far,” he said, with an amused smile running through his words, “is the
prevalence of tobacco juice.But of course there are hundreds of things
our provincial people could learn with profit from Europe.There,
for example, is the hideous cooking done at all the small places.In
England, for instance, it is a delight to travel in the country, simply
because the food is so good in the little rural inns; our country hotel
here is a horror.Then the roads are so bad here, when they might
be made so good.The farmer works out his road tax by going out and
ploughing up the highway, and you break your carriage-wheels in the task
of smoothing it down again.Porters to carry one’s luggage at railway
stations--that’s something we need, too.And the drinking of light beers
and thin, wholesome wines instead of whiskey--that would do a great
deal.Then men shouldn’t be allowed to build those ugly flat-topped
wooden houses, with tin eaves-troughs.No people can grow up to be
civilized who have these abominations thrust upon their sight daily.And--oh, I had forgotten!--there ought to be a penal law against those
beastly sulphur matches with black heads.I lit one by accident the
other night, and I haven’t got the smell of it out of my nostrils yet.”

Horace ended, as he had begun, with a cheerful chuckle; but his
companion, who sat looking abstractedly at the snow line of the roofs
opposite, did not smile.“Those are the minor things--the graces of life,” he said, speaking
slowly.“No doubt they have their place, their importance.But I am sick
at heart over bigger matters--over the greed for money, the drunkenness,
the indifference to real education, the neglect of health, the immodesty
and commonness of our young folks’ thought and intercourse, the
narrowness and mental squalor of the life people live all about me--”

“It is so everywhere, my dear fellow,” broke in Horace.“You are making
us worse by comparison than we are.”

“But we ought to be so infinitely better by comparison!And we have it
really in us to be better.Only nobody is concerned about the others;
there is no one to check the drift, to organize public feeling for its
own improvement.And that”--Reuben suddenly checked himself, and looked
at his new partner with a smile of wonderful sweetness--“that is what I
dream of trying to do.And you are going to help me!”

He rose as he spoke, and Horace, feeling his good impulses fired in a
vague way by his companion’s earnestness and confidence, rose also, and
stretched out his hand.“Be sure I shall do all I can,” he said, warmly, as the two shook hands.Boyce went down the narrow stairway by himself, a few
minutes later, having arranged that the partnership was to begin on
the approaching 1st of December, he really fancied himself as a
public-spirited reformer, whose life was to be consecrated to noble
deeds.He was conscious of an added expansion of breast as he buttoned
his fur coat across it, and he walked down the village street in a maze
of proud and pleasant reflections upon his own admirable qualities.Two or three weeks after the new sign of “Tracy & Boyce” had been hung
upon the outer walls of Thessaly it happened that the senior partner was
out of town for the day, and that during his absence the junior partner
received an important visit from Mr.Although this
gentleman was not a client, his talk with Horace was so long and
interesting that the young lawyer felt justified in denying himself to
several callers who were clients.Schuyler Tenney, who has a considerable part to play in this story,
did not upon first observations reveal any special title to prominence.To the cursory glance, he looked like any other of ten hundred hundreds
of young Americans who are engaged in making more money than they need.I speak of him as young because, though there was a thick sprinkling of
gray in his closely cut hair, and his age in years must have been above
rather than below forty, there was nothing in his face or dress or
bearing to indicate that he felt himself to be a day older than his
companion.He was a slender man, with a thin, serious face, cold gray
eyes, and a trim drab mustache.Under his creaseless overcoat he wore
neat gray clothes, of uniform pattern and strictly commercial aspect.He spoke with a quiet abruptness of speech as a rule, and both his rare
smiles and his occasional simulations of vivacity were rather obviously
artificial.Schuyler Tenney for even the first time, and
looking him over, you would not, it is true, have been surprised to hear
that he had just planted a dubious gold mine on the confiding
English capitalists, or made a million dollars out of a three-jointed
collar-button, or calmly cut out and carried off a railroad from under
the very guns of the Stock Exchange.If his appearance did not suggest
great exploits of this kind, it did not deny them once they were
hinted by others.But the chance statement that he had privately helped
somebody at his own cost without hope of reward would have given you a
distinct shock.Tenney was publicly known as one of the
smartest and most “go-ahead” young business men of Thessaly.Dim rumors
were upon the air that he was really something more than this; but as
the commercial agencies had long ago given him their feeble “A 1” of
superlative rating, and nothing definite was known about his outside
investments, these reports only added vaguely to his respectability.He
was the visible and actual head of the large wholesale hardware house of
“S.Tenney & Co.”

This establishment had before the war borne another name on the big sign
over its portals, that of “Sylvanus Boyce.” A year or two after the war
closed a new legend--“Boyce & Co.”--was painted in.Thus it remained
until the panic of 1873, when it underwent a transformation into “Boyce
& Tenney.” And now for some years the name of Boyce had disappeared
altogether, and the portly, redfaced, dignified General had dwindled
more and more into a position somewhere between the head book-keeper and
the shipping-clerks.He was still a member of the firm, however, and it
was apparently about this fact that Mr.He took a seat beside Horace’s desk, after shaking hands coldly with the
young man, and said without ceremony:

“I haven’t had a chance before to see you alone.It wouldn’t do to talk
over at the store--your father’s in and out all the while, more out than
in, by the way--and Tracy’s been here every day since you joined him.”

“He’s out of town to-day,” remarked Horace.Do you know that your father has
overdrawn his income account by nearly eleven thousand dollars, and that
the wrong side of his book hasn’t got room for more than another year
or so of that sort of thing?In fact, it wouldn’t last that long if I
wanted to be sharp with him.”

The words were spoken very calmly, but they took the color as by a flash
from Horace’s face.He swung his chair round, and, looking Tenney in the
eyes, seemed spell-bound by what he saw there.The gaze was sustained
between the two men until it grew to be like the experiment of two
school-children who try to stare each other down, and under its strain
the young lawyer felt himself putting forth more and more exertion to
hold his own.“I thought I would tell you,” added the hardware merchant, settling
himself back in the chair and crossing his thin legs, and seemingly
finding it no effort to continue looking his companion out of
countenance.“Yes, I thought you ought to know.I suppose he hasn’t said
anything to you about it.”

“Not a word,” answered Horace, shifting his glance to the desk before
him, and striving with all his might to get his wits under control.The last thing he ever wants to talk about is
business, least of all his own.They tell a story about a man who used
to say, ‘Thank God, that’s settled!’ whenever he got a note renewed.He
must have been a relation of the General’s.”

“It’s Sheridan that that’s ascribed to,” said Horace, for the sake of
saying something.“What, ‘Little Phil’?I thought he had more sense.”

There was something in this display of ignorance which gave Horace
the courage to face his visitor once more.“Nobody knows better than you do,” he said, finding increased
self-control with every word, now that the first excitement was over,
“that a great deal of money has been made in that firm of yours.I
shall be glad to investigate the conditions under which the business has
contrived to make you rich and your partner poor.”

Mr.Tenney seemed disagreeably surprised at this tone.“Don’t talk
nonsense,” he said with passing asperity.“Of course you’re welcome.If a man makes four thousand dollars and spends
seven thousand dollars, what on earth has his partner’s affairs to
do with it?I live within my income and attend to my business, and he
doesn’t do either.That’s the long and short of it.”

The two men talked together on this subject for a considerable time,
Horace alternating between expressions of indignation at the fact that
his father had become the unedifying tail of a concern of which he once
was everything, and more or less ingenious efforts to discover what way
out of the difficulty, if any, was offered.Tenney remained unmoved
under both, and at last coolly quitted the topic altogether.“You ought to do well here,” he said, ignoring a point-blank question
about how General Boyce’s remaining interest could be protected.“Thessaly’s going to have a regular boom before long.You’ll see this
place a city in another year or two.We’ve got population enough now,
for that matter, only it’s spread out so.How did you come to go in with
Tracy?”

“Why shouldn’t I?He’s the best man here, and starting alone is the
slowest kind of slow work.”

Mr.Tenney smiled a little, and put the tips of his fingers together
gently.“Tracy and I don’t hitch very well, you know,” he said.“I took a
downright fancy to him when I first came in from Sidon Hill, but he’s
such a curious, touchy sort of fellow.I asked him one day what church
he’d recommend me to join; of course I was a stranger, and explained to
him that what I wanted was not to make any mistake, but to get into the
church where there were the most respectable people who would be of use
to me; and what do you think he said?He was huffed about it--actually
mad!He said he’d rather have given me a hundred dollars than had me ask
him that question; and after that he was cool, and so was I, and we’ve
never had much to say to each other since then.Of course, there’s no
quarrel, you know.Only it strikes me he’ll be a queer sort of man to
get along with.A lawyer with cranks like that--why, you never know what
he’ll do next.”

“He’s one of the best fellows alive,” said Horace, with sharp emphasis.“Why, of course he is,” replied Mr.“But that isn’t business.Take the General, for instance; he’s a good fellow, too--in a different
kind of way, of course--and see where it’s landed him.Look out for him and you are all right.Tracy might be making
five or six times as much as he is, if he went the right way to work.He
does more business and gets less for it than any other lawyer in town.There’s no sense in that.”

“Upon my word, Mr.Tenney,” said Horace, after a moment’s pause, in
which he deliberately framed what he was going to say, “I find it
difficult to understand why you thought it worth while to come here at
all to-day: it surely wasn’t to talk about Tracy; and the things I want
to know about my father you won’t discuss.What I see is this: that you were a
private in the regiment my father was colonel of; that he made you a
sort of adjutant, or something in the nature of a clerk, and so lifted
you out of the ranks; that during the war, when your health failed, he
gave you a place in his business here at home, which lifted you out of
the farm; that a while later he made you a partner; and that gradually
the tables have been completely turned, until you are the colonel and
he is the private, you are rich and he is nearly insolvent.That is what
the thing sums up to in my mind.Have you come to tell me that now you are going to be good to
him?”

“Good God!Haven’t I been good to him?” said Tenney, with real
indignation.“Couldn’t I have frozen him out eighteen months ago instead
of taking up his overdrafts at only ten per cent, charge so as to keep
him along?There isn’t one man in a hundred who would have done for him
what I have.”

“I am glad to hear it,” replied the young man.“If the proportion was much larger, I am afraid this would be a very
unhappy world to live in.”

Mr.He had not clearly grasped the
meaning of this remark, but instinct told him that it was hostile.You may take it that way, if you like.” He rose as he spoke
and began buttoning his overcoat.“Only let me say this: when the smash
comes, you can’t say I didn’t warn you.If you won’t listen to me,
that’s _your_ lookout.”

“But I haven’t done anything but listen to you for the last two hours,”
 said Horace, who longed to tell his visitor to go to the devil, and yet
was betrayed into signs of anxiety at the prospect of his departure.“If
you’ll remember, you haven’t told me anything that I asked for.Heaven
knows, I should be only too glad to listen, if you’ve got anything to
say.”

Mr.Tenney made a smiling movement with his thin lips and sat down
again.“I thought you would change your tune,” he said, calmly.Horace offered
a gesture of dissent, to which the hardware merchant paid no attention.He had measured his man, and decided upon a system of treatment.“What
I really wanted,” he continued, “was to look you over and hear you talk,
and kind of walk around you and size you up, so to speak.You see I’ve
only known you as a youngster--better at spending money than at making
it.Now that you’ve started as a lawyer, I thought I’d take stock of you
again, don’t you see; and the best way to sound you all around was to
talk about your father’s affairs.”

Horace was conscious of a temptation to be angry at this cool statement,
but he did not yield to it.“Then it isn’t true--what you have told me?”
 he asked.“Well, yes, it is, mostly,” answered Mr.Tenney, again contemplating his
joined finger-tips.“But it isn’t of so much importance compared with
some other things.There’s bigger game afoot than partnerships in
hardware stores.”

Horace gave a little laugh of mingled irritation and curiosity.“What
the devil _are_ you driving at, Tenney?” he said, and swung his chair
once more to face his visitor.This time the two men eyed each other more sympathetically, and the
tones of the two voices lost something of their previous reserve.Tenney himself resumed the conversation with an air of direct candor:

“I heard somebody say you rather counted on getting some of the Minster
iron-works business.”

“Well, the fact is, I may have said I hoped to, but nothing definite has
been settled.The ladies are friends of mine: we came up from New York
together last month; but nothing was decided.”

“I see,” said Mr.Tenney, and Horace felt uneasily, as he looked into
those sharp gray eyes, that no doubt they did see very clearly.There’s no harm in that, only
it’s no good to gas with me, for there’s some solid business to be
done--something mighty promising for both of us.”

“Of course I’ve no notion what you mean,” said Horace.“But it’s just
as well to clear up the ground as we go along.The first experiment of
yoking up Boyces and Tenneys together hasn’t turned out so admirably as
to warrant me--What shall I say?”

“As to warrant you going in with your eyes shut.” Mr.Tenney supplied
the lacking phrase with evident enjoyment.On the contrary, what I want of you is to have your eyes peeled
particularly wide open.But, first of all, Tracy mustn’t hear a breath
of this whole thing.”

“Then go no further, I beg of you.I sha’n’t touch it.”

“Oh, yes, you will,” said Mr.“He
has his own private business.The railroad work, for
example: you don’t share in that.That is his own, and quite right, too.But that very fact leaves you free, doesn’t it, to go into speculations
on your own account?”

“Speculations--yes, perhaps.”

“No ‘perhaps’ about it; of course it does.At least, you can hear what
I have to say without telling him, whether you go into the thing or not;
do you promise me that?”

“I don’t think I wish to promise anything,” said Horace, doubtingly.If you won’t deal, you won’t; and I must protect myself my
own way.” Mr.Tenney did not rise and again begin buttoning his coat,
nor was it, indeed, necessary.There had been menace enough in his tone
to effect his purpose.“Very well, then,” answered Horace, in a low voice; “if you insist, I
promise.”

“I shall know within half an hour if you do tell him,” said Mr.Tenney,
in his most affable manner; “but of course you won’t.”

“Of course I won’t!” snapped Horace, testily.The first thing, then, is to put the
affairs of the Minster women into your hands.”

Horace took his feet off the table, and looked in fixed surprise at
his father’s partner.“How--what do you mean?” he stammered at last,
realizing, even as he spoke, that there were certain strange depths in
Mr.Tenney’s eyes which had been dimly apparent at the outset, and then
had been for a long time veiled, and were now once more discernible.“How do you mean?”

“It can be fixed, as easy as rolling off a log.Old Clarke has gone to
Florida for his health, and there’s going to be a change made.A word
from me can turn the whole thing over to you.”

“A word from you!” Horace spoke with incredulity, but he did not really
doubt.There was a revelation of reserve power in the man’s glance that
fascinated him.“That’s what I said.The question is whether I shall speak it or not.”

“To be frank with you”--Horace smiled a little--“I hope very much that
you will.”

“I daresay.But have you got the nerve for it?--that’s the point.Can
you keep your mouth shut, and your head clear, and will you follow me
without kicking or blabbing?That’s what I want to know.”

“And that’s just what I can’t tell you.I’m not going to bind myself
to do unknown things.” Horace said this bravely enough, but the shrewd,
listening ear understood very well the lurking accent of assent.“You needn’t bind yourself to anything, except to tell Tracy nothing
till I give you the word, and then only what we shall agree upon.Of
course, later on he will have to know something about it.And mind, mum’s the word.” Mr.Tenney rose now, not tentatively,
but as one who is really going.Horace sprang to his feet as well, and
despite the other’s declaration that he was pressed for time, and had
already stayed too long, insisted on detaining him.“What I don’t understand in all this,” he said, hurriedly--“for that
matter the whole thing is a mystery--but what I particularly fail to see
is your object in benefiting me.You tell me
that you have got my father in a hole, and then you offer me a great and
substantial prize.You are not the man to
do things for nothing.What you haven’t told me is what there is in this
affair for you.”

Mr.Tenney seemed complimented by this tribute to his commercial sense
and single-mindedness.“No, I haven’t told you,” he said, buttoning his
coat.“That’ll come in due time.All you’ve got to do meanwhile is to
keep still, and to take the thing when it comes to you.Let me know
at once, and say nothing to any living soul--least of all Tracy--until
you’ve talked with me.That oughtn’t to be hard.”

“And suppose I don’t like the conditions?”

“Then you may lump them,” said Schuyler Ten, ney, disclosing his small
teeth again in a half-smile, as he made his way out.MINSTER’S NEW LEGAL ADVISER.Horace Boyce, on returning home one evening,
found on his table a note which had been delivered during the day by
a servant.Minster--“Desideria Minster” she signed
herself--asking him to call upon her the following afternoon.The young
man read the missive over and over again by the lamplight, and if it
had been a love-letter from the daughter instead of the polite business
appointment by the mother, his eyes couldn’t have flashed more eagerly
as he took in the meaning of its words.He thought long upon that, ruminating in his
easy-chair before the fire until far past midnight, until the dainty
little Japanese saucer at his side was heaped up with cigar ashes, and
the air was heavy with smoke.Evidently this summons was directly connected with the remarks made by
Tenney a fortnight before.He had said the Minster business should come
to him, and here it was.Minster wrote to him at his
residence, rather than at his office, was proof that she too wished to
have him alone, and not the firm of Tracy & Boyce, as her adviser.That
there should be this prejudice against Reuben, momentarily disturbed the
young man; but, upon examination, he found it easy to account for it.Reuben was very nice--his partner even paused for a moment to reflect
how decent a fellow Reuben really was--but then, he scarcely belonged to
the class of society in which people like the Boyces and Minsters moved.Naturally the millionnaire widow, belonging as she did to an ancient
family in the Hudson River valley, and bearing the queer name of a
grandmother who had been a colonial beauty, would prefer to have as her
family lawyer somebody who also had ancestors.The invitation had its notable social side, too.There was no good
in blinking the fact that his father the General--who had effected a
somewhat noisy entrance to the house a half-hour ago, and the sound
of whose burdened breathing now intermittently came to his ears in the
silence of the night--had allowed the family status to lapse.The Boyces
were not what they had been.In the course of such few calls as he had
made since his return, it had been impossible for him not to detect
the existence of a certain surprise that he should have called at all.Everybody, too, had taken pains to avoid reference to his father, even
when the course of talk made such allusion natural.This had for the
moment angered the young man, and later had not a little discouraged
him.As a boy he had felt it a great thing to be the son of a general,
and to find it now to be a distinct detriment was disheartening indeed.But this black-bordered, perfumed note from Mrs.Minster put all, as
by the sweep of a hand, into the background.Once he visited that
proud household as a friend, once he looked Thessaly in the face as
the confidential adviser of the Minster family, the Boyces were
rehabilitated.To dwell upon the thought was very pleasant, for it led the way by
sweetly vagrant paths to dreams of the dark-eyed, beautiful Kate.During the past month these visions had lost color and form under the
disconcerting influences just spoken of, but now they became, as if by
magic, all rosy-hued and definite again.He had planned to himself on
that first November day a career which should be crowned by marriage
with the lovely daughter of the millions, and had made a mental march
around the walls encompassing her to spy out their least defended point.Now, all at once, marvellous as it seemed, he found himself transported
within the battlements.He was to be her mother’s lawyer--nay, _her_
lawyer as well, and to his sanguine fancy this meant everything.It meant one of the most beautiful
women he had ever seen as his wife--a lady well-born, delicately
nurtured, clever, and good; it meant vast wealth, untold wealth, with
which to be not only the principal personage of these provincial parts,
but a great figure in New York or Washington or Europe.He might be
senator in Congress, minister to Paris, or even aspire to the towering,
solitary eminence of the Presidency itself with the backing of these
millions.It meant a yacht, the very dream of sea-going luxury and
speed, in which to bask under Hawaiian skies, to loiter lazily along the
topaz shores of far Cathay, to flit to and fro between spice lands and
cold northern seas, the whole watery globe subject to her keel.Why,
there could be a castle on the Moselle, a country house in Devonshire,
a flat in Paris, a villa at Mentone, a summer island home on the St.Lawrence, a mansion in New York--all together, if he liked, or as many
as pleased his whim.It might be worth the while to lease a shooting in
Scotland, only the mischief was that badly bred Americans, the odious
_nouveaux riches_, had rather discredited the national name in the
Highlands.So the young man’s fancies floated on the wreaths of scented smoke till
at last he yawned in spite of himself, sated with the contemplation of
the gifts the gods had brought him.Minster’s note once
again before he went to bed, and sleep overtook his brain while it was
still pleasantly musing on the choicest methods of expending the income
of her millions.Curiously enough, during all these hours of happy castle-building, the
question of why Schuyler Tenney had interested himself in the young
man’s fortunes never once crossed that young man’s mind.To be frank,
the pictures he painted were all of “gentlemen” and “ladies,” and his
father’s partner, though his help might be of great assistance at
the outset, could scarcely expect to mingle in such company, even in
Horace’s tobacco reveries.Neither to his father at the breakfast-table, nor to Reuben Tracy at
the office, did young Mr.Boyce next day mention the fact that he was to
call on Mrs.This enforced silence was not much to his liking,
primarily because his temperament was the reverse of secretive.When
he had done anything or thought of doing something, the impulse to tell
about it was always strong upon him.The fact that the desire to talk
was not rigorously balanced by regard for the exact and prosaic truth
may not have been an essential part of the trait when we come to
analysis, but garrulity and exaggeration ran together in Horace’s
nature.To repress them now, just at the time when the most important
event of his life impended, required a good deal of effort.He had some qualms of conscience, too, so far as Reuben was concerned.Two or three things had happened within the past week which had laid
him under special obligation to the courtesy and good feeling of his
partner.They were not important, perhaps, but still the memory of them
weighed upon _his_ mind when, at three o’clock, he put on his coat and
explained that he might not be back again that afternoon.Reuben nodded,
and said, “All right: I shall be here.If so-and-so comes, I’ll go over
the matter and make notes for you.” Then Horace longed very much to tell
all about the Minster summons and the rest, and this longing arose as
much from a wish to be frank and fair as from a craving to confide his
secret to somebody; but he only hesitated for a second, and then went
out.Minster received him in the chamber which had been her husband’s
working room, and which still contained his desk, although it had since
been furnished with book-shelves and was called the library.Horace
noted, as the widow rose to greet him, that, though the desk was open,
its pigeon-holes did not seem to contain many papers.After his hostess had bidden him to be seated, and had spoken in mildly
deprecating tones about the weather, she closed her resolutely lined
lips, folded her hands in her lap, and looked at him in amiable
suspense.Minster’s dark face, with its
high frame of white hair and its bright black eyes, habitually produced
an impression of great cleverness and alert insight, and Horace was
conscious of embarrassment in finding the task of conversation devolved
upon himself.He took up the burden, however, and carried it along from
subject to subject until at last it seemed fitting to broach the great
topic.“I didn’t get your note until evening,” he said, with a polite inquiring
smile.“No, I didn’t send it until after dinner,” she replied, and a pause
ensued.It fortunately occurred to Horace to say he was very glad to have her
call upon him always, if in any way she saw how he could serve her.As
he spoke these words, he felt that they were discreet and noncommittal,
and yet must force her to come to the point.“It is very kind of you, I’m sure,” she said, graciously, and came to a
full stop.“If there is anything I can do now,” Horace remarked tentatively.What I wanted to ask you was, do you know the Wendovers?”

“I don’t think I do.” murmured the young man, with a great sinking of
the heart.“They’re New York people,” the lady explained.“I know almost nobody in New York,” answered Horace gloomily.No, I am quite sure the name is new to me.”

“That is curious,” said Mrs.She took a letter up from the
desk.“This is from Judge Wendover, and it mentions you.I gathered from
it that he knew you quite well.”

Oh, shades of the lies that might have been told, if one had only known!Horace swiftly ransacked his brain for a way out of this dilemma.Evidently this letter bore upon his selection as her lawyer.He guessed
rightly that it had been written at Tenney’s suggestion and by some one
who had Mrs.Obviously this some one was of the
legal profession.“The name does sound familiar, on second thought,” he said.“I daresay
it is, if I could only place it.You see, I had a number of offers to
enter legal firms in New York, and in that way I saw a good many people
for a few minutes, you know, and quite probably I’ve forgotten some of
their names.They would remember me, of course, but I might confuse them
one with another, don’t you see?Strange, I don’t fix the man you mean.Was he a middle-aged man, grayish hair, well dressed?”

“Yes, that describes him.” She did not add that it would equally
describe seven out of every ten other men called “judge” throughout the
United States.“Now I place him,” said Horace triumphantly.“There was some talk of
my going into his office as a junior partner.Mutual friends of ours
proposed it, I remember.Curious that I should
have forgotten his name.One’s memory plays such whimsical tricks,
though.”

“I didn’t know Judge Wendover was practising law,” said Mrs.“He never was much of a lawyer.He was county judge once down in
Peekskill, about the time I was married, but he didn’t get reelected;
and I thought he gave it all up when he went to New York.”

“If it’s the man I mean,” put in Horace, groping his way despairingly,
“there wasn’t much business in his office.That is why I didn’t go in, I
daresay: it wouldn’t be worth my while unless he himself was devoted to
the law, and carried on a big practice.”

“I daresay it’s the same man,” remarked Mrs.“He probably
_would_ have a kind of law office.They generally do.”

“Well, may I ask,” Horace ventured after another pause, “in what
connection he mentions my name?”

“He recommends me to consult you about affairs--to--well, how shall I
say it?--to make you my lawyer?”

Eureka!The words were out, and the difficult passage about Judge
What’s-his-name was left safely behind.Horace felt his brain swimming
on a sea of exaltation, but he kept his face immobile, and bowed his
head with gravity.“I am very young for so serious a responsibility, I’m afraid,” he said
modestly.“There isn’t really much to do,”
 she answered.“And somebody would have to learn what there is; and
you can do that as well as any one else, better than a stranger.The
difficulty is,” she spoke more slowly, and Horace listened with all his
ears: “you have a partner, I’m told.”

The young man did not hesitate for an instant.“Only in a limited way,”
 he replied.Tracy and I have combined on certain lines of work
where two heads are better than one, but we each keep distinct our own
private practice.It is much better.”

“I certainly prefer it,” said Mrs.“I am glad to hear you keep
separate.Tracy, and, indeed, he is very highly spoken
of as a _lawyer_; but certain things I have heard--social matters, I
mean--”

The lady broke off discreetly.She could not tell this young man what
she had heard about that visit to the Lawton house.Horace listened to
her without the remotest notion of her meaning, and so could only smile
faintly and give the least suggestion of a sigh.“We can’t have everything in this world just to our minds,” he said
judicially, and it seemed to him to cover the case with prudent
vagueness.“I suppose you thought the partnership would be a good thing?” she
asked.“At the time--_yes_,” answered Horace.“And, to be fair, it really has
some advantages.Tracy is a prodigious worker, for one thing, and
he is very even-tempered and willing; so that the burden of details
is taken off my shoulders to a great extent, and that disposes one to
overlook a good many things, you know.”

Mrs.She also knew what it was to delight
in relief from the burden of details, and she said to herself that
fortunately Mr.Boyce would thus have the more leisure to devote the
affairs of the Minsters.Into their further talk it is not needful to pursue the lady and her
lawyer.She spoke only in general terms, outlining her interests and
investments which required attention, and vaguely defining what she
expected him to do.Horace listened very closely, but beyond a nebulous
comprehension of the existence of a big company and a little company,
which together controlled the iron-works and its appurtenances, he
learned next to nothing.One of the first things which she desired of
Horace was, however, that he should go to Florida and talk the whole
subject over with Mr.Clarke, and to this he gladly assented.“I will write to him that you are coming,” she said, as she rose.“I may
tell you that he personally preferred Mr.Tracy as his successor; but,
as I have told you--well, there were reasons why--”

Horace made haste to bow and say “quite so,” and thus spare Mrs.“Perhaps it will be better to say nothing
to any one until I have returned from Florida,” he added, as a parting
suggestion, and it had her assent.The young man walked buoyantly down the gravel path and along the
streets, his veins fairly tingling with excitement and joy.The great
prize had come to him--wealth, honor, fame, were all within his grasp.He thought proudly, as he strode along, of what he would do after his
marriage.Even the idea of hyphenating the two names in the English
fashion, Minster-Boyce, came into his mind, and was made welcome.Perhaps, though, it couldn’t well be done until his father was dead; and
that reminded him--he really must speak to the General about his loose
behavior.Thus Horace exultantly communed with his happy self, and formed
resolutions, dreamed dreams, discussed radiant probabilities as he
walked, until his abstracted eye was suddenly, insensibly arrested by
the sight of a familiar sign across the street--“S.Tenney & Co.” Then
for the first time he remembered his promise, and the air grew colder
about him as he recalled it.He crossed the road after a moment’s
hesitation, and entered the hardware store.Tenney was alone in the little office partitioned off by wood and
glass from the open store.He received the account given by Horace of
his visit to the Minster mansion with no indication of surprise, and
with no outward sign of satisfaction.“So far, so good,” he said, briefly.Then, after a moment’s meditation,
he looked up sharply in the face of the young man, who was still
standing: “Did you say anything about your terms?”

“Of course not.You don’t show price-lists like a
storekeeper, in the _law!_”

Mr.Tenney smiled just a little at Horace’s haughty tone--a smile of
furtive amusement.“It’s just as well,” he said.“I’ll talk with you
about that later.The old lady’s rather close-fisted.We may make a
point there--by sending in bills much smaller than old Clarke’s used to
be.Luckily it wasn’t needed.”

The matter-of-fact way in which Mr.Tenney used this “we” grated
disagreeably on the young man’s ear, suggesting as it did a new
partnership uncomfortably vague in form; but he deemed it wise not to
touch upon the subject.His next question, as to the identity of Judge
Wendover, brought upon the stage, however, still a third partner in the
shadowy firm to which he had committed himself.“Oh, Wendover’s in with us.He’s all right,” replied Schuyler Tenney,
lightly.He’s the president of the Thessaly
Manufacturing Company.You’ll hear a good deal about _that_ later on.”
 The speaker showed his teeth again by a smiling movement of the lips at
this assurance, and Horace somehow felt his uneasiness growing.“She wants me to go to Florida to see Clarke, and talk things over,” he
said.We must consider all that very carefully
before you go.I’ll think
out what you are to tell him.”

Horace was momentarily shrinking in importance before his own mental
vision; and, though he resented it, he could not but submit.“I suppose
I’d better make some other excuse to Tracy about the Florida trip,” he
said, almost deferentially; “what do you think?”

“Oh, you think so, do you?” Mr.Tenney was interested, and made a
renewed scrutiny of the young man’s face.I’ll think about
it, and let you know to-morrow.Look in about this time, and don’t say
anything till then.So long!”

Thus dismissed, Horace took his leave, and it was not until he had
nearly reached his home that the thoughts chasing each other in his mind
began to take on once more roseate hues and hopeful outlines.Tenney watched his partner’s son through the partition until he was
out of sight, and then smiled at the papers on his desk in confidence.“He’s ready to lie at a minute’s notice,” he mused; “offered on his own
hook to lie to Tracy.That’s all right--only he mustn’t try it on with
me!”




CHAPTER XII.--THE THESSALY CITIZENS’ CLUB.The village of Thessaly took no pains to conceal the fact that it was
very proud of itself.What is perhaps more unique is that the farming
people round about, and even the smaller and rival hamlets scattered
through the section, cordially recognized Thessaly’s right to be proud,
and had a certain satisfaction in themselves sharing that pride.Lest this should breed misconception and paint a more halcyon picture of
these minor communities than is deserved, let it be explained that they
were not without their vehement jealousies and bickerings among one
another.Often there arose between them sore contentions over questions
of tax equalization and over political neglects and intrigues; and
here, too, there existed, in generous measure, those queer parochial
prejudices--based upon no question whatever, and defying alike inquiry
and explanation--which are so curious a heritage from the childhood days
of the race.No long-toed brachycephalous cave-dweller of the stone
age could have disliked the stranger who hibernated in the holes on
the other side of the river more heartily than the people of Octavius
disliked those of Sidon.In the hop-picking season the young men of
these two townships always fell to fighting when they met, and their
pitched conflicts in and around the Half-way House near Tyre, when
dances were given there in the winter, were things to talk about
straight through until hoeing had begun in the spring.There were many
other of these odd and inexplicable aversions--as, for instance, that
which had for many years impelled every farmer along the whole length of
the Nedahma Creek road to vote against any and all candidates nominated
from Juno Mills, a place which they scarcely knew and had no earthly
reason for disliking.But in such cases no one asked for reasons.Matters simply stood that way, and there was nothing more to be said.Neighbors took almost as much
pleasure in boasting of its wealth and activity, and prophesying its
future greatness, as did its own sons.The farmers when they came in
gazed with gratified amazement at the new warehouses, the new chimneys,
the new factory walls that were rising everywhere about them, and
returned more satisfied than ever that “Thessaly was just a-humming
along.” Dearborn County had always heretofore been a strictly
agricultural district, full of rich farm-lands and well-to-do
farm-owners, and celebrated in the markets of New York for the
excellence of its dairy products.Now it seemed certain that Thessaly
would soon be a city, and it was already a subject for congratulation
that the industries which were rooting, sprouting, or bearing fruit
there had given Dearborn County a place among the dozen foremost
manufacturing shires in the State.The farmers were as pleased over this as any one else.It was true that
they were growing poorer year by year; that their lands were gradually
becoming covered with a parchment film of mortgages, more deadly than
sorrel or the dreaded black-moss; that the prices of produce had gone
down on the one hand as much as the cost of living and of labor had
risen on the other; that a rich farmer had become a rarity in a district
which once was controlled by the princes of herds and waving fields:
but all the same the agriculturists of Dearborn County were proud of
Thessaly, of its crowds of foreign-born operatives, its smoke-capped
chimneys, and its noisy bustle.They marched almost solidly to the polls
to vote for the laws which were supposed to protect its industries, and
they consoled themselves for falling incomes and increased expenditure
by roseate pictures of the great “home market” which Thessaly was to
create for them when it became a city.For many years it had been
scarcely known to the outside world save as the seat of a seminary of
something more than local repute.This institution still nestled under
the brow of the hill whence the boy Reuben Tracy had looked with fondly
wistful vision down upon it, but it was no longer of much importance.It
was yet possible to discern in the quiet streets immediately adjoining
the seminary enclosure, with their tall arched canopies of elm-boughs,
and old-fashioned white houses with verandas and antique gardens, some
remains of the academic character that this institution had formerly
imparted to the whole village.But the centre of activity and of
population had long since moved southward, and around this had grown up
a new Thessaly, which needed neither elms nor gardens, which had use for
its children at the loom or the lathe when the rudiments of the common
school were finished, and which alike in its hours of toil and of
leisure was anything rather than academie.I suppose that in this modern Thessaly, with its factories and mills,
its semi-foreign saloons, and its long streets of uniformly ugly cottage
dwellings, there were many hundreds of adults who had no idea whether
the once-famous Thessaly seminary was still open or not.If Thessaly had had the time and inclination for a serious study of
itself, this decadence of the object of its former pride might have
awakened some regret.The seminary, which had been one of the first in
the land to open its doors to both sexes, had borne an honorable part in
the great agitation against slavery that preceded the war.Some of its
professors had been distinguished abolitionists--of the kind who strove,
suffered, and made sacrifices when the cause was still unpopular,
yet somehow fell or were edged out of public view once the cause had
triumphed and there were rewards to be distributed, and they had taken
the sentiment of the village with them in those old days.Then there
was a steady demand upon the seminary library, which was open to
householders of the village, for good books.Then there was maintained
each winter a lecture course, which was able, not so much by money as by
the weight and character of its habitual patrons, to enrich its annual
lists with such names as Emerson, Burritt, Phillips, Curtis, and
Beecher.At this time had occurred the most sensational episode in the
history of the village--when the rumor spread that a runaway <DW64> was
secreted somewhere about the seminary buildings, and a pro-slavery crowd
came over from Tyre to have him out and to vindicate upon the persons of
his protectors the outraged majesty of the Fugitive Slave law, and the
citizens of Thessaly rose and chased back the invaders with celerity and
emphasis.But all this had happened so long ago that it was only vaguely
remembered now.There were those who still liked to recall those
days and to tell stories about them, but they had only themselves for
listeners.The new Thessaly was not precisely intolerant of the history
of this ante-bellum period, but it had fresher and more important
matters to think of; and its customary comment upon these legends of the
slow, one-horse past was, “Things have changed a good deal since then,”
 offered with a smile of distinct satisfaction.Stephen Minster’s enterprise in opening up the
iron fields out at Juno, and in building the big smelting-works on the
outskirts of Thessaly, had altered everything.The branch road to the
coal district which he called into existence lifted the village at once
into prominence as a manufacturing site.Other factories were erected
for the making of buttons, shoes, Scotch-caps, pasteboard boxes,
matches, and a number of varieties of cotton cloths.When this last
industry appeared in the midst of them, the people of Thessaly found
their heads fairly turned.This period of industrial progress, of which I speak with, I hope,
becoming respect and pride, had now lasted some dozen years, and, so far
from showing signs of interruption, there were under discussion four or
five new projects for additional trades to be started in the village,
which would be decided upon by the time the snow was off the ground.During these years, Thessaly had more than quadrupled its population,
which was now supposed to approximate thirteen thousand, and might be
even more.There had been considerable talk for the past year or two
about getting a charter as a city from the legislature, and undoubtedly
this would soon be done.About this step there were, however, certain
difficulties, more clearly felt than expressed.Not even those who were
most exultant over Thessaly’s splendid advance in wealth and activity
were blind to sundry facts written on the other side of the ledger.Thessaly had now some two thousand voters, of whom perhaps two-fifths
had been born in Europe.It had a saloon for every three hundred and
fifty inhabitants, and there was an uneasy sense of connection between
these two facts which gave rise to awkward thoughts.The village was
fairly well managed by its trustees; the electorate insisted upon
nothing save that they should grant licenses liberally, and, this apart,
their government did not leave much to be desired.But how would it be
when the municipal honors were taken on, when mayor, aider-men and all
the other officers of the new city, with enlarged powers of expenditure
and legislation, should be voted for?Whenever the responsible business
men of Thessaly allowed their minds to dwell upon a forecast of what
this board of aldermen would probably be like, they frankly owned to
themselves that the prospect was not inviting.But as a rule they did
not say so, and the village was drifting citywards on a flowing tide.*****

It was just before Christmas that Reuben Tracy took the first step
toward realizing his dream of making this Thessaly a better place than
it was.Fourteen citizens, all more or less intimate friends of his,
assembled at his office one evening, and devoted some hours to listening
to and discussing his plans.An embarrassment arose almost at the outset through the discovery that
five or six of the men present thought Thessaly was getting on very well
as it was, and had assumed that the meeting was called for the purpose
of arranging a citizens’ movement to run the coming spring elections
for trustees in the interest of good government--by which they of course
understood that they were to be asked to take office.The exposure of
this mistake threatened for a little time to wreck the purpose of the
gathering.Jones, a gentleman who made matches, or rather had just
taken a handsome sum from the great Ruby Loco-foco Trust as his reward
for ceasing to manufacture them, was especially disposed to resent
what Reuben said about the moral and material state of the village.He
insisted that it was the busiest and most progressive town in that whole
section of the State; it had six streets well paved, was lighted with
gas, had no disorderly houses to speak of, and turned out an annual
production of manufactures worth two and a half times as much as the
industrial output of any other place of its size in the State.He had
the figures at his tongue’s end, and when he finished with a spirited
sentence about being proud of his native town, and about birds fouling
their own nests, it looked as if he had the sense of the little
assemblage with him.Reuben Tracy found it somewhat difficult to reply to an unexpected
attack of this nature.He was forced to admit the truth of everything
his critic had said, and then to attempt once more to show why
these things were not enough.Father Chance, the Catholic priest, a
broad-shouldered, athletic young man, who preached very commonplace
sermons but did an enormous amount of pastoral work, took up the
speaking, and showed that his mind ran mainly upon the importance of
promoting total abstinence.John Fairchild, the editor and owner of
Thessaly’s solitary daily paper, a candid and warmhearted man, whose
heterodoxy on the tariff question gave concern to the business men of
the place, but whose journal was honest and popular, next explained what
his views were, and succeeded in precipitating, by some chance remark,
a long, rambling, and irrelevant debate on the merits of protection
and the proper relations between capital and labor.To illustrate his
position on these subjects, and on the general question of Thessaly’s
condition, Mr.Burdick, the cashier of the Dearborn County Bank, next
related how he was originally opposed to the Bland Silver bill, and
detailed the mental processes by which his opinion had finally become
reversed.Matthew’s, a mildly
paternal gentleman, who seemed chiefly occupied by the thought that he
was in the same room with a Catholic priest, tentatively suggested a
bazaar, with ladies and the wives of workingmen mingled together on the
committee, and smiled and coughed confusedly when this idea was received
in absolute silence.Lester, a young physician who had moved into the village only
a few years before, but was already its leading medical authority, who
broke this silence by saying, with a glance which, slowly circling the
room, finally rested on Reuben Tracy: “All this does not help us.Our
views on all sorts of matters are interesting, no doubt, but they
are not vital just now.The question is not so much why you propose
something, but what do you propose?”

The answer came before the person addressed had arranged his words,
and it came from Horace Boyce.This young gentleman had, with a
self-restraint which he himself was most surprised at, taken no part in
the previous conversation.“I think this is the idea,” he said now, pulling his chair forward
into the edge of the open space under the light, and speaking with easy
distinctness and fluency.“It will be time enough to determine just what
we will do when we have put ourselves in the position to act together
upon what we may decide to do.We are all proud and fond of our village;
we are at one in our desire to serve and advance its interests.That is
a platform broad enough, and yet specific enough, for us to start
upon.Let us accept it as a beginning, and form an association, club,
society--whatever it may be called--with this primary purpose in view:
to get together in one body the gentlemen who represent what is most
enlightened, most public-spirited, and at once most progressive and most
conservative in Thessaly.All that we need at first is the skeleton
of an organization, the most important feature of which would be the
committee on membership.Much depends upon getting the right kind of men
interested in the matter.Let the objects and work of this organization
unfold and develop naturally and by degrees.It may take the form of
a mechanics’ institute, a library, a gymnasium, a system of
coffee-taverns, a lecture course With elevating popular exhibitions;
and so I might go on, enumerating all the admirable things which similar
bodies have inaugurated in other villages, both here and in Europe.I have made these matters, both at home and abroad, a subject of
considerable observation; I am enthusiastic over the idea of setting
some such machinery in motion here, and I am perfectly confident, once
it is started, that the leading men of Thessaly will know how to make
it produce results second to none in the whole worldwide field of
philanthropic endeavor.”

When young Mr.Boyce had finished, there was a moment’s hush.Then
Reuben Tracy began to say that this expressed what he had in mind; but,
before he had the words out, the match manufacturer exclaimed:

“Whatever kind of organization we have, it will need a president, and I
move that Mr.Horace Boyce be elected to that place.”

Two or three people in the shadows behind clapped their hands.Horace
protested that it was premature, irregular, that he was too young,
etc.; but the match-maker was persistent, and on a vote there was no
opposition.Turner ceased smiling for a moment or two while
this was going on, and twirled his thumbs nervously; but nobody paid
any attention to him, and soon his face lightened again as his name was
placed just before that of Father Chance on the general committee.Once started, the work of organization went forward briskly.It was
decided at first to call the organization the “Thessaly Reform Club,”
 but two manufacturers suggested that this was only one remove from
styling it a Cobden Club outright, and so the name was altered to
“Thessaly Citizens’ Club,” and all professed themselves pleased.When
the question of a treasurer came up, Reuben Tracy’s name was mentioned,
but some one asked if it would look just the thing to have the two
principal officers in one firm, and so the match-maker consented to take
the office instead.Even the committee on by-laws would have been made
up without Reuben had not Horace interfered; then, upon John Fairchild’s
motion, he was made the chairman of that committee, while Fairchild
himself was appointed secretary.When the meeting had broken up, and the men were putting on their
overcoats and lighting fresh cigars, Dr.Lester took the opportunity of
saying in an undertone to Reuben; “Well, what do you think of it?”

“It seems to have taken shape very nicely.Don’t you think so?”

“Hm-m!There’s a good deal of Boyce in it so far, and damned little
Tracy!”

Reuben laughed.“Oh, don’t be disturbed about that.He’s the best man
for the place.He’s studied all these things in Europe--the cooperative
institutes in the English industrial towns, and so on; and he’ll put his
whole soul into making this a success.”

The doctor sniffed audibly at this, but offered no further remark.Later
on, however, when he was walking along in the crisp moonlight with John
Fairchild, he unburdened his mind.“It was positively sickening,” he growled, biting his cigar angrily, “to
see the way that young cub of a Boyce foisted himself upon the concern.I’d bet any money he put up the whole thing with Jones.They nominated
each other for president and treasurer--didn’t you notice that?”

“Yes, I noticed it,” replied Fairchild, with something between a sigh
and a groan.After a moment he added: “Do you know, I’m afraid Rube will
find himself in a hole with that young man, before he gets through with
him.It may sound funny to you, but I’m deucedly nervous about it.I’d
rather see a hundred Boyces broiled alive than have harm come to so much
as Tracy’s little finger.”

“What could have ailed him to go in blindfold like that into the
partnership?He knew absolutely nothing of the fellow.”

“I’ve told him a hundred times, he’s got no more notion of reading
characters than a mulley cow.Anybody can go up to him and wheedle his
coat off his back, if he knows the first rudiments of the confidence
game.It seems, in this special instance, that he took a fancy to Boyce
because he saw him give two turkeys to old Ben Lawton, who’d lost his
money at a turkey-shoot and got no birds.He thought it was generous and
noble and all that.So far as I can make out, that was his only reason.”

Dr.Lester stopped short and looked at his companion.Then he burst out
in a loud, shrill laugh, which renewed itself in intermittent gurgles
of merriment so many times that Fairchild finally found them monotonous,
and interposed a question:

“There’s something besides fun in all this, Lester.What is it?”

“It isn’t professional to tell, my dear fellow, but there _is_
something--you’re right--and we are Reuben’s friends against all the
world; and this is what I laughed at.”

Then in a low tone, as if even the white flaring moon and the jewelled
stars in the cold sky had ears, he told his secret to his friend--a
secret involving one small human being of whose very existence Mr.“The girl has come back here to Thessaly, you know,” concluded the
doctor.Then after a moment’s thought he said:

“It’s too bad we changed the name of the organization.That cuss _ought_
to be the president of a Reform Club!”




CHAPTER XIII.-- THE DAUGHTER OF THE MILLIONS.A YOUNG woman who is in her twenty-third year, who is possessed of
bright wits, perfect health, great personal beauty, and a fortune
of nearly a million of dollars in her own right, and who moreover is
untroubled by a disquieting preference for any single individual in the
whole army of males, ought not, by all the rules, to be unhappy.Kate Minster defied the rules, and moped.Not infrequently she found
herself in the mood to think, “Now I realize how rich girls must feel
when they commit themselves to entering a convent.” Oftener still,
perhaps, she caught her tongue framing impatient or even petulant
answers to her mother, to her mother’s friends, to everybody, in truth,
save her sister Ethel.The conviction that she was bad-tempered had
begun to enter her mind as it were without rapping, and with the air of
a familiar.By dint of repeated searchings in the mirror, she had almost
discovered a shadow between her brows which would presently develop into
a wrinkle, and notify to the whole world her innate vixenish tendencies.And indeed, with all this brooding which grew upon her, it was something
of a triumph for youth that the wrinkle had still failed to come.It is said that even queens yawn sometimes, when nobody is looking.But
at least they have work to do, such as it is, and grow tired.Miss
Kate had no work of any sort, and was utterly wearied.The vacuity of
existence oppressed her with formless fatigue, like a nightmare.The mischief was that all of his own tremendous energy which Stephen
Minster had transmitted to the generation following him was concentrated
in this eldest child of his.The son had been a lightheaded weakling.The other daughter, Ethel, was as fragile and tenderly delicate as a
Christmas rose.But Kate had always been the strong one of the family,
physically vigorous, restive under unintelligent discipline, rebellious
to teachers she disliked, and proudly confident of her position, her
ability, and the value of her plans and actions.She had loved her
father passionately, and never ceased to mourn that, favorite of his
though she was, business cares had robbed her of so much of his company
for years before his death.As a girl she had dreamed her dreams--bold,
sweepingly ambitious visions they were; but this father of whom she was
so proud, this powerful father who had so manfully subdued things under
his feet, was always the one who was to encompass their fulfilment.When he died, her aêrial castles at a stroke tumbled into chaos.All her
plans and aspirations had turned upon him as their pivot.Without him
all was disorganized, shapeless, incomprehensible.Nearly three years had gone by, and still matters about her and
possibilities before her alike refused to take on definite outlines.She still did not do today the things she wanted to do, yet felt as
powerless as ever to tell what her purposes for to-morrow clearly were.All the conditions for achievement were hers to command, and there was
nothing to achieve.There was something alike grotesque and pathetic in the record of her
attempts to find work.She had gathered at considerable expense all
the books and data she could learn about relating to the life and
surroundings of Lady Arabella Stuart, and had started to write what
should be the authoritative work on the subject, only to discover that
she did not know how to make a book, and would not want to make that
kind of a book if she had known how.She had begun collections of
orchids, of coins, of engraved portraits, of cameos, and, at varying
times, of kindred other trifles, and then on some gray and rainy morning
had found herself impelled to turn upon each of these in its order with
disgust and wrath.For music she unluckily had no talent, and a very
exhaustive and costly outfit of materials for a painter’s studio amused
her for less than one short month.She had a considerable feeling for
color, but was too impatient to work laboriously at the effort to learn
to draw; and so she hated her pictures while they were being painted,
and laughed scornfully at them afterward.She wrote three or four short
stories, full of the passions she had read about, and was chagrined
to get them back from a whole group of polite but implacable editors.Embroidery she detested, and gardening makes one’s back ache.Miss Minster was perfectly aware that other young ladies, similarly
situated, got on very well indeed, without ever fluttering so much as
a feather for a flight toward the ether beyond their own personal
atmosphere; but she did not clearly comprehend what it was that they did
like.She had seen something of their daily life--perhaps more of their
amusements than of their occupations--and it was not wholly intelligible
to her.They seemed able to extract entertainment from a host of things
which were to her almost uninteresting.During her few visits to New
York, Newport, and Saratoga, for the most part made during her father’s
lifetime, people had been extremely kind to her, and had done their best
to make her feel that there existed for her, ready made, a very notable
social position.She had been invited to more dinners than there were
days at her disposal in which to eat them; she had been called with
something like public acclamation the belle of sundry theatre parties;
her appearance and her clothes had been canvassed with distinctly
overfree flattery in one or two newspapers; she had danced a little,
made a number of calls, suffered more than was usual from headaches, and
yawned a great deal.The women whom she met all seemed to take it for
granted that she was in the seventh heaven of enjoyment; and the young
men with huge expanses of shirt front, who sprang up everywhere
in indefinite profusion about her, like the clumps of white
double-hollyhocks in her garden at home, were evidently altogether
sincere in their desire to please her.But the women all received the
next comer with precisely the smile they gave her; and the young men,
aside from their eagerness to devise and provide diversions for her, and
the obvious honesty of their liking for her, were deadly commonplace.She was always glad when it was time to return to Thessaly.Yet in this same village she was practically secluded from the society
of her own generation.There were not a few excellent families in
Thessaly who were on calling and even dining terms with the Minsters,
but there had never been many children in these purely native
households, and now most of the grown-up sons had gone to seek fortune
in the great cities, and most of the girls had married either men who
lived elsewhere or men who did not quite come within the Minsters’
social pale.It was a wearisome and vexatious thing, she said to herself very often,
this barrier of the millions beyond which she must not even let her
fancy float, and which encompassed her solitude like a prison wall.Often, too, she approached the point of meditating revolt, but only to
realize with a fresh sigh that the thought was hopeless.If the people of her own class, even with the advantages of amiable
manners, cleanliness, sophisticated speech, and refined surroundings,
failed to interest her, it was certain enough that the others would be
even less tolerable.And she for whose own protection these impalpable
defences against unpleasant people, adventurers, fortune-hunters, and
the like, had all been reared, surely she ought to be the last in the
world to wish them levelled.And then she would see, of course, that she
did not wish this; yet, all the same, it was very, very dull!There must be whole troops of good folk somewhere whom she could know
with pleasure and gain--nice women who would like her for herself, and
clever men who would think it worth their while to be genuine with her,
and would compliment her intelligence by revealing to it those high
thoughts, phrased in glowing language, of which the master sex at its
best is reputed to be capable--if only they would come in her way.But
there were no signs betokening their advent, and she did not know where
to look for them, and could not have sallied forth in the quest if she
had known; and oh, but this was a weary world, and riches were mere
useless rubbish, and life was a mistake!Patient, soft-eyed Ethel was the one to whom such of these repinings
against existence as found their way into speech were customarily
addressed.She was sympathetic enough, but hers was a temperament placid
as it was tender, and Kate could do everything else save strike out
sparks from it when her mood was for a conflagration.As for the mother,
she knew in a general way that Kate had a complaining and unsatisfied
disposition, and had always had it, and accepted the fact much as she
did that of Ethel’s poor health--as something which could not be helped,
and therefore need not be worried about.Hence, she was but rarely made
the confidante of her elder daughter’s feelings, but Kate occasionally
railed at destiny in the hearing of Miss Tabitha Wilcox, whom she liked
sometimes much more than at others, but always enough to have a certain
satisfaction in mildly bullying her.“You know as well as I do, Tabitha,” said Miss Kate one afternoon in
January, rising from the couch where she had been lounging in sheer
idleness, and walking over to the window with slow indolence of gait,
“that our whole life here is simply ridiculous.We girls have lived here
in Thessaly ever since we were little children, and if we left the place
for good to-morrow, positively there would not be a single personal tie
to be broken.So far as making friends go, we might as well have lived
in the moon, where I believe it is settled that there are no people at
all.And pray what is there in life worth having but friends--I mean
real friends?”

“I had supposed,” began the little lady with the iron-gray curls, who
sat primly beside the window at one corner of the great drawing-room--“I
had supposed that _I_ would be reckoned among--”

“Oh, don’t take me up in that way, Tabitha!Of course, I reckoned
you--you know that well enough--that is, you count and you don’t count,
for you are like one of us.Besides, I was thinking of people of my own
age.There are some few nice girls here, but they are never frank with
me as they are among themselves; I suppose because they are always
thinking that I am rich.Say ten, and
I always think I can see dollar-marks shining in their eyes whenever I
look at them.Certainly they have nothing else inside their heads that
would shine.”

“I am sure you exaggerate their--”

“Oh, no, Tabitha!Don’t be sure of any such thing.They couldn’t be
exaggerated; they wouldn’t bear it.Candidly now, can you think of
a single man in the place whom you would like to hear mentioned as
entertaining the shadow of a hope that some time he might be--what
shall I say?--allowed to cherish the possibility of becoming the--the
son-in-law of my mother?”

“I didn’t think your mind ran on such--”

“And it doesn’t,” broke in the girl, “not in the least, I assure you.I
put it in that way merely to show you what I mean.You can’t associate
on terms of equality with people who would almost be put out of the
house if they ventured to dream of asking you to marry them.Don’t you see what I mean?That is why I say we have no friends here; money brings us
nothing that is of value; this isn’t like a home at all.”

“Why, and everybody is talking of how much Thessaly has improved of late
years.They say the Bidwells,
who already talk of building a second factory for their button
business--they say they moved in very good society indeed at Troy.Bid-well twice at church sociables--the stout lady, you know,
with the false front.They seem quite a knowable family.”

Kate did not reply, but drummed on the window-pane and watched the
fierce quarrels of some English sparrows flitting about on the frozen
snow outside.Miss Tabitha went on with more animation than sequence:

“Of course you’ve heard of the club they’re going to start, or have
started; they call it the Thessaly Citizens’ Club.”

“Who?the Bidwells?”

“Oh, dear, no!The young men of the village--or I suppose it will soon
be a city now.They tell all sorts of stories about what this club
is going to do; reform the whole town, if you believe them.I always
understood a club was for men to drink and play cards and sit up to all
hours in, but it seems this is to be different.At any rate, several
clergymen, Dr.Turner among them, have joined it, and Horace Boyce was
elected president.”

The sparrows had disappeared, but Kate made no answer, and musingly kept
her eyes fastened on the snow where the disagreeable birds had been.“Now, _there’s_ a young man,” said Miss Tabitha, after a pause.Still no
comment came from the window, and so the elder maiden drifted forward:

“It’s all Horace Boyce now.Everybody
is saying he will soon be our leading man.They tell me that he speaks
beautifully--in public, I mean--and he is so good-looking and so bright;
they all expect he’ll make quite a mark when court sits next month.I
suppose hell throw his partner altogether into the shade; everybody at
least seems to think so.And Reuben Tracy had _such_ a chance--once.”

The tall, dark girl at the window still did not turn, but she took up
the conversation with an accent of interest.“_Had_ a chance--what do you mean?I’ve never heard a word against him,
except that idle story you told here once.”

“Idle or not, Kate, you can’t deny that the girl is here.”

Kate laughed, in scornful amusement.“No; and so winter is here, and you
are here, and the snowbirds are here, and all the rest of it.But what
does that go to show?”

“And that reminds me,” exclaimed Tabitha, leaning forward in her chair
with added eagerness--“now, what _do_ you think?”

“The processes by which you are reminded of things, Tabitha, are not fit
subjects for light and frivolous brains like mine.”

“You laugh; but you really never _could_ guess it in all your born days.That Lawton girl--she’s actually a tenant of mine; or, that is, she
rented from another party, but she’s in _my house!_ You can just fancy
what a state I was in when I heard of it.”

“How do you mean?What house?”

“You know those places of mine on Bridge Street--rickety old houses
they’re getting to be now, though I must say they’ve stood much better
than some built years and years after my father put them up, for he was
the most thorough man about such things you ever saw, and as old Major
Schoonmaker once said of him, he--”

“Yes, but what about that--that girl?”

Tabitha returned to her subject without impatience.All her life she had
been accustomed to being pulled up and warned from rambling, and if her
hearers neglected to do this the responsibility for the omission was
their own.“Well, you know the one-story-and-attic place, painted brown, and
flat-roofed, just beyond where the Truemans live.It seems as if I had
had more than forty tenants for that place.Everybody that can’t keep
a store anywhere, and make a living, seems to hit upon that identical
building to fail in.Old Ikey Peters was the last; he started a sort of
fish store, along with peanuts and toys and root beer, and he came to me
a month or two back and said it was no go; he couldn’t pay the rent
any more, and he’d got a job as night watchman: so if he found another
tenant, might he turn it over to him until the first of May, when his
year would be up?and I said, ‘Yes, if it isn’t for a saloon.’ And next
I heard he had rented the place to a woman who had come from Tecumseh to
start a milliner’s shop.I went past there a few days afterward, and
I saw Ben Lawton fooling around inside with a jack-plane, fixing up a
table; but even then I hadn’t a suspicion in the world.It must have
been a week later that I went by again, and there I saw the sign over
the door, ‘J.Lawton--Millinery;’ and would you believe it, even _then_
I didn’t dream of what was up!So in walks I, to say ‘how do you do,’
and lo and behold!there was Ben Lawton’s eldest girl running the place,
and quite as much at home as I was.You could have knocked me over with
a feather!”

“Quite appropriately, in a milliner’s shop, too,” said Kate, who had
taken a chair opposite to Tabitha’s and seemed really interested in her
narrative.“Well, there she was, anyway.”

“And what happened next?Did you faint or run away, or what?”

“Oh, she was quite civil, I must say.She recognized me--she used to see
me at my sister’s when she worked there--and asked me to sit down, and
explained that she hadn’t got entirely settled yet.Yes, I must admit
that she was polite enough.”

“How tiresome of her!Now, if she had thrown boiling water on you, or
even made faces at you, it would have been something like.And _did_ you sit down, Tabitha?”

“I don’t see how I could have done otherwise.And she really has a great
deal of taste in her work.She saw in a minute what’s been the trouble
with my bonnets--you know I always told you there was something--they
were not high enough in front.Don’t you think yourself, now, that this
is an improvement?”

Miss Wilcox lifted her chin, and turned her head slowly around for
inspection; but, instead of the praise which was expected, there came a
merry outburst of laughter.“And you really bought a bonnet of her!” Kate laughed again at the
thought, and then, with a sudden impulse, rose from her chair, glided
swiftly to where Tabitha sat, and kissed her.“You softhearted,
ridiculous, sweet old thing!” she said, beaming at her, and smoothing
the old maid’s cheek in affectionate patronage.Tabitha smiled with pleasure at this rare caress, and preened her head
and thin shoulders with a bird-like motion.But then the serious side
of her experience loomed once more before her, and the smile vanished as
swiftly as it had come.“She’s not living with her father, you know.She and one of her
half-sisters have had the back rooms rigged up to live in, and there
they are by themselves.I guess she saw by my face that I didn’t think
much of _that_ part of the business.Still, thank goodness, it’s only
till the first of May!”

“Shall you turn them out then, Tabitha?” Kate spoke seriously now.“The place has always been respectable, Kate, even if it is tumble-down.To be sure, I did hear certain stories about the family of the man who
sold non-explosive oil there two years ago, and his wife frizzed her
hair in a way that went against my grain, I must admit; but it would
never do to have a scandal about one of my houses, not even _that_ one!”

“I know nothing about these people, of course,” said Kate, slowly and
thoughtfully; “but it seems to me, to speak candidly, Tabitha, that you
are the only one who is making what you call a scandal.No--wait; let me
finish.In some curious way the thought of this girl has kept itself
in my head--perhaps it was because she came back here on the same train
with me, or something else equally trivial.Perhaps she is as bad a
character as you seem to think, but it may also be that she only wants a
little help to be a good girl and to make an honest living for herself.To me, her starting a shop like that here in her native village seems to
show that she wants to work.”

“Why, Kate, everybody knows her character.There’s no secret in the
world about _that_.”

“But suppose I am right about her present wish.Suppose that she does
truly want to rehabilitate herself.Would you like to have it on your
conscience that you put so much as a straw in her way, let alone turned
her out of the little home she has made for herself?I know you better
than that, Tabitha: you couldn’t bring yourself to do it.You may do her a great deal of injury by talking about
her, as, for example, you have been talking to me here to-day.I am
going to ask you a favor, a real personal favor.I want you to promise
me not to mention that girl’s name again to a living soul until--when
shall I say?--until the first of May; and if anybody else mentions it,
to say nothing at all.Now, will you promise that?”

“Of course, if you wish it, but I assure you there wasn’t the slightest
doubt in the world.”

“That I don’t care about.Why should we women be so brutal to each
other?You and I had good homes, good fathers, and never knew what it
was to want for anything, or to fight single-handed against the world.How can we tell what might have crushed and overwhelmed us if we had
been really down in the thick of the battle, instead of watching it from
a private box up here?No: give the girl a chance, and remember your
promise.”

“Come to think of it, she has been to church twice now, two Sundays
running.Turner spoke to her in the vestibule, seeing that she
was a stranger and neatly dressed, and didn’t dream who she was; and
she told me she was never so mortified in her life as when she found out
afterward.A clergyman’s wife has to be so particular, you know.”

“Yes,” Kate answered, absently.Her heart was full of bitter and
sardonic things to say about Mrs.Turner and her conceptions of the
duties of a pastor’s helpmeet, but she withheld them because they might
grieve Tabitha, and then was amazed at herself for being so considerate,
and then fell to wondering whether she, too, was bitten by this
Pharisaical spirit, and so started as out of a dream when Tabitha rose
and said she must go and see Mrs.“Remember your promise,” Kate said, with a little smile and another
caress.She had not been so affectionate before in a long, long time,
and the old maid mused flightily on this unwonted softness as she found
her way up-stairs.The girl returned to the window and looked out once more upon the smooth
white crust which, broken only by half-buried dwarf firs, stretched
across the wide lawn.When at last she wearied of the prospect and her
thoughts, and turned to join the family on the floor above, she confided
these words aloud to the solitude of the big room:

“I almost wish I could start a milliner’s shop myself.”

The depreciatory reflection that she had never discovered in all these
years what was wrong with Tabitha’s bonnets rose with comical suddenness
in her mind, and she laughed as she opened the door.CHAPTER XIV.--HORACE EMBARKS UPON THE ADVENTURE.Boyce was spared the trouble of going to Florida, and
relieved from the embarrassment of inventing lies to his partner
about the trip, which was even more welcome.Only a few days after the
interview with Mrs.Mary went to the bedroom.Minster, news came of the unexpected death of Lawyer
Clarke, caused by one of those sudden changes of temperature at sunset
which have filled so many churchyards in that sunny clime.His executors
were both resident in Thessaly, and at a word from Mrs.Minster they
turned over to Horace the box containing the documents relating to her
affairs.Only one of these executors, old ’Squire Gedney, expressed
any comment upon Mrs.Minster’s selection, at least in Horace’s hearing.This Gedney was a slovenly and mumbling old man, the leading
characteristics of whose appearance were an unshaven jaw, a general
shininess and disorder of apparel, and a great deal of tobacco-juice.It was still remembered that in his youth he had promised to be an
important figure at the bar and in politics.His failure had been
exceptionally obvious and complete, but for some occult reason Thessaly
had a soft corner in its heart for him, even when his estate bordered
upon the disreputable, and for many years had been in the habit of
electing him to be one of its justices of the peace.The functions of
this office he avowedly employed in the manner best calculated to insure
the livelihood which his fellow-citizens expected him to get out of it.His principal judicial maxim was never to find a verdict against the
party to a suit who was least liable to pay him his costs.If justice
could be made to fit with this rule, so much the better for justice.But, in any event, the ’squire must look out primarily for his costs.He made no concealment of this theory and practice; and while some
citizens who took matters seriously were indignant about it, the great
majority merely laughed and said the old man had got to live somehow,
and voted good-naturedly for him next time.If Calvin Gedney owed much to the amiability and friendly feeling of his
fellow-townsmen, he repaid the debt but poorly in kind.No bitterer or
more caustic tongue than his wagged in all Dearborn County.When he was
in a companiable mood, and stood around in the cigar store and talked
for the delectation of the boys of an evening, the range and scope of
his personal sneers and sarcasms would expand under the influence of
applauding laughter, until no name, be it never so honored, was sacred
from his attack, save always one--that of Minster.There was a popular
understanding that Stephen Minster had once befriended Gedney, and that
that accounted for the exception; but this was rendered difficult of
credence by the fact that so many other men had befriended Gedney, and
yet now served as targets for his most rancorous jeers.Whatever the
reason may have been, however, the ’squire’s affection for the memory
of Stephen Minster, and his almost defiant reverence for the family he
had left behind, were known to all men, and regarded as creditable to
him.Perhaps this was in some way accountable for the fact that the ’squire
remained year after year in old Mr.Clarke’s will as an executor,
long after he had ceased to be regarded as a responsible person by the
village at large, for Mr.Clarke also was devoted to the Minsters.At
all events, he was so named in the will, in conjunction with a non-legal
brother of the deceased, and it was in this capacity that he addressed
some remarks to Mr.Horace Boyce when he handed over to him the Minster
papers.The scene was a small and extremely dirty chamber off the
justice’s court-room, furnished mainly by a squalid sofa-bed, a number
of empty bottles on the bare floor, and a thick overhanging canopy of
cobwebs.“Here they are,” said the ’squire, expectorating indefinitely among
the bottles, “and God help ’em!What it all means beats me.”

“I guess you needn’t worry, Cal,” answered Horace lightly, in the easily
familiar tone which Thessaly always adopted toward its unrespected
magistrate.“You’d better come out and have a drink; then you’ll see
things brighter.”

“Damn your impudence, you young cub!” shouted the ’squire, flaming up
into sudden and inexplicable wrath.“Who are you calling ‘Cal’?By the
Eternal, when I was your age, I’d have as soon bitten off my tongue as
dared call a man of my years by his Christian name!I can remember your
great-grandfather, the judge, sir.I was admitted before he died; and I
tell you, sir, that if it had been possible for me to venture upon such
a piece of cheek with him, he’d have taken me over his knee, by Gawd!and walloped me before the whole assembled bar of Dearborn County!”

The old man had worked himself up into a feverish reminiscence of his
early stump-speaking days, and he trembled and spluttered over his
concluding words with unwonted excitement.People always did laugh at “Cal” Gedney,
and laugh most when he grew strenuous.“You’d better get the drink first,” he said, putting the box under his
arm, “and _then_ free your mind.”

“I’ll see you food for worms, first!” shouted the ’squire, still
furiously.“You’ve got your papers, and I’ve got my opinion, and that’s
all there is ’twixt you and me.There’s the door that the carpenters
made, and I guess they were thinking of you when they made it.”

“Upon my word, you’re amusing this morning, ’squire,” said Horace,
looking with aroused interest at the vehement justice.“What’s the
matter with you?Come around to the house
and I’ll rig you up in some new ones.”

The ’squire began with a torrent of explosive profanity, framed in
gestures which almost threatened personal violence.All at once he
stopped short, looked vacantly at the floor, and then sat down on his
bed, burying his face in his hands.From the convulsive clinching of his
fingers among the grizzled, unkempt locks of hair, and the heaving of
his chest, Horace feared he was going to have a fit, and, advancing, put
a hand on his shoulder.The ’squire shook it off roughly, and raised his haggard,
deeply-furrowed face.It was a strong-featured countenance still, and
had once been handsome as well, but what it chiefly said to Horace now
was that the old man couldn’t stand many more such nights of it as this
last had evidently been.“Come, ’squire, I didn’t want to annoy you.I’m sorry if I did.”

“You insulted me,” said the old man, with a dignity which quavered into
pathos as he added: “I’ve got so low now, by Gawd, that even you can
insult me!”

Horace smiled at the impracticability of all this.“What the deuce is it
all about, anyway?” he asked.I’ve always
been civil to you, haven’t I?”

“You’re no good,” was the justice’s concise explanation.“I daresay you’re right,” he said,
pleasantly, as one humors a child.“_Now_ will you come out and have a
drink?”

“I’ve not been forty-four years at the bar for nothing--”

“I should think not!Whole generations of barkeepers can testify to
that.”

“I can tell,” went on the old man, ignoring the jest, and rising from
the bed as he spoke; “I can tell when a man’s got an honest face.I
can tell when he means to play fair.And I wouldn’t trust you one inch
farther, Mr.Horace Boyce, than I could throw a bull by the tail.I tell
you that, sir, straight to your teeth.”

Horace, still with the box snugly under his arm, had sauntered out into
the dark and silent courtroom.He turned now, half smiling, and said:

“Third and last call--_do_ you want a drink?”

The old man’s answer was to slam the door in his face with a noise
which rang in reverberating echoes through the desolate hall of justice.*****

The morning had lapsed into afternoon, and succeeding hours had brought
the first ashen tints of dusk into the winter sky, before the young man
completed his examination of the Minster papers.He had taken them to
his own room in his father’s house, sending word to the office that he
had a cold and would not come down that day; and it was behind a locked
door that he had studied the documents which stood for millions.On a
sheet of paper he made certain memoranda from time to time, and now that
the search was ended, he lighted a fresh cigar, and neatly reduced these
to a little tabular statement:

[Illustration: 0196]

When Horace had finished this he felt justified in helping himself
to some brandy and soda.It was the most interesting and important
computation upon which he had ever engaged, and its noble proportions
grew upon him momentarily as he pondered them and sipped his drink.More
than two and a quarter millions lay before his eyes, within reach of his
hand.Was it not almost as if they were his?And of course this did not
represent everything.There was sundry village property that he knew
about; there would be bank accounts, minor investments and so on, quite
probably raising the total to nearly or quite two millions and a half.And he had only put things down at par values.The telegraph stock was
quoted at a trifle less, just now, but if there had been any Minster
Iron-works stock for sale, it would command a heavy premium.The
scattering investments, too, which yielded an average of five per cent.,
must be worth a good deal more than their face.What he didn’t like
about the thing was that big block of Thessaly Manufacturing Company
stock.That seemed to be earning nothing at all; he could find no record
of dividends, or, in truth, any information whatever about it.Where had
he heard about that company before?The name was curiously familiar to
his mind; he had been told something about it--by whom?That was the company of which the
mysterious Judge Wendover was president.Tenney had talked about it;
Tenney had told him that he would hear a good deal about it before long.As these reflections rose in the young man’s mind, the figures which
he had written down on the paper seemed to diminish in size and
significance.It was a queer notion, but he couldn’t help feeling that
the millions had somehow moved themselves farther back, out of his
reach.The thought of these two men--of the gray-eyed, thin-lipped,
abnormally smart Tenney, and of that shadowy New York financier who
shared his secrets--made him nervous.They had a purpose, and he was
more or less linked to it and to them, and Heaven only knew where he
might be dragged in the dark.He finished his glass and resolved that
he would no longer remain in the dark.To-morrow he would see Tenney and
Mrs.Minster and Reuben, and have a clear understanding all around.There came sharp and loud upon his door a peremptory knocking, and
Horace with a swift movement slipped the paper on which he had made the
figures into the box, and noiselessly closed the cover.Then he opened
the door, and discovered before him a man whom for the instant, in the
dim light of the hall, he did not recognize.The man advanced a
step, and then Horace saw that it was--strangely changed and unlike
himself--his father!“I didn’t hear you come in,” said the young man, vaguely confused by the
altered appearance of the General, and trying in some agitation of mind
to define the change and to guess what it portended.“They told me you were here,” said the father, moving lumpishly forward
into the room, and sinking into a chair.“I’m glad of it.I want to talk
to you.”

His voice had suddenly grown muffled, as if with age or utter weariness.His hands lay palm upward and inert on his fat knees, and he buried his
chin in his collar helplessly.The gaze which he fastened opaquely upon
the waste-paper basket, and the posture of his relaxed body, suggested
to Horace a simple explanation.Evidently this was the way his
delightful progenitor looked when he was drunk.“Wouldn’t it be better to go to bed now, and talk afterward?” said the
young man, with asperity.He clearly understood the purport of
the question, and gathered his brows at first in a half-scowl.Then the
humor of the position appealed to him, and he smiled instead--a grim
and terrifying smile which seemed to darken rather than illumine his
purplish face.“Did you think I was drunk, that you should say that?” he asked, with
the ominous smile still on his lips.He added, more slowly, and with
something of his old dignity: “No--I’m merely ruined!”

“It has come, has it?” The young man heard himself saying these words,
but they sounded as if they had issued from other lips than his.He had
schooled himself for a fortnight to realize that his father was actually
insolvent, yet the shock seemed to find him all unprepared.You knew about it?”

“Tenney told me last month that it must come, sooner or later.”

The General offered an invocation as to Mr.Tenney’s present existence
and future state which, solemnly impressive though it was, may not be
set down here.“So I say, too, if you like,” answered Horace, beginning to pace the
room.“But that will hardly help us just now.Tell me just what has
happened.”

“Sit down, then: you make me nervous, tramping about like that.The
villain simply asked me to step into the office for a minute, and then
took out his note-book, cool as a cucumber.‘I thought I’d call your
attention to how things stand between us.’ he said, as if I’d been a
country customer who was behindhand with his paper.Then the scoundrel
calmly went on to say that my interest in the partnership was worth less
than nothing; that I already owed him more than the interest would come
to, if the business were sold out, and that he would like to know what I
proposed to do about it.that’s what he said to me, and I sat
there and listened to him.”

“What did you say?”

“I told him what I thought of him.He hasn’t heard so much straight,
solid truth about himself before since he was weaned, I’ll bet!”

“But what good was that?He isn’t the sort who minds that kind of thing.What did you tell him you would do?”

“Break his infernal skull for him if he ever spoke to me again!”

Horace almost smiled, as he felt how much older he was than this
red-faced, white-haired boy, who could fight and drink and tell funny
stories, world without end, but was powerless to understand business
even to the extent of protecting his interest in a hardware store.But
the tendency to smile was painfully short-lived; the subject was too
serious.“Well, tell _me_, then, what you are going to do!”

“Good God!” broke forth the General, raising his head again.“What _can_
I do!Crawl into a hole and die somewhere, I should think.I don’t see
anything else.But before I do, mark me, I’ll have a few minutes alone
with that scoundrel, in his office, in the street, wherever I can find
him; and if I don’t fix him up so that his own mother won’t know him,
then my name isn’t ‘Vane’ Boyce!”

“Tut-tut,” said the prudent lawyer of the family.“Men don’t die because
they fail in the hardware business, and this isn’t Kentucky.We don’t
thrash our enemies up here in the North.Do you want me to see Tenney?”

“I suppose so--if you can stomach a talk with the whelp.He said
something, too, about talking it over with you, but I was too raving mad
to listen.Have you had any dealings with him?”

“Nothing definite.We’ve discussed one or two little things--in the
air--that is all.”

The General rose and helped himself to some neat brandy from his son’s
_liqueur_-stand.“Well, if you do--you hear me--he’ll singe you clean as
a whistle.By God, he won’t leave so much as a pin-feather on you!”

Horace smiled incredulously.“I rather think I can take care of Mr.Schuyler Tenney,” said he, with a confident front.“I’ll go down and see
him now, if you like, and don’t you worry yourself about it.I daresay
I can straighten it out all right.The best thing you can do is to
say nothing at all about your affairs to anybody.It might complicate
matters if he heard that you had been publicly proclaiming your
intention of beating him into a jelly.I don’t know, but I can fancy
that he might not altogether like that.And, above all things, don’t get
down on your luck.I guess we can keep our heads above water, Tenney or
no Tenney.”

The young man felt that it was distinctly decent of him to thus assume
responsibility for the family, and did not look to see the General take
it so much as a matter of course.But that distinguished soldier had
quite regained his spirits, and smacked his lips over a second glass of
brandy with smiling satisfaction, as if Tenney had already been turned
out of the hardware store, neck and crop.You go ahead, and let him have it from the shoulder.Give
him one for me, while you’re about it,” he said, with his old robust
voice and hearty manner all come back again.The elasticity of this
stout man’s temperament was a source of perpetual wonderment to his
slender son.Yet Horace, too, had much the same singular capacity for shaking off
trouble, and he saw matters in quite a hopeful light as he strode along
down toward Main Street.Clearly Tenney had only meant to frighten the
General.He found his father’s partner in the little office boxed off the store,
and had a long talk with him--a talk prolonged, in fact, until after
business hours.When he reflected upon this conversation during his
homeward journey, he could recall most distinctly that he had told
Tenney everything about the Minsters which the search of the papers
revealed.Somehow, the rest of the talk had not seemed to be very
important.Tenney had laughed lightly when the question of the General
came up, and said: “Oh, you needn’t bother about that.I only wanted him
to know how things stood.He can go on as long as he likes; that is,
of course, if you and I continue to work together.” And Horace had said
that he was much obliged, and would be glad to work with Mr.Tenney--and
really that had been the sum of the whole conversation.Or yes, there had been one other thing.Tenney had said that it would
be best now to tell Reuben Tracy that Mrs.Minster had turned over her
affairs to him--temporarily, at least--but not to discuss them with him
at all, and not to act as if he thought they were of special importance.Horace felt that this could easily be done.Reuben was the least
suspicious man in the world, and the matter might be so stated to him
that he would never give it a second thought.The General received over the supper-table the tidings that no evil
was intended to him, much as his son had expected him to; that is, with
perfectly restored equanimity.He even admitted that Tenney was within
his rights to speak as he did, and that there should be no friction
provoked by any word or act of his.“I don’t like the man, you know,” he said, between mouthfuls, “but it’s
just as well that I should stick by him.He’s skinned me dry, and my
only chance is now to keep friendly with him, in the hope that when he
begins skinning other people he’ll let me make myself good out of the
proceeds.”

This worldly wisdom, emanating from such an unlikely source, surprised
the young man, and he looked up with interest to his father’s face,
red-shining under the lamplight.“I mean what I say,” continued the General, who ate with unfailing gusto
as he talked.“Tenney as much as said that to me himself, awhile ago.”

Horace nodded with comprehension.He had thought the aphorism too
concise and strong for his father’s invention.“And I could guess with my eyes shut how he’s going to do it,” the
elder Boyce went on.“He’s got a lot of the stock of the Thessaly
Manufacturing Company, the one that’s built the rolling mills in
connection with the Minster iron-works, and the rest of the stock is
held in New York; and some fine day the New Yorkers will wake up and
find themselves cleaned out.Tenney’s little ways!”

The General wagged his round head upon its thick neck with complacency
at his superior insight, but Horace finished his supper in silence.He
did not see very far into the millstone yet, but already he guessed that
the stockholders who were to be despoiled lived in Thessaly and not New
York.A strange, amorphous vision of the looting of the millions arose
like a mirage between him and the shaded lamplight, and he looked into
its convolving vortex half in terror, half in trembling fascination.Suddenly he felt himself impelled to say--why he could not tell--“I
might as well speak to you about it.It is my ambition to marry Miss
Kate Minster.I think I shall succeed.”

The General almost upset his chair in his eagerness to rise, lean over
the table, and shake hands with his son.CHAPTER XV.--THE LAWTON GIRL’S WORK.FORTUNATELY Jessica Lawton’s humble little business enterprise began to
bring in returns before her slender store of money was quite exhausted.Even more fortunate, at least in her estimation, was the fact that the
lion’s share of this welcome patronage came from the poor working-girls
of the village.When the venture was a month old, there was nearly
enough work to occupy all her time, and, taking into account the season,
this warranted her in believing that she had succeeded.The result had not come without many anxious days, made bitter alike by
despairing tremors for the future and burning indignation at the insults
and injuries of the present.Now that these had in a measure abated, she
felt, in looking back upon them, that the fear of failure was always
the least of her troubles.At the worst, the stock which, through
Mrs.Fairchild’s practical kindness, she had been able to bring from
Tecumseh, could be sold for something like its cost.Her father’s help
had sufficed for nearly all the changes needed in the small tenement,
and she had money enough to pay the rent until May.The taking over of Lucinda was a more serious matter, for the girl had
been a wage-earner, and would be entitled to complain if it turned out
that she had been decoyed away from the factory on an empty promise.But
Lucinda, so far from complaining, seemed exceptionally contented.It was
true that she gave no promise of ever acquiring skill as a milliner, and
she was not infrequently restless under the discipline which Jessica,
with perhaps exaggerated caution, strove to impose, but she worked with
great diligence in their tiny kitchen, and served customers in the store
with enthusiasm if not _finesse_.The task of drilling her into that
habit of mind which considers finger-nails and is mindful of soap was
distinctly onerous, and even now had reached only a stage in which
progress might be reported; but much could be forgiven a girl who was so
cheerful and who really tried so hard to do her share.As for the disagreeable experiences, which had once or twice been
literally terrifying, the girl still grew sick at heart with rage and
shame and fear that they might jeopardize her plans, when she thought
of them.In their ruder aspects they were divisible into two classes.A number of young men, sometimes in groups of twos or threes, but more
often furtively and alone, had offensively sought to make themselves at
home in the store, and had even pounded on the door in the evening after
it was shut and bolted; a somewhat larger number of rough factory-girls,
or idlers of the factory-girl class, had come from time to time with
the obvious intention of insulting her.These latter always appeared
in gangs, and supported one another in cruel giggling and in coarse
inquiries and remarks.After a few painfully futile attempts to meet and rebuff these hostile
waves, Jessica gave up the effort, and arranged matters so that she
could work in the living-room beyond, within call if she were needed,
but out of the visual range of her persecutors.Lucinda encountered them
instead, and gave homely but vigorous Rolands for their Olivers.It
was in the interchange of these remarks that the chief danger, to the
struggling little business lay, for if genuine customers heard them,
why, there was an end to everything.It is not easy to portray the
girl’s relief as week after week went by, and time brought not only no
open scandal, but a marked diminution of annoyance.When Jessica was
no longer visible, interest in the sport lagged.To come merely for
the sake of baiting Lucinda was not worth the while.And when these
unfriendly visits slackened, and then fell off almost altogether,
Jessica hugged to her breast the notion that it was because these rough
young people had softened toward and begun to understand and sympathize
with her.It was the easier to credit this kindly hypothesis in that she had
already won the suffrages of a considerable circle of working-girls.To explain how this came about would be to analyze many curious and
apparently contradictory phases of untutored human nature, and to
recount many harmless little stratagems and well-meant devices, and many
other frankly generous words and actions which came from hearts not the
less warm because they beat amid the busy whir of the looms, or throbbed
to the time of the seamstress’s needle.Jessica’s own heart was uplifted with exultation, sometimes, when she
thought upon the friendliness of these girls.So far as she knew and
believed, every one of them was informed as to her past, and there was
no reason beyond their own inclination why they should take stock in
her intentions for the future.To a slender few, originally suggested
by Lucinda, and then confirmed by her own careful scrutiny, she had
confided the crude outlines of her scheme--that is, to build up a
following among the toilers of her own sex, to ask from this following
no more than a decent living for work done, and to make this work
include not merely the details of millinery and hints about dress, but a
general mental and material helpfulness, to take practical form step by
step as the means came to hand and the girls themselves were ready for
the development.Whenever she had tried to put this into words, its
melancholy vagueness had been freshly apparent to her, but the girls had
believed in her!And they had brought others, and spread the favorable report about,
until even now, in the dead season, lying half way between Christmas and
the beginning of Lent, she was kept quite busy.To be sure, her patrons
were not governed much by these holiday dates at any time, and she was
undoubtedly doing their work better and more cheaply than it could ever
have been done for them before, but their good spirit in bringing it was
none the less evident for that.And out of the contact with this good spirit, Jessica began to be dimly
conscious of getting great stores of strength for herself.If it could
be all like this, she felt that her life would be ideally happy.She had
not the skill of mind to separate her feelings, and contrast and weigh
them one against the other, but she knew clearly enough that she was
doing what afforded her keen enjoyment, and it began to be apparent that
merely by doing it she would come to see more clearly, day by day, how
to expand and ennoble her work.The mission which Annie Fairchild had
urged upon her and labored to fit her for, and which she had embraced
and embarked upon with only the vaguest ideas as to means or details or
specific aims, was unfolding itself inspiringly before her.During this period she wrote daily to the good woman who had sent her
upon this work--short letters setting forth tersely the events and
outcome of the day--and the answers which came twice a week helped
greatly to strengthen her.And do not doubt that often she stood in grave need of strength!The
mere matter of regular employment itself was still more or less of a
novelty to her; regular hours still found her physically rebellious.The restraints of a shop, of studied demeanor, of frugal meals, of no
intimate society save that of one dull girl,--these still wore gratingly
upon her nerves, and produced periodical spasms of depression and gloom,
in which she was much tortured by doubts about herself and the utility
of what she was doing.Sometimes, too, these doubts took the positive form of temptation--of a
wild kind of longing to get back again into the atmosphere where bright
lights shone on beautiful dresses, and the hours went swiftly, gayly by
with jest, and song, and the sparkle of the amber air-beads rising in
the tall wine-glasses.There came always afterward the memory of those
other hours which dragged most gruesomely, when the daylight made all
tawdry and hateful once more, and heartaches ruled where smiles had
been.Yet still these unbidden yearnings would come, and then the girl
would set her teeth tight together, and thrust her needle through the
mutinous tears till they were exorcised.It had been in her unshaped original plan to do a good deal for her
father, but this proved to be more easily contemplated than done.Once
the little rooms had been made habitable for her and Lucinda, there
remained next to nothing for him to do.He came around every morning,
when some extraordinary event, such as a job of work or a fire, did not
interfere, and offered his services, but he knew as well as they did
that this was a mere amiable formality.He developed a great fondness
for sitting by the stove in Jessica’s small working room, and either
watching her industrious fingers or sleeping calmly in his chair.Perhaps the filial instinct was not strong in Lucinda’s composition;
perhaps it had been satiated by over-close contact during those five
years of Jessica’s absence.At any rate, the younger girl did not
enjoy Ben’s presence as much as her sister seemed to, and almost daily
detracted from his comfort by suggestions that the apartments were very
small, and that a man hanging around all day took up a deplorable amount
of room.It had been Jessica’s notion, too, that she and her sister would walk
out in the evenings under the escort of their father, and thus secure
themselves from misapprehension.But Lucinda rebelled flatly against
this, at least until Ben had some new clothes, and the money for these
was not forthcoming.Jessica did find it possible to spare a dollar or
so to her father weekly, and there had been a nebulous understanding
that this was to be applied to raiment; but the only change in his
appearance effected by this so far had been a sporadic accession of
startlingly white paper collars.There were other minor disappointments--portions of her plan, so to
speak, which had failed to materialize--but the net result of a month’s
trial was distinctly hopeful.Although most of such work as had come to
her was from the factory-girls, not a few ladies had visited the little
store, and made purchases or given orders.Among these she liked best
of all the one who owned the house; a very friendly old person, with
corkscrew curls and an endless tongue--Miss Tabitha Wilcox.She had
already made two bonnets for her, and the elderly lady had been so
pleasant and talkative that she had half resolved, when next she came
in, to unfold to her the scheme which now lay nearest to her heart.This was nothing less than securing permission to use a long-deserted
and roomy building which stood in the yard, at the back of the one she
occupied, as a sort of evening club for the working-girls of the town.Jessica had never been in this building, but so far as she could see
through the stained and dismantled windows, where the drifts did not
render approach impossible, it had formerly been a dwelling-house, and
later had been used in part as a carpenter’s shop.To get this, and to fit it up simply but comfortably as a place where
the tired factory and sewing girls could come in the evening, to read or
talk or play games if they liked, to merely sit still and rest if they
chose, but in either case to be warm and contented and sheltered from
the streets and the deadly boredom of squalid lodgings, became little by
little her abiding ambition.She had spoken tentatively to some of the
girls about it, and they were all profoundly enthusiastic over the plan.It remained to enlist the more fortunate women whose assistance could
alone make the plan feasible.Jessica had essayed to get at the parson’s
wife, Mrs.Turner; but that lady, after having been extremely cordial,
had unaccountably all at once turned icy cold, and cut the girl dead in
the street.I said “unaccountably,” but Jessica was not at all at a loss
to comprehend the change, and the bitterness of the revelation had
thrown her into an unusually deep fit of depression.For a time it had
seemed to her hopeless to try to find another confidante in that class
which despised and shrank from her.Then Miss Tabitha’s pleasant words
and transparent good-heartedness had lifted her out of her despondency,
and she was almost resolved now to approach her on the subject of the
house iii the back yard.CHAPTER XVI.--A GRACIOUS FRIEND RAISED UP.The opportunity which Jessica sought came with unlooked-for
promptness--in fact, before she had quite resolved what to ask for, and
how best to prefer her request.It was a warm, sunny winter morning, with an atmosphere which suggested
the languor of May rather than the eagerness of early spring, and
which was already in these few matutinal hours playing havoc with the
snowbanks.The effects of the thaw were unpleasantly visible on the
sidewalks, where deep puddles were forming as the drifts melted away,
and the back yard was one large expanse of treacherous slush.Jessica
had hoped that her father would come, in order that he might cut away
the ice and snow in front, and thus drain the walk for passers-by.But
as the mild morning air rendered it unnecessary to seek the comfort of a
seat by the stove, Ben preferred to lounge about on the outskirts of the
hay-market, exchanging indolent jokes with kindred idlers, and vaguely
enjoying the sunshine.Samantha, however, chose this forenoon for her first visit to the
milliner’s shop, and showed a disposition to make herself very much at
home.The fact that encouragement was plainly wanting did not in any way
abash her.Lucinda told her flatly that she had only come to see what
she could pick up, and charged her to her face with having instigated
her friends to offer them annoyance and affront.Samantha denied both
imputations with fervor, the while she tried on before the mirror a
bronze-velvet toque with sage-green feathers.“I don’t know that I ever quite believed that of you, Samantha,” said
Jessica, turning from her dismayed contemplation of the water on the
sidewalk.“And if you really want to be friendly, why, you are welcome
to come here.But I have heard of things you have said that were not at
all nice.”

“All lies!” remarked Samantha, studying the effect of the hat as nearly
in a profile view as she could manage with a single glass.“You can’t
believe a word you hear here in Thessaly.Wouldn’t this go better if
there was some yellow put in there, close by the feathers?”

“I didn’t want to believe it,” said Jessica.“I’ve never done you any
harm, and never wished anything but well by you, and I couldn’t see why
you should want to injure me.”

“Don’t I tell you they lied?” responded Samantha, affably.“‘Cindy,
here, is always blackguarding me.You know you always did,” she added,
in passing comment upon Lucinda’s indignant snort, “but I don’t bear no
malice.I suppose a hat like this comes pretty
high, don’t it?”

As she spoke, a sleigh was driven up with some difficulty through the
yielding snowbanks, and stopped close to the sidewalk in front of the
shop.It was by far the most distinguished-looking sleigh Jessica had
seen in Thessaly.The driver on the front seat bore a cockade proudly
in his high hat, and the horses he controlled were superbly matched
creatures, with glossy silver-mounted harness, and with tails neatly
braided and tied up in ribbons for protection from the slush.A costly
silver-fox wrap depended over the back of the cutter, and a robe of some
darker but equally sumptuous fur enfolded the two ladies who sat in the
second seat.Jessica was glad that so splendid an equipage should have drawn up
at her door, with a new-born commercial instinct, even before she
recognized either occupant of the sleigh.“That’s Kate Minster,” said Samantha, still with the hat of her dreams
on her head, “the handsomest girl in Thessaly, and the richest, and the
stuck-up-edest.but you’re in luck!”

Jessica did not know much about the Minsters, but she now saw that the
other lady, who was already preparing to descend, and stood poised on
the rail of the cutter looking timorously at the water on the walk, was
no other than Miss Tabitha Wilcox.“I will give you that hat you’ve got on,” she said in a hurried tone,
“if you’ll go with Lucinda clear back into the kitchen and shut both
doors tight after you, and stay there till I call you.”

At this considerable sacrifice the store was cleared for the reception
of these visitors--the most important who had as yet crossed its
threshold.Miss Tabitha did not offer to introduce her companion--whom Jessica
noted furtively as a tall, stately, dark girl, with a wonderfully
handsome face, who stood silently by the little showcase and was wrapped
in furs worth the whole stock of millinery she confronted--but bustled
about the store, while she plunged into the middle of an explanation
about hats she had had, hats she thought of having, and hats she might
have had, of which the milliner understood not a word.It was not,
indeed, essential that she should, for presently Tabitha stopped short,
looked about her triumphantly, and asked:

“Now, wasn’t I right?Aren’t they the nicest in town?”

The tall girl smiled, and inclined her dignified head.“They are very pretty, indeed,” she answered, and Jessica remarked to
herself what a soft, rich voice it was, that made even those commonplace
words so delightful to the ear.“I don’t know that we wanted to look at anything in particular,” rattled
on Miss Tabitha.“We were driving by” (O Tabitha!as if Miss Kate had
not commanded this excursion for no other purpose than this visit!)“and
I just thought we’d drop in, for I’ve been telling Miss Minster about
what excellent taste you had.”

A momentary pause ensued, and then Jessica, conscious of blushes and
confusion, made bold to unburden her mind of its plan.“I wanted to speak to you,” she said, falteringly at first, but with a
resolution to have it all out, “about that vacant house in the back yard
here.It looks as if it had been a carpenter’s shop last, and it seems
in very bad repair.”

“I suppose it might as well come down,” broke in Miss Wilcox.“Still,
I--”

“Oh, no!that wasn’t what I meant!” protested Jessica.“I--I wanted
to propose something about it to you.If--if you will be seated, I can
explain what I meant.”

The two ladies took chairs, but with a palpable accession of reserve on
their countenances.The girl went on to explain:

“To begin with, the factory-girls and sewing-girls here spend too much
time on the streets--I suppose it is so everywhere--the girls who were
thrown out when the match factory shut down, particularly.Then they get into trouble, or at any
rate they learn slangy talk and coarse ways.But you can’t blame them,
for their homes, when they have any, are not pleasant places, and where
they hire rooms it is almost worse still.Now, I’ve been thinking of
something--or, rather, it isn’t my own idea, but I’ll speak about that
later on.This is the idea: I have come to know a good many of the best
of these girls--perhaps you would think they were the worst, too, but
they’re not--and I know they would be glad of some good place where they
could spend their evenings, especially in the winter, where it would be
cosey and warm, and they could read or talk, or bring their own sewing
for themselves, and amuse themselves as they liked.And I had thought
that perhaps that old house could be fixed up so as to serve, and they
could come through the shop here after tea, and so I could keep track of
them, don’t you see?”

“I don’t quite think I do,” said Miss Tabitha, with distinct
disapprobation.The plan had seemed so excellent to her,
and yet it was to be frowned down.“Perhaps I haven’t made it clear to you,” she ventured to say.“Oh, yes, you have,” replied Miss Tabitha.“I don’t mind pulling the
house down, but to make it a rendezvous for all the tag-rag and bob-tail
in town--I simply couldn’t think of it!These houses along here have
seen their best days, perhaps, but they’ve all been respectable,
always!”

“I don’t think myself that you have quite grasped Miss Lawton’s
meaning.”

It was the low, full, quiet voice of the beautiful fur-clad lady that
spoke, and Jessica looked at her with tears of anxious gratitude in her
eyes.Miss Minster seemed to avoid returning the glance, but went on in the
same even, musical tone:

“It appears to me that there might be a great deal of much-needed
good done in just that way, Tabitha.The young lady says--I think I
understood her to say--that she had talked with some of these girls, and
that that is what they would like.It seems to me only common-sense, if
you want to help people, to help them in their own way, and not insist,
instead, that it shall be in your way--which really is no help at all!”

“Nobody can say, I hope, that I have ever declined to extend a helping
hand to anybody who showed a proper spirit,” said Miss Wilcox, with
dignity, putting up her chin.“I know that, ma’am,” pleaded Jessica.“That is why I felt sure you
would like my plan.I ought to tell you--it isn’t quite my plan.Fairchild, at Tecumseh, who used to teach the Burfield school, who
suggested it.She is a very, very good woman.”

“And I think it is a very, very good idea,” said Miss Kate, speaking for
the first time directly to Jessica.“Of course, there would have to be
safeguards.”

“You have no conception what a rough lot they are,” said Miss Tabitha,
in more subdued protest.“There is no telling who they would bring here,
or what they wouldn’t do.”

“Indeed, I am sure all that could be taken care of,” urged Jessica,
taking fresh courage, and speaking now to both her visitors.“Only those
whom I knew to mean well by the undertaking should be made members, and
they would agree to very strict rules, I feel certain.”

“Why, child alive!where would you get the money for it, even if it
could be done otherwise?” Miss Tabitha wagged her curls conclusively,
but her smile was not unkind.It would not be exact to say that Jessica had not considered this, but,
as it was now presented, it seemed like a new proposition.Miss Wilcox did not wait over long for a reply, but proceeded to point
out, in a large and exhaustive way, the financial impossibilities of the
plan.Jessica had neither heart nor words for an interruption, and Miss
Kate listened in an absent-minded manner, her eyes on the plumes and
velvets in the showcase.The interruption did come in a curiously unexpected fashion.A loud
stamping of wet feet was heard on the step outside; then the door from
the street was opened.The vehemence of the call-bell’s clamor seemed to
dismay the visitor, or perhaps it was the presence of the ladies.At
all events, he took off his hat, as if it had been a parlor instead of a
shop, and made an awkward inclusive bow, reaching one hand back for the
latch, as if minded to beat a retreat.Tracy!” exclaimed Tabitha, rising from her chair.Reuben advanced now and shook hands with both her and Jessica.For an
instant the silence threatened to be embarrassing, and it was not wholly
relieved when Tabitha presented him to Miss Minster, and that young lady
bowed formally without moving in her chair.But the lawyer could not
suspect the disagreeable thoughts which were chasing one another behind
these two unruffled and ladylike fronts, and it was evident enough that
his coming was welcome to the mistress of the little shop.“I have wanted to look in upon you before,” he said to Jessica, “and
I am ashamed to think that I haven’t done so.I have been very much
occupied with other matters.It doesn’t excuse me to myself, but it may
to you.”

“Oh, certainly, Mr.Tracy,” Jessica answered, and then realized how
miserably inadequate the words were.“It’s very kind of you to come at
all,” she added.Tabitha shot a swift glance at her companion, and the two ladies rose,
as by some automatic mechanical device, absolutely together.“We must be going, Miss Lawton,” said the old maid, primly.A woman’s intuition told Jessica that something had gone wrong.If she
did not entirely guess the nature of the trouble, it became clear enough
on the instant to her that these ladies misinterpreted Reuben’s visit.Perhaps they did not like him--or perhaps--She stepped toward them and
spoke eagerly, before she had followed out this second hypothesis in her
mind.“If you have a moment’s time to spare,” she pleaded, “I _wish_ you would
let me explain to Mr.Tracy the plan I have talked over with you.He was
my school-teacher; he is my oldest friend--the only friend I had when
I was--a--a girl, and I haven’t seen him before since the day I arrived
home here.I should _so_ much like to have you hear his opinion.The
lady I spoke of--Mrs.Perhaps he knows
of the plan already from her.”

Reuben did not know of the plan, and the two ladies consented to take
seats again while it should be explained to him.Tabitha assumed a
distant and uneasy expression of countenance, and looked straight ahead
of her out through the glass door until the necessity for relief by
conversation swelled up within her to bursting point; for Kate had
rather flippantly deserted her, and so far from listening with haughty
reserve under protest, had actually joined in the talk, and taken up the
thread of Jessica’s stumbling explanation.The three young people seemed to get on extremely well together.Reuben
fired up with enthusiasm at the first mention of the plan, and showed
so plainly the sincerity of his liking for it that Miss Minster felt
herself, too, all aglow with zeal.Thus taken up by friendly hands, the
project grew apace, and took on form and shape like Aladdin’s palace.Tabitha listened with a swiftly mounting impatience of her speechless
condition, and a great sickening of the task of watching the cockade of
the coachman outside, which she had imposed upon herself, as the talk
went on.She heard Reuben say that he would gladly raise a subscription
for the work; she heard Kate ask to be allowed to head the list with
whatever sum he thought best, and then to close the list with whatever
additional sum was needed to make good the total amount required;
she heard Jessica, overcome with delight, stammer out thanks for this
unlooked-for adoption and endowment of her poor little plan, and then
she could stand it no longer.“Have you quite settled what you will do with my house?” she asked,
still keeping her face toward the door.“There are some other places
along here belonging to me--that is, they always have up to now--but of
course if you have plans about them, too, just tell me, and--”

“Don’t be absurd, Tabitha,” said Miss Minster, rising from her chair as
she spoke.“Of course we took your assent for granted from the start.I
believe, candidly, that you are more enthusiastic about it this moment
than even we are.”

Reuben thought that the old lady dissembled her enthusiasm skilfully,
but at least she offered no dissent.A few words more were exchanged,
the lawyer promising again his aid, and Miss Minster insisting that she
herself wanted the task of drawing up, in all its details, the working
plan for the new institution, and, on second thoughts, would prefer to
pay for it all herself.“I have been simply famishing for something to do all these years,”
 she said, in smiling confidence, to Tracy, “and here it is at last.You
can’t guess how happy I shall be in mapping out the whole thing--rules
and amusements and the arrangements of the rooms and the furnishing,
and--everything.”

Perhaps Jessicas face expressed too plainly the thought that this
bantling of hers, which had been so munificently adopted, bade fair to
be taken away from her altogether, for Miss Minster added: “Of course,
when the sketch is fairly well completed, I will show it to _you_, and
we will advise together,” and Jessica smiled again.When the two ladies were seated again in the sleigh, and the horses had
pranced their way through the wet snow up to the beaten track once more,
Miss Tabitha said:

“I never knew a girl to run on so in all my born days.Here you are,
seeing these two people for the very first time half an hour ago, and
you’ve tied yourself up to goodness only knows what.One would think
you’d known them all your life, the way you said ditto to every random
thing that popped into their heads.And a pretty penny they’ll make
it cost you, too!And what will your mother say?” Miss Minster smiled
good-naturedly, and patted her companion’s gloved hand with her own.“Never you worry, Tabitha,” she said, softly.“Don’t talk, please, for a
minute.I want to think.”

It was a very long minute.The young heiress spent it in gazing
abstractedly at the buttons on the coachman’s back, and the rapt
expression on her face seemed to tell more of a pleasant day-dream than
of serious mental travail.Miss Wilcox was accustomed to these moods
which called for silence, and offered no protest.At last Kate spoke, with a tone of affectionate command.“When we get to
the house I will give you a book to read, and I want you to finish every
word of it before you begin anything else.It is called ‘All Sorts and
Conditions of Men,’ and it tells how a lovely girl with whole millions
of pounds did good in England, and I was thinking of it all the while we
sat there in the shop.Only the mortification of it is, that in the
book the rich girl originated the idea herself, whereas I had to have
it hammered into my head by--by others.But you must read the book, and
hurry with it, because--or no: I will get another copy to read again
myself.And I will buy other copies; one for _her_ and one _for him_,
and one--”

She lapsed suddenly into silence again.The disparity between the
stupendous dream out of which the People’s Palace for East London’s
mighty hive of millions has been evolved, and the humble project of a
sitting-room or two for the factory-girls of a village, rose before her
vision, and had the effect of making her momentarily ridiculous in her
own eyes.The familiarity, too, with which she had labelled these two
strangers, this lawyer and this milliner, in her own thoughts, as “him”
 and “her,” jarred just a little upon her maidenly consciousness.Perhaps
she had rushed to embrace their scheme with too much avidity.It was
generally her fault to be over-impetuous.“Of course, what we can do here”--she began with less eagerness of tone,
thinking aloud rather than addressing Tabitha--“must at best be on
a very small scale.You must not be frightened by the book, where
everything is done with fairy prodigality, and the lowest figures dealt
with are hundreds of thousands.I only want you to read it that you may
catch the spirit of it, and so understand how I feel.And you needn’t
worry about my wasting money, or doing anything foolish, you dear, timid
old soul!”

Miss Wilcox, in her revolving mental processes, had somehow veered
around to an attitude of moderate sympathy with the project, the while
she listened to these words.“I’m sure you won’t, my dear,” she replied,
quite sweetly.“And I daresay there can really be a great deal of good
done, only, of course, it will have to be gone at cautiously and by
degrees.And we must let old Runkle do the papering and whitewashing;
don’t forget that.He’s had ever so much sickness in his family all the
winter, and work is so slack.”

“Do you know, I like your Mr.Tracy!” was Kate’s irrelevant reply.She
made it musingly, as if the idea were new to her mind.“You can see for yourself there couldn’t have been anything at all
in that spiteful Sarah Cheese-borough’s talk about him and her,” said
Tabitha, who now felt herself to have been all along the champion of
this injured couple.“How on earth a respectable woman can invent such
slanders beats my comprehension.”

Kate Minster laughed merrily aloud.“It’s lucky you weren’t made of
pancake batter, Tabitha,” she said with mock gravity; “for, if you had
been, you never could have stood this being stirred both ways.You would
have turned heavy and been spoiled.”

“Instead of which I live to spoil other people, eh?” purred the
gratified old lady, shaking her curls with affectionate pride.“If we weren’t out in the street, I believe I should kiss you, Tabitha,”
 said the girl.“You can’t begin to imagine how delightfully you have
behaved today!”




CHAPTER XVII.--TRACY HEARS STRANGE THINGS.REUBEN’S first impulse, when he found himself alone in the little shop
with his former pupil, was to say good-by and get out as soon as he
could.To the best of his recollection, he had never before been in a
store consecrated entirely to the fashions and finery of the opposite
sex, and he was oppressed by a sense of being an intruder upon an
exclusively feminine domain.The young girl, too, whom he had been
thinking of all this while as an unfortunate child whom he must watch
over and be good to, stood revealed before him as a self-controlled and
sophisticated woman, only a few years younger than himself in actual
age, and much wiser than himself in the matters of head-gear and
textures and colors which belonged to this place.He could have talked
freely to her in his law-office, with his familiar accessories of papers
and books about him.A background of bonnets was disconcerting.“How beautiful she is!” were Jessica’s first words, and they pleasurably
startled the lawyer from his embarrassed revery.“She is, indeed,” he answered, and somehow found himself hoping that the
conversation would cling to this subject a good while.“I had never met
her before, as you saw, but of course I have known her by sight a long
time.”

“I don’t think I ever saw her before to-day,” said Jessica.“How
wonderful it seems that she should have come, and then that you came,
too, and that you both should like the plan, and take it up so, and make
a success of it right at the start.”

Reuben smiled.“In your eagerness to keep up with the procession I fear
you are getting ahead of the band,” he said.“I wouldn’t quite call it
a success, at present.But, no doubt, it’s a great thing to have her
enlisted in it.I’m glad she likes you; her friendship will make all the
difference in the world to you, here in Thessaly.”

The girl did not immediately answer, and Tracy, looking at her as she
walked across to the showcase, was surprised to catch the glisten of
tears on her eyelashes.He had no idea what to say, but waited in pained
puzzlement for her to speak.“‘Friendship’ is not quite the word,” she said at last, looking up at
him and smiling with mournful softness through her tears.“I shall be
glad if she likes me--as you say, it will be a great thing if she helps
me--but we shall hardly be ‘friends,’ you know._She_ would never call
it that.oh, no!”

Her voice trembled audibly over these last words, and she began
hurriedly to re-arrange some of the articles in the showcase, with the
obvious design of masking her emotion.“You can do yourself no greater harm than by exaggerating that kind of
notion, my girl,” said Reuben Tracy, in his old gravely kind voice.“You
would put thoughts into her head that way which she had never dreamt of
otherwise; that is, if she weren’t a good and sensible person.Why, she
is a woman like yourself--”

“Oh, no, no!_Not_ like _me!_”

Tracy was infinitely touched by the pathos of this deprecating wail,
but he went on as if he had not heard it: “A woman like yourself, with
a heart turned in mercy and charity toward other women who are not so
strong to help themselves.Why on earth should you vex your soul with
fears that she will be unkind to you, when she showed you as plain
as the noonday sun her desire _to_ be kind?You mustn’t yield to such
fancies.”

“Kind, yes!But you don’t understand--you _can’t_ understand.I
shouldn’t have spoken as I did.It was a mere question of a word,
anyway.”

Jessica smiled again, to show that, though the tears were still there,
the grief behind them was to be regarded as gone, and added, “Yes, she
was kindness itself.”

“She is very rich in her own right, I believe, and if her interest
in your project is genuine--that is, of the kind that lasts--you will
hardly need any other assistance.Of course you must allow for the
chance of her dropping the idea as suddenly as she picked it up.Rich
women--rich people generally, for that matter--are often flighty about
such things.‘Put not your trust in princes,’ serves as a warning about
millionnaires as well as monarchs.The rest of us are forced to be
more or less continuous in what we think and do.We have to keep at the
things we’ve started, because a waste of time would be serious to us.We have to keep the friends and associates we’ve got, because others
are not to be had for the asking.But these favored people are more
free--their time doesn’t matter, and they can find new sets of friends
ready made whenever they weary of the others.Still, let us hope she
will be steadfast.She has a strong face, at all events.”

The girl had listened to this substantial dissertation with more or less
comprehension, but with unbounded respect.Anything that Reuben Tracy
said she felt must be good.Besides, his conclusion jumped with her
hopes.“I’m not afraid of her losing interest in the thing itself,” she
answered.“What worries me is--or, no--” She stopped herself with a
smile, and made haste to add, “I forgot.Tell me about her.”

“She owns a share of the works, I think.I don’t know how big a share,
or, in fact, much else about her.I’ve heard my partner, Horace Boyce,
talk lately a good deal--”

Tracy did not finish his sentence, for Jessica had sunk suddenly into
the chair behind the case, and was staring at him over the glass-bound
row of bonnets with wide-open, startled eyes.“_Your partner!_ Yours, did you say?That man?”

Her tone and manner very much surprised Reuben.“Why, yes, he’s my
partner,” he said, slowly and in wonderment.“Didn’t you know that?We’ve been together since December.”

She shook her head, and murmured something hastily about having been
very busy, and being cooped up on a back street.This did not explain her agitation, which more and more puzzled Reuben
as he thought upon it.He stood looking down upon her where she sat, and
noted that her face, though it was turned away from him now, was both
pale and excited.“Do you know him?” he asked finally.She shook her head again, and the lawyer fancied she was biting her
lips.He did not know well what else to say, and was speculating whether
it would not be best to say nothing, when all at once she burst forth
vehemently.“I _won’t_ lie to you!” she exclaimed.“I _did_ know him, very much to
my cost.Don’t you trust him, I say!He’s
not fit to be with you.Oh, my God!--_don’t_ I know Horace Boyce!”

Reuben stood silent, still looking down gravely into the girl’s flashing
eyes.What she had said annoyed and disturbed him, but what he thought
chiefly about was how to avoid bringing on an explanation which must
wound and humiliate her feelings.It was clear enough what she meant,
and he compassionately hoped she would not feel it necessary to add
anything.Above all things he felt that he wanted to spare her pain.“I understand,” he said at last, as the frankest way out of the dilemma.“Don’t say any more.” He pondered for a minute or so upon the propriety
of not saying anything more himself, and then with decision offered her
his hand across the showcase, and held hers in his expansive clasp with
what he took to be fatherly sympathy, as he said:

“I must go now.And I shall hear from you soon about the
project?” He smiled to reassure her, and added, still holding her hand,
“Now, don’t you let worry come inside these doors at all.You have made
a famous start, and everything will go well, believe me.”

Then he went out, and the shrill clamor of the bell hung to jangle
when the door was opened woke Jessica from her day-dream, just as the
sunbeams had begun to drive away the night.She rose with a start, and walked to the door to follow his
retiring figure through the glass.She stood there, lost in another
revery--vague, languorous, half-bright, half-hideous--until the door
from the back room was opened, and Samantha’s sharp voice fell on the
silence of the little shop.“I ain’t going to set in that poky old kitchen any longer for all
the bonnets in your whole place,” she remarked, with determination,
advancing to the mirror with the toque on her truculently poised head.“Besides, you said you’d call us when they were all gone.”

Lucinda stole up to her sister-employer, and murmured in a side-long
whisper: “I couldn’t keep her from listening a little.She heard what you said about that Boyce chap.”

The tidings angered Jessica even more than they alarmed her.With an
impulse equally illogical and natural, she frowned at Samantha, and
stiffened her fingers claw-wise, with a distinct itching to tear that
arrangement of bronze velvet and sage-green feathers from her perfidious
sister’s head.Curiously enough, it was the usually aggressive Lucinda who counselled
prudence.“If I was you, I’d ask her to stay to dinner,” she said,
in the same furtive undertone.“I’ve been talking to her, and I guess
she’ll be all right if we make it kind o’ pleasant for her when she
comes.But if you rub her the wrong way, she’ll scratch.”

Samantha was asked to dinner, and stayed, and later, being offered her
choice of three hat-pins with heads of ornamented jet, took two.*****

Reuben walked slowly back to the office, and then sat through a solitary
meal at a side-table in the Dearborn House dining-room, although his
customary seat was at the long table down the centre, in order that he
might think over what he had heard.It is not clear that the isolated fact disclosed to him in the
milliner’s shop would, in itself, have been sufficient to awaken in his
mind any serious distrust of his partner.As the sexes have different
trainings and different spheres, so they have different standards.Men
set up the bars, for instance, against a brother who cheats at cards, or
divulges what he has heard in his club, or borrows money which he cannot
repay, or pockets cigars at feasts when he does not himself smoke.But
their courts of ethics do not exercise jurisdiction over sentimental or
sexual offences, as a rule.These the male instinct vaguely refers to
some other tribunal, which may or may not be in session somewhere else.And this male instinct is not necessarily co-existent with immoral
tendencies, or blunted sensibilities, or even indifference: it is the
man’s way of looking at it--just as it is his way to cross a muddy
street on his toes, while his sisters perform the same feat on their
heels.Reuben Tracy was a good man, and one with keen aspirations toward
honorable and ennobling things; but still he was a man, and it may
be that this discovery, standing by itself, would not seriously have
affected his opinion of Horace.In an indefinite kind of way, he was conscious of being less attracted
by the wit and sparkling smalltalk of Horace than he had been at first.Somehow, the young man seemed to have exhausted his store; he began to
repeat himself, as if he had already made the circuit of the small ring
around which his mind travelled.Reuben confronted a suspicion that the
Boyce soil was shallow.This might not be necessarily an evil thing, he said to himself.Lawyers
quite often achieved notable successes before juries, who were not
deep or well-grounded men.Horace was versatile, and versatility was
a quality which Reuben distinctly lacked.From that point of view the
combination ought, therefore, to be of value.Versatility of that variety was not so
admirable.Reuben could count
on his fingers now six separate falsehoods that his partner had already
told him.They happened not to be upon vital or even important subjects,
but that did not render them the more palatable.He knew from other sources
that Horace had been intrusted with the papers left to Mr.Clarke’s
executors.The young man had taken them to his father’s house, and had
never mentioned so much as a syllable about them to his partner.No
doubt, Horace felt that he ought to have this as his personal business,
and upon the precedent Reuben himself had set with the railroad work,
this was fair enough.But there was something underhanded in his secrecy
about the matter.Reuben’s thoughts from this drifted to the Minsters themselves, and
centred reverently upon the luminous figure of that elder daughter
whom he had met an hour before.He did not dwell much upon her
beauty--perhaps he was a trifle dull about such things--but her
graciousness, her sweet interest in the charity, her womanly commingling
of softness and enthusiasm, seemed to shine about him as he mused.Thessaly unconsciously assumed a brighter and more wholesome aspect,
with much less need of reform than before, in his mind’s eye, now that
he thought of it as her home.The prosperous and respected lawyer was still a country boy
in his unformed speculations as to what that home might be like.The
Minster house was the most splendid mansion in Dearborn County, it was
said, but his experience with mansions was small.A hundred times it had
been said to him that he could go anywhere if he liked, and he gave the
statement credence enough.But somehow it happened that he had not gone.To “be in society,” as the phrase went, had not seemed important to him.Now, almost for the first time, he found himself regretting this.Then
he smiled somewhat scowlingly at his plate as the vagrant reflection
came up that his partner contributed social status as well as
versatility and mendacity to the outfit of the firm.Horace Boyce had a
swallowtail coat, and visited at the Minsters’.The reflection was not
altogether grateful to him.Reuben rose from the table, and stood for a few moments by the window
overlooking the veranda and the side street.The sunny warmth of the
thawing noon-day had made it possible to have the window open, and the
sound of voices close at hand showed that there were people already
anticipating pneumonia and the springtime by sitting on the porch
outside.These voices conveyed no distinct impression at first to Reuben’s mind,
busy as he was with his own reflections.But all at once there was a
scraping of feet and chair-legs on the floor, signifying that the party
had risen, and then he heard two remarks which made a sharp appeal to
his attention and interest.The first voice said: “Mind, I’m not going to let you put me into a
hole.What I do, I do only when it has been proved to me to be to my
own interest, and not at all because I’m afraid of you.Understand that
clearly!”

The other voice replied: “All that you need be afraid of is that you
will kick over your own bucket of milk.You’ve got the whole game in
your hands, if you only listen to me and don’t play it like a fool.Shall we go up to your house and put the thing into shape?We can be alone there.”

The voices ceased, and there was a sound of footsteps descending from
the porch to the sidewalk.The two men passed before the window,
ducking their heads for protection against the water dripping from the
overflowed eaves on the roof of the veranda, and thus missing sight of
the man who had overheard them.Reuben had known at once by the sound of the voice that the first
speaker was Horace Boyce.He recognized his companion now as Schuyler
Tenney, and the sight startled him.Just why it should have done so, he could not have explained.He had
seen this Schuyler Tenney almost every day for a good many years,
putting them all together, and had never before been troubled, much less
alarmed, by the spectacle.But coming now upon what Jessica had
told him, and what his own thoughts had evolved, and what he had
inadvertently overheard, the figure of the rising hardware merchant
loomed darkly in his perturbed fancy as an evil and threatening thing.A rustic client with a grievance sought Tracy out in the seclusion
of the dining-room, and dragged him back to his office and into the
intricacies of the law of trespass; but though he did his best to listen
and understand, the farmer went away feeling that his lawyer was a
considerably overrated man.For, strive as he might, Reuben could not get the sound of those words,
“you’ve got the whole game in your hands,” out of his ears, or restrain
his mind from wearying itself with the anxious puzzle of guessing what
that game could be.CHAPTER XVIII.--A SIMPLE BUSINESS TRANSACTION.Schuyler Tenney had never before been afforded an opportunity of
studying a young gentleman of fashion and culture in the intimacy of
his private apartments, and he looked about Horace’s room with lively
curiosity and interest, when the two conspirators had entered the
General’s house, gone up-stairs, and shut doors behind them.“It looks like a ninety-nine-cent store, for all the world,” was his
comment when he had examined the bric-à-brac on the walls and mantels,
“hefted” a bronze trifle or two on the table, and taken a comprehensive
survey of the furniture and hangings.“It’s rather bare than otherwise,” said Horace, carelessly.“I got
a tolerably decent lot of traps together when I had rooms in Jermyn
Street, but I had to let most of them go when I pulled up stakes to come
home.”

“German Street?I suppose that is in Germany?”

“No--London.”

“Oh!Sold ’em because you got hard up?”

“Not at all.But this damned tariff of yours--or ours--makes it cost too
much to bring decent things over here.”

“Protection to American industry, my boy,” said Mr.“We
couldn’t get on a fortnight without it.Just think what--”

“Oh, hang it all, man!We didn’t come here to talk tariff!” Horace broke
in, with a smile which was half annoyance.“No, that’s so,” assented Mr.Tenney, settling himself in the low,
deep-backed easy-chair, and putting the tips of his lean fingers
together.“No, we didn’t, for a fact.” He added, after a moment’s pause:
“I guess I’ll have to rig up a room like this myself, when the thing
comes off.” He smiled icily to himself at the thought.“Meanwhile, let us talk about the ‘thing,’ as you call it.Will you have
a drink?”

“Never touch it,” said Mr.Tenney, and he looked curiously on while
Horace poured out some brandy, and then opened a bottle of soda-water to
go with it.He was particularly impressed by the little wire frame-work
stand made to hold the round-bottomed bottle, and asked its cost, and
wondered if they wouldn’t be a good thing to keep in the store.“Now to business!” said Horace, dragging out from under a sofa the black
tin box which held the Minster papers, and throwing back its cover.“I’ve told you pretty well what there is in here.”

Mr.Tenney took from his pocket-book the tabular statement Horace had
made of the Minster property, and smoothed it out over his pointed knee.“It’s a very pretty table,” he said; “no bookkeeper could have done it
better.I know it by heart, but we’ll keep it here in sight while you
proceed.”

“There’s nothing for me to proceed with,” said Horace, lolling back
in his chair in turn.“I want to hear _you!_ Don’t let us waste time.Broadly, what do you propose?”

“Broadly, what does everybody propose?To get for himself what somebody
else has got.It’s every kind of nature, down to
the little chickens just hatched who start to chase the chap with the
worm in his mouth before they’ve fairly got their tails out of the
shell.”

“You ought to write a book, Schuyler,” said Horace, using this
familiar name for the first time: “‘Tenney on Dynamic Sociology’!What particular worm have you got in your
bill’s eye?”

“We are all worms, so the Bible says.I suppose even those scrumptious
ladies there come under that head, like we ordinary mortals.” Mr.Tenney
pointed his agreeable metaphor by touching the paper on his knee with
his joined finger-tips, and showed his small, sharpened teeth in a
momentary smile.“I follow you,” said Horace, tentatively.“Go on!”

“That’s a heap of money that you’ve ciphered out there, on that paper.”

“Yes.True, it isn’t ours, and we’ve got nothing to do with it.Go on!”

“A good deal of it can be ours, if you’ve got the pluck to go in with
me.”

Horace frowned.“Upon my word, Tenney,” he said, impatiently, “what do
you mean?”

“Jest what I said,” was the sententious and collected response.The younger man laughed with an uneasy assumption of scorn.“Is it
a burglary you do me the honor to propose, or only common or garden
robbery?Ought we to manage a little murder in the thing, or what do you
say to arson?Upon my word, man, I believe that you don’t realize that
what you’ve said is an insult!”

“No, I don’t.You’re right there,” said the hardware merchant, in no
wise ruffled.“But I do realize that you come pretty near being the
dod-blamedest fool in Dearborn County.”

“Much obliged for the qualification, I’m sure,” retorted Horace, who
felt the mists of his half-simulated, half-instinctive anger fading away
before the steady breath of the other man’s purpose.Pray go on.”

“There ain’t no question of dishonesty about the thing, not the
slightest.I ain’t that kind of a man!” Horace permitted himself a
shadowy smile, emphasized by a subdued little sniff, which Tenney caught
and was pleased to appear to resent, “Thessaly knows me!” he said, with
an air of pride.“They ain’t a living man--nor a dead one nuther--can
put his finger on me.I’ve lived aboveboard, sir, and owe no man a red
cent, and I defy anybody to so much as whisper a word about my
character.”

“‘Tenney on Faith Justified by Works,’” commented Horace, softly,
smiling as much as he dared, but in a less aggressive manner.“Works--yes!” said the hardware merchant, “the Minster iron-works, in
particular.” He seemed pleased with his little joke, and paused to dwell
upon it in his mind for an instant.Then he went on, sitting upright in
his chair now, and displaying a new earnestness:

“Dishonesty is wrong, and it is foolish.It gets a man disgraced, and
it gets him in jail.A smart
man can get money in a good many ways without giving anybody a chance
to call him dishonest.I have thought out several plans--some of
them strong at one point, others at another, but all pretty middlin’
good--how to feather our own nests out of this thing.”

“Well?” said Horace, interrogatively.Tenney did not smile any more, and he had done with digressions.“First of all,” he said, with his intent gray eyes fixed on the young
man’s face, “what guarantee have I that you won’t give me away?”

“What guarantee _can_ I give you?” replied Horace, also sitting up.“Perhaps you are right,” said Tenney, thinking in his own swift-working
mind that it would be easy enough to take care of this poor creature
later on.“Well, then, you’ve been appointed Mrs.Minster’s lawyer in
the interest of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company--this company
here marked ‘D,’ in which the family has one hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars.”

“I gathered as much.Perhaps you wouldn’t mind telling me what it is all
about.”

“I’m as transparent as plate-glass when I think a man is acting square
with me,” said the hardware merchant.Wendover and
me got hold of a little rolling-mill and nail-works at Cadmus, down on
the Southern Tier, a few years ago.Some silly people had put up the
money for it, and there was a sort of half-crazy inventor fellow running
it.They were making ducks and drakes of the whole thing, and I saw
a chance of getting into the concern--I used to buy a good deal of
hardware from them, and knew how they stood--and I spoke to Wendover,
and so we went in.”

“That means that the other people were put out, I suppose,” commented
Horace.“Well, no; but they kind o’ faded away like.I wouldn’t exactly say they
were put out, but after a while they didn’t seem to be able to stay in.The iron fields
around there had pretty well petered out, and we were way off the main
line of transportation.Business was fair enough; we made a straight ten
per cent, year in and year out, because the thing was managed carefully;
but that was in spite of a lot of drawbacks.So I got a scheme in my
head to move the whole concern up here to Thessaly, and hitch it up with
the Minster iron-works.We could save one dollar a ton, or forty-five
thousand dollars in all, in the mere matter of freight alone, if we
could use up their entire output.I may tell you, I didn’t appear in the
business at all.Minster don’t know to this day that I’m
a kind of partner of hers.It happened that Wendover used to know her
when she was a girl--they both come from down the Hudson somewhere--and
so he worked the thing with her, and we moved over from Cadmus, hook,
line, bob, and sinker, and we’re the Thessaly Manufacturing Company.Do
you see?”

“So far, yes.She and her daughters have one hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars cash in it.What is the rest of the company like?”

“It’s stocked at four hundred thousand dollars.We put in all our plant
and machinery and business and good-will and so on at one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars, and then we furnished seventy-five thousand
dollars cash.So we hold two hundred and twenty-five shares to their one
hundred and seventy-five.”

“Who are the ‘we’?”

“Well, Pete Wendover and me are about the only people you’re liable to
meet around the premises, I guess.There are some other names on the
books, but they don’t amount to much.We can wipe them off whenever we
like.”

“I notice that this company has paid no dividends since it was formed.”

“That’s because of the expense of building.And we ain’t got what you
may call fairly to work yet.There is big money in
it.”

“I daresay,” observed Horace.“But, if you will excuse the remark, I
seem to have missed that part of your statement which referred to _my_
making something out of the company.”

The hardware merchant allowed his cold eyes to twinkle for an instant.“You’ll be taken care of,” he said, confidentially.“Don’t fret your
gizzard about _that!_”

Horace smiled.It seemed to be easier to get on with Tenney than he had
thought.“But what am I to do; that is, if I decide to do anything?” he
asked.“I confess I don’t see your scheme.”

“Why, that’s curious,” said the other, with an air of candor.“And you
lawyers have the name of being so ’cute, too!”

“I don’t suppose we see through a stone wall much farther than other
people.Our chief advantage is in being able to recognize that it is a
wall.And this one of yours seems to be as thick and opaque as most, I’m
bound to say.”

“We don’t want you to do anything, just now,” Mr.“Things may turn up in which you can be of assistance, and then we want
to count on you, that’s all.”

This was a far less lucid explanation than Horace had looked for.Tenney
had been so anxious for a confidential talk, and had hinted of such
dazzling secrets, that this was a distinct disappointment.“What did you mean by saying that I had the whole game in my hands?”
 he demanded, not dissembling his annoyance.“Thus far, you haven’t even
dealt me any cards!”

Mr.Tenney lay back in his chair again, and surveyed Horace over his
finger-tips.“There is to be a game, young man, and you’ve been put in
a position to play in it when the time comes.But I should be a
particularly simple kind of goose to tell you about it beforehand; now,
wouldn’t I?”

Thus candidly appealed to, Horace could not but admit that his
companion’s caution was defensible.“Please yourself,” he said.“I daresay you’re right enough.I’ve got the
position, as you say.Perhaps it is through you that it came to me; I’ll
concede that, for argument’s sake.You are not a man who expects people
to act from gratitude alone.Therefore you don’t count upon my doing
things for you in this position, even though you put me there, unless
you first convince me that they will also benefit me.That is clear
enough, isn’t it?When the occasion
arises that you need me, you can tell me what it is, and what I am to
get out of it, and then we’ll talk business.”

Mr.Tenney had not lifted his eyes for a moment from his companion’s
face.Had his own countenance been one on which inner feelings were
easily reflected, it would just now have worn an expression of amused
contempt.“Well, this much I might as well tell you straight off,” he said.“A
part of my notion, if everything goes smoothly, is to have Mrs.Minster
put you into the Thessaly Manufacturing Company as her representative
and to pay you five thousand dollars a year for it, which might be fixed
so as to stand separate from the other work you do for her.Wendover
can arrange that with her.And then I am counting now on declaring
myself up at the Minster works, and putting in my time up there; so that
your father will be needed again in the store, and it might be so that
I could double his salary, and let him have back say a half interest
in the business, and put him on his feet.I say these things _might_ be
done.I don’t say I’ve settled on them, mind!”

“And you still think it best to keep me in the dark; not to tell me what
it is I’m to do?” Horace leant forward, and asked this question eagerly.“No-o--I’ll tell you this much.Your business will be to say ditto to
whatever me and Wendover say.”

A full minute’s pause ensued, during which Mr.Tenney gravely watched
Horace sip what remained of his drink.Do you go in with us?” he asked, at last.“I’d better think it over,” said Horace.“Give me, say, till
Monday--that’s five days.And of course, if I do say yes, it will
be understood that I am not to be bound to do anything of a shady
character.”

“Certainly; but you needn’t worry about that,” answered Tenney.“Everything will be as straight as a die.There will be nothing but a
simple business transaction.”

“What did you mean by saying that we should take some of the Minster
money away?That had a queer sound.”

“All business consists in getting other people’s money,” said the
hardware merchant, sententiously.“Where do you suppose Steve Minster
got his millions?Didn’t every dollar
pass through some other fellow’s pocket before it reached his?The
only difference was that when it got into his pocket it stuck there.Everybody is looking out to get rich; and when a man succeeds, it only
means that somebody else has got poor.That’s plain common-sense!”

The conversation practically ended here.Tenney devoted some quarter
of an hour to going severally over all the papers in the Minster box,
but glancing through only those few which referred to the Thessaly
Manufacturing Company.The proceeding seemed to Horace to be irregular,
but he could not well refuse, and Tenney was not interrupted.When
he had finished his task he shook hands with Horace with a novel
cordiality, and it was not difficult to guess that the result of his
search had pleased him.“You are sure those are all the papers Clarke left to be turned over?”
 he asked.Upon being assured in the affirmative his eyes emitted a
glance which was like a flash of light, and his lip lifted in a smile of
obvious elation.“There’s a fortune for both of us,” he said, jubilantly, as he unlocked
the door, and shook hands again.When he had gone, Horace poured out another drink and sat down to
meditate.CHAPTER XIX.--NO MESSAGE FOR MAMMA.Four days of anxious meditation did not help Horace Boyce to clear his
mind, and on the fifth he determined upon a somewhat desperate step, in
the hope that its issue would assist decision.Two ways of acquiring a
fortune lay before him.One was to marry Kate Minster; the other was
to join the plot against her property and that of her family, which the
subtile Tenney was darkly shaping.The misery of the situation was that he must decide at once which of
the ways he would choose.In his elation at being selected as the legal
adviser and agent of these millionnaire women, no such contingency as
this had been foreseen.He had assumed that abundant time would be at
his disposal, and he had said to himself that with time all things may
be accomplished with all women.But this precious element of time had been harshly cut out of his plans,
here at the very start.The few days reluctantly granted him had gone
by, one by one, with cruel swiftness, and to-morrow would be Monday--and
still his mind was not made up.If he could be assured that Miss Minster would marry him, or at least
admit him to the vantage-ground of _quasi-recognition_ as a suitor, the
difficulty would be solved at once.He would turn around and defend
her and her people against the machinations of Tenney.Just what the
machinations were he could not for the life of him puzzle out, but he
felt sure that, whatever their nature, he could defeat them, if only
he were given the right to do battle in the name of the family, as a
prospective member of it.On the other hand, it might be that he had no present chance with Miss
Minster as an eligible husband.What would happen if he relied on a
prospect which turned out not to exist?His own opportunity to share
in the profits of Tenney’s plan would be abruptly extinguished, and his
father would be thrown upon the world as a discredited bankrupt.Sometimes the distracted young man thought he caught glimpses of a safe
middle course.In these sanguine moments it seemed feasible to give in
his adhesion to Tenney’s scheme, and go along with him for a certain
time, say until the intentions of the conspirators were revealed.Then
he might suddenly revolt, throw himself into a virtuous attitude, and
win credit and gratitude at the hands of the family by protecting them
from their enemies.Then the game would be in his own hands, and no
mistake!But there were other times when this course did not present so many
attractions to his mind--when it was borne in upon him that Tenney would
be a dangerous kind of man to betray.He had seen merciless and terrible
depths in the gray eyes of the hardware merchant--depths which somehow
suggested bones stripped clean of their flesh, sucked bare of their
marrow, at the bottom of a gloomy sea.In these seasons of doubt, which
came mostly in the early morning when he first awoke, the mere thought
of Tenney’s hatred made him shudder.It was as if Hugo’s devil-fish had
crawled into his dreams.So Sunday afternoon came and found the young man still perplexed and
harassed.To do him justice, he had once or twice dwelt momentarily on
the plan of simply defying Tenney and doing his duty by the Minsters,
and taking his chances.The
case was too complicated for mere honesty.The days of martyrdom were
long since past.One needed to be smarter than one’s neighbors in these
later times.To eat others was the rule now, if one would save himself
from being devoured.It was at least clear to his mind that he must be
smart, and play his hand so as to get the odd trick even if honors were
held against him.Horace decided finally that the wisest thing he could do would be to
call upon the Minsters before nightfall, and trust to luck for some
opportunity of discovering Miss Kate’s state of mind toward him.He
was troubled more or less by fears that Sunday might not be regarded
in Thessaly as a proper day for calls, as he dressed himself for
the adventure.But when he got upon the street, the fresh air and
exhilaration oc exercise helped to reassure him.Before he reached the
Minster gate he had even grown to feel that the ladies had probably had
a dull day of it, and would welcome his advent as a diversion.He was shown into the stately parlor to the left of the wide hall--a
room he had not seen before--and left to sit there in solitude for some
minutes.This term of waiting he employed in looking over the portraits
on the wall and the photographs on the mantels and tables.Aside from
several pictures of the dissipated Minster boy who had died, he could
see no faces of young men anywhere, and he felt this to be a good sign
as he tiptoed his way back to his seat by the window.Fortune smiled at least upon the opening of his enterprise.It was Miss
Kate who came at last to receive him, and she came alone.The young
man’s cultured sense of beauty and breeding was caressed and captivated
as it had never been before--at least in America, he made mental
reservation--as she came across the room toward him, and held out her
hand.He felt himself unexpectedly at ease, as he returned her greeting
and looked with smiling warmth into her splendid eyes.He touched lightly upon his doubts
as to making calls on Sunday, and how they were overborne by the
unspeakable tedium of his own rooms.Then he spoke of the way the more
unconventional circles of London utilize the day, and of the contrasting
features of the Continental Sunday.Miss Kate seemed interested, and
besides explaining that her mother was writing letters and that her
sister was not very well, bore a courteous and affable part in the
exchange of small-talk.For a long time nothing was said which enabled Horace to feel that the
purpose of his visit had been or was likely to be served.Then, all at
once, through a most unlikely channel, the needed personal element was
introduced.“Mamma tells me,” she said, when a moment’s pause had sufficed to
dismiss some other subject, “that she has turned over to you such of
her business as poor old Mr.Clarke used to take care of, and that your
partner, Mr.Tracy, has nothing to do with that particular branch
of your work.I thought partners always shared
everything.”

“Oh, not at all,” replied Horace.Tracy, for example, has railroad
business which he keeps to himself.He is the attorney for this section
of the road, and of course that is a personal appointment.He couldn’t
share it with me, any more than the man in the story could make his wife
and children corporals because he had been made one himself.Tracy was expressly mentioned by your mother as not to be included
in the transfer of business.It was her notion.”

“Ah, indeed!” said that young woman, with a slight instantaneous lifting
of the black brows which Horace did not catch.Isn’t he nice?”

“Well, yes; he’s an extremely good fellow, in his way,” the partner
admitted, looking down at his glossy boots in well-simulated hesitation.“That little word ‘nice’ means so many things upon feminine lips,
you know,” he added with a smile.“Perhaps he wouldn’t answer your
definition of it all around.He’s very honest, and he is a prodigious
worker, but--well, to be frank, he’s farm bred, and I daresay your
mother suspected the existence of--what shall I say?--an uncouth side?Really, I don’t think that there was anything more than that in it.”

“So you furnish the polish, and he the honesty and industry?Is that
it?”

The words were distinctly unpleasant, and Horace looked up swiftly to
the speaker’s face, feeling that his own was flushed.But Miss Kate was
smiling at him, with a quizzical light dancing in her eyes, and this
reassured him on the instant.Evidently she felt herself on easy terms
with him, and this was merely a bit of playful chaff.“We don’t put it quite in that way,” he said, with an answering laugh.“It would be rather egotistical, on both sides.”

“Nowadays everybody resents that imputation as if it were a cardinal
sin.There was a time when self-esteem was taken for granted.I suppose
it went out with chain-armor and farthingales.” She spoke in a musing
tone, and added after a tiny pause, “That must have been a happy time,
at least for those who wore the armor and the brocades.”

Horace leaped with avidity at the opening.“Those were the days of
romance,” he said, with an effort at the cooing effect in his voice.“Perhaps they were not so altogether lovely as our fancy paints them;
but, all the same, it is very sweet to have the fancy.Whether it be
historically true or not, those who possess it are rich in their own
mind’s right.They can always escape from the grimy and commercial
conditions of this present work-a-day life.All one’s finer senses can
feed, for example, on a glowing account of an old-time tournament--with
the sun shining on the armor and burnished shields, and the waving
plumes and iron-clad horses and the heralds in tabards, and the rows of
fair ladies clustered about the throne--as it is impossible to do on the
report of a meeting of a board of directors, even when they declare you
an exceptionally large dividend.”

The young man kept a close watch upon this flow of words as it
proceeded, and felt satisfied with it.The young woman seemed to like it
too, for she had sunk back into her chair with an added air of ease, and
looked at him now with what he took to be a more sympathetic glance, as
she made answer:

“Why, you are positively romantic, Mr.Boyce!”

“Me?My dear Miss Minster, I am the most sentimental person alive,”
 Horace protested gayly.“Don’t you find that it interferes with your profession?” she asked,
with that sparkle of banter in her dark eyes which he began to find so
delicious.“I thought lawyers had to eschew sentiment.Or perhaps you
supply _that_, too, in this famous partnership of yours!”

Horace laughed with pleasure.“Would you like me the less if I admitted
it?” he queried.“How could I?” she replied on the instant, still with the smile which
kept him from shaping a harsh interpretation of her words.“But isn’t
Thessaly a rather incongruous place for sentimental people?We have no
tourney-field--only rolling-mills and button-factories and furnaces; and
there isn’t a knight, much less a herald in a tabard, left in the whole
village.Their places have been taken by moulders and puddlers.So what
will the minstrel do then, poor thing?”

“Let him come here sometimes,” said the young man, in the gravely ardent
tone which this sort of situation demanded.“Let him come here, and
forget that this is the nineteenth century; forget time and Thessaly
altogether.”

“Oh, but mamma wouldn’t like that at all; I mean about your forgetting
so much.She expects you particularly to remember both time _and_
Thessaly.No, decidedly; that would never do!”

The smile and the glance were intoxicating.The young man made his
plunge.“But _may_ I come?” His voice had become low and vibrant, and it went on
eagerly: “May I come if I promise to remember everything; if I swear
to remember nothing else save what you--and your mother--would have me
charge my memory with?”

“We are always glad to see our friends on Tuesdays, from two to five.”

“But I am not in the plural,” he urged, gently.“We are,” she made answer, still watching him with a smile, from where
she half-reclined in the easy-chair.Her face was in the shadow of the
heavier under-curtains; the mellow light gave it a uniform tint of ivory
washed with rose, and enriched the wonder of her eyes, and softened into
melting witchery the lines of lips and brows and of the raven diadem of
curls upon her forehead.“Yes; in that the graces and charms of a thousand perfect women are
centred here in one,” murmured Horace.It was in his heart as well as
his head to say more, but now she rose abruptly at this, with a laugh
which for the instant disconcerted him.“Oh, I foresee _such_ a future for this firm of yours,” she cried, with
high merriment alike in voice and face.As they both stood in the full light of the window, the young man
somehow seemed to miss that yielding softness in her face which had
lulled his sense and fired his senses in the misleading shadows of the
curtain.It was still a very beautiful face, but there was a great deal
of self-possession in it.Perhaps it would be as well just now to go no
further.“We must try to live up to your good opinion, and your kindly forecast,”
 he said, as he momentarily touched the hand she offered him.“You cannot
possibly imagine how glad I am to have braved the conventionalities in
calling, and to have found you at home.It has transformed the rural
Sunday from a burden into a beatitude.”

“How pretty, Mr.Is there any message for mamma?”

“Oh, why did you say that?” He ventured upon a tone of mock vexation.“I wanted so much to go away with the fancy that this was an enchanted
palace, and that you were shut up alone in it, waiting for--”

“Tuesdays, from two till five,” she broke in, with a bow, in the same
spirit of amiable raillery, and so he said good-by and made his way out.Horace took a long
walk before he finally turned his steps homeward, and pondered these
problems excitedly in his mind.On the whole, he concluded that he could
win her.That she was for herself better worth the winning than even for
her million, he said to himself over and over again with rapture.*****

Miss Kate went up-stairs and into the sitting-room common to the
sisters, in which Ethel lay on the sofa in front of the fire-place.She
knelt beside this sofa, and held her hands over the subdued flame of the
maple sticks on the hearth.“It is so cold down in the parlor,” she remarked, by way of explanation.“He stayed an unconscionable while,” said Ethel.“What could he have
talked about?I had almost a mind to waive my headache and come down to
find out.It was a full hour.”

“He wouldn’t have thanked you if you had, my little girl,” replied Kate
with a smile.“Does he dislike little girls of nineteen so much?How unique!”

“No; but he came to make love to the big girl; that is why.”

Ethel sat bolt upright.“You don’t mean it!” she said, with her hazel
eyes wide open.“_He_ did,” was the sententious reply.Kate was busy warming the backs
of her hands now.And I lay here all the while, and never had so much as a
premonition.Was it very,
_very_ funny?Make haste and tell me.”

“Well, it _was_ funny, after a fashion.At least, we both laughed a good
deal.”

“How touching!Well?”

“That is all.I laughed at him, and he laughed--I suppose it must have
been at me--and he paid me some quite thrilling compliments, and
I replied, ‘Tuesdays, from two to five,’ like an educated
jackdaw--and--that was all.”

“What a romance!How could you think of such a clever answer, right on
the spur of the moment, too?But I always said you were the bright
one of the family, Kate.Perhaps one’s mind works better in the cold,
anyway.But I think he _might_ have knelt down.You should have put him
close to the register.I daresay the cold stiffened his joints.”

“Will you ever be serious, child?”

Ethel took her sister’s head in her hands and turned it gently, so that
she might look into the other’s face.“Is it possible that _you_ are serious, Kate?” she asked, in tender
wonderment.The elder girl laughed, and lifted herself to sit on the sofa beside
Ethel.“No, no; of course it isn’t possible,” she said, and put her arm about
the invalid’s slender waist.“But he’s great fun to talk to.I chaffed
him to my heart’s content, and he saw what I meant, every time, and
didn’t mind in the least, and gave me as good as I sent.It’s such a
relief to find somebody you can say saucy things to, and be quite sure
they understand them.I began by disliking him--and he _is_ as conceited
as a popinjay--but then he comprehended everything so perfectly, and
talked so well, that positively I found myself enjoying it.And he knew
his own mind, too, and was resolved to say nice things to me, and said
them, whether I liked or not.”

“But _did_ you ‘like,’ Kate?”

“No-o, I think not,” the girl replied, musingly.“But, all the same,
there was a kind of satisfaction in hearing them, don’t you know.”

The younger girl drew her sister’s head down to her shoulder, and
caressed it with her thin, white fingers.“You are not going to let your mind drift into anything foolish, Kate?”
 she said, with a quaver of anxiety in her tone.“You don’t know the man.You told me so, even from what you saw of him
on the train coming from New York.You said he patronized everybody and
everything, and didn’t have a good word to say for any one.Don’t you
know you did?And those first impressions are always nearest the truth.”

This recalled something to Kate’s mind.“You are right, puss,” she said.“It _is_ a failing of his.He spoke to-day almost contemptuously of
his partner--that Mr.Tracy whom I met in the milliner’s shop; and that
annoyed me at the time, for I liked Mr.Tracy’s looks and talk very much
indeed, _I_ shouldn’t call him uncouth, at all.”

“That was that Boyce man’s word, was it?” commented Ethel.“Well, then,
I think that beside his partner, he is a pretentious, disagreeable
monkey--there!”

Kate smiled at her sister’s vehemence.“At least it is an unprejudiced
judgment,” she said.“You don’t know either of them.”

“But I’ve seen them both,” replied Ethel, conclusively.In the great field of armed politics in Europe, every now and again
there arises a situation which everybody agrees must inevitably result
in war.Yet just when the newspapers have reached their highest state
of excitement, and “sensational incidents” and “significant occurrences”
 are crowding one another in the hurly-burly of alarmist despatches with
utmost impressiveness, somehow the cloud passes away, and the sun comes
out again--and nothing has happened.The sun did not precisely shine for Horace Boyce in the weeks which now
ensued, but at least the crisis that had threatened to engulf him was
curiously delayed.Tenney did not even ask him, on that dreaded
Monday, what decision he had arrived at.A number of other Mondays went
by, and still no demand was made upon him to announce his choice.On the
few occasions when he met his father’s partner, it was the pleasure of
that gentleman to talk on other subjects.The young man began to regain his equanimity.The February term of Oyer
and Terminer had come and gone, and Horace was reasonably satisfied with
the forensic display he had made.It would have been much better, he
knew, if he had not been worried about the other thing; but, as it was,
he had won two of the four cases in which he appeared, had got on well
with the judge, who invited him to dinner at the Dearborn House, and
had been congratulated on his speeches by quite a number of lawyers.His
foothold in Thessaly was established.Matters about the office had not gone altogether to his liking, it was
true.For some reason, Reuben seemed all at once to have become more
distant and formal with him.Horace could not dream that this arose from
the discoveries his partner had made at the milliner’s shop, and so put
the changed demeanor down vaguely to Reuben’s jealousy of his success
in court.He was sorry that this was so, because he liked Reuben
personally, and the silly fellow ought to be glad that he had such a
showy and clever partner, instead of sulking.Horace began to harbor the
notion that a year of this partnership would probably be enough for him.The Citizens’ Club had held two meetings, and Horace felt that the
manner in which he had presided and directed the course of action at
these gatherings had increased his hold upon the town.Nearly fifty
men had now joined the club, and next month they were to discuss the
question of a permanent habitation.They all seemed to like him
as president, and nebulous thoughts about being the first mayor of
Thessaly, when the village should get its charter, now occasionally
floated across the young man’s mind.He had called at the Minster house on each Tuesday since that
conversation with Miss Kate, and now felt himself to be on terms almost
intimate with the whole household.He could not say, even to himself,
that his suit had progressed much; but Miss Kate seemed to like him, and
her mother, whom he also had seen at other times on matters of business,
was very friendly indeed.Thus affairs stood with the rising young lawyer at the beginning of
March, when he one day received a note sent across by hand from Mr.Tenney, asking him to come over at once to the Dearborn House, and meet
him in a certain room designated by number.Horace was conscious of some passing surprise that Tenney should make
appointments in private rooms of the local hotel, but as he crossed the
street to the old tavern and climbed the stairs to the apartment named,
it did not occur to him that the summons might signify that the crisis
which had darkened the first weeks of February was come again.He found Tenney awaiting him at the door, and after he had perfunctorily
shaken hands with him, discovered that there was another man inside,
seated at the table in the centre of the parlor, under the chandelier.This man was past middle-age, and both his hair and the thick, short
beard which covered his chin and throat were nearly white.Horace noted
first that his long upper lip was shaven, and this grated upon him
afresh as one of the least lovely of provincial American customs.Then
he observed that this man had eyes like Tenney’s in expression, though
they were blue instead of gray; and as this resemblance came to him,
Tenney spoke:

“Judge Wendover, this is the young man we’ve been talking about--Mr.Horace Boyce, son of my partner, the General, you know.”

The mysterious New Yorker had at last appeared on the scene, then.He
did not look very mysterious, or very metropolitan either, as he rose
slowly and reached his hand across the table for Horace to shake.It was
a fat and inert hand, and the Judge himself, now that he stood up, was
seen to be also fat and dumpy in figure, with a bald head, noticeably
high at the back of the skull, and a loose, badly fitted suit of
clothes.“Sit down,” he said to Horace, much as if that young man had been a
stenographer called in to report a conversation.Horace took the chair
indicated, not over pleased.“I haven’t got much time,” the Judge continued, speaking apparently to
the papers in front of him.“There’s a good deal to do, and I’ve got to
catch that 5.22 train.”

“New Yorkers generally do have to catch trains,” remarked Horace.“So
far as I could see, the few times I’ve been there of late years, that is
always the chief thing on their minds.”

Judge Wendover looked at the young man for the space of a second, and
then turned to Tenney and said abruptly:

“I suppose he knows how the Thessaly Mfg.How it’s
stocked?” He pronounced the three letters with a slurring swiftness,
as if to indicate that there was not time enough for the full word
“manufacturing.”

Horace himself answered the question: “Yes, I know.You represent two
hundred and twenty-five to my clients’ one hundred and seventy-five.”
 The young man held himself erect and alert in his chair, and spoke
curtly.The capital is four hundred thousand dollars--all paid up.Well, we need that much more to go on.”

“How ‘go on’?What do you mean?”

“There’s a new nail machine just out which makes our plant worthless.To
buy that, and make the changes, will cost a round four hundred thousand
dollars.Get hold of that machine, and we control the whole United
States market; fail to get it, we go under.That’s the long and short of
it.That’s why we sent for you.”

“I’m very sorry,” said Horace, “but I don’t happen to have four hundred
thousand dollars with me just at the moment.If you’d let me known
earlier, now.”

The Judge looked at him again, with the impersonal point-blank stare
of a very rich and pre-occupied old man.Evidently this young fellow
thought himself a joker.“Don’t fool,” he said, testily.“Business is business, time is money.We can’t increase our capital by law, but we can borrow.You haven’t got
any money, but the Minster women have.It’s to their interest to stand
by us.They’ve got almost as much in the concern as we have.I’ve seen
the widow and explained the situation to her.But
she won’t back our paper, because her husband on his death-bed made her
promise never to do that for anybody.Curious prejudice these countrymen
have about indorsing notes.Business would stagnate in a day without
indorsing.Let her issue four hundred
thousand dollars in bonds on the iron-works.That’s about a third what
they are worth.She’ll consent to that if you talk to her.”

“Oh, _that’s_ where I come in, is it?” said Horace.“Where else did you suppose?” asked the Judge, puffing for breath, as he
eyed the young man.No answer was forthcoming, and the New Yorker went on:

“The interest on those bonds will cost her twenty-four thousand dollars
per year for a year or two, but it will make her shares in the Mfg.Company a real property instead of a paper asset.Besides, I’ve shown
her a way to-day, by going into the big pig-iron trust that is being
formed, of making twice that amount in half the time.Now, she’s going
to talk with you about both these things.Your play is to advise her to
do what I’ve suggested.”

“Why should I?” Horace put the question bluntly.“I’ll tell you,” answered the Judge, who seemed to like this direct
way of dealing.“You can make a pot of money by it.Tenney and I are not fishing with pin-hooks and thread.We’ve got nets,
young man.You tie up to us, and we’ll take care of you.When you see a
big thing like this travelling your way, hitch on to it.That’s the way
fortunes are made.And you’ve got a chance that don’t come to one young
fellow in ten thousand.”

“I should think he had,” put in Mr.Tenney, who had been a silent but
attentive auditor.“What will happen if I decline?” asked Horace.“She will lose her one hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars and
a good deal more, and you will lose your business with her and with
everybody else.”

“And your father will lose the precious little he’s got left,” put in
Mr.“Upon my word, you are frank,” he said.“There’s no time to be anything else,” replied the Judge.“And why
shouldn’t we be?A great commercial
transaction, involving profits to everybody, is outlined before you.It happens that by my recommendation you are in a place where you can
embarrass its success, for a minute or two, if you have a mind to.But
why in God’s name you should have a mind to, or why you take up time by
pretending to be offish about it, is more than I can make out.Damn it,
sir, you’re not a woman, who wants to be asked a dozen times!You’re a
man, lucky enough to be associated with other men who have their heads
screwed on the right way, and so don’t waste any more time.”

“Oh, that reminds me,” said Horace, “I haven’t thanked you for
recommending me.”

“You needn’t,” replied the Judge, bluntly.“It was Tenney’s doing.I
didn’t know you from a side of sole-leather.But _he_ thought you were
the right man for the place.”

“I hope you are not disappointed,” Horace remarked, with a questioning
smile.“A minute will tell me whether I am or not,” the New York man exclaimed,
letting his fat hand fall upon the table.Are you with us, or against us?”

“At all events not against you, I should hope.”

“Damn the man!Hasn’t he got a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ in him?--Tenney, you’re to
blame for this,” snapped Wendover, pulling his watch from the fob in his
tightened waistband, and scowling at the dial.“I’ll have to run, as it
is.”

He rose again from his chair, and bent a sharp gaze upon Horace’s face.“Well, young man,” he demanded, “what is your answer?”

“I think I can see my way to obliging you,” said Horace, hesitatingly.“But, of course, I want to know just how I am to stand in the--”

“That Tenney will see to,” said the Judge, swiftly.He gathered up the
papers on the table, thrust them into a portfolio with a lock on it,
which he gave to Tenney, snatched his hat, and was gone, without a word
of adieu to anybody.“Great man of business, that!” remarked the hardware merchant, after a
moment of silence.Horace nodded assent, but his mind had not followed the waddling figure
of the financier.It was dwelling perplexedly upon the outcome of this
adventure upon which he seemed to be fully embarked, and trying to
establish a conviction that it would be easy to withdraw from it at
will, later on.“He can make millions where other men only see thousands, and they
beyond their reach,” pursued Tenney, in an abstracted voice.“When he’s
your friend, there isn’t anything you can’t do; and he’s as straight
as a string, too, so long as he likes a man.But he’s a terror to have
ag’in you.”

Horace sat closeted with Tenney for a long time, learning the details of
the two plans which had been presented to Mrs.Minster, and which he
was expected to support.The sharpest scrutiny could detect nothing
dishonest in them.Both involved mere questions of expediency--to loan
money in support of one’s stock, and to enter a trust which was to raise
the price of one’s wares--and it was not difficult for Horace to argue
himself into the belief that both promised to be beneficial to his
client.At the close of the interview Horace said plainly to his companion that
he saw no reason why he should not advise Mrs.Minster to adopt both of
the Judge’s recommendations.“They seem perfectly straightforward,” he
added.“Did you expect anything else, knowing me all this while?” asked Tenney,
reproachfully.CHAPTER XXI.--REUBEN’S MOMENTOUS FIRST VISIT.SOME ten days later, Reuben Tracy was vastly surprised one afternoon to
receive a note from Miss Minster.The office-boy said that the messenger
was waiting for an answer, and had been warned to hand the missive to no
one except him.The note ran thus:

Dear Sir: I hope very much that you can find time to call here at our
house during the afternoon.Pray ask for me, and do not mention_ to any
one_ that you are coming._It will not seem to you, I am sure, that I have taken a liberty either
in my request or my injunction, after you have heard the explanation.Sincerely yours,_

Kate Minster.Reuben sent back a written line to say that he would come within
an hour, and then tried to devote himself to the labor of finishing
promptly the task he had in hand.It was a very simple piece of
conveyancing--work he generally performed with facility--but to-day
he found himself spoiling sheet after sheet of “legal cap,” by stupid
omissions and unconscious inversions of the quaint legal phraseology.His thoughts would not be enticed away from the subject of the note--the
perfume of which was apparent upon the musty air of the office, even as
it lay in its envelope before him.There was nothing remarkable in
the fact that Miss Minster wanted to see him--of course, it was with
reference to Jessica’s plan for the factory-girls--but the admonition
to secrecy puzzled him a good deal.The word “explanation,” too, had a
portentous look.Minster had been closeted in the library with her lawyer, Mr.Horace Boyce, for fully two hours that forenoon, and afterward, in the
hearing of her daughters, had invited him to stay for luncheon.He
had pleaded pressure of business as an excuse for not accepting the
invitation, and had taken a hurried departure forthwith.Boyce had never been
asked before to the family table, and there was something pre-occupied,
almost brusque, in his manner of declining the exceptional honor and
hurrying off as he did.They noted, too, that their mother seemed
unwontedly excited about something, and experience told them that her
calm Knickerbocker nature was not to be stirred by trivial matters.So, while they lingered over the jellied dainties of the light noonday
meal, Kate made bold to put the question:

“Something is worrying you, mamma,” she said.“Is it anything that we
know about?”

“Mercy, no!” Mrs.Of course, I’m
not worried.What an idea!”

“I thought you acted as if there was something on your mind,” said Kate.“Well, you would act so, too, if--” There Mrs.“If what, mamma?” put in Ethel.“_We knew_ there was something.”

“He sticks to it that issuing bonds is not mortgaging, and, of course,
he ought to know; but I remember that when they bonded our town for the
Harlem road, father said it _was_ a mortgage,” answered the mother, not
over luminously.What mortgage?” Kate spoke with emphasis.“We have a right
to know, surely!”

“However, you can see for yourself,” pursued Mrs.Minster, “that the
interest must be more than made up by the extra price iron will bring
when the trust puts up prices.That is what trusts are for--to put up
prices.You can read that in the papers every day.”

“Mother, what have you done?”

Kate had pushed back her plate, and leaned over the table now, flashing
sharp inquiry into her mother’s face.“What have you done?” she repeated.“I insist upon knowing, and so does
Ethel.”

Mrs.Minster’s wise and resolute countenance never more thoroughly
belied the condition of her mind than at this moment.She felt that
she did not rightly know just what she had done, and vague fears as to
consequences rose to possess her soul.“If I had spoken to my mother in that way when I was your age, I should
have been sent from the room--big girl though I was.I’m sure I can’t
guess where you take your temper from.The Mauverensens were always----”

This was not satisfactory, and Kate broke into the discourse about her
maternal ancestors peremptorily:

“I don’t care about all that.But some business step has been taken, and
it must concern Ethel and me, and I wish you would tell us plainly what
it is.”

“The Thessaly Company found it necessary to buy the right of a new nail
machine, and they had to have money to do it with, and so some bonds are
to be issued to provide it.It is quite the customary thing, I assure
you, in business affairs.Only, what I maintained was that it _was_
the same as a mortgage, but Judge Wendover and Mr.Boyce insisted it
wasn’t.”

It is, perhaps, an interesting commentary upon the commercial education
of these two wealthy young ladies, that they themselves were unable to
form an opinion upon this debated point.“Bonds are something like stocks,” Ethel explained.But mortgages must be different, for they are kept
in the county clerk’s office.I know that, because Ella Dupont’s father
used to get paid fifty cents apiece for searching after them there.They must have been very careless to lose them so often.”

Mrs.Minster in some way regarded this as a defence of her action, and
took heart.“Well, then, I also signed an agreement which puts us into
the great combination they’re getting up--all the iron manufacturers
of Pennsylvania and Ohio and New York--called the Amalgamated Pig-Iron
Trust.I was very strongly advised to do that; and it stands to reason
that prices will go up, because trusts limit production.Surely, that is
plain enough.”

“You ought to have consulted us,” said Kate, not the less firmly because
her advice, she knew, would have been of no earthly value.“You have a
power-of-attorney to sign for us, but it was really for routine matters,
so that the property might act as a whole.In a great matter like this,
I think we should have known about it first.”

“But you don’t know anything about it now, even when I _have_ told you!”
 Mrs.Minster pointed out, not without justification for her triumphant
tone.“It is perfectly useless for us women to try and understand these
things.Our only safety is in being advised by men who do know, and in
whom we have perfect confidence.”

“But Mr.Boyce is a very young man, and you scarcely know him,” objected
Ethel.“He was strongly recommended to me by Judge Wendover,” replied the
mother.“And pray who recommended Judge Wendover?” asked Kate, with latent
sarcasm.“Why, he was bom in the same town with me!” said Mrs.Minster, as if
no answer could be more sufficient.“My grandfather Douw Mauverensen’s
sister married a Wendover.”

“But about the bonds,” pursued the eldest daughter.“What amount of
money do they represent?”

“Four hundred thousand dollars.”

The girls opened their eyes at this, and their mother hastened to add:
“But it really isn’t very important, when you come to look at it.It is
only what Judge Wendover calls making one hand wash the other.The money
raised on the bonds will put the Thessaly Company on its feet, and so
then that will pay dividends, and so we will get back the interest,
and more too.The bonds we can buy back whenever we choose._I_ managed
that, because when Judge Wendover said the bonds would be perfectly
good, I said, ‘If they are so good, why don’t you take them yourself?’
And he seemed struck with that and said he would.They didn’t get much
the best of me there!”

Somehow this did not seem very clear to Kate.“If he had the money to
take the bonds, what was the need of any bonds at all?” she asked.“Why
didn’t he buy this machinery himself?”

“It wouldn’t have been regular; there was some legal obstacle in the
way,” the mother replied.“He explained it to me, but I didn’t quite
catch it.At all events, there _had_ to be bonds.Even _he_ couldn’t see
any way ont of _that_.”

“Well, I hope it is all right,” said Kate, and the conversation lapsed.But upon reflection, in her own room, the matter seemed less and less
all right, and finally, after a long and not very helpful consultation
with her sister, Kate suddenly thought of Reuben Tracy.A second later
she had fully decided to ask his advice, and swift upon this rose the
resolve to summon him immediately.Thus it was that the perfumed note came to be sent.*****

Reuben took the seat in the drawing-room of the Minsters indicated by
the servant who had admitted him, and it did not occur to this member of
the firm of Tracy & Boyce to walk about and look at the pictures, much
less to wonder how many of them were of young men.Even in this dull light he could recognize, on the opposite wall, a
boyhood portrait of the Stephen Minster, Junior, whose early death had
dashed so many hopes, and pointed so many morals to the profit of godly
villagers.He thought about this worthless, brief career, as his eyes
rested on the bright, boyish face of the portrait, with the clear dark
eyes and the fresh-tinted cheeks, and his serious mind filled itself
with protests against the conditions which had made of this heir to
millions a rake and a fool.There was no visible reason why Stephen
Minster’s son should not have been clever and strong, a fit master of
the great part created for him by his father.There must be some blight,
some mysterious curse upon hereditary riches here in America, thought
Reuben, for all at once he found himself persuaded that this was the
rule with most rich men’s sons.Therein lay a terrible menace to the
Republic, he said to himself.Vague musings upon the possibility of
remedying this were beginning to float in his brain--the man could never
contemplate injustices, great or small, without longing to set them
right--when the door opened and the tall young elder daughter of the
Minsters entered.Reuben rose and felt himself making some such obeisance before her in
spirit as one lays at the feet of a queen.What he did in reality or
what he said, left no record on his memory.He had been seated again for some minutes, and had listened with the
professional side of his mind to most of what story she had to tell,
before he regained control of his perceptions and began to realize
that the most beautiful woman he had ever seen was confiding to him her
anxieties, as a friend even more than as a lawyer.The situation was so
wonderful that it needed all the control he had over his faculties to
grasp and hold it.Always afterward he thought of the moment in which
his confusion of mind vanished, and he, sitting on the sofa facing her
chair, was able to lean back a little and talk as if he had known her a
long time, as the turning-point in his whole life.What it was in her power to tell him about the transaction which had
frightened her did not convey a very clear idea to his mind.A mortgage
of four hundred thousand dollars had been placed upon the Minsters’
property to meet the alleged necessities of a company in which they were
large owners, and their own furnaces had been put under the control of
a big trust formed by other manufacturers, presumably for the benefit of
all its members.This was what he made out of her story.“On their face,” he said, “these things seem regular enough.The
doubtful point, of course, would be whether, in both transactions, your
interests and those of your family were perfectly safe-guarded.This is
something I can form no opinion about.Boyce must have looked
out for that and seen that you got ‘value received.’”

“Ah, Mr.That is just the question,” Kate answered, swiftly.“_Has_ he looked out for it?”

“Curiously enough he has never spoken with me, even indirectly, about
having taken charge of your mother’s business,” replied Reuben, slowly.“But he is a competent man, with a considerable talent for detail, and a
good knowledge of business, as well as of legal forms.I should say you
might be perfectly easy about his capacity to guard your interests; oh,
yes, entirely easy.”

“It isn’t his capacity that I was thinking about,” said the young woman,
hesitatingly.“I wanted to ask you about him himself--about the _man_.”

Reuben smiled in an involuntary effort to conceal his uneasiness.“They
say that no man is a hero to his valet, you know,” he made answer.“In
the same way business men ought not to be cross-examined on the opinions
which the community at large may have concerning their partners.Boyce
and I occupy, in a remote kind of way, the relations of husband and
wife.We maintain a public attitude toward each other of great respect
and admiration, and are bound to do so by the same rules which govern
the heads of a family.And we mustn’t talk about each other.You never
would go to one of a married couple for an opinion about the other.If
the opinion were all praise, you would set it down to prejudice; if it
were censure, the fact of its source would shock you.Oh, no, partners
mustn’t discuss each other.That would be letting all the bars down with
a vengeance.”

He had said all this with an effort at lightness, and ended, as he had
begun, with a smile.Kate, looking intently into his face, did not smile
in response.“Perhaps I was wrong to ask you,” she answered, after a little pause,
and in a colder tone.“You men do stand by each other so splendidly.It is why your sex possesses the earth,
and the fulness thereof.”

It was easier for Reuben to smile naturally this time.“But I
illustrated my position by an example of a still finer reticence,” he
said; “the finest one can imagine--that of husband and wife.”

“You are not married, I believe, Mr.Tracy,” was her comment, and its
edge was apparent.“No,” he said, and stopped short.No other words came to his tongue, and
his thoughts seemed to have gone away into somebody else’s mind, leaving
only a formless blank, over which hung, like a canopy of cloud, a
depressing uneasiness lest his visit should not, after all, turn out a
success.“Then you think I have needlessly worried myself,” she was saying when
he came back into mental life again.“Not altogether that, either,” he replied, moving in his seat, and
sitting upright like a man who has shaken himself out of a disposition
to doze.“So far as you have described them, the transactions may easily
be all right.The sum seems a large one to raise for the purchase of machinery, and
it might be well to inquire into the exact nature and validity of the
purchase.As for the terms upon which you lend the money to the company,
of course Mr.In the matter of the trust, I
cannot speak at all.All such
combinations excite my anger.But as a business operation it may
improve your property; always assuming that you are capably and fairly
represented in the control of the trust.Boyce has
attended to that.”

“But don’t you see,” broke in the girl, “it is all Mr.It is
to be assumed that he will do this, to be taken for granted he will
do that, to be hoped that he has done the other._That_ is what I am
anxious about._Will_ he do them?”

“And that, of course, is what I cannot tell you,” said Reuben.“How can
I know?”

“But you can find out.”

The lawyer knitted his ordinarily placid brows for a moment in thought.“I am afraid not,” he said, slowly.“I
should be very angry if the railroad people, for example, set him to
examining what I had done for them; angry with him, especially, for
accepting such a commission.”

“I am sorry, Mr.Tracy, if I seem to have proposed anything dishonorable
to you,” Miss Kate responded, with added formality in voice and manner.“I did not mean to.”

“How could I imagine such a thing?” said Reuben, more readily than was
his wont.“I only sought to make a peculiar situation clear to you, who
are not familiar with such things.If I asked him questions, or meddled
in the matter at all, he would resent it; and by usage he would be
justified in resenting it.That is how it stands.”

“Then you cannot help me, after all!” She spoke despondingly now, with
the low, rich vibration in her tone which Reuben had dwelt so often on
in memory since he first heard it.“And I had counted so much upon your
aid,” she added, with a sigh.“I would do a great deal to be of use to you,” the young man said,
earnestly, and looked her in the face with calm frankness; “a great
deal, Miss Minster, but--”

“Yes, but that ‘but’ means everything.I repeat, in this situation you
can do nothing.”

“I cannot take a brief against my partner.”

“I should not suggest that again, Mr.“I can see
that I was wrong there, and you were right.”

“Don’t put it in that way.I merely pointed out a condition of business relations which had not
occurred to you.”

“And there is no other way?”

Another way had dawned on Reuben’s mind, but it was so bold and
precipitous that he hesitated to consider it seriously at first.When
it did take form and force itself upon him, he said, half quaking at his
own audacity:

“No other way--while--he remains my partner.” Bright women discover many
obscure things by the use of that marvellous faculty we call intuition,
but they have by no means reduced its employment to an exact science.Sometimes their failure to discover more obvious things is equally
remarkable.At this moment, for example, Kate’s feminine wits did not
in the least help her to read the mind of the man before her, or the
meaning in his words.In truth, they misled her, for she heard only
an obstinate reiteration of an unpleasant statement, and set her teeth
together with impatience as she heard it.And had she even kept these teeth tight clinched, and said nothing, the
man might have gone on in self-explanation, and made clear to her her
mistake.But her vexation was too imperative for silence.“I am very sorry to have taken up your time, Mr.Tracy,” she said,
stiffly, and rose from her chair.“I am so little informed about these
matters, I really imagined you could help us.Pray forgive me.”

If Reuben could have realized, as he stood in momentary embarrassment,
that this beautiful lady before him had fairly bitten her tongue to
restrain it from adding that he might treat this as a professional call,
or in some other way suggesting that he would be paid for his time, he
might have been more embarrassed still, and angry as well.But it did not occur to him to feel annoyance--at least, toward her.He
really was sorry that no way of being of help to her seemed immediately
available, and he thought of this more in fact than he did of the
personal aspects of his failure to justify her invitation.He noted that
the faint perfume which her dress exhaled as she rose was identical with
that of the letter of invitation, and thought to himself that he would
preserve that letter, and then that it would not be quite warranted by
the circumstances, and so found himself standing silent before
her, sorely reluctant to go away, and conscious that there must be a
sympathetic light in his eyes which hers did not reflect.“I am truly grieved if you are disappointed,” he managed to say at last.“Oh, it is nothing, Mr.Tracy,” she said, politely, and moved toward
the door.“It was my ignorance of business rules.I am so sorry to have
troubled you.”

Reuben followed her through the hall to the outer door, wondering if she
would offer to shake hands with him, and putting both his stick and hat
in his left hand to free the other in case she did.On the doorstep she did give him her hand, and in that moment, ruled by
a flash of impulse, he heard himself saying to her:

“If anything happens, if you learn anything, if you need me, you _won’t_
fail to call me, will you?”

Then the door closed, and as Reuben walked away he did not seem able to
recall whether she had answered his appeal or not.In sober fact, it
had scarcely sounded like his appeal at all.The voice was certainly one
which had never been heard in the law-office down on Main Street or in
the trial-chamber of the Dearborn County Court-House over the way.It
had sounded more like the voice of an actor in the theatre--like a Romeo
murmuring up to the sweet girl in the balcony.Reuben walked straight to his office, and straight through to the little
inner apartment appropriated to his private uses.There were some people
in the large room talking with his partner, but he scarcely observed
their presence as he passed.He unlocked a tiny drawer in the top of
his desk, cleared out its contents brusquely, dusted the inside with his
hand kerchief, and then placed within it a perfumed note which he took
from his pocket.When he had turned the key upon this souvenir, he drew a long breath,
lighted a cigar, and sat down, with his feet on the table and his
thoughts among the stars.CHAPTER XXII.--“SAY THAT THERE IS NO ANSWER.”

 Reuben allowed his mind to drift at will in this novel, enchanted
channel for a long time, until the clients outside had taken their
departure, and his cigar had burned out, and his partner had sauntered
in to mark by some casual talk the fact that the day was done.What this mind shaped into dreams and desires and pictures in its
musings, it would not be an easy matter to detail.The sum of the
revery--or, rather, the central goal up to which every differing train
of thought somehow managed to lead him--was that Kate Minster was the
most beautiful, the cleverest, the dearest, the loveliest, the most to
be adored and longed for, of all mortal women.If he did not say to himself, in so many words, “I love her,” it was
because the phraseology was unfamiliar to him.That eternal triplet
of tender verb and soulful pronouns, which sings itself in our more
accustomed hearts to music set by the stress of our present senses--now
the gay carol of springtime, sure and confident; now the soft twilight
song, wherein the very weariness of bliss sighs forth a blessing;
now the vibrant, wooing ballad of a graver passion, with tears close
underlying rapture; now, alas!the dirge of hopeless loss, with wailing
chords which overwhelm like curses, smitten upon heartstrings strained
to the breaking--these three little words did not occur to him.But no
lover self-confessed could have dreamed more deliciously.He had spoken with her twice now--once when she was wrapped in furs and
wore a bonnet, and once in her own house, where she was dressed in
a creamy white gown, with a cord and tassels about the waist.These
details were tangible possessions in the treasure-house of his memory.The first time she had charmed and gratified his vague notions of what a
beautiful and generous woman should be; he had been unspeakably pleased
by the enthusiasm with which she threw herself into the plan for helping
the poor work-girls of the town.On this second occasion she had been
concerned only about the safety of her own money, and that of her
family, and yet his liking for her had flared up into something very
like a consuming flame.If there was a paradox here, the lawyer did not
see it.There floated across his mind now and again stray black motes of
recollection that she had not seemed altogether pleased with him on this
later occasion, but they passed away without staining the bright colors
of his meditation.It did not matter what she had thought or said.The
fact of his having been there with her, the existence of that little
perfumed letter tenderly locked up in the desk before him, the
breathing, smiling, dark-eyed picture of her which glowed in his
brain--these were enough.Once before--once only in his life--the personality of a woman had
seized command of his thoughts.Years ago, when he was still the
schoolteacher at the Burfield, he had felt himself in love with Annie
Fairchild, surely the sweetest flower that all the farm-lands of
Dearborn had ever produced.He had come very near revealing his
heart--doubtless the girl did know well enough of his devotion--but she
was in love with her cousin Seth, and Reuben had come to realize this,
and so had never spoken, but had gone away to New York instead.He could remember that for a time he was unhappy, and even so late as
last autumn, after nearly four years had gone by, the mere thought
that she commended her protégée, Jessica Lawton, to his kindness, had
thrilled him with something of the old feeling.But now she seemed all
at once to have faded away into indistinct remoteness, like the figure
of some little girl he had known in his boyhood and had never seen
since.Curiously enough, the apparition of Jessica Law-ton rose and took form
in his thoughts, as that of Annie Fairchild passed into the shadows of
long ago.She, at least, was not a schoolgirl any more, but a full-grown
woman.He could remember that the glance in her eyes when she looked at
him was maturely grave and searching.She had seemed very grateful
to him for calling upon her, and he liked to recall the delightful
expression of surprised satisfaction which lighted up her face when she
found that both Miss Minster and he would help her.They two were to work together to further and
fulfil this plan of Jessica’s!Now he came to think of it, the young lady had never said a word to-day
about Jessica and the plan--and, oddly enough, too, he had never once
remembered it either.But then Miss Minster had other matters on her
mind.She was frightened about the mortgages and the trust, and anxious
to have his help to set her fears at rest.Reuben began to wonder once more what there was really in those fears.As he pondered on this, all the latent distrust of his partner which
had been growing up for weeks in his mind suddenly swelled into a great
dislike.There came to him, all at once, the recollection of those
mysterious and sinister words he had overheard exchanged between his
partner and Tenney, and it dawned upon his slow-working consciousness
that that strange talk about a “game in his own hands” had never been
explained by events.Then, in an instant, he realized instinctively that
here _was_ the game.It was at this juncture that Horace strolled into the presence of his
partner.He had his hands in his trousers pockets, and a cigar between
his teeth.“Ferguson has been here again,” he said, nonchalantly, “and brought his
brother with him.He can’t make up his mind whether to appeal the case
or not.He’d like to try it, but the expense scares him.I told him at
last that I was tired of hearing about the thing, and didn’t give a damn
what he did, as long as he only shut up and gave me a rest.”

Reuben did not feel interested in the Fergusons.He looked his partner
keenly, almost sternly, in the eye, and said:

“You have never mentioned to me that Mrs.Minster had put her business
in your hands.”

Horace flushed a little, and returned the other’s gaze with one equally
truculent.“It didn’t seem to be necessary,” he replied, curtly.“It is private
business.”

“Nothing was said about your having private business when the firm was
established,” commented Reuben.“That may be,” retorted Horace.“But you have your railroad affairs--a
purely personal matter.Why shouldn’t I have an equal right?”

“I don’t say you haven’t.What I am thinking of is your secrecy in
the matter.I hate to have people act in that way, as if I couldn’t be
trusted.”

Horace had never heard Reuben speak in this tone before.The whole
Minster business had perplexed and harassed him into a state of nervous
irritability these last few weeks, and it was easy for him now to snap
at provocation.“At least _I_ may be trusted to mind my own affairs,” he said, with
cutting niceness of enunciation and a lowering scowl of the brows.There came a little pause, for Reuben saw himself face to face with
a quarrel, and shrank from precipitating it needlessly.Perhaps the
rupture would be necessary, but he would do nothing to hasten it out of
mere ill-temper.“That isn’t the point,” he said at last, looking up with more calmness
into the other’s face.“I simply commented on your having taken such
pains to keep the whole thing from me.Why on earth should you have
thought that essential?”

Horace answered with a question.“Who told you about it?” he asked, in a
surly tone.“Old ’Squire Gedney mentioned it first.Others have spoken of it
since.”

“Well, what am I to understand?Do you intend to object to my keeping
the business?I may tell you that it was by the special request of my
clients that I undertook it alone, and, as they laid so much stress on
that, it seemed to me best not to speak of it at all to you.”

“Why?”

“To be frank,” said Horace, with a cold gleam in his eye, “I didn’t
imagine that it would be particularly pleasant to you to learn that the
Minster ladies desired not to have you associated with their affairs.It
seemed one of those things best left unsaid.However, you have it now.”

Reuben felt the disagreeable intention of his partner’s words even
more than he did their bearing upon the dreams from which he had been
awakened.He had by this time perfectly made up his mind about Horace,
and realized that a break-up was inevitable.The conviction that this
young man was dishonest carried with it, however, the suggestion that it
would be wise to probe him and try to learn what he was at.“I wish you would sit down a minute or two,” he said.“I want to talk to
you.”

Horace took a chair, and turned the cigar restlessly around in his
teeth.He was conscious that his nerves were not quite what they should
be.“It seems to me,” pursued Reuben--“I’m speaking as an older lawyer
than you, and an older man--it seems to me that to put a four hundred
thousand dollar mortgage on the Minster property is a pretty big
undertaking for a young man to go into on his own hook, without
consulting anybody.Don’t think I wish to
meddle.Only it seems to me, if I had been in your place, I should have
moved very cautiously and taken advice.“I did take advice,” said Horace.The discovery that Reuben knew of this
mortgage filled him with uneasiness.Schuyler Tenney?” asked Reuben, speaking calmly enough, but
watching with all his eyes.Horace visibly flushed, and
then turned pale.“I decline to be catechised in this way,” he said, nervously shifting
his position on the chair, and then suddenly rising.“Gedney is a
damned, meddlesome, drunken old fool,” he added, with irrelevant
vehemence.“Yes, I’m afraid ‘Cal’ does drink too much,” answered Reuben, with
perfect amiability of tone.He evinced no desire to continue the
conversation, and Horace, after standing for an uncertain moment or
two in the doorway, went out and put on his overcoat.“Am I to take it that you object to my continuing to act as attorney for
these ladies?” he asked from the threshold of the outer room, his voice
shaking a little in spite of itself.“I don’t think I have said that,” replied Reuben.“No, you haven’t _said_ it,” commented the other.“To tell the truth, I haven’t quite cleared up in my own mind just what
I do object to, or how much,” said Reuben, relighting his cigar, and
contemplating his boots crossed on the desk-top.“We’ll talk of this
again.”

“As you like,” muttered young Mr.Then he turned, and went away
without saying good-night.Twilight began to close in upon the winter’s day, but Reuben still sat
in meditation.He had parted with his colleague in anger, and it was
evident enough that the office family was to be broken up; but he
gave scarcely a thought to these things.His mind, in fact, seemed by
preference to dwell chiefly upon the large twisted silken cord which
girdled the waist of that wonderful young woman, and the tasselled ends
of which hung against the white front of her gown like the beads of a
nun.Many variant thoughts about her affairs, about her future, rose in
his mind and pleasantly excited it, but they all in turn merged vaguely
into fancies circling around that glossy rope and weaving themselves
into its strands.It was very near tea-time, and darkness had established itself for the
night in the offices, before Reuben’s vagrant musings prompted him to
action.Upon the spur of the moment, he all at once put down his feet,
lighted the gas over his desk, took out the perfumed letter from its
consecrated resting-place, and began hurriedly to write a reply to it.He had suddenly realized that the memorable interview that afternoon had
been, from her point of view, inconclusive.Five times he worked his way down nearly to the bottom of the page,
and then tore up the sheet.At first he was too expansive; then
the contrasted fault of over-reticence jarred upon him.At last he
constructed this letter, which obtained a reluctant approval from his
critical sense, though it seemed to his heart a pitifully gagged and
blindfolded missive:

Dear Miss Minster: Unfortunately, I was unable this afternoon to see my
way to helping you upon the lines which you suggested.Matters have assumed a somewhat different aspect since our talk.By the
time that you have mastered the details of what you had on your mind, I
may be in a position to consult with you freely upon the whole subject.I want you to believe that I am very anxious to be of assistance to you,
in this as in all other things.Faithfully yours,

Reuben TRacy.Reuben locked up the keepsake note again, fondly entertaining the idea
as he did so that soon there might be others to bear it company.Then he
closed the offices, went down upon the street, and told the first idle
boy he met that he could earn fifty cents by carrying a letter at once
to the home of the Minsters.The money would be his when he returned to
the Dearborn House.“Will there be any answer?” asked the boy.This opened up a new idea to the lawyer.“You might wait and see,” he
said.But the messenger came back in a depressingly short space of time, with
the word that no answer was required.He had hurried both ways with a stem concentration of purpose, and now
he dashed off once more in an even more strenuous face against time
with the half-dollar clutched securely inside his mitten.The Great
Occidental Minstrel Combination was in town, and the boy leaped over
snowbanks, and slid furiously across slippery places, in the earnestness
of his intention not to miss one single joke.The big man whom he left went wearily up the stairs to his room, and
walked therein for aimless hours, and almost scowled as he shook his
head at the waitress who came up to remind him that he had had no
supper.*****

The two Minster sisters had read Reuben’s note together, in the
seclusion of their own sitting-room.They had previously discussed
the fact of his refusal to assist them--for so it translated itself
in Kate’s account of the interview--and had viewed it with almost
displeasure.Ethel was, however, disposed to relent when the letter came.“At least it might be well to write him a polite note,” she said,
“thanking him, and saying that circumstances might arise under which you
would be glad to--to avail yourself, and so on.”

“I don’t think I shall write at all,” Kate replied, glancing over the
lawyer’s missive again.“He took no interest in the thing whatever.And you see how even now he infers that ‘the lines I suggested’ were
dishonorable.”

“I didn’t see that, Kate.”

“Here it is.‘He was unable to see his way,’ and that sort of thing.And
he _said_ himself that the business all seemed regular enough, so far
as he could see.--Say that there is no answer,” she added to the maid at
the door.The two girls sat in silence for a moment in the soft, cosey light
between the fire-place and the lace-shaded lamp.Then Ethel spoke again:

“And you really didn’t like him, Kate?You know you were so enthusiastic
about him, that day you came back from the milliner’s shop.I never
heard you have so much to say about any other man before.”

“That was different,” mused the other.Her voice grew even less kindly,
and the words came swifter as she went on.“_Then_ it was a question of
helping the Lawton girl.He didn’t
hum and haw, and talk about ‘the lines suggested’ to him, then.He could
‘see his way’ very clearly indeed.And
I was childish enough to be taken in by it all.I am vexed with myself
when I think of it.”

“Are you sure you are being quite fair, Kate?” pale Ethel asked, putting
her hand caressingly on the sister’s knee.He _says_ he wants to help you; and he hints, too, that something has
happened, or is going to happen, to make him free in the matter.How can
we tell what that something is, or how he felt himself bound before?It seems to me that we oughtn’t to leap at the idea of his being
unfriendly.I am sure that you believed him to be a wholly good man
before.Why assume all at once now that he is not, just because--Men
don’t change from good to bad like that.”

“Ah, but _was_ he good before, or did we only think so?”

Ethel went on: “Surely, he knows more about business than we do.And if
he was unable to help you, it must have been for some real reason.”

“That is _it!_ I should like to be helped first, and let reasons come
afterward.” The girl’s dark eyes flashed with an imperious light.“What
kind of a hero is it who, when you cry for assistance, calmly says:
‘Upon the lines you suggest I do not see my way’?It is high time the
books about chivalry were burned, if ‘that’ is the modern man.”

“But you did not cry to a hero for assistance.You merely asked the
advice of a lawyer about a mortgage---if mamma is right about its being
a mortgage.”

“It is the same thing,” said Kate, pushing the hassock impatiently with
her foot.. “Whether the distressed maiden falls into the water or into
debt, the principle is precisely the same.”

“He couldn’t do what you asked, because it would be unfair to his
partner.Now, isn’t that it exactly?Now,
_be_ frank, Kate.”

“The partner would have gone into anything headlong, asking no
questions, raising no objections, if I had so much ais lifted my finger.He never would have given, partner a thought.”

Kate, confided this answer to the firelight.She was conscious of a
desire just now not to meet her sister’s glance.“And you like the man without scruples better than the man with them?”

“At least, he is more interesting,” the elder girl said, still with her
eyes on the burning logs.Ethel waited a little for some additional hint as to her sister’s state
of mind.When the silence had begun to make itself felt, she said:

“Kate Minster, you don’t mean one word of what you are saying.”

“Ah, but I do.”

“No; listen to me.Tracy very much
for his action to-day.”

“For being so much less eager to help me than he was to help the
milliner?”

“No; for not being willing to help even you by doing an unfair thing.”

“Well--if you like--respect, yes.But so one respects John Knox, and
Increase Mather, and St.Simon What’s-his-name on top of the pillar--all
the disagreeable people, in fact.But it isn’t respect that makes the
world go round.There is such a thing as caring too much for respect,
and too little for warmth of feeling, and generous impulses, and--and so
on.”

“You’re a queer girl, Kate,” was all Ethel could think to say.This time the silence maintained itself so long that the snapping
of sparks on the hearth, and even the rushing suction of air in the
lamp-flame, grew to be obvious noises.At last Ethel slid softly from
the couch to the carpet, and nestled her head against her sister’s
waist.Kate put her arm tenderly over the girl’s shoulder, and drew
her closer to her, and the silence had become vocal with affectionate
mur-murings to them both.It was the younger sister who finally spoke:

“You _won’t_ do anything rash, Kate?Nothing without talking it over
with me?” she pleaded, almost sadly.Kate bent over and kissed her twice, thrice, on the forehead, and
stroked the silken hair upon this forehead caressingly.Her own eyes
glistened with the beginnings of tears before she made answer, rising as
she spoke, and striving to import into her voice the accent of gayety:

“As if I ever dreamed of doing anything at all without asking you!And
please, puss, may I go to bed now?”




CHAPTER XXIII.--HORACE’S PATH BECOMES TORTUOUS.“Tracy has found out that I’m doing the Minster business, and he’s cut
up rough about it.I shouldn’t be surprised if the firm came a cropper
over the thing.”

Horace Boyce confided this information to Mr.Schuyler Tenney on the
forenoon following his scene with Reuben, and though the language in
which it was couched was in part unfamiliar, the hardware merchant had
no difficulty in grasping its meaning.He stopped his task of going
through the morning’s batch of business letters, and looked up keenly at
the young man.“Found out--how do you mean?I told you to tell him--told you the day
you came here to talk about the General’s affairs.”

“Well, I didn’t tell him.”

“And why?” Tenney demanded, sharply.“I should like to know why?”

“Because it didn’t suit me to do so,” replied the young man; “just as it
doesn’t suit me now to be bullied about it.”

Mr.Tenney looked for just a fleeting instant as if he were going to
respond in kind.Then he thought better of it, and began toying with one
of the envelopes before him.“You must have got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning,” he
said, smilingly.“Why, man alive, nobody dreamed of bullying you.Only,
of course, it would have been better if you’d told Tracy.And you say he
is mad about it?”

“Yes, he was deucedly offensive.I daresay it will come to an open row.I haven’t seen him yet to-day, but things looked very dickey indeed for
the partnership last night.”

“Then the firm hasn’t got any specified term to run?”

“No, it is terminable at pleasure of both parties, which of course means
either party.”

“Well, there, you can tell him to go to the old Harry, if you like.”

“Precisely what I mean to do--if--”

“If what?”

“If there is going to be enough in this Minster business to keep me
going in the mean while.I don’t think I could take much of his regular
office business away.I haven’t been there long enough, you know.”

“Enough?I Should think there _would_ be enough!You will have five
thousand dollars as her representative in the Thessaly Manufacturing
Company.I daresay you might charge something for acting as her agent in
the pig-iron trust, too, though I’d draw it pretty mild if I were you.Women get scared at bills for that sort of thing.A young fellow like
you ought to save money on half of five thousand dollars.It never cost
me fifteen hundred dollars yet to live, and live well, too.”

Horace smiled in turn, and the smile was felt by both to suffice,
without words.There was no need to express in terms the fact that
in matters of necessary expense a Boyce and a Tenney, were two widely
differentiated persons.Horace had more satisfaction out
of the thought than did his companion.“Oh, by the way,” he added, “I ought to tell you, Tracy knows in
some way that you are mixed up with me in the thing.He mentioned your
name--in that slow, ox-like way of his so that I couldn’t tell how much
he knew or suspected.”

Mr.Tenney was interested in this; and showed his concern by separating
the letters on his desk into little piles, as if he were preparing to
perform a card tricks:

“I guess it won’t matter, much,” he said at last.“Everybody’s going
to know it pretty soon, now.” He thought again for a little, and then
added: “Only, on second thought, you’d better stick in with him a while
longer, if you can.Make some sort of apology to him, if he needs one,
and keep in the firm.It will be better so.”

“Why should I, pray?” demanded the young man, curtly.Tenney again looked momentarily as if he were tempted to reply with
acerbity, and again the look vanished as swiftly as it came.He answered
in all mildness:

“Because I don’t want Tracy to be sniffing around, inquiring into
things, until we are fairly in the saddle.He might spoil everything.”

“But how will my remaining with him prevent that?”

“You don’t know your man,” replied Tenney.“He’s one of those fellows
who would feel in honor bound to keep his hands off, simply because you
_were_ with him.That’s the beauty of that kind of chap.”

This tribute to the moral value of his partner impressed Horace but
faintly.“Well, I’ll see how he talks to-day,” he said, doubtfully.“Perhaps we can manage to hit it off together a while longer.” Then a
thought crossed his mind, and he asked with abruptness:

“What are you afraid of his finding out, if he does ‘sniff around’ as
you call it?Everything is above board, isn’t
it?”

“Why, you know it is.Who should know it better than you?” Mr.Horace reasoned to himself as he walked away that there really was no
cause for apprehension.Tenney was smart, and evidently Wendover was
smart too, but if they tried to pull the wool over his eyes they would
find that he himself had not been born yesterday.He had done everything
they had suggested to him, but he felt that the independent and even
captious manner in which he had done it all must have shown the schemers
that he was not a man to be trifled with.Thus far he could see no
dishonesty in their plans.He had been very nervous about the first
steps, but his mind was almost easy now.He was in a position where he
could protect the Minsters if any harm threatened them.And very
soon now, he said confidently to himself, he would be in an even more
enviable position--that of a member of the family council, a prospective
son-in-law.It was clear to his perceptions that Kate liked him, and
that he had no rivals.It happened that Reuben did not refer again to the subject of
yesterday’s dispute, and while Horace acquiesced in the silence, he was
conscious of some disappointment over it.It annoyed him to even look at
his partner this morning, and he was sick and tired of the partnership.It required an effort to be passing civil with Reuben, and he said to
himself a hundred times during the day that he should be heartily glad
when the Thessaly Manufacturing Company got its new machinery in, and
began real operations, so that he could take up his position there
as the visible agent of the millions, and pitch his partner and the
pettifogging law business overboard altogether.In the course of the afternoon he went to the residence of the Minsters.The day was not Tuesday, but Horace regarded himself as emancipated from
formal conditions, and at the door asked for the ladies, and then made
his own way into the drawing-room, with entire self-possession.Minster came down, he had some trivial matter of business
ready as a pretext for his visit, but her manner was so gracious that
he felt pleasantly conscious of the futility of pretexts.He was on such
a footing in the Minster household that he would never need excuses any
more.The lady herself mentioned the plan of his attending the forthcoming
meeting of the directors of the pig-iron trust at Pittsburg, and told
him that she had instructed her bankers to deposit with his bankers a
lump sum for expenses chargeable against the estate, which he could
use at discretion.“You mustn’t be asked to use your own money on our
business,” she said, smilingly.It is only natural to warm toward people who have such nice things as
this to say, and Horace found himself assuming a very confidential,
almost filial, attitude toward Mrs.Her kindness to him was so
marked that he felt really moved by it, and in a gracefully indirect
way said so.He managed this by alluding to his own mother, who had died
when he was a little boy, and then dwelling, with a tender inflection
in his voice, upon the painful loneliness which young men feel who are
brought up in motherless homes.“It seems as if I had never known a home
at all,” he said, and sighed.“She was one of the Beekmans from Tyre, wasn’t she?I’ve heard Tabitha
speak of her often,” said Mrs.The words were not important,
but the look which accompanied them was distinctly sympathetic.Perhaps it was this glance that affected Horace.He made a little
gulping sound in his throat, clinched his hands together, and looked
fixedly down upon the pattern of the carpet.“We should both have been better men if she had lived’,” he murmured,
in a low voice.As no answer came, he was forced to look up after a time, and then
upon the instant he realized that his pathos had been wasted, for Mrs.Minster’s face did not betray the emotion he had anticipated.She seemed
to have been thinking of something else.“Have you seen any Bermuda potatoes in the market yet?” she asked.“It’s
about time for them, isn’t it?”

“I’ll ask my father,” Horace replied, determined not to be thrown off
the trail.“He has been in the West Indies a good deal, and he knows all
about their vegetables, and the seasons, and so on.It is about him that
I wish to speak, Mrs.Minster.”

The lady nodded her head, and drew down the comers of her mouth a
little.“I feel the homeless condition of the General very much,” Horace went
on.“The death of my mother was a terrible blow to him, one he has never
recovered from.”

Mrs.Minster had heard differently, but she nodded her head again in
sympathy with this new view.Horace had not been mistaken in believing
that filial affection was good in her eyes.“So he has lived all these years almost alone in the big house,” the son
proceeded, “and the solitary life has affected his spirits, weakened
his ambition, relaxed his regard for the part he ought to play in the
community.Since I have been back, he has brightened up a good deal.He
has been a most loving father to me always, and I would do anything in
the world to contribute to his happiness.It is borne in upon me more
and more that if I had a cheerful home to which he could turn for warmth
and sunshine, if I had a wife whom he could reverence and be fond of, if
there were grandchildren to greet him when he came and to play upon his
knee--he would feel once more as if there was something in life worth
living for.”

Horace awaited with deep anxiety the answer to this.The General was the
worst card in his hand, one which he was glad to be rid of at any risk.If it should turn out that it had actually taken a trick in the game,
then he would indeed be lucky.“If it is no offence, how old are you, Mr.“I shall be twenty-eight in April.”

Mrs.“I never have believed in
early marriages,” she said.“They make more than half the trouble there
is.The Mauverensens were never great hands for marrying early.My
grandfather, Major Douw, was almost thirty, and my father was past
that age.And, of course, people married then much earlier than they do
nowadays.”

“I hope you do not think twenty-eight too young,” Horace pleaded, with
alert eyes resting on her face.He paused only for an instant, and then,
just as the tremor arising in his heart had reached his tongue, added
earnestly, “For it is a Mauverensen I wish to marry.”

Mrs.Minster looked at him with no light of comprehension in her glance.“It can’t be our people,” she said, composedly, “for Anthony has no
daughters.It must be some of the Schenectady lot.We’re not related at
all.They try to make out that they are, but they’re not.”

“You are very closely and tenderly related to the young lady I have
learned to adore,” the young man said, leaning forward on his low chair
until one knee almost touched the carpet.“I called her a Mauverensen
because she is worthy of that historic blood, but it was her mother’s,
not her father’s name.Minster, I love your daughter Kate!”

“Goodness me!” was the astonished lady’s comment.She stared at the young man in suppliant attitude before her, in
very considerable confusion of thought, and for what seemed to him an
intolerable time.“I am afraid it wouldn’t do at all,” she said first, doubtingly.Then
she added, as if thinking aloud: “I might have known Kate was keeping
something from me.She hasn’t been herself at all these last few weeks.”

“But she has not been keeping _this_ from you, Mrs.Minster,” urged the
young man, in his softest voice.“It is my own secret--all my own--kept
locked in the inner tabernacle of my heart until this very moment, when
I revealed it to you.”

“You mean that Kate--my daughter--does not know of this?”

“She must know that I worship the ground she treads on--she would be
blind not to realize that--but I have never said a word to her about it.No, not a word!”

Mrs.Minster uttered the little monosyllable “oh!” with a hesitating,
long-drawn-out sound.It was evident that this revelation altered
matters in her mind, and Horace hurried on:

“No,” he said; “the relation between mother and child has always seemed
to pie the most sacred thing on earth--perhaps because my own mother
died so many, many years ago.I would rather stifle my own feelings than
let an act of mine desecrate or imperil that relation.It may be that
I am old-fashioned, Mrs.Minster,” the young man continued, with a
deprecatory smile, “but I like the old habit of the good families--that
of deferring to the parents.I say that to them the chief courtesy and
deference are due.I know it is out of date, but I have always felt that
way.I say to you with profound respect that
you have reared the loveliest and best of all the daughters of the sons
of men, and that if you will only entertain the idea of permitting me to
strive to win her love, I shall be the proudest and happiest mortal on
earth.”

Whatever might betide with the daughter, the conquest of the mother was
easy and complete.“I like your sentiments very much indeed,” she said, with evident
sincerity.Of course I
haven’t the least idea what Kate will say.”

“Oh, leave that to me!” said Horace, with ardent confidence.Then, after
this rapturous outburst, he went on more quietly: “I would beg of you
not to mention the subject to her.Your favor has allowed me to come and go here on pleasant terms of
friendship.I will not ask your daughter
to commit herself until she has had time and chance to know me through
and through.To pick a husband
is the one grand, irrevocable step in a young girl’s life.Its success
means bliss, content, sunshine; its failure means all that is the
reverse.Therefore, I say, she cannot have too much information, too
many advantages, to help her in her choice.”

Thus it came to be understood that Mrs.Minster was to say nothing, and
was not to seem to make more of Horace than she had previously done.Then he bowed over her hand and lightly kissed it, in a fashion which
the good lady fondly assumed to be European, and was gone.Minster spent the rest of the afternoon and evening in a semi-dazed
abstraction of mental power, from time to time fitfully remembering
some wealthy young man whom she had vaguely considered as a
possible son-in-law, and sighing impartially over each mustached
and shirt-fronted figure as she pushed it out into the limbo of the
might-have-been.She almost groaned once when she recalled that this
secret must be kept even from her friend Tabitha.As for Horace, he walked on air.The marvel of his great success
surrounded and lifted him, as angels bear the souls of the blessed
fleeting from earth in the artist’s dream.The young Bonaparte, home
from Italy and the reproduction of Hannibal’s storied feat, with Paris
on its knees before him and France resounding with his name, could not
have swung his shoulders more proudly, or gazed upon unfolding destiny
with a more exultant confidence.On his way homeward an instinctive desire to be alone with his joy led
him to choose unfrequented streets, and on one of these he passed a
milliner’s shop which he had never seen before.He would not have noted
it now, save that his eye was unconsciously caught by some stray
freak of color in the window where bonnets were displayed.Then, still
unconsciously, his vision embraced the glass door beside this window,
and there suddenly it was arrested and turned to a bewildered stare.In the dusk of the little shop nothing could be distinguished but two
figures which stood close by the door.The dying light from the western
sky, ruddily brilliant and penetrating in its final glow, fell full upon
the faces of these two as they were framed in profile by the door.One was the face of Kate Minster, the woman he was to wed.The other was
the face of Jessica Law-ton, the woman whose life he had despoiled.Horace realized nothing else so swiftly as that he had not been seen,
and, with an instinctive lowering of the head and a quickened step, he
passed on.It was not until he had got out of the street altogether that
he breathed a long breath and was able to think.Then he found himself
trembling with excitement, as if he had been through a battle or a
burning house.Reflection soon helped his nerves to quietude again.Evidently the girl
had opened a millinery shop, and evidently Miss Minster was buying a
bonnet of her.That was all there was of it, and surely there was no
earthly cause for perturbation in that.The young man had thought so
lightly of the Law-ton incident at Thanksgiving time that it had never
since occurred to him to ask Tracy about its sequel.It came to his mind now that Tracy had probably helped her to start the
shop.“Damn Tracy!” he said to himself.No, there was nothing to be uneasy about in the casual, commercial
meeting of these two women.He became quite clear on this point as he
strode along toward home.At his next meeting with Kate it might do no
harm to mention having seen her there in passing, and to drop a hint as
to the character of the girl whom she was dealing with.He would see
how the talk shaped itself, after the Law-ton woman’s name had been
mentioned.It was a great nuisance, her coming to Thessaly, anyway.He
didn’t wish her any special harm, but if she got in his way here she
should be crushed like an insect.it was silly to conceive
injury or embarrassment coming from her.So with a laugh he dismissed the subject from his thoughts, and went
home to dine with his father, and gladdened the General’s heart by
a more or less elaborated account of the day’s momentous event, in
complete forgetfulness of the shock he had had.In the dead of the night, however, he did think of it again with a
vengeance.He awoke screaming, and cold with frightened quakings, under
the spell of some hideous nightmare.When he thought upon them, the
terrors of his dream were purely fantastic and could not be shaped into
any kind of coherent form.But the profile of the Lawton girl seemed to
be a part of all these terrors, a twisted and elongated side-face, with
staring, empty eyes and lips down-drawn like those of the Medusa’s head,
and yet, strangely enough, with a certain shifting effect of beauty upon
it all under the warm light of a winter sunset.Horace lay a long time awake, deliberately striving to exorcise this
repellent countenance by fixing his thoughts upon the other face--the
strong, beautiful, queenly face of the girl who was to be his wife.But
he could not bring up before his mind’s eye this picture that he wanted,
and he could not drive the other away.Sleep came again somehow, and there were no more bad dreams to be
remembered.In the morning Horace did not even recall very distinctly
the episode of the nightmare, but he discovered some novel threads of
gray at his temple as he brushed his hair, and for the first time in his
life, too, he took a drink of spirits before breakfast.CHAPTER XXIV.--A VEHEMENT RESOLVE.The sloppy snow went away at last, and the reluctant frost was forced
to follow, yet not before it had wreaked its spite by softening all
the country roads into dismal swamps of mud, and heaving into painful
confusion of holes and hummocks the pavements on Thessaly’s main
streets.But in compensation the birds came back, and the crocus and
hyacinth showed themselves, and buds warmed to life again along the
tender silk-brown boughs and melted into the pale bright green of a
springs new foliage.Overcoats disappeared, and bare-legged boys with
poles and strings of fish dawned upon the vision.The air was laden with
the perfume of lilacs and talk about baseball.From this to midsummer seemed but a step.The factory workmen walked
more wearily up the hill in the heat to their noonday dinners;
lager-beer kegs advanced all at once to be the chief staple of freight
traffic at the railway dépôt.People who could afford to take travelling
vacations began to make their plans or to fulfil them, and those who
could not began musing pleasantly upon the charms of hop-picking in
September.it was autumn, and young men added with pride
another unit to the sum of their age, and their mothers and sisters
secretly subtracted such groups or fractions of units as were needful,
and felt no more compunction at thus hoodwinking Time than if he had
been a customs-officer.The village of Thessaly, which like a horizon encompassed most of the
individuals whom we know, could tell little more than this of the months
that had passed since Thanksgiving Day, now once again the holiday
closest at hand.The seasons of rest and open-air amusement lay behind
it, and in front was a vista made of toil.There had been many deaths,
and still more numerous births, and none in either class mattered much
save under the roof-tree actually blessed or afflicted.The year had
been fairly prosperous, and the legislature had passed the bill which at
New Year’s would enable the village to call itself a city.Of the people with whom this story is concerned, there is scarcely more
to record during this lapse of time.Jessica Lawton was perhaps the one most conscious of change.At the
very beginning of spring, indeed on the very day when Horace had his
momentary fright in passing the shop, Miss Minster had visited her, had
brought a reasonably comprehensive plan for the Girls’ Resting House, as
she wanted it called, and had given her a considerable sum of money to
carry out this plan.For a long time it puzzled Jessica a good deal that
Miss Minster never came again.The scheme took on tangible form; some
score of work-girls availed themselves of its privileges, and the
result thus far involved less friction and more substantial success
than Jessica had dared to expect.It seemed passing strange that Miss
Minster, who had been so deeply enthusiastic at first, should never have
cared to come and see the enterprise, now that it was in working order.Once or twice Miss Tabitha had dropped in, and professed to be greatly
pleased with everything, but even in her manner there was an indefinable
alteration which forbade questions about the younger lady.There were rumors about in the town which might have helped Jessica to
an explanation had they reached her.The village gossips did not fail
to note that the Minster family made a much longer sojourn this year at
Newport, and then at Brick Church, New Jersey, than they had ever done
before; and gradually the intelligence sifted about that young Horace
Boyce had spent a considerable portion of his summer vacation with them.Thessaly could put two and two together as well as any other community.The understanding little by little spread its way that Horace was going
to marry into the Minster millions.If there were repinings over this foreseen event, they were carefully
dissembled.People who knew the young man liked him well enough.His
professional record was good, and he had made a speech on the Fourth
of July which pleased everybody except ’Squire Gedney; but then, the
spiteful old “Cal” never liked anybody’s speeches save his own.Even
more satisfaction was felt, however, on the score of the General.His
son was a showy young fellow, smart and well-dressed, no doubt, but
perhaps a trifle too much given to patronizing folks who had not been to
Europe, and did not scrub themselves all over with cold water, and put
on a clean shirt with both collar and cuffs attached, every morning.But
for the General there was a genuine affection.It pleased Thessaly to
note that, since he had begun to visit at the home of the Minsters,
other signs of social rehabilitation had followed, and that he himself
drank less and led a more orderly life than of yore.When his intimates
jokingly congratulated him on the rumors of his son’s good fortune, the
General tacitly gave them confirmation by his smile.If Jessica had heard these reports, she might have traced at once to
its source Miss Minster’s sudden and inexplicable coolness.Not hearing
them, she felt grieved and perplexed for a time, and then schooled
herself into resignation as she recalled Reuben Tracy’s warning about
the way rich people took up whims and dropped them again, just as fancy
dictated.It was on the first day of November that the popular rumor as to
Horace’s prospects reached her, and this was a day memorable for vastly
more important occurrences in the history of industrial Thessaly.The return of cold weather had been marked, among other signs of the
season, by a renewed disposition on the part of Ben Lawton to drop in
to the millinery shop, and sit around by the fire in the inner room.Ben
came this day somewhat earlier than usual--the midday meal was in its
preliminary stages of preparation under Lucinda’s red hands--and it was
immediately evident that he was more excited over something that had
happened outside than by his expectation of getting a dinner.“There’s the very old Nick to pay down in the village!” he said, as he
put his feet on the stove-hearth.“Heard about it, any of you?”

Ben had scarcely ascended in the social scale during the scant year that
had passed, though the general average of whiteness in his paper collars
had somewhat risen, and his hair and straggling dry-mud- beard
were kept more duly under the subjection of shears.His clothes,
too, were whole and unworn, but they hung upon his slouching and
round-shouldered figure with “poor white” written in every misfitting
fold and on every bagging projection.Jessica had resigned all hope that
he would ever be anything but a canal boatman in mien or ambition, but
her affection for him had grown rather than diminished; and she was glad
that Lucinda, in whom there had been more marked personal improvements,
seemed also to like him better.No, Jessica said, she had heard nothing.“Well, the Minster furnaces was all shut down this morning, and so was
the work out at the ore-beds at Juno, and the men, boys, and girls in
the Thessaly Company’s mills all got word that wages was going to be
cut down.You can bet there’s a buzz around town, with them three things
coming all together, smack!”

“I suppose so,” answered Jessica, still bending over her work of
cleaning and picking out some plumes.“That looks bad for business this
winter, doesn’t it?”

Ben’s relations with business, or with industry generally, were of the
most remote and casual sort, but he had a lively objective interest in
the topic.“Why, it’s the worst thing that ever happened,” he said, with
conviction.“There’s seven hundred men thrown out already” (the figure
was really two hundred and twelve), “and more than a thousand more got
to git unless they’ll work for starvation wages.”

“It seems very hard,” the girl made reply.The idea came to her that
very possibly this would put an extra strain upon the facilities and
financial strength of the Resting House.“Hard!” her father exclaimed, stretching his hands over the stove-top;
“them rich people are harder than Pharaoh’s heart.What do them Minsters
care about poor folks, whether they starve or freeze to death, or
anything?”

“Oh, it is the Minsters, you say!” Jessica looked up now, with a new
interest.“Sure enough, they own the furnaces.How could they have done
such a thing, with winter right ahead of us?”

“It’s all to make more money,” put in Lucinda.“Them that don’t need
it’ll do anything to get it.That Kate Minster of
yours, for instance, she’ll wear her sealskin and eat pie just the same.What does it matter to her?”

“No; she has a good heart.I know she has,” said Jessica.“She wouldn’t
willingly do harm to any one.But perhaps she has nothing to do with
managing such things.Yes, that must be it.”

“I guess Schuyler Tenney and Hod Boyce about run the thing, from what I
hear,” commented the father.“Tenney’s been bossing around since summer
begun, and Boyce is the lawyer, so they say.”

Ben suddenly stopped, and looked first at Jessica, then at Lucinda.Catching the latter’s eye, he made furtive motions to her to leave the
room; but she either did not or would not understand them, and continued
stolidly at her work.“That Kate you spoke about,” he went on stum-blingly, nodding hints at
Lucinda to go away as he spoke, “she’s the tall girl, with the black
eyes and her chin up in the air, ain’t she?”

“Yes,” the two sisters answered, speaking together.“Well, as I was saying about Hod Boyce,” Ben said, and then stopped in
evident embarrassment.Finally he added, confusedly avoiding Jessica’s
glance, “‘Cindy, won’t you jest step outside for a minute?I want to
tell your sister something--something you don’t know about.”

“She knows about Horace Boyce, father,” said Jessica, flushing, but
speaking calmly.“There is no need of her going.”

Lucinda, however, wiped her hands on her apron, and went out into the
store, shutting the door behind her.Then Ben, ostentatiously regarding
the hands he held out over the stove, and turning them as if they
had been fowls on a spit, sought hesitatingly for words with which to
unbosom himself.“You see,” he began, “as I was a-saying, Hod Boyce is the lawyer, and
he’s pretty thick with Schuyler Tenney, his father’s partner, which,
of course, is only natural; and Tenney he kind of runs the whole
thing--and--and that’s it, don’t you see!”

“You didn’t send Lucinda out in order to tell me _that_, surely?”

“Well, no.But Hod being the lawyer, as I said, why, don’t you see, he
has a good deal to say for himself with the women-folks, and he’s been
off with them down to the sea-side, and so it’s come about that they
say--”

“They say what?” The girl had laid down her work altogether.“They say he’s going to marry the girl you call Kate--the big one with
the black eyes.”

The story was out.Jessica sat still under the revelation for a moment,
and held up a restraining hand when her father offered to speak further.Then she rose and walked to and fro across the little room, in front
of the stove where Ben sat, her hands hanging at her side and her brows
bent with thought.At last she stopped before him and said:

“Tell me all over again about the stopping of the works--all you know
about it.”

Ben Lawton complied, and re-stated, with as much detail as he could
command, the facts already exposed.The girl listened carefully, but with growing disappointment.Somehow the notion had arisen in her mind that there would be something
important in this story--something which it would be of use to
understand.But her brain could make nothing significant out of this
commonplace narrative of a lockout and a threatened dispute about wages.Gradually, as she thought, two things rose as certainties upon the
surface of her reflections.“That scoundrel is to blame for both things.He advised her to avoid me,
and he advised her to do this other mischief.”

“I thought you’d like to know,” Ben put in, deferentially.He felt a
very humble individual indeed when his eldest daughter paced up and down
and spoke in that tone.“Yes, I’m glad I know,” she said, swiftly.She eyed her father in an
abstracted way for an instant, and then added, as if thinking aloud:
“Well, then, my fine gentleman, you--simply--shall--_not_--marry Miss
Minster!”

Ben moved uneasily in his seat, as if this warning had been personally
addressed to him.“It _would_ be pretty rough, for a fact, wouldn’t it?”
 he said.“Well, it won’t _be_ at all!” she made emphatic answer.“I don’t know as you can do much to pervent it, Jess,” he ventured to
say._Cant_ I!” she exclaimed, with grim earnestness.“Wait and
see.”

Ben had waited all his life, and he proceeded now to take her at her
word, sitting very still, and fixing a ruminative gaze on the side
of the little stove.“All right,” he said, wrapped in silence and the
placidity of contented suspense.But Jessica was now all eagerness and energy.She opened the store door,
and called out to Lucinda with business-like decision of tone: “Come in
now, and hurry dinner up as fast as you can.I want to catch the 1.20
train for Tecumseh.”

The other two made no comment on this hasty resolve, but during the
brief and not over-inviting meal which followed, watched their kinswoman
with side-glances of uneasy surprise.The girl herself hastened through
her dinner without a word of conversation, and then disappeared within
the little chamber where she and Lucinda slept together.It was only when she came out again, with her hat and cloak on and a
little travelling-bag in her hand, that she felt impelled to throw some
light on her intention.She took from her purse a bank-note and gave it
to her sister.“Shut up the store at half-past four or five today,” she said; “and
there are two things I want you to do for me outside.Go around the
furniture stores, and get some kind of small sofa that will turn into a
bed at night, and whatever extra bed-clothes we need for it--as cheap as
you can.We’ve got a pillow to spare, haven’t we?You can put those two
chairs out in the Resting House; that will make a place for the bed in
this room.You must have it all ready when I get back to-morrow night.You needn’t say anything to the girls, except that I am away for a day.And then--or no: _you_ can do it better, father.”

The girl had spoken swiftly, but with ready precision.As she turned now
to the wondering Ben, she lost something of her collected demeanor, and
hesitated for a moment.“I want you--I want you to see Reuben Tracy, and ask him to come here at
six to-morrow,” she said.She deliberated upon this for an instant, and
held out her hand as if she had changed her mind.Then she nodded, and
said: “Or no: tell him I will come to his office, and at six sharp.It
will be better that way.”

When she had perfunctorily kissed them both, and gone, silence fell
upon the room.Ben took his pipe out of his pocket and looked at it with
tentative longing, and then at the stove.“You can go out in the yard and smoke, if you want to, but not in here,”
 said Lucinda, promptly.“You wouldn’t dare think of such a thing if she
were here,” she added, with reproach.Ben put back his pipe and seated himself again by the fire.“Mighty
queer girl, that, eh?” he said.“When she gets stirred up, she’s a
hustler, eh?”

“It must be she takes it from you,” said Lucinda, with a modified grin
of irony.“No,” said Ben, with quiet candor,
“she gets it from my father.He used to count on licking a lock-tender
somewhere along the canal every time he made a trip.I remember there
was one particular fellow on the Montezuma Ma’ash that he used to
whale for choice, but any of ’em would do on a pinch.He was jest
blue-mouldy for a fight all the while, your grandfather was.He was
Benjamin Franklin Lawton, the same as me, but somehow I never took
much to rassling round or fighting.It’s more in my line to take things
easy.”

Lucinda bore an armful of dishes out into the kitchen, without making
any reply, and Ben, presently wearying of solitude, followed to where
she bent over the sink, enveloped in soap-suds and steam.“I suppose you’ve got an idea what she’s gone for?” he propounded, with
caution.“It’s a ‘_who_’ she’s gone for,” said Lucinda.Pronouns were not Ben’s strong point, and he said, “Yes, I suppose it
is,” rather helplessly.He waited in patience for more information, and
by and by it came.“If I was her, I wouldn’t do it,” said Lucinda, slapping a plate
impatiently with the wet cloth.“No, I don’t suppose you would.In some ways you always had more sense
than people give you credit for, ‘Cindy,” remarked the father, with
guarded flattery.“Jess, now, she’s one of your hoity-toity kind--flare
up and whirl around like a wheel on a tree in the Fourth of July
fireworks.”

“She’s head and shoulders above all the other Lawtons there ever was or
ever will be, and don’t you forget it!” declared the loyal Lucinda, with
fervor.“That’s what I say always,” assented Ben.“Only--I thought you said you
didn’t think she was quite right in doing what she’s going to do.”

“It’s right enough; only she was happy here, and this’ll make her
miserable again--though, of course, she was always letting her mind run
on it, and perhaps she’ll enjoy having it with her--only the girls may
talk--and--”

Lucinda let her sentence die off unfinished in a rattle of knives and
spoons in the dish-pan.“Well, Cindy,” said Ben, in the frankness of despair, “I’m dot-rotted if
I know what you are talking about.” He grew pathetic as he went on: “I’m
your father and I’m her father, and there ain’t neither of you got a
better friend on earth than I be; but you never tell me anything, any
more’n as if I was a last year’s bird’s-nest.”

Lucinda’s reserve yielded to this appeal.“Well, dad,” she said, with
unwonted graciousness of tone, “Jess has gone to Tecumseh to bring
back--to bring her little boy.She hasn’t told me so, but I know it.”

The father nodded his head in comprehension, and said nothing.He had
vaguely known of the existence of the child, and he saw more or less
clearly the reason for this present step.The shame and sorrow which
were fastened upon his family through this grandson whom he had never
seen, and never spoken of above a whisper, seemed to rankle in his heart
with a new pain of mingled bitterness and compassion.He mechanically took out his pipe, filled it from loose tobacco in his
pocket, and struck a match to light it.objected to his smoking in the house, on account of the wares
in her shop, and let the flame burn itself out in the coal-scuttle.A
whimsical query as to whether this calamitous boy had also been named
Benjamin Franklin crossed his confused mind, and then it perversely
raised the question whether the child, if so named, would be a “hustler”
 or not.Ben leaned heavily against the door-sill, and surrendered
himself to humiliation.“What I don’t understand,” he heard Lucinda saying after a time, “is why
she took this spurt all of a sudden.”

“It’s all on account of that Gawd-damned Hod Boyce!” groaned Ben.“Yes; you told her something about him.What was it?”

“Only that they all say that he’s going to marry that big Minster
girl--the black-eyed one.”

Lucinda turned away from the sink, threw down her dish-cloth with a
thud, and put her arms akimbo and her shoulders well back.Watching her,
Ben felt that somehow this girl, too, took after her grandfather rather
than him.“Oh, _is_ he!” she said, her voice high-pitched and vehement.“I guess
_we’ll_ have something to say about _that_!”




CHAPTER XXV.--A VISITATION OF ANGELS.REUBEN Tracy waited in his office next day for the visit of the
milliner, but, to tell the truth, devoted very little thought to
wondering about her errand.The whole summer and autumn, as he sat now and smoked in meditation upon
them, seemed to have been an utterly wasted period in his life.Through all the interval which lay between this November day and that
afternoon in March, when he had been for the only time inside the
Minster house, one solitary set thought had possessed his mind.Long
ago it had formulated itself in his brain; found its way to the silent,
spiritual tongue with which we speak to ourselves.He loved Kate
Minster, and had had room for no other feeling all these months.At first, when this thought was still new to him, he had hugged it to
his heart with delight.Now the melancholy days indeed were come, and he
had only suffering and disquiet from it.She had never even answered his
letter proffering assistance.She was as far away from him, as coldly
unattainable, as the north star.It made him wretched to muse upon her
beauty and charm; his heart was weary with hopeless longing for her
friendship--yet he was powerless to command either mind or heart.They
clung to her with painful persistency; they kept her image before him,
whispered her name in his ear, filled all his dreams with her fair
presence, to make each wakening a fresh grief.In his revolt against this weakness, Reuben had burned the little
scented note for which so reverential a treasure-box had been made in
his desk.He could never enter that small
inner room where he now sat without glancing at the drawer which had
once been consecrated to the letter.It was humiliating that he should prove to have so little sense and
strength.He bit his cigar fiercely with annoyance when this aspect
of the case rose before him.If love meant anything, it meant a mutual
sentiment.By all the lights of philosophy, it was not possible to love
a person who did not return that love.This he said to himself over and
over again, but the argument was not helpful.Still his mind remained
perversely full of Kate Minster.During all this time he had taken no step to probe the business which
had formed the topic of that single disagreeable talk with his partner
in the preceding March.Miss Minster’s failure to answer his letter had
deeply wounded his pride, and had put it out of the question that he
should seem to meddle in her affairs.He had never mentioned the subject
again to Horace.The two young men had gone through the summer and
autumn under the same office roof, engaged very often upon the same
business, but with mutual formality and personal reserve.No controversy
had arisen between them, but Reuben was conscious now that they had
ceased to be friends, as men understand the term, for a long time.For his own part, his dislike for his partner had grown so deep and
strong that he felt doubly bound to guard himself against showing it.It
was apparent to the most superficial introspection that a good deal of
his aversion to Horace arose from the fact that he was on friendly terms
with the Minsters, and could see Miss Kate every day.He never looked
at his partner without remembering this, and extracting unhappiness from
the thought.But he realized that this was all the more reason why
he should not yield to his feelings.Both his pride and his sense of
fairness restrained him from quarrelling with Horace on grounds of that
sort.But the events of the last day or two had opened afresh the former
dilemma about a rupture over the Minster works business.Since Schuyler
Tenney had blossomed forth as the visible head of the rolling-mills,
Reuben had, in spite of his pique and of his resolution not to be
betrayed into meddling, kept a close watch upon events connected with
the two great iron manufacturing establishments.He had practically
learned next to nothing, but he was none the less convinced that a
swindle underlay what was going on.It was with this same conviction that he now strove to understand the
shutting-down of the furnaces and ore-fields owned by the Minsters, and
the threatened lockout in the Thessaly Manufacturing Company’s mills.But it was very difficult to see where dishonesty could come in.The
furnaces and ore-supply had been stopped by an order of the pig-iron
trust, but of course the owners would be amply compensated for that.The other company’s resolve to reduce wages meant, equally of course,
a desire to make up on the pay-list the loss entailed by the closing of
the furnaces, which compelled it to secure its raw material elsewhere.Taken by themselves, each transaction was intelligible.But considered
together, and as both advised by the same men, they seemed strangely in
conflict.What possible reason could the Thessaly Company, for example,
have for urging Mrs.Minster to enter a trust, the chief purpose of
which was to raise the price of pig-iron which they themselves bought
almost entirely?He racked his brain in
futile search for the missing clew to this financial paradox.Evidently
there was such a clew somewhere; an initial fact which would explain
the whole mystery, if only it could be got at.He had for his own
satisfaction collected some figures about the Minster business, partly
exact, partly estimated, and he had worked laboriously over these in the
effort to discover the false quantity which he felt sure was somewhere
concealed.But thus far his work had been in vain.Just now a strange idea for the moment fascinated his inclination.It
was nothing else than the thought of putting his pride in his pocket--of
going to Miss Minster and saying frankly: “I believe you are being
robbed.In Heaven’s name, give me a chance to find out, and to protect
you if I am right!I shall not even ask ever to
see you again, once the rescue is achieved.do not send me away
until then--I pray you that!”

While the wild project urged itself upon his mind the man himself
seemed able to stand apart and watch this battle of his own thoughts and
longings, like an outside observer.He realized that the passion he
had nursed so long in silence had affected his mental balance.He was
conscious of surprise, almost of a hysterical kind of amusement,
that Reuben Tracy should be so altered as to think twice about such a
proceeding.Then he fell to deploring and angrily reviling the change
that had come over him; and lo!all at once he found himself strangely
glad of the change, and was stretching forth his arms in a fantasy of
yearning toward a dream figure in creamy-white robes, girdled with a
silken cord, and was crying out in his soul, “I love you!”

The vision faded away in an instant as there came the sound of rapping
at the outer door.Reuben rose to his feet, his brain still bewildered
by the sun-like brilliancy of the picture which had been burned into
it, and confusedly collected his thoughts as he walked across the larger
room.His partner had been out of town some days, and he had sent the
office-boy home, in order that the Lawton girl might be able to talk
in freedom.The knocking; was that of a woman’s hand.Evidently it was
Jessica, who had come an hour or so earlier than she had appointed.He
wondered vaguely what her errand might be, as he opened the door.In the dingy hallway stood two figures instead of one, both thickly clad
and half veiled.The waning light of late afternoon did not enable him
to recognize his visitors with any certainty.The smaller lady of the
two might be Jessica--the the who stood farthest away.He had almost
resolved that it was, in this moment of mental dubiety, when the other,
putting out her gloved hand, said to him:

“I am afraid you don’t remember me, it is so long since we met.Tracy--Miss Ethel Minster.”

The door-knob creaked in Reuben’s hand as he pressed upon it for
support, and there were eccentric flashes of light before his eyes.“Oh, I am _so_ glad!” was what he said.“Do come in--do come in.” He
led the way into the office with a dazed sense of heading a triumphal
procession, and then stopped in the centre of the room, suddenly
remembering that he had not shaken hands.To give
himself time to think, he lighted the gas in both offices and closed all
the shutters.“Oh, I am _so_ glad!” he repeated, as he turned to the two ladies.The
radiant smile on his face bore out his words.“I am afraid the little
room--my own place--is full of cigar-smoke.Let me see about the fire
here.” He shook the grate vehemently, and poked down the coals through
one of the upper windows.“Perhaps it will be warm enough here.Let me
bring some chairs.” He bustled into the inner room, and pushed out his
own revolving desk-chair, and drew up two others from different ends of
the office.The easiest chair of all, which was at Horace’s table, he
did not touch.Then, when his two visitors had taken seats, he beamed
down upon them once more, and said for the third time:

“I really _am_ delighted!”

Miss Kate put up her short veil with a frank gesture.The unaffected
pleasure which shone in Reuben’s face and radiated from his manner was
something more exuberant than she had expected, but it was grateful to
her, and she and her sister both smiled in response.“I have an apology to make first of all, Mr.Tracy,” she said, and her
voice was the music of the seraphim to his senses.“I don’t think--I am
afraid I never answered your kind letter last spring.It is a bad habit
of mine; I am the worst correspondent in the world.And then we went
away so soon afterward.”

“I beg that you won’t mention it,” said Reuben; and indeed it seemed to
him to be a trivial thing now--not worth a thought, much less a word.He
had taken a chair also, and was at once intoxicated with the rapture of
looking Kate in the face thus again, and nervous lest the room was not
warm enough.“Won’t you loosen your wraps?” he asked, with solicitude.“I am afraid
you won’t feel them when you go out.” It was an old formula which he had
heard his mother use with callers at the farm, but which he himself
had never uttered before in his life.But then he had never before been
pervaded with such a tender anxiety for the small comforts of visitors.Miss Kate opened the throat of her fur coat.“We sha’n’t stay long,”
 she said.“We must be home to dinner.” She paused for a moment and then
asked: “Is there any likelihood of our seeing your partner, Mr.Boyce,
here to-day?”

Reuben’s face fell on the instant.Alas, poor fool, he thought, to
imagine there were angels’ visits for you!“No,” he answered, gloomily.He is out of town.”

“Oh, we didn’t want to see him,” put in Miss Ethel.“Quite the
contrary.”

Reuben’s countenance recovered all its luminous radiance.He stole a
glance at this younger girl’s face, and felt that he almost loved her
too.“No,” Miss Kate went on, “in fact, we took the opportunity of his being
away to come and try to see you alone.Tracy, about the way things are going on.”

The lawyer could not restrain a comprehending nod of the head, but he
did not speak.“We do not understand at all what is being done,” proceeded Kate.“There
is nobody to explain things to us except the men who are doing those
things, and it seems to us that they tell us just what they like.We
maybe doing them an injustice, but we are very nervous about a good many
matters.That is why we came to you.”

Reuben bowed again.There was an instant’s pause, and then he opened one
of the little mica doors in the stove.“I’m afraid this isn’t going
to burn up,” he said.“If you don’t mind smoke, the other room is much
warmer.”

It was not until he had safely bestowed his precious visitors in the
cosier room, and persuaded them to loosen all their furs, that his mind
was really at ease.“Now,” he remarked, with a smile of relief, “now go
ahead.Tell me everything.”

“We have this difficulty,” said Kate, hesitatingly; “when I spoke to you
before, you felt that you couldn’t act in the matter, or learn
things, or advise us, on account of the partnership.And as that still
exists--why--” She broke off with an inquiring sigh.“My dear Miss Minster,” Reuben answered, in a voice so firm and full
of force that it bore away in front of it all possibility of suspecting
that he was too bold, “when I left you I wanted to tell you, when I
wrote to you I tried to have you understand, that if there arose a
question of honestly helping you, of protecting you, and the partnership
stood between me and that act of honorable service, I would crush the
partnership like an eggshell, and put all my powers at your disposal.But I am afraid you did not understand.”

The two girls looked at each other, and then at the strong face before
them, with the focussed light of the argand burner upon it.“No,” said Kate, “I am afraid we didn’t.”

“And so I say to you now,” pursued Reuben, with a sense of exultation
in the resolute words as they sounded on his ear, “I will not allow any
professional chimeras to bind me to inactivity, to acquiescence, if
a wrong is being done to you.And more, I will do all that lies in my
power to help you understand the whole situation.And if, when it is
all mapped out before us, you need my assistance to set crooked things
straight, why, with all my heart you shall have it, and the partnership
shall go out of the window.”

“If you had said that at the beginning,” sighed Kate.“Ah, then I did not know what I know now!” answered Reuben, holding her
eyes with his, while the light on his face grew ruddier.“Well, then, this is what I can tell you,” said the elder girl, “and I
am to tell it to you as our lawyer, am I not--our lawyer in the sense
that Mr.Boyce is mamma’s lawyer?”

Reuben bowed, and settled himself in his chair to listen.It was a long
recital, broken now by suggestions from Ethel, now by questions from the
lawyer.From time to time he made notes on the blotter before him, and
when the narrative was finished he spent some moments in consulting
these, and combining them with figures from another paper, in new
columns.Then he said, speaking slowly and with deliberation:

“This I take to be the situation: You are millionnaires, and are in a
strait for money.When I say ‘you’ I speak of your mother and yourselves
as one.Your income, which formerly gave you a surplus of sixty thousand
or seventy thousand dollars a year for new investments, is all at once
not large enough to pay the interest on your debts, let alone your
household and personal expenses.It came from three sources--the furnaces, the telegraph stock, and a
group of minor properties.These furnaces and iron-mines, which were all
your own until you were persuaded to put a mortgage on them, have
been closed by the orders of outsiders with whom you were persuaded to
combine.Telegraph competition has
cut down your earnings from the Northern Union stock to next to nothing.No doubt we shall find that your income from the other properties has
been absorbed in salaries voted to themselves by the men into whose
hands you have fallen.That is a very old trick, and I shall be
surprised if it does not turn up here.In the second place, you are
heavily in debt.On the 1st of January next, you must borrow money,
apparently, to pay the interest on this debt.What makes it the harder
is that you have not, as far as I can discover, had any value received
whatever for this debt.In other words, you are being swindled out of
something like one hundred thousand dollars per year, and not even such
a property as your father left can stand _that_ very long.I should say
it was high time you came to somebody for advice.”

Before this terribly lucid statement the two girls sat aghast.It was Ethel who first found something to say.“We never dreamed of
this, Mr.Tracy,” she said, breathlessly.“Our idea in coming, what we
thought of most, was the poor people being thrown out of work in the
winter, like this, and it being in some way, _our_ fault!”

“People _think_ it is our fault,” interposed Kate.“Only to-day, as we
were driving here, there were some men standing on the corner, and one
of them called out a very cruel thing about us, as if we had personally
injured him.But what you tell me--is it really as bad as that?”

“I am afraid it is quite as bad as I have pictured it.”

“And what is to be done?There must be some way to stop it,” said Kate.“You will put these men in prison the first thing, won’t you, Mr.Who are the men who are robbing
us?”

Reuben smiled gravely, and ignored the latter question.“There are a
good many first things to do,” he said.“I must think it all over very
carefully before any step is taken.But the very beginning will be, I
think, for you both to revoke the power of attorney your mother holds
for you, and to obtain a statement of her management of the trusteeship
over your property.”

“She will refuse it plump!You don’t know mamma,” said Ethel.“She couldn’t refuse if the demand were made regularly, could she, Mr.He shook his head, and she went on: “But it seems
dreadful not to act _with_ mamma in the matter.Just think what a
situation it will be, to bring our lawyer up to fight her lawyer!It
sounds unnatural, doesn’t it?Tracy, if you were to
speak to her now--”

“No, that could hardly be, unless she asked me,” returned the lawyer.“Well, then, if I told her all you said, or you wrote it out for me to
show her.”

“No, nor that either,” said Reuben.“To speak frankly, Miss Minster,
your mother is perhaps the most difficult and dangerous element in the
whole problem.I hope you won’t be offended--but that any woman in
her senses could have done what she seems to have done, is almost
incredible.”

“Poor mamma!” commented Ethel.“She never would listen to advice.”

“Unfortunately, that is just what she has done,” broke in Kate.Tracy, tell me candidly, is it possible that the man who advised her
to do these things--or rather the two men, both lawyers, who advised
her--could have done so honestly?”

“I should say it was impossible,” answered Reuben, after a pause.Again the two girls exchanged glances, and then Kate, looking at her
watch, rose to her feet.Tracy,” she said,
offering him her hand, and unconsciously allowing him to hold it in
his own as she went on: “We are both deeply indebted to you.We want
you--oh, so much!--to help us.We will do everything you say; we will
put ourselves completely in your hands, won’t we, Ethel?”

The younger sister said “Yes, indeed!” and then smiled as she furtively
glanced up into Kate’s face and thence downward to her hand.Kate
herself with a flush and murmur of confusion withdrew the fingers which
the lawyer still held.“Then you must begin,” he said, not striving very hard to conceal the
delight he had had from that stolen custody of the gloved hand,
“by resolving not to say a word to anybody--least of all to your
mother--about having consulted me.You must realize that we have to
deal with criminals--it is a harsh word, I know, but there can be no
other--and that to give them warning before our plans are laid would be
a folly almost amounting to crime itself.If I may, Miss Kate”--there
was a little gulp in his throat as he safely passed this perilous first
use of the familiar name--“I will write to you to-morrow, outlining my
suggestions in detail, telling you what to do, perhaps something of
what I am going to do, and naming a time--subject, of course, to your
convenience--when we would better meet again.”

Thus, after some further words on the same lines, the interview ended.Reuben went to the door with them, and would have descended to the
street to bear them company, but they begged him not to expose himself
to the cold, and so, with gracious adieus, left him in his office and
went down, the narrow, unlighted staircase, picking their way.On the landing, where some faint reflection of the starlight and
gas-light outside filtered through the musty atmosphere, Kate paused
a moment to gather the weaker form of her sister protectingly close to
her.“Are you utterly tired out, pet?” she asked.“I’m afraid it’s been too
much for you.”

“Oh, no,” said Ethel.“Only--yes, I am tired of one thing--of your
slowness of perception.Tracy has been just
burning to take up our cause ever since he first saw you.You thought
he was indifferent, and all the while he was over head and ears in love
with you!I watched him every moment, and it was written all over his
face; and you never saw it!”

The answering voice fell with a caressing imitation of reproof upon the
darkness: “You silly puss, you think everybody is in love with me!” it
said.Then the two young ladies, furred and tippeted, emerged upon the
sidewalk, stepped into their carriage, and were whirled off homeward
under the starlight.A few seconds later, two other figures, a woman and a child, also
emerged from this same stairway, and, there being no coachman in waiting
for them, started on foot down the street.The woman was Jessica Lawton,
and she walked wearily with drooping head and shoulders, never once
looking at the little boy whose hand she held, and who followed her in
wondering patience.She had stood in the stairway, drawn up against the wall to let these
descending ladies pass.She had heard all they said, and had on the
instant recognized Kate Minster’s voice.For a moment, in this darkness
suddenly illumined by Ethel’s words, she had reflected.Then she, too,
had turned and come down the stairs again.It seemed best, under these
new circumstances, not to see Reuben Tracy just now.And as she slowly
walked home, she almost forgot the existence of the little boy, so
deeply was her mind engaged with what she had heard.As for Reuben, the roseate dreams had all come back.From the drear
mournfulness of chill November his heart had leaped, by a fairy
transition, straight into the bowers of June, where birds sang and
fountains plashed, and beauty and happiness were the only law.It would
be time enough to-morrow to think about this great struggle with cunning
scoundrels for the rescue of a princely fortune, which opened before
him.This evening his mind should dwell upon nothing but thoughts of
_her!_

And so it happened that an hour later, when he decided to lock up the
office and go over to supper, he had never once remembered that the
Lawton girl’s appointment remained unkept.CHAPTER XXVI.--OVERWHELMING DISCOMFITURE.Horace Boyce returned to Thessaly the next morning and drove at
once to his father’s house.There, after a longer and more luxurious
bath than usual, he breakfasted at his leisure, and then shaved and
dressed himself with great care.He had brought some new clothes from
New York, and as he put them on he did not regret the long detour to the
metropolis, both in going to and coming from Pittsburg, which had been
made in order to secure them.The frock coat was peculiarly to his
liking.No noble dandy in all the West End of London owed his tailor for
a more perfectly fitting garment.It was not easy to decide as to the
neckwear which should best set off the admirable upper lines of this
coat, but at last he settled on a lustreless, fine-ribbed tie of white
silk, into which he set a beautiful moonstone pin that Miss Kate had
once praised.Decidedly, the _ensemble_ left nothing to be desired.Horace, having completely satisfied himself, took off the coat again,
went down-stairs in his velveteen lounging-jacket, and sought out his
father in the library, which served as a smoking-room for the two men.The General sat in one chair, with his feet comfortably disposed on
another, and with a cup of coffee on still a third at his side.He was
reading that morning’s Thessaly _Banner_, through passing clouds of
cigar-smoke.“Hello, you’re back, are you?” was his greeting to his son.“I see the
whole crowd of workmen in your rolling-mills decided last night not to
submit to the new scale; unanimous, the paper says.Seen it?”

“No, but I guessed they would,” said Horace, nonchalantly.“They can all
be damned.”

The General turned over his paper.“There’s an editorial,” he went on,
“taking the workmen’s side, out and out.Says there’s something very
mysterious about the whole business.Winds up with a hint that
steps will be taken to test the legality of the trust, and probe
the conspiracy that underlies it.Those are the words--‘probe the
conspiracy.’ Evidently, you’re going to have John Fairchild in your
wool.He’s a good fighter, once you get him stirred up.”

“He can be damned, too,” said Horace, taking a chair and lighting a
cigar.“These free-trade editors make a lot of noise, but they don’t
do anything else.They’re merely blue-bottle flies on a window-pane--a
deuce of a nuisance to nervous people, that’s all.I’m not nervous,
myself.”

The General smiled with good-humored sarcasm at his offspring.“Seems
to me it wasn’t so long ago that you were tarred with the same brush
yourself,” he commented.“Most fellows are free-traders until it touches their own pockets, or
rather until they get something in their pockets to be touched.Then
they learn sense,” replied Horace.“You can count them by thousands,” said the General.“But what of the
other poor devils--the millions of consumers who pay through the nose,
in order to keep those pockets full, eh?They never seem to learn
sense.”

Horace smiled a little, and then stretched out his limbs in a
comprehensive yawn.“I can’t sleep on the cars as well as I used to,”
 he said, in explanation.“I almost wish now I’d gone to bed when I got
home.I don’t want to be sleepy _this_ afternoon, of all times.”

The General had returned to his paper.“I see there’s a story afloat
that you chaps mean to bring in French Canadian workmen, when the other
fellows are locked out.I thought there was a contract labor law against
that.”

Horace yawned again, and then, rising, poured out a little glassful of
spirits from a bottle on the mantel, and tossed it off.“No,” he said,
“it’s easy enough to get around that.Wendover is up to all those
dodges.Besides, I think they are already domiciled in Massachusetts.”

“Vane” Boyce laid down the paper and took off his eye-glasses.“I hope
these fellows haven’t got you into a scrape,” he remarked, eyeing his
son.“I don’t more than half like this whole business.”

“Don’t you worry,” was Horace’s easy response.“I’ll take good care of myself.If it comes to ‘dog eat dog,’ they’ll
find my teeth are filed down to a point quite as sharp as theirs are.”

“Maybe so,” said the father, doubtfully.“But that Tenney--he’s got eyes
in the back of his head.”

“My dear fellow,” said Horace, with a pleasant air of patronage, “he’s a
mere child compared with Wendover.But I’m not afraid of them both.I’m
going to play a card this afternoon that will take the wind out of both
their sails.When that is done, I’ll be in a position to lay down the
law to them, and read the riot act too, if necessary.”

The General looked inquiry, and Horace went on: “I want you to call for
me at the office at three, and then we’ll go together to the Minsters.I wouldn’t smoke after luncheon, if I were you.I’m not going down until
afternoon.I’ll explain to you what my idea is as we walk out there.You’ve got some ‘heavy father’ business to do.”

Horace lay at his ease for a couple of hours in the big chair his father
had vacated, and mused upon the splendor of his position.This afternoon
he was to ask Kate Minster to be his wife, and of the answer he had
no earthly doubt.His place thus made secure, he had some highly
interesting things to say to Wendover and Tenney.He had fathomed
their plans, he thought, and could at the right moment turn them to his
advantage.He had not paid this latest visit to the iron magnates of
Pennsylvania for nothing.He saw that Wendover had counted upon their
postponing all discussion of the compensation to be given the Minsters
for the closing of their furnaces until after January 1, in order that
when that date came, and Mrs.Minster had not the money to pay the
half-yearly twelve thousand dollars interest on the bonds, she would be
compelled to borrow still more from him, and thus tighten the hold which
he and Tenney had on the Minster property.It was a pretty scheme, but
Horace felt that he could block it.For one thing, he was certain that
he could induce the outside trust directors to pass upon the question
of compensation long before January.And even if this failed, he could
himself raise the money which Mrs.Then he would turn around and demand an accounting from these scoundrels
of the four hundred thousand dollars employed in buying the machinery
rights, and levy upon the plant of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company,
if necessary, to secure Mrs.It became all very
clear to his mind, now he thought it over, and he metaphorically snapped
his fingers at Wendover and Tenney as he went up-stairs and once more
carefully dressed himself.The young man stopped in the hall-way as he came down and enjoyed a
comprehensive view of himself in the large mirror which was framed
by the hat-rack.The frock coat and the white effect at the neck were
excellent.The heavy fur collar of the outer coat only heightened their
beauty, and the soft, fawn-tinted suède gloves were quite as charming
in the contrast they afforded under the cuffs of the same costly fur.Horace put his glossy hat just a trifle to one side, and was too happy
even to curse the climate which made rubbers over his patent-leather
shoes a necessity.He remembered that minute before the looking-glass, in the after-time,
as the culmination of his upward career.It was the proudest, most
perfectly contented moment of his adult life.*****

“There is something I want to say to you before you go.”

Reuben Tracy stood at the door of a small inner office, and looked
steadily at his partner as he uttered these words.There was little doing in the law in these few dead-and-alive weeks
between terms, and the exquisitely dressed Horace, having gone through
his letters and signed some few papers, still with one of his gloves
on, had decided not to wait for his father, but to call instead at the
hardware store.“I am in a bit of a hurry just now.” he said, drawing on the other
glove.“I may look in again before dinner.Won’t it keep till then?”

“It isn’t very long,” answered Reuben.“I’ve concluded that the
partnership was a mistake.It is open to either of us to terminate it at
will.I wish you would look around, and let me know as soon as you see
your way to--to--”

“To getting out,” interposed Horace.In his present mood the idea rather
pleased him than otherwise.“With the greatest pleasure in the world.You have not been alone in thinking that the partnership was a mistake,
I can assure you.”

“Then we understand each other?”

“Perfectly.”

“And you will be back, say at--”

“Say at half-past five.”

“Half-past five be it,” said Reuben, turning back again to his desk.Horace made his way across the muddy high street and found his father,
who smelt rather more of tobacco than could have been wished, but
otherwise was in complete readiness.“By the way,” remarked the young man, as the two walked briskly along,
“I’ve given Tracy notice that I’m going to leave the firm.I daresay we
shall separate almost immediately.The business hasn’t been by any means
up to my expectations, and, besides, I have too much already to do for
the Minster estate, and am by way, now, of having a good deal more.”

“I’m sorry, for all that,” said the General.“Tracy is a first-rate,
honest, straightforward fellow.It always did me good to feel that you
were with him.To tell you the truth, my boy,” he went on after a pause,
“I’m damnably uneasy about your being so thick with Tenney and that
gang, and separating yourself from Tracy.It has an unsafe look.”

“Tracy is a tiresome prig,” was Horace’s comment.“I’ve stood him quite
long enough.”

The conversation turned now upon the object of their expedition,
and when this had been explained to the General, and his part in it
outlined, he had forgotten his forebodings about his son’s future.That son himself, as he strode along, with his head well up and his
shoulders squared, was physically an object upon which the paternal eye
could look with entire pride.The General said to himself that he
was not only the best-dressed, but the handsomest young fellow in
all Dearborn County; and from this it was but a mental flash to the
recollection that the Boyces had always been handsome fellows, and the
old soldier recalled with satisfaction how well he himself had felt that
he looked when he rode away from Thessaly at the head of his regiment
after the firing on Fort Sumter.Minster came down alone to the drawingroom to receive her visitors,
and showed by her manner some surprise that the General accompanied his
son.“I rather wanted to talk with you about what you learned at Pittsburg,”
 she said, somewhat bluntly, to Horace, after conversation on ordinary
topics had begun to flag.“Pray let me go into the library for a time,
I beg of you,” he said, in his courtly, cheery manner.“I know the way,
and I can amuse myself there till you want me; that is,” he added, with
a twinkle in his eye, “if you decide that you want me at all.”

Mrs.She did not quite understand
what this stout, red-faced man meant by being wanted, and she was
extremely anxious to know all that her lawyer had to tell her about the
trust.What he had to tell her was eminently satisfactory.The directors
had postponed the question of how much money should be paid for the
shutting-down of the Minster furnaces, simply because it was taken
for granted that so opulent a concern could not be in a hurry about
a settlement.He was sure that he could have the affair all arranged
before December.As to other matters, he was equally confident.A year
hence she would be in vastly better condition, financially, than she
had ever been before.Then Horace began to introduce the subject nearest his heart.The family
had been excessively kind to him during the summer, he said.He had
been privileged to meet them on terms of almost intimacy, both here and
elsewhere.Every day of this delightful intercourse had but strengthened
his original desire.True to his word, he had never uttered a syllable
of what lay on his heart to Miss Kate, but he was not without confidence
that she looked upon him favorably.They had seemed always the best
of friends, and she had accepted from him attentions which must have
shadowed forth to her, at least vaguely, the state of his mind.He had
brought his father--in accordance with what he felt to be the courtesy
due from one old family to another--to formally speak with her upon the
subject, if she desired it, and then he himself, if she thought it best,
would beg for an interview with Miss Kate.Minster think it
preferable to leave this latter to the sweet arbitrament of chance?Horace looked so well in his new clothes, and talked with such fluency
of feeling, and moreover had brought such comforting intelligence
about the business troubles, that Mrs.Minster found herself at the end
smiling on him maternally, and murmuring some sort of acquiescence to
his remarks in general.“Then shall I bring in my father?” He asked the question eagerly, and
rising before she could reply, went swiftly to the door of the hall and
opened it.Then he stopped with abruptness, and held the door open with a hand that
began to tremble as the color left his face.A voice in the hall was speaking, and with such sharply defined
distinctness and high volume that each word reached even the mother
where she sat.“_You may tell your son, General Boyce,”_ said this voice, _“that I will
not see him.I am sorry to have to say it to you, who have always been
polite to me, but your son is not a good man or an honest man, and I
wish never to see him again.With all my heart I wish, too, that we
never had seen him, any of us._”

An indistinct sound of pained remonstrance arose outside as the echoes
of this first voice died away.Then followed a noise of footsteps
ascending the carpeted stairs, and Horace’s empty, staring eyes had a
momentary vision of a woman’s form passing rapidly upward, away from
him.Then he stood face to face with his father--a bleared, swollen,
indignant countenance it was that thrust itself close to his--and he
heard his father say, huskily:

“I am going.Let us get out of this house.”

Horace mechanically started to follow.Then he remembered that he had
left his hat behind, and went back into the drawing-room where Mrs.The absence of deep emotion on her statuesque face
momentarily restored his own presence of mind.“You have heard your daughter?” he said, his head hanging in spite of
himself, but his eyes keeping a strenuous scrutiny upon her face.“Yes: I don’t know what has come over Kate, lately,” remarked Mrs.Minster; “she always was the most curious girl.”

“Curious, indeed!” He choked down the sneer which tempted him, and went
on slowly: “You heard what she said--that I was dishonest, wicked.Where
she has suddenly got this new view of me, doesn’t matter--at least, just
at this moment.But I surely ought to ask if you--if you share it.Of
course, if I haven’t your confidence, why, I must lay down everything.”

“Oh, mercy, no!You mustn’t think of it,” the lady said, with animation.“I’m sure I don’t know in the least what it all means.It makes my head
ache sometimes wondering what they will do next--Kate, especially.No,
you mustn’t mind her.You really mustn’t.”

The young man’s manner had gradually taken on firmness, as if under
a coat of ice.Minster had a
novel glitter in it now.“Then I am to remain your lawyer, in spite of this, as if it hadn’t
happened?”

“Why, bless me, yes!You must see me through this
dreadful trust business, though, as you say, it must all be better in
the end than ever before.”

“Good-day, Mrs.I shall continue, then, to hold myself at your
service.”

He spoke with the same grave slowness, and bowed formally, as if to go.The lady rose, and of her own volition offered him her hand.“Perhaps
things will alter in her mind.I am so sorry!” she said.The young man permitted himself a ghostly half-smile.“It is only when I
have thought it all over that I shall know whether I am sorry or not,”
 he said, and bowing again he left her.Out by the gate, standing on the gravel-path wet with November rain and
strewn with damp, fallen leaves, the General waited for him.The air had
grown chill, and the sky was spreading a canopy for the night of gloomy
gray clouds.The two men, without a word, fell into step, and walked
down the street together.Horace, striding silently along with his teeth tight set, his head bowed
and full of fierce confusion of thought, and his eyes angrily fixed
on the nothing straight ahead, became, all at once, aware that his
office-boy was approaching on the sidewalk, whistling dolefully to suit
the weather, and carrying his hands in his pockets.“Where are you going, Robert?” the lawyer demanded, stopping the lad,
and speaking with the aggressive abruptness of a man longing to affront
all about him.Minster’s,” answered the boy, wondering what was up, and
confusedly taking his hands out of his pockets.“What for?” This second question was even more sharply put.Tracy.” The boy took a letter from the inside of
his coat, and then added: “I said Mrs.Minster, but the letter is for
her daughter.I’m to give it to her herself.”

“I’ll take charge of it myself,” said Horace, with swift decision,
stretching out his hand.But another hand was reached forth also, and grasped the young man’s
extended wrist with a vehement grip.you won’t!” swore the General, his face purpling with the
rush of angry blood, and his little gray eyes flashing.“No, sir, you
won’t!” he repeated; and then, bending a momentary glance upon the boy,
he snapped out: “Well, you!Go and do your
errand as you were told!”

The office-boy started with a run to obey his command, and did not
slacken his pace until he had turned a corner.He had never encountered
a real general in action before, and the experience impressed him.Father and son looked in silence into each other’s faces for an instant.Then the father said, with something between a curse and a groan:

“My God!You _are_ a damned scoundrel!”

“Well, however that may be,” replied Horace, frowning, “I’m not in the
mood just now to take any cheek, least of all from you!”

As the General stared at him with swelling rage in his fat face, and
quivering, inarticulate lips, his son went on in a bitter voice, from
between clinched teeth:

“I owe this to you!Everything I did was done to
lift you out of the gutter, to try and make a man of you again, to put
you back into decent society--to have the name of Boyce something else
once more besides a butt for bar-keepers and factory-girls.I had you
around my neck like a mill-stone, and you’ve pulled me down.I hope
you’re satisfied!”

For a moment it seemed as if the General would fall.His thick neck grew
scarlet, his eyes turned opaque and filled with tears, and he trembled
and almost tottered on his legs.Then the fit passed as suddenly as
it had come.He threw a sweeping glance up and down the figure of his
son--taking in the elegant line of the trousers, the costly fur, the
delicate, spotless gloves, the white jewelled neckwear, the shining
hat, the hardened and angry face beneath it--and then broke boisterously
forth into a loud guffaw of contemptuous laughter.When he had laughed his fill, he turned upon his heel without a word
and walked away, carrying himself with proud erectness, and thumping his
umbrella on the sidewalk with each step as he went.When Thessaly awoke one morning some fortnight later, and rubbed its
eyes, and, looking again, discovered in truth that everything outside
was white, the recognition of the familiar visitor was followed by a
sigh.The children still had a noisy friendliness of greeting for the
snow, and got out their sleds and bored anticipatory holes in their
boot-heels with a thrill of old-time enthusiasm; but even their delight
became subdued in its manifestations before noon had arrived--their
elders seemed to take the advent of winter so seriously.Villagers,
when they spoke to one another that morning, noted that the voice of
the community had suddenly grown graver in tone and lower in pitch.The
threat of the approaching season weighed with novel heaviness on the
general mind.For the first time since the place had begun its manufacturing career,
Thessaly was idle.The Minster furnaces had been closed for more than
two weeks; the mills of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company, for nearly
that length of time.Half the bread-winners in the town were out of work
and saw no prospect of present employment.Usage is most of all advantageous _in_ adversity; These artisans of
Thessaly lacked experience in enforced idleness and the trick of making
bricks without straw.Employment, regular and well requited, had become
so much a matter of course that its sudden cessation now bewildered
and angered them.Each day brought to their minds its fresh train of
calamitous consequences.Children needed shoes; the flour-barrel was
nearly empty; to lay in a pig for the winter might now be impossible.The question of rent quarter loomed black and menacing like a
thunder-cloud on the horizon; and there were those with mortgages
on their little homes, who already saw this cloud streaked with the
lightning of impending tempest.Anxious housewives began to retrench at
the grocer’s and butcher’s; but the saloons and tobacco shops had almost
doubled their average of receipts.Even on ordinary holidays the American workman, bitten as he is with the
eager habitude of labor, more often than not some time during the day
finds himself close to the place where at other times he is employed.There his thoughts are: thither his steps all unconsciously bend
themselves.So now, in this melancholy, indefinite holiday which
November had brought to Thessaly, the idlers instinctively hung about
the deserted works.The tall, smokeless chimneys, the locked gates,
the grimy windows--through which the huge dark forms of the motionless
machines showed dimly, like the fossils of extinct monsters in a
museum--the dreary stretches of cinder heaps and blackened waste
which surrounded the silent buildings--all these had a cruel kind of
fascination for the dispossessed toilers.They came each day and stood lazily about in groups: they smoked in
taciturnity, told sardonic stories, or discussed their grievance, each
according to his mood; but they kept their eyes on the furnaces and
mills whence wages came no more and where all was still.There was
something in it akin in pathos to the visits a mother pays to the
graveyard where her child lies hidden from sight under the grass and the
flowers.It was the tomb of their daily avocation that these men came to
look at.But, as time went on, there grew to be less and less of the pathetic
in what these men thought and said.The sense of having been wronged
swelled within them until there was room for nothing but wrath.In a
general way they understood that a trust had done this thing to them.But that was too vague and far-off an object for specific cursing.The
Minster women were nearer home, and it was quite clear that they were
the beneficiaries of the trust’s action.There were various stories told
about the vast sum which these greedy women had been paid by the trust
for shutting down their furnaces and stopping the output of iron ore
from their fields, and as days succeeded one another this sum steadily
magnified itself.The Thessaly Manufacturing Company, which concerned a much larger number
of workmen, stood on a somewhat different footing.Mechanics who knew
men who were friendly with Schuyler Tenney learned in a roundabout
fashion that he really had been forced into closing the mills by the
action of the Minster women.When you came to think of it, this seemed
very plausible.Then the understanding sifted about among the men that
the Minsters were, in reality, the chief owners of the Manufacturing
Company, and that Tenney was only a business manager and minor partner,
who had been overruled by these heartless women.All this did not make
friends for Tenney.The lounging workmen on the street comers eyed him
scowlingly when he went by, but their active hatred passed him over and
concentrated itself upon the widow and daughters of Stephen Minster.On
occasion now, when fresh rumors of the coming of French Canadian workmen
were in the air, very sinister things were muttered about these women.Before the lockout had been two days old, one of the State officers of a
labor association had visited Thessaly, had addressed a hastily convened
meeting of the ejected workmen, and had promised liberal assistance
from the central organization.He had gone away again, but two or three
subordinate officials of the body had appeared in town and were still
there.They professed to be preparing detailed information upon which
their chiefs could act intelligently.They had money in their pockets,
and displayed a quite metropolitan freedom about spending it over
the various bars.Some of the more conservative workmen thought these
emissaries put in altogether too much time at these bars, but they were
evidently popular with the great bulk of the men.They had a large fund
of encouraging reminiscence about the way bloated capitalists had been
beaten and humbled and brought down to their knees elsewhere in the
country, and they were evidently quite confident that the workers would
win this fight, too.Just how it was to be won no one mentioned, but
when the financial aid began to come in it would be time to talk about
that.And when the French Canadians came, too, it would be time--The
rest of this familiar sentence was always left unspoken, but lowering
brows and significant nods told how it should be finished.So completely did this great paralytic stroke to industry monopolize
attention, that events in the village, not immediately connected with
it, passed almost unnoticed.Nobody gave a second thought, for example,
to the dissolution of the law firm of Tracy & Boyce, much less dreamed
of linking it in any way with the grand industrial drama which engaged
public interest.Horace, at the same time, took rooms at the new brick hotel, the
Central, which had been built near the railroad depot, and opened an
office of his own a block or two lower down Main Street than the one he
had vacated.This did not attract any special comment, and when, on the
evening of the 16th of November, a meeting of the Thessaly Citizens’
Club was convened, fully half those who attended learned there for the
first time that the two young lawyers had separated.The club at last had secured a building for itself--or rather the
refusal of one--and this meeting was called to decide upon ratifying
the purchase.It was held in a large upper room of the building under
discussion, which had been the gymnasium of a German Turn Verein, and
still had stowed away in its comers some of the apparatus that the
athletes had used.When Horace, as president, called the gathering to order, there were
some forty men present, representing very fairly the business and
professional classes of the village.Schuyler Tenney was there as one
of the newer members; and Reuben Tracy, with John Fairchild, Dr.Lester,
Father Chance, and others of the founders, sat near one another farther
back in the hall.The president, with ready facility, laid before the meeting the business
at hand.The building they were in could be purchased, or rented on a
reasonably extended lease.It seemed to the committee better to take it
than to think of erecting one for themselves--at least for the present.So much money would be needed: so much for furniture, so much for
repairs, etc.; so much for heating and lighting, so much for service,
and so on--a very compact and lucid statement, indeed.A half hour was passed in more or less inconclusive discussion before
Reuben Tracy rose to his feet and began to speak.The story that he and
Boyce were no longer friends had gone the round of the room, and some
men turned their chairs to give him the closer attention with eye and
ear.Before long all were listening with deep interest to every word.Reuben started by saying that there was something even more important
than the question of the new building, and that was the question of what
the club itself meant.In its inception, the idea of creating machinery
for municipal improvement had been foremost.Certainly he and those
associated with him in projecting the original meeting had taken that
view of their work.That meeting had contented itself with an indefinite
expression of good intentions, but still had not dissented from the idea
that the club was to mean something and to do something.Now it became
necessary, before final steps were taken, to ask what that something
was to be.So far as he gathered, much thought had been given as to
the probable receipts and expenditure, as to where the card-room, the
billiard-room, the lunch-room, and so forth should be located, and as to
the adoption of all modern facilities for making themselves comfortable
in their new club-house.But about the original objects of the club
he had not heard a syllable.To him this attitude was profoundly
unsatisfactory.At the present moment, the village was laboring under
a heavy load of trouble and anxiety.Nearly if not quite a thousand
families were painfully affected by the abrupt stoppage of the
two largest works in the section.If actual want was not already
experienced, at least the vivid threat of it hung over their poorer
neighbors all about them.This fact, it seemed to him, must appeal to
them all much more than any conceivable suggestion about furnishing a
place in which they might sit about at their ease in leisure hours.He
put it to the citizens before him, that their way was made exceptionally
clear for them by this calamity which had overtaken their village.If
the club meant anything, it must mean an organization to help these poor
people who were suddenly, through no fault of their own, deprived of
incomes and employment.That was something vital, pressing, urgent;
easy-chairs and billiard-tables could wait, but the unemployed artisans
of Thessaly and their families could not.This in substance was what Reuben said; and when he had finished there
succeeded a curious instant of dead silence, and then a loud confusion
of comment.Half a dozen men were on their feet now, among them both
Tenney and John Fairchild.The hardware merchant spoke first, and what he said was not so prudent
as those who knew him best might have expected.The novel excitement of
speaking in public got into his head, and he not only used language
like a more illiterate man than he really was, but he attacked Tracy
personally for striving to foment trouble between capital and labor,
and thereby created an unfavorable impression upon the minds of his
listeners.Editor Fairchild had ready a motion that the building be taken on a
lease, but that a special committee be appointed by the meeting to
devise means for using it to assist the men of Thessaly now out of
employment, and that until the present labor crisis was over, all
questions of furnishing a club-house proper be laid on the table.He
spoke vigorously in support of this measure, and when he had finished
there was a significant round of applause.Horace rose when order had been restored, and speaking with some
hesitation, said that he would put the motion, and that if it were
carried he would appoint such a committee, but----

“I said ‘to be appointed by the meeting’!” called out John Fairchild,
sharply.The president did not finish his sentence, but sat down again, and
Tenney pushed forward and whispered in his ear.Two or three others
gathered sympathetically about, and then still others joined the group
formed about the president, and discussed eagerly in undertones this new
situation.“I must decline to put the motion.It is out of order,” answered Horace at last, as a result of this
faction conference.“Then I will put it myself,” cried Fairchild, rising.“But I beg
first to move that you leave the chair!” Horace looked with angered
uncertainty down upon the men who remained seated about Fairchild.They
were as thirty to his ten, or thereabouts.He could not stand up against
this majority.For a moment he had a fleeting notion of trying to
conciliate it, and steer a middle course, but Tenney’s presence had made
that impossible.He laid down his gavel, and, gathering up his hat and
coat, stepped off the platform to the floor.“There is no need of moving that,” he said.“I’ll go without it.So far
as I am concerned, the meeting is over, and the club doesn’t exist.”

He led the way out, followed by Tenney, Jones the match-manufacturer,
the Rev.One or two gentlemen rose
as if to join the procession, and then thinking better of it sat down
again.By general suggestion, John Fairchild took the chair thus vacated, but
beyond approving the outlines of his plan, and appointing a committee
with Tracy at its head to see what could be done to carry it out, the
meeting found very little to do.It was agreed that this committee
should also consider the question of funds, and should call a meeting
when it was ready to report, which should be at the earliest possible
date.Then the meeting broke up, and its members dispersed, not without
well-founded apprehensions that they had heard the last of the Thessaly
Citizens’ Club.CHAPTER XXVIII.--IN THE ROBBER’S CAVE.HORACE Boyce was too enraged to preserve a polite demeanor toward the
sympathizers who had followed him out of the hall, and who showed
a disposition to discuss the situation with him now the street was
reached.After a muttered word or two to Tenney, the young man abruptly
turned his back on the group, and walked with a hurried step down the
street toward his hotel.Entering the building, he made his way direct to the bar-room back of
the office--a place where he had rarely been before--and poured out for
himself a heavy portion of whiskey, which he drank off without noticing
the glass of iced water placed for him beside the bottle.He turned to
go, but came back again to the bar after he had reached the swinging
screen-doors, and said he would take a bottle of the liquor up to his
room.“I haven’t been sleeping well these last few nights,” he explained
to the bar-keeper.Once in his room, Horace put off his boots, got into easy coat and
slippers, raked down the fire, looked for an aimless minute or two at
the row of books on his shelf, and then threw himself into the arm-chair
beside the stove.The earlier suggestion of gray in his hair at the
temples had grown more marked these last few weeks, and there were new
lines of care on his clear-cut face, which gave it a haggard look now as
he bent his brows in rumination.An important interview with Tenney and Wendover was to take place in
this room a half hour later; but, besides a certain hard-drawn notion
that he would briskly hold his own with them, Horace did not try to form
plans for this or even to fasten his mind upon it.The fortnight or more that had passed since that terrible momentary
vision of Kate Minster running up the stairs to avoid him, had been to
the young man a period of unexampled gloominess and unrest, full of
deep wrath at the fate which had played upon him such a group of scurvy
tricks all at once, yet having room for sustained exasperation over the
minor discomforts of his new condition.The quarrel with his father had forced him to change his residence, and
this was a peculiarly annoying circumstance coming at just such a time.He realized now that he had been very comfortable in the paternal house,
and that his was a temperament extremely dependent upon well-ordered and
satisfactory surroundings.These new rooms of his, though they cost a
good deal of money, were not at all to his liking, and the service was
execrable.The sense of being at home was wholly lacking; he felt as
disconnected and out of touch with the life about him as if he had been
travelling in a foreign country which he did not like.The great humiliation and wrong--the fact that he had been rejected with
open contumely by the rich girl he had planned to marry--lay steadily
day and night upon the confines of his consciousness, like a huge black
morass with danger signals hung upon all its borders.His perverse mind
kept returning to view these menacing signals, and torturing him with
threats to disregard them and plunge into the forbidden darkness.The
constant strain to hold his thoughts back from this hateful abyss wore
upon him like an unremitting physical pain.The resolve which had chilled and stiffened him into self-possession
that afternoon in the drawingroom, and had even enabled him to speak
with cold distinctness to Mrs.Minster and to leave the house of insult
and defeat with dignity, had been as formless and unshaped as poor,
heart-torn, trembling Lear’s threat to his daughters before Gloster’s
gate.Revenge he would have--sweeping, complete, merciless, but by what
means he knew not.Two weeks were gone, and the revenge seemed measurably nearer, though
still its paths were all unmapped.It was clear enough to the young
man’s mind now that Tenney and Wendover were intent on nothing less than
plundering the whole Minster estate.Until that fatal afternoon in the
drawingroom, he had kept himself surrounded with an elaborate system of
self-deception.He had pretended to himself that the designs of these
associates of his were merely smart commercial plans, which needed only
to be watched with equal smartness.He knew the men to be villains, and openly rated them as such in his
thoughts.He had a stem satisfaction in the thought that their schemes were in
his hands.He would join them now, frankly and with all his heart,
only providing the condition that his share of the proceeds should
be safe-guarded.They should have his help to wreck this insolent,
purse-proud, newly rich family, to strip them remorselessly of their
wealth.His fellow brigands might keep the furnaces, might keep
everything in and about this stupid Thessaly.He would take his share in
hard coin, and shake the mud and slush of Dearborn County from off his
feet.He was only in the prime of his youth.Romance beckoned to him
from a hundred centres of summer civilization, where men knew how to
live, and girls added culture and dowries to beauty and artistic dress.The dream of a career in his native village had brought him delight only
so long as Kate Minster was its central figure.That vision now seemed
so clumsy and foolish that he laughed at it.He realized that he had
never liked the people here about him.Even the Minsters had been
provincial, only a gilded variation upon the rustic character of the
section.Nothing but the over-sanguine folly of youth could ever have
prompted him to think that he wanted to be mayor of Thessaly, or that it
would be good to link his fortunes with the dull, under-bred place.The two men for whom he had been waiting broke abruptly in upon his
revery by entering the room.They came in without even a show of
knocking on the door, and Horace frowned a little at their rudeness.Stout Judge Wendover panted heavily with the exertion of ascending the
stairs, and it seemed to have put him out of temper as well as breath.He threw off his overcoat with an impatient jerk, took a chair, and
gruffly grunted “How-de-do!” in the direction of his host, without
taking the trouble to even nod a salutation.Tenney also seated himself,
but he did not remove his overcoat.Even in the coldest seasons he
seemed to wear the same light, autumnal clothes, creaseless and gray,
and mouselike in effect.The two men looked silently at Horace, and he
felt that they disapproved his velveteen coat.“Well?” he asked, at last, leaning back in his chair and trying to equal
them in indifference.“What is new in New York, Judge?”

“Never mind New York!Thessaly is more in our line just now,” said
Wendover, sternly.“You’re welcome to my share
of the town, I’m sure,” he said; “I’m not very enthusiastic about it
myself.”

“How much has Reuben Tracy got to work on?How much have you blabbed
about our business to him?” asked the New Yorker.“I neither know nor care anything about Mr.Tracy,” said Horace, coldly.“As for what you elegantly describe as my ‘blabbing’ to him, I daresay
you understand what it means.I don’t.”

“It means that you have made a fool of us; got us into trouble; perhaps
ruined the whole business, by your God A’mighty stupidity!That’s
what it means!” said Wendover, with his little blue-bead eyes snapping
angrily in the lamplight.“I hope it won’t strike you as irrelevant if I suggest that this is my
room,” drawled Horace, “and that I have a distinct preference for civil
conversation in it.If you have any criticisms to offer upon my conduct,
as you seem to think that you have, I must beg that you couch them in
the language which gentlemen--”

“Gentlemen be damned!” broke in the Judge, sharply.“We’ve had too much
‘gentleman’ in this whole business!What
does Tracy mean by his applications?”

“I haven’t the remotest idea what you are talking about.I’ve already
told you that I know nothing of Mr.Tracy or his doings.”

Schuyler Tenney interposed, impassively: “He may not have heard of the
application, Judge.You must remember that, for the sake of appearances,
he then being in partnership, you were made Mrs.Minster’s attorney, in
both the agreements.That is how notices came to be served on you.”

The Judge had not taken his eyes off the young man in the velveteen
jacket.“Do you mean to tell me that you haven’t learned from Mrs.Minster that this man Tracy has made applications on behalf of the
daughters to upset the trust agreement, and to have a receiver appointed
to overhaul the books of the Mfg.Company?”

Horace sat up straight.“Good God, no!” he stammered.“I’ve heard
nothing of that.”

“You never do seem to hear about things.What did you suppose you were
here for, except to watch Mrs.Minster, and keep track of what was going
on?” demanded Wendover.“I may tell you,” answered Horace, speaking hesitatingly, “that
circumstances have arisen which render it somewhat difficult for me
to call upon Mrs.Minster at her house--for that matter, out of the
question.She has only been to my office office within the--the last
fortnight.”

Schuyler Tenney spoke again.“The ‘circumstances’ means, Judge, that
he--”

“Pardon me, Mr.Tenney,” said Horace, with decision: “what the
circumstances mean is neither your business nor that of your friend.That is something that we will not discuss, if you please.”

“Won’t we, though!” burst in Wendover, peremptorily.“You make a fool of
us.You go sneaking around one of the girls up there.You think you’ll
set yourself in a tub of butter, and let our schemes go to the devil.You get kicked out of the house
for your impudence.And then you sit here, dressed like an Italian
organ-grinder, by God, and tell me that we won’t discuss the subject!”

Horace rose to his feet, with all his veins tingling.“You may leave
this room, both of you,” he said, in a voice which he with difficulty
kept down.Judge Wendover rose, also, but it was not to obey Horace’s command.Instead, he pointed imperiously to the chair which the young man had
vacated.“Sit down there,” he shouted.I warn you, I’m in
no mood to be fooled with.You deserve to have your neck wrung for what
you’ve done already.If I have another word of cheek from you, by God,
it _shall_ be wrung!We’ll throw you on the dungheap as we would a dead
rat.”

Horace had begun to listen to these staccato sentences with his arms
folded, and lofty defiance in his glance.Somehow, as he looked into his
antagonist’s blazing eyes, his courage melted before their hot menace.The pudgy figure of the Judge visibly magnified itself under his gaze,
and the threat in that dry, husky voice set his nerves to quaking.“All right,” he said, in an altered voice.“I’m willing enough to talk,
only a man doesn’t like to be bullied in that way in his own house.”

“It’s a tarnation sight better than being bullied by a warder in Auburn
State’s prison,” said the Judge, as he too resumed his chair.“Take my
word for that.”

Schuyler Tenney crossed his legs nervously at this, and coughed.Horace
looked at them both in a mystified but uneasy silence.“You heard what I said?” queried Wendover, brusquely, after a moment’s
pause.“Undoubtedly I did,” answered Horace.“But--but its application escaped
me.”

“What I mean is”--the Judge hesitated for a moment to note Tenney’s mute
signal of dissuasion, and then went on: “We might as well not beat about
the bush--what I mean is that there’s a penitentiary job in this thing
for somebody, unless we all keep our heads, and have good luck to boot.You’ve done your best to get us all into a hole, with your confounded
airs and general foolishness.If worse comes to worst, perhaps we can
save ourselves, but there won’t be a ghost of a chance for you.I’ll see
to that myself.If we come to grief, you shall pay for it.”

“What do you mean?” asked Horace, in a subdued tone, after a period of
silent reflection.“Where does the penitentiary part come in?”

“I don’t agree with the Judge at all,” interposed Tenney, eagerly.“I
don’t think there’s any need of looking on the dark side of the thing.We don’t _know_ that Tracy knows anything.And then, why shouldn’t we be
able to get our own man appointed receiver?”

“This is the situation,” said Wendover, speaking deliberately.Minster to borrow four hundred thousand dollars for the
purchase of certain machinery patents, and you drew up the papers for
the operation.It happens that she already owned--or rather that the
Mfg.Company already owned--these identical rights and patents.They
were a part of the plant and business we put into the company at one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars when we moved over from Cadmus.But
nobody on her side, except old Clarke, knew just what it was that we put
in.He died in Florida, and it was arranged that his papers should
pass to you.There was no record that we had sold the right of the nail
machine.”

Horace gazed with bewilderment into the hard-drawn, serious faces of
the two men who sat across the little table from him.In the yellow
lamplight these countenances looked like masks, and he searched them in
vain for any sign of astonishment or emotion.The thing which was now
for the first time being put into words was strange, but as it shaped
itself in his mind he did not find himself startled.It was as if he had
always known about it, but had allowed it to lapse in his memory.These
men were thieves--and he was their associate!The room with its central
point of light where the three knaves were gathered, and its deepening
shadows round about, suggested vaguely to him a robber’s cave.Primary
instincts arose strong within him.Terror lest discovery should come
yielded precedence to a fierce resolve to have a share of the booty.It
seemed minutes to him before he spoke again.“Then she was persuaded to mortgage her property, to buy over again at
four times its value what she had already purchased?” he asked, with an
assumption of calmness.“That seems to be about what you managed to induce her to do,” said the
Judge, dryly.“Then you admit that it was I who did it--that you owe the success of
the thing to me!” The young man could not restrain his eagerness to
establish this point.He leaned over the table, and his eyes sparkled
with premature triumph.“No: I said ‘_seems_,’” answered Wendover._We_
know that from the start you have done nothing but swell around at our
expense, and create as many difficulties for us and our business
as possible.But the courts and the newspapers would look at it
differently._They_ would be sure to regard you as the one chiefly
responsible.”

“I should think we were pretty much in the same boat, my friend,” said
Horace, coldly.Daniel went to the hallway.“I daresay,” replied the New Yorker, “only with this difference: we can
swim, and you can’t.By that I mean, we’ve got money, and you haven’t.See the point?”

Horace saw the point, and felt himself revolted at the naked selfishness
and brutality with which it was exposed.The disheartening fact that
these men would not hesitate for an instant to sacrifice him--that they
did not like him, and would not lift a finger to help him unless it was
necessary for their own salvation--rose gloomily before his mind.“Still, it would be better for all of us that the boat shouldn’t be
capsized at all,” he remarked.“That’s it--that’s the point,” put in Tenney, with animation; “that’s
what I said to the Judge.”

“This Tracy of yours,” said Wendover, “has got hold of the Minster
girls.He has been before Judge Waller with a
whole batch of applications.First, in chambers, he’s brought an action
to dissolve the trust, and asked for an order returnable at Supreme
Court chambers to show cause why, in the mean time, the furnaces
shouldn’t be opened.His grounds are, first, that the woman was
deceived; and second, that the trust is against public policy.Now,
it seems to me that our State courts can’t issue an order binding on
a board of directors at Pittsburg.Isn’t it a thing that belongs to a
United States court?How is that?”

“I’m sure I don’t know,” answered Horace.“It’s a new question to me.”

“Tenney told me you knew something as a lawyer,” was Wendover’s angry
comment.“I’d like to know where it comes in.”

The hardware merchant hastened to avert the threatened return to
personalities.“Tell him about the receiver motion,” he said.“Then Tracy, before the same judge, but in special term, has applied for
a receiver for the Thessaly Mfg.Company, on the ground of fraud.”

“That’s the meanest thing about the whole business,” commented Tenney.“Well, what do you advise doing?” asked Horace, despondently.“There are two things,” said Wendover.“First, to delay everything until
after New Year, when Mrs.Minster’s interest becomes due and can’t be
paid.That can be done by denying jurisdiction of the State court in the
trust business, and by asking for particulars in the receiver matter.The next thing is to make Thessaly too hot for those women, and for
Tracy, too, before New Year.If a mob should smash all the widow’s
windows for her, for instance, perhaps burn her stable, she’d be mighty
glad to get out of town, and out of the iron business, too.”

“But that wouldn’t shut Tracy up,” observed Tenney.“He sticks at things
like a bull-dog, once he gets a good hold.”

“I’m thinking about Tracy,” mused the Judge.Horace found himself regarding these two visitors of his with something
like admiration.The resourcefulness and resolution of their villainy
were really wonderful.Such
men would be sure to win, if victory were not absolutely impossible.At
least, there was nothing for it but to cordially throw in his lot with
them.“Whatever is decided upon, I’ll do my share,” he said, with decision.Upon reflection, he added: “But if I share the risks, I must be clearly
understood to also share the profits.”

Judge Wendover looked at the young man sternly, and breathed hard as he
looked.“Upon my word,” he growled at last, “you’re the cheekiest young
cub I’ve seen since before the war!”

Horace stood to his guns.“However that may be,” he said, “you see what
I mean.This is a highly opportune time, it strikes me, to discover just
how I stand in this matter.”

“You’ll stand where you’re put, or it will be the worse for you!”

“Surely,” Schuyler Tenney interposed, “you ought to have confidence that
we will do the fair thing.”

“My bosom may be simply overflowing with confidence in you both”--Horace
ventured upon a suggestion of irony in his intonation--“but experience
seems to indicate the additional desirability of an understanding.If you will think it over, I daresay you will gather the force of my
remark.”

The New Yorker seemed not to have heard the remark, much less to have
understood it.He addressed the middle space between Horace and Tenney
in a meditative way: “Those two speech-making fellows who are here from
the Amalgamated Confederation of Labor, or whatever it is, can both be
had to kick up a row whenever we like.They
notified me that they were coming here ten days ago.We can tell them
to keep their hands off the Canadians when they come next week, and
lead their crowd instead up to the Minster house.We’ll go over that
together, Tenney, later on.But about Tracy--perhaps these fellows
might--”

Wendover followed up the train of this thought in silence, with a
ruminative eye on vacancy.“What I was saying,” insisted Horace, “was that I wanted to know just
how I stand.”

“I suppose it’s out of the question to square Tracy,” pursued Wendover,
thinking aloud, “and that Judge Waller that he’s applied to, he’s just
another such an impracticable cuss.There’s no security for business at
all, when such fellows have the power to muddle and interfere with it.Tenney, _you_ know this Tracy.Why can’t you think of something?”

“As I remarked before,” Horace interposed once more, “what am I to get
out of this thing?”

This time the New Yorker heard him.He slowly turned his round,
white-framed face toward the speaker, and fixed upon him a penetrating
glance of wrath, suspicion, and dislike.“Oh, _that_ is what you want to know, is it?” he said, abruptly, after a
momentary silence.“Well, sir, if you had your deserts, you’d get
about seven years’ hard labor.As it is, you’ve had over seven thousand
dollars out of the concern, and you’ve done seven hundred thousand
dollars’ worth of damage.If you can make a speech before Judge Waller
this week that will stave off all these things until after New Year’s,
perhaps I may forgive you some of the annoyance and loss your infernal
idiocy and self-conceit have caused us.When you’ve done that, it will
be time enough to talk to me about giving you another chance to keep
your salary.You never made a bigger mistake
in your life than in thinking you could dictate terms to Peter Wendover,
now or any other time!Why, you poor empty-headed creature, who do you
suppose _you_ could frighten?You’re as helpless as a June-bug in a
cistern with the curb shut down.”

The Judge had risen while speaking, and put on his overcoat.He took his
hat now, and glanced to note that Tenney was also on his feet.Then he
added these further words to the young man, whose head was drooping in
spite of himself, and whose figure had sunk into a crouching posture in
the easy-chair:

“Let me give you some advice.Take precious good care not to annoy me
any more while this business is on.It was Tenney who picked you out, and who thought you could be useful.I didn’t believe in you from the start.Now that I’ve summered and
wintered you, I stand amazed, by God!that I could ever have let you get
mixed up in my affairs.But here you are, and it will be easier for us
to put up with you, and carry you along, than throw you out.Besides,
you may be able to do some good, if what I’ve said puts any sense into
your head.But don’t run away with the idea that you are necessary to
us, or that you are going to share anything, as you call it, or that you
can so much as lift your finger against us without first of all crushing
yourself.This is plain talk, and it may help you to size yourself up as
you really are.According to your own notion of yourself, God Almighty’s
overcoat would have about made you a vest.My idee of you is different,
you see, and I’m a good deal nearer right than you are.I’ll send the
papers over to you to-morrow, and let us see what you will do with
them.”

The New York magnate turned on his heel at this, and, without any word
of adieu, he and Tenney left the room.Horace sat until long after midnight in his chair, with the bottle
before him, half-dazed and overwhelmed amidst the shapeless ruins of his
ambition.CHAPTER XXIX.--THE MISTS CLEARING AWAY.REUBEN Tracy rose at an unwontedly early hour next morning, under the
spur of consciousness that he had a very busy day before him.While he
was still at his breakfast in the hotel dining-room, John Fairchild came
to keep an appointment made the previous evening, and the two men were
out on the streets together before Thessaly seemed wholly awake.Their first visit was to the owner of the building which the Citizens’
Club had thought of hiring, and their business here was promptly
despatched; thence they made their way to the house of a boss-carpenter,
and within the hour they had called upon a plumber, a painter, and one
or two other master artisans.By ten o’clock those of this number with
whom arrangements had been made had put in an appearance at the building
in question, and Tracy and Fairchild explained to them the plans which
they were to carry out.The discussion and settlement of these consumed
the time until noon, when the lawyer and the editor separated, and
Reuben went to his office.Here, as had been arranged, he found old ’Squire Gedney waiting
for him.A long interview behind the closed door of the inner office
followed, and when the two men came out the justice of the peace was
putting a roll of bills into his pocket.“This is Tuesday,” he said to Tracy.“I daresay I can be back by
Thursday.The bother about it is that Cadmus is such an out-of-the-way
place to get at.”

“At all events, I’ll count on seeing you Friday morning,” answered
Reuben.“Then, if you’ve got what I expect, we can go before the county
judge and get our warrants by Saturday, and that will be in plenty of
time for the grand jury next week.”

“If they don’t all eat their Christmas dinner in Auburn prison, call me
a Dutchman!” was Gedney’s confident remark, as he took his departure.Reuben, thus left alone, walked up and down the larger room in
pleased excitement, his hands in his pockets and his eyes aglow with
satisfaction.So all-pervasive was his delight that it impelled him
to song, and he hummed to himself as he paced the floor a faulty
recollection of a tune his mother had been fond of, many years before.Reuben had no memory for music, and knew neither the words nor the air,
but no winged outburst of exultation from a triumphant Viking in the
opera could have reflected a more jubilant mood.He had unearthed the conspiracy, seized upon its avenues of escape,
laboriously traced all its subterranean burrowings.Even without the
proof which it was to be hoped that Gedney could bring from Cadmus,
Reuben believed he had information enough to justify criminal
proceedings.Nothing could be clearer than guilty collusion between this
New Yorker, Wendover, and some of the heads of the pig-iron trust to rob
Mrs.At almost every turn and corner in the
ramification of the huge swindle, Tenney and Boyce also appeared.Reuben Tracy was the softest-hearted of men, but
it did not occur to him to relent when he thought of his late partner.To the contrary, there was a decided pleasure in the reflection that
nothing could avert well-merited punishment from this particular young
man.The triumph had its splendid public side, moreover.Great and lasting
good must follow such an exposure as he would make of the economic and
social evils underlying the system of trusts.A staggering blow would be
dealt to the system, and to the sentiment back of it that rich men might
do what they liked in America.With pardonable pride he thrilled at the
thought that his arm was to strike this blow.The effect would be felt
all over the country.It could not but affect public opinion, too, on
the subject of the tariff--that bomb-proof cover under which these
men had conducted their knavish operations.Reuben sang with increased
fervor as this passed through his mind.On his way back from luncheon--which he still thought of as
dinner--Reuben Tracy stopped for a few moments at the building he and
Fairchild had rented.The carpenters were already at work, ripping down
the partitions on the ground floor, in a choking and clamorous confusion
of dust and sound of hammering.The visible energy of these workmen and
the noise they made were like a sympathetic continuation of his song of
success.He would have enjoyed staying for hours, watching and listening
to these proofs that he at last was doing something to help move the
world around.When he came out upon the street again, it was to turn his steps to the
house of the Minsters.He had not been there since his visit in March,
and there was a certain embarrassment about his going now.Minster’s house, and he had been put in the position of acting
against her, as counsel for her daughters.It was therefore a somewhat
delicate business.But Miss Kate had asked him to come, and he would
be sincerely glad of the opportunity of telling Mrs.Minster the whole
truth, if she would listen to it.Just what form this opportunity might
take he could not foresee; but his duty was so clear, and his arguments
must carry such absolute conviction, that he approached the ordeal with
a light heart.Miss Kate came down into the drawing-room to receive him, and Reuben
noted with a deep joy that she again wore the loose robe of creamy
cloth, girdled by that same enchanted rope of shining white silk.Something made him feel, too, that she observed the pleased glance of
recognition he bestowed upon her garments, and understood it, and
was not vexed.Their relations had been distinctly cordial--even
confidential--for the past fortnight; but the reappearance of this
sanctified and symbolical gown--this mystical robe which he had
enshrined in his heart with incense and candles and solemn veneration,
as does the Latin devotee with the jewelled dress of the Bambino--seemed
of itself to establish a far more tender intimacy between them.He
became conscious, all at once, that she knew of his love.“I have asked mamma to see you,” she said, when they were seated, “and
I think she will.Since it was first suggested to her, she has wavered a
good deal, sometimes consenting, sometimes not.The poor lady is almost
distracted with the trouble in which we have all become involved, and
that makes it all the more difficult for her to see things in their
proper connection.I hope you may be able to show her just how matters
stand, and who her real friends are.”

The girl left at this, and in a few moments reappeared with her mother,
to whom she formally presented Mr.Minster had suffered great mental anguish since the troubles
came on, her countenance gave no hint of the fact.It was as regular and
imperturbable and deceptively impressive as ever, and she bore herself
with perfect self-possession, bowing with frosty precision, and seating
herself in silence.Reuben himself began the talk by explaining that the steps which he had
felt himself compelled to take in the interest of the daughters implied
not the slightest hostility to the mother.They had had, in fact, the
ultimate aim of helping her as well.He had satisfied himself that she
was in the clutch of a criminal conspiracy to despoil her estate
and that of her daughters.It was absolutely necessary to act
with promptness, and, as he was not her lawyer, to temporarily and
technically separate the interest of her daughters from her own, for
legal purposes.All that had been done was, however, quite as much to
her advantage as to that of her daughters, and when he had explained to
her the entire situation he felt sure she would be willing to allow him
to represent her as well as her daughters in the effort to protect the
property and defeat the conspiracy.Minster offered no comment upon this expression of confidence, and
Reuben went on to lay before her the whole history of the case.He
did this with great clearness--as if he had been talking to a
child--pointing out to her how the scheme of plunder originated, where
its first operations revealed themselves, and what part in turn each of
the three conspirators had played.She listened to it all with an expressionless face, and though she must
have been startled and shocked by a good deal of it, Reuben could gather
no indication from her manner of her feelings or her opinions.When he
had finished, and his continued silence rendered it clear that he was
not going to say any more, she made her first remark.“I’m much obliged to you, I’m sure,” she said, with no sign of emotion.“It was very kind of you to explain it to me.But of course _they_
explain it quite differently.”

“No doubt,” answered Reuben.“That is just what they would do.The
difference is that they have lied to you, and that I have told you what
the books, what the proofs, really show.”

“I have known Peter Wendover since we were children together,” she said,
after a momentary pause, “and _he_ never would have advised my daughters
to sue their own mother!”

Reuben suppressed a groan.Minster; least
of all, your daughters,” he tried to explain.“The actions I have
brought--that is, including the applications--are directed against the
men who have combined to swindle you, not at all against you.They might
just as well have been brought in your name also, only that I had no
power to act for you.”

“It is the same as suing me.Judge Wendover said so,” was her reply.“What I seek to have you realize is that Judge Wendover purposely
misleads you.He is the head and front of the conspiracy to rob you.I am going to have him indicted for it.The proofs are as plain as a
pikestaff.How, then, can you continue to believe what he tells you?”

“I quite believe that you mean well, Mr.“But
lawyers, you know, always take opposite sides.One lawyer tells you one
thing; then the other swears to precisely the contrary.Don’t think I
blame them.But you know what I mean.”

A little more of this hopeless conversation ensued, and then Mrs.“Don’t let me drive you away, Mr.Tracy,” she said, as
he too got upon his feet.“But if you will excuse me--I’ve had so much
worry lately--and these headaches come on every afternoon now.”

As Reuben walked beside her to open the door, he ventured to say: “It
is a very dear wish of mine, Mrs.Minster, to remove all this cause for
worry, and to get you back control over your property, and to rid you
of these scoundrels, root and branch.For your own sake and that of your
daughters, let me beg of you to take no step that will embarrass me in
the fight.There is nothing that you could do now to specially help me,
except to do nothing at all.”

“If you mean for me not to sue my daughters,” she said, as he opened the
door, “you may rest easy.Nothing would tempt me to do _that!_ The very
idea of such a thing is too dreadful.Good-day, sir.”

Reuben this time did not repress the groan, after he had closed the door
upon Mrs.He realized that he had made no more impression on
her mind than ordnance practice makes on a sandbank.He did not attempt
to conceal his dejection as he returned to where Kate sat, and resumed
his chair in front of her.The daughter’s smiling face, however,
partially reassured him, “That’s mamma all over,” she said.“Isn’t it
wonderful how those old race types reappear, even in our day?She is
as Dutch as any lady of Haarlem that Franz Hals ever painted.Her mind
works sidewise, like a crab.I’m _so_ glad you told her everything!”

“If I could only feel that it had had any result,” said Reuben.“Oh, but it will have!” the girl insisted confidently.“I’m sure she
liked you very much.”

“That reminds me--” the lawyer spoke musingly--“I think I was told
once that she didn’t like me; that she stipulated that I was not to be
consulted about her business by--by my then partner.Do you know?”

“I have an idea,” said Kate.Then she stopped, and a delicate shadowy
flush passed over her face.“But it was nothing,” she added, hastily,
after a long pause.She could not bring herself to mention that year-old
foolish gossip about the Lawton girl.Reuben did not press for an answer, but began telling her about the work
he and Fairchild had inaugurated that morning.“We are not going to wait
for the committee,” he said.“The place can be in some sort of
shape within a week, I hope, and then we are going to open it as a
reading-room first of all, where every man of the village who behaves
himself can be free to come.There will be tea and coffee at low prices;
and if the lockout continues, I’ve got plans for something else--a kind
of soup-kitchen.We sha’n’t attempt to put the thing on a business basis
at all until the men have got to work again.Then we will leave it to
them, as to how they will support it, and what shall be done with the
other rooms.By the way, I haven’t seen much lately of the Lawton girl’s
project.I’ve heard vaguely that a start had been made, and that it
seemed to work well.Are you pleased with it?”

Kate answered in a low voice: “I have never been there but once since we
met there last winter.I did what I promised, in the way of assistance,
but I did not go again.I too have heard vaguely that it was a success.”

Reuben looked such obvious inquiry that that young lady felt impelled to
explain: “The very next day after I went there last with the money and
the plan, I heard some very painful things about the girl--about her
present life, I mean--from a friend, or rather from one whom I took then
to be a friend; and what he said prejudiced me, I suppose--”

A swift intuition helped Reuben to say: “By a friend’ you mean Horace
Boyce!”

Kate nodded her head in assent.As for Reuben, he rose abruptly from his
seat, motioning to his companion to keep her chair.He thrust his hands
into his pockets, and began pacing up and down along the edge of the
sofa at her side, frowning at the carpet.“Miss Kate,” he said at last, in a voice full of strong feeling, “there
is no possibility of my telling you what an infernal blackguard that man
is.”

“Yes, he has behaved very badly,” she said.“I suppose I am to blame for
having listened to him at all.But he had seen me there at her place,
through the glass door, and he seemed so anxious to keep me from being
imposed upon, and possibly compromised, that--”

“My dear young lady,” broke in Reuben, “you have no earthly idea of the
cruelty and meanness of what he did by saying that to you.I can’t--or
yes, why shouldn’t I?The fact is that that poor girl--and when she was
at my school she was as honest and good and clever a child as I ever saw
in my life--owed her whole misery and wretchedness to Horace Boyce.I
never dreamed of it, either at the time or later; in fact, until the
very day I met you at the milliner’s shop.Somehow I mentioned that he
was my partner, and then she told me.And then, knowing that, I had
to sit still all summer and see him coming here every day, on intimate
terms with you and your sister and mother.” Reuben stopped himself with
the timely recollection that this was an unauthorized emotion, and
added hurriedly: “But I never could have imagined such baseness, to
deliberately slander her to you!”

Kate did not at once reply, and when she did speak it was to turn the
talk away from Horace Boyce.“I will go and see her to-morrow,” she
said.“I am very glad to hear you say that,” was Reuben’s comment.“It is like
you to say it,” he went on, with brightening eyes.“It is a benediction
to be the friend of a young woman like you, who has no impulses that are
not generous, and whose only notion of power is to help others.”

“I shall not like you if you begin to flatter,” she replied, with mock
austerity, and an answering light in her eyes.“I am really a very
perverse and wrong-headed girl, distinguished only for having never done
any good at all.And anybody who says otherwise is not a friend, but a
flatterer, and I am weary of false tongues.”

Miss Ethel came in while Reuben was still turning over in his mind the
unexpressed meanings of these words, and with her entrance the talk
became general once more.The lawyer described to the two sisters the legal steps he had taken,
and their respective significance, and then spoke of his intention to
make a criminal complaint as soon as some additional proof, now being
sought, should come to hand.“And Horace Boyce will go to prison, then?” she
asked, eagerly.“There is a strong case against him,” answered Reuben.The graveness of his tone affected the girl’s spirits, and led her to
say in an altered voice: “I don’t want to be unkind, and I daresay I
shall be silly enough to cry in private if the thing really happens; but
when I think of the trouble and wickedness he has been responsible for,
and of the far more terrible mischief he might have wrought in this
family if I--that is, if we had not come to you as we did, I simply
_hate_ him.”

“Don’t let us talk about him any more, puss,” said Kate, soberly, rising
as she spoke.CHAPTER XXX.--JESSICA’S GREAT DESPAIR.It was on the following day that a less important member of society
than Miss Minster resolved to also pay a visit to the milliner’s shop.Ben Lawton’s second wife--for she herself scarcely thought of “Mrs.Lawton” as a title appertaining to her condition of ill-requited
servitude--had become possessed of some new clothes.Their monetary
value was not large, but they were warm and respectable, with bugle
trimming on the cloak, and a feather rising out of real velvet on the
bonnet; and they were new all together at the same time, a fact which
impressed her mind by its novelty even more than did the inherent charm
of acquisition.To go out in this splendid apparel was an obvious duty.The notion of going shopping loomed in the background of
Mrs.Lawton’s thoughts for a while, but in a formless and indistinct
way, and then disappeared again.Her mind was not civilized enough to
assimilate the idea of loitering around among the stores when she had no
money with which to buy anything.Gradually the conception of a visit to her step-Jessica took shape in
her imagination.Perhaps the fact that she owed her new clothes to the bounty of this
girl helped forward this decision.There was also a certain curiosity to
see the child who was Ben’s grandson, and so indirectly related to her,
and for whose anomalous existence there was more than one precedent in
her own family, and who might turn out to resemble her own little lost
Alonzo.But the consideration which primarily dictated her choice was
that there was no other place to go to.Her reception by Jessica, when she finally found her way by Samantha’s
complicated directions to the shop, was satisfactorily cordial.She was
allowed to linger for a time in the show-room, and satiate bewilderment
over the rich plumes, and multi- velvets and ribbons there
displayed; then she was taken into the domestic part of the building,
where she was asked like a real visitor to take off her cloak and
bonnet, and sat down to enjoy the unheard-of luxury of seeing somebody
else getting a “meal of victuals” ready.The child was playing by
himself back of the stove with some blocks.He seemed to take no
interest in his new relation, and Mrs.Lawton saw that if Alonzo
had lived he would not have looked like this boy, who was blonde
and delicate, with serious eyes and flaxen curls, and a high, rather
protuberant forehead.The brevet grandmother heard with surprise from Lucinda that this
five-year-old child already knew most of his letters.She stole furtive
glances at him after this, from time to time, and as soon as Jessica had
gone out into the store and closed the door she asked:

“Don’t his head look to you like water on the brain?”

Lucinda shook her head emphatically: “He’s healthy enough,” she said.“And his name’s Horace, you say?”

“Yes, that’s what I said,” replied the girl.Lawton burned to ask what other name the lad bore, but the
peremptory tones of her daughter warned her off.Instead she remarked:
“And so he’s been livin’ in Tecumseh all this while?They seem to have
brung him up pretty good--teachin’ him his A B C’s and curlin’ his
hair.”

“He had a good home.Jess paid high, and the people took a liking to
him,” said Lucinda.“I s’pose they died or broke up housekeepin’,” tentatively suggested
Mrs.“No: Jess wanted him here, or thought she did.” Lucinda’s loyalty to her
sister prompted her to stop the explanation at this.But she herself
had been sorely puzzled and tried by the change which had come over
the little household since the night of the boy’s arrival, and the
temptation to put something of this into words was too strong to be
mastered.“I wish myself he hadn’t come at all,” she continued from the table
where she was at work.“Not but that he’s a good enough young-one, and
lots of company for us both, but Jess ain’t been herself at all since
she brought him here.It ain’t his fault--poor little chap--but she
fetched him from Tecumseh on account of something special; and then
that something didn’t seem to come off, and she’s as blue as a whetstone
about it, and that makes everything blue.And there we are!”

Lucinda finished in a sigh, and proceeded to rub grease on the inside of
her cake tins with a gloomy air.*****

In the outer shop, Jessica found herself standing surprised and silent
before the sudden apparition of a visitor whom she had least of all
expected--Miss Kate Minster.The bell which formerly jangled when the street door opened had been
taken off because it interfered with the child’s mid-day sleep, and
Jessica herself had been so deeply lost in a brown study where she sat
sewing behind the counter that she had not noted the entrance of the
young lady until she stood almost within touch.Then she rose hurriedly,
and stood confused and tongue-tied, her work in hand.She dropped this
impediment when Miss Minster offered to shake hands with her, but even
this friendly greeting did not serve to restore her self-command or
induce a smile.“I have a thousand apologies to make for leaving you alone all this
while,” said Kate.“But--we have been so troubled of late--and, selfish
like, I have forgotten everything else.Or no--I won’t say that--for I
have thought a great deal about you and your work.And now you must tell
me all about both.”

Miss Minster had seated herself as she spoke, and loosened the boa
about her throat, but Jessica remained standing.She idly noted that no
equipage and coachman were in waiting outside, and let the comment drift
to her tongue.“You walked, I see,” she said.“It isn’t pleasant to take out the horses now.The
streets are full of men out of work, and they blame us for it, and to
see us drive about seems to make them angry.I suppose it’s a natural
enough feeling; but the boys pelted our coachman with snowballs the
other day, while my sister and I were driving, and the men on the corner
all laughed and encouraged them.But if I walk nobody molests me.”

The young lady, as she said this with an air of modest courage, had
never looked so beautiful before in Jessica’s eyes, or appealed so
powerfully to her liking and admiration.But the milliner was conscious
of an invasion of other and rival feelings which kept her face smileless
and hardened the tone of her voice.“Yes, the men feel very bitterly,” she said.“I know that from the
girls.A good many of them--pretty nearly all, for that matter--have
stopped coming here, since the lockout, because _your_ money furnished
the Resting House.That shows how strong the feeling is.”

“You amaze me!”

There was no pretence in Miss Kate’s emotion.She looked at Jessica with
wide-open eyes, and the astonishment in the gaze visibly softened and
saddened into genuine pain.“Oh, I _am_ so sorry!” she said.“I never
thought of _that_.How can we get that cruel
notion out of their heads?I did so _truly_ want to help the girls.Surely there must be some way of making them realize this.The closing
of the works, that is a business matter with which I had nothing to do,
and which I didn’t approve; but this plan of yours, _that_ was really
a pet of mine.It is only by a stupid accident that I did not come here
often, and get to know the girls, and show them how interested I was in
everything.Tracy spoke of you yesterday, I resolved to come at
once, and tell you how ashamed I was.”

Jessica’s heart was deeply stirred by this speech, and filled with
yearnings of tenderness toward the beautiful and good patrician.But
some strange, undefined force in her mind held all this softness in
subjection.“The girls are gone,” she said, almost coldly.“They will not come
back--at least for a long time, until all this trouble is forgotten.”

“They hate me too much,” groaned Kate, in grieved self-abasement.“They don’t know _you!_ What they think of is that it is the Minster
money; that is what they hate.To take away from the men with a shovel,
and give back to the girls with a spoon--they won’t stand that!” The
latent class-feeling of a factory town flamed up in Jessica’s bosom,
intolerant and vengeful, as she listened to her own words.“I would
feel like that myself, if I were in their place,” she said, in curt
conclusion.The daughter of the millions sat for a little in pained irresolution.She was conscious of impulses toward anger at the coldness, almost the
rudeness, of this girl whom she had gone far out of and beneath her way
to assist.Her own class-feeling, too, subtly prompted her to dismiss
with contempt the thought of these thick-fingered, uncouth factory-girls
who were rejecting her well-meant bounty.But kindlier feelings strove
within her mind, too, and kept her for the moment undecided.She looked up at Jessica, as if in search for help, and her woman’s
heart suddenly told her that the changes in the girl’s face, vaguely
apparent to her before, were the badges of grief and unrest.All the
annoyance she had been nursing fled on the instant.Her eyes moistened,
and she laid her hand softly on the other’s arm.“_You_ at least mustn’t think harshly of me,” she said with a smile.“That would be _too_ sad.I would give a great deal if the furnaces
could be opened to-morrow--if they had never been shut.Not even the
girls whose people are out of work feel more deeply about the thing
than I do.But--after all, time must soon set that right.Is there nothing I can do for you?”

An answering moisture came into Jessica’s eyes as she met the other’s
look.She shook her head, and withdrew her wrist from the kindly
pressure of Kate’s hand.“I spoke of you at length with Mr.Tracy,” Kate went on, gently.“_Do_
believe that we are both anxious to do all we can for you, in whatever
form you like.You have never spoken about more money for the Resting
House.If it is, don’t hesitate for a
moment to let me know.And mayn’t I go and see the house, now that I am
here?You know I have never been inside it once since you took it.”

For a second or two Jessica hesitated.It cost her a great deal
to maintain the unfriendly attitude she had taken up, and she was
hopelessly at sea as to why she was paying this price for unalloyed
unhappiness.Yet still she persisted doggedly, and as it were in spite
of herself.“It’s a good deal run down just now,” she said.“Since the trouble came,
Lucinda and I haven’t kept it up.You’d like better to see it some time
when it was in order; that is, if I--if it isn’t given up altogether!”

The despairing intonation of these closing words was not lost upon Kate.“Why do you speak like that?” she said.Oh, I hope it isn’t as bad as that!”

“I’m thinking a good deal of going away.You and Miss Wilcox can put
somebody else here, and keep open the house.My
heart isn’t in it any more.”

The girl forced herself through these words with a mournful effort.The
hot tears came to her eyes before she had finished, and she turned away
abruptly, walking behind the counter to the front of the shop.“There is something you are not
telling me, my child,” she urged with tender earnestness._Let_ me help you!”

“There is nothing--nothing at all,” Jessica made answer.“Only I am not
happy here.And there are--other things--that
were a mistake, too.”

“Why not confide in me, dear?Why not let me help you?”

“How could _you_ help me?” The girl spoke with momentary impatience.“There are things that _money_ can’t help.”

The rich young lady drew herself up instinctively, and tightened the fur
about her neck.The words affected her almost like an affront.“I’m very sorry,” she said, with an obvious cooling of manner.“I did
not mean money alone.I had hoped you felt I was your friend.And I
still want to be, if occasion arises.I shall be very much grieved,
indeed, if you do not let me know, at any and all times, when I can be
of use to you.”

She held out her hand, evidently as an indication that she was going.Jessica saw the hand through a mist of smarting tears, and took it, not
daring to look up.She was filled with longings to kiss this hand, to
cry out for forgiveness, to cast herself upon the soft shelter of this
sweet friendship, so sweetly proffered.But there was some strange spell
which held her back, and, still through the aching film of tears, she
saw the gloved hand withdrawn.A soft “good-by” spread its pathos upon
the silence about her, and then Miss Minster was gone.Jessica stood for a time, looking blankly into the street.Then she
turned and walked with unconscious directness, as in a dream, through
the back rooms and across the yard to the Resting House.She had passed
her stepmother, her sister, and her child without bestowing a glance
upon them, and she wandered now through the silent building aimlessly,
without power to think of what she saw.Although the furniture was
still of the most primitive and unpretentious sort, there were many
little appliances for the comfort of the girls, in which she had had
much innocent delight.The bath-rooms on the upper floor, the willow
rocking-chairs in the sitting-room, the neat row of cups and saucers
in the glassfaced cupboard, the magazines and pattern books on the
table--all these it had given her pleasure to contemplate only a
fortnight ago.She noted that the fire in
the base-burner had gone out, though the reservoir still seemed full of
coal.She was conscious of a vague sense of fitness in its having gone
out.The fire that had burned within her heart was in ashes, too.She
put her apron to her eyes and wept vehemently, here in solitude.Lucinda came out, nearly an hour later, to find her sister sitting
disconsolate by the fireless stove, shivering with the cold, and staring
into vacancy.She put her broad arm with maternal kindness around Jessica’s waist, and
led her unresisting toward the door.“Never mind, sis,” she murmured,
with clumsy sympathy.“Come in and play with Horace.”

Jessica, shuddering again with the chill, buried her face on her
sister’s shoulder, and wept supinely.There was not an atom of courage
remaining in her heart.“You are low down and miserable,” pursued Lucinda, compassionately.“I’ll make you up some boneset tea.It’ll be lucky if you haven’t caught
your death a-cold out here so long.” She had taken a shawl, which hung
in the hallway, and wrapped it about her sister’s shoulders.“I half wish I had,” sobbed Jessica.“There’s no fight left in me any
more.”

“What’s the matter, anyway?”

“If I knew myself,” the girl groaned in answer, “perhaps I could do
something; but I don’t.I can’t think, I can’t eat or sleep or work.what is the matter with me?”




CHAPTER XXXI.--A STRANGE ENCOUNTER.A SOMBRE excitement reigned in Thessaly next day, when it became known
that the French-Cana-dian workmen whom the rolling-mill people were
importing would arrive in the village within the next few hours.They
were coming through from Massachusetts, and watchful eyes at Troy had
noted their temporary halt there and the time of the train they took
westward.The telegraph sped forward the warning, and fully a thousand
idle men in Thessaly gathered about the dépôt, both inside and on the
street without, to witness the unwelcome advent.Some indefinite rumors of the sensation reached the secluded milliner’s
shop on the back street, during the day.Ben Lawton drifted in to warm
himself during the late forenoon, and told of the stirring scenes that
were expected.He was quick to observe that Jessica was not looking
well, and adjured her to be careful about the heavy cold which she said
she had taken.The claims upon him of the excitement outside were too
strong to be resisted, but he promised to look in during the afternoon
and tell them the news.The daylight of the November afternoon was beginning imperceptibly
to wane before any further tidings of the one topic of great public
interest reached the sisters.One of the better class of factory-girls
came in to gossip with Lucinda, and she brought with her a veritable
budget of information.The French Canadians had arrived, and with them
came some Pinkerton detectives, or whatever they were called, who were
said to be armed to the teeth.The crowd had fiercely hooted these
newcomers and their guards, and there had been a good deal of angry
hustling.For awhile it looked as if a fight must ensue; but, somehow,
it did not come off.The Canadians, in a body, had gone with their
escort to the row of new cottages which the company had hired for them,
followed by a diminishing throng of hostile men and boys.There were
numerous personal incidents to relate, and the two sisters listened with
deep interest to the whole recital.When it was finished the girl still sat about, evidently with something
on her mind.At last, with a blunt “Can I speak to you for a moment?”
 she led Jessica out into the shop.There, in a whisper, with repeated
affirmations and much detail, she imparted the confidential portion of
her intelligence.The effect of this information upon Jessica was marked and immediate.As soon as the girl had gone she hastened to the living-room, and began
hurriedly putting on her boots.The effort of stooping to button them
made her feverish head ache, and she was forced to call the amazed
Lucinda to her assistance.“You’re crazy to think of going out such a day as this,” protested the
girl, “and you with such a cold, too.”

“It’s got to be done,” said Jessica, her eyes burning with eagerness,
and her cheeks flushed.“If it killed me, it would have to be done.But
I’ll bundle up warm.I’ll be all right.” Refusing
to listen to further dissuasion she hastily put on her hat and cloak,
and then with nervous rapidity wrote a note, sealed it up tightly with
an envelope, and marked on it, with great plainness, the address: “Miss
Kate Minster.”

“Give this to father when he comes,” she cried, “and tell him--”

Ben Lawton’s appearance at the door interrupted the directions.He was
too excited about the events of the day to be surprised at seeing the
daughter he had left an invalid now dressed for the street; but she
curtly stopped the narrative which he began.“We’ve heard all about it,” she said.“I want you to come with me now.”

Lucinda watched the dominant sister drag on and button her gloves with
apprehension and solicitude written all over her honest face.“Now, do
be careful,” she repeated more than once.As Jessica said “I’m ready now,” and turned to join her father, the
little boy came into the shop through the open door of the living-room.A swift instinct prompted the mother to go to him and stoop to kiss him
on the forehead.The child smiled at her; and when she was out in
the street, walking so hurriedly that her father found the gait
unprecedented in his languid experience, she still dwelt curiously in
her mind upon the sweetness of that infantile smile.And this, by some strange process, suddenly brought clearness and order
to her thoughts.Under the stress of this nervous tension, perhaps
because of the illness which she felt in every bone, yet which seemed to
clarify her senses, her mind was all at once working without confusion.She saw now that what had depressed her, overthrown her self-control,
impelled her to reject the kindness of Miss Minster, had been the
humanization, so to speak, of her ideal, Reuben Tracy.The bare thought
of his marrying and giving in marriage--of his being in love with the
rich girl--this it was that had so strangely disturbed her.Looking at
it now, it was the most foolish thing in the world.What on earth had
she to do with Reuben Tracy?There could never conceivably have entered
her head even the most vagrant and transient notion that he--no, she
would not put _that_ thought into form, even in her own mind.And were
there two young people in all the world who had more claim to her good
wishes than Reuben and Kate?She answered this heartily in the negative,
and said to herself that she truly was glad that they loved each other.She bit her lips, and insisted on repeating this to
her own thoughts.But why, then, had the discovery of this so unnerved her?It must have been because the idea of their
happiness made the isolation of her own life so miserably clear; because
she felt that they had forgotten her and her work in their new-found
concern for each other.She was all over
that weak folly now.She had it in her power to help them, and dim,
half-formed wishes that she might give life itself to their service
flitted across her mind.She had spoken never a word to her father all this while, and had seemed
to take no note either of direction or of what and whom she passed; but
she stopped now in front of the doorway in Main Street which bore the
law-sign of Reuben Tracy.“Wait for me here,” she said to Ben, and
disappeared up the staircase.Jessica made her way with some difficulty up the second flight.Her head
burned with the exertion, and there was a novel numbness in her limbs;
but she gave this only a passing thought.On the panel was tacked a white
half-sheet of paper.It was not easy to decipher the inscription in the
failing light, but she finally made it out to be:

“_Called away until noon to-morrow (Friday)_.”

The girl leaned against the door-sill for support.In the first moment
or two it seemed to her that she was going to swoon.Then resolution
came back to her, and with it a new store of strength, and she went down
the stairs again slowly and in terrible doubt as to what should now be
done.The memory suddenly came to her of the one other time she had been in
this stairway, when she had stood in the darkness with her little boy,
gathered up against the wall to allow the two Minster ladies to pass.Upon the heels of this chased the recollection--with such lack of
sequence do our thoughts follow one another--of the singularly sweet
smile her little boy had bestowed upon her, half an hour since, when she
kissed him.The smile had lingered in her mind as a beautiful picture.Walking down
the stairs now, in the deepening shadows, the revelation dawned upon her
all at once--it was his father’s smile!Yes, yes--hurriedly the fancy
reared itself in her thoughts--thus the lover of her young girlhood had
looked upon her.The delicate, clever face; the prettily arched lips;
the soft, light curls upon the forehead; the tenderly beaming blue
eyes--all were the same.very often--this resemblance had forced itself upon her
consciousness before.But now, lighted up by that chance babyish smile,
it came to her in the guise of a novelty, and with a certain fascination
in it.Her head seemed to have ceased to ache, now that this almost
pleasant thought had entered it.It was passing strange, she felt, that
any sense of comfort should exist for her in memories which had fed
her soul upon bitterness for so long a time.Yet it was already on the
instant apparent to her that when she should next have time to think,
that old episode would assume less hateful aspects than it had always
presented before.At the street door she found her father leaning against a shutter and
discussing the events of the day with the village lamplighter, who
carried a ladder on his shoulder, and reported great popular agitation
to exist.Jessica beckoned Ben summarily aside, and put into his hands the letter
she had written at the shop.“I want you to take this at once to Miss
Minster, at her house,” she said, hurriedly.“See to it that she gets it
herself.Don’t say a word to any living
soul.I’ve said you can be depended
upon.If you show yourself a man, it may make your fortune.Now, hurry;
and I do hope you will do me credit!”

Under the spur of this surprising exhortation, Ben walked away with
unexampled rapidity, until he had overtaken the lamplighter, from whom
he borrowed some chewing tobacco.The girl, left to herself, began walking irresolutely down Main Street.The flaring lights in the store windows seemed to add to the confusion
of her mind.It had appeared to be important to send her father away at
once, but now she began to regret that she had not kept him to help her
in her search.For Reuben Tracy must be found at all hazards.How to go to work to trace him she did not know.She had no notion
whatever as to who his intimate friends were.The best device she could
think of would be to ask about him at the various law-offices; for she
had heard that however much lawyers might pretend to fight one another
in court, they were all on very good terms outside.Some little distance down the street she came upon the door of another
stairway which bore a number of lawyers’ signs.The windows all up the
front of this building were lighted, and without further examination she
ascended the first flight of stairs.The landing was almost completely
dark, but an obscured gleam came from the dusty transoms over three or
four doors close about her.She knocked on one of these at random, and
in response to an inarticulate vocal sound from within, opened the door
and entered.It was a square, medium-sized room in which she found herself, with
a long, paper-littered table in the centre, and tall columns of light
leather-covered books rising along the walls.At the opposite end of the
chamber a man sat at a desk, his back turned to her, his elbows on the
desk, and his head in his hands.The shaded light in front of him made a
mellow golden fringe around the outline of his hair.A sudden bewildering tumult burst forth in the girl’s breast as she
looked at this figure.Then, as suddenly, the recurring mental echoes of
the voice which had bidden her enter rose above this tumult and stilled
it.A gentle and comforting warmth stole through her veins.This was
Horace Boyce who sat there before her--and she did not hate him!During that instant in which she stood by the door, a whole flood of
self-illumination flashed its rays into every recess of her mind.This,
then, was the strange, formless opposing impulse which had warred with
the other in her heart for this last miserable fortnight, and dragged
her nearly to distraction.The bringing home of her boy had revived for her, by occult and subtle
processes, the old romance in which his father had been framed, as might
a hero be by sunlit clouds.She hugged the thought to her heart, and
stood looking at’ him motionless and mute.What is wanted?” he called out, querulously, without
changing his posture.It was as if a magic voice drew her
forward in a dream--herself all rapt and dumb.Irritably impressed by the continued silence, Horace lifted his head,
and swung abruptly around in his chair.His own shadow obscured the
features of his visitor.He saw only that it was a lady, and rose
hesitatingly to his feet.“Excuse me,” he mumbled, “I was busy with my thoughts, and did not know
who it was.”

“Do you know now?” Jessica heard herself ask, as in a trance.The balmy
warmth in her own heart told her that she was smiling.Horace took a step or two obliquely forward, so that the light fell on
her face.He peered with a confounded gaze at her for a moment, then let
his arms fall limp at his sides.“In the name of the dev--” he began, confusedly, and then bit the word
short, and stared at her again.“Is it really you?” he asked at last,
reassured in part by her smile.“Are you sorry to see me?” she asked in turn.Her mind could frame
nothing but these soft little meaningless queries.The young man seemed in doubt how best to answer this question.He
turned around and looked abstractedly at his desk; then with a slight
detour he walked past her, opened the door, and glanced up and down the
dark stairway.When he had closed the door once more, he turned the key
in the lock, and then, after momentary reflection, concluded to unlock
it again.“Why, no; why should I be?” he said in a more natural voice, as he
returned and stood beside her.Evidently her amiability was a more
difficult surprise for him to master than her original advent, and he
studied her face with increasing directness of gaze to make sure of it.“Come and sit down here,” he said, after a few moments of this puzzled
inspection, and resumed his own chair.“I want a good look at you,” he
explained, as he lifted the shade from the lamp.Jessica felt that she was blushing under this new radiance, and it
required an effort to return his glance.But, when she did so, the
changes in his face and expression which it revealed drove everything
else from her mind.She rose from her chair upon a sudden impulse,
and bent over him at a diffident distance.As she did so, she had the
feeling that this bitterness in which she had encased herself for years
had dropped from her on the instant like a discarded garment.“Why, Horace, your hair is quite gray!” she said, as if the fact
contained the sublimation of pathos.“There’s been trouble enough to turn it white twenty times over!You
don’t know what I’ve been through, my girl,” he said, sadly.The
novel sensation of being sympathized with, welcome as it was, greatly
accentuated his sense of deserving compassion.“I am very sorry,” she said, softly.She had seated herself again, and
was gradually recovering her self-possession.The whole situation was
so remarkable, not to say startling, that she found herself regarding it
from the outside, as if she were not a component part of it.Her pulses
were no longer strongly stirred by its personal phases.Most clear of
all things in her mind was that she was now perfectly independent of
this or any other man.She was her own master, and need ask favors from
nobody.Therefore, if it pleased her to call bygones bygones and make a
friend of Horace--or even to put a bandage across her eyes and cull from
those bygones only the rose leaves and violet blossoms, and make for her
weary soul a bed of these--what or who was to prevent her?Some inexplicable, unforeseen revulsion of feeling had made him pleasant
in her sight again.There was no doubt about it--she had genuine
satisfaction in sitting here opposite him and looking at him.Had she
so many pleasures, then, that she should throw this unlooked-for boon
deliberately away?Moreover--and here the new voices called most loudly in her heart--he
was worn and unhappy.The iron had palpably entered his soul too.He
looked years older than he had any chronological right to look.There
were heavy lines of anxiety on his face, and his blonde hair was
powdered thick with silver.“Yes, I am truly sorry,” she said again.“Is it business that has gone
wrong with you?”

“Business--family--health--sleep--everything!” he groaned, bitterly.“It
is literally a hell that I have been living in this last--these last few
months!”

“I had no idea of that,” she said, simply.Of course it would be
ridiculous to ask if there was anything she could do, but she had
comfort from the thought that he must realize what was in her mind.“So help me God, Jess!” he burst out vehemently, under the incentive of
her sympathy, “I’m coming to believe that every man is a scoundrel, and
every woman a fool!”

“There was a long time when _I_ thought that,” she said with a sigh.He looked quickly at her from under his brows, and then as swiftly
turned his glance away.“Yes, I know,” he answered uneasily, tapping
with his fingers on the desk.“But we won’t talk of that,” she urged, with a little tremor of anxiety
in her tone.“We needn’t talk of that at all.John travelled to the bedroom.It was merely by accident
that I came here, Horace.I wanted to ask a question, and nothing was
further from my head than finding you here.”

“Let’s see--Mart Jocelyn had this place up to a couple of months ago.I didn’t know you knew him.”

“No, you foolish boy!” she said, with a smile which had a ground tone
of sadness.It was simply any lawyer I was
looking for.But what I wanted to say was that I am not angry with you
any more.I’ve learned a host of bitter lessons since we were--young
together, and I’m too much alone in the world to want to keep you an
enemy.You don’t seem so very happy yourself, Horace.Why shouldn’t
we two be friends again?I’m not talking of anything else,
Horace--understand me.But it appeals to me very strongly, this idea of
our being friends again.”

Horace looked meditatively at her, with softening eyes.“You’re the best
of the lot, dear old Jess,” he said at last, smiling candidly.“Truly
I’m glad you came--gladder than I can tell you.I was in the very slough
of despond when you entered; and now--well, at least I’m going to play
that I am out of it.”

Jessica rose with a beaming countenance, and laid her hand frankly on
his shoulder.“I’m glad I came, too,” she said.“And very soon I want to
see you again--when you are quite free--and have a long, quiet talk.”

“All right, my girl,” he answered, rising as well.The prospect seemed
entirely attractive to him.He took her hand in his, and said again:
“All right.And must you go now?”

“Oh, mercy, yes!” she exclaimed, with sudden recollection.“I had no
business to stay so long!Perhaps you can tell me--or no--” She vaguely
put together in her mind the facts that Tracy and Horace had been
partners, and seemed to be so no longer.“No, you wouldn’t know.”

“Have I so poor a legal reputation as all that?” he said, lightly
smiling.One’s friends, at least, ought to dissemble their
bad opinions.”

“No, it wasn’t about law,” she explained, stum-blingly.“It’s of no
importance.Good-by for the time.”

He would have drawn her to him and kissed her at this, but she gently
prevented the caress, and released herself from his hands.“Not that,” she said, with a smile in which still some sadness lingered.And--good-by, Horace, for the
time.”

He went with her to the door, lighting the hall gas that she might
see her way down the stairs.When she had disappeared, he walked for
a little up and down the room, whistling softly to himself.It was
undeniable that the world seemed vastly brighter to him than it had only
a half-hour before.Mere contact with somebody who liked him for himself
was a refreshing novelty.“A damned decent sort of girl--considering everything!” he mused aloud,
as he locked up his desk for the day.CHAPTER XXXII.--THE ALARM AT THE FARMHOUSE.To come upon the street again was like the confused awakening from a
dream.With the first few steps Jessica found herself shivering in an
extremity of cold, yet still uncomfortably warm.A sudden passing spasm
of giddiness, too, made her head swim so that for the instant she feared
to fall.Then, with an added sense of weakness, she went on, wearily and
desponding.The recollection of this novel and curious happiness upon which she
had stumbled only a few moments before took on now the character of
self-reproach.The burning headache had returned, and with it came a
pained consciousness that it had been little less than criminal in
her to weakly dally in Horace’s office when such urgent responsibility
rested upon her outside.If the burden of this responsibility appeared
too great for her to bear, now that her strength seemed to be so
strangely leaving her, there was all the more reason for her to set her
teeth together, and press forward, even if she staggered as she went.The search had been made cruelly
hopeless by that shameful delay; and she blamed herself with fierceness
for it, as she racked her brain for some new plan, wondering whether she
ought to have asked Horace or gone into some of the other offices.There were groups of men standing here and there on the comers--a little
away from the full light of the street-lamps, as if unwilling to court
observation.These knots of workmen had a sinister significance to her
feverish mind.She had the clew to the terrible mischief which some of
them intended--which no doubt even now they were canvassing in furtive
whispers--and only Tracy could stop it, and she was powerless to find
him!There came slouching along the sidewalk, as she grappled with this
anguish of irresolution, a slight and shabby figure which somehow
arrested her attention.It was a familiar enough figure--that of old
“Cal” Gedney; and there was nothing unusual or worthy of comment in
the fact that he was walking unsteadily by himself, with his gaze fixed
intently on the sidewalk.He had passed again out of the range of her
cursory glance before she suddenly remembered that he was a lawyer, and
even some kind of a judge.She turned swiftly and almost ran after him, clutching his sleeve as she
came up to him, and breathing so hard with weakness and excitement that
for the moment she could not speak.The ’squire looked up, and angrily shook his arm out of her grasp.“Leave me alone, you hussy,” he snarled, “or I’ll lock you up!”

His misconstruction of her purpose cleared her mind.“Don’t be foolish,”
 she said, hurriedly.“It’s a question of perhaps life and death!Do you
know where Reuben Tracy is?Or can you tell me where I can find out?”

“He don’t want to be bothered with _you_, wherever he is,” was the surly
response.“Be off with you!”

“I told you it was a matter of life and death,” she insisted, earnestly.“He’ll never forgive you--you’ll never forgive yourself--if you know and
won’t tell me.”

The sincerity of the girl’s tone impressed the old man.It was not easy
for him to stand erect and unaided without swaying, but his mind was
evidently clear enough.“What do you want with him?” he asked, in a less unfriendly voice.Then
he added, in a reflective undertone: “Cur’ous’t I sh’d want see Tracy,
too.”

“Then you do know where he is?”

“He’s drove out to ’s mother’s farm.Seems word come old woman’s sick.You’re one of that Lawton tribe, aren’t you?”

“If I get a cutter, will you drive out there with me?” She asked the
question with swift directness.She added in explanation, as he stared
vacantly at her: “I ask that because you said you wanted to see him,
that’s all.I shall go alone if you won’t come.He’s _got_ to be back
here this evening, or God only knows what’ll happen!I mean what I say!”

“Do you know the road?” the ’squire asked, catching something of her
own eager spirit.I was bom half a mile from where his mother lives.”

“But you won’t tell me what your business is?”

“I’ll tell you this much,” she whispered, hastily.“There is going to
be a mob at the Minster house to-night.A girl who knows one of the men
told--”

The old ’squire cut short the revelation by grasping her arm with
fierce energy.“Come on--come on!” he said, hoarsely.“Don’t waste a minute.We’ll gallop the horses both ways.” He muttered to himself with
excitement as he dragged her along.Jessica waited outside the livery stable for what seemed an interminable
period, while old “Cal” was getting the horses--walking up and down the
path in a state of mental torment which precluded all sense of bodily
suffering.When she conjured up before her frightened mind the
terrible consequences which delay might entail, every minute became an
intolerable hour of torture.There was even the evil chance that the old
man had been refused the horses because he had been drinking.Finally, however, there came the welcome sound of mailed hoofs on the
plank roadway inside, and the reverberating jingle of bells; and then
the ’squire, with a spacious double-seated sleigh containing plenty of
robes, drew up in front of a cutting in the snow.She took the front seat without hesitation, and gathered the lines into
her own hands.“Let me drive,” she said, clucking the horses into a
rapid trot.“I _should_ be home in bed.I’m too ill to sit up, unless
I’m doing something that keeps me from giving up.”

*****

Reuben Tracy felt the evening in the sitting-room of the old farmhouse
to be the most trying ordeal of his adult life.Ordinarily he rather enjoyed than otherwise the company of his brother
Ezra--a large, powerfully built, heavily bearded man, who sat now beside
him in a rocking-chair in front of the wood stove, his stockinged feet
on the hearth, and a last week’s agricultural paper on his knee.Ezra
was a worthy and hard-working citizen, with an original way of looking
at things, and considerable powers of expression.As a rule, the
lawyer liked to talk with him, and felt that he profited in ideas and
suggestions from the talk.But to-night he found his brother insufferably dull, and the task of
keeping down the “fidgets” one of incredible difficulty.His mother--on
whose account he had been summoned--was so much better that Ezra’s wife
had felt warranted in herself going off to bed, to get some much-needed
rest.Ezra had argued for a while, rather perversely, about the tariff
duty on wool, and now was nodding in his chair, although the dim-faced
old wooden clock showed it to be barely eight o’clock.The kerosene lamp
on the table gave forth only a feeble, reddened light through its smoky
chimney, but diffused a most powerful odor upon the stuffy air of the
over-heated room.A ragged and strong-smelling old farm dog groaned
offensively from time to time in his sleep behind the stove.Even the
draught which roared through the lower apertures in front of the stove
and up the pipe toward the chimney was irritating by the very futility
of its vehemence, for the place was too hot already.Reuben mused in silence upon the chances which had led him so far
away from this drowsy, unfruitful life, and smiled as he found himself
wondering if it would be in the least possible for him to return to it.The bright boys, the restless boys, the boys
of energy, of ambition, of yearning for culture or conquest or the mere
sensation of living where it was really life--all went away, leaving
none but the Ezras behind.Some succeeded; some failed; but none of them
ever came back.And the Ezras who remained on the farms--they seemed to
shut and bolt the doors of their minds against all idea of making their
own lot less sterile and barren and uninviting.The mere mental necessity for a great contrast brought up suddenly
in Reuben’s thoughts a picture of the drawing-room in the home of the
Minsters.It seemed as if the whole vast swing of the mind’s pendulum
separated that luxurious abode of cultured wealth from this dingy and
barren farmhouse room.And he, who had been born and reared in this
latter, now found himself at a loss how to spend so much as a single
evening in its environment, so completely had familiarity with the other
remoulded and changed his habits, his point of view, his very character.Curious slaves of habit--creatures of their surroundings--men were!A loud, peremptory knocking at the door aroused Reuben abruptly from his
revery, and Ezra, too, opened his eyes with a start, and sitting upright
rubbed them confusedly.“Now I think of it, I heard a sleigh stop,” said Reuben, rising.“It
can’t be the doctor this time of night, can it?”

“It ’ud be jest like him,” commented Ezra, captiously.“He’s a great
hand to keep dropping in, sort of casual-like, when there’s sickness in
the house.It all goes down in his bill.”

The farmer brother had also risen, and now, lamp in hand, walked
heavily in his stocking feet to the door, and opened it half way.Some
indistinct words passed, and then, shading the flickering flame with his
huge hairy hand, Ezra turned his head.“Somebody to see you, Rube,” he said.On second thought he added to the
visitor in a tone of formal politeness: “Won’t you step in, ma’am?”

Jessica Lawton almost pushed her host aside in her impulsive response to
his invitation.But when she had crossed the threshold the sudden change
into a heated atmosphere seemed to go to her brain like chloroform.She
stood silent, staring at Reuben, with parted lips and hands nervously
twitching.Even as he, in his complete surprise, recognized his visitor,
she trembled violently from head to foot, made a forward step, tottered,
and fell inertly into Ezra’s big, protecting arm.“I guessed she was going to do it,” said the farmer, not dissembling his
pride at the alert way in which the strange woman had been caught, and
holding up the lamp with his other hand in triumph.“Hannah keeled over
in that same identical way when Suky run her finger through the cogs of
the wringing-machine, and I ketched her, too!”

Reuben had hurriedly come to his brother’s assistance.The two men
placed the fainting girl in the rocking-chair, and the lawyer began
with anxious fumbling to loosen the neck of her cloak and draw off her
gloves.Her fingers were like ice, and her brow, though it felt now
almost equally cold, was covered with perspiration.Reuben rubbed her
hands between his broad palms in a crudely informed belief that it was
the right thing to do, while Ezra rummaged in the adjoining pantry for
the household bottle of brandy.Jessica came out of her swoon with the first touch of the pungent spirit
upon her whitened lips.She looked with weak blankness at the unfamiliar
scene about her, until her gaze fell upon the face of the lawyer.Then
she smiled faintly and closed her eyes again.“She is an old friend of mine,” whispered Reuben to his brother, as he
pressed the brandy once more upon her.“She’ll come to in a minute.It
must be something serious that brought her out here.”

The girl languidly opened her eyes.“‘Cal’ Ged-ney’s asleep in the
sleigh,” she murmured.“You’d better bring him in.He’ll tell you.”

It was with an obvious effort that she said this much; and now, while
Ezra hastily pulled on his boots, her eyes closed again, and her
head sank with utter weariness sideways upon the high back of the
old-fashioned chair.Reuben stood looking at her in pained anxiety--once or twice holding
the lamp close to her pale face, in dread of he knew not what--until
his brother returned.Ezra had brought the horses up into the yard, and
remained outside now to blanket them, while the old ’squire, benumbed
and drowsy, found his way into the house.It was evident enough to the
young lawyer’s first glance that Gedney had been drinking heavily.“Well, what does this all mean?” he demanded, with vexed asperity.“You’ve got to get on your things and race back with us, helly-to-hoot!”
 said the ’squire.“Quick--there ain’t a minute to lose!” The old man
almost gasped in his eagerness.“In Heaven’s name, what’s up?Have you been to Cadmus?”

“Yes, and got my pocket full of affidavits.We can send all three of
them to prison fast enough.But that’ll do to-morrow; for to-night
there’s a mob up at the Minster place._Look there!_”

The old man had gone to the window and swept the stiff curtain aside.He
held it now with a trembling hand, so that Reuben could look out.The whole southern sky overhanging Thessaly was crimson with the
reflection of a fire.it’s the rolling mill,” ejaculated Reuben, breathlessly.“Quite as likely it’s the Minster house; it’s the same direction, only
farther off, and fires are deceptive,” said Gedney, his excitement
rising under the stimulus of the spectacle.Reuben had kicked off his slippers, and was now dragging on his shoes.“Tell me about it,” he said, working furiously at the laces.’Squire Gedney helped himself generously to the brandy on the table as
he unfolded, in somewhat incoherent fashion, his narrative.The Lawton
girl had somehow found out that a hostile demonstration against the
Minsters was intended for the evening, and had started out to find
Tracy.By accident she had met him (Gedney), and they had come off in
the sleigh together.She had insisted upon driving, and as his long
journey from Cadmus had greatly fatigued him, he had got over into the
back seat and gone to sleep under the buffalo robes.He knew nothing
more until Ezra had roused him from his slumber in the sled, now at a
standstill on the road outside, and he had awakened to discover Jessica
gone, the horses wet and shivering in a cloud of steam, and the sky
behind them all ablaze.Looks as if the whole town was burning,” said Ezra,
coming in as this recital was concluded.“Them horses would a-got their
death out there in another ten minutes.Guess I’d better put ’em in
the barn, eh?”

“No, no!I’ve got to drive them back faster than
they came,” said Reuben, who had on his overcoat and hat.“Hurry, and
get me some thick gloves to drive in.We
won’t wake mother up.I’ll get you to run in to-morrow, if you will, and
let me know how she is.Tell her I _had_ to go.”

When Ezra had found the gloves and brought them, the two men for the
first time bent an instinctive joint glance at the recumbent figure of
the girl in the rocking-chair.“I’ll get Hannah up,” said the farmer, “and she can have your room.I
guess she’s too sick to try to go back with you.If she’s well enough,
I’ll bring her in in the morning.I was going to take in some apples,
anyway.”

To their surprise Jessica opened her eyes and even lifted her head at
these words.“No,” she said; “I feel better now--much better.I really must.” She rose to her feet as she spoke, and, though
she was conscious of great dizziness and languor, succeeded by her smile
in imposing upon her unskilled companions.Perhaps if Hannah had been
“got up” she would have seen through the weak pretence of strength, and
insisted on having matters ordered otherwise.But the men offered no
dissent.Jessica was persuaded to drink another glass of brandy, and
’Squire Gedney took one without being specially urged; and then Reuben
impatiently led the way out to the sleigh, which Ezra had turned around.“No; I’d rather be in front with you,” the girl said, when Reuben had
spread the robes for her to sit in the back seat.“Let the Judge sit
there; he wants to sleep.I’m not tired now, and I want to keep awake.”

Thus it was arranged, and Reuben, with a strong hand on the tight reins,
started the horses on their homeward rush toward the flaming horizon.CHAPTER XXXIII.--PACING TOWARD THE REDDENED SKY.For some time there was no conversation in the sleigh.The horses sped
evenly forward, with their heads well in the air, as if they too were
excited by the unnatural glare in the sky ahead.Before long there was
added to the hurried regular beating of their hoofs upon the hard-packed
track another sound--the snoring of the ’squire on the seat behind.There was a sense of melting in the air.Save where the intense glow
of the conflagration lit up the sky with a fan-like spread of ruddy
luminance--fierce orange at the central base, and then through an
expanse of vermilion, rose, and cherry to deepening crimsons and dull
reddish purples--the heavens hung black with snow-laden clouds.A
pleasant, moist night-breeze came softly across the valley, bearing ever
and again a solitary flake of snow.The effect of this mild wind was so
grateful to Jessica’s face, now once more burning with an inner heat,
that she gave no thought to a curious difficulty in breathing which was
growing upon her.“The scoundrels shall pay dear for this,” Reuben said to her, between
set teeth, when there came a place in the road where the horses must be
allowed to walk up hill.“I’m sure I hope so,” she said, quite in his spirit.The husky note in her voice caught his attention.“Are you sure you
are bundled up warm enough?” he asked with solicitude, pulling the robe
higher about her.I caught a heavy cold yesterday,” she
answered.“But it will be nothing, if only we can get there in time.”

It struck her as strange when Reuben presently replied, putting the whip
once more to the horses: “God only knows what can be done when I do
get there!” It had seemed to her a matter of course that Tracy would be
equal to any emergency--even an armed riot.There was something almost
disheartening in this confession of self-doubt.“But at any rate they shall pay for it to-morrow,” he broke out,
angrily, a moment later.“Down to the last pennyweight we will have our
pound of flesh!My girl,” he added, turning to look into her face, and
speaking with deep earnestness, “I never knew what it was before to feel
wholly merciless--absolutely without bowels of compassion.But I will
not abate so much as the fraction of a hair with these villains.I swear
that!”

By an odd contradiction, his words raised a vague spirit of compunction
within her.“They feel very bitterly,” she ventured to suggest.“It is
terrible to be turned out of work in the winter, and with families
dependent on that work for bare existence.And then the bringing in of
these strange workmen.I suppose that is what--”

Reuben interrupted her with an abrupt laugh.“I’m not thinking of them,”
 he said.“Poor foolish fellows, I don’t wish them any harm.I only
pray God they haven’t done too much harm to themselves.No: it’s the
swindling scoundrels who are responsible for the mischief--_they_ are
the ones I’ll put the clamps onto to-morrow.”

The words conveyed no meaning to her, and she kept silent until he spoke
further: “I don’t know whether he told you, but Gedney has brought me
to-night the last links needed for a chain of proof which must send all
three of these ruffians to State prison.I haven’t had time to
examine the papers yet, but he says he’s got them in his pocket
there--affidavits from the original inventor of certain machinery, about
its original sale, and from others who were a party to it--which makes
the whole fraud absolutely clear.I’ll go over them to-night, when we’ve
seen this thing through”--pointing vaguely with his whip toward the
reddened sky--“and if tomorrow I don’t lay all three of them by the
heels, you can have my head for a foot-ball!”

“I don’t understand these things very well,” said Jessica.“Who is it
you mean?” It was growing still harder for her to breathe, and sharp
pain came in her breast now with almost every respiration.Her head
ached, too, so violently that she cared very little indeed who it was
that should go to prison tomorrow.“There are three of them in the scheme,” said the lawyer; “as
cold-blooded and deliberate a piece of robbery as ever was planned.First, there’s a New York man named Wendover--they call him a Judge--a
smart, subtle, slippery scoundrel if ever there was one.Then there’s
Schuyler Tenney--perhaps you know who he is--he’s a big hardware
merchant here; and with him in the swindle was--Good heavens!Why, I
never thought of it before!”

Reuben had stopped short in his surprise.He began whipping the horses
now with a seeming air of exultation, and stole a momentary smile-lit
glance toward his companion.“It’s just occurred to me,” he said.“Curious--I hadn’t given it a
thought.Why, my girl, it’s like a special providence.You, too, will
have your full revenge--such revenge as you never dreamt of.The third
man is Horace Boyce!”

A great wave of cold stupor engulfed the girl’s reason as she took in
these words, and her head swam and roared as if in truth she had been
plunged headlong into unknown depths of icy water.When she came to the surface of consciousness again, the horses were
still rhythmically racing along the hill-side road overlooking the
village.The firelight in the sky had faded down now to a dull pinkish
effect like the northern lights.Reuben was chewing an unlighted cigar,
and the ’squire was steadily snoring behind them.“You will send them all to prison--surely?” she was able to ask.“As surely as God made little apples!” was the sententious response.The girl was cowering under the buffalo-robe in an anguish of mind so
terribly intense that her physical pains were all forgotten.Only her
throbbing head seemed full of thick blood, and there was such an
awful need that she should think clearly!She bit her lips in tortured
silence, striving through a myriad of wandering, crowding ideas to lay
hold upon something which should be of help.They had begun to descend the hill--a steep, uneven road full of drifts,
beyond which stretched a level mile of highway leading into the village
itself--when suddenly a bold thought came to her, which on the instant
had shot up, powerful and commanding, into a very tower of resolution.She laid her hand on Reuben’s arm.“If you don’t mind, I’ll change into the back seat,” she said, in a
voice which all her efforts could not keep from shaking.“I’m feeling
very ill.It’ll be easier for me there.”

Reuben at once drew up the horses, and the girl, summoning all her
strength, managed without his help to get around the side of the sleigh,
and under the robe, into the rear seat.The ’squire was sunk in such a
profound sleep that she had to push him bodily over into his own half of
the space, and the discovery that this did not waken him filled her
with so great a delight that all her strength and self-control seemed
miraculously to have returned to her.She had need of them both for the task which she had imposed upon
herself, and which now, with infinite caution and trepidation, she set
herself about.This was nothing less than to secure the papers which
the old ’squire had brought from Cadmus, and which, from something she
remembered his having said, must be in the inner pocket of one of his
coats.Slowly and deftly she opened button after button of his overcoat,
and gently pushed aside the cloth until her hand might have free
passage to and from the pocket, where, after careful soundings, she had
discovered a bundle of thick papers to be resting.Then whole minutes
seemed to pass before, having taken off her glove, she was able to draw
this packet out.Once during this operation Reuben half turned to speak
to her, and her fright was very great.But she had had the presence of
mind to draw the robe high about her, and answer collectedly, and he had
palpably suspected nothing.As for Gedney, he never once stirred in his
drunken sleep.The larceny was complete, and Jessica had been able to wrap the old man
up again, to button the parcel of papers under her own cloak, and to
draw on and fasten her glove once more, before the panting horses had
gained the outskirts of the village.She herself was breathing almost
as heavily as the animals after their gallop, and, now that the deed was
done, lay back wearily in her seat, with pain racking her every joint
and muscle, and a sickening dread in her mind lest there should be
neither strength nor courage forthcoming for what remained to do.For a considerable distance down the street no person was visible from
whom the eager Tracy could get news of what had happened.At last,
however, when the sleigh was within a couple of blocks of what seemed
in the distance to be a centre of interest, a man came along who shouted
from the sidewalk, in response to Reuben’s questions, sundry leading
facts of importance.A fire had started--probably incendiary--in the basement of the office
of the Minster furnaces, some hour or so ago, and had pretty well gutted
the building.The firemen were still playing on the ruins.An immense
crowd had witnessed the fire, and it was the drunkenest crowd he had
ever seen in Thessaly.Where the money came from to buy so much drink,
was what puzzled him.The crowd had pretty well cleared off now; some
said they had gone up to the Minster house to give its occupants a
“horning.” He himself had got his feet wet, and was afraid of the
rheumatics if he stayed out any longer.Probably he would get them, as
it was.Everybody said that the building was insured, and some folks
hinted that the company had it set on fire themselves.Reuben impatiently whipped up the jaded team at this, with a curt “Much
obliged,” and drove at a spanking pace down the street to the scene of
the conflagration.The outer walls
of the office building were still gloomily erect, but within nothing
was left but a glowing mass of embers about level with the ground.Some firemen were inside the yard, but more were congregated about the
water-soaked space where the engine still noisily throbbed, and where
hot coffee was being passed around to them.Here, too, there was a
report that the crowd had gone up to the Minster house.The horses tugged vehemently to drag the sleigh over the impedimenta of
hose stretched along the street, and over the considerable area of bare
stones where the snow had been melted by the heat or washed away by the
streams from the hydrants.Then Reuben half rose in his seat to lash
them into a last furious gallop, and, snorting with rebellion, they tore
onward toward the seminary road.At the corner, three doors from the home of the Minster ladies, Reuben
deemed it prudent to draw up.There was evidently a considerable throng
in the road in front of the house, and that still others were on the
lawn within the gates was obvious from the confused murmur which came
therefrom.Some boys were blowing spasmodically on fish-horns, and
rough jeers and loud boisterous talk rose and fell throughout the dimly
visible assemblage.The air had become thick with large wet snowflakes.Reuben sprang from the sleigh, and, stepping backward, vigorously shook
old Gedney into a state of semi-wakefulness.“Hold these lines,” he said, “and wait here for me.--Or,” he turned to
Jessica with the sudden thought, “would you rather he drove you home?”

The girl had been in a half-insensible condition of mind and body.At
the question she roused herself and shook her head.“No: let me stay
here,” she said, wearily.But when Reuben, squaring his broad shoulders and shaking himself to
free his muscles after the long ride, had disappeared with an energetic
stride in the direction of the crowd, Jessica forced herself to sit
upright, and then to rise to her feet.“You’d better put the blankets on the horses, if he doesn’t come back
right off,” she said to the ’squire.“Where are you going?” Gedney asked, still stupid with sleep.“I’ll walk up and down,” she answered, clambering with difficulty out of
the sleigh.“I’m tired of sitting still.”

Once on the sidewalk, she grew suddenly faint, and grasped a
fence-picket for support.The hand which she instinctively raised to her
heart touched the hard surface of the packet of papers, and the thought
which this inspired put new courage into her veins.With bowed head and a hurried, faltering step, she turned her back upon
the Minster house and stole off into the snowy darkness.CHAPTER XXXIV.--THE CONQUEST OF THE MOB.Even before he reached the gates of the carriage-drive opening upon
the Minster lawn, Reuben Tracy encountered some men whom he knew, and
gathered that the people in the street outside were in the main peaceful
on-lookers, who did not understand very clearly what was going on, and
disapproved of the proceedings as far as they comprehended them.There
was a crowd inside the grounds, he was told, made up in part of men who
were out of work, but composed still more largely, it seemed, of boys
and young hoodlums generally, who were improving the pretext to indulge
in horseplay.There was a report that some sort of deputation had gone
up on the doorstep and rung the bell, with a view to making some remarks
to the occupants of the house; but that they had failed to get any
answer, and certainly the whole front of the residence was black as
night.Reuben easily obtained the consent of several of these citizens to
follow him, and, as they went on, the number swelled to ten or a dozen.Doubtless many more could have been incorporated in the impromptu
procession had it not been so hopelessly dark.The lawyer led his friends through the gate, and began pushing his
way up the gravelled path through the crowd.No special opposition was
offered to his progress, for the air was so full of snow now that only
those immediately affected knew anything about it.Although the path
was fairly thronged, nobody seemed to have any idea why he was standing
there.Those who spoke appeared in the main to regard the matter as a
joke, the point of which was growing more and more obscure.Except for
some sporadic horn-blowing and hooting nearer to the house, the activity
of the assemblage was confined to a handful of boys, who mustered
among them two or three kerosene oil torches treasured from the last
Presidential campaign, and a grotesque jack-o’-lantem made of a pumpkin
and elevated on a broom-stick.These urchins were running about among
the little groups of bystanders, knocking off one another’s caps,
shouting prodigiously, and having a good time.As Reuben and those accompanying him approached the house, some of
these lads raised the cry of “Here’s the coppers!” and the crowd at
this seemed to close up with a simultaneous movement, while a murmur ran
across its surface like the wind over a field of corn.This sound was
one less of menace or even excitement than of gratification that at last
something was going to happen.One of the boys with a torch, in the true spirit of his generation,
placed himself in front of Reuben and marched with mock gravity at the
head of the advancing group.This, drolly enough, lent the movement a
semblance of authority, or at least of significance, before which the
men more readily than ever gave way.At this the other boys with
the torches and jack-o’-lantem fell into line at the rear of Tracy’s
immediate supporters, and they in turn were followed by the throng
generally.Thus whimsically escorted, Reuben reached the front steps of
the mansion.A more compact and apparently homogeneous cluster of men stood here,
some of them even on the steps, and dark and indistinct as everything
was, Reuben leaped to the conclusion that these were the men at least
visibly responsible for this strange gathering.Presumably they were
taken by surprise at his appearance with such a following.At any
rate, they, too, offered no concerted resistance, and he mounted to the
platform of the steps without difficulty.Then he turned and whispered
to a friend to have the boys with the torches also come up.This was
a suggestion gladly obeyed, not least of all by the boy with the
low-comedy pumpkin, whose illumination created a good-natured laugh.Tracy stood now, bareheaded in the falling snow, facing the throng.The
gathering of the lights about him indicated to everybody in the grounds
that the aimless demonstration had finally assumed some kind of form.Then there were
admonitory shouts here and there, under the influence of which the
horn-blowing gradually ceased, and Tracy’s name was passed from mouth to
mouth until its mention took on almost the character of a personal cheer
on the outskirts of the crowd.In answer to this two or three hostile
interrogations or comments were bawled out, but the throng did not favor
these, and so there fell a silence which invited Reuben to speak.“My friends,” he began, and then stopped because he had not pitched his
voice high enough, and a whole semicircle of cries of “louder!” rose
from the darkness of the central lawn.“He’s afraid of waking the fine ladies,” called out an anonymous voice.“Shut up, Tracy, and let the pumpkin talk,” was another shout.“Begorrah, it’s the pumpkin that _is_ talkin’ now!” cried a shrill third
voice, and at this there was a ripple of laughter.“My friends,” began Reuben, in a louder tone, this time without
immediate interruption, “although I don’t know precisely why you have
gathered here at so much discomfort to yourselves, I have some things to
say to you which I think you will regard as important.I have not seen
the persons who live in this house since Tuesday, but while I can easily
understand that your coming here to-night might otherwise cause them
some anxiety, I am sure that they, when they come to understand it,
will be as glad as I am that you _are_ here, and that I am given this
opportunity of speaking for them to you.If you had not taken this
notion of coming here tonight, I should have, in a day or two, asked you
to meet me somewhere else, in a more convenient place, to talk matters
over.“First of all let me tell you that the works are going to be opened
promptly, certainly the furnaces, and unless I am very much mistaken
about the law, the rolling mills too.I give you my word for that, as
the legal representative of two of these women.”

“Yes; they’ll be opened with the Frenchmen!” came a swift answering
shout.“Or will you get Chinamen?” cried another, amid derisive laughter.Reuben responded in his clearest tones: “No man who belongs to Thessaly
shall be crowded out by a newcomer.I give you my word for that, too.”

Some scattered cheers broke out at this announcement, which promised
for the instant to become general, and then were hushed down by the
prevalent anxiety to hear more.In this momentary interval Reuben caught
the sound of a window being cautiously raised immediately above the
front door, and guessed with a little flutter of the heart who this new
auditor might be.“Secondly,” he went on, “you ought to be told the truth about the
shutting down of the furnaces and the lockout.These women were not at
all responsible for either action.I know of my own knowledge that both
things caused them genuine grief, and that they were shocked beyond
measure at the proposal to bring outside workmen into the town to
undersell and drive away their own neighbors and fellow-townsmen.I
want you to realize this, because otherwise you would do a wrong in your
minds to these good women who belong to Thessaly, who are as fond of our
village and its people as any other soul within its borders, and who,
for their own sake as well as that of Stephen Minster’s memory, deserve
respect and liking at your hands.“I may tell you frankly that they were misled and deceived by agents, in
whom, mistakenly enough, they trusted, into temporarily giving power
to these unworthy men.The result was a series of steps which they
deplored, but did not know how to stop.A few days ago I was called
into the case to see what could be done toward undoing the mischief from
which they, and you, and the townspeople generally, suffer.Since then I
have been hard at work both in court and out of it, and I believe I can
say with authority that the attempt to plunder the Minster estate and to
impoverish you will be beaten all along the line.”

This time the outburst of cheering was spontaneous and prolonged.When
it died away, some voice called out, “Three cheers for the ladies!” and
these were given, too, not without laughter at the jack-o’-lantem boy,
who waved his pumpkin vigorously.“One word more,” called out Tracy, “and I hope you will take in good
part what I am going to say.When I made my way up through the grounds,
I was struck by the fact that nobody seemed to know just why he had come
here.I gather now that word was passed around during the day that there
would be a crowd here, and that something, nobody understood just what,
would be done after they got here.I do not know who started the idea,
or who circulated the word.It might be worth your while to find out.Meanwhile, don’t you agree with me that it is an unsatisfactory and
uncivil way of going at the thing?This is a free country, but just
because it _is_ free, we ought to feel the more bound to respect one
another’s rights.There are countries in which, I dare say, if I were a
citizen, or rather a subject, I might feel it my duty to head a mob or
join a riot.But here there ought to be no mob; there should be no room
for even thought of a riot.Our very strength lies in the idea that we
are our own policemen--our own soldiery.I say this not because one in
a hundred of you meant any special harm in coming here, but because the
notion of coming itself was not American.Beware of men who suggest that
kind of thing.Beware of men who preach the theory that because you are
puddlers or moulders or firemen, therefore you are different from the
rest of your fellow-citizens.I, for one, resent the idea that because I
am a lawyer, and you, for example, are a blacksmith, therefore we belong
to different classes.I wish with all my heart that everybody resented
it, and that that abominable word ‘classes’ could be wiped out of the
English language as it is spoken in America.I am glad if
you feel easier in your minds than you did when you came.If you do,
I guess there’s been no harm done by your coming which isn’t more than
balanced by the good that has come out of it.Only next time, if you
don’t mind, we’ll have our meeting somewhere else, where it will be
easier to speak than it is in a snowstorm, and where we won’t keep our
neighbors awake.And now good-night, everybody.”

Out of the satisfied and amiable murmur which spread through the crowd
at this, there rose a sharp, querulous voice:

“Give us the names of the men who, you say, _were_ responsible.”

“No, I can’t do that to-night.But if you read the next list of
indictments found by the grand jury of Dearborn County, my word as a
lawyer you’ll find them all there.”

The loudest cheer of the evening burst upon the air at this, and there
was a sustained roar when Tracy’s name was shouted out above the tumult.Some few men crowded up to the steps to shake hands with him, and many
others called out to him a personal “good-night.” The last of those to
shake the accumulated snow from their collars and hats, and turn their
steps homeward, noted that the whole front of the Minster house had
suddenly become illuminated.Thus Reuben’s simple and highly fortuitous conquest of what had been
planned to be a mob was accomplished.It is remembered to this day as
the best thing any man ever did single-handed in Thessaly, and it is
always spoken of as the foundation of his present political eminence.But he himself would say now, upon reflection, that he succeeded
because the better sense of his auditors, from the outset, wanted him
to succeed, and because he was lucky enough to impress a very decent and
bright-witted lot of men with the idea that he wasn’t a humbug.*****

At the moment he was in no mood to analyze his success.His hair was
streaming with melted snow, his throat was painfully hoarse and sore,
and the fatigue from speaking so loud, and the reaction from his great
excitement, combined to make him feel a very weak brother indeed.So utterly wearied was he that when the door of the now lighted hallway
opened behind him, and Miss Kate herself, standing in front of the
servant on the threshold, said: “We want you to come in, Mr.Tracy,” he
turned mechanically and went in, thinking more of a drink of some sort
and a chance to sit down beside her, than of all the possible results of
his speech to the crowd.The effect of warmth and welcome inside the mansion was grateful to
all his senses.He parted with his hat and overcoat, took the glass of
claret which was offered him, and allowed himself to be led into the
drawing-room and given a seat, all in a happy daze, which was, in truth,
so very happy, that he was dimly conscious of the beginnings of tears
in his eyes.It seemed now that the strain upon his mind and heart--the
anger, and fright, and terrible anxiety--had lasted for whole weary
years.Trial by soul-torture was new to him, and this ordeal through
which he had passed left him curiously flabby and tremulous.He lay back in the easy-chair in an ecstasy of physical lassitude and
mental content, surrendering himself to the delight of watching the
beautiful girl before him, and of listening to the music of her voice.The liquid depths of brown eyes into which he looked, and the soft tones
which wooed his hearing, produced upon him vaguely the sensation of
shining white robes and celestial harps--an indefinitely glorious
recompense for the travail that lay behind in the valley of the shadow
of death.Nothing was further from him than the temptation to break this bright
spell by speech.“We heard almost every word of what you said,” Kate was saying.“When
you began we were in this room, crouched there by the window--that is,
Ethel and I were, for mamma refused to even pretend to listen--and at
first we thought it was one of the mob, and then Ethel recognized your
voice.That almost annoyed me, for it seemed as if _I_ should have
been---at least, equally quick to know it--that is, I mean, I’ve heard
you speak so much more than she has.And then we both hurried up-stairs,
and lifted the window--and oh!“And from the moment we knew it was you--that you were here--we felt
perfectly safe.It doesn’t seem now that we were very much afraid, even
before that, although probably we were.There was a lot of hooting, and
that dreadful blowing on horns, and all that, and once somebody rang the
door-bell; but, beyond throwing snowballs, nothing else was done.So
I daresay they only wanted to scare us.Of course it was the fire that
made us really nervous.We got that brave girl’s warning about the mob’s
coming here just a little while before the sky began to redden with the
blaze; and that sight, coming on the heels of her letter--”

“What girl?“Here it is,” answered Kate, drawing a crumpled sheet of paper from her
bosom, and reading aloud:

“Dear Miss Minster:

“I have just heard that a crowd of men are coming to your house to-night
to do violent things.I am starting out to try and bring you help.Meanwhile, I send you my father, who will do whatever you tell him to
do.“Gratefully yours,

“Jessica Lawton.”

Reuben had risen abruptly to his feet before the signature was reached.“I am ashamed of myself,” he said; “I’ve left her out there all this
while.There was so much else that really she
escaped my memory altogether.”

He had made his way out into the hall and taken up his hat and coat.“You will come back, won’t you?” Kate asked.“There are so many things
to talk over, with all of us.And--and bring her too, if--if she will
come.”

With a sign of acquiescence and comprehension.Reuben darted down the
steps and into the darkness.In a very few minutes he returned,
disappointment written all over his face.Gedney, the man I left with the sleigh, says she went off
as soon as I had got out of sight.I had offered to have him drive her
home, but she refused.She’s a curiously independent girl.”

“I am very sorry,” said Kate.“But I will go over the first thing in the
morning and thank her.”

“You don’t as yet know the half of what you have to thank her for,”
 put in the lawyer.“I don’t mean that it was so great a thing--my
coming--but she drove all the way out to my mother’s farm to bring me
here to-night, and fainted when she got there.If
her father is still here, I think he’d better go at once to her place,
and see about her.”

The suggestion seemed a good one, and was instantly acted upon.Ben
Lawton had been in the kitchen, immensely proud of his position as
the responsible garrison of a beleaguered house, and came out into the
hallway now with a full stomach and a satisfied expression on his lank
face.He assented with readiness to Reuben’s idea, when it was explained to
him.“So she druv out to your mother’s place for you, did she?” he commented,
admiringly.“That girl’s a genuwine chip of the old block.I mean,” he
added, with an apologetic smile, “of the old, old block.I ain’t got so
much git-up-and-git about me, that I know of, but her grandfather was a
regular snorter!”

“We shall not forget how much we are obliged to you, Mr.Lawton,” said
Kate, pleasantly, offering him her hand.“Be sure that you tell your
daughter, too, how grateful we all are.”

Ben took the delicate hand thus amazingly extended to him, and shook it
with formal awkwardness.“I didn’t seem to do much,” he said, deprecatingly, “and perhaps I
wouldn’t have amounted to much, neether, if it had a-come to fightin’
and gougin’ and wras’lin’ round generally.But you can bet your boots,
ma’am, that I’d a-done what I could!”

With this chivalrous assurance Ben withdrew, and marched down the steps
with a carriage more nearly erect than Thessaly had ever seen him assume
before.The heavy front door swung to, and Reuben realized, with a new rush of
charmed emotion, that heaven had opened for him once more.A servant came and whispered something to Miss Kate.The latter nodded,
and then turned to Reuben with a smile full of light and softness.“If you will give me your arm,” she said, in a delicious murmur, “we
will go into the dining-room.My mother and sister are waiting for us
there.We are not supper-people as a rule, but it seemed right to have
one to-night.”




CHAPTER XXXV.--THE SHINING REWARD.The scene which opened upon Reuben’s eyes was like a vista of
fairyland.The dark panelled room, with its dim suggestions of gold
frames and heavy curtains, and its background of palms and oleanders,
contributed with the reticence of richness to the glowing splendor of
the table in its centre.Here all light was concentrated--light which
fell from beneath ruby shades at the summits of tall candles, and
softened the dazzling whiteness of the linen, mellowed the burnished
gleam of the silver plate, reflected itself in tender, prismatic hues
from the facets of the cut-glass decanters.There were flowers here
which gave forth still the blended fragrance of their hot-house home,
and fragile, painted china, and all the nameless things of luxury which
can make the breaking of bread a poem.Reuben had seen something dimly resembling this in New York once or
twice at semi-public dinners.The thought that this higher marvel was
in his honor intoxicated his reason.The other thought--that conceivably
his future might lie all in this flower-strewn, daintily lighted
path--was too heady, too full of threatened delirium, to be even
entertained.With an anxious hold upon himself, he felt his way forward
to self-possession.It came sooner than he had imagined it would, and
thereafter everything belonged to a dream of delight.The ladies were all dressed more elaborately than he had observed them
to be on any previous occasion, and, at the outset, there was something
disconcerting in this.Speedily enough, though, there came the
reflection that his clothes were those in which he had raced
breathlessly from the farm, in which he had faced and won the crowd
outside, and then, all at once, he was at perfect ease.He told them--addressing his talk chiefly to Mrs.Minster, who sat at
the head of the table, to his left--the story of Jessica’s ride, of her
fainting on her arrival, and of the furious homeward drive.From this
he drifted to the final proofs which had been procured at Cadmus--he
had sent Gedney home with the horses, and was to see him early in the
morning--and then to the steps toward a criminal prosecution which he
would summarily take.“So far as I can see, Mrs.Minster,” he concluded, when the servant
had again left the room, “no real loss will result from this whole
imbroglio.It may even show a net gain, when everything is cleared
up; for your big loan must really give you control of the Thessaly
Manufacturing Company, in law.These fellows staked their majority
interest in that concern to win your whole property in the game.They have lost, and the proceeds must go to you.Of course, it is not
entirely clear how the matter will shape itself; but my notion is that
you will come out winner.”

Mrs.“My daughters thought that I knew
nothing about business!” she said, with an air of easy triumph.The daughters displayed great eagerness to leave this branch of the
matter undiscussed.“And will it really be necessary to prosecute these men?” asked Ethel,
from Reuben’s right.The lawyer realized, even before he spoke, that not a little of his
bitterness had evaporated.“Men ought to be punished for such a crime as
they committed,” he said.“If only as a duty to the public, they should
be prosecuted.”

He was looking at Kate as he spoke, and in her glance, as their eyes
met, he read something which prompted him hastily to add:

“Of course, I am in your hands in the matter.I have committed myself
with the crowd outside to the statement that they should be punished.I
was full, then, of angry feelings; and I still think that they ought to
be punished.But it is really your question, not mine.And I may even
tell you that there would probably be a considerable financial advantage
in settling the thing with them, instead of taking it before the grand
jury.”

“That is a consideration which we won’t discuss,” said Kate.“If my mind
were clear as to the necessity of a prosecution, I would not alter the
decision for any amount of money.But my sister and I have been talking
a great deal about this matter, and we feel--You know that Mr.Boyce
was, for a time, on quite a friendly footing in this house.”

“Yes; I know.” Reuben bowed his head gravely.“Well, you yourself said that if one was prosecuted, they all must be.”

“No doubt.Wendover and Tenney were smart enough to put the credulous
youngster in the very forefront of everything.Until these affidavits
came to hand to-day, it would have been far easier to convict him than
them.”

“Precisely,” urged Kate.“Credulous is just the word.He was weak,
foolish, vain--whatever you like.But I
don’t believe that at the outset, or, indeed, till very recently, he had
any idea of being a party to a plan to plunder us.There are reasons,”
 the girl blushed a little, and hesitated, “to be frank, there are
reasons for my thinking so.”

Reuben, noting the faint flush of embarrassment, catching the doubtful
inflection of the words, felt that he comprehended everything, and
mirrored that feeling in his glance.“I quite follow you,” he said.“It is my notion that he was deceived, at
the beginning.”

“Others deceived him, and still more he deceived himself,” responded
Kate.“And that is why,” put in Ethel, “we feel like asking you not to take
the matter into the courts--I mean so as to put him in prison.It would
be too dreadful to think of--to take a man who had dined at your house,
and been boating with you, and had driven with you all over the Orange
Mountains, picking wild-flowers for you and all that, and put him into
prison, where he would have his hair shaved off, and tramp up and down
on a treadmill.No; we mustn’t do that, Mr.Tracy.”

Kate added musingly: “He has lost so much, we can afford to be generous,
can we not?”

Then Reuben felt that there could be no answer possible except “yes.”
 His heart pleaded with his brain for a lover’s interpretation of this
speech; and his tongue, to evade the issue, framed some halting words
about allowing him to go over the whole case to-morrow, and postponing a
final decision until that had been done.The consent of silence was accorded to this, and everybody at the
table knew that there would be no prosecutions.Upon the instant the
atmosphere grew lighter.“And now for the real thing,” said Kate, gayly.“I am commissioned on
behalf of the entire family to formally thank you for coming to our
rescue tonight.Mamma did not hear your speech--she resolutely sat in
the library, pretending to read, during the whole rumpus, and we were
in such a hurry to get up-stairs that we didn’t tell her when you
began--but she couldn’t help hearing the horns, and she is as much
obliged to you as we are; and that is very, very, very much indeed!”

“Yes, indeed,” assented Mrs.“I don’t know where the police
were, at all.”

“The police could have done next to nothing, if they had been
here,” said Reuben.“The visit of the crowd was annoying enough, and
discreditable in its way, but I don’t really imagine there was ever any
actual danger.The men felt disagreeable about the closing of the works
and the importation of the French Canadians, and I don’t blame them;
but as a body they never had any idea of molesting you.My own notion is
that the mob was organized by outsiders--by men who had an end to serve
in frightening you--and that after the crowd got here it didn’t know
what to do with itself.The truth is, that the mob isn’t an American
institution.Its component parts are too civilized, too open to appeals
to reason.As soon as I told these people the facts in the case, they
were quite ready to go, and they even cheered for you before they went.”

“Ethel tells me that you promised them the furnaces should be opened
promptly,” said the mother, with her calm, inquiring glance, which might
mean sarcasm, anger, approval, or nothing at all.Reuben answered resolutely: “Yes, Mrs.And so they must
be opened, on Monday.It is my dearest
wish that I should be able to act for you all in this whole business.But I have gone too far now, the interests involved are too great, to
make a pause here possible.The very essence of the situation is that we
should defy the trust, and throw upon it the _onus_ of stopping us if it
can.We have such a grip upon the men who led you into that trust, and
who can influence the decisions of its directors, that they will not
dare to show fight.The force of circumstances has made me the custodian
of your interests quite as much as of your daughters’.I am very proud
and happy that it is so.It is true that I have not your warrant for
acting in your behalf; but if you will permit me to say so, that cannot
now be allowed to make the slightest difference in my action.”

“Yes, mamma, you are to be rescued in spite of yourself,” said Ethel,
merrily.The young people were all smiling at one another, and to their
considerable relief Mrs.Nobody attempted to analyze the mental processes by which she had been
brought around.It was enough that she had come to accept the situation.The black shadow of discord, which had overhung the household so long,
was gone, and mother and daughters joined in a sigh of grateful relief.It must have been nearly midnight when Reuben rose finally to go.There
had been so much to talk about, and time had flown so softly, buoyantly
along, that the evening seemed to him only to have begun, and he felt
that he fain would have had it go on forever.These delicious hours that
were past had been one sweet sustained conspiracy to do him honor, to
minister to his pleasure.No word or smile or deferential glance of
attention had been wanting to make complete the homage with which the
family had chosen to envelop him.The sense of tender domestic intimacy
had surcharged the very air he breathed.It had not even been necessary
to keep the ball of talk in motion: so well and truly did they know one
another, that silences had come as natural rests--silences more eloquent
than spoken words could be of mutual liking and trust.The outside world
had shrunk to nothingness.Here within this charmed circle of softened
light was home.All that the whole universe contained for him of beauty,
of romance, of reverential desire, of happiness, here within touch it
was centred.The farewells that found their way into phrases left scarcely a mark
upon his memory.There had been cordial, softly significant words of
smiling leave-taking with Ethel and her mother, and then, divinely
prompted by the spirit which ruled this blessed hour, they had gone
away, and he stood alone in the hallway with the woman he worshipped.He
held her hand in his, and there was no need for speech.Slowly, devoutly, he bowed his head over this white hand, and pressed
his lips upon it.There were tears in his eyes when he stood erect
again, and through them he saw with dim rapture the marvel of an angel’s
face, pale, yet glowing in the half light, lovely beyond all mortal
dreams; and on this face there shone a smile, tender, languorous,
trembling with the supreme ecstasy of a soul.Reuben could hardly have told as he walked away down
the path to the street.bless you!” was what the song-birds
carolled in his brain; but whether the music was an echo of what he had
said, did not make itself clear.He was scarcely conscious of the physical element of walking in his
progress.Rather it seemed to him that his whole being was afloat in the
ether, wafted forward by the halcyon winds of a beneficent destiny.Was
there ever such unthinkable bliss before in all the vast span of the
universe?The snowfall had long since ceased, and the clouds were gone.The air
was colder, and the broad sky was brilliant with the clear starlight of
winter.To the lover’s eyes, the great planets were nearer, strangely
nearer, than they had ever been before, and the undying fire with which
they burned was the same that glowed in his own heart.His senses linked
themselves to the grand procession of the skies.The triumphant onward
glide of the earth itself within this colossal scheme of movement was
apparent to him, and seemed but a part of his own resistless, glorified
onward sweep.Oh, this--_this_ was life!*****

At the same hour a heavy and lumpish man made his way homeward by a
neighboring street, tramping with difficulty through the hardening snow
which lay thick upon the walks.There was nothing buoyant in his stride,
and he never once lifted his eyes to observe the luminous panorama
spread overhead.With his hands plunged deep into his pockets, and his
cane under his arm, he trudged moodily along, his shoulders rounded and
his brows bent in a frown.An acquaintance going in the other direction called out cheerily as he
passed, “Hello, General!Pretty tough walking, isn’t it?” and had only
an inarticulate grunt for an answer.There were evil hints abroad in the village below, this night--stories
of impending revelations of fraud, hints of coming prosecutions--and
General Boyce had heard enough of these to grow sick at heart.That
Horace had been deeply mixed up in something scoundrelly, seemed only
too evident.Since this foolish, ungrateful boy had left the paternal
roof, his father had surrendered himself more than ever to drink; but
indulgence now, instead of the old brightening merriment of song and
quip and pleasantly reminiscent camp-fire sparkle, seemed to swing him
like a pendulum between the extremes of sullen wrath and almost tearful
weakness.Something of both these moods weighted his mind to-night, and
to their burden was added a crushingly gloomy apprehension that naked
disgrace was coming as well.Precisely what it was, he knew not; but
winks and nods and unnatural efforts to shift the conversation when
he came in had been in the air about him all the evening.The very
vagueness of the fear lent it fresh terror.His own gate was reached at last, and he turned wearily into the path
which encircled the small yard to reach the front door.He cursorily
noted the existence of some partially obliterated footprints in the
snow, and took it for granted that one of the servants had been out
late.He had begun fumbling in his pocket for the key, and had his foot on the
lower step, before he discovered in the dim light something which
gave even his martial nerves a start.The dark-clad figure of a woman,
obviously well dressed, apparently young, lay before him, the head and
arms bent under against his very door.The General was a man of swift decision and ready resource.In an
instant he had lifted the figure up out of the snow which half enveloped
it, and sustained it in one arm, while with the other he sent the
reverberating clamor of the door-bell pealing through the house.Then,
unlocking the door, he bore his burden lightly into the hall, turned up
the gas, and disposed the inanimate form on a chair.He did not know the woman, but it was evident that she was very
ill--perhaps dying.When the servant came down, he bade her run with all possible haste for
Dr.Lester, who lived only a block or so away.CHAPTER XXXVI.--“I TELL YOU I HAVE LIVED IT DOWN!”

 Instead of snow and cold and the black terror of being overwhelmed
by stormy night, here were light and warmth and a curiously sleepy yet
volatile sense of comfort.Jessica’s eyes for a long time rested tranquilly upon what seemed a
gigantic rose hanging directly over her head.Her brain received no
impression whatever as to why it was there, and there was not the
slightest impulse to wonder or to think about it at all.Even when it
finally began to descend nearer, and to expand and unfold pale pink
leaves, still it was satisfying not to have to make any effort toward
understanding it.The transformation went on with infinite slowness
before her vacantly contented vision.Upon all sides the outer leaves
gradually, little by little, stretched themselves downward, still
downward, until they enveloped her as in the bell of some huge inverted
lily.Indefinite spaces of time intervened, and then it became vaguely
apparent that faint designs of other, smaller flowers were scattered
over these large environing leaves, and that a soft, ruddy light came
through them.With measured deliberation, as if all eternity were at
its disposal, this vast floral cone revealed itself at last to her
dim consciousness as being made of some thin, figured cloth.It seemed
weeks--months--before she further comprehended that the rose above her
was the embroidered centre of a canopy, and that the leaves depending
from it in long, graceful curves about her were bed-curtains.After a time she found herself lifting her hand upright and looking at
it.It was wan and white like wax, as if it did not belong to her at
all.From the wrist there was turned back the delicately quilted cuff of
a man’s silk night-shirt.She raised the arm in its novel silken sleeve,
and thrust it forward with some unformed notion that it would prove not
to be hers.The action pushed aside the curtains, and a glare of light
flashed in, under which she shut her eyes and gasped.When she looked again, an elderly, broad-figured man with a florid face
was standing close beside the bed, gazing with anxiety upon her.She
knew that it was General Boyce, and for a long time was not surprised
that he should be there.The capacity for wondering, for thinking about
things, seemed not to exist in her brain.She looked at him calmly and
did not dream of speaking.“Are you better?” she heard him eagerly whisper.“Are you in pain?”

The complex difficulty of two questions which required separate answers
troubled her remotely.She made some faint nodding motion of her head
and eyes, and then lay perfectly still again.She could hear the sound
of her own breathing--a hoarse, sighing sound, as if of blowing through
a comb--and, now that it was suggested to her, there was a deadened
heavy ache in her breast.Still placidly surveying the General, she began to be conscious of
remembering things.The pictures came slowly, taking form with a
fantastic absence of consecutive meaning, but they gradually produced
the effect of a recollection upon her mind.The starting point--and
everything else that went before that terrible sinking, despairing
struggle through the wet snow--was missing.She recalled most vividly
of all being seized with a sudden crisis of swimming giddiness
and choking--her throat and chest all afire with the tortures of
suffocation.It was under a lamp-post, she remembered; and when the
vehement coughing was over, her mouth was full of blood, and there were
terrifying crimson spatters on the snow.She had stood aghast at this,
and then fallen to weeping piteously to herself with fright.How strange
it was--in the anguish of that moment she had moaned out, “O mother,
mother!” and yet she had never seen that parent, and had scarcely
thought of her memory even for many, many years.Then she had blindly staggered on, sinking more than once from sheer
exhaustion, but still forcing herself forward, her wet feet weighing
like leaden balls, and fierce agonies clutching her very heart.She had
fallen in the snow at the very end of her journey; had dragged herself
laboriously, painfully, up on to the steps, and had beaten feebly on the
panels of the door with her numbed hands, making an inarticulate moan
which not all her desperate last effort could lift into a cry; and then
there had come, with a great downward swoop of skies and storm, utter
blackness and collapse.She closed her eyes now in the weariness which this effort at
recollection had caused.Her senses wandered off, unbidden, unguided,
to a dream of the buzzing of a bee upon a window-pane, which was somehow
like the stertorous sound of her own breathing.The bee--a big, loud, foolish fellow, with yellow fur upon his broad
back and thighs--had flown into the schoolroom, and had not wit enough
to go out again.Some of the children were giggling over this, but
she would not join them because Mr.Tracy, the schoolmaster upon the
platform, did not wish it.Already
she delighted in the hope that he liked her better than he did some of
the other girls--scornful girls who came from wealthy homes, and wore
better dresses than any of the despised Lawton brood could ever hope to
have.Silk dresses, opened boldly at the throat, and with long trains
tricked out with imitation garlands.They were worn now by older
girls--hard-faced, jealous, cruel creatures--and these sat in a room
with lace curtains and luxurious furniture.And some laughed with a ring
like brass in their voices, and some wept furtively in comers, and some
cursed their God and all living things; and there was the odor of wine
and the uproar of the piano, and over all a great, ceaseless shame and
terror.Escape from this should be made at all hazards; and the long, incredibly
fearful flight, with pursuit always pressing hot upon her, the evil
fangs of the wolf-pack snapping in the air all about her frightened
ears, led to a peaceful, soft-carpeted forest, where the low setting
sun spread a red light among the big tree-trunks.Against this deep,
far-distant sky there was the figure of a man coming.For him she waited
with a song in her heart.It was Reuben Tracy, and
he was too gentle and good not to see her when he passed.She would call
out to him--and lo!Horace was with her, and held her hand; and they both gazed with
terrified longing after Tracy, and could not cry out to him for the
awful dumbness that was on them.And when he, refusing to see them,
spread out his arms in anger, the whole great forest began to sway and
circle dizzily, and huge trees toppled, rocks crashed downward, gaunt
giant reptiles rose from yawning caves with hideous slimy eyes in a
lurid ring about her.And she would save Horace with her life, and
fought like mad, bleeding and maimed and frenzied, until the weight
of mountains piled upon her breast held her down in helpless, choking
horror.Then only came the power to scream, and--

Out of the roar of confusion and darkness came suddenly a hush and the
return of light.She was lying in the curtained bed, and a tender hand
was pressing soft cool linen to her lips.Opening her eyes in tranquil weakness, she saw two men standing at her
bedside.He who held the cloth in his hand was Dr.Lester, whom she
remembered very well.The other--he whose head was bowed, and whose eyes
were fastened upon hers with a pained and affrighted gaze--was Horace
Boyce.In her soul she smiled at him, but no answering softness came to his
harrowed face.“I told your father everything,” she heard the doctor say in a low tone.I happened to have attended her, by
the merest chance, when her child was born.”

“Her child?” the other asked, in the same low, far-away voice.He is in Thessaly now, a boy nearly six years
old.”

“Good God!I never knew--”

“You seem to have taken precious good care not to know,” said the
doctor, with grave dislike.“This is the time and place to speak plainly
to you, Boyce.This poor girl has come to her death through the effort
to save you from disgrace.She supposed you lived here, and dragged
herself here to help you.” Jessica heard the sentence of doom without
even a passing thought.Every energy left in her feebly fluttering
brain was concentrated upon the question, _Is_ he saved?Vaguely the
circumstances of the papers, of the threats against Horace, of her
desires and actions, seemed to come back to her memory.She waited in
dazed suspense to hear what Horace would say; but he only hung his head
the lower, and left the doctor to go on.“She raved for hours last night,” he said, “after the women had got her
to bed, and we had raised her out of the comatose state, about saving
you from State prison.First she would plead with Tracy, then she would
appeal to you to fly, and so backwards and forwards, until she wore
herself out.The papers she had got hold of--they must have slipped out
of Gedney’s pocket into the sleigh.I suppose you know that I took them
back to Tracy this morning?”

Still Horace made no answer, but bent that crushed and vacant gaze
upon her face.She marvelled that he could not see she was awake and
conscious, and still more that the strength and will to speak were
withheld from her.The dreadful pressure upon her breast was making
itself felt again, and the painful sound of the labored breathing took
on the sombre rhythm of a distant death-chant.No: still the doctor went on:

“Tracy will be here in a few minutes.He’s terribly upset by the thing,
and has gone first to tell the news at the Minsters’.Do you want to see
him when he comes?”

“I don’t know what I want,” said Horace, gloomily.“If I were you, I would go straight to him and say frankly, ‘I have been
a damned fool, and a still damneder hypocrite, and I throw myself on
your mercy.’ He’s the tenderest-hearted man alive, and this sight here
will move him.Upon my word, I can hardly keep the tears out of my eyes
myself.”

Jessica saw as through a mist that these two men’s faces, turned upon
her, were softened with a deep compassion.Then suddenly the power to
speak came to her.It was a puny and unnatural voice which fell upon her
ears--low and hoarsely grating, and the product of much pain.“Go away--doctor,” she murmured.“Leave him here.”

Horace sat softly upon the edge of the bed, and gathered her two hands
tenderly in his.He did not attempt to keep back the tears which welled
to his eyes, nor did he try to talk.Thus they were together for what
seemed a long time, surrounded by a silence which was full of voices
to them both.A wan smile settled upon her face as she held him in her
intent gaze.“Take the boy,” she whispered at last; “he is Horace, too.Don’t let him
lie--ever--to any girl.”

The young man groaned in spite of himself, and for answer gently pressed
her hands.“I promise you that, Jess,” he said, after a time, in a
broken voice.He bent over and kissed her on the forehead.The damp
roughness of the skin chilled and terrified him, but the radiance on her
face deepened.“It hurts--to breathe,” she said, after a time with a glance of
affectionate apology in her smile.Subdued noises were faintly heard now in the hallway outside, and
presently the door was opened cautiously, and a tall new figure entered
the room.After a moment’s hesitation Reuben Tracy tiptoed his way to
the bedside, and stood gravely behind and above his former partner.“Is she conscious?” he asked of Boyce, in a tremulous whisper; and
Horace, bending his head still lower, murmured between choking sobs: “It
is Mr.Tracy, Jess, come to say--to see you.”

Her eyes brightened with intelligence.“Good--good,” she said, slowly,
as if musing to herself.The gaze which she fastened upon Reuben’s face
was strangely full of intense meaning, and he felt it piercing his
very heart.Minutes went by under the strain of this deep, half-wild,
appealing look.At last she spoke, with a greater effort at distinctness
than before, and in a momentarily clearer tone.“You were always kind,” she said.“Don’t hurt--my boy.Shake hands with
him--for my sake.”

The two young men obeyed mechanically, after an instant’s pause, and
without looking at each other.Neither had eyes save for the white face
on the pillows in front of them, and for the gladdened, restful light
which spread softly over it as their hands touched in amity before her
vision.In the languor of peace which had come to possess her, even the sense of
pain in breathing was gone.There were shadowy figures on the retina of
her brain, but they conveyed no idea save of general beatitude to her
mind.The space in which her senses floated was radiant and warm and
full of formless beauty.Various individuals--types of her loosening
ties to life--came and went almost unheeded in this daze.Lucinda, vehemently weeping, and holding the little fair-haired,
wondering boy over the bed for her final kiss, passed away like a
dissolving mist.Her father’s face, too, dawned upon this dream,
tear-stained and woful, and faded again into nothingness.Other flitting
apparitions there were, even more vague and brief, melting noiselessly
into the darkened hush.The unclouded calm of this lethargy grew troubled presently when there
fell upon her dulled ear the low tones of a remembered woman’s voice.Enough of consciousness flickered up to tell her whose it was.She
strained her eyes in the gathering shadows to see Kate Minster, and
began restlessly to roll her head upon the pillow.“Where--where--_her?_” she moaned, striving to stretch forth her hand.It was lifted and held softly in a tender grasp, and she felt as well
a compassionate stroking touch laid upon her forehead.The gentle
magnetism of these helped the dying girl to bring into momentary being
the image of a countenance close above hers--a dark, beautiful face, all
melting now with affection and grief.She smiled faintly into this face,
and lay still again for a long time.The breathing grew terribly shorter
and more labored, the light faded.with the
air and emphasis of a pasha of three tails, throw myself on the sofa,
and with a "Waitah, glass of gwog and cigaw, please," commence to read
`Tom Cwingle's Log.'This is how I spent my first day, and a good part
of the night too, in London; and--moral--I should sincerely advise every
medical aspirant, or candidate for a commission in the Royal Navy, to
bring in his pocket some such novel as Roderick Random, or Harry
Lorrequer, to read immediately before passing, and to leave every other
book at home.CONVERSATION OF (NOT WITH) TWO
ISRAELITISH PARTIES.Next morning, while engaged at my toilet--not a limb of my body which I
had not amputated that morning mentally, not one of my joints I had not
exsected, or a capital operation I did not perform on my own person; I
had, in fact, with imaginary surgical instruments, cut myself all into
little pieces, dissected my every nerve, filled all my arteries with red
wax and my veins with blue, traced out the origin and insertion of every
muscle, and thought of what each one could and what each one could not
do; and was just giving the final twirl to my delicate moustache, and
the proper set to the bow of my necktie, when something occurred which
caused me to start and turn quickly round.It was a soft modest little
knock--almost plaintive in its modesty and softness--at my door.I
heard no footfall nor sound of any sort, simply the "tapping as of some
one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber-door; simply that and nothing
more.""This," thought I, "is Sarah Jane with my boots: mindful girl is Sarah
Jane."Then giving voice to my thoughts, "Thank you, Sally," said I,
"just leave them outside; I'll have Finnon haddocks and oatcake for
breakfast."Then, a voice that wasn't Sally's, but ever so much softer and more
kitten-like in tone, replied,--

"Hem!and presently added, "it is only _me_."Then the door was
pushed slightly open, while pressing one foot doubtfully against it I
peeped out, and to my surprise perceived the half of a little yellow
book and the whole of a little yellow face with whiskers at it, and an
expression so very like that of a one-year-old lady cat, that I remained
for a little in momentary expectation of hearing it purr.But it
didn't, merely smiling and repeating,--

"It's only me.""So I see," said I, quite taken aback as it were.Then
"_Me_," slowly and gently overcame the resistance my right foot offered,
and, pushing open the door, held out the yellow tract, which I took to
be of a spiritual nature, and spoke to "I" as follows:--

"We--that is, he!you see--had heard of
your going up to join the Navy."At that moment it seemed to "I" the
easiest thing in the world, short of spending money, to "join" the Royal
Navy."And so," continued "_Me_", "you see, he!we thought of
making you a call, all in business, you see, he!and offering you
our estimate for your uniform."grand name to my ear, I who had never worn anything more gay
than a homespun coat of houden-grey and a Gordon tartan kilt.I thought
it was my turn to say, "Hem!and even add an inaudible "Ho!for I felt myself expanding inch by inch like a kidney bean."In that little book," _Me_ went on, "there,"--pointing to the front
page--"you will find the names of one hundred and fifty-seven officers
and gentlemen who have honoured us with their custom."and Me added with animation, "You see: he!Was it any wonder then, that I succumbed to such a flood of temptation,
that even my native canniness disappeared or was swept away, and that I
promised this gentleman of feline address that if I passed I would
assuredly make his father a call?unfortunate greenhorn that I
was, I found out when too late that some on the list had certainly given
him their custom, and like myself repented only once but for ever; while
the custom of the majority was confined to a pair or two of duck
inexpressibles, a uniform cap, a dozen of buttons, or a hank of sewing
silk."We can proudly refer you," Me continued, as I bowed him to the door,
"to any of them, and if you do us the honour of calling you will be
enabled to judge for yourself; but," added he, in a stage whisper, at
the same time making a determined attempt, as I thought, to bite off my
ear, "be aware of the Jews.""What," said I, "is your father not then a Jew?the name I thought--"

"Oh-h-h!"he cried, "they may call us so; but--born in England--bred in
London--neighbourhood of Bond Street, highly respectable locality.Army
and Navy outfitters, my father and me, you see, he!We invite
inspection, give satisfaction, and defy competition, you see, he!And he glided silently down stairs, giving me scarcely time to observe
that he was a young man with black hair, black eyes and whiskers, and
wearing goloshes.I soon after went down to breakfast, wondering, as I well might, how my
feline friend had found out all about my affairs; but it was not till I
had eaten ninety and one breakfasts and a corresponding number of
dinners that I discovered he belonged to a class of fellows who live by
fleecing the poor victims they pretend to clothe.Intending candidates,
beware of the Jews!Tuesday came round at last, just as Tuesdays have always been in the
habit of doing, and at eleven o'clock precisely I, with my heart playing
a game of cricket, with my spine for the bat and my ribs for the wicket,
"repaired"--a very different mode of progression from any other with
which I am acquainted--to the medical department of Somerset House.I
do not remember ever having entered any place with feelings of greater
solemnity.I was astonished in no small degree at the people who passed
along the Strand for appearing so disgustingly indifferent,--

  "And I so weerie fu' o' care."Had I been going to stand my trial for manslaughter or cattle-lifting, I
am certain I should have felt supremely happy in comparison.I passed
the frowning gateway, traversed the large square, and crossed the
Rubicon by entering the great centre doorway and inquiring my way to the
examination room.I had previously, be it observed, sent in my medical
and surgical degrees, with all my class tickets and certificates,
including that for virtue.I was now directed up a great many long
stairs, along as many gloomy-looking corridors, in which I lost my way
at least half a dozen times, and had to call at a corresponding number
of green-baize-covered brass tacketed doors, in order to be put right,
before I at length found myself in front of the proper one, at which I
knocked once, twice, and even thrice, without in any way affecting or
diminishing the buzz that was going on behind the door; so I pushed it
open, and boldly entered.I now found myself in the midst of a large
and select assortment of clerks, whose tongues were hard at work if
their pens were not, and who did not seem half so much astonished at
seeing me there as I felt at finding myself.The room itself looked
like an hypertrophied law office, of which the principal features were
papers and presses, three-legged stools, calf-bound folios, and cobwebs.I stood for a considerable time, observing but unobserved, wondering
all the while what to say, how to say it, and whom to say it to, and
resisting an inclination to put my finger in my mouth.Moreover, at
that moment a war was going on within me between pride and modesty, for
I was not at all certain whether I ought to take off my hat; so being
"canny" and a Scot, I adopted a middle course, and commenced to wipe
imaginary perspiration from my brow, an operation which, of course,
necessitated the removal of my head-dress.Probably the cambric
handkerchief caught the tail of the eye of a quieter-looking knight of
the quill, who sat a little apart from the other drones of the pen; at
any rate he quickly dismounted, and coming up to me politely asked my
business.I told him, and he civilly motioned me to a seat to await my
turn for examination.By-and-bye other candidates dropped in, each of
whom I rejoiced to observe looked a little paler, decidedly more blue,
and infinitely greener than I did myself!This was some relief, so I
sat by the dusty window which overlooked the Thames, watching the little
skiffs gliding to and fro, the boats hastening hither and thither, and
the big lazy-like barges that floated on the calm unruffled bosom of the
great mysterious river, and thinking and wishing that it could but break
its everlasting silence and tell its tale, and mention even a tithe of
the scenes that had been acted on its breast or by its banks since it
first rolled its infant waters to the sea, through a forest of trees
instead of a forest of masts and spires, or tell of the many beings that
had sought relief from a world of sin and suffering under its dark
current.So ran my thoughts, and as the river so did time glide by, and
two hours passed away, then a third; and when at last my name was
called, it was only to inform me that I must come back on the following
day, there being too many to be examined at once.At the hour appointed I was immediately conducted into the presence of
the august assembly of examiners, and this, is what I saw, or rather,
this was the picture on my retina, for to see, in the usual acceptation
of the term, was, under the circumstances, out of the question:--A table
with a green cover, laid out for a feast--to me a ghastly feast--of
reason and flow of soul.My reason was to form the feast, my soul was
to flow; the five pleasant-looking and gentlemanly men who sat around
were to partake of the banquet.I did not walk into the room, I seemed
to glide as if in a dream, or as if I had been my own ghost.Every
person and every thing in the room appeared strangely contorted; and the
whole formed a wonderful mirage, miraculously confused.The fire hopped
up on the table, the table consigned itself to the flames at one moment,
and made an insane attempt to get up the chimney the next.The roof
bending down in one corner affectionately kissed the carpet, the carpet
bobbing up at another returned the chaste salute.Then the gentlemen
smiled on me pleasantly, while I replied by a horrible grin."Sit down, sir," said one, and his voice sounded far away, as if in
another world, as I tottered to the chair, and with palsied arm helped
myself to a glass of water, which had been placed on the table for my
use.The water revived me, and at the first task I was asked to
perform--translate a small portion of Gregory's (not powder) Conspectus
into English--my senses came back.The scales fell from my eyes, the
table and fire resumed their proper places, the roof and carpet ceased
to dally, my scattered brains came all of a heap once more, and I was
myself again as much as ever Richard was, or any other man.I answered
most of the questions, if not all.I was tackled for ten minutes at a
time by each of the examiners.I performed mental operations on the
limbs of beings who never existed, prescribed hypothetically for
innumerable ailments, brought divers mythical children into the world,
dissected muscles and nerves in imagination, talked of green trees,
fruit, flowers, natural families, and far-away lands, as if I had been
Linnaeus, Columbus, and Humboldt all in one, so that, in less than an
hour, the august body leant their backs against their respective chairs,
and looked knowingly in each other's faces for a period of several very
long seconds.They then nodded to one another, did this august body,
looked at their tablets, and nodded again.After this pantomime had
come to a conclusion I was furnished with a sheet of foolscap and sent
back to the room above the Thames to write a dissertation on fractures
of the cranium, and shortly after sending it in I was recalled and
informed that I had sustained the dread ordeal to their entire
satisfaction, etc, and that I had better, before I left the house, pay
an official visit to the Director-General.I bowed, retired, heaved a
monster sigh, made the visit of ceremony, and afterwards my exit.I met on coming out was a short, middle-aged
Shylock, hook-nosed and raven-haired, and arrayed in a surtout of seedy
black.He approached me with much bowing and smiling, and holding below
my nose a little green tract which he begged I would accept."Exceedingly kind," thought I, and was about to comply with his request,
when, greatly to my surprise and the discomposure of my toilet, an arm
was hooked into mine, I was wheeled round as if on a pivot, and found
myself face to face with another Israelite armed with a _red_ tract."He is a Jew and a dog," said this latter, shaking a forefinger close to
my face.said I.  The words had hardly escaped my lips when the other
Jew whipped his arm through mine and quickly re-wheeled me towards him."He is a liar and a cheat," hissed he, with the same motion of the
forefinger as his rival had used.said I, beginning to wonder what it all meant.I had not,
however, long time to wonder, being once more set spinning by the
Israelite of the red tract.he whispered, pointing to the other; and the
conversation was continued in the following strain.Although in the
common sense of the word it really was no conversation, as each of them
addressed himself to me only, and I could find no reply, still, taking
the word in its literal meaning (from con, together, and _verto_, I
turn), it was indeed a conversation, for they turned me together, each
one, as he addressed me, hooking his arm in mine and whirling me round
like the handle of an air-pump or a badly constructed teetotum, and
shaking a forefinger in my face, as if I were a parrot and he wanted me
to swear._Shylock of the green tract_.--"He is a swine and a scoundrel."_Israelite of the red_.--"He's a liar and a thief."_Shylock of the green_.--"And he'll get round you some way."_Israelite of red_.--"Ahab and brothers cheat everybody they can."_Shylock of green_.--"He'll be lending you money."_Red_.--"Whole town know them--"

_Green_.--"Charge you thirty per cent."Red--"They are swindlers and dogs."_Green_.--"Look at our estimate."_Red_.--"Look at _our_ estimate."_Green_.--"Peep at our charges."_Red_.--"Five years' credit."_Green_.--"Come with us, sir," tugging me to the right._Red_.--"This way, master," pulling me to the left._Green_.--"Be advised; he'll rob you."_Red_.--"If you go he'll murder you."I roared; and letting fly both fists at the same time,
I turned them both together on their backs and thus put an end to the
conversation.Only just in time, though, for the remaining ten tribes,
or their representatives, were hurrying towards me, each one swaying
aloft a gaudy- tract; and I saw no way of escaping but by fairly
making a run for it, which I accordingly did, pursued by the ten tribes;
and even had I been a centipede, I would have assuredly been torn limb
from limb, had I not just then rushed into the arms of my feline friend
from Bond Street.He purred, gave me a paw and many congratulations; was so glad I had
passed,--but, to be sure, knew I would,--and so happy I had escaped the
Jews; would I take a glass of beer?I said, "I didn't mind;" so we adjourned (the right word in the right
place--adjourned) to a quiet adjoining hotel."Now," said he, as he tendered the waiter a five-pound Bank of England
note, "you must not take it amiss, Doctor, but--"

"No smaller change, sir?""I'm afraid," said my friend (?), opening and turning over the contents
of a well-lined pocket-book, "I've only got five--oh, here are sovs, he!Then turning to me: "I was going to observe," he continued, "that
if you want a pound or two, he!he!--you know young fellows will be
young fellows--only don't say a word to my father, he!Well, we will go and see
father!""But," said I, "I really must go home first.""Oh dear no; don't think of such a thing.""I'm deuced hungry," continued I."My dear sir, excuse me, but it is just our dinner hour; nice roast
turkey, and boiled leg of mutton with--"

"Any pickled pork?"now you young _officers_ will have your jokes; but, he!though we don't just eat pork, you'll find us just as good as most
Christians.Some capital wine--very old brand; father got it from the
Cape only the other day; in fact, though I should not mention these
things, it was sent us by a grateful customer.But come, you're hungry,
we'll get a cab."FIND OUT WHAT A "GIG"
MEANS.The fortnight immediately subsequent to my passing into the Royal Navy
was spent by me in the great metropolis, in a perfect maze of pleasure
and excitement.For the first time for years I knew what it was to be
free from care and trouble, independent, and quietly happy.I went the
round of the sights and the round of the theatres, and lingered
entranced in the opera; but I went all alone, and unaccompanied, save by
a small pocket guide-book, and I believe I enjoyed it all the more on
that account.No one cared for nor looked at the lonely stranger, and
he at no one.I roamed through the spacious streets, strolled
delightedly in the handsome parks, lounged in picture galleries, or
buried myself for hour's in the solemn halls and classical courts of
that prince of public buildings the British Museum; and, when tired of
rambling, I dined by myself in a quiet hotel.Every sight was strange
to me, every sound was new; it was as if some good fairy, by a touch of
her magic wand, had transported me to an enchanted city; and when I
closed my eyes at night, or even shut them by day, behold, there was the
same moving panorama that I might gaze on till tired or asleep.But all this was too good to last long.One morning, on coming down to
breakfast, bright-hearted and beaming as ever, I found on my plate,
instead of fried soles, a long blue official letter, "On her Majesty's
Service."It was my appointment to the `Victory,'--"additional for
service at Haslar Hospital."As soon as I read it the enchantment was
dissolved, the spell was broken; and when I tried that day to find new
pleasures, new sources of amusement, I utterly failed, and found with
disgust that it was but a common work-a-day world after all, and that
London was very like other places in that respect.I lingered but a few
more days in town, and then hastened by train to Portsmouth to take up
my appointment--to join the service in reality.It was a cold raw morning, with a grey and cheerless sky, and a biting
south-wester blowing up channel, and ruffling the water in the Solent.Alongside of the pier the boats and wherries were all in motion,
scratching and otherwise damaging their gunwales against the stones, as
they were lifted up and down at the pleasure of the wavelets.The
boatmen themselves were either drinking beer at adjacent bars, or
stamping up and down the quay with the hopes of enticing a little warmth
to their half-frozen toes, and rubbing the ends of their noses for a
like purpose.Suddenly there arose a great commotion among them, and
they all rushed off to surround a gentleman in brand-new naval uniform,
who was looking, with his mouth open, for a boat, in every place where a
boat was most unlikely to be.Knowing at a glance that he was a
stranger, they very generously, each and all of them, offered their
services, and wanted to row him somewhere--anywhere.After a great deal
of fighting and scrambling among themselves, during which the officer
got tugged here and tugged there a good many times, he was at last
bundled into a very dirty cobble, into which a rough-looking boatman
bounded after him and at once shoved off.The naval officer was myself--the reader's obsequious slave.As for the
boatman, one thing must be said in his favour, he seemed to be a person
of religious character--in one thing at least, for, on the Day of
Judgment, I, for one, will not be able to turn round and say to him "I
was a stranger and ye took me not in," for he did take me in.In fact,
Portsmouth, as a town, is rather particular on this point of
Christianity: they do take strangers in.asked the jolly waterman, leaning a moment on his oars."Be going for to join, I dessay, sir?""You are right," said I; "but have the goodness to pull so that I may
not be wet through on both sides.""I'll pay here," said I, "before we go alongside.""That's all, sir--distance is short you know.""Do you mean to say," said I, "that you really mean to charge--"

"Just three bob," interrupting me; "flag's up--can see for yourself,
sir.""The flag, you see--I mean my good man--don't tell me about a flag, I'm
too far north for you;" and I tried to look as northish as possible."Why, sir," said the man of oars, with a pitying expression of
countenance and voice, "flag means double fare--anybody'll tell you
that, sir."said I; "don't tell me that any one takes the trouble of
hoisting a flag in order to fill your confounded pockets; there is half
a crown, and not a penny more do you get from me.""Well, sir, o' condition you has me again, sir, you know, sir,--and my
name's McDonald;" and he pocketed the money, which I afterwards
discovered was a _leetle_ too much."McDonald," thought I--"my
grandmother's name; the rascal thinks to come round me by calling
himself a Scotchman--the idea of a McDonald being a waterman!""Sir," said I, aloud, "it is my unbiassed opinion and firm conviction
that you are--" I was going to add "a most unmitigated blackguard," but
I noticed that he was a man of six feet two, with breadth in proportion,
so I left the sentence unfinished.We were now within sight of the bristling sides of the old `Victory,' on
the quarter-deck of which fell the great and gallant Nelson in the hour
of battle and triumph; and I was a young officer about to join that
service which can boast of so many brave and noble men, and brave and
noble deeds; and one would naturally expect that I would indulge in a
few dreams of chivalry and romance, picture to myself a bright and
glorious future, pounds' weight of medals and crosses, including the
Victoria, kiss the hilt of my sword, and all that sort of thing.I was too wretchedly cold for one reason, and the only feeling I
had was one of shyness; as for duty, I knew I could and would do that,
as most of my countrymen had done before me; so I left castle-building
to the younger sons of noblemen or gentry, whose parents can afford to
allow them two or three hundred pounds a year to eke out their pay and
smooth the difficulties of the service.Not having been fortunate
enough to be born with even a horn spoon in my mouth, I had to be
content with my education as my fortune, and my navy pay as my only
income."Stabird side, I dessay, sir?""Certainly," said I, having a glimmering idea that it must be the proper
side.A few minutes after--"The Admiral's gig is going there, sir,--better
wait a bit."I looked on shore and _did_ see a gig, and two horses
attached to it."No," said I, "decidedly not, he can't see us here, man.I suppose you
want to go sticking your dirty wet oars in the air, do you?"--(I had
seen pictures of this performance)."Drive on, I mean pull ahead, my
hearty"--a phrase I had heard at the theatre, and considered highly
nautical.The waterman obeyed, and here is what came of it.We were just
approaching the ladder, when I suddenly became sensible of a rushing
noise.I have a dim recollection of seeing a long, many-oared boat,
carrying a large red flag, and with an old grey-haired officer sitting
astern; of hearing a voice--it might have belonged to the old man of the
sea, for anything I could have told to the contrary--float down the
wind,--

"Clear the way with that (something) bumboat!"Then came a crash, my
heels flew up--I had been sitting on the gunwale--and overboard I went
with a splash, just as some one else in the long boat sang out.there was a little too much way for me.When I came
to the surface of the water, I found myself several yards from the
ladder, and at once struck out for it.There was a great deal of noise
and shouting, and a sailor held towards me the sharp end of a boathook;
but I had no intention of being lugged out as if I were a pair of canvas
trowsers, and, calling to the sailor to keep his pole to himself--did he
want to knock my eye out?--I swam to the ladder and ascended.Thus then
I joined the service, and, having entered at the foot of the ladder, I
trust some day to find myself at the top of it.And, talking of joining the service, I here beg to repudiate, as an
utter fabrication, the anecdote--generally received as authentic in the
service--of the Scotch doctor, who, going to report himself for the
first time on board of the `Victory,' knocked at the door, and inquired
(at a marine, I think), "Is this the Royal Nauvy?--'cause I'm come till
jine."The story bears "fib" on the face of it, for there is not a
Scottish schoolboy but knows that one ship does not make a navy, any
more than one swallow does a summer.But, dear intending candidate, if you wish to do the right thing, array
yourself quietly in frock-coat, cap--not cocked hat, remember--and
sword, and go on board your ship in any boat you please, only keep out
of the way of gigs.When you arrive on board, don't be expecting to see
the admiral, because you'll be disappointed; but ask a sailor or marine
to point you out the midshipman of the watch, and request the latter to
show you the commander.Make this request civilly, mind you; do not
pull his ear, because, if big and hirsute, he might beat you, which
would be a bad beginning.When you meet the commander, don't rush up
and shake him by the hand, and begin talking about the weather; walk
respectfully up to him, and lift your cap as you would to a lady; upon
which he will hurriedly point to his nose with his forefinger, by way of
returning the salute, while at the same time you say--

"_Come_ on board, sir--to _join_, sir."It is the custom of the Service to make this remark in a firm, bold,
decided tone, placing the emphasis on the "_come_" to show clearly that
you _did come_, and that no one kicked, or dragged, or otherwise brought
you on board against your will.The proper intonation of the remark may
be learned from any polite waiter at a hotel, when he tells you,
"Dinner's ready, sir, please;" or it may be heard in the "Now then,
gents," of the railway guard of the period.Having reported yourself to the man of three stripes, you must not
expect that he will shake hands, or embrace you, ask you on shore to
tea, and introduce you to his wife.No, if he is good-natured, and has
not had a difference of opinion with the captain lately, he _may_
condescend to show you your cabin and introduce you to your messmates;
but if he is out of temper, he will merely ask your name, and, on your
telling him, remark, "Humph!"then call the most minute midshipman to
conduct you to your cabin, being at the same time almost certain to
mispronounce your name.Say your name is Struthers, he will call you
Stutters."Here, Mr Pigmy, conduct Mr Stutters to his cabin, and show him where
the gunroom--ah!I beg his pardon, the wardroom--lies.""Ay, ay, sir," says the middy, and skips off at a round trot, obliging
you either to adopt the same ungraceful mode of progression, or lose
sight of him altogether, and have to wander about, feeling very much
from home, until some officer passing takes pity on you and leads you to
the wardroom.It is a way they have in the service, or rather it is the custom of the
present Director-General, not to appoint the newly-entered medical
officer at once to a sea-going ship, but instead to one or other of the
naval hospitals for a few weeks or even months, in order that he may be
put up to the ropes, as the saying is, or duly initiated into the
mysteries of service and routine of duty.This is certainly a good
idea, although it is a question whether it would not be better to adopt
the plan they have at Netley, and thus put the navy and army on the same
footing.Haslar Hospital at Portsmouth is a great rambling barrack-looking block
of brick building, with a yard or square surrounded by high walls in
front, and with two wings extending from behind, which, with the chapel
between, form another and smaller square.There are seldom fewer than a thousand patients within, and, independent
of a whole regiment of male and female nurses, sick-bay-men, servants,
cooks, _et id genus omne_, there is a regular staff of officers,
consisting of a captain--of what use I have yet to learn--two medical
inspector-generals, generally three or four surgeons, the same number of
regularly appointed assistant-surgeons, besides from ten to twenty
acting assistant-surgeons [Note 1] waiting for appointments, and doing
duty as supernumeraries.Of this last class I myself was a member.Soon as the clock tolled the hour of eight in the morning, the
staff-surgeon of our side of the hospital stalked into the duty cabin,
where we, the assistants, were waiting to receive him.Immediately
after, we set out on the morning visit, each of us armed with a little
board or palette to be used as a writing-desk, an excise inkstand slung
in a buttonhole, and a quill behind the ear.The large doors were
thrown open, the beds neat and tidy, and the nurses "standing by."Up
each side of the long wards, from bed to bed, we journeyed; notifying
the progress of each case, repeating the treatment here, altering or
suspending it there, and performing small operations in another place;
listening attentively to tales of aches and pains, and hopes and fears,
and just in a sort of general way acting the part of good Samaritans.From one ward to another we went, up and down long staircases, along
lengthy corridors, into wards in the attics, into wards on the basement,
and into wards below ground,--fracture wards, Lazarus wards, erysipelas
wards, men's wards, officers' wards; and thus we spent the time till a
little past nine, by which time the relief of so much suffering had
given us an appetite, and we hurried off to the messroom to breakfast.The medical mess at Haslar is one of the finest in the service.Attached to the room is a nice little apartment, fitted up with a
bagatelle-table, and boxing gloves and foils _ad libitum_.And, sure
enough, you might walk many a weary mile, or sail many a knot, without
meeting twenty such happy faces as every evening surrounded our
dinner-table, without beholding twenty such bumper glasses raised at
once to the toast of Her Majesty the Queen, and without hearing twenty
such good songs, or five times twenty such yarns and original bons-mots,
as you would at Haslar Medical Mess.Yet I must confess we partook in
but a small degree indeed of the solemn quietude of Wordsworth's--

  "--Party in a parlour cramm'd,
  Some sipping punch, some sipping tea,
  But, as you by their faces see,
  All silent--and all damned."I do not deny that we were a little noisy at times, and that on several
occasions, having eaten and drunken till we were filled, we rose up to
dance, and consequently received a _polite_ message from the inspector
whose house was adjoining, requesting us to "stop our _confounded_ row;"
but then the old man was married, and no doubt his wife was at the
bottom of it.Duty was a thing that did not fall to the lot of us supers every day.We took it turn about, and hard enough work it used to be too.As soon
as breakfast was over, the medical officer on duty would hie him away to
the receiving-room, and seat himself at the large desk; and by-and-bye
the cases would begin to pour in.First there would arrive, say three
or four blue-jackets, with their bags under their arms, in charge of an
assistant-surgeon, then a squad of marines, then more blue-jackets, then
more red-coats, and so the game of _rouge-et-noir_ would go on during
the day.The officer on duty has first to judge whether or not the case
is one that can be admitted,--that is, which cannot be conveniently
treated on board; he has then to appoint the patient a bed in a proper
ward, and prescribe for him, almost invariably a bath and a couple of
pills.Besides, he has to enter the previous history of the case,
verbatim, into each patient's case-book, and if the cases are numerous,
and the assistant-surgeon who brings them has written an elaborate
account of each disease, the duty-officer will have had his work cut out
for him till dinner-time at least.Before the hour of the patient's
dinner, this gentleman has also to glance into each ward, to see if
everything is right, and if there are any complaints.Even when ten or
eleven o'clock at night brings sleep and repose to others, his work is
not yet over; he has one other visit to pay any time during the night
through all his wards.Then with dark-lantern and slippers you may meet
him, gliding ghost-like along the corridors or passages, lingering at
ward doors, listening on the staircases, smelling and snuffing, peeping
and keeking, and endeavouring by eye, or ear, or nose, to detect the
slightest irregularity among the patients or nurses, such as burning
lights without orders, gambling by the light of the fire, or smoking.This visit paid, he may return to his virtuous cabin, and sleep as
soundly as he chooses.Very few of the old surgeons interfere with the duties of their
assistants, but there _be_ men who seem to think you have merely come to
the service to learn, not to practise your profession, and therefore
they treat you as mere students, or at the best hobble-de-hoy doctors.Of this class was Dr Gruff, a man whom I would back against the whole
profession for caudle, clyster, castor-oil, or linseed poultice; but
who, I rather suspect, never prescribed a dose of chiretta, santonin, or
lithia-water in his life.He came to me one duty-day, in a great hurry,
and so much excited that I judged he had received some grievous bodily
ailment, or suffered some severe family bereavement."Well, sir," he cried; "I hear, sir, you have put a case of ulcer into
the erysipelas ward."This remark, not partaking of the nature of question, I thought required
no answer."Is it true, sir?--is it true?""It is, sir," was the reply."And what do you mean by it, sir?he
exclaimed, waxing more and more wroth."I thought, sir--" I began."Yes, sir," continued I, my Highland blood getting uppermost, "I _did_
think that, the case being one of ulcer of an _erysipelatous_ nature, I
was--"

"Erysipelatous ulcer!"said he, "that alters the
case.I beg your pardon;" and he
trotted off again."All right," thought I, "old Gruff.But although there are not wanting medical officers in the service who,
on being promoted to staff-surgeon, appear to forget that ever they wore
less than three stripes, and can keep company with no one under the rank
of commander, I am happy to say they are few and far between, and every
year getting more few and farther between.It is a fine thing to be appointed for, say three or four years to a
home hospital; in fact, it is the assistant-surgeon's highest ambition.Next, in point of comfort, would be an appointment at the Naval Hospital
of Malta, Cape of Good Hope, or China.The acting assistant-surgeons are those who have not as yet
served the probationary year, or been confirmed.They are liable to be
dismissed without a court-martial.A STORM IN BISCAY BAY.A WORD ON BASS'S BEER.For the space of six weeks I lived in clover at Haslar, and at the end
of that time my appointment to a sea-going ship came.It was the
pleasure of their Lordships the Commissioners, that I should take my
passage to the Cape of Good Hope in a frigate, which had lately been put
in commission and was soon about to sail.Arrived there, I was to be
handed over to the flag-ship on that station for disposal, like so many
stones of salt pork.On first entering the service every medical
officer is sent for one commission (three to five years) to a foreign
station; and it is certainly very proper too that the youngest and
strongest men, rather than the oldest, should do the rough work of the
service, and go to the most unhealthy stations.The frigate in which I was ordered passage was to sail from Plymouth.To that town I was accordingly sent by train, and found the good ship in
such a state of internal chaos--painters, carpenters, sail-makers, and
sailors; armourers, blacksmiths, gunners, and tailors; every one engaged
at his own trade, with such an utter disregard of order or regularity,
while the decks were in such confusion, littered with tools, nails,
shavings, ropes, and spars, among which I scrambled, and over which I
tumbled, getting into everybody's way, and finding so little rest for
the sole of my foot, that I was fain to beg a week's leave, and glad
when I obtained it.On going on board again at the end of that time, a
very different appearance presented itself; everything was in its proper
place, order and regularity were everywhere.The decks were white and
clean, the binnacles, the brass and mahogany work polished, the gear all
taut, the ropes coiled, and the vessel herself sitting on the water
saucy as the queen of ducks, with her pennant flying and her beautiful
ensign floating gracefully astern.The gallant ship was ready for sea,
had been unmoored, had made her trial trips, and was now anchored in the
Sound.From early morning to busy noon, and from noon till night, boats
glided backwards and forwards between the ship and the shore, filled
with the friends of those on board, or laden with wardroom and gunroom
stores.Among these might have been seen a shore-boat, rowed by two
sturdy watermen, and having on board a large sea-chest, with a naval
officer on top of it, grasping firmly a Cremona in one hand and holding
a hat-box in the other.The boat was filled with any number of smaller
packages, among which were two black portmanteaus, warranted to be the
best of leather, and containing the gentleman's dress and undress
uniforms; these, however, turned out to be mere painted pasteboard, and
in a very few months the cockroaches--careless, merry-hearted
creatures--after eating up every morsel of them, turned their attention
to the contents, on which they dined and supped for many days, till the
officer's dress-coat was like a meal-sieve, and his pantaloons might
have been conveniently need for a landing-net.This, however, was a
matter of small consequence, for, contrary to the reiterated assurance
of his feline friend, no one portion of this officer's uniform held out
for a longer period than six months, the introduction of any part of his
person into the corresponding portion of his raiment having become a
matter of matutinal anxiety and distress, lest a solution of continuity
in the garment might be the unfortunate result.About six o'clock on a beautiful Wednesday evening, early in the month
of May, our gallant and saucy frigate turned her bows seaward and slowly
steamed away from amidst the fleet of little boats that--crowded with
the unhappy wives and sweethearts of the sailors--had hung around us all
the afternoon.Puffing and blowing a great deal, and apparently panting
to be out and away at sea, the good ship nevertheless left her anchorage
but slowly, and withal reluctantly, her tears falling thick and fast on
the quarter-deck as she went.The band was playing a slow and mournful air, by way of keeping up our
spirits._I_ had no friends to say farewell to, there was no tear-bedimmed eye to
gaze after me until I faded in distance; so I stood on the poop, leaning
over the bulwarks, after the fashion of Vanderdecken, captain of the
Flying Dutchman, and equally sad and sorrowful-looking.And what did I
see from my elevated situation?A moving picture, a living panorama; a
bright sky sprinkled with a few fleecy cloudlets, over a blue sea all in
motion before a fresh breeze of wind; a fleet of little boats astern,
filled with picturesquely dressed seamen and women waving handkerchiefs;
the long breakwater lined with a dense crowd of sorrowing friends, each
anxious to gain one last look of the dear face he may never see more.Yonder is the grey-haired father, yonder the widowed mother, the
affectionate brother, the loving sister, the fond wife, the beloved
sweetheart,--all are there; and not a sigh that is sighed, not a tear
that is shed, not a prayer that is breathed, but finds a response in the
bosom of some loved one on board.To the right are green hills,
people-clad likewise, while away in the distance the steeple of many a
church "points the way to happier spheres," and on the flagstaff at the
port-admiral's house is floating the signal "Fare thee well."The band has ceased to play, the sailors have given their last ringing
cheer, even the echoes of which have died away, and faintly down the
wind comes the sound of the evening bells.The men are gathered in
little groups on deck, and there is a tenderness in their landward gaze,
and a pathos in their rough voices, that one would hardly expect to
find."Yonder's my Poll, Jack," says one.the poor lass is
crying; blowed if I think I'll ever see her more.""There," says another, "is _my_ old girl on the breakwater, beside the
old cove in the red nightcap.""That's my father, Bill," answers a third."God bless the dear old
chap?""Good-bye, Jean; good-bye, lass.Blessed if I
don't feel as if I could make a big baby of myself and cry outright."Dick, Dick," exclaims an honest-looking tar; "I see'd my poor wife
tumble down; she had wee Johnnie in her arms, and--and what will I do?""Keep up your heart, to be sure," answers a tall, rough son of a gun."There, she has righted again, only a bit of a swoon ye see.I've got
neither sister, wife, nor mother, so surely it's _me_ that ought to be
making a noodle of myself; but where's the use?"An hour or two later we were steaming across channel, with nothing
visible but the blue sea all before us, and the chalky cliffs of
Cornwall far behind, with the rosy blush of the setting sun lingering on
their summits.Then the light faded from the sky, the gloaming star shone out in the
east, big waves began to tumble in, and the night breeze blew cold and
chill from off the broad Atlantic Ocean.Tired and dull, weary and sad, I went below to the wardroom and seated
myself on a rocking chair.It was now that I began to feel the
discomfort of not having a cabin.Being merely a supernumerary or
passenger, such a luxury was of course out of the question, even had I
been an admiral.I was to have a screen berth, or what a landsman would
call a canvas tent, on the main or fighting deck, but as yet it was not
rigged.Had I never been to sea before, I would have now felt very
wretched indeed; but having roughed it in Greenland and Davis Straits in
small whaling brigs, I had got over the weakness of sea-sickness; yet
notwithstanding I felt all the thorough prostration both of mind and
body, which the first twenty-four hours at sea often produces in the
oldest and best of sailors, so that I was only too happy when I at last
found myself within canvas.By next morning the wind had freshened, and when I turned out I found
that the steam had been turned off, and that we were bowling along
before a ten-knot breeze.All that day the wind blew strongly from the
N.N.E., and increased as night came on to a regular gale of wind.I had
seen some wild weather in the Greenland Ocean, but never anything
before, nor since, to equal the violence of the storm on that dreadful
night, in the Bay of Biscay.We were running dead before the wind at
twelve o'clock, when the gale was at its worst, and when the order to
light fires and get up steam had been given.Just then we were making
fourteen knots, with only a foresail, a fore-topsail, and main-topsail,
the latter two close-reefed.I was awakened by a terrific noise on
deck, and I shall not soon forget that awakening.The ship was leaking
badly both at the ports and scupper-holes; so that the maindeck all
around was flooded with water, which lifted my big chest every time the
roll of the vessel allowed it to flow towards it.To say the ship was
rolling would express but poorly the indescribably disagreeable
wallowing motion of the frigate, while men were staggering with anxious
faces from gun to gun, seeing that the lashings were all secure; so
great was the strain on the cable-like ropes that kept them in their
places.The shot had got loose from the racks, and were having a small
cannonade on their own account, to the no small consternation of the men
whose duty it was to re-secure them.It was literally sea without and
sea within, for the green waves were pouring down the main hatchway,
adding to the amount of water already _below_, where the chairs and
other articles of domestic utility were all afloat and making voyages of
discovery from one officer's cabin to another.On the upper deck all was darkness, confusion, and danger, for both the
fore and main-topsails had been carried away at the same time, reducing
us to one sail--the foresail.The noise and crackling of the riven
canvas, mingling with the continuous roar of the storm, were at times
increased by the rattle of thunder and the rush of rain-drops, while the
lightning played continually around the slippery masts and cordage.About one o'clock, a large ship, apparently unmanageable, was dimly seen
for one moment close aboard of us--had we come into collision the
consequences must have been dreadful;--and thus for two long hours,
_till steam was got up_, did we fly before the gale, after which the
danger was comparatively small.Having spent its fury, having in fact blown itself out of breath, the
wind next day retired to its cave, and the waves got smaller and
beautifully less, till peace and quietness once more reigned around us.Going on deck one morning I found we were anchored under the very shadow
of a steep rock, and not far from a pretty little town at the foot of a
high mountain, which was itself covered to the top with trees and
verdure, with the white walls of many a quaint-looking edifice peeping
through the green--boats, laden with fruit and fish and turtle,
surrounded the ship.The island of Madeira and town, of Funchal.As
there was no pier, we had to land among the stones.The principal
amusement of English residents here seems to be lounging about, cheroot
in mouth, beneath the rows of trees that droop over the pavements,
getting carried about in portable hammocks, and walking or riding (I
rode, and, not being able to get my horse to move at a suitable pace, I
looked behind, and found the boy from whom I had hired him sticking like
a leech to my animal's tail, nor would he be shaken off--nor could the
horse be induced to kick him off; this is the custom of the Funchalites,
and a funny one it is) to the top of the mountain, for the pleasure of
coming down in a sleigh, a distance of two miles, in twice as many
minutes, while the least deviation from the path would result in a
terrible smash against the wall of either side, but I never heard of any
such accident occurring.Three days at Madeira, and up anchor again; our next place of call being
Saint Helena.Every one has heard of the gentleman who wanted to
conquer the world but couldn't, who tried to beat the British but
didn't, who staked his last crown at a game of _loo_, and losing fled,
and fleeing was chased, and being chased was caught and chained by the
leg, like an obstreperous game-cock, to a rock somewhere in the middle
of the sea, on which he stood night and day for years, with his arms
folded across his chest, and his cocked hat wrong on, a warning to the
unco-ambitious.The rock was Saint Helena, and a very beautiful rock it
is too, hill and dell and thriving town, its mountain-sides tilled and
its straths and glens containing many a fertile little farm.It is the
duty of every one who touches the shores of this far-famed island to
make a pilgrimage to Longwood, the burial-place of the "great man."I
have no intention of describing this pilgrimage, for this has been done
by dozens before my time, or, if not, it ought to have been: I shall
merely add a very noticeable fact, which others may not perchance have
observed--_both sides_ of the road all the way to the tomb are strewn
with _Bass's beer-bottles_, empty of course, and at the grave itself
there are hogsheads of them; and the same is the case at every place
which John Bull has visited, or where English foot has ever trodden.The rule holds good all over the world; and in the Indian Ocean,
whenever I found an uninhabited island, or even reef which at some
future day would be an island, if I did not likewise find an empty
beer-bottle, I at once took possession in the name of Queen Victoria,
giving three hips!thrice, and singing "For he's a jolly
good fellow," without any very distinct notion as to who _was_ the jolly
fellow; also adding more decidedly "which nobody can deny"--there being
no one on the island to deny it.England has in this way acquired much additional territory at my hands,
without my having as yet received any very substantial recompense for my
services.THE MODERN RODERICK RANDOM.The duties of the assistant-surgeon--the modern Roderick Random--on
board a line-of-battle ship are seldom very onerous in time of peace,
and often not worth mentioning.Suppose, for example, the reader is
that officer.At five bells--half-past six--in the morning, if you
happen to be a light sleeper, you will be sensible of some one gliding
silently into your cabin, rifling your pockets, and extracting your
watch, your money, and other your trinkets; but do not jump out of bed,
pray, with the intention of collaring him; it is no thief--only your
servant.Formerly this official used to be a marine, with whom on
joining your ship you bargained in the following manner.The marine walked up to you and touched his front hair, saying at the
same time,--

"_I_ don't mind looking arter you, sir," or "I'll do for you, sir."On
which you would reply,--

"All right!and he would answer "Cheeks," or whatever
his name might be.(Cheeks, that is the real Cheeks, being a sort of
visionary soldier--a phantom marine--and very useful at times, answering
in fact to the Nobody of higher quarters, who is to blame for so many
things,--"Nobody is to blame," and "Cheeks is to blame," being
synonymous sentences.)Now-a-days Government kindly allows each commissioned officer one half
of a servant, or one whole one between two officers, which, at times, is
found to be rather an awkward arrangement; as, for instance, you and,
say, the lieutenant of marines, have each the half of the same servant,
and you wish your half to go on shore with a message, and the lieutenant
requires his half to remain on board: the question then comes to be one
which only the wisdom of Solomon could solve, in the same way that
Alexander the Great loosed the Gordian knot.Your servant, then, on entering your cabin in the morning, carefully and
quietly deposits the contents of your pockets on your table, and, taking
all your clothes and your boots in his arms, silently flits from view,
and shortly after re-enters, having in the interval neatly folded and
brushed them.You are just turning round to go to sleep again, when--

"Six bells, sir, please," remarks your man, laying his hand on your
elbow, and giving you a gentle shake to insure your resuscitation, and
which will generally have the effect of causing you to spring at once
from your cot, perhaps in your hurry nearly upsetting the cup of
delicious ship's cocoa which he has kindly saved to you from his own
breakfast--a no small sacrifice either, if you bear in mind that his own
allowance is by no means very large, and that his breakfast consists of
cocoa and biscuits alone--these last too often containing more weevils
than flour.As you hurry into your bath, your servant coolly informs
you--

"Plenty of time, sir."Then," you inquire, "it isn't six bells?""Not a bit on it, sir," he replies; "wants the quarter."At seven o'clock exactly you make your way forward to the sick-bay, on
the lower deck at the ship's bows.Now, this making your way forward
isn't by any means such an easy task as one might imagine; for at that
hour the deck is swarming with the men at their toilet, stripped to the
waist, every man at his tub, lathering, splashing, scrubbing and
rubbing, talking, laughing, joking, singing, sweating, and swearing.Finding your way obstructed, you venture to touch one mildly on the bare
back, as a hint to move aside and let you pass; the man immediately
damns your eyes, then begs pardon, and says he thought it was Bill "at
his lark again."Another who is bending down over his tub you touch
more firmly on the _os innominatum_, and ask him in a free and easy sort
of tone to "slue round there."He "slues round," very quickly too, but
unfortunately in the wrong direction, and ten to one capsizes you in a
tub of dirty soapsuds.Having picked yourself up, you pursue your
journey, and sing out as a general sort of warning--

For the benefit of those happy individuals who never saw, or had to eat,
weevils, I may here state that they are small beetles of the exact size
and shape of the common woodlouse, and that the taste is rather insipid,
with a slight flavour of boiled beans.Never have tasted the woodlouse,
but should think the flavour would be quite similar."Gangway there, lads," which causes at least a dozen of these worthies
to pass such ironical remarks to their companions as--

"Out of the doctor's way there, Tom.""Let the gentleman pass, can't you, Jack?""Port your helm, Mat; the doctor wants you to.""Round with your stern, Bill; the surgeon's _mate_ is a passing.""Kick that donkey Jones out of the doctor's road,"--while at the same
time it is always the speaker himself who is in the way.At last, however, you reach the sick-bay in safety, and retire within
the screen.Here, if a strict service man, you will find the surgeon
already seated; and presently the other assistant enters, and the work
is begun.There is a sick-bay man, or dispenser, and a sick-bay cook,
attached to the medical department.The surgeon generally does the
brain-work, and the assistants the finger-work; and, to their shame be
it spoken, there are some surgeons too proud to consult their younger
brethren, whom they treat as assistant-drudges, not assistant-surgeons.At eight o'clock--before or after,--the work is over, and you are off to
breakfast.At nine o'clock the drum beats, when every one, not otherwise engaged,
is required to muster on the quarter-deck, every officer as he comes up
lifting his cap, not to the captain, but to the Queen.After inspection
the parson reads prayers; you are then free to write, or read, or
anything else in reason you choose; and, if in harbour, you may go on
shore--boats leaving the ship at regular hours for the convenience of
the officers--always premising that one medical man be left on board, in
case of accident.In most foreign ports where a ship may be lying,
there is no want of both pleasure and excitement on shore.Take for
example the little town of Simon's, about twenty miles from Cape Town,
with a population of not less than four thousand of Englishmen, Dutch,
Malays, Caffres, and Hottentots.The bay is large, and almost
landlocked.The little white town is built along the foot of a lofty
mountain.Beautiful walks can be had in every direction, along the hard
sandy sea-beach, over the mountains and on to extensive table-lands, or
away up into dark rocky dingles and heath-clad glens.Nothing can
surpass the beauty of the scenery, or the gorgeous loveliness of the
wild heaths and geraniums everywhere abounding.There is a good hotel
and billiard-room; and you can shoot where, when, and what you please--
monkeys, pigeons, rock rabbits, wild ducks, or cobra-di-capellas.If
you long for more society, or want to see life, get a day or two days'
leave.Rise at five o'clock; the morning will be lovely and clear, with
the mist rising from its flowery bed on the mountain's brow, and the
sun, large and red, entering on a sky to which nor pen nor pencil could
do justice.The cart is waiting for you at the hotel, with an awning
spread above.Jump in: crack goes the long Caffre whip; away with a
plunge and a jerk go the three pairs of Caffre horses, and along the
sea-shore you dash, with the cool sea-breeze in your face, and the
water, green and clear, rippling up over the horses' feet; then, amid
such scenery, with such exhilarating weather, in such a life-giving
climate, if you don't feel a glow of pleasure that will send the blood
tingling through your veins, from the points of your ten toes to the
extreme end of your eyelashes, there must be something radically and
constitutionally wrong with you, and the sooner you go on board and dose
yourself with calomel and jalap the better.Arrived at Cape Town, a few introductions will simply throw the whole
city at your command, and all it contains.I do not intend this as a complete sketch of your trip, or I would have
mentioned some of the many beautiful spots and places of interest you
pass on the road--Rathfeldas for example, a hotel halfway, a house
buried in sweetness; and the country round about, with its dark waving
forests, its fruitful fields and wide-spreading vineyards, where the
grape seems to grow almost without cultivation; its comfortable
farm-houses; and above all its people, kind, generous, and hospitable as
the country is prolific.So you see, dear reader, a navy surgeon's life hath its pleasures.and sorry I am to add, its sufferings too; for a few
pages farther on the picture must change: if we get the lights we must
needs take the shadows also.ENEMY ON THE PORT BOW.We will suppose that the reader still occupies the position of
assistant-surgeon in a crack frigate or saucy line-of-battle ship.If
you go on shore for a walk in the forenoon you may return to lunch at
twelve; or if you have extended your ramble far into the country, or
gone to visit a friend or lady-love--though for the latter the gloaming
hour is to be preferred--you will in all probability have succeeded in
establishing an appetite by half-past five, when the officers'
dinner-boat leaves the pier.Now, I believe there are few people in the world to whom a good dinner
does not prove an attraction, and this is what in a large ship one is
always pretty sure of, more especially on guest-nights, which are
evenings set apart--one every week--for the entertainment of the
officers' friends, one or more of whom any officer may invite, by
previously letting the mess-caterer know of his intention.The
mess-caterer is the officer who has been elected to superintend the
victualling, as the wine-caterer does the liquor department, and a
by-no-means-enviable position it is, and consequently it is for ever
changing hands.Sailors are proverbial growlers, and, indeed, a certain
amount of growling is, and ought to be, permitted in every mess; but it
is scarcely fair for an officer, because his breakfast does not please
him, or if he can't get butter to his cheese after dinner, to launch
forth his indignation at the poor mess-caterer, who most likely is doing
all he can to please.These growlers too never speak right out or
directly to the point.It is all under-the-table stabbing."Such and such a ship that I was in," says growler first, "and such and
such a mess--"

"Oh, by George!"says growler second, "_I_ knew that ship; that was a
mess, and no mistake?""Why, yes," replies number one, "the lunch we got there was better than
the dinner we have in this old clothes-basket."On guest-nights your friend sits beside yourself, of course, and you
attend to his corporeal wants.One of the nicest things about the
service, in my opinion, is the having the band every day at dinner; then
too everything is so orderly; with our president and vice-president, it
is quite like a pleasure party every evening; so that altogether the
dinner, while in harbour, comes to be the great event of the day.And
after the cloth has been removed, and the president, with a preliminary
rap on the table to draw attention, has given the only toast of the
evening, the Queen, and due honour has been paid thereto, and the
bandmaster, who has been keeking in at the door every minute for the
last ten, that he might not make a mistake in the time, has played "God
save the Queen," and returned again to waltzes, quadrilles, or
selections from operas,--then it is very pleasant and delightful to loll
over our walnuts and wine, and half-dream away the half-hour till coffee
is served.Then, to be sure, that little cigar in our canvas
smoking-room outside the wardroom door, though the last, is by no means
the least pleasant part of the _dejeuner_.For my own part, I enjoy the
succeeding hour or so as much as any: when, reclining in an easy chair,
in a quiet corner, I can sip my tea, and enjoy my favourite author to my
heart's content.You must spare half an hour, however, to pay your last
visit to the sick; but this will only tend to make you appreciate your
ease all the more when you have done.So the evening wears away, and by
ten o'clock you will probably just be sufficiently tired to enjoy
thoroughly your little swing-cot and your cool white sheets.At sea, luncheon, or tiffin, is dispensed with, and you dine at
half-past two.Not much difference in the quality of viands after all,
for now-a-days everything worth eating can be procured, in hermetically
sealed tins, capable of remaining fresh for any length of time.There is one little bit of the routine of the service, which at first
one may consider a hardship.You are probably enjoying your deepest, sweetest sleep, rocked in the
cradle of the deep, and gently swaying to and fro in your little cot;
you had turned in with the delicious consciousness of safety, for well
you knew that the ship was far away at sea, far from rock or reef or
deadly shoal, and that the night was clear and collision very
improbable, so you are slumbering like a babe on its mother's breast--as
you are for that matter--for the second night-watch is half spent; when,
mingling confusedly with your dreams, comes the roll of the drum; you
start and listen.There is a moment's pause, when birr-r-r-r it goes
again, and as you spring from your couch you hear it the third time.And now you can distinguish the shouts of officers and petty officers,
high over the din of the trampling of many feet, of the battening down
of hatches, of the unmooring of great guns, and of heavy ropes and bars
falling on the deck: then succeeds a dead silence, soon broken by the
voice of the commander thundering, "Enemy on the port bow;" and then,
and not till then, do you know it is no real engagement, but the monthly
night-quarters.And you can't help feeling sorry there isn't a real
enemy on the port bow, or either bow, as you hurry away to the cockpit,
with the guns rattling all the while overhead, as if a real live
thunderstorm were being taken on board, and was objecting to be stowed
away.So you lay out your instruments, your sponges, your bottles of
wine, and your buckets of water, and, seating yourself in the midst,
begin to read `Midsummer Night's Dream,' ready at a moment's notice to
amputate the leg of any man on board, whether captain, cook, or
cabin-boy.Another nice little amusement the officer of the watch may give himself
on fine clear nights is to set fire to and let go the lifebuoy, at the
same time singing out at the top of his voice, "Man overboard."A boatswain's mate at once repeats the call, and vociferates down the
main hatchway, "Life-boat's crew a-ho-oy!"In our navy a few short but expressive moments of silence ever precede
the battle, that both officers and men may hold communion with their
God.The men belonging to this boat, who have been lying here and there
asleep but dressed, quickly tumble up the ladder pell-mell; there is a
rattling of oars heard, and the creaking of pulleys, then a splash in
the water alongside, the boat darts away from the ship like an arrow
from a bow, and the crew, rowing towards the blazing buoy, save the life
of the unhappy man, Cheeks the marine.And thus do British sailors rule the waves and keep old Neptune in his
own place.CONTAINING--IF NOT THE WHOLE--NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.If the disposing, in the service, of even a ship-load of
assistant-surgeons, is considered a matter of small moment, my disposal,
after reaching the Cape of Good Hope, needs but small comment.I was
very soon appointed to take charge of a gunboat, in lieu of a gentleman
who was sent to the Naval Hospital of Simon's Town, to fill a death
vacancy--for the navy as well as nature abhors a vacuum.I had seen the
bright side of the service, I was now to have my turn of the dark; I had
enjoyed life on board a crack frigate, I was now to rough it in a
gunboat.The east coast of Africa was to be our cruising ground, and our ship a
pigmy steamer, with plenty fore-and-aft about her, but nothing else; in
fact, she was Euclid's definition of a line to a t, length without
breadth, and small enough to have done "excellently well" as a Gravesend
tug-boat.Her teeth were five: namely, one gigantic cannon, a
65-pounder, as front tooth; on each side a brass howitzer; and flanking
these, two canine tusks in shape of a couple of 12-pounder Armstrongs.With this armament we were to lord it with a high hand over the Indian
Ocean; carry fire and sword, or, failing sword, the cutlass, into the
very heart of slavery's dominions; the Arabs should tremble at the roar
of our guns and the thunder of our bursting shells, while the slaves
should clank their chains in joyful anticipation of our coming; and best
of all, we--the officers--should fill our pockets with prize-money to
spend when we again reached the shores of merry England.Unfortunately,
this last premeditation was the only one which sustained disappointment,
for, our little craft being tender to the flag-ship of the station, all
our hard-earned prize-money had to be equally shared with her officers
and crew, which reduced the shares to fewer pence each than they
otherwise would have been pounds, and which was a burning shame.It was the Cape winter when I joined the gunboat.The hills were
covered with purple and green, the air was deliciously cool, and the
far-away mountain-tops were clad in virgin snow.It was twelve o'clock
noon when I took my traps on board, and found my new messmates seated
around the table at tiffin.The gunroom, called the wardroom by
courtesy--for the after cabin was occupied by the lieutenant
commanding--was a little morsel of an apartment, which the table and
five cane-bottomed chairs entirely filled.The officers were five--
namely, a little round-faced, dimple-cheeked, good-natured fellow, who
was our second-master; a tall and rather awkward-looking young
gentleman, our midshipman; a lean, pert, and withal diminutive youth,
brimful of his own importance, our assistant-paymaster; a fair-haired,
bright-eyed, laughing boy from Cornwall, our sub-lieutenant; and a "wee
wee man," dapper, clean, and tidy, our engineer, admitted to this mess
because he was so thorough an exception to his class, which is
celebrated more for the unctuosity of its outer than for the smoothness
of its inner man."Come along, old fellow," said our navigator, addressing me as I entered
the messroom, bobbing and bowing to evade fracture of the cranium by
coming into collision with the transverse beams of the deck above--"come
along and join us, we don't dine till four.""And precious little to dine upon," said the officer on his right."Steward, let us have the rum," [Note 1] cried the first speaker.And thus addressed, the steward shuffled in, bearing in his hand a black
bottle, and apparently in imminent danger of choking himself on a large
mouthful of bread and butter.This functionary's dress was remarkable
rather for its simplicity than its purity, consisting merely of a pair
of dirty canvas pants, a pair of purser's shoes--innocent as yet of
blacking--and a greasy flannel shirt.But, indeed, uniform seemed to be
the exception, and not the rule, of the mess, for, while one wore a blue
serge jacket, another was arrayed in white linen, and the rest had
neither jacket nor vest.The table was guiltless of a cloth, and littered with beer-bottles,
biscuits, onions, sardines, and pats of butter.exclaimed the sub-lieutenant; "that beggar
Dawson is having his own whack o' grog and everybody else's."I'll have _my_ tot to-day, I know," said the
assistant-paymaster, snatching the bottle from Dawson, and helping
himself to a very liberal allowance of the ruby fluid.cried the midshipman, snatching the
glass from the table and bolting the contents at a gulp, adding, with a
gasp of satisfaction as he put down the empty tumbler, "The chap thinks
nobody's got a soul to be saved but himself.""Soul or no soul," replied the youthful man of money as he gazed
disconsolately at the empty glass, "my _spirit's_ gone.""Blessed," said the engineer, shaking the black bottle, "if you devils
have left me a drain!see if I don't look out for A1 to-morrow."And they all said "Where is the doctor's?""See if that beggarly bumboat-man is alongside, and get me another pat
of butter and some soft tack; get the grub first, then tell him I'll pay
to-morrow."These and such like scraps of conversation began to give me a little
insight into the kind of mess I had joined and the character of my
future messmates."Steward," said I, "show me my cabin."He did so;
indeed, he hadn't far to go.It was the aftermost, and consequently the
smallest, although I _ought_ to have had my choice.It was the most
miserable little box I ever reposed in.Had I owned such a place on
shore, I _might_ have been induced to keep rabbits in it, or
guinea-pigs, but certainly not pigeons.Its length was barely six feet,
its width four above my cot and two below, and it was minus sufficient
standing-room for any ordinary-sized sailor; it was, indeed, a cabin for
a commodore--I mean Commodore Nutt--and was ventilated by a scuttle
seven inches in diameter, which could only be removed in harbour, and
below which, when we first went to sea, I was fain to hang a leather
hat-box to catch the water; unfortunately the bottom rotted out, and I
was then at the mercy of the waves.My cabin, or rather--to stick to the plain unvarnished truth--my burrow,
was alive with scorpions, cockroaches, ants, and other "crawlin'
ferlies.""That e'en to name would be unlawfu'."My dispensary was off the steerage, and sister-cabin to the pantry.To
it I gained access by a species of crab-walking, squeezing myself past a
large brass pump, and edging my body in sideways.The sick came one by
one to the dispensary door, and there I saw and treated each case as it
arrived, dressed the wounds and bruises and putrefying sores, and
bandaged the bad legs.There was no sick-berth attendant; to be sure
the lieutenant-in-command, at my request, told off "a little cabin-boy"
for my especial use.I had no cause for delectation on such an
acquisition, by no means; he was not a model cabin-boy like what you see
in theatres, and I believe will never become an admiral.He managed at
times to wash out the dispensary, or gather cockroaches, and make the
poultices--only in doing the first he broke the bottles, and in
performing the last duty he either let the poultice burn or put salt in
it; and, finally, he smashed my pot, and I kicked him forward, and
demanded another._He_ was slightly better, only he was seldom visible;
and when I set him to do anything, he at once went off into a sweet
slumber; so I kicked him forward too, and had in despair to become my
own menial.In both dispensary and burrow it was quite a difficult
business to prevent everything going to speedy destruction.The best
portions of my uniform got eaten by cockroaches or moulded by damp,
while my instruments required cleaning every morning, and even that did
not keep rust at bay.Imagine yourself dear reader, in any of the following interesting
positions:--

Very thirsty, and nothing but boiling hot newly distilled water to
drink; or wishing a cool bath of a morning, and finding the water in
your can only a little short of 212 degrees Fahrenheit.To find, when you awake, a couple of cockroaches, two inches in length,
busy picking your teeth.To find one in a state of decay in the mustard-pot.To have to arrange all the droppings and eggs of these interesting
creatures on the edge of your plate, previous to eating your soup.To have to beat out the dust and weevils from every square inch of
biscuit before putting it in your mouth.To be looking for a book and put your hand on a full-grown scaly
scorpion.Nice sensation--the animal twining round your finger, or
running up your sleeve._Denouement_--cracking him under foot--
full-flavoured bouquet--joy at escaping a sting.You are enjoying your dinner, but have been for some time sensible of a
strange titillating feeling about the region of your ankle; you look down
at last to find a centipede on your sock, with his fifty hind-legs--you
thank God not his fore fifty--abutting on to your shin._Tableau_--
green and red light from the eyes of the many-legged; horror of yourself
as you wait till he thinks proper to "move on."To awake in the morning, and find a large and healthy-looking tarantula
squatting on your pillow within ten inches of your nose, with his
basilisk eyes fixed on yours, and apparently saying, "You're only just
awake, are you?I've been sitting here all the morning watching you."You know if you move he'll bite you, somewhere; and if he _does_ bite
you, you'll go mad and dance _ad libitum_; so you twist your mouth in
the opposite direction and ejaculate--

"Steward!"but the steward does not come--in fact he is forward, seeing
after the breakfast.Meanwhile the gentleman on the pillow is moving
his horizontal mandibles in a most threatening manner, and just as he
makes a rush for your nose you tumble out of bed with a shriek; and, if
a very nervous person, probably run on deck in your shirt.Or, to fall asleep under the following circumstances: The bulkheads, all
around, black with cock-and-hen-roaches, a few of which are engaged
cropping your toe-nails, or running off with little bits of the skin of
your calves; bugs in the crevices of your cot, a flea tickling the sole
of your foot, a troop of ants carrying a dead cockroach over your
pillow, lively mosquitoes attacking you everywhere, hammer-legged flies
occasionally settling on your nose, rats running in and rats running
out, your lamp just going out, and the delicious certainty that an
indefinite number of earwigs and scorpions, besides two centipedes and a
tarantula, are hiding themselves somewhere in your cabin.Officers, as well as men, are allowed one half-gill of rum
daily, with this difference,--the former pay for theirs, while the
latter do not.ROUND THE CAPE AND UP THE 'BIQUE.It was a dark-grey cloudy forenoon when we "up anchor" and sailed from
Simon's Bay.Frequent squalls whitened the water, and there was every
indication of our being about to have dirty weather; and the tokens told
no lies.To our little craft, however, the foul weather that followed
seemed to be a matter of very little moment; for, when the wind or waves
were in any way high, she kept snugly below water, evidently thinking
more of her own convenience than our comfort, for such a procedure on
her part necessitated our leading a sort of amphibious existence, better
suited to the tastes of frogs than human beings.Our beds too, or
matresses, became converted into gigantic poultices, in which we nightly
steamed, like as many porkers newly shaven.Judging from the amount of
salt which got encrusted on our skins, there was little need to fear
danger, we were well preserved--so much so indeed, that, but for the
constant use of the matutinal freshwater bath, we would doubtless have
shared the fate of Lot's wife and been turned into pillars of salt.After being a few days at sea the wind began to moderate, and finally
died away; and instead thereof we had thunderstorms and waves, which, if
not so big as mountains, would certainly have made pretty large hills.Many a night did we linger on deck till well nigh morning, entranced by
the sublime beauty and terrible grandeur of those thunderstorms.The
roar and rattle of heaven's artillery; the incessant _floods_ of
lightning--crimson, blue, or white; our little craft hanging by the bows
to the crest of each huge inky billow, or next moment buried in the
valley of the waves, with a wall of black waters on every side; the wet
deck, the slippery shrouds, and the faces of the men holding on to the
ropes and appearing so strangely pale in the electric light; I see the
whole picture even now as I write--a picture, indeed, that can never,
never fade from my memory.Our cruising "ground" lay between the island and town of Mozambique in
the south, to about Magadoxa, some seven or eight degrees north of the
Equator.Nearly the whole of the slave-trade is carried on by the Arabs, one or
two Spaniards sometimes engaging in it likewise.The slaves are brought
from the far interior of South Africa, where they can be purchased for a
small bag of rice each.They are taken down in chained gangs to the
coast, and there in some secluded bay the dhows lie, waiting to take
them on board and convey them to the slave-mart at Zanzibar, to which
place Arab merchants come from the most distant parts of Arabia and
Persia to buy them.Dhows are vessels with one or two masts, and a
corresponding number of large sails, and of a very peculiar
construction, being shaped somewhat like a short or Blucher boot, the
high part of the boot representing the poop.They have a thatched roof
over the deck, the projecting eaves of which render boarding exceedingly
difficult to an enemy.Sometimes, on rounding the corner of a lagoon island, we would quietly
and unexpectedly steam into the midst of a fleet of thirty to forty of
these queer-looking vessels, very much to our own satisfaction, and
their intense consternation.Imagine a cat popping down among as many
mice, and you will be able to form some idea of the scramble that
followed.However, by dint of steaming here and there, and expending a
great deal of shot and shell, we generally managed to keep them together
as a dog would a flock of sheep, until we examined all their papers with
the aid of our interpreter, and probably picked out a prize.I wish I could say the prizes were anything like numerous; for perhaps
one-half of all the vessels we board are illicit slaveholders, and yet
we cannot lay a finger on them.It has been
said, and it is generally believed in England, that our cruisers are
sweeping the Indian Ocean of slavers, and stamping out the curse.But
the truth is very different, and all that we are doing, or able at
present to do, is but to pull an occasional hair from the hoary locks of
the fiend Slavery.This can be proved from the return-sheets, which
every cruiser sends home, of the number of vessels boarded, generally
averaging one thousand yearly to each man-o'-war, of which the half at
least have slaves or slave-irons on board; but only two, or at most
three, of these will become prizes.The reason of this will easily be
understood, when the reader is informed, that the Sultan of Zanzibar has
liberty to take any number of slaves from any one portion of his
dominions to another: these are called household slaves; and, as his
dominions stretch nearly all along the eastern shores of Africa, it is
only necessary for the slave-dealer to get his sanction and seal to his
papers in order to steer clear of British law.This, in almost every
case, can be accomplished by means of a bribe.So slavery flourishes,
the Sultan draws a good fat revenue from it, and the Portuguese--no
great friends to us at any time--laugh and wink to see John Bull paying
his thousands yearly for next to nothing.Supposing we liberate even
two thousand slaves a year, which I am not sure we do however, there are
on the lowest estimate six hundred slaves bought and sold daily in
Zanzibar mart; two hundred and nineteen thousand in a twelvemonth; and,
of our two thousand that are set free in Zanzibar, most, if not all,
by-and-bye, become bondsmen again.I am not an advocate for slavery, and would like to see a wholesale raid
made against it, but I do not believe in the retail system; selling
freedom in pennyworths, and spending millions in doing it, is very like
burning a penny candle in seeking for a cent.Yet I sincerely believe,
that there is more good done to the spread of civilisation and religion
in one year, by the slave-traffic, than all our missionaries can do in a
hundred.Don't open your eyes and smile incredulously, intelligent
reader; we live in an age when every question is looked at on both
sides, and why should not this?What becomes of the hundreds of
thousands of slaves that are taken from Africa?They are sold to the
Arabs--that wonderful race, who have been second only to Christians in
the good they have done to civilisation; they are taken from a state of
degradation, bestiality, and wretchedness, worse by far than that of the
wild beasts, and from a part of the country too that is almost unfit to
live in, and carried to more favoured lands, spread over the sunny
shores of fertile Persia and Arabia, fed and clothed and cared for;
after a few years of faithful service they are even called sons and feed
at their master's table--taught all the trades and useful arts, besides
the Mahommedan religion, which is certainly better than none--and, above
all, have a better chance given them of one day hearing and learning the
beautiful tenets of Christianity, the religion of love.I have met with few slaves who after a few years did not say, "Praised
be Allah for the good day I was take from me coontry!"and whose only
wish to return was, that they might bring away some aged parent, or
beloved sister, from the dark cheerless home of their infancy.Means and measures much more energetic must be brought into action if
the stronghold of slavedom is to be stormed, and, if not, it were better
to leave it alone."If the work be of God ye cannot overthrow it; lest
haply ye be found to fight even against God."THE DAYS WHEN WE WENT GIPSYING.QUILP THE
PILOT AND LAMOO.It might have been that our vessel was launched on a Friday, or sailed
on a Friday; or whether it was owing to our carrying the devil on board
of us in shape of a big jet-black cat, and for whom the lifebuoy was
thrice let go, and boats lowered in order to save his infernal majesty
from a watery grave; but whatever was the reason, she was certainly a
most unlucky ship from first to last; for during a cruise of eighteen
months, four times did we run aground on dangerous reefs, twice were we
on fire--once having had to scuttle the decks--once we sprung a bad leak
and were nearly foundering, several times we narrowly escaped the same
speedy termination to our cruise by being taken aback, while, compared
to our smaller dangers or lesser perils, Saint Paul's adventures--as a
Yankee would express it--wern't a circumstance.On the other hand, we were amply repaid by the many beautiful spots we
visited; the lovely wooded creeks where the slave-dhows played at hide
and seek with us, and the natural harbours, at times surrounded by
scenery so sweetly beautiful and so charmingly solitary, that, if
fairies still linger on this earth, one must think they would choose
just such places as these for their moonlight revels.Then there were
so many little towns--Portuguese settlements--to be visited, for the
Portuguese have spread themselves, after the manner of wild
strawberries, all round the coast of Africa, from Sierra Leone on the
west to Zanzibar on the east.There was as much sameness about these
settlements as about our visits to them: a few houses--more like tents--
built on the sand (it does seem funny to see sofas, chairs, and the
piano itself standing among the deep soft sand); a fort, the guns of
which, if fired, would bring down the walls; a few white-jacketed
swarthy-looking soldiers; a very polite governor, brimful of hospitality
and broken English; and a good dinner, winding up with punch of
schnapps.Memorable too are the pleasant boating excursions we had on the calm
bosom of the Indian Ocean.Armed boats used to be detached to cruise
for three or four weeks at a time in quest of prizes, at the end of
which time they were picked up at some place of rendezvous.By day we
sailed about the coast and around the small wooded islets, where dhows
might lurk, only landing in sheltered nooks to cook and eat our food.Our provisions were ship's, but at times we drove great bargains with
the naked natives for fowls and eggs and goats; then would we make
delicious soups, rich ragouts, and curries fit for the king of the
Cannibal Islands.Fruit too we had in plenty, and the best of oysters
for the gathering, with iguana most succulent of lizards, occasionally
fried flying-fish, or delicate morsels of shark, skip-jack, or devilled
dolphin, with a glass of prime rum to wash the whole down, and three
grains of quinine to charm away the fever.There was, too, about these
expeditions, an air of gipsying that was quite pleasant.To be sure our
beds were a little hard, but we did not mind that; while clad in our
blanket-suits, and covered with a boat-sail, we could defy the dew.Sleep, or rather the want of sleep, we seldom had to complain of, for
the blue star-lit sky above us, the gentle rising and falling of the
anchored boat, the lip-lipping of the water, and the sighing sound of
the wind through the great forest near us--all tended to woo us to
sweetest slumber.Sometimes we would make long excursions up the rivers of Africa,
combining business with pleasure, enjoying the trip, and at the same
time gleaning some useful information regarding slave or slave-ship.The following sketch concerning one or two of these may tend to show,
that a man does not take leave of all enjoyment, when his ship leaves
the chalky cliffs of old England.Our anchor was dropped outside the bar of Inambane river; the grating
noise of the chain as it rattled through the hawse-hole awoke me, and I
soon after went on deck.It was just six o'clock and a beautiful clear
morning, with the sun rising red and rosy--like a portly gentleman
getting up from his wine--and smiling over the sea in quite a pleasant
sort of way.So, as both Neptune and Sol seemed propitious, the
commander, our second-master, and myself made up our minds to visit the
little town and fort of Inambane, about forty--we thought fifteen--miles
up the river.But breakfast had to be prepared and eaten, the magazine
and arms got into the boat, besides a day's provisions, with rum and
quinine to be stowed away, so that the sun had got a good way up the
sky, and now looked more like a portly gentleman whose dinner had
disagreed, before we had got fairly under way and left the ship's side.Never was forenoon brighter or fairer, only one or two snowy banks of
cloud interrupting the blue of the sky, while the river, miles broad,
stole silently seaward, unruffled by wave or wavelet, so that the hearts
of both men and officers were light as the air they breathed was pure.The men, bending cheerfully on their oars, sang snatches of Dibdin--
Neptune's poet laureate; and we, tired of talking, reclined astern,
gazing with half-shut eyes on the round undulating hills, that, covered
with low mangrove-trees and large exotics, formed the banks of the
river.We passed numerous small wooded islands and elevated sandbanks,
on the edges of which whole regiments of long-legged birds waded about
in search of food, or, starting at our approach, flew over our heads in
Indian file, their bright scarlet-and-white plumage showing prettily
against the blue of the sky.Shoals of turtle floated past, and
hundreds of rainbow- jelly-fishes, while, farther off, many
large black bodies--the backs of hippopotami--moved on the surface of
the water, or anon disappeared with a sullen plash.Saving these sounds
and the dip of our own oars, all was still, the silence of the desert
reigned around us, the quiet of a newly created world.The forenoon wore away, the river got narrower, but, though we could see
a distance of ten miles before us, neither life nor sign of life could
be perceived.At one o'clock we landed among a few cocoa-nut trees to
eat our meagre dinner, a little salt pork, raw, and a bit of biscuit.No sooner had we "shoved off" again than the sky became overcast; we
were caught in, and had to pull against, a blinding white-squall that
would have laid a line-of-battle on her beam ends.The rain poured down
as if from a water-spout, almost filling the boat and drenching us to
the skin, and, not being able to see a yard ahead, our boat ran aground
and stuck fast.It took us a good hour after the squall was over to
drag her into deep water; nor were our misfortunes then at an end, for
squall succeeded squall, and, having a journey of uncertain length still
before us, we began to feel very miserable indeed.It was long after four o'clock when, tired, wet, and hungry, we hailed
with joy a large white house on a wooded promontory; it was the
Governor's castle, and soon after we came in sight of the town itself.Situated so far in the interior of Africa, in a region so wild, few
would have expected to find such a little paradise as we now beheld,--a
colony of industrious Portuguese, a large fort and a company of
soldiers, a governor and consulate, a town of nice little detached
cottages, with rows of cocoa-nut, mango, and orange trees, and in fact
all the necessaries, and luxuries of civilised life.It was, indeed, an
oasis in the desert, and, to us, the most pleasant of pleasant
surprises.Leaving the men for a short time with the boat, we made our way to the
house of the consul, a dapper little gentleman with a pretty wife and
two beautiful daughters--flowers that had hitherto blushed unseen and
wasted their sweetness in the desert air.After making us swallow a glass of brandy
each to keep off fever, he kindly led us to a room, and made us strip
off our wet garments, while a servant brought bundle after bundle of
clothes, and spread them out before us.There were socks and shirts and
slippers galore, with waistcoats, pantaloons, and head-dresses, and
jackets, enough to have dressed an opera troupe.The commander and I
furnished ourselves with a red Turkish fez and dark-grey dressing-gown
each, with cord and tassels to correspond, and, thus, arrayed, we
considered ourselves of no small account.Our kind entertainers were
waiting for us in the next room, where they had, in the mean time, been
preparing for us the most fragrant of brandy punch.By-and-bye two
officers and a tall Parsee dropped in, and for the next hour or so the
conversation was of the most animated and lively description, although a
bystander, had there been one, would not have been much edified, for the
following reason: the younger daughter and myself were flirting in the
ancient Latin language, with an occasional soft word in Spanish; our
commander was talking in bad French to the consul's lady, who was
replying in Portuguese; the second-master was maintaining a smart
discussion in broken Italian with the elder daughter; the Parsee and
officer of the fort chiming in, the former in English, the latter in
Hindostanee; but as no one of the four could have had the slightest idea
of the other's meaning, the amount of information given and received
must have been very small,--in fact, merely nominal.It must not,
however, be supposed that our host or hostesses could speak _no_
English, for the consul himself would frequently, and with a bow that
was inimitable, push the bottle towards the commander, and say, as he
shrugged his shoulders and turned his palms skywards, "Continue you, Sar
Capitan, to wet your whistle;" and, more than once, the fair creature by
my side would raise and did raise the glass to her lips, and say, as her
eyes sought mine, "Good night, Sar Officeer," as if she meant me to be
off to bed without a moment's delay, which I knew she did not.Then,
when I responded to the toast, and complimented her on her knowledge of
the "universal language," she added, with a pretty shake of the head,
"No, Sar Officeer, I no can have speak the mooch Englese."A servant,--
apparently newly out of prison, so closely was his hair cropped,--
interrupted our pleasant confab, and removed the seat of our Babel to
the dining-room, where as nicely-cooked-and-served a dinner as ever
delighted the senses of hungry mortality awaited our attention.No
large clumsy joints, huge misshapen roasts or bulky boils, hampered the
board; but dainty made-dishes, savoury stews, piquant curries, delicate
fricassees whose bouquet tempted even as their taste and flavour
stimulated the appetite, strange little fishes as graceful in shape as
lovely in colour, vegetables that only the rich luxuriance of an African
garden could supply, and numerous other nameless nothings, with
delicious wines and costly liqueurs, neatness, attention, and kindness,
combined to form our repast, and counteract a slight suspicion of
crocodiles' tails and stewed lizard, for where ignorance is bliss a
fellow is surely a fool if he is wise.We spent a most pleasant evening in asking questions, spinning yarns,
singing songs, and making love.The younger daughter--sweet child of
the desert--sang `Amante de alguno;' her sister played a selection from
`La Traviata;' next, the consul's lady favoured us with something
pensive and sad, having reference, I think, to bright eyes, bleeding
hearts, love, and slow death; then, the Parsee chanted a Persian hymn
with an "Allalallala," instead of Fol-di-riddle-ido as a chorus, which
elicited "Fra poco a me" from the Portuguese lieutenant; and this last
caused our commander to seat himself at the piano, turn up the white of
his eyes, and in very lugubrious tones question the probability of
"Gentle Annie's" ever reappearing in any spring-time whatever; then,
amid so much musical sentimentality and woe, it was not likely that I
was to hold my peace, so I lifted up my voice and sang--

  "Cauld kail in Aberdeen,
  An' cas ticks in Strathbogie;
  Ilka chiel maun hae a quean
  Bit leeze me on ma cogie--"

with a pathos that caused the tears to trickle over and adown the nose
of the younger daughter--she was of the gushing temperament--and didn't
leave a dry eye in the room.The song brought down the house--so to
speak--and I was the hero for the rest of the evening.Before parting
for the night we also sang `Auld lang syne,' copies of the words having
been written out and distributed, to prevent mistakes; this was supposed
by our hostess to be the English national anthem.It was with no small amount of regret that we parted from our friends
next day; a fresh breeze carried us down stream, and, except our running
aground once or twice, and being nearly drowned in crossing the bar, we
arrived safely on board our saucy gunboat.------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Afric's sunny fountains" have been engaged for such a length of time in
the poetical employment of "rolling down their golden sands," that a
bank or bar of that same bright material has been formed at the mouth of
every river, which it is very difficult and often dangerous to cross
even in canoes.We had despatched boats before us to take soundings on
the bar of Lamoo, and prepared to follow in the track thus marked out.Now, our little bark, although not warranted, like the Yankee boat, to
float wherever there is a heavy dew, was nevertheless content with a
very modest allowance of the aqueous element; in two and a half fathoms
she was quite at home, and even in two--with the help of a few
breakers--she never failed to bump it over a bar.We approached the bar
of Lamoo, therefore, with a certain degree of confidence till the keel
rasped on the sand; this caused us to turn astern till we rasped again;
then, being neither able to get back nor forward, we stopped ship, put
our fingers in our wise mouths, and tried to consider what next was to
be done.Just then a small canoe was observed coming bobbing over the
big waves that tumbled in on the bar; at one moment it was hidden behind
a breaker, next moment mounting over another, and so, after a little
game at bo-peep, it got alongside, and from it there scrambled on board
a little, little man, answering entirely to Dickens's description of
Quilp.added I, "by all that's small and ugly.""Your sarvant, sar," said Quilp himself.There
certainly was not enough of him to make two.He was rather darker in
skin than the Quilp of Dickens, and his only garment was a coal-sack
without sleeves--no coal-sack _has_ sleeves, however--begirt with a
rope, in which a short knife was stuck; he had, besides, sandals on his
feet, and his temples were begirt with a dirty dishclout by way of
turban, and he repeated, "I am one pilot, sar.""I do it, sar, plenty quick."I do him," cried the little man, as he mounted the
bridge; then cocking his head to one side, and spreading out his arms
like a badly feathered duck, he added, "Suppose I no do him plenty
proper, you catchee me and make shot.""If the vessel strikes, I'll hang you, sir."Quilp grinned--which was his way of smiling."And a half three," sung the man in the chains; then, "And a half four;"
and by-and-bye, "And a half three" again; followed next moment by, "By
the deep three."We were on the dreaded bar; on each
side of us the big waves curled and broke with a sullen boom like
far-off thunder; only, where we were, no waves broke."Mind yourself now," cried the commander to Quilp; to which he in wrath
replied--

"What for you stand there make bobbery?_I_ is de cap'n; suppose you is
fear, go alow, sar."and a large wave broke right aboard of us, almost sweeping us
from the deck, and lifting the ship's head into the sky.Another and
another followed; but amid the wet and the spray, and the roar of the
breakers, firmly stood the little pilot, coolly giving his orders, and
never for an instant taking his eyes from the vessel's jib-boom and the
distant shore, till we were safely through the surf and quietly steaming
up the river.After proceeding some miles, native villages began to appear here and
there on both shores, and the great number of dhows on the river, with
boats and canoes of every description, told us we were nearing a large
town.Two hours afterwards we were anchored under the guns of the
Sultan's palace, which were belching forth fire and smoke in return for
the salute we had fired.We found every creature and thing in Lamoo as
entirely primitive, as absolutely foreign, as if it were a city in some
other planet.The most conspicuous building is the Sultan's lofty fort
and palace, with its spacious steps, its fountains and marble halls.The streets are narrow and confused; the houses built in the Arab
fashion, and in many cases connected by bridges at the top; the
inhabitants about forty thousand, including Arabs, Persians, Hindoos,
Somali Indians, and slaves.The wells, exceedingly deep, are built in
the centre of the street without any protection; and girls, carrying on
their heads calabashes, are continually passing to and from them.Slaves, two and two, bearing their burdens of cowries and ivory on poles
between, and keeping step to an impromptu chant; black girls weaving
mats and grass-cloth; strange-looking tradesmen, with stranger tools, at
every door; rich merchants borne along in gilded palanquins; people
praying on housetops; and the Sultan's ferocious soldiery prowling
about, with swords as tall, and guns nearly twice as tall, as
themselves; a large shark-market; a fine bazaar, with gold-dust, ivory,
and tiger-skins exposed for sale; sprightly horses with gaudy trappings;
solemn-looking camels; dust and stench and a general aroma of savage
life and customs pervading the atmosphere, but law and order
nevertheless.No
spirituous liquor of any sort is sold in the town; the Sultan's soldiers
go about the streets at night, smelling the breath of the suspected, and
the faintest odour of the accursed fire-water dooms the poor mortal to
fifty strokes with a thick bamboo-cane next morning.The sugar-cane
grows wild in the fertile suburbs, amid a perfect forest of fine trees;
farther out in the country the cottager dwells beneath his few cocoa-nut
trees, which supply him with all the necessaries of life.One tree for
each member of his family is enough._He_ builds the house and fences
with its large leaves; his wife prepares meat and drink, cloth and oil,
from the nut; the space between the trees is cultivated for curry, and
the spare nuts are sold to purchase luxuries, and the rent of twelve
trees is only _sixpence_ of our money.no drunkenness,
no debt, no religious strife, but peace and contentment everywhere!Reader, if you are in trouble, or your affairs are going "to pot," or if
you are of opinion that this once favoured land is getting used up, I
sincerely advise you to sell off your goods and be off to Lamoo.Of the "gentlemen of England who live at home at ease," very few can
know how entirely dependent for happiness one is on his neighbours.Man
is out-and-out, or out-and-in, a gregarious animal, else `Robinson
Crusoe' had never been written.Now, I am sure that it is only correct
to state that the majority of combatant [Note 1] officers are, in simple
language, jolly nice fellows, and as a class gentlemen, having, in fact,
that fine sense of honour, that good-heartedness, which loves to do as
it would be done by, which hurteth not the feelings of the humble, which
turneth aside from the worm in its path, and delighteth not in plucking
the wings from the helpless fly.To believe, however, that there are no
exceptions to this rule would be to have faith in the speedy advent of
the millennium, that happy period of lamb-and-lion-ism which we would
all rather see than hear tell of; for human nature is by no means
altered by bathing every morning in salt water, it is the same afloat as
on shore.And there are many officers in the navy, who--"dressed in a
little brief authority," and wearing an additional stripe--love to lord
it over their fellow worms.Nor is this fault altogether absent from
the medical profession itself!It is in small gunboats, commanded perhaps by a lieutenant, and carrying
only an assistant-surgeon, where a young medical officer feels all the
hardships and despotism of the service; for if the lieutenant in command
happens to be at all frog-hearted, he has then a splendid opportunity of
puffing himself up.In a large ship with from twenty to thirty officers in the mess, if you
do not happen to meet with a kindred spirit at one end of the table, you
can shift your chair to the other.But in a gunboat on foreign service,
with merely a clerk, a blatant middy, and a second-master who would fain
be your senior, as your messmates, then, I say, God help you!unless you
have the rare gift of doing anything for a quiet life.It is all
nonsense to say, "Write a letter on service about any grievance;" you
can't write about ten out of a thousand of the petty annoyances which go
to make your life miserable; and if you do, you will be but little
better, if, indeed, your last state be not worse than your first.I have in my mind's eye even now a lieutenant who commanded a gunboat in
which I served as medical officer in charge.This little man was what
is called a sea-lawyer--my naval readers well know what I mean; he knew
all the Admiralty Instructions, was an amateur engineer, only needed the
title of M.D.to make him a doctor, could quibble and quirk, and in fact
could prove by the Queen's Regulations that your soul, to say nothing of
your body, wasn't your own; that _you_ were a slave, and _he_ lord--god
of all he surveyed.he has gone to his account; he
will not require an advocate, he can speak for himself.Not many such
hath the service, I am happy to say.He was continually changing his
poor hard-worked sub-lieutenants, and driving his engineers to drink,
previously to trying them by court-martial.At first he and I got on
very well; apparently he "loved me like a vera brither;" but we did not
continue long "on the same platform," and, from the day we had the first
difference of opinion, he was my foe, and a bitter one too.I assure
you, reader, it gave me a poor idea of the service, for it was my first
year.He was always on the outlook for faults, and his kindest words to
me were "chaffing" me on my accent, or about my country.To be able to
meet him on his own ground I studied the Instructions day and night, and
tried to stick by them.Malingering was common on board; one or two whom I caught I turned to
duty: the men, knowing how matters stood between the commander and me,
refused to work, and so I was had up and bullied on the quarter-deck for
"neglect of duty" in not putting these fellows on the sick-list.After
this I had to put every one that asked on the sick-list."Doctor," he would say to me on reporting the number sick, "this is
_wondrous_ strange--_thirteen_ on the list, out of only ninety men.Why, sir, I've been in line-of-battle ships,--_line-of-battle_ ships,
sir,--where they had not ten sick--_ten sick_, sir."This of course
implied an insult to me, but I was like a sheep before the shearers,
dumb.On Sunday mornings I went with him the round of inspection; the sick who
were able to be out of hammock were drawn up for review: had he been
half as particular with the men under his own charge or with the ship in
general as he was with the few sick, there would have been but little
disease to treat.Instead of questioning _me_ concerning their
treatment, he interrogated the sick themselves, quarrelling with the
medicine given, and pooh-pooh-ing my diagnosis.Those in hammocks, who
most needed gentleness and comfort, he bullied, blamed for being ill,
and rendered generally uneasy.Remonstrance on my part was either taken
no notice of, or instantly checked.If men were reported by me for
being dirty, giving impudence, or disobeying orders, _he_ became their
advocate--an able one too--and _I_ had to retire, sorry I had spoken.But I would not tell the tenth part of what I had to suffer, because
such men as he are the _exception_, and because he is dead.A little
black baboon of a boy who attended on this lieutenant-commanding had one
day incurred his displeasure: "Bo'swain's mate," cried he, "take my boy
forward, hoist him on an ordinary seaman's back, and give him a
rope's-ending; and," turning to me, "Doctor, you'll go and attend my
boy's flogging."With a face like crimson I rushed
below to my cabin, and--how could I help it?--made a baby of myself for
once; all my pent-up feelings found vent in a long fit of crying.True, I might in this case have written a letter to the service about my
treatment; but, as it is not till after twelve months the
assistant-surgeon is confirmed, the commander's word would have been
taken before mine, and I probably dismissed without a court-martial.That probationary year I consider more than a grievance, it is a _cruel
injustice_.There is a regulation--of late more strictly enforced by a
circular--that every medical officer serving on board his own ship shall
have a cabin, and the choice--by rank--of cabin, and he is a fool if he
does not enforce it.But it sometimes happens that a sub-lieutenant
(who has no cabin) is promoted to lieutenant on a foreign station; he
will then rank above the assistant-surgeon, and perhaps, if there is no
spare cabin, the poor doctor will have to give up his, and take to a
sea-chest and hammock, throwing all his curiosities, however valuable,
overboard.It would be the duty of the captain in such a case to build
an additional cabin, and if he did not, or would not, a letter to the
admiral would make him.Does the combatant officer treat the medical officer with respect?Certainly, unless one or other of the two be a snob: in the one case the
respect is not worth having, in the other it can't be expected.In the military branch you shall find many officers belonging to the
best English families: these I need hardly say are for the most part
gentlemen, and gentle men.However, it is allowed in most messes that

  "The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
  A man's man for a' that;"

and I assure the candidate for a commission, that, if
