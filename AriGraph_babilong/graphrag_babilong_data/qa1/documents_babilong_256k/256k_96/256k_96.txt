COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Fort McAllister is at last in complete possession of the Federals, and a
group of the men who had charged over these ramparts has arranged itself
before the camera as if in the very act of firing the great gun that
points seaward across the marshes, toward Ossabaw Sound.There is one very
peculiar thing proved by this photograph--the gun itself is almost in a
fixed position as regards range and sweep of fire.Instead of the
elevating screw to raise or depress the muzzle, there has been substituted
a block of wood wedged with a heavy spike, and the narrow pit in which the
gun carriage is sunk admits of it being turned but a foot or so to right
or left.It evidently controlled one critical point in the river, but
could not have been used in lending any aid to the repelling of General
Hazen's attack.The officer pointing with outstretched arm is indicating
the very spot at which a shell fired from his gun would fall.The men in
the trench are artillerymen of General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth
Corps; their appearance in their fine uniforms, polished breastplates and
buttons, proves that Sherman's men could not have presented the ragged
appearance that they are often pictured as doing in the war-time sketches.That Army and Navy have come together is proved also by the figure of a
marine from the fleet, who is standing at "Attention" just above the
breach of the gun.Next, leaning on his saber, is a cavalryman, in short
jacket and chin-strap.[Illustration: THE SPOILS OF VICTORY]

THE TROOPS THAT MARCHED TO THE SEA BECOME DAY-LABORERS

Here are the men that marched to the sea doing their turn as day-laborers,
gleefully trundling their wheelbarrows, gathering up everything of value
in Fort McAllister to swell the size of Sherman's "Christmas present."Brigadier-General W. B. Hazen, after his men had successfully stormed the
stubbornly defended fort, reported the capture of twenty-four pieces of
ordnance, with their equipment, forty tons of ammunition, a month's supply
of food for the garrison, and the small arms of the command.In the upper
picture the army engineers are busily at work removing a great 48-pounder
8-inch Columbiad that had so long repelled the Federal fleet.There is
always work enough and to spare for the engineers both before and after
the capture of a fortified position.In the wheelbarrows is a harvest of
shells and torpedoes.These deadly instruments of destruction had been
relied upon by the Confederates to protect the land approach to Fort
McAllister, which was much less strongly defensible on that side than at
the waterfront.While Sherman's army was approaching Savannah one of his
officers had his leg blown off by a torpedo buried in the road and stepped
on by his horse.After that Sherman set a line of Confederate prisoners
across the road to march ahead of the army, and no more torpedoes were
found.After the capture of Fort McAllister the troops set to work
gingerly scraping about wherever the ground seemed to have been disturbed,
trying to find and remove the dangerous hidden menaces to life.At last
the ground was rendered safe and the troops settled down to the occupation
of Fort McAllister where the bravely fighting little Confederate garrison
had held the key to Savannah.The city was the first to fall of the
Confederacy's Atlantic seaports, now almost locked from the outside world
by the blockade.By the capture of Fort McAllister, which crowned the
march to the sea, Sherman had numbered the days of the war.The fall of
the remaining ports was to follow in quick succession, and by Washington's
Birthday, 1865, the entire coast-line was to be in possession of the
Federals.[Illustration: SHERMAN'S TROOPS DISMANTLING FORT McALLISTER]

Durham's Station, N. C., were begun the negotiations between Johnston and
Sherman which finally led to that event.The two generals met there on

and hastily pressed into service by the Federal navy to help solve the
problem of patrolling the three thousand miles of coast, along which the
blockade must be made effective.In order to penetrate the intricate
inlets and rivers, light-draft fighting-vessels were required, and the
most immediate means of securing these was to purchase every sort of
merchant craft that could possibly be adapted to the purposes of war,
either as a fighting-vessel or as a transport.The ferryboat in the
picture has been provided with guns and her pilot-houses armored.A
casemate of iron plates has been provided for the gunners.The Navy
Department purchased and equipped in all one hundred and thirty-six
vessels in 1861, and by the end of the year had increased the number of
seamen in the service from 7,600 to over 22,000.Many of these new
recruits saw their first active service aboard the converted ferryboats,
tugboats, and other frail and unfamiliar vessels making up the nondescript
fleet that undertook to cut off the commerce of the South.The experience
thus gained under very unusual circumstances placed them of necessity
among the bravest sailors of the navy.[Illustration: THE LAST PORT CLOSED

time--fifty-five ships of war, including five ironclads, altogether
carrying six hundred guns.The upper picture shows the nature of the

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]It frequently took a blockade-runner to
catch a blockade-runner, and as the Federal navy captured ship after ship
of this character they began to acquire a numerous fleet of swift steamers
from which it was difficult for any vessel to get away.The "Vance"
brought many a cargo to the hungry Southern ports, slipping safely by the
blockading fleet and back again till her shrewd Captain Willie felt that
he could give the slip to anything afloat.On her last trip she had safely
gotten by the Federal vessels lying off the harbor of Wilmington, North
Carolina, and was dancing gleefully on her way with a bountiful cargo of
cotton and turpentine when, on September 10, 1864, in latitude 34 deg.W., a vessel was sighted which rapidly bore down upon
her.It proved to be the "Santiago de Cuba," Captain O. S. Glisson.The
rapidity with which the approaching vessel overhauled him was enough to
convince Captain Willie that she was in his own class.The "Santiago de
Cuba" carried eleven guns, and the "Vance" humbly hove to, to receive the
prize-crew which took her to Boston, where she was condemned.In the
picture we see her lying high out of the water, her valuable cargo having
been removed and sold to enrich by prize-money the officers and men of her
fleet captor.[Illustration: A GREYHOUND CAUGHT--WRECK OF THE BLOCKADE-RUNNER "COLT"]

The wreck of this blockade-runner, the "Colt," lies off Sullivan's Island,
Charleston Harbor, in 1865.The coast of the Carolinas, before the war was
over, was strewn with just such sights as this.The bones of former
"greyhounds" became landmarks by which the still uncaptured
blockade-runners could get their bearings and lay a course to safety.If
one of these vessels were cut off from making port and surrounded by
Federal pursuers, the next best thing was to run her ashore in shallow
water, where the gunboats could not follow and where her valuable cargo
could be secured by the Confederates.A single cargo at war-time prices
was enough to pay more than the cost of the vessel.Regular auctions were
held in Charleston or Wilmington, where prices for goods not needed by the
Confederate Government were run up to fabulous figures.The business of
blockade-running was well organized abroad, especially in England.One
successful trip was enough to start the enterprise with a handsome profit.A blockade-runner like the "Kate," which made forty trips or more, would
enrich her owners almost beyond the dreams of avarice.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE RAM "STONEWALL"]

Here are two striking views in the Port Royal dry-dock of the Confederate
ram "Stonewall."When this powerful fighting-ship sailed from Copenhagen,
Jan.T. J. Page, C. S. N., the Federal
navy became confronted by its most formidable antagonist during the war.In March, 1863, the Confederacy had negotiated a loan of L3,000,000, and
being thus at last in possession of the necessary funds, Captain Bulloch
and Mr.Slidell arranged with M. Arman, who was a member of the
_Corps-Legislatif_ and proprietor of a large shipyard at Bordeaux, for the
construction of ironclad ships of war.Sandra journeyed to the garden.Slidell had already received
assurances from persons in the confidence of Napoleon III that the
building of the ships in the French yards would not be interfered with,
and that getting them to sea would be connived at by the Government.Owing
to the indubitable proof laid before the Emperor by the Federal diplomats
at Paris, he was compelled to revoke the guarantee that had been given to
Slidell and Bulloch.A plan was arranged, however, by which M. Arman
should sell the vessels to various European powers; and he disposed of the
ironclad ram "Sphinx" to the Danish Government, then at war with Prussia.Delivery of the ship at Copenhagen was not made, however, till after the
war had ceased, and no trouble was experienced by the Confederates in
arranging for the purchase of the vessel.On January 24, 1865, she
rendezvoused off Quiberon, on the French coast; the remainder of her
officers, crew, and supplies were put aboard of her; the Confederate flag
was hoisted over her, and she was christened the "Stonewall."Already the
vessel was discovered to have sprung a leak, and Captain Page ran into
Ferrol, Spain.Here dock-yard facilities were at first granted, but were
withdrawn at the protest of the American Minister.While Captain Page was
repairing his vessel as best he could, the "Niagara" and the "Sacramento"
appeared, and after some weeks the "Stonewall" offered battle in vain.[Illustration]

THE LAST INVASION OF TENNESSEE--FRANKLIN--NASHVILLE


In the latter days of September, 1864, the Confederate Army of Tennessee
lay in the vicinity of Macon, Georgia.It was a dispirited body of men,
homesick and discouraged.For four long months, first under one leader and
then under another, it had opposed, step by step, Sherman's advance toward
Atlanta, and now that important strategic point was in the hands of the
Federal forces.About the middle of July the President of the Confederacy
had seen fit to remove Joseph E. Johnston from the command and replace him
with John B. Hood.The latter's habit of mind and methods of action led
the Richmond authorities to believe that he would proceed very differently
from Johnston, and in this he did not disappoint them.The results showed
that Johnston's Fabian policy was by far the better one under the
circumstances.Sherman had the stronger army, but he was compelled
constantly to detach portions of it in order to guard his lengthening line
of supplies.The one thing he desired most was that his opponent should
assume an aggressive attitude.Hood's idea was precipitation rather than
patience, and in consequence on the 2d of September General Slocum entered
the coveted city.On the 22d of that month President Davis visited the Southern Army, and
made a memorable address to the troops.He promised them--and they were
delighted at the news--that they would soon be back in Tennessee, for a
fresh invasion of that State had been planned.This would, declared the
speaker, place Sherman in a worse predicament than that in which Napoleon
found himself at Moscow.But the Federal general had at least the
advantage of learning what was going to happen to him, for the President's
words were reported verbatim in the Southern papers, and he prepared to
meet his antagonists.Thomas, with the Army of the Cumberland, was sent to
Nashville while Schofield, with his smaller force known as the Army of the
Ohio, returned to Knoxville where he had spent the previous winter, to
await Hood's advance.By the 1st of October the latter was across the
Chattahoochee in the hope of drawing Sherman from Atlanta.There was a
brave fight at Allatoona where General Corse "held the fort," but Sherman,
although he followed the Confederate army, was unable to bring on a
general engagement.His great plan of a march through Georgia to the sea was now fully formed
in his mind.He had not yet obtained Grant's sanction to the scheme, but
he ordered Schofield to cooperate with Thomas and sent the Fourth Corps as
further assistance.He himself ceased the pursuit of Hood at Gaylesville
and turned back to Atlanta, confident that the fate of Tennessee was safe
in the hands of his ablest lieutenant, George H. Thomas.Hood appeared on
the 26th of October at Decatur on the south bank of the Tennessee River.Lack of supplies had delayed his advance, but even so his performances had
greatly alarmed the North.Twice had he interposed between Sherman and the
Federal base and had destroyed many miles of railway, but what in other
circumstances would have placed the Union leader in a dangerous
predicament was now of little moment, since the latter was rapidly making
preparations to cut himself off from all communication with the source of
his supplies.It was necessary that Hood should have the assistance of
Forrest, whose dauntless cavalry had been playing great havoc with the
Federal stores in western Tennessee, so he moved to Florence before
crossing the river, and here Forrest joined him on November 14th.In the
meantime, Schofield, with about twenty-eight thousand men, had reached
Pulaski on the way to encounter the Southern advance.Now began a series of brilliant strategic moves, kept up for a fortnight
before the two small armies--they were of almost equal strength met in
one awful clash.Hood's efforts were bent toward cutting Schofield off
from Thomas at Nashville.There was a mad race for the Duck River, and the
Federals got over at Columbia in the very nick of time.The Southern
leader, by a skilful piece of strategy and a forced march, pushed on to
Spring Hill ahead of his opponent.He was in an excellent position to
annihilate General Stanley who was in advance, and then crush the
remainder of the Federals who were moving with the slow wagon-trains.But
owing to a number of strange mishaps, which brought forth much
recrimination but no satisfactory explanation, the Union army slipped by
with little damage and entrenched itself at Franklin on the Harpeth River.Of all the dark days of Confederate history--and they were many--the 29th
of November, 1864, has been mourned as that of "lost opportunities."Schofield did not expect, or desire, a battle at Franklin, but he was
treated to one the following afternoon when the Confederates came up, and
it was of the most severe nature.The first attack was made as the light
began to wane, and the Federal troops stood their ground although the
orders had been to withdraw, because through some blunder two brigades in
blue had been stationed, unsupported, directly in front of Hood's
approach.The stubborn resistance of Schofield's army only increased the
ardor of the opponents.It is said that thirteen separate assaults were
made upon the Union entrenchments, and the fearful carnage was finally
carried into the streets and among the dooryards of the little town.At
nine o'clock the fury of the iron storm was quelled.Five Confederate
generals, including the gallant Cleburne, lay dead upon the field.In two
of the Southern brigades all the general officers were either killed or
wounded.Hood's loss was about sixty-three hundred, nearly three times
that of Schofield.By midnight the latter was on his way, uninterrupted,
to Nashville.Meanwhile Thomas was performing a herculean task within the
fortifications of that capital city.He had received a large number of
raw recruits and a motley collection of troops from garrisons in the West.These had to be drilled into an efficient army, and not one move to fight
would Thomas make until this had been done.Grant, in Virginia, grew
impatient and the Northern papers clamored for an attack on Hood, who had
now arrived with thirty-eight thousand men before the city.Finally Grant
took action, and General Logan was hurrying to assume the Federal command.But by the time he reached Louisville there was no need for his services.Thomas had for some days been ready with his force of forty-five thousand,
but to increase the difficulties of his position, a severe storm of
freezing rain made action impossible until the morning of December 15th.The Union lines of defense were in a semi-circle and Hood was on the
southeast, lightly entrenched.The first assault on his right wing
followed by one on his left, forced the Confederates back to a second
position two miles to the south, and that was the first day's work.Hood
had detached a part of his forces and he did all he could to gain time
until he might recover his full strength.But he had respite only until
Thomas was ready on the morrow, which was about noon.The Union army
deployed in front of the Southerners and overlapped their left wing.An
attack on the front was bravely met and repulsed by the Confederates, and
the Federal leader, extending his right, compelled his opponent to stretch
his own lines more and more.Finally they broke just to the left of the
center, and a general forward movement on the Union side ended in the
utter rout of the splendid and courageous Army of Tennessee.It melted away in disorder; the pursuit was vigorous, and only a small
portion reassembled at Columbia and fell back with a poor show of order
behind the Tennessee.Many military historians have seen in the battle of Nashville the most
crushing defeat of the war.Certainly no other brought such complete ruin
upon a large and well-organized body of troops.[Illustration: RUSHING A FEDERAL BATTERY OUT OF JOHNSONVILLE

he ordered the garrison at Johnsonville, on the Tennessee, eighty miles
due west of Nashville, to leave that place and hasten north.It was the
garrison at this same Johnsonville that, a month earlier, had been
frightened into panic and flight when the bold Confederate raider,
Forrest, appeared on the west bank of the river and began a noisy
cannonade.The day after the photograph was taken (November 23d) the
encampment in the picture was broken.[Illustration: FORT NEGLEY, LOOKING TOWARD THE CONFEDERATE CENTER AND

THE SIEGE AND FALL OF PETERSBURG

    It is not improbable that Grant might have made more headway by
    leaving a sufficient part of his army in the trenches in front of
    Petersburg and by moving with a heavy force far to the west upon Lee's
    communications; or, if it were determined to capture the place _a main
    forte_, by making a massed attack upon some point in the center after
    suitable mining operations had weakened Lee's defenses and prepared
    for such an operation.But the end was to come with opening spring.To
    the far-sighted, this was no longer doubtful.The South must succumb
    to the greater material resources of the North, despite its courage
    and its sacrifices.--_Colonel T. A. Dodge, U. S. A., in "A Bird's-Eye
    View of Our Civil War."_


During the winter of 1864-65, General Lee, fighting Grant without, was
fighting famine within.The shivering, half-clad soldiers of the South
crouched over feeble fires in their entrenchments.The men were exposed to
the rain, snow, and sleet; sickness and disease soon added their horrors
to the desolation.The
life of the Confederacy was ebbing fast.Behind Union breastworks, early in 1865, General Grant was making
preparations for the opening of a determined campaign with the coming of
spring.Mile after mile had been added to his entrenchments, and they now
extended to Hatcher's Run on the left.The Confederate lines had been
stretched until they were so thin that there was constant danger of
breaking.A. P. Hill was posted on the right; Gordon and Anderson held the
center, and Longstreet was on the left.Union troops were mobilizing in
front of Petersburg.By February 1st, Sherman was fairly off from Savannah
on his northward march to join Grant.He was weak in cavalry and Grant
determined to bring Sheridan from the Shenandoah, whence the bulk of
Early's forces had been withdrawn, and send him to assist Sherman.Sheridan left Winchester February 27th, wreaking much destruction as he
advanced, but circumstances compelled him to seek a new base at White
House.On March 27th he formed a junction with the armies of the Potomac
and the James.Such were the happenings that prompted Lee to prepare for
the evacuation of Petersburg.And he might be able, in his rapid marches,
to outdistance Grant, join his forces with those of Johnston, fall on
Sherman, destroy one wing of the Union army and arouse the hopes of his
soldiers, and prolong the life of his Government.General Grant knew the condition of Lee's army and, with the unerring
instinct of a military leader, surmised what the plan of the Southern
general must be.He decided to move on the left, destroy both the Danville
and South Side railroads, and put his army in better condition to pursue.General Lee, in order to get Grant to look another way for a while,
decided to attack Grant's line on the right, and gain some of the works.This would compel Grant to draw some of his force from his left and secure
a way of escape to the west.This bold plan was left for execution to the
gallant Georgian, General John B. Gordon, who had successfully led the
reverse attack at Cedar Creek, in the Shenandoah, in October, 1864.Near
the crater stood Fort Stedman.Between it and the Confederate front, a
distance of about one hundred and fifty yards, was a strip of firm earth,
in full view of both picket lines.Across this space some deserters had
passed to the Union entrenchments.General Gordon took advantage of this
fact and accordingly selected his men, who, at the sound of the signal
gun, should disarm the Federal pickets, while fifty more men were to cross
the open space quickly with axes and cut away the abatis, and three
hundred others were to rush through the opening, and capture the fort and
guns.At four o'clock on the morning of March 25, 1865, Gordon had everything in
readiness.His chosen band wore white strips of cloth across the breast,
that they might distinguish each other in the hand-to-hand fight that
would doubtless ensue.Behind these men half of Lee's army was massed to
support the attack.In the silence of the early morning, a gunshot rang
out from the Confederate works.Not a Federal picket-shot was heard.The
axemen rushed across the open and soon the thuds of their axes told of the
cutting away of the abatis.The three hundred surged through the entrance,
overpowered the gunners, captured batteries to the right and to the left,
and were in control of the situation.Gordon's corps of about five
thousand was on hand to sustain the attack but the remaining reserves,
through failure of the guides, did not come, and the general found himself
cut off with a rapidly increasing army surrounding him.Fort Haskell, on the left, began to throw its shells.Under its cover,
heavy columns of Federals sent by General Parke, now commanding the Ninth
Corps, pressed forward.The Confederates resisted the charge, and from the
captured Fort Stedman and the adjoining batteries poured volley after
volley on Willcox's advancing lines of blue.The Northerners fell back,
only to re-form and renew the attack.This time they secured a footing,
and for twenty minutes the fighting was terrific.Then across the brow of the hill swept the command of Hartranft.The furious musketry, and
artillery directed by General Tidball, shrivelled up the ranks of Gordon
until they fled from the fort and its neighboring batteries in the midst
of withering fire, and those who did not were captured.This was the last
aggressive effort of the expiring Confederacy in front of Petersburg, and
it cost three thousand men.The affair at Fort Stedman did not turn Grant from his plans against the
Confederate right.With the railroads here destroyed, Richmond would be
completely cut off.On the morning of the 29th, as previously arranged,
the movement began.Sheridan swept to the south with his cavalry, as if he
were to fall upon the railroads.General Warren, with fifteen thousand
men, was working his way through the tangled woods and low swamps in the
direction of Lee's right.At the same time, Lee stripped his entrenchments
at Petersburg as much as he dared and hurried General Anderson, with
infantry, and Fitzhugh Lee, with cavalry, forward to hold the roads over
which he hoped to escape.On Friday morning, March 31st, the opposing
forces, the Confederates much reenforced, found themselves at Dinwiddie
Court House.The woods and swamps prevented the formation of a regular
line of battle.Lee made his accustomed flank movement, with heavy loss to
the Federals as they tried to move in the swampy forests.The Northerners
finally were ready to advance when it was found that Lee had fallen back.During the day and night, reenforcements were coming in from all sides.The Confederates had taken their position at Five Forks.Early the next afternoon, the 1st of April, Sheridan, reenforced by
Warren, was arranging his troops for battle.The day was nearly spent when
all was in readiness.The sun was not more than two hours high when the
Northern army moved toward that of the South, defended by a breastwork
behind a dense undergrowth of pines.Through this mass of timber the
Federals crept with bayonets fixed.They charged upon the Confederates,
but, at the same time, a galling fire poured into them from the left,
spreading dismay and destruction in their midst.The intrepid Sheridan
urged his black battle-charger, the famous Rienzi, now known as
Winchester, up and down the lines, cheering his men on in the fight.He
seemed to be everywhere at once.The Confederate left was streaming down
the White Oak Road.But General Crawford had reached a cross-road, by
taking a circuitous route, and the Southern army was thus shut off from
retreat.The Federal cavalry had dismounted and was doing its full share
of work.The Confederates soon found themselves trapped, and the part of
their army in action that day was nearly annihilated.With night came the news of the crushing blow to Lee.General Grant was
seated by his camp-fire surrounded by his staff, when a courier dashed
into his presence with the message of victory.Soon from every great gun
along the Union line belched forth the sheets of flame.The earth shook
with the awful cannonade.Mortar shells made huge parabolas through the
air.The Union batteries crept closer and closer to the Confederate lines
and the balls crashed into the streets of the doomed city.At dawn of the 2nd of April the grand assault began.The Federal troops
sprang forward with a rush.Despite the storms of grape and canister, the
Sixth Corps plunged through the battery smoke, and across the walls,
pushing the brave defenders to the inner works.The whole corps penetrated
the lines and swept everything before it toward Hatcher's Run.Some of the
troops even reached the South Side Railroad, where the brave General A. P.
Hill fell mortally wounded.Everywhere, the blue masses poured into the works.General Ord, on the
right of the Sixth Corps, helped to shut the Confederate right into the
city.General Parke, with the Ninth Corps, carried the main line.The thin
gray line could no longer stem the tide that was engulfing it.The
Confederate troops south of Hatcher's Run fled to the west, and fought
General Miles until General Sheridan and a division from Meade appeared on
the scene.By noon the Federals held the line of the outer works from Fort
Gregg to the Appomattox.The last stronghold carried was Fort Gregg, at
which the men of Gibbon's corps had one of the most desperate struggles of
the war.The Confederates now fell back to the inner fortifications and
the siege of Petersburg came to an end.[Illustration: A BATTERED RELIC OF COLONIAL DAYS IN PETERSBURG

look, as if wondering why it should have received such buffetings as its

the visitation of the falling shells fit habitations for mankind.Many of
these handsome residences were utterly destroyed, their fixtures shattered
beyond repair; their wainscoting, built when the Commonwealth of Virginia
was ruled over by the representative of King George, was torn from the
walls and, bursting into flames, made a funeral pyre of past comforts and
magnificence.The havoc wrought upon the dwellings of the town was heavy;
certain localities suffered more than others, and those residents who
seemed to dwell in the safest zones had been ever ready to open their
houses to the sick and wounded of Lee's army.As Grant's troops marched
in, many pale faces gazed out at them from the windows, and at the
doorsteps stood men whose wounds exempted them from ever bearing arms
again.[Illustration: THE SHATTERED DOORWAY

time, Lee entrusted the last desperate effort to break through the
tightening Federal lines, March 25, 1865.Lee was confronted by the
dilemma of either being starved out of Petersburg and Richmond, or of
getting out himself and uniting his army to that of Johnston in North
Carolina to crush Sherman before Grant could reach him.Gordon was to
begin this latter, almost impossible, task by an attack on Fort Stedman,
which the Confederates believed to be the weakest point in the Federal
fortifications.The position had been captured from them in the beginning,
and they knew that the nature of the ground and its nearness to their own
lines had made it difficult to strengthen it very much.It was planned to
surprise the fort before daylight.Below are seen the rabbit-like burrows
of Gracie's Salient, past which Gordon led his famished men.When the
order came to go forward, they did not flinch, but hurled themselves
bravely against fortifications far stronger than their own.Three columns
of a hundred picked men each moved down the <DW72> shown on the left and
advanced in the darkness against Stedman.They were to be followed by a
division.Through the gap which the storming parties were expected to open
in the Federal lines, Gordon's columns would rush in both directions and a
cavalry force was to sweep on and destroy the pontoon bridges across the
Appomattox and to raid City Point, breaking up the Federal base.It was no
light task, for although Fort Stedman itself was weak, it was flanked by
Battery No.An
attacking party on the right would be exposed to an enfilading fire in
crossing the plain; while on the left the approach was difficult be cause
of ravines, one of which the Confederate engineers had turned into a pond
by damming a creek.All night long General Gordon's wife, with the brave
women of Petersburg, sat up tearing strips of white cloth, to be tied on
the arms of the men in the storming parties so that they could tell friend
from foe in the darkness and confusion of the assault.Before the
sleep-dazed Federals could offer effective resistance, Gordon's men had
possession of the fort and the batteries.Only after one of the severest
engagements of the siege were the Confederates driven back.[Illustration: GRACIE'S SALIENT--AFTER GORDON'S FORLORN HOPE HAD CHARGED]


APRIL SECOND--"THIS IS A SAD BUSINESS"

As his general watched, this boy fought to stem the Federal rush--but
fell, his breast pierced by a bayonet, in the trenches of Fort Mahone.It
is heart-rending to look at a picture such as this; it is sad to think of
it and to write about it.Here is a boy of only fourteen years, his face
innocent of a razor, his feet unshod and stockingless in the bitter April
weather.It is to be hoped that the man who slew him has forgotten it, for
this face would haunt him surely.Many who fought in the blue ranks were
young, but in the South there were whole companies made up of such boys as
this.At the battle of Newmarket the scholars of the Virgina Military
Institute, the eldest seventeen and the youngest twelve, marched from the
classrooms under arms, joined the forces of General Breckinridge, and
aided by their historic charge to gain a brilliant victory over the
Federal General Sigel.The never-give-in spirit was implanted in the youth
of the Confederacy, as well as in the hearts of the grizzled veterans.Lee
had inspired them, but in addition to this inspiration, as General Gordon
writes, "every man of them was supported by their extraordinary
consecration, resulting from the conviction that he was fighting in the
defense of home and the rights of his State.Hence their unfaltering faith
in the justice of the cause, their fortitude in the extremest privations,
their readiness to stand shoeless and shivering in the trenches at night
and to face any danger at their leader's call."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.APPOMATTOX

    I now come to what I have always regarded--shall ever regard--as the
    most creditable episode in all American history--an episode without a
    blemish, imposing, dignified, simple, heroic.Two men met that day, representative of American civilization, the
    whole world looking on.The two were Grant and Lee--types each.Both
    rose, and rose unconsciously, to the full height of the occasion--and
    than that occasion there has been none greater.About it, and them,
    there was no theatrical display, no self-consciousness, no effort at
    effect.A great crisis was to be met; and they met that crisis as
    great countrymen should.Consider the possibilities; think for a
    moment of what that day might have been; you will then see cause to
    thank God for much.--_General Charles Francis Adams, U. S. V., in Phi
    Beta Kappa Address delivered at the University of Chicago, June 17,
    1902._


We are now to witness the closing scene of one of the greatest tragedies
ever enacted on the world's stage.Many and varied had been the scenes
during the war; the actors and their parts had been real.The wounds of
the South were bleeding; the North was awaiting the decisive blow.Fortunes, great and small, had melted away
by the hundreds of millions.In Richmond, the citadel of the waning
Confederacy, the people were starving.The Southern army, half clad and
without food, was but a shadow of its once proud self.Bravely and long
the men in gray had followed their adored leader.Now the limit of
endurance had been reached.It was the second day of April, 1865.Lee realized that after Petersburg
his beloved Richmond must fall.The order was given for the movement to
begin at eight o'clock that night.The darkness of the early morning of
the 3d was suddenly transformed into a lurid light overcasting the
heavens for miles around the famous city whose name had became a
household word over the civilized world.The
capital of the Confederacy, the pride of the South, toward which the Army
of the Potomac had fought its way, leaving a trail of blood for four weary
years, had at last succumbed to the overwhelming power of Grant's
indomitable armies.President Davis had received a despatch while attending services at St.Paul's church, Sunday morning, the 2d, advising him that the city must be
evacuated that night, and, leaving the church at once, he hastened the
preparations for flight with his personal papers and the archives of the
Confederate Government.During that Sabbath day and night Richmond was in
a state of riot.There had been an unwarranted feeling of security in the
city, and the unwelcome news, spreading like an electric flash, was
paralyzing and disastrous in its effect.Prisoners were released from
their toils, a lawless mob overran the thoroughfares, and civic government
was nullified.One explosion after another, on the morning of the 3d, rent
the air with deafening roar, as the magazines took fire.The scene was one
of terror and grandeur.The flames spread to the city from the ships, bridges, and arsenal, which
had been set on fire, and hundreds of buildings, including the best
residential section of the capital of the Confederacy, were destroyed.When the Union army entered the city in the morning, thousands of the
inhabitants, men, women, and children, were gathered at street corners and
in the parks, in wildest confusion.The commissary depot had been broken
open by the starving mob, and rifled of its contents, until the place was
reached by the spreading flames.The Federal soldiers stacked arms, and
heroically battled with the fire, drafting into the work all able-bodied
men found in the city.The invaders extinguished the flames, and soon
restored the city to a state of order and safety.The invalid wife of
General Lee, who was exposed to danger, was furnished with an ambulance
and corporal's guard until the danger was past.President Lincoln, who had visited Grant at Petersburg, entered Richmond
on the 4th of April.He visited President Davis' house, and Libby Prison,
then deserted, and held a conference with prominent citizens and army
officers of the Confederacy.The President seemed deeply concerned and
weighted down with the realization of the great responsibilities that
would fall upon him after the war.Only ten days later the nation was
shaken from ocean to ocean by the tragic news of his assassination.General Lee had started on his last march by eight o'clock on the night of
the 2d.By midnight the evacuation of both Petersburg and Richmond was
completed.For nine months the invincible forces of Lee had kept a foe of
more than twice their numerical strength from invading their stronghold,
and only after a long and harassing siege were they forced to retreat.They saw the burning city as their line of march was illuminated by the
conflagration, and emotions too deep for words overcame them.The woods
and fields, in their fresh, bright colors of spring, were in sharp
contrast to the travel-worn, weather-beaten, ragged veterans passing over
the verdant plain.Lee hastened the march of his troops to Amelia Court
House, where he had ordered supplies, but by mistake the train of supplies
had been sent on to Richmond.This was a crushing blow to the hungry men,
who had been stimulated on their tiresome march by the anticipation of
much-needed food.The fatality of war was now hovering over them like a
huge black specter.General Grant did not proceed to Richmond, but leaving General Weitzel to
invest the city, he hastened in pursuit of Lee to intercept the retreating
army.This pursuit was started early on the 3d.On the evening of that
date there was some firing between the pursuing army and Lee's rear guard.It was Lee's design to concentrate his force at Amelia Court House, but
this was not to be accomplished by the night of the 4th.Not until the 5th
was the whole army up, and then it was discovered that no adequate
supplies were within less than fifty miles.Subsistence could be obtained
only by foraging parties.No word of complaint from the suffering men
reached their commander, and on the evening of that disappointing day they
patiently and silently began the sad march anew.Their course was through
unfavorable territory and necessarily slow.The Federals were gaining upon
their retreating columns.Sheridan's cavalry had reached their flank, and
on the 6th there was heavy skirmishing.In the afternoon the Federals had
arrived in force sufficient to bring on an engagement with Ewell's corps
in the rear, at Sailor's Creek, a tributary of the Appomattox River.Ewell
was surrounded by the Federals and the entire corps captured.General
Anderson, commanding the divisions of Pickett and Johnson, was attacked
and fought bravely, losing many men.In all about six thousand Confederate
soldiers were left in the hands of the pursuing army.On the night of the 6th, the remainder of the Confederate army continued
the retreat and arrived at Farmville, where the men received two days'
rations, the first food except raw or parched corn that had been given
them for two days.Again the tedious journey was resumed, in the hope of
breaking through the rapidly-enmeshing net and forming a junction with
Johnston at Danville, or of gaining the protected region of the mountains
near Lynchburg.But the progress of the weak and weary marchers was slow
and the Federal cavalry had swept around to Lee's front, and a halt was
necessary to check the pursuing Federals.On the evening of the 8th, Lee
reached Appomattox Court House.Here ended the last march of the Army of
Northern Virginia.General Lee and his officers held a council of war on the night of the 8th
and it was decided to make an effort to cut their way through the Union
lines on the morning of the next day.On the 7th, while at Farmville, on
the south side of the Appomattox River, Grant sent to Lee a courteous
request for the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, based on the
hopelessness of further resistance on the part of that army.In reply, Lee
expressed sympathy with Grant's desire to avoid useless effusion of blood
and asked the terms of surrender.The next morning General Grant replied to Lee, urging that a meeting be
designated by Lee, and specifying the terms of surrender, to which Lee
replied promptly, rejecting those terms, which were, that the Confederates
lay down their arms, and the men and officers be disqualified for taking
up arms against the Government of the United States until properly
exchanged.When Grant read Lee's letter he shook his head in
disappointment and said, "It looks as if Lee still means to fight; I will
reply in the morning."On the 9th Grant addressed another communication to Lee, repeating the
terms of surrender, and closed by saying, "The terms upon which peace can
be had are well understood.By the South laying down their arms they will
hasten that most desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and
hundreds of millions of property not yet destroyed.Sincerely hoping that
all our difficulties may be settled without the loss of another life, I
subscribe myself, etc."There remained for Lee the bare possibility, by desperate fighting, of
breaking through the Federal lines in his rear.To Gordon's corps was
assigned the task of advancing on Sheridan's strongly supported front.Since Pickett's charge at Gettysburg there had been no more hopeless
movement in the annals of the war.It was not merely that Gordon was
overwhelmingly outnumbered by the opposing forces, but his
hunger-enfeebled soldiers, even if successful in the first onslaught,
could count on no effective support, for Longstreet's corps was in even
worse condition than his own.Nevertheless, on the morning of Sunday, the
9th, the attempt was made.Gordon was fighting his corps, as he said, "to
a frazzle," when Lee came at last to a realizing sense of the futility of
it all and ordered a truce.A meeting with Grant was soon arranged on the
basis of the letters already exchanged.The conference of the two
world-famous commanders took place at Appomattox, a small settlement with
only one street, but to be made historic by this meeting.Lee was awaiting
Grant's arrival at the house of Wilmer McLean.It was here, surrounded by
staff-officers, that the terms were written by Grant for the final
surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.The terms, and their
acceptance, were embodied in the following letters, written and signed in
the famous "brick house" on that memorable Sunday:

    APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the
    8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of
    Northern Virginia on the following terms, to wit: Rolls of all the
    officers and men to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an
    officer to be designated by me, the other to be retained by such
    officer or officers as you may designate.The officers to give their
    individual paroles not to take up arms against the Government of the
    United States until properly exchanged; and each company or regimental
    commander to sign a like parole for the men of their commands.The
    arms, artillery, and public property to be parked and stacked, and
    turned over to the officers appointed by me to receive them.This will
    not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor their private horses or
    baggage.This done, each officer and man will be allowed to return to
    his home, not to be disturbed by the United States authority so long
    as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may
    reside.U. S. GRANT, _Lieutenant-General_.HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: I have received your letter of this date containing the terms
    of the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.As they are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter
    of the 8th instant, they are accepted.I will proceed to designate the
    proper officers to carry the stipulation into effect.R. E. LEE, _General_.Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant.When Federal officers were seen galloping toward the Union lines from
Appomattox Court House it was quickly surmised that Lee had surrendered.Cheer after cheer was sent up by the long lines throughout their entire
length; caps and tattered colors were waved in the air.Officers and men
alike joined in the enthusiastic outburst.It was glad tidings, indeed, to
these men, who had fought and hoped and suffered through the long bloody
years.When Grant returned to his headquarters and heard salutes being fired he
ordered it stopped at once, saying, "The war is over; the rebels are our
countrymen again; and the best sign of rejoicing after the victory will be
to abstain from all demonstration in the field."Details of the surrender were arranged on the next day by staff-officers
of the respective armies.The parole officers were instructed by General
Grant to permit the Confederate soldiers to retain their own horses--a
concession that was most welcome to many of the men, who had with them
animals brought from the home farm early in the war.There were only twenty-eight thousand men to be paroled, and of these
fewer than one-third were actually bearing arms on the day of the
surrender.The Confederate losses of the last ten days of fighting
probably exceeded ten thousand.The Confederate supplies had been captured by Sheridan, and Lee's army was
almost at the point of starvation.An order from Grant caused the rations
of the Federal soldiers to be shared with the "Johnnies," and the
victorious "Yanks" were only too glad to tender such hospitality as was
within their power.These acts of kindness were slight in themselves, but
they helped immeasurably to restore good feeling and to associate for all
time with Appomattox the memory of reunion rather than of strife.The
things that were done there can never be the cause of shame to any
American.The noble and dignified bearing of the commanders was an example
to their armies and to the world that quickly had its effect in the
genuine reconciliation that followed.The scene between Lee and his devoted army was profoundly touching.General Long in his "Memoirs of Lee" says: "It is impossible to describe
the anguish of the troops when it was known that the surrender of the army
was inevitable.Of all their trials, this was the greatest and hardest to
endure."As Lee rode along the lines of the tried and faithful men who had
been with him at the Wilderness, at Spotsylvania, and at Cold Harbor, it
was not strange that those ragged, weather-beaten heroes were moved by
deep emotion and that tears streamed down their bronzed and scarred faces.Their general in broken accents admonished them to go to their homes and
be as brave citizens as they had been soldiers.Thus ended the greatest civil war in history, for soon after the fall of
the Confederate capital and the surrender of Lee's army, there followed in
quick succession the surrender of all the remaining Southern forces.While these stirring events were taking place in Virginia, Sherman, who
had swept up through the Carolinas with the same dramatic brilliancy that
marked his march to the sea, accomplishing most effective work against
Johnston, was at Goldsboro.When Johnston learned of the fall of Richmond
and Lee's surrender he knew the end had come and he soon arranged for the
surrender of his army on the terms agreed upon at Appomattox.In the first
week of May General "Dick" Taylor surrendered his command near Mobile, and
on the 10th of the same month, President Jefferson Davis, who had been for
nearly six weeks a fugitive, was overtaken and made a prisoner near
Irwinsville, Georgia.The Southern Confederacy was a thing of the past.[Illustration: MEN ABOUT TO WITNESS APPOMATTOX

No photographer was present at Appomattox, that supreme moment in our
national history, when Americans met for the last time as foes on the
field.Nothing but fanciful sketches exist of the scene inside the McLean
home.But here is a photograph that shows most of the Union officers
present at the conference.Nine of the twelve men standing above stood
also at the signing of Lee's surrender, a few days later.The scene is
City Point, in March, 1865.Grant is surrounded by a group of the officers
who had served him so faithfully.At the surrender, it was Colonel T. S.
Bowers (third from left) upon whom Grant called to make a copy of the
terms of surrender in ink.Colonel E. S. Parker, the full-blooded Indian
on Grant's staff, an excellent penman, wrote out the final copy.Nineteen
years later, General Horace Porter recorded with pride that he loaned
General Lee a pencil to make a correction in the terms.Colonels William
Duff and J. D. Webster, and General M. R. Patrick, are the three men who
were not present at the interview.All of the remaining officers were
formally presented to Lee.General Seth Williams had been Lee's adjutant
when the latter was superintendent at West Point some years before the
war.In the lower photograph General Grant stands between General Rawlins
and Colonel Bowers.The veins standing out on the back of his hand are
plainly visible.No one but he could have told how calmly the blood
coursed through them during the four tremendous years.[Illustration: GRANT BETWEEN RAWLINS AND BOWERS]


[Illustration: IN PETERSBURG--AFTER NINE MONTHS OF BATTERING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This fine mansion on Bolingbroke Street, the residential section of
Petersburg, has now, on the 3d of April, fallen into the hands of
straggling Union soldiers.Its windows have long since been shattered by
shells from distant Federal mortars; one has even burst through the wall.But it was not till the night of April 2d, when the retreat of the
Confederate forces started, that the citizens began to leave their homes.At 9 o'clock in the morning General Grant, surrounded by his staff, rode
quietly into the city.At length they arrived
at a comfortable home standing back in a yard.There he dismounted and sat
for a while on the piazza.Soon a group of curious citizens gathered on
the sidewalk to gaze at the commander of the Yankee armies.But the Union
troops did not remain long in the deserted homes.Sheridan was already in
pursuit south of the Appomattox, and Grant, after a short conference with
Lincoln, rode to the west in the rear of the hastily marching troops.Bolingbroke Street and Petersburg soon returned to the ordinary
occupations of peace in an effort to repair the ravages of the historic
nine months' siege.[Illustration: APPOMATTOX STATION--LEE'S LAST ATTEMPT TO PROVISION HIS

upon them, having reached the spot by a by-road leading from the Red
House.After a few shots the Confederates fled in confusion.The cavalry
drove them on in the direction of Appomattox Court House, capturing many
prisoners, twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train, and a large
pack of wagons.This was Lee's last effort to obtain food for his army.[Illustration: FEDERAL SOLDIERS WHO PERFORMED ONE OF THE LAST DUTIES AT

The sad significance of these photographs is all too apparent.Not only
the bank buildings were in ruins, but the financial system of the entire
South.All available capital had been consumed by the demands of the war,
and a system of paper currency had destroyed credit completely.Worse
still was the demoralization of all industry.Through large areas of the
South all mills and factories were reduced to ashes, and everywhere the
industrial system was turned topsy-turvy.Truly the problem that
confronted the South was stupendous.[Illustration: WRECK OF THE GALLEGO FLOUR MILLS

was the purpose of the South to accept the issues of the war and to
restore as far as in them lay the bases for an enduring prosperity.The
same devotion which manned these guns so bravely and prolonged the contest
as long as it was possible for human powers to endure, was now directed to
the new problems which the cessation of hostilities had provided.The
restored Union came with the years to possess for the South a significance
to be measured only by the thankfulness that the outcome had been what it
was and by the pride in the common traditions and common blood of the
whole American people.These captured guns are a memory therefore, not of
regret, but of recognition, gratitude, that the highest earthly tribunal
settled all strife in 1865.[Illustration: COEHORNS, MORTARS, LIGHT AND HEAVY GUNS]


[Illustration: LINCOLN THE LAST SITTING--ON THE DAY OF LEE'S SURRENDER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On April 9, 1865, the very day of the surrender of Lee at Appomattox,
Lincoln, for the last time, went to the photographer's gallery.As he sits
in simple fashion sharpening his pencil, the man of sorrows cannot forget
the sense of weariness and pain that for four years has been unbroken.No
elation of triumph lights the features.One task is ended--the Nation is
saved.But another, scarcely less exacting, confronts him.The States
which lay "out of their proper practical relation to the Union," in his
own phrase, must be brought back into a proper practical relation.Only five days later the sad eyes reflected
upon this page closed forever upon scenes of earthly turmoil.Bereft of
Lincoln's heart and head, leaders attacked problems of reconstruction in
ways that proved unwise.As the mists of passion and prejudice cleared
away, both North and South came to feel that this patient, wise, and
sympathetic ruler was one of the few really great men in history, and that
he would live forever in the hearts of men made better by his presence
during those four years of storm.[Illustration: THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIERS--THE GRAND REVIEW

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.One of the proudest days of the nation--May 24, 1865--here lives again.The true greatness of the American people was not displayed till the close
of the war.The citizen from the walks of humble life had during the
contest become a veteran soldier, equal in courage and fighting capacity
to the best drilled infantry of Marlborough, Frederick the Great, or
Napoleon.But it remained to be seen whether he would return peacefully to
the occupations of peace."Would
nearly a million men," they asked, "one of the mightiest military
organizations ever trained in war, quietly lay aside this resistless power
and disappear into the unnoted walks of civil life?"The disbanded veterans
lent the effectiveness of military order and discipline to the industrial
and commercial development of the land they had come to love with an
increased devotion.The pictures are of Sherman's troops marching down
Pennsylvania Avenue.The horsemen in the lead are General Francis P. Blair
and his staff, and the infantry in flashing new uniforms are part of the
Seventeenth Corps in the Army of Tennessee.Little over a year before,
they had started with Sherman on his series of battles and flanking
marches in the struggle for Atlanta.They had taken a conspicuous and
important part in the battle of July 22d east of Atlanta, receiving and
finally repulsing attacks in both front and rear.They had marched with
Sherman to the sea and participated in the capture of Savannah.They had
joined in the campaign through the Carolinas, part of the time leading the
advance and tearing up many miles of railway track, and operating on the
extreme right after the battle of Bentonville.After the negotiations for
Johnston's surrender were completed in April, they set out on the march
for the last time with flying colors and martial music, to enter the
memorable review at Washington in May, here preserved.[Illustration: THE SAME SCENE, A FEW SECONDS LATER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The coach
  in question was entirely destroyed and eight passengers were either
  burned or suffocated, while no less than thirteen others sustained
  injuries in jumping from the train.As no better illustration than this can be found of the extreme
slowness with which the necessity for new railroad appliances is
recognized in cases where profit is not involved, and of the value
of wholesale slaughters, like those at Shipton and Angola, as a
species of motive force in the direction of progress, a digression
on the subject of English accidents due to the absence of bell-cords
may be not without value.In the opinion of the railway managers the
cases referred to by the Board of Trade officials failed to show
the existence of any necessity for providing means of communication
between portions of the train.A detailed statement of a few of
the cases thus referred to will not only be found interesting in
itself, but it will give some idea of the description of evidence
which is considered insufficient.The circumstances of the Briggs
murder, deeply interesting as they were, are too long for incidental
statement; this, however, is not the case with some of the other
occurrences.For instance, the Board of Trade circular was issued on
July 30th; on July 7th, a year earlier, the following took place on
the London & North Western road.Two gentlemen took their seats at Liverpool in one of the
compartments of the express train to London.In it they found
already seated an elderly lady and a large, powerfully built
man, apparently Irish, respectably dressed, but with a lowering,
suspicious visage.Though one of the two gentlemen noticed this
peculiarity as he entered the carriage, he gave no thought to it,
but, going on with their conversation, he and his friend took their
seats, and in a few moments the train started.Scarcely was it out
of the station when the stranger changed his seat, placing himself
on the other side of the carriage, close to the window, and at the
same time, in a menacing way, incoherently muttering something to
himself.The other passengers looked at him, but felt no particular
alarm, and for a time he remained quietly in his seat.He then
suddenly sprang up, and, with a large clasp-knife in his hand,
rushed at one of the gentlemen, a Mr.Warland by name, and struck
him on the forehead, the knife sliding along the bone and inflicting
a frightful flesh wound.As he was in the act of repeating the blow,
Warland's companion thrust him back upon the seat.This seemed to
infuriate him, and starting to his feet he again tried to attack
the wounded man.It was a struggle for
life, in a narrow compartment feebly lighted, for it was late at
night, on a train running at full speed and with no stopping place
for eighty miles.The passenger who had not been hurt clutched the
maniac by the throat with one hand and grasped his knife with the
other, but only to feel the blade drawn through his fingers, cutting
them to the bone.The unfortunate elderly woman, the remaining
occupant of the compartment, after screaming violently in her
terror for a few moments, fainted away and fell upon the floor.The struggle nevertheless went on among the three men, until at
last, though blinded with blood and weak from its loss, the wounded
Mr.Warland got behind his assailant and threw him down, in which
position the two succeeded in holding him, he striking and stabbing
at both of them with his knife, shouting loudly all the time, and
desperately endeavoring to rise and throw them off.They finally,
however, got his knife away from him, and then kept him down until
the train at last drew up at Camdentown station.When the ticket
collector opened the compartment door at that place he found the
four passengers on the floor, the woman senseless and two of the
men holding the third, while the faces and clothing of all of them,
together with seats, floor, windows and sides of the carriage were
covered with blood or smeared with finger marks.The assailant in this case, as it subsequently appeared upon his
commitment for an assault, was a schoolmaster who had come over
from Ireland to a competitive examination.He was insane, of
course, but before the magistrate he made a statement which had in
it something quite touching; he said that he saw the two gentlemen
talking together, and, as he thought, making motions towards him;
he believed them to be thieves who intended to rob him, and so he
thought that he could not do better than defend himself, "if only
for his dear little ones at home."This took place before the Board of Trade circular was issued, but,
as if to give emphasis to it, a few days only after its issue, in
August, 1864, there was a not dissimilar occurrence in a third class
carriage between London and Peterborough.The running distance was
in this case eighty miles without a stop, and occupied generally an
hour and fifty minutes,--the rate being forty-three miles an hour.In the compartment in question were five passengers, one of whom,
a tall powerful fellow, was dressed like a sailor.The train was
hardly out of London when this man, after searching his pockets for
a moment, cried out that he had been robbed of his purse containing
£17, and began violently to shout and gesticulate.He then tried
to clamber through the window, getting his body and one leg out,
and when his fellow passengers, catching hold of his other leg,
succeeded in hauling him back, he turned savagely upon them and
a desperate struggle ensued.At last he was gotten down by main
force and bound to a seat.Meanwhile, notwithstanding the speed at
which they were running, the noise of the struggle was heard in
the adjoining compartments, and almost frantic efforts were made
to stop the train.Word was passed from carriage to carriage for a
short distance, but it proved impossible to communicate with the
guard, or to do anything but thoroughly alarm the passengers.These
merely knew that something was the matter,--what, they could only
imagine,--and so the run to Peterborough was completed amid shouts
of "stop the train," interspersed with frantic female shrieks.The
man was suffering from _delirium tremens_.About a year later, in December, 1865, a similar case occurred
which, however, had in it strong elements of the ludicrous.A
clergyman, laboring under great indignation and excitement, and
without the slightest sense of the ridiculous, recounted his
experience in a communication to the _Times_.He had found himself
alone in a compartment of an express train in which were also a
young lady and a man, both total strangers to him.Shortly after
the train started the man began to give unmistakable indications of
something wrong.He made no attempt at any violence on either of his
fellow passengers, but he was noisy, and presently he proceeded to
disrobe himself and otherwise to indulge in antics which were even
more indecent than they were extraordinary.The poor clergyman,--a
respected incumbent of the established church returning to the bosom
of his family,--was in a most distressing situation.At first he
attempted remonstrance.This, however, proved worse than unavailing,
and there was nothing for it but to have recourse to his umbrella,
behind the sheltering cover of which he protected the modesty of
the young lady, while over its edges he himself from time to time
effected observations through an apparently interminable journey of
forty and more miles.These and numerous other cases of fires, murders, assaults and
indecencies had occurred and filled the columns of the newspapers,
without producing the slightest effect on the managers of the
railway companies.No attention was paid by them to the Board of
Trade circulars.At last Parliament took the matter up and in 1868
an act was passed, making compulsory some "efficient means of
communication between the passenger and the servants of the company
in charge" of railroad trains.Yet when six years later in 1874 the
Shipton accident occurred, and was thought to be in some degree
attributable to the absence of the very means of communication
thus made compulsory, it appeared, as has been seen, that the
associated general managers did not yet consider any such means of
communication either required or likely to be useful.Meanwhile, as if in ironical comment on such measured utterances,
occurrences like the following, which took place as recently as the
early part of 1878, from time to time still meet the eye in the
columns of the English press:--

     "A burglar was being taken in a third-class carriage from
     London to Sheffield.When about twelve miles from Sheffield
     he asked that the windows might be opened.This was no sooner
     done than he took a dive out through the aperture.One of the
     warders succeeded in catching him by a foot, and for two miles
     he hung head downward suspended by one foot and making terrific
     struggles to free himself.In vain he wriggled, for although his
     captors were unable to catch the other foot, both held him as in
     a vise.But he wore spring-sided boots, and the one on which his
     fate seemingly depended came off.The burglar fell heavily on
     the foot-board of the carriage and rolled off on the railway.Three miles further on the train stopped, and the warders went
     back to the scene of the escape.Here they found him in the
     snow bleeding from a wound on the head.During the time he was
     struggling with the warders the warder who had one hand free and
     the passengers of the other compartments who were witnessing
     the scene from the windows of the train were indefatigable in
     their efforts to attract the attention of the guards by means of
     the communication cord, but with no result.For two miles the
     unfortunate man hung head downward, and for three miles further
     the train ran until it stopped at an ordinary resting place."A single further example will more than sufficiently illustrate
this instance of British railroad conservatism, and indicate the
tremendous nature of the pressure which has been required to even
partially force the American bell-cord into use in that country.One
day, in the latter part of 1876, a Mr.A. J. Ellis of Liverpool had
occasion to go to Chester.On his way there he had an experience
with a lunatic, which he subsequently recounted before a magistrate
as follows:--

     "On Friday last I took the 10.35 A.M., train from Lime Street in
     a third-class carriage, my destination being Chester.At Edge
     Hill Station the prisoner and another man, whom I afterward
     understood to be the prisoner's father, got into the same
     compartment, no one else being in the same compartment.The
     other person was much under the influence of drink when he
     entered, and was very noisy during the journey.The prisoner
     had the appearance of having been drinking, but was quiet.I
     sat with my back to the engine, on the getting-out side of the
     carriage; prisoner was sitting on the opposite side, with his
     right arm to the window, and the other person was sitting on
     the same side as prisoner, about the middle of the seat.I was
     engaged reading, and did not exchange words with the prisoner."After we had passed over Runcorn bridge and through the
     station, I perceived the prisoner make a start, and looking
     toward him saw a white-hafted knife in his hand, about five
     inches long, with the blade open.He held it in his right hand
     in a menacing manner.Drawing his left hand along the edge of
     the blade, he said, "This will have to go into some ----."At
     that moment he looked at me across the carriage; he was on his
     feet in an instant, and looking across to me, he said, "You
     ----, this will have to go into you," and made a bound toward
     me.The other jumped up and tried to prevent him.The prisoner
     threw him away; he made a plunge at my throat.I caught his
     wrist just as he advanced, and struggled with him, still holding
     fast to his wrist with both hands.We fell over and under one
     another two or three times, and eventually he overpowered me.I
     had fallen on my side on the seat, but still retained my hold
     upon his wrist.While lying in that position he held the knife
     down to within an inch of my throat.I called to the other man
     to hold the prisoner's hand back which contained the knife, and
     by that means he saved my life.I was growing powerless, and as
     the other man restrained the prisoner from using the knife, I
     jerked myself from his grasp, and knocked the knife out of the
     prisoner's hand with my left hand."The prisoner eluded the grip of his father, and falling on his
     knees began to seek for his knife.Failing to find the knife,
     he was instantly on his feet, and made a spring upon me.If I
     recollect aright, he threw his arms around my neck, and in this
     manner we struggled together up and down the carriage for some
     minutes, during which time he got my left thumb (with a glove on
     at the time) in his mouth, and bit it.Still retaining my thumb
     in his mouth, the other man struck him under the chin, when he
     released it, and fell on his knees seeking the knife, which
     he did not find.He was immediately on his feet, and again
     made a spring upon me.We had then a very long and desperate
     struggle, when he overpowered me and pinned me in a corner of
     the compartment.At last he got my right thumb into his mouth,
     holding my hand to steady it with both his hands while he bit
     it.With a great effort he then bit my thumb off, clean to the
     bone.I called to the other man to
     help me, but he seemed stupefied.He called two or three times
     to the prisoner, 'Leave the poor man alone.The poor man has
     done thee no harm.'Though sitting within nine inches of my
     knees he rendered me no help."When the prisoner bit my thumb off, he held it in his mouth; he
     pushed his head through the glass, spat the thumb into his hand
     and flung it out through the window.I then stood up and put my
     left hand in my pocket, took out my purse and cried out: 'If it
     is money you want take all I have.'He made a grab at the purse
     and flung it through the window, on the same side as the thumb
     was thrown out.From this act I inferred that I was struggling
     with a maniac.I retreated to the other end of the compartment,
     holding the other man between me and the prisoner, but he passed
     the other man by jumping over the seat and again got hold of me.Then he forced his head through the other window, breaking the
     glass, and, loosing me for a moment, with his fists smashed the
     remaining glass in the window.Addressing me he said: 'You ----,
     you will have to go over;' at the same time he flung both his
     arms around my waist.I put my leg behind his and threw him on
     his back.I called upon the other man to help me and he did so."We held him down for some time, but he overpowered us and flung
     us back some distance.He then laid hold of my travelling rug
     and threw it through the window.Laying his hand on the bottom
     of the window he cried out, 'Here goes,' and made a leap through
     the window.I and the other man instantly laid hold of his legs
     as he was falling over.I got my four fingers into his right
     shoe, and, his father assisting me, we held him through the
     window, hanging head downward for about half a mile.I then
     fainted, and as I was losing my hold on his heels I have some
     faint recollection that the prisoner's father lost his hold at
     the same time, and I can't say what happened afterward.As I was
     coming to myself the train was stopping, and I heard the other
     man say, 'Oh, my son, my son.'When the train stopped I walked
     from the carriage to the station, and Dr.Robinson, who was sent
     for, came in about an hour and amputated my thumb further back."While thus referring, however, to this instance of British railroad
conservatism, which with a stolid indifference seems to ignore
the teachings of every day life and to meet constantly recurring
experience with a calm defiance, it will not do for the American
railroad manager to pride himself too much on his own greater
ingenuity and more amenable disposition.The Angola disaster has
been referred to, as well as that at Shipton.If the absence of
the bell-cord had indeed any part in the fatality of the latter,
the presence in cars crowded with passengers of iron pots full of
living fire lent horrors before almost unheard of to the former.The methods of accomplishing needed results which are usual to any
people are never easily changed, whether in Europe or in America;
but certainly the disasters which have first and last ensued from
the failure to devise any safe means of heating passenger coaches
in this country are out of all proportion to those which can be
attributed in England to the absence of means of communication
between the passengers on trains and those in charge of them.There
is an American conservatism as well as an English; and when it comes
to a question of running risks it would be strange indeed if the
greater margin of security were found west of the Atlantic.The
security afforded by the bell-cord assuredly has not as yet in this
country off-set the danger incident to red-hot stoves.CHAPTER V.

TELESCOPING AND THE MILLER PLATFORM.The period of exemption from wholesale railroad slaughters referred
to in a previous chapter and which fortunately marked the early days
of the system, seems to have lasted some eleven years.The record of
great catastrophes opened on the Great Western railway of England,
and it opened also, curiously enough, upon the 24th of December, a
day which seems to have been peculiarly unfortunate in the annals
of that corporation, seeing that it was likewise the date of the
Shipton-on-Cherwell disaster.Upon that day, in 1841, a train, while
moving through a thick fog at a high rate of speed, came suddenly
in contact with a mass of earth that had slid down upon the track
from the <DW72> of the cutting.Instantly the whole rear of the train
was piled up on the top of the first carriage, which happened to
be crowded with passengers, eight of whom were killed on the spot
while seventeen others were more or less injured.The coroner's
jury returned a verdict of accidental death, and at the same time,
as if to give the corporation a forcible hint to look closer to the
condition of its roadway, a "deodand" of one hundred pounds was
levied on the locomotive and tender.This practice, by the way,
of levying a deodand in cases of railroad accidents resulting in
loss of life, affords a curious illustration of how seldom those
accidents must have occurred.The mere mention of it now as ever
having existed sounds almost as strange and unreal as would an
assertion that the corporations had in their earlier days been wont
to settle their differences by wager of battle.Like the wager of
battle, the deodand was a feature of the English common law derived
from the feudal period.It was nothing more nor less than a species
of fine, everything through the instrumentality of which accidental
death occurred being forfeited to the crown; or, in lieu of the
thing itself, its supposed money value as assessed by a coroner's
jury.[2] Accordingly, down to somewhere about the year 1847, when
the practice was finally abolished by act of Parliament, we find in
all cases of English railroad accidents resulting in death, mention
of the deodand assessed by coroner's juries on the locomotives.These appear to have been arbitrarily fixed, and graduated in amount
as the circumstances of the particular accident seemed to excite
in greater or less degree the sympathies or the indignation of the
jury.In November, 1838, for instance, a locomotive exploded on
the Manchester & Liverpool road, killing its engineer and fireman:
and for this escapade a deodand of twenty pounds was assessed upon
it by the coroner's jury; while upon another occasion, in 1839,
where the locomotive struck and killed a man and horse at a street
crossing, the deodand was fixed at no less a sum than fourteen
hundred pounds, the full value of the engine.Yet in this last
case there did not appear to be any circumstances rendering the
corporation liable in civil damages.The deodand seems to have been
looked upon as a species of rude penalty imposed on the use of
dangerous appliances,--a sharp reminder to the corporations to look
closely after their locomotives and employés.As, however, accidents
increased in frequency it became painfully apparent that "crowner's
'quest law" was not in any appreciable degree better calculated to
command the public respect in the days of Victoria than in those of
Elizabeth, and the ancient usage was accordingly at last abolished.Certainly the position of railroad corporations would now be even
more hazardous than it is, if, after every catastrophe resulting
in death, the coroner's jury of the vicinage enjoyed the power of
arbitrarily imposing on them such additional penalty not exceeding
the value of a locomotive, in addition to all other liabilities, as
might seem to it proper under the circumstances of the case.[2] "_Deodand._ By this is meant whatever personal chattel is
  the immediate occasion of the death of any reasonable creature:
  which is forfeited to the king, to be applied to pious uses, and
  distributed in alms by his high almoner; though formerly destined
  to a more superstitious purpose.* * * Wherever the thing is in
  motion, not only that part which immediately gives the wounds
  (as the wheel which runs over his body,) but all things which
  move with it and help to make the wound more dangerous, (as the
  cart and loading, which increase the pressure of the wheel) are
  forfeited."--_Blackstone, Book I, Chap.8, XVI._

Recurring, however, to the accident of December 24, 1861, the
numerous casualties in that case were due to the crushing of the
rolling stock which was not strong enough to resist the shock of
the sudden stop.Under these circumstances the light, short English
carriages rode over each other and were broken to pieces; under
similar circumstances the longer and heavier cars then in use in
America would have "telescoped;" that is, the platforms between the
cars would have been broken off and the forward end of each car
riding slightly up on its broken coupling would have shot in over
the floor of the car before it, sweeping away the studding and other
light wood-work and crushing stoves, seats and passengers into one
inextricable mass, until, if the momentum was sufficiently great,
the several vehicles in the train would be enclosed in each other
somewhat like the slides of a partially shut telescope.Crushing in other countries and telescoping in America were formerly
the greatest, if not the worst, dangers to which travel by rail
was liable.As respects crushing there is little to be said.It is
a mere question of proportions,--resisting strength opposed to
momentum.So long as trains go at great speed it is inevitable that
they will occasionally be brought to a dead-stand by running upon
unexpected obstacles.The simple wonder is that they do this so
infrequently.When, however, now and again, they are thus brought
to a dead-stand the safety of the passenger depends and can depend
on nothing but the strength of the car in which he is sitting as
measured by the force of the shock to which it is subjected.This
matter has already been referred to in connection with the Shipton
and Wollaston accidents,[3] the last of which was a significant
reminder to all railroad managers that no matter how strongly or
with how careful a regard to scientific principles cars may be
constructed, just so long as they are made by human hands it is easy
to load on weight sufficient, when combined with only a moderate
momentum, to crush them into splinters.Telescoping, however, was an incident of crushing, and a peculiarly
American incident, which is not without a certain historical
interest; for the particular feature in car construction which
led directly to it and all its attendant train of grisly horrors
furnishes a singular and instructive illustration of the gross
violations of mechanical principles into which practical, as opposed
to educated, mechanics are apt constantly to fall,--and in which,
when once they have fallen, they steadily persist.The original
idea of the railroad train was a succession of stage coaches chained
together and hauled by a locomotive.The famous pioneer train of
August 9, 1831, over the Mohawk Valley road was literally made up
in this way, the bodies of stage coaches having been placed on
trucks, which "were coupled together with chains or chain-links,
leaving from two to three feet slack, and when the locomotive
started it took up the slack by jerks, with sufficient force to jerk
the passengers, who sat on seats across the tops of the coaches,
out from under their hats, and in stopping they came together with
such force as to send them flying from their seats."On this trip,
it will be remembered, the train presently came to a stop, when
the passengers upon it, with true American adaptability, set their
wits at once to the work of devising some means of remedying the
unpleasant jerks.[4] "A plan was soon hit upon and put in execution.The three links in the couplings of the cars were stretched to their
utmost tension, a rail, from a fence in the neighborhood, was placed
between each pair of cars and made fast by means of the packing yarn
from the cylinders."Here was the incipient idea of couplers and
buffers improvised by practical men, and for a third of a century
it remained almost unimproved upon, except by the introduction
of a spring upon which coupler and buffer played.The only other
considerable change made in the earlier days of car construction
was by no means an improvement, inasmuch as it introduced the new
and wholly unnecessary danger of telescoping.[4] Railroads: their Origin and Problems, p.The original passenger cars, however frail and light they may have
been, were at least, when shackled together in a train, continuous
in their bearings on each other,--that is, their sills and floor
timbers were all on a level and in line, so that, if the cars were
suddenly pressed together, they met in such a way as to resist the
pressure to the extent of their resisting power, and the floor
of one did not quietly slide under or over that of another.The
bodies of these cars were about thirty-two inches from the rails.In raising the bodies
of the cars, however, the mechanics of those days encountered a
practical difficulty.The couplings of the cars built on the new
model were higher than those of the old.They at once met, and,
as they thought, no less ingeniously then successfully overcame
this difficulty, by placing the couplings and draw-heads of their
new cars below the line of the sills.This necessitated putting
the platform which sustained the coupling also beneath the sills,
and in doing that they disregarded, without the most remote
consciousness of the fact, a fundamental law of mechanics.With a
possible pressure, both sudden and heavy to be resisted, the line
of resistance was no longer the line of greatest strength.During
thirty years this stupid blunder remained uncorrected.It was as
if the builders during that period had from force of habit insisted
upon always using as supports pillars which were curved or bent
instead of upright.At the close of those thirty years also the
railroad mechanics had become so thoroughly educated into their
false methods that it took yet other years and a series of frightful
disasters, the significance of which they seemed utterly unable to
take in, before they could be induced to abandon those methods.The two great dangers of telescoping and oscillation were directly
due to this system of car construction and of train coupling,--and
telescoping and oscillation were probably the cause of one-half at
least of the loss of life and the injuries to persons incident to
the first thirty years of American railroad experience.The badly
built and loosely connected coaches of every train going at any
considerable rate of speed used then to swing and roll about and
hammer against each other after a fashion which made the infrequent
occurrence of serious disaster the only fair subject for surprise.In case of a sudden stoppage or partial derailment, the train
stopped or went on, not as a whole, but as a succession of parts,
while the low platforms and slack couplings fearfully increased
the danger;--for, if the train held together, the cars in stopping
were likely to break off the platforms, making of what remained of
them a sort of inclined plane over which the car-bodies rode into
each other at different levels; or, if the couplings, as was more
probable, held and the train did not part, the swaying and swinging
of the loosely connected cars was almost sure to throw them from
the track and break them in pieces.The invention through which
this difficulty was at last overcome, simple and obvious as it was,
is fairly entitled, so far as America at least is concerned, to be
classed among the four or five really noticeable advances which
have of late years been made in railroad appliances.It contributed
unmistakably and essentially to the safety of every traveller.Known
as the Miller platform and buffer, from the name of the inventor,
it was, like all good work of the sort, a simple and intelligent
recurrence to correct mechanical principles.Miller went to work to
construct cars in such a way as to cause them to come in contact
with each other in the line of their greatest resisting power, while
in coupling them together in trains he introduced both tension and
compression;--that is he, in plain language, brought the ends of
the heavy longitudinal floor timbers of the separate cars exactly
on a line and directly bearing on each other, and then forced them
against each other until the heavy spring buffers which played
on those floor timbers were compressed, when the couplers sprung
together and the train then stood practically one solid body from
end to end.It could no more swing or crush than a single car could
swing or crush.It then only remained to increase the weight and to
perfect the construction of the vehicles to insure all the safety in
this respect of which travel by rail admitted.Simple as these improvements were, and apparently obvious as the
mechanical principles on which they were based now seem, the
opposition for years offered to them by practical master-mechanics
and railroad men would have been ludicrous had it not been
exasperating.There was hardly a railroad in the country whose
officers did not insist that their method of construction was
exceptional, it was true, but far better than Miller's.It was
maintained that the slack couplings were necessary in order to
enable the locomotives to start the trains,--that a train made up
without the slack, on Miller's plan, could not be set in motion,
and that if it was set in motion it must twist apart at every sharp
curve etc.The ingenuity displayed in thus inventing theoretical
objections to the appliance far exceeded that required for inventing
it, and indeed no one who has not had official experience of it
can at all realize the objecting capacity of the typical practical
mechanic whose conceit as a rule is measured by his ignorance,
while his stupidity is unequalled save by his obstinacy.Even when
Miller's invention for one reason or another was not adopted, the
principles upon which that invention was founded,--the principles
of tension, cohesion and direct resistance,--at last forced their
way into general acceptance.The long-urged objection that the
thing was practically impossible was slowly abandoned in face of
the awkward but undeniable fact that it was done every day, and
many times a day.Consequently, as the result of much patient
arguing, duly emphasized by the regular recurrence of disaster,
it is not too much to assert that for weight, resisting power,
perfection of construction and equipment and the protection they
afford to travellers, the standard American passenger coach is now
far in advance of any other.As to comfort, convenience, taste
in ornamentation, etc., these are so much matters of habit and
education that it is unnecessary to discuss them.They do not affect
the question of safety.A very striking illustration of the vast increase of safety secured
through this improved car construction was furnished in an accident,
which happened in Massachusetts upon July 15, 1872.As an express
train on the Boston & Providence road was that day running to Boston
about noon and at a rate of speed of some forty miles an hour, it
came in contact with a horse and wagon at a grade crossing in the
town of Foxborough.The train was made up of thoroughly well-built
cars, equipped with both the Miller platform and the Westinghouse
train-brake.There was no time in which to check the speed, and it
thus became a simple question of strength of construction, to be
tested in an unavoidable collision.The engine struck the wagon, and
instantly destroyed it.The horse had already cleared the rails when
the wagon was struck, but, a portion of his harness getting caught
on the locomotive, he was thrown down and dragged a short distance
until his body came in contact with the platform of a station close
to the spot of collision.The body was then forced under the cars,
having been almost instantaneously rolled and pounded up into a
hard, unyielding mass.The results which ensued were certainly
very singular.Next to the locomotive was an ordinary baggage and
mail car, and it was under this car, and between its forward and
its hind truck, that the body of the horse was forced; coming then
directly in contact with the truck of the rear wheels, it tore it
from its fastenings and thus let the rear end of the car drop upon
the track.In falling, this end snapped the coupling by its weight,
and so disconnected the train, the locomotive going off towards
Boston dragging this single car, with one end of it bumping along
the track.Meanwhile the succeeding car of the train had swept over
the body of the horse and the disconnected truck, which were thus
brought in contact with its own wheels, which in their turn were
also torn off; and so great was the momentum that in this way all of
the four passenger cars which composed that part of the train were
successively driven clean off their rolling gear, and not only did
they then slide off the track, but they crossed a railroad siding
which happened to be at that point, went down an embankment three or
four feet in height, demolished a fence, passed into an adjoining
field, and then at last, after glancing from the stump of a large
oak-tree, they finally came to a stand-still some two hundred feet
from the point at which they had left the track.There was not in
this case even an approach to telescoping; on the contrary, each car
rested perfectly firmly in its place as regarded all the others, not
a person was injured, and when the wheel-less train at last became
stationary the astonished passengers got up and hurried through the
doors, the very glass in which as well as that in the windows was
unbroken.Here was an indisputable victory of skill and science over
accident, showing most vividly to what an infinitesimal extreme the
dangers incident to telescoping may be reduced.The vast progress in this direction made within twenty years can,
however, best perhaps be illustrated by the results of two accidents
almost precisely similar in character, which occurred, the one on
the Great Western railroad of Canada, in October, 1854, the other
on the Boston & Albany, in Massachusetts, in October, 1874.In the
first case a regular train made up of a locomotive and seven cars,
while approaching Detroit at a speed of some twenty miles an hour,
ran into a gravel train of fifteen cars which was backing towards
it at a speed of some ten miles an hour.The locomotive of the
passenger train was thrown completely off the track and down the
embankment, dragging after it a baggage car.At the head of the
passenger portion of the train were two second-class cars filled
with emigrants; both of these were telescoped and demolished,
and all their unfortunate occupants either killed or injured.The
front of the succeeding first-class car was then crushed in, and a
number of those in it were hurt.In all, no less than forty-seven
persons lost their lives, while sixty others were maimed or severely
bruised.So much for a collision in October, 1854.In October, 1874,
on the Boston & Albany road, the regular New York express train,
consisting of a locomotive and seven cars, while going during the
night at a speed of forty miles an hour, was suddenly, near the
Brimfield station, thrown by a misplaced switch into a siding upon
which a number of platform freight cars were standing.The train was
thoroughly equipped, having both Miller platform and Westinghouse
brake.The six seconds which intervened, in the darkness, between
notice of displacement and the collision did not enable the engineer
to check perceptibly the speed of his train, and when the blow came
it was a simple question of strength to resist.The shock must
have been tremendous, for the locomotive and tender were flung off
the track to the right and the baggage car to the left, the last
being thrown across the interval between the siding and the main
track and resting obliquely over the latter.The forward end of the
first passenger coach was thrown beyond the baggage car up over
the tender, and its rear end, as well as the forward end of the
succeeding coach, was injured.As in the Foxborough case, several
of the trucks were jerked out from under the cars to which they
belonged, but not a person on the train was more than slightly
bruised, the cars were not disconnected, nor was there even a
suggestion of telescoping.Going back once more to the early days, a third of a century
since, before yet the periodical recurrence of slaughter had
caused either train-brake or Miller platform to be imagined as
possibilities, before, indeed, there was yet any record of what
we would now consider a regular railroad field-day, with its long
train of accompanying horrors, including in the grisly array death
by crushing, scalding, drowning, burning, and impalement,--going
back to the year 1840, or thereabouts, we find that the railroad
companies experienced a notable illustration of the truth of the
ancient adage that it never rains but it pours; for it was then
that the long immunity was rudely broken in upon.After that time
disasters on the rail seemed to tread upon one another's heels
in quick and frightful succession.Within a few months of the
English catastrophe of December 24, 1841, there happened in France
one of the most famous and most horrible railroad slaughters
ever recorded.It took place on the 8th of May, 1842.It was the
birthday of the king, Louis Philippe, and, in accordance with the
usual practice, the occasion had been celebrated at Versailles by a
great display of the fountains.At half past five o'clock these had
stopped playing, and a general rush ensued for the trains then about
to leave for Paris.That which went by the road along the left bank
of the Seine was densely crowded, and so long that two locomotives
were required to draw it.As it was moving at a high rate of speed
between Bellevue and Meudon, the axle of the foremost of these
two locomotives broke, letting the body of the engine drop to the
ground.It instantly stopped, and the second locomotive was then
driven by its impetus on top of the first, crushing its engineer and
fireman, while the contents of both the fire-boxes were scattered
over the roadway and among the _débris_.Three carriages crowded
with passengers were then piled on top of this burning mass and
there crushed together into each other.The doors of these carriages
were locked, as was then and indeed is still the custom in Europe,
and it so chanced that they had all been newly painted.They blazed
up like pine kindlings.Some of the carriages were so shattered that
a portion of those in them were enabled to extricate themselves, but
the very much larger number were held fast; and of these such as
were not so fortunate as to be crushed to death in the first shock
perished hopelessly in the flames before the eyes of a throng of
lookers-on impotent to aid.Fifty-two or fifty-three persons were
supposed to have lost their lives in this disaster, and more than
forty others were injured; the exact number of the killed, however,
could never be ascertained, as the piling-up of the cars on top of
the two locomotives had made of the destroyed portion of the train
a veritable holocaust of the most hideous description.Not only did
whole families perish together,--in one case no less than eleven
members of the same family sharing a common fate,--but the remains
of such as were destroyed could neither be identified nor separated.In one case a female foot was alone recognizable, while in others
the bodies were calcined and and fused into an indistinguishable
mass.The Academy of Sciences appointed a committee to inquire
whether Admiral D'Urville, a distinguished French navigator, was
among the victims.His body was thought to be found, but it was so
terribly mutilated that it could be recognized only by a sculptor,
who chanced some time before to have taken a phrenological cast of
the skull.His wife and only son had perished with him.It is not easy now to conceive the excitement and dismay which this
catastrophe caused throughout France.The railroad was at once
associated in the minds of an excitable people with novel forms
of imminent death.France had at best been laggard enough in its
adoption of the new invention, and now it seemed for a time as if
the Versailles disaster was to operate as a barrier in the way of
all further railroad development.Persons availed themselves of the
steam roads already constructed as rarely as possible, and then in
fear and trembling, while steps were taken to substitute horse for
steam power on other roads then in process of construction.The disaster was, indeed, one well calculated to make a deep
impression on the popular mind, for it lacked almost no attribute of
the dramatic and terrible.There were circumstances connected with
it, too, which gave it a sort of moral significance,--contrasting
so suddenly the joyous return from the country _fête_ in the
pleasant afternoon of May, with what De Quincey has called the
vision of sudden death.It contained a whole homily on the familiar
text.As respects the number of those killed and injured, also,
the Versailles accident has not often been surpassed; perhaps
never in France.In this country it was surpassed on one occasion,
among others, under circumstances very similar to it.This was the
accident at Camphill station, about twelve miles from Philadelphia,
on July 17, 1856, which befell an excursion train carrying some
eleven hundred children, who had gone out on a Sunday-school picnic
in charge of their teachers and friends.The road had but a single track, and the
train, both long and heavy, had been delayed and was running behind
its schedule time.The conductor thought, however, that the next
station could yet be reached in time to meet and there pass a
regular train coming towards him.It may have been a miscalculation
of seconds, it may have been a difference of watches, or perhaps
the regular train was slightly before its time; but, however it
happened, as the excursion train, while running at speed, was
rounding a reverse curve, it came full upon the regular train, which
had just left the station.In those days, as compared with the
present, the cars were but egg-shells, and the shock was terrific.The locomotives struck each other, and, after rearing themselves
up for an instant, it is said, like living animals, fell to the
ground mere masses of rubbish.In any case the force of the shock
was sufficient to hurl both engines from the track and lay them side
by side at right angles to, and some distance from it.As only the
excursion train happened to be running at speed, it alone had all
the impetus necessary for telescoping; three of its cars accordingly
closed in upon each other, and the children in them were crushed;
as in the Versailles accident, two succeeding cars were driven upon
this mass, and then fire was set to the whole from the ruins of the
locomotives.It would be hard to imagine anything more thoroughly
heart-rending, for the holocaust was of little children on a party
of pleasure.Five cars in all were burned, and sixty-six persons
perished; the injured numbered more than a hundred.[5]

  [5] A collision very similar to that at Camphill occurred upon the
  Erie railway at a point about 20 miles west of Port Jervis on the
  afternoon of July 15, 1864.The train in this case consisted of
  eighteen cars, in which were some 850 Confederate soldiers on their
  way under guard to the prisoner's camp at Elmira.A coal train
  consisting of 50 loaded cars from the hanch took the main line at
  Lackawaxen.The telegraph operator there informed its conductor that
  the track was clear, and, while rounding a sharp reversed curve,
  the two trains came together, the one going at about twelve and the
  other at some twenty miles an hour.Some 60 of the soldiers, besides
  a number of train hands were killed on the spot, and 120 more were
  seriously injured, some of them fatally.This disaster occurred in the midst of some of the most important
  operations of the Rebellion and excited at the time hardly any
  notice.There was a suggestive military promptness in the subsequent
  proceedings."T. J. Ridgeway, Esq., Associate Judge of Pike County,
  was soon on the spot, and, after consultation with Mr.Riddle [the
  superintendent of the Erie road] and the officer in command of the
  men, a jury was impanneled and an inquest held; after which a large
  trench was dug by the soldiers and the railway employés, 76 feet
  long, 8 feet wide and 6 feet deep, in which the bodies were at once
  interred in boxes, hastily constructed--one being allotted to four
  rebels, and one to each Union soldier."There were sixteen of the
  latter killed.Of this disaster nothing could be said either in excuse or in
extenuation; it was not only one of the worst description, but
it was one of that description the occurrence of which is most
frequent.An excursion train, while running against time on a
single-track road, came in collision with a regular train.The
record is full of similar disasters, too numerous to admit of
specific reference.Primarily of course, the conductors of the
special trains are as a rule in fault in such cases.He certainly
was at Camphill, and felt himself to be so, for the next day he
committed suicide by swallowing arsenic.But in reality in these
and in all similar cases,--both those which have happened and those
hereafter surely destined to happen,--the full responsibility
does not rest upon the unfortunate or careless subordinate;--nor
should the weight of punishment be visited upon him.At this late day no board of directors, nor president,
nor superintendent has any right to operate a single track road
without the systematic use of the telegraph in connection with its
train movements.That the telegraph can be used to block, as it is
termed, double-track roads, by dividing them into sections upon no
one of which two trains can be running at the same time, is matter
of long and daily experience.There is nothing new or experimental
about it.It is a system which has been forced on the more crowded
lines of the world as an alternative to perennial killings.That
in the year 1879 excursion trains should rush along single-track
roads and hurl themselves against regular trains, just as was done
twenty-three years ago at Camphill, would be deemed incredible were
not exactly similar accidents still from time to time reported.Louis, for instance, on July 4, 1879.The
simple fact is that to now operate single-track roads without the
constant aid of the telegraph, as a means of blocking them for every
irregular train, indicates a degree of wanton carelessness, or an
excess of incompetence, for which adequate provision should be made
in the criminal law.Nothing but this appeal to the whipping-post,
as it were, seems to produce the needed mental activity; for it is
difficult to realize the stupid conservatism of ordinary men when
brought to the consideration of something to which they are not
accustomed.On this very point of controlling the train movement
of single-track roads by telegraph, for instance, within a very
recent period the superintendent of a leading Massachusetts road
gravely assured the railroad commissioners of that state, that he
considered it a most dangerous reliance which had occasioned many
disasters, and that he had no doubt it would be speedily abandoned
as a practice in favor of the old time-table and running-rules
system, from which no deviations would be allowed.This opinion
was expressed, also, after the Revere disaster of 1871, it might
have been supposed, had branded into the record of the state the
impossibility of safely running any crowded railroad in a reliance
upon the schedule.[6] Such men as this, however, are not accessible
to argument or the teachings of experience, and the gentle stimulant
of a criminal prosecution seems to be the only thing left.TELEGRAPHIC COLLISIONS.And yet, even with the wires in active use, collisions will
occasionally take place.They have sometimes, indeed, even been
caused by the telegraph, so that railroad officials at two adjacent
stations on the same road, having launched trains at each other
beyond recall, have busied themselves while waiting for tidings of
the inevitable collision in summoning medical assistance for those
sure soon to be injured.In such cases, however, the mishap can
almost invariably be traced to some defect in the system under which
the telegraph is used;--such as a neglect to exact return messages
to insure accuracy, or the delegating to inexperienced subordinates
the work which can be properly performed only by a principal.This
was singularly illustrated in a terrible collision which took place
at Thorpe, between Norwich and Great Yarmouth, on the Great Eastern
Railway in England, on the 10th of September, 1874.The line had
in this place but a single track, and the mail train to Norwich,
under the rule, had to wait at a station called Brundell until the
arrival there of the evening express from Yarmouth, or until it
received permission by the telegraph to proceed.On the evening of
the disaster the express train was somewhat behind its time, and
the inspector wrote a dispatch directing the mail to come forward
without waiting for it.This dispatch he left in the telegraph
office unsigned, while he went to attend to other matters.Just then
the express train came along, and he at once allowed it to proceed.Hardly was it under way when the unsigned dispatch occurred to him,
and the unfortunate man dashed to the telegraph office only to learn
that the operator had forwarded it.Under the rules of the company
no return message was required.A second dispatch was instantly sent
to Brundell to stop the mail; the reply came back that the mail was
gone.The two trains were of very equal weight, the one consisting of
fourteen and the other of thirteen carriages.They were both drawn
by powerful locomotives, the drivers of which had reason for putting
on an increased speed, believing, as each had cause to believe, that
the other was waiting for him.The night was intensely dark and
it was raining heavily, so that, even if the brakes were applied,
the wheels would slide along the slippery track.Under these
circumstances the two trains rushed upon each other around a slight
curve which sufficed to conceal their head-lights.The combined
momentum must have amounted to little less than sixty miles an
hour, and the shock was heard through all the neighboring village.The smoke-stack of the locomotive drawing the mail train was swept
away as the other locomotive seemed to rush on top of it, while
the carriages of both trains followed until a mound of locomotives
and shattered cars was formed which the descending torrents alone
hindered from becoming a funeral pyre.So sudden was the collision
that the driver of one of the engines did not apparently have an
opportunity to shut off the steam, and his locomotive, though forced
from the track and disabled, yet remained some time in operation in
the midst of the wreck.In both trains, very fortunately, there were
a number of empty cars between the locomotives and the carriages in
which the passengers were seated, and they were utterly demolished;
but for this fortunate circumstance the Thorpe collision might well
have proved the most disastrous of all railroad accidents.As it
was, the men on both the locomotives were instantly killed, together
with seventeen passengers, and four other passengers subsequently
died of their injuries; making a total of twenty-five deaths,
besides fifty cases of injury.It would be difficult to conceive of a more violent collision
than that which has just been described; and yet, as curiously
illustrating the rapidity with which the force of the most severe
shock is expended, it is said that two gentlemen in the last
carriage of one of the trains, finding it at a sudden standstill
close to the place to which they were going, supposed it had stopped
for some unimportant cause and concluded to take advantage of a
happy chance which left them almost at the doors of their homes.They accordingly got out and hurried away in the rain, learning
only the next morning of the catastrophe in which they had been
unconscious participants.The collision at Thorpe occurred in September, 1874.Seven months
later, on the 4th of April, 1875, there was an accident similar
to it in almost every respect, except fatality, on the Burlington
& Missouri road in Iowa.In this case the operator at Tyrone had
telegraphic orders to hold the east-bound passenger express at that
point to meet the west-bound passenger express.This order he failed
to deliver, and the train accordingly at once went on to the usual
passing place at the next station.It was midnight and intensely
dark, with a heavy mist in the air which at times thickened to rain.Both of the trains approaching each other were made up in the way
usual with through night trains on the great western lines, and
consisted of locomotives, baggage and smoking cars, behind which
were the ordinary passenger cars of the company followed by several
heavy Pullman sleeping coaches.Those in charge of the east-bound
train, knowing that it was behind time, were running it rapidly,
so as to delay as little as possible the west-bound train, which,
having received the order to pass at Tyrone was itself being run at
speed.Both trains were thus moving at some thirty-five miles an
hour, when suddenly in rounding a sharp curve they came upon each
other.Indeed so close were they that the west-bound engineer had no
time in which to reverse, but, jumping straight from the gangway,
he afterwards declared that the locomotives came together before he
reached the ground.The engineer of the east-bound train succeeded
both in reversing his locomotive and in applying his airbrake, but
after reversal the throttle flew open.The trains came together,
therefore, as at Thorpe, with their momentum practically unchecked,
and with such force that the locomotives were completely demolished,
the boilers of the two, though on the same line of rails, actually,
in some way, passing each other.The baggage-cars were also
destroyed, and the smoking cars immediately behind them were more
or less damaged, but the remaining coaches of each train stood
upon the tracks so wholly uninjured that four hours later, other
locomotives having been procured but the track being still blocked,
the passengers were transferred from one set of cars to the other,
and in them were carried to their destinations.So admirably did
Miller's construction serve its purpose in this case, that, while
the superintendent of the road, who happened to be in the rear
sleeping car of one of the trains, merely reported that he "felt the
shock quite sensibly," passengers in the rear coaches of the other
train hardly felt it at all.At Tyrone the wrecks of the trains caught fire from the stoves
thrown out of the baggage cars and from the embers from the
fire-boxes of the locomotives, but the flames were speedily
extinguished.Of the train hands three were killed and two injured,
but no passenger was more than shaken or slightly bruised.This
was solely due to strength of car construction.Heavy as the shock
was,--so heavy that in the similar case at Thorpe the carriages were
crushed like nut-shells under it,--the resisting power was equal to
it.The failure of appliances at one point in the operation of the
road was made good by their perfection at another.Similar in some of its more dramatic features to the Versailles
accident, though originating from a wholly different cause, was the
Abergele disaster, which at the time occupied the attention of the
British public to the exclusion of everything else.It occurred
in 1868, and to the "Irish mail," perhaps the most famous train
which is run in England, if, indeed, not in the world.Leaving
London shortly after 7 A.M., the Irish mail was then timed to make
the distance to Chester, 166 miles, in four hours and eighteen
minutes, or at the rate of 40 miles an hour.For the next 85 miles,
completing the run to Holyhead, the speed was somewhat increased,
two hours and five minutes only being allowed for it.Abergele is a
point on the sea-coast of Wales, nearly midway between Chester and
Holyhead.On the day of the accident, August 20, 1868, the Irish
mail left Chester as usual.It was made up of thirteen carriages
in all, which were occupied, as the carriages of that train usually
were, by a large number of persons whose names at least were widely
known.Among these, on this particular occasion, was the Duchess of
Abercorn, wife of the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, with five
children.Under the running arrangements of the London & North
Western road a freight, or as it is there called a goods train, left
Chester half an hour before the mail, and was placed upon the siding
at Llanddulas, a station about a mile and a half beyond Abergele,
to allow the mail to pass.From Abergele to Llanddulas the track
ascended by a gradient of some sixty feet to the mile.On the day of
the accident it chanced that certain wagons between the engine and
the rear end of the goods train had to be taken out to be left at
Llanddulas, and in doing this it became necessary to separate the
train and to leave five or six of the last wagons in it standing on
the tracks of the main line, while those which were to be left were
backed onto a siding.The employé, whose duty it was, neglected to
set the brakes on the wagons thus left standing, and consequently
when the engine and the rest of the train returned for them, the
moment they were touched and before a coupling could be effected,
the jar set them in motion down the incline towards Abergele.They
started so slowly that a brakeman of the train ran after them,
fully expecting to catch and stop them, but as they went down the
grade they soon outstripped him and it became clear that there was
nothing to check them until they should meet the Irish mail, then
almost due.It also chanced that the cars thus set in motion were
oil cars.The track of the North Western road between Abergele and Llanddulas
runs along the sides of the picturesque Welsh hills, which rise
up to the south, while to the north there stretches out a wide
expanse of sea.The mail train was skirting the hills and laboring
up the grade at a speed of thirty miles an hour, when its engineer
suddenly became aware of the loose wagons coming down upon it around
the curve, and then but a few yards off.Seeing that they were oil
cars he almost instinctively sprang from his locomotive, and was
thrown down by the impetus and rolled to the side of the road-bed.Picking himself up, bruised but not seriously hurt, he saw that
the collision had already taken place, that the tender had ridden
directly over the engine, that the colliding cars were demolished,
and that the foremost carriages of the train were already on fire.Running quickly to the rear of the train he succeeded in uncoupling
six carriages and a van, which were drawn away from the rest, before
the flames extended to them, by an engine which most fortunately was
following the train.All the other carriages were utterly destroyed,
and every person in them perished.The Abergele was probably the solitary instance of a railroad
accident in which but a single survivor sustained any injury.The collision was
not a particularly severe one, and the engineer of the mail train
especially stated that at the moment it occurred the loose cars were
still moving so slowly that he would not have sprung from his engine
had he not seen that they were loaded with oil.The very instant
the collision took place, however, the fluid seemed to ignite and
to flash along the train like lightning, so that it was impossible
to approach a carriage when once it caught fire.The fact was that
the oil in vast quantities was spilled upon the track and ignited by
the fire of the locomotive, and then the impetus of the mail train
forced all of its leading carriages into the dense mass of smoke and
flame.All those who were present concurred in positively stating
that not a cry, nor a moan, nor a sound of any description was heard
from the burning carriages, nor did any one in them apparently make
an effort to escape.The most graphic description of this extraordinary and terrible
catastrophe was that given by the Marquis of Hamilton, the eldest
son of the Duke of Abercorn whose wife and family, fortunately
for themselves, occupied one of those rear carriages which were
unshackled and saved.In this account the Marquis of Hamilton
said:--"We were startled by a collision and a shock which, though
not very severe, were sufficient to throw every one against his
opposite neighbor.I immediately jumped out of the carriage,
when a fearful sight met my view.Already the whole of the three
passengers' carriages in front of ours, the vans, and the engine
were enveloped in dense sheets of flame and smoke, rising fully
twenty feet high, and spreading out in every direction.No words can convey the instantaneous nature
of the explosion and conflagration.I had actually got out almost
before the shock of the collision was over, and this was the
spectacle which already presented itself.Not a sound, not a scream,
not a struggle to escape, not a movement of any sort was apparent
in the doomed carriages.It was as though an electric flash had
at once paralyzed and stricken every one of their occupants.So
complete was the absence of any presence of living or struggling
life in them that as soon as the passengers from the other parts
of the train were in some degree recovered from their first shock
and consternation, it was imagined that the burning carriages were
destitute of passengers; a hope soon changed into feelings of horror
when their contents of charred and mutilated remains were discovered
an hour afterward.From the extent, however, of the flames, the
suddenness of the conflagration, and the absence of any power to
extricate themselves, no human aid would have been of any assistance
to the sufferers, who, in all probability, were instantaneously
suffocated by the black and fetid smoke peculiar to paraffine, which
rose in volumes around the spreading flames."Though the collision took place before one o'clock, in spite
of the efforts of a large gang of men who were kept throwing
water on the tracks, the perfect sea of flame which covered the
line for a distance of some forty or fifty yards could not be
extinguished until nearly eight o'clock in the evening; for the
petroleum had flowed down into the ballasting of the road, and the
rails themselves were red-hot.It was therefore small occasion
for surprise that, when the fire was at last gotten under, the
remains of those who lost their lives were in some cases wholly
undistinguishable, and in others almost so.Among the thirty-three
victims of the disaster the body of no single one retained any
traces of individuality; the faces of all were wholly destroyed,
and in no case were there found feet, or legs, or anything at all
approaching to a perfect head.Ten corpses were finally identified
as those of males, and thirteen as those of females, while the sex
of ten others could not be determined.The body of one passenger,
Lord Farnham, was identified by the crest on his watch; and, indeed,
no better evidence of the wealth and social position of the victims
of this accident could have been asked for than the collection of
articles found on its site.It included diamonds of great size
and singular brilliancy; rubies, opals, emeralds, gold tops of
smelling-bottles, twenty-four watches, of which but two or three
were not gold, chains, clasps of bags, and very many bundles of
keys.Of these the diamonds alone had successfully resisted the
intense heat of the flame; the settings were nearly all destroyed.Of the causes of this accident little need or can be said.No human
appliances, no more ingenious brakes or increased strength of
construction, could have averted it or warded off its consequences
once it was inevitable.It was occasioned primarily by two things,
the most dangerous and the most difficult to reach of all the
many sources of danger against which those managing railroads
have unsleepingly to contend:--a somewhat defective discipline,
aggravated by a little not unnatural carelessness.The rule of
the company was specific that all the wagons of every goods train
should be out of the way and the track clear at least ten minutes
before a passenger train was due; but in this case shunting was
going actively on when the Irish-mail was within a mile and a half.A careless brakeman then forgot for once that he was leaving his
wagons close to the head of an incline; a blow in coupling, a little
heavier perhaps than usual, sufficed to set them in motion; and they
happened to be loaded with oil.A catastrophe strikingly similar to that at Abergele befell an
express train on the Hudson River railroad, upon the night of the
6th of February, 1871.The weather for a number of days preceding
the accident had been unusually cold, and it is to the suffering
of employés incident to exposure, and the consequent neglect of
precautions on their part, that accidents are peculiarly due.On
this night a freight train was going south, all those in charge of
which were sheltering themselves during a steady run in the caboose
car at its rear end.Suddenly, when near a bridge over Wappinger's
Creek, not far from New Hamburg, they discovered that a car in the
centre of the train was off the track.The train was finally stopped
on the bridge, but in stopping it other cars were also derailed,
and one of these, bearing on it two large oil tanks, finally rested
obliquely across the bridge with one end projecting over the up
track.Hardly had the disabled train been brought to a stand-still,
when, before signal lanterns could in the confusion incident to the
disaster be sent out, the Pacific express from New York, which was
a little behind its time, came rapidly along.As it approached the
bridge, its engineer saw a red lantern swung, and instantly gave the
signal to apply the brakes.It was too late to avoid the collision;
but what ensued had in it, so far as the engineer was concerned,
an element of the heroic, which his companion, the fireman of the
engine, afterwards described on the witness stand with a directness
and simplicity of language which exceeded all art.The engineer's
name was Simmons, and he was familiarly known among his companions
as "Doc."His fireman, Nicholas Tallon, also saw the red light swung
on the bridge, and called out to him that the draw was open.In
reply Simmons told him to spring the patent brake, which he did,
and by this time they were alongside of the locomotive of the
disabled train and running with a somewhat slackened speed.Tallon
had now got out upon the step of the locomotive, preparatory to
springing off, and turning asked his companion if he also proposed
to do the same:--"'Doc' looked around at me but made no reply, and
then looked ahead again, watching his business; then I jumped and
rolled down on the ice in the creek; the next I knew I heard the
crash and saw the fire and smoke."The next seen of "Doc" Simmons,
he was dragged up days afterwards from under his locomotive at the
bottom of the river.He went out
of the world and of the sight of men with his hand on the lever,
making no reply to the suggestion that he should leave his post, but
"looking ahead and watching his business."Dante himself could not have imagined a greater complication of
horrors than then ensued: liquid fire and solid frost combined to
make the work of destruction perfect.The shock of the collision
broke in pieces the oil car, igniting its contents and flinging them
about in every direction.In an instant bridge, river, locomotive,
cars, and the glittering surface of the ice were wrapped in a sheet
of flame.At the same time the strain proved too severe for the
trestlework, which gave way, precipitating the locomotive, tender,
baggage cars, and one passenger car onto the ice, through which they
instantly crushed and sank deep out of sight beneath the water.Of the remaining seven cars of the passenger train, two, besides
several of the freight train, were destroyed by fire, and shortly,
as the supports of the remaining portions of the bridge burned away,
the superstructure fell on the half-submerged cars in the water and
buried them from view.Twenty-one persons lost their lives in this disaster, and a large
number of others were injured; but the loss of life, it will be
noticed, was only two-thirds of that at Abergele.The New Hamburg
catastrophe also differed from that at Abergele in that, under
its particular circumstances, it was far more preventable, and,
indeed, with the appliances since brought into use it would surely
be avoided.The modern train-brake had, however, not then been
perfected, so that even the hundred rods at which the signal was
seen did not afford a sufficient space in which to stop the train.DRAW-BRIDGE DISASTERS.It is difficult to see how on double track roads, where the
occurrence of an accident on one line of tracks is always liable to
instantly "foul" the other line, it is possible to guard against
contingencies like that which occurred at New Hamburg.At the time,
as is usual in such cases, the public indignation expended itself
in vague denunciation of the Hudson River Railroad Company, because
the disaster happened to take place upon a bridge in which there was
a draw to permit the passage of vessels.There seemed to be a vague
but very general impression that draw-bridges were dangerous things,
and, because other accidents due to different causes had happened
upon them, that the occurrence of this accident, from whatever
cause, was in itself sufficient evidence of gross carelessness.The
fact was that not even the clumsy Connecticut rule, which compels
the stopping of all trains before entering on any draw-bridge,
would have sufficed to avert the New Hamburg disaster, for the
river was then frozen and the draw was not in use, so that for the
time being the bridge was an ordinary bridge; and not even in the
frenzy of crude suggestions which invariably succeeds each new
accident was any one ever found ignorant enough to suggest the
stopping of all trains before entering upon every bridge, which, as
railroads generally follow water-courses, would not infrequently
necessitate an average of one stop to every thousand feet or so.Only incidentally did the bridge at New Hamburg have anything to
do with the disaster there, the essence of which lay in the sudden
derailment of an oil car immediately in front of a passenger train
running in the opposite direction and on the other track.Of course,
if the derailment had occurred long enough before the passenger
train came up to allow the proper signals to be given, and this
precaution had been neglected, then the disaster would have been
due, not to the original cause, but to the defective discipline
of the employés.Such does not appear to have been the case at
New Hamburg, nor was that disaster by any means the first due to
derailment and the throwing of cars from one track in front of a
train passing upon the other;--nor will it be the last.Indeed, an
accident hardly less destructive, arising from that very cause, had
occurred only eight months previous in England, and resulted in
eighteen deaths and more than fifty cases of injury.A goods train made up of a locomotive and twenty-nine wagons was
running at a speed of some twenty miles an hour on the Great
Northern road, between Newark and Claypole, about one hundred miles
from London, when the forward axle under one of the wagons broke.As
a result of the derailment which ensued the train became divided,
and presently the disabled car was driven by the pressure behind it
out of its course and over the interval, so that it finally rested
partly across the other track.At just this moment an excursion
train from London, made up of twenty-three carriages and containing
some three hundred and forty passengers, came along at a speed of
about thirty-five miles an hour.It was quite dark, and the engineer
of the freight train waved his arm as a signal of danger; one of
the guards, also, showed a red light with his hand lantern, but his
action either was not seen or was misunderstood, for without any
reduction of speed being made the engine of the excursion train
plunged headlong into the disabled goods wagon.The collision was
so violent as to turn the engine aside off the track and cause it
to strike the stone pier of a bridge near by, by which it was flung
completely around and then driven up the <DW72> of the cutting, where
it toppled over like a rearing horse and fell back into the roadway.The tender likewise was overturned; but not so the carriages.They
rushed along holding to the track, and the side of each as it passed
was ripped and torn by the projecting end of the goods wagon.Of the twenty-three carriages and vans in the train scarcely one
escaped damage, while the more forward ones were in several cases
lifted one on top of the other or forced partly up the <DW72> of
the cutting, whence they fell back again, crushing the passengers
beneath them.This accident occurred on the 21st of June, 1870; it was very
thoroughly investigated by Captain Tyler on behalf of the Board of
Trade, with the apparent conclusion that it was one which could
hardly have been guarded against.The freight cars, the broken
axle of which occasioned the disaster, did not belong to the Great
Northern company, and the wheels of the train had been properly
examined by viewing and tapping at the several stopping-places; the
flaw which led to the fracture was, however, of such a nature that
it could have been detected only by the removal of the wheel.It did
not appear that the employés of the company had been guilty of any
negligence; and it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that the
accident was due to one of those defects to which the results of
even the most perfect human workmanship must ever remain liable, and
this had revealed itself under exactly those conditions which must
involve the most disastrous consequences.The English accident did, however, establish one thing, if nothing
else; it showed the immeasurable superiority of the system of
investigation pursued in the case of railroad accidents in England
over that pursued in this country.There a trained expert after
the occurrence of each disaster visits the spot and sifts the
affair to the very bottom, locating responsibility and pointing out
distinctly the measures necessary to guard against its repetition.Here the case ordinarily goes to a coroner's jury, the findings of
which as a rule admirably sustain the ancient reputation of that
august tribunal.It is absolutely sad to follow the course of these
investigations, they are conducted with such an entire disregard of
method and lead to such inadequate conclusions.Indeed, how could it
be otherwise?--The same man never investigates two accidents, and,
for the one investigation he does make, he is competent only in his
own esteem.Take the New Hamburgh accident as an example.Rarely has any
catastrophe merited a more careful investigation, and few
indeed have ever called forth more ill-considered criticism or
crude suggestions.Almost nothing of interest respecting it was
elicited at the inquest, and now no reliable criticism can be
ventured upon it.The question of responsibility in that case,
and of prevention thereafter, involved careful inquiry into at
least four subjects:--First, the ownership and condition of the
freight car, the fractured axle of which occasioned the disaster,
together with the precautions taken by the company, usually and in
this particular case, to test the wheels of freight cars moving
over its road, especially during times of severe cold.--Second,
the conduct of those in charge of the freight train immediately
preceding and at the time of the accident; was the fracture of the
axle at once noticed and were measures taken to stop the train, or
was the derailment aggravated by neglect into the form it finally
took?--Third, was there any neglect in signaling the accident on
the part of those in charge of the disabled train, and how much
time elapsed between the accident and the collision?--Fourth, what,
if any, improved appliances would have enabled those in charge
of either train to have averted the accident?--and what, if any,
defects either in the rules or the equipment in use were revealed?No satisfactory conclusion can now be arrived at upon any of these
points, though the probabilities are that with the appliances since
introduced the train might have been stopped in time.In this case,
as in that at Claybridge, the coroner's jury returned a verdict
exonerating every one concerned from responsibility, and very
possibly they were justified in so doing; though it is extremely
questionable whether Captain Tyler would have arrived at a similar
conclusion.There is a strong probability that the investigation
went off, so to speak, on a wholly false issue,--turned on the
draw-bridge frenzy instead of upon the question of care.So far
as the verdict declared that the disaster was due to a collision
between a passenger train and a derailed oil car, and not to the
existence of a draw in the bridge on which it happened to occur, it
was, indeed, entitled to respect, and yet it was on this very point
that it excited the most criticism.Loud commendation was heard
through the press of the Connecticut law, which had been in force
for twenty years, and, indeed, still is in force there, under which
all trains are compelled to come to a full stop before entering
on any bridge which has a draw in it,--a law which may best be
described as a useless nuisance.Yet the grand jury of the Court of
Oyer and Terminer of New York city even went so far as to recommend,
in a report made by it on the 23d of February, 1871,--sixteen days
after the accident,--the passage by the legislature then in session
at Albany of a similar legal absurdity.Fortunately better counsels
prevailed, and, as the public recovered its equilibrium, the matter
was allowed to drop.The Connecticut law in question, however, originated in an accident
which at the time had startled and shocked the community as much
even as that at Versailles did before or that at Abergele has since
done.It occurred to an express train on the New York & New Haven
road at Norwalk, in Connecticut, on the 6th of May, 1853.CHAPTER X.

THE NORWALK ACCIDENT.The railroad at Norwalk crosses a small inlet of Long Island Sound
by means of a draw-bridge, which is approached from the direction
of New York around a sharp curve.A ball at the mast-head was in
1853 the signal that the draw was open and the bridge closed to
the passage of trains.The express passenger train for Boston,
consisting of a locomotive and two baggage and five passenger cars,
containing about one hundred and fifty persons, left New York as
usual at eight o'clock that morning.The locomotive was not in
charge of its usual engine-driver but of a substitute named Tucker;
a man who some seven years before had been injured in a previous
collision on the same road, for which he did not appear to have
been in any way responsible, but who had then given up his position
and gone to California, whence he had recently returned and was now
again an applicant for an engineer's situation.This was his third
trip over the road, as substitute.In approaching the bridge at
Norwalk he apparently wholly neglected to look for the draw-signal.He was running his train at about the usual rate of speed, and
first became aware that the draw was open when within four hundred
feet of it and after it had become wholly impossible to stop the
train in time.He immediately whistled for brakes and reversed his
engine, and then, without setting the brake on his tender, both he
and the fireman sprang off and escaped with trifling injuries.The
train at this time did not appear to be moving at a speed of over
fifteen miles an hour.The draw was sixty feet in width; the water
in the then state of the tide was about twelve feet deep, and the
same distance below the level of the bridge.Although the speed
of the train had been materially reduced, yet when it came to the
opening it was still moving with sufficient impetus to send its
locomotive clean across the sixty foot interval and to cause it to
strike the opposite abutment about eight feet below the track; it
then fell heavily to the bottom.The tender lodged on top of the
locomotive, bottom up and resting against the pier, while on top
of this again was the first baggage car.The second baggage car,
which contained also a compartment for smokers, followed, but in
falling was canted over to the north side of the draw in such a way
as not to be wholly submerged, so that most of those in it were
saved.The first passenger car next plunged into the opening; its
forward end crushed in, as it fell against the baggage car in front
of it, while its rear end dropped into the deep water below; and
on top of it came the second passenger car, burying the passengers
in the first beneath the _débris_, and itself partially submerged.The succeeding or third passenger car, instead of following the
others, broke in two in the middle, the forward part hanging down
over the edge of the draw, while the rear of it rested on the track
and stayed the course of the remainder of the train.Including those
in the smoking compartment more than a hundred persons were plunged
into the channel, of whom forty-six lost their lives, while some
thirty others were more or less severely injured.The killed were
mainly among the passengers in the first car; for, in falling, the
roof of the second car was split open, and it finally rested in such
a position that, as no succeeding car came on top of it, many of
those in it were enabled to extricate themselves; indeed, more than
one of the passengers in falling were absolutely thrown through the
aperture in the roof, and, without any volition on their part, were
saved with unmoistened garments.Shocking as this catastrophe was, it was eclipsed in horror by
another exactly similar in character, though from the peculiar
circumstances of the case it excited far less public notice, which
occurred eleven years later on the Grand Trunk railway of Canada.In this case a large party of emigrants, over 500 in number and
chiefly Poles, Germans and Norwegians of the better class, had
landed at Quebec and were being forwarded on a special train to
their destination in the West.With their baggage they filled
thirteen cars.The Grand Trunk on the way to Montreal crosses the
Richelieu river at Beloeil by an iron bridge, in the westernmost
span of which was a draw over the canal, some 45 feet below it.Both
by law and under the running rules of the road all trains were to
come to a dead stand on approaching the bridge, and to proceed only
when the safety signal was clearly discerned.This rule, however,
as it appeared at the subsequent inquest, had been systematically
disobeyed, it having been considered sufficient if the train was
"slowed down."In the present case, however--the night of June 29,
1864,--though the danger signal was displayed and in full sight
for a distance of 1,600 feet, the engine-driver, unfamiliar with
the road and its signals, failed to see it, and, without slowing
his train even, ran directly onto the bridge.He became aware of
the danger when too late to stop.The draw was open to permit the
passage of a steamer with six barges in tow, one of which was
directly under the opening.The whole train went through the draw,
sinking the barge and piling itself up in the water on top of it.The three last cars, falling on the accumulated wreck, toppled over
upon the west embankment and were thus less injured than the others.The details of the accident were singularly distressing."As soon
as possible a strong cable was attached to the upper part of the
piling, and by this means two cars, the last of the ill-fated train,
were dragged onto the wharf under the bridge.A shapeless blue mass of hands and heads and feet
protruded among the splinters and frame-work, and gradually resolved
itself into a closely-packed mass of human beings, all ragged and
bloody and dinted from crown to foot with blue bruises and weals
and cuts inflicted by the ponderous iron work, the splinters and
the enormous weight of the train.* * * A great many of the dead
had evidently been asleep; the majority of them had taken off their
boots and coats in the endeavor to make themselves as comfortable
as possible.They lay heaped upon one another like sacks, dressed
in the traditional blue clothing of the German people.* * * A
child was got at and removed nine hours after the accident, being
uninjured in its dead mother's arms."The accident happened at 2 A.M., and before sundown of the next day
86 bodies had been taken out of the canal; others were subsequently
recovered, and yet more died from their hurts.It was altogether a disaster of the most
appalling description, in extenuation of which nothing was to
be said.It befell, however, a body of comparatively friendless
emigrants, and excited not a tithe of the painful interest which yet
attaches to the similar accident to the Boston express at Norwalk.These terrible disasters were both due, not alone to the
carelessness of the two engine-drivers, but to the use of a crude
and inadequate system of signals.It so happened, however, that
the legislature of Connecticut was unfortunately in session at the
time of the Norwalk disaster, and consequently the public panic
and indignation took shape in a law compelling every train on
the railroads of that state to come to a dead stand-still before
entering upon any bridge in which there was a draw.This law is
still in force, and from time to time, as after the New Hamburg
catastrophe, an unreasoning clamor is raised for it in other
states.In point of fact it imposes a most absurd, unnecessary and
annoying delay on travel, and rests upon the Connecticut statute
book a curious illustration of what usually happens when legislators
undertake to incorporate running railroad regulations into the
statutes-at-large.It is of a par with another law, which has for
more than twenty-five years been in force in Connecticut's sister
state of Massachusetts, compelling in all cases where the tracks of
different companies cross each other at a level the trains of each
company to stop before reaching the crossing, and then to pass over
it slowly.The danger of collision at crossings is undoubtedly much
greater than that of going through open draws.Precautions against
danger in each case are unquestionably proper and they cannot be
too perfect, but to have recourse to stopping either in the one
case or the other simply reveals an utter ignorance of the great
advance which has been made in railroad signals and the science of
interlocking.In both these cases it is, indeed, entitled to just
about the same degree of respect as would be a proposal to recur to
pioneer engines as a means of preventing accidents to night trains.The machinery by means of which both draws and grade crossings
can be protected, will be referred to in another connection,[7]
meanwhile it is a curious fact that neither at grade crossings
nor at draws has the mere stopping of trains proved a sufficient
protection.Several times in the experience of Massachusetts' roads
have those in charge of locomotives, after stopping and while moving
at a slow rate of speed, actually run themselves into draws with
their eyes open, and afterwards been wholly unable to give any
satisfactory explanation of their conduct.But the insufficiency
of stopping as a reliable means of prevention was especially
illustrated in the case of an accident which occurred upon the
Boston & Maine railroad on the morning of the 21st of November,
1862, when the early local passenger train was run into the open
draw of the bridge almost at the entrance to the Boston station.It
so happened that the train had stopped at the Charlestown station
just before going onto the bridge, and at the time the accident
occurred was moving at a speed scarcely faster than a man could
walk; and yet the locomotive was entirely submerged, as the water
at that point is deep, and the only thing which probably saved the
train was that the draw was so narrow and the cars were so long that
the foremost one lodged across the opening, and its forward end only
was beneath the water.At the rate at which the train was moving
the resistance thus offered was sufficient to stop it, though, even
as it was, no less than six persons lost their lives and a much
larger number were more or less injured.Here all the precautions
imposed by the Connecticut law were taken, and served only to
reveal the weak point in it.The accident was due to the neglect of
the corporation in not having the draw and its system of signals
interlocked in such a way that the movement of the one should
automatically cause a corresponding movement of the other; and this
neglect in high quarters made it possible for a careless employé to
open the draw on a particularly dark and foggy morning, while he
forgot at the same time to shift his signals.An exactly similar
instance of carelessness on the part of an employé resulted in the
derailment of a train upon the Long Branch line of the Central Road
of New Jersey at the Shrewsbury river draw on August 9, 1877.In
this case the safety signal was shown while the draw fastening had
been left unsecured.The jar of the passing train threw the draw
slightly open so as to disconnect the tracks; thus causing the
derailment of the train, which subsequently plunged over the side
of the bridge.Fortunately the tide was out, or there would have
been a terrible loss of life; as it was, some seventy persons were
injured, five of whom subsequently died.This accident also, like
that on the Boston & Maine road in 1862, very forcibly illustrated
the necessity of an interlocking apparatus.The safety signal was
shown before the draw was secured, which should have been impossible.[7] Chapters XVII and XVIII.Prior to the year 1873 there is no consecutive record of this or
any other class of railroad accidents occurring in America, but
during the six years 1873-8 there occurred twenty-one cases of
minor disaster at draws, three only of them to passenger trains.Altogether, excluding the Shrewsbury river accident, these resulted
in the death of five employés and injury to one other.In Great Britain not a single case of disaster of any
description has been reported as occurring at a draw-bridge since
the year 1870, when the present system of official Board of Trade
reports was begun.The lesson clearly to be drawn from a careful
investigation of all the American accidents reported would seem to
be that a statute provision making compulsory the interlocking of
all draws in railroad bridges with a proper and infallible system
of signals might have claims on the consideration of an intelligent
legislature; not so an enactment which compels the stopping of
trains at points where danger is small, and makes no provision as
respects other points where it is great.Great as were the terrors inspired by the Norwalk disaster in those
comparatively early days of railroad experience, and deep as the
impression on the public memory must have been to leave its mark
on the statute book even to the present time, that and the similar
disaster at the Richelieu river are believed to have been the only
two of great magnitude which have occurred at open railroad draws.That this should be so is well calculated to excite surprise,
for the draw-bridge precautions against accident in America are
wretchedly crude and inadequate, amounting as a rule to little more
than the primitive balls and targets by day and lanterns by night,
without any system of alarms or interlocking.Electricity as an
adjunct to human care, or a corrective rather of human negligence,
is almost never used; and, in fact, the chief reliance is still on
the vigilance of engine-drivers.But, if accidents at draws have
been comparatively rare and unattended with any considerable loss
of life, it has been far otherwise with the rest of the structures
of which the draw forms a part.Bridge accidents in fact always
have been, and will probably always remain, incomparably the worst
to which travel by rail is exposed.It would be impossible for
corporations to take too great precautions against them, and that
the precautions taken are very great is conclusively shown by the
fact that, with thousands of bridges many times each day subjected
to the strain of the passage at speed of heavy trains, so very few
disasters occur.When they do occur, however, the lessons taught
by them are, though distinct enough, apt to be in one important
respect of a far less satisfactory character than those taught by
collisions.In the case of these last the great resultant fact
speaks for itself.The whole community knows when it sees a block
system, or a stronger car construction, or an improved train brake
suddenly introduced that the sacrifice has not been in vain--that
the lesson has been learned.It is by no means always so in the
case of accidents on bridges.With these the cause of disaster
is apt to be so scientific in its nature that it cannot even be
described, except through the use of engineering terms which to the
mass of readers are absolutely incomprehensible.The simplest of
railroad bridges is an inexplicable mystery to at least ninety-nine
persons out of each hundred.Even when the cause of disaster is
understood, the precautions taken against its recurrence cannot be
seen.From the nature of the case they must consist chiefly of a
better material, or a more scientific construction, or an increased
watchfulness on the part of officials and subordinates.This,
however, is not apparent on the surface, and, when the next accident
of the same nature occurs, the inference, as inevitable as it is
usually unjust, is at once drawn that the one which preceded it
had been productive of no results.The truth of this was strongly
illustrated by the two bridge accidents which happened, the one at
Ashtabula, Ohio, on the 29th of December, 1876, and the other at
Tariffville, Connecticut, on the 15th of January, 1878.There has been no recent disaster which combined more elements
of horror or excited more widespread public emotion than that at
Ashtabula bridge.It was, indeed, so terrible in its character and
so heart-rending in its details, that for the time being it fairly
divided the attention of the country with that dispute over the
presidential succession, then the subject uppermost in the minds of
all.A blinding northeasterly snow-storm, accompanied by a heavy
wind, prevailed throughout the day which preceded the accident,
greatly impeding the movement of trains.The Pacific express over
the Michigan Southern & Lake Shore road had left Erie, going west,
considerably behind its time, and had been started only with great
difficulty and with the assistance of four locomotives.It was due
at Ashtabula at about 5.30 o'clock P.M., but was three hours late,
and, the days being then at their shortest, when it arrived at the
bridge which was the scene of the accident the darkness was so great
that nothing could be seen through the driving snow by those on the
leading locomotive even for a distance of 50 feet ahead.The train
was made up of two heavy locomotives, four baggage, mail and express
cars, one smoking car, two ordinary coaches, a drawing-room car
and three sleepers, being in all two locomotives and eleven cars,
in the order named, containing, as nearly as can be ascertained,
190 human beings, of whom 170 were passengers.Ashtabula bridge is
situated only about 1,000 feet east of the station of the same name,
and spans a deep ravine, at the bottom of which flows a shallow
stream, some two or three feet in depth, which empties into Lake
Erie a mile or two away.The bridge was an iron Howe truss of 150
feet span, elevated 69 feet above the bottom of the ravine, and
supported at either end by solid masonwork abutments.As the train approached the bridge it had
to force its way through a heavy snow-drift, and, when it passed
onto it, it was moving at a speed of some twelve or fourteen miles
an hour.The entire length of the bridge afforded space only for
two of the express cars at most in addition to the locomotives,
so that when the wheels of the leading locomotive rested on the
western abutment of the bridge nine of the eleven cars which made up
the train, including all those in which there were passengers, had
yet to reach its eastern end.At the instant when the train stood
in this position, the engineer of the leading locomotive heard a
sudden cracking sound apparently beneath him, and thought he felt
the bridge giving way.Instantly pulling the throttle valve wide
open, his locomotive gave a spring forward and, as it did so, the
bridge fell, the rear wheels of his tender falling with it.The
jerk and impetus of the locomotive, however, sufficed to tear out
the coupling, and as his tender was dragged up out of the abyss
onto the track, though its rear wheels did not get upon the rails,
the frightened engineer caught a fearful glimpse of the second
locomotive as it seemed to turn and then fall bottom upwards into
the ravine.The bridge had given way, not at once but by a slowly
sinking motion, which began at the point where the pressure was
heaviest, under the two locomotives and at the west abutment.There
being two tracks, and this train being on the southernmost of the
two, the southern truss had first yielded, letting that side of
the bridge down, and rolling, as it were, the second locomotive
and the cars immediately behind it off to the left and quite clear
of a straight line drawn between the two abutments; then almost
immediately the other truss gave way and the whole bridge fell, but
in doing so swung slightly to the right.Before this took place the
entire train with the exception of the last two sleepers had reached
the chasm, each car as it passed over falling nearer than the one
which had preceded it to the east abutment, and finally the last two
sleepers came, and, without being deflected from their course at
all, plunged straight down and fell upon the wreck of the bridge at
its east end.It was necessarily all the work of a few seconds.At the bottom of the ravine the snow lay waist deep and the stream
was covered with ice some eight inches in thickness.Upon this
were piled up the fallen cars and engine, the latter on top of the
former near the western abutment and upside down.All the passenger
cars were heated by stoves.At first a dead silence seemed to
follow the successive shocks of the falling mass.In less than
two minutes, however, the fire began to show itself and within
fifteen the holocaust was at its height.As usual, it was a mass of
human beings, all more or less stunned, a few killed, many injured
and helpless, and more yet simply pinned down to watch, in the
possession as full as helpless of all their faculties, the rapid
approach of the flames.The number of those killed outright seems
to have been surprisingly small.In the last car, for instance,
no one was lost.This was due to the energy and presence of mind
of the porter, a <DW64> named Steward, who, when he felt the car
resting firmly on its side, broke a window and crawled through it,
and then passed along breaking the other windows and extricating
the passengers until all were gotten out.Those in the other cars
were far less fortunate.Though an immediate alarm had been given
in the neighboring town, the storm was so violent and the snow so
deep that assistance arrived but slowly.Nor when it did arrive
could much be effected.The essential thing was to extinguish the
flames.The means for so doing were close at hand in a steam pump
belonging to the railroad company, while an abundance of hose could
have been procured at another place but a short distance off.In
the excitement and agitation of the moment contradictory orders
were given, even to forbidding the use of the pump, and practically
no effort to extinguish the fire was made.Within half an hour of
the accident the flames were at their height, and when the next
morning dawned nothing remained in the ravine but a charred and
undistinguishable mass of car trucks, brake-rods, twisted rails and
bent and tangled bridge iron, with the upturned locomotive close to
the west abutment.In this accident some eighty persons are supposed to have lost
their lives, while over sixty others were injured.The exact number
of those killed can never be known, however, as more than half of
those reported were utterly consumed in the fire; indeed, even of
the bodies recovered scarcely one half could be identified.Of the
cause of the disaster much was said at the time in language most
unnecessarily scientific;--but little was required to be said.It
admitted of no extenuation.An iron bridge, built in the early days
of iron-bridges,--that which fell under the train at Ashtabula, was
faulty in its original construction, and the indications of weakness
it had given had been distinct, but had not been regarded.That it
had stood so long and that it should have given way when it did,
were equally matters for surprise.A double track bridge, it should
naturally have fallen under the combined pressure of trains moving
simultaneously in opposite directions.The strain under which it
yielded was not a particularly severe one, even taken in connection
with the great atmospheric pressure of the storm then prevailing.It was, in short, one of those disasters, fortunately of infrequent
occurrence, with which accident has little if any connection.It was due to original inexperience and to subsequent ignorance
or carelessness, or possibly recklessness as criminal as it was
fool-hardy.Besides being a bridge accident, this was also a stove accident,--in
this respect a repetition of Angola.One of the most remarkable
features about it, indeed, was the fearful rapidity with which
the fire spread, and the incidents of its spread detailed in the
subsequent evidence of the survivors were simply horrible.Men,
women and children, full of the instinct of self-preservation, were
caught and pinned fast for the advancing flames, while those who
tried to rescue them were driven back by the heat and compelled
helplessly to listen to their shrieks.It is, however, unnecessary
to enter into these details, for they are but the repetition of
an experience which has often been told, and they do but enforce
a lesson which the railroad companies seem resolved not to learn.Unquestionably the time in this country will come when through
trains will be heated from a locomotive or a heating-car.That time,
however, had not yet come.Meanwhile the evidence would seem to show
that at Ashtabula, as at Angola, at least two lives were sacrificed
in the subsequent fire to each one lost in the immediate shock of
the disaster.[8]

  [8] The Angola was probably the most impressively horrible of the
  many "stove accidents."That which occurred near Prospect, N. Y.,
  upon the Buffalo, Corry & Pittsburgh road, on December 24, 1872,
  should not, however, be forgotten.In this case a trestle bridge
  gave way precipitating a passenger train some thirty feet to the
  bottom of a ravine, where the cars caught fire from the stoves.Nineteen lives were lost, mostly by burning.The Richmond Switch
  disaster of April 19, 1873, on the New York, Providence & Boston
  road was of the same character.Three passengers only were there
  burned to death, but after the disaster the flames rushed "through
  the car as quickly as if the wood had been a lot of hay," and, after
  those who were endeavoring to release the wounded and imprisoned men
  were driven away, their cries were for some time heard through the
  smoke and flame.But a few days more than a year after the Ashtabula accident another
catastrophe, almost exactly similar in its details, occurred on
the Connecticut Western road.It is impossible to even estimate
the amount of overhauling to which bridges throughout the country
had in the meanwhile been subjected, or the increased care used
in their examination.All that can be said is that during the
year 1877 no serious accident due to the inherent weakness of any
bridge occcurred on the 70,000 miles of American railroad.Neither,
so far as can be ascertained, was the Tariffville disaster to be
referred to that cause.It happened on the evening of January 15,
1878.A large party of excursionists were returning from a Moody
and Sankey revival meeting on a special train, consisting of two
locomotives and ten cars.Half a mile west of Tariffville the
railroad crosses the Farmington river.The bridge at this point was
a wooden Howe truss, with two spans of 163 feet each.It had been
in use about seven years and, originally of ample strength and good
construction, there is no evidence that its strength had since been
unduly impaired by neglect or exposure.It should, therefore, have
sufficed to bear twice the strain to which it was now subjected.Exactly as at Ashtabula, however, the west span of the bridge gave
way under the train just as the leading locomotives passed onto the
tressel-work beyond it: the ice broke under the falling wreck, and
the second locomotive with four cars were precipitated into the
river.The remaining cars were stopped by the rear end of the third
car, resting as it did on the centre pier of the bridge, and did
not leave the rails.The fall to the surface of the ice was about
ten feet.There was no fire to add to the horrors in this case, but
thirteen persons were crushed to death or drowned, and thirty-three
others injured.[9]

  [9] Of the same general character with the Tariffville and Ashtabula
  accidents were those which occurred on November 1, 1855, upon the
  Pacific railroad of Missouri at the bridge over the Gasconade, and
  on July 27, 1875, upon the Northern Pacific at the bridge over the
  Mississippi near Brainerd.In the first of these accidents the
  bridge gave way under an excursion train, in honor of the opening
  of the road, and its chief engineer was among the killed.The train
  fell some thirty feet, and 22 persons lost their lives while over 50
  suffered serious injuries.At Brainerd the train,--a "mixed" one,--went down nearly 80 feet
  into the river.The locomotive and several cars had passed the span
  which fell, in safety, but were pulled back and went down on top
  of the train.There were but few passengers in it, of whom three
  were killed.In falling the caboose car at the rear of the train,
  in which most of the passengers were, struck on a pier and broke in
  two, leaving several passengers in it.In the case of the Gasconade,
  the disaster was due to the weakness of the bridge, which fell under
  the weight of the train.There is some question as to the Brainerd
  accident, whether it was occasioned by weakness of the bridge or the
  derailment upon it of a freight car.Naturally the popular inference was at once drawn that this was
a mere repetition of the Ashtabula experience,--that the fearful
earlier lesson had been thrown away on a corporation either
unwilling or not caring to learn.The newspapers far and wide
resounded with ill considered denunciation, and the demand was loud
for legislation of the crudest conceivable character, especially
a law prohibiting the passage over any bridge of two locomotives
attached to one passenger train.The fact, however, seems to be
that, except in its superficial details, the Tariffville disaster
had no features in common with that at Ashtabula; as nearly as
can be ascertained it was due neither to the weakness nor to the
overloading of the bridge.Though the evidence subsequently given
is not absolutely conclusive on this point, the probabilities
would seem to be that, while on the bridge, the second locomotive
was derailed in some unexplained way and consequently fell on
the stringers which yielded under the sudden blow.The popular
impression, therefore, as to the bearing which the first of these
two strikingly similar accidents had upon the last tended only to
bring about results worse than useless.The bridge fell, not under
the steady weight of two locomotives, but under the sudden shock
incident to the derailment of one.The remedy, therefore, lay in the
direction of so planking or otherwise guarding the floors of similar
bridges that in case of derailment the locomotives or cars should
not fall on the stringers or greatly diverge from the rails so as
to endanger the trusses.On the other hand the suggestion of a law
prohibiting the passage over bridges of more than one locomotive
with any passenger train, while in itself little better than a legal
recognition of bad bridge building, also served to divert public
attention from the true lesson of the disaster.Another newspaper
precaution, very favorably considered at the time, was the putting
of one locomotive, where two had to be used, at the rear end of the
train as a pusher, instead of both in front.This expedient might
indeed obviate one cause of danger, but it would do so only by
substituting for it another which has been the fruitful source of
some of the worst railroad disasters on record.[10]

  [10] "The objectionable and dangerous practice also employed on some
  railways of assisting trains up inclines by means of pilot engines
  in the rear instead of in front, has led to several accidents in
  the past year and should be discontinued."--_General Report to the
  Board of Trade upon the Accidents on the Railways of Great Britain
  in 1878, p.Long, varied and terrible as the record of bridge disasters has
become, there are, nevertheless, certain very simple and inexpensive
precautions against them, which, altogether too frequently,
corporations do not and will not take.At Ashtabula the bridge
gave way.There was no derailment as there seems to have been
at Tariffville.The sustaining power of a bridge is, of course,
a question comparatively difficult of ascertainment.A fatal
weakness in this respect may be discernable only to the eye of a
trained expert.Derailment, however, either upon a bridge, or when
approaching it, is in the vast majority of cases a danger perfectly
easy to guard against.The precautions are simple and they are not
expensive, yet, taking the railroads of the United States as a
whole, it may well be questioned whether the bridges at which they
have been taken do not constitute the exception rather than the
rule.Not only is the average railroad superintendent accustomed
to doing his work and running his road under a constant pressure to
make both ends meet, which, as he well knows, causes his own daily
bread to depend upon the economies he can effect; but, while he
finds it hard work at best to provide for the multifarious outlays,
long immunity from disaster breeds a species of recklessness even
in the most cautious:--and yet the single mishap in a thousand
must surely fall to the lot of some one.Many years ago the
terrible results which must soon or late be expected wherever the
consequences of a derailment on the approaches to a bridge are not
securely guarded against, were illustrated by a disaster on the
Great Western railroad of Canada, which combined many of the worst
horrors of both the Norwalk and the New Hamburg tragedies; more
recently the almost forgotten lesson was enforced again on the
Vermont & Massachusetts road, upon the bridge over the Miller River,
at Athol.The accident last referred to occurred on the 16th of
June, 1870, but, though forcible enough as a reminder, it was tame
indeed in comparison with the Des Jardines Canal disaster, which
is still remembered though it happened so long ago as the 17th of
March, 1857.The Great Western railroad of Canada crossed the canal by a bridge
at an elevation of about sixty feet.At the time of the accident
there were some eighteen feet of water in the canal, though, as
is usual in Canada at that season, it was covered by ice some two
feet in thickness.On the afternoon of the 17th of March as the
local accommodation train from Hamilton was nearing the bridge,
its locomotive, though it was then moving at a very slow rate of
speed, was in some way thrown from the track and onto the timbers
of the bridge.These it cut through, and then falling heavily on
the string-pieces it parted them, and instantly pitched headlong
down upon the frozen surface of the canal below, dragging after it
the tender, baggage car and two passenger cars, which composed the
whole train.There was nothing whatever to break the fall of sixty
feet; and even then two feet of ice only intervened between the
ruins of the train and the bottom of the canal eighteen feet below.Two feet of solid ice will afford no contemptible resistance to a
falling body; the locomotive and tender crushed heavily through
it and instantly sank out of sight.In falling the baggage car
struck a corner of the tender and was thus thrown some ten yards
to one side, and was followed by the first passenger car, which,
turning a somersault as it went, fell on its roof and was crushed to
fragments, but only partially broke through the ice, upon which the
next car fell endwise, and rested in that position.That every human
being in the first car was either crushed or drowned seems most
natural; the only cause for astonishment is found in the fact that
any one should have survived such a catastrophe,--a tumble of sixty
feet on ice as solid as a rock!Yet of four persons in the baggage
car three went down with it, and not one of them was more than
slightly injured.The engineer and fireman, and the occupants of the
second passenger car, were less fortunate.The former were found
crushed under the locomotive at the bottom of the canal; while of
the latter ten were killed, and not one escaped severe injury.Very
rarely indeed in the history of railroad accidents have so large a
portion of those on the train lost their lives as in this case, for
out of ninety persons sixty perished, and in the number was included
every woman and child among the passengers, with a single exception.There were two circumstances about this disaster worthy of especial
notice.In the first place, as well as can now be ascertained in
the absence of any trustworthy record of an investigation into
causes, the accident was easily preventable.It appears to have
been immediately caused by the derailment of a locomotive, however
occasioned, just as it was entering on a swing draw-bridge.Thrown
from the tracks, there was nothing in the flooring to prevent the
derailed locomotive from deflecting from its course until it toppled
over the ends of the ties, nor were the ties and the flooring
apparently sufficiently strong to sustain it even while it held to
its course.Under such circumstances the derailment of a locomotive
upon any bridge can mean only destruction; it meant it then,
it means it now; and yet our country is to-day full of bridges
constructed in an exactly similar way.To make accidents from this
cause, if not impossible at least highly improbable, it is only
necessary to make the ties and flooring of all bridges between the
tracks and for three feet on either side of them sufficiently strong
to sustain the whole weight of a train off the track and in motion,
while a third rail, or strong truss of wood, securely fastened,
should be laid down midway between the rails throughout the entire
length of the bridge and its approaches.With this arrangement, as
the flanges of the wheels are on the inside, it must follow that in
case of derailment and a divergence to one side or the other of the
bridge, the inner side of the flange will come against the central
rail or truss just so soon as the divergence amounts to half the
space between the rails, which in the ordinary gauge is two feet and
four inches.The wheels must then glide along this guard, holding
the train from any further divergence from its course, until it
can be checked.Meanwhile, as the ties and flooring extend for the
space of three feet outside of the track, a sufficient support is
furnished by them for the other wheels.A legislative enactment
compelling the construction of all bridges in this way, coupled with
additional provisions for interlocking of draws with their signals
in cases of bridges across navigable waters, would be open to
objection that laws against dangers of accident by rail have almost
invariably proved ineffective when they were not absurd, but in
itself, if enforced, it might not improbably render disasters like
those at Norwalk and Des Jardines terrors of the past.CAR-COUPLINGS IN DERAILMENTS.Wholly apart from the derailment, which was the real occasion of
the Des Jardines disaster, there was one other cause which largely
contributed to its fatality, if indeed that fatality was not in
greatest part immediately due to it.The question as to what is the best method of coupling together
the several individual vehicles which make up every railroad
train has always been much discussed among railroad mechanics.The decided weight of opinion has been in favor of the strongest
and closest couplings, so that under no circumstances should the
train separate into parts.Taking all forms of railroad accident
together, this conclusion is probably sound.It is, however, at
best only a balancing of disadvantages,--a mere question as to
which practice involves the least amount of danger.Yet a very
terrible demonstration that there are two sides to this as to most
other questions was furnished at Des Jardines.It was the custom
on the Great Western road not only to couple the cars together in
the method then in general use, but also, as is often done now, to
connect them by heavy chains on each side of the centre coupling.Accordingly when the locomotive broke through the Des Jardines
bridge, it dragged the rest of the train hopelessly after it.This
certainly would not have happened had the modern self-coupler been
in use, and probably would not have happened had the cars been
connected only by the ordinary link and pins; for the train was
going very slowly, and the signal for brakes was given in ample time
to apply them vigorously before the last cars came to the opening,
into which they were finally dragged by the dead weight before them
and not hurried by their own momentum.On the other hand, we have not far to go in search of scarcely less
fatal disasters illustrating with equal force the other side of the
proposition, in the terrible consequences which have ensued from the
separation of cars in cases of derailment.Take, for instance, the
memorable accident of June 17, 1858, near Port Jervis, on the Erie
railway.As the express train from New York was running at a speed of about
thirty miles an hour over a perfectly straight piece of track
between Otisville and Port Jervis, shortly after dark on the evening
of that day, it encountered a broken rail.The train was made up
of a locomotive, two baggage cars and five passenger cars, all of
which except the last passed safely over the fractured rail.The
last car was apparently derailed, and drew the car before it off the
track.These two cars were then dragged along, swaying fearfully
from side to side, for a distance of some four hundred feet, when
the couplings at last snapped and they went over the embankment,
which was there some thirty feet in height.As they rushed down the
<DW72> the last car turned fairly over, resting finally on its roof,
while one of its heavy iron trucks broke through and fell upon the
passengers beneath, killing and maiming them.The other car, more
fortunate, rested at last upon its side on a pile of stones at the
foot of the embankment.Six persons were killed and fifty severely
injured; all of the former in the last car.In this case, had the couplings held, the derailed cars would
not have gone over the embankment and but slight injuries would
have been sustained.Modern improvements have, however, created
safeguards sufficient to prevent the recurrence of other accidents
under the same conditions as that at Port Jervis.The difficulty lay
in the inability to stop a train, though moving at only moderate
speed, within a reasonable time.The wretched inefficiency of the
old hand-brake in a sudden emergency received one more illustration.The train seems to have run nearly half a mile after the accident
took place before it could be stopped, although the engineer had
instant notice of it and reversed his locomotive.The couplings did
not snap until a distance had been traversed in which the modern
train-brake would have reduced the speed to a point at which they
would have been subjected to no dangerous strain.The accident ten years later at Carr's Rock, sixteen miles west of
Port Jervis, on the same road, was again very similar to the one
just described: and yet in this case the parting of the couplings
alone prevented the rear of the train from dragging its head to
destruction.Both disasters were occasioned by broken rails; but,
while the first occurred on a tangent, the last was at a point where
the road skirted the hills, by a sharp curve, upon the outer side of
which was a steep declivity of some eighty feet, jagged with rock
and bowlders.It befell the night express on the 14th of April,
1876.The train was a long one, consisting of the locomotive, three
baggage and express, and seven passenger cars, and it encountered
the broken rail while rounding the curve at a high rate of speed.Again all except the last car, passed over the fracture in safety;
this was snapped, as it were, off the track and over the embankment.At first it was dragged along, but only for a short distance; the
intense strain then broke the coupling between the four rear cars
and the head of the train, and, the last of the four being already
over the embankment, the others almost instantly toppled over after
it and rolled down the ravine.A passenger on this portion of the
train, described the car he was in "as going over and over, until
the outer roof was torn off, the sides fell out, and the inner roof
was crushed in."Twenty-four persons were killed and eighty injured;
but in this instance, as in that at Des Jardines, the only occasion
for surprise was that there were any survivors.Accidents arising from the parting of defective couplings have of
course not been uncommon, and they constitute one of the greatest
dangers incident to heavy gradients; in surmounting inclines freight
trains will, it is found, break in two, and their hinder parts come
thundering down the grade, as was seen at Abergele.The American
passenger trains, in which each car is provided with brakes, are
much less liable than the English, the speed of which is regulated
by brake-vans, to accidents of this description.Indeed, it may be
questioned whether in America any serious disaster has occurred from
the fact that a portion of a passenger train on a road operated by
steam got beyond control in descending an incline.There have been,
however, terrible catastrophes from this cause in England, and that
on the Lancashire & Yorkshire road near Helmshere, a station some
fourteen miles north of Manchester, deserves a prominent place in
the record of railroad accidents.It occurred in the early hours of the morning of the 4th of
September, 1860.There had been a great _fête_ at the Bellevue
Gardens in Manchester on the 3d, upon the conclusion of which some
twenty-five hundred persons crowded at once upon the return trains.Of these there were, on the Lancashire & Yorkshire road, three; the
first consisting of fourteen, the second of thirty-one, and the last
of twenty-four carriages: and they were started, with intervals of
ten minutes between them, at about eleven o'clock at night.The
first train finished its journey in safety.The Helmshere station is at the top of a steep incline.This the second train, drawn by two locomotives, surmounted, and
then stopped for the delivery of passengers.While these were
leaving the carriages, a snap as of fractured iron was heard, and
the guards, looking back, saw the whole rear portion of the train,
consisting of seventeen carriages and a brake-van, detached from
the rest of it and quietly slipping down the incline.The detached
portion was moving so slowly that one of the guards succeeded in
catching the van and applying the brakes; it was, however, already
too late.The velocity was greater than the brake-power could
overcome, and the seventeen carriages kept descending more and
more rapidly.Meanwhile the third train had reached the foot of
the incline and begun to ascend it, when its engineer, on rounding
a curve, caught sight of the descending carriages.He immediately
reversed his engine, but before he could bring his train to a stand
they were upon him.Fortunately the van-brakes of the detached
carriages, though insufficient to stop them, yet did reduce their
speed; the collision nevertheless was terrific.The force of the
blow, so far as the advancing train was concerned, expended itself
on the locomotive, which was demolished, while the passengers
escaped with a fright.With them there was nothing to break the blow, and the two hindmost
carriages were crushed to fragments and their passengers scattered
over the line.It was shortly after midnight, and the excursionists
clambered out of the trains and rushed frantically about, impeding
every effort to clear away the _débris_ and rescue the injured,
whose shrieks and cries were incessant.The bodies of ten persons,
one of whom had died of suffocation, were ultimately taken out from
the wreck, and twenty-two others sustained fractures of limbs.At Des Jardines the couplings were too strong; at Port Jervis and
at Helmshere they were not strong enough; at Carr's Rock they gave
way not a moment too soon."There are objections to a plenum and
there are objections to a vacuum," as Dr.Johnson remarked, "but a
plenum or a vacuum it must be."There are no arguments, however,
in favor of putting railroad stations or sidings upon an inclined
plane, and then not providing what the English call "catch-points"
or "scotches" to prevent such disasters as those at Abergele or
Helmshere.In these two instances alone the want of them cost
over fifty lives.In railroad mechanics there are after all some
principles susceptible of demonstration.That vehicles, as well as
water, will run down hill may be classed among them.That these
principles should still be ignored is hardly less singular than it
is surprising.THE REVERE CATASTROPHE.The terrible disaster which occurred in front of the little
station-building at Revere, six miles from Boston on the Eastern
railroad of Massachusetts, in August 1871, was, properly speaking,
not an accident at all; it was essentially a catastrophe--the
legitimate and almost inevitable final outcome of an antiquated and
insufficient system.As such it should long remain a subject for
prayerful meditation to all those who may at any time be entrusted
with the immediate operating of railroads.It was terribly dramatic,
but it was also frightfully instructive; and while the lesson was by
no means lost, it yet admits of further and advantageous study.For,
like most other men whose lives are devoted to a special calling,
the managers of railroads are apt to be very much wedded to their
own methods, and attention has already more than once been called to
the fact that, when any new emergency necessitates a new appliance,
they not infrequently, as Captain Tyler well put it in his report
to the Board of Trade for the year 1870, "display more ingenuity in
finding objections than in overcoming them."[Illustration: map]

The Eastern railroad of Massachusetts connects Boston with Portland,
in the state of Maine, by a line which is located close along the
sea-shore.Between Boston and Lynn, a distance of eleven miles, the
main road is in large part built across the salt marshes, but there
is a branch which leaves it at Everett, a small station some miles
out of Boston, and thence, running deviously through a succession
of towns on the higher ground, connects with the main track again
at Lynn; thus making what is known in England as a loop-road.At
the time of the Revere accident this branch was equipped with
but a single track, and was operated wholly by schedule without
any reliance on the telegraph; and, indeed, there were not even
telegraphic offices at a number of the stations upon it.Revere,
the name of the station where the accident took place, was on the
main line about five miles from Boston and two miles from Everett,
where the Saugus branch, as the loop-road was called, began.The
accompanying diagram shows the relative position of the several
points and of the main and branch lines, a thorough appreciation of
which is essential to a correct understanding of the disaster.The travel over the Eastern railroad is of a somewhat exceptional
nature, varying in a more than ordinary degree with the different
seasons of the year.During the winter months the corporation had,
in 1871, to provide for a regular passenger movement of about
seventy-five thousand a week, but in the summer what is known
as the excursion and pleasure travel not infrequently increased
the number to one hundred and ten thousand, and even more.As a
natural consequence, during certain weeks of each summer, and more
especially towards the close of August, it was no unusual thing for
the corporation to find itself taxed beyond its utmost resources.It
is emergencies of this description, periodically occurring on every
railroad, which always subject to the final test the organization
and discipline of companies and the capacity of superintendents.A
railroad in quiet times is like a ship in steady weather; almost
anybody can manage the one or sail the other.It is the sudden
stress which reveals the undeveloped strength or the hidden
weakness; and the truly instructive feature in the Revere accident
lay in the amount of hidden weakness everywhere which was brought to
light under that sudden stress.During the week ending with that
Saturday evening upon which the disaster occurred the rolling stock
of the road had been heavily taxed, not only to accommodate the
usual tide of summer travel, then at its full flood, but also those
attending a military muster and two large camp-meetings upon its
line.The number of passengers going over it had accordingly risen
from about one hundred and ten thousand, the full summer average,
to over one hundred and forty thousand; while instead of the one
hundred and fifty-two trains a day provided for in the running
schedule, there were no less than one hundred and ninety-two.It
had never been the custom with those managing the road to place any
reliance upon the telegraph in directing the train movement, and no
use whatever appears to have been made of it towards straightening
out the numerous hitches inevitable from so sudden an increase in
that movement.If an engine broke down, or a train got off the
track, there had accordingly throughout that week been nothing
done, except patient and general waiting, until things got in
motion again; each conductor or station-master had to look out for
himself, under the running regulations of the road, and need expect
no assistance from headquarters.This, too, in spite of the fact
that, including the Saugus branch, no less than ninety-three of the
entire one hundred and fifteen miles of road operated by the company
were supplied only with a single track.The whole train movement,
both of the main line and of the branches, intricate in the extreme
as it was, thus depended solely on a schedule arrangement and the
watchful intelligence of individual employés.Not unnaturally,
therefore, as the week drew to a close the confusion became so
great that the trains reached and left the Boston station with an
almost total disregard of the schedule; while towards the evening
of Saturday the employés of the road at that station directed their
efforts almost exclusively to dispatching trains as fast as cars
could be procured, thus trying to keep it as clear as possible of
the throng of impatient travellers which continually blocked it up.Taken altogether the situation illustrated in a very striking manner
that singular reliance of the corporation on the individuality
and intelligence of its employés, which in another connection is
referred to as one of the most striking characteristics of American
railroad management, without a full appreciation of which it is
impossible to understand its using or failing to use certain
appliances.According to the regular schedule four trains should have left the
Boston station in succession during the hour and a half between 6.30
and eight o'clock P.M.: a Saugus branch train for Lynn at 6.30; a
second Saugus branch train at seven; an accommodation train, which
ran eighteen miles over the main line, at 7.15; and finally the
express train through to Portland, also over the main line, at
eight o'clock.The collision at Revere was between these last two
trains, the express overtaking and running into the rear of the
accommodation train; but it was indirectly caused by the delays
and irregularity in movement of the two branch trains.It will be
noticed that, according to the schedule, both of the branch trains
should have preceded the accommodation train; in the prevailing
confusion, however, the first of the two branch trains did not leave
the station until about seven o'clock, thirty minutes behind its
time, and it was followed forty minutes later, not by the second
branch train, but by the accommodation train, which in its turn was
twenty-five minutes late.Thirteen minutes afterwards the second
Saugus branch train, which should have preceded, followed it, being
nearly an hour out of time.Then at last came the Portland express,
which got away practically on time, at a few minutes after eight
o'clock.All of these four trains went out over the same track as
far as the junction at Everett, but at that point the first and
third of the four were to go off on the branch, while the second and
fourth kept on over the main line.Between these last two trains
the running schedule of the road allowed an ample time-interval of
forty-five minutes, which, however, on this occasion was reduced,
through the delay in starting, to some fifteen or twenty minutes.No causes of further delay, therefore, arising, the simple case
was presented of a slow accommodation train being sent out to run
eighteen miles in advance of a fast express train, with an interval
of twenty minutes between them.Unfortunately, however, the accommodation train was speedily
subjected to another and very serious delay.It has been mentioned
that the Saugus branch was a single track road, and the rules of
the company were explicit that no outward train was to pass onto
the branch at Everett until any inward train then due there should
have arrived and passed off it.There was no siding at the junction,
upon which an outward branch train could be temporarily placed to
wait for the inward train, thus leaving the main track clear; and
accordingly, under a strict construction of the rules, any outward
branch train while awaiting the arrival at Everett of an inward
branch train was to be kept standing on the main track, completely
blocking it.The outward branch trains, it subsequently appeared,
were often delayed at the junction, but no practical difficulty had
arisen from this cause, as the employé in charge of the signals
and switches there, exercising his common sense, had been in the
custom of moving any delayed train temporarily out of the way onto
the branch or the other main track, under protection of a flag,
and thus relieving the block.The need of a siding to permit the
passage of trains at this point had not been felt, simply because
the employé in charge there had used the branch or other main track
as a siding.On the day of the accident this employé happened to be
sick, and absent from his post.His substitute either had no common
sense or did not feel called upon to use it, if its use involved
any increase of responsibility.Accordingly, when a block took
place, the simple letter of the rule was followed;--and it is almost
needless to add that a block did take place on the afternoon of
August 26th.The first of the branch trains, it will be remembered, had left
Boston at about seven o'clock, instead of at 6.30, its schedule
time.On arriving at Everett this train should have met and passed
an inward branch train, which was timed to leave Lynn at six
o'clock, but which, owing to some accident to its locomotive, and
partaking of the general confusion of the day, on this particular
afternoon did not leave the Lynn station until 7.30 o'clock, or one
hour and a half after its schedule time, and one half-hour after
the other train had left Boston.Accordingly, when the Boston train
reached the junction its conductor found himself confronted by the
rule forbidding him to enter upon the branch until the Lynn train
then due should have passed off it, and so he quietly waited on the
outward track of the main line, blocking it completely to traffic.He had not waited long before a special locomotive, on its way from
Boston to Salem, came up and stopped behind him.This was presently
followed by the accommodation train.Then the next branch train came
along, and finally the Portland express.At such a time, and at that
period of railroad development, there was something ludicrous about
the spectacle.Here was a road utterly unable to accommodate its
passengers with cars, while a succession of trains were standing
idle for hours, because a locomotive had broken down ten miles off.The telegraph was there, but the company was not in the custom of
putting any reliance upon it.A simple message to the branch trains
to meet and pass at any point other than that fixed in the schedule
would have solved the whole difficulty; but, no!--there were the
rules, and all the rolling stock of the road might gather at Everett
in solemn procession, but, until the locomotive at Lynn could be
repaired, the law of the Medes and Persians was plain; and in this
case it read that the telegraph was a new-fangled and unreliable
auxiliary.And so the lengthening procession stood there long enough
for the train which caused it to have gone to its destination and
come back dragging the disabled locomotive from Lynn behind it to
again take its place in the block.At last, at about ten minutes after eight o'clock, the long-expected
Lynn train made its appearance, and the first of the branch trains
from Boston immediately went off the main line.The road was now
clear for the accommodation train, which had been standing some
twelve or fifteen minutes in the block, but which from the moment
of again starting was running on the schedule time of the Portland
express.Every minute was vital,
and yet he never thought to look at his watch.He had a vague
impression that he had been delayed some six or eight minutes, when
in reality he had been delayed fifteen; and, though he was running
wholly out of his schedule time, he took not a single precaution, so
persuaded was he that every one knew where he was.The confusion among those in charge of the various engines and
trains was, indeed, general and complete.As the Portland express
was about to leave the Boston station, the superintendent of the
road, knowing by the non-arrival of the branch train from Lynn that
there must be a block at the Everett junction, had directed the
depot-master to caution the engineer to look out for the trains
ahead of him.The order, a merely verbal one, was delivered after
the train had started, the depot-master walking along by the side of
the slowly-moving locomotive, and was either incorrectly transmitted
or not fully understood; the engine-driver supposed it to apply to
the branch train which had started just before him, out of both its
schedule time and schedule place.Presently, at the junction, he was
stopped by the signal man of this train.The course of reasoning he
would then have had to pass through to divine the true situation
of affairs and to guide himself safely under the schedule in the
light of the running rules was complicated indeed, and somewhat as
follows: "The branch train," he should have argued to himself, "is
stopped, and it is stopped because the train which should have left
Lynn at six o'clock has not yet arrived; but, under the rules, that
train should pass off the branch before the 6.30 train could pass
onto it; if, therefore, the 'wild' train before me is delayed not
only the 6.30 but all intermediate trains must likewise be delayed,
and the accommodation train went out this afternoon after the 6.30
train, so it, too, must be in the block ahead of me; unless, indeed,
as is usually the case, the signal-master has got it out of the
block under the protection of a flag."This line of reasoning was,
perhaps, too intricate; at any rate, the engine-driver did not
follow it out, but, when he saw the tail-lights immediately before
him disappear on the branch, he concluded that the main line was
now clear, and dismissed the depot-master's caution from his mind.Meanwhile, as the engine-driver of this train was fully persuaded
that the only other train in his front had gone off on the branch,
the conductor of the accommodation train was equally persuaded that
the head-light immediately behind him in the block at the junction
had been that of the Portland express which consequently should be
aware of his position.Thus when they left Everett the express was fairly chasing the
accommodation train, and overtaking it with terrible rapidity.Even then no collision ought to have been possible.Unfortunately,
however, the road had no system, even the crudest, of interval
signals; and the utter irregularity prevailing in the train
movement seemed to have demoralized the employés along the line,
who, though they noticed the extreme proximity of the two trains
to each other as they passed various points, all sluggishly took
it for granted that those in charge of them were fully aware of
their relative positions and knew what they were about.Thus, as
the two trains approached the Revere station, they were so close
together as to be on the same piece of straight track at the same
time, and a passenger standing at the rear end of the accommodation
train distinctly saw the head-light of the express locomotive.The
night, however, was not a clear one, for an east wind had prevailed
all day, driving a mist in from the sea which lay in banks over
the marshes, lifting at times so that distant objects were quite
visible, and then obscuring them in its heavy folds.Consequently it
did not at all follow, because the powerful reflecting head-light
of the locomotive was visible from the accommodation train, that
the dim tail-lights of the latter were also visible to those on the
locomotive.The tail-lights in use by
the company were ordinary red lanterns without reflecting power.The station house at Revere stood at the end of a tangent, the
track curving directly before it.In any ordinary weather the
tail-lights of a train standing at this station would have been
visible for a very considerable distance down the track in the
direction of Boston, and even on the night of the accident they
were probably visible for a sufficient distance in which to stop
any train approaching at a reasonable rate of speed.Unfortunately
the engineer of the Portland express did not at once see them,
his attention being wholly absorbed in looking for other signals.Certain freight train tracks to points on the shore diverged from
the main line at Revere, and the engine-drivers of all trains
approaching that place were notified by signals at a masthead close
to the station whether the switches were set for the main line or
for these freight tracks.A red lantern at the masthead indicated
that the main line was closed; in the absence of any signal it
was open.In looking for this signal as he approached Revere the
engine-driver of the Portland express was simply attending closely
to his business, for, had the red light been at the masthead, his
train must at once have been stopped.Unfortunately, however, while
peering through the mist at the masthead he overlooked what was
directly before him, until, when at last he brought his eyes down to
the level, to use his own words at the subsequent inquest, "the tail
lights of the accommodation train seemed to spring right up in his
face."When those in charge of the two trains at almost the same moment
became aware of the danger, there was yet an interval of some eight
hundred feet between them.The express train was, however, moving
at a speed of some twenty-five or thirty miles an hour, and was
equipped only with the old-fashioned hand-brake.In response to the
sharply given signal from the whistle these were rapidly set, but
the rails were damp and slippery, so that the wheels failed to catch
upon them, and, when everything was done which could be done, the
eight hundred feet of interval sufficed only to reduce the speed of
the colliding locomotive to about ten miles an hour.In the rear car of the accommodation train there were at the moment
of the accident some sixty-five or seventy human beings, seated
and standing.They were of both sexes and of all ages; for it was
a Saturday evening in August, and many persons had, through the
confusion of the trains, been long delayed in their return from
the city to their homes at the sea-side.The first intimation the
passengers had of the danger impending over them was from the
sudden and lurid illumination of the car by the glare from the
head-light of the approaching locomotive.One of them who survived
the disaster, though grievously injured, described how he was
carelessly watching a young man standing in the aisle, laughing
and gayly chatting with four young girls, who were seated, when he
saw him turn and instantly his face, in the sudden blaze of the
head-light, assumed a look of frozen horror which was the single
thing in the accident indelibly impressed on the survivor's memory;
that look haunted him.The car was crowded to its full capacity, and
the colliding locomotive struck it with such force as to bury itself
two-thirds of its length in it.At the instant of the crash a panic
had seized upon the passengers, and a sort of rush had taken place
to the forward end of the car, into which furniture, fixtures and
human beings were crushed in a shapeless, indistinguishable mass.Meanwhile the blow had swept away the smoke-stack of the locomotive,
and its forward truck had been forced back in some unaccountable way
until it rested between its driving wheels and the tender, leaving
the entire boiler inside of the passenger car and supported on its
rear truck.The valves had been so broken as to admit of the free
escape of the scalding steam, while the coals from the fire-box
were scattered among the _débris_, and coming in contact with the
fluid from the broken car lamps kindled the whole into a rapid
blaze.Neither was the fire confined to the last car of the train.It has been mentioned that in the block at Everett a locomotive
returning to Salem had found itself stopped just in advance of the
accommodation train.At the suggestion of the engine-driver of that
train this locomotive had there coupled on to it, and consequently
made a part of it at Revere.When the collision took place,
therefore, the four cars of which the accommodation train was made
up were crushed between the weight of the entire colliding train on
one side and that of two locomotives on the other.That they were
not wholly demolished was due simply to the fact that the last car
yielded to the blow, and permitted the locomotive of the express
train fairly to imbed itself in it.As it was, the remaining cars
were jammed and shattered, and, though the passengers in them
escaped, the oil from the broken lamps ignited, and before the
flames could be extinguished the cars were entirely destroyed.This accident resulted in the death of twenty-nine persons, and
in more or less severe injuries to fifty-seven others.No person,
not in the last car of the accommodation train was killed, and
one only was seriously injured.Of those in the last car more
than half lost their lives; many instantly by crushing, others by
inhaling the scalding steam which poured forth from the locomotive
boiler into the wreck, and which, where it did not kill, inflicted
frightful injuries.Indeed, for the severity of injuries and for the
protractedness of agony involved in it, this accident has rarely, if
ever, been exceeded.Crushing, scalding and burning did their work
together.It may with perfect truth be said that the disaster at Revere marked
an epoch in the history of railroad development in New England.At
the moment it called forth the deepest expression of horror and
indignation, which, as usual in such cases, was more noticeable for
its force than for its wisdom.An utter absence of all spirit of
justice is, indeed, a usual characteristic of the more immediate
utterances, both from the press and on the platform, upon occasions
of this character.Writers and orators seem always to forget that,
next to the immediate sufferers and their families, the unfortunate
officials concerned are the greatest losers by railroad accidents.For them, not only reputation but bread is involved.A railroad
employé implicated in the occurrence of an accident lives under a
stigma.And yet, from the tenor of public comment it might fairly be
supposed that these officials are in the custom of plotting to bring
disasters about, and take a fiendish delight in them.Nowhere was
this ever illustrated more perfectly than in Massachusetts during
the last days of August and the early days of September, 1871.Grave
men--men who ought to have known better--indulged in language which
would have been simply ludicrous save for the horror of the event
which occasioned but could not justify it.A public meeting, for
instance, was held at the town of Swampscott on the evening of the
Monday succeeding the catastrophe.The gentleman who presided over
it very discreetly, in his preliminary remarks, urged those who
proposed to join in the discussion to control their feelings.Hardly
had he ceased speaking, however, when Mr.Wendell Phillips was
noticed among the audience, and immediately called to the platform.His remarks were a most singular commentary on the chairman's
injunction to calmness.He began by announcing that the first
requisite to the formation of a healthy public opinion in regard
to railroad accidents, as other things, was absolute frankness of
speech, and he then proceeded as follows:--"So I begin by saying
that to my mind this terrible disaster, which has made the last
thirty-six hours so sad to us all, is a deliberate murder.I think
we should try to get rid in the public mind of any real distinction
between the individual who, in a moment of passion or in a moment of
heedlessness, takes the life of one fellow-man, and the corporation
that in a moment of greed, of little trouble, of little expense, of
little care, of little diligence, takes lives by wholesale.I think
the first requisite of the public mind is to say that there is no
accident in the case, properly speaking.It is a murder; the guilt
of murder rests somewhere."Phillip's definition of the crime of "deliberate murder"
would apparently somewhat unsettle the criminal law as at present
understood, but he was not at all alone in this bathos of
extravagance.Prominent gentlemen seemed to vie with each other
in their display of ignorance.B. F. Butler, for instance,
suggested his view of the disaster and the measure best calculated
to prevent a repetition of it; which last was certainly original,
inasmuch as he urged the immediate raising of the pay of all
engine-men until a sufficiently high order of ability and education
should be brought into the occupation to render impossible the
recurrence of an accident which was primarily caused by the
negligence, not of an engineer, but of a conductor.Another
gentleman described with much feeling his observations during a
recent tour in Europe, and declared that such a catastrophe as that
at Revere would have been impossible there.As a matter of fact
the official reports not only showed that the accident was one of
a class of most frequent occurrence, but also that sixty-one cases
of it had occurred in Great Britain alone during the very year the
gentleman in question was journeying in Europe, and had occasioned
over six hundred cases of death or personal injury.Perhaps, in
order to illustrate how very reckless in statement a responsible
gentleman talking under excitement may become, it is worth while to
quote in his own language Captain Tyler's brief description of one
of those sixty-one accidents which "could not possibly," but yet
did, occur."As four London & North-Western excursion trains on September
     2, 1870, were returning from a volunteer review at Penrith,
     the fourth came into collision at Penruddock with the third of
     those trains.An hundred and ten passengers and three servants
     of the company were injured.These trains were partly in charge
     of acting guards, some of whom were entirely inexperienced, as
     well in the line as in their duties; and of engine-drivers and
     firemen, of whom one, at all events, was very much the worse for
     liquor.The side-lamps on the hind van of the third train were
     obscured by a horse-box, which was wider than the van.There
     were no special means of protection to meet the exceptional
     contingency of three such trains all stopping on their way from
     the eastward, to cross two others from the westward, at this
     station.And the regulations for telegraphing the trains were
     altogether neglected."The annals of railroad accidents are full of cases of "rear-end
collision," as it is termed.[11] Their frequency may almost be
accepted as a very accurate gauge of the pressure of traffic on
any given system of lines, and because of them the companies are
continually compelled to adopt new and more intricate systems of
operation.At first, on almost all roads, trains follow each other
at such great intervals that no precaution at all, other than flags
and lanterns, are found necessary.Then comes a succeeding period
when an interval of time between following trains is provided for,
through a system of signals which at given points indicate danger
during a certain number of minutes after the passage of every
train.Then, presently, the alarming frequency of rear collisions
demonstrates the inadequacy of this system, and a new one has to be
devised, which, through the aid of electricity, secures between the
trains an interval of space as well as of time.This last is known
as the "block-system," of which so much has of late years been heard.[11] In the nine years 1870-8, besides those which occurred and
  were not deemed of sufficient importance to demand special inquiry,
  86 cases of accidents of this description were investigated by the
  inspecting officers of the English Board of Trade and reported upon
  in detail.In America, 732 cases were reported as occurring during
  the six years 1874-8, and 138 cases in 1878 alone.The block-system is so important a feature in the modern operation
of railroads, and in its present stage of development it illustrates
so strikingly the difference between the European and the American
methods, that more particular reference will have presently to be
made to it.[12] For the present it is enough to say that rear-end
collisions occur notwithstanding all the precautions implied in a
thoroughly perfected "block-system."There was such a case on the
Metropolitan road, in the very heart of London, on the 29th of
August, 1873.A train was stalled there,
and an unfortunate signal officer in a moment of flurry gave "line
clear" and sent another train directly into it.A much more impressive disaster, both in its dramatic features
and as illustrating the inadequacy of every precaution depending
on human agency to avert accident under certain conditions, was
afforded in the case of a collision which occurred on the London
& Brighton Railway on August 25, 1861; ten years almost to a day
before that at Revere.Like the Eastern railroad, the London
& Brighton enjoyed an enormous passenger traffic, which became
peculiarly heavy during the vacation season towards the close of
August; and it was to the presence of the excursion trains made
necessary to accomodate this traffic that the catastrophes were
in both cases due.In the case of the London & Brighton road it
occurred on a Sunday.An excursion train from Portsmouth on that
day was to leave Brighton at five minutes after eight A. M., and
was to be followed by a regular Sunday excursion train at 8.15 or
ten minutes later, and that again, after the lapse of a quarter of
an hour, by a regular parliamentary train at 8.30.These trains
were certainly timed to run sufficiently near to each other; but,
owing to existing pressure of traffic on the line, they started
almost simultaneously.The Portsmouth excursion, which consisted of
sixteen carriages, was much behind its time, and did not leave the
Brighton station until 8.28; when, after a lapse of three minutes,
it was followed by the regular excursion train at 8.31, and that
again by the parliamentary train at 8.35.Three passenger trains had
thus left the station on one track in seven minutes!The London and
Brighton Railway traverses the chalky downs, for which that portion
of England is noted, through numerous tunnels, the first of which
after leaving Brighton is known as the Patcham Tunnel, about five
hundred yards in length, while two and a half miles farther on is
the Croydon Tunnel, rather more than a mile and a quarter in length.The line between these tunnels was so crooked and obscured that the
managers had adopted extraordinary precautions against accident.At
each end of the Croydon Tunnel a signal-man was stationed, with a
telegraphic apparatus, a clock and a telegraph bell in his station.The rule was absolute that when any train entered the tunnel the
signal-man at the point of entry was to telegraph "train in," and
no other train could follow until the return signal of "train out"
came from the other side.In face of such a regulation it was
difficult to see how any collision in the tunnel was possible.When
the Portsmouth excursion train arrived, it at once entered the
tunnel and the fact was properly signaled to the opposite outlet.Before the return signal that this train was out was received, the
regular excursion train came in sight.It should have been stopped
by a self-acting signal which was placed about a quarter of a mile
from the mouth of the tunnel, and which each passing locomotive set
at "danger," where it remained until shifted to "safety," by the
signal-man, on receipt of the message, "train out."Through some
unexplained cause, the Portsmouth excursion train had failed to act
on this signal, which consequently still indicated safety when the
Brighton excursion train came up.Accordingly the engine-driver
at once passed it, and went on to the tunnel.As he did so, the
signal-man, perceiving some mistake and knowing that he had not yet
got his return signal that the preceding train was out, tried to
stop him by waving his red flag.It was too late, however, and the
train passed in.A moment later the parliamentary train also came
in sight, and stopped at the signal of danger.Now ensued a most
singular misapprehension between the signal-men, resulting in a
terrible disaster.The second train had run into the tunnel and was
supposed by the signal-man to be on its way to the other end of it,
when he received the return message that the first train was out.To this he instantly responded by again telegraphing "train in,"
referring now to the second train.This dispatch the signal-man
at the opposite end conceived to be a repetition of the message
referring to the first train, and he accordingly again replied that
the train was out.This reply, however, the other operator mistook
as referring to the second train, and accordingly he signaled
"safety," and the third train at once got under way and passed into
the tunnel.Unfortunately the engineer of the second train had
seen the red flag waved by the signal-man, and, in obedience to
it, stopped his locomotive as soon as possible in the tunnel and
began to back out of it.In doing so, he drove his train into the
locomotive of the third train advancing into it.The tunnel was
twenty-four feet in height.The engine of the parliamentary train
struck the rear carriage of the excursion train and mounted upon
its fragments, and then on those of the carriage in front of it,
until its smoke-stack came in contact with the roof of the tunnel.The collision had
taken place so far within the tunnel as to be beyond the reach of
daylight, and the wreck of the trains had quite blocked up the arch,
while the steam and smoke from the engines poured forth with loud
sound and in heavy volumes, filling the empty space with stifling
and scalding vapors.When at last assistance came and the trains
could be separated, twenty-three corpses were taken from the ruins,
while one hundred and seventy-six other persons had sustained more
or less severe injuries.A not less extraordinary accident of the same description,
unaccompanied, however, by an equal loss of life, occured on the
Great Northern Railway upon the 10th of June, 1866.In this case
the tube of a locomotive of a freight train burst at about the
centre of the Welwyn Tunnel, some five miles north of Hatfield,
bringing the train to a stand-still.The guard in charge of the
rear of the train failed from some cause to go back and give the
signal for an obstruction, and speedily another freight train from
the Midland road entered and dashed into the rear of the train
already there.Apparently those in charge of these two trains were
in such consternation that they did not think to provide against a
further disaster; at any rate, before measures to that end had been
taken, an additional freight train, this time belonging to the Great
Northern road, came up and plowed into the ruins which already
blocked the tunnel.One of the trains had contained wagons laden
with casks of oil, which speedily became ignited from contact with
the coals scattered from the fire-boxes, and there then ensued one
of the most extraordinary spectacles ever witnessed on a railroad.The tunnel was filled to the summit of its arch and completely
blocked with the wrecked locomotives and wagons.These had ignited,
and the whole cavity, more than a half a mile in length, was
converted into one huge furnace, belching forth smoke and flame with
a loud roaring sound through its several air shafts.So fierce was
the fire that no attempt was made to subdue it, and eighteen hours
elapsed before any steps could be taken towards clearing the track.Strange to say, in this disaster the lives of but two persons were
lost.Rear-end collisions have been less frequent in this country than
in England, for the simple reason that the volume of traffic has
pressed less heavily on the capacity of the lines.Yet here, also,
they have been by no means unknown.In 1865 two occurred, both of
which were accompanied with a considerable loss of life; though,
coming as they did during the exciting scenes which marked the
close of the war of the Rebellion, they attracted much less public
notice than they otherwise would.The first of these took place in
New Jersey on the 7th of March, 1865, just three days after the
second inauguration of President Lincoln.As the express train
from Washington to New York over the Camden & Amboy road was
passing through Bristol, about thirty miles from Philadelphia, at
half-past-two o'clock in the morning, it dashed into the rear of
the twelve o'clock "owl train," from Kensington to New York, which
had been delayed by meeting an oil train on the track before it.The case appears to have been one of very culpable negligence, for,
though the owl train was some two hours late, those in charge of it
seem to have been so deeply engrossed in what was going on before
them that they wholly neglected to guard their rear.The express
train accordingly, approaching around a curve, plunged at a high
rate of speed into the last car, shattering it to pieces; the engine
is even said to have passed completely through that car and to have
imbedded itself in the one before it.It so happened that most of
the sufferers by this accident, numbering about fifty, were soldiers
on their way home from the army upon furlough.The second of the two disasters referred to, occurred on the 16th of
August, 1865, upon the Housatonic road of Connecticut.A new engine
was out upon an experimental trip, and in rounding a curve it ran
into the rear of a passenger train, which, having encountered a
disabled freight train, had coupled on to it and was then backing
down with it to a siding in order to get by.In this case the
impetus was so great that the colliding locomotive utterly destroyed
the rear car of the passenger train and penetrated some distance
into the car preceding it, where its boiler burst.Fortunately
the train was by no means full of passengers; but, even as it was,
eleven persons were killed and some seventeen badly injured.The great peculiarity of the Revere accident, and that which gave
a permanent interest to it, lay in the revelation it afforded of
the degree in which a system had outgrown its appliances.The railroads of New England had
long been living on their early reputation, and now, when a sudden
test was applied, it was found that they were years behind the time.In August, 1871, the Eastern railroad was run as if it were a line
of stage-coaches in the days before the telegraph.Not in one point
alone, but in everything, it broke down under the test.The disaster
was due not to any single cause but to a combination of causes
implicating not only the machinery and appliances in use by the
company, but its discipline and efficiency from the highest official
down to the meanest subordinate.In the first place the capacity of
the road was taxed to the utmost; it was vital, almost, that every
wheel should be kept in motion.Yet, under that very exigency, the
wheels stopped almost as a matter of necessity.How could it be
otherwise?--Here was a crowded line, more than half of which was
equipped with but a single track, in operating which no reliance was
placed upon the telegraph.With trains running out of their schedule
time and out of their schedule place, engineers and conductors were
left to grope their way along as best they could in the light of
rules, the essence of which was that when in doubt they were to
stand stock still.Then, in the absence of the telegraph, a block
occurred almost at the mouth of the terminal station; and there the
trains stood for hours in stupid obedience to a stupid rule, because
the one man who, with a simple regard to the dictates of common
sense, was habitually accustomed to violate it happened to be sick.Trains commonly left a station out of time and out of place; and
the engineer of an express train was sent out to run a gauntlet the
whole length of the road with a simple verbal injunction to look
out for some one before him.Then, at last, when this express train
through all this chaos got to chasing an accommodation train, much
as a hound might course a hare, there was not a pretence of a signal
to indicate the time which had elapsed between the passage of the
two, and employés, lanterns in hand, gaped on in bewilderment at the
awful race, concluding that they could not at any rate do anything
to help matters, but on the whole they were inclined to think that
those most immediately concerned must know what they were about.Finally, even when the disaster was imminent, when deficiency in
organization and discipline had done its worst, its consequences
might yet have been averted through the use of better appliances;
had the one train been equipped with the Westinghouse brake,
already largely in use in other sections of the country, it might
and would have been stopped; or had the other train been provided
with reflecting tail-lights in place of the dim hand-lanterns which
glimmered on its rear platform, it could hardly have failed to make
its proximity known.Any one of a dozen things, every one of which
should have been but was not, ought to have averted the disaster.Obviously its immediate cause was not far to seek.It lay in the
carelessness of a conductor who failed to consult his watch, and
never knew until the crash came that his train was leisurely moving
along on the time of another.Nevertheless, what can be said in
extenuation of a system under which, at this late day, a railroad is
operated on the principle that each employé under all circumstances
can and will take care of himself and of those whose lives and limbs
are entrusted to his care?There is, however, another and far more attractive side to the
picture.The lives sacrificed at Revere were not lost in vain.Seven
complete railroad years passed by between that and the Wollaston
Heights accident of 1878.During that time not less than two hundred
and thirty millions of persons were carried by rail within the
limits of Massachusetts.Of this vast number while only 50, or
about one in each four and a half millions, sustained any injury
from causes beyond their own power to control, the killed were just
two.This certainly was a record with which no community could well
find fault; and it was due more than anything else to the great
disaster of August 26, 1871.More than once, and on more than one
road, accidents occurred which, but for the improved appliances
introduced in consequence of the experience at Revere, could hardly
have failed of fatal results.Not that these appliances were in
all cases very cheerfully or very eagerly accepted.Neither the
Miller platform nor the Westinghouse brake won its way into general
use unchallenged.Indeed, the earnestness and even the indignation
with which presidents and superintendents then protested that their
car construction was better and stronger than Miller's; that their
antiquated handbrakes were the most improved brakes,--better, much
better, than the Westinghouse; that their crude old semaphores and
targets afforded a protection to trains which no block-system would
ever equal,--all this certainly was comical enough, even in the
very shadow of the great tragedy.Men of a certain type always have
protested and will always continue to protest that they have nothing
to learn; yet, under the heavy burden of responsibility, learn
they still do.On this point the figures
of the Massachusetts annual returns between the year 1871 and the
year 1878 speak volumes.At the time of the Revere disaster, with
one single honorable exception,--that of the Boston & Providence
road,--both the atmospheric train-brake and the Miller platform, the
two greatest modern improvements in American car construction, were
practically unrecognized on the railroads of Massachusetts.Even a
year later, but 93 locomotives and 415 cars had been equipped even
with the train-brake.In September, 1873, the number had, however,
risen to 194 locomotives and 709 cars; and another twelve months
carried these numbers up to 313 locomotives and 997 cars.Finally
in 1877 the state commissioners in their report for that year spoke
of the train-brake as having been then generally adopted, and at
the same time called attention to the very noticeable fact "that
the only railroad accident resulting in the death of a passenger
from causes beyond his control within the state during a period of
two years and eight months, was caused by the failure of a company
to adopt this improvement on all its passenger rolling-stock."The adoption of Miller's method of car construction had meanwhile
been hardly less rapid.Almost unknown at the time of the Revere
catastrophe in September, 1871, in October, 1873, when returns on
the subject were first called for by the state commissioners,
eleven companies had already adopted it on 778 cars out of a total
number of 1548 reported.In 1878 it had been adopted by twenty-two
companies, and applied to 1685 cars out of a total of 1792.In other
words it had been brought into general use.THE AUTOMATIC ELECTRIC BLOCK SYSTEM.A realizing sense of the necessity of ultimately adopting some
system of protection against the danger of rear-end collisions was,
above all else, brought directly home to American railroad managers
through the Revere disaster.In discussing and comparing the
appliances used in the practical operation of railroads in different
countries, there is one element, however, which can never be left
out of the account.The intelligence, quickness of perception
and capacity for taking care of themselves--that combination of
qualities which, taken together, constitute individuality and
adaptability to circumstance--vary greatly among the railroad
employés of different countries.The American locomotive engineer,
as he is called, is especially gifted in this way.He can be relied
on to take care of himself and his train under circumstances which
in other countries would be thought to insure disaster.Volumes
on this point were included in the fact that though at the time
of the Revere disaster many of the American lines, especially in
Massachusetts, were crowded with the trains of a mixed traffic,
the necessity of making any provision against rear-end collisions,
further than by directing those in immediate charge of the trains
to keep a sharp look out and to obey their printed orders, seemed
hardly to have occurred to any one.The English block system was
now and then referred to in a vague, general way; but it was very
questionable whether one in ten of those referring to it knew
anything about it or had ever seen it in operation, much less
investigated it.A characteristic illustration of this was afforded
in the course of those official investigations which followed the
Revere disaster, and have already more than once been alluded to.Prior to that disaster the railroads of Massachusetts had, as a
rule, enjoyed a rather exceptional freedom from accidents, and
there was every reason to suppose that their regulations were as
exact and their system as good as those in use in other parts of
the country.Yet it then appeared that in the rules of very few of
the Massachusetts roads had any provision, even of the simplest
character, been made as to the effect of telegraphic orders, or
the course to be pursued by employés in charge of trains on their
receipt.The appliances for securing intervals between following
trains were marked by a quaint simplicity.They were, indeed,
"singularly primitive," as the railroad commissioners on a
subsequent occasion described them, when it appeared that on one of
the principal roads of the state the interval between two closely
following trains was signalled to the engineer of the second train
by a station-master's holding up to him as he passed a number of
fingers corresponding to the number of minutes since the first
train had gone by.For the rest the examination revealed, as the
nearest approach to a block system, a queer collection of dials,
sand-glasses, green flags,  lanterns and hand-targets.The
climax in the course of that investigation was, however, reached
when some reference, involving a description of it, was made to the
English block.This was met by a protest on the part of one veteran
superintendent, who announced that it might work well under certain
circumstances, but for himself he could not be responsible for the
operation of a road running the number of trains he had charge of in
reliance on any such system.The subject, in fact, was one of which
he knew absolutely nothing;--not even that, through the block system
and through it alone, fourteen trains were habitually and safely
moved under circumstances where he moved one.This occurred in 1871,
and though eight years have since elapsed information in regard
to the block system is not yet very widely disseminated inside of
railroad circles, much less outside of them.It is none the less
a necessity of the future.It has got to be understood, and, in
some form, it has got to be adopted; for even in America there are
limits to the reliance which, when the lives and limbs of many are
at stake, can be placed on the "sharp look out" of any class of men,
no matter how intelligent they may be.The block system is of English origin, and it scarcely needs
to be said that it was adopted by the railroad corporations of
that country only when they were driven to it by the exigencies
of their traffic.But for that system, indeed, the most costly
portion of the tracks of the English roads must of necessity have
been duplicated years ago, as their traffic had fairly outgrown
those appliances of safety which have even to this time been found
sufficient in America.There were points, for instance, where two
hundred and seventy regular trains of one line alone passed daily.On the London & North-Western there are more than sixty through
down trains, taking no account of local trains, each day passing
over the same line of tracks, among which are express trains which
stop nowhere, way trains which stop everywhere, express-freight,
way-freight, mineral trains and parcel trains.On the Midland road
there are nearly twice as many similar trains on each track.On the
Metropolitan railway the average interval is three and one-third
minutes between trains.In one case points were mentioned where
270 regular trains of one line alone passed a given junction
during each twenty-four hours,--where 470 trains passed a single
station, the regular interval between them being but five-eighths
of a mile,--where 132 trains entered and left a single station
during three hours of each evening every day, being one train in
eighty-two seconds.In 1870 there daily reached or left the six
stations of the Boston roads some 385 trains; while no less than
650 trains a day were in the same year received and despatched from
a single one of the London stations.On one single exceptional
occasion 1,111 trains, carrying 145,000 persons, were reported as
entering and leaving this station in the space of eighteen hours,
being rather more than a train a minute.Indeed it may well be
questioned whether the world anywhere else furnishes an illustration
so apt and dramatic of the great mechanical achievements of recent
times as that to be seen during the busy hours of any week-day from
the signal and interlocking galleries which span the tracks as
they enter the Charing Cross or Cannon street stations in London.Below and in front of the galleries the trains glide to and fro,
coming suddenly into sight from beyond the bridges and as suddenly
disappearing,--winding swiftly in and out, and at times four of them
running side by side on as many tracks but in both directions,--the
whole making up a swiftly shifting maze of complex movement under
the influence of which a head unaccustomed to the sight grows
actually giddy.Yet it is all done so quietly and smoothly, with
such an absence of haste and nervousness on the part of the stolid
operators in charge, that it is not easy to decide which most to
wonder at, the almost inconceivable magnitude and despatch of the
train-movement or the perfection of the appliances which make it
possible.No man concerned in the larger management of railroads,
who has not passed a morning in those London galleries, knows what
it is to handle a great city's traffic.Perfect as it is in its way, however, it may well be questioned
whether the block system as developed in England is likely to
be generally adopted on American railroads.Upon one or two of
them, and notably on the New Jersey Central and a division of the
Pennsylvania, it has already been in use for a number of years.From an American point of view, however, it is open to a number
of objections.That in itself it is very perfect and has been
successfully elaborated so as to provide for almost every possible
contingency is proved by the results daily accomplished by means of
it.[13] The English lines are made to do an incredible amount of
work with comparative few accidents.The block system is, however,
none the less a very clumsy and complicated one, necessitating the
constant employment of a large number of skilled operators.Here
is the great defect in it from the American point of view.In this
country labor is scarce and capital costly.The effort is always
towards the perfecting of labor-saving machines.Hitherto the
pressure of traffic on the lines has not been greater than could
be fairly controlled by simpler appliances, and the expense of the
English system is so heavy that its adoption, except partially,
would not have been warranted.As Barry says in his treatise on the
subject, "one can 'buy gold too dear'; for if every possible known
precaution is to be taken, regardless of cost, it may not pay to
work a railway at all."[13] An excellent popular description of this system will be found
  in Barry's _Railway Appliances, Chapter V_.It is tolerably safe, therefore, to predict that the American
block system of the future will be essentially different from the
present English system.The basis--electricity--will of course be
the same; but, while the operator is everywhere in the English
block, his place will be supplied to the utmost possible degree by
automatic action in the American.It is in this direction that the
whole movement since the Revere disaster has been going on, and
the advance has been very great.From peculiarities of condition
also the American block must be made to cover a multitude of weak
points in the operation of roads, and give timely notice of dangers
against which the English block provides only to a limited degree,
and always through the presence of yet other employés.For instance,
as will presently be seen, many more accidents and, in Europe even,
far greater loss of life is caused by locomotives coming in contact
with vehicles at points where highways cross railroad tracks at a
level therewith than by rear-end collisions; meanwhile throughout
America, even in the most crowded suburban neighborhoods, these
crossings are the rule, whereas in Europe they are the exception.The English block affords protection against this danger by giving
electric notice to gatemen; but gatemen are always supposed.So
also as respects the movements of passengers in and about stations
in crossing tracks as they come to or leave the trains, or prepare
to take their places in them.The rule in Europe is that passenger
crossings at local stations are provided over or under the tracks;
in America, however, almost nowhere is any provision at all made,
but passengers, men, women and children, are left to scramble across
tracks as best they can in the face of passing trains.They are
expected to take care of themselves, and the success with which they
do it is most astonishing.Having been brought up to this self-care
all their lives, they do not, as would naturally be supposed, become
confused and stumble under the wheels of locomotives; and the
statistics seem to show that no more accidents from this cause occur
in America than in Europe.Nevertheless some provision is manifestly
desirable to notify employés as well as passengers that trains are
approaching, especially where way-stations are situated on curves.Again, it is well known that, next to collisions, the greatest
source of danger to railroad trains is due to broken tracks.It
is, of course, apparent that tracks may at any time be broken by
accident, as by earth-slides, derailment or the fracture of rails.This danger has to be otherwise provided for; the block has nothing
to do with it further than to prevent a train delayed by any such
break from being run into by any following train.The broken track
which the perfect block should give notice of is that where the
break is a necessary incident to the regular operation of the road.It is these breaks which, both in America and elsewhere, are the
fruitful source of the great majority of railroad accidents, and
draw-bridges and switches, or facing points as they are termed in
the English reports, are most prominent among them.Wherever there
is a switch, the chances are that in the course of time there will
be an accident.Four matters connected with train movement have now been specified,
in regard to which some provision is either necessary or highly
desirable: these are rear collisions, tracks broken at draw-bridges
or at switches, highway grade crossings, and the notification of
agents and passengers at stations.The effort in America, somewhat
in advance of that crowded condition of the lines which makes the
adoption of something a measure of present necessity, has been
directed towards the invention of an automatic system which at
one and the same time should cover all the dangers and provide
for all the needs which have been referred to, eliminating the
risks incident to human forgetfulness, drowsiness and weakness of
nerves.Can reliable automatic provision thus be made?--The English
authorities are of opinion that it cannot.They insist that "if
automatic arrangements be adopted, however suitable they may be to
the duties which they have to perform, they should in all cases be
used as additions to, and not as substitutions for, safety machinery
worked by competent signal-men.The signal-man should be bound to
exercise his observation, care and judgment, and to act thereon; and
the machine, as far as possible, be such that if he attempts to go
wrong it shall check him."It certainly cannot be said that the American electrician has as
yet demonstrated the incorrectness of this conclusion, but he has
undoubtedly made a good deal of progress in that direction.Of the
various automatic blocks which have now been experimented with or
brought into practice, the Hall Electric and the Union Safety Signal
Company systems have been developed to a very marked degree of
perfection.They depend for their working on diametrically opposite
principles: the Hall signals being worked by means of an electric
circuit caused by the action of wheels moving on the rails, and
conveyed through the usual medium of wires; while, under the other
system, the wires being wholly dispensed with, a continuous electric
circuit is kept up by means of the rails, which are connected
for the purpose, and the signals are then acted upon through the
breaking of this normal circuit by the movement of locomotives and
cars.So far as the signals are concerned, there is no essential
difference between the two systems, except that Hall supplies the
necessary motive force by the direct action of electricity, while in
the other case dependence is placed upon suspended weights.Of the
two the Hall system is the oldest and most thoroughly elaborated,
having been compelled to pass through that long and useful tentative
process common to all inventions, during which they are regarded
as of doubtful utility and are gradually developed through a
succession of partial failures.So far as Hall's system is concerned
this period may now fairly be regarded as over, for it is in
established use on a number of the more crowded roads of the North,
and especially of New England, while the imperfections necessarily
incident to the development of an appliance at once so delicate and
so complicated, have for certain purposes been clearly overcome.Its signal arrangements, for instance, to protect draw-bridges,
stations and grade-crossings are wholly distinct from its block
system, through which it provides against dangers from collision and
broken tracks.So far as draw-bridges are concerned, the protection
it affords is perfect.Not only is its interlocking apparatus so
designed that the opening of the draw blocks all approach to it,
but the signals are also reciprocal; and if through carelessness or
automatic derangement any train passes the block, the draw-tender is
notified at once of the fact in ample time to stop it.In the case of a highway crossing at a level, the electric bell
under Hall's system is placed at the crossing, giving notice of
the approaching train from the moment it is within half a mile
until it passes; so that, where this appliance is in use, accidents
can happen only through the gross carelessness of those using the
highway.When the electric bell is silent there is no train within
half a mile and the crossing is safe; it is not safe while the bell
is ringing.As it now stands the law usually provides that the
prescribed signals, either bell or whistle, shall be given from the
locomotive as it approaches the highway, and at a fixed distance
from it.The signal, therefore, is given at a distance of several
hundred yards, more or less, from the point of danger.The electric
system improves on this by placing the signal directly at the point
of danger,--the traveller approaches the bell, instead of the bell
approaching the traveller.At any point of crossing which is really
dangerous,--that is at any crossing where trees or cuttings or
buildings mask the railroad from the highway,--this distinction is
vital.In the one case notice of the unseen danger must be given
and cannot be unobserved; in the other case whether it is really
given or not may depend on the condition of the atmosphere or the
direction of the wind.Usually, however, in New England the level crossings of the more
crowded thoroughfares, perhaps one in ten of the whole number, are
protected by gates or flag-men.Under similar circumstances in
Great Britain there is an electric connection between a bell in the
cabin of the gate-keeper and the nearest signal boxes of the block
system on each side of the crossing, so that due notice is given of
the approach of trains from either direction.In this country it has
heretofore been the custom to warn gate-keepers by the locomotive
whistle, to the intense annoyance of all persons dwelling near the
crossing, or to make them depend for notice on their own eyes.Under
the Hall system, however, the gate-keeper is automatically signalled
to be on the look out, if he is attending to his duty; or, if he is
neglecting it, the electric bell in some degree supplies his place,
without releasing the corporation from its liability.In America
the heavy fogs of England are almost unknown, and the brilliant
head lights, heavy bells and shrill high whistles in use on the
locomotives would at night, it might be supposed, give ample notice
to the most careless of an approaching train.Continually recurring
experience shows, however, that this is not the case.Under these
circumstances the electric bell at the crossing becomes not only a
matter of justice almost to the employé who is stationed there, but
a watchman over him.This, however, like the other forms of signals which have been
referred to, is, in the electric system, a mere adjunct of its chief
use, which is the block,--they are all as it were things thrown
into the bargain.As contradistinguished from the English block,
which insures only an unoccupied track, the automatic blocks seek to
insure an unbroken track as well,--that is not only is each segment
into which a road is divided, protected as respects following trains
by, in the case of Hall's system, double signals watching over each
other, the one at safety, the other at danger,--both having to
combine to open the block,--but every switch or facing point, the
throwing of which may break the main track, is also protected.The
Union Signal Company's system it is claimed goes still further than
this and indicates any break in the track, though due to accidental
fracture or displacement of rails.Without attempting this the Hall
system has one other important feature in common with the English
block, and a very important feature, that of enabling station agents
in case of sudden emergency to control the train movement within
half a mile or more of their stations on either side.Within the
given distance they can stop trains either leaving or approaching.The inability to do this has been the cause of some of the most
disastrous collisions on record, and notably those at Revere and at
Thorpe.The one essential thing, however, in every perfect block system,
whether automatic or worked by operators, is that in case of
accident or derangement or doubt, the signal should rest at danger.This the Hall system now fully provides for, and in case even of
the wilful displacement of a switch, an occurrence by no means
without precedent in railroad experience, the danger signal could
not but be displayed, even though the electric connection had been
tampered with.Accidents due to wilfullness, however, can hardly
be provided for except by police precautions.Train wrecking is
not to be taken into account as a danger incident to the ordinary
operation of a railroad.Carelessness or momentary inadvertence,
or, most dangerous of all, that recklessness--that unnecessary
assumption of risk somewhere or at some time, which is almost
inseparable from a long immunity from disaster--these are the
great sources of peril most carefully to be guarded against.The
complicated and unceasing train movement depends upon many thousand
employés, all of whom make mistakes or assume risks sometimes;--and
did they not do so they would be either more or less than men.Being, however, neither angels nor machines, but ordinary mortals
whose services are bought for money at the average market rate of
wages, it would certainly seem no small point gained if an automatic
machine could be placed on guard over those whom it is the great
effort of railroad discipline to reduce to automatons.Could this
result be attained, the unintentional throwing of a lever or the
carelessness which leaves it thrown, would simply block the track
instead of leaving it broken.An example of this, and at the same
time a most forcible illustration of the possible cost of a small
economy in the application of a safeguard, was furnished in the
case of the Wollaston disaster.At the time of that disaster, the
Old Colony railroad had for several years been partially equipped
on the portion of its track near Boston, upon which the accident
occurred, with Hall's system.It had worked smoothly and easily, was
well understood by the employés, and the company was sufficiently
satisfied with it to have even then made arrangements for its
extension.Unfortunately, with a too careful eye to the expenditure
involved, the line had been but partially equipped; points where
little danger was apprehended had not been protected.Among these
was the "Foundry switch," so called, near Wollaston.Had this switch
been connected with the system and covered by a signal-target, the
mere act of throwing it would have automatically blocked the track,
and only when it was re-set would the track have been opened.The
switch was not connected, the train hands were recklessly careless,
and so a trifling economy cost in one unguarded moment some fifty
persons life and limb, and the corporation more than $300,000.One objection to the automatic block is generally based upon the
delicacy and complicated character of the machinery on which its
action necessarily depends; and this objection is especially urged
against those other portions of the Hall system, covering draws
and level crossings, which have been particularly described.It
is argued that it is always liable to get out of order from a
great multiplicity of causes, some of which are very difficult to
guard against, and that it is sure to get out of order during any
electric disturbance; but it is during storms that accidents are
most likely to occur, and especially is this the case at highway
grade-crossings.It is comparatively easy to avoid accidents so long
as the skies are clear and the elements quiet; but it is exactly
when this is not the case and when it becomes necessary to use every
precaution, that electricity as a safeguard fails or runs mad, and,
by participating in the general confusion, proves itself worse
than nothing.Then it will be found that those in charge of trains
and tracks, who have been educated into a reliance upon it under
ordinary circumstances, will from force of habit, if nothing else,
go on relying upon it, and disaster will surely follow.This line of reasoning is plausible, but none the less open to
one serious objection; it is sustained neither by statistics nor
by practical experience.Moreover it is not new, for, slightly
varied in phraseology, it has been persistently urged against the
introduction of every new railroad appliance, and, indeed, was first
and most persistently of all urged against the introduction of
railroads themselves.Pretty and ingenious in theory, practically it
is not feasible!--for more than half a century this formula has been
heard.That the automatic electric signal system is complicated,
and in many of its parts of most delicate construction, is
undeniable.In point of fact the whole
railroad organization from beginning to end--from machine-shop to
train-movement--is at once so vast and complicated, so delicate
in that action which goes on with such velocity and power, that
it is small cause for wonder that in the beginning all plain,
sensible, practical men scouted it as the fanciful creation of
visionaries.They were wholly justified in so doing; and to-day
any sane man would of course pronounce the combined safety and
rapidity of ordinary railroad movement an utter impossibility, did
he not see it going on before his eyes.So it is with each new
appliance.It is ever suggested that at last the final result has
already been reached.It is but a few years, as will presently be
seen, since the Westinghouse brake encountered the old "pretty and
ingenious" formula.Going yet a step further, and taking the case
of electricity itself, the bold conception of operating an entire
line of single track road wholly as respects one half of its train
movement by telegraph, and without the use of any time table at
all, would once have been condemned as mad.Yet to-day half of the
vast freight movement of this continent is carried on in absolute
reliance on the telegraph.Nevertheless it is still not uncommon
to hear among the class of men who rise to the height of their
capacity in themselves being automaton superintendents that they do
not believe in deviating from their time tables and printed rules;
that, acting under them, the men know or ought to know exactly what
to do, and any interference by a train despatcher only relieves them
of responsibility, and is more likely to lead to accidents than if
they were left alone to grope their own way out.Another and very similar argument frequently urged against the
electric, in common with all other block systems by the large class
who prefer to exercise their ingenuity in finding objections rather
than in overcoming difficulties, is that they breed dependence and
carelessness in employés;--that engine-drivers accustomed to rely
on the signals, rely on them implicitly, and get into habits of
recklessness which lead inevitably to accidents, for which they
then contend the signals, and not they themselves, are responsible.This argument is, indeed, hardly less familiar than the "pretty and
ingenious" formula just referred to.It has, however, been met and
disposed of by Captain Tyler in his annual reports to the Board of
Trade in a way which can hardly be improved upon:--

     It is a favorite argument with those who oppose the introduction
     of some of these improvements, or who make excuses for the want
     of them, that their servants are apt to become more careless
     from the use of them, in consequence of the extra security which
     they are believed to afford; and it is desirable to consider
     seriously how much of truth there is in this assertion.* * *
     Allowing to the utmost for these tendencies to confide too
     much in additional means of safety, the risk is proved by
     experience to be very much greater without them than with them;
     and, in fact, the negligence and mistakes of servants are found
     to occur most frequently, and generally with the most serious
     results, not when the men are over-confident in their appliances
     or apparatus, but when, in the absence of them, they are
     habituated to risk in the conduct of the traffic.In the daily
     practice of railway working station-masters, porters, signalmen,
     engine-drivers or guards are frequently placed in difficulties
     which they have to surmount as best they can.The more they are
     accustomed to incur risk in order to perform their duties, the
     less they think of it, and the more difficult it is to enforce
     discipline and obedience to regulations.The personal risk which
     is encountered by certain classes of railway servants is coming
     to be more precisely ascertained.It is very considerable;
     and it is difficult to prevent men who are in constant danger
     themselves from doing things which may be a source of danger to
     others, or to compel them to obey regulations for which they do
     not see altogether the necessity, and which impede them in their
     work.This difficulty increases with the want of necessary means
     and appliances; and is diminished when, with proper means and
     appliances, stricter discipline becomes possible, safer modes
     of working become habitual, and a higher margin of safety is
     constantly preserved.[14]

  [14] Reports; 1872, page 23, and 1873, page 39.In Great Britain the ingenious theory that superior appliances
or greater personal comfort in some indefinable way lead to
carelessness in employés was carried to such an extent that only
within the last few years has any protection against wind, rain and
sunshine been furnished on locomotives for the engine-drivers and
stokers.The old stage-coach driver faced the elements, and why
should not his successor on the locomotive do the same?--If made too
comfortable, he would become careless and go to sleep!--This was the
line of argument advanced, and the tortures to which the wretched
men were subjected in consequence of it led to their fortifying
nature by drink.They had to be regularly inspected and examined
before mounting the foot-board, to see that they were sober.It took
years in Great Britain for intelligent railroad managers to learn
that the more protected and comfortable a man is the better he will
attend to his duty.And even when the old argument, refuted by long
experience, was at last abandoned as respected the locomotive cab,
it, with perfect freshness and confidence in its own novelty and
force, promptly showed its brutal visage in opposition to the next
new safeguard.For the reasons which Captain Tyler has so forcibly put in the
extracts which have just been quoted, the argument against the block
system from the increased carelessness of employés, supposed to be
induced by it, is entitled to no weight.Neither is the argument
from the delicacy and complication of the automatic, electric signal
system entitled to any more, when urged against that.Not only has
it been too often refuted under similar conditions by practical
results, but in this case it is based on certain assumptions of
fact which are wholly opposed to experience.The record does not
show that there is any peculiar liability to railroad accidents
during periods of storm; perhaps because those in charge of train
movements or persons crossing tracks are under such circumstances
more especially on the look out for danger.On the contrary the
full average of accidents of the worst description appear to
have occurred under the most ordinary conditions of weather, and
usually in the most unanticipated way.This is peculiarly true of
accidents at highway grade crossings.These commonly occur when the
conditions are such as to cause the highway travelers to suppose
that, if any danger existed, they could not but be aware of it.In the next place, the question in regard to automatic electric
signals is exactly what it was in regard to the Westinghouse brake,
with its air-pump, its valves and connecting tubes;--it is the
purely practical question,--Does the thing work?--The burden of
proof is properly on the inventor.In the case of the electric signals they have for years been
in limited but constant use, and while thus in use they have been
undergoing steady improvement.Though now brought to a considerable
degree of comparative perfection they are, of course, still in
their earlier stage of development.In use, however, they have not
been found open to the practical objections urged against them.At
first much too complicated and expensive, requiring more machinery
than could by any reasonable exertions be kept in order and more
care than they were worth, they have now been simplified until a
single battery properly located can do all the necessary work for
a road of indefinite length.As a system they are effective and do
not lead to accidents; nor are they any more subject than telegraph
wires to derangement from atmospheric causes.When any disturbance
does take place, until it can be overcome it amounts simply to a
general signal for operating the road with extreme caution.But with
railroads, as everywhere else in life, it is the normal condition of
affairs for which provision must be made, while the dangers incident
to exceptional circumstances must be met by exceptional precautions.As long as things are in their normal state, that is, probably,
during nineteen days out of twenty, the electric signals have now
through several years of constant trial proved themselves a reliable
safeguard.It can hardly admit of doubt that in the near future they
will be both further perfected and generally adopted.In their management of switches, especially at points of railroad
convergence where a heavy traffic is concentrated and the passage
of trains or movement of cars and locomotives is unceasing,
the English are immeasurably in advance of the Americans; and,
indeed, of all other people.In fact, in this respect the American
managers have shown themselves slow to learn, and have evinced an
indisposition to adopt labor-saving appliances which, considering
their usual quickness of discernment in that regard, is at first
sight inexplicable.Having always been accustomed to the old and
simple methods, just so long as they can through those methods
handle their traffic with a bearable degree of inconvenience and
expense, they will continue to do so.That their present method is
most extravagant, just as extravagant as it would be to rent two
houses or to run two steam engines where one, if properly used,
could be made to suffice, admits of demonstration;--but the waste is
not on the surface, and the necessity for economy is not imperative.The difference of conditions and the difference in results may be
made very obvious by a comparison.Take, for instance, London and
Boston--the Cannon street station in the one and the Beach street
station in the other.The concentration of traffic at London is so
great that it becomes necessary to utilize every foot of ground
devoted to railroad purposes to the utmost possible extent.Not
only must it be packed with tracks, but those tracks must never be
idle.The incessant train movement at Cannon street has already
been referred to as probably the most extraordinary and confusing
spectacle in the whole wide circle of railroad wonders.The result
is that in some way, at this one station and under this single roof,
more trains must daily be made to enter and leave than enter and
leave, not only the Beach street station, but all the eight railroad
stations in Boston combined.[15]

  [15] "It has been estimated that an average of 50,000 persons were,
  in 1869, daily brought into Boston and carried from it, on three
  hundred and eighty-five trains, while the South Eastern railway of
  London received and despatched in 1870, on an average, six hundred
  and fifty trains a day, between 6 A.M.carrying from
  35,000 to 40,000 persons, and this too without the occurrence of a
  single train accident during the year.On one single exceptional
  day eleven hundred and eleven trains, carrying 145,000 persons, are
  said to have entered and left this station in the space of eighteen
  hours."--_Third Annual Report, [1872] of Massachusetts Railroad
  Commissioners, p.141._

  The passenger movement over the roads terminating in Boston was
  probably as heavy on June 17, 1875, as during any twenty-four hours
  in their history.It was returned at 280,000 persons carried in
  641 trains.About twice the passenger movement of the "exceptional
  day" referred to, carried in something more than half the number of
  trains, entering and leaving eight stations instead of one.During eighteen successive hours trains have been made to enter and
leave this station at the rate of more than one in each minute.It
contains four platforms and seven tracks, the longest of which is
720 feet.As compared with the largest station in Boston (the Boston
& Providence), it has the same number of platforms and an aggregate
of 1,500 (three-fifths) more feet of track under cover; it daily
accommodates about nine times as many trains and four times as many
passengers.Of it Barry, in his treatise on Railway Appliances (p.197), says: "The platform area at this station is probably minimised
but, the station accommodates efficiently a very large mixed traffic
of long and short journey trains, amounting at times to as many as
400 trains in and 400 trains out in a working day.[16]"

  [16] The Grand Central Depot on 42d Street in New York City, has
  nearly twice the amount of track room under cover of the Cannon
  street station.The daily train movement of the latter would be
  precisely paralleled in New York, though not equalled in amount, if
  the 42d street station were at Trinity church, and, in addition to
  the trains which now enter and leave it, all the city trains of the
  Elevated road were also provided for there.The American system is, therefore, one of great waste; for, being
conducted in the way it is--that is with stations and tracks
utilized to but a fractional part of their utmost capacity--it
requires a large number of stations and tracks and the services of
many employés.Indeed it is safe to say that, judged by the London
standard, not more than two of the eight stations in Boston are at
this time utilized to above a quarter part of their full working
capacity; and the same is probably true of all other American
cities.Both employés and the travelling public are accustomed to a
slow movement and abundance of room; land is comparatively cheap,
and the pressure of concentration has only just begun to make itself
felt.Accordingly any person, who cares to pass an hour during the
busy time of day in front of an American city station, cannot but
be struck, while watching the constant movement, with the primitive
way in which it is conducted.Here are a multiplicity of tracks all
connected with each other, and cars and locomotives are being passed
from one to another from morning to night.A constant shifting
of switches is going on, and the little shunting engines never
stand still.The switches, however, as a rule, are unprovided with
signals, except of the crudest description; they have no connection
with each other, and during thirty years no change has been made
in the method in which they are worked.When one of them has to be
shifted, a man goes to it and shifts it.To facilitate the process,
the monitor shunting engines are provided with a foot-board in front
and behind, just above the track, upon which the yard hands jump,
and are carried about from switch to switch, thus saving the time
they would occupy if they had to walk.A simpler arrangement could
not be imagined; anyone could devise it.The only wonder is that
even a considerable traffic can be conducted safely in reliance upon
it.Turning from Beach to Cannon street, it is apparent that the
train movement which has there to be accommodated would fall into
inextricable confusion if it was attempted to manage it in the way
which has been described.The number of trains is so great and
the movement so rapid and intricate, that not even a regiment of
employés stationed here and there at the signals and switches could
keep things in motion.From time to time they would block, and then
the whole vast machine would be brought to a standstill until order
could be re-established.The difficulty is overcome in a very simple
way, by means of an equally simple apparatus.The control over
the numerous switches and corresponding signals, instead of being
divided up among many men stationed at many points, is concentrated
in the hands of two men occupying a single gallery, which is
elevated across the tracks in front of the station and commanding
the approaches to it, much as the pilot-house of an American steamer
commands a view of the course before it.From this gallery, by means
of what is known as the interlocking system, every switch and signal
in the yard below is moved; and to such a point of perfection has
the apparatus been carried, that any disaster from the misplacement
of a switch or the display of a wrong signal is rendered impossible.Of this Cannon street apparatus Barry says, "there are here nearly
seventy point and signal levers concentrated in one signal house;
the number of combinations which would be possible if all the
signal and point levers were not interlocked can be expressed only
by millions.Of these only 808 combinations are safe, and by the
interlocking apparatus these 808 combinations are rendered possible,
and all the others impossible."[17]

  [17] _Railway Appliances_, p.It is not proposed to enter at any length into the mechanical
details of this appliance, which, however, must be considered as one
of the three or four great inventions which have marked epochs in
the history of railroad traffic.[18] As, however, it is but little
known in America, and will inevitably within the next few years find
here the widest field for its increased use, a slight sketch of its
gradual development and of its leading mechanical features may not
be out of place.Prior to the year 1846 the switches and signals
on the English roads were worked in the same way that they are now
commonly worked in this country.As a train drew near to a junction,
for instance, the switchman stationed there made the proper track
connection and then displayed the signal which indicated what tracks
were opened and what closed, and which line had the right of way;
and the engine-drivers acted accordingly.As the number of trains
increased and the movement at the junctions became more complicated,
the danger of the wrong switches being thrown or the wrong signals
displayed, increased also.Mistakes from time to time would happen,
even when only the most careful and experienced men were employed;
and mistakes in these matters led to serious consequences.It,
therefore, became the practice, instead of having the switch or
signal lever at the point where the switch or signal itself was, as
is still almost universally the case in this country, to connect
them by rods or wires with their levers, which were concentrated
at some convenient point for working, and placed under the control
of one man instead of several.So far as it went this change was
an improvement, but no provision yet existed against the danger of
mistake in throwing switches and displaying signals.The blunder of
first making one combination of tracks and then showing the signal
for another was less liable to happen after the concentration of
the levers under one hand than before, but it still might happen at
any time, and certainly would happen at some time.If all danger of
accident from human fallibility was ever to be eliminated a far more
complicated mechanical apparatus must be devised.In response to
this need the system of interlocking was gradually developed, though
not until about the year 1856 was it brought to any considerable
degree of perfection.The whole object of this system is to
render it impossible for a switchman, whether because he is weary
or agitated or actually malicious or only inexperienced, to give
contrary signals, or to break his line in one way and to give the
signal for its being broken in another way.To bring this about the
levers are concentrated in a cabin or gallery, and placed side by
side in a frame, their lower ends connecting with the switch-points
and signals by means of rods and wires.Beneath this frame are one
or more long bars, extending its entire length under it and parallel
with it.These are called locking bars; for, being moved to the
right or left by the action of the levers they hold these levers in
certain designated positions, nor do they permit them to occupy any
other.In this way what is termed the interlocking is effected.The
apparatus, though complicated, is simplicity itself compared with
a clock or a locomotive.The complication, also, such as it is,
arises from the fact that each situation is a problem by itself, and
as such has to be studied out and provided for separately.This,
however, is a difficulty affecting the manufacturer rather than the
operator.To the latter the apparatus presents no difficulty which
a fairly intelligent mechanic cannot easily master; while for the
former the highly complicated nature of the problem may, perhaps,
best be inferred from the example given by Mr.Barry, the simplest
that can offer, that of an ordinary junction where a double-track
branch-road connects with its double-track main line.There would
in this case be of necessity two switch levers and four signal
levers, which would admit of sixty-four possible combinations."The
signal might be arranged in any of sixteen ways, and the points
might occupy any of four positions, irrespective of the position
of the signals.Of the sixty-four combinations thus possible
only thirteen are safe, and the rest are such as might lure an
engine-driver into danger."[18] A sufficiently popular description of this apparatus also,
  illustrated by cuts, will be found in Barry's excellent little
  treatise on _Railway Appliances_, already referred to, published by
  Longmans & Co.as one of their series of text-books of science.Originally the locking bar was worked through the direct action of
certain locks, as they were called, between which the levers when
moved played to and fro.These locks were mere bars or plates of
iron, some with inclined sides, and others with sides indented or
notched.At one end they were secured on a pivot to a fixed bar
opposite to and parallel with the movable locking bar, while their
other ends were made fast to the locking bar; whence it necessarily
followed that, as certain of the levers were pushed to and fro
between them, the action of these levers on the inclined sides of
the locks could by a skilful combination be made to throw other
levers into the notches and indentations of other locks, thus
securing them in certain positions, and making it impossible for
them to be in any other positions.The apparatus which has been described, though a great improvement
on anything which had preceded it, was still but a clumsy affair,
and naturally the friction of the levers on the locks was so great
that they soon became worn, and when worn they could not be relied
upon to move the switch-points with the necessary accuracy.The new
appliance of safety had, therefore, as is often the case, introduced
a new and very considerable danger of its own.The signals and
switches, it was true, could no longer disagree, but the points
themselves were sometimes not properly set, or, owing to the great
exertion required to work it, the interlocking gear was strained.This difficulty resulted in the next and last improvement, which
was a genuine triumph of mechanical ingenuity.To insure the proper
length of stroke being made in moving the lever--that is to make
it certain in each case that the switch points were brought into
exactly the proper position--two notches were provided in the slot,
or quadrant, as it is called, in which the lever moved, and, when
it was thrown squarely home, and not until then, a spring catch
caught in one or other of these notches.This spring was worked by
a clasp at the handle of the lever, and the whole was called the
spring catch-rod.By a singularly ingenious contrivance, the process
of interlocking was transferred from the action of the levers and
the keys to these spring catch-rods, which were made to work upon
each other, and thus to become the medium through which the whole
process is effected.The result of this improvement was that, as
the switchman cannot move any lever until the spring-catch rod is
fastened, except for a particular movement, he cannot, do what he
will, even begin any other movement than that one, as the levers
cannot be started.On the other hand, it may be said that, by means
of this improvement, the mere "intention of the signal-man to move
any lever, expressed by his grasping the lever and so raising the
spring catch-rod, independently of his putting his intention in
force, actuates all the necessary locking.[19]"

  [19] In regard to the interlocking system as then in use in England,
  Captain Tyler in his report as head of the railway inspecting
  department of the Board of Trade, used the following language in
  his report on the accidents during 1870."When the apparatus is
  properly constructed and efficiently maintained, the signalman
  cannot make a mistake in the working of his points and signals which
  shall lead to accident or collision, except only by first lowering
  his signal and switching his train forward, then putting up his
  signal again as it approaches, and altering the points as the driver
  comes up to, or while he is passing over them.Such a mistake was
  actually made in one of the cases above quoted.It is, of course,
  impossible to provide completely for cases of this description; but
  the locking apparatus, as now applied, is already of enormous value
  in preventing accidents; and it will have a still greater effect
  on the general safety of railway travelling as it becomes more
  extensively applied on the older lines.Without it, a signalman in
  constantly working points and signals is almost certain sooner or
  later to make a mistake, and to cause an accident of a more or less
  serious character; and it is inexcusable in any railway company to
  allow its mail or express trains to run at high speed through facing
  points which are not interlocked efficiently with the signals, by
  which alone the engine-drivers in approaching them can be guided.There is however, very much yet to be effected in different parts of
  the country in this respect.And it is worth while to record here,
  in illustration of the difficulties that are sometimes met with by
  the inspecting officers, that the Midland Railway Company formally
  protested in June, 1866, against being compelled to apply such
  apparatus before receiving sanction for the opening of new lines
  of railway.They stated that in complying with the requirements in
  this respect of the Board of Trade, they '_were acting in direct
  opposition to their own convictions, and they must, so far as lay in
  their power, decline the responsibility of the locking system_.'"To still further perfect the appliance a simple mechanism has
  since 1870 been attached to the rod actuating the switch-bolt,
  which prevents the signal-man from shifting the switch under a
  passing train in the manner suggested by Captain Tyler in the above
  extract.In fact it is no exaggeration to say that the interlocking
  system has now been so studied, and every possible contingency so
  thoroughly provided for, that in using it accidents can only occur
  through a wilful intention to bring them about.In spite of any theoretical or fanciful objections which may be
urged against it, this appliance will be found an indispensable
adjunct to any really heavy junction or terminal train movement.For
the elevated railroads of New York, for instance, its early adoption
proved a necessity.As for questions of temperature, climate,
etc., as affecting the long connecting rods and wires which are an
essential part of the system, objections based upon them are purely
imaginary.Difficulties from this source were long since met and
overcome by very simple compensating arrangements, and in practice
occasion no inconvenience.That rods may break, and that wires are
at all times liable to get out of gear, every one knows; and yet
this fact is urged as a novel objection to each new mechanical
improvement.That a broken or disordered apparatus will always
occasion a serious disturbance to any heavy train movement, may also
be admitted.The fact none the less remains that in practice, and
daily subjected through long periods of time to incomparably the
heaviest train movement known to railroad experience, the rods of
the interlocking apparatus do not break, nor do its wires get out
of gear; while by means of it, and of it alone, this train movement
goes unceasingly on never knowing any serious disturbance.[20]

  [20] "As an instance of the possibility of preventing the mistakes
  so often made by signal men with conflicting signals or with facing
  points I have shown the traffic for a single day, and at certain
  hours of that day, at the Cannon Street station of the South Eastern
  Railway, already referred to as one of the _no-accident_ lines of
  the year.The traffic of that station, with trains continually
  crossing one another, by daylight and in darkness, in fog or in
  sunshine, amounts to more than 130 trains in three hours in the
  morning, and a similar number in the evening; and, altogether, to
  652 trains, conveying more than 35,000 passengers in the day as
  a winter, or 40,000 passengers a day as a summer average.It is
  probably not too much to say, that without the signal and point
  arrangements which have there been supplied, and the system of
  interlocking which has there been so carefully carried out, the
  signalmen could not carry on their duties _for one hour without
  accident_."_Captain Tyler's report on accidents for 1870, p.35._

It is not, however, alone in connection with terminal stations and
junctions that the interlocking apparatus is of value.It is also
the scientific substitute for the law or regulation compelling
trains to stop as a measure of precaution when they approach
grade-crossings or draw-bridges.It is difficult indeed to pass from
the consideration of this fine result of science and to speak with
patience of the existing American substitute for it.If the former
is a feature in the block system, the latter is a signal example of
the block-head system.As a device to avoid danger it is a standing
disgrace to American ingenuity; and, fortunately, as stopping is
compatible only with a very light traffic, so soon as the passage
of trains becomes incessant a substitute for it has got to be
devised.In this country, as in England, that substitute will be
found in the interlocking apparatus.By means of it the draw-bridge,
for instance, can be so connected with the danger signals--which
may, if desired, be gates closing across the railroad tracks--that
the one cannot be opened except by closing the other.This is the
method adopted in Great Britain not only at draws in bridges, but
frequently also in the case of gates at level road crossings.It
has already been noticed that in Great Britain accidents at draws
in bridges seem to be unknown.Certainly not one has been reported
during the last nine years.The security afforded in this case
by interlocking would, indeed, seem to be absolute; as, if the
apparatus is out of order, either the gates or the bridge would be
closed, and could not be opened until it was repaired.So also as
respects the grade-crossing of one railroad by another.Bringing
all trains to a complete stop when approaching these crossings
is a precaution quite generally observed in America, either as a
matter of statute law or running regulation; and yet during the six
years 1873-8 no less than 104 collisions were reported at these
crossings.In Great Britain during the nine years 1870-8 but nine
cases of accidents of this description were reported, and in both
the years 1877 and 1878 under the head of "Accidents or Collisions
on Level Crossings of Railways," the chief inspector of the Board
of Trade tersely stated that,--"No accident was inquired into under
this head.[21]" The interlocking system there affords the most
perfect protection which can be devised against a most dangerous
practice in railroad construction to which Americans are almost
recklessly addicted.It is, also, matter of daily experience that
the interlocking system does afford a perfect practical safeguard
in this case.Every junction of a branch with a double track
road involves a grade-crossing, and a grade-crossing of the most
dangerous character.On the Metropolitan Elevated railroad of New
York, at 53d street, there is one of these junctions, where, all
day long, trains are crossing at grade at the rate of some twenty
miles an hour.These trains never stop, except when signalled so
to do.The interlocking apparatus, however, makes it impossible
that one track should be open except when the other is closed.An
accident, therefore, can happen only through the wilful carelessness
of the engineer in charge of a train;--and in the face of wilful
carelessness laws are of no more avail than signals.If a man in
control of a locomotive wishes to bring on a collision he can always
do it.Unless he wishes to, however, the interlocking apparatus
not only can prevent him from so doing, but as a matter of fact
always does.The same rule which holds good at junctions would hold
good at level crossings.There is no essential difference between
the two.By means of the interlocking apparatus the crossing can
be so blocked at any desired distance from it in such a way that
when one track is open the other must be closed;--unless, indeed,
the apparatus is out of order, and then both would be closed.The precaution in this case, also, is absolute.Unlike the rule
as to stopping, it does not depend on the caution or judgment of
individuals;--there are the signals and the obstructions, and
if they are not displayed on one road they are on the other.So
superior is this apparatus in every respect--as regards safety as
well as convenience--to the precaution of coming to a stop, that, as
an inducement to introduce an almost perfect scientific appliance,
it would be very desirable that states like Massachusetts and
Connecticut compelling the stop, should except from the operation
of the law all draw-bridges or grade-crossings at which suitable
interlocking apparatus is provided.Surely it is not unreasonable
that in this case science should have a chance to assert itself.[21] "As affecting the safe working of railways, the level crossing
  of one railway by another is a matter of very serious import.Even when signalled on the most approved principles, they are a
  source of danger, and, if possible, should always be avoided.At
  junctions of branch or other railways the practice has been adopted
  by some companies in special cases, to carry the off line under or
  over the main line by a bridge.This course should generally be
  adopted in the case of railways on which the traffic is large, and
  more expressly where express and fast trains are run."_Report on
  Accidents on Railways of the United Kingdom during 1877, p.35._

In any event, however, the general introduction of the interlocking
apparatus into the American railroad system may be regarded as a
mere question of the value of land and concentration of traffic.So long as every road terminating in our larger cities indulges,
at whatever unnecessary cost to its stockholders, in independent
station buildings far removed from business centres, the train
movement can most economically be conducted as it now is.The
expense of the interlocking apparatus is avoided by the very simple
process of incurring the many fold heavier expense of several
station buildings and vast disconnected station grounds.If,
however, in the city of Boston, for instance, the time should come
when the financial and engineering audacity of the great English
companies shall be imitated,--when some leading railroad company
shall fix its central passenger station on Tremont street opposite
the head of Court street, just as in London the South Eastern
established itself on Cannon street, and then this company carrying
its road from Pemberton Square by a tunnel under Beacon Hill and the
State-house should at the crossing of the Charles radiate out so as
to afford all other roads an access for their trains to the same
terminal point, thus concentrating there the whole daily movement of
that busy population which makes of Boston its daily counting-room
and market-place,--then, when this is attempted, the time will have
come for utilizing to its utmost capacity every available inch of
space to render possible the incessant passage of trains.Then also
will it at last be realized that it is far cheaper to use a costly
and intricate apparatus which enables two companies to be run into
one convenient station, than it is to build a separate station, even
at an inconvenient point, to accommodate each company.In March, 1825, there appeared in the pages of the _Quarterly
Review_ an article in which the writer discussed that railway
system, the first vague anticipation of which was then just
beginning to make the world restless.He did this, too, in a very
intelligent and progressive spirit, but unfortunately secured for
his article a permanence of interest he little expected by the
use of one striking illustration.He was peculiarly anxious to
draw a distinct line of demarcation between his own very rational
anticipations and the visionary dreams of those enthusiasts who
were boring the world to death over the impossibilities which they
claimed that the new invention was to work.Among these he referred
to the proposition that passengers would be "whirled at the rate
of eighteen or twenty miles an hour by means of a high pressure
engine," and then contemptuously added,--"We should as soon expect
the people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be fired off upon one
of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as trust themselves to the mercy
of such a machine, going at such a rate; their property perhaps they
may trust."Under the circumstances, the criticism was a perfectly reasonable
one.The danger involved in going at such a rate of speed and the
impossibility of stopping in time to avoid a sudden danger, would
naturally suggest themselves to any one as insuperable objections
to the new system for any practical use.Some means of preserving
a sudden and powerful control over a movement of such unheard of
rapidity would almost as a matter of course be looked upon as a
condition precedent.Yet it is a most noticeable fact in the history
of railroad development that the improvement in appliances for
controlling speed by no means kept pace with the increased rate of
speed attained.Indeed, so far as the possibility of rapid motion
is concerned, there is no reason to suppose that the _Rocket_
could not have held its own very respectably by the side of a
passenger locomotive of the present day.It will be remembered
that on the occasion of the Manchester & Liverpool opening, Mr.Huskisson after receiving his fatal injury was carried seventeen
miles in twenty-five minutes.Since then the details of locomotive
construction have been simplified and improved upon, but no great
change has been or probably will be effected in the matter of
velocity;--as respects that the maximum was practically reached
at once.Yet down to the year 1870 the brake system remained very
much what it was in 1830.Improvements in detail were effected,
but the essential principles were the same.In case of any sudden
emergency, the men in charge of the locomotive had no direct control
over the vehicles in the train; they communicated with them by the
whistle, and when the signal was heard the brakes were applied as
soon as might be.When a train is moving at the rate of forty miles
an hour, by no means a great speed for it while in full motion, it
passes over fifty-eight feet each second;--at sixty miles an hour it
passes over eighty-eight feet.Under these circumstances, supposing
an engine driver to become suddenly aware of an obstruction on the
track, as was the case at Revere, or of something wrong in the train
behind him, as at Shipton, he had first himself to signal danger,
and to this signal the brakemen throughout the train had to respond.Each operation required time, and every second of time represented
many feet of space.It was small matter for surprise, therefore,
that when in 1875 they experimented scientifically in England, it
was ascertained that a train of a locomotive and thirteen cars
moving at a speed of forty-five miles an hour could not be brought
to a stand in less than one minute, or before it had traversed a
distance of half a mile.The same result it will be remembered was
arrived at by practical experience in America, where both at Angola
and at Port Jervis,[22] it was found impossible to stop the trains
in less than half-a-mile, though in each case two derailed cars were
dragging and plunging along at the end of them.[22] _Ante_, pp.The need of a continuous train-brake, operated from the locomotive
and under the immediate control of the engine-driver, had been
emphasized through years by the almost regular recurrence of
accidents of the most appalling character.In answer to this need
almost innumerable appliances had been patented and experimented
with both in Europe and in America.Prior to 1869, however,
these had been almost exclusively what are known as emergency
brakes;--that is, although the trains were equipped with them and
they were operated from the locomotives, they were not relied upon
for ordinary use, but were held in reserve, as it were, against
special exigencies.The Hudson River railroad train at the Hamburg
accident was thus equipped.Practically, appliances which in the
operation of railroads are reserved for emergencies are usually
found of little value when the emergency occurs.Accordingly no
continuous brake had, prior to the development of Westinghouse's
invention, worked its way into general use.Patent brakes had
become a proverb as well as a terror among railroad mechanics,
and they had ceased to believe that any really desirable thing of
the sort would ever be perfected.Westinghouse, therefore, had a
most unbelieving audience to encounter, and his invention had to
fight hard for all the favor it won; nor did his experience with
master mechanics differ, probably, much from Miller's.His first
patents were taken out in 1869, and he early secured the powerful
aid of the Pennsylvania road for his invention.The Pullman Car
Company, also, always anxious to avail themselves of every appliance
of safety as well as of comfort, speedily saw the merits of the
new brake and adopted it; but, as they merely furnished cars and
had nothing to do with the locomotives that pulled them, their
support was not so effective as that of the great railroad company.Naturally enough, also, great hesitation was felt in adopting so
complicated an appliance.It added yet another whole apparatus to
a thing which was already overburdened with machinery.There was,
also, something in the delicacy and precision of the parts of this
new contrivance,--in its air-pump and reservoirs and long connecting
tubes with their numerous valves,--which was peculiarly distasteful
to the average practical railroad mechanic.It was true that the
idea of transmitting power by means of compressed air was by no
means new,--that thousands of drills were being daily driven by
it wherever tunnelling was going on or miners were at work,--yet
the application of this familiar power to the wheels of a railroad
train seemed no less novel than it was bold.It was, in the first
place, evident that the new apparatus would not stand the banging
and hammering to which the old-fashioned hand-brake might safely
be subjected; not indeed without deranging that simple appliance,
but without incurring any very heavy bill for repairs in so doing.Accordingly the new brake was at first carelessly examined and
patronizingly pushed aside as a pretty toy,--nice in theory no
doubt, but wholly unfitted for rough, every-day use.As it was
tersely expressed during a discussion before the Society of Arts
in London, as recently as May, 1877,--"It was no use bringing out
a brake which could not be managed by ordinary officials,--which
was so wonderfully clever that those who had to use it could not
understand it."A line of argument by the way, which, as has been
already pointed out, may with far greater force be applied to the
locomotive itself; and, indeed, unquestionably was so applied
about half a century ago by men of the same calibre who apply it
now, to the intense weariness and discouragement no doubt of the
late George Stephenson.Whether sound or otherwise, however, few
more effective arguments against an appliance can be advanced; and
against the Westinghouse brake it was advanced so effectively,
that even as late as 1871, although largely in use on western
roads, it had found its way into Massachusetts only as an ingenious
device of doubtful merit.It was in August, 1871, that the Revere
disaster occurred, and the Revere disaster, as has been seen,
would unquestionably have been averted had the colliding train
been provided with proper brake power.This at last called serious
attention there to the new appliance.Even then, however, the mere
suggestion of something better being in existence than the venerable
hand-brakes in familiar use did not pass without a vigorous protest;
and at the meeting of railroad officials, which has already been
referred to as having been called by the state commissioners
after the accident, one prominent gentleman, when asked if the
road under his charge was equipped with the most approved brake,
indignantly replied that it was,--that it was equipped with the
good, old-fashioned hand-brake;--and he then proceeded to vehemently
stake his professional reputation on the absolute superiority of
that ancient but somewhat crude appliance over anything else of the
sort in existence.Nevertheless, on this occasion also, the great
dynamic force which is ever latent in first-class railroad accidents
again asserted itself.Even the most opinionated of professional
railroad men, emphatically as he might in public deny it, quietly
yielded as soon as might be.In a surprisingly short time after the
exhibition of ignorance which has been referred to, the railroads in
Massachusetts, as it has already been shown, were all equipped with
train-brakes.[23]

  [23] Page 157.In its present improved shape it is safe to say that in all those
requisites which the highest authorities known on the subject have
laid down as essential to a model train brake, the Westinghouse
stands easily first among the many inventions of the kind.It is
now a much more perfect appliance than it was in 1871, for it was
then simply atmospheric and continuous in its action, whereas it
has since been made automatic and self-regulating.So far as its
fundamental principle is concerned, that is too generally understood
to call for explanation.By means of an air-pump, attached to the
boiler of the locomotive and controlled by the engine-driver, an
atmospheric force is brought to bear, through tubes running under
the cars, upon the break blocks, pressing them against the wheels.The hand of the engine-driver is in fact on every wheel in the
train.This application of power, though unquestionably ingenious
and, like all good things, most simple and obvious when once
pointed out, was originally open to one great objection, which was
persistently and with great force urged against it.The parts of the
apparatus were all delicate, and some injury or derangement of them
was always possible, and sometimes inevitable.The chief advantage
claimed for the brake was, however, that complete dependence could
be placed upon it in the regular movement of trains.It was obvious,
therefore, that if such dependence was placed upon it and any
derangement did occur, the first intimation those in charge of the
train would have that something was wrong might well come in the
shape of a failure of the brake to act, and a subsequent disaster.Both in Massachusetts and in Connecticut, at the crossing of one
railroad by another at the same level in the former state and in the
approach to draws in bridges in the latter, a number of cases of
this failure of the original Westinghouse non-automatic brake to act
did in point of fact occur.Fortunately they, none of them, resulted
in disaster.This, however, was mere good luck, as was illustrated
in the case of the accident of November 11, 1876, at the Communipaw
Ferry on the New Jersey Central.The train was there equipped with
the ordinary train brake.It reached Jersey City on time shortly
after 4 P.M., but, instead of slacking up, it ran directly through
the station and freight offices, carrying away the walls and
supports, and the locomotive then plunged into the river beyond.The baggage and smoking car followed but fortunately lodged on the
locomotive, thus blocking the remainder of the train.Fortunately no
one was killed, and no passengers were seriously injured.Again, on the Metropolitan Elevated railroad in New York city, on
the evening of June 23, 1879, one of the trains was delayed for a
few moments at the Franklin street station.Meanwhile the next train
came along, and, though the engine-driver of this following train
saw the danger signals and endeavored to stop in time, he found his
brake out of order, and a collision ensued resulting in the injury
of one employé and the severe shattering of a passenger coach and
locomotive.It was only a piece of good fortune that the first
of these accidents did not result in a repetition of the Norwalk
disaster and the second in that of Revere.It so chanced that it was the Smith vacuum brake which failed to
work at Communipaw, and the Eames vacuum which failed to work at
Franklin street.It might just
as well have been the original Westinghouse.The difficulty lay, not
in the maker's name, but in the imperfect action of the brake; and
such significant intimations are not to be disregarded.The chances
are naturally large that the failure of the continuous brake to act
will not at once occur under just those circumstances which will
entail a serious disaster and heavy loss of life; that, however, if
such intimations as these are disregarded, it will sooner or later
so occur does not admit of doubt.But the possibility that upon some given occasion it might fail to
work was not the only defect in the original Westinghouse; it might
well be in perfect order and in full action even, and then suddenly,
as the result of derailment or separation of parts, the apparatus
might be broken, and at once the shoes would drop from the wheels,
and the vehicles of the disabled train would either press forward,
or, on an incline, stop and run backwards until their unchecked
momentum was exhausted.This appears to have been the case at
Wollaston, and contributed some of its most disastrous features to
that accident.To obviate these defects Westinghouse in 1872 invented what he
termed a triple valve attachment, by means of which, if the
thing can be so expressed, his brake was made to always stand at
danger.That is, in case of any derangement of its parts, it was
automatically applied and the train stopped.The action of the brake
was thus made to give notice of anything wrong anywhere in the
train.A noticeable case of this occurred on the Midland railway in
England, when on the November 22, 1876, as the Scotch express was
approaching the Heeley station, at a speed of some sixty miles an
hour, the hind-guard felt the automatic brake suddenly self-applied.The forward truck of a Pullman car in the middle of the train had
left the rails; the front part of the train broke the couplings
and went on, while the rear carriages, acted upon by the automatic
brakes, came to a stand immediately behind the Pullman, which
finally rested on its side across the opposite track.On the other hand, as the Scotch express on the
North Eastern road was approaching Morpeth, on March 25, 1877, at
a speed of some twenty-five miles an hour, the locomotive for some
reason left the track.The train was not equipped with an automatic
brake, and the carriages in it accordingly pressed forward upon
each other until three of them were so utterly destroyed as to be
indistinguishable.Five passengers lost their lives; the remains of
one of whom, together with the wheels of a carriage, were afterwards
taken out from the tank of the tender, into which they had been
driven by the force of the shock.The theoretical objection to the automatic brake is obvious.In
case of any derangement of its machinery it applies itself, and,
should these derangements be of frequent occurrence, the consequent
stoppage of trains would prove a great annoyance, if not a source
of serious danger.This objection is not sustained by practical
experience.The triple valve, so called, is the only complicated
portion of the automatic brake, and this valve is well protected
and not liable to get out of order.[24] Should it become deranged
it will stop the working of the brake on that car alone to which it
belongs; and it will become deranged so as to set the brake only
from causes which would render the non-automatic brake inoperative.When anything of this sort occurs, it stops the train until the
defect is remedied.The returns made to the English Board of
Trade enable us to know just how frequently in actual and regular
service these stoppages occur, and what they amount to.Take, for
instance, the North Eastern and the Caledonian railways.During the last six months of 1878 the first
ran 138,000 train miles with it, in the course of which there
were eight delays or stoppages of some three to five minutes each
occasioned by the action of the triple-valve; being in round numbers
one occasion of delay in 17,000 miles of train movement.On the
Caledonian railway, during the same period, four brake failures, due
to the action of the triple-valve, were reported in runs aggregating
over 62,000 miles, being about one failure to 15,000 miles.These
failures moreover occasioned delays of only a few minutes each, and,
where the cause of the difficulty was not so immediately apparent
that it could at once be remedied, the brake-tubes of the vehicle
on which the difficulty occurred were disconnected, and the trains
went on.[25] One of these stoppages, however, resulted in a serious
accident.As a train on the Caledonian road was approaching the
Wemyss Bay junction on December 14th, in a dense fog, the engine
driver, seeing the signals at danger, undertook to apply his brake
slightly, when it went full on, stopping the train between the
distant and home signals, as they are called in the English block
system.After the danger signal was lowered, but before the brake
could be released, the signal-man allowed a following train to enter
upon the same block section, and a collision followed in which some
thirteen passengers were slightly injured.This accident, however,
as the inspecting officer of the Board of Trade very properly found,
was due not at all to the automatic brake, but to "carelessness
on the part of the signal-man, who disregarded the rules for the
working of the block telegraph instruments," and to the driver
of the colliding train, who "disobeyed the company's running
regulations."It gives an American, however, a realizing sense of
one of the difficulties under which those crowded British lines are
operated, to read that in this case the fog was "so thick that the
tail-lamp was not visible from an approaching train for more than a
few yards."[24] Speaking of the modifications introduced into his brake by
  Westinghouse since 1874, Mr.Thomas E. Harrison, civil engineer
  of the North Eastern Railway Company in a communication to the
  directors of that company of April 24, 1879, recommending the
  adoption by it of the Westinghouse, and subsequently ordered to
  be printed for the use of Parliament, thus referred to the triple
  valve: "As the most important [of these modifications] I will
  particularly draw your attention to the "triple-valve" which has
  been made a regular bugbear by the opponents of the system, and has
  been called complicated, delicate, and liable to get out of order,
  etc.* * * It is, in fact, as simple a piece of mechanism as well
  can be imagined, certain in its action, of durable materials, easily
  accessible to an ordinary workman for examination or cleaning, and
  there is nothing about it that can justify the term complication; on
  the contrary, it is a model of ingenuity and simplicity."[25] During the six months ending June 30, 1879, some 300 stops due
  to some derangement of the apparatus of the Westinghouse brake were
  reported by ten companies in runs aggregating about two million
  miles.Being one stop to 6,600 miles run.Very many of these stops
  were obviously due to the want of familiarity of the employés with
  an apparatus new to them, but as a rule the delays occasioned did
  not exceed a very few minutes; of 82 stoppages, for instance,
  reported on the London, Brighton & South Coast road, the two longest
  were ten minutes each and the remainder averaged some three or four
  minutes.After the application of the triple valve had made it automatic,
there remained but one further improvement necessary to render
the Westinghouse a well-nigh perfect brake.A superabundance of
self-acting power had been secured, but no provision was yet made
for graduating the use of that power so that it should be applied
in the exact degree, neither more nor less, which would soonest
stop the train.This for two reasons is mechanically a matter of
no little importance.As is well known a too severe application of
brakes, no matter of what kind they are, causes the wheels to stand
still and slide upon the rails.This is not only very injurious to
rolling stock, the wheels of which are flattened at the points which
slide, but, as has long been practically well-known to those whose
business it is to run locomotives, when once the wheels begin to
slide the retarding power of the brakes is seriously diminished.In order, therefore, to secure the maximum of retarding power, the
pressure of the brake-blocks on the revolving wheels should be very
great when first applied, and just sufficient not to slide them; and
should then be diminished, _pari passu_ with the momentum of the
train, until it wholly stops.Familiar as all this has long been
to engine-drivers and practical railroad mechanics, yet it has not
been conceded in the results of many scientific inquiries.In the
report of one of the Royal Commissions on Accidents, for instance,
it was asserted that the momentum of a train was retarded more by
the action of sliding than of slowly revolving wheels; and again,
as recently as in May, 1877, in a scientific discussion in London
at one of the meetings of the Society of Arts, a gentleman, with
the letters C. E. appended to his name, ventured the surprising
assertion that "no brake could do more than skid the wheels of
a train, and all continuous brakes professed to do this, and he
believed did so about equally well."Now, what it is here asserted
no brake can do is exactly what the perfect brake will be made to
do,--and what Westinghouse's latest improvement, it is claimed,
enables his brake to do.It much more than "skids the wheels," by
measuring out exactly that degree of power necessary to hold the
wheels just short of the skidding point, and in this way always
exerts the maximum retarding force.This is brought about by means
of a contrivance which allows the air to leak out of the brake
cylinders so as to exactly proportion the pressure of the blocks
on the wheels to the speed with which the latter are revolving.In other, and more scientific, language the force with which the
brake-blocks are pressed upon the wheels is made to adjust itself
automatically as the "coefficient of dynamic friction augments with
the reduction of train speed."It hardly needs to be said that in
this way the power of the brake is enormously increased.In America the superiority of the Westinghouse over any other
description of train-brake has long been established through that
large preponderance of use which in such matters constitutes the
final and irreversible verdict.[26] In Europe, however, and
especially in Great Britain, ever since the Shipton-on-Cherwell
accident in 1874, the battle of the brakes, as it may not
inappropriately be called, has waxed hotter and hotter; and not only
has this battle been extremely interesting in a scientific way, but
it has been highly characteristic, and at times enlivened by touches
of human nature which were exceedingly amusing.[26] In Massachusetts, for instance, where no official pressure
  in favor of any particular brake was brought to bear, out of 473
  locomotives equipped with train-brakes 361 have the Westinghouse,
  which is also applied to 1,363 out of 1,669 cars.Of these, however,
  79 locomotives and 358 cars are equipped with both the atmospheric
  and the vacuum brakes.The English battle of the brakes may be said to have fairly opened
with the official report from Captain Tyler on the Shipton accident,
in reference to which he expressed the opinion, which has already
been quoted in describing the accident, that "if the train had
been fitted with continuous brakes throughout its whole length
there is no reason why it should not have been brought to rest
without any casuality."The Royal Commission on railroad accidents
then took the matter up and called for a series of scientifically
conducted experiments.These took place under the supervision of
two engineers appointed by the Commission, who were aided by a
detail of officers and men from the royal engineers.Eight brakes
competed, and a train, consisting of a locomotive and thirteen
cars, was specially prepared for each.With these trains some
seventy runs were made, and their results recorded and tabulated;
the experiments were continued through six consecutive working
days.Of the brakes experimented with three were American in their
origin,--Westinghouse's automatic and vacuum, and Smith's vacuum.The remainder were English, and were steam, hydraulic, and air
brakes; among them also was one simple emergency brake.The result
of the trials was a very decided victory for the Westinghouse
automatic, and upon its performances the Commission based its
conclusion that trains ought to be so equipped that in cases of
emergency they could be brought to rest, when travelling on level
ground at 50 miles an hour, within a distance of 275 yards; with
an allowance of distance in cases of speed greater or less than
50 miles nearly proportioned to its square.These allowances they
tabulated as follows:--

  At 60 miles per hour, stopping distance within 400 yards.
  "55        "            "           "        340   "
  "  50        "            "           "        275   "
  "  45        "            "           "        220   "
  "  40        "            "           "        180   "
  "  35        "            "           "        135   "
  "  30        "            "           "        100   "

To appreciate the enormous advance in what may be called stopping
power which these experiments revealed, it should be added that
the first series of experiments made at Newark were with trains
equipped only with the hand-brake.The average speed in these
experiments was 47 miles, and with the train-brake, according to the
foregoing tabulation, the stop should have been made in about 250
yards; in reality it was made in a little less than five times that
distance, or 1120 yards; in other words the experiments showed that
the improved appliances had more than quadrupled the control over
trains.It has already been noticed that in the cases of the Angola
and the Port Jervis disasters, as well as in that at Shipton, the
trains ran some 2,700 feet before they could be stopped.Under the
English tabulations above given, in the results of which certain
recent improvements do not enter, a train running into the 42d
Street Station in New York, at a speed of forty-five miles an hour
when under the entrance arches, would be stopped before it reached
the buffers at the end of the covered tracks.The Royal Commission experiments were followed in May and June,
1877, by yet others set on foot by the North Eastern Railway
Company for the purpose of making a competitive test of the
Westinghouse automatic and the Smith's vacuum brakes.At this trial
also the average stop at a speed of 50 miles an hour was effected
in 15 seconds, and within a distance of 650 feet.Other series
of experiments with similar results were, about the same time,
conducted under the auspices of the Belgian and German governments,
of which elaborate official reports were made.The result was that
at last, under date of August 30, 1877, the Board of Trade issued
a circular to the railway companies in which it called attention to
the fact that, notwithstanding all the discussion which had taken
place and the elaborate official trials which the government had set
on foot, there had "apparently been no attempt on the part of the
various companies to take the first step of agreeing upon what are
the requirements which, in their opinion, are essential to a good
continuous brake."In other words, the Board found that, instead of
becoming better, matters were rapidly becoming worse.Each company
was equipping its rolling stock with that appliance in which its
officers happened to be interested as owners or inventors, and when
carriages thus equipped passed from the tracks of one road onto
those of another the result was a return to the old hand-brake
system in a condition of impaired efficiency.The Board accordingly
now proceeded to narrow down the field of selection by specifying
the following as what it considered the essentials of a good
continuous brake:--

     _a._ "The brakes to be efficient in stopping trains,
     instantaneous in their actions, and capable of being applied
     without difficulty by engine-drivers or guards._b._ "In case of accident, to be instantaneously self-acting._c._ "The brakes to be put on and taken off (with facility) on
     the engine and on every vehicle of a train._d._ "The brakes to be regularly used in daily working._e._ "The materials employed to be of a durable character, so as
     to be easily maintained and kept in order."These requirements pointed about as directly as they could to the
Westinghouse, to the exclusion of all competing brakes.Not more
than one other complied with them in all respects, and many made
no pretence of complying at all.Then followed what may be termed
the battle royal of the brakes, which as yet shows no signs of
drawing to a close.As the avowed object of the Board of Trade was
to introduce, one brake, to the necessary exclusion of all others,
throughout the railroad system of Great Britain, the magnitude of
the prize was not easy to over-estimate.The weight of scientific
and official authority was decidedly in favor of the Westinghouse
automatic, but among the railroad men the Smith vacuum found
the largest number of adherents.It failed to meet three of the
requirements of the Board of Trade, in that it was neither automatic
nor instantaneous in its action, while the materials employed in
it were not of a durable character.It was, on the other hand, a
brake of unquestioned excellence, while it commended itself to the
judgment of the average railroad official by its simplicity, and to
that of the average railroad director by its apparent cheapness.Any
one could understand it, and its first cost was temptingly small.The real struggle in Great Britain, therefore, has been, and now
is, between these two brakes; and the fact that both of them are
American has been made to enter largely into it, and in a way also
which at times lent to the discussion an element of broad humor.For instance, the energetic agent of the Smith vacuum, feeling
himself aggrieved by some statement which appeared in the _Times_,
responded thereto in a circular, in the composition of which he
certainly evinced more zeal than either judgment or literary skill.This circular and its author were then referred to by the editors
of _Engineering_, a London scientific journal, in the following
slightly _de haut en bas_ style:--

     "It is not a little remarkable, and it is a fact not harmonious
     with the feelings of English engineers, that the two brakes
     recommending themselves for adoption are of American origin.* * * Now we cannot wonder, considering what our past experience
     has been in many of our dealings with Americans, that this
     feeling of distrust and prejudice exists.It is not merely
     sentimental, it is founded on many and untoward and costly
     experiences of the past, and the fear of similar experiences in
     the future.And when we see the representative of one of these
     systems adopting the traditional policy of his country, and
     meeting criticism with abuse--abuse of men pre-eminent in the
     profession, and journals which he apparently forgets are neither
     American nor venal--we do not wonder that our railway engineers
     feel a repugnance to commit themselves."The superiority of the British over the American controversialist,
as respects courtesy and restraint in language, being thus
satisfactorily established, it only remained to illustrate it.This, however, had already been done in the previous May; for at
that time it chanced that Captain Tyler, having retired from his
position at the head of the railway inspectors department of the
Board of Trade, was considering an offer which Mr.Westinghouse had
made him to associate himself with the company owning the brakes
known by that name.Before accepting this offer, Captain Tyler
took advantage of a meeting of the Society of Arts to publicly
give notice that he was considering it.This he did in a really
admirable paper on the whole subject of continuous brakes, at the
close of which a general discussion was invited and took place, and
in the course of it the innate superiority of the British over any
other kind of controversialist, so far at least as courtesy and a
delicate refraining from imputations is concerned, received pointed
illustration.Houghton, C. E., took
occasion to refer to the paper he had read as "an elaborate puff
to the Westinghouse brake, with which he [Tyler] was, as he told,
connected, or about to be."Steele proceeded to say
that:--

     "On receiving the invitation to be present at the meeting, he
     had been somewhat afraid that Captain Tyler was going to lose
     his fine character for impartiality by throwing in his lot with
     the brake-tinkers, but it came out that not only was he going to
     do that, but actually going to be a partner in a concern.* * *
     The speaker then proceeded to discuss the Westinghouse brake,
     which he called the Westinghouse and Tyler brake, designating
     it as a jack-in-the-box, a rattle trap, to please and decoy,
     and not an invention at all.No engineer had a hand in its
     manufacture.It was the discovery of some Philadelphia barber
     or some such thing.This was
     a brake which had all sorts of pretensions.It had not worked
     well, but whenever there was any row about its not working
     well, they got the papers to praise it up, and that was how the
     papers were under the thumb, and would not speak of any other.* * * He thought it would not do for railway companies to take
     a bad brake, and Captain Tyler and Mr.Westinghouse be able
     to make their fortunes by floating a limited company for its
     introduction.They had heard of Emma mines and Lisbon tramways,
     and such like, and he felt it would not be well to stand by and
     allow this to be done."All of which was not only to the point, but finely calculated to
show the American inventors and agents who were present the nice and
mutually respectful manner in which such discussions were carried on
by all Englishmen.Though the avowed adhesion of Sir Henry Tyler to the Westinghouse
was a most important move in the war of the brakes, it did not
prove a decisive one.The complete control of the field was too
valuable a property to be yielded in deference to that, or any other
name without a struggle; and, so to speak, there were altogether
too many ins and outs to the conflict.Back door influences had
everywhere to be encountered.The North Western, for instance, is
the most important of the railway companies of the United Kingdom.The locomotive superintendent of that company was the part inventor
and proprietor of an emergency brake which had been extensively
adopted by it on its rolling stock, but which wholly failed to meet
the requirements laid down in its circular by the Board of Trade.Immediately after issuing that circular the Board of Trade called
the attention of the company to this fact in connection with an
accident which had recently occurred, and in very emphatic language
pointed out that the brakes in question could not "in any reasonable
sense of the word be called continuous brakes," and that it was
clear that the circular requirements were "not complied with by the
brake-system of the London & North Western Railway Company;" in case
that company persisted in the use of that brake, the secretary of
the Board went on to say, "in the event of a casualty occurring,
which an efficient system of brakes might have prevented, a heavy
personal responsibility will rest upon those who are answerable for
such neglect."This was certainly language tolerably direct in its
import.As such it was calculated to cause those to whom it was
addressed to pause in their action.The company, however, treated it
with a superb disregard, all the more contemptuous because veiled
in language of deferential civility.They then quietly went on
applying their locomotive superintendent's emergency brake to their
equipment, until on the 30th of June, 1879, they returned no less
than 2,052 carriages fitted with it; that being by far the largest
number returned by any one company in the United Kingdom.A more direct challenge to the Board of Trade and to Parliament
could not easily have been devised.To appreciate how direct it
was, it is necessary to bear in mind that in its circular of August
30, 1877, in which the requirements of a satisfactory train-brake
were laid down, the Board of Trade threw out to the companies
the very significant hint, that they "would do well to reflect
that if a doubt should arise that from a conflict of interest or
opinion, or from any other cause, they [the companies] are not
exerting themselves, it is obvious that they will call down upon
themselves an interference which the Board of Trade, no less than
the companies, desire to avoid."In his general report on the
accidents of the year 1877, the successor of Captain Tyler expressed
the opinion that "sufficient information and experience would now
appear to be available, and the time is approaching when the railway
companies may fairly be expected to come to a decision as to which
of the systems of continuous brakes is best calculated to fulfil the
requisite conditions, and is most worthy of general adoption."At
the close of another year, however, the official returns seemed to
indicate that, while but a sixth part of the passenger locomotives
and a fifth part of the carriages in use on the railroads of the
United Kingdom were yet equipped with continuous brakes at all, a
concurrence of opinion in favor of any one system was more remote
than ever.During the six months ending December 31, 1878, but 127
additional locomotives out of about 4000, and 1,200 additional
carriages out of some 32,000 were equipped; of which 70 locomotives
and 530 carriages had been equipped with the Smith vacuum, which in
three most important respects failed to comply with the Board of
Trade requirements.Under these circumstances the Board of Trade
was obviously called upon either to withdraw from the position it
had taken, or to invite that "interference" in its support to which
in its circular of August, 1877 it had so portentously referred.It
decided to do the latter, and in March, 1879 the government gave an
intimation in the House of Lords that early Parliamentary action was
contemplated.As it is expressed, the railway companies are to "be
relieved of their indecision."In Great Britain, therefore, the long battle of the brakes would
seem to be drawing to its close.The final struggle, however,
will be a spirited one, and one which Americans will watch with
considerable interest,--for it is in fact a struggle between two
American brakes, the Westinghouse and the Smith vacuum.Of the
907 locomotives hitherto equipped with the continuous brakes no
less than 819 are equipped with one or the other of these American
patents, besides over 4,464 of the 9,919 passenger carriages.The
remaining 3,857 locomotives and 30,000 carriages are the prize of
victory.As the score now stands the vacuum brake is in almost
exactly twice the use of its more scientific rival.The weight
of authority and experience, and the requirements of the Board of
Trade, are, however, on the opposite side.As deduced from the European scientific tests and the official
returns, the balance of advantages would seem to be as follows:--In
favor of the vacuum are its superficial simplicity, and possible
economy in first cost:--In favor of the Westinghouse automatic are
its superior quickness in application, the greater rapidity in
its stopping power, the more durable nature of its materials, the
smaller cost in renewal, its less liability to derangement, and
above all its self-acting adjustment.The last is the point upon
which the final issue of the struggle must probably turn.The use
of any train-brake which is not automatic in its action, as has
already been pointed out, involves in the long run disaster,--and
ultimate serious disaster.The mere fact that the brake is generally
so reliable,--that ninety-nine times out of the hundred it works
perfectly,--simply makes disaster certain by the fatal confidence
it inspires.Ninety-nine times in a hundred the brake proves
reliable;--nine times in the remaining ten of the thousand, in which
it fails, a lucky chance averts disaster;--but the thousandth time
will assuredly come, as it did at Communipaw and on the New York
Elevated railway, and, much the worst of all yet, at Wollaston.Soon or late the use of non-automatic continuous brakes will most
assuredly, if they are not sooner abandoned, be put an end to
by the occurrence of some not-to-be forgotten catastrophe of the
first magnitude, distinctly traceable to that cause.Meanwhile that
automatic brakes are complicated and sometimes cause inconvenience
in their operation is most indisputable.This is an objection, also,
to which they are open in common with most of the riper results of
human ingenuity;--but, though sun-dials are charmingly simple, we do
not, therefore, discard chronometers in their favor; neither do we
insist on cutting our harvests with the scythe, because every man
who may be called upon to drive a mowing machine may not know how
to put one together.But what Sir Henry Tyler has said in respect
to this oldest and most fallacious, as well as most wearisome, of
objections covers the whole ground and cannot be improved upon.After referring to the fact that simplicity in construction and
simplicity in working were two different things, and that, almost
invariably, a certain degree of complication in construction is
necessary to secure simplicity in working,--after pointing this out
he went on to add that,--

     "Simplicity as regards the application of railway brakes is
     not obtained by the system now more commonly employed of
     brake-handles to be turned by different men in different
     parts of the train; but is obtained when, by more complicated
     construction an engine-driver is able easily in an instant to
     apply ample brake-power at pleasure with more or less force
     to every wheel of his train; is obtained when, every time an
     engine-driver starts, or attempts to start his train, the brake
     itself informs him if it is out of order; and is still more
     obtained when, on the occasion of an accident and the separation
     of a coupling, the brakes will unfailingly apply themselves on
     every wheel of the train without the action of the engine-driver
     or guards, [brakemen], and before even they have time to realize
     the necessity for it.This is true simplicity in such a case,
     and that system of continuous brakes which best accomplishes
     such results in the shortest space of time is so far preferable
     to all others."THE RAILROAD JOURNEY RESULTING IN DEATH.One day in May, 1847, as the Queen of Belgium was going from
Verviers to Brussels by rail, the train in which she was journeying
came into collision with another train going in the opposite
direction.There was naturally something of a panic, and, as
royalty was not then accustomed to being knocked about with
railroad equality, some of her suite urged the queen to leave the
train and to finish her journey by carriage.The contemporaneous
court reporter then went on to say, in that language which is
so peculiarly his own,--"But her Majesty, as courageously as
discreetly, declined to set that example of timidity, and she
proceeded to Brussels by the railway."In those days a very
exaggerated idea was universally entertained of the great danger
incident to travel by rail.Even then, however, had her Majesty, who
was doubtless a very sensible woman, happened to be familiar with
the statistics of injuries received by those traveling respectively
by rail and by carriage, she certainly never on any plea of danger
would have been induced to abandon her railroad train in order to
trust herself behind horse-flesh.By pursuing the course urged
upon her, the queen would have multiplied her chances of accident
some sixty fold.Strange as the statement sounds even now, such
would seem to have been the fact.In proportion to the whole number
carried, the accidents to passengers in "the good old days of
stage-coaches" were, as compared to the present time of the railroad
dispensation, about as sixty to one.This result, it is true, cannot
be verified in the experience either of England or of this country,
for neither the English nor we possess any statistics in relation
to the earlier period; but they have such statistics in France,
stretching over the space of more than forty years, and as reliable
as statistics ever are.If these French statistics hold true in New
England,--and considering the character of our roads, conveyances,
and climate, their showing is more likely to be in our favor than
against us,--if they simply hold true, leaving us to assume that
stage-coach traveling was no less safe in Massachusetts than in
France, then it would follow that to make the dangers of the rail
of the present day equal to those of the highway of half a century
back, some eighty passengers should annually be killed and some
eleven hundred injured within the limits of Massachusetts alone.These figures, however, represent rather more than fifty times the
actual average, and from them it would seem to be not unfair to
conclude that, notwithstanding the great increase of population and
the yet greater increase in travel during the last half-century,
there were literally more persons killed and injured each year in
Massachusetts fifty years ago through accidents to stage-coaches
than there are now through accidents to railroad trains.The first impression of nine out of ten persons in no way connected
with the operations of railroads would probably be found to be
the exact opposite to this.A vague but deeply rooted conviction
commonly prevails that the railroad has created a new danger;
that because of it the average human being's hold on life is more
precarious than it was.The first point-blank, bald statement to the
contrary would accordingly strike people in the light not only of a
paradox, but of a somewhat foolish one.Investigation, nevertheless,
bears it out.The fact is that when a railroad accident comes, it is
apt to come in such a way as to leave no doubt whatever in relation
to it.It is heralded like a battle or an earthquake; it fills
columns of the daily press with the largest capitals and the most
harrowing details, and thus it makes a deep and lasting impression
on the minds of many people.When a multitude of persons, traveling
as almost every man now daily travels himself, meet death in such
sudden and such awful shape, the event smites the imagination.People seeing it and thinking of it, and hearing and reading of
it, and of it only, forget of how infrequent occurrence it is.It
was not so in the olden time.Every one rode behind horses,--if not
in public then in private conveyances,--and when disaster came it
involved but few persons and was rarely accompanied by circumstances
which either struck the imagination or attracted any great public
notice.In the first place, the modern newspaper, with its perfect
machinery for sensational exaggeration, did not then exist,--having
itself only recently come in the train of the locomotive;--and, in
the next place, the circle of those included in the consequences of
any disaster was necessarily small.For
weeks and months the vast machinery moves along, doing its work
quickly, swiftly, safely; no one pays any attention to it, while
millions daily make use of it.It is as much a necessity of their
lives as the food they eat and the air they breathe.Suddenly,
somehow, and somewhere,--at Versailles, at Norwalk, at Abergele, at
New Hamburg, or at Revere,--at some hitherto unfamiliar point upon
an insignificant thread of the intricate iron web, an obstruction is
encountered, a jar, as it were, is felt, and instantly, with time
for hardly an ejaculation or a thought, a multitude of human beings
are hurled into eternity.It is no cause for surprise that such an
event makes the community in which it happens catch its breadth;
neither is it unnatural that people should think more of the few who
are killed, of whom they hear so much, than of the myriads who are
carried in safety and of whom they hear nothing.Yet it is well to
bear in mind that there are two sides to that question also, and in
no way could this fact be more forcibly brought to our notice than
by the assertion, borne out by all the statistics we possess, that,
irrespective of the vast increase in the number of those who travel,
a greater number of passengers in stage-coaches were formerly
each year killed or injured by accidents to which they in no way
contributed through their own carelessness, than are now killed
under the same conditions in our railroad cars.In other words, the
introduction of the modern railroad, so far from proportionately
increasing the dangers of traveling, has absolutely diminished them.It is not, after all, the dangers but the safety of the modern
railroad which should excite our special wonder.What is the average length of the railroad journey resulting in
death by accident to a prudent traveler?--What is the average length
of one resulting in some personal injury to him?--These are two
questions which interest every one.Few persons, probably, start
upon any considerable journey, implying days and nights on the
rail, without almost unconsciously taking into some consideration
the risks of accident.Visions of collision, derailment, plunging
through bridges, will rise unbidden.Even the old traveler who
has enjoyed a long immunity is apt at times, with some little
apprehension, to call to mind the musty adage of the pitcher and
the well, and to ask himself how much longer it will be safe for
him to rely on his good luck.A hundred thousand miles, perhaps,
and no accident yet!--Surely, on every doctrine of chances, he
now owes to fate an arm or a leg;--perhaps a life.The statistics
of a long series of years enable us, however, to approximate with
a tolerable degree of precision to an answer to these questions,
and the answer is simply astounding;--so astounding, in fact,
that, before undertaking to give it, the question itself ought to
be stated with all possible precision.It is this:--Taking all
persons who as passengers travel by rail,--and this includes all
dwellers in civilized countries,--what number of journeys of the
average length are safely accomplished, to each one which results
in the death or injury of a passenger from some cause over which he
had no control?--The cases of death or injury must be confined to
passengers, and to those of them only who expose themselves to no
unnecessary risk.When approaching a question of this sort, statisticians are apt to
assume for their answers an appearance of mathematical accuracy.It is needless to say that this is a mere affectation.The best
results which can be arrived at are, after all, mere approximations,
and they also vary greatly year by year.The body of facts from
which conclusions are to be deduced must cover not only a definite
area of space, but also a considerable lapse of time.Even Great
Britain, with its 17,000 miles of track and its hundreds of millions
of annual passenger journeys, shows results which, one year with
another, vary strangely.For instance, during the four years
anterior to 1874, but one passenger was killed, upon an average, to
each 11,000,000 carried; while in 1874 the proportion, under the
influence of a succession of disasters, suddenly doubled, rising to
one in every 5,500,000; and then again in 1877, a year of peculiar
exemption, it fell off to one in every 50,000,000.The percentage of
fatal casualties to the whole number carried was in 1847-9 five fold
what it was in 1878.If such fluctuations reveal themselves in the
statistics of Great Britain, those met with in the narrower field of
a single state in this country might well seem at first glance to
set all computation at defiance.During the ten years, for example,
between 1861 and 1870, about 200,000,000 passengers were returned
as carried on the Massachusetts roads, with 135 cases of injury to
individuals.Then came the year of the Revere disaster, and out of
26,000,000 carried, no less than 115 were killed or injured.Seven
years of comparative immunity then ensued, during which, out of
240,000,000 carried, but two were killed and forty-five injured.In other words, through a period of ten years the casualties were
approximately as one to 1,500,000; then during a single year they
rose to one in 250,000, or a seven-fold increase; and then through
a period of seven years they diminished to one in 3,400,000, a
decrease of about ninety per cent.Taking, however, the very worst of years,--the year of the
Revere disaster, which stands unparalleled in the history of
Massachusetts,--it will yet be found that the answer to the question
as to the length of the average railroad journey resulting in death
or in injury will be expressed, not in thousands nor in hundreds
of thousands of miles, but in millions.During that year some
26,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the limits of the
state, and each journey averaged a distance of about 13 miles.It
would seem, therefore, that, even in that year, the average journey
resulting in death was 11,000,000 miles, while that resulting either
in death or personal injury was not less than 3,300,000.The year 1871, however, represented by no means a fair average.On the contrary, it indicated what may fairly be considered an
excessive degree of danger, exciting nervous apprehensions in the
breasts of those even who were not constitutionally timid.To reach
what may be considered a normal average, therefore, it would be
more proper to include a longer period in the computation.Take,
for instance, the nine years, 1871-79, during which alone has
any effort been made to reach statistical accuracy in respect to
Massachusetts railroad accidents.During those nine years, speaking
in round numbers and making no pretence at anything beyond a
general approximation, some 303,000,000 passenger journeys of 13
miles each have been made on the railroads and within the state.Of these 51 have resulted in death and 308 in injuries to persons
from causes over which they had no control.The average distance,
therefore, traveled by all, before death happened to any one, was
about 80,000,000 miles, and that travelled before any one was either
injured or killed was about 10,800,000.The Revere disaster of 1871, however, as has been seen, brought
about important changes in the methods of operating the railroads
of Massachusetts.Consequently the danger incident to railroad
traveling was materially reduced; and in the next eight years
(1872-9) some 274,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the
limits of the state.The Wollaston disaster of October, 1878, was
included in this period, during which 223 persons were injured and
21 were killed.The average journey for these years resulting in any
injury to a passenger was close upon 15,000,000 miles, while that
resulting in death was 170,000,000.But it may fairly be asked,--What, after all, do these figures
mean?--They are, indeed, so large as to exceed comprehension; for,
after certain comparatively narrow limits are passed the practical
infinite is approached, and the mere adding of a few more ciphers
after a numeral conveys no new idea.On the contrary, the piling up
of figures rather tends to weaken than to strengthen a statement,
for to many it suggests an idea of ridiculous exaggeration.Indeed,
when a few years ago a somewhat similar statement to that just made
was advanced in an official report, a critic undertook to expose
the fallacy of it in the columns of a daily paper by referring to a
case within the writer's own observation in which a family of three
persons had been killed on their very first journey in a railroad
car.It is not, of course, necessary to waste time over such a
criticism as this.Railroad accidents continually take place, and
in consequence of them people are killed and injured, and of these
there may well be some who are then making their first journey by
rail; but in estimating the dangers of railroad traveling the much
larger number who are not killed or injured at all must likewise be
taken into consideration.Any person as he may be reading this page
in a railroad car may be killed or injured through some accident,
even while his eye is glancing over the figures which show how
infinitesimal his danger is; but the chances are none the less as a
million to one that any particular reader will go down to his grave
uninjured by any accident on the rail, unless it be occasioned by
his or her own carelessness.Admitting, therefore, that ill luck or hard fortune must fall to
the lot of certain unascertainable persons, yet the chances of
incurring that ill fortune are so small that they are not materially
increased by any amount of traveling which can be accomplished
within the limits of a human life.So far from exhausting a fair
average immunity from accident by constant traveling, the statistics
of Massachusetts during the last eight years would seem to indicate
that if any given person were born upon a railroad car, and remained
upon it traveling 500 miles a day all his life, he would, with
average good fortune, be somewhat over 80 years of age before he
would be involved in any accident resulting in his death or personal
injury, while he would attain the highly respectable age of 930
years before being killed.Even supposing that the most exceptional
average of the Revere year became usual, a man who was killed by
an accident at 70 years of age should, unless he were fairly to be
accounted unlucky, have accomplished a journey of some 440 miles
every day of his life, Sundays included, from the time of his birth
to that of his death; while even to have brought him within the
fair liability of any injury at all, his daily journey should have
been some 120 miles.Under the conditions of the last eight years
his average daily journey through the three score years and ten to
entitle him to be killed in an accident at the end of them would be
about 600 miles.THE RAILROAD DEATH RATE.In connection with the statistics of railroad casualties it is not
without interest to examine the general vital statistics of some
considerable city, for they show clearly enough what a large degree
of literal truth there was in the half jocose proposition attributed
to John Bright, that the safest place in which a man could put
himself was inside a first-class railroad carriage of a train in
full motion.Take the statistics of Boston, for instance, for the
year 1878.During the four years 1875-8, it will be remembered, a
single passenger only was killed on the railroads of Massachusetts
in consequence of an accident to which he by his own carelessness
in no way contributed.[27] The average number of persons annually
injured, not fatally, during those years was about five.[27] This period did not include the Wollaston disaster, as the
  Massachusetts railroad year closes on the last day of September.The
  Wollaston disaster occurred on the 8th of October, 1878, and was
  accordingly included in the next railroad year.Yet during the year 1878, excluding all cases of mere injury of
which no account was made, no less than 53 persons came to their
deaths in Boston from falling down stairs, and 37 more from falling
out of windows; seven were scalded to death in 1878 alone.In the
year 1874 seventeen were killed by being run over by teams in
the streets, while the pastime of coasting was carried on at a
cost of ten lives more.During the five years 1874-8 there were
more persons murdered in the city of Boston alone than lost their
lives as passengers through the negligence of all the railroad
corporations in the whole state of Massachusetts during the nine
years 1871-8; though in those nine years were included both the
Revere and the Wollaston disasters, the former of which resulted
in the death of 29, and the latter of 21 persons.Neither are the
comparative results here stated in any respect novel or peculiar
to Massachusetts.Years ago it was officially announced in France
that people were less safe in their own houses than while traveling
on the railroads; and, in support of this somewhat startling
proposition, statistics were produced showing fourteen cases of
death of persons remaining at home and there falling over carpets,
or, in the case of females, having their garments catch fire, to ten
deaths on the rail.Even the game of cricket counted eight victims
to the railroad's ten.It will not, of course, be inferred that the cases of death or
injury to passengers from causes beyond their control include
by any means all the casualties involved in the operation of the
railroad system.On the contrary, they include but a very small
portion of them.The experience of the Massachusetts roads during
the seven years between September 30, 1871, and September 30,
1878, may again be cited in reference to this point.During that
time there were but 52 cases of injury to passengers from causes
over which they had no control, but in connection with the entire
working of the railroad system no less than 1,900 cases of injury
were reported, of which 1,008 were fatal; an average of 144 deaths a
year.Of these cases, naturally, a large proportion were employés,
whose occupation not only involves much necessary risk, but whose
familiarity with risk causes them always to incur it even in the
most unnecessary and foolhardy manner.During the seven years 293
of them were killed and 375 were reported as injured.Nor is it
supposed that the list included by any means all the cases of injury
which occurred.About one half of the accidents to employés are
occasioned by their falling from the trains when in motion, usually
from freight trains and in cold weather, and from being crushed
between cars while engaged in coupling them together.From this last
cause alone an average of 27 casualties are annually reported.One
fact, however, will sufficiently illustrate how very difficult it is
to protect this class of men from danger, or rather from themselves.As is well known, on freight trains they are obliged to ride on the
tops of the cars; but these are built so high that their roofs come
dangerously near the bottoms of the highway bridges, which cross
the track sometimes in close proximity to each other.Accordingly
many unfortunate brakemen were killed by being knocked off the
trains as they passed under these bridges.With a view to affording
the utmost possible protection against this form of accident, a
statute was passed by the Massachusetts legislature compelling the
corporations to erect guards at a suitable distance from every
overhead bridge which was less than eighteen feet in the clear
above the track.These guards were so arranged as to swing lightly
across the tops of the cars, giving any one standing upon them a
sharp rap, warning him of the danger he was in.This warning rap,
however, so annoyed the brakemen that the guards were on a number of
the roads systematically destroyed as often as they were put up; so
that at last another law had to be passed, making their destruction
a criminal offense.The brakemen themselves resisted the attempt
to divest their perilous occupation of one of its most insidious
dangers.In this respect, however, brakemen differ in no degree from the
rest of the community.On all hands railroad accidents seem to
be systematically encouraged, and the wonder is that the list of
casualties is not larger.In Massachusetts, for instance, even in
the most crowded portions of the largest cities and towns, not
only do the railroads cross the highways at grade, but whenever new
thoroughfares are laid out the people of the neighborhood almost
invariably insist upon their crossing the railroads at a grade
and not otherwise.Not but that, upon theory and in the abstract,
every one is opposed to grade-crossings; but those most directly
concerned always claim that their particular crossing is exceptional
in character.In vain do corporations protest and public officials
argue; when the concrete case arises all neighborhoods become alike
and strenuously insist on their right to incur everlasting danger
rather than to have the level of their street broken.During the
last seven years to September 30, 1878, 191 persons have been
injured, and 98 of them fatally injured, at these crossings in
Massachusetts, and it is certain as fate that the number is destined
to annually increase.What the result in a remote future will be, it
is not now easy to forecast.One thing only would seem certain: the
time will come when the two classes of traffic thus recklessly made
to cross each other will at many points have to be separated, no
matter at what cost to the community which now challenges the danger
it will then find itself compelled to avoid.The heaviest and most regular cause of death and injury involved
in the operation of the railroad system yet remains to be referred
to; and again it is recklessness which is at the root of it, and
this time recklessness in direct violation of law.The railroad
tracks are everywhere favorite promenades, and apparently even
resting-places, especially for those who are more or less drunk.In Great Britain physical demolition by a railroad train is also a
somewhat favorite method of committing suicide, and that, too, in
the most deliberate and cool-blooded manner.Cases have not been
uncommon in which persons have been seen to coolly lay themselves
down in front of an advancing train, and very neatly effect their
own decapitation by placing their necks across the rail.In England
alone, during the last seven years, there have been no less than 280
cases of death reported under the head of suicides, or an average
of 40 each year, the number in 1878 rising to 60.In America these
cases are not returned in a class by themselves.Under the general
head of accidents to trespassers, however, that is, accidents to
men, women and children, especially the latter, illegally lying,
walking, or playing on the tracks or riding upon the cars,--under
this head are regularly classified more than one third of all
the casualties incident to working the Massachusetts railroads.During the last seven years these have amounted to an aggregate
of 724 cases of injury, no less than 494 of which were fatal.Of
course, very many other cases of this description, which were not
fatal, were never reported.And here again the recklessness of the
public has received further illustration, and this time in a very
unpleasant way.Certain corporations operating roads terminating
in Boston endeavored at one time to diminish this slaughter by
enforcing the laws against walking on railroad tracks.A few
trespassers were arrested and fined, and then the resentment of
those whose wonted privileges were thus interfered with began to
make itself felt.Obstructions were found placed in the way of night
trains.The mere attempt to keep people from risking their lives
by getting in the way of locomotives placed whole trains full of
passengers in imminent jeopardy.Undoubtedly, however, by far the most effective means of keeping
railroad tracks from becoming foot-paths, and thus at once putting
an end to the largest item in the grand total of the expenditure
of life incident to the operation of railroads, is that secured
by the Pennsylvania railroad as an unintentional corollary to its
method of ballasting.That superb organization, every detail of
whose wonderful system is a fit subject for study to all interested
in the operation of railroads, has a roadway peculiar to itself.A principal feature in this is a surface of broken stone ballast,
covering not only the space between the rails, but also the interval
between the tracks as well as the road-bed on the outside of each
track for a distance of some three feet.It resembles nothing so
much as a newly macadamized highway.That, too, is its permanent
condition.To walk on the sharp and uneven edges of this broken
stone is possible, with a sufficient expenditure of patience and
shoe-leather; but certainly no human being would ever walk there
from preference, or if any other path could be found.Not only is
it in itself, as a system of ballasting, looked upon as better than
any other, but it confounds the tramp.Its systematic adoption in
crowded, suburban neighborhoods would, therefore, answer a double
purpose.It would secure to the corporations permanent road-beds
exclusively for their own use, and obviate the necessity of arrests
or futile threats to enforce the penalties of the law against
trespassers.It seems singular that this most obvious and effective
way of putting a stop to what is both a nuisance and a danger has
not yet been resorted to by men familiar with the use of spikes and
broken glass on the tops of fences and walls.Meanwhile, taken even in its largest aggregate, the loss of life
incident to the working of the railroad system is not excessive, nor
is it out of proportion to what might reasonably be expected.It is
to be constantly borne in mind, not only that the railroad performs
a great function in modern life, but that it also and of necessity
performs it in a very dangerous way.A practically irresistible
force crashing through the busy hive of modern civilization at a
wild rate of speed, going hither and thither, across highways and
by-ways and along a path which is in itself a thoroughfare,--such an
agency cannot be expected to work incessantly and yet never to come
in contact with the human frame.Naturally, however, it might be a
very car of Juggernaut.Is it so in fact?--To demonstrate that it
is not, it is but necessary again to recur to the comparison between
the statistics of railroad accidents and those which necessarily
occur in the experience of all considerable cities.Take again those
of Boston and of the railroad system of Massachusetts.These for the
purpose of illustration are as good as any, and in their results
would only be confirmed in the experience of Paris as compared with
the railroad system of France, or in that of London as compared with
the railroad system of Great Britain.During the eight years between
September 30, 1870, and September 30, 1878, the entire railroad
system of Massachusetts was operated at a cost of 1,165 lives, apart
from all cases of injury which did not prove fatal.The returns in
this respect also may be accepted as reasonably accurate, as the
deaths were all returned, though the cases of merely personal injury
probably were not.During the ten
years, 1868-78, 2,587 cases of death from accidental causes, or 259
a year, were recorded as having taken place in the city of Boston.In other words, the annual average of deaths by accident in the city
of Boston alone exceeds that consequent on running all the railroads
of the state by eighty per cent.Unless, therefore, the railroad
system is to be considered as an exception to all other functions of
modern life, and as such is to be expected to do its work without
injury to life or limb, this showing does not constitute a very
heavy indictment against it.AMERICAN AS COMPARED WITH FOREIGN RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.Up to this point, the statistics and experience of Massachusetts
only have been referred to.This is owing to the fact that the
railroad returns of that state are more carefully prepared and
tabulated than are those of any other state, and afford, therefore,
more satisfactory data from which to draw conclusions.The
territorial area from which the statistics are in this case derived
is very limited, and it yet remains to compare the results deduced
from them with those derived from the similar experience of other
communities.This, however, is not an easy thing to do; and, while
it is difficult enough as respects Europe, it is even more difficult
as respects America taken as a whole.This last fact is especially
unfortunate in view of the circumstance that, in regard to railway
accidents, the United States, whether deservedly or not, enjoy a
most undesirable reputation.Foreign authorities have a way of
referring to our "well-known national disregard of human life," with
a sort of complacency, at once patronizing and contemptuous, which
is the reverse of pleasing.Judging by the tone of their comments,
the natural inference would be that railroad disasters of the worst
description were in America matters of such frequent occurrence
as to excite scarcely any remark.As will presently be made very
apparent, this impression, for it is only an impression, can, so
far as the country as a whole is concerned, neither be proved nor
disproved, from the absence of sufficient data from which to argue.As respects Massachusetts, however, and the same statement may
perhaps be made of the whole belt of states north of the Potomac and
the Ohio, there is no basis for it.There is no reason to suppose
that railroad traveling is throughout that region accompanied by any
peculiar or unusual degree of danger.The great difficulty, just referred to, in comparing the results
deduced from equally complete statistics of different countries,
lies in the variety of the arbitrary rules under which the
computations in making them up are effected.As an example in
point, take the railroad returns of Great Britain and those of
Massachusetts.They are in each case prepared with a great deal
of care, and the results deduced from them may fairly be accepted
as approximately correct.As respects accidents, the number of
cases of death and of personal injury are annually reported, and
with tolerable completeness, though in the latter respect there is
probably in both cases room for improvement.The whole comparison
turns, however, on the way in which the entire number of passengers
annually carried is computed.In Great Britain, for instance, in
1878, these were returned, using round numbers only, at 565,000,000,
and in Massachusetts at 34,000,000.By dividing these totals by
the number of cases of death and injury reported as occurring
to passengers from causes beyond their control, we shall arrive
apparently at a fair comparative showing as to the relative safety
of railroad traveling in the two communities.The result for that
particular year would have been that while in Great Britain one
passenger in each 23,500,000 was killed, and one in each 481,600
injured from causes beyond their control, in Massachusetts none
were killed and only one in each 14,000,000 was in any way injured.Unfortunately, however, a closer examination reveals a very great
error in the computation, affecting every comparative result drawn
from it.In the English returns no allowance whatever is made
for the very large number of journeys made by season-ticket or
commutation passengers, while in Massachusetts, on the contrary,
each person of this class enters into the grand total as making two
trips each day, 156 trips on each quarterly ticket, and 626 trips on
each annual.Now in 1878 more than 418,000 holders of season tickets
were returned by the railway companies of Great Britain.How many
of these were quarterly and how many were annual travelers, does not
appear.If they were all annual travelers, no less than 261,000,000
journeys should be added to the 565,000,000 in the returns, in order
to arrive at an equal basis for a comparison between the foreign
and the American roads: this method, however, would be manifestly
inaccurate, so it only remains, in the absence of all reliable data,
and for the purpose of comparison solely, to strike out from the
Massachusetts returns the 8,320,727 season-ticket passages, which at
once reduces by over 3,000,000 the number of journeys to each case
of injury.As season-ticket passengers do travel and are exposed to
danger in the same degree as trip-ticket passengers, no result is
approximately accurate which leaves them out of the computation.At
present, however, the question relates not to the positive danger or
safety of traveling by rail, but to its relative danger in different
communities.Allowance for this discrepancy can, however, be made by adding to
the English official results an additional nineteen per cent., that,
according to the returns of 1877 and 1878, being the proportion
of the season-ticket to other passengers on the roads of Great
Britain.Taking then the Board of Trade returns for the eight
years 1870-7, it will be found that during this period about one
passenger in each 14,500,000 carried in that country has been killed
in railroad accidents, and about one in each 436,000 injured.This may be assumed as a fair average for purpose of comparison,
though it ought to be said that in Great Britain the percentage of
casualties to passengers shows a decided tendency to decrease, and
during the years 1877-8 the percentages of killed fell from one in
15,000,000 to one in 38,000,000 and those of injured from one in
436,000 to one in 766,000.The aggregates from which these results
are deduced are so enormous, rising into the thousands of millions,
that a certain degree of reliance can be placed on them.In the
case of Massachusetts, however, the entire period during which the
statistics are entitled to the slightest weight includes only eight
years, 1872-9, and offers an aggregate of but 274,000,000 journeys,
or but about forty per cent.of those included in the British
returns of the single year 1878.During these years the killed in
Massachusetts were one in each 13,000,000 and the injured one in
each 1,230,000;--or, while the killed in the two cases were very
nearly in the same proportion,--respectively one in 14.5, and one in
13, speaking in millions,--the British injured were really three to
one of the Massachusetts.The equality as respects the killed in this comparison, and the
marked discrepancy as respects the injured is calculated at first
sight to throw doubts on the fullness of the Massachusetts returns.There seems no good reason why the injured should in the one case
be so much more numerous than in the other.This, however, is
susceptible on closer examination of a very simple and satisfactory
explanation.In case of accident the danger of sustaining slight
personal injury is not so great in Massachusetts as in Great
Britain.This is due to the heavier and more solid construction
of the American passenger coaches, and their different interior
arrangement.This fact, and the real cause of the large number of
slightly injured,--"shaken" they call it,--in the English railroad
accidents is made very apparent in the following extract from Mr.Calcroft's report for 1877;--

     "It is no doubt a fact that collisions and other accidents to
     railway trains are attended with less serious consequences
     in proportion to the solidity of construction of passenger
     carriages.The accomodation and internal arrangements of
     third-class carriages, however, especially those used in
     ordinary trains, are defective as regards safety and comfort,
     as compared with many carriages of the same class on foreign
     railways.The first-class passenger, except when thrown against
     his opposite companion, or when some luggage falls upon him, is
     generally saved from severe contusion by the well-stuffed or
     padded linings of the carriages; whilst the second-class and
     third-class passenger is generally thrown with violence against
     the hard wood-work.If the second and third-class carriages
     had a high padded back lining, extending above the head of the
     passenger, it would probably tend to lesson the danger to life
     and limb which, as the returns of accidents show, passengers
     in carriages of this class are much exposed to in train
     accidents."[28]

 [28] _General Report to the Board of Trade upon the accidents which
  have occurred on the Railways of the United Kingdom during the year
  1877, p.37._

In 1878 the passenger journeys made in the second and third class
carriages of the United Kingdom were thirteen to one of those made
in first class carriages;--or, expressed in millions, there were
but 41 of the latter to 523 of the former.There can be very little
question indeed that if, during the last ten years, thirteen out
of fourteen of the passengers on Massachusetts railroads had been
carried in narrow compartments with wooden seats and unlined sides
the number of those returned as slightly injured in the numerous
accidents which occurred would have been at least three-fold larger
than it was.If it had not been ten-fold larger it would have been
surprising.The foregoing comparison, relates however, simply to passengers
killed in accidents for which they are in no degree responsible.When, however, the question reverts to the general cost in life
and limb at which the railroad systems are worked and the railroad
traffic is carried on to the entire communities served, the
comparison is less favorable to Massachusetts.Taking the eight
years of 1871-8, the British returns include 30,641 cases of injury,
and 9,113 of death; while those of Massachusetts for the same
years included 1,165 deaths, with only 1,044 cases of injury; in
the one case a total of 39,745 casualties, as compared with 2,209
the other.It will, however be noticed that while in the British
returns the cases of injury are nearly three-fold those of death, in
the Massachusetts returns the deaths exceed the cases of injury.This fact in the present case cannot but throw grave suspicion
on the completeness of the Massachusetts returns.As a matter of
practical experience it is well known that cases of injury almost
invariably exceed those of death, and the returns in which the
disproportion is greatest, if no sufficient explanation presents
itself, are probably the most full and reliable.Taking, therefore,
the deaths in the two cases as the better basis for comparison, it
will be found that the roads of Great Britain in the grand result
accomplished seventeen-fold the work of those of Massachusetts with
less than eight times as many casualties; had the proportion between
the results accomplished and the fatal injuries inflicted been
maintained, but 536 deaths instead of 1,165 would have appeared in
the Massachusetts returns.The reason of this difference in result
is worth looking for, and fortunately the statistical tables are
in both cases carried sufficiently into detail to make an analysis
possible; and this analysis, when made, seems to indicate very
clearly that while, for those directly connected with the railroads,
either as passengers or as employés, the Massachusetts system
in its working involves relatively a less degree of danger than
that of Great Britain, yet for the outside community it involves
very much more.Take, for instance, the two heads of accidents
at grade-crossings and accidents to trespassers, which have been
already referred to.In Great Britain highway grade-crossings
are discouraged.The results of the policy pursued may in each case be read
with sufficient distinctness in the bills of mortality.During the
years 1872-7, of 1,929 casualties to persons on the railroads of
Massachusetts, no less than 200 occurred at highway grade crossings.Had the accidents of this description in Great Britain been equally
numerous in proportion to the larger volume of the traffic of that
country, they would have resulted in over 3,000 cases of death or
personal injury; they did in fact result in 586 such cases.In
Massachusetts, again, to walk at will on any part of a railroad
track is looked upon as a sort of prescriptive and inalienable
right of every member of the community, irrespective of age, sex,
color, or previous condition of servitude.Accordingly, during the
six years referred to, this right was exercised at the cost of life
or limb to 591 persons,--one in four of all the casualties which
occurred in connection with the railroad system.In Great Britain
the custom of using the tracks of railroads as a foot-path seems to
exist, but, so far from being regarded as a right, it is practiced
in perpetual terror of the law.Accordingly, instead of some 9,000
cases of death or injury from this cause during these six years,
which would have been the proportion under like conditions in
Massachusetts, the returns showed only 2,379.These two are among
the most constant and fruitful causes of accident in connection with
the railroad system of America.In great Britain their proportion
to the whole number of casualties which take place is scarcely a
seventh part of what it is in Massachusetts.Here they constitute
very nearly fifty per cent.of all the accidents which occur; there
they constitute but a little over seven.There is in this comparison
a good deal of solid food for legislative thought, if American
legislators would but take it in; for this is one matter the public
policy in regard to which can only be fixed by law.When we pass from Great Britain to the continental countries of
Europe, the difficulties in the way of any fair comparison of
results become greater and greater.The statistics do not enter
sufficiently into detail, nor is the basis of computation apparent.It is generally conceded that, where a due degree of caution is
exercised by the passenger, railroad traveling in continental
countries is attended with a much less degree of danger than in
England.When we come to the returns, they hardly bear out this
conclusion; at least to the degree commonly supposed.Nowhere is human life more carefully guarded than in
that country; yet their returns show that of 866,000,000 passengers
transported on the French railroads during the eleven years 1859-69,
no less than 65 were killed and 1,285 injured from causes beyond
their control; or one in each 13,000,000 killed as compared with one
in 10,700,000 in Great Britain; and one in every 674,000 injured
as compared with one in each 330,000 in the other country.During
the single year 1859, about 111,000,000 passengers were carried
on the French lines, at a general cost to the community of 2,416
casualties, of which 295 were fatal.In Massachusetts, during the
four years 1871-74, about 95,000,000 passengers were carried, at
a reported cost of 1,158 casualties.This showing might well be
considered favorable to Massachusetts did not the single fact that
her returns included more than twice as many deaths as the French,
with only a quarter as many injuries, make it at once apparent that
the statistics were at fault.Under these circumstances comparison
could only be made between the numbers of deaths reported; which
would indicate that, in proportion to the work done, the railroad
operations of Massachusetts involved about twice and a half more
cases of injury to life and limb than those of the French service.As respects Great Britain the comparison is much more favorable, the
returns showing an almost exactly equal general death-rate in the
two countries in proportion to their volumes of traffic; the volume
of Great Britain being about four times that of France, while its
death-rate by railroad accidents was as 1,100 to 295.With the exception of Belgium, however, in which country the
returns cover only the lines operated by the state, the basis
hardly exists for a useful comparison between the dangers of injury
from accident on the continental railroads and on those of Great
Britain and America.The several systems are operated on wholly
different principles, to meet the needs of communities between
whose modes of life and thought little similarity exists.The
continental trains are far less crowded than either the English or
the American, and, when accidents occur, fewer persons are involved
in them.The movement, also, goes on under much stricter regulation
and at lower rates of speed, so that there is a grain of truth in
the English sarcasm that on a German railway "it almost seems as
if beer-drinking at the stations were the principal business, and
traveling a mere accessory."Limiting, therefore, the comparison to the railroads of Great
Britain, it remains to be seen whether the evil reputation of the
American roads as respects accidents is wholly deserved.Is it
indeed true that the danger to a passenger's life and limbs is so
much greater in this country than elsewhere?--Locally, and so far
as Massachusetts at least is concerned, it certainly is not.How
is it with the country taken as a whole?--The lack of all reliable
statistics as respects this wide field of inquiry has already been
referred to.We do not know with
accuracy even the number of miles of road operated; much less the
number of passengers annually carried.As respects accidents, and
the deaths and injuries resulting therefrom, some information may be
gathered from a careful and very valuable, because the only record
which has been preserved during the last six years in the columns of
the _Railroad Gazette_.It makes, of course, no pretence at either
official accuracy or fullness, but it is as complete probably as
circumstances will permit of its being made.During the five years
1874-8 there have been included in this record 4,846 accidents,
resulting in 1,160 deaths and 4,650 cases of injury;--being an
average of 969 accidents a year, resulting in 232 deaths and 930
cases of injury.These it will be remembered are casualties directly
resulting either to passengers or employés from train accidents.No account is taken of injuries sustained by employés in the
ordinary operation of the roads, or by members of the community
not passengers.In Massachusetts the accidents to passengers and
employés constitute one-half of the whole, but a very small portion
of the injuries reported as sustained by either passengers or
employés are the consequence of train accidents,--not one in three
in the case of passengers or one in seven in that of employés.In
fact, of the 2,350 accidents to persons reported in Massachusetts
in the nine years 1870-8, but 271, or less than twelve per cent.,
belonged to the class alone included in the reports of the _Railroad
Gazette_.In England during the four years 1874-7 the proportion
was larger, being about twenty-five instead of twelve per cent.For
America at large the Massachusetts proportion is undoubtedly the
most nearly correct, and the probabilities would seem to be that
the annual average of injuries to persons incident to operating the
railroads of the United States is not less than 10,000, of which at
least 1,200 are due to train accidents.Of these about two-thirds
may be set down as sustained by passengers, or, approximately, 800 a
year.It remains to be ascertained what proportion this number bears to
the whole number carried.There are no reliable statistics on this
head any more than on the other.Nothing but an approximation of
the most general character is possible.The number of passengers
annually carried on the roads of a few of the states is reported
with more or less accuracy, and averaging these the result would
seem to indicate that there are certainly not more than 350,000,000
passengers annually carried on the roads of all the states.There
is something barbarous about such an approximation, and it is
disgraceful that at this late day we should in America be forced
to estimate the passenger movement on our railroads in much the
same way that we guess at the population of Africa.We are in this respect far in the rear of civilized
communities.Taking, however, 350,000,000 as a fair approximation
to our present annual passenger movement, it will be observed that
it is as nearly as may be half that of Great Britain.In Great
Britain, in 1878, there were 1,200 injuries to passengers from
accidents to trains, and 675 in 1877.The average of the last eight
years has been 1,226.If, therefore, the approximation of 800 a
year for America is at all near the truth, the percentage would seem
to be considerably larger than that arrived at from the statistics
of Great Britain.Meanwhile it is to be noted that while in Great
Britain about 25 cases of injury are reported to each one of death,
in America but four cases are reported to each death--a discrepancy
which is extremely suggestive.Perhaps, however, the most valuable
conclusion to be drawn from these figures is that in America we as
yet are absolutely without any reliable railroad statistics on this
subject at all.Taken as a whole, however, and under the most favorable showing,
it would seem to be a matter of fair inference that the dangers
incident to railroad traveling are materially greater in the United
States than in any country of Europe.How much greater is a question
wholly impossible to answer.So that when a statistical writer
undertakes to show, as one eminent European authority has done, that
in a given year on the American roads one passenger in every 286,179
was killed, and one in every 90,737 was injured, it is charitable
to suppose that in regard to America only is he indebted to his
imagination for his figures.Neither is it possible to analyze with any satisfactory degree of
precision the nature of the accidents in the two countries, with
a view to drawing inferences from them.Without attempting to do
so it maybe said that the English Board of Trade reports for the
last five years, 1874-8, include inquiries into 755 out of 11,585
accidents, the total number of every description reported as having
taken place.Meanwhile the _Railroad Gazette_ contains mention of
4,846 reported train accidents which occurred in America during
the same five years.Of these accidents, 1,310 in America and 81
in Great Britain were due to causes which were either unexplained
or of a miscellaneous character, or are not common to the systems
of the two countries.In so far as the remainder admitted of
classification, it was somewhat as follows:--

  [29] During these five years there were in Great Britain four cases
  of collision between locomotives or trains at level crossings of one
  railroad by another; in America there were 79.The probable cause of
  this discrepancy has already been referred to (_ante pp.The above record, though almost valueless for any purpose of exact
comparison, reveals, it will be noticed, one salient fact.Out of
755 English accidents, no less than 406 came under the head of
collisions--whether head collisions, rear collisions, or collisions
on sidings or at junctions.In other words, to collisions of some
sort between trains were due considerably more than half (54 per
cent.)of the accidents which took place in Great Britain, while
only 88, or less than 13 per cent.of the whole, were due to
derailments from all causes.In America on the other hand, while
of the 3,763 accidents recorded, 1,324, or but one-third part (35
per cent.)were due to collisions, no less than 586, or 24 per
cent., were classed under the head of derailments, due to defects
in the permanent way.During the the six years 1873-8 there were
in all 1698 cases of collision of every description between trains
reported as occurring in America to 1495 in the United Kingdom; but
while in America the derailments amounted to no less than 4016, or
more than twice the collisions, in the United Kingdom they were
but 817, or a little more than half their number.It has already
been noticed that the most disastrous accidents in America are apt
to occur on bridges, and Ashtabula and Tariffville at once suggest
themselves.Under the heading
of "Failures of Tunnels, Bridges, Viaducts or Culverts," there
were returned in that country during the six years 1873-8 only 29
accidents in all; while during the same time in America, under the
heads of broken bridges or tressels and open draws, the _Gazette_
recorded no less than 165.These figures curiously illustrate the
different manner in which the railroads of the two countries have
been constructed, and the different circumstances under which they
are operated.The English collisions are distinctly traceable to
constant overcrowding; the American derailments and bridge accidents
to inferior construction of our road-beds.Finally, what of late years has been done to diminish the dangers
of the rail?--What more can be done?--Few persons realize what a
tremendous pressure in this respect is constantly bearing down upon
those whose business it is to operate railroads.A great accident is
not only a terrible blow to the pride and prestige of a corporation,
not only does it practically ruin the unfortunate officials involved
in it, but it entails also portentous financial consequences.Juries
proverbially have little mercy for railroad corporations, and, when
a disaster comes, these have practically no choice but to follow the
scriptural injunction to settle with their adversaries quickly.The
Revere catastrophe, for instance, cost the railroad company liable
on account of it over half a million of dollars; the Ashtabula
accident over $600,000; the Wollaston over $300,000.A few years ago
in England a jury awarded a sum of $65,000 for damages sustained
through the death of a single individual.During the five years,
1867-71, the railroad corporations of Great Britain paid out over
$11,000,000 in compensation for damages occasioned by accidents.In
view, merely, of such money consequences of disaster, it would be
most unnatural did not each new accident lead to the adoption of
better appliances to prevent its recurrence.[30]

  [30] The other side of this proposition has been argued with
  much force by Mr.William Galt in his report as one of the Royal
  Commission of 1874 on Railway Accidents.Galt's individual
  report bears date February 5, 1877, and in it he asserts that, as
  a matter of actual experience, the principle of self-interest on
  the part of the railway companies has proved a wholly insufficient
  safeguard against accidents.However it may be in theory, he
  contends that, taking into consideration the great cost of the
  appliances necessary to insure safety to the public on the one side,
  and the amount of damages incident to a certain degree of risk on
  the other side, the possible saving in expenditure to the companies
  by assuming the risk far exceeds the loss incurred by an occasional
  accident.The companies become, in a word, insurers of their
  passengers,--the premium being found in the economies effected by
  not adopting improved appliances of recognized value, and the losses
  being the damages incurred in case of accident.He treats the whole
  subject at great length and with much knowledge and ability.His
  report is a most valuable compendium for those who are in favor of a
  closer government supervision over railroads as a means of securing
  an increased safety from accident.To return, however, to the subject of railroad accidents, and the
final conclusion to be drawn from the statistics which have been
presented.That conclusion briefly stated is that the charges of
recklessness and indifference so generally and so widely advanced
against those managing the railroads cannot for an instant be
sustained.After all, as was said in the beginning of the present
volume, it is not the danger but the safety of the railroad which
should excite our special wonder.If any one doubts this, it is
very easy to satisfy himself of the fact,--that is, if by nature
he is gifted with the slightest spark of imagination.It is but
necessary to stand once on the platform of a way-station and to
look at an express train dashing by.There are few sights finer;
few better calculated to quicken the pulse.The glare of the head-light, the rush and throb of the
locomotive,--the connecting rod and driving-wheels of which seem
instinct with nervous life,--the flashing lamps in the cars, and
the final whirl of dust in which the red tail-lights vanish almost
as soon as they are seen,--all this is well calculated to excite
our admiration; but the special and unending cause for wonder is
how, in case of accident, anything whatever is left of the train.As it plunges into the darkness it would seem to be inevitable
that something must happen, and that, whatever happens, it must
necessarily involve both the train and every one in it in utter
and irremediable destruction.Here is a body weighing in the
neighborhood of two hundred tons, moving over the face of the earth
at a speed of sixty feet a second and held to its course only by two
slender lines of iron rails;--and yet it is safe!--We have seen how
when, half a century ago, the possibility of something remotely like
this was first discussed, a writer in the _British Quarterly_ earned
for himself a lasting fame by using the expression that "We should
as soon expect people to suffer themselves to be fired off upon
one of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as to trust themselves to the
mercy of such a machine, going at such a rate;"--while Lord Brougham
exclaimed that "the folly of seven hundred people going fifteen
miles an hour, in six trains, exceeds belief."At the time they
wrote, the chances were ninety-nine in a hundred that both reviewer
and correspondent were right; and yet, because reality, not for the
first nor the last time, saw fit to outstrip the wildest flights of
imagination, the former at least blundered, by being prudent, into
an immortality of ridicule.The thing, however, is still none the
less a miracle because it is with us matter of daily observation.That, indeed, is the most miraculous part of it.At all hours of the
day and of the night, during every season of the year, this movement
is going on.It depends for its even action
on every conceivable contingency, from the disciplined vigilance
of thousands of employés to the condition of the atmosphere, the
heat of an axle, or the strength of a nail.The vast machine is in
constant motion, and the derangement of a single one of a myriad of
conditions may at any moment occasion one of those inequalities of
movement which are known as accidents.Yet at the end of the year,
of the hundreds of millions of passengers fewer have lost their
lives through these accidents than have been murdered in cold blood.Not without reason, therefore, has it been asserted that, viewing
at once the speed, the certainty, and the safety with which the
intricate movement of modern life is carried on, there is no more
creditable monument to human care, human skill, and human foresight
than the statistics of railroad accidents.Abergele, accident at, 72.Accidents, railroad, about stations, 166.

Transcriber's note: The following has been moved from the beginning
of the book to the end.=By the same Author.=


=Railroads and Railroad Questions.= 12mo, cloth, $1 25.The volume
treats of "The Genesis of the Railroad System," "Accidents," and
the "Present Railroad Problem."The author has made himself the
acknowledged authority on this group of subjects.If his book goes
only to those who are interested in the ownership, the use, or the
administration of railroads, it is sure of a large circle of readers.--_Railway World._

"Characterized by broad, progressive, liberal ideas."--_Railway
Review._

"The entire conclusions are of great value."--_N.Y.One day shortly thereafter a woman knocked timidly at her door.Carmen
saw the caller and fled into her arms.The woman had come to return the string of pearls which the girl had
thrust into her hands on the night of the Charity Ball.She had not been able to bring herself to sell them.She
had wanted--oh, she knew not what, excepting that she wanted to see
again the girl whose image had haunted her since that eventful night
when the strange child had wandered into her abandoned life.Yes, she
would have given her testimony as to Carmen; but who would have
believed her, a prostitute?And--but the radiant girl gathered her in
her arms and would not let her go without a promise to return.And each time there was a change in
her.The Beaubien always forced upon her a little money and a promise
to come back.It developed that Jude was cooking in a cheap down-town
restaurant."Why not for us, mother, if she will?"And, though the sin-stained woman demurred and protested her
unworthiness, yet the love that knew no evil drew her irresistibly,
and she yielded at length, with her heart bursting.Then, in her great joy, Carmen's glad cry echoed through the little
house: "Oh, mother dear, we're free, we're free!"But the Beaubien was not free.Night after night her sleepless pillow
was wet with bitter tears of remorse, when the accusing angel stood
before her and relentlessly revealed each act of shameful meanness, of
cruel selfishness, of sordid immorality in her wasted life.And,
lastly, the weight of her awful guilt in bringing about the
destruction of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles lay upon her soul like a mountain.Oh, if she had only foreseen even a little of it!Oh, that Carmen had
come to her before--or not at all!And yet she could not wish that she
had never known the girl.The day of judgment was bound
to come.And, but for the comforting presence of
that sweet child, she had long since become a raving maniac.It was
Carmen who, in those first long nights of gnawing, corroding remorse,
wound her soft arms about the Beaubien's neck, as she lay tossing in
mental agony on her bed, and whispered the assurances of that infinite
Love which said, "Behold, I make all things new!"It was Carmen who
whispered to her of the everlasting arms beneath, and of the mercy
reflected by him who, though on the cross, forgave mankind because of
their pitiable ignorance.It is ignorance, always ignorance of what
constitutes real good, that makes men seek it through wrong channels.The Beaubien had sought good--all the world does--but she had never
known that God alone is good, and that men cannot find it until they
reflect Him.And so she had "missed the mark."Oh, sinful, mesmerized
world, ye shall find Me--the true good--only when ye seek Me with all
your heart!And yet, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins."Only a God who is love could voice such a promise!And Carmen knew;
and she hourly poured her great understanding of love into the empty
heart of the stricken Beaubien.Then at last came days of quiet, and planning for the future.The
Beaubien would live--yes, but not for herself.Nay, that life had gone
out forever, nor would mention of it pass her lips again.The
Colombian revolution--her mendacious connivances with Ames--her
sinful, impenitent life of gilded vice--aye, the door was now closed
against that, absolutely and forever more.She had passed through the
throes of a new birth; she had risen again from the bed of anguish;
but she rose stripped of her worldly strength.Carmen was now the
staff upon which she leaned.And Carmen--what had been her thought when foul calumny laid its sooty
touch upon her?What had been the working of her mind when that world
which she had sought to illumine with the light of her own purity had
cast her out?When the blow fell the portals of her mind closed at once against
every accusing thought, against every insidious suggestion of defeat,
of loss, of dishonor.The arrows of malice, as well as those of
self-pity and condemnation, snapped and fell, one by one, as they
hurtled vainly against the whole armor of God wherewith the girl stood
clad.Self sank into service; and she gathered the bewildered,
suffering Beaubien into her arms as if she had been a child.She would
have gone to Ames, too, had she been permitted--not to plead for
mercy, but to offer the tender consolation and support which, despite
the havoc he was committing, she knew he needed even more than the
Beaubien herself."Paul had been a murderer," she often said, as she sat in the darkness
alone with the suffering woman and held her trembling hand."But he
became the chief of apostles.When the light came, he
shut the door against the past.If he hadn't, dearest, he never could
have done what he did.Ames, will have to do the
same."And this the Beaubien could do, and did, after months of
soul-racking struggle.But Ames sat in spiritual darkness, whipped by
the foul brood of lust and revenge, knowing not that the mountainous
wrath which he hourly heaped higher would some day fall, and bury him
fathoms deep.Throughout the crisis Father Waite had stood by them stanchly."I've just longed for some reasonable
excuse to become a social outcast," the latter had said, as she was
helping Carmen one day to pack her effects prior to removing from the
Hawley-Crowles mansion."I long for a hearthstone to which I can
attach myself--"

"Then attach yourself to ours!""For I know that now you are really
going to live--and I want to live as you will.Moreover--" She paused
and smiled queerly at the girl--"I am quite in love with your hero,
Father Waite, you know."Harris, too, made a brief call before departing again for Denver."I've got to hustle for a living now," he explained, "and it's me for
the mountains once more!New York is no place for such a tender lamb
as I. Oh, I've been well trimmed--but I know enough now to keep away
from this burg!"While he was yet speaking there came a loud ring at the front door of
the little bungalow, followed immediately by the entrance of the
manager of a down-town vaudeville house.He plunged at once into his
errand.He would offer Carmen one hundred dollars a week, and a
contract for six months, to appear twice daily in his theater.but she did put it over
the society ginks."And the Beaubien, shivering at the awful
proposal, was glad Harris was there to lead the zealous theatrical man
firmly to the door.Lastly, came one Amos A. Hitt, gratuitously, to introduce himself as
one who knew Cartagena and was likely to return there in the not
distant future, where he would be glad to do what he might to remove
the stain which had been laid upon the name of the fair girl.The
genuineness of the man stood out so prominently that the Beaubien took
him at once into her house, where he was made acquainted with Carmen."Oh," cried the girl, "Cartagena!Why, I wonder--do you know Padre
Jose de Rincon?""A priest who once taught there in the University, many years ago?And
who was sent up the river, to Simiti?Then Carmen fell upon his neck; and there in that moment was begun a
friendship that grew daily stronger, and in time bore richest fruit.It soon became known that Hitt was giving a course of lectures that
fall in the University, covering the results of his archaeological
explorations; so Carmen and Father Waite went often to hear him.And
the long breaths of University atmosphere which the girl inhaled
stimulated a desire for more.Besides, Father Waite had some time
before announced his determination to study there that winter, as long
as his meager funds would permit."I shall take up law," he had one day said."It will open to me the
door of the political arena, where there is such great need of real
men, men who stand for human progress, patriotism, and morality.I
shall seek office--not for itself, but for the good I can do, and the
help I can be in a practical way to my fellow-men.Carmen shared the inspiration; and so she, too, with the Beaubien's
permission, applied for admittance to the great halls of learning, and
was accepted.*       *       *       *       *

"And now," began Father Waite that evening, when Hitt and his friend
had come, and, to the glad surprise of Carmen, Elizabeth Wall had
driven up in her car to take the girl for a ride, but had yielded to
the urgent invitation to join the little conference, "my plan, in
which I invite you to join, is, briefly, _to study this girl_!"Carmen's eyes opened wide, and her face portrayed blank amazement, as
Father Waite stood pointing gravely to her.Nor were the others less
astonished--all but the Beaubien."Let me explain," Father Waite continued."We are assembled here
to-night as representatives, now or formerly, of very diversified
lines of human thought.I have stood as the
embodiment of Christly claims, as the active agent of one of the
mightiest of human institutions, the ancient Christian Church.For
years I have studied its accepted authorities and its all-inclusive
assumptions, which embrace heaven, earth, and hell.For years I sought
with sincere consecration to apply its precepts to the dire needs of
humanity.I have traced its origin in the dim twilight of the
Christian era and its progress down through the centuries, through
heavy vicissitudes to absolute supremacy, on down through schisms and
subsequent decline, to the present hour, when the great system seems
to be gathering its forces for a life and death stand in this, the New
World.I have known and associated with its dignitaries and its humble
priests.I know the policies and motives underlying its quiet
movements.And so I
withdrew from it my allegiance."Carmen's thought, as she listened, was busy with another whose
experience had not been dissimilar, but about whom the human coils had
been too tightly wound to be so easily broken.Hitt," Father Waite went on, "represented
the great protest against the abuses and corruption which permeated
the system for which I stood.He, like myself, embodied the eternal
warfare of the true believer against the heretic.Yet, without my
churchly system, I was taught to believe, he and those who share his
thought are damned.we both claimed the same
divine Father, and accepted the Christly definition of Him as Love.We
were two brothers of the same great family, yet calling each other
_anathema_!""And to-day," he continued, "we
brothers are humbly meeting on the common ground of failure--failure
to understand the Christ, and to meet the needs of our fellow-men with
our elaborate systems of theology.""I heard another priest, years ago, make a similar confession," said
Hitt reflectively."I would he were here to-night!""He is here, in spirit," replied Father Waite; "for the same spirit of
eager inquiry and humble desire for truth that animates us no doubt
moved him.I have reason to think so," he added, looking at Carmen."For this girl's spiritual development I believe to be very largely
his work."He knew but little as yet of her
past association with the priest Jose.Hitt, represented the greatest systems of so-called
Christian belief," pursued Father Waite."Madam Beaubien, on the other
hand, has represented the world that waits, as yet vainly, for
redemption.We have not been able to afford it her.Yet--pardon my
frankness in thus referring to you, Madam.It is only to benefit us
all--that the means of redemption _have_ been brought to her, we must
now admit."She started to speak, but Father
Waite raised a detaining hand."Miss Wall
represents the weariness of spirit and unrest abroad in the world
to-day, the spirit that finds life not worth the while; and Mr.Haynerd voices the cynical disbelief, the agnosticism, of that great
class who can not accept the childish tenets of our dogmatic systems
of theology, yet who have nothing but the philosophy of stoicism or
epicureanism to offer in substitute.""You have me correctly classified," he said."I'm a Yankee, and from Missouri.""And now, having placed us," said the Beaubien, "how will you classify
Carmen?"Father Waite looked at the girl reverently."Hers is the leaven," he
replied gently, "which has leavened the whole lump."My good friends," he went on earnestly, "like all priests and
preachers, I have been but a helpless spectator of humanity's
troubles.I have longed and prayed to know how to do the works which
Jesus is said to have done; yet, at the sick-bed or the couch of
death, what could I do--I, to whom the apostolic virtue is supposed to
have descended in the long line of succession?I could give promises of
remitted sins--though I knew I spoke not truth.I could comfort by
voicing the insipid views of our orthodox heaven.And yet I know that
what I gave was but mental nostrums, narcotics, to stupify until death
might end the suffering."And if you were a good orthodox priest," interposed Haynerd, "you
would refuse burial to dissenters, and bar from your communion table
all who were not of your faith, eh?""I would have to, were I consistent; for Catholicism is
the only true faith, founded upon the revealed word of God, you know."He smiled pathetically as he looked around at the little group."Now," he continued, "you, Mr.Haynerd, are a man of the world.You
are not in sympathy with the Church.You are an infidel, an
unbeliever.And therefore are you '_anathema_,' you know.""But you can not deny that at times you think very
seriously.And, I may go farther: you long, intensely, for something
that the world does not offer.Now, what is it but truth that you are
seeking?""I want to know," answered Haynerd quickly.I
am fond of exhibitions of sleight-of-hand and jugglery.But the
priestly thaumaturgy that claims to transform a biscuit into the
flesh of a man dead some two thousand years, and a bit of grape juice
into his blood, irritates me inexpressibly!And so does the
jugglery by which your Protestant fellows, Hitt, attempt to reconcile
their opposite beliefs.Why, what difference can it possibly make
to the Almighty whether we miserable little beings down here are
baptised with water, milk, or kerosene, or whether we are immersed,
sprinkled, or well soused?for nearly twenty centuries
you have been wandering among the non-essentials.Isn't it time to get
down to business, and instead of burning at the stake every one who
differs with you, try conscientiously to put into practice a few of
the simple moral precepts, such as the Golden Rule, and loving
one's neighbor as one's self?""There," commented Father Waite, "you have a bit of the world's
opinion of the Church!Can we say that the censure is not just?Would
not Christ himself to-day speak even more scathingly to those who
advocate a system of belief that puts blinders on men's minds, and
then leads them into the pit of ignorance and superstition?""Ye have taken away the key of knowledge," murmured Carmen; "ye
entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye
hindered."exclaimed Haynerd, looking at the girl who stood as a
living protest against all that hampers the expansion of the human
mind; that quenches its note of joy, and dulls its enlarging and ever
nobler concept of God."Now I want to know, first, if there is a God;
and, if so, what He is, and what His relation is to me.I want to know
what I am, and why I am here, and what future I may look forward to,
if any.I don't care two raps about a God who can't help me here on
earth, who can't set me right and make me happy--cure my ills, meet my
needs, and supply a few of the luxuries as well.And if there is a
God, and we can meet Him only by dying, then why in the name of common
sense all this hullabaloo about death?Why, in that case, death is the
grandest thing in life!But
you preacher fellows fight death tooth and nail.You're scared stiff
when you contemplate it.You make Christianity just a grand
preparation for death.Yet it isn't the gateway to life to you, and
you know it!Then why, if you are honest, do you tell such rubbish to
your trusting followers?""I would remind you," returned Hitt with a little laugh, "that I
don't, now.""Well, friends," interposed Father Waite, "it is to take up for
earnest consideration just such questions as Mr.Haynerd propounds,
that I have my suggestion to make, namely, that we meet together once
or twice a week, or as often as we may agree upon, to search for--"
his voice dropped to a whisper--"to search for God, and with this
young girl as our guide.For I believe she is very close to Him.The
world knows God only by hearsay.Carmen has _proved_ Him."Men ask why it is," he went on, "that God remains hidden from them;
why they can not understand Him.They forget that Jesus revealed God
as Love.And, if that is so, in order to know Him all mankind must
love their fellow-men.But they go right on hating one another,
cheating, abusing, robbing, slaying, persecuting, and still wondering
why they don't know God, regardless of the only possible way of ever
working out from the evils by which they are beset, if we believe that
Jesus told the truth, or was correctly reported."He paused and
reflected for a moment.Then:

"The ancient prophet said: 'Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye
shall search for me with all your hearts.'It is my proposal that we
bind ourselves together in such a search.To it we can bring diverse
talents.To our vast combined worldly experience, I bring knowledge of
the ancient Greek and Latin Fathers, together with Church history.Hitt brings his command of the Hebrew language and history, and an
intimate acquaintance with the ancient manuscripts, and Biblical
interpretation, together with a wide knowledge of the physical
sciences.Madam Beaubien, Miss Wall, and Mr.Haynerd contribute their
earnest, searching, inquisitive spirit, and a knowledge of the world's
needs.Moreover, we all come together without bias or prejudice.And
Carmen--she contributes that in which we have all been so woefully
lacking, and without which we can _never_ know God, the rarest,
deepest spirituality.Shall we
undertake the search, my friends?It means a study of her thought, and
the basis upon which it rests."The Beaubien raised her hand to her moist eyes.She was thinking of
that worldly coterie which formerly was wont to meet nightly in her
magnificent mansion to prey upon their fellows.Oh, how different the
spirit of this little gathering!"You will meet here, with me," she said in a broken voice.There were none there unacquainted with the sorrows of this penitent,
broken woman.Each rose in turn and clasped her hand.Carmen threw
her arms about her neck and kissed her repeatedly."You see," said the Beaubien, smiling up through her tears, "what this
child's religion is?Would the swinging of incense burners and the
mumbling of priestly formulae enhance it?""Jesus said, 'Having seen me ye have seen God,'" said Father Waite."And I say," replied the Beaubien, "that having seen this child, you
have indeed seen Him."CHAPTER 2


"I'm afraid," Haynerd was saying, as he and Father Waite were wending
their way to the Beaubien home a few evenings later, "that this Carmen
is the kind of girl you read about in sentimental novels; the kind who
are always just ready to step into heaven, but who count for little in
the warfare and struggle of actual mundane existence.She
isn't quite true to life, you know, as a book critic would say of an
impossible heroine.""You mistake, my friend," replied Father Waite warmly."She is the
very kind we would see oftener, were it not for the belief that years
bring wisdom, and so, as a consequence, the little child is crushed
beneath a load of false beliefs and human laws that make it reflect
its mortal parents, rather than its heavenly one.""But I'd like to see her under stress--"

"Under stress!You haven't the slightest conception
of the stress she's been under most of her life!But your criticism
unconsciously pays her the highest tribute, for her kind never show by
word, deed, or look what they are enduring.That frail-appearing girl
has stood up under loads that would have flattened you and me out like
gold leaf!"She's so far and away ahead
of mortals like you and me that she doesn't admit the reality and
power of evil--and, believe me, she's got her reasons for not
admitting it, too!Only try humbly to
attain a little of her understanding and faith; and try to avoid
making yourself ridiculous by criticising what you do not comprehend.That, indeed, has been mankind's age-long blunder--and they have
thereby made asses of themselves!"Edward Haynerd, or "Ned," as he was invariably known, prided himself
on being something of a philosopher.And in the name of philosophy he
chose to be quixotic.That one who hated the dissimulations and shams
of our class aristocracy so cordially should have earned his
livelihood--and a good one, too--as publisher of the Social Era, a
sprightly weekly chronicle of happenings in fashionable society, would
have appeared anomalous in any but a man gifted in the Greek
sophistries and their modern innumerable and arid offshoots.Haynerd
was a laughing Democritus, an easy-going, even-tempered fellow, doomed
to be loved, and by the same graces thoroughly cheated by the world in
general.He had in his rapid career of some thirty-five years dipped
deeply into things mundane, and had come to the surface, sputtering
and blowing, with his face well smeared with mud from the shallow
depths.Whereupon he remarked that such an existence was a poor way of
serving the Lord, and turned cynic.It
was likewise his capital and stock-in-trade.By it he won a place for
himself in the newspaper world, and later, as a credit asset, had
employed it successfully in negotiating for the Social Era.It taking
over the publication of this sheet he had remarked that life was
altogether too short to permit of attempting anything worth while; and
so he forthwith made no further assaults upon fame--assuming that he
had ever done so--but settled comfortably down to the enjoyment of his
sinecure.And as justification for his
self-imposed celibacy he pompously quoted Kant: "I am a bachelor, and
I could not cease to be a bachelor without a disturbance that would be
intolerable to me."He simply shirked
responsibility and ease-threatening risk."You see," he remarked, explaining himself later to Carmen, "I'm a
pseudo-litterateur--I conduct a 'Who's It?'for the quidnunces of this
blase old burg.And I really meet a need by furnishing an easy method
of suicide, for my little vanity sheet is a sort of social mirror,
that all who look therein may die of laughter.By the way, I had to
run those base squibs about you; but, by George!I'm going to make a
retraction in next Saturday's issue.I'll put a crimp in friend Ames
that'll make him squeal.I'll say he has ten wives, and eight of 'em
Zulus, at that!""We have enough to meet, without
going out of our way to stir up more.Let it all work out now, as it
will, in the right way."Say, don't you
think that in formulating a new religion you're carrying coals to
Newcastle?Seems to me we've got enough now, if we'd practice 'em."Haynerd, is only the practice of the teachings of a
Nazarene Jew, named Jesus," she replied gently."Well, my religion is Socialism, I guess," he said lightly.So we
meet on common ground, don't we?"She held out her hand, and he took
it, a puzzled expression coming into his face."Well," he said, glancing about, "we'll have to dispute that later.I
see Father Waite is about to open this little religious seminar.But
we'll get back to the discussion of myself," he added, his eyes
twinkling."For, like Thoreau, I prefer to discuss that subject,
because there's no other about which I know so much.""Nor so little," she added, laughing and squeezing his hand as she
turned from him.The little coterie took their places around the dining room table,
which was well strewn with books of reference and writing materials.A deep, reverent silence fell
upon the group."Friends," began Father Waite slowly, "we are inaugurating to-night a
mission of the most profound significance.No question so vitally
touches the human race as the one which we shall reverently discuss in
this and subsequent meetings.I thought as I came in here to-night of
the wisdom of Epictitus, who said, 'What do I want?To acquaint myself
with the true order of things and comply with it.'I am sure no
statement so fully expresses our common desire as that.""If Adam was a Baptist, I want to know
and comply with the fact."Then Father Waite held up a hand and again
became serious."Can we treat lightly even the Adam story, when we consider how much
misery and rancor its literal acceptance has caused among mankind?Out of deepest sympathy for a world in search of truth, let us pity
their stumblings, and take heed that we fall not ourselves."Carmen's hand stole toward the
Beaubien's and clasped it tightly."In these days, as of old, it is still said, 'There is no God!'And
yet, though the ignorant and wilful admit it not, mankind's very
existence is a function of their concept of a Creator, a sole
cause of all that is.No question, economic, social, political, or
other, is so vitally related to humanity as this: 'Is there a God?'And the corollary: 'What is His relation to me?'For there can be
nothing so important as a knowledge of truth.Can the existence
of a God be demonstrated?Can He be shown to be beneficent, in
view of the world's testimony?If the
Bible, then can its authenticity be established?The greatest of
our so-called civilizations are known as Christian.But who can say
by them what Christianity really is?""I am quite prepared to say what it is not!""Doubtless," resumed Father Waite.But at present
we are seeking constructive criticism, not solely destructive.There
has been quite enough of that sort in the world.But, to go a step
further, can we say positively that the truth is to be found even in
Christianity?""Please explain your question," said Miss Wall, with a puzzled look."The first essential is always facts," he continued."The deduction of
right conclusions will follow--provided, as Matthew Arnold so tersely
said, we have sufficient delicacy of perception, subtlety, wisdom, and
tact.And, I may add, sufficient freedom from prejudice and mental
bias--ah, there is the stumbling block!""Matthew Arnold," ventured Haynerd, "was dubbed a first-class infidel,
as I recall it."As have been many of the world's most earnest searchers.Yet he enunciated much truth, which we to-day are acknowledging.But,
to resume, since Christianity as we know it is based upon the
personality of a man, Jesus, we ask: Can the historicity of Jesus be
established?"queried Miss Wall in greater
surprise than before.And if so, is he correctly reported in what we call the Gospels?Then, did he reveal the truth to his followers?And, lastly, has that
truth been correctly transmitted to us?""And," added Hitt, "there is still the question: Assuming that he gave
us the truth, can we apply it successfully to the meeting of our daily
needs?""The point is well taken," replied Father Waite."For, though I may
know that there are very abstruse mathematical principles, yet I may
be utterly unable to demonstrate or use them.But now," he went on,
"we are brought to other vital questions concerning us.They are, I
think, points to which the theologian has given but scant thought.If
we conclude that there is a God, we are confronted with the material
universe and man.And what are their natures and
import?""Seems to me you've cut out a large
assignment for this little party.Those are questions that the world
has played football with for thousands of years.Do you think we can
settle them in a few evenings' study?We can't spare you," laughed Father Waite.Then he glanced at
Carmen, who had sat quiet, apparently unhearing, during the remarks."I think you will hear things soon that will set you thinking," he
said."But now we are going to let our traveled friend, Mr.Hitt,
give us just a word in summation of his thought regarding the
modern world and its attitude toward the questions which we have been
propounding."The explorer leaned back in his chair and assumed his customary
attitude when in deep thought.All eyes turned upon him in eager
expectation."The world," he began reflectively, "presents to me to-day the most
interesting aspect it has assumed since history began.True, the age
is one of great mental confusion.Quite as true, startling discoveries
and astounding inventions have so upset our staid old mediaeval views
that the world is hurriedly crowding them out, together with its God.Doctrines for which our fathers bled and burned are to-day lightly
tossed upon the ash heap.The searchlight is turned never so
mercilessly upon the founder of the Christian religion, and upon the
manuscripts which relate his words and deeds.Yet most of us have
grown so busy--I often wonder with what--that we have no time for that
which can not be grasped as we run.We work desperately by day,
building up the grandest material fabric the world has ever seen; and
at night we repair the machine for the next day's run.Even our
college professors bewail the lack of time for solid reading and
research.And if our young pursue studies, it is with the almost
exclusive thought of education as a means of earning a material
livelihood later, and, if possible, rearing a mansion and stocking its
larder and garage.It is, I repeat, a grandly materialistic age,
wherein, to the casual observer, spirituality is at a very low ebb."He thrust his long legs under the table and cast his eyes upward to
the ceiling as he resumed:

"The modern world is still in its spiritual infancy, and does not
often speak the name of God.Not that we are so much irreverent as
that we feel no special need of Him in our daily pursuits.Since we
ceased to tremble at the thunders of Sinai, and their lingering echoes
in bulls and heresy condemnations, we find that we get along just as
well--indeed, much better.And it really is quite bad form now to
speak continually of God, or to refer to Him as anything real and
vital.To be on such terms of intimacy with Him as this girl Carmen
is--in thought, at least--would be regarded to-day as evidence of
sentimentalism and weakness."He paused again, to marshal his thought and give his auditors an
opportunity for comment.Then, as the silence remained unbroken, he
continued:

"Viewing the world from one standpoint, it has achieved remarkable
success in applying the knout to superstition and limitation.But,
like a too energetic housekeeper, it has swept out much that is
essential with the _debris_.When spirituality ceases to be real or
vital to a people, then a grave danger threatens them.Materiality has
never proved a blessing, as history shows.Life that is made up of
strain and ceaseless worry is not life.The incessant accumulation of
material wealth, when we do not know how really to enjoy it, is folly.To pamper the flesh, to the complete ignoring of the spirit, is
suicide.The increased hankering after physical excitements and animal
pleasures, to the utter abandonment of the search for that which is
real and satisfying, is an exhibition of gross, mesmeric stupidity, to
say the least.It shows that our sense of life is awry.""But the world is surely attempting its own betterment," protested
Haynerd."I grant you that," replied Hitt."But legislation and coercion are
the wrong means to employ."Oh, well, you are not going to change the race until the individual
himself changes.""Quite the contrary, that is the
pith of my observations.And no sane
man will maintain that general reform can ever come until the
individual's needs are met--his daily, hourly, worldly needs.""I think I get your point," said Father Waite."It is wholly a
question of man's concept of the cause of things, himself included,
and their purpose and end, is it not?""The restless spirit of the modern world is
hourly voicing its discontent with a faltering faith which has no
other basis than blind belief.It wants demonstrable fact upon which
to build.In plain words, _mankind would be better if they but knew
how_!""Well, we show them how," asserted Haynerd."But they don't do as we
tell 'em.""Are you quite sure that you show them how?""What do you
ever do toward showing them how permanently to eradicate a single
human difficulty?""Oh, well, putting it that way, nothing, of course."And so
the world continues to wait for surcease from woe in a life beyond the
grave.But now, returning to our survey, let me say that amid all the
folly of vain pursuits, of wars and strife, of doleful living and
pitiable dying, there are more encouraging and hopeful signs hung out
to the inquiring thought to-day than ever before in history.If I
misread not, we are already entered upon changes so tremendous that
their end must be the revolutionizing of thought and conduct, and
hence of life.Our present age is one of great extremes: though we
touch the depths, we are aiming likewise at the heights.I doubt if
there ever was a time when so many sensed the nothingness of the
pleasures of the flesh.I doubt if ever there was such a quickening of
the business conscience, and such a determined desire to introduce
honesty and purity into our dealings with one another.Never was the
need of religion more keenly felt by the world than it is to-day; and
that is why mankind are willing to accept any religious belief,
however eccentric, that comes in the guise of truth and bearing the
promise of surcease from sin, sickness, and sorrow here this side of
the grave.The world was never so hungry for religious truth; and this
fact is a perpetual challenge to the Church.There is a tremendous
world-yearning to know and to do better.I
answer, a growing appreciation of the idea that 'the kingdom of
harmony is within you.'""Jesus said that," murmured Carmen, looking up."He but amplified and gave form to the great fact that there was
an influence for better things always existent in the ancient Jews,
that'something not ourselves,' if you will, 'that makes for
righteousness.'And he showed that that influence could be outwardly
externalized in freedom from the ills which beset humanity.""Very good," put in Haynerd."That'something not ourselves' is the germ of the true idea of God,"
answered Hitt."The terms are synonymous," said Hitt."And now let me conclude with a
final observation.Mankind's beliefs are in a whirl.Orthodoxy and conservatism are hanging desperately to the
world's flying skirts, but they will eventually drop off.No change in
thought has been greater than that concerning God.The absentee Lord
who started the universe and then withdrew has gone to the scrap heap,
with the ridiculous views of predestination and infant damnation.The
idea of a God who at divers times interfered with His creation and
temporarily set aside His own laws to convince puny man of His
greatness, is likewise obsolescent.The world is slowly growing into a
conception of a creator, of some kind, but at least mental, and
universally present.Nay, more, available for all our problems and
needs.And the end will be the adoption of that conception, enlarged
and purified still further, and taken into the minutest affairs of our
daily life--as this girl has done.The day of patient suffering in
this world, under the spell of a promise of compensating reward in the
heavenly future, has all but passed.We are gradually becoming
conscious of the stupendous fact that the kingdom of all harmony,
immortality, and good, is _right here within us_--and therefore can be
naught but a consciousness of absolute good, perfectly attainable by
humanity as the 'old man' of Paul is laid off, but not gained,
necessarily, through what we call death."The silence which followed was broken at length by Miss Wall."And
what constitutes the 'old man'?""Largely, I think," said Hitt, "the belief that matter is real."exclaimed Haynerd, almost rising from his chair."I stand on my statement," he replied.Father Waite rose slowly, as if lost in thought."History shows," he
said, meditatively, "that man's progress has been proportionate to his
freedom from the limitation of ignorance and undemonstrable belief.And that freedom has come as man's concept of God has grown less and
less material, and more and more spiritual.From the animal nature of
the savage, to whom all is matter, down--or up--to the man of to-day,
to whom mind is assuming ever greater ascendency, man's progress has
been marked by a throwing off of limiting beliefs, theological or
other, in material power and substance.The development of the least
material forces, steam, electricity, the X-ray, has come only as the
human mind has thrown off a portion of its hampering material beliefs.I am astounded when I think of it, and of its marvelous message to
future generations!For, from the premise that the creator of all
things is spirit, or mind, as you will, comes the corollary that the
creation itself must of necessity be _mental_.And from this come such
deductions as fairly make me tremble.Carmen has told me of the
deductions which her tutor, the priest Jose, drew from the single
premise that the universe is infinite in extent--a premise which I
think we all will accept.""There can be no question about it," said Hitt, nodding his head."Well," continued Father Waite, "that granted, we must likewise grant
its creator to be infinite, must we not?""And that puts the creator out of the matter-class entirely.The
creator must be--"

"Mind," said Carmen, supplying the thought ever-present with her."I see no other conclusion," said Father Waite."But, that granted, a
flood of deductions pours in that sends human beliefs and reasoning
helter-skelter.For an infinite mind would eventually disintegrate if
it were not perfect in every part.""Perhaps it is already disintegrating, and that's what causes the evil
in the world," hazarded Haynerd."Utterly untenable, my friend," put in Hitt."For, granted an infinite
mind, we must grant the concomitant fact that such a mind is of very
necessity omnipotent, as well as perfect.What, then, could ever cause
disintegration in it?""You are right," resumed Father Waite."And such a mind, of very
necessity perfect, omnipotent, and, of course, ever-present, must
likewise be eternal.For there would be nothing to contest its
existence.Age, decay, and death would be unknown to it."And that," said Carmen, rising, "is my God."Father Waite nodded significantly to the others, and sat down, leaving
the girl facing them, her luminous eyes looking off into unfathomed
distances, and her face aglow with spiritual light."My God is infinite Good, to whom evil is unknown," she said."And
good includes all that is real.It includes wisdom, intelligence,
truth, life, and love--none of them material.Oh, not
by human reasoning, whereby you seek to establish the fact of His
existence, but by proof, daily proof, and in the hours when the floods
of suppositional evil have swept over me.You would rest your faith on
your deductions.But, as Saint Gregory said, no merit lies in faith
where human reason supplies the proof; and that you will all some day
know.And He ceaselessly expresses Himself in and
through His ideas, which He is constantly revealing.And these ideas express that goodness and
infinitude, from the tiniest up to the idea of God himself.And that
grandest idea is--man.Oh, no, not the men and women you think you see
about you in your daily walk.But the man that Jesus always saw back of every human concept.That
man is God's own idea of Himself.That is the man we shall all put on when we have
obeyed Paul and put off the old man, its counterfeit.""Then, Carmen," said Father Waite, "you believe all things to be
mental?""Yes, everything--man himself--and matter.""But, if God is mind, and infinite, He must include all things.Hence
He must include this imperfect representation, called the physical
man."Did not Jesus speak often of
the one lie about his Father, God?The material man and the material
universe are but parts of that lie.And a lie is always a supposition;
not real.All evil is contained in that supposition--a supposition
that there is power and life and substance apart from God.""A supposition is not made," replied Carmen quietly."I don't quite get that," interposed Miss Wall, her brows knitting.Carmen smiled down at the inquiring woman."The
creator of all things is mind.But you would have that
mind the creator of evil, also.Yet, your own reasoning has shown
that, on the premise of mind as infinite, such mind must be forever
whole, harmonious, perfect.The thoughts and ideas by which that mind
expresses itself must be likewise pure and perfect.Then that creative
mind can not create evil.For, a mind that creates evil must itself be
evil.And, being infinite, such a mind must include the evil it
creates.We would have, then, either a mind wholly evil, or one of
mixed evil and good.In either case, that mind must then destroy
itself."Your reasoning is, certainly," admitted Miss Wall."But, how to
account for evil, when God is infinite good--"

"To account for it at all," replied Carmen, "would be to make it
something real.Jesus would account for it only by classing it as a
lie about God.Now God, as the creative mind, must likewise be truth,
since He is perfection and harmony.Very well, a lie is always the
opposite of truth."Yes," said Father Waite, nodding his head as certain bright memories
returned to him."That is what you told me that day when I first
talked with you."Is it strange that God should have a suppositional opposite?""Has not everything with which you are concerned a
suppositional opposite?His suppositional opposite is
the great lie of evil.And matter is just as
mental as the thoughts which you are now holding.And so, evil and the lie are unreal.""The distinction seems to me theoretical," protested Miss Wall."That word'real,'" he said, "is perhaps
what is causing your confusion.The real is that which, according to
Spencer, does not pass away.We used to believe matter indestructible,
forever permanent.We learn that our views regarding it were very
incorrect."And yet," said Father Waite, "in this universe of constant change,
_something_ endures.What is it but the mind that is God, expressing
itself in such immaterial and permanent things as law, love, life,
power?""But now we have been brought back again to
the question of matter.If we can prove that matter is mental, and not
real substance, we will have established Carmen's premise that
everything is mental.Then there remains but the distinction between
the mind that is God, and its suppositional opposite, as expressed in
human existence.Let us conclude, therefore, that to-night we have
established, at least as a working hypothesis, that, since a thing
existing implies a creator; and since the existent universe, being
infinite, demands an infinite creator; and since a creator can not be
infinite without being at once mind, perfect, eternal, omnipotent,
omniactive, and good, we are fully justified in assuming that the
creator of all things still exists, and is infinite, ever-present
mind.Further than that we are not prepared to go, until we have
discussed the questions of matter and the physical universe and man.Let us leave those topics for a subsequent meeting.And now I suggest
that we unite in asking Carmen to sing for us, to crown the unity that
has marked this discussion with the harmony of her own beautiful
voice."A few moments later, about the small upright piano which the Beaubien
had rented for Carmen, the little group sat in reverent silence, while
the young girl sent out through the little room the harmonious
expression of her own inner life, the life that had never left heaven
for earth.CHAPTER 3


With her exit from the _beau monde_ and her entrance upon the broad
stage of University life, Carmen seemed to have awakened from the
lethargy which her abrupt transition from mediaeval Simiti into the
modern world had occasioned.The static struggle to hold her own
against the rushing currents of materialism had turned at length in
her favor.The lethal influences which
rose about her like stupifying fumes in the courts of fashion had been
lifted and swept away by the fresher and more invigorating breezes
into which her bark had now been drawn.She plunged into her new work joyously; yet not without a deeper
comprehension of its meaning than that of her fellow-students.She
knew that the University was but another stepping-stone, even as her
social life had been; another series of calls and opportunities to
"prove" her God to be immanent good.For she was keenly alive to the materialistic leadings of
the "higher education," and she would stand as a living protest
against them.It had not taken her long to discover the impotence lying at the heart
of so-called modern education.She had not been slow to mark the
disappointment written upon the faces of many of her fellow-students,
who had sought in vain a great awakening light in those sacred
precincts of learning, but, their confidence betrayed, were now
floundering in the devouring morass of materialism.To her keen
insight the University stood revealed as the great panderer to this
latest century's obsessing idea that the true function of education is
expressed in the imparting of changing, human information and a
training for the business of earning one's daily bread according to
the infamous code of the world's carnal social system.The University
did not meet the most urgent need of the race by equipping men to
stand against the great crises of human experience.It did not teach
men to lay aside the counterfeit man of material sense; but rather
emphasized the world's belief in the reality of this man by minutely
detailed courses in his mundane history and the manifestations of his
pitiable ignorance in his wanton crimes and watery ambitions.To
Carmen, God was the most insistent fact of creation.And mankind's
existence could find its only justification in ceaseless, consecrated
manifestation of His harmonious activity.True, the University vaguely
recognized God as infinitely competent.But in the same breath it
confessed its utter ignorance of a demonstrable knowledge of Him, to
know whom alone is life.But their hollow prayers bore no hope, for they knew not how to gain
answers to them.And yet the girl remained in her new environment, awaiting the call to
"come up higher."And meantime she strove to gain daily a wider
knowledge of the Christ-principle, and its application to the needs
and problems of her fellow-men.Her business was the reflection of her
Father's business.The weak, transient,
flighty, so-called intellectual life which she saw about her sent no
call across the calm currents of her thought.Her education was
religious in the strictest, deepest sense, for she was learning to
know God.Though the girl pursued her way quietly, unwilling that the notoriety
which had been fastened upon her should mark her as an object of
curiosity, yet her story soon spread among University circles, and the
first semester was a scant two weeks old before her name had been
debated in the numerous Sororities and Women's Clubs, and quietly
dropped.<DW64> blood coursed in her veins; and the stigma of parental
disgrace lay dark upon her.She lived with a woman of blackened
reputation--a reputation which waxed no brighter under the casual,
malicious comments of J. Wilton Ames, whose great financial strength
had made him a Trustee of this institution of learning.If Carmen
divined the comment that was passed concerning herself, she gave no
indication.But Hitt and Father Waite knew that the girl had not found
favor in the social and fraternal organizations of her mates; and they
knew why.mused Hitt, when he could no longer
restrain himself.Then he called a student to his desk one day, at the
conclusion of his lecture."Miss West," he said, "you are leader in the most prominent Sorority
in the University.I want you to give Miss Carmen Ariza a bid."the girl asked, as she arched her brows.But--well, what if she were a negress?Hers is the
most brilliant mind in the entire student-body!"Race segregation is a divine tenet, scripturally justified.What though the girl's skin vied with the lilies and rosebuds?What
though her hair was the brown of ripe fields?Had not God Almighty
decreed that the <DW64> should remain a drawer of water?Had the Lord designed him the equal of the noble white, He would
have bleached his face, and bridged his flat nose.And the reference to her dark-skinned sisters caused a
little _moue_ of disgust, as she flatly declined to consider Carmen an
eligible candidate for membership in her Society.ejaculated Hitt, who had been brooding over the incident
as he walked home with Father Waite."That toadying, sycophantic,
wealth-worshiping Miss West can see no farther than the epidermis!If
we could have maintained Carmen's reputation as an Inca princess, this
same girl would have fawned at her feet, and begged to kiss the edge
of her robe!And she would have used every art of cajolery to
ingratiate herself into Carmen's favor, to catch the social crumbs
that our girl might chance to drop!""There, there, Hitt," soothed Father Waite."Have you any idea that
Carmen is at all injured by Miss West's supercilious conduct?"You're forgetting the girl's influence, aren't
you?"Hitt gulped his wrath down his long throat."Waite," he blurted, "that
girl's an angel!"She's so real that we don't
understand her--so real that she has been totally misunderstood by the
petty minds that have sought to crush her here in New York, that's
all.""But certainly she is unique--"

"Ah, yes; unique in that she goes about putting her arms around people
and telling them that she loves them.And she is unique in that her purity and goodness hang about her like
an exquisite aura, and make people instinctively turn and look after
her as she passes.Unique in that in her sweet presence one seems to
hear a strain of heavenly music vibrating on the air.So unique that
the dawn, the nesting birds, the wild flowers, the daily sunset,
fairly intoxicate her with ecstasy and make her life a lyric."Hitt essayed to reply; but the words hung in his throat."Yes," continued Father Waite, "she is so unique that when the
empty-headed, vain young Duke of Altern, learning that she had been
thrown out of society because of the base rumor regarding her
parentage, sent her a written statement to the effect that there was
no engagement between them, and demanded that she sign it, she did
so, with a happy smile, with an invocation, with a prayer for blessing
upon those who had tried to ruin her."Hawley-Crowles and Ames and Lafelle
filched La Libertad from her, she would have given them the clothes on
her back with it, if they had demanded them.Yes, she's unique--so
unique that again and again I hear her murmur, as she looks off
absently into space: 'If it is right that he should have a son, then I
want it to be so.'""Referring to--that priest--Jose de Rincon?"And time and again I have heard her say: 'God is
light.Old
Rosendo's grandson, you know.""Waite," he said earnestly, "she is simply illustrating
what would happen to any of us if we threw ourselves wholly upon
God's protecting care, and took our thoughts only from Him.That's
why she can lose her home, her family, her reputation, that
mine--everything--and still stand._She does what we don't dare to
do!_"

"She is a living illustration," replied Father Waite, "of the mighty
fact that there is nothing so practical as _real_ Christianity.I want
you to tell Professor Cane that.He calls her 'the girl with the
Utopian views,' because of her ingenuous replies in his sociological
class.But I want you to show him that she is very far from being
impractical.""I'll do it," said Hitt emphatically."I'll prove to Cane that her
religion is not a visionary scheme for regulating a world inhabited
only by perfect beings, but is a working principle for the every-day
sinner to use in the solution of his daily problems.Moreover, Waite,
she is a vivid illustration of the fact that when the individual
improves, the nation does likewise."I not only get you, but I stand as a proof of your statement,"
returned Father Waite gently.Carmen, her thoughts above, though her feet trod the earth, came and
went, glad and happy.The change in her mode of living from the
supreme luxury of the Hawley-Crowles mansion to the common comforts of
the home where now she dwelt so simply with the Beaubien, seemed not
to have caused even a ripple in the full current of her joy.Her life
was a symphony of thanksgiving; an antiphony, in which all Nature
voiced its responses to her in a diapason, full, rich, and harmonious.Often that autumn she might have been seen standing among the tinted
leaves on the college campus, and drinking in their silent message.And then she might have been heard to exclaim, as she turned her rapt
gaze beyond the venerable, vine-clad buildings: "Oh, I feel as if I
just couldn't stand it, all this wealth of beauty, of love, of
boundless good!"For her dark
story had reared a hedge about her; the taboo rested upon her; and
even in the crowded classrooms the schoolmates of her own sex looked
askance and drew their skirts about them.But if the students avoided her, the faculty did not.And those like
Professor Cane, who had the opportunity and the ability to peer into
the depths of the girl's soul, took an immediate and increasing
interest in her.Often her own naive manners broke down the bars of
convention, and brought her enduring friendships among the men of
learning.This was especially the case with Doctor Morton, Dean of the
School of Surgery.Yielding to a harmless impulse of curiosity, the
girl one afternoon had set out on a trip of exploration, and had
chosen the Anatomy building to begin with.Many odd sights greeted her
eager gaze as she peered into classrooms and exhibit cases; but she
met with no one until she chanced to open the door of Doctor Morton's
private laboratory, and found that eminent man bending over a human
brain, which he was dissecting.The doctor looked up, surprise
written large upon his features as he noted his fair caller.queried the girl, twisting around and
looking at the name on the door to make certain."Yes," replied the genial doctor, with growing interest.He was a
gray-haired, elderly man, slightly inclined to embonpoint, and with
keen, twinkling eyes."Yes, indeed," returned the girl; "I'd love to."Most everybody seems to have heard of me," sighed the girl."Well, it
doesn't make any difference about my coming in here, does it?"She
looked up at him so wistfully that he felt a great tug at his
heartstrings."You're as welcome as the April
sun.""Now tell me," she said eagerly,
looking about."That," said he, taking up the pulpy gray object, "is the brain of my
erstwhile friend and collaborator, Doctor Bolton.murmured Carmen, a facetious twinkle coming into
her eyes as she looked at it."In the interests of science," returned the man, studying her."That
we may increase our knowledge of this marvelous mechanism of thought,
and the laws by which it operates in mental processes.""Then you still blindly seek the living among the dead, don't you?""You think that this poor thing held life, and you
search now among its ashes for the living principle.But, God is life;
and 'Canst thou by searching find out God?'"The man regarded her intently without replying.She bent for a while
over the half-dissected brain in deep thought."Doctor," she said, "life is not structural.God is life; and to know
Him is to reflect life.Doctor, don't
you think it is about time to do away with this business of dying?"The man of science started visibly, and his eyes opened wider.The
abrupt question quite swept him off his feet."You didn't really expect to find anything in this brain, did you?""Why, mostly water, with a few commonplace salts," he answered,
wondering what the next question would be."And can a compound of water and a few commonplace salts _think_?"she
asked, looking intently at him."N--no," he answered tentatively."The brain is not the cause of thought, then, but an effect, is it
not?""Why, really, my dear Miss Carmen, we don't know.We call it the organ
of thought, because in some way thought seems to be associated with
it, rather than with--well, with the liver, or muscles, for example.And we learn that certain classes of mental disturbances are
intimately associated with lesions or clots in the brain.Then:

"Doctor, you wouldn't cut up a machine to discover the motive power,
would you?But that is just what you are doing there with that brain.You are hoping by dissecting it to find the power that made it go,
aren't you?And the power that made it go was mind--life.""But the life is not in the brain now," hazarded the doctor."You see," she went on, "if
the brain was ever alive, it could never cease to be so.If it ever
lived, it could never die.It
manifested only a false sense of life.Who
or what says that the man who owned that brain is dead?Why, the human
mind--human belief.It is the human mind, expressing its belief in
death, and in a real opposite to life, or God.She returned his look
with a confident smile."You believe in evolution, don't you?""Oh, surely," he replied unhesitatingly."Well, then, in the process of evolution, which was evolved first, the
brain, or the mind which operates it and through it?""Why," he replied meditatively, "it is quite likely that they evolved
simultaneously, the brain being the mind's organ of expression.""But don't you see, Doctor, that you are now making the mind really
come first?For that which expresses a thing is always secondary to
the thing expressed.""At any rate, it is quite immaterial to a
practical knowledge of how to meet the brain's ills.I am a practical
man, you know.""I'm sorry to hear that," she said simply."Practical men are so
stupid and ignorant."he exclaimed, putting his hands on his hips and
staring down at the smiling face."And you are so nice and friendly, I wouldn't want to think you stupid
and ignorant," she went on blandly.Well, that kind o' takes the edge off your former classification
of me," he said, greatly amused, yet wondering just what appraisal to
place upon this frank girl."And evolution," she continued, "is an unfolding, isn't it?You see,
the great fact of creation is the creator, infinite mind.Well, that
mind expresses itself in its ideas.And these it is unfolding all the
time.Now a fact always gives rise to a suppositional opposite.The
opposite of a fact is an error.And that is why error has been called
'negative truth.'Of course, there isn't any such thing as negative
truth!And so all error is simply falsity, supposition, without real
existence."Now, the human, or
carnal, mind is the negative truth of the real mind, God.It is
infinite mind's suppositional opposite.And it imitates the
infinite mind, but in a very stupid, blundering way.And so the whole
physical universe manifests evolution, too--an unfolding, or
revealing, of material types, or mental concepts.And all these
manifest the human mind's sense of life, and its equally strong
sense of death.The universe, animals, men, are all human types,
evolved, or unfolded, or revealed, in the human mind.And all are
the human mind's interpretations of infinite mind's real and eternal
and perfect ideas."You know," she laughed, "speaking of 'negative truth', the first
chapter of Genesis sets forth positive truth, and the second chapter
sets forth its opposite, negative truth.But
there it is for everybody to read.And the human mind, of course, true
to its beliefs, clings to the second chapter as the reality.Meantime, Carmen's attention had been attracted to a large microscope
that stood on the table near her.Going to it, she peeped curiously
down into the tube.Well," she suddenly asked, "have
you got the fear germ here?"But when the girl looked up, her face was quite
serious."You do not know it, Doctor, for you are a practical man, but you
haven't anything but fear germs under this glass," she said in a low
voice."Why, those are germs of typhoid and tuberculosis!""And manifestations, externalizations, of the fear germ itself, which
is mental," she added."These things don't cause disease," she went
on, pointing to the slide.Do you scientists know why people die, Doctor?""We really do not know why people die.""Then I'll tell you," she said."_It's because they don't know enough
to live._ This poor Doctor Bolton died because he didn't know that God
was life.He committed sickness, and then paid the penalty, death.He
sinned by believing that there were other powers than God, by
believing that life and thought were in matter.And so he paid the
wages of sin, death.He simply missed the mark, that's all.""You haven't asked me
to sit down," she commented brightly."But, if you don't mind, I
will."the doctor exclaimed, coloring, and hastily
setting out a chair."I really was so interested in what you were
saying that I forgot my manners.""No," she said, shaking her head as she declined the proffered chair,
"I'll sit here, so's I can look straight into your eyes.You go ahead
and cut up poor Yorick, and I'll talk.""You are much more interesting," he
returned, "than poor Bolton, dead or alive.In fact, he really was
quite a bore.But you are like a sparkling mountain rill, even if you
do give me a severe classification.""Well," she replied, "then you are honestly more interested in life
than in death, are you?"Death is _such_ a mistake; and I haven't a bit of use
for it," she continued."It's like making mistakes in music, or
mathematics.Now when we make mistakes in those, we never stop to
discuss them.The world has nearly
talked its poor old head off about the mistakes of sickness and death.It never seems to occur to the world that Jesus always associated
sickness with sin.You know, the Rabbis of his day seem to have hit
upon a great truth, although they didn't make it really practical.They maintained that a sick man could not be healed of his diseases
until all his sins had been forgiven.And so they attempted to forgive
sins and make men clean by their elaborate ceremonies.And nobody got to the root of the difficulty until
Jesus came.And that cured
the disease that was the manifestation of sin.Now I ask, why do you,
nearly two thousand years after his time, still do as the old Rabbis
did, and continue to treat the body--the effect--instead of the mental
cause?But," looking down in meditation, "I suppose if you did that
the people would cry, 'He hath a devil!'They thought I was a witch in
Simiti.""Then you do not believe that disease is
caused by microbes, I take it?"It is a
manifestation of the human mind again.And, as with typhoid fever,
diphtheria, and other diseases, the human mind applies its own
cherished, ignorant beliefs in certain methods, and then renders
innocuous its own manifestations, microbes.The human mind makes its
own diseases, and then in some cases removes the disease, but still by
human, material methods.At last it
yields itself to its false beliefs, and then goes out in what it calls
death.It is all a mental process--all human thought and its various
manifestations.Now why not get beyond microbes and reach the cause,
even of them, the human mind itself?Why do not you men of science do likewise?"Doctor Morton himself took the chair which he had set out for the
girl."What you say," he replied slowly, "is not new to me.But I can
only answer that the world is not ready yet for the great change which
you suggest."What mesmerism you are laboring
under!"Well, then, would he be accepted to-day, if he had not come before?""And I quite agree with you," she said firmly."Now the world has
doctored for more than four thousand years, despite the fact that
health is not sold in bottle or pill form.Doctor, what does the
history of all these centuries of drugging show you?"Carmen waited a moment; then continued:

"Don't they demonstrate the absolute inability of medicines to cure
disease?""Any more than putting men in prison cures
crime?""They at least prove that medication has not _permanently_ removed
disease," he ventured, not wishing to go too far."Doctor," she said earnestly, "that man Jesus, who, according to you,
came too soon, said: 'Without me ye can do nothing.'Well, didn't he
come very, very close to the truth when he made that statement?He did
not say that without drugs or material remedies we could do nothing,
but that without the Christ-principle mankind would continue, as
before, to miss the mark.He showed that disease and discord result
from sin.Sin is lack of righteousness, lack of right-thinking about
things.Its effect,
disease, is mental--a state of discordant consciousness.Can you with
drugs change a state of mind?""Whiskey and opium cause changes in
one's state of mind.""But the human belief of power inherent in whiskey
and opium, or of the human body's reaction to them, causes a change in
the human thought-activity that is called consciousness.The state of
human consciousness changes with the belief, but not the real state of
mind.And Doctor Bolton--"

"Bolton was not sick.He died of natural causes, old age, and general
breakdown," was the doctor's refuge.Carmen laughed and sprang down from the table."What an obstinately
obdurate lot you scientific men are!""Don't you know
that you doctors are only a development of the old'medicine-man'?Bolton isn't dead; and, in the second, there
are no _natural_ causes of death.Why, that's gone out of
fashion, long since.""Then," with a note of banter in his voice, "I take it that you do not
expect to die.""I expect good, nothing but
good, ever!Don't you know that physiologists themselves admit that
the human body is composed of eighty-five per cent water and fifteen
per cent ordinary salts?Can such a combination have intelligence and
sensation?Do you still believe that life is dependent upon lungs,
stomach, or liver?Why, the so-called 'unit cell' breathes, digests,
and manifests life-functions, and yet it has no lungs, no mouth, no
stomach, no organs.It is the human mind, assuming knowledge and power
which it does _not_ possess, that says the sense of life shall depend
upon such organs in the one case and not in the other.And the human
mind could be utterly refuted if men would only learn to use the
Christ-principle.Jesus and Paul used it, and proved material laws to
be only false beliefs.""Well," he replied meditatively, "if you are correct, then the
preachers are way off the track.And I have long since come to the
conclusion that--Well," changing abruptly back to the previous topic,
"so you refute the microbe theory, eh?""I said I did and did not," she laughed."Listen: fear, worry, hatred,
malice, murder, all of which are mental things in themselves, manifest
to the human mind as microbes.These are the hurtful microbes, and
they produce toxins, which poison the system.It is
the Christ-principle.Now you can learn that principle, and how to
apply it.But if you don't care to, why, then you must go on with your
material microbes and poisons, and with your diseases and death, until
you are ready to leave them and turn to that which is real.For all
human-mind activity and manifestation, whether in microbes, death, or
life, is mental, and is but the counterfeit of the real activity of
divine mind, God."Do you know," she pursued earnestly, "I heard a lecture the other day
in which it was said that life is a sort of fermentation in the body.Well, as regards human life, I guess that is so.For the human body is
only a manifestation of the human mind; and the human mind surely is
in a continuous state of ferment!""The lecturer," she continued, "said that the
range of life was from ultra-microbe to man, and that Shakespeare
began as a single cell.The mundane concept of
Shakespeare's body may have unfolded from a cell-concept; but
Shakespeare was a manifestation of mind!And that mind was an
interpretation, though very imperfect, of the mind that is God.Why
can't you materialists raise your eyes above the dust?Why, you would
choke the very avenues of the spirit with mud!"Well, your education seems to be--"

"Yes," she interrupted, "my education is beyond the vagaries that are
so generally taught in the name of knowledge.It does nothing for mankind, except to give them a false
culture.Were the so-called great men of the past really educated?Here is an extract which I copied this afternoon from Hawthorne."She
opened her note book and read:

  "'Ah, but there is a half-acknowledged melancholy like to this
  when we stand in the perfected vigor of our life and feel that
  Time has now given us all his flowers, and that the next work of
  his never-idle fingers must be to steal them one by one away.'"Now," she asked, "was that man really educated?But that theology _could not solve his least earthly problem, nor
meet his slightest need_!Oh, what inexpressibly sad lives so many of
your greatest men have lived!Your Hawthorne, your Longfellow, they
yearned for the rest which they were taught was to follow death.If they
believed in the Christ--and they thought they did--why, then, did they
not rise up and do as he bade them do, put death out?He taught no
such resignation to human beliefs as they practiced!He showed men how
to overcome the world.He looked at her intently for some moments.She seemed, as she stood
there before him, like a thing of gossamer and sunshine that had
drifted into his laboratory, despite the closed door."Say," he suddenly exclaimed, as a new thought struck him, "I'd like
to have you talk with my friend, Reverend Patterson Moore!Pat and I
have barked at each other for many years now, and I'm getting tired.I'd like to shift him to a younger and more vigorous opponent.I
believe you've been providentially sent to relieve me.""You can tell Professor Hitt, and--"

"Hitt, eh?He is very much interested
in these things that you and I have been talking about to-day.We have
regular meetings, with Father Waite, and Mr.Haynerd, and--"

"Well, no wonder you can argue!But--suppose I have Hitt bring me to one of your meetings, eh?"The genial doctor laughed long and incontinently."I imagine Reverend
Pat wouldn't thank you for referring to him that way," he said."He is
a very high Anglican, and his dignity is marvelous--to say nothing of
his self-esteem.Well, we'll see, we'll see."I didn't really mean to come in here, you
know.But I guess I was led, don't you?"And when the door had closed upon her, the doctor sat silently beside
the pulseless brain of his deceased comrade and pondered long.*       *       *       *       *

When Carmen entered the house, late that afternoon, she found the
Beaubien in conversation with Professor Williams, of the University
School of Music.That gentleman had learned through Hitt of the girl's
unusual voice, and had dropped in on his way home to ask that he might
hear and test it.With only a smile for reply, Carmen tossed her books
and hat upon the sofa and went directly to the piano, where she
launched into the weird Indian lament which had produced such an
astounding effect upon her chance visitors at the Elwin school that
day long gone, and which had been running in her thought and seeking
expression ever since her conversation with Doctor Morton a short
while before.For a full half hour she sang, lost in the harmony that poured from
her soul.Father Waite entered, and quietly took a seat.Song after song, most of them the characteristic soft
melodies of her people, and many her own simple improvisations, issued
from the absorbed girl's lips.The Beaubien rose and stole softly from
the room.Father Waite sat with his head resting on his hand, striving
to interpret the message which welled from the depths of his own
being, where hidden, unused chords were vibrating in unison with those
of this young girl.Then, abruptly, the singing stopped, and Carmen turned and faced her
auditors."There," she said, with a happy sigh, "that just _had_ to
come out!""Who, may I ask, was your
teacher?"he said, in a voice husky with emotion.A look of astonishment came into the man's face.He turned to Father
Waite inquiringly.The latter nodded his confirmation of the girl's
words."I wonder if you realize what you
have got, Miss Carmen?""It's a beautiful gift, isn't it?""But--I had thought of asking you to let me train you--but--I--I dare
not undertake to handle such a voice as yours.May I--may I send
Maitre Rossanni to you, the great Italian?"Oh, yes," returned the girl; "I'll sing for anybody.The gift isn't
mine, you know.When the professor had taken his reluctant departure, the Beaubien
returned and handed Carmen a letter.With a cry of joy the girl seized
it and tore it open.It was from Colombia, the second one that her
beloved Rosendo had succeeded in getting down the river to the distant
coast.It had been written three months prior, and it bore many stains
and evidences of the vicissitudes through which it had emerged.Yes,
Rosendo and his family were well, though still at Maria Rosa, far up
the Boque, with Don Nicolas.The war raged below them, but they were
safe."And not a word from Padre Jose, or about him," murmured the girl,
sinking into a chair and clasping the soiled letter to her breast.Father Waite thought of the little newsboy of Cartagena, and his
possible share in the cause of Jose's silence.CHAPTER 4


Carmen's first serious test of her knowledge of English composition
was made early in the semester, in an essay on town life in Colombia;
and so meritorious did her instructor consider it that he advised her
to send it to a prominent literary magazine.The result was that the
essay was accepted, and a request made for further contributions.The girl bubbled with new-found happiness.Then she wrote another, and
still another article on the life and customs of her people.Both
were given publication; and with the money which she received for them
she bought a silk dress for Jude, much to that adoring woman's
surprise and vehement protest.Carmen might have saved the money
toward a piano--but, no; that would have been thinking of herself, and
was inadmissible.Nor did the Beaubien offer any objection."Indeed,"
commented that fond shepherd of this lone lamb, "she would have poured
the money out into somebody's open hand anyway, and it might as well
be Jude's."Then she choked back the tears as she added: "The girl comes home
every night with an empty purse, no matter how full it may have been
in the morning.Carmen's slight success in the field of letters still further aroused
Haynerd's interest.The peacefully somnolent Social Era, he thought,
might awaken to new things under the stimulus of such fresh writing as
hers.Perhaps life did hold something of real value after all.Would
she furnish him with a column or two on the peculiar social aspect of
the metropolis?And the result was that the staid conservative
sheet was given a smart shaking; and several prominent society people
sat up and blinked.It but threw a clear light from a somewhat unusual
angle upon certain phases of New York's social life, and uncovered a
few of the more subtly hidden springs of its peculiar activity.Among those who read her essay in the Social Era was J. Wilton Ames.He first lay back in his chair and laughed uproariously.And then,
when his agents discovered for him the identity of the author, he
glowered.The Beaubien was still standing between him and this budding
genius.And though he might, and would, ultimately ruin the Beaubien
financially, yet this girl, despite her social ostracism, bade fair to
earn with her facile pen enough to maintain them both in luxury.So he
bent anew to his vengeful schemes, for he would make them come to him.As Trustee, he would learn what courses the girl was pursuing in the
University--for he had long known that she was in attendance there.Then he would learn who her associates were; what suggestions and
advice her instructors gave her; and her plans for the future.And he
would trace her sources of income and apply pressure at the most vital
point.He had never in his life been successfully balked.Then Haynerd came to congratulate Carmen again, and to request that
she attend with him the formal opening of the new Ames mansion, the
great Fifth Avenue palace, for he wanted her vivid, first-hand
impressions for his account of the brilliant affair in the Social Era.As reporters, he explained, they would of necessity remain in
seclusion, and the girl might disguise to such an extent as to prevent
recognition, if she chose.It was business for him, and an opportunity
for rich experience for her.And the fearless girl went, because it
would help Haynerd, though the Beaubien inwardly trembled.Invitations to the number of three hundred had been issued to the
_elite_ of New York, announcing the formal opening of the newly
finished, magnificent Ames dwelling.These invitations were wrought in
enamel on cards of pure gold.A month prior to the opening, the
newspapers had printed carefully-worded announcements of the return of
Mrs.J. Wilton Ames and her daughter, after a protracted stay at
various foreign baths and rest-cures in the hope of restoring the
former's impaired health.Ames now felt that she could no
longer deprive society of her needed activities, and so had returned
to conduct it through what promised to be a season of unusual
brilliancy.The papers did not, however, state that J. Wilton had
himself recalled her, after quietly destroying his bill of divorce,
because he recognized the necessity of maintaining the social side of
his complicated existence on a par with his vast business affairs.As Carmen and Haynerd approached the huge, white marble structure,
cupolaed, gabled, buttressed, and pinnacled, an overwhelming sense of
what it stood for suddenly came upon the girl, and she saw revealed in
a flash that side of its owner's life which for so many months she had
been pondering.The great shadows that seemed to issue from the
massive exterior of the building swept out and engulfed her; and she
turned and clasped Haynerd's arm with the feeling that she would
suffocate were she to remain longer in them."Perk up, little one," said Haynerd, taking her hand."We'll go round
to the rear entrance, and I will present my business card there.Ames's secretary telephoned me instructions, and I said I was going to
bring a lady reporter with me."Carmen caught her breath as she passed through the tall, exquisitely
wrought iron gateway and along the marble walk which led to the rear.Up the winding steps to the front entrance, where swung the marvelous
bronze doors which had stirred the imaginations of two continents,
streamed the favored of the fashionable world.Among them Carmen saw
many whom she recognized.The buffoon, Larry Beers, was there,
swinging jauntily along with the bejeweled wife of Samson, the
multimillionaire packer.Kane and his wife, and Weston followed.Outside the gates there was incessant chugging of automobiles, mingled
with the shouted orders of the three policemen detailed to direct the
traffic.A pinched, ragged urchin and his tattered little sister crept
up and peered wildly through the iron pickets of the fence; but a
sharp rap from a policeman's club sent them scattering.Carmen stood
for a moment in the shadows and watched the swarm mount the marble
steps and enter through those wonderful doors.There were congressmen
and senators, magnates and jurists, distillers and preachers.Each one
owed his tithe of allegiance to Ames.Some were chained to him hard
and fast, nor would break their bonds this side of the grave.There were those who grew white under his most casual
glance.There were others who knew that his calloused hand was closing
about them, and that when it opened again they would fall to the
ground, dry as dust.Others, like moths, not yet singed, were hovering
ever closer to the bright, cruel flame.Reverend Darius Borwell,
bowing and smiling, alighted from his parochial car and tripped
blithely up the glistening marble steps.Each and all, wrapping the
skeleton of grief, greed, shame, or fear beneath swart broadcloth and
shimmering silk, floated up those ghostly steps as if drawn by a
tremendous magnet incarnate in the person of J. Wilton Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away.Hawley-Crowles sigh in the wake of that gilded assembly?Did the moans
of poor, grief-stricken Mrs.Gannette, sitting in her poverty and
sorrow, die into silence against those bronze doors?Was he, the being
who dwelt in that marble palace, the hydra-headed embodiment of the
carnal, Scriptural, age-old power that opposes God?How many others there were
scattered through the house itself, Haynerd could only guess.But he
passed inspection and was admitted with the girl.A butler took
immediate charge of them, and led them quickly through a short passage
and to an elevator, by which they mounted to another floor, where,
opening a paneled oak door, the dignified functionary preceded them
into a small reception hall, with lavatories at either end.Here he
bade them remove their wraps and await his return."Well," commented Haynerd, with a light, nervous laugh, "we've crossed
the Rubicon!A moment later the butler returned with a sharp-eyed young woman, Mrs."You will be very careful in your report," the latter began at once in
a business-like manner."And you will submit the same to me for
approval before it is published in your magazine.Ames deems that
imperative, since your recent publication of an essay on modern
society in this city.I have a list here of the guests, their business
and social standing, and other data.You
will say that this is the most brilliant assemblage ever gathered
under one roof in New York.The wealth represented here to-night will
total not less than three billion dollars.The jewels alone displayed
will foot up not less than twenty millions.Now, let me see," again
consulting her notes.Haynerd stole a covert glance at Carmen and winked."The chef," the secretary resumed, "was brought over from Paris by
Mrs.His name, Pierre Lotard, descendant of
the famous chef of the Emperor Napoleon First.He considers that his
menu to-night surpasses anything he ever before achieved.""May I ask," interrupted Haynerd, "the probable cost of the supper?""Yes, perhaps you had better mention that item.It will be in the
neighborhood of three hundred dollars a plate.House and table
decorations, about eight thousand dollars.The menu cards were hand-illuminated by Parisian
artists, and each bears a sketch illustrative or suggestive of the
guest to whom it is given.""Three thousand, if I correctly recall it," was the nonchalant reply."As to the viands, you will mention that they have been gathered from
every part of the world.Now come with me, and I will give you a hasty
sketch of the house, while the guests are assembling in the grand
salon.Then you will remain in the balcony, where you will make what
notes you wish on the dress displayed.Refreshments will be served to
you later in this waiting room.I need not remind you that you are not
expected to mingle with the guests, nor to address any one.Keep to
the balcony, and quite out of view."Opening a door opposite the one through which she had entered, the
young woman led her charges directly out upon the great marble balcony
overlooking the grand salon below.A rush of brilliant light engulfed
them, and a potpourri of chatter and laughter, mingled with soft music
from a distant organ, and the less distinct notes of the orchestra in
the still more distant ballroom, rose about them in confused babel, as
they tiptoed to the exquisitely carved marble railing and peered down
upon the gorgeous pageant.The ceiling rose far above them, delicately
tinted like a soft Italian sky.The lofty walls dropped, like
gold-gray veils, to the richly carved paneled wainscoting beneath,
which had once lined the halls of a mediaeval castle on the Rhine.The
great windows were hidden behind rare Venetian lace curtains, over
which fell hangings of brocade, repeating the soft tints of the wall
and the brocade-covered chairs and divans ranged close about the sides
of the splendid room.On the floor lay a massive, priceless Persian
carpet, dating from the fifteenth century.Haynerd drew a long breath, and whistled softly.From the end of the
salon he could mark the short flight of steps which led to the
mezzanine, with its walls heavily tapestried, and broken by rich oak
doors opening into lavatories and lounging rooms, itself widening at
the far end into the grand billiard and smoking parlors, done off in
Circassian walnut, with tables and furniture to harmonize.From the
mezzanine he saw the grand stairway falling away in great, sweeping
curves, all in blended marble from the world's greatest quarries, and
delicately chased and carved into classic designs.Two tapestries,
centuries old, hung from the walls on either side.Far above, the oak
ceiling, for which the _Schwarzwald_ had been ranged, was overlaid
with pure gold leaf.The whole was suffused with the glow of myriad
hidden and inverted lights, reflected in a thousand angles from
burnished gold and marble and rarest gems.He groped in the chambers of
his imagery for some superlative adjective to express his emotion
before this colossal display of wealth.But his ample vocabulary had
faded quite.He could only shake his head and give vent to the inept
remark, "Swell--by George!"The secretary, without replying, motioned them to follow.Passing
noiselessly around the balcony to the opposite side, she indicated a
door below, leading off to the right from the grand salon."That room beyond," she said, "is the petit salon.It is
in panels from French chateaux, covered with Gobelin tapestry.Now
from here you can see a bit of the music room.The grand organ cost,
installed, about two hundred thousand dollars.It is electrically
controlled, with its pipes running all around the room, so as to give
the effect of music coming from every corner.""There are three art galleries beyond, two for paintings, and one for
sculpture.Ames has without doubt the finest art collection in
America.It includes several Titians, Veroneses, da Vincis, Turners,
three Rubens, and two Raphaels.By the way, it may interest you to
know that his negotiations for the Murillo Madonna were completed
to-day, and the picture will be sent to him immediately.""Might I ask what he paid for it?""You may say that he paid something over three hundred thousand
dollars for it," she replied, in a quite matter of fact tone."Now,"
she continued, "you will go back to your first position, near the door
of the waiting room, and remain there until I return.I may have an
opportunity later to show you the library.Great
carved stone fireplace, taken from a Scotch castle.Hundreds of rare
volumes and first editions.Now, if any one approaches, you can step
behind the screen and remain out of view.You have chairs and a table
there for your writing.With this final injunction she turned and disappeared into the little
waiting room from which they had emerged.For some moments Carmen and Haynerd stood looking alternately at
each other and about them at their magnificent environment.Both had
seen much of the gilded life, and the girl had dwelt some months in
its alien atmosphere.But neither had ever witnessed such a
stupendous display of material wealth as was here unfolded before
their astonished gaze.At the head of the grand stairway stood the
Ames trio, to receive their resplendent guests.The women were
magnificently gowned.But Ames's massive form in its simple black
and chaste linen was the cynosure of all eyes.Even Haynerd could
not suppress a note of admiration as he gazed at the splendid figure."And yet," he murmured, "a victim, like the rest, of the great
delusion."Carmen laid down the opera glasses through which she had been studying
the man."He is an expression," she said, "of the American ideal--the
ideal of practical material life.It is toward his plane of life that
this country's youth are struggling, at, oh, what a cost!Think,
think, what his immense, misused revenue could do, if unselfishly
used!Why, the cost of this single night's show would put two hundred
men like Father Waite through a four-year course in the University,
and train them to do life's work!"Oh, further opportunities to increase his pile, I suppose," returned
Haynerd, shrugging his shoulders.And does he need further
opportunities to accumulate money?Does he not rather need some one to
show him the meaning of life, how to really live?"And it may be your mission, Carmen, to do just that.But if you don't, then I sincerely hope the man may die before he
discovers that all that he has achieved, his wealth, his prestige, his
power, have not been worth striving for!""He hasn't the slightest idea of the meaning of life," she murmured,
looking down upon the glittering throng."They put me in mind of Carlyle's famous remark, as
he stood looking out across the London Strand: 'There are in this city
some four million people, mostly fools.'How mean, narrow and hard
their lives are!These are the high priests of vested privilege, of
mediaevalism, of old institutions whose perpetual maintenance, even in
a generation that has progressed far beyond them, is a fungus blight
upon us.Ah, there's little Willie Van Wot, all dolled out!He's
glorifying his Creator now by devoting his foolish little existence to
coaching trips along the New England shore.He reminds me of the Fleet
street poet who wrote a century ago of the similar occupation of a
young dandy of that day--

                  What can little T. O. do?Why, drive a Phaeton and Two!!!Can little T. O. do no more?Yes, drive a Phaeton and Four!!!!"He's an interesting outgrowth of our unique social system, eh?""We must follow Emerson and treat them all as we do pictures, look at
them in the best light," murmured Carmen."Aye, hang them in the best light!""But make sure
they're well hung!There goes the pseudo-princess, member of the royal
house of England.I tell you, under
the splash and glitter you can see the feet of clay, eh?""Yes," smiled Carmen, "resting upon the high heel."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture of disgust."The women of
fashion seem to feel that the Creator didn't do a good job when He
designed the feminine sex--that He should have put a hump where the
heel is, so's to slant the foot and make comfortable walking
impossible, as well as to insure a plentiful crop of foot-troubles and
deformities.The Chinese women used to manifest a similarly insane
thought.The human mind is a cave
of black ignorance!"Carmen did not reply, but bent her attention again to the throng
below."Look there," said Haynerd, indicating a stout, full-toiletted woman,
resplendent with diamonds."That's our eminent French guest, Madam
Carot.She severed herself from her tiresome consort last year by
means of a bichloride tablet deftly immersed in his coffee, and then,
leaving a sigh of regret hovering over his unhandsome remains,
hastened to our friendly shores, to grace the _beau monde_ with her
gowns and jewels."Carmen turned to him with a remonstrance of incredulity."The Social Era got the whole spicy
story.See, she's drifted up to young Watson!Coquetting for a
husband still, the old buzzard!""Well, it's fact, anyway," persisted the society monitor."And there
beyond her is fat little Mrs.Stuffenheimer, with her two unlovely,
red-faced daughters.Ah, the despairing mamma is still vainly angling
for mates for her two chubby Venuses!If they're not married off
properly and into good social positions soon, it's mamma for the scrap
heap!it's positively tragic to see these anxious mothers
at Newport and Atlantic City and other fashionable places, rushing
madly hither and yon with their marriageable daughters, dragging them
from one function to another in the wild hope that they may ultimately
land a man.Worry and pain dig deep furrows into poor mamma's face if
she sees her daughters fading into the has-been class.It requires
heroism, I say, to travel in society!Well,"
taking up his notebook, "we must get busy now.By the way, how's your
shorthand progressing?""Oh, splendidly," replied the girl, her eyes still upon the massive
figure of Ames.Then, recovering from her abstraction, "I can write as
fast in it now as in longhand."For more than an hour the two sat in the seclusion of the splendid
balcony, looking down upon the scene of magnificence below.Through
the mind of the young girl ran a ceaseless paean of thanksgiving for
her timely deliverance from the trammels which she so well knew
enshackled these glittering birds of paradise.With it mingled a
great, consuming desire, a soul-longing to pour into the vacuity of
high society the leaven of her own pure thought.In particular did her
boundless love now go out to that gigantic figure whose ideals of life
this sumptuous display of material wealth and power expressed.Was it only a vainglorious
exhibition of his own human prowess?Was it an announcement,
magnificent beyond compare, that he, J. Wilton Ames, had attained the
supreme heights of gratified world ambition?That the world at last
lay at his feet?And that over it brooded the giant's lament that
there remained nothing more to conquer?But, if so, the girl at least
knew that the man's herculean efforts to subdue the material world
were as nothing.The real conquest lay still before him, the conquest
of self.And when that were faced and achieved, well she knew that no
such garish display as this would announce the victory to a breathless
world.The bustling little social secretary again appeared, and briefly
announced the production of an opera in the auditorium, to which she
had come to conduct them.Passing through the little waiting room and
to the elevator, they quickly mounted to the unoccupied gallery of the
theater above.The parquet, which would seat nearly a thousand
spectators, was rapidly filling with an eager, curious throng.The
Ames trio and some of the more distinguished guests were already
occupying the gorgeously decorated boxes at the sides.An orchestra of
fifty pieces was visible in the hollow below the stage.Caroni, the
famous grand opera leader, stood ready to conduct.The opera itself
was the much discussed music drama, Salome."Now," commented Haynerd to his fair, wondering companion, who was
lost in contemplation of the magnificent mural decorations of the
little theater, "we will see something rare, for this opera has been
called the most artistic piece of indecency known to the stage.Ames has got Marie Deschamps for the title role.She'll cost
him not less than five thousand dollars for this one night.And--see
here," drawing Carmen's attention to the bill, "Marcou and Corvalle
besides!These stars get three thousand
dollars a night during the regular season."Every phase of sophistication was manifested in that glittering
audience when the curtain rose and the sensational theme was
introduced.But to none came thoughts like those which clamored for
admittance at the portals of Carmen's mentality.In the bold challenge
of the insanely sensual portrayal of a carnal mind the girl saw the
age-old defiance of the spirit by the flesh.In the rolls of the
wondrous music, in its shrieks, its pleadings, and its dying echoes,
she heard voiced again the soul-lament of a weary world searching
vainly in the mazes of human thought for truth.As the wonderful
Deschamps danced weirdly before her in the ghastly light and fell
gloating over her gory trophy, Carmen saw but the frantic struggles of
a diseased soul, portrayed as the skilled surgeon lays bare the
malignant growth that is eating the quivering tissues of a human
frame.The immodesty of dress, the sensual suggestiveness of the
dance, the brutal flouting of every element of refinement and
delicacy, blazoned in frenzied tone and movement the bloody orgy and
dance of death which goes on incessantly upon the stage of human life,
and ends in the mad whirl and confusion and insane gibbering over the
lifeless trophies for which mankind sell their very souls.commented Haynerd, when the final
curtain dropped."Yes, even to a vitiated taste.The passionate thirst
for the sensational has led to this sickening display of salacity--"

"Splendid, wasn't it?"came in tones of admiration from the social
secretary, who had returned to conduct her charges back to the balcony
before the guests emerged from the theater."You will run the program
in full, and comment at some length on the expense attached," she went
on."You have just witnessed the private production of a full opera,
unabridged, and with the regular operatic cast.Supper will follow in
a half hour.Meantime, you will remain in the balcony where you were
before."Returning to their former position, Carmen sank into a chair at the
little table behind the screen, and strove to orient her thought.Haynerd sat down beside her to arrange his voluminous notes.Presently
footsteps were heard, and the sound of voices.Haynerd glanced through
the hinge of the screen.he whispered, "here comes Ames
and--who's with him?Showing him about, I
suppose."Carmen gazed at the approaching men with fascinated eyes, although she
saw but one, the towering magician who had reared this fairy palace.She saw Ames lead his companion to the door of the little waiting room
at their right, and heard the congressman protest against entering."But we can talk undisturbed in here," urged Ames, his hand on the
door."Better remain out here on the balcony," replied the congressman
nervously, as he moved toward the railing.He understood the
man's repugnance fully."You know, Wales," he said easily, going to the railing and peering
over at the brilliant assemblage below, "if I could get the heathen
Chinee to add an extra half-inch to his shirt length, I'd make a
hundred millions.And then, perhaps, I wouldn't need to struggle with
your Ways and Means Committee as I do.By the way, the cotton schedule
will be reported out unchanged, I presume."He turned and looked
quizzically at his companion as he said this.Wales trembled slightly when he replied to the question he had been
awaiting."Parsons will vote for it," he said
suggestively.Ames, is committed to
the high tariff principle.We can not let in a flood of foreign
cotton--"

"Then you want the fight between the farmers and spinners to continue,
eh?""You don't seem to realize that in the
end both will get more money than they are getting now, and that it
will come from the consumer, who will pay vastly higher for his
finished products, in addition to the tariff.Ames," returned the congressman
tenaciously."Look here, Wales," said Ames, turning savagely upon his companion.Their
cooeperative associations must be smashed.The tariff schedule which
you have before your Committee will do it.Ames," replied the congressman, "I--I am opposed to the constant
manipulation of cotton by you rich men.I--"

"There," interrupted Ames, "never mind explaining your conscientious
scruples.What I want to know is, do you intend to cast your vote for
the unaltered schedule?"Ames, I can't--"

"H'm," murmured Ames.Then, with easy nonchalance, turning to an
apparently irrelevant topic as he gazed over the railing, "I heard
just before coming from my office this evening that the doors of the
Mercantile Trust would not open to-morrow.A lot of my
personal friends are heavily involved.Ames and Company will take over their tangible assets; I believe
you were interested, were you not?"He glanced at the trembling man
out of the corners of his eyes.His hands shook as he grasped the railing before
him and tried to steady himself."It--it--yes--very hard," murmured the dazed man.But step into the waiting room and 'phone the newspapers.Representative Wales was serving his first term in Congress.His
election had been a matter of surprise to everybody, himself included,
excepting Ames.Wales knew not that his detailed personal history had
been for many months carefully filed in the vaults of the Ames tower.Nor did he ever suspect that his candidacy and election had been
matters of most careful thought on the part of the great financier
and his political associates.But when he, a stranger to congressional
halls, was made a member of the Ways and Means Committee, his
astonishment overleaped all bounds.Then Ames had smiled his own
gratification, and arranged that the new member should attend the
formal opening of the great Ames palace later in the year.Meantime,
the financier and the new congressman had met on several occasions,
and the latter had felt no little pride in the attention which the
great man had shown him.And so the path to fame had unrolled steadily before the guileless
Wales until this night, when the first suspicions of his thraldom had
penetrated and darkened his thought.Then, like a crash from a clear
sky, had come the announcement of the Mercantile Trust failure.And as
he stood there now, clutching the marble railing, his thought busy
with the woman and the two fair children who would be rendered
penniless by this blow, the fell presence of the monster Ames seemed
to bend over him as the epitome of ruthless, brutal, inhuman cunning."How much are you likely to lose by this failure?""Not less than fifty thousand
dollars," he replied in a husky voice.stooping and apparently taking up an object that had
been lying on the floor back of the congressman.Wales took the book in a dazed, mechanical way."Why--I have no--this
is not mine," he murmured, gazing alternately at the pass book and at
Ames."Your name's on it, at least," commented Ames laconically."And the
book's been issued by our bank, Ames and Company.Guess you've
forgotten opening an account there, let me see, yes, a week ago."He
took the book and opened it."Ah, yes, I recall the incident now.The book, made out in his name on Ames
and Company, showed a deposit to his credit of fifty thousand
dollars!Ames slipped his arm through the confused congressman's, and started
with him down the balcony."You see," he said, as they moved away,
"the Mercantile failure will not hit you as hard as you thought.Now,
about that cotton schedule, when you cast your vote for it, be sure
that--" The voice died away as the men disappeared in the distance,
leaving Carmen and Haynerd staring blankly at each other."We must save them both," said Carmen quietly."I could make my everlasting fortune out of this!"exclaimed Haynerd
excitedly."And lose your soul," replied the girl.Ames, and
tell him that we overheard his conversation.Haynerd then smiled, but it was a hard smile, coming from one who knew
the world."Listen, my dear girl," he said, "we will keep quiet, you
and I. To mention this would be only to court disaster at the hands of
one who would strangle us at the slightest intimation of our
knowledge."I can see but the right," returned Carmen determinedly."But, my dear girl," cried Haynerd, now thoroughly alarmed both for
himself and her, "he would ruin us!We had
no intention of hearing; and so let it be as if we had not heard."Haynerd, I could not, if I
would.Ames is being used by evil; and it is making him a channel
to ruin Mr.Shall I stand idly by and permit it?She rose, with a look of fixed resolution on her face.Haynerd sprang
to his feet and laid a detaining hand upon her arm.As he did so, the
screen was quickly drawn aside, and Kathleen Ames and two of her young
companions bent their curious gaze in upon them.Absorbed in their
earnest conversation, Carmen and Haynerd had not heard the approach of
the young ladies, who were on a tour of inspection of the house before
supper."Reporters for the Social Era, Miss Ames," explained Haynerd, hastily
answering the unspoken question, while he made a courteous bow.she cried, instantly
recognizing Carmen, and drawing back.asked one of the young ladies, as her eyes roved
over Carmen's tense, motionless figure.cried Kathleen, spurting her venom at Carmen, while
her eyes snapped angrily and her hands twitched."When the front door
is closed against you, you sneak in through the back door!Leave this
house, instantly, or I shall have you thrown into the street!""She is a low, <DW64> wench!"She foisted herself upon society, and was discovered
and kicked out!Her father is a dirty <DW64> priest, and her mother a
low--"

Haynerd rushed to the maddened girl and clapped his hand over her
mouth."Hush, for God's sake, Miss Ames!"Then, to her companions,
"Take her away!"But a house detective, attracted by the loud conversation, had come up
and interposed."I can not put them out if they have his
permission to remain," he explained to the angry Kathleen.In a few moments, during which the little group stood tense and quiet,
Ames himself appeared.Daniel went to the garden.turning inquiringly to Haynerd.Her article in last week's Social Era was a corker.But,"
staring from Kathleen to the others, "what's the row?""I want that creature put out of the house!"demanded Kathleen,
trembling with rage and pointing to Carmen."Tut, tut," returned Ames easily."She's on business, and has my
permission to remain.that's a good joke," winking at
Haynerd and breaking into a loud laugh."You put one over on us there,
old man!"Scalding tears of anger and humiliation were streaming down
Kathleen's face."If she remains, I shall go--I shall leave the
house--I will not stay under the same roof with the lewd creature!""Very well, then, run along," said Ames, taking the humiliated
Kathleen by the shoulders and turning her about."I will settle this
without your assistance."Then he motioned to the house detectives to
depart, and turned to Haynerd and Carmen."Come in here," he said,
leading the way to the little waiting room, and opening the door.but you belong down stairs with the rest," he ejaculated as he
faced Carmen, standing before him pale but unafraid."There isn't one
down there who is in your class!"he exclaimed, placing his hands upon
her shoulders and looking down into her beautiful face."And," he
continued with sudden determination, "I am going to take you down, and
you will sit at the table with me, as my special guest!"A sudden fear gripped Haynerd, and he started to interpose.An expression of surprise and inquiry came into Ames's face."You mean Congressman--"

Then he stopped abruptly, and looked searchingly at Carmen and her
companion.Ames's expression
of surprise gave place to one dark and menacing."You were behind that screen when Congressman Wales and I--"

"Yes," returned Carmen calmly.Ames stood like a huge, black cloud, glowering down upon the slender
girl."You are going to tell him that the fifty thousand dollars are just a
loan, and that he may vote as he chooses, aren't you?""You
will not ruin his life, and the lives of his wife and babies, will
you?You would never be happy, you know, if you did."Her voice was as
quiet as the morning breeze."You come into my house to play spy, eh?And
if I had not caught you when I did you would have written another
interesting article for the Social Era, wouldn't you?I'll
break you, Haynerd, and your infernal sheet into a million pieces if
you dare print any such rot as this!And as for you, young lady--"

"You can do nothing to me, Mr.Ames; and you don't really want to,"
said Carmen quickly."My reputation, you know--that is, the one which
you people have given me--is just as black as it could be, isn't it?"It doesn't really make any
difference to you, Mr.Ames," she said, "whether the cotton schedule
is passed or not.You still have your millions--oh, so much more
than you will ever know what to do with!Wales, he has his
wife and his babies and his good reputation--would you rob him of
those priceless treasures, just to make a few dollars more for
yourself?--dollars that you can't spend, and that you won't let
others have?"During the girl's quiet talk Ames was regaining his self-control.When
she concluded he turned to Haynerd."Miss Carmen can step out into the
balcony.You and I will arrange this matter together," he said."Now," said Ames significantly, and in a low voice, "what's your
price?"Instantly the girl turned back and threw herself between the two men.she cried, her eyes flashing as she confronted
Ames.shouted Ames, who had lost himself completely, "I will
crush him like a dirty spider!And you, I'll drag you through the
gutters and make your name a synonym of all that is vile in
womanhood!"Carmen stepped quietly to the elevator and pressed the signal button.cried the enraged Ames, starting
toward her.The girl drew herself up with splendid dignity, and faced him
fearlessly."We _shall_ leave your house, and now, Mr."You and that for which you stand can not touch us!The carnal
mind is back of you!She moved away from him, then turned and stood for a moment, flashing,
sparkling, radiant with a power which he could not comprehend.You are blinded and deceived by human lust and
greed.But the god you so ignorantly worship now will some day totter
and fall upon you.Then you will awake, and you will see your present
life as a horrid dream."Carmen and the dazed Haynerd stepped quickly
into it and descended without opposition to the lower floor.A few
moments later they were again in the street and hurrying to the
nearest car line."Girlie," said Haynerd, mopping the perspiration from his brow, "we're
in for it now--and I shall be crushed!But you--I think your God will
save you.""His arm is not shortened," she murmured, "that
He can not save us both."CHAPTER 5

ON the Monday morning following the Ames reception the society columns
of the daily papers still teemed with extravagant depictions of the
magnificent affair.On that same morning, while Haynerd sat gloomily
in the office of the Social Era, meditating on his giant adversary's
probable first move, Carmen, leaving her studies and classes, sought
out an unpretentious home in one of the suburbs of the city, and for
an hour or more talked earnestly with the timid, frightened little
wife of Congressman Wales.Then, her work done, she dismissed the
whole affair from her mind, and hastened joyously back to the
University."But," she
reflected, as she dwelt on his conduct and words of the previous
Saturday evening, "he is not ready for it yet.And when he is, I will
go to him.And Kathleen--well, I will help her by seeing only the real
child of God, which was hidden that night by the veil of hatred and
jealousy.And that veil, after all, is but a shadow."That evening the little group of searchers after God assembled again
in the peaceful precincts of the Beaubien cottage.It was their third
meeting, and they had come together reverently to pursue the most
momentous inquiry that has ever stimulated human thought.Haynerd and Carmen had said little relative to the Ames reception; but
the former, still brooding over the certain consequences of his brush
with Ames, was dejected and distraught.Carmen, leaning upon her
sustaining thought, and conceding no mite of power or intelligence to
evil, glowed like a radiant star.she asked of Haynerd, drawing him to one
side."Are you giving ear to the voices of evil, or good?For those thoughts which are real to you
will become outwardly manifested, you know."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture signifying
defeat."And the insults of that arrogant daughter of his--"

"She did not insult me," said Carmen quickly."She could not, for she
doesn't know me.She merely denounced her concept of me, and not my
real self.She vilified what she thought was Carmen Ariza; but it was
only her own thought of me that she insulted.And such
a concept of me as she holds deserves denouncing, doesn't it?""Well, what are we going to do?""We are going to know," she whispered, "that we two with God
constitute an overwhelming majority."She said nothing about her visit
to the Wales home that morning, but pressed his hand, and then went to
take her place at the table, where Father Waite was already rapping
for order."My friends," began that earnest young man, looking lovingly about at
the little group, "as we are gathered here we symbolize that
analytical, critical endeavor of the unbiased human mind to discover
the essence of religion.Religion is that which binds us to absolute
truth, and so is truth itself.If there is a God, we believe from our
former investigations that He must be universal mind.This belief
carries with it as necessary corollaries the beliefs that He must be
perfect, eternal, and self-existent.must
then receive its sufficient answer in the staggering statement that He
has always existed, unchanged and unchangeable."A sigh from Haynerd announced that quizzical soul's struggle to grasp
a statement at once so radical and stupendous."True," continued Father Waite, addressing himself to his doubting
friend, "the acceptance as fact of what we have deduced in our
previous meetings must render the God of orthodox theology quite
obsolete.But, as a compensation, it gives to us the most enlarged and
beautiful concept of Him that we have ever had.It ennobles, broadens,
purifies, and elevates our idea of Him.It destroys forever our
belittling view of Him as but a magnified human character, full of
wrath and caprice and angry threats, and delighting in human
ceremonial and religious thaumaturgy.And, most practical of all for
us, it renders the age-long problem of evil amenable to solution."Just then came a ring at the front door; and a moment later the
Beaubien ushered Doctor Morton into the room.All rose and hastened to
welcome him."I--I am sure," began the visitor, looking at Carmen, "that I am not
intruding, for I really come on invitation, you know.Miss Carmen,
first; and then, our good friend Hitt, who told me this afternoon that
you would probably meet this evening.I--I pondered the matter some
little time--ah, but--well, to make it short, I couldn't keep away
from a gathering so absolutely unique as this--I really couldn't."she exclaimed, her eyes dancing,
"I am glad you came.""And I, too," interposed Haynerd dryly, "for now we have two
theological Philistines."Ah, my friend," replied the doctor, "I am simply an advocate of
religious freedom, not a--"

"And religious freedom, as our wise Bill Nye once said, is but the art
of giving intolerance a little more room, eh?"returned Haynerd with a
laugh."You are a Philistine," he said.Carmen took the doctor by the arm and led him to a place beside her at
the table."You--you didn't bring poor Yorick?"she whispered, with a
glint of mischief in her bright eyes."No," laughed the genial visitor, "he's a dead one, you told me.""Yes," replied the girl, "awfully dead!He is an outward manifestation
of dead human beliefs, isn't he?But now listen, Father Waite is going
to speak."After a brief explanation to the doctor of the purpose of the
meeting, and a short resume of their previous deductions, Father Waite
continued the exposition of his subject."The physical universe," he said, "is to human beings a reality.And
yet, according to Spencer's definition of reality, we must admit that
the universe as we see it is quite unreal.For the real is that which
endures.""And you mean to say that the universe will not endure?""The phenomena of the universe, even as
we see it, are in a state of ceaseless change.Birth, growth,
maturity, decay, and death seems to be the law for all things
material."But," again urged Haynerd, "matter itself remains, is indestructible.""Our friend, Doctor Morton, will
corroborate my statement, I am sure.""It is quite true," he said in reply.The discovery, in the past few years, of the
tremendously important fact that matter disintegrates and actually
disappears, has revolutionized all physical science and rendered the
world's text books obsolete.""The radium atom, we find, lasts some
seventeen hundred years, or a trifle longer.What becomes of it when
it is destroyed?We can only say that it disappears from human
consciousness.""And so you reason that the whole material universe will ultimately
disappear from the human consciousness?""Yes," returned Hitt, "I feel certain of it.Let us consider of what
the universe consists.For many months I have been pondering this
topic incessantly.I find that I can agree, in a measure, with those
scientists who regard the physical universe as composed of only a few
elementary constituents, namely, matter, energy, space, and time--"

"Each one of these elements is mental," interrupted Carmen."And the physical universe, even from the
human standpoint, is, therefore, wholly mental.""No," interposed Father Waite; "we see only our mental concept of a
universe, for seeing is wholly a mental process."But now," resumed Hitt, "to get back to the supposed reality of the
physical universe, let us examine its constituents.First, let us
consider its unity established by the harmonious interplay of the
forces permeating it.This great fact is what led Herbert Spencer to
conclude that the universe could have but one creator, one ruler, and
that polytheism was untenable.""We are quite agreed regarding that," said Father Waite."If the
Creator is mind, He is of very necessity infinite and omnipotent;
hence there can be but one Creator."Would it exist, but as a convenience for the human mind?Is
it not really a creation of that mind?And, lastly, is it not merely a
mental concept?""Our consciousness of time," replied Carmen, "is only our awareness of
a continuous series of mental states.""That classifies it exactly," said Hitt, "and renders it wholly
mental."We are accustomed to say,
loosely, that space is that in which we see things about us.But in
what does the process of seeing consist?What I
really mean is that I am conscious of a chair.The process of seeing,
we are told, is this: light, coming from the chair, enters the eye and
casts an image of the chair upon the retina, much as a picture is
thrown upon the ground glass of a camera.Then, in some way, the
little rods and cones--the branching tips of the optic nerve which
project from the retina--are set in motion by the light-waves.This
vibration is in some mysterious manner carried along the optic nerve
to a center in the brain, and--well, then the mind becomes cognizant
of the chair out there, that's all.""Do you mean
to say," she queried, "that, after thousands of years of thought and
investigation, mankind now know nothing more than that about the
process of seeing?""Then all I've got to say," put in Haynerd, "is that the most
remarkable thing about you learned men is your ignorance!""I find it is only the fool who is cocksure," he
replied."Now," said Hitt, resuming the conversation, "let us go a step further
and inquire, first, What is light?since the process of seeing is
absolutely dependent upon it.""Light," offered the doctor, "is vibrations, or wave-motion, so
physicists tell us.""Light, we say, consists of vibrations.Not
vibrations of anything tangible or definitely material, but--well,
just vibrations in the abstract.Now
let us concede that these vibrations in some way get to the brain
center; and then let us ask, Is the mind there, in the brain, awaiting
the arrival of these vibrations to inform it that there is a chair
outside?"Haynerd indulged in a cynical laugh."It is too serious for laughter, my friend," said Hitt."For to such
crude beliefs as this we may attribute all the miseries of mankind.""Simply because these beliefs constitute the general belief in a
universe of matter without and about us.As a plain statement of fact,
_there is no such thing_.But, I ask again, Is the mind within the
brain, waiting for vibrations that will give it information concerning
the external world?Or does the mind, from some focal point without
the brain, look first at these vibrations, and then translate them
into terms of things without?Do these vibrations in some way suggest
form and color and substance to the waiting mind?Does the mind first
look at vibrating nerve-points, and then form its own opinions
regarding material objects?"No," admitted the doctor; "unless we believe that vibrations _per se_
are material.""Now I ask, Is the mind reduced to such slavery that it must depend
upon vibrations for its knowledge of an outside world?""And vibrations of minute pieces of flesh, at that!Flesh that
will some day decay and leave the mind helpless!""Why doesn't the mind look directly at
the chair, instead of getting its knowledge of the chair through
vibrations of bits of meat?Or isn't there any chair out there to look
at?""Now you've put your mental finger upon it.And now we are ready to nail to the cross of ignominy one of the
crudest, most insensate beliefs of the human race._The human mind
gets nothing whatsoever from vibrations, from the human, fleshly eye,
nor from any one of the five so-called physical senses!_ The physical
sense-testimony which mankind believe they receive from the eyes, the
ears, and the other sense organs, can, even at best, consist only of a
lot of disconnected, unintelligible vibrations; and anything that the
mind may infer from such vibrations is inferred _without any outside
authority whatsoever!ejaculated Miss Wall and Haynerd in a breath."And, further," continued Hitt, "we are forced to admit that all that
the mind knows is the contents of itself, of its own consciousness,
and nothing more.Then, instead of seeing, hearing, and feeling real
material objects outside of ourselves, we are in reality seeing,
hearing, and feeling our own mental concepts of things--in other
words, _our own thoughts of things!"_

A deep silence lay for some moments over the little group at the
conclusion of Hitt's words.Then Doctor Morton nodded his acquiescence
in the deduction."And that," he said, "effectually disposes of the
question of space.""There is no space, Doctor," replied Hitt.The human mind sees, hears, and feels nothing but its own
thoughts.These it posits within itself with reference to one another,
and calls the process'seeing material objects in space.'The mind as
little needs a space in which to see things as in which to dream them.I repeat, we do not see external things, or things outside of
ourselves.We see always and only the thoughts that are within our own
mentalities."That's why," murmured Carmen, "Jesus said, 'The kingdom of heaven is
within you.'""Did he not call evil, and all that originates
in matter, the lie about God?I tell you,
the existence of a world outside of ourselves, an objective world
composed of matter, is wholly inferred--it is mental visualizing--and
it is unreal, for it is not based upon fact, upon truth!""Then," queried Haynerd, "our supposed 'outer world' is but our
collection of thought-concepts which we hold within us, within our own
consciousness, eh?""We are ready for that again," replied Hitt."We have said that in the
physical universe all is in a state of incessant change.Since the
physical universe is but a mental concept to each one of us, we must
admit that, were the concept based upon truth, it would not change.Our concept of the universe must be without the real causative and
sustaining principle of all reality, else would it not pass away.And
yet, beneath and behind all these changes, _something_ endures.There is an enduring substance, invisible to human
sight, but felt and known through its own influence.But none of these things is in any sense
material.The material is the fleeting, human concept, composed of
thought that is _not_ based upon reality.These other things, wholly
mental, or spiritual, if you prefer, are based upon that'something'
which does endure, and which I will call the Causative Principle."I think," interposed Doctor Morton at this juncture, "that I can
throw some light upon the immaterial character of matter, if I may so
put it; for even our physical reasoning throws it entirely into the
realm of the mental."The doctor sat for some moments in a deep study.Then he began:

"The constitution of matter, speaking now from an admittedly
materialistic standpoint, that of the physical sciences, is a subject
of vastest interest and importance to mankind, for human existence
_is_ material."The ultimate constituent of matter has been called the atom.But we
have said little when we have said that.The atom was once defined as
a particle of matter so minute as to admit of no further division.That definition has gone to the rubbish heap, for the atom can now be
torn to pieces.But--and here is the revolutionary fact in modern
physical science--_it is no longer held necessary that matter should
consist of material particles!_ In fact, the great potential discovery
of our day is that matter is electrical in composition, that it is
composed of what are called 'electrons,' and that these electrons are
themselves composed of electric charges.It is without weight, bulk, dimensions, or
tangibility.Well, then, it comes dangerously near being a mental
thing, known to the human mind solely by its manifestations, does it
not?And of course our comprehension of it is entirely mental, as is
our comprehension of everything."He paused for a moment, that his words might be fully grasped.Then he
went on:

"Now these atoms, whatever they are, are supposed to join together to
form molecules.Why, it is--well, law, if you please.Then, going a step further,
molecules are held together by cohesion to form material objects,
chairs, trees, coal, and the like."But, Doctor--" interrupted Haynerd."Now we
have the very latest word from our physical scientists regarding the
constitution of matter: _it is composed of electric charges, held
together by law._ Again, you may justly ask: Is matter material--or
mental?"He paused again, and took up a book that lay before him."Here," he continued, "I hold a solid, material, lumpy thing,
composed, you will say, of matter.And yet, in essence, and if we can
believe our scientists, this book is composed of billions of electric
charges--invisible things, without form, without weight, without
color, without extension, held together by law, and making up a
material object which has mass, color, weight, and extension.From
millions of things which are invisible and have no size, we get an
object, visible and extended.""Yet, the doctor is giving the very latest
deductions of the great scientists.""But, Doctor," said Father Waite, "the scientists tell us that they
have experimental evidence in support of the theories which you have
stated regarding the composition of matter.Electricity has been
proven granular, or atomic, in structure.And every electrical
charge consists of an exact number of electrical atoms spread out
over the surface of the charged body."Admitted," said Hitt, taking up the challenge."And their very
calculations and deductions are rapidly wearing away the'materialistic
theory' of matter.You will admit that mathematics is wholly
confined to the realm of mind.It is a strictly mental science, in no
way material.It loses definiteness when 'practically' applied to
material objects.Kant saw this, and declared that a science might be
regarded as further removed from or nearer to perfection in proportion
to the amount of mathematics it contained.Now there has been an
astonishing confirmation of this great truth just lately.At a banquet
given in honor of the discoverer of wireless telegraphy it was stated
that the laws governing the traversing of space by the invisible
electric waves were more exact than the general laws of physics,
where very complex formulas and coefficients are required for
correcting the general laws, due to surrounding material conditions.The greater exactness of laws governing the invisible electric waves
was said to be due to the absence of matter.And it was further
stated that _whenever matter had to be taken into consideration there
could be no exact law of action!"That matter admits of no definite laws," replied Hitt."That there
are no real laws of matter.And that definiteness is attained only as
we dematerialize matter itself.""In other words, get into the realm of the mental?"I have said that we do not
receive any testimony whatsoever through the so-called material
senses, but that we see, hear, feel, taste, and smell our own
thoughts--that is, the thoughts which, from some source, come into our
mentalities.Very well, our scientists show us that, as they get
farther away from dense material thoughts, and deal more and more with
those which have less material structure, less material composition,
their laws become more definite, more exact.Following this out to its
ultimate conclusion, we may say, then, that _only those laws which
have to do with the non-material are perfect_.""And those," said Carmen, "are the laws of mind."And now the history of physical science shows that there has
been a constant deviation from the old so-called fixed 'laws of
matter.'The law of impenetrability has had to go.A great physicist
tells us that, when dealing with sufficiently high speeds, matter has
no such property as impenetrability.The law of indestructibility has had to go.Matter deteriorates and
goes to pieces.The decided
tendency of belief is toward a single element, of which all matter is
composed, and of which the eighty-odd constituent elements of matter
accepted to-day are but modifications.That unit element may be the
ether, of course.And the great Russian chemist, Mendeleef, so
believed.But to us, the ether is a mental thing, a theory.But,
granting its existence, _its universal penetrability renders matter,
as we know it, non-existent_.Everything reduces to the ether, in the
final analysis.And all energy becomes vibrations in and of the
ether.""And the ether," supplemented the doctor, "has to be without mass,
invisible, tasteless, intangible, much more rigid than steel, and at
the same time some six hundred billion times lighter than air, in
order to fulfill all the requirements made of it and to meet all
conditions.""Yes; and yet the ether is a very necessary theory, if we are going to
continue to explain the phenomena of force on a material basis.""Then," said Carmen, "matter reduces to what it really is, the human
mind's _interpretation_ of substance.""Yes," said Hitt, turning to her; "I think you are right; matter is
the way real substance--let us say, spirit--looks to the human
mentality.It is the way the human mind interprets its ideas of
spirit.In other words, the human mind looks at the material thoughts
and ideas which enter it, and calls them solid substance, occupying
space--calls them matter, with definite laws, and, in certain forms,
containing life and intelligence.""And that has been the terrible
mistake of the ages, the one great error, the one lie, that has caused
us all to miss the mark and come short, far short, of the glory of the
mind that is God._There is the origin of the problem of evil!_"

"Undoubtedly," replied Hitt."For evil is in essence but evil thought.The origin of
all evil is matter itself.And matter, we find, is but a mental
concept, a thing of thought."Well," put in Haynerd, who had been twitching nervously in his chair,
"let's get to the conclusion of this very learned discussion.I'm a
plain man, and I'd like to know just where we've landed.What have you
said that I can take home with me?The earth still revolves around the
sun, even if it is a mean mud ball.And I can't see that I can get
along with less than three square meals a day.""We have arrived," replied Hitt gravely, "at a most momentous
conclusion, deduced by the physical scientists themselves, namely,
that _things are not what they seem_.In other words, all things
material seem to reduce to vibrations in and of the ether; the basis
of all materiality is energy, motion, activity--mental things.All the
elements of matter seem to be but modifications of one all-pervading
element.That element is probably the ether, often called the'mother
of matter.'The elements, such as carbon, silicon, and the others, are
not elementary at all, but are forms of one universal element, the
ether.The so-called rare elements are
rare only because their lives are short.They disintegrate rapidly and
change into other forms of the universal element--or disappear.'Atoms
are but fleeting phases of matter,' we are told.They are by no means
eternal, even though they may endure for millions of years.""A great scientist of our own day," Hitt continued, "has said that
'the ether is so modified as to constitute matter, in some way.'Simply that 'visible matter and invisible ether are
one and the same thing.'But to the five so-called physical senses the
ether is utterly incomprehensible.So, then, matter is wholly
incomprehensible to the five physical senses.What is it, then, that
we call matter?It can be nothing more than the human mind's
interpretation of its idea of an all-pervading, omnipresent
_something_, a something which represents substance to it.""Let me add a further quotation from the great physical scientist to
whom you have referred," said the doctor."He has said that the ether
is _not_ matter, but that it is material.And further, that we can not
deny that the ether may have some mental and spiritual functions to
subserve in some other order of existence, as matter has in this.It
is wholly unrelated to any of our senses.The sense of sight takes
cognizance of it, but only in a very indirect and not easily
recognized way.And yet--stupendous conclusion!--_without the ether
there could be no material universe at all_!""In other words," said Hitt, "the whole fabric of the material
universe depends upon something utterly unrecognizable by the five
physical senses.""Then," concluded Hitt, "the physical senses give us no information
whatsoever of a real physical universe about us.""And so," added Father Waite, "we come back to Carmen's statement,
namely, that seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling are
mental processes, in no way dependent upon the outer fleshly organs of
sense--"

"Nonsense!""Why is it, then, that if the eyes
are destroyed we do not see?""Simply, my friend, because of human belief," replied Hitt."The human
mind has been trained for untold centuries to dependence upon beliefs
in the reality of matter, and beliefs in its dependence upon material
modes for sight, hearing, touch, and so on.It is because of its
erroneous beliefs that the human mind is to-day enslaved by matter,
and dependent upon it for its very sense of existence.The human mind
has made its sense of sight dependent upon a frail, pulpy bit of
flesh, the eye.As long as that fleshly organ remains intact, the
human mind sees its sense of sight externalized in the positing of its
mental concepts about it as natural objects.But let that fleshly eye
be destroyed, and the human mind sees its belief of dependence upon
the material eye externalized as blindness.When the fleshly eye is
gone the mind declares that it can no longer see.And what it declares
as truth, as fact, becomes externalized to it.I repeat, the human
mind sees and hears only its thoughts, its beliefs.And holding to
these beliefs, and making them real to itself, it eventually sees them
externalized in what it calls its outer world, its environment, its
universe.And yet, the materialistic scientists themselves show that
the human mind can take no cognizance whatever through the five
physical senses of the all-pervading basis of its very existence, the
ether.it is but a theory which we find necessary
for any intelligible explanation of the farce of human existence on a
material basis."retorted Haynerd, rising and giving expression to his
protest by means of emphatic gestures.You
tell me that the existence of things demands a creator, and I admit
it, for there can be no effect without a cause.Then you say that the
universe is infinite; and I admit that, too, for the science of
astronomy finds no limits to space, and no space unoccupied.You say
that the unity manifested in the universe proves that there can be but
one creator.Moreover, to create an infinite universe there must needs
be an omnipotent creator; and there can be but one who is omnipotent.Further, I can see how that creator must be
mind--infinite mind.And I can see why that mind must be absolutely
perfect, with no intelligence of evil whatsoever, else would it be a
house divided against itself.Now I admit that the universe must be the manifestation, the
expression, of that infinite creative mind.But--and here's the
sticking point--the universe is both good and evil!Hence, the mind
which it manifests is likewise both good and evil--and the whole
pretty theory blows up!"He sat down abruptly, with the air of having given finality to a
perplexing question.All eyes then turned to Carmen, who slowly rose and surveyed the
little group."It is not surprising," she said, smiling at the confused Haynerd,
"that difficulties arise when you attempt to reach God through human
reasoning--spirit through matter.You have taken the unreal, and,
through it, have sought to reach back to the real.""Well," interrupted Haynerd testily, "kindly explain the difference.""Then, first," replied Carmen, "let us adopt some common meeting
ground, some basis which we can all accept, and from which we can
rise.Are you all agreed that, in our every-day life, everything is
mental?--every action?--every object?--and that, as the philosopher
Mill said, 'Everything is a feeling of which the mind is conscious'?Let me illustrate my meaning," she continued, noting Haynerd's rising
protest."I see this book; I take it up; and drop it upon the table.No; I have been conscious of thoughts which
I call a book, nothing more.A real material book did not get into my
mind; but _thoughts_ of a book did.And the activity of such thought
resulted in a state of consciousness--for consciousness is mental
activity, the activity of thought.Remember that, even according to
your great physical scientists, this book is composed of millions of
charges of electricity, or electrons, moving at a tremendously high
rate of speed.And yet, regardless of its composition, I am conscious
only of my thoughts of the book.It is but my thoughts that I see,
after all."She paused and waited for the protest which was not voiced."Very well," she said, continuing; "so it is with the sense of touch;
I had the thought of touching it, and that thought I saw; I was
conscious of it when it became active in my mentality.So with sound;
when I let the book drop, I was conscious of my thought of sound.If
the book had been dropped in a vacuum I should not have been conscious
of a thought of sound--why?Hitt has told us, the
human mind has made its sense-testimony dependent upon vibrations.And
yet, there is a clock ticking up there on the wall."Yes," replied Haynerd; "now that you've called my attention to it.""You hear it when your thought is
directed to it.And yet the air was vibrating all the time, and, if
hearing is dependent upon the fleshly ear, you should have heard it
incessantly when you were not thinking of it, as well as you hear it
now when you are thinking of it."Well, perhaps so," assented Haynerd with some reluctance."We hear, see, and feel," continued the girl, "when our thought is
directed to these processes.And the processes are wholly mental--they
take place within our mentalities--and it is there, within our minds,
that we see, hear, and feel _all_ things.And it is there, within our
minds, that the universe exists for us.It is there that we hold our
world, our fleshly bodies, everything that we call material._The
universe that we think we see all about us consists of the mental
concepts, made up of thought, which we hold within our mentalities_."Carmen proceeded with the
exposition of her theme."Whence come these material thoughts that are within us?They are real to us, at any rate,
are they not?And if they are thoughts of pain and suffering and
death, they are terribly real to us.But let us see, now that we can
reason from the basis of the mental nature of all things.We have
agreed that the creative principle is mind, and we call it God.This
infinite mind constantly expresses and manifests itself in ideas.Why,
that is a fundamental law of mind!You express yourself in your ideas
and thoughts, which you try to externalize materially.But the
infinite mind expresses itself in an infinite number and variety of
ideas, all, like itself, pure, perfect, eternal, good, without any
elements or seeds of decay or discord.And the incessant expression of
the creative mind in and through its numberless ideas constitutes the
never-ending process of creation.""Let me add here," interrupted Hitt, "that the Bible states that God
created the heavens and earth in seven days.But numbers, we must
remember, were mystical things to the ancient Hebrews, and were
largely used symbolically.The number seven, for example, was used to
express wholeness, completeness.So we must remember that its use in
Genesis has a much wider meaning than its absurd theological
interpretation into seven solar days.As Carmen says, the infinite
creative mind can never cease to express itself; creation can never
cease; and creation is but the whole, complete revelation or
unfoldment of infinite mind's ideas.""And infinite mind," continued Carmen, "requires infinite time in
which to completely express itself.So time ceases to be, and we find
that all real things exist now, in an endless present.Now, the ideas
of infinite mind range throughout the realm of infinity, but the
greatest idea that the creative mind can have is the idea of itself.That idea is the image and likeness of the infinite creative mind.It
is the perfect reflection of that mind--its perfect expression.That
idea is what the man Jesus always saw back of the human concept of
man."That's quite a different proposition from
the mud-men that I do business with daily."If they were real," said Carmen, "they would have to be children of
God.But then they would not be'mud-men.'Now I have just spoken of
the real, the spiritual creation.That is the creation mentioned in
the first chapter of Genesis, where all was created--revealed,
unfolded--by God, and He saw that it was perfect, good.'In the
beginning,' says the commentator.That is, 'To begin with--God.'Everything begins with God in the realm of the real.And the creation, or unfoldment, is like its creative
principle, eternal and good.""But," persisted Haynerd, "how about the material man?""Having created all things spiritually," continued the girl, "was it
necessary that the creative mind should repeat its work, do it over
again, and produce the man of dust described in the second chapter of
Genesis?Is that second account of the creation an inspiration of
truth--or a human comment?""Call it what you will," said the cynical Haynerd; "the fact remains
that the mud-man exists and has to be reckoned with.""Both of your premises are wholly incorrect," returned the girl
gently."He does _not_ exist, excepting in human, mortal thought.He
is a product of only such thought.He and his material universe are
seen and dealt with only in such thought.And such thought is the
direct antithesis of God's thought.It is
the supposition, the lie, the mist that went up and darkened the
earth.""Is just what you have said, a hue of a man, a dark hue, the shadowy
opposite which seems to counterfeit the real, spiritual man and claim
all his attributes.He is not a compound of mind and matter, for we
have seen that all things are mental, even matter itself.He is a sort
of mentality, a counterfeit of real mind.His body and his universe
are in himself.And, like all that is unreal, he is transient,
passing, ephemeral, mortal.""No, for he does not exist, excepting in supposition.If so, then not even truth can destroy it.No, the human mind is the
'old man' of Paul.He is to be put off by knowing his nothingness, and
by knowing the unreality of his supposed material environment and
universe.As he goes out of consciousness, the real man, the idea of
God, perfect, harmonious, and eternal, comes in.""And there," said Father Waite impressively, "you have the whole
scheme of salvation, as enunciated by the man Jesus.""There is no doubt of it," added Hitt.how
futile, how base, how worse than childish now appear the whole
theological fabric of the churches, their foolish man-made dogmas,
their insensate beliefs in a fiery hell and a golden heaven.Oh, how
belittling now appear their concepts of God--a God who can damn
unbaptised infants, who can predestine his children to eternal sorrow,
who creates and then curses his handiwork!Do you wonder that sin,
sorrow, and death remain among us while such awful beliefs hold sway
over the human mind?Haynerd, who had been sitting quietly for some moments, deep in
thought, rose and held out his hands, as if in entreaty.It seems--it seems as if a curtain had been raised suddenly.And what I
see beyond is--"

Carmen went swiftly to the man and slipped an arm about him."That
infinite creative Mind, so misunderstood and misinterpreted by human
beings, is back of you," she whispered."But had I not seen the proof in you, no amount of reasoning would
have convinced me."And, bowing to the little group, he went out.said Hitt, turning inquiringly to the doctor."If these things are true," he made answer
slowly, "then I shall have to recast my entire mentality, my whole
basis of thinking.""It is just what you _must_ do, Doctor, if you would work out your
salvation," said Carmen."Jesus said we must repent if we would be
saved.Repentance--the Greek _metanoia_--means a complete and radical
change of thought.""But--do you mean to say that the whole world has been mistaken?That
the entire human race has been deceived for ages?""Why," said Hitt, "it was only in our own day, comparatively speaking,
that the human race was undeceived in regard to the world being round.And there are thousands of human beings to-day who still believe in
witchcraft, and who worship the sun and moon, and whose lives are
wholly under the spell of superstition.Human character, a great
scientist tells us, has not changed since history began.""But we can't revamp our thought-processes!""Then we must go on missing the mark, sinning, suffering, sorrowing,
and dying, over and over and over again, until we decide that we can
do so," said Hitt.The doctor looked at Carmen and met that same smile of unbounded love
which she gave without stint to a sin-weary world."I--I'll come again," he said."Yes," said Carmen, rising and coming around to him."And," in a
whisper, "bring Pat."CHAPTER 6


The Social Era had for many years made its weekly appearance every
Saturday morning, that its fashionable clientele might appease their
jaded appetites on the Sabbath day by nibbling at its spicy pabulum.But, though the Ames reception had fallen on a Saturday night, the
following Friday morning found the columns of the Era still awaiting
a report of the notable affair.Whenever he set his pen to the task, there loomed before him only the
scene in the little waiting room, and he could write of nothing else.He found himself still dwelling upon the awful contrast between the
slender wisp of a girl and her mountainous opponent, as they had stood
before him; and the terrifying thoughts of what was sure to follow in
consequence drenched his skin with cold perspiration.On the desk before him lay the essay which he had asked Carmen to
write during the week, as her report of the brilliant event.He had
read it through three times, and each time had read into it a new
meaning.Not that it ridiculed or condemned--at
least, not openly--but because every one of its crisp comments
admitted of an interpretation which revealed the hidden depths of the
social system, and its gigantic incarnation, as if under the glare of
a powerful searchlight.It was in no sense a muck-raking exposition.Rather, it was an interpretation, and a suggestion.It was, too, a
prediction; but not a curse.The girl loved those about whom she
wrote.And yet, he who read the essay aright would learn that her love
stopped not at the flimsy veil of the flesh, but penetrated until it
rested upon the fair spiritual image beyond.And then Haynerd saw that
the essay was, in substance, a social clinic, to which all searchers
after truth were bidden, that they might learn a great lesson from her
skillful dissection of the human mind, and her keen analysis of its
constituent thought.As he sat wrapped in reflection, the early morning mail was brought
in.He glanced up, and then started to his feet.The letters spread
over his desk like an avalanche of snow; and the puffing mail carrier
declared that he had made a special trip with them alone.Haynerd
began to tear them open, one after another.Then he called the office
boy, and set him at the task.There were more than five hundred of
them, and each contained a canceled subscription to the Social Era.A dark foreboding settled down over Haynerd's mind.He rose and went
to the card-index to consult his subscription list.He
stood confusedly for a moment, then hastened to the window that looked
out upon a fire-escape.He turned
and rushed to the vault, which, reflecting his own habitual
carelessness, was never locked.His ledgers and account books were not
there.Then he crept back to his desk and sank into a chair.The noon mail brought more letters of like nature, until the office
boy tallied nearly eight hundred.Then Haynerd, as if rousing from a
dream, reached for the telephone and summoned Hitt to his rescue.Its mailing list had contained some
fifteen hundred names.The subscription price was twelve dollars a
year--and never, to his knowledge, had it been paid in advance by his
ultra-rich patrons, most of whom were greatly in arrears.Haynerd saw
it all vanishing now as quietly as the mist fades before the summer
sun.Within an hour the wondering Hitt was in conference with him, and
Haynerd had told the story of the theft, of the Ames bribe, and the
encounter following."But," he cried, "can Ames kill my entire
subscription list, and in a single week?""Easily," replied Hitt, "and in any one of several ways.Apparently he
had caused your subscription list and books to be stolen.Or, rather, Ames has lifted it bodily from the sky."Carmen
and I saw him bribe Wales!"Forget all that," he said, laying a hand on the excited
man's arm."Remember, that Wales would never dare breathe a word of
it; Carmen has no reputation or standing whatsoever now in this city;
and Ames would make out a case of blackmail against you so quickly
that it would sweep you right into the Tombs.And first, let
us get the girl herself down here."He took the telephone and called up several of the University
departments, after first ascertaining that she was not at her home.Then, having located her, he plunged into a study of the situation
with the distracted publisher."Here I waste my
evenings in learned philosophical discussions with you people, and
meantime, while we're figuring out that there is no evil, that
monster, Ames, stretches out a tentacle and strangles me!Fine
practical discussions we've been having, ain't they?I tell you, I'm
through with 'em!"He brought his fist down upon the desk with a
crash."Ned," said Hitt, "you're a fool."Here I had a nice, clean
business, no work, good pay--and, just because I associated with you
and that girl, the whole damn thing goes up the flue!Pays to be good,
doesn't it?"H'm; well, Ned, you're not only a fool, but a blooming idiot,"
replied Hitt calmly."And if you run out of
epithets, I'll supply a few!I'm a--"

The door swung open, and Carmen entered, fresh as the sea breeze, and
panting with her haste."Do you know," she began eagerly, "two men
followed me all the way down from the University!They watched me
come in here, and--but, what is wrong with you two?"She stopped and
looked inquiringly from one to the other."Well," began Hitt hesitatingly, "we were reflecting--"

"Reflecting?"We were just holding a wake, that's all," muttered Haynerd.Hitt pushed out a chair for the girl, and bade her sit down.Then he
briefly related the events which had led to her being summoned."And
now," he concluded, "the question is, does Wales know that you and Ned
saw Ames try to bribe him?""I did--last Monday morning, early," answered the wondering girl.ejaculated Haynerd, turning upon Hitt and waving
his arms about."What do you--"

"Hold your tongue, Ned!"Then, to Carmen, "Why did
you tell her?""Why--to save her, and her husband, and babies!"But, to save them, you have ruined Ned," pursued Hitt.The girl turned to Haynerd, who sat doubled up in his chair, the
picture of despair.It was the first time
she had used this name in addressing him.And if you have been pushed out of this business, it is because
it isn't fit for you, and because you've been awakened.You are for
higher, better things than the publishing of such a magazine as the
Social Era.I knew you just couldn't stay at this work.You have got
to go up--"

"Eh!"Haynerd had roused out of his torpor.Yes, I've gone up,
nicely!And I was making ten thousand dollars a year out of it!"I wasn't speaking of money," she said."When I talk, it's in dollars and
cents!""And that's why your talk is mostly nonsense," put in Hitt."The
girl's right, I guess.You've stagnated here long enough, Ned.There's
no such thing as standing still."You now have a grand opportunity," said Carmen, taking his hand."Yes; every trial in this life is an opportunity to prove that there
is no evil," she said."Listen; you have been trained as a publisher.Very well, the world is waiting for the right kind of publications.Oh, I've seen it for a long, long time.The demand is simply
tremendous.Haynerd looked confusedly from Carmen to Hitt."What, exactly, do you mean, Carmen?""Let him publish now a clean magazine, or paper; let him print real
news; let him work, not for rich people's money, but for all people.Why, the press is the greatest educator in the world!But, oh, how it
has been abused!Now let him come out boldly and stand for clean
journalism.Let him find his own life, his own good, in service for
others.""But, Carmen," protested Hitt, "do the people want clean journalism?"It could, if it had the right thought back of it," returned the
confident girl.Haynerd had again lapsed into sulky silence.But Hitt pondered the
girl's words for some moments.She was not the first nor the only one
who had voiced such sentiments.He himself had even dared to hold the
same thoughts, and to read in them a leading that came not from
material ambitions.Then, of a sudden, an idea flamed up in his mind.Hitt's eyes widened with his expanding
thought."Carlson, editor of the Express, wants to sell," he
continued, speaking rapidly."It's a semi-weekly newspaper, printed only for country circulation;
has no subscription list," commented Haynerd, with a cynical shrug of
his shoulders.The abruptness of the strange, apparently irrelevant question
startled the girl."Why," she replied slowly, "as old as--as God."And, as human beings reckon time, eighteen, eh?"Hitt then turned to
Haynerd."How much money can you scrape together, if you sell this lot
of junk?"he asked, sweeping the place with a glance."Five or six thousand, all told, including bank account, bonds, and
everything, I suppose," replied Haynerd mechanically."Carlson wants forty thousand for the Express.I'm not a rich man, as
wealth is estimated to-day, but--well, oil is still flowing down in
Ohio.It isn't the money--it's--it's what's back of the cash."Carmen reached over and laid a hand on his arm."We can do it," she
whispered.Hitt hesitated a moment longer, then sprang to his feet."I've pondered and studied this scheme for a year,
but I've only to-day seen the right help.That is your tremendous,
driving thought," he said, turning to Carmen."That thought is a
spiritual dynamite, that will blast its way through every material
obstacle!Ned," seizing Haynerd by the shoulder and shaking him out of
his chair, "rouse up!Now I'll 'phone Carlson
right away and make an appointment to talk business with him.Haynerd blinked for a few moments, like an owl in the light.But then,
as a comprehension of Hitt's plan dawned upon his waking thought, he
straightened up.The clientele of the Express will not be made up
of his puppets!"But--your University work, Hitt?""I was only biding my time," she replied gently.Tears began to trickle slowly down Haynerd's cheeks, as the tension in
his nerves slackened.He rose and seized the hands of his two friends."Hitt," he said, in a choking voice, "I--I said I was a fool.The real man has waked up, and--well, what are you
standing there for, you great idiot?*       *       *       *       *

Again that evening the little group sat about the table in the dining
room of the Beaubien cottage.But only the three most directly
concerned, and the Beaubien, knew that the owner of the Express had
received that afternoon an offer for the purchase of his newspaper,
and that he had been given twenty-four hours in which to accept it.Doctor Morton was again present; and beside him sat his lifelong
friend and jousting-mate, the very Reverend Patterson Moore.Hitt
took the floor, and began speaking low and earnestly."We must remember," he said, "in conjunction with what we have deduced
regarding the infinite creative mind and its manifestations, that we
mortals in our daily mundane existence deal only and always with
phenomena, with appearances, with effects, and never with ultimate
causes.And so all our material knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only.Of the ultimate essence of things, the human mind
knows nothing.A phenomenon may be
so-and-so with regard to another; but that either is absolute truth we
can not affirm.And yet--mark this well--as Spencer says, 'Every one
of the arguments by which the relativity of our knowledge is
demonstrated distinctly postulates the positive existence of something
beyond the relative.'""It is a primitive statement of what is sometimes called the 'Theory
of suppositional opposites'", replied Hitt."It means that to every
reality there is the corresponding unreality.For every truth there
may be postulated the supposition.We can not, as the great
philosopher says, conceive that our knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only, without at the same time conceiving a reality of
which they are appearances.He further amplifies this by saying that
'every positive notion--the concept of a thing by what it is--suggests
a negative notion--the concept of a thing by what it is not.But,
though these mutually suggest each other, _the positive alone is
real_.'For, interpreted, it means: we
must deny the seeming, or that which appears to human sense, in order
to see that which is real."exclaimed Miss Wall, glancing about to note the
effect of the speaker's words on the others.But Carmen nodded her thorough agreement, and added: "Did not Jesus
say that we must deny ourselves?Why, the self that
appears to us, the matter-man, the dust-man, the man of the second
chapter of Genesis.We must deny his reality, and know that he is
nothing but a mental concept, formed out of suppositional thought, out
of dust-thought."Undoubtedly correct," said Hitt, turning to Carmen."But, before we
consider the astonishing teachings of Jesus, let us sum up the
conclusions of philosophy.To begin with, then, there is a First
Cause, omnipotent and omnipresent, and of very necessity perfect.That
Cause lies back of all the phenomena of life; and, because of its real
existence, there arises the suppositional existence of its opposite,
its negative, so to speak, which is unreal.The phenomena of human
existence have to do _only_ with the suppositional existence of the
great First Cause's opposite.They are a reflection of that
supposition.Hence all human knowledge of an external world is but
phenomenal, and consists of appearances which have no more real
substance than have shadows._We, as mortals, know but the shadowy,
phenomenal existence._ _We do not know reality._ _Therefore, our
knowledge is not real knowledge, but supposition._

"Now," he went on hastily, for he saw an expression of protest on
Reverend Moore's face, "we are more or less familiar with a phenomenal
existence, with appearances, with effects; and our knowledge of these
is entirely mental.These thoughts, such
as feeling, seeing, hearing, and so on, we ignorantly attribute to the
five physical senses.This is what Ruskin calls the 'pathetic
fallacy.'And because we do so, we find ourselves absolutely dependent
upon these senses--in belief.Moreover, quoting Spencer again, only
the absolutely real is the absolutely persistent, or enduring.The truth of the multiplication table will endure
eternally."No," admitted Miss Wall, speaking for the others."And, as regards material objects which we seem to see and touch,"
went on Hitt, "we appear to see solidity and hardness, and we conceive
as real objects what are only the mental signs or indications of
objects.Remember, matter does not and can not get into the mind.Only
thoughts and ideas enter our mentalities.We see our _thoughts_ of
hardness, solidity, and so on; and these thoughts point to something
that is real.I repeat: _the ideas of the
infinite creative Mind_.The thoughts of size, shape, hardness, and so
on, which we group together and call material chairs, trees,
mountains, and other objects, are but'relative realities,' pointing
to the absolute reality, infinite mind and its eternal ideas and
thoughts."But all seemed absorbed in his
statements.Then he resumed:

"Our concept of matter, which is now proven to be but a mental
concept, built up out of false thought, points to _mind_ as the real
substance.Our concept of measurable space and distance is the direct
opposite of the great truth that infinite mind is ever-present.Our
concept of time is the opposite of infinity.Age is the opposite of eternity--and the old-age thought
brings extinction.So, _to every reality there is the corresponding
unreality_.If the infinite creative
mind is good--and we saw that by very necessity it _must_ be so--then
evil becomes an awful unreality, and is real only to the false thought
which entertains or holds it.If life is real--and infinite mind must
itself be life--then death becomes the opposite unreality.And, as
Jesus said, it can be overcome.But were it real, _no power_, _divine
or human_, _could ever overcome or destroy it_!""Seems to me," remarked Haynerd dryly, "that our study so far simply
goes to show, as Burke puts it, 'what shadows we are and what shadows
we pursue.'""When the world humiliates itself to the point that it
will accept that, my friend," he said, "then it will become receptive
to truth."But now let us go a little further," he went on."The great Lamarck
voiced a mighty fact when he said, 'Function precedes structure.'For
by that we mean that the egg did not produce the bird, but the bird
the egg.The world seems about to pass from the very foolish belief
that physical structure is the cause of life, to the great fact that a
_sense_ of life produces the physical structure.The former crude
belief enslaved man to his body.The latter tends to free him from
such slavery.""You see, Doctor," interrupted Carmen, "the brain which you were
cutting up the other day did not make poor Yorick's mind and thought,
but his mind made the brain."The doctor smiled and shook a warning finger at the girl."The body," resumed Hitt, "is a manifestation of the human mind's
activity.What constitutes the difference between a bird and a steam
engine?This, in part: the engine is made by human hands from without;
the bird makes itself, that is, its body, from within.But the ignorant human mind--ignorant _per se_--falls
a slave to its own creation, the mental concept which it calls its
physical body, and which it pampers and pets and loves, until it can
cling to it no longer, because the mental concept, not being based on
any real principle, is forced to pass away, having nothing but false
thought to sustain it.""But now," interposed Haynerd, who was again waxing impatient, "just
what is the practical application of all this abstruse reasoning?""The very greatest imaginable, my friend," replied Hitt.And so matter can not become non-existent _unless it
is already nothing_!The world is beginning to recognize the
tremendous fact that from nothing nothing can be made.Very well,
since the law of the conservation of energy seems to be established as
regards energy _in toto_, why, we must conclude that there is no such
thing as _annihilation_.And that means that _there is no such thing
as absolute creation_!The shadow
never was real, and does not exist.And so creation becomes unfolding,
or revelation, or development, of what already exists, and has always
existed, and always will exist.Therefore, if matter, and all it
includes as concomitants, evil, sin, sickness, accident, chance, lack,
and death, is based upon unreal, false thought, then it can all be
removed, put out of consciousness, by a knowledge of truth and a
reversal of our accustomed human thought-processes.""And that," said Carmen, "is salvation.It is based on righteousness,
which is right-thinking, thinking true thoughts, and thinking truly.""And knowing," added Hitt, "that evil, including matter, is the
suppositional opposite of truth.The doctrine of materialism has been
utterly disproved even by the physicists themselves.For physicists
have at last agreed that inertia is the great essential property of
matter.That is, matter is not a cause, but an effect.It does not
operate, but is operated upon.It is not a law-giver, but is subject
to the human mind's so-called laws concerning it.It of itself is
utterly without life or intelligence."Now Spencer said that matter was a
manifestation of an underlying power or force.Physicists tell us that
matter is made of electricity, that it is an electrical phenomenon,
and that the ultimate constituent of matter is the electron.The
electron is said by some to be made up of superimposed layers of
positive and negative electricity, and by others to be made up of only
negative charges.I rather prefer the latter view, for if composed of
only negative electricity it is more truly a negation.Matter is the
_negative_ of real substance.Hence matter is a form of
energy also.But our comprehension of it is _wholly mental_.The only real energy there is or can be is the energy of the
infinite mind we call God.This the human mind copies, or imitates,
by reason of what has been called 'the law of suppositional
opposites,' already dwelt upon at some length.Gravitation is regarded by some physicists as the negative aspect of
radiation-pressure, the latter being the pressure supposed to be
exerted by all material bodies upon one another.The third law of
motion illustrates this so-called law, for it states that action
and reaction are equal and opposite.There can be no positive action
without a resultant negative one.The divine
mind, God, has His opposite in the communal human, or mortal, mind.The latter is manifested by the so-called minds which we call mankind.And from these so-called minds issue matter and material forms and
bodies, with their so-called material laws."Yes, the material universe is running down.The
entire human concept is running down.Matter, the human mental
concept, is not eternally permanent.Neither, therefore, are its
concomitants, sin and discord.Matter disintegrates and passes
away--out of human consciousness.The whole material universe--the
so-called mortal-mind concept--is hastening to its death!""But as yet I think you have not given Mr.Haynerd the practical
application which he asks," suggested Father Waite, as Hitt paused
after his long exposition."I am now ready for that," replied Hitt."We have said that the
material is the relative.But,
that being so, we can go a step further and add that human error is
likewise relative.And now--startling fact!--_it is absolutely
impossible to really know error_!""Can you know that two plus two
equals seven?""Let me make this statement of truth: nothing can be known definitely
except as it is explained by the principle which governs it.Now what
principle governs an error, whether that error be in music,
mathematics, or life conduct?"And that
is why God--infinite Mind--can not behold evil.And now, friends, I
have come to the conclusion of a long series of deductions.If
infinite mind is the cause and creator, that is, the revealer, of all
that really exists, its suppositional opposite, its negative, must
likewise simulate a creation, or revelation, or unfolding, for this
opposite must of very necessity pose as a creative principle.It must
simulate all the powers and attributes of the infinite creative mind.If the creative mind gave rise to a spiritual universe and spiritual
man, by which it expresses itself, then this suppositional opposite
must present its universe and its man, opposite in every particular to
the reality._It is this sort of man and this sort of universe that
we, as mortals, seem to see all about us, and that we refer to as
human beings and the physical universe._ And yet, all that we see,
feel, hear, smell, or taste is the false, suppositional thought that
comes into our so-called mentalities, and by its suppositional
activity there causes what we call consciousness or awareness of
things.""Then," said Father Waite, more to enunciate his own thought than to
question the deduction, "what the human consciousness holds as
knowledge is little more than belief and speculation, with no basis of
truth, no underlying principle."And it brings out the fruits of such beliefs in discord,
decay, and final dissolution, called death.For this human consciousness
forms its own concept of a fleshly body, and a mind-and-matter man.It
makes the laws which govern its body, and it causes its body to obey
these false laws.Upon the quality of thought entering this human
consciousness depend all the phenomena of earthly life and environment
which the mortal experiences.The human consciousness, in other words,
is a _self-centered mass of erroneous thought, utterly without any basis
of real principle, but actively engaged in building up mental images,
and forming and maintaining an environment in which it supposes
itself to live_._This false thought in the human consciousness forms
into a false concept of man, and this is the soul-and-body man, the
mind-and-matter man, which is called a human being, or a mortal._"

"And there," commented Carmen, with a dreamy, far-away look, "we have
what Padre Jose so long ago spoke of as the 'externalization of
thought.'It is the same law which Jesus had in mind when he said, 'As
a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.'""For we know only what enters our mentalities and
becomes active there.And every thought that does so enter, tends at
once to become externalized.That is, there is at once the tendency
for us to see it visualized in some way, either as material object, or
environment, or on our bodies.And it is the very activity of such
thought that constitutes the human mentality, as I have already
said.""And that thought is continually changing," suggested Father Waite.Its very lack of true principle requires that it should
change constantly, in order to simulate as closely as possible the
real.That accounts for the fleeting character of the whole human
concept of man and the physical universe.The human personality is
never fixed, although the elements of human character remain; that is,
those elements which are essentially unreal and mortal, such as lust,
greed, hatred, and materiality, seem to remain throughout the ages.They will give way only before truth, even as Paul said.But not until
truth has been admitted to the human mentality and begins its solvent
work there, the work of denying and tearing down the false
thought-concepts and replacing them with true ones.""And will truth come through the physical senses?"Their supposed testimony is the material thought which enters
the human mentality and becomes active there, resulting in human
consciousness of both good and evil.And that thought will have to
give way to true thought, before we can begin to put off the 'old man'
and put on the 'new.'Human thoughts, or, as we say, the physical
senses, do not and can not testify of absolute truth.exclaimed Haynerd, rousing up."There goes the Church, and
original sin, and fallen man!""There is no such thing as 'fallen man,' my friend," said Hitt
quietly."The spiritual man, the image and likeness, the reflection,
of the infinite creative mind, is perfect as long as its principle
remains perfect--and that is eternally.He is a product of false, suppositional thought.He did not fall, because he has had no perfection
to lose."Reverend Patterson Moore, who had sat a silent, though not wholly
sympathetic listener throughout the discussion, could now no longer
withhold his protest."No wonder," he abruptly exclaimed, "that there
are so few deep convictions to-day concerning the great essentials of
Christianity!As I sit here and listen to you belittle God and rend
the great truths of His Christ, as announced in His Word, the Bible, I
am moved by feelings poignantly sorrowful!The Christ has once been
crucified; and will you slay him again?""No," said Carmen, her eyes dilating with surprise, "but we would
resurrect him!Don't you think you have kept him in the tomb long
enough?The Christ-principle is intended for use, not for endless
burial!"My dear Miss Carmen, it is I who preach the risen Christ!""And
because of centuries of such preaching the world has steadily sunk
from the spiritual to the material, and lip service has taken the
place of that genuine spiritual worship which knows no evil, and
which, because of that practical knowledge, heals the sick and raises
the dead.""No, I state facts," said Carmen."Paul made some mistakes, for he was
consumed with zeal.But he stated truth when he said that the second
coming of Christ would occur when the 'old man' was put off.We have
been discussing the 'old man' to-night, and showing how he may be put
off.Now do you from your pulpit teach your people how that may be
done?""I teach the vicarious atonement of the Christ, and prepare my flock
for the world to come," replied the minister with some heat."But I am interested in the eternal present," said the girl, "not in a
suppositional future.'I am that which is, and which was, and which is to come,' says
the infinite, ever-present mind, God!""I see no Christianity whatsoever in your speculative philosophy,"
retorted the minister."If what you say is true, and the world should
accept it, all that we have learned in the ages past would be blotted
out, and falsehood would be written across philosophy, science, and
religion.By wafting evil lightly aside as unreal, you dodge the
issue, and extend license to all mankind to indulge it freely.Evil is
an awful, a stupendous fact!And it can not be relegated to the realm
of shadow, as you are trying to do!""You know, Duns Scotus
said: 'Since there is no real being outside of God, evil has no
substantial existence.Perfection and reality are synonyms, hence
absolute imperfection is synonymous with absolute unreality.'And do you really think he looked upon
evil as a _reality_?""Then, if that is true," said the girl, "I will have to reject him.But come, we are right up to the point of discussing him and his
teachings, and that will be the subject of our next meeting.It is love, you know, that has drawn us all
together."It's an open forum, Moore," said the doctor, patting him on the back."Wisdom isn't going to die with you."I am quite well satisfied with my present one, Doctor," replied the
minister tartly."Well, then, come and correct us when we err.It's your duty to save
us if we're in danger, you know.""And now, Carmen, the piano awaits you.By
the way, what did Maitre Rossanni tell you?""Oh," replied the girl lightly, "he begged me to let him train me for
Grand Opera.""He said I would make a huge fortune," she laughed."I told him I carried my wealth with me, always, and that my fortune
was now so immense that I couldn't possibly hope to add to it."Hitt," she said, going to him and looking up into his
face, "I am too busy for Grand Opera and money-making.I couldn't be happy if I made people pay to hear
me sing."With that she turned and seated herself at the piano, where she
launched into a song that made the very Reverend Patterson Moore raise
his glasses and stare at her long and curiously.CHAPTER 7


Man reasons and seeks human counsel; but woman obeys her instincts.Her life had been one of utter freedom from
dependence upon human judgment.The burden of decision as to the
wisdom of a course of action rested always upon her own thought.Never
did she seek to make a fellow-being her conscience.When the day of
judgment came, the hour of trial or vital demand, it found her
standing boldly, because her love was made perfect, not through
instinct alone, but through conformity with the certain knowledge that
he who lacks wisdom may find it in the right thought of God and man.And so, when on the next day she joined Hitt and Haynerd in the office
of the Social Era, and learned that Carlson had met their terms,
eagerly, and had transferred to them the moribund Express, she had no
qualms as to the wisdom of the step which they were taking.Haynerd was a composite picture of doubt
and fear, as he sat humped up in his chair.Hitt was serious to the
point of gloom, reflecting in a measure his companion's dismal
forebodings."I was scared to death for fear he wouldn't sell," Haynerd was saying
as the girl entered; "and I was paralyzed whenever I thought that he
would."Carmen laughed aloud when she heard these words."Do you know," she
said, "you remind me of Lot's wife.She was told to go ahead, along
the right course.But she looked back--alas for her!Now you two being
started right are looking back; and you are about to turn to salt
tears!"Now listen," she continued, as Haynerd began to remonstrate; "don't
voice a single fear to me!You couldn't make me believe them true even
if you argued for weeks--and we have no time for such foolishness
now.The first thing that you have got to do, Ned, is to start a
little cemetery.In it you must bury your fears, right away, and
without any mourning.Put up little headstones, if you wish; but don't
ever go near the place afterward, excepting to plant the insults, and
gibes, and denouncements, and vilifications which the human mind will
hurl at you, once the Express starts out on its new career.Good is
bound to stir up evil; and the Express is now in the business of good.Remember, the first thing the Apostles always did was to be afraid.And they kept Jesus busy pointing out the nothingness of their
fears.""I guess we'll find
ourselves a bit lonely in it, too!""True, humanly speaking," replied the girl, taking a chair beside him."But, Ned, let me tell you of the most startling thing I have found in
this great, new country.It is this: you Americans have, oh, so much
animal courage--and so little true moral courage!You know that the
press is one of the most corrupt institutions in America, don't you?Going into thousands of homes every day, it is
a deadlier menace than yellow fever.You know that it is muzzled by
so-called religious bodies, by liquor interests, by vice-politicians,
by commercialism, and its own craven cowardice.And yet, Ned, despite
your heart-longing, you dare not face the world and stand boldly for
righteousness in the conduct of the Express!"Now," she went on hurriedly, "let me tell you more.While you have
been debating with your fears as you awaited Mr.Carlson's decision, I
have been busy.If I had allowed my mentality to become filled with
fear and worry, as you have done, I would have had no room for real,
constructive thought.But I first thanked God for this grand
opportunity to witness to Him; and then I put out every mental
suggestion of failure, of malicious enmity from the world, and from
those who think they do not love us, and with it every subtle argument
about the unpreparedness of the human mind for good.After that I set
out to visit various newspaper offices in the city.I have talked with
four managing and city editors since yesterday noon.I have their
viewpoints now, and know what motives animate them.I know, in part, what the Express will have to meet--and how to
meet it."Both men stared at her in blank amazement.Haynerd's jaw dropped as he
gazed.He had had a long apprenticeship in the newspaper field, but
never would he have dared attempt what this fearless girl had just
done."I have found out what news is," Carmen resumed."It is wholly _a
human invention_!It is the published vagaries of the carnal mind.In
the yellow journal it is the red-inked, screaming report of the
tragedies of sin.Fallom if he knew anything about mental
laws, and the terrible results of mental suggestion in his paper's
almost hourly heralding of murder, theft, and lust.But he only
laughed and said that the lurid reports of crime tended to keep people
alive to what was going on about them.He couldn't see that he was
making a terrible reality of every sort of evil, and holding it so
constantly before an ignorant, credulous world's eyes that little else
could be seen.The moral significance of his so-called news reports
had no meaning whatsoever for him!"asked Haynerd, not believing that she would
have dared visit that journalistic demon."Yes," answered the girl, to his utter astonishment.Adams said
he had no time for maudlin sentimentalism or petticoat sophistry.He
was in the business of collecting and disseminating news, and he
wanted that news to go _shrieking_ out of his office!You can see how the report of an Italian
wife-murder shrieks in red letters an inch high on the very first
page.Or has
he further prostituted journalism by this ignorant act?""The people want it, Carmen," said Hitt slowly, though his voice
seemed not to sound a real conviction."If the church and the
press were not mortally and morally blind, they would see the deadly
destruction which they are accomplishing by shrieking from pulpit and
sanctum: 'Evil is real!Pietro Lasanni cuts his wife's throat!"But, Carmen, while what you say is doubtless true, it must be
admitted that the average man, especially the day laborer, reads his
yellow journal avidly, and--"

"Yes, he does," returned the girl.The average man, as
you call him, is a victim of _the most pernicious social system
ever devised by the human mind_!Swept along in the mad rush of
commercialism, or ground down beneath its ruthless wheels, his
jaded, jarred nerves and his tired mind cry out for artificial
stimulation, for something that will for a moment divert his wearied
thought from his hopeless situation.The Church offers him little
that is tangible this side of the grave.But whiskey, drugs, and
yellow journalism do.Hitt--can't you, Ned--that
the world's cry for sensationalism is but a cry for something that
will make it forget its misery for a brief moment?The average man
feels the superficiality of the high speed of this century of mad
rush; he longs as never before for a foundation of truth upon which to
rest; he is tired of theological fairy-tales; he is desperately
tired of sin, and sickness, and dying.He cares little about a
promised life beyond the grave.He wants help here and now to solve
his problems.Little beyond a recount
of his own daily miseries, and reports of graft and greed, and
accounts of vulgar displays of material wealth that he has not and
can not have.And these reports divert his jaded mind for a moment and
give him a false, fleeting sense of pleasure--and then leave him
sunk deeper than before in despair, and in hatred of existing
conditions!""The girl is right," said Hitt, turning to Haynerd."And we knew it,
of course.This steam-calliope
age reflects the human-mind struggle for something other than its own
unsatisfying ideas.It turns to thrills; it expresses its restlessness
and dissatisfaction with itself by futurist and cubist art, so-called;
by the rattle and vibration of machinery; by flaring billboards that
insult every sense of the artistic; and by the murk and muck of yellow
journalism, with its hideous  supplements and spine-thrilling
tales.But the publisher himself--well, he
battens materially, of course, upon the tired victims of our degrading
social system.He sees but the sordid revenue in dollars and cents."And they can't," said Haynerd."Decent journalism wouldn't
pay--doesn't--never did!Other papers have tried it, and miserably
failed!""Then," returned Hitt calmly, after a moment's reflection, "oil will
meet the deficit.As long as my paternal wells flow in Ohio the
Express will issue forth as a clean paper, a dignified, law-supporting
purveyor to a taste for better things--even if it has to create that
taste.Its columns will be closed to salacious sensation, and its
advertising pages will be barred to vice, liquor, tobacco, and
drugs.""And now we've got to get right down to
business.""Just so," said Hitt, rising."It is my intention to issue the Express
one more week on its present basis, and then turn it into a penny
morning daily.I'm going to assume the management myself, with you, Carmen, as
my first assistant."But, first, how far may
I go?""The limit," replied Hitt, rubbing his hands together."You are my
brain, so to speak, henceforth.As to financial resources, I am
prepared to dump a hundred thousand dollars right into the Express
before a cent of revenue comes back.""Another question, then: will you issue a Sunday edition?""For a while, yes," he said."We'll see how it works, for I have some
ideas to try out.""Well, then," resumed the girl eagerly, "I want this paper to be for
_all_ the people; to be independent in the truest sense of the term;
and to be absolutely beyond the influence of political and religious
sectarianism--you'll soon enough learn what that will cost you--to be
an active, constructive force in this great city, and a patient,
tireless, loving educator."grunted Haynerd, although he was listening very carefully."The Express will succeed," the girl went on, without noticing him,
"because our thought regarding it is successful._We_ have already
succeeded; and that success will be externalized in our work.It makes
no difference what the people may think of _us_; but it makes a lot of
difference what _we_ think of _them_ and _ourselves_.We assume superiority over adverse conditions, and we
claim success, because we know that these things are mental, and that
they are divinely ours.Lot's wife didn't have the sort of confidence
that wins--she looked back.But
there is no doubt of the outcome.And so there is no doubt lurking in
us to take the edge off our efforts, is there?The thought regarding
the Express has not been timidly born within us; it has come forth
flashing vigor!Yes it has, Ned, despite your doubts!And we have
within us a power mightier than any force outside of us.That is the
knowledge of infinite mind's omnipotence, and our ability to use the
Christ-principle to meet _every_ problem.Haynerd began to rouse up with a returning sense of confidence.Hitt
smiled and nodded to Carmen.The girl went on rapidly and eagerly:

"We are going to give the people news from a new standpoint, aren't
we?We are not going on the assumption that the report of mankind's
errors is the report of real news.The only thing that is really new
is _good_.Adams's office two
items came in over the 'phone.One was the report of a jewel robbery,
and the other was an announcement of the draining by the Government of
submerged lands in Louisiana, so as to give an additional opportunity
to those seeking farms.Adams put in bold type on
the front page?I was unable to locate the latter
anywhere in the paper, although it was a timely bit of news.""Now another thing," continued the girl, "I want the Sunday edition of
the Express to contain a resume of the important and vital news of the
week, with the very clearest, most impartial and enlightening
editorial comment upon it.This calls for nice discrimination in the
selection of those items for our comment.It means, however, the best
practical education for the people.This was John Ruskin's idea, and
certainly is a splendid one.Still another thing, the Express will
stand shoulder to shoulder with the women for equal suffrage."It is the women who will clean up
and regenerate this world, not the men.Reform is now in the hands of
the women.And India proves that
backward women mean a backward nation.""Then," continued Carmen, "make a distinct Women's Department in the
Express, and put Miss Wall on the staff.""A daily educational department for foreigners, our immigrants, giving
them every possible aid in suggestions regarding their naturalization,
the languages, hotels, boarding houses, employment, and so on.""The Express is going to maintain a social service, and night schools.It is going to establish vacation and permanent homes for girls.It is
going to provide for vocational training.It is going to establish a
lecture bureau--for lectures on _good_.It is going to build a model
city for workingmen.Then it is going to found a model city for
everybody.It is going to establish clubs and meeting places for
workingmen, places where they may meet, and play games, and read, and
have social intercourse, and practical instruction.It is going to
establish the same for young boys.It is going to take the lead for
civic betterment in this city, and for child-welfare, and for--"

By this time Haynerd was sitting erect and staring in bewilderment at
the girl."Aren't you wandering
somewhat beyond strict newspaper limits?"And haven't I told you," returned the girl promptly, "that the only
thing new in this world is _good_?Our news is going to be _good_
news--the collection and dissemination of _good_ to all mankind.People who read our paper will no longer feel that it is dangerous to
be alive, but a glorious privilege.Hitt said I could go the limit, you know."Hitt had caught the girl's infectious enthusiasm, and his face was
beaming."It's your unlimited thought, Carmen, that
we old dry-bones want!What is anything in this life, compared with real
service to our fellow-men?_The Express is not in business to make
money!_ It is in the business of collecting and scattering the news of
good.Its dividends will be the happiness and joy it gives to mankind.For _good is the greatest success there
is_!"It is likely that Hitt did not catch the full meaning of the girl's
words; and it is certain that Haynerd did not.But her boundless
enthusiasm did penetrate in large degree into their souls, and they
ceased to insist on the query, Will it pay?The broader outlook was
already beginning to return profits to these men, as the newer
definition of 'news' occupied their thought.Seizing their hats, they bade Carmen go with them to inspect the plant
of the Express, and meet its staff."There's a question I'd like to ask," said Haynerd, as they pursued
their way toward their recent purchase."I want to know what our
editorial policy will be.Do we condone the offenses of our grafters
and spoilsmen by remaining silent regarding their crimes?"We will let their guilt expose and kill itself," quickly returned
Carmen.A few minutes later they entered the gloomy, dust-laden offices of the
Express.Hitt's spirits sank again as he looked about him.But Carmen
seemed to suffer no loss of enthusiasm.After a mental appraisal of
the dingy, uninviting environment she exclaimed: "Well, one nice thing
about this is that we don't have much to start with!"Hitt reflected upon her cryptical remark, and then laughed.It was evident that the sale of
his plant had removed a heavy load from his shoulders."My best reporter was out yesterday when you called," he said,
addressing Hitt."He--well, he was a little the worse for wear.Come into my office and I'll send for him."In a few minutes a tall, boyish fellow responded to the editor's
summons.He must have been well under twenty, thought Hitt, marveling
that so young a man should be regarded as Carlson's best news
gatherer.But his wonder grew apace when the editor introduced him as
Mr.The lad smiled pallidly, as he bent his gaze upon Carmen, and
addressed his reply to her."My governor," he said laconically.returned Haynerd, beginning to bristle.Carlson dismissed the reporter, and turned to the curious group."The boy has the making of a fine newspaper man in him.Has something
of his father's terrible energy.He used to come down here before his father threw him out.I
let him write little articles for the Express when he was barely
sixteen years old; and they were mighty good, too.But he got mixed up
in some scandal, and J. Wilton cut him off.The boy always did drink,
I guess.But since his family troubles he's been on the straight road
to the insane asylum."His father is no
friend of mine, and--"

"We _shall_ keep him," calmly interrupted Carmen."His father is a
_very_ good friend of mine."Carlson looked from one to the other quizzically."Well," squinting over his glasses at the girl, "this surely is
woman's era, isn't it?"*       *       *       *       *

A week later the Express, scarcely recognizable in its clean, fresh
type and modest headlines, with its crisp news and well written
editorials, very unostentatiously made its entry into the already
crowded metropolitan field.Adams picked it up and
laughed, a short, contemptuous laugh.Fallom glanced over it and
wondered.J. Wilton Ames, who had been apprised of its advent, threw
it into the waste basket--and then drew it out again.He re-read the
editorial announcing the policy of the paper.From that he began a
careful survey of the whole sheet.His eye caught an article on the
feminist movement, signed by Carmen Ariza.His lip curled, but he read
the article through, and finished with the mental comment that it was
well written."I want this sheet carefully watched," he commanded, tossing the paper
to his secretary."If anything is noticed that in any way refers to me
or my interests, call my attention to it immediately."A moment afterward Henry Claus,
nominal head of the great Claus brewing interests, was ushered in.cried the newcomer, rushing
forward and clasping the financier's hand."The city council last
night voted against the neighborhood saloon license bill!"Yes," commented the laconic Ames."Our aldermen are a very
intelligent lot of statesmen, Claus.They're wise enough to see that
their jobs depend upon whiskey.It requires very astute statesmanship,
Claus, to see that.But some of our congressmen and senators have
learned the same thing."The brewer pondered this delphic utterance and scratched his head."Well," continued Ames, "have you your report?""Sales
less than last month," he remarked dryly."It's the local option law what done it, Mr.Ames," replied the brewer
apologetically."Them women--"

"Bah!Let a few petticoats whip you, eh?But, anyway, you don't know
how to market your stuff.Look here, Claus, you've got to encourage
the young people more.We've got to get the girls and boys.If we get
the girls, we'll get the boys easily enough.It's the same in the
liquor business as in certain others, Claus, you've got to land them
young."Ames, I can't take 'em and pour it down their throats!""You could if you knew how," returned Ames.if I had
nothing else to do I'd just like to devote myself to the sales end of
the brewing business.I'd use mental suggestion in such a way through
advertising that this country would drown in beer!Beer is just plain
beer to you dull-wits.But suppose we convinced people that it was a
food, eh?Advertise a chemical analysis of it, showing that it has
greater nutriment than beef.Catch the clerks and poor stenographers
that way.Don't call it beer; call it Maltdiet, or something like
that.Why, we couldn't begin to supply the demand!""Billboards in every field and along all railroads and highways;
boards in every vacant lot in every town and city in the country;
electric signs everywhere; handbills; lectures--never thought of that,
did you?And samples--why, I'd put samples into every house in the
Union!I'd give away a million barrels of beer--and sell a hundred
million as a result!But I'd work particularly with the young people.Work on them with literature and suggestion; they're more receptive
than adults.The hypnotism that works through suggestive advertising,
Claus, is simply omnipotent!"We have all the papers, excepting the Express, Mr.You can
afford to pass it up.It's run by a college professor and a doll-faced
girl."Ames, our advertising manager tells me that the publishers
of the Express called a meeting of the managers of all the other city
papers, to discuss cutting out liquor advertising, and that since then
the rates have gone up, way up!You see, the example set by the
Express may--"

"Humph!"An example, backed by
absolute fearlessness--and he knew from experience that the publishers
of the Express were without fear--well, it could not be wholly
ignored, even if the new paper had no circulation worth the name.Ames," resumed the brewer, "the Express is in every newsstand in
the city.It's in every hotel, in every
saloon, in every store and business house here.It
isn't sold, it's given away!"Leave it to me, Claus," he said at length, dismissing the brewer."I'll send for you in a day or so."*       *       *       *       *

It was well after midnight when the little group assembled in the
dining room of the Beaubien cottage to resume their interrupted
discussions.Hitt and Haynerd were the last to arrive.With him had come, not without
some reluctance, his prickly disputant, Reverend Patterson Moore, and
another friend and colleague, Doctor Siler, whose interest in these
unique gatherings had been aroused by Morton."I've tried to give him a resume of our previous deductions," the
latter explained, as Hitt prepared to open the discussion."And he
says he has conscientious scruples--if you know what that means.""He's a Philistine, that's all, eh?""I am like my friend, Reverend Edward
Hull, who says--"

"There!""Your friend has a life job molding the
plastic minds of prospective preachers, and he doesn't want to lose
the sinecure.Got a wife and babies depending on
him.He still preaches hell-fire and the resurrection of the flesh,
doesn't he?Well, in that case we can dispense with his views, for
we've sent that sort of doctrine to the ash heap."Reverend Moore opened his mouth as if to protest; but Hitt prevented
him by taking the floor and plunging at once into his subject."The
hour is very late," he said in apology, "and we have much ground to
cover.Carmen stole a hand beneath the table and grasped the Beaubien's."As I sat in my office this morning," began Hitt meditatively, "I
looked often and long through the window and out over this great,
roaring city.Everywhere I saw tremendous activity, frantic hurry, and
nerve-racking strife.In the distance I marked the smoke curling
upward from huge factories, packing houses, and elevators.The
incessant seething, the rush and bustle, the noise, the heat, and
dust, all spelled business, an enormous volume of human business--and
yet, _not one iota of it contributed even a mite to the spiritual
nature and needs of mankind_!And then I looked down, far down, into the
streets below.And I saw,
too, men and women, rich and comfortable, riding along happily in
their automobiles, with not a thought beyond their physical
well-being.But, I asked myself, should they not ride thus, if they
wish?And yet, the hour will soon come when sickness, disaster, and
death will knock at their doors and sternly bid them come out."Just what I have sought to impress upon you whenever you advanced
your philosophical theories, Doctor," said Reverend Moore, turning to
Morton.The doctor glowered back at him without reply."Now what should the man in the automobile do?Is there anything he
_can_ do, after all?Jesus told such as he to seek
first the kingdom of harmony--a demonstrable understanding of truth.The automobile riding would follow after that, and with safety.Why,
oh, why, will we go on wasting our precious time acquiring additional
physical sensations in motor cars, amusement parks, travel, anywhere
and everywhere, instead of laboring first to acquire that real
knowledge which alone will set us free from the bitter woes of human
existence!""Jesus set us free, sir," interposed Reverend Moore sternly."And his
vicarious atonement opens the door of immortality to all who believe
on his name."Moore, you believe will be acquired only after
death.At present we see mankind laboring for that which even they
themselves admit is not meat.They waste their substance for what is
not bread.Because of their false beliefs of God and man,
externalized in a viciously cruel social system; because of their
dependence upon the false supports of _materia medica_, orthodox
theology, man-devised creeds, and human opinions."And yet, who hath believed our report?men in our
day think and read little that is serious; and they reflect hardly at
all upon the vital things of life.They want to be let alone in their
comfortable materialistic beliefs, even though those beliefs rend
them, rive them, rack and twist them with vile, loathsome disease, and
then sink them into hideous, worm-infested graves!The human mind does
not want its undemonstrable beliefs challenged.It does not want the
light of unbiased investigation thrown upon the views which it has
accepted ready-made from doctor and theologian.Because,
my friends, the human mind is inert, despite its seemingly tremendous
material activity.And its inertia is the result of its own
self-mesmerism, its own servile submission to beliefs which, as
Balfour has shown, have grown up under every kind of influence except
that of genuine evidence.Chief of these are the prevalent religious
beliefs, which we are asked to receive as divinely inspired."But that
gentleman sat stolid, with arms folded and a scowl upon his sharp
features."Religion," continued Hitt, "is that which binds us to the real.what a farce mankind have made of it.Because, in its mad
desire to make matter real and to extract all pleasures from it, the
human mind has tried to eliminate the soul.""We have been having a bad spell of materialism, that's true,"
interposed Doctor Morton."Well," Hitt replied, "perhaps so.Yet almost in our own day France
put God out of her institutions; set up and crowned a prostitute as
the goddess of reason; and trailed the Bible through the streets of
Paris, tied to the tail of an ass!And in this country we have enthroned so-called physical
science, and, as Comte predicted, are about to conduct God to the
frontier and bow Him out with thanks for His provisional services.As our droll philosopher, Hubbard, has said, 'Once
man was a spirit, now he is matter.Once he was a flame, now he is a
candlestick.Once he was a son of God, now he is a chemical formula.Once he was an angel, now he is plain mud.'""But," exclaimed Reverend Moore, visibly nettled, "that is because of
his falling away from the Church--"

"My friend," said Hitt calmly, "he fell away from the Church because
he could not stagnate longer with her and be happy.Orthodox theology
has largely become mere sentimentalism.The average man has a horror
of being considered a namby-pamby, religiously weak, wishy-washy,
so-called Christian.It makes him ashamed of himself to stand up
in a congregation and sing 'My Jesus, I love Thee,' and 'In
mansions of glory and endless delight.'And he is far more concerned about his little brick bungalow
and next month's rent than he is about celestial mansions.No; he leaves religion to women, whom he regards as the
weaker sex.He turns to the ephemeral wisdom of human science--and,
poor fool!Well, how
often nowadays do you hear the name of God on their lips?Is He ever the topic of conversation at
receptions and balls?No; that person was right who said that
religion 'does not rise to the height of successful gossip.'It
stands no show with the latest cabaret dance, the slashed skirt,
and the daringly salacious drama as a theme of discourse.Oh, yes,
we still maintain our innumerable churches.And, though religion is
the most vital thing in the world to us, we hire a preacher to talk
to us once a week about it!Would we hire men to talk once a week to
us about business?But religion is far, far less important to
human thought than business--for the latter means automobiles and
increased opportunities for physical sensation."Hitt," objected Doctor Siler, "I am sure this is not such a
godless era as you would make out.""We have many gods, chief of whom is matter.The
world's acknowledged god is not spirit, despite the inescapable fact
that the motive-power of the universe is spiritual, and the only
action is the expression of thought."But now," he continued, "we have in our previous discussions made
some startling deductions, and we came to the conclusion that there is
a First Cause, and that it is infinite mind.But, having agreed upon
that, are we now ready to admit the logical corollary, namely, that
there can be but _one_ real mind?For that follows from the premise
that there is but one God who is infinite.""We have but the one mind, God," he replied.Human men reflect the communal mortal
mind, which is the suppositional opposite of the divine mind that is
God.I repeat, the so-called human mind knows not God.It sees only its own interpretations of Him
and His manifestations."Well, they might be," suggested Doctor Siler."Well then," he said, "if you will not admit that all
things are mental--including the entire universe--you certainly are
forced to admit that your comprehension of things is mental.""Then you will likewise have to admit that you are not concerned with
_things_, but with your comprehension of things.""And so, after all, you deal only with mental things--and everything
is mental to you.""The Bible states clearly that He created _all_ things," returned that
gentleman a little stiffly."My friends," resumed Hitt very earnestly, "we are on the eve of a
tremendous enlightenment, I believe.And for that we owe much to the
so-called 'theory of suppositional opposites.'We have settled to our
satisfaction that, although mankind believe themselves to be dependent
upon air, food, and water for existence, nevertheless they are really
dependent upon something vastly finer, which is back of those things.That'something' we call God, for it is good.Matthew Arnold said that
the only thing that can be verified about God is that He is 'the
eternal power that makes for righteousness.'Very well, we are almost
willing to accept that alone--for that carries infinite implications.It makes God an eternal, spiritual power, omnipotent as an influence
for good.It makes Him the infinite patron, so to speak, of
right-thinking.So it makes Him
the sole creative force."But," he continued, "force, or power, is not material.God by very
necessity is mind, including all intelligence.And His operations are
conducted according to the spiritual law of evolution.Oh, yes,
evolution is not a theory, it is a fact.God, infinite mind, evolves,
uncovers, reveals, unfolds, His numberless eternal ideas.The greatest of these is the one that
includes all others and expresses and reflects Him perfectly.That is the man who was'made'--revealed, manifested--in
His image and likeness.There is no other image and likeness of God.Moreover, God has always existed, and always will.So His ideas,
including real man, have had no beginning.They were not created, as
we regard creation, but have been unfolded.But now we come to the peculiar part,
namely, the fact that _reality seems always to have its shadow in
unreality_.The magnet has
its opposite poles, one positive, the other negative.At the lowest ebb of the
world's morals appeared the Christ.The Christian religion springs
from the soil of a Roman Emperor's blood-soaked gardens.Errors hampering the solving of
mathematical problems.That
which stands the test of demonstration as to permanence, I say with
Spencer."And now we learn that it is the _communal mortal mind_ that stands as
the opposite and negative of the infinite mind that is God, and that
it is but a supposition, without basis of real principle or fact.It
has its law of evolution, too, and evolves its types in human beings
and animals, in mountain, tree, and stream.All material nature, in
fact, is but the manifestation, or reflection, of this communal mortal
mind."But, though God had no beginning, and will have no ending, this
communal mortal mind, on the contrary, did have a seeming beginning,
and will end its pseudo-existence.It seemingly
evolved its universe, and its earth as its lower stratum.It made its
firmament, and it gradually filled its seas with moving things that
manifested its idea of life.Slowly, throughout inconceivable eons of
time, it unrolled and evolved, until at last, through untold
generations of stupid, sluggish, often revolting animal forms, it
began to evolve a type of mind, a crude representation of the mind
that is God, and manifesting its own concept of intelligence."Now what was this communal mortal mind doing?Counterfeiting divine
mind, if I may so express it.But
types that were without basis of principle, and so they passed
away--the higher forms died, the lower disintegrated.Aye, death came
into the world because of sin, for the definition of sin is the
Aramaic word which Jesus used, translated '_hamartio_,' which means
'missing the mark.'Yes, sin came through Adam, for
Adam is the name of the communal mortal mind."Well, ages and ages passed, reckoned in the human mind concept of
time.The evolution was continually toward a higher and ever higher
type.Paleolithic man still died, because he did not have enough real
knowledge in his mortal mind to keep him from missing the mark.He
probably had no belief in a future life, for he did not bury his dead
after the manner of those who later manifested this belief.But, after
the lapse of centuries, Neolithic man was found manifesting such a
belief.This: the mortal mind was translating the
divine idea of immortality into its own terms and thus expressing it.The curtain began to rise upon what we call human
history.The idea of a power not itself began to filter through the
mist of mortal mind, and human beings felt its influence, the
influence that makes for righteousness.And then, at last, through the
mortal mind there began to filter the idea of the one God.The people
who best reflected this idea were the ancient Israelites.They called
themselves the 'chosen' people.Their so-called minds were, as Carmen
has expressed it, like window-panes that were a little cleaner than
the others.They let a bit more of the light through.God is light,
you know, according to the Scriptures.And little by little they began
to record their thoughts regarding their concept of the one God.And soon they were seeing their God
manifested everywhere, and hearing His voice in every sound of Nature.And thus began that strange and mighty
book, the Bible, _the record of the evolution of the concept of God in
the human mind_.""Do you mean to say that the Bible was not given by inspiration?""This filtering process that I have been speaking
about _is_ inspiration.Every bit of truth that comes to you or me
to-day comes by inspiration--the breathing in--of the infinite mind
that is truth."And so," he went on, "we have those reflections of the communal
mortal mind which we call the Israelites recording their thoughts and
ideas.Sometimes they recorded plain fact; sometimes they wrapped
their moral teachings in allegories and fables.Josephus says of Moses
that he wrote some things enigmatically, some allegorically, and the
rest in plain words, since in his account of the first chapter of
Genesis and the first three verses of the second he gives no hint of
any mystery at all.But when he comes to the fourth verse of the
second chapter he says Moses, after the seventh day was over, began
to talk philosophically, and so he understood the rest of the second
and third chapters in some enigmatical and allegorical sense.Quite
so, it appears to me, for the writer, whoever he was, was then
attempting the impossible task of explaining the enigma of evil, the
origin of which is associated always with the dust-man.""You deny the truth of the account of the creation as given in the
second chapter of Genesis, do you?""You deny
that man was tempted and fell?""Well," said Hitt, smiling, "of course there is no special reason for
denying that serpents may have talked, millions and millions of years
ago.In fact, they still have rudimentary organs of speech--as do most
animals.Snakes developed in the
Silurian Era, some twenty million years ago.In the vast intervening
stretch of time they may have lost their power to talk.But, as for
the second chapter of Genesis, Moses may or may not have written it.Indeed, he may not have written the first.The book of
Genesis shows plainly that it is a composite of several books by
various authors.I incline to the belief that some more materialistic
hand and mind than Moses's composed that second chapter.However that
may be, it is a splendid example of the human mind's crude attempt to
interpret the spiritual creation in its own material terms.It in a
way represents the dawning upon the human mind of the idea of the
spiritual creation.For when finite sense approaches the infinite it
must inevitably run into difficulties with which it can not cope; it
must meet problems which it can not solve, owing to its lack of a
knowledge of the infinite principle involved.That's why the world
rejected the first account of the creation and accepted the second,
snake-story, dust-man, apple tree, and all."exclaimed Haynerd, his eyes wide agape."You're like a
story-book!"We know that man appeared on this
earth in comparatively recent times.For millions and millions of
years before he was evolved animals and vegetables had been dying."Your difficulty arises from the fact that
we are accustomed to associate sin with human personality.But
remember, the physical universe has been evolved from the communal
mortal mind.It has been dying from
the very beginning of its seeming existence, for its seeming existence
alone is sin.The vegetables, the animals, and now the men, that have
been evolved from it, and that express it and reflect and manifest
it, must die, necessarily, because the so-called mind from which they
evolve is not based upon the eternal, immortal principle, God.And so
it and they miss the mark, and always have done so.You must cease to
say, Whose sin?Remember that the sin is inherent in the so-called
mind that is expressed by things material.The absence of the
principle which is God is sin, according to the Aramaic word,
translated '_hamartio_,' which Jesus used.The most lowly cell that
swam in the primeval seas manifested the communal mortal mind's sin,
and died as a consequence.""In other words, it manifested a supposition, as opposed to truth?""Its existence was quite suppositional," replied Hitt."It did not
manifest life, but a material sense of existence.And so the communal mortal mind,
so-called, determined these first lowly material and objective forms
of existence.They were its phenomena, and they manifested it.Different types now manifest it, after long ages.But all are equally
without basis of principle, all are subject to the mortal law that
everything material contains within itself the elements for its own
destruction, and all must pass away.In our day we are dealing with
the highest type of mortal mind so far evolved, the human man.He,
too, knows but one life, human life, the mortal-mind sense of
existence.His human life is demonstrably only a series of states of
material consciousness, states of thought-activity.The classification
and placing of these states of consciousness give him his sense of
time.The positing of his mental concepts give him his sense of space.His consciousness is a thought-activity, externalizing human opinions,
ideas, and beliefs, not based on truth.This consciousness--or
supposititious human mind--is very finite in nature, and so is
essentially self-centered.It attributes its fleshly existence to
material things.It believes that its life depends upon its fleshly
body; and so it thinks itself in constant peril of losing it.It goes
further, and believes that there are multitudes of other human minds,
each having its own human, fleshly existence, or life, and each
capable of doing it and one another mortal injury.It believes that it
can be deprived by its neighboring mortal minds of all that it needs
for its sustenance, and that it can improve its own status at their
expense, and vice versa.It is filled with fears--not knowing that God
is infinite good--and its fears become externalized as disaster, loss,
calamity, disease, and death at last.It has no basis of principle to rest upon, and so it
constantly shifts and changes to accord with its own shifting thought.It is here to-day, and gone
to-morrow.""Well, Ned," said Hitt, "there is this hope: human consciousness
always refers its states to something.It is infinite mind, God, and its infinite manifestation.The human
mind still translates or interprets God's greatest idea, Man, as 'a
suffering, sinning, troubled creature,' forgetting that this creature
is only a mental concept, and that the human mind is looking only at
its own thoughts, and that these thoughts are counterfeits of God's
real thoughts."Moreover, though the human mind is finite, and can not even begin to
grasp the infinite, the divine mind has penetrated the mist of error.There is a spark of real reflection in every mortal.That spark can be
made to grow into a flame that will consume all error and leave the
real man revealed, a consciousness that knows no evil.There is now
enough of a spark of intelligence in the human, so-called mind to
enable it to lay hold on truth and grow out of itself.And there is no
excuse for not doing so, as Jesus said.If he had not come we wouldn't
have known that we were missing the mark so terribly.""Well," observed Haynerd, "after that classification I don't see that
we mortals have much to be puffed up about!""All human beings, or mortals, Ned," said Hitt, "are interpretations
by the mortal mind of infinite mind's idea of itself, Man.These
interpretations are made in the human mind, and they remain posited
there.All are false,
and doomed to decay.How, then, can one mortal look down with
superciliousness upon another, when all are in the same identical
class?"Carmen's thoughts rested for a moment upon the meaningless existence
of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had anchored her life in the shifting
sands of the flesh and its ephemeral joys."Now," resumed Hitt, "we will come back to the question of progress.What is progress but the growing of the human mind out of itself under
the influence of the divine stimulus of demonstrable truth?And that
is made possible when we grasp the stupendous fact that the human,
mortal mind, including its man, is absolutely unreal and non-existent!The human man changes rapidly in mind, and, consequently, in its lower
stratum, or expression, the body.For that reason he need not carry
over into to-day the old, false beliefs which were manifested by him
yesterday.If he leaves them in the past, they cease to be manifested
in his present or future.Then, opening
himself to truth, he lays off the 'old man' and puts on the 'new.'He
denies himself--denies that there is any truth in the seeming reality
of the mortal, material self--as Jesus bade us do."His ideas and the thoughts regarding them must always have existed.He, as mind, is an inexhaustible
reservoir of thought.Now the human, mortal mind interprets His
thoughts, and so _seems_ to manufacture new thought.It makes new
interpretations, but not new thoughts.When you hear people chatting,
do you think they are manufacturing new thought?They
are but reflecting, or voicing, the communal so-called mortal mind's
interpretations of God's innumerable and real thoughts.""And so," suggested Father Waite, "the more nearly correct our
interpretations of His thoughts are, the nearer we approach to
righteousness.""There exist all sorts of real thoughts
about God's ideas.But the human mind
makes likewise all sorts of erroneous translations of them.We shall
solve our problem of existence when we correctly interpret His
thoughts, and use them only.When the human mentality becomes attuned
or accustomed to certain thoughts, that kind flow into it readily from
the communal mortal mind.Some people think for years along certain
erroneous or criminal lines.Their minds are set in that direction,
and invite such a flow of thought.But were they to reverse the'set,'
there would be a very different and better resulting externalization
in health, prosperity, and morals.""I think I see," said Miss Wall."And I begin to glimpse the true
mission of Jesus, and why he was ready to give up everything for it."And now a word further about the so-called mortal mind.For,
when we have collected and arranged all our data regarding it, we will
find ourselves in a position to begin to work out of it, and thereby
truly work out our salvation, even if with fear and trembling.I have
said in a previous talk that, judging by the deductions of the
physical scientists, everything seems about to leave the material
basis and turn into vibrations, and'man changes with velocity' of
these.They tell us that all life depends upon water; that life began,
eons ago, in the primeval sea.True, the human sense of existence, as
I have said, began in the dark, primeval sea of mist, the deep and
fluid mortal mind, so-called.And that sense of existence most
certainly is dependent upon the fluid of mortal mind.Bichat has said
that 'life is the sum of the forces that resist death.'Spencer has
defined life as the 'continuous adjustment of internal to external
relations.'Very good, as applied to the human sense of life.The
human mind makes multitudes of mental concepts, and then struggles
incessantly to adjust itself to them, and at length gives up the
struggle, hopelessly beaten.Scientists tell us that life is due to a
continuous series of bodily ferments.The body is in a constant state
of ferment, and that gives rise to life.We know that the human
mind is in a state of incessant ferment.The human mind is a
self-centered mass of writhing, seething, fermenting material thought.And that fermentation is outwardly manifested in its concept of body,
and its material environment.The scientists themselves are rapidly
pushing matter back into the realm of the human mind.Bodily states
are becoming recognized as manifestations of mental states--not vice
versa, as has been ignorantly believed for ages.A prominent physician
told me the other day that many a condition of nervous prostration now
could be directly traced to selfishness.We know that hatred and anger
produce fatal poisons.The rattlesnake is a splendid example of that.I am told that its poison and the white of an egg are formed of
_exactly the same amounts of the same elements_.The difference in
effect is the thought lying back of each.""You don't pretend that the snake
thinks and hates--"

"Doctor," said Hitt, "for thousands upon thousands of years the human
race has been directing hatred and fear-thoughts toward the snake.Is
it any wonder that the snake is now poisonous?That it now reflects
back that poisonous thought to mankind?""But some are not poisonous, you know.""Can we say how long they have not been so, or how soon our hatred
will make them all poisonous?Do you know, moreover, that sorrow,
remorse, all emotions, in fact, affect the perspiration that exudes
from the human body?Do you know that hatred will render human
perspiration the deadliest poison known to science?I am told that
in a few minutes of murderous hatred enough of this poisonous
perspiration is exuded from the human body to kill a man.And do
you know that the thought which manifests upon the body in such
deadly poison is just as deadly when sent into the mentality of a
human being?Think what the Church's deadly hatred of so-called
heretics has done in the last nineteen hundred years!Why, millions
have been killed by it alone!"But now," he said, consulting his watch, "I must go.Even a newspaper
man requires a little sleep.And I must make my apology for occupying
the floor to-night to the exclusion of you all.I have gradually been
filling up with these thoughts for some weeks, and I had to let them
out.Hitt," interrupted Father Waite, "I shall soon be ready to report
on those questions of Bible research which you assigned to me.""Well, have you found that Jesus really was
an historical character, or not?""I think," said Carmen, "that he has found that it really matters
little whether there ever was such a person as the human man Jesus.The Christ has always lived; and the Christ-principle which the man
Jesus is reported to have revealed to the world is with us, here, now,
and always.It is the principle, rather than the man Jesus, that
concerns us, is it not?""Miss Carmen," interposed Reverend Moore, "Jesus was the incarnate Son
of God, and your remarks concerning him are--"

"Slow up, Pat!""I'll fight that out with
you on the way home."We will take up that question in our next discussion," said Hitt."But, wait; Carmen must give us just a short song before we part."As she passed Hitt, she
squeezed his hand.A few minutes later the little group dispersed,
with the melody of the girl's voice trembling in their souls.CHAPTER 8


For several days Ames reflected, and waited.Judging by the data which
he was able to secure, the Express was eating up money at a fearful
pace.To continue at that rate meant certain financial disaster in the
near future.And yet the publishers of the rejuvenated sheet seemed
never to count the cost of their experiment.Already they had begun
the introduction of innovations that were startling and even
mirth-provoking to staid, conservative publishers in the journalistic
field.To survive the long period necessary for the education of the
public taste to such things as the Express stood for demanded a source
of income no less permanent than La Libertad itself.The Beaubien, of course, in her
crippled financial condition was affording the Express no monetary
assistance.Haynerd's few thousands were long
since dissipated.And
her estate was handled by Ames and Company!And handled, we may add,
in such a manner that Miss Wall knew naught regarding it, except that
she might draw upon it as one dips water from a hillside spring.And as he meditated upon the new paper and its
promoters, there gradually formed within him a consuming desire to see
again the fair young girl who had drawn him so strongly, despite his
mountainous wrath and his flaming desire to crush her when she boldly
faced him in his own house on the night of his grand reception.Why
had he let her escape him then?True, women had
meant little to him, at least in the last few years.But this girl had
seemed to stir within him new emotions, or those long slumbering.He
knew not, coarsely materialistic as was his current thought, that in
him, as in all who came within the radius of her pure affection, she
had swept chords whose music he had never heard before.And then one morning he took down
the receiver and called up the office of the Express.Hitt was not there--but this was his assistant.And:

"You didn't want to see Mr.Ames nearly dropped the receiver in his astonishment.In the first
place, the girl had read his thought; and in the second, he was not
accustomed to being told that he might go to see people--they came
cringing to him."You may come at twelve-fifteen," continued the clear, firm voice."And remain a half hour; I'm very busy."Ames put down the instrument and looked about, thankful that no one
was there to comment on his embarrassment.Then he leaned back in his
chair and went slowly over in thought the experiences of that eventful
night in his house.Why, this slip of a girl--a half-breed Indian at
best--this mere baby--!But he glanced up at the great electric wall
clock, and wished it were then twelve-fifteen.*       *       *       *       *

At noon Ames, jauntily swinging his light walking stick, strolled
casually into the office of the Express.His air was one of supreme
confidence in his own powers.And
the knowledge rendered him unafraid of God, man, or beast.He had met
and conquered everything mundane, excepting this young girl.But that
thought was now delightful to him.In her he had unearthed a real
novelty, a ceaseless interest.She scratched and nettled him; but she was as nothing in his grasp.The first thing that impressed him on entering the office was the air
of prosperity which hung over the place.The environment, he mentally
commented, was somewhat unusual for a newspaper plant.Order, quiet,
and cleanliness were dominant notes in the prevailing harmony.He
first walked back into the pressroom to see if the same conditions
prevailed there.Then he retraced his steps, and at length came to a
halt before a door bearing the inscription, "Miss Ariza," on the
glass.Turning the knob, he peered curiously in.The room was small, but light and airy.Its furnishings were new, and
its walls had been freshly tinted.A few pictures of good quality hung
about them.At the desk, bending
over a new typewriter, sat Carmen."I beg pardon," said Ames, hesitating in the doorway."You don't mind if I finish
this article, do you?""It's got
to go to the compositors right away.""Certainly--don't stop," replied Ames easily."When we talk I want
your undivided attention.""Oh, you're sure to get it," she returned, laughing.He sat back in his chair and watched her closely.Yet, there was just a slight tint in her skin, he thought.Perhaps the report that she was a mulatto was not wholly unfounded,
although the strain must have been greatly mixed.He wanted to bend over and take it in his own.Then he suddenly remembered what the Beaubien had once told him--that
she always seemed to be a better woman in this girl's presence.Could he go on persecuting the
harassed woman?But he wouldn't, if--

"There!"said the girl, with what seemed to be a little sigh of
relief.She pressed a button, and handed the typewritten sheets to the
boy who responded.Then, turning to Ames:

"You've come to apologize, haven't you?Well, he certainly had not had any such intention when he
came in.In fact, he knew not just why he was there."You see, Congressman Wales didn't vote for the unaltered schedule.And so everything's all right, isn't it?""No vote has been taken," he said, a dull anger
rising within him."Oh, you are mistaken," replied the girl."The bill was voted out of
committee an hour ago.Here's the wire,
showing the alterations made.Ames read the message, and handed it back.Beyond the clouding of his
features he gave no indication of his feelings."So, you see," continued the girl, "that incident is closed--for all
time, isn't it?"Then:

"Rather odd, isn't it?"he commented, turning quite away from that
subject, and glancing about, "that one with the high ideals you
profess should be doing newspaper work.""There is nothing so
practical as the ideal, for the ideal is the only reality.""Well, just what, may I ask, are you trying to do here?""Run a newspaper on a basis of _practical_ Christianity," she
answered, her eyes dancing."Just as all business will have to be
conducted some day."she said, "to the carnal mind."The laughter abruptly ceased, and he looked keenly at her.But there
was no trace of malice in her fair face as she steadily returned the
look.Well, I'll wager you won't get a dollar back on your investment
for years."We are not measuring our profits
in money!""And your investment--let's see," he mused, trying to draw her out."You've put into this thing a couple of hundred thousand, eh?""I'll tell you," she said, "because money is the only
measure you have for estimating the worth of our project.Hitt has
put more than that amount already into the Express."Quite a little for you people to lose, eh?""You will have to change your tone if you remain here, Mr.You who owe your fellow-men what you can
never, never repay?Ames, there is no man in this whole wide
world, I think, who is so terribly, hopelessly in debt as you!"Why, I don't owe a dollar to any man!"she queried, bending a little closer to him."You do not owe
Madam Beaubien the money you are daily filching from her?Gannette the money and freedom of which you robbed him?You do not owe anything to the thousands of miners and mill hands who
have given, and still give, their lives for you?You do not owe for
the life which you took from Mrs.You do not owe for
the souls which you have debauched in your black career?For the human
wreckage which lies strewn in your wake?Haynerd
for the Social Era which you stole from him?"Ames remained rigid and quiet while the girl spoke.And when she had
finished, and they sat looking squarely into each other's eyes, the
silence was like that which comes between the sharp click of lightning
and the crash of thunder which follows.If it had been a man who thus
addressed him, Ames would have hurled him to the floor and trampled
him.As it was, he rose slowly, like a black storm-cloud mounting
above the horizon, and stood over the girl.She looked up into his face dauntlessly and smiled."Sit down," she
quietly said.Don't threaten, please," she
continued."It wouldn't do any good, for I am not a bit afraid of you.A faint smile began to play about Ames's mouth.Then he twitched his
shoulders slightly."I--I got up," he said, with an assumption of
nonchalance, "to--to read that--ah, that motto over there on the
wall."He went slowly to it and, stooping, read aloud:

               "Lift up the weak, and cheer the strong,
               Defend the truth, combat the wrong!You'll find no scepter like the pen
               To hold and sway the hearts of men.""That was written by your Eugene Field," offered the girl."Now read
the one on the opposite side.It is your _Tekel Upharsin_."He went to the one she indicated, and read the spiritual admonition
from Bryant:

          "Leave the vain, low strife
          That makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power--
          The passions and the cares that wither life,
          And waste its little hour.""Now," continued the girl, "that is only a suggestion to you of the
real handwriting on the wall.I put it there purposely, knowing that
some day you would come in here and read it."Ames turned and looked at her in dumb wonder, as if she were some
uncanny creature, possessed of occult powers.Then the significance of
her words trickled through the portals of his thought."You mean, I suppose," he said, "that if I am not persuaded by the
second motto I shall feel the force of the first, as it sways you,
eh?"Ames," she replied steadily, "that the world is entering
upon a new era of thought, and that your carnal views and methods
belong to a day that is past.This century has no place for them; it
wearies of the things you represent; you are the epitome of that evil
which must have its little hour of night before the reality dawns.""Am I to understand," he
asked, "that the Express, under its new management, is about to turn
muck-raker, and shovel mud at us men of wealth?""We are not considering the Express now, Mr."It
is I alone who am warning you.""Do Hitt and Haynerd bring against me the charges which you voiced a
moment ago?And do you intend to make the columns of your paper spicy
with your comments on my character and methods?I verily believe you
are declaring war!""We are in the business of declaring truth, Mr.It will not shield you when
you are the willing tool of evil, nor will it condone your methods at
any price."Very well," he replied with a bantering smile."I came over
here this noon to get the policy of your paper.Ames," she returned, "is the challenge which evil
always finds in good."I like a good enemy, and an honest one.Who's your general, Hitt or Haynerd?"Then he recovered himself, and
laughed."Do you know," he said, bending close to her, "I admire you _very_
much.Now let's see if we can't get
together on terms of peace.The world hasn't used you right, and I
don't blame you for being at odds with it.I've wanted to talk with
you about this for some time.The pin-headed society hens got jealous
and tried to kill you.But, if you'll just say the word, I'll set you
right up on the very pinnacle of social prestige here.I'll take you
by the hand and lead you down through the whole crowd of 'em, and
knock 'em over right and left!I'll make you the leading woman of the
city; I'll back the Express; we'll make it the biggest newspaper in
the country; I'll make you and your friends rich and powerful; I'll
put you in the place that is rightfully yours, eh?He was bending ever nearer, and his hand closed over hers when he
concluded.His eyes were looking eagerly into her face, and a smile,
winning, enticing, full of meaning, played about his lips.Carmen returned his smile, but withdrew her hand."I'll join you," she
said, "on one condition.""Go; sell that thou hast; and give to the poor.Then come, take up the
cross, and follow--my leader."He straightened up, and a sneer curled his lips."I suppose," he
coarsely insinuated, "that you think you now have material for an
illuminating essay on my conversation."The man's facial muscles twitched slightly under the sting, but he
retained his outward composure."My dear girl," he said, "it probably
has not occurred to you that the world regards the Express as utterly
without excuse for existence.It says, and truly, that a wishy-washy
sheet such as it, with its devitalized, strained, and bolted reports
of the world's vivid happenings, deserves to go under from sheer lack
of interest.The experiment has been tried before, and has signally
failed.But, say the word,
and--"

"And your money, as well as your business ideals, will be ours?"Ames," she said, "you have no ideals.No man who amasses millions
by taking advantage of the world's inhuman and pernicious social
system can have ideals worthy of the name.To apply your methods, your
thought, to the Express would result in sinking its moral tone into
the dust.As for your money--"

"Commit suicide, then!"cried the man, yielding to his rising anger."Let the Express go down, carrying you and your spineless associates
with it!But, remember, you will be the sole cause of its ruin, and
theirs!"Carmen rose quietly and opened the office door."Your half hour is up,
Mr.Ames," she said, glancing at the little clock on her desk; "and I
must return to my work."For a moment the huge man stood looking down darkling upon the girl.He would have given his soul if he could have clasped that slender
form in his arms!A sudden impulse assailed him, and bade him fall
upon his knees before her, and ask her forgiveness and guidance.She
stood waiting--perhaps just for that, and always with that same smile
into which no one had ever yet read aught but limitless love.Carmen hastened to answer the call.Yes--yes--the cotton schedule was reported out
quite changed--yes, an hour ago!"*       *       *       *       *

"Dearie," said the Beaubien at evening, as Carmen seated herself in
that woman's lap and wound her arms about her neck, "I am afraid for
you.""Well, mother dearest," replied the girl, giving her a tighter
squeeze, "that is a sheer waste of time.If you haven't anything more
to occupy you than fear, you'd better come down to the office, and
I'll set you to work.""But--you have defied him--as he says, declared war--"

"No, dearest, not that.It is the carnal mind, using him as a channel,
that has declared war against good.But evil is not power; nor has it
been given power by God.My one thought is this: Am I doing that which
will result in the greatest good to the greatest number?Not as evil would
want to be served, but as good.If my mental attitude is right, then
God's law becomes operative in all that I do, and I am protected."I know, dearie, but--there's the telephone!Oh, I do hope they don't
want you!"Carmen answered the call, and returned with the announcement that
Haynerd was in distress."Sidney Ames is--not there," she said.Now don't worry,
dearest; I--I won't go alone."A moment later she gave the
Beaubien a kiss, and hurried out into the night.In half an hour she
stood at Haynerd's desk."Here I
am, tied down, depending on Sid, and he's drunk!"Haynerd looked up at her, and hesitated."Mass meeting, over on the
East Side.Here's the address," taking up a slip of paper."Open
meeting, I'm told; but I suspect it's an I. W. W. affair.he
said, replying to a telephone call.The Ames mills at
Avon closed down this afternoon?He hung up the receiver and turned to Carmen."That's what this
meeting is about," he said significantly."Four thousand hands
suddenly thrown out at the Avon mills.Sidney Ames slouched into the editor's office and sank heavily into a
chair."Look here," he said, in
sudden desperation, "that fellow's got to be sobered up, now!Or
else--"

Another call came, this time from the Beaubien.Haynerd eagerly gave the
address over the 'phone, and bade him start at once."Now," he said, nodding at Carmen, and jerking his thumb over his
shoulder toward the intoxicated reporter, "it's up to you."Carmen rose at once and went to the lad."Come, Sidney," she said,
taking his hand.The boy roused dully, and shuffled stupidly after the girl into her
own little office.Carmen switched on the lights and closed the door.Then she went to
the limp, emaciated form crumpled up in a chair, and sat down beside
it."Sidney," she said, taking his hand, "there is but one habit--the
habit of righteousness.That is the habit that you are going to wear
now."Outside, the typewriters clicked, the telephones tinkled, and the
linotypes snapped.There were quick orders; men came and went
hurriedly; but there was no noise, no confusion.Haynerd toiled like a
beaver; but his whole heart was in his work.Carmen's little room voiced the sole discordant note that night.And
as the girl sat there, holding the damp hand of the poor victim, she
thanked her God that the lad's true individuality was His pure
thought of him.*       *       *       *       *

At dawn Sidney Ames awoke.A rosy-tinted glow lay over the little
room, and the quiet form at his side seemed an ethereal presence.A
gentle pressure from the hand that still clasped his brought a return
of his earthly sense, and he roused up.The gentle voice sounded to him like distant music."I--you--you brought me in here last night--but--" His hands closed
about the little one that lay in his grasp."You--haven't sat
here--with me--all night?"With a low moan the boy buried his face in her arms, and burst into a
flood of bitter tears."It isn't real, Sidney," she whispered, twining an arm about his neck.For some moments the lad sobbed out his shame and misery.Carmen
stroked his fair hair, and drew him closer to her, while tears of love
and pity coursed down her own cheeks.he cried,
struggling to his feet, while his eyes shone with a wild light.He started for the door, but Carmen darted past him and stood with her
back against it, facing him.she cried, holding her
hands against him._God reigns
here!_"

She turned the lock as he hesitated; then took his arm and led him,
trembling and shivering, back to his chair."We are going to meet this, Sidney, you and I," she whispered, bending
over the shaking form.The suffering lad shook his head and buried his face in his hands."You can't," he moaned; "you can't--I'm _gone!_" His voice died into a
tremble of hopeless despair, of utter surrender.She had faced many trying situations in her brief
life-experience; but, though she met it with dauntless courage and
knew its source, the insidious suggestion now persisted that the eyes
of her people were upon her, and that by this would stand or fall
their faith.Aye, the world was watching her now, keen-eyed and
critical.Would she give it cause to say she could not prove her faith
by her works?And then came the divine message that bade her "Know that I am
God!"--that bade her know that responsibility lay not upon her
shoulders, but upon the Christ for whom she was now called to
witness.To see, or permit the world to see, this mountainous error,
this heaped-up evil, as real and having power, meant a denial of the
Christ and utter defeat.It meant a weary retracing of her own steps,
and a long night of spiritual darkness to those whose eyes had been
upon her."Sidney," she said, turning to the sunken boy at her side, "you are
right, the old man _is_ gone.And now we are going to create 'new
heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered nor
come into mind'--as thought.Underneath are the everlasting arms, and
you have sunk down, down, down, until at last you rest upon them, and
you find that you haven't sunk at all, and that you couldn't possibly
get away from that infinite Love that is always drawing you to
itself!"She put her arm again about the lad, and drew him toward her."Listen,
Sidney dear, I am standing with you--and with me is omnipotent God!His arm is not shortened, that it can not save you from the pit of
spiritual oblivion into which human thought would seem to make you
think you had fallen, engulfed by the senses."The boy raised his head and looked at her through his bloodshot eyes.he whispered hoarsely; "you don't understand--"

"It is just because I _do_ understand, Sidney, that I am able to help
you," she interrupted quickly."It--it isn't only whiskey--it's--" his head sank again--"it's--morphine!"It's got the false thought that seems to call itself 'you,'" she
said.We'll
cling to them no longer, but shake them off for good.For good, I
said, Sidney--and that means, for _God_!"If there were a God, I shouldn't be
where I am now.""Then I will know it for you," she softly answered."And you are now
right where you belong, in Him.My
parents didn't teach it to their children.And when I tried to learn,
my father kicked me into the street!""Then, Sidney, I'll teach you.For I am in the world just to show what
love will do.""My father--it's his fault--all his fault!"cried the boy, flaring up
and struggling to rise.It's his fault
that I'm a sot and a drug fiend!""It is hate, Sidney, that manifests in slavery, in sodden brains, and
shaking nerves.You don't hate your father; the hate is against your
thought of him; and that thought is all wrong."I used to drink--some, when I lived at home," the boy went on, still
dwelling on the thoughts that held him chained."But he could have
saved me.And then I fell in love--I thought it was love, but it
wasn't.The woman was--she was years older than I. When she left the
city, I followed her.And when I found out what she was, and came back
home, my father threw me out--cut me off--God!""Never mind, Sidney," the girl whispered.But
she realized that the boy must voice the thoughts that were tearing
his very soul, and she suffered him, for it uncovered to her the
hidden sources of his awful malady."And then I drank, drank, drank!""And I lay in the
gutters, and in brothels, and--then, one day, Carlson told me to come
and work for him.And so I went to a
doctor, and he--God curse him!--he injected morphine into my arm to
sober me.And that taught me that I could drink all I wanted to, and
sober up on morphine.But then I learned--I found--"

He stopped, and began to fumble in his pockets.His eyes became wilder
as he searched.He caught her wrist and twisted
it painfully."I am not
afraid to see evil seem to have power!"Then aloud: "I know what you
are searching for, Sidney.Listen, and I will give it
to you.It is in love--right here--the Christ-principle, that is bigger far
than the demons that seem to tear you!I have _all_ power from God,
and you, evil, _can not touch me_!"The boy started at the ringing voice, and loosened his grasp.Then he
sank back into his chair, shaking as with palsy.We
don't have to struggle--we don't have to fight--we only have to
_know_.All that you are wrestling with is the world-wide belief that
there is a power apart from God!_There is none!_ Any claim that there
is such a power is a lie!There is no power or intelligence in whiskey or morphine!The Christ-principle will save you!There
is nothing beyond its reach, not even your problem!"It is a problem, that's all, Sidney," she went on, as he became
calmer.Will you put yourself in my charge,
in my care, and let me meet it for you?"She bent over him and looked
eagerly into his drawn face."We are not going to fight," she continued."We are not going to
resist evil as the world does, and so make it real.I know, dear, just
how pressing your need is.I know how
awfully real it seems to you.But trust me, as I trust the Christ.For a few moments they sat together, hand in hand."I am going to
take you home with me.I am going to keep you right with me, right
under my thought.I'm going to be the mirror, constantly with you,
that reflects infinite love to you every moment.Don't think of anything
else now, excepting that God has your hand and is leading you."She took his arm and drew him, unresisting, yet uncomprehending, to
the door.As she opened it, she looked up into his face and smiled.she cried, shifting her grasp to his hand.And I shall not turn you over to yourself again until the problem
is solved!"Hitt met them as they came out of the room."Well," he said, "I've
kept Madam Beaubien informed as well as I could."We'll be back at three--perhaps."*       *       *       *       *

But at three that afternoon the Beaubien telephoned to Hitt that
Carmen would not be down."She will not leave the boy," the woman said."She holds him--I don't
know how.And I know he is trying desperately to help her.But--I
never saw any one stand as she does!Lewis is here, but he doesn't
interfere.We're going to put a bed in his room, and Sidney will sleep
there.Haynerd stormed; but the tempest was all on the surface."I know, I
know," he said, in reply to Hitt's explanation."That boy's life is
more to her than a million newspapers, or anything else in the
universe just at present.The devil can't look her in the
face!I--I wish I were--What are you standing there for?In the little Beaubien cottage that afternoon the angry waves of human
fear, of human craving, of hatred, wrath, and utter misery mounted
heaven-high, and fell again.As the
night-shadows gathered, Sidney Ames, racked and exhausted, fell into a
deep sleep.Then Carmen left his bedside and went into the little
parlor, where sat the Beaubien and Father Waite."Here," she said, handing a hypodermic needle and a vial of tablets to
the latter.And now," she continued, "you must
work with me, and stand--firm!Sidney's enemies are those of his own
mental household.We have got to
uproot from his consciousness the thought that alcohol and drugs are a
power.Hatred and self-condemnation, as well as self-love, voiced in a
sense of injury, are other mental enemies that have got to be driven
out, too.It is all mental, every
bit of it!You have got to know that, and stand with me.We are going
to prove the Christ-principle omnipotent with respect to these seeming
things."But," she added, after a moment's pause, "you must not watch this
error so closely that it can't get away.For if
you do, you make a reality of it--and then, well--"

"The case is in your hands, Carmen," said Father Waite gently."We
know that Jesus would cure this boy instantly, if he were here--"

"Well--the Christ _is_ here!""Put
away your 'ifs' and 'buts.'"And these," he said, holding out the
needle and vial, "shall we have further use for them?""It will be given us what we are to do and say," she returned.CHAPTER 9


Four weeks from that crisp morning when Carmen led the bewildered,
stupified lad to her home, she and Sidney sat out upon the little
porch of the cottage, drinking in the glories of the winter sun.January was but half spent, and the lad and girl were making the most
of the sudden thaw before the colder weather which had been predicted
might be upon them.What these intervening weeks had been to Carmen, none might have
guessed as she sat there with the sunlight filtering in streamlets of
gold through her brown hair.But their meaning to the boy might have
been read with ease in the thin, white face, turned so constantly
toward his fair companion.They were deeply, legibly written there,
those black nights, when he would dash out into the hall, determined
to break through the windows of the nearest dram shop and drink,
drink, drink, until the red liquor burst from his eyes, his mouth, his
nostrils!Those ghastly nights, when Carmen would stand before him,
her arms outspread across the door, and beat back the roaring devils
within him!Those long days of agonized desire for the vicious drug
which had sapped his manhood!Those fell hours, when low curses poured
from his burning lips upon her and upon all mankind!Those cold,
freezing sweats, and the dry, cracking fever!Those hours when, with
Carmen always by his side, he tramped mile after mile through drifts
and ice, until he dropped at length from sheer exhaustion, only to
awake, hours later, to find that the girl had brought him home, safe,
unharmed!--

And then, oh, the "Peace, be still!"which he began to hear, faint at
first, but growing in volume, until, at last, it became a mighty,
thunderous command, before which the demons paled and slunk away,
never to return!Oh, the tears of agony that had given way to tears of
joy, of thanksgiving!Oh, the weakness that had been his strength!And, oh, the devotion of this fair girl--aye, and of her associates,
too--but all through her!Had she proved her God before the eyes of
the world?Day after day, clad in the impenetrable armor
of her love, she had stood at this struggling lad's side, meeting the
arrows of death with her shield of truth!Night after night she had
sat by his couch, her hand crushed in his desperate grasp, flouting
the terror that stalked before his delirious gaze!What work she had
done in those long weeks, none would ever know; but the boy himself
knew that he had emerged from the valley of the shadow of death with a
new mind, and that she had walked with him all the dark, cloud-hung
way.As they sat there in the bright sunlight that morning, their thought
was busy with the boy's future.Old plans, old ambitions, had seemed
to lift with the lifting of the mortal curse which had rested upon
him, and upward through the ashes of the past a tender flower of hope
was pushing its way.The last tie which
bound him to his family had been severed by his own father two weeks
before, when the shadow of death fell athwart his mother's brilliant
path.J. Wilton Ames, delicate in health when recalled from
abroad, and still suffering from the fatigue of the deadly social
warfare which had preceded her sudden flight from her husband's
consuming wrath, had failed to rally from the indisposition which
seized her on the night of the grand Ames reception.For days she
slowly faded, and then went quickly down under a sharp, withering
attack of pneumonia.A few brief weeks after the formal opening of the
Ames palace its mistress had sighed away her blasted hopes, her vain
desires, her petty schemes of human conquest and revenge, and had gone
to face anew her problems on another plane of mortal thought.It was
rumored by the servants that, in her last hours, when she heard the
rustle of the death angel's wings beside her, a great terror had
stricken her, and she had called wildly for that son whom she had
never cared to know.It was whispered that she had begged of her
husband to seek the lad and lead him home; that she had pleaded with
him to strive, with the boy, to find the better things of life; that
she had begged him to warn and be warned of her present sufferings, as
she lay there, stripped of every earthly aid, impoverished in heart,
in soul, in mind, with her hands dusty and begrimed with the ashes of
this life's mocking spoils.What truth lay hidden in her mad ravings about the parentage of
Carmen, and her confused, muttered references to Monsignor Lafelle, no
one knew.But of those who stood about her bedside there was none who
could gainsay the awed whisperings of the servants that this haughty
leader of the great city's aristocracy had passed from this life into
the darkness beyond in pitiable misery and terror.The news of his mother's death had come at a time when the boy was
wild with delirium, at an hour when Waite, and Hitt, and Carmen stood
with him in his room and strove to close their ears against the
shrieking of the demon that was tearing him.Hitt at once called up
Willett, and asked for instructions.A few minutes later came the
message that the Ames house was forever barred against the wayward
son.And it was not until this bright winter morning, when the lad
again sat clothed and in his right mind, that Carmen had gently broken
the news to him."I never knew her," the boy had said at length, rousing from his
meditations."Few of the rich people's children know their parents.I
was brought up by nurses and tutors.I never knew what it was to put
my arms around my mother, and kiss her.And often I would plan to surprise her by suddenly running into her
arms and embracing her.But then, when I would see her, she was always
so far away, so cold, so beautifully dressed.And she seldom spoke to
me, or to Kathleen, until we were grown up.And by that time I was
running wild.And then--then--"

"There!"admonished Carmen, reaching over and taking his hand."That's
in our little private cemetery, you know.The old error is dead, and
we are not going to dig it up and rehearse it, are we?""I'm like a little baby," he said sadly."I'm just
beginning to live.And you are my mother, the only one I've ever
known.""Let me be your sister," she said."We are so
near of an age, you know.""You are my angel," he murmured."What have I told you
so often that Jesus said?'Of mine own self I can do nothing.'It was--" her voice sank to a whisper--"it was the
Christ-principle.It worked through him as a channel; and it worked
through me.""You're going to teach me all about that," he said, again pressing her
hand to his lips."You won't cast me adrift yet, will you, little
sister?"Why, you're still mine, you
know!I haven't given you back to yourself yet, have I?But now let's
talk about your work.If you want to write, you are going to, and you
are going to write _right_.""Back to the Express," she said lightly."I haven't written a word for
it now for a month.And how dear, funny old Ned has scolded!""You--you dropped everything--your work--all--for a poor, worthless
hulk like me," he sighed."Sidney dear," the girl replied.Everything I do is '_as unto Him_.'I would have done the same for
anybody, whether I knew the person or not.I saw, not you, but the
human need--oh, such a need!And the Christ-principle made me a human
channel for meeting it, that is all.Drop my work, and my own
interests!Why, Sidney, what is anything compared with meeting human
needs?Didn't Jesus drop everything and hurry out to meet the sick and
the suffering?Was money-making, or society, or personal desire, or
worldly pleasure anything to him when he saw a need?You don't seem to
understand that this is what I am here for--to show what love will
do.""I--I guess I know only the world's idea of love.""And that is love's counterfeit, self-love, sentimentalism,
sex-mesmerism, and all that," she added."But now, back to your work
again.You're going to write, write, write!My, but the world is
hungry for _real_ literature!Your yearning to meet that need is a
sign of your ability to do it.But, remember, everything that comes to
you comes from within.You are, in fact, a miner; and your mine is
your mind; and that is unlimited, for God is the only mind, infinite
and omnipresent.We
never fear a real thing; we fear only our false thoughts of things.Always those thoughts are absolutely wrong, and we wake up and find
that we were fearing only fear-thoughts themselves.Now destroy the chains of fear which limit your thought,
and God will issue!"Well," without waiting for his reply, "now you have reached that
plane of thought where you don't really care for what the world has to
offer you.You have ceased to want to be rich, or famous.You are not
afraid to be obscure and poor.You have learned, at least in part,
that the real business of this life lies in seeking good, in
manifesting and expressing it in every walk, and in reflecting it
constantly to your fellow-men.Having learned that, you are ready to
live.Remember, there is no luck, no such thing as chance.The cause
of everything that can possibly come to you lies within yourself.The thought that you allow to enter
your mentality and become active there, later becomes externalized.Be, oh, so careful, then, about your thought, and the basis upon which
it rests!For, in your writing, you have no right to inflict false
thought upon your credulous fellow-mortals.""But," he replied, "we are told that in literature we must deal with
human realities, and with things as they are.The human mind exists,
and has to be dealt with.""The human mind does not exist, Sidney, except as supposition.The world still awaits the one who will show
it things as they _really_ are.Human realities, so-called, are the
horrible, ghastly unrealities of carnal thought, without any basis of
the divine Christ-principle.I know, we are told that the great books
of the world are those which preserve and interpret its life.is
it true greatness to detail, over and over again in endless recital,
the carnal motives of the human mind, its passions and errors, its
awful mesmerism, its final doom?Yes, perhaps, on one condition: that,
like a true critic, you picture human concepts only to show their
unreality, their nothingness, and to show how they may be overcome.""But most books--"

"Ah, yes, most books are written only to amuse the dispirited human
mind for a brief hour, to make it forget for a moment its troubles.They are literary narcotics; they are sops to jaded appetites, that's
all.A book, for example, that pictures an injured man discovering a
great treasure, and then using it to carry out his schemes of
revenge--well, what influence for good has such a work?It is only a
stimulus to evil, Sidney.But had it shown him using that great wealth
to bless his persecutors and turn them from their mesmerism to real
life and good--"

"Such things don't happen in this world, Carmen.""But they could, and should, Sidney dear.Then will come the new literature, the literature of _good_!And it
will make people think, rather than relieve them from the ennui of
solid thought, as our present novels do.The intellectual palate then
will find only insipidity in such books as pour from our presses now.The ability to converse glibly about authors who wallow in human
unrealities will then no longer be considered the hall-mark of
culture.Culture in that day will be conformity to truth.""Little sister," he said,
"you are a beautiful idealist.""But," came her quick reply, "are you not a living illustration of the
practicability of my idealism, Sidney?"The boy choked, and tears filled his eyes.Carmen stole an arm about
him."The most practical man who ever lived, Sidney dear, was Jesus.He had ideas that differed very
radically from other people's, but he did not hide them for fear of
giving offense.He was not afraid to shock people with the truth about
themselves.He tore down, yes; but he then reconstructed, and on a
foundation of demonstrable truth.He was not afraid to defy the
Rabbis, the learned, and the puffed-up.He did not bow abjectly before
the mandarins and pedagogues.Had he done so, and given the people
what they wanted and were accustomed to, they would have made him a
king--and his mission would have been a dead failure!""And for that they slew him," returned the boy."It is the cowardly fear of slaughter, Sidney, that keeps people from
coming out and standing for what they know to be right to-day.You are
not one of those cravens.""But the people who do that, Carmen, are called demagogues and
muck-rakers!""And the muck-rakers, Sidney, have made a sorry mess,
haven't they?They destroy without ruth, but seldom, if ever, put
forth a sane suggestion for the betterment of conditions.They traffic
in sensationalism, carping criticism, and abuse.'To find fault,' said
Demosthenes, 'is easy, and in every man's power; but to point out the
proper remedy is the proof of a wise counselor.'The remedy which I
point out, Sidney, is the Christ-principle; and all I ask is that
mankind seek to demonstrate it, even as Jesus bade us do.He was a
success, Sidney, the greatest success the world has ever known.Because he followed ideals with utter loyalty--because he voiced
truth without fear--because he made his business the service of
humanity.He took his work seriously, not for money, not for human
preferment, but for mankind.And his work bears the stamp of
eternity.""You're _not_ afraid, Sidney!""Oh, why
does the human mind always look for and expect that which it does not
want to see come or happen!"The boy laughed heartily at the quick sally of her delightfully
quotidian thought."You didn't let me finish," he said."I was going
to say that I'm afraid if I write and speak only of spiritual things I
shall not be understood by the world, nor even given a hearing.""Well, don't use that word 'afraid.'how the human mind clings to
everything, even words, that express its chief bogy, fear."And yet, has anything, written or
spoken, ever endured as his spiritual teachings?The present-day novel
or work of fiction is as fleeting as the human thought it attempts to
crystallize.Of the millions of books published, a handful endure.Those are they which illustrate the triumph of good over evil in human
thought.And the greatest of such books is the Bible.""Well, I'm hunting for a subject now."It will drive you to the task of transcribing it.Sidney--perhaps I can give you the subject!Perhaps I am the channel for this, too!""Well," bending over closer to her,
"what is it, little sister?"The girl looked out over the dripping shrubs and the soft snow.She saw a man, a priest, she knew not
where, but delving, plodding, digging for the truth which the human
mind has buried under centuries and centuries of material _debris_.She saw him, patiently bearing his man-made burden, striving to shield
a tender, abandoned girl, and to transfer to her his own great worldly
knowledge, but without its dross.She saw the mighty sacrifice, when
the man tore her from himself, and thrust her out beyond the awful
danger in which he dwelt.It was love--aye, the love that alone makes men great, the love
that lays down human life in self-immolating service.I will tell
you the whole beautiful story.It is an illustration of the way love
works through human channels.And perhaps--perhaps, some day, the book
may reach him--yes, some day.And it will tell him--oh, Sidney, it
will tell him that I know, and that I love him, love him, love him!"*       *       *       *       *

In the office of the manager of the Express three heads were close
together that morning, and three faces bore outward evidence of the
serious thought within."Miss Wall tells me, Ned," Hitt was saying, "that her father used to
be associated with Ames, and that, at his demise, he left his estate,
badly entangled, for Ames to settle.Now it transpires that Ames has
been cunning enough to permit Miss Wall to draw upon his bank almost
without limit, he making up any deficit with his own personal notes.""I think I see the shadow of his fine hand!""And now," resumed Hitt, "she is given to understand that Ames has
been obliged by the bank examiner to withdraw his personal notes as
security for her deficits, and that the revenue from her estate must
be allowed to accrue to the benefit of the Ames bank until such time
as all obligations are met.""In other words, Elizabeth is simply
cut off!"And now, another thing: Madam Beaubien's lawyer called on
her to-day, and informed her that Hood had gone into court and secured
an injunction, tying up all revenue from her estate until it can be
unraveled."Ames is out to do up
the Express, eh?""There is no doubt of it, Ned," returned Hitt seriously."And to
utterly ruin all connected with it.""Then, by God, we'll fight him to the last ditch!""I think you forget, Ned, that we have a lady with us," nodding toward
Miss Wall, "and that you are seriously trying to reform, for Carmen's
sake.""I beg your pardon, Elizabeth," said Haynerd meekly."I really am
trying to be decent, you know.But when I think of Ames it's like a
red rag to a bull!""Of course," Hitt continued, "oil still flows from our paternal wells.But in order to raise money at once I shall be obliged either to sell
my oil holdings or mortgage them.They have got to take care of us all
now, including Madam Beaubien."There's another anomaly: while Ames is trying to
ruin us, that girl is saving his son."I--I beg your pardon,
Elizabeth.The fact is, either you or I will have to retire from this
meeting, for I'm getting mad.I like to hear your sulphurous
language to-day.It helps to express my own feelings," replied the
woman."The circulation of the Express," Hitt went on, "is entirely
artificial.Our expense is tremendous, and our revenue slight.And
still Carmen insists on branching out and putting into practical form
her big ideas.Limitation is a word that is not in her vocabulary!""Hitt, can't we fight Ames with his own fire?"Ames is very cunning," answered Hitt."When he learned that the
cotton schedule had been altered in the Ways and Means Committee, he
promptly closed down his Avon mills.Then
he resumed, but on half time.I presume
he will later return to full time, but with a reduced scale of wages.This
way: he will force a strike at Avon--a February strike--four thousand
hands out in the cold.Meantime, he'll influence every other spinner
in the country to do likewise.Now, can
Congress stand up against that sort of argument?And, besides, he will
grease the palms of a large number of our dignified statesmen, you may
be sure!"Hitt," said Miss Wall, "I suggest that you send Carmen to Avon at
once.I know of no one who can get to the bottom of things as she can.Let her collect the facts regarding the situation down there, and
then--"

"Send her first to Washington!""Have her hang
around the lobbies of the Capitol for a while, and meet a lot of those
old sap-heads.What information she won't succeed in worming out of
them isn't in 'em, that's all!""But," objected Hitt, "if she knew that we would use her information
for a personal attack upon Ames, she'd leave us.""There's no objection to her getting the facts, anyway, is there?"demanded Haynerd, waxing hot again.I'll put a mortgage on my Ohio holdings at once.""I don't think I would be afraid," suggested Miss Wall."We might not
use the information Carmen may collect in Avon or Washington, but
something, I am sure, is bound to come out of it.Something always
comes out of what she does."All well and good," put in Haynerd."And yet, if she finds anybody
down there who needs help, even the President himself, she'll throw
the Express to the winds, just as she did in Sidney's case."No, that's true, Ned, for while we preach she's off somewhere
practicing.We evolve great truths, and she applies and demonstrates
them.But she has saved Sidney--her Christ did it through her.And she
has given the lad to us, a future valuable man.""Sure--if we are to _have_ any future," growled Ned."See here," retorted Hitt, brindling, "have we in our numerous
gatherings at Madam Beaubien's spoken truth or nonsense?If you
believe our report, then accept and apply it.Now who's to go to Avon
with Carmen?"Why, if those Magyars down there
discovered he was Ames's son, they'd eat him alive!"Then, turning to his
companions:

"Waite says he wants a meeting to-night.He'd like to report on his
research work.No
telling when we may get together again, if the girl--" He became
suddenly silent, and sat some time looking vacantly out through the
window."She goes to Avon to-morrow," he abruptly announced, "alone."His
thought had been dwelling on that'something not ourselves' which he
knew was shielding and sustaining the girl.CHAPTER 10


"We have now arrived at a subject whose interest and significance for
us are incalculable," said Father Waite, standing before the little
group which had assembled in their usual meeting place in the first
hours of the morning, for only at that time could Hitt and Haynerd
leave the Express."We have met to discuss briefly the meaning of that
marvelous record of a whole nation's search for God, the Bible.As
have been men's changing concepts of that'something not ourselves
that makes for righteousness,' so have been individuals, tribes, and
nations.The Bible records the development of these concepts in
Israel's thought; it records the unquenchable longings of that people
for truth; it records their prophetic vision, their sacred songs,
their philosophy, their dreams, and their aspirations.To most of us
the Bible has long been a work of profound mystery, cryptical,
undecipherable.And largely, I now believe, because we were wont to
approach it with the bias of preconceived theories of literal, even
verbal, inspiration, and because we could not read into it the record
of Israel's changing idea of God, from a wrathful, consuming Lord of
human caprice and passions, to the infinite Father of love, whom Jesus
revealed as the Christ-principle, which worked through him and through
all who are gaining the true spiritual concept, as is this girl who
sits here on my right with the lad whom you have seen rescued by the
Christ from the pit of hell."His voice choked when he referred to Carmen and Sidney.But he quickly
stifled his emotion, and went on:

"In our last meeting Mr.Hitt clearly showed us how the so-called
human mind has seemed to develop as the suppositional opposite of the
mind that is God; and how through countless ages of human reckoning
that pseudo-mind has been revealing its various types, until at
length, rising ever higher in the scale of being, it revealed its
human man as a mentality whose consciousness is the suppositional
activity of false thought, and which builds, incessantly, mental
concepts out of this kind of thought and posits them within itself as
material objects, as its own body, its universe, its all.And he
showed us how, little by little, that human mind's interpretations of
the infinite mind's true ideas became better, under the divine
infiltration of truth, until at last there developed a type, now known
to us as the Jewish nation, which caught a clearer glimpse of truth,
and became conscious of that'something not ourselves' which makes
for right-thinking, and consequent correct mental concepts and
externalizations.This, then, was the starting point of our religion.These first glimpses of truth, and their interpretations, as set forth
in the writings of the early Jewish nation, constitute the nucleus of
our Bible."But were these records exact statements of truth?The
primitive human mind could only lisp its wonderful glimpses of truth
in legend and myth.And so in fable and allegory the early Israelites
sought to show the power of good over evil, and thereby stimulate a
desire for right conduct, based, of course, on right-thinking.And
thus it is that the most significant thing in their sacred records is
their many, many stories of the triumph of the spiritual over the
material.Their right-thinking
became externalized outwardly in material abundance and physical
comfort.But the people's understanding was not sufficiently great to
shield them from the temptation which material wealth and power always
constitute.The mist of
materialism spread over it.Those wonderful flashes of truth ceased to
dart across their mental horizon.Their god became a magnified concept
of the human man, who dickered with them over the construction of his
temples, and who, by covenants, bribes, and promises, induced them to
behave themselves.And at length the beautiful vision
faded quite away."Then followed four hundred human years, during which the vicissitudes
of the Hebrew nation were many and dark.But during those long
centuries there developed that world wonder, a whole nation's united
longing for a deliverer!The prophets promised a great change in their
fallen fortunes.Though
their concept of Him had grossly degenerated, yet the deliverer would
come, he _must_!In the depths of their night--in the midst of the
heaviest darkness that ever lay over the world--there arose a great
light.Through the densest ignorance of the human mind filtered the
Christ-principle, and was set forth by the channel through which it
came, the man Jesus.Had there been a conference among God, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, to debate the sending of salvation to mankind, as
recorded by the poet Milton?what a crude, materialistic
conception.Had God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son?But God _is_ Love, infinite, unchanging.And His unique Son, the
Christ-principle, available to all mankind, was 'before Abraham.'Had
a great, dimly perceived principle been demonstrated, namely, that,
if we yearn long and earnestly for the right, it comes?Had the Jewish
nation 'demonstrated' the Christ?Had their centuries of looking and
expecting resulted in a saviour being manifested to them?It was a
period in the unfolding of human thought when civilization had reached
its lowest depths.Morality had evaporated to the dregs.Rome was
become the world's harlot.A few years more, and Nero would drag his
vulpine immorality across the stage.Paganism was virtue in comparison
with the lust of men in that dark hour.And yet, in the very midst of
it, appeared the most venerated, the most beloved man in all history,
bearing the Christ-message like a flaming torch!"'Always our being is descending into us,' said Emerson.But our true
being can be none other than infinite mind's idea of itself.Our true
individuality must be the way that mind regards us.And thus it was
that Israel's true being descended, filtering in through the thick
mists of error.That true being was the deliverer, _par excellence_,
for it was the message of truth that bade men deny themselves, their
carnal selves, and know but the one God, infinite mind.That was the
grace sufficient for them, that would have solved their problems, that
would have enabled them to lay off the 'old man' and his woes and
afflictions, and put on the 'new man,' divine mind's image.But the
carnal mind sought a material kingdom.It wanted, not spirit, but
matter.It cruelly rejected the message-bearer, and sought to kill his
message by slaying him on the cross.And thereby the Jewish nation
rent itself asunder, and sank into carnal oblivion.Ah, how they have
been cursed by the crucifixion of Jesus!"Men ask to-day: Did Jesus really live?Or is he a mythical character,
like the gods of pagan Rome?Let us ask, in making our reply, how
truth comes to mankind?Then the great sayings attributed to Jesus at least came from a human
being.Let us go further: it is the common history of mankind that
truth comes to the human mind only after a period of preparation.Not
conscious preparation, necessarily, but, rather, a preparation forced
by events.The truth of a mathematical principle can not come to me
unless I am prepared to receive it.And the greatest good comes to men
only after they have learned the nothingness of the material ambitions
and aims which they have been pursuing.By its own rottenness the
world had been made fallow for truth.The awfulness of its own
exposure in its rampant, unlicensed revels, had shown as never before
the human mind's absolute nothingness--its nothingness as regards real
value, permanence, and genuine good--in that first century of our
so-called Christian era.And when the nothingness of the carnal mind
was made plain, men saw the reality of the truth, as revealed in the
Christ, back of it all.The divine message was whispered to a human
mentality.And that mentality expanded under the God-influence, until
at last it gave to the sin-weary world the Christ-principle of
salvation.Let us call that human mentality, for convenience, the man
Jesus."And now, was he born of a virgin?It
was common enough in his day for virgins to pretend to be with child
by the Holy Ghost; and so we do not criticise those who refuse to
accept the dogma of the virgin birth.But a little reflection in the
light of what we have been discussing throws a wonderful illumination
upon the question.If matter and material modes are real, then we must
at once relegate the stories of the virgin birth, the miracles, the
resurrection, and the ascension to the realm of myth.If the so-called
laws of matter are real, irrefragable laws, then we indulgently, pass
by these stories as figments of heated imaginations.But, regarding
matter as a human, mortal concept, entirely mental, and wholly subject
to the impress and influence of mind, and knowing, as we do now, that
_mental concepts change with changed thought_, we are forced to look
with more favor upon these questions which for centuries caused men to
shed their fellows' blood.Hitt pointed out in our last meeting that mortal beings are
interpretations in mortal or human mind of the infinite mind, God, and
its ideas.The most perfect human interpretation of God's greatest
idea, Man, was Christ Jesus.The _real_ selfhood of every one of us is
God's idea of us.The world calls it the
'soul,' the 'divine essence,' and the 'immortal spark.'The Christ was
the real, spiritual selfhood of the man Jesus.So the Christ is the
real selfhood of each of us.It is not
conceived and brought forth in conformity with human modes.Now was
this great fact externalized in the immaculate conception and birth?It does not grow and decay and pass away in death.It is the 'unique'
Son of God which is back of each one of us.But the world has seen it
only once in its fullness, and then through the man Jesus."Something happened in that first century of the so-called Christian
era--something of tremendous significance.It was the
birth of the Christ-idea into the human consciousness.Was the
Christ-idea virgin-born?Aye, that it was, for God, infinite Mind,
alone was its origin and parent.The speculation which has turned
about that wonderful first century event has dealt with the human
channel through which the Christ-idea flowed to mankind.But let us
see what light our deductions throw even upon that."Referring all things to the realm of the mental, where we now
know they belong, we see that man never fell, but that Israel's idea
of God and man did fall, woefully.We see that the Christ-principle
appeared among men; we see that to-day it works marvels; we must
admit that throughout the ages before Jesus it had done so; we
know now that the great things which Israel is recorded to have
done were accomplished by the Christ-principle working through
men, and that when their vision became obscured they lost the
knowledge of that principle and how to use it.History records the
working of great deeds by that same Christ-principle when it was
re-born in our first century; and we also can see how the obscuring
of the spiritual by the material in the Emperor Constantine's time
caused the loss of the Church's power to do great works.We are
forced to admit the omnipotence, immanence, and eternality of the
Christ-principle, for it is divine mind, God himself.Moses, Elisha,
Elijah, the ancient prophets, all had primitive perceptions of truth,
and all became channels for the passing of the Christ-principle to
mankind in some degree.But none of these men ever illustrated that
principle as did the man Jesus.He is the most marvelous manifestation
of God that has ever appeared among mankind; so true and exact was
the manifestation that he could tell the world that in seeing him
they were actually seeing the Father.It is quite true that many
of his great sayings were not original with him.Great truths have
been voiced, even by so-called pagans, from earliest times.But he
demonstrated and made practical the truth in these sayings.And he
exposed the nothingness of the human mental concept of matter by
healing disease, walking the waves, and in other wonderful ways.It
is true that long before his time Greek philosophers had hit upon the
theory of the nothingness of matter.Plato had said that only ideas
were real.But Jesus--or the one who brought the Christ-message--was
the clearest mentality, the cleanest human window-pane, to quote
Carmen, that ever existed.Through him the divine mind showed with
almost unobscured fullness.God's existence had been discerned and
His goodness proved from time to time by prophets and patriarchs, but
by no means to the extent that Jesus proved it.There were those
before him who had asserted that there was but one reality, and that
human consciousness was not the real self.There were even those who
believed matter to be created by the force of thought, even as in
our own day._But it remained for Jesus to make those ideas
intensely practical, even to the overcoming and dissolution of his
whole material concept of the universe and man._ And it remained
for him to show that the origin of evil is in the lie about God.It
was his mission to show that the devil was 'a man-killer from the
beginning,' because it is the supposition that there is power apart
from God.It was his life purpose to show mankind that there is
nothing in this lie to cause fear, and that it can be overcome by
overcoming the false thought which produces it.By overcoming that
thought he showed men the evanescent nature of sickness and death.And sin he showed to be a missing of the mark through lack of
understanding of what constitutes real good."Turn now again to the Bible, that fascinating record of a whole
people's search for God and their changing concept of Him.Note that,
wherever in its records evil seems to be made real, it is for the
purpose of uncovering and destroying it by the vigorous statements of
truth which you will almost invariably find standing near the
exposition of error.So evil seemed very real in the first century of
our era; but it was uncovered by the coming of Jesus.The exposure of
evil revealed the Christ, right at hand.""But," protested Haynerd, "let's get back to the question of the
virgin birth.""But let us first consider what
human birth is.""Now you are touching my lifelong
question.If I am immortal, where was I before I was born?""Of which 'I' are you speaking, Ned?""The real
'I' is God's image and likeness, His reflection.It was never born,
and never dies.And therefore it will
cease to be.The human mind makes its own laws, and calls them laws of
nature, or even God's laws.Because
God is both Father and Mother to His children, His ideas, the human
mind has decreed in its counterfeiting process that it is itself both
male and female, and that the union of these two is necessary in order
to give rise to another human mind.Do you see how it imitates the
divine in an apish sort of way?And so elements of each sex-type of
the human mind are employed in the formation of another, their
offspring.The process is wholly mental, and is one of human belief,
quite apart from the usage of the divine Mind, who'spake and it was
done,' mentally unfolding a spiritual creation.The real 'you,' Ned,
has always existed as God's idea of Himself.It will come to light as the material 'you' is put off.The
material 'you' did not exist before it was humanly born.It was
produced in supposition by the union of the parent human minds, which
themselves were reflections of the male and female characteristics of
the communal mortal mind.It thus had a definite, supposititious
beginning."And so I'm doomed to annihilation, eh?"Your mortal sense of existence, Ned, certainly is doomed to
extinction.Oh, it doubtless
will not all be destroyed when you pass through that change which we
call death.It may linger until you have passed through many such
experiences.And so it behooves you to set about getting rid of it
as soon as possible, and thus avoid the unpleasant experience of
countless death-throes.You see, Ned, an error in the premise will
appear in the conclusion.Now you are starting with the premise that
the human 'you' is real.All that you reflect of divine mind will
endure permanently, but whatever you reflect of the lie regarding
that mind will pass away.Human beings know nothing of their origin,
nor of their existence._Because there is nothing to know
about them; they are entirely supposititious!_ Paul says, in his
letter to the Romans: 'They which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God.'The birth of the children of the
flesh is wholly a human-mind process.The infant mentality thus
produced knows nothing whatsoever of itself.It has no knowledge; is
not founded on truth.It will later manifest hereditary beliefs,
showing the results of prenatal mesmerism.Then it will receive the
general assortment of human thought and opinion--very little of it
based on actual truth--which the world calls education.Then it
learns to regard itself as an individual, a separate being.And soon
it attributes its origin to God.But the prenatal error will appear
in the result.The being manifests every gradation of human thought;
it grows; it suffers and enjoys materially; it bases its very
existence upon matter; it manifests the false activity of human
thought in material consciousness; and then it externalizes its
beliefs, the consentaneous human beliefs, upon its body and in its
environment; and finally, the activity of the false thought which
constitutes its consciousness ceases--and the being dies.Yes, its
death will be due to sin, to '_hamartio_,' missing the mark.And that, Ned, is human life, so-called."Death is not in any sense a cessation of life.The being who dies
never knew what it was to live.Death is the externalization of
human, mortal beliefs, which are not based upon real knowledge, truth.Paul said: 'They that are after
the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the
spirit the things of the spirit.'In other words, mankind are striving
terribly, desperately, to keep alive a sense of material, fleshly
existence.They are foredoomed to failure,
despite the discovery of antitoxins.In the book of Job we read: 'The
spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given
me life.'Where, then, is the reality in prenatal mesmerism and the
drag of heredity?It is all supposition, all a part of the one lie,
the'man-killer.'"The change called death comes to all mortals.It is the culmination
of the human mind's sense of limitation.It does not usher them into
immortal, illimitable bliss.It but leaves them upon another seeming
plane of mortal thought, there to drag out another sense of existence,
unless they have so learned the lesson which Jesus taught as to enable
them to overcome death.Why, then, do we waste our time
in trivial things; in the heaping up of useless money; in the vain
strife for sensual pleasures?The mortal will live and die, and live
and die, until at last he is beaten into line and forced to
demonstrate the Christ-principle.Hadn't we better begin that right
here and now?Wishing to die doesn't solve our problems.Suicide only
makes us start again, worse off than before.We shall overcome death
when we have overcome sin, for the physical manifestation called death
is but the externalization in conscious experience of spiritual
death--lack of a demonstrable understanding of Life, Truth, Spirit,
which is God, unlimited good.""And the Church, Protestant and Catholic, with their ceremonies, their
Masses, and--"

"They have woefully missed the mark, Ned.But I see protest rising in our good friends, Doctor Siler and
Reverend Moore, so I will hasten on, for we have much ground still to
cover."Now, knowing that birth is a humanly mental process, is it possible
that the man Jesus was 'born of a virgin'?Quite so; but, more, _no
man ever conceived and born in the way human beings are generated has
ever begun to approach Jesus in degree of spirituality_.If he had
been born in human ways, is it likely that he would ever have
developed such intense spirituality?Well, not in a brief thirty-three
years or so!And, on the other hand, if he had come into the world in
some way other than by being born of a woman, would he have been
understandable at all to the human mind?He would have
been wholly in the realm of the mental, far above human perception.If
he had been conceived by the union of the two sexes, as is the
mortal-mind mode of generation, would he not have been too material to
have so quickly developed that spirituality which made him the light
of the world at the age of thirty-three?The theory of the virgin birth at least seems to meet the
need of a sort of middle course, whereby the man should not be too
human to be the channel for the great measure of spirituality with
which he was endowed, and yet should be human enough to be appreciable
to other human minds."Remember, the Jesus who has been reported to us must have regarded
matter as unreal, as nothingness.And
they as plainly show that he came from the Father.His whole life was
such as to render the virgin birth almost a necessity, as I see it.And from a study of the Gospels I
simply can not avoid the conclusion that his knowledge of the allness
of God rendered matter such a nonentity to him that he overcame all
material laws, overcame the world of matter, and even at the last
dematerialized his material body.It's an astonishing thought--and
yet, who can show that it is not true?There are some things that
reason insists on our accepting, despite the paucity of human
records."Waite," said Doctor Morton, "that the Gospels
according to Mark and John make no mention of the virgin birth."And I will go further: Biblical
research during the past few years seems to have established the
conclusion that Mark's Gospel antedates the others, but that prior to
it there existed a collection of sayings by Jesus, called the _Logia_.This collection of sayings seems to have been originally written in
Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke.Now Matthew Arnold tells us that
the Gospel narratives passed through at least fifty years of oral
tradition before they became fixed in the form in which we now have
them.Of course it is quite possible that the story of the virgin
birth arose during those fifty years, for we can imagine how the life
of Jesus was then discussed!Matthew and Luke alone speak of the
virgin birth.Mark's Gospel we believe to have been written by Mark
himself.And we believe that Papias, who wrote about the middle of the
second century, spoke truly when he said: 'Mark having become (or
having been) Peter's interpreter, wrote all that he remembered (or all
that Peter related) though he did not (record) in order that which
was said or done by Christ.'In other words, even as Renan admits,
the Gospel of Mark must be taken as authentically his.Now Matthew's
Gospel depends for most of its data upon Mark and the Collection of
sayings.Mark's Gospel does not mention the virgin birth; the
Collection probably did.Also, Matthew probably did not write the
Gospel attributed to him; but he almost certainly did write the
Collection of sayings, from which in part the present Gospel according
to Matthew was compiled.Luke's Gospel was undoubtedly written by the
physician Luke, Paul's companion, and depended largely for its data
upon Mark's Gospel and the Collection of Matthew.Yet we can not say
that the omission of mention in the Gospels according to Mark and John
of the virgin birth renders the story a legend, in view of our own
present great knowledge of the constitution of matter, of material
laws, and of the fact that the virgin birth is at least rendered
credible by the subsequent very extraordinary career of Jesus.Moreover, remember that our New Testament is a small book, and that it
is quite probable that a great mass of literature existed on the
subject of Jesus and his work, and that it is possible that other of
the disciples wrote treatises, perhaps many of them.How many of these
touched on the subject of the virgin birth we may never know.But this conclusion at least we must accept: the
validity of the story of the virgin birth does _not_ rest with the
four Gospels which have come down to us out of the great mass of
literature which probably once existed.Rather is the probability of
the immaculate conception a function of our present knowledge of
matter, its pseudo-laws, and the great fact that the entire life of
Jesus as reported in all the Gospels lends weight to the belief that
his birth was not in the ordinary mortal-mind manner.""And I," said Carmen, "can not see that the origin of the human
channel through which the Christ-principle flowed to mankind is of any
consequence.Jesus said that it
existed before Abraham."It has been said that the
immaculate conception was the result of Mary's realization that real
man is the son of God.Certainly Jesus
did seem to manifest some such metaphysical idea.Perhaps Mary was a
woman of tremendous force of character.Perhaps it did come to her
that her son should be the Messiah of his race.Jesus certainly did
acquire the messianic consciousness--and thereby upheaved the world.But, whatever the human mode of birth, certainly the Christ-principle
was brought into the world because of the world's tremendous need.It is only the confusing of the Christ with the
man Jesus that is so largely responsible for the weakness of orthodox
theology."But now, referring again to the Bible, let me say that the Pentateuch
is composed of a variety of documents written by various authors.We
have no positive proof that Moses had aught to do with its authorship,
although parts of it may be based on data which either he originated
or sanctioned.The books of Samuel exhibit a plurality of sources.The
book of Isaiah was written to record the sayings of at least two
persons, both men of marvelous spiritual vision.The Song of Solomon
was originally probably a Persian love-poem.The book of Job
illustrates the human-mind problem of suffering, and the utter
inadequacy of philosophy to heal it.It is a ringing protest against
conventional theology."But it is with the New Testament that we are particularly concerned,
for we believe it to contain the method of salvation from human ills.None of the original documents are extant, of course.And yet, the
most searching textual criticism goes to show that the New Testament
books as we have them to-day are genuine reproductions of the original
documents, with but very little adulteration of erroneous addition by
later hands.I have already spoken of the first
three Gospels.The book of Acts certainly was written by the author of
the third Gospel, Luke.First Peter was composed by the disciple
Peter, or was written under his sanction.The Gospel of John and the
book of First John were written by one and the same author--but
whether by the disciple John or not, I can not say.If this great
disciple did not write the Fourth Gospel, at least his influence seems
to be felt all through it.The probability is that he knew what was in
it, and approved of it, although the actual composition may have been
by another, possibly a very learned Greek.To me, the Fourth Gospel is
the most masterly work ever composed by man.The criticism that John, being a Jew, could not have composed
it, falls before the greater truth that, having become a Christian, he
was no longer a Jew.For how could he have been
other, seeing that he had lived with Jesus?"And now as to Paul, who contributes about one-third of the New
Testament.I have mentioned the letters to the Thessalonians,
Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans as indisputably his.To these we
can add, with scarcely less weight of authenticity, Colossians,
Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians.As to the Epistles to Timothy
and Titus, there is still doubt.These letters were written to the
various Churches chronologically, as I have mentioned them.It has
been said that Jesus was way over the heads of his reporters.But--and
here is the important fact for us--Paul's letters exhibit a
marvelous spiritual growth in the man, and show him at last to be the
grand master-metaphysician of the Christian era.Has it ever
occurred to you that what the Gospels tell about is almost wholly
spiritual?The material is all but neglected by their composers.Indeed, with the questions of time and place, the Gospel narrators
seemed to have been but slightly concerned.But with the delineation
of the Christ--ah!In the light of
this great truth the apparent lack of harmony in the Gospel
narratives loses significance.And how little there is in the
Gospels of theology, of institution, of organization!How trifling are
creed and doctrine, how little are Catholicism and Protestantism,
compared with the stupendous fact that God is, and that His truth,
the Christ-principle, is still here to-day and available!"And so with Paul, he was expounding the'method and secret' of the
Christ.And he first had to work up to it himself.He may have
thought, when he wrote his first letter to the Thessalonians, that the
man Jesus would come again in the skies, with great pomp and
surrounded by the Saints.But in his second letter he states plainly
that the Christ will come when the 'old man' is laid off.Not much
occasion for misunderstanding there, I think.Indeed, after Jesus so
clearly stated that the kingdom of heaven was within men, the marvel
is that there could have arisen any confusion whatsoever on the
subject of the second coming of the Christ.""I believe," interposed Reverend Moore, "that the Epistle to the
Hebrews contains statements of belief in a judgment after death, in a
heaven, a hell, and everlasting life, not wholly consistent with your
remarks.""The Epistle to the Hebrews," returned Father Waite, "was not written
by Paul, nor is it quite consistent with his letters.But, read Paul's
wonderful eighth chapter of Romans.Read his third chapter of First
Corinthians.Read all his letters in the order in which I have
mentioned them, which was as they were written, and you can not fail
to grasp his marvelous expanding perception of the Christ-principle;
the nothingness of the material concept; the impotence of the lie that
opposes God, and constitutes all evil; and the necessity of
right-thinking if one would work out his salvation from the errors
that assail mankind.Paul shows that he passed through a 'belief
period,' and that he emerged into the light of demonstrable
understanding at last.If men had followed him they never could have
fallen into the absurd theological beliefs of foreordination, infant
damnation, the resurrection of the flesh, and all the other
theological horrors and atrocities of the centuries."Yes, the Bible is, as Arnold said, based on propositions which all
can verify.The trouble is, _mankind have not tried to verify them_!They have relegated all that to the life beyond the grave.I fear a
sorry disappointment awaits them, for, even as Paul says, they will be
after the change called death only what they were before.It is like
recovering from a case of sickness, for sickness and death are alike
manifestations of mortal thought.We awake from each still human,
still with our problems before us.We must break the mesmerism of the
belief that the practical application of Jesus' teachings must be
relegated to the realm of death, or to the unattainable.We must apply
the Christ-principle, and learn to hit the mark, for sin is always
weakness, never strength."And remember this: having acquired a knowledge of the Christ, we are
bidden to acknowledge him--that is, to _act-our-knowledge_.Many of
the world's philosophers have worked out great truths.But they have
rested content with that.Many scientists, knowing that matter is
unreal, nevertheless conduct themselves _as if it constituted the one
and only real fact of existence_!Then its
opposite _can not_ be real.The human mentality holds the belief that
there is something apart from God, spirit.That belief becomes
objectified in the human mentality as matter.And within matter is
contained all evil of every sort and name.Evil is not, as the
philosophers would have us believe, a lower form of good.It is not
'good in the making.'It is always error, the direct opposite of
truth.And if truth is real and eternal, error can not be.See the
grave mistake in which Emerson became enmeshed.He said: 'There seems
to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms.'Now
follow that out to its logical conclusion.If spirit is synonymous
with God, then God manifests Himself in both good and evil, fair and
foul, life and death--and which is good, and which bad?No, my friends, rather accept Jesus' statement
that evil is the lie, of which no man need be afraid, and which all
must and shall overcome.And the 'old man,' with all his material
concepts of nature and the universe, must and will be laid off, thus
revealing the spiritual man, the image and likeness of the one divine
Mind."Now, just a few words about miracles, the great stumbling block to
the acceptance of the Gospels.Are they, together with the entire
Gospel narrative, legendary?If so, they must have arisen during
those fifty years between Jesus and the recording of the narratives.But this very period is covered by Paul's letters, which record his
thought.And even the most relentless of Bible critics admit the
genuineness of Paul's authorship of the Epistles to the Romans,
the Corinthians, the Thessalonians, and the Galatians.If the
Gospel narratives are legends, they grew up and found acceptance in
fifty years.A pretty fair miracle in itself, when we take into
consideration the inherent incredulity of the human mind!As Dean
Farrar says: 'Who would have _invented_, who would have merely
_imagined_, things so unlike the thoughts of man as these?'"Now Paul must have been acquainted with men who had seen and known
Jesus.And we are forced to admit that Paul was a very strong, sane
man.These legends could not have grown up in his day and been
accepted by him.And as long as there were men living who had known
Jesus--and that must have been as late as the last quarter of the
first century--the true events of Jesus' life could hardly have given
way to a set of childish legends.As a matter of recorded fact, the
various Christian Churches had accepted Jesus within thirty years of
the crucifixion.And, too, the words of Paul and the Synoptists were
written at a time when the sick were still being healed and even the
dead raised by the practical application of Jesus' teachings.Hence,
miracles did not astonish them."Our own inability to perform the works attributed to Jesus is hardly
sufficient ground for denying the belief that he really did them.Certainly that the greater portion of the New
Testament was written by a few fishermen, a publican, and a tentmaker
is one of the most stupendous miracles on record!And the miracle of
miracles is Jesus Christ himself!Because Jesus is reported to have
healed the sick, raised the dead, and walked the waves, all in
opposition to material laws--the so-called laws of nature--the world
says the reports are fantastic, that they are fables, and that his
reporters were hypnotized, deluded!And yet I tell you that he did not
break a single law!He did act in defiance of the so-called testimony
of the physical senses, which has always been accepted by mankind as
law.We now know what that sense-testimony is--human, mortal thought.And because he did so,
he instantaneously healed the sick.A miracle expresses, not the
beliefs of the human mind, but the law of God, infinite mind, and
makes that law conceivable to the human mentality.God's laws are
_never_ set aside, for by very definition a law is immutable, else it
ceases to be law.But when the human mind grows out of itself
sufficiently to perceive those laws and to express them to its
fellow-minds, the result is called a miracle.Moreover, the ability to
perform miracles is but a function of spirituality.A miracle is a
sign of one's having advanced to such a degree of spirituality as to
enable him to rise above material consciousness and its limitations,
which are called laws.The consciousness that knows no evil will
perform miracles.These works
were the'signs following,' and attested their knowledge of the
allness of God.Carmen--"

"Lewis!"Carmen _knew_ that no power opposed to God
could hold Sidney.She broke a human-mind, so-called law, a limitation.She
proved God's law of harmony and holiness--wholeness--to be omnipresent
and omnipotent.And, mark me, friends, _every one of us must learn to
do likewise_!Not only must the Church obey Jesus and do the works
which he did, but every individual will have to do them himself.""His works were done for a special reason, Mr.Waite," interposed
Reverend Moore."They were to testify to his messiahship.Father Waite silently regarded the minister for some moments.Then he
went on gently:

"It seems incredible that the plain teachings of Jesus could have
been so warped and twisted as they have been by orthodox theology.Why should even the preachers themselves
condemn the one who seeks to obey Christ?Moore, the real man
is God's highest idea of Himself.The human mind makes mental concepts
of God's man.And Jesus was the grandest concept of God's idea of
Himself that the human mind has ever constructed by means of its
interpretations.One of his grandest
characteristics was his implicit obedience to his vision of the
Father.And he demanded just as implicit obedience from us.But he
bade us, again and again, _heal the sick and raise the dead_!"And Asa had his physicians to whom he turned--with the result
that he'slept with his fathers.'There is no more ironical statement
in the whole Bible than that.We turn to our physicians because we
have no faith in God._Materia medica_ physicians do _not_ heal the
sick.They sometimes succeed in causing the human mind temporarily to
substitute a belief of health for a belief of disease that is all.But Jesus and the early Christians healed by true prayer--the prayer
of affirmation, the prayer that denied reality to evil, and affirmed
the omnipotence of God.And that was done through an understanding of
God as immutable law, or principle."demanded Reverend Moore, with a note
of contempt in his voice."I prefer my own concept of God, as one who
hears our petitions, and pities us, and not as a lifeless principle!"Moore," replied Father Waite, "in that He is
'_that by which all is_.'And in order to be such He must be, as the
Bible says, 'the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.'He must be
immovable, regardless of human pleading and petition.And so true
prayer, the prayer that draws an answer, is not an objective appeal to
Him, but is an intelligent application of the Christ-principle to all
our problems and needs.Such prayer will remove mountains in
proportion to the understanding and motive back of it.And such prayer
does not seek to inform the Almighty of the state of affairs here
among men, informing Him that evil is real and rampant, and begging
that He will stoop down and remove it.It is the prayer that manifests
man's oneness with the infinite mind as its image, reflecting a
knowledge of the allness of good and the consequent unreality and
powerlessness of evil, the lie about it.It was healing by such
prayer, Mr.Moore, that the Episcopal Synod rejected only recently.Instead of doing the healing themselves by means of the principle
given them, they still plead with God, the immovable and immutable, to
do it for them, provided the very uncertain science of _materia
medica_ fails."The true method of prayer was employed by the early Christians, until
the splendid vision of the Christ became obscured and finally lost to
the Church by its bargaining with Constantine for a mess of pottage,
namely, temporal power.Then began to rise that great worldly
institution, the so-called Holy Church.In the first half of the sixth
century Justinian closed the schools of philosophy at Athens.For a
while Judaizing Christianity continued its conflict with Gnosticism.And then both merged themselves into the Catholic form of faith, which
issued forth from Rome, with Christian tradition grafted upon
paganism.Theology and ritualism divided the gospel of healing the
sick and saving the sinner into two radically different systems,
neither of which is Christian, and neither of which can either heal or
save.Since then, lip-service and ceremonial have taken the place of
healing the sick and raising the dead.The world again slipped back
steadily from the spiritual to the material, and to-day ethics
constitutes our religion, and stupid drugs hold sway where once sat
enthroned the healing Christ-principle."Waite, that I have Catholic leanings myself,"
said Doctor Siler."I don't like to hear either my religion or my
profession abused.""My criticism, Doctor," replied Father Waite, "is but an exposure of
the entrenched beliefs and modes of the human mind.""But, sir, the Church is a great social force, and a present
necessity.""The worth of a belief as a social force, Doctor, must be ascertained
from its fruits.The Roman Church has been an age-long instigator of
wars, disorders, and atrocious persecutions throughout the world.Its
assumption that its creed is the only religious truth is an insult to
the world's expanding intelligence.Its arrogant claim to speak with
the authority of God is one of the anomalies of this century of
enlightenment.Its mesmeric influence upon the poor and ignorant is a
continuous tragedy."Are you unmindful of the Church's schools and
hospitals?"Nor am I ignorant of the fact that the success of
Christianity is _not_ measured by hospitals.Rather, their continuance
attests the lamentable failure of its orthodox misinterpretation.I do not want to see this splendid country
forced into the iron shackles of priestcraft."cried Haynerd, pounding the table with his
fist."The time has passed when a man can say, 'My church, be she
right or wrong, but my church!'and insist that it shall be forced
upon us, whether we like it or not!""Doctor," continued Father Waite, "the Romanist has always missed the
mark.He prayed to a God of love to give him power to exterminate
heretics--those who differed with him in belief.But he prayed with
iniquity, hatred, murder in his heart; and God, who is too pure to
know evil, heard him not.Prayer is the affirmation of omnipotent
_good_.Is it good to murder one's fellow-men?The Psalmist wrote: 'If
I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.'That is why
the Church's prayers and curses have failed, and why she herself is a
failing institution to-day.I say this in pity, not in malice.""I, sir, believe in a religion that can hate," returned the doctor."Christianity is as much a religion of hate as of love--hatred of all
that is evil and opposed to the revealed Word of God.""And thereby your religion will fail, and has failed, for God is love.You, by your hatred of what you consider evil, make evil real.Indeed,
the Church has always emphasized evil as a great and living reality.How could it ever hope to overcome it then?Your Church, Doctor, has
little of the meekness of the Christ, and so, little of his strength.Its numbers and great material
wealth do not constitute power.Its assumptions remind me of the
ancient Jews, who declared that God spent much of His time reading
their Talmud.You will have to lay aside, Doctor, all of it, and turn
to the simple, demonstrable teachings of Jesus.When you have learned
to do the works he did, then will you have justified yourself and your
faith."While Father Waite was speaking, Carmen had quietly risen and taken
her place at the piano.When he concluded, she began to play and sing
softly.As the sweet melody flowed out through the room the little
group became silent and thoughtful.Again it was that same weird
lament which the girl had sung long before in the Elwin school to
voice the emotions which surged up in her during her loneliness in the
great city.In it her auditors heard again that night the echoing
sighs of the passive Indians, enslaved by the Christian Spaniards.Hitt's head sank upon his breast as he listened.Haynerd tried to
speak, but choked.The Beaubien buried her face in her hands and wept
softly.The lines about Doctor Siler's mouth relaxed, and his lips
trembled.He rose quietly and went around to where Father Waite sat."My friend--" He bent and took Father Waite's hand.Father Waite sprang to his feet and threw an arm about the doctor."We
are more than that, Doctor," he whispered.And in
reality we are both, here and now, beloved children of God."Then he nodded to the others, and took his
departure.As he passed the piano Carmen rose and seized his hand."You know, Doctor, that we love you, don't you?""Your love," he murmured, as he bent over her hand, "is from the
Christ.Nay, it _is_ the Christ himself among us!"He would have said more, but his voice broke.When Hitt, Reverend Moore, and Doctor Morton had left, Haynerd, who
had remained for a moment to speak to Father Waite, turned to the
Beaubien."Madam," he said, "Mr.But--" He stopped and looked at Carmen."Well,
if I mistake not, his quietness this evening indicated his belief that
this might be our last meeting for some time."Then, abruptly:

"Telephone me, Carmen, if anything of interest comes up to-morrow in
Avon."The Beaubien turned quickly to the girl."You are going to Avon
to-morrow?There was a look of fear in her
eyes.Carmen drew the woman to her, then stooped and kissed her cheek."Mother dearest, I go to Avon with my God."CHAPTER 11


The town of Avon, two hours from New York, lay along Avon creek, from
which its first manufacturing industries derived their motive power.Years before, when it was little more than a barren stretch of sand,
some enterprising soul had built a cotton mill there, with only a few
primitive looms.As the years passed, and kindly Congresses reared
about the industry a high protective wall, the business prospered
marvelously.But shortly after the death of the senior Ames the
company became involved, through mismanagement, with the result that,
to protect itself, the house of Ames and Company, the largest
creditor, was obliged to take over its mills.At first, J. Wilton Ames was disposed to sell the assets of the
defunct company, despite the loss to his bank.But then, after a visit
of inspection, and hours of meditation on certain ideas which had
occurred to him, he decided to keep the property.The banging of the
looms, the whirr of the pickers, the sharp little shrieks of the
spinning machines, fascinated him, as he stood before them.They
seemed to typify the ceaseless throbbing of his own great brain.They
seemed, too, to afford another outlet for that mighty flood of
materialistic thought and energy which flowed incessantly through it.And so he set about reorganizing the business.He
familiarized himself with every detail of the cotton market.He was
already well versed in the intricacies of the tariff.And soon the
idle machinery was roaring again.Soon the capacity of the mills was
doubled.And soon, very soon, the great Ames mills at Avon had become
a corporate part of our stupendous mechanical development of the
century just closed.When Carmen stepped from the train that morning she stood for a moment
looking uncertainly about her.Everywhere on one side as far as she
could see were low, ramshackle frame houses; a few brick store
buildings stood far up the main street; and over at her right the
enormous brick mills loomed high above the frozen stream.The dull
roar of the machinery drifted through the cold air to her ears.Up the
track, along which she had just come, some ragged, illy clad children
were picking up bits of coal.She went directly to them, and asked their names."Anton Spivak," answered one of the children dully, when she laid a
hand on his shoulder."Over dere," pointing off to the jungle of decrepit sheds."Me an'
him, we worked in de mills; but dere ain't no work fer us now."Take me to your home," she said firmly."Dere ain't nobody to home," he
replied."De ol' man an' woman works in de mills daytimes.""Come-a home wi' me," spoke up the boy's companion, a bright-faced
little urchin of some ten years who had given his name as Tony Tolesi.Carmen looked at him for a moment.Up the main street of the town they went for a short distance, then
turned and wended their course, through narrow streets and byways,
down toward the mills.In a few minutes they were in the district
where stood the great frame structures built by the Ames company to
house its hands.Block after block of these they passed, massive,
horrible, decrepit things, and at last stopped at a grease-stained,
broken door, which the little fellow pushed open.Carmen followed shivering, close after the boy, while
he trotted along, proud of the responsibility of conducting a visitor
to his home.At the far end of the hall the lad plunged into a narrow
staircase, so narrow that a stout man could not have mounted it.Up
four of these broken flights Carmen toiled after him, and then down a
long, desolate corridor, which sent a chill into the very marrow of
her bones."Dis is where we lives, Missy," announced the little fellow."Miss-a
Marcus, she live in dere," pointing to the door directly opposite.He pushed open the door before which they had halted.A rush of foul
air and odors of cooking swept out.They enveloped the girl and seemed
to hurl her back.A black-haired woman, holding a crying baby in her
arms, rose hastily from an unmade bed at one side of the room.Two
little girls, six or eight years of age, and a boy still younger,
ranged about their mother and stared in wide-eyed wonder."Dis-a lady, she come to visit," announced Carmen's guide abruptly,
pointing a dirty finger at her.The woman's face darkened, and she spoke harshly in a foreign tongue
to the little fellow."She say," the boy interpreted, as a crestfallen look spread over his
face, "she say she don't spik _Inglese_.""But I speak your language," said the girl, going quickly to her and
extending a hand.Then, in that soft tongue which is music celestial
to these Neapolitan strangers upon our inhospitable shores, she added,
"I want to know you; I want to talk to you."A littered, greasy cook stove
stood in one corner.Close to it at either end were wooden couches,
upon which were strewn a few tattered spreads and blankets, stained
and grimy.A broken table, a decrepit chest of drawers, and a few
rickety chairs completed the complement of furniture.The walls were
unadorned, except for a stained chromo of the Virgin, and the plaster
had fallen away in many places.Several of its panes were broken and stuffed with rags and papers.At the sound of her own language the woman's expression changed.A
light came into her dull eyes, and she awkwardly took the proffered
hand.Then, sweeping
the girl's warm attire with a quick glance, "You are rich!I am rich, yes, but not in money."The woman turned to her children and sent the little brood scattering.At another sharp command little Tony set out a soiled, broken chair
for Carmen.But before the girl could take it the woman's voice again
rose sharply."You are--what do
you say?You come with your gay party to look us over and go
away laughing!But reaching out, she gently lifted the heavy
baby from the woman's arms and sat down with it.For a moment she
patted its cheeks and bent tenderly over it.Then she looked up at the
bewildered mother."I have come here," she said softly, "because I love you."She turned dully and sat down
on one of the begrimed beds.Her little ones gathered about her, their
soiled fingers in their mouths, or clutching their tattered gowns, as
they gazed at the beautiful creature who had suddenly come into their
midst."I am not from the mission," replied the girl gently."I have come to
talk, not of heaven, but of earth, and of you, and of Tony," smiling
down into the eager face of the little boy as he stood before her."You can't take
any of my children!The judge took Pietro Corrello's boy last
week--but you can't have mine!"I don't want your children," said Carmen, smiling up at the
frightened, suspicious mother.I want you to help me to
help all of these people here who need us.The mills are running only
half time, aren't they?But we,
you and I, are going to make things better for them, for everybody
here, aren't we?"But first," she went on hastily, to further allay the poor woman's
fears and to check additional protest, "suppose we plan our dinner.Let's see, Tony, what would you like?"He glanced
inquiringly at his mother; but no sign came from her.Then he could no
longer contain himself:

"Spaghetti!"Carmen drew out her purse and turned to the woman."While we are gone, Tony and the children will wash the dishes
and set the table.For a moment the woman looked uncomprehendingly at the girl, then at
her children, and then about the miserable room in which they were
huddled.Amazement and confusion sat upon her heavy features.Then
these gave way to another dark look of suspicion.She opened her
mouth--

But before she could voice her resentment, Carmen rose and threw an
arm about her.Then the girl quickly drew the startled woman to her
and kissed her on the cheek."Come," she whispered, "get your shawl.God's universal language is the language of love.All nations, all
tribes understand it.The flood-gates, long barred, swiftly opened,
and the tired, miserable woman sank sobbing upon the bed.She could
not comprehend what it was that had come so unannounced into her
dreary existence that cold winter morning.People were not wont to
treat her so.Her life had been an endless, meaningless struggle
against misery, want, grinding oppression.People did not put their
arms around her and kiss her thus.They scoffed at her, they abused
her, they fought with her!She hated them, and the world in which she
lived!"I know, I know," whispered Carmen, as she drew the sobbing woman's
head upon her shoulder.She drew back, and a frightened, superstitious look came into her
face."Yes," said Carmen softly, taking the cue, "I am an angel, right from
heaven.Now you are no longer afraid of me, are you?The woman rose mechanically and took up her thin shawl.Carmen gave a
few directions to the gaping children.And as she went out into the
bleak hall with the woman she heard one of them whisper in tones of
awe:

"Tony, she said she--she was--an angel!Get down on your knees
and cross yourself!"*       *       *       *       *

Upward to the blue vault of heaven, like the streaming mists that
rise through the tropic moonlight from the hot _llanos_, goes the
ceaseless cry of humanity.Oh, if the god of the preachers were real,
his heart must have long since broken!Upward it streams, this
soul-piercing cry; up from the sodden, dull-brained toiler at the
crashing loom; up from the wretched outcast woman, selling herself
to low passions to escape the slavery of human exploitation; up from
the muttering, ill-fed wreck, whose life has been cashed into
dividends, whose dry, worthless hulk now totters to the scrap heap;
up from the white-haired, flat-chested mother, whose stunted babes
lie under little mounds with rude, wooden crosses in the dreary
textile burial grounds; up from the weak, the wicked, the ignorant,
the hopeless martyrs of the satanic social system that makes
possible the activities of such human vultures as the colossus
whose great mills now hurled their defiant roar at this girl, this
girl whose life-motif was love.Close about her, at the wretched little table, sat the wondering group
of children, greedily gorging themselves on the only full meal that
they could remember.And with them sat the still bewildered mother,
straining her dark eyes at the girl, and striving to see in her a
human being, a woman like herself.At her right sat the widow Marcus,
who lived just across the hall.Her husband had been crushed to death
in one of the pickers two years before.The company had paid her a
hundred dollars, but had kept back five for alleged legal fees.She
herself had lost an arm in one of these same pickers, long ago,
because the great owner of the mills would not equip his plant with
safety devices.said the mother at length, as a sense of the reality of
life suddenly returned to her.Tony hurriedly swept the contents of his plate into his mouth, and
went for the battered dinner pail."My man goes to work at six-thirty in the morning," she explained to
Carmen, when the little fellow had started to the mills with the pail
unwontedly full."And he does not leave until five-thirty.He was a
weaver, and he earned sometimes ten dollars a week.And so he had to take a job as carder.He earns
about eight dollars a week now."But you can't live on that, with your children!""Yes, we could," replied the woman, "if the work was steady.You see, if I could work steady, and the children too, we could
live.And I am not nearly so worn out as he is.I
have several years left in me yet."The widow Marcus, who spoke the language from an association with
Italian immigrants since childhood, added her comments from time to
time.She was a gray-haired, kindly soul, bearing no enmity toward the
man to whom she had yielded her husband's life and her own."A man's no good in the mills after he's fifty," she said."You see,
Miss, it's all piece-work, and a man has to be most terribly spry and
active.The strain is something awful, day after day, in the noise and
bad air, and having to keep your eyes fixed on your work for ten hours
at a stretch; and he wears out fast.Then he has to take a job where
he can't make so much.And when he's about fifty he's no good for the
mills any more.""Well, if he hasn't any children, he goes to the poor-house.But, if
he has, then they take care of him.""Yes, they've got to, Miss.The little ones must work in the mills,
too.These mills here take them on when they are only twelve, or even
younger.Tony has worked there, and he is only ten.It's against the
law; but Mr.The company paid me some money two years ago, and I
haven't spent all of it yet.I'm pretty
spry with one arm.""But--you do not pay rent for your home?"Ames--the man whose machines killed your
husband and took off your arm--you still pay rent to him, for one
little room?"Why, his company gave me almost a
hundred dollars, you know!I was lucky, for when Lizzie Sidel's man
lost his hand in the cog wheels he went to law to sue the company, and
three years afterward the case was thrown out of court and he had to
pay the costs himself.But he was a picker-boss, and got nine dollars
a week."A little hand stole up along Carmen's arm.She looked down into the
wondering face of the child."I--I just wanted to see, _Signorina_, if
you were real.""I have been wondering that myself, dear," replied the girl, as her
thought dwelt upon what she had been hearing."I must go now, Miss," said the widow Marcus, rising."I promised to
drop in and look after Katie Hoolan's children this afternoon."Then I will go with you," Carmen announced."But I will come back
here," she added, as some little hands seized hers."If not to-day,
then soon--perhaps to-morrow."Marcus, and entered the doorway
which led to the little inner room where dwelt the widow.There were a
dozen such rooms in the building, the latter informed her.This one in
particular had been shunned for many years, for it had a bad
reputation as a breeder of tuberculosis.But the rent was low, and so
the widow had taken it after her man was killed.It contained a broken
stove, a dirty bed, and a couple of unsteady chairs.The walls were damp, and the paper which had once covered them
was molding and rotting off."It won't stay on," the widow explained, as she saw the girl looking
at it.The
creek overflows and runs into the basement.They call this the
'death-room.'"Carmen shuddered when she looked about this fearful human
habitation.Yet, "The only death to be feared," said Paracelsus, "is
unconsciousness of God."Was this impoverished woman, then, any less
truly alive than the rich owner of the mills which had robbed her of
the means of existence?And can a civilization be alive to the Christ
when it breeds these antipodal types?"Ames's
methods are the epitome of hell!But he is ours, and the worthy
offspring of our ghastly, inhuman social system.We alone are to
blame that he debauches courts, that he blinds executives, and that he
buys legislatures!We let him make the laws, and fatten upon the
prey he takes within their limits.Aye, he is the crafty, vicious,
gold-imbruted manifestation of a whole nation's greed!"Nay, more, he
is the externalization of a people's ignorance of God.Carmen's throat filled as she watched the old woman bustling about the
wretched room and making a feeble attempt at order."You see," the widow went on, happy in the possession of an auditor,
"there is no use making apologies for the looks of my room; I couldn't
make it look much better if I tried.We have
to get water from the hydrant down back of the house.It is pumped
there from the creek, and it's a long climb up these stairs when
you've got only one arm to hold the bucket.And I have to bring my
coal up, too.The coal dealer charges extra for bringing it up so
far."Carmen sat down on an empty box and watched her.The woman's lot
seemed to have touched the depths of human wretchedness, and yet there
burned within her soul a something that the oppression of human
avarice could not extinguish."It's the children, Miss, that I think about," she continued."It's
not so bad as when I was a little one and worked in the cloth mills in
England.I was only six when I went into the mills there.I worked
from seven in the morning until after six at night.And the air was so
bad and we got so tired that we children used to fall asleep, and the
boss used to carry a stick to whip us to keep us awake.My parents
died when I was only eight.They worked in the Hollow-ware works, and
died of lead poisoning.People only last four or five years at that
work.""How many children are employed in these mills here?""I want to see them," said the girl, and there was a hitch in her
voice as she spoke."You can go down and watch them come out about six this evening.But now I must hurry to look after the Hoolan
babes."When she again reached the street Carmen turned and looked up at the
hideous structure from which she had emerged; then she drew a long
breath.The foul air of the "death-room" seemed to fill her lungs as
with leaden weights.The dim light that lay over the wretched hovel
hung like a veil before her eyes."Katie lives a block down the street," said the widow, pointing in the
direction.These tenements don't have
fire-escapes, and the one she lived in burned to the ground in an
hour.She lived on the second floor, and got out.It seemed to Carmen as she listened to the woman that the carnal
mind's chamber of horrors was externalized there in the little town of
Avon, existing with the dull consent of a people too ignorant, too
imbruted, too mesmerized by the false values of life to rise and
destroy it.All that cold winter afternoon the girl went from door to door.There
was no thought of fear when she met dull welcomes, scowls, and
menacing glances.In humble homes and wretched hovels; to Magyar,
Pole, Italian alike; to French Canadian, Irish and Portuguese; and to
the angry, the defiant, the sodden, the crushed, she unfolded her
simple banner of love, the boundless love that discriminates not, the
love that sees not things, but the thoughts and intents of the heart
that lie behind them.And dark looks faded, and tears came; withered
hearts opened, and lifeless souls stirred anew.She knew their
languages; and that knowledge unlocked their mental portals to her.She knew their thoughts, and the blight under which they molded; and
that knowledge fell like the sun's bright rays upon them.She knew
God, their God and hers; and that knowledge began, even on that dull,
gray afternoon, to cut into the chains of human rapacity which
enslaved them.At six that evening she stood at the tall iron gate of the mill yard.Little Tony was at her side, clutching her hand.A single electric
lamp across the street threw a flickering, yellow light upon the snow.The great, roaring mills were ablaze with thousands of glittering
eyes.Suddenly their monster sirens shrieked, a blood-curdling yell.Then their huge mouths opened, and a human flood belched forth.They were not the image and likeness
of God, these creatures, despite the doctrinal platitudes of the
Reverend Darius Borwell and the placid Doctor Jurges.They were not
alive, these stooping, shuffling things, despite the fact that the
religiously contented Patterson Moore would argue that God had
breathed the spirit of life into the thing of dust which He created.And these children, drifting past in a great, surging throng!Fathers
and mothers of a generation to come!Carmen knew that many of them,
despite their worn looks, were scarcely more than ten years old.These
were the flesh and blood upon which Ames, the jungle-beast, waxed
gross!Upon their thin life-currents floated the magnificent
_Cossack_!Yes, she was right, evil can _not_ be
really known.There is no principle by which to explain the hideous
things of the human mind.And then she wondered what the Reverend
Darius Borwell did to earn that comfortable salary of ten thousand a
year in his rich New York church."It's quite a sight, ain't it, Miss?"He was a man of medium height,
young, and of Irish descent."It's a great sight," he continued, with a touch of brogue in his
tones.he cried, catching a passing workman's arm."He ain't worked to-day, Father," replied the man, stopping and
touching his cap.The young priest uttered an exclamation of displeasure.Then, as the
workman started away:

"You'll be at the Hall to-night, Fagin?The man addressed nodded and gave an affirmative grunt, then passed on
into the darkness."It's trying to reach a few of 'em I am," remarked the priest.When a man's stomach's empty he hasn't much respect
for morality.And I can't feed the lot of 'em!"Carmen gazed into the kindly blue eyes of the priest and wondered."No--but I am interested in my fellow-beings."I've some rooms, some on Main street,
which I call the Hall, and some down in the--well, the bad district,
which I call the Mission.They're reading rooms, places for men to meet,
and get acquainted, and rest, and talk.The Hall's for the fellows
who work, like this Fagin.The Mission's for the down-and-outs.""But--are your rooms only for--for men of your faith?""Race or
religion don't figure.It's to give help to every man that needs it.""And you are giving your life to help these people?""I want to see your Hall and Mission.Take me to them," she abruptly
demanded.He looked down at little Tony,
and then up at Carmen again."We will leave the boy at his door, and then go to
your Mission and Hall.Now tell me, you are a Roman Catholic priest?""Yes," he said mechanically, following her as she started away."How did you happen to get into this sort of work?""Oh, I've been at it these ten years!"he returned, now recovered from
his surprise, and pleased to talk about his work."I'd had some
experience in New York in the Bowery district.I came to the
conclusion that there were mighty few down-and-outs who couldn't be
set upon their pins again, given half a chance by any one sufficiently
interested.You see, Miss, I believe in my
fellow-men.Oh, it's only
temporary, I know.It ain't going to change the whole social system.But it helps a bit--and I like it."But," he continued more seriously, "there's going to be trouble here.And it's going to be a bad one."I've written him several times of late.But it's not
much I see he's doing, except to go on sucking the blood from these
poor devils down here!"They soon reached the tenement where Tony lived, and Carmen asked the
priest to go up with her."No," he said, "the good woman doesn't like priests.And my labors
don't reach the women anyway, except through the men.It was only by making many promises that Carmen could at last get away
from the little group on the fourth floor.But she slipped a bill into
Tony's hands as she went out, and then hurriedly crossed the hall and
opened the unlocked door of the widow Marcus's room.Carmen pinned a five-dollar bill upon the pillow and hastened
out."Now," said the priest, when the girl had joined him in the street
below, "it ain't right to take you to the Mission--"

"We'll go there first," the girl calmly announced.By the way, there's a telephone in your place?I want to call up
the health officer.I want to report the condition of these
tenements.""It won't do any good, Miss.I've camped on his
heels for months.If he
gets too troublesome to those higher up, why, he gets fired.He isn't here to report on conditions, but to
overlook 'em."You mean to say that nothing can be done in regard to those awful
buildings which Mr.Ames owns and rents to his mill hands?""It's criminal to let such buildings stand.Meanwhile, the priest was
studying his fair companion, and wondering who she might be.At length
he inquired if she had ever been in Avon before."Haven't seen Pillette's house then?He's resident manager of the Ames
mills.We can go a little out of our way and have a look at it."A few minutes later they stood at the iron gate of the manager's
residence, a massive, brown stone dwelling, set in among ancient trees
in an estate of several acres, and surrounded by shrubs and bushes."Does he know all about those tenements
down there?""Ah, that he does; and cares less.And he knows all about the terrible
hot air in his mills, and the flying lint that clogs the lungs of the
babies working there.He sees them leave the place, dripping with
perspiration, and go out into the zero temperature half naked.And
when they go off with pneumonia, well he knows why; and cares less.He
knows that the poor, tired workers in that great prison lose their
senses in the awful noise and roar, and sometimes get bewildered and
fall afoul of belts and cogs, and lose their limbs or lives.And he wouldn't put safety devices
over his machines, because he doesn't care.I've written to him a
dozen times about it.But--

"And then Pillette," he continued; "I've asked him to furnish his
hands with decent drinking water.They work ten and twelve hours in
that inferno, and when they want to drink, why, all they have is a
barrel of warm water, so covered with lint that it has to be pushed
aside in order to get at the water.Why, Pillette don't even give 'em
change rooms!He won't give 'em decent toilet rooms!Seems to me that when a man can give a ball and send
out invitations on cards of solid gold, he can afford to give a
thought to the thousands who have toiled and suffered in order to
enable him to give such a ball, don't you?"The memory came back now
in hot, searing thoughts."Oh, he catches 'em coming and going!""You see,
he manipulates Congress so that a high tariff law is passed,
protecting him from imported goods.Then he runs up the prices of his
output.That hits his mill hands, for they have to pay the higher
prices that the tariff causes.Oh, no, it doesn't result in increased
wages to them.He is
the only one who profits by high tariff on cotton goods.She might not know that Ames periodically appeared
before Congress and begged its protection--nay, threatened, and then
demanded.She might not know that Senator Gossitch ate meekly from the
great man's hand, and speciously represented to his dignified
colleagues that the benefits of high protective duties were for "the
people" of the United States.She might not know how Hood, employed to
evade the laws enacted to hedge and restrain his master, bribed and
bought, schemed and contrived, lobbied, traded, and manipulated, that
his owner might batten on his blood-stained profits, while he kept his
face turned away from the scenes of carnage, and his ears stopped
against the piteous cries of his driven slaves.But she did know how
needless it all was, and how easy, oh!how pitiably easy, it would be
to remedy every such condition, would the master but yield but a
modicum of his colossal, mesmeric selfishness.She did not know, she
could not, that the master, Ames, made a yearly profit from his mills
of more than two hundred per cent.But she did know that, were he less
stupidly greedy, even to the extent of taking but a hundred per cent
profit, he would turn a flood of sunshine into hundreds of sick,
despairing, dying souls."This is the place," she heard the priest say, his voice seeming to
come from a long distance.They were in front of an old,
two-story building, decrepit and forbidding, but well lighted.While
she gazed, the priest opened the door and bade her enter."This down here is the reading room," he explained.Upstairs is my office, and sleeping rooms for men.Also a
stock of old clothes I keep on hand for 'em when I send 'em out to
look for work.I've clothed an average of four men a day during the
past year, and sent 'em out to look for jobs.I board 'em, and keep
'em going until they land something.Sometimes I have to lend 'em
money.No, I never bother about a
man's religion.Carmen climbed the rough steps to the floor above and entered the
small but well-kept office of the priest."Now here," he said, with a touch of pride, "is my card-index.I keep
tab on all who come here.When they get straightened up and go out to
hunt work, I give 'em identification cards.Just as soon as I can get
funds I'm going to put a billiard table back there and fit up a little
chapel, so's the Catholic men who drift in here can attend service.You know, a lot of 'em don't have the nerve to go to a church.Carmen looked at the man in admiration."We haven't either of us asked the other's name," she said."I've been dying to know yours," he
replied."I'm Father Magee, Daniel Magee.Oh, give any name; it doesn't matter,
just so's I'll know how to address you."And I am from South America," said the girl
simply.*       *       *       *       *

An hour later the girl rose from her chair."I shall have to wait and
visit the Hall another time," she said."I must catch the eight-thirty
back to the city.But--"

"I'll never see you go down this tough street to the depot alone!"averred the priest, reaching for his hat.But she gratefully accepted the proffered escort.Two
of Father Magee's assistants had come in meanwhile, and were caring
for the few applicants below."You're right, Miss Carmen," the priest said, as they started for the
train.It eats my heart out to
see the suffering of these poor people!"At eleven o'clock that night Carmen entered the office of the city
editor of the Express."Ned," she said, "I've been with Dante--no,
Danny--in Inferno.I want expense
money--a good lot--so that I can leave to-morrow night."Haynerd's eyes dilated as he stared at the girl.But what did you find down in Avon?""I'll write you a detailed report of my trip to-morrow.I'm going home
now," she replied.CHAPTER 12


It is sometimes said of the man who toils at forge or loom in this
great commonwealth that he is fast forgetting that Washington is
something more significant to him than what is embraced in the
definition of the gazetteers.Not so, however, of that class of the
genus _homo_ individualized in J. Wilton Ames.He leaned not upon such
frail dependence as the _Congressional Record_ for tempered reports of
what goes on behind closed legislative doors; he went behind those
doors himself.He needed not to yield his meekly couched desires to
the law-builders whom his ballot helped select; he himself launched
those legislators, and gave them their steering charts.But, since the
interpretation of laws was to him vastly more important than their
framing, he first applied himself to the selection of judges, and
especially those of the federal courts.With these safely seated and
instructed at home, he gave himself comfortably to the task of holding
his legislators in Washington to the course he chose.Carmen had not spent a day at the Capital before the significance of
this fact to the common citizen swept over her like a tidal wave.If
the people, those upon whom the stability of the nation rests, looked
as carefully after appointments and elections as did Ames, would their
present wrongs continue long to endure?And after she
had spent the day with the Washington correspondent of the Express, a
Mr.Sands, who, with his young wife, had just removed to the Capital,
she knew more with respect to the mesmerism of human inertia and its
baneful effects upon mankind than she had known before.And yet, after that first day of wandering through the hallowed
precincts of a nation's legislative halls, she sat down upon a bench
in the shadow of the Capitol's great dome and asked herself the
questions: "What am I here for, anyway?And
instinct with her, as we have said, was unrestrained dependence upon
her own thought, the thought which entered her mentality only after
she had first prepared the way by the removal of every obstruction,
including self.At the breakfast table the second morning after her arrival in the
city, Mr.Sands handed her a copy of the Express.Among the editorials
was her full report upon conditions as she had found them in Avon,
published without her signature.Following it was the editor's
comment, merciless in its exposition of fact, and ruthless in its
exposure of the cruel greed externalized in the great cotton industry
in that little town.Carmen rose from the table indignant and protesting.Hitt had said he
would be wise in whatever use he made of her findings.But, though
quite devoid of malignity, this account and its added comment were
nothing less than a personal attack upon the master spinner, Ames.And
she had sent another report from Washington last night, one comprising
all she had learned from Mr.She
must get in touch with him at once.So she set out to find a telegraph
office, that she might check the impulsive publisher who was openly
hurling his challenge at the giant Philistine.When the message had gone, the girl dismissed the subject from her
thought, and gave herself up completely to the charm of the glorious
morning and her beautiful environment.For some time she wandered
aimlessly about the city; then bent her steps again toward the
Capitol.At the window of a florist she stopped and looked long and lovingly at
the gorgeous display within.In the midst of the beautiful profusion a
single flower held her attention.It was a great, brilliant red rose,
a kind that she had never seen before."We call it the 'President' rose, Miss," said the salesman in response
to her query.And when she went out with the splendid flower burning on her bosom
like living fire, she was glad that Hitt had not been there to see her
pay two dollars for it.The great Capitol seemed to fascinate her, as she stood before it a
few moments later.The mighty
sentiments and motives which had actuated the framers of the
Constitution seemed to loom before her like monuments of eternal
stone.Had statesmanship degenerated from that day of pure patriotism
into mere corruption?"Why, my dear girl,
the people of your great State are represented in the national Senate
by--whom?By the flies on the panes; by the mice in
the corners; by the god, perhaps, to whom the chaplain offers his
ineffectual prayers; but not by men.No; one of your Senators
represents a great railroad; the other an express company!Those Senators know no such ridiculous creature as 'the people'!"She turned from the Capitol, and for an hour or more strolled in the
brilliant sunlight."An economic disease," she murmured at length.And, like all disease, it is mental.It is a
disease of the human conscience.It comes from the fear of separation
from good.It all reduces to the belief of separation from God--the
belief that upon men's own human efforts depend all the happiness and
satisfaction they can have.Why, I have never known anything but
happiness and abundance!And yet, _I have never made a single effort
to acquire them_!"For the girl saw not the past vicissitudes of her
life except as shadowy mists, which dimmed not the sun of her joy.There was a tramping of horses' feet.It struck her, and brushed her to one side.She strove to hold
herself, but fell.The man and his companion were off their horses instantly, and
assisted the girl to her feet.asked the one who had been riding ahead."I called to
you, but you didn't seem to hear."laughed the girl, recovering her breath, and stooping to
brush the dust from her dress."Well, I'm glad to hear that!Perhaps you had better come in with
us."The girl raised her head and looked into his face with a bright smile.The man's anxious expression slowly changed into one of wonder, and
then of something quite different.The girl's long, thick hair had
been loosened by the fall, and was hanging about her shoulders.Framed
in the deep brown profusion was the fairest face he had ever looked
upon; the most winning smile; the most loving, compassionate glance."You'll have to come in now, and let the maid help you," he said
firmly."And I'll send you home in an auto."New York," replied Carmen, a little confused as she struggled vainly
with her hair."Oh, I'm not going to fuss with it any more!""Yes, I'll go with you, and let the maid do it up.She glanced about her, and then up the avenue toward which the men had
been riding.A flush suddenly spread over her face, and she turned and
looked searchingly at the man."You--you--live--in--there?"she stammered, pointing toward the
distant house."And you are--"

"Yes," he replied, coming to her assistance, but evidently greatly
enjoying her embarrassment, "I am the President."Then her hand stole mechanically to the rose flaming upon her bosom."I--I guess I know why I bought this now," she said softly.Quickly
unpinning it, she extended it to the man."I was bringing it to you,
wasn't I?"The picture was one that would have rejoiced an artist: the simple
girl, with her tumbled hair and wonderful face, standing there in the
glorious sunlight, holding out a single rose to the chief executive of
a great nation.The President bowed low and took the proffered flower.But the one who gives it is far more so."Then he bade his companion take the two horses to the stable, and
motioned to Carmen to accompany him."I was just returning from my morning ride," he began again, "when you
happened--"

"Things _never_ happen," interrupted the girl gently.He looked at her with a little quizzical side glance."Then you didn't
happen to be in the way?""I was obeying the law of cause and
effect.""A desire to see you, I guess.Or, perhaps, the _necessity_ of seeing
you.And because I wanted to see you in the interests of good, why,
evil seemed to try to run over me.""But why should you wish to see me?""Because you are the head of a wonderful nation.Then:

"You came down from New York to talk with me?""I think I came all the way from South America to see you," she said.There is a revolution in progress down there now.Did you
come to see me about that?I can do nothing--"

The girl shook her head."No," she said, "it's to prevent a revolution
here in your own country that I think I have come to see you."They had by now reached the door of the Executive Mansion.Entering,
the President summoned a maid, and turned the big-eyed girl over to
her."Bring her to my office," he directed, "when she is ready."A little later the nameless girl from Simiti again stood before the
President of the United States."I have an important conference at ten," he said, glancing at a clock."But we have a few minutes before that time.Will you--may I ask you
to tell me something about yourself?"he added, looking
apprehensively at her while he set out a chair.The girl drew the chair close to his desk and sat down."I know
nothing about accidents," she said quietly.Then, turning quite from
that topic, she drew the President quickly into her thought and
carried him off with her as on a magic carpet.From time to time he turned and
stared at his strange visitor.At other times he made notes of points
which impressed him.Once he interrupted, when she made reference to
her past life."This priest, Jose de Rincon, might he not have been
imprisoned as a political offender?""I do not know," the girl replied tenderly."My foster-father,
Rosendo, did not mention him in the two letters which I have
received."The President nodded; and the girl went rapidly on.Soon she was deep
in the problem presented by Avon.But at the mention of that town, and of its dominating genius, the
President seemed to become nervous.At length he raised a hand, as if
to end the interview."I fear I can do nothing at present," he said with an air of
helplessness."But," she protested, "you have the public welfare at heart.And can
you not see that public welfare is the welfare of each individual?"Ames well," the President replied, somewhat irrelevantly."He, like all men of great wealth, presents a serious problem,
doubtless.But he himself, likewise, is confronted by problems of very
trying natures.We must give him time to work them out.""It's like getting at the essence of Christianity,"
she said."The world has had nearly two thousand years in which to do
that, but it hasn't made much of a start as yet."But," the President resumed reflectively, "after all, it is the
people who are wholly responsible for the conditions which exist among
them.They have the means of remedying every economic situation, the
ballot.It is really all in their hands, is it not?They elect their
public officers, their judges, and their lawmakers.""You too," she said, "take refuge in the cant
of the age.Yes, the people do try to elect public servants; but by
some strange anomaly the servant becomes master the moment he enters
the door of office.And then
they, and you, sit helplessly back and cry, No use!And if the people
rise, their servants meet them with a hail of lead.It's really
childishly ridiculous, isn't it?when you stop to consider it
seriously."She leaned her elbows upon the desk, and sat with chin in her hands,
looking squarely into the eyes of the President."So you, the head of this great nation, confess to utter helplessness,"
she slowly said.A servant entered at that moment with a card.The President glanced at
it, and bade him request the caller to wait a few moments.Then, after
some reflection:

"The people will always--"

The door through which the servant had passed was abruptly thrown
open, and a harsh voice preceded the entrance of a huge bulk."I am not accustomed to being told to wait, Mr.President," said the
ungracious voice."My appointment was for ten o'clock, and I am here
to keep it."Then the newcomer stopped abruptly, and stared in amazement at the
young girl, sitting with her elbows propped upon the desk, and her
face close to that of the President.His
attention was centered upon the girl who sat looking calmly up at him.A dark, menacing scowl drew his bushy eyebrows together, and made the
sinister look which mantled his face one of ominous import to the
person upon whom it fell.Carmen was the first to break the tense silence.With a bright smile
illuming her face she rose and held out a hand to the giant before
her."We meet pretty often, don't
we?"Ames ignored both the greeting and the extended hand.Turning upon the
President, he said sharply: "So, the Express seeks aid in the White
House, eh?"Ames," said Carmen quickly, answering for the President."It
seeks to aid the White House.""Might I ask," he said in a tone of mordant
sarcasm, "how you learned that I was to be here this morning?I would
like to employ your methods of espionage in my own business.""I would give anything if you _would_ employ my methods in your
business," returned the girl gently.The President looked in embarrassment from one to the other."I think,
Miss Carmen," he said, "that we must consider our interview ended.A peculiar expression had come into Ames's features.President," he said in a tone pregnant with
meaning."I am glad to have a representative of the New York press
with us to hear you express your attitude toward the cotton
schedule."His
indignation mounted, but he checked it."The schedule has been reported out of committee," he replied briefly."I am aware of that," said Ames."And your influence with Congress in
regard to it?""Shall the Avon mills be closed pending a decision?Or, on the
assumption that Congress will uphold the altered schedule, must the
Spinners' Association begin immediate retrenchment?As president of
that Association, I ask for instructions.""My influence with Congress, as you well know, Mr.Ames, is quite
limited," replied the hectored executive."It is not a question of the _amount_ of your influence with that
body, Mr.President," returned Ames coldly, "but of how you will
employ that which you have."Silence lay upon them all for some moments.Then Ames resumed:

"I would remind you," he remarked with cruel insinuation, "that--or,"
glancing at the girl, "perhaps I should not make this public."He
paused and awaited the effect of his significant words upon the
President.Then, as the latter remained silent, he went on evenly:

"Second-term prospects, you are aware, are often very greatly
influenced by public facts regarding the first election.Of course we
are saying nothing that the press might use, but--well, you must
realize that there is some suspicion current as to the exact manner in
which your election was--"

"I think you wish to insinuate that my election was due to the
Catholic vote, which you controlled in New York, and to your very
generous campaign contributions, do you not?I see no reason for
withholding from the press your views on the subject.""But, my friend, this is an age of investigation, and of suspicion
toward all public officials.And such rumors wouldn't look well on the
front pages of the press throughout the country.Of course, our young
friend here isn't going to mention them to her superiors; but,
nevertheless, they ought to be suppressed at once.Their effect upon
your second-term prospects would be simply annihilating.Now I am in a
position to greatly assist in the matter of--well, in fact, I have
already once offered my aid to the Express.And I stand ready now to
join with it in giving the lie to those who are seeking to embarrass
the present administration.Miss Carmen is with us--"

"Mr.Ames," the girl quietly interrupted, "I wish _you_ were with
_us_.""But, my dear girl, have I--"

"For then there would be no more suffering in Avon," she added.Then it was you who wrote that misleading stuff in the Express,
eh?May I ask," he added with a contemptuous
sneer, "by whose authority you have visited the houses occupied by my
tenants, without my permission or knowledge?I take it you were down
there, although the cloudy weather must have quite dimmed your
perception.""Yes," she answered in a low voice, "I have been there.Yes, I visited your charnel houses and your cemeteries.I held their trembling hands, and stroked their
hot brows.I fed them, and gave them the promise that I would plead
their cause with you."But you first come here to--"

"It was with no thought of seeing you that I came to Washington, Mr.If I cross your path often, it must be for a purpose not yet
revealed to either of us.Perhaps it is to warn you, to awaken you, if
not too late, to a sense of your desperate state."You are drunk, you know, drunk with greed.And such continuous
drunkenness has made you sick unto death.It is the same dread disease
of the soul that the wicked Cortez told the bewildered Mexicans he
had, and that could be cured only with gold.Ames, that you are mesmerized by the evil which is always using you."She stood close to the huge man, and looked straight up into his face.He remained for a moment motionless, yielding again to that
fascination which always held him when in her presence, and of which
he could give no account to himself.That slight, girlish figure--how
easily he could crush her!"But you couldn't, you know," she said cryptically, as she shook her
head.He recoiled a step, struck by the sudden revelation that the girl had
read his thought.Ames," she continued, "what a craven error is before
truth.It makes a coward of you, doesn't it?Your boasted power is
only a mesmerism, which you throw like a huge net over your victims.You and they can break it, if you will.""We really must consider our
interview ended."I guess the appointment was made for to-day," the girl said softly."And by a higher power than any of us.Ames is the type of man who
is slowly turning our Republican form of government into a despotism
of wealth.He boasts that his power is already greater than a czar's.You bow before it; and so the awful monster of privilege goes on
unhampered, coiling its slimy tentacles about our national resources,
our public utilities, and natural wealth.I--I can't see how you, the
head of this great nation, can stand trembling by and see him do it.He made as if to reply, but restrained himself.A stern look then came into the
President's face.Then he
turned again to his desk and sat down."Please be seated," he said, "both of you.I don't know what quarrel
there is between you two, and I am not interested in it.But you, Miss
Carmen, represent the press; Mr.The things which have
been voiced here this morning must remain with us alone.Now let us
see if we can not meet on common ground.Is the attitude of your
newspaper, Miss Carmen, one of hostility toward great wealth?""The Express raises its voice only against the folly and wickedness of
the human mind, not against personality," replied the girl.We attack only the human thought which manifests in him.We
oppose the carnal thought which expresses itself in the folly, the
madness of strife for excessive wealth.It is that strife that makes
our hospitals and asylums a disgraceful necessity.It makes the
immigrant hordes of Europe flock here because they are attracted by
the horrible social system which fosters the growth of great fortunes
and makes their acquisition possible.Our alms-houses and prisons
increase in number every year.It is because rich men misuse their
wealth, trample justice under foot, and prostitute a whole nation's
conscience."They do not all--"

"It is a law of human thought," said Carmen in reply, "that mankind in
time become like that which has absorbed their attention.Rich men
obey this law with utmost precision.They acquire the nature and
character of their god, gold.They rapidly grow to be like that which
they blindly worship.They grow
metallic, yellow, calloused, unchanging, and soulless, like the coins
they heap up.There is the great danger to our country, Mr.And it is against the human thought that produces such beings--thought
stamped with the dollar mark--that the Express opposes itself."She hesitated, and looked in the direction of Ames.Then she added:

"Their features in time reveal to the world their metallic thought.Their veins shrivel with the fiery lust of gold.And then, at last, they crumble and sink into the dust of
which their god is made.And still their memories continue to poison
the very sources of our national existence.You see," she concluded,
"there is no fool so mired in his folly as the man who gives his soul
for great wealth.""A very enjoyable little sermon, preached for my benefit, Miss
Carmen," interposed Ames, bowing to her."And now if you have finished
excoriating my poor character," he continued dryly, "will you kindly
state by whose authority you publish to the world my affairs?"The maudlin sentimentalism of such as you make us all suffer!""Hadn't we better sing a hymn
now?You'll be wiser in a few years, I hope."Ames, by what right you own
mines, and forests, and lands?"By the divine right of law, most assuredly," he retorted.I have learned," she
continued, turning to the President, "that a bare handful of men own
or control all the public utilities of this great country.But," abruptly, "you believe in God, don't you?"He nodded his head, although with some embarrassment.His religion
labored heavily under political bias.She looked down at the floor, and sat silent for a while."Divine
right," she began to murmur, "the fetish of the creatures made rich by
our man-made social system!'The heavens are thine, the earth also is
thine: as for the world and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded
them.'But, oh, what must be the concept of God held by the rich, a
God who bestows these gifts upon a few, and with them the privilege
and divine consent to oppress and crush their fellow-men!What a low
order of intelligence the rich possess!An intelligence wherein the
sentiments of love and justice have melted into money!"President," put in Ames at this juncture, "I think we have spent
quite enough time moralizing.Suppose you now indicate your attitude
on the cotton tariff.Her sparkling eyes looked right into the
President's."I admire the man," she said,
"who dares to stand for the right in the face of the great taboo!There are few men nowadays who stand for anything in particular."exclaimed Ames, aware now that he had made a mistake in
permitting the girl to remain, "I wish my interview to be with you
alone, Mr."I have embarrassed you both, haven't I?"But first--"

She went to Ames and laid a hand on his arm."I wish--I wish I might
awaken you," she said gently."There is no victim at Avon in so
desperate a state as you.More gold will not cure you, any more than
more liquor can cure a slave to strong drink.You do not know that you
are hourly practicing the most despicable form of robbery, the
wringing of profits which you do not need out of the dire necessities
of your fellow-beings."She stopped and smiled down into the face of the man.This girl always dissected his soul with a smile on
her face."I wish I might awaken you and your poor victims by showing you and
them that righteousness makes not for a home in the skies, but for
greater happiness and prosperity for everybody right here in this
world.Don't you really want the little babies to have enough to eat
down there at Avon?Do you really want the President to support you in
the matter of the cotton schedule, and so increase the misery and
sorrow at your mills?that one's greatest
happiness is found only in that of others."She stood looking at him
for a few moments, then turned away.The President rose and held out his hand to her.She almost laughed as
she took it, and her eyes shone with the light of her eager, unselfish
desire."I--I guess I'm like Paul," she said, "consumed with zeal.Anyway,
you'll wear my rose, won't you?""And--you are not a bit afraid about a second term, are you?As for
party principle, why, you know, there is only _one_ principle, God.He
is the Christ-principle, you know, and that is way above party
principle."Under the spell of the girl's strange words every emotion fled from
the men but that of amazement."Righteousness, you know, is right-thinking.And that touches just
that about which men are most chary, their pocketbooks."Then she arched her brows and said naively:
"You will find in yesterday's Express something about Avon.You will
not use your influence with Congress until you have read it, will
you?"A deep quiet fell upon the men, upon the great executive and the great
apostle of privilege.It seemed to the one that as the door closed
against that bright presence the spirit of night descended; the other
sat wrapped in the chaos of conflicting emotions in which she always
left him."She's the bastard daughter of a <DW64> priest," replied Ames in an
ugly tone.cried the thoroughly angered Ames, bringing a huge
fist down hard upon the desk.And, what's
more, she's head over heels in love with another renegade priest!"But that's neither here nor there," he continued savagely."I want to
know what you are going to do for us?""I--I do not see, Mr.Ames, that I can do anything," replied the
President meditatively."Well--will you leave the details to us, and do as we tell you then?"the financier pursued, taking another tack."Yes--about the girl, you--"

"Damn the girl!""I've got proofs that will ruin
her, and you too--and, by God, I'll use 'em, if you drive me to it!You seem to forget that you were elected to do our bidding, my
friend!"For a long time he sat
staring at the floor."It was wonderful," he said,
"wonderful the way she faced you, like David before Goliath!There
isn't a vestige of fear in her make-up.I--we'll talk this matter over
some other time, Mr.roared Ames, his self-control flying to the
winds."I can ruin you--make your administration a laughing-stock--and
plunge this country into financial panic!Do you do as I say, or
not?"The President looked the angry man squarely in the eyes."I do not,"
he answered quietly.CHAPTER 13


"It's corking!cried Haynerd, when he and Hitt had
finished reading Carmen's report on her first few days in Washington."Makes a fellow feel as if the best thing Congress could do would be
to adjourn for about fifty years, eh?But
she's a wonder, Hitt!And she's booming the Express to the skies!That's why she is so--as the
Mexicans say--_simpatico_.""Well, not with you, I hope!""No, unfortunately," replied Haynerd, assuming a dejected mien, "but
with that Rincon fellow--and he a priest!He's got a son down in
Cartagena somewhere, and he doesn't write to her either.She's told
Sid the whole story, and he's working it up into a book during his odd
moments.But, say," turning the conversation again into its original
channel, "how much of her report are we going to run?You know, she
tried to head us off.As if she
hadn't already attacked him and strewn him all over the field!""We'll have to be careful in our allusions to the President," replied
Hitt."I'll rewrite it myself, so as not to offend her or him.her reports are the truth, and they rightfully
belong to the people!The Express is the avowed servant of the
public!I see no reason for
concealing a thing.Did I tell you that I had two inquiries from
Italian and German papers, asking permission to translate her reports
into their own columns?"Did you wire her to see
Gossitch and Mall?""Yes, and Logue, as well as others.And I've put dozens of senators
and congressmen on our mailing list, including the President himself.I've prepared letters for each one of them, calling attention to the
girl and her unique reports.She certainly writes in a fascinating
vein, doesn't she?Meanwhile, she's circulating around down there and
advertising us in the best possible manner.he finished, slapping the city editor roundly upon the back."Confine your enthusiasm to words, my
friend.Say, what did you do about that liquid food advertisement?""Discovered that it was beer," replied Hitt, "and turned it firmly
down."Not that we care to advertise it, but--"

Hitt laughed."When that fellow Claus smoothly tried to convince me
that beer was a food, I sent a sample of his stuff to the Iles
chemical laboratory for analysis.They reported ninety-four per cent
water, four per cent alcohol--defined now as a poisonous drug--and
about two per cent of possible food substance.If the beer had been of
the first grade there wouldn't have been even the two per cent of
solids.You know, I couldn't help thinking of what Carmen said about
the beer that is advertised in brown bottles to preserve it from the
deleterious effects of light.Light, you know, starts decay in beer.Well, light, according to Fuller, is 'God's eldest daughter.'Emerson
says it is the first of painters, and that there is nothing so foul
that intense light will not make it beautiful.Thus the light of truth destroys the fermentation which
is supposed to constitute the human mind and body.So light tries to
purify beer by breaking it up.The brewers have to put it into brown
bottles to preserve its poisonous qualities.As Carmen says, beer
simply can't stand the light.It's astonishing that so many so-called reputable papers will
take their advertising stuff.It's just as bad as patent medicine
ads."And I note that the American public still spend their annual
hundred million dollars for patent medicine dope.Most of this is
spent by women, who are largely caught by the mail-order trade.I
learned of one exposure recently made where it was found that a widely
advertised eye wash was composed of borax and water.The cost was
somewhere about five cents a gallon, and it sold for a dollar an
ounce.Nice little profit of some two hundred and fifty thousand per
cent, and all done by the mesmerism of suggestive advertising.Speaking of parasites on
society, Ames is not the only one!""And yet those fellows howl and threaten us with the boycott because
we won't advertise their lies and delusions.It's as bad as
ecclesiastical intolerance!"Then she returned to New York and
went directly to Avon.What she did there can only be surmised by a
study of her reports to Hitt, who carefully edited them and ran them
in the Express.Again, after several days, she journeyed back to
Washington.Her enthusiasm was boundless; her energy exhaustless; her
industry ceaseless; and her persistency doggedly unshakable.In
Washington she made her way unhindered among those whom she deemed
essential to the work which she was doing.Doubtless her ability to do
this and to gain an audience with whomsoever she might choose was in
great part due to her beauty and charming simplicity, her grace of
manner, and her wonderful and fearless innocence, combined with a
mentality remarkable for its matured powers.Hitt and Haynerd groaned
over her expenses, but promptly met them."She's worth it," growled the latter one day."She's had four
different talks with the President!How on earth do you suppose she
does it?And how did she get Mall and Logue to take her to dinner and
to the theater again and again?And what did she do to induce that
doddering old blunderbuss, Gossitch, to tell her what Ames was up to?How do you suppose she found out that
Ames was hand in glove with the medical profession, and working tooth
and nail to help them secure a National Bureau of Health?Say, do you
know what that would do?It would foist allopathy upon every chick and
child of us!Have
we come to that in this supposedly free country?By the way, Hitt,
Doctor Morton has been let out of the University.He says Ames
did it because of his association with us."I think, my friend," replied Hitt, "that it is a very serious matter,
and one that impinges heavily upon the rights of every one of us, when
a roaring lion like Ames is permitted to run loose through our
streets."I've centered my hopes in Carmen," sighed Haynerd.If she can't stop him, then God himself can't!"A few moments later he came out
again and handed an opened letter to Haynerd."Some notes she's sent
from Washington.Mentions the National Bureau of Health project.It
hasn't escaped her, you see.Say, will you tell me where she picks up
her information?""The Lord gives it to her, I guess," said Haynerd, glancing over the
letter."'Reverend Borwell and Doctor Siler are down here lobbying for the
  National Bureau of Health bill.Also, Senator Gossitch dropped a
  remark to me yesterday which makes me believe that he and other
  Senators have been approached by Tetham with reference to sending
  an American ambassador to the Vatican.Haynerd handed the letter back to Hitt and plunged into the papers on
his desk."This
country's going stark, staring mad!We're crazy, every mother's son of
us!""It's the human mind that is crazy, Ned, because it is wholly without
any basis of principle," returned Hitt with a sigh.*       *       *       *       *

"Doctor Siler!exclaimed that worthy person, looking up from
the gutter, whither he had hastened after his silk hat which had been
knocked off by the encounter with the young girl who had rounded the
corner of Ninth street into Pennsylvania avenue and plunged full into
him."Oh, I'm so sorry, Doctor!I was coming from the Smithsonian
Institution, and I guess--"

"Don't mention it, Miss Carmen.It's a privilege to have my hat
knocked off by such a radiant creature as you."And I want to offer
my--"

"Look here, Miss Carmen, just offer yourself as my guest at luncheon,
will you?That will not only make amends, but place me hopelessly in
your debt.""I was on my way to a
restaurant."I've got a little place around the corner here
that would have made Epicurus sit up nights inditing odes to it."The girl laughed merrily, and slipped her arm through his.A few
minutes later they were seated at a little table in a secluded corner
of the doctor's favorite chophouse."By the way, I met a friend of yours a few minutes ago," announced the
doctor, after they had given their orders."He was coming out of the
White House, and--were you ever in a miniature cyclone?That's twice to-day I've been sent to the gutter!"He laughed heartily
over his experiences, then added significantly: "You and he are both
mental cyclones, but producing diametrically opposite effects."The doctor went on chatting
volubly."Ames and the President don't seem to be pulling together
as well as usual.The President has come out squarely against him
now in the matter of the cotton schedule.Ames declares that the
result will be a general financial panic this fall.Sands, the Express correspondent, seems to be getting mighty close
to administration affairs these days.Where did he get that data
regarding a prospective National Bureau of Health, do you suppose?""I gave it to him," was the simple reply.The doctor dropped his fork, and stared at the girl."Well--of course you naturally would be opposed to it.But--"

"Tell me," she interrupted, "tell me candidly just what you doctors
are striving for, anyway.Are your activities
all quite utilitarian, or--is it money and monopoly that you are
after?It makes a lot of difference, you know, in one's attitude
toward you.If you really seek the betterment of health, then you are
only honestly mistaken in your zeal.But if you are doing this to make
money--and I think you are--then you are a lot of rascals, deserving
defeat.""Miss Carmen, do you impugn my motives?"He began to color slightly under her keen
scrutiny."Well," she finally continued, "let's see.If you doctors
have made the curative arts effective, and if you really do heal
disease, then I must support you, of course.But, while there is
nothing quite so important to the average mortal as his health, yet I
know that there is hardly anything that has been dealt with in such a
bungling way.The art of healing as employed by our various schools of
medicine to-day is the result of ages and ages of experimentation and
bitter experience, isn't it?And its cost in human lives is simply
incalculable.No science is so speculative, none so hypothetical, as
the so-called science of medicine.""But we have had to learn," protested the doctor."Do you realize, Doctor," she resumed, "that the teaching and
preaching of disease for money is one of the greatest curses resting
upon the world to-day?I never saw a doctor until I was on the boat
coming to New York.And then I thought he was one of the greatest
curiosities I had ever seen.I followed him about and listened to him
talk to the passengers.And I learned that, like most of our young
men, he had entered the practice of medicine under the pressure of
dollars rather than altruism.Money is still the determining factor in
the choice of a profession by our young men.And success and fortune
in the medical profession, more than in any other, depend upon the
credulity of the ignorant and helpless human mind.""Do you deny that great progress has been made in the curative arts?""See what we have done with diphtheria, with typhoid,
with smallpox, and malaria!""Surely, Doctor, you can not believe that the mere temporary removing
of a disease is _real_ healing!You render one lot of microbes
innocuous, after thousands of years of experimentation, and leave
mankind subject to the rest.Do
you expect to go on that way, making set after set of microbes
harmless to the human body, and thus in time, after millions of years,
eradicate disease entirely?Do you think that people will then cease
to die?All the time you are working only in matter and through
material modes.Do you expect thereby to render the human sense of
life immortal?Your patients
get well, only to fall sick again.And death to you is still as
inevitable as ever, despite your boasted successes, is it not so?"He broke into a bantering laugh, but did not reply."Doctor, the human mind is self-inoculated.It will keep on
making them, until it is educated out of itself, and taught to do
better.Then it will give place to the real reflection of divine mind;
and human beings will be no more.Why don't you realize this, you
doctors, and get started on the right track?Your real work is in the
_mental_ realm."Well, I for one have little respect for faith cure--"

"Nor I," she interposed."Dependence upon material drugs, Doctor, is
reliance upon the _phenomena_ of the human mind.Faith cure is
dependence upon the human mind itself, upon the _noumenon_, instead of
the _phenomenon_.Hypnotism is mental
suggestion, the suggestions being human and material, not divine
truth.The drugging system is an outgrowth of the belief of life in
matter.Faith cure is the belief of life and power inherent in the
human mind.The origin of healing is
shrouded in mythology, and every step of its so-called progress has
been marked by superstition, dense ignorance, and fear.The first
doctor that history records was the Shaman, or medicine-man, whose
remedies reflected his mental status, and later found apt illustration
in the brew concocted by Macbeth's witches.And think you he has
disappeared?Unbelievable as it may seem, it was only a short time ago
that a case was reported from New York where the skin of a freshly
killed black cat was applied as a remedy for an ailment that had
refused to yield to the prescribed drugging!And only a few years ago
some one applied to the Liverpool museum for permission to touch a
sick child's head with one of the prehistoric stone axes there
exhibited.""That was mere superstition," retorted the doctor."But _materia medica_ is superstition incarnate.And because of the superstition that life and virtue and power are
resident in matter, mankind have swallowed nearly everything known to
material sense, in the hope that it would cure them of their own
auto-infection.You remember what awful recipes Luther gave for
disease, and his exclamation of gratitude: 'How great is the mercy of
God who has put such healing virtue in all manner of muck!'""Miss Carmen," resumed the doctor, "we physicians are workers, not
theorists.We handle conditions as we find them, not as they ought to
be.""You handle conditions as the
human, mortal mind believes them to be, that's all.You accept its
ugly pictures as real, and then you try desperately through
legislation to make us all accept them.Yet you would bitterly resent
it if some religious body should try to legislate its beliefs upon
you."Now listen, you doctors are rank materialists.Perhaps it is because,
as Hawthorne puts it, in your researches into the human frame your
higher and more subtle faculties are materialized, and you lose the
spiritual view of existence.Your only remedy for diseased matter is
more matter.Why, ignorance and
superstition have given rise to by far the larger number of remedies
in use by you to-day!And all of your attempts to rationalize medicine
and place it upon a systematic basis have signally failed, because the
only curative property a drug has is the credulity of the person who
swallows it.And that is a factor which varies with the individual.""The most advanced physicians give little medicine nowadays, Miss
Carmen.""They are beginning to get away from it, little by little," she
replied."In recent years it has begun to dawn upon doctors and
patients alike that the sick who recover do so, not because of the
drugs which they have taken, but _in spite of them_!One of the most
prominent of our contemporary physicians who are getting away from the
use of drugs has said that eighty-five per cent of all illnesses get
well of their own accord, no matter what may or may not be done for
them.In a very remarkable article from this same doctor's pen, in
which he speaks of the huge undertaking which physicians must assume
in order to clear away the _materia medica_ rubbish of the ages, he
states that the greatest struggle which the coming doctor has on his
hands is with drugs, and the deadly grip which they have on the
confidence and affections both of the profession and of the public.Among his illuminating remarks about the drug system, I found two
drastic statements, which should serve to lift the veil from the eyes
of the chronic drug taker.These are, first, 'Take away opium and
alcohol, and the backbone of the patent medicine business would be
broken inside of forty-eight hours,' and, second, 'No drug, save
quinine and mercury in special cases, will cure a disease.'In words
which he quotes from another prominent physician, 'He is the best
doctor who knows the worthlessness of most drugs.'"The hundreds of drugs listed in books on _materia medica_ I find are
gradually being reduced in number to a possible forty or fifty, and
one doctor makes the radical statement that they can be cut down to
the'six or seven real drugs.'Still further light has been thrown
upon the debasing nature of the drugging system by a member of the
Philadelphia Drug Exchange, in a recent hearing before the House
Committee on municipal affairs right here.He is reported as saying
that it makes little difference what a manufacturer puts into a patent
medicine, for, after all, the effect of the medicine depends upon the
faith of the user.The sick man who turns to patent medicines for
relief becomes the victim of 'bottled faith.'If his faith is
sufficiently great, a cure may be effected--and the treatment has been
_wholly mental_!The question of ethics does not concern either the
patent medicine manufacturer or the druggist, for they argue that if
the sick man's faith has been aroused to the point of producing a
cure, the formula of the medicine itself is of no consequence, and,
therefore, if a solution of sugar and water sold as a cure for colds
can stimulate the sufferer's faith to the point of meeting his need,
the business is quite legitimate.'A bunch of bottles and sentiment,'
adds this member of the Drug Exchange, 'are the real essentials for
working healing miracles.'"exclaimed the doctor, again sitting back and regarding her with
amazement."But, Doctor, I am intensely interested in my fellow-men.I want to
help them, and show them how to learn to live.""And I am doing all I can, the very best I
know how to do.""I guess you mean you are doing what you are prompted to do by every
vagrant impulse that happens to stray into your mentality, aren't
you?""You haven't really seriously thought out your
way, else you would not be here now urging Congress to spread a
blanket of ignorance over the human mind.If you will reflect
seriously, if you will lay aside monetary considerations, and a little
of the hoary prejudice of the ages, and will carefully investigate our
present medical systems, you will find a large number of schools of
medicine, bitterly antagonistic to one another, and each accusing the
other of inferiority as an exact science, and as grossly ignorant and
reprehensibly careless of life.But which of these warring schools can
show the greatest number of cures is a bit of data that has never been
ascertained.A recent writer says: 'As important as we all realize
health to be, the public is receiving treatment that is anything but
scientific, and the amount of unnecessary suffering that is going on
in the world is certainly enough to make a rock shed tears.'He
further says that, 'at least seventy-five per cent of the people we
meet who are apparently well, are suffering from some chronic ailment
that regular medical systems can not cure,' and that many of these
would try further experimentation were it not for the criticism that
is going on in the medical world regarding various curative systems.The only hope under the drugging system is that the patient's life and
purse may hold out under the strain of trying everything until he can
light upon the right thing before he reaches the end of the list.""And do you include surgery in your general criticism?""Surgery is no less an outgrowth of the belief of sentient matter than
is the drugging system," she replied."It is admittedly necessary in
the present stage of the world's thought; but it is likewise admitted
to be 'the very uncertain art of performing operations,' at least
ninety per cent of which are wholly unnecessary."You see," she went on, "the effect upon the _moral_ nature of the
sick man is never considered as rightfully having any influence upon
the choice of the system to be employed.If Beelzebub can cast out
demons, why not employ him?For, after all, the end to be attained is
the ejection of the demon.And if God had not intended minerals and
plants to be used as both food and medicine, why did He make them?Besides, man must earn his bread in some way under our present crude
and inhuman social system, and if the demand for drugs exists we may
be very sure it will be supplied by others, if not by ourselves.Again, the influence of commercialism as a determining factor in the
choice of a profession, is an influence that works to keep many in the
practice of a profession that they know to be both unscientific and
harmful.The result is an inevitable lowering of ideals to the lust of
material accumulation.""You certainly are hard on us poor doctors!And
we have done so much for you, too, despite your accusations.Think of
the babies that are now saved from diphtheria alone!""And think of the children who are the victims of the medical mania!""Think how they are brought up under the tyranny of
fear!Fear of this and of that; fear that if they scratch a finger
blood poisoning will deprive them of life; fear that eating a bit of
this will cause death; or sitting in a breeze will result in wasting
sickness!As for diphtheria antitoxin, it is in the
same class as the white of an egg.It is the
result of human belief, the belief that a horse that has recovered
from diphtheria can never again be poisoned by the microbe of that
disease.The microbe, Doctor, is the externalization in the human
mentality of the mortal beliefs of fear, of life and power in matter,
and of disease and death.The microbe will be subject, therefore, to
the human mind's changing thought regarding it, always.""Well then," said the doctor, "if people are spiritual, and if they
really are a consciousness, as you say, why do we seem to be carrying
about a body with us all the time--a body from which we are utterly
unable to get away?""It is because the mortal mind and body are one, Doctor.The body is
a lower stratum of the human mind.Hence, the so-called mind is
never distinct from its body to the extent of complete separation,
but always has its substratum with it.And, Doctor, the mind can not
hold a single thought without that thought tending to become
externalized--as Professor James tells us--and the externalization
generally has to do with the body, for the mind has come to center
all its hopes of happiness and pleasure in the body, and to base its
sense of life upon it.The body, being a mental concept formed of
false thought, passes away, from sheer lack of a definite principle
upon which to rest.Therefore the sense of life embodied in it passes
away with it.You know, the ancients had some idea of the cause of
disease when they attributed it to demons, for demons at least are
mental influences.But then, after that, men began to believe that
disease was sent by God, either to punish them for their evil deeds,
or to discipline and train them for paradise.Think
of regarding pain and suffering as divine agents!I don't wonder
people die, do you?Humboldt, you know, said: 'The time will come
when it will be considered a disgrace for a man to be sick, when the
world will look upon it as a misdemeanor, the result of some
vicious thinking.'Many people seem to think that thought affects
only the brain; but the fact is that _we think all over_!""But look here," put in the doctor."Here's a question I intended to
ask Hitt the other night.He said the five physical senses did not
testify truly.Well now, if, as you say, the eyes do not testify to
disease, then they can't testify to cures either, eh?"He sat back
with an air of triumph."The physical senses testify only to
belief.In the case of sickness, they testify to false belief.In the
case of a cure, they testify to a changed belief, to a belief of
recovered health, that is all.It is all on the basis of human belief,
you see."But--nerves feel--"

"Nerves, Doctor, like all matter, are externalizations of human
thought.Can the externalization of thought talk back to thought?You are still on the basis of mere human belief."At that moment the doctor leaned over and tapped upon the window to
attract the attention of some one in the street.Carmen looked out and
caught sight of a tall, angular man dressed in clerical garb.The man
bowed pleasantly to the doctor, and cast an inquiring glance at the
girl, then passed on."Yes, Tetham," said the doctor."Oh, is that the man who maintains the lobby here at the Capital for
his Church?He--well, it is his business to see
that members of his Church are promoted to political office, isn't it?He trades votes of whole districts to various congressmen in return
for offices for strong church members.He also got the parochial
schools of New York exempt from compulsory vaccination.The
Express--"

"Eh?Wales in his work on the cotton schedule.And so
we heard from Father Tetham.He is supporting the National Bureau of
Health bill.He is working for the Laetare medal.He--"

"Say, Miss Carmen, will you tell me where you pick up your news?Do you know something about everybody here in
Washington?""I have learned much here," she said, "about popular
government as exemplified by these United States.But it is especially saddening to see our
constitutional liberties threatened by this Bureau of Health bill, and
by the Government's constant truckling to the Church of Rome.Doctor,
can it be that you want to commit this nation to the business of
practicing medicine, and to its practice according to the allopathic,
or'regular' school?The American Medical Association, with its
reactionary policies and repressive tendencies, is making strenuous
endeavors to influence Congress to enact certain measures which would
result in the creation of such a Department of Health, the effect of
which would be to monopolize the art of healing and to create a
'healing trust.'If this calamity should be permitted to come upon the
American people, it would fall as a curtain of ignorance and
superstition over our fair land, and shut out the light of the dawning
Sun of Truth.It would mean a reversion to the blight and mold of the
Middle Ages, in many respects a return in a degree to the ignorance
and tyranny that stood for so many centuries like an impassable rock
in the pathway of human progress.The attempt to foist upon a
progressive people a system of medicine and healing which is wholly
unscientific and uncertain in its effects, but which is admittedly
known to be responsible for the death of millions and for untold
suffering and misery, and then to say, '_Thou shalt be cured thereby,
or not be cured at all_,' is an insult to the intelligence of the
Fathers of our liberties, and a crime upon a people striving for the
light.It smacks of the Holy Inquisition: You accept our creed, or you
shall go to hell--after we have broken you on the rack!Why, the
thought of subjecting this people to years of further dosing and
experimentation along the materialistic lines of the'regular' school,
of curtailing their liberties, and forcing their necks under the yoke
of medical tyranny, should come to them with the insistence of a
clarion call, and startle them into such action that the subtle evil
which lurks behind this proposed legislative action would be dragged
out into the light and exterminated!To permit commercialism and
greed, the lust of mammon, and the pride of the flesh that expresses
itself in the demand, 'Who shall be greatest?'to dictate the course
of conduct that shall shape the destinies of a great people, is to
admit the failure of free government, and to revert to a condition of
mind that we had thought long since outgrown.To yield our dear-bought
liberties to Italian ecclesiastics, on the other hand--well, Doctor,
_it is just unthinkable_!"Well, at least you are delightfully frank with me.Yet you have
the effect of making me feel as if--as if I were in some way behind a
veil.That--"

"Well, the human mind is very decidedly behind a veil--indeed, behind
many of them.Mankind just grope
about all their lives back of these veils, not knowing that God is
right before them all the time.God has got to be everything, or else
He will be nothing.With or without drugs, it is God 'who healeth all
thy diseases.'The difficulty with physicians is that they are densely
ignorant of what healing means, and so they always start with a
dreadful handicap.They believe that there is something real to be
overcome--and of course fail to permanently overcome it.Many of them
are not only pitiably ignorant, but are in the profession simply to
make money out of the fears and credulity of the people.Doctor, the
physician of to-day is in no way qualified to handle the question of
public health--especially those doctors who say: 'If you won't take
our medicines we'll get a law passed that will make you take them.'To
place the health of the people in their hands would be a terrible
mistake.The agitation for a federal Department of Health is based
upon motives of ignorance and intentional wrong.If the people
generally knew this, they would rise in a body against it.Make what
laws you wish for yourself, Doctor.The human mind is constantly
occupied in the making of ridiculous laws and limitations.But do not
attempt to foist your laws upon the people.Tell me, why all this
agitation about teaching sex-hygiene in the public schools?Why not,
for a change, teach Christianity?But even
the Bible has been put out of the schools.By your
Church, that its interpretation may continue to be falsely made by
those utterly and woefully ignorant of its true meaning!"For some moments they continued their meal in silence.Then the girl
took up the conversation again."Doctor," she said, "will you come out
from among them and be separate?""Ah, that is the rub, then!Yes, oppose ignorance and falsity, even
though incarnate in Mr."He ruins everybody who
stands in his way!The cotton schedule has gone against him, and the
whole country will have to suffer for it!""But how can he make the country suffer because he has been blocked in
his colossal selfishness?""That I can not answer," said the doctor."But I do know that he has
intimated that there will be no cotton crop in this country next
year."Ames stands as the claim of omnipotent
evil," was his laconic reply.And when the meal was ended, the girl went her way, pondering deeply.But that was something too
dark to be reported to the Express.*       *       *       *       *

Three weeks from the day he had his brush with Carmen in the presence
of the President, Ames, the great corruptionist, the master
manipulator, again returned from a visit to Washington, and in a
dangerous frame of mind.What might have been his mental state had he
known that the train which drew his private car also brought Carmen
back to New York, can only be conjectured.It was fortunate, no doubt,
that both were kept in ignorance of that fact, and that, while the
great externalization of the human mind's "claim" of business sulked
alone in his luxurious apartments, the little follower after
righteousness sat in one of the stuffy day coaches up ahead, holding
tired, fretful babies, amusing restless children, and soothing away
the long hours to weary, care-worn mothers.When the financier's car drew into the station his valets breathed
great sighs of relief, and his French chef and <DW64> porter mopped the
perspiration from their troubled brows, while silently offering peans
of gratitude for safe delivery.When the surly giant descended the car
steps his waiting footman drew back in alarm, as he caught his
master's black looks.When he threw himself into the limousine, his
chauffeur drew a low whistle and sent a timidly significant glance in
the direction of the lackey.And when at last he flung open the doors
of his private office and loudly summoned Hood, that capable and
generally fearless individual quaked with dire foreboding."The Express--I want a libel suit brought against it at once!"Yes, sir," responded the lawyer meekly.Then, in a voice trembling with
anger: "Have you read the last week's issues?"She has no financial interest in the paper, sir.And, as for the
reports which they have published--I hardly think we can establish a
case from them--"

"What?If you and he can't make out a case
against them, then I'll get a judge and a lawyer who can!I want that
bill filed to-morrow!""Very well, sir," assented Hood, stepping back."Another thing," continued Ames, "see Judge Hanson and have the
calling of the Ketchim case held in abeyance until I am ready for it.I've got a scheme to involve that <DW64> wench in the trial, and drag
her through the gutters!So, she's still in love with Rincon, eh?Well, we'll put a crimp in that little affair, I guess!Has Willett
heard from Wenceslas?""I'll lift the scalp from that blackguard Colombian prelate if he
tries to trick me!But the detectives report that he has been in Spain
recently."he exclaimed in a voice that began
high and ended in a whisper.He lapsed into a reflective mood, and for some moments his thoughts
seemed to wander far.Then he pulled himself together and roused out
of his meditations."You told Jayne that I would back the Budget to any extent, provided
it would publish the stuff I sent it?"You and Willett set about at once getting up daily
articles attacking the Express.I want you to dig up every move ever
made by Hitt, Haynerd, that girl, Waite, Morton, and the whole
miserable, sneaking outfit!Rake up every scandal, every fact, or
rumor, that is in any way associated with any of them.I want them
literally cannonaded by the Budget!Haynerd was a bum before he got the Social Era!Waite is an unfrocked
priest!That girl--that girl is
a--Did you know that she used to be in a brothel down in the red-light
district?Great record the publishers of the Express
have, eh?I want you and Jayne to bury that whole outfit
under a mountain of mud!I'm ready to spend ten millions to do it!"I think we can do it, Mr.Now, another matter: I'm out to get the President's
scalp!Begin with those New York papers which we
can influence.I'll get Fallom and Adams over here for a conference.Meanwhile, think over what we'd better say to them.Our attacks upon
the President must begin at once!I've already bought up a Washington
daily for that purpose.They have a few facts now that will discredit
his administration!"Ah--a--there is a matter that I must mention as
soon as you are ready to hear it, Mr.It seems
that the reports which that girl has made have been translated into
several languages, and are being used by labor agitators down there to
stir up trouble.The mill hands, you know, never really understood
what your profits were, and--well, they have always been quite
ignorant, you know, regarding any details of the business.But now
they think they have been enlightened--they think they see how the
tariff has benefited you at their expense--and they are extremely
bitter against you.That priest, Father Danny, has been doing a lot of
talking since the girl was down there."cried Ames, rising from his chair, then sinking back again.Ames," the lawyer continued, "the situation is fast
becoming acute.The mill hands don't believe now that you were ever
justified in shutting down, or putting them on half time.And, whether
you reduce wages or not, they are going to make very radical demands
upon you in the near future, unless I am misinformed.These demands
include better working conditions, better tenements, shorter hours,
and very much higher wages.Also the enforcement of the child labor
law, I am sorry to say."Ames, you know you have said that it would
strengthen your case with Congress if there should be a strike at
Avon."I am
distinctly out of favor with the President--owing to that little <DW64>
wench!And Congress is going against me if I lose Gossitch, Logue, and
Mall!That girl has put me in bad down there!By G--"

"But, Mr.Ames, she can be removed, can she not?"But--if we can drive the
Express upon the shoals, and then utterly discredit that girl, either
in the libel suit or the Ketchim trial, why, then, with a little show
of bettering things at Avon, we'll get what we want.Say, is--is Sidney with the Express?"Hood started, and shot a look of mingled surprise and curiosity at his
master.Was it possible that Ames--

"You heard my question, Mr.Yes, sir--Sidney is still with them.He--a--they say
he has quite conquered his--his--"

"You mean, he's no longer a sot?"Don't sit there like a smirking Chinese god!"Ames, I learn that Sidney has been cured of his habits, and
that the--that girl--did it," stammered the nervous lawyer.Ames's mouth jerked open--and then snapped shut.His
head slowly sank until his chin touched his breast.And as he sat thus
enwrapped, Hood rose and noiselessly left the room.Alone sat the man of gold--ah, more alone than even he knew.Alone
with his bruised ambitions, his hectored egoism, his watery aims.Alone and plotting the ruin of those who had dared bid him halt in his
mad, destroying career.Alone, this high priest of the caste of
absolutism, of the old individualism which is fast hurrying into the
realm of the forgotten.Alone, and facing a new century, with whose
ideals his own were utterly, stubbornly, hopelessly discrepant.Alone he sat, looking out, unmoved, upon the want and pain of
countless multitudes gone down beneath the yoke of conditions which he
had made too hard for them.Looking, unmoved, unhearing, upon the
bitter struggles of the weak, the ignorant, the unskilled, the gross
hewers of wood and drawers of water.Looking, and knowing not that in
their piteous cry for help and light was sounded his own dire peril.The door opened, and the office boy announced the chief stenographer
of the great bank below.Ames looked up and silently nodded permission
for the man to enter.Ames," the clerk began, "I--I have come to ask a favor--a
great favor.I am having difficulty--considerable difficulty in
securing stenographers, but--I may say--my greatest struggle is
with myself.Ames, I can not--I simply can not continue to
hire stenographers at the old wage, nine dollars a week!I know how
these girls are forced to live.Ames, with prices where they
are now, they can not live on that!Say,
ten or twelve dollars to start with?""Why do you come to me with your request?""Yes, sir, I know," replied the young man with hesitation."But--I--did
speak to him about it, and--he refused.""I can do nothing, sir," returned Ames in a voice that chilled the
man's life-current.I refuse to remain here and hire
stenographers at that criminal wage!""Very well, sir," replied Ames in the same low, freezing tone.Again the guardian of the sanctity of private property was left alone.Again, as he lapsed into dark revery, his thought turned back upon
itself, and began the reconstruction of scenes and events long since
shadowy dreams.And always as they built, the fair face of that young
girl appeared in the fabric.And always as he retraced his course, her
path crossed and crossed again his own.Always as he moved, her
reflection fell upon him--not in shadow, but in a flood of light,
exposing the secret recesses of his sordid soul.He dwelt again upon the smoothness of his way in those days, before
her advent, when that group of canny pirates sat about the Beaubien's
table and laid their devious snares.It was only the summer before she
came that this same jolly company had merged their sacred trust assets
to draw the clouds which that autumn burst upon the country as the
worst financial panic it had known in years.And so shrewdly had they
planned, that the storm came unheralded from a clear sky, and at a
time when the nation was never more prosperous.They had wagered that he could not put it
through.How neatly he had turned the trick, filled his pockets, and
transformed their doubts into wondering admiration!Oh, yes, there had been some suffering, he had been told.How surprised the people of these United
States would be some day to learn that this tropic struggle was in
essence an American war!The smug and unthinkingly contented in this
great country of ours regarded the frenzied combat in the far South as
but a sort of _opera bouffe_.And he,
when that war should end, would control navigation on the great
Magdalena and Cauca rivers, and acquire a long-term lease on the
emerald mines near Bogota.Untold suffering--countless
broken hearts--indescribable, maddening torture--he had not given that
a thought.His trip to Washington had been
exhausting.His eyes had been bloodshot,
and there had been several slight hemorrhages from the nose.His
physician had shaken his head gravely, and had admonished him to be
careful--

But why did that girl continue to fascinate him?Why now,
in all his scheming and plotting, did he always see her before him?Was it only because of her rare physical beauty?If he wrote or read,
her portrait lay upon the page; if he glanced up, she stood there
facing him.There was never accusation in her look, never malice, nor
trace of hate.No; but always she
smiled--always she looked right into his eyes--always she seemed to
say, "You would destroy me, but yet I love you."Aye, much more so than he did her.She would scorn the use of his
methods.He had to admit _that_, though he hated her, detested her,
would have torn her into shreds--even while he acknowledged that he
admired her, yes, beyond all others, for her wonderful bravery and her
loyal stand for what she considered the right.He must have dozed while he sat there in the warm office alone.Surely, that hideous object now floating before his straining gaze,
that thing resembling the poor, shattered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, was not
real!It was but a shadow, a flimsy thing of thought!And that
woestricken thing there, with its tenuous arms extended toward
him--was that Gannette?But, that other shade--so like his wife, a few months dead, yet alive
again!Whence came that look of horror in a face once so haughty!It
was unreal, ghastly unreal, as it drifted past!Ah, now he knew that
he was dreaming, for there, there in the light stood Carmen!Oh, what
a blessed relief to see that fair image there among those other
ghastly sights!He would speak to her--

But--_God above_!_What was that?_ A woman--no, not Carmen--fair
and--

Her white lips moved--they were transparent--he could see right
through them--and great tears dropped from her bloodless cheeks when
her accusing look fell upon him!Slowly she floated nearer--she stopped before him, and laid a hand
upon his shoulder--it was cold, cold as ice!He tried to call out--to
rise--to break away--

And then, groaning aloud, and with his brow dripping perspiration, he
awoke.Hood entered, but stopped short when he saw his master's white face.Ames passed a hand across his wet forehead."A--a little tired, that's
all, I guess.The lawyer laid a large envelope upon the desk."There's a delegation of Avon mill hands in the outer office.Again he
seemed to see that smiling girl before him.His jaw set, and his face
drew slowly down into an expression of malignity.Then, without
examining its contents, he tore the envelope into shreds, and cast the
pieces into the waste basket."Wire Pillette at
once to discharge these fellows, and every one else concerned in the
agitation!If those rats down there want to fight, they'll find me
ready!"CHAPTER 14


The immense frame of J. Wilton Ames bent slightly, and the great legs
might have been seen to drag a bit, as the man entered his private
elevator the morning after his rejection of the mill hands' demands,
and turned the lever that caused the lift to soar lightly to his
office above.And a mouse--had the immaculate condition of his
luxurious _sanctum_ permitted such an alien dweller--could have seen
him sink heavily into his great desk chair, and lapse into deep
thought.Hood, Willett, and Hodson entered in turn; but the magnate
gave them scant consideration, and at length waved them all away, and
bent anew to his meditations.Truth to tell--though he would not have owned it--the man was now
dimly conscious of a new force at work upon him; of a change, slowly,
subtly taking place somewhere deep within.He was feebly cognizant of
emotions quite unknown; of unfamiliar sentiments, whose outlines were
but just crystallizing out from the thick magma of his materialistic
soul.And he fought them; he hated them; they made him appear unto himself
weak, even effeminate!His abhorrence of sentimentalism had been among
the strongest of his life-characteristics; and yet, though he could
not define it, a mellowing something seemed to be acting upon him that
dull, bitterly cold winter morning, that shed a soft glow throughout
his mental chambers, that seemed to touch gently the hard, rugged
things of thought that lay within, and soften away their sharp
outlines.He might not know what lay so heavily upon his thought, as
he sat there alone, with his head sunk upon his breast.And yet the
girl who haunted his dreams would have told him that it was an
interrogation, even the eternal question, "What shall it profit a
man--?"Had ever such heavenly music touched his ears before!He would have held out his arms to her if he could.And yet, how dared she come to him?How dared she, after what she had
done?To
stand within the protection which her sex afforded and vivisect anew
his tired soul?But, whatever her motives, this girl did the most
daring things he had ever seen a woman do."Isn't it funny," she said, as she stood before him with a whimsical
little smile, "that wherever I go people so seldom ask me to sit
down!"Ames sank back into his seat without speaking.Carmen stood for a
moment looking about her rich environment; then drew up a chair close
to him."You haven't the slightest idea why I have come here, have you?"she
said sweetly, looking up into his face."I must confess myself quite ignorant of the cause of this unexpected
pleasure," he returned guardedly, bending his head in mock deference,
while the great wonder retained possession of him."Well," she went on lightly, "will you believe me when I tell you that
I have come here because I love you?"So this was an attack from
a different quarter!Hitt and Haynerd had invoked her feminine wiles,
eh?With one blow the unfamiliar sentiment which had been
shedding its influence upon him that morning laid the ugly suspicion
dead at his feet.A single glance into that sweet face turned so
lovingly up to his brought his own deep curse upon himself for his
hellish thought."You know," she bubbled, with a return of her wonted airy gaiety, "I
just had to run the gauntlet through guards and clerks and office boys
to get here.Aren't you glad I didn't send in my card?For then you
would have refused to see me, wouldn't you?""If I
had known you were out there," he said more gently, "I'd have sent out
and had you dragged in.I--I have wanted something this morning; and
now I am sure it was--"

"Yes," she interrupted, taking the words out of his mouth, "you wanted
_me_.You see, it's just absolutely impossible to
oppose anybody who loves you.You know, that's the very method Jesus
gave for overcoming our enemies--to love them, just love them to
pieces, until we find that we haven't any enemies at all any more.Well, that's the way I've been doing with
you--just loving you."The man's brows knotted, and his lips tightened.Or was there aught but the deepest sincerity expressed
in the face from which he could not take his eyes?And
yet, did ever human being talk so strangely, so weirdly, as she?"I thought you looked upon me as a human monster."After all,
there was a note of pathos in the question.Carmen laid her hand upon
his."It's the _real_ you that I love," she answered gently."The monster
is only human thought--the thought that has seemed to mesmerize you.But you are going to throw off the mesmerism, aren't you?I'll help
you," she added brightly."You're going to put off the 'old man'
completely--and you're going to begin by opening yourself and letting
in a little love for those poor people down at Avon, aren't you?At the mention of the people of Avon his face became stern and dark.She had not mentioned the Beaubien,
Miss Wall, the Express, nor herself."You see, you don't understand, Mr.You'll be, oh, so surprised
some day when you learn a little about the laws of thought--even the
way human thought operates!For you can't possibly do another person
an injury without that injury flying back and striking you.You may not feel the effects of its return right
away--but it does return, and the effects accumulate.And then, some
day, when you least expect it, comes the crash!But, when you love a
person, why, that comes back to you too; and it never comes alone.It
just brings loads of good with it.Ames," she cried, suddenly rising and seizing both his hands,
"you've just _got_ to love those people down there!You can't help it,
even if you think you can, for hate is not real--it's an awful
delusion!"It was not so much an appeal which the girl made as an affirmation of
things true and yet to come.The mighty _Thou shalt not!_ which Moses
laid upon his people, when transfused by the omnipotent love of the
Christ was transformed from a clanking chain into a silken cord.The
restriction became a prophecy; for when thou hast yielded self to the
benign influence of the Christ-principle, then, indeed, thou shalt not
desire to break the law of God.Carmen returned to her chair, and sat eagerly expectant.Ames groped
within his thought for a reply.And then his mental grasp closed upon
the words of Hood."They are very bitter against me--they hate me!""They reflect in kind your thought of
them.Your boomerangs of greed, of exploitation, of utter indifference
which you have hurled at them, have returned upon you in hatred.Do
you know that hatred is a fearful poison?And do you know that
another's hatred resting upon you is deadly, unless you know how to
meet and neutralize it with love?For love is the neutralizing
alkaloid.""Love is--weakness," he said in a low tone.Why, there is no such mighty power in the whole
universe as love!"We argue from different
standpoints," he said."I am a plain, matter-of-fact, cold-blooded
business man."And that," she replied in a voice tinged with sadness, "is why
business is such chaos; why there is so much failure, so much anxiety,
fear, loss, and unhappiness in the business world.Ames, you
haven't the slightest conception of real business, have you?"Then, brightly, "I am in business,
Mr.The business of
attempting to annihilate me!""I am in the business of reflecting good to you, and to all mankind,"
she gently corrected."Then suppose you manifest your love for me by refraining from
meddling further in my affairs.Suppose from now on you let me
alone.""Why--I am not meddling with you, Mr.He opened a drawer of the desk and took out several copies of
the Express."I am to consider that this is not strictly meddling,
eh?"he continued, as he laid the papers before her."No, not at all," she promptly replied."That's uncovering evil, so's
it can be destroyed.All that evil, calling itself you and your
business, has got to come to the surface--has got to come up to the
light, so that it can be--"

"Ah!Then I, the monster, must be exposed, eh?And the mines and mills which I
own--"

"You own nothing, Mr.Ames, except by consent of the people whom you
oppress.They will wake up some day; and then state and national
ownership of public utilities will come, forced by such as you.""And that desideratum will result in making everybody honest, I
suppose?"All our
present troubles, whether domestic, business, civic, or social, come
from a total misapprehension of the nature of God--a misunderstanding
of what is really _good_.We have _all_ got to prove Him.And we are
very foolish to lose any more time setting about it, don't you think
so?"You see," she went on, while he sat studying her, "those poor people
down at Avon don't know any more about what is the real good than you
do.And that's why their thoughts and yours center upon the false
pleasures of this ephemeral existence called life--this existence of
the so-called physical senses--and why you both become the tools of
vice, disease, and misfortune.They build up such men as you, and then
you turn about and crush them.And in the end you are both what the
Bible says--poor, deluded fools.""Well, I'll be--"

"Oh, don't swear!"she pleaded, again seizing his hand and laughing up
into his face."It's time you started to prove God," she said earnestly."Won't you
begin now--to-day?Haven't you yet learned that evil is the very
stupidest, dullest, most uninteresting thing in the world?Won't you turn from your material endeavors now, and take time
to learn to really live?You've got plenty of time, you know, for you
aren't obliged to work for a living."She was leaning close to him, and her breath touched his cheek.Her
soft little hand lay upon his own.And her great, dark eyes looked
into his with a light which he knew, despite his perverted thought,
came from the unquenchable flame of her selfless love.Again that unfamiliar sentiment--nay, rather, that sentiment long
dormant--stirred within him.Again his worldly concepts, long
entrenched, instantly rose to meet and overthrow it.He had not yet
learned to analyze the thoughts which crept so silently into his
ever-open mentality.And to those
which savored of things earthy he still gave the power to build, with
himself as a willing tool."You will--help me--to live?"He thought her the most
gloriously beautiful object he had ever known, as she sat there before
him, so simply gowned, and yet clothed with that which all the gold of
Ophir could not have bought."Yes, gladly--oh, so gladly!"Her eyes sparkled with a rush of tears."Don't you think," he said gently, drawing his chair a little closer
to her, "that we have quite misunderstood each other?"But," with a happy smile
again lighting her features, "we can understand each other now, can't
we?"And hasn't the time come for us to work together,
instead of continuing to oppose each other?""I--I have been thinking so ever since I returned yesterday from
Washington.I am--I--"

"We need each other, don't we?"the artless girl exclaimed, as she
beamed upon him."I can help
you--more than you realize--and I want to.I--I've been sorry for you,
little girl, mighty sorry, ever since that story got abroad about--"

"Oh, never mind that!""We are living in the
present, you know."And I
want to see them straightened out.And you and I can do it, little
one.Madam Beaubien hasn't been treated right, either."We're going to
forget that in the good we're going to do, aren't we?"And you are going to get a square deal.Now, I've got
a plan to make everything right.I want to see you in the place that
belongs to you.I want to see you happy, and surrounded by all that is
rightfully yours.And if you will join me, we will bring that all
about.I told you this once before, you may remember."He stopped and awaited the effect of his words upon the girl.Ames," she replied, her eyes shining with a great hope,
"don't think about me!It's the people at Avon that I want to help.""We'll help them, you and I. We'll make things right all round.And
Madam Beaubien shall have no further trouble."Sidney shall come home--"

With a rush the impulsive girl, forgetting all but the apparent
success of her mission, threw herself upon him and clasped her arms
about his neck."Oh," she cried, "it is love that has done all this!The startled man strained the girl tightly in his arms.He could feel
the quick throbbing in her throat.Her warm breath played upon his
cheek like fitful tropic breezes.For a brief moment the supreme gift
of the universe seemed to be laid at his feet.For a fleeting interval
the man of dust faded, and a new being, pure and white, seemed to rise
within him."Yes," he murmured gently, "we'll take him to our home with us."Slowly, very slowly, the girl released herself from his embrace and
stepped back.she murmured, searching his face for the
meaning which she had dimly discerned in his words.He reached forward and with a quick movement seized her
hand.Not now--no, you
needn't come to me until you are ready.Why, I didn't know until to-day what it was that was making
me over!Don't--"

Carmen had struggled away from him, and, with a look of bewilderment
upon her face, was moving toward the door."Oh, I didn't know," she
murmured, "that you were--were--proposing _marriage_ to me!"We'll begin all over again, you and I!Why, I'll do anything--anything
in the world you say, Carmen, if you will come to me--if you will be
my little wife!"I know--I know," he hastily resumed, as she halted and stood
seemingly rooted to the floor, "there is a great difference in our
ages.But that is nothing--many happy marriages are made between ages
just as far apart as ours.I'll make Madam Beaubien rich!I'll support the
Express, and make it what you want it to be!I'll do whatever you say
for the people of Avon!Think, little girl, what depends now upon
you!"Carmen turned and came slowly back to him."And--you will not do these
things--unless I marry you?"she said in a voice scarcely above a
whisper."I will do them all, Carmen, if you will come to me!""But--oh, you were only deceiving me all the time!And now--if I
refuse--then what?""It depends upon you, entirely--and you will come?Not now--but within
the next few months--within the year--tell me that you will!""But--you will do these things whether I come to you or not?""I've put it all into your hands," he answered shortly.Then
she glanced about in helpless bewilderment."I--I--love--you," she murmured, as she looked off toward the window,
but with unseeing eyes."I would do anything for you that was right.I--love--everybody--everybody; but there are no conditions to _my_
love.she suddenly cried, burying her face in her hands and
bursting into tears."You have tried to _buy_ me!"Taking her by the hand he led her,
unresisting, back to her chair."Listen," he said, bending toward her."Go home now and think it
all over.It was sudden, I admit; I
took you by surprise.But--well, you are not going to prevent the
accomplishment of all that good, are you?She had been crushed; and
another lesson in the cruelty of the human mind--that human mind which
has changed not in a thousand years--had been read to her.But again
she smiled bravely, as she wiped her eyes."It's all right now," she murmured."It was all right all the
time--and I was protected.""Some day," she said gently, and in a voice
that trembled just a little, "you will help the people of Avon, but
not because I shall marry you."Then you refuse my offer, do you?""Remember, all the blame will be upon you.She saw now with a clairvoyance which separated
him from the mask which he had worn.Her glance penetrated until it
found his soul."You have shown me the depths of the carnal mind," she slowly replied."The responsibility is not with me, but with--God.I--I came to-day
to--to help you.But now I must leave you--with Him."He stooped and took up her muff which lay upon the floor.As he did so,
a letter fell out.He seized it and glanced at the superscription.Another little _billet-doux_ to your
priestly lover, eh?"She looked down at the letter which he held."It is money," she said,
though her thought seemed far away."Money that I am sending to a
little newsboy who bears his name."He rose and opened a drawer in his desk.Taking out a paper-bound
book, he held it out to the girl."Here's a
little piece of work which your brilliant lover did some time ago.Do you know the penalty your
clerical paramour paid for that, eh?Then I'll tell you," bending over
close to her ear, "his _life_!"She staggered
a few steps toward the door, then stopped."God--is--is--_everywhere_!"Then she reeled, and fell heavily to the floor.CHAPTER 15


If additional proof of the awful cost of hating one's fellow-men were
required, the strike which burst upon the industrial world that winter
must furnish it in sickening excess.But other facts, too, were
rendered glaringly patent by that same desperate clash which made Avon
a shambles and transformed its fair name into a by-word, to be spoken
only in hushed whispers when one's thought dwells for a moment upon
the madness of the carnal mind that has once tasted blood.The
man-cleft chasm between labor and capital, that still unbridged void
which separates master and servant, and which a money-drunk class
insolently calls God-made, grows wider with each roar of musketry
aimed by a frenzied militia at helpless men and women; grows deeper
with each splitting crack of the dynamite that is laid to tear asunder
the conscienceless wielder of the goad; and must one day fall gaping
in a cavernous embouchure that will engulf a nation.Hitt saw it, and shuddered; Haynerd, too.Ames may have dimly marked
the typhoon on the horizon, but, like everything that manifested
opposition to this superhuman will, it only set his teeth the firmer
and thickened the callous about his cold heart.And she knew--and the world must some day know--that but one tie has
ever been designed adequate to bridge this yawning canon of human
hatred.Aye, well she knew that the world laughed,
and called it chimera; called it idealism, and emotional weakness.And well she knew that the most pitiable weakness the world has ever
seen was the class privilege which nailed the bearer of the creed of
love upon the cross, and to-day manifests in the frantic grasping of a
nation's resources, and the ruthless murder of those who ask that
they, too, may have a share in that abundance which is the common
birthright of all.Do the political bully, the grafter, the tout, know
the meaning of love?Oh, not by the
hypocritical millionaire pietists who prate their glib platitudes to
their Sunday Bible classes, and return to their luxurious homes to
order the slaughter of starving women and babes!They, like their poor
victims, are deep under the spell of that mesmerism which tells them
that evil is good.Nor by the Church, with its lamentable weakness of
knowledge and works.Only by those who have learned something of the
Christ-principle, and are striving daily to demonstrate its
omnipotence in part, can the world be taught a saving knowledge of the
love that solves every problem and creates a new heaven and a newer,
better concept of the earth and its fullness.That morning when Carmen went to see Ames the Express received word of
the walk-out of the Avon mill employes.Almost coincident with the
arrival of the news, Carmen herself came unsteadily into Hitt's
office.The editor glanced up at her, then looked a second time.He
had never before seen her face colorless."What work have you--for me--to-day?"Then, so low that he scarcely caught the
words, "I--I have been with--a friend."Sidney Ames came puffing into the office at that moment."How does it happen you're out riding with
Willett?Saw him help you out of an auto just now.""He brought me here," she answered softly.Hitt and the lad stared at her with open mouths.She turned, and
started for her own room, moving as if in a haze.As she neared the
door she stumbled.Sidney sprang after her and caught her in his arms.When she turned her face, they saw that her eyes were swimming in
tears.Hitt closed the door after him, then took
the girl's hand and led her back to his own chair."Now, little one,"
he said gently, "tell me all about it."Then the tears began to flow; and then she
leaned her head against him and sobbed--sobbed as does the stricken
mother who hangs over the lifeless form of her babe--sobbed as does
the strong man bereft of the friend of his bosom--sobbed as did the
Man of Sorrow, when he held out his arms over the worldly city that
cruelly rejected him.He was the channel for the divine; yet the
wickedness of the human mind broke his great heart.Carmen was not far
from him at that moment.Hitt held her hand, and choked back the lump that filled his throat.Then the weeping slowly ceased, and the girl looked up into his
anxious face."It's all past now," she said brokenly."Jesus forgave them that
killed him.And--"

"You have been with--Ames?"said Hitt in a low, quiet tone."And he
tried to kill you?""He--he knew not what he was doing.Evil used him, because as
yet he has no spiritual understanding."Well, little girl, I am waiting for the whole story.It
didn't happen--it wasn't real.I--I seemed to manifest weakness--and I
fell--to the floor--but I didn't lose consciousness."But what had Ames said to you, Carmen?"persisted Hitt, his face dark
with anger.Ames only as--as God's child," she
murmured."Evil is not real, and it doesn't happen.Now I want to
work--work as I never did before!_I must!_"

"Will you not tell me more about it?"he asked, for he knew now that a
deadly thrust had been made at the girl's life."It didn't happen," was her
reply.A suspicion flashed into Hitt's mind, kindled by the girl's insistence
upon the nothingness of death."Carmen," he asked, "did he tell you
that--some one had died?"She came to him and laid her head against him.I shall overcome it, for God is with me.Promise that no
one but us shall know!The man's eyes grew moist, and his throat filled.He drew the girl to
him and kissed her forehead."It shall be as you wish, little one," he
said in a choking voice.This is another
opportunity to--to prove God!He turned to his desk with a heavy heart."There is work to be done
now," he said."I wonder--"

She took the telegram from his hands and scanned it.At once she
became calm, her own sorrow swallowed up in selfless love."Oh, they
have gone out at Avon!Hitt, I must go there at once!""I thought so," he replied, swallowing hard.But you are in higher hands than mine, Carmen.And we, Sidney and I, will
say nothing of--of your visit to his father."*       *       *       *       *

That night Hitt called up the Beaubien and asked if he and Haynerd
might come and talk with her after the paper had gone to press, and
requesting that she notify Carmen and Father Waite.A few hours later
the little group met quietly in the humble cottage.Miss Wall and
Sidney were with them.And to them all those first dark hours of
morning, when as yet the symbol of God's omnipresence hung far below
the horizon, seemed prescient with a knowledge of evil's further
claims to the lives and fortunes of men."I have asked you here," Hitt gravely announced when they were
assembled, "to consider a matter which touches us all--how deeply, God
alone knows.At ten o'clock to-night I received this message."He
opened the paper which he held in his hand and read:

  "'Property of Hitt oil company, including derricks, pump houses,
  storage tanks, destroyed by fire.Dynamite in pump houses
  exploded, causing wells to cave and choke.The news burst over them like the cracking of a bomb.Haynerd, who,
like the others, had been kept in ignorance of the message until now,
started from his chair with a loud exclamation, then sank back limp.Evil seemed to have chosen that day with
canny shrewdness to overwhelm her with its quick sallies from out the
darkness of the carnal mind."I see in this," he said slowly, "the
culmination of a long series of efforts to ruin the Express.That my
oil property was deliberately wrecked, I have not the slightest doubt.demanded Haynerd, having again found his voice."The Express has stood before the world as a
paper unique and apart.And because of its high ideals, the forces of
evil singled it out at the beginning for their murderous assaults.That the press of this country is very generally muzzled, stifled,
bought and paid for, I have good reason now to know.My constant
brushes with the liquor interests, with low politicians, judges,
senators, and dive-keepers, have not been revealed even to you.Could
you know the pressure which the Church, both Catholic and Protestant,
has tried to exert upon us, you would scarce credit me with veracity.But the Express has stood out firm against feudalism, mediaevalism,
and entrenched ecclesiasticism.It has fearlessly opposed the
legalizing of drugging.It has fought the debauching of a nation's
manhood by the legalized sale of a deadly poison, alcohol.And it has
fought without quarter the pernicious activity of morally stunted
brewers and distillers, whose hellish motto is, 'Make the boys drink!'It has fought the money octopus, and again and again has sounded to
the world the peril which money-drunken criminals like Ames and his
clique constitute.And for that we must now wear the crown of
martyrdom!"Silence, dismal and empty, lay over the little room for a long time."The Express has not been self-supporting.Its
growth has been steady, but it has depended for its deficit upon the
revenue from my oil property.Ames ruined Madam
Beaubien financially, as well as Miss Wall.And now, knowing that we all depended upon my oil wells, he has, I
doubt not, completely removed that source of income.""But," exclaimed Haynerd, "your property was insured, wasn't it?""Yes," replied Hitt, with a feeble attempt at a smile."But with the
proviso that dynamite should not be kept on the premises.You will
note that dynamite wrecked the wells.That doubtless renders my
policies void.But, even in case I should have a fighting chance with
the insurance companies, don't you think that they will be advised
that I purposely set fire to the wells, in order to collect the
insurance?And I shall find myself with a big
lawsuit on my hands, and with no funds to conduct the fight.Ames's
work, you know, is always thorough, and the Express is already facing
his suit for libel.""But you told us you were going to mortgage your property," said Miss
Wall."I stood ready to, should the Express require it.But, with its recent
little boom, our paper did not seem to need that as yet," he
returned."Yes, Ned, God _is_ good!""Can you say that, after all you have
endured, Carmen?"He looked at her for a moment, lost in wonder."An outcast babe," he
murmured, "left on the banks of a great river far, far away; reared
without knowledge of father or mother, and amid perils that hourly
threatened to crush her; torn from her beloved ones and thrust out
into an unknown and unsympathetic world; used as a stepping-stone to
advance the low social ambitions of worldly women; blackened by the
foulest slander, and ejected as an outcast by those who had fawned at
her feet; still going about with her beautiful message of love, even
though knowing that her childhood home is enveloped in the flames of
war, and her dear ones scattered, perhaps lost; spurned from the door
of the rich man whom she sought to save; carrying with her always the
knowledge that the one upon whom her affections had centered had a son
in distant Cartagena, and yet herself contributing to the support of
the little lad; and now, this morning--" He stopped, for he remembered
his promise."This morning," she finished, "shielded by the One who is both Father
and Mother to me.""That One surely ought to love you, Carmen--"

"He does," she answered softly.put in Haynerd, torn with anger and fear."What are we going
to do now?""Everything, Ned, that error seems to tell us not to do," replied the
girl.She reached over to the little table that stood near, and took from it
a Bible.Opening it, she read aloud, very slowly, the entire
fourteenth chapter of Exodus.Then she concluded by reading the last
two verses of the eighth chapter of Romans."Now," she said, looking up, "we know what we are going to do, don't
we?We are going right on, as'seeing Him who is invisible' to men
like Mr."There is no curse, whether of the Church, or of business, or of any
department of human thought, that can overthrow legitimate business;
and we are in the legitimate business of reflecting God to the world.If the physical sense of supply is now lost, we are fortunate, for now
we are obliged to acquire a higher sense.And we become aware of it in our own consciousness.It is there
that we interpret His supply.Ames interprets it one way; we, in a
very different way.God has always been able to prepare a table in the
wilderness of human thought.If we look for supply from without, we
shall not find it, for everything is within.And the very fact that
there is a legitimate demand shows that there is the supply to meet
it, for--though the world hasn't learned this yet--_it is the supply
itself that really creates the demand_!""Money, Ned, is the counterfeit of God.He is
our Principle--infinite, inexhaustible.We are facing a crisis, but, like every seeming disturbance of
the infinite harmony, it will vanish in a little while if we but cling
to the divine Mind that is God for guidance."Hitt folded the telegram and returned it to his pocket."Are you going
to Avon to-morrow?""And when we have in our midst this girl, who has borne,
without one word of complaint or reviling, the world's most poignant
sorrows!I--I really regret that I told you of--of this telegram.I
seemed for a moment to be overwhelmed.But I am on my feet again
now!"He reached into a pocket and took out some bills, which he handed to
Carmen."That will see you through for a day or so down there.Come," he added,
beckoning to Haynerd, "the Express will be issued to-morrow as usual,
and we must get to bed.I've really had quite a strenuous day!"He
turned, then paused and looked at Carmen.The girl caught the meaning in his glance, and went directly to the
piano."Don't," he said, "if you do not feel like it.This day has been a
hard one for you, I know.And--"

"But I do feel like it," she answered, smiling up at him.And," her voice dropped low, "I want to sing to--Him."Hitt gulped down something in his throat."The bravest little girl in
the whole wide world!"*       *       *       *       *

The carnage at Avon was not incidental; it was the logical effect of
definite mental causes.It was the orderly sequence of an endless
train of hatred of man for man, bred of greed and the fear of
starvation.And starvation is the externalized human belief that life
is at the caprice of intelligent matter.But that is an infraction of
the first Commandment, given when the human race was a babe.When the mill hands left their looms at evening of the day following
Ames's rejection of their demands, the master closed the doors behind
them and locked them out.The parrot-cry of the maudlin sentimental!But, four thousand men, women, and little children, with never a
dollar beyond their earnings of the day, thrust out into the blasts of
the bitterest winter the New England states had known in years!True; but why, then, did they strike?For, you see, that of itself
proved the soundness of Ames's single reply to all further appeal:
"There is nothing whatever to arbitrate."In the garden of the human mind waves many a flower, both black and
red, fanned by the foul winds of carnal thought.There grow the
brothel, the dive, the gin-shop, the jail.About these hardier stems
twine the hospital, the cemetery, the madhouse, the morgue.And Satan,
"the man-killer from the beginning," waters their roots and makes
fallow the soil with the blood of fools.But of those for whom the
gardener waits, there is none whose blood is so life-giving to these
noxious plants as that type of the materially rich who, like Ames,
have waxed gross upon the flesh of their own brothers.Ames was a gambler in human lives.They were his chips, by which he
gained or lost, and of themselves were void of intrinsic value.The
world was the table whereon he played; the game _rouge et noir_, with
the whirl of predatory commercialism as the wheel, and the ball
weighted to drop where he might direct.He carried millions on margin,
and with them carried the destinies, for weal or for woe, of millions
of his fellow-men, with not one thought that he did so at the cost of
their honor and morality, not less than their life-blood.It had been his custom to close his mills for several months each
year, in order to save expense when times were dull.And he did this
as casually as he closed the doors of his stables, and with much less
thought for the welfare of those concerned.It is doubtful if he had
ever really considered the fact that these four thousand human beings
were wholly dependent upon him for their very existence.For he was a
business man, and gold was far weightier in the scale of values than
human flesh, and much less easily obtained.Cain's comforting
philosophy was quite correct, else would the business world not have
been so firmly established upon it.Besides, he was terribly busy; and
his life was lived upon a plane high, high above that upon which these
swarming toilers groveled with their snouts in the dust.And now, with the doors of his mills barred against the hungry hordes,
he would frame the terms upon which they should be reopened.The
eight-hour law must not be enforced.Perhaps he could influence the
Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, as depriving the mill
hands of the right to labor as long as they pleased.And the right to organize and band together for their
common good would be contemptuously denied the ignorant rats who
should be permitted to toil for him once more.If they offered
violence, there was the state militia, armed and impatient to slay.Also, this was an excellent opportunity to stamp out trade-unionism
within the confines of his activities.He would win the plaudits of
the whole industrial world by so doing.He therefore immediately got
in touch with the Governor, a Tammany puppet, and received that loyal
henchman's warm assurances of hearty support for any measures which
the great magnate might wish to enforce.He then approached the
officers of the state guard, and secured them to a man.Times were
hard, and they welcomed his favor.He finally posted armed guards in
all his buildings at Avon, and bade them remember that property rights
were of divine institution.Then he sat down and dictated the general
policy to be followed by the Amalgamated Spinners' Association
throughout the country in support of his own selfish ends.His activity in these preparations, as in everything, was tremendous.His agents swarmed over the state like ants.The Catholic Archbishop
was instructed that he must remove Father Danny from Avon, as his
influence was pernicious.But the objection was made that the priest
was engaged only in humanitarian labors.It availed not; Ames desired
the man's removal.The widow Marcus likewise had
been doing much talking.Ames's lawyer, Collins, had her haled into
court and thoroughly reprimanded.And then, that matters might be
precipitated, and Congress duly impressed with the necessity of
altering the cotton schedule in favor of the Spinners' Association,
Ames ordered his agents to raise the rents of his miserable Avon
tenements.There were few, he knew, who dared even attempt to meet the
raise; and those who could not, he ordered set into the streets.It was a wild winter's day that the magnate chose for the enforcement
of this cruel order.A driving blizzard had raged throughout the
night, and the snow had banked up in drifts in places many feet deep.The temperature was freezing, and the strong east wind cut like a
knife.It was Ames's desire to teach these scum a needed lesson, and
he had chosen to enlist the elements to aid him in the righteous
task.For a week, ever since the strike was declared, Carmen had lived among
these hectored people.Daily her reports of the unbearable situation
had gone to Hitt.And through them the editor had daily striven to
awaken a nation's conscience.Ames read the articles, and through the
columns of the Budget sought to modify them to the extent of shifting
the responsibility to the shoulders of the mill hands themselves, and
to a dilatory Congress that was criminally negligent in so framing a
cotton tariff as to make such industrial suffering possible.Nor did
he omit to foully vilify the Express and calumniate its personnel.Amid curses, screams, and despairing wails, the satanic work of
ejecting the tenement dwellers went on that day.Ames's hirelings,
with loaded rifles, assisted the constables and city police in the
miserable work, themselves cursing often because of the keen blasts
that nipped their ears and numbed their well-cased limbs.More than
one tiny, wailing babe was frozen at the breast that dull, drab
afternoon, when the sun hung like a ghastly clot of human blood just
above the horizon, and its weird, yellow light flitted through the
snow-laden streets like gaunt spectres of death.More than one aged,
toil-spent laborer, broken at the loom in the service of his
insatiable master, fell prone in the drifts and lay there till his
thin life-current froze and his tired heart stopped.More than one
frenzied, despairing father, forgetful for the moment of the divine
right of property, rushed at a guard and madly strove with him, only
to be clubbed into complaisance, or, perchance, be left in a welter of
crimson on the drifting snow.She had been to see
Pillette that same morning, and had been laughed from his presence.She did not understand, she was told, what miserable creatures these
were that dared ask for bread and human rights.Wait; they themselves
would show their true colors.And it spurted like fountains
from their veins.And they saw it with dimming eyes, and were glad,
for it brought sweet oblivion.That night there were great fires
built along the frozen creek.Shacks and tents were hastily reared;
and the shivering, trembling women and babes given a desperate
shelter.Then the men, sullen and grim, drew off into little groups,
and into the saloons and gambling halls of the town.And when the
blizzard was spent, and the cold stars were dropping their frozen
light, these dull-witted things began to move, slowly at first,
circling about like a great forming nebula, but gaining momentum and
power with each revolution.More than a thousand strong, they circled
out into the frozen streets of the little town, and up along the main
thoroughfare.Their low
curses welled into a roar.And then, like the sudden bursting of
pent-up lava, they swept madly through the town, carrying everything
to destruction before them.Stores, shops, the bank itself, burst open before this wave of
maddened humanity.Guns and pistols were thrown from laden shelves to
the cursing, sweating mob below.Axes and knives were gathered by
armfuls, and borne out into the streets to the whirling mass.Great
barrels of liquor were rolled into the gutters and burst asunder.Bread and meat were dragged from the shops and savagely devoured.The
police gathered and planted themselves with spitting pistols before
the human surge.They went down like grass under stampeded cattle.Frightened clerks and operators rushed to the wires and sent wild,
incoherent appeals for help to New York.Pandemonium had the reins,
the carnal mind was unleashed.On rolled the mob, straight on to the massive stone house of Pillette,
the resident manager of the great Ames mills.On over the high iron
fence, like hungry dock rats.On up the
broad drive, shouting, shooting, moaning, raving.On over the veranda,
and in through broken windows and shattered doors, swarming like flies
over reeking carrion, until the flames which burst through the peaked
roof of the mansion drove them forth, and made them draw sullenly,
protestingly away, leaving the tattered bodies of Pillette and his
wife and daughters to be consumed in the roaring furnace.Oh, ye workers, ye toilers at loom and forge, it is indeed you who
bear the world's burdens!It is you who create the rich man's wealth,
and fight his battles.So ye fought in the great war between North and
South, and protected the rich man at home, hovering in fright over his
money bags.It is you who put into his hands the bayonet which he
turns against you to guard his wealth and maintain his iniquitous
privilege.It is indeed in your hands that the destinies of this great
nation lie; but what will ye do with your marvelous opportunity?What, with your stupendous, untried strength?Will ye once more set up
the golden calf, and prostrate yourselves before it?Will ye again
enthrone ecclesiastical despotism, and grovel before image of Virgin
and Saint?Will ye raise high the powers of mediaeval darkness, and
bend your necks anew to the yoke of ignorance and stagnation?But
think you now that flames and dynamite will break your present bonds?Aye, America may be made a land without a pauper, without a
millionaire, without industrial strife.But fire and sword will not
effect the transformation.Yes, perhaps, as has been said, our
"comfortable social system and its authority will some day be blown to
atoms."But shall we then be better off than we are to-day?For shall
we know then how to use our precious liberty?Blood-drunk and reeling, the mob turned from the flaming wreckage and
flowed down toward the mills.There were some among them, saner, and
prescient of the dire consequences of their awful work, who counseled
restraint.Down into the creek
bottom rolled the seething tide, with a momentum that carried it up
the far side and crashing into the heavily barred oak doors of the
great mills.A crushing hail of bullets fell upon them, and their
leaders went down; but the mass wavered not.Those within the
buildings knew that they would become carrion in the maws of the
ravening wolves outside, and fought with a courage fed with
desperation.In the solemn hush of death Socrates said, "The hour of departure has
arrived, and we go our ways, I to die and you to live.And mankind through the ages in their last
hours have echoed this sentiment of the gentle philosopher.For all
human philosophy leads to a single end--resignation.The frenzied hordes swarming about the Ames mills knew in their heart
of hearts that death was preferable to life in death under the goad of
human exploitation.In the distance, across the swale, the sky glowed red where the souls
of the agent of predatory wealth and his family had gone out in
withering heat.In the stricken town, men huddled their trembling
loved ones about them and stood with loaded muskets.Somewhere on the
steel bands that linked this scene of carnage with the great
metropolis beyond, a train plunged and roared, leaping over the
quivering rails at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, bringing eager
militiamen and their deadly instruments of civilization.For the Ames
mills were private property.*       *       *       *       *

In his luxurious office in the tower of the Ames building the master
sat that black night, surrounded by his laboring cohorts.Though they
strained under the excitement of the hour, Ames himself remained calm
and determined.He was in constant communication with the Governor at
Albany, and with the municipal officers of both New York and Avon.He
had received the tidings of the destruction of the Pillette family
with a grim smile.But the smile had crystallized into an expression
of black, malignant hatred when he demanded of the Governor that the
New York contingent of the state guard be sent at once to protect his
property, and specified that the bullets used should be of the
"dum-dum" variety.Such
bullets had been prohibited by the rules of modern warfare, it was
true.And Ames, foreseeing it all, had
purchased a hundred thousand rounds of these hellish things for the
militia to exchange for those which the Government furnished.And
then, as an additional measure of precaution, he had sent Hood and
Collins into the United States District Court and persuaded the
sitting judge to issue an injunction, enjoining any possible relief
committees from furnishing food and shelter to such as might enter the
industrial conflict being waged against him.And in the blood-red haze that hung
before his glittering eyes was framed the face of the girl who had
spurned him but a few days before.She was the embodiment of love that
had crossed his path and stirred up the very quintessence of evil
within him.From the first she had
aroused within his soul a conflict of emotions such as he had never
known before.And from the night when, in the Hawley-Crowles box at
the opera he had held her hand and looked down into her fathomless
eyes, he had been tortured with the conflicting desires to possess
that fair creature, or to utterly destroy her.Always she hovered just within his
grasp; and then drew back as his itching fingers closed.Always she
told him she loved him--and he knew she lied not.And such love had
its price--but not hers.And so hope strove with wrath, and chagrin
with despair.And
with it she had laid the giant low and bound him with chains.Though he knew now that she was lost to him forever; though
with foul curses he had seen hope flee; yet with it he had also bidden
every tender sentiment, every last vestige of good depart from his
thought forever more.And:

              "----with hope, farewell fear,
              Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;
              Evil, be thou my good!"And that night the master slept
not, but sat alone at his desk in the great Fifth Avenue mansion, and
plotted the annihilation of every human being who had dared oppose his
worldly ambitions.Plotted, too, the further degradation and final
ruin of the girl who had dared to say she loved him, and yet would not
become his toy.*       *       *       *       *

There is no need to curse the iniquitous industrial and social system
upon which the unstable fabric of our civilization rests, for that
system is its own fell curse in the rotting fruit it bears.A bit of
that poisonous fruit had now dropped from the slimy branch at Avon.Up
from the yards came the militiamen at double-quick, with rifles
unslung and loaded with the satanic Ames bullets.Behind them they
dragged two machine guns, capable of discharging three hundred times a
minute.The mob had concentrated upon the central building of the mill
group, and had just gained entrance through its shattered doors.Before them the guards were falling slowly back, fighting every inch
of the way.The air was thick with powder
smoke.The roar of battle was
deafening.Quickly swinging into action, the militia opened upon the mill hands.Hemmed in between two fires, the mob broke and fled down the frozen
stream.The officers of the guard then ordered their men to join in
the work of extinguishing the flames, which were beginning to make
headway, fanned by the strong draft which swept through the long
building.Then, the building
saved, they pitched their tents and sought a brief rest.At noon the soldiers were again assembled, for there remained the task
of arresting the leaders of the mob and bringing them to justice.The
town had been placed under martial law with the arrival of the
militia.Its streets were patrolled by armed guards, and a strong
cordon had been thrown around the shacks which the mill hands had
hastily erected the afternoon before.And now, under the protection of
a detachment of soldiers, the demand was made for the unconditional
surrender of the striking laborers.Dull terror lay like a pall over the miserable shacks huddled along
the dead stream.It was the dull, hopeless, numbing terror of the
victim who awaits the blow from the lion's paw in the arena.Weeping
wives and mothers, clasping their little ones to them, knelt upon the
frozen ground and crossed themselves.Young men drew their newly-wed
mates to their breasts and kissed them with trembling lips.Stern,
hard-faced men, with great, knotted hands, grouped together and looked
out in deadly hatred at the heartless force surrounding them.Then out from among them and across the ice went Carmen, up the
slippery hillside, and straight to the multi-mouthed machine gun, at
the side of which stood Major Camp.She had been all night with these
bewildered, maddened people.She had warmed shivering babes at her own
breast.She had comforted widows of a night, and newly-bereaved
mothers.She had bound up gaping wounds, and had whispered tender
words of counsel and advice.And they had clung to her weeping; they
had called upon Virgin and Saint to bless her; and they named her the
Angel of Avon--and the name would leave her no more."Take me," she said, "take me into court, and let me tell all."This beautiful, well-clad girl among
such miserable vermin!"You have demanded their leaders," she continued."I have been trying
to lead them.The major's eyes roved over her face and figure.He could make nothing
out of her words, but he motioned to an aid, and bade him place the
girl under arrest.A wild shout then rose from the shacks, as Carmen moved quietly away
under guard.A dozen men sprang out and rushed, muskets in
hand, up toward the soldiers to liberate her.Their narrow vision could
comprehend but one thing at a time; and they saw in the arrest of the
girl only an additional insult piled upon their already mountainous
injuries.It was answered by a shriek of rage from the hovels, and a murderous
return fire.Then the major gave another loud command, and the machine
guns began to vomit forth their clattering message of death.At the sound of shooting, Carmen's guard halted.Then one of them
fell, pierced by a bullet from the strikers.The others released the
girl, and hurried back to the battle line.Carmen stood alone for a
moment.One sang its death-song almost in her ear.Then she turned and made her way slowly up the hill to the
paralyzed town.Down in the vale beneath, Death swung his scythe with long, sweeping
strokes.The two machine guns poured a flaming sheet of lead into the
little camp below.The tents
caught fire, and were whirled blazing aloft by the brisk wind.Men
dropped like chaff from a mill.Hysterical, screaming women rushed
hither and yon to save their young, and were torn to shreds by the
merciless fusillade from above.Babes stood for a moment bewildered,
and then sank with great, gaping wounds in their little, quivering
bodies.And over all brooded the spirit of the great manipulator,
Ames, for the protection of whose sacred rights such ghastly work is
done among civilized men to-day.*       *       *       *       *

That night, while the stars above Avon drew a veil of gray between
them and the earth below, that they might not see the red embers and
stark bodies, Carmen came slowly, and with bent head, into the office
of the Express.As she approached Hitt's door she heard him in earnest
conversation with Haynerd."Yes," the editor was saying, "I had a mortgage placed on the Express
to-day, but I couldn't get much.And it's a short-term one, at that.Stolz refused point blank to help us, unless we would let him dictate
the policy of the paper.He's still
fighting Ames for control of C. and R. And I learn, too, that the
Ketchim case is called for next week.That probably means an attempt
by Ames to smoke Stolz out through Ketchim.It also means that
Carmen--"

"Yes; what about her?""That she will be forced to go upon the stand as a witness.""And that, as I read it, means a further effort on Ames's part to
utterly discredit her in the eyes of the world, and us through her
association with the Express.""But--where is she, Hitt?No word from her since we got the news of
the massacre at Avon this afternoon!Nothing happened to her, do you
think?"Hitt's face was serious, and he did not answer.Then Carmen herself
came through the open door.Both men rose with exclamations of
gladness to welcome her.The girl's eyes were wet, and her wonted
smile had gone.Hitt," she said, "I want a thousand dollars to-night."Hitt and Haynerd both sat down hard."I must go back to Avon to-morrow," she announced."And the money is
for the--the people down there."Her voice caught, and her words
stumbled.The two men looked at each other blankly.Then Hitt reached out and
took her hand."Tell us," he said, "about the trouble there to-day.""No," she said, "we will not talk about evil.A thousand--"

"I have that much on deposit in the bank now, Carmen," he replied
gravely.His thought was on the mortgage which he had signed that
morning."Then write me a check at once, and I will deposit it in the Avon bank
when I get there to-morrow.I must go home now--to see mother.""But--let me think about it, Carmen.Money is--well, won't less than
that amount do you?"Hitt sighed, but made no further protest.If the Express must founder,
then this money were well spent on the stricken people of Avon.He
took out his book, and immediately wrote the check and handed it to
the girl."Hitt," said Haynerd, after Carmen had left them and he had exhausted
his protests over the size of the check, "something's killing that
girl!And it isn't only the trouble at Avon, either!"She's no longer in this world, Ned.But Hitt would say nothing to further illuminate his cryptic remark,
and Haynerd soon switched to the grim topic of the industrial war in
progress at Avon.A
social and industrial system such as ours, which leaves the masses to
starve and consume with disease under intolerable burdens, that a
handful may rot in idleness and luxury, marks us in this latest
century as hopelessly insane!""Well, Ned, whence came the idea, think you, that it is divine justice
for a majority of the people on earth to be poor in order that a few
may be rich?And how are we going to get that perverted idea out of
the minds of men?"Legislation arouses no faith in me!We are
suffering here because, in our immensely selfish thought of ourselves
only, we have permitted the growth of such men as Ames, and allowed
them to monopolize the country's resources.Future
generations will laugh themselves sick over us!Why, what sane excuse
is there for permitting the commonest necessities of life to be
juggled with by gamblers and unmoral men of wealth?How can we ask to
be considered rational when we, with open eyes, allow 'corners' on
foodstuffs, and permit 'wheat kings' to amass millions by corralling
the supply of grain and then raising the price to the point where the
poor washerwoman starves?The
existence of poverty in a country like America is not only proof
positive that our social system is rotten to the core, but that our
religion is equally so!As a people we deserve to be incarcerated in
asylums!""A considerable peroration, Ned," smiled Hitt."And yet, one that I
can not refute.The only hope I see is in a radical change in the
mental attitude of the so-called enlightened class--and yet they are
the very worst offenders!"Doesn't the militia exist for men like Ames?To-day's work at
Avon proves it, I think!""Apparently so, Ned," returned Hitt sadly."And the only possibility
of a change in enlightened people is through a better understanding of
what is really good and worth while."Seems to me, Hitt, that it ought to stagger our preachers to realize
that nineteen centuries of their brand of Christianity have scarcely
even begun to cleanse society.What do you suppose Borwell thinks,
anyway?""Ned, they still cling to human law as necessarily a compelling
influence in the shaping of mankind's moral nature.""And go right on accepting the blood-stained money of criminal
business men who have had the misfortune to amass a million dollars!And, more, they actually hold such men up as patterns for the youth to
emulate!As if the chief end of endeavor were to achieve the glorious
manhood of an Ames!And he a man who is deader than the corpses he
made at Avon to-day!""The world's ideal, my friend, has long been the man who succeeds in
everything except that which is worth while," replied Hitt."But we
have been bidden to come out from the world, and be separate."Y--e--s, of course.But I can't take my thought from Avon--"

"And thereby you emphasize your belief in the reality of evil.""Then, if that is so, why not resign your position, Ned?Not while the Express has a leg to stand on!Your words are
an offense to me, sir!"Hitt rose and clapped his friend heartily on the back.Things do look very dark for us, if we look only with
the human sense of vision.But we are trying to look at the invisible
things within."Ned, Carmen is not in our hands.*       *       *       *       *

On the following afternoon at three a little group of Avon mill hands
crept past the guards and met in Father Danny's Mission, down in the
segregated vice district.They met there because they dared not go
through the town to the Hall.He had
slipped into town the preceding night, and remained in hiding through
the day.She had gone first to the
Hall, and then to the Mission, when she arrived again in the little
town.And after she had deposited Hitt's check in the bank she had
asked Father Danny to call together some of the older and more
intelligent of the mill hands, to discuss methods of disbursing the
money.Almost coincident with her arrival had come an order from Ames to
apprehend the girl as a disturber of the peace.The hush of death lay
over Avon, and even the soldiers now stood aghast at their own bloody
work of the day before.Carmen had avoided the main thoroughfares, and
had made her way unrecognized.At a distance she saw the town jail,
heavily guarded.Its capacity had been sorely taxed, and many of the
prisoners had been crowded into cold, cheerless store rooms, and
placed under guards who stood ready to mow them down at the slightest
threatening gesture.whispered Father Danny, after he had quietly
greeted the girl.It may be the beginning of the great
revolution we've all known wasn't far off!I just _had_ to get back
here!He sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.But soon he
sprang to his feet."No time for mollycoddling!""Come,
men, we'll give you checks, and do you get food for the babies.Only,
don't buy of the company stores!""We'll have to, Father," said one of them."But they've never taken cash from you there, ye know."Aye, Father, and they've discounted that ten per cent each time.But
if we bought at other stores we were discharged."But now then, Miss
Carmen, we'll begin."For an hour the girl wrote small checks, and the priest handed them
out to the eager laborers.They worked feverishly, for they knew that
at any moment they might be apprehended.cried Father Danny, at last unable to restrain himself."Did ye but know that this grand nation is wholly dependent on such as
you, its common people!Not on the rich, I say, the handful that own
its mills and mines, but on you who work them for your rich masters!"Ah, lass, it's but love that I'm dealin' out to 'em, God knows!And
yet, it's they that are masters of the situation, only they don't know
it!They've no leaders, except such as waste their
money and leave 'em in the ditch!The world's social schemes, Miss
Carmen, don't reach such as these.And they've got
the contempt of the wage-earners.""The Church, Father, could do much for these people, if--"

"Don't hesitate, Miss Carmen.You mean, if we didn't give all our
thought to the rich, eh?But still, it's wholly up to the people
themselves, after all.And, mark me, when they do rise, why, such men
as Ames won't know what's hit 'em!"The door was thrown violently open at that moment, and a squad of
soldiers under the command of a lieutenant entered.Carmen and Father Danny rose and faced them.The mill hands stood like
stone images, their faces black with suppressed rage.The lieutenant
halted his men, and then advanced to the girl."Is a woman named Carmen Ariza here?""I am she," replied the fearless girl."Come with us," he said in a rough voice.cried Father Danny, suddenly pulling the girl
back and thrusting himself before her.The mill hands
quickly formed about the girl.And then, with a yell of rage, they
threw themselves upon the soldiers.For a few minutes the little room was a bedlam.The crazed strikers
fought without weapons, except such as they could wrest from the
soldiers.One of them seized Carmen and
threw her beneath the table at which she had been working.The shouting and cursing might have been
heard for blocks around.Father Danny stood in front of the table,
beneath which lay the girl.He strove desperately to maintain his
position, that he might protect her, meantime frantically calling to
the mill hands to drag her out to the rear, and escape by the back
door.In the midst of the _melee_ a soldier mounted a chair near the door
and raised his rifle.The shot roared out, and Father Danny pitched
forward to the floor.Another shot, and still another followed in
quick succession.Then
they turned and fled precipitately through the rear exit.The lieutenant dragged Carmen from beneath the table and out through
the door.Then, assembling his men, he gave an order, and they marched
away with her up the icy street to the town jail.CHAPTER 16


With the wreckage which he had wrought strewn about him, J. Wilton
Ames sat at his rich desk far above the scampering human ants in the
streets below and contemplated the fell work of his own hands.And
often and anon as he looked, great beads of perspiration welled out
upon his forehead, and his breath came hot and dry.In the waste
basket at his feet lay crumpled the newspapers with their shrieking,
red-lettered versions of the slaughter at Avon.He was not a coward,
this man!But he had pushed that basket around the desk out of his
sight, for when he looked at it something rose before him that sent a
chill to his very soul.At times his vision blurred; and then he
passed his hands heavily across his eyes.He had chanced to read in
the grewsome accounts of the Avon massacre that little children had
been found among those fallen shacks, writhing in their last agonies.And the reports had said that great, red-dripping holes had been
ripped in their thin little bodies by those awful "dum-dum" bullets.And why had the demoniac soldiers down
there blown the brains from harmless women and helpless babes?He
really had not intended to go so far!The brats would have grown up to oppose
the vested privileges of the rich!They, too, would have become
anarchists and rioters, bent on leveling the huge industrial fabric
which such as he had so laboriously erected under the legal protection
afforded their sacred rights!And
the great captains of industry would thank him for the example he had
thus fearlessly set!To think of Avon was for him now to think in terms of blood.And yet
his carnal soul hourly wrestled sore with thoughts of a wholly
different stamp; with those strange emotions which he had felt when in
Carmen's presence; with those unfamiliar sentiments which, had he not
fought them back so bitterly, might have made him anew, and--

But the remembrance maddened him.His face grew black, and his mouth
poured forth a torrent of foul imprecations and threats upon her and
upon those who stood with her.He smote the
desk with his great fist.He fumed, he frothed, he hurled reason from
its throne, and bade the Furies again become his counselors.Upon the desk before him lay the mortgage papers which Hitt had
signed.He had bought the mortgage from the bank which had loaned the
Express the money.He would crush that sheet now, crush it until the
ink dripped black from its emasculated pages!And when it fell into
his hands, he would turn it into the yellowest of sensational
journals, and hoot the memory of its present staff from ocean to
ocean!Then, his head sunk upon his breast, he fell to wondering if he might
not secure a mortgage upon the Beaubien cottage, and turn its
occupants into the street.It was the
lever by which he moved the world, and clubbed its dull-witted
inhabitants into servile obeisance!Who could stand against him--

That girl!That obedient lackey hastened
into his master's presence."Called for this week, sir," replied Hood, glad that the announcement
could not possibly offend his superior."Brought up from Avon, and lodged in the Tombs, sir.""You tell Judge Spencer that if he allows her bail I'll see that his
federal appointment is killed, understand?"Ames regarded the man with a mixture of admiration and utter contempt.For Hood stood before him a resplendent example of the influence of
the most subtle of all poisons, the insidious lure of money.Soul and
body he had prostituted himself and his undoubted talents to it.And
now, were he to be turned adrift by Ames, the man must inevitably sink
into oblivion, squeezed dry of every element of genuine manhood, and
weighted with the unclean lucre for which his bony fingers had always
itched.He knows most about the formation of the defunct
Simiti company.""Well, see him and--you say he's young, and got a wife and baby?Offer
him twenty-five thousand to quit the case.""I'm afraid it wouldn't do, sir," returned Hood, shaking his head
dubiously."I've had men talking with him regarding the trial, and
he--"

"Then get him over here.I'll see if I can't persuade him," growled
Ames in an ugly tone.A few minutes later Reverend Darius Borwell
was ushered into the financier's private office.Ames," cried that gentleman of the cloth, "it's shocking,
terribly so, what those unbridled, unprincipled mill hands have drawn
upon themselves down in Avon!And four members of the Church
of the Social Revolution came to my study last evening and demanded
that I let them speak to my congregation on the coming Sabbath!"And I shall
have policemen stationed at the doors next Sunday to maintain order!To think that it has come to this in America!I would advise--"

"Nobody can get within a block of my house, sir, without ringing a
series of electric bells," replied Ames evenly."I have fifty guards
and private detectives in attendance in and about my premises all the
time.My limousine has been lined with sheet steel.I simply want to keep going
until I can carry out a few plans I have in hand."His thought had
reverted again to the fair girl in the Tombs."But now, Borwell," he continued, "I want to talk with you about
another matter.I am drawing up my will, and--"

"Why, my dear Mr.Ames thought of his physician's constantly iterated warning; but shook
his head."I may get caught in this Avon affair," he said evasively.The President has sent his message to
Congress, as you may be aware.There are unpleasant suggestions in it
regarding dispossession in cases like my own.I'm coming back by
magnanimously willing to Congress a hundred millions, to stand as a
fund for social uplift.""But the little matter I wish to discuss with you is the sum that I am
setting aside for the erection of a new church edifice," continued
Ames, eying the minister narrowly.cried that worthy gentleman, springing up and
clasping the financier's hand.One should not be too precipitate in
accepting tentative benefactions."Ah--we really should have--ah--a
trifle more, Mr.There's the settlement home, and the commons,
you know, and--"

"Humph!Well, we'll start with half a million," replied Ames dryly."By the way, you know Jurges, eh?Er--have
you any particular influence with him, if I may ask?"His sharp eyes
bored straight through the wondering divine."Why--yes--yes, I know the gentleman.And, as for influence--well, I
may--"

"Yes, just so," put in Ames."Now there is a trial coming up this
week, and Jurges will be called to the stand.I want you to give him
the true facts in regard to it.I'll call Hood, and we'll go over them
in detail now.Then you see Jurges this afternoon, and--say, he's
raising a building fund too, isn't he?"The magnate summoned Hood again; and for an hour the trio discussed
the forthcoming trial of the unfortunate Philip O. Ketchim.Then Ames
dismissed the clergyman, and bade his office boy admit the young
lawyer, Cass, who had come in response to Hood's request.For some moments after Cass entered the office Ames stood regarding
him, studying what manner of man he was, and how best to approach him.Then he opened the conversation by a casual reference to the
unsatisfactory business situation which obtained throughout the
country, and expressed wonder that young men just starting in their
professions managed to make ends meet."But," he concluded with deep significance, "better go hungry than
take on any class of business which, though promising good money
returns, nevertheless might eventually prove suicidal."He looked hard
at the young lawyer when he paused."But as I am
particularly busy this morning, may I ask why you have sent for me?Have you anything that I can--"

"I have," abruptly interrupted the financier."We need additions to
our legal staff.I thought perhaps you might like to talk over the
matter with me, with a view to entering our employ."Ames, I--I have never thought of--" The young man's eyes
glistened."Well, suppose you think of it now," said Ames, smiling graciously."I
have heard considerable about you of late, and I must say I rather
like the way you have been handling your work."The work which he had been
doing of late was most ordinary and routine, and called for no display
of legal skill whatever."I'd hate to see you tackle anything at this stage of your career, Mr.And I am afraid your
association with Ketchim is going to do just that.But possibly you do
not intend to handle further business for him?"Ketchim, though long confined in the Tombs, had at length secured
bail, through the not wholly disinterested efforts of his uncle,
Stolz, the sworn enemy of Ames.And, because of his loyal efforts in
behalf of Ketchim, Stolz had insisted that Cass be retained as counsel
for the latter when his trial should come up."I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr.Hood
will take you on at a salary of, say, five thousand to start with.We'll try you out for a few weeks.Then, if we don't mutually fit,
why, we'll quietly separate and say nothing.Half of that salary would have looked large to him
then.But--

"May I ask," he slowly said in reply, "what class of work Mr.Hood
would give me to start with?""Why, nothing of great importance, perhaps, while you are getting into
the harness.You've had experience
in that, eh?"That little house
which he had passed and stopped to look at so wistfully every night on
his way home was now within his grasp.He glanced up at the great man, sitting so calmly before him.Ames," he said, "if I enter your employ, it must be with the
stipulation that I shall have nothing to do with the Ketchim trial.""If you enter my employ, sir, it will
be with the stipulation that you do as I say," he returned coldly.And then the young lawyer saw through the mask.And his anger flamed
high at what he discerned behind it.Ames," said he, "you have made a mistake.I am poor, and I need
business.But I have not as yet fallen so completely under the spell
of fortune-hunting as to sell my honor to a man like you!To enter
your employ, I now see, would mean the total loss of character and
self respect.It would mean a lowering of my ideals, whatever they may
be, to your own vulgar standard.I may have done wrong in becoming
associated with Mr.But I
pledged myself to assist him.And yet, in doing so, I scarcely can
blacken my reputation to the extent that I should were I to become
your legal henchman.But there are some terms upon
which even I can not accept it.Ames gave a snort of anger when Cass went out.Summoning Hood, he
vented his great wrath upon that individual's bald pate."And now," he
concluded, "I want that fellow Cass so wound up that he will sneak off
to a lonely spot and commit suicide!And if you can't do it, then I'll
accept your resignation!"Ames, I have
just learned that Judge Harris, father of the young man who came up
with that girl, is in Colombia.Seems that he's taken some wealthy man
down there to look at La Libertad mine.""They believe you put one over on Ketchim, with the help of Monsignor
Lafelle, and so they've gone down to get titles to that mine.""By G--"

"And they say that--"

"Never mind what they say!""Cable Wenceslas at once to
see that those fellows remain permanently in Colombia.He has ways of
accomplishing that.I guess
Wenceslas can block his little game!"His great frame shook slightly as he stood consuming with rage, and a
slight hemorrhage started from his nostrils.And as he walked, Hood thought his left foot dragged
slightly.*       *       *       *       *

And then, with the way well cleared, came the Ketchim trial, which has
gone down in history as containing the most spectacular _denouement_
in the record of legal procedure in the New World.Had it been
concerned, as was anticipated, only with routine legal procedure
against the man Ketchim, a weak-souled compound of feeble sycophancy
and low morals, it would have attracted slight attention, and would
have been spread upon the court records by uninterested clerks with
never a second thought.But there were elements entering into it of
whose existence the outside world could not have even dreamed.Into it
converged threads which now may be traced back to scenes and events in
three continents; threads whose intricate windings led through
trackless forest and dim-lit church; through court of fashion and hut
of poverty; back through the dark mazes of mortal thought, where no
light shines upon the carnal aims and aspirations of the human mind;
back even to the doors of a palace itself, even to the proudest throne
of the Old World.But none of these elements found expression in the indictment against
the frightened defendant, the small-visioned man who had sought to
imitate the mighty Ames, and yet who lacked sufficient intelligence of
that sort which manifests in such a perversion of skill and power.Ames was a tremendous corruptionist, who stood beyond the laws simply
because of the elemental fact that he himself made those laws.Ketchim
was a plain deceiver.Mingling
his theology with fraud, he employed the unholy alliance for the
purpose of exploiting the credulous who attended his prayer meetings
and commented with bated breath upon his beautiful showing of
religious zeal.He was but one of a multitude afflicted with the
"dollar mania."His misfortune was that his methods were so antique
that they could not long fail of detection.And it was because of his
use of the mails for the purpose of deceit that the indictment had
been drawn against Philip O. Ketchim _et al._ by the long-suffering,
tolerant complainant, called the people.Nominally the people's interests were in the hands of the Public
Prosecutor, a certain smug young worldling named Ellis.But, as that
gentleman owed his appointment to Ames, it is not surprising that at
his right hand sat Hood and his well trained staff.Nominally, too,
Judge Spencer conducted the trial strictly upon its merits, not all of
which lay with the people.But the judge might have been still
prosecuting petty cases back in the unknown little district from
which he came, had it not been for the great influence of Ames, long
since, who had found him on a certain occasion useful.And so the jury
panel contained none but those who, we may be very sure, were amenable
to the tender pressure of a soft hand lined with yellow gold.And only
those points of evidence were sustained which conduced to the
incrimination of the miserable defendant.Ketchim was doomed before
the trial began.And yet, to subserve the dark schemes of Ames, and to lengthen the
period of torture to which his victims should be subjected, the trial
was dragged through many days.Besides, even he and his hirelings were
bound to observe the formalities.It was at the suggestion of Cass that no effort had been made to
procure bail for Carmen after her arrest.The dramatic may always be
relied upon to carry a point which even plain evidence negatives.And
she, acquiescing in the suggestion, remained a full two weeks in the
Tombs before Ames's eager counsel found their opportunity to confront
her on the witness stand and besmirch her with their black charges.The Beaubien was prostrated.But, knowing that for her another hour of
humiliation and sorrow had come, she strove mightily to summon her
strength for its advent.Father Waite toiled with Cass day and night.Hitt and Haynerd, without financial resources, pursued their way, grim
and silent.And
they stood at the helm, stanch to their principles, not yielding an
iota to offers of assistance in exchange for a reversal of the policy
upon which the paper had been launched."We're going down, Hitt," said Haynerd grimly."But we go with the
flag flying at the mast!"He was learning to know as did Carmen, and to
see with eyes which were invisible.It was just when the jury had been impaneled, after long days of petty
wrangling and childish recrimination among the opposing lawyers, that
Stolz came to Ames and laid down his sword.The control of C. and R.
should pass unequivocally to the latter if he would but save Ketchim
from prison.Then Ames lay back and roared with laughter over his great triumph.He would send Stolz' nephew to prison, and then roll a
bomb along Wall Street whose detonation would startle the financial
world clean out of its orbit!Stolz had failed to notice that Ames's
schemes had so signally worked out that C. and R. was practically in
his hands now!The defeated railroad magnate at length backed out of
the Ames office purple with rage.And then he pledged himself to
hypothecate his entire fortune to the rescue of his worthless nephew.Thus, in deep iniquity, was launched the famous trial, a process of
justice in name only, serving as an outlet for a single man's long
nurtured personal animosities.The adulterous union of religion and
business was only nominally before the bar.The victims, not the
defendant only, not the preachers, the washerwomen, the factory girls,
the widows, and the orphans, whose life savings Ketchim had drawn into
his net by the lure of pious benedictions, but rather those
unfortunates who had chanced to incur the malicious hatred of the
great, legalized malefactor, Ames, by opposition to his selfish
caprice, and whose utter defeat and discrediting before the public
would now place the crown of righteous expediency upon his own
chicanery and extortion and his wantonly murderous deeds.Doctor Jurges, utterly
confused by the keen lawyers, and vainly endeavoring to follow the
dictates of his conscience, while attempting to reconcile them with
his many talks with Darius Borwell, gave testimony which fell little
short of incriminating himself.For there were produced letters which
he had written to members of his congregation, and which for subtlety
and deception, though doubtless innocently done, would have made a
seasoned promoter look sharp to his own laurels.He had been summoned from Denver for the
trial.But his stuttering evidence gave no advantage to either side.And then--crowning blunder!--Cass permitted Ketchim himself to take
the stand.And the frightened, trembling broker gave his own cause
such a blow that the prosecution might well have asked the judge to
take the case from the jury then and there.It was a legal _faux pas_;
and Cass walked the floor and moaned the whole night through.Then, as per program, the prosecution called Madam Beaubien.Could not
that sorrowing woman have given testimony which would have aided the
tottering defense, and unmasked the evil genius which presided over
this mock trial?But not one point would the
judge sustain when it bordered upon forbidden territory.It was made
plain to her that she was there to testify against Ketchim, and to
permit the Ames lawyers to bandy her own name about the court room
upon the sharp points of their cruel cross-questions and low
insinuations.But, she protested, her knowledge of the Simiti company's affairs had
come through another person.Ames should give his own testimony--for was it not he who
had, not long since, legally punished the witness on a charge of
defamation of character?And the spectators
knew that it was because the righteous prosecution could no longer
stain its hands with one who bore such a tarnished name as she.And then, taunted and goaded to exasperation, the wronged woman burst
into tears and flayed the bigamist Ames there before the court room
crowded with eager society ladies and curious, non-toiling men.Flayed
him as men are seldom flayed and excoriated by the women they trample.The bailiffs seized her, and dragged her into an ante-room; the judge
broke his gavel rapping for order, and threatened to clear the court;
and then Cass, too young and inexperienced to avoid battle with
seasoned warriors, rose and demanded that Madam Beaubien be returned
to the stand.He turned to
the people, as if seeking their support.A great murmur arose through
the court room.That man, sitting calm
and unimpassioned, nodded his head slightly.And the woman was led
back to the chair."It may have an important bearing upon the case, Your Honor!"cried
the young lawyer for the defense.Ames is to take the stand as an
important witness in this case.If Madam Beaubien brings such a charge
against him, it gives us reason to believe his honor peccable, and his
testimony open to suspicion!"It was a daring statement, and the whole room gasped, and held its
breath."The
lawyer for the defense is in contempt of court!Madam Beaubien has
been shown to be a--"

"The objection is sustained!"_"His first wife's portrait--is in a glass window--in his yacht!"_
cried the hysterical Beaubien.Then she crumpled up in a limp mass,
and was led from the chair half fainting.At the woman's shrill words a white-haired man, dressed in black,
clerical garb, who had been sitting in the rear of the room close to
the door, rose hastily, then slowly sat down again.At his feet
reposed a satchel, bearing several foreign labels.Evidently he had
but just arrived from distant lands.Consternation reigned throughout the room for a few minutes.Then
Cass, believing that the psychological moment had arrived, loudly
called Carmen Ariza to the stand.The dramatic play must be continued,
now that it had begun.The battle which had raged back and forth for
long, weary days, could be won, if at all, only by playing upon the
emotions of the jury, for the evidence thus far given had resulted in
showing not only the defense, but likewise the Beaubien, and all who
had been associated with the Simiti company, including Cass himself,
to be participators in gross, intentional fraud.The remaining witness, the girl herself, had been purposely neglected
by the prosecution, for the great Ames had planned that she must be
called by the defense.Then would he bring up the prostitute, Jude,
and from her wring testimony which must blast forever the girl's
already soiled name.Following her, he would himself take the stand,
and tell of the girl's visits to his office; of her protestations of
love for him; of her embracing him; and of a thousand indiscretions
which he had carefully garnered and stored for this triumphant
occasion.But the judge, visibly perturbed by the dramatic turn which the case
seemed to be taking, studied his watch for a moment, then Ames's face,
and then abruptly adjourned court until the following day.Yet not
until Cass had been recognized, and the hounded girl summoned from her
cell in the Tombs, to take the stand in the morning for--her life!CHAPTER 17


In the days to come, when the divine leaven which is in the world
to-day shall have brought more of the carnal mind's iniquity to the
surface, that the Sun of Truth may destroy the foul germs, there shall
be old men and women, and they which, looking up from their work, peep
and mutter of strange things long gone, who shall fall wonderingly
silent when they have told again of the fair young girl who walked
alone into the crowded court room that cold winter's morning.And
their stories will vary with the telling, for no two might agree what
manner of being it was that came into their midst that day.Even the bailiffs, as if moved by some strange prescience, had fallen
back and allowed her to enter alone.The buzz of subdued chatter
ceased, and a great silence came over all as they looked.Some swore,
in awed whispers, when the dramatic day had ended, and judge and jury
and wrangling lawyer had silently, and with bowed heads, gone quiet
and thoughtful each to his home, that a nimbus encircled her beautiful
head when she came through the door and faced the gaping multitude.Some said that her eyes were raised; that she saw not earthly things;
and that a heavenly presence moved beside her.Nor may we lightly set
aside these tales; for, after the curtain had fallen upon the
wonderful scene about to be enacted, there was not one present who
would deny that, as the girl came into the great room and went
directly to the witness chair, God himself walked at her side and held
her hand."Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou
dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
goest."Through the mind of that same white-haired man in the clerical garb
ran these words as he watched the girl move silently across the room.She seemed to have taken on a new meaning to him since the previous
day.And as he looked, his eyes grew moist, and he drew out his
handkerchief.But his were not the only eyes that had filled then.Hitt and Haynerd
bent their heads, that the people might not see; Miss Wall and the
Beaubien wept silently, and with no attempt to stay their grief; Jude
buried her head in her hands, and rocked back and forth, moaning
softly.A welter of conflicting emotions
surged through their harassed souls.They seemed to have come now to
the great crisis.And which way the tide would turn rested with this
lone girl.For some moments after she was seated the silence remained unbroken.And as she sat there, waiting, she looked down at the man who sought
to destroy what he might not possess.Some said afterward that as she
looked at him she smiled.Who knows but that the Christ himself smiled
down from the cross at those who had riven his great heart?He was far
from well that morning, and an ugly, murderous mood possessed him.And
yet, judged by the world's standards, he had tipped the crest of
success.He was swollen
with wealth, with material power, with abnormal pride.His tender
sensibilities and sympathies were happily completely ossified, and he
was stone deaf and blind to the agonies of a suffering world.Not a
single aim but had been realized; not a lone ambition but had been
met.Even the armed camp at Avon, and the little wooden crosses over
the fresh mounds there, all testified to his omnipotence; and in them,
despite their horrors, he felt a satisfying sense of his own great
might.The clerk held up the Bible for the girl to give her oath.She looked
at him for a moment, and then smiled."I will tell the truth," she
said simply.The officer hesitated, and looked up at the judge.But the latter sat
with his eyes fixed upon the girl.The clerk did not press the point;
and Carmen was delivered into the hands of the lawyers.Then, yielding to a sudden
impulse, he asked the girl to mention briefly the place of her birth,
her parentage, and other statistical data, leading up to her
association with the defendant.It was but the one she had
told again and again.And when
she had concluded, Cass turned her back again to Simiti, and to
Rosendo's share in the mining project which had ultimated in this
suit.A far-away look came into the girl's eyes as she spoke of that great,
black man who had taken her from desolate Badillo into his own warm
heart.There were few dry eyes among the spectators when she told of
his selfless love.And when she drew the portrait of him, standing
alone in the cold mountain water, far up in the jungle of Guamoco,
bending over the laden _batea_, and toiling day by day in those
ghastly solitudes, that she might be protected and educated and raised
above her primitive environment in Simiti, there were sobs heard
throughout the room; and even the judge, hardened though he was by
conflict with the human mind, removed his glasses and loudly cleared
his throat as he wiped them.Ames first grew weary as he listened, and then exasperated.His lawyer
at length rose to object to the recital on the ground that it was
largely irrelevant to the case.And the judge, pulling himself
together, sustained the objection.Then the prosecution
eagerly took up the cross-examination."Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
bring forth," murmured the white-haired man in the clerical garb far
back in the crowded room.Had he learned the law of Truth to error,
"Thou shall surely die"?Did he discern the vultures gnawing at the
rich man's vitals?Did he, too, know that this giant of privilege, so
insolently flaunting his fleeting power, his blood-stained wealth and
his mortal pride, might as well seek to dim the sun in heaven as to
escape the working of those infinite divine laws which shall effect
the destruction of evil and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven
even here upon earth?The latter drew Ellis down and
transmitted his master's instructions.The atmosphere grew tense, and
the hush of expectancy lay over all."Miss Carmen," began Ellis easily, "your parentage has been a matter
of some dispute, if I mistake not, and--"

Cass was on his feet to object.What had this question to do with the
issue?Cass should have divined it by this time.Ellis cleared his throat and adjusted his glasses."And your
father, it is said, was a <DW64> priest.I believe that has been
accepted for some time."I never knew my earthly father," replied Carmen in a low voice."But you have admitted that it might have been this Diego, have you
not?""It might have been," returned the girl, looking off absently toward
the high windows."Did he not claim you as his daughter?""Now," continued Ellis, "that being reasonably settled, is it not also
true that you used the claim of possessing this mine, La Libertad, as
a pretext for admission to society here in New York?"The girl did not answer, but only smiled pityingly at him.He, too,
had bartered his soul; and in her heart there rose a great sympathy
for him in his awful mesmerism."And that you claimed to be an Inca princess?"admonished the judge, looking severely down upon the silent
girl.Carmen sighed, and drew her gaze away from the windows.She was weary,
oh, so weary of this unspeakable mockery.And yet she was there to
prove her God."I would like to ask this further question," Ellis resumed, without
waiting for her reply."Were you not at one time in a resort conducted
by Madam Cazeau, down on--"

He stopped short.The girl's eyes were looking straight into his, and
they seemed to have pierced his soul."I am sorry for you," she said
gently, "oh, so sorry!The man knew not whether to smile in triumph or hide his head in
shame.Ames alone
met his embarrassed glance, and sent back a command to continue the
attack.What possible relation to the
issue involved could such testimony have?But the judge bade him sit
down, as the counsel for the prosecution doubtless was bringing out
facts of greatest importance.Ellis again cleared his throat and bent to his loathsome task."Now,
Miss Ariza, in reference to your labors to incite the mill hands at
Avon to deeds of violence, the public considers that as part of a
consistent line of attack upon Mr.Ames, in which you were aiding
others from whom you took your orders.May I ask you to cite the
motives upon which you acted?"Ames," she slowly replied, "but only the
things he stands for."A militant brand of social uplift, I
suppose?"And that is the sort of remedy that anarchists apply to
industrial troubles, is it not?""There is no remedy for industrial troubles but Christianity," she
said gently."Not the burlesque Christianity of our countless sects
and churches; not Roman Catholicism; not Protestantism; nor any of the
fads and fancies of the human mind; but just the Christianity of Jesus
of Nazareth, who knew that the human man was not God's image, but only
stood for it in the mortal consciousness.And he always saw behind
this counterfeit the real man, the true likeness of God.And--"

"You are diverging from the subject proper and consuming time, Miss
Ariza!"Carmen did not heed him, but continued quietly:

"And it was just such a man that Jesus portrayed in his daily walk and
words.""No," the girl went calmly on, "Jesus did not stand for the
intolerance, the ignorance, the bigotry, the hatred, and the human
hypothesis, the fraud, and chicanery, and the 'Who shall be greatest?'Nor did he make evil a reality, as mortals do.He knew it seemed awfully real to the deceived human consciousness;
but he told that consciousness to be not afraid.And then he went to
work and drove out the belief of evil on the basis of its nothingness
and its total lack of principle.The orthodox churches and sects of
to-day do not do that.Their
kingdom is wholly temporal, and is upheld by heartless millionaires,
and by warlike kings and emperors.Their tenets shame the intelligence
of thinking men!Yet they have slain tens of millions to establish
them!"To remove the girl meant depriving Ames of
his prey.But if she remained upon the stand, she would put them all
to confusion, for they had no means of silencing her.The judge looked
blankly at Ames; his hands were tied.Ellis hurried to change the current of her talk by interposing another
question."Will you tell us, Miss Carmen, why you have been working--"

"I have been working for God," she interrupted.Her voice was low and
steady, and her eyes shone with a light that men are not wont to see
in those of their neighbors.And for Him I am here to-day."Consternation was plainly discernible in the camp of the prosecution.Cass knew now that he need make no more objections.The defense had
passed from his hands.At this juncture James Ketchim, brother of the defendant, thinking to
relieve the strain and embarrassment, gave audible voice to one of his
wonted witticisms.But the effect was not
what he had anticipated.roared the exasperated judge, bending
far over his desk.And the elder
Ketchim retired in chagrin and confusion."Miss Carmen," pursued Ellis, eager to recover his advantage, for he
saw significant movements among the jury, "do you not think the
unfortunate results at Avon quite prove that you have allied yourself
with those who oppose the nation's industrial progress?"Order had now been restored in the court room, and
Ellis was feeling sure of himself again."You have opposed the constructive development of our country's
resources by your assaults upon men of wealth, like Mr.Ames, for
example, have you not?"Then the girl opened her mouth, and from it came words that fell upon
the room like masses of lead."I stand opposed to any man, Mr.Ellis,
who, to enrich himself, and for the purpose of revenge, spreads the
boll weevil in the cotton fields of the South."And yet it was a silence that
fell crashing upon Ames's straining ears.He sat for a moment stunned;
then sprang to his feet.He held out a
hand, and made as if to speak; then sank again into his chair.Ellis collected himself, and turned to the judge."Your Honor, we regret to state that, from the replies which Miss
Ariza has given, we do not consider her mentally competent as a
witness."I should
like to examine the witness further!"returned the judge, glowering over his spectacles
at the young lawyer."I stand on--"

"Sit down!"called Cass through the rising tumult, "the lawyer for
the prosecution has heaped insults upon you in his low references to
your parentage.Will you--"

The judge pounded upon his desk with the remnant of his broken gavel.he called in a loud, threatening
voice.The judge sat down and mopped his steaming face.Ames was a study of
wild, infuriated passion.Carmen
sat quietly facing the crowded room.She had reached up and was
fondling the little locket which hung at her throat.It was the first
time she had ever worn it.It was not a pretty piece of jewelry; and
it had never occurred to her to wear it until that day.Nor would she
have thought of it then, had not the Beaubien brought it to the Tombs
the night before in a little box with some papers which the girl had
called for.Why she had put it on, she could not say.Slowly, while the silence continued unbroken, the girl drew the
slender chain around in front of her and unclasped it."I--I never--knew my parents," she murmured musingly, looking down
lovingly at the little locket.Then she opened it and sat gazing, rapt
and absorbed, at the two little portraits within."But there are their
pictures," she suddenly announced, holding the locket out to Cass.It was said afterward that never in the history of legal procedure in
New York had that court room held such dead silence as when Cass stood
bending over the faces of the girl's earthly parents, portrayed in the
strange little locket which Rosendo had taken from Badillo years
before.Never had it known such a tense moment; never had the very air
itself seemed so filled with a mighty, unseen presence, as on that day
and in that crisal hour.Without speaking, Hood rose and looked over Cass's shoulder at the
locket.A muffled cry escaped him, and he turned and stared at Ames."Yes, sir," replied Hood in a voice that was scarcely heard.Hood seemed to have frozen to the spot.His hands shook, and his words
gibbered from his trembling lips."The--the woman's portrait, sir--is--is--the one in--in Mr."_

The piercing cry rang through the still room like a lost soul's
despairing wail.Ames had rushed from his seat, overturning his chair,
thrusting the lawyers aside, and seized the locket.For a moment he
peered wildly into it.It seemed as if his eyes would devour it,
absorb it, push themselves clean through it, in their eagerness to
grasp its meaning.His eyes were red; his face ashen; his lips white.His unsteady glance met the girl's.His mouth opened, and flapped like
a broken shutter in the wind.His arms swung wildly upward; then
dropped heavily.Suddenly he bent to one side; caught himself;
straightened up; and then, with a horrifying, gurgling moan, crashed
to the floor.The noise of the tremendous fall reverberated through
the great room like an echo of Satan's plunge into the pit of hell.They rushed forward in a mass, over railings, over chairs
and tables, heedless of all but the great mystery that was slowly
clearing away in the dim light that winter's morning.Through them the
white-haired man, clad in clerical vestments, elbowed his way to the
bar.He tore it from Hood's hand and scanned it eagerly.he murmured, trembling with
excitement.Then, shouting to the judge above the hubbub:

"Your Honor!called the judge in a loud, quavering voice.The woman's
portrait in this little locket is that of Dona Dolores, Infanta,
daughter of Queen Isabella the Second, of Spain!And this girl,"
pointing to the bewildered Carmen, who sat clinging to the arms of her
chair, "is her child, and is a princess of the royal blood!Her father
is the man who lies there--J. Wilton Ames!"CHAPTER 18


Borne on pulsing electric waves, the news of the great _denouement_
flashed over the city, and across a startled continent.Beneath the
seas it sped, and into court and hovel.Madrid gasped; Seville panted;
and old Padre Rafael de Rincon raised his hoary head and cackled
shrilly.To the seething court room came flying reporters and news gatherers,
who threw themselves despairingly against the closed portals.Within,
the bailiffs fought with the excited crowd, and held the doors against
the panic without.Over the prostrate form of Ames the physicians worked with feverish
energy, but shook their heads.In the adjoining ante-room, whither she had been half carried, half
dragged by Hitt when Ames fell, sat Carmen, clasped in the Beaubien's
arms, stunned, bewildered, and speechless.Hitt stood guard at the
door; and Miss Wall and Jude tiptoed about with bated breath, unable
to take their eyes from the girl.In the court room without, Haynerd held the little locket, and plied
Monsignor Lafelle with his incoherent questions.The excited editor's
brain was afire; but of one thing he was well assured, the Express
would bring out an extra that night that would scoop its rivals clean
to the bone!In a few minutes the bailiffs fought the mob back from the doors and
admitted a man, a photographer, who had been sent out to procure
chemicals in the hope that the portrait of the man in the locket might
be cleaned.Ten minutes later the features of J. Wilton Ames stood
forth clearly beside those of the wife of his youth.The picture
showed him younger in appearance, to be sure, but the likeness was
unmistakable.Monsignor, but you are slow!wailed Haynerd, shaking the
churchman's arm in his excitement."I saw the portrait in the Royal
Gallery, years ago, in Madrid.I could not forget the
sad, sweet face.I saw it again in the stained-glass window in the
Ames yacht.There was much whispering, much shaking of heads, but little
information.But this I know: the queen, the great Isabella, had a
lover, a wonderful tenor, Marfori, Marquis de Loja.And one day a babe
was taken quietly to a little cottage in the Granada hills.Rumor said
that it was an Infanta, and that the tenor was its father.One man, perhaps: old Rafael de Rincon.But Rome suddenly recalled
him from Isabella's court, and after that he was very quiet."Ames," he said, "traveled much in
Europe.He bought a vineyard in Granada--the
one from which he still procures his wine.And there--who knows?--he
met the Infanta.But probably neither he nor she guessed her royal
birth.""Well, they eloped--who knows?Whether married or not, I can not say.But it is evident she went with him to Colombia, where, perhaps, he
was seeking a concession from Congress in Bogota.Then came the news of his father's sudden death.Possibly he bade her wait for his return.But a
prospective mother is often excitable.She waited a day, a week--who
knows how long?she was wild
to do such a thing.She died at the little
riverine town of Badillo, after her babe, Carmen, was born."A heritage from her grandfather, the tenor, Marfori," Lafelle
suggested."But--the portraits--what is the name under that of Ames?"Yes, for Guillermo in Spanish is William.Doubtless Ames told her his
name was Will, contracted from Wilton, the name he went by in his
youth.And the nearest the Spanish could come to it was Guillermo.Diego's name was Guillermo Diego Polo.And after he had seen that name
in the locket he used it as a further means of strengthening his claim
upon the girl.""Then--she is--a--princess!""Yes, doubtless, if my reasoning is correct.Not an Inca princess, but
a princess of the reigning house of Spain."Haynerd could hold himself no longer, but rushed madly from the room
and tore across town to the office of the Express.Then came the white-enameled ambulance, dashing and careening to the
doors of the building where Ames lay so quiet.Gently, silently, the
great body was lifted and borne below.And then the chattering,
gesticulating mob poured from the court room, from the halls and
corridors, and out into the chill sunlight of the streets, where they
formed anew into little groups, and went over again the dramatic
events but a few minutes past.Then, too, emerged Carmen, heavily veiled from the curious, vulgar
gaze of the rabble, and entered the waiting limousine, with the
Beaubien and Hitt.Miss Wall and the gasping Jude followed in another.The judge had bidden the girl go on her own recognizance.The arrest
at Avon; the matter of bail; all had merged into the excitement of the
hour and been forgotten.Ketchim went out on Cass's arm.The judge had
ordered the clerk to enter an adjournment.*       *       *       *       *

All that afternoon and far into the night a gaping, wondering
concourse braved the cold and stood about the walk that led up to the
little Beaubien cottage.Within, the curtains were drawn, and Sidney,
Jude, and Miss Wall answered the calls that came incessantly over the
telephone and to the doors.Sidney had not been in the court room, for
Haynerd had left him at the editor's desk in his own absence.But with
the return of Haynerd the lad had hurried into a taxicab and commanded
the chauffeur to drive madly to the Beaubien home.And once through
the door, he clasped the beautiful girl in his arms and strained her
to his breast."My own, my very own little sister!We only
pretended before, didn't we?But now--now, oh, God above!The scarce comprehending girl drew his head down and kissed him."Sidney," she murmured, "the ways of God are past finding out!"Aye, for again, as of old, He had chosen the foolish things of the
world to confound the wise; He had chosen the weak to confound the
mighty; and the base things, and the things despised, had He used to
bring to naught the things that are.That no flesh might
glory in His terrible presence!The girl smiled up at him; then turned away.she kept repeating, groping her way about
the room as if in a haze.The still dazed Beaubien drew the girl into her arms.Yet I
called you that from the very first.And he--that
man--your father!"It--"

Then the Beaubien's heart almost stopped.What,
then, would this sudden turn in the girl's life mean to the lone woman
who clung to her so?"No, mother dearest," whispered Carmen, looking up through her tears."For even if it should be true, I will not leave you.He--he--"

She stopped; and would speak of him no more.But neither of them knew as yet that in that marvelous Fifth Avenue
palace, behind those drawn curtains and guarded bronze doors, at which
an eager crowd stood staring, Ames, the superman, lay dying, his left
side, from the shoulder down, paralyzed.*       *       *       *       *

In the holy quiet of the first hours of morning, the mist rose, and
the fallen man roused slowly out of his deep stupor.And then through
the dim-lit halls of the great mansion rang a piercing cry.For when
he awoke, the curtain stood raised upon his life; and the sight of its
ghastly content struck wild terror to his naked soul.He had dreamed as he lay there, dreamed while the mist was rising.He
thought he had been toiling with feverish energy through those black
hours, building a wall about the things that were his.And into the
design of the huge structure he had fitted the trophies of his
conquest.Gannette toiled with him, straining, sweating, groaning.Together they reared that monstrous wall; and as they labored, the man
plotted the death of his companion when the work should be done, lest
he ask for pay.And into the corners of the wall they fitted little
skulls.These were the children of Avon who had never played.And over
the great stones which they heaved into place they sketched red
dollar-marks; and their paint was human blood.A soft wind swept over
the rising structure, and it bore a gentle voice: "I am Love."But the
toilers looked up and cursed.And over the rim of the wall looked fair faces."We are
Truth, we are Life!"But the men frothed with fury, and hurled skulls
at the faces, and bade them begone!A youth and a tender girl looked
down at the sweating toilers."We ask help; we are young, and times
are so hard!"And then the darkness settled down,
for the wall was now so high that it shut out the sun.And the great
man howled with laughter; the wall was done.So he turned and smote
his companion unto death, and dipped his hands in the warm blood of
the quivering corpse.And then he sought to
mount the wall.But his hands slipped on the human blood of the red,
slimy dollar-marks, and he fell crashing back among his tinkling
treasures.The naked, splitting skulls
leered at him.The toothless jaws clattered, and the eyeless sockets
glowed eerily.He begged that a rope be
lowered.He would go out once more into the sunlit world.But the
chill wind brought him only despairing moans.Then he rushed madly to the wall, and smote it with his bare hands.It
mocked him with the strength which he had given it.He turned and tore
his hair and flesh.He gnashed his teeth until they broke into bits.He cursed; he raved; he pleaded; he offered all his great treasure for
freedom.But the skulls grinned their horrid mockery at him; and the
blood on the stones dripped upon his burning head.And above it all he
heard the low plotting of those without who were awaiting his death,
that they might throw down the wall and take away his treasure.And then his fear became frenzy; his love of gold turned to horror;
his reason fled; and he dashed himself wildly against the prison which
he had reared, until he fell, bleeding and broken.And as he fell, he
heard the shrill cackle of demons that danced their hellish steps on
the top of the wall.Then the Furies flew down and bound him tight."Ah, my God, What might I not have made of Thy fair world Had I
  but loved Thy highest creature here?It was my duty to have loved
  the highest; It surely was my profit had I known."Then he
sought to raise his arms, to move.And then the scream
tore from his dry throat.The physicians bent over him and
sought to soothe his mental agony.The man's torture was fearful to
behold; his weakness, pitiable.But the
sleep was one of unbroken horror; and those in the room stopped in the
course of their duties; and their faces blanched; and they held their
hands to their ears, when his awful moans echoed through the curtained
room.Through his dreams raced the endless panorama of his crowded life.Now
he was wading through muddy slums where stood the wretched houses
which he rented for immoral purposes.And then he hurried to Avon; and there he dug into those fresh
graves--dug, dug, dug, throwing the dirt up in great heaps behind him.And into the face of each corpse as he dragged it out of its damp bed
he peered eagerly.But with awful moans he threw them from him in
turn, for she was not there.Then he fled down, down, far into the burning South; and there he
roamed the trackless wastes, calling her name.And the wild beasts and
the hissing serpents looked out at him from the thick bush, looked
with great, red eyes, and then fled from him with loathing.And,
suddenly, he came upon another mound near the banks of a great river.And over it stood a rude cross; and on the cross he read the dim,
penciled word, _Dolores_.how he cried out for the oblivion
that was not his.But the ghastly mound froze his blood, and he rushed
from it in terror, and fell, whirling over and over, down, down into
eternal blackness filled with dying men's groans!The exhausted attendants stood about
the bed with bated breath.The physicians had called Doctor Morton in
consultation, for the latter was a brain specialist.And while they
sat gazing at the crazed, stricken giant, hopelessly struggling to
lift the inert mass of his dead body, Reverend Darius Borwell entered.He bowed silently to them all; then went to the bedside and took the
patient's hand.A moment later he turned to the physicians and
nurses."Let us ask God's help for Mr.They bowed, and he knelt beside the bed and prayed long and earnestly;
prayed that the loving Father who had made man in His image would take
pity on the suffering one who lay there, and, if it be His will, spare
him for Jesus' sake.He arose from his knees, and they all sat quiet for some moments.Then
Doctor Morton's heavy voice broke the silence of death.Borwell,"
he said in awful earnestness, extending his hand toward the bed, "cure
that man, if your religion is anything more than a name!"A hot flush of indignation spread over the minister's face; but he did
not reply."Gentlemen," he said solemnly, "Mr.Ames, I think, is past our aid.There is nothing on earth that can save him.If he lives, he will be
hopelessly insane.""Upstairs, sir, in her apartments," answered the maid, wiping her red
eyes."See that she remains there," said the doctor gruffly."Gentlemen,"
turning again to the physicians, "I have but one suggestion.Send
for--for--that little girl, Carmen.""It is ill-advised, Doctor," interrupted one of the men."It would
only further excite him."I do not agree with you," returned Doctor Morton."As it is, he is
doomed.With her here--there may be a chance."The others shook their heads; but Doctor Morton persisted stubbornly."If she is sent for, I shall
retire from the case.""Very well," announced Doctor Morton evenly, "then I will take it
myself."He rose and went out into the vestibule where there was a
telephone.Calling for the Beaubien cottage, he gave a peremptory
order that Carmen come at once in the automobile which he was sending
for her.The Beaubien turned from the telephone to the girl."Why--is it--is he--"

"They say he is--dying," the woman whispered.Carmen stood for a minute as if stunned."Why--I--didn't know--that
there was--anything wrong.The Beaubien threw her arms around the girl.Father Waite rose from
the table where he had been writing, and came to them.A few minutes later the great bronze doors of the Ames mansion swung
wide to admit the daughter of the house.Doctor Morton met the wondering girl, and led her directly into the
sick-room."Miss Carmen," he said gravely, "Mr.The girl turned upon him like a flash from a clear sky."You mean, he
_shall_ not live!"Then a sense of her
magnificent environment, of her strange position, and of the vivid
events of the past few hours swept over her, and she became
embarrassed.The nurses and attendants, too, who stood about and
stared so hard at her, added to her confusion."Listen," he said, "I am leaving now,
but you will remain.If I am needed, one of the maids will summon
me."Carmen stood for a moment without speaking.Then she walked slowly to
the bed and looked down at the man.Doctor Morton motioned to the
attendants to withdraw.Then he himself stepped softly out and closed
the door.When the girl turned around, she was alone--with death.CHAPTER 19


A curious, gossiping world, dwelling only in the froth of the human
mind, will not comprehend for many a year to come what took place in
that dim, tapestried chamber of the rich man in those next hours.When
twilight began to steal through the marble halls of the great,
shrouded mansion, the nurse in charge, becoming apprehensive, softly
opened the door of the sick-room and peeped in.Through the darkness
she saw the girl, sitting beside the bed, with the man's right hand
clasped in both of hers, and her head resting upon his shoulder.And
the nurse quickly closed the door again in awe, and stole away.The girl sat there all that day and all that night, nor would leave
but for brief moments to eat, or to reassure the Beaubien over the
telephone that all was well.Doctor Morton came, and went, and came
again.Carmen smiled, and held his hand for a moment each time, but
said little.And, more, his cheeks were stained where
the scalding tears had coursed down them.But the doctor would ask no
questions.And three days and nights passed thus, while Carmen dwelt with the man
who, as the incarnation of error, seeking the destruction of others,
had destroyed himself.Then Doctor Morton announced to a waiting world that his patient would
live--but he would say no more.And the world heard, too, that
Kathleen Ames had left her father's roof--left in humiliation and
chagrin when she learned that Carmen had come there to live--and had
gone to England for a prolonged visit with the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her now thoroughly dismayed son.But Sidney came; and with
him the black-veiled Beaubien.And they both knelt beside the bed of
suffering; and the hand of the now quiet man slowly went out and lay
for a moment upon their bowed heads, while Carmen stood near.Then
Willett was sent for; and he came often after that, and took his
master's scarce audible instructions, and went away again to touch the
wires and keys that ended the war of hatred at Avon; that brought
Father Danny in the master's private car to the great metropolitan
hospital; that sent to the startled Hitt the canceled mortgage papers
on the Express; and that inaugurated that great work of restitution
which held the dwellers in the Ames mansion toiling over musty books
and forgotten records for months to come.What had passed between the man and the sweet-faced girl who hovered
over him like a ray of light, no one may know.That he had trod the
glowing embers of hell, his cavernous, deep-lined face and whitening
hair well testified.It was said afterward that on that third day he
had opened his eyes and looked straight into those of the girl.It was
said that she then whispered but one word, "Father."And that, when
the sound of her low voice fell upon his straining ears, he had
reached out the arm that still held life, and had drawn her head down
upon his breast, and wept like a motherless babe.But what he had
said, if aught, about the abandoned mother who, on the banks of the
distant river, years gone, had yielded her life to him and his child,
no one knew.Of but one thing was there any certainty: the name of
Padre Jose de Rincon had not crossed their lips during those dark
days.Then strong men lifted the giant from his bed
and placed him in a wheel chair; and Carmen drew the chair out into
the conservatory, among the ferns and flowers, and sat beside him, his
hand still clasped in both of hers.That he had found life, no one who
marked his tense, eager look, which in every waking moment lay upon
the girl, could deny.His body was dead; his soul was fluttering
feebly into a new sense of being.But with the awakening of conscience, in the birth-throes of a new
life, came the horrors, the tortures, the wild frenzy of self-loathing;
and, but for the girl who clung so desperately to him, he would have
quickly ended his useless existence.The stage upon which the curtain had risen,
whereon he saw the hourly portrayal of his own fiendish deeds, stood
always before him like a haunting spectre; and as he gazed with
horrified eyes, his hair grew hourly white.And the torture was rendered more poignant by the demands of his
erstwhile associates and henchmen.They had taken fright at the first
orders which had issued from the sick-bed, but now they swooped down
upon the harassed man to learn what might be expected from him in the
future.What were to be his policies now in regard to those manifold
interests which he was pursuing with such vigor a few weeks ago?Was
he still bent upon depriving Senator Gossitch of the seat which the
Ames money had purchased?The
Amalgamated Spinners' Association must know at once his further plans.His great railroad projects, his
mining ventures, his cotton deals, his speculations and gambling
schemes--whither should they tend now?Ward bosses, dive keepers,
bank presidents, lawyers, magnates, and preachers clamored for
admission at his doors when they learned that he would live, but that
a marvelous, incomprehensible change had swept over him.The tired, hectored man turned to Carmen.And she called Hitt and
Waite and the keen-minded Beaubien.The latter's wide business
experience and worldly knowledge now stood them all in good stead, and
she threw herself like a bulwark between the stricken man and the
hounds that roared at his gates.There were those among them who, like
Ames, had bitterly fought all efforts at industrial and social reform,
and yet who saw the dawning of a new era in the realms of finance, of
politics, of religion.There were those who sensed the slow awakening
of the world-conscience, and who resisted it desperately, and who now
sat frightened and angered at the thought of losing their great
leader.Their attitude toward life, like his, had been wrong from the
beginning; they, like him, were striking examples of the dire effects
of a false viewpoint in the impoverishing of human life.But, with
him, they had built up a tremendous material fabric.And now they
shook with fear as they saw its chief support removed.For they must
know that his was a type that was fast passing, and after it must come
the complete breakdown of the old financial order.His world-embracing
gambling--which touched all men in some way, for it had to do with the
very necessities of life, with crops, with railroads, with industries,
and out of which he had coined untold millions--had ceased forever.And to him also came Reverend Darius Borwell, in whose congregation
sat sanctimonious malefactors of vast wealth, whose pockets bulged
with disease-laden profits from the sales of women's bodies and souls.Reverend Borwell came to offer the sufferer the dubious consolations
of religion--and inquire if his beautiful change of heart would affect
the benefaction which he had designed for the new church.Ah, this was the hour when the fallen giant faced the Apostle's awful
question: What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed?_For the end of those things is death!_

And then came Monsignor Lafelle, asking not to see the sick man, but
the girl.And, alone with her in the great library that day, he bent
low over her hand and begged that she would forgive and forget.Ames that flagrantly false tale of the girl's
parentage.He had received it from Wenceslas, in Cartagena.It was he
who, surmising the dark secret of Ames, had concluded that the
supposed Infanta had been his wife.And he had returned to New York
to confront him with the charge, and to make great capital out of it.But he had never suspected for a moment Carmen's connection with the
mystery.And now--

But the girl saw only the image of God in the humiliated man.And when
he kissed her hand and departed, she bade him know, always, that she
loved him as a brother.And he knew it, knew that her love was of the
spirit--it left all for the Christ.A few days later there was delivered at the Ames mansion a cable
message from Cartagena, in reply to one which the master had sent to
the lawyer, Estrella.Ames shook with suppressed excitement when he
read it.Then he bade Carmen send at once for Hitt, Willett, and
Captain McCall, and leave them with him for a private conference.Ames repeated, as the three
men sat leaning eagerly forward an hour later, drinking in every word
he spoke."If the mission is successful, well and good.If it fails,
then our silence now will be justified, for as yet I have said nothing
to her regarding him.Wenceslas has
won--but with--but of that later.When can you get under way,
McCall?"The sudden flash of his old-time energy nearly startled them
from their chairs."And," he added, "you, Mr.Now, Willett, have the door of my limousine widened to accommodate
this wheel chair.I want a dozen men to insure our privacy, and to
keep the way clear.No one not in our confidence must see us depart.""But--Carmen--"

"Goes with us," returned Ames."I can not spare her for a moment.Madam Beaubien will have charge of the house during our absence.We
will be back here, weather favorable, in three weeks--or not at all!""Yet, she will know--"

"Nothing.I take the trip, ostensibly, for the change; to get away
from those who are hounding me here; for recuperation--anything!The man's eyes glistened like live coals, and
his sunken cheeks took on a feverish glow.That night the _Cossack_, enveloped in gloom, steamed noiselessly out
of New York harbor, and turned her prow to the South.And when she
had entered the high sea, Captain McCall from his bridge aloft sent a
message down to the waiting engineer:

"Full speed ahead!"CHAPTER 20


Cartagena's slumber of centuries had been broken by nearly four years
of civil warfare.But on the day that the lookout in the abandoned
convent of Santa Candelaria, on the summit of La Popa, flashed the
message down into the old city that a steam yacht had appeared on the
northern horizon, she was preparing to sink back again into quiet
dreams.For peace was being concluded among the warring political
factions.The country lay devastated and blood-soaked; but the cause
of Christ had triumphed, and the Church still sat supreme in the
councils of Bogota.Cartagena was _en fete_; the last of the political
agitators would be executed on the morrow.And so the lookout's
message was received with indifference, even though he embellished it
with the comment that the boat must be privately owned, as no ships of
the regular lines were due to arrive that day.Quietly the graceful craft swept down past Tierra Bomba and into the
Boca Chica, between the ancient forts of San Fernando and San Jose,
and came to anchor out in the beautiful harbor, a half mile from the
ancient gate of the clock.A few curious idlers along the shore
watched it and commented on its perfect lines.And the numerous
officials of the port lazily craned their necks at it, and yawningly
awaited the arrival of the skiff that was immediately lowered and
headed for the pier.The tall American who stepped from the little boat and came at once to
them to show his papers, easily satisfied their curiosity, for many
tourists of the millionaire class dropped anchor in Cartagena's
wonderful harbor, and came ashore to wander among the decaying
mementos of her glorious past.And this boat was not a stranger to
these waters.On the yacht itself, as they glanced again toward it,
there was no sign of life.Even the diminishing volume of smoke that
rose from its funnels evidenced the owner's intention of spending some
time in that romantic spot.From the dock, Hitt passed through the old gateway in the massive
wall, quickly crossed the _Plaza de Coches_, and lost himself in the
gay throngs that were entering upon the day's festivities.Occasionally he dropped into wine shops and little stores, and
lingered about to catch stray bits of gossip.Then he slowly made his
way up past the Cathedral and into the _Plaza de Simon Bolivar_.For a while, sitting on a bench in front of the equestrian statue of
the famous _Libertador_, he watched the passing crowds.From time to
time his glance strayed over toward the Cathedral.Once he rose, and
started in that direction; then came back and resumed his seat.It was
evident that he was driven hard, and yet knew not just what course to
pursue.Finally he jumped to his feet and went over to a little cigar store
which had caught his eye.He bent over the soiled glass case and
selected several cigars from the shabby stock.Putting one of them
into his mouth, he lighted it, and then casually nodded to a
powerfully built man standing near.The latter turned to the proprietor and made some comment in Spanish.Hitt immediately replied to it in the same tongue.The man flushed
with embarrassment; then doffed his hat and offered an apology."I
forget, senor," he said, "that so many Americans speak our language."Hitt held out his hand and laughed heartily at the incident.Then his
eye was attracted by a chain which the man wore."_Cierto_, _senor_," returned the man cordially."It came from an
Indian grave up in Guamoco.I am a _guaquero_--grave digger--by
profession; Jorge Costal, by name."Somehow he seemed to be familiar with that
name.Somewhere he seemed to have heard it."Suppose," he said, in his excellent Spanish, "that we cross
the _Plaza_ to yonder wine shop.You may be able to tell me some of
the history of this interesting old town.And--it would be a great
favor, senor."The man bowed courteously and accepted the invitation.A few moments
later they sat at a little table, with a bottle between them,
commenting on the animated scene in the street without."Peace will be concluded to-day, they say," reflected Hitt, by way of
introduction."Yes," returned the man grimly, "there is but little more blood to
let."The other is--"

He stopped and eyed Hitt furtively.But the American manifested only a
casual interest."They were posted this morning," said the man."Amado Jesus Fanor and
Jose de Rincon.""A liberal general and an ex-priest."It is the custom to--to shoot ex-priests down
here, eh?"But this man--senor, why do you ask?""Well--it struck me as curious--that's all," returned Hitt, at a loss
for a suitable answer."You didn't happen to know these men, I
presume?""_Na_, _senor_, you seek to involve me.Who are you, that you ask such
questions of a stranger?"The man reflected the suspicious caution of
these troublous times."Why, _amigo_, it is of no concern to me," replied Hitt easily,
flicking the ashes from his cigar."I once knew a fellow by that name.Learned that he afterward went to Simiti.But
I--"

"Senor!""Are you the _Americano_, the man
who explored?""I am," said Hitt, bending closer to him."And we are well met, for
you are Don Jorge, who knew Padre Jose de Rincon in Simiti, no?"The man cast a timid glance around the room."Senor," he whispered,
"we must not say these things here!I leave you now--"

"Not yet!"He was first three years in the prison in Cartagena.But the Bish--"

"Eh?Don Wenceslas had him removed to San Fernando?""And--"

"He will be shot to-morrow, senor.""Why do you
say he is an ex-priest?""He has just been excommunicated," replied the man."Cursed, they say,
by bell, book, and candle."Of course Don Wenceslas would not dare to execute a priest in
good standing.And so he had him excommunicated, eh?""_Quien sabe?_" he muttered.Hitt sat for a while in a deep study.And yet it
was flying like the winds."You knew a little girl--in Simiti--in whom this Rincon was
interested?"She went to the great States
from which you come.And I think little was heard from her after
that."She lived with--"

"Don Rosendo Ariza.""Dead--he and his good wife, Dona Maria.""Come," he said, "we will stroll down by the walls.I would
like a look at San Fernando."Senor, you--you--"

Hitt threw him a look of caution, and shook his head.Then, motioning
him to follow, he led him out and down through the winding, tortuous
thoroughfares.On the summit of the walls were sentinels, posted at
frequent intervals; and no civilian might walk upon the great
enclosure until peace had been formally declared.Hailing a passing carriage, Hitt urged the wondering Don Jorge into
it, and bade the driver convey them to the old ruin of San Felipe, and
leave them.There they climbed the broken incline into the battered
fortress, and seated themselves in the shadow of a crumbling parapet.They were alone on the enormous, grass-grown pile.From their position
they commanded a wonderful view across the town and harbor, and far
out over the green waters of the Caribbean.The _Cossack_ lay asleep
in the quiet harbor.Don Jorge saw it, and wondered whence it came."Listen, _amigo_," began Hitt, pointing to the yacht."In that boat is
a girl, whose dearest earthly treasure is the condemned prisoner out
there in San Fernando.That girl is the little Carmen, foster-daughter
of old Rosendo.""_Hombre!_" cried Don Jorge, staring at Hitt as if he suspected his
sanity."It is true, friend, for I myself came with her in that boat.""_Caramba!_"

"And," continued Hitt, glancing again about the ruined fortress and
lowering his voice, "we have come for Jose de Rincon.""_Santa Virgen!_ Are you _loco_?""And now," he went on eagerly, "how are we to get him?"And he--_por
supuesto_, he will be in the dungeons!""No doubt," returned Hitt dryly, "if your excellent friend Wenceslas
has had anything to do with it."_Caramba_, yes; and San Fernando's are just above the water's edge.And when the waves are high the sea pours into them!""And--could we learn which window is his, do you think?""Senor, I know," replied the man.And--"

"I learned from one of the soldiers, Fernando, who once lived in
Simiti.I had thought, senor, that--that perhaps I--"

"That perhaps you might make the attempt yourself, eh?"Hitt sprang to his feet and looked out toward the
silent fortress."Don Jorge, it is dark out over the harbor at night, eh?Suddenly he stopped, and stood
looking down through a hole in the broken pavement.Then he knelt and
peered long and eagerly into it."It is one of the rooms
of the fortress," he said.I know not how it may be
reached.""But--you are a mighty husky fellow; and I am not weak.Suppose we try
lifting one of these flags.""_Na_, _senor_, as well try the tunnels!But, bidding Don Jorge follow, he sought the
fallen entrance to the old fortress, and plunged into the dark passage
that led off from it into the thick gloom.Groping his way down a
long, damp corridor, he came to a point where three narrower,
brick-lined tunnels branched off, one of them dipping into the earth
at a sharp angle.He struck a match, and then started down this,
followed by the wondering Don Jorge.A thousand bats, hideous denizens of these black tunnels, flouted
their faces and disputed their progress.Don Jorge slapped wildly at
them, and cursed low.Hitt took up a long club and struck savagely
about him.On they stumbled, until the match flickered out, and they
were left in Stygian blackness, with the imps of darkness whirring
madly about them.Hitt struck another match, and plunged ahead.At length they found the way blocked by a mass of rubbish which had
fallen from the roof.Hitt studied it for a moment, then climbed upon
it and, by the aid of the feeble light from his matches, peered into
the foul blackness beyond."Come," he said, preparing to proceed."_Na, amigo!_ Not I!""Then wait for me here," said Hitt, pushing himself through the narrow
aperture at the top of the rubbish, and fighting the horde of
terrified bats.A few minutes later he returned, covered with slime, and scratched and
bleeding."Now let's get out of this
miserable hole!"Out in the sunlight once more, Hitt sought to remove the stains from
his clothes, meanwhile bidding Don Jorge attend well to his words."Then do you come to the beach to-night to bathe, down across from the
yacht.And, listen well: you would do much for the little Carmen, no?You will swim out to the yacht at
seven to-night, with your clothes in a bundle on your head, eh?And,
Don Jorge--but we will discuss that later.Now you go back to the city
alone.And, note this, you have not seen me."Meantime, to the group of politicians, soldiers, and clergy assembled
in the long audience room of the departmental offices to debate the
terms of the peace protocol, news of the arrival of the _Cossack_ was
brought by a slow-moving messenger from the dock.At the abrupt
announcement the acting-Bishop was seen to start from his chair._Quien sabe?_ And, if so--but,
impossible!He would have advised his faithful co-laborer of his
coming.And yet, what were those strange rumors which had trickled
over the wires, and which, in his absorption in the local issues, and
in the excitement attendant upon the restoration of peace and the
settlement of the multifold claims of innumerable greedy politicians,
he had all but forgotten?A thousand suggestions flashed through his
mind, any one of which might account for the presence of the _Cossack_
in Cartagena's harbor that day.But extreme caution must be observed
until he might ascertain its errand.He therefore despatched a message
to the yacht, expressing his great surprise and pleasure, and bidding
its master meet him at a convenient hour in his study in the
Cathedral.This done, he bent anew to the work before him, yet with
his thought harried by doubt, suspicion, and torturing curiosity.Wenceslas soon received a reply to his message.The master was aboard,
but unable to go ashore.The acting-Bishop would therefore come to him
at once.Wenceslas hesitated, and his brow furrowed.He knew he was called upon
to render his reckoning to the great financier who had furnished the
sinews of war.But he must have time to consider thoroughly his own
advantage, for well he understood that he was summoned to match his
own keen wits with those of a master mind.And then there flashed through his thought the reports which had
circled the world but three short weeks before.The man of wealth had
found his daughter; and she was the girl for whom the two Americans
had outwitted him four years ago!And the girl--Simiti--and--ah,
Rincon!He would meet the financier--but
not until the morrow, at noon, for, he would allege, the unanticipated
arrival of Ames had found this day completely occupied.So he again
despatched his wondering messenger to the _Cossack_.And that
messenger was rowed out to the quiet yacht in the same boat with the
tall American, whose clothes were torn and caked with mud, and in
whose eyes there glowed a fierce determination.The harbingers of the wet season had
already arrived.At two in the morning the rain came, descending in a
torrent.In the midst of it a light skiff, rocking dangerously on the
swelling sea, rounded a corner of San Fernando and crept like a shadow
along the dull gray wall.The sentry above had taken shelter from the
driving rain.At one of the narrow, grated windows which were set just above the
water's surface the skiff hung, and a long form arose from its depths
and grasped the iron bars.A moment later the gleam of an electric
lantern flashed into the blackness within.It fell upon a rough bench,
standing in foul, slime-covered water.Upon the bench sat the huddled
form of a man.Then another dark shape rose in the skiff.Another pair of hands laid
hold on the iron bars.And behind those great, calloused hands
stretched thick arms, with the strength of an ox.An iron lever was
inserted between the bars.The heavy breathing and the low sounds of
the straining were drowned by the tropic storm.The prisoner leaped
from the bench and stood ankle-deep in the water, straining his eyes
upward.His
throbbing ears caught the splash of a knotted rope falling into the
water at his feet.Above the noise of the rain he thought he heard a
groaning, creaking sound.Those rusted, storm-eaten bars in the
blackness above must be slowly yielding to an awful pressure.He
turned and dragged the slime-covered bench to the window, and stood
upon it.Then he grasped the rope with a strength born anew of hope
and excitement, and pulled himself upward.The hands from without
seized him; and slowly, painfully, his emaciated body was crushed
through the narrow space between the bent bars.*       *       *       *       *

Cartagena awoke to experience another thrill.And then the ripple of
excitement gave place to anger.The rabble had lost one of its
victims, and that one the chief.Moreover, the presence of that
graceful yacht, sleeping so quietly out there in the sunlit harbor,
could not but be associated with that most daring deed of the
preceding night, which had given liberty to the excommunicated priest
and political malefactor, Jose de Rincon.Crowds of chattering,
gesticulating citizens gathered along the harbor shores, and loudly
voiced their disappointment and threats.But the boat lay like a thing
asleep.Not even a wisp of smoke rose from its yellow funnels.Then came the Alcalde, and the Departmental Governor, grave and
sedate, with their aids and secretaries, their books and documents,
their mandates and red-sealed processes, and were rowed out to
confront the master whom they believed to have dared to thwart the
hand of justice and remain to taunt them with his egregious presence.This should be made an international episode, whose ramifications
would wind down through years to come, and embrace long, stupid
congressional debates, apologies demanded, huge sums to salve a
wounded nation, and the making and breaking of politicians too
numerous to mention!But the giant who received them, bound to his chair, in the splendid
library of the palatial yacht, and with no attendant, save a single
valet, flared out in a towering rage at the gross insult offered him
and his great country in these black charges.He had come on a
peaceful errand; partly, too, for reasons of health.And he was at
that moment awaiting a visit from His Grace.What manner of reception
was this, that Cartagena extended to an influential representative of
the powerful States of the North!"But," the discomfited Indignation Committee gasped, "what of the tall
American who was seen to land the day before?"Why, but a poor, obsessed
archaeologist, now prowling around the ruins of San Felipe, doubtless
mumbling childishly as he <DW8>s the dust and mold of centuries!Go,
visit him, if they would be convinced!And when these had gone, chagrined and mortified--though filled
with wonder, for they had roamed the _Cossack_, and peered into
its every nook and cranny, and stopped to look a second time at the
fair-haired young boy who looked like a girl, and hovered close to
the master--came His Grace, Wenceslas.He came alone, and with a sneer
curling his imperious lips.And his calm, arrogant eyes held a
meaning that boded no good to the man who sat in his wheel chair,
alone, and could not rise to welcome him."A very pretty trick, my powerful friend," said the angered churchman
in his perfect English."And one that will cause your Government at
Washington some--"

"Enough!""I sent for you
yesterday, intending to ask you to release the man.I had terms then
which would have advantaged you greatly.You were afraid to see me
until you had evolved your plans of opposition.Only a fixed and
devilish hatred, nourished by you against a harmless priest who
possessed your secrets, doomed him to die to-day.But we will pass
that for the present.I have here my demands for the aid I have
furnished you.He held out some typewritten
sheets to Wenceslas.The churchman glanced hastily over them; then handed them back with a
smile."The terms on which
peace is concluded will scarcely admit of--"

"Very well," returned Ames quietly."_En manos muertas_, my friend," he replied.A government monopoly, you know," said His Grace easily."You see, my friend, it is a costly matter to effect the escape of
state prisoners.As things stand now, your little trick of last night
quite protects me.For, first you instruct me, long ago, to place the
weak little Jose in San Fernando; and I obey.Then you suffer a change
of heart, and slip down here to release the man, who has become a
state prisoner.That quite removes you from any claims upon us for a
share of the spoils of war.I take it, you do not wish to risk
exposure of your part in this four years' carnage?""Wenceslas," he
said, "I am not the man with whom you dealt in these matters.I have but one thing more to say, and that is that I renounce
all claims upon you and your Government, excepting one.La Libertad
mine was owned by the Rincon family.It was rediscovered by old
Rosendo, and the title transferred to his foster-daughter.Its
possession must remain with her and her associates.There is no
record, so you have informed me, to the effect that the Church
possesses this mine.""But, my friend, there shall be such a record to-day," laughed
Wenceslas."And, in your present situation, you will hardly care to
contest it."He now had the information which he had been seeking.The
title to the famous mine lay still with the Simiti company.He pressed
the call-button attached to his chair.The door opened, and Don Jorge
entered, leading the erstwhile little newsboy, Jose de Rincon, by the
hand.He knew not the man; but the boy
was a familiar figure."Your Grace, were you married to the woman by whom you had this son?"Don Jorge's steady words fell upon the churchman's ears like a
sentence of death."I ask," continued the dark-faced man, "because I learned last night
that the lad's mother was my daughter, the little Maria.""_Santa Virgen!_"

"Yes, Your Grace, a sainted virgin, despoiled by a devil!And the man
who gave me this information--would you like to know?_Bien_, it was
Padre Jose de Rincon, in whose arms she died, you lecherous dog!"Wenceslas paled, and his brow grew moist.He stared at the boy, and
then at the strong man whom he had so foully wronged."If you have concluded your talk with Senor Ames," continued Don
Jorge, "we will go ashore--you and the lad and I."Gaining the deck, Wenceslas
found a skiff awaiting them, and two strong sailors at the oars.Don
Jorge urged him on, and together they descended the ladder and entered
the boat.A few moments later they landed at the pier, and the skiff
turned back to the yacht.There were some who
remembered seeing His Grace pass through the narrow streets with a
dark-skinned, powerful man, whose hand grasped that of the young
newsboy.There were others who said that they saw the boy leave them
at the Cathedral, and the two men turn and enter.Still others said
they saw the heavy-set man come out alone.But there was only one who
discovered the body of Wenceslas, crumpled up in a hideous heap upon
the floor of his study, with a poignard driven clean through his
heart.That man was the old sexton, who fled screaming from the awful
sight late that afternoon.Again Cartagena shook with excitement, and seethed with mystery.Had
the escaped prisoner, Rincon, returned to commit this awful deed?For the dark-skinned man who had
entered the Cathedral with His Grace was seen again on the streets and
in the wine shops that afternoon, and had been marked by some mounting
the broken incline of San Felipe.Again the Governor and Alcalde and their numerous suite paid a visit
to the master on board the _Cossack_.But they learned only that His
Grace had gone ashore long before he met his fearful death.And so the
Governor returned to the city, and was driven to San Felipe.But his
only reward was the sight of the obsessed archaeologist, mud-stained
and absorbed, prying about the old ruins, and uttering little cries of
delight at new discoveries of crumbling passageways and caving rooms.And so there was nothing for the disturbed town to do but settle down
and ponder the strange case.A week later smoke was seen again pouring out of the _Cossack's_
funnels.That same day the Governor and Alcalde and their suites were
bidden to a farewell banquet on board the luxurious yacht.Far into
the night they sat over their rare wines and rich food, drinking deep
healths to the _entente cordial_ which existed between the little
republic of the South and the great one of the North.And while they
drank and sang and listened enraptured to the wonderful pipe-organ, a
little boat put out from the dark, tangled shrubbery along the shore.And when it rubbed against the yacht, a muffled figure mounted the
ladder which hung in the shadows, and hastened through the rear
hatchway and down into the depths of the boat.Then, long after
midnight, the last farewell being said by the dizzy officials, and the
echoes of _Adios_, _adios_, _amigos_!lingering among its tall spars,
the _Cossack_ slipped noiselessly out of the Boca Chica, and set its
course for New York.A few hours later, while the boat sped swiftly through the phosphorescent
waves, the escaped prisoner, Jose de Rincon, who had lain for a week
hidden in the bowels of old fort San Felipe, stood alone in the wonderful
smoking room of the _Cossack_, and looked up at the sweet face pictured
in the stained-glass window above.And then he turned quickly, for the
door opened and a girl entered.A rush, a cry of joy, and his arms
closed about the fair vision that had sat by his side constantly during
the four long years of his imprisonment."I knew you would, for he was with you always!""But--oh, you beautiful, beautiful girl!"Then in a little while she gently released herself and went to the
door through which she had entered.She paused for a moment to smile
back at the enraptured man, then turned and flung the door wide.The man uttered a loud
exclamation and started toward her.He stopped short and stared down at the boy.Then he looked
wonderingly at Carmen."Yes," she said, stooping and lifting the boy up before Jose, "it is
Anita's babe--_and he sees_!"The man clasped the child in his arms and buried his face in its
hair.Verily, upon them that sat in darkness had the Light shined.CHAPTER 21


Another summer had come and gone.Through the trees in Central Park
the afternoon sunlight, sifted and softened by the tinted autumn
leaves, spread over the brown turf like a gossamer web.And it fell
like a gentle benediction upon the massive figure of a man, walking
unsteadily beneath the trees, holding the hand of a young girl whose
beauty made every passer turn and look again."Now, father," laughed the girl, "once more!Why, you step off
like a major!"They were familiar figures, out there in the park, for almost daily
during the past few weeks they might have been seen, as the girl
laughingly said, "practicing their steps."And daily the man's control
became firmer; daily that limp left arm and leg seemed increasingly to
manifest life.On a bench near by sat a dark-featured woman.About her played her
boy, filling the air with his merry shouts and his imperfect English."There, father, comes Jose after us," announced the girl, looking off
with love-lit eyes at an approaching automobile.Now, mind, you are going to get into the car without any help!"The man laughed, and declared vehemently that if he could not get in
alone he would walk home.The profound depth of those changes which had come into the rich
man's life, he himself might not fathom.But those who toiled
daily with him over his great ledgers and files knew that the
transformation went far.There were flashes at times of his former
vigor and spirit of domination, but there were also periods of
grief that were heart-rending to behold, as when, poring over his
records for the name of one whom in years past he had ruthlessly
wrecked, he would find that the victim had gone in poverty beyond
his power to reimburse him.And again, when his thought dwelt on
Avon, and the carnal madness which had filled those new graves there,
he would sink moaning into his chair and bury his drawn face in his
hands and sob.And yet he strove madly, feverishly, to restore again to those from
whom he had taken.The Simiti company was revived, through his labors,
and the great La Libertad restored to its reanimated stockholders.Work of development had begun on the property, and Harris was again in
Colombia in charge of operations.The Express was booming, and the
rich man had consecrated himself to the carrying out of its clean
policies.The mills at Avon were running day and night; and in a new
location, far from the old-time "lungers' alley," long rows of little
cottages were going up for their employes.The lawyer Collins had been
removed, and Lewis Waite was to take his place within a week.Father
Danny, now recovered, rejoiced in resources such as he had never dared
hope to command.And so the rich man toiled--ah, God!if he had only known before that
in the happiness of others lay his own.If only he could have known
that but a moiety of his vast, unused income would have let floods of
sunshine into the lives of those dwarfed, stunted children who toiled
for him, and never played!Oh, if when he closed his mills in the dull
months he had but sent them and their tired mothers to the country
fields, how they would have risen up and called him blessed!If he
could have but known that he was his brother's keeper, and in a sense
that the world as yet knows not!For he is indeed wise who loves his
fellow-men; and he is a fool who hates them!The great Fifth Avenue mansion was dark, except where hung a cluster
of glowing bulbs over the rich mahogany table in the library.There
about that table sat the little group of searchers after God, with
their number augmented now in ways of which they could not have
dreamed.And Hitt, great-souled friend of the world, was speaking
again as had been his wont in the days now gone.Ah, yes, there is a
cure-all; there is a final answer to every ethical question, every
social, industrial, economic problem, the problems of liquor, poverty,
disease, war.And the remedy is so universal that it dissolves even
the tangles of tariff and theology.Ah, my friends, the
girl who came among us to'show the world what love will do' has
taught us by her own rich life--it is love.But not the sex-mesmerism,
the covetousness, the self-love, which mask behind that heavenly name.And to know Him is to receive that marvelous
Christ-principle which unlocks for mankind the door of harmony."No, the world's troubles are not the fault of one man, nor of many,
but of all who seek happiness in things material, and forget that the
real man is the likeness of spirit, and that joy is spiritual.The
trusts, and the men of wealth, are not all malefactors; the churches
are not wholly filled with evil men.But all, yes all, have'missed
the mark' through the belief that matter and evil are real, and must
grope amid sickness, poverty, crime, and death, until they are willing
to turn from such false beliefs, and from self, and seek their own in
the reflection of Him, who is Love, to their fellow-men.It is only as
men join to search for and apply the Christ-principle that they truly
unite to solve the world's sore problems and reveal the waiting
kingdom of harmony, which is always just at hand."In that day all shall know that cause and effect are mental.The man
who hears the tempter, the carnal mind's suggestion to enrich himself
materially at the cost of his brother, will know that it is but the
voice of mesmerism, that'man-killer from the beginning', which bids
him sever himself from his God, who alone is infinite abundance.The
society woman who flits like a gorgeous butterfly about the courts of
fashion, her precious days wasted in motoring, her nights at cards,
and whose vitality goes into dress, and into the watery schemes for
'who shall be greatest' in the dismal realm of the human mind, must
learn, willingly or through suffering, that her activities are but
mesmeric shams that counterfeit the divine activity which manifests in
joy and fullness for all.What is it but the Christ-knowledge, the knowledge of
good, and its correlated knowledge, that evil is only the mesmeric
lie which has engulfed the world?But, oh, the depths of that divine
knowledge!The knowledge which heals the sick, gives sight to the
blind, and opens the prisons to them that are captive!We who are
gathered here to-night, feeling in our midst that great, unseen
Presence which makes for righteousness, know now that 'in my flesh
shall I see God,' for we have indeed already seen and known Him."With them sat the man who, swept by the storms of error and the carnal
winds of destruction, had solved his problem, even as the girl by his
side told him he should, and had been found, when his foul prison
opened, sitting "clothed and in his right mind" at the feet of the
Christ.Jesus "saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit--God--like a
dove descending upon him--immediately the Spirit--carnal belief,
error, the lie--driveth him into the wilderness."And there he was
made to prove God.So Jose de Rincon, when the light had come, years
gone, in desolate Simiti, had been bidden to know the one God, and
none else.But he wavered when the floods of evil rolled over him; he
had looked longingly back; he had clung too tightly to the human
concept that walked with him like a shining light in those dark days.And so she had been taken from him, and he had been hurled into the
wilderness--alone with Him whom he must learn to know if he would see
Life.Then self-consciousness went out, in those four years of his
captivity, and he passed from thence into consciousness of God.Then his great world-knowledge he saw to have been wholly untrue.His
store of truth he saw to have been but relative at best.His knowledge
had rested, he then knew, upon viewpoints which had been utterly
false.And so, like Paul, he died that he might live.He crucified
Self, that he might resurrect the image of God."The world," resumed Hitt, "still worships false gods, though it
reaches out for Truth.Only a
state of consciousness, a consciousness of good, of joy and harmony.And
we are seeking to rid ourselves of the consciousness of evil, with
its sin, its disease and death.But, knowing now that consciousness
is mental activity, the activity of thought, can we not see that
harmony and immortality are within our grasp?Salvation is not from evil realities, but from the
false sense of evil, even as Jesus taught and proved.The only salvation
possible to mankind is in learning to think as Jesus did--not yielding
our mentalities daily to a hodge-podge of mixed thoughts of good and
evil, and then running to doctors and preachers when such yielding
brings its inevitable result in sickness and death.Jesus insisted that
the kingdom of heaven was within men, a tremendous potentiality
within each one of us.By removing hampering
false belief, by removing the limitations of superstition and human
opinion which hold its portals closed.True progress is the release of
mankind from materialism, with its enslaving drudgery, its woes, and
its inevitable death.Mankind's chief difficulty is ignorance of what
God is.He proved Him to be the
creator of the spiritual universe, but not the originator of the lie
of materiality.He showed matter to be but the manifestation of the
false belief that creation is material.He showed it to be but a
sense-impression, without life, without stability, without existence,
except the pseudo-existence which it has in the false thought of
which the human or carnal consciousness is formed.But the lack of
understanding of the real nature of matter, and the persistent belief in
the stability of its so-called laws, has resulted in centuries of
attempts to discredit the Bible records of his spiritual demonstrations
of God's omnipotence and immanence, and so has prevented the human mind
from accepting the proofs which it so eagerly sought.And now, after
nineteen centuries of so-called Christian teaching, the human mind
remains still deeply embedded in matter, and subject to the
consentaneous human beliefs which it calls material laws.Jesus
showed that it was the communal mortal mind, with its false beliefs
in matter, sin, disease, and death, that constituted 'the flesh'; he
showed that mortals are begotten of such false beliefs; he showed
that the material universe is but manifested human belief.And we
know from our own reasoning that we see not things, but our _thoughts_
of things; that we deal not with matter, but with material mental
concepts only.We know that the preachers have woefully missed the
mark, and that the medicines of the doctors have destroyed more lives
than wars and famine, and yet will we not learn of the Master?To reach
God through material thinking is utterly impossible, for He is spirit,
and He can be cognized only by a spiritual consciousness.Yet such a
consciousness is ours, if we will but have it."Ah, friends, God said: Let US make man in OUR image and likeness--let
Life, Love, Spirit make its spiritual reflection.But where is that
man to-day?Buried deep beneath the dogma and the crystallized human
beliefs of mortals--buried beneath 'the lie' which mankind accept
about truth.Nothing but _scientific_ religion will meet humanity's
dire needs and reveal that man.And scientific religion admits of
actual, practical proof.Christianity is as scientific as mathematics,
and quite as capable of demonstration.Its proofs lie in doing the
works of the Master.He is a Christian who does these works; he who
does not is none.Christianity is not a failure, but organized
ecclesiasticism, which always collapses before a world crisis, has
failed utterly.The hideous chicane of imperial government and
imperial religion against mankind has resulted in a Christian veneer,
which cracks at the first test and reveals the unchanged human brute
beneath.The nations which writhe in deadly embrace to-day have never
sought to prove God.They but emphasize the awful fact that the human
mind has no grasp upon the Principle which is God, and at a time of
crisis reverts almost instantly to the primitive, despite so-called
culture and civilization.Yes, religion as a perpetuation of ancient
human conceptions, of materialistic traditions and opinions of 'the
Fathers,' is a flat failure.By it the people of great nations have
been molded into servile submission to church and ruler--have been
persuaded that wretchedness and poverty are eternal--that heaven is a
realm beyond the grave, to which admission is a function of outward
oblation--and that surcease from ills here, or in the life to come, is
a gift of the Church.Can we wonder that commercialism is mistaken by
nations for progress?That king and emperor still call upon God to
bless their barbaric attempts at conquest?And that human existence
remains, what it has always been, a ghastly mockery of Life?"Healing the sick by applied Christianity is not the attempt to alter
a mental concept; it is the bringing out of harmony where before was
discord.He who indulges evil only
proves his belief in its reality and power.Christian healing is not
'mental suggestion,' wherein all thought is material.When evil
thinking is overcome, then the discords which result from it will
disappear from consciousness.Behind all
that the physical senses seem to see, know, and feel, is the spiritual
fact, perfect and eternal.Jesus healed the sick by establishing this
fact in the human consciousness.They must cease from the dust-man,
whose breath is in his nostrils; they must cease from preaching evil
as an awful reality, permitted by God, or existing despite Him; they
must know it as Jesus bade all men know it, as the lie about Truth.Then, by holding the divine ideal before the human mind, they will
cause that mentality gradually to relinquish its false beliefs and
copy the real.And thus, step by step, changing from better to better
beliefs, at length the human mind will have completely substituted
reality for unreality, and will be no more, even in thought.The 'old
man' will have given place to the 'new.'Yes, for the present we reckon with material
symbols; we have not yet fully learned their unreality.But at length,
if we are faithful, we shall lay them aside, and know only Truth and
its pure manifestations."Ah, my friends, how simple is Christianity!It is summed up in the
Sermon on the Mount.He who thinks
right shall know things as they are.He who thinks wrong shall seem to
know them as they are not, and shall pass his days in sore travail,
even in wars, famine, and utter misery.Then why not take up the
demonstration of Christianity in the spirit of joy and freedom from
prejudice with which we pursue our earthly studies, and as gladly,
thankfully seek to prove it?For it, of all things, is worth while.It
alone is the true business of men.For if what we have developed in
our many talks regarding God, man, and the mental nature of the
universe and all things is true, then are the things with which men
now occupy themselves worth while?But are the
things which we have developed true?Yes, for they can be and have
been demonstrated.Carmen has
shown us the way.No, she is not unnatural; she is only divinely
natural.She has shown us what we all may become, if we but will.She
has shown us what we shall be able to do when we are completely lost
in accord with God, and recognize no other life, substance, nor law
than His.But--

"'I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create
evil,' cried the prophet._Truth always has its suppositional
opposite!_ Choose ye then whom ye will serve.Only that which is demonstrably true, not after the change which we
call death, but here this side of the grave, can stand.The only test
of a Christian is in the'signs following.'Without them his faith is
but sterile human belief, and his god but the distorted human concept
whom kings beseech to bless their slaughter."'Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein
  is he to be accounted of?"'His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very
  day his thoughts perish."'That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
  of the Spirit is spirit."'Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though
  we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we
  him no more.'"The fire crackled briskly on the great hearth.Carmen rose and turned
off the light above them.All drew their chairs about the cheery
blaze.Silence, sacred, holy, lay upon them.The rich man, now possessing
treasures beyond his wildest dreams, sat holding his daughter's hand.Sidney had just entered; and Haynerd had
sent word that he would join them soon.Then the silence was broken by the rich man.His voice was unsteady
and low."My friends, sorrow and joy fill my heart to-night.To the first I am
resigned; it is my due; and yet, were it greater, I know not how I
could live.But the joy--who can understand it until he has passed
through death into life!This little girl's mother knew not, nor did
I, that she was royal born.Sometimes I wonder now if it is really so.And yet the evidence is such that I can scarcely doubt.We met in the
sun-kissed hills of Granada; and we loved.Her old nurse was
Argus-eyed; and our meetings were such as only lovers can effect.I
was young, wild, and my blood coursed like a torrent through my veins!But I loved her, yes, base though I was, I loved her.And in these
years since I left her in that little house in Bogota, I have suffered
the agonies of the lost when her memory and my own iniquity fell upon
me and smote me sore--

"We were married in Spain, and the marriage was performed by Padre
Rafael de Rincon.""I was rich; I was roaming the
world, extending my vast business interests; and I took her to
Colombia, where I labored with the politicians in Bogota to grant me
timber and cattle concessions.We had a cottage on the outskirts of
the city, where we were happy.With us lived her faithful old nurse,
whom she would not leave in Spain--

"Then, one day, came a cable message that my father had died.I knew I must return at once to New York.But--I would
not take a wife back with me!And I kissed
her tear-stained face, and bade her wait, for I would return and make
her happy.And then--

"Months later I wrote to her, and, receiving no reply, I caused
inquiry to be made.But she had gone--whither, no one knew.The old
nurse, too, had disappeared.I never learned that a woman had been
left at Badillo to die.She was
timid, and went out seldom.And then--then I thought that a marriage
here would strengthen my position, for I was powerful and proud."Oh, the years that her sad face haunted me!I know
not why, but when the _Cossack_ was built I had her portrait in glass
set in the smoking room.And night after night I have sat before it
and cursed myself, and implored her to forgive!"I was Guillermo to her, and she Dolores to me.Had Carmen ever worn it in my presence I
must have recognized it at once."But," said Ames, choking down his sorrow, "that man is dead.He, like
Goliath, fought Truth, and the Truth fell upon him, crushing him to
powder.The man who remains with you now lives only in this little
girl.And she has brought me my own son, Sidney, and another, Jose.All that I have is theirs, and they will give it to the world.I would
that she could have brought me that noble black man, Rosendo, who laid
down his beautiful life when he saw that his work was done.I learn
from my inquiries that he and Dona Maria lived with Don Nicolas far up
the Boque river during the troublous times when Simiti was burned and
devastated.And that, when the troops had gone, they returned to their
desolated home, and died, within a month of each other.And can my care of their daughter Ana and her little son
ever cancel the debt?"Father, does Jose know that it was Kathleen
whom he rescued from the Tiber in Rome, years ago, and who caused him
to lose his notebook?""No, Sidney,
we had not told him.And how inextricably
bound together we all are!And, Jose, I have not told you that the
woman who lived and died alone in the limestone caves near Honda, and
whose story you had from Don Jorge in Simiti, was doubtless the
faithful old nurse of Dolores.Padre Rafael de Rincon maintained her there."Haynerd entered the room at that moment, and with him came Miss Wall."Now," said Hitt softly, "the circle is complete.Carmen, may I--"

The girl rose at once and went into the music room.Those who remained
sat in awed, expectant silence.Another presence stole softly in, but
they saw him not.Soon through the great rooms and marble halls
drifted the low, weird melody which the girl had sung, long before, in
the dreary Elwin school.In the flickering light of the fire strange shapes took form; and the
shadows that danced on the walls silhouetted scenes from the dimming
past.From out their weird imagery rose a single form.Slowly it rose before them from out the shadows.It was black of face, but its wondrous heart which had cradled the
nameless babe of Badillo glistened like drifting snow.The last sweet notes of the plaintive Indian lament fluttered from the
girl's lips, echoed among the marble pillars, and died away down the
distant corridors.She returned and bent over her father with a tender
caress.Then the great black man in the shadows extended his arms for a moment
above them, and faded from their sight.There was the sound of low
weeping in the room.For

  "these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
  washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
  Lamb."GLOSSARY

eye."Open your chest," she commanded, "and show me the spot where
it's worst.Beulah hesitated only a second, then she obeyed meekly.She had never
seen a meal poultice before, but the heat on her afflicted chest was
grateful to her.Antiphlogistine was only Denver mud anyhow.Meekly,
also, she took the six grains of quinine and the weak dose of jamaica
ginger and water that she was next offered.She felt encouraged and
refreshed enough by this treatment to display some slight curiosity
when the little girl produced a card of villainous looking
safety-pins."I'm going to pin you in with these, Aunt Beulah," she said, "and then
sweat your cold out of you.""Indeed, you're not," Beulah said; "don't be absurd, Eleanor.The
theory of the grip is--," but she was addressing merely the vanishing
hem of cook's voluminous apron.The child returned almost instantly with three objects of assorted
sizes that Beulah could not identify.From the outside they looked
like red flannel and from the way Eleanor handled them it was evident
that they also were hot."I het--heated the flatirons," Eleanor explained, "the way I do for
Grandma, and I'm going to spread 'em around you, after you're pinned
in the blankets, and you got to lie there till you prespire, and
prespire good.""I won't do it," Beulah moaned, "I won't do any such thing."I cured Grandma and Grandpa and Mrs.O'Farrel's aunt that I worked
for, and I'm going to cure you," Eleanor said."Put your arms under those covers," she said, "or I'll dash a glass of
cold water in your face,"--and Beulah obeyed her.Peter nodded wisely when Beulah, cured by these summary though
obsolete methods, told the story in full detail.Gertrude had laughed
until the invalid had enveloped herself in the last few shreds of her
dignity and ordered her out of the room, and the others had been
scarcely more sympathetic."I know that it's funny, Peter," she said, "but you see, I can't help
worrying about it just the same.Of course, as soon as I was up she
was just as respectful and obedient to my slightest wish as she ever
was, but at the time, when she was lording it over me so, she--she
actually slapped me.You never saw such a--blazingly determined little
creature."Peter smiled,--gently, as was Peter's way when any friend of his made
an appeal to him."That's all right, Beulah," he said, "don't you let it disturb you for
an instant.This manifestation had nothing to do with our experiment.Our experiment is working fine--better than I dreamed it would ever
work.What happened to Eleanor, you know, was simply this.Some of the
conditions of her experience were recreated suddenly, and she
reverted."CHAPTER VI

JIMMIE BECOMES A PARENT


The entrance into the dining-room of the curly headed young man and
his pretty little niece, who had a suite on the eighth floor, as the
room clerk informed all inquirers, was always a matter of interest to
the residents of the Hotel Winchester.They were an extremely
picturesque pair to the eye seeking for romance and color.The child
had the pure, clear cut features of the cameo type of New England
maidenhood.She was always dressed in some striking combination of
blue, deep blue like her eyes, with blue hair ribbons.Her
good-looking young relative, with hair almost as near the color of the
sun as her own, seemed to be entirely devoted to her, which,
considering the charm of the child and the radiant and magnetic spirit
of the young man himself, was a delightfully natural manifestation.But one morning near the close of the second week of their stay, the
usual radiation of resilient youth was conspicuously absent from the
young man's demeanor, and the child's face reflected the gloom that
sat so incongruously on the contour of an optimist.The little girl
fumbled her menu card, but the waitress--the usual aging pedagogic
type of the small residential hotel--stood unnoticed at the young
man's elbow for some minutes before he was sufficiently aroused from
his gloomy meditations to address her.When he turned to her at last,
however, it was with the grin that she had grown to associate with
him,--the grin, the absence of which had kept her waiting behind his
chair with a patience that she was, except in a case where her
affections were involved, entirely incapable of.Jimmie's
protestations of inability to make headway with the ladies were not
entirely sincere."Bring me everything on the menu," he said, with a wave of his hand in
the direction of that painstaking pasteboard."Coffee, tea, fruit,
marmalade, breakfast food, ham and eggs.With another wave of the hand he dismissed her."You can't eat it all, Uncle Jimmie," Eleanor protested."I'll make a bet with you," Jimmie declared."I'll bet you a dollar
to a doughnut that if she brings it all, I'll eat it."Uncle Jimmie, you know she won't bring it.You never bet so I can
get the dollar,--you never do.""I never bet so I can get my doughnut, if it comes to that.""I don't know where to buy any doughnuts," Eleanor said; "besides,
Uncle Jimmie, I don't really consider that I owe them.I never really
say that I'm betting, and you tell me I've lost before I've made up my
mind anything about it.""Speaking of doughnuts," Jimmie said, his face still wearing the look
of dejection under a grin worn awry, "can you cook, Eleanor?Can you
roast a steak, and saute baked beans, and stew sausages, and fry out a
breakfast muffin?he suddenly
demanded of the waitress, who was serving him, with an apologetic eye
on the menu, the invariable toast-coffee-and-three-minute-egg
breakfast that he had eaten every morning since his arrival."She looks like a capable one," she
pronounced."I _can_ cook, Uncle Jimmie," Eleanor giggled, "but not the way you
said.You don't roast steak, or--or--"

"Don't you?"Jimmie asked with the expression of pained surprise that
never failed to make his ward wriggle with delight.There were links
in the educational scheme that Jimmie forged better than any of the
cooperative guardians.Not even Jimmie realized the value of the
giggle as a developing factor in Eleanor's existence.He took three
swallows of coffee and frowned into his cup."I can make coffee," he
added.Well, we may as well look the facts in the face,
Eleanor.We're moving away from this elegant hostelry
to-morrow."Apologies to Aunt Beulah (mustn't call you Kiddo) and the
reason is, that I'm broke.I haven't got any money at all, Eleanor,
and I don't know where I am going to get any."But you go to work every morning, Uncle Jimmie?"I go looking for work, but so far no nice
juicy job has come rolling down into my lap.I haven't told you this
before because,--well--when Aunt Beulah comes down every day to give
you your lessons I wanted it to look all O. K. I thought if you didn't
know, you couldn't forget sometime and tell her.""I don't tattle tale," Eleanor said.It's only my doggone pride that makes me
want to keep up the bluff, but you're a game kid,--you--know.I tried
to get you switched off to one of the others till I could get on my
feet, but--no, they just thought I had stage fright.It would be pretty humiliating to me to admit that I couldn't
support one-sixth of a child that I'd given my solemn oath to
be-parent.""Be-parent, if it isn't a word, I invent it.It's awfully tough luck
for you, and if you want me to I'll own up to the crowd that I can't
swing you, but if you are willing to stick, why, we'll fix up some
kind of a way to cut down expenses and bluff it out."Jimmie watched her apparent
hesitation with some dismay."Say the word," he declared, "and I'll tell 'em."I don't want you to tell 'em," Eleanor cried.If you could get me a place, you know, I could go out to
work.You don't eat very much for a man, and I might get my meals
thrown in--"

"Don't, Eleanor, don't," Jimmie agonized."I've got a scheme for us
all right.The day will
come when I can provide you with Pol Roge and diamonds.My father is
rich, you know, but he swore to me that I couldn't support myself, and
I swore to him that I could, and if I don't do it, I'm damned.I am
really, and that isn't swearing.""I know it isn't, when you mean it the way they say in the Bible.""I don't want the crowd to know.I don't want Gertrude to know.She
hasn't got much idea of me anyway.I'll get another job, if I can only
hold out.""I can go to work in a store," Eleanor cried."I can be one of those
little girls in black dresses that runs between counters.""Do you want to break your poor Uncle James' heart, Eleanor,--do
you?"I've borrowed a studio, a large barnlike studio on
Washington Square, suitably equipped with pots and pans and kettles.Also, I am going to borrow the wherewithal to keep us going.It isn't
a bad kind of place if anybody likes it.There's one dinky little
bedroom for you and a cot bed for me, choked in bagdad.If you could
kind of engineer the cooking end of it, with me to do the dirty work,
of course, I think we could be quite snug and cozy.""I know we could, Uncle Jimmie," Eleanor said."Will Uncle Peter come
to see us just the same?"It thus befell that on the fourteenth day of the third month of her
residence in New York, Eleanor descended into Bohemia.Having no least
suspicion of the real state of affairs--for Jimmie, like most
apparently expansive people who are given to rattling nonsense, was
actually very reticent about his own business--the other members of
the sextette did not hesitate to show their chagrin and disapproval at
the change in his manner of living."The Winchester was an ideal place for Eleanor," Beulah wailed."It's
deadly respectable and middle class, but it was just the kind of
atmosphere for her to accustom herself to.She was learning to manage
herself so prettily.This morning when I went to the studio--I wanted
to get the lessons over early, and take Eleanor to see that exhibition
of Bavarian dolls at Kuhner's--I found her washing up a trail of
dishes in that closet behind the screen--you've seen it,
Gertrude?--like some poor little scullery maid.She said that Jimmie
had made an omelet for breakfast.If he'd made fifty omelets there
couldn't have been a greater assortment of dirty dishes and kettles.""Jimmie made an omelet for me once for which he used two dozen eggs.He kept breaking them until he found the yolks of a color to suit him.He said pale yolks made poor omelets, so he threw all the pale ones
away.""I suppose that you sat by and let him," Beulah said."You would let
Jimmie do anything.You're as bad as Margaret is about David.""Or as bad as you are about Peter.""There we go, just like any silly, brainless girls, whose chief object
in life is the--the other sex," Beulah cried inconsistently."So do I--in theory--" Gertrude answered, a little dreamily."Where do
Jimmie and Eleanor get the rest of their meals?""I can't seem to find out," Beulah said."I asked Eleanor point-blank
this morning what they had to eat last night and where they had it,
and she said, 'That's a secret, Aunt Beulah.'When I asked her why it
was a secret and who it was a secret with, she only looked worried,
and said she guessed she wouldn't talk about it at all because that
was the only way to be safe about tattling.You know what I think--I
think Jimmie is taking her around to the cafes and all the shady
extravagant restaurants.He thinks it's sport and it keeps him from
getting bored with the child.""Well, that's one way of educating the young," Gertrude said, "but I
think you are wrong, Beulah."CHAPTER VII

ONE DESCENT INTO BOHEMIA


"Aunt Beulah does not think that Uncle Jimmie is bringing me up
right," Eleanor confided to the pages of her diary."She comes down
here and is very uncomforterble.Well he is bringing me up good, in
some ways better than she did.When he swears he always puts out his
hand for me to slap him.He can't get any
work or earn wages.The advertisement business is on the bum this year
becase times are so hard up.The advertisers have to save their money
and advertising agents are failing right and left.So poor Uncle
Jimmie can't get a place to work at."The people in the other studios are very neighborly.Uncle Jimmie
leaves a sine on the door when he goes out.They don't they come right in and borrow things.Uncle Jimmie says not
to have much to do with them, becase they are so queer, but when I am
not at home, the ladies come to call on him, and drink Moxie or
something.Uncle Jimmie says I shall
not have Behemiar thrust upon me by him, and to keep away from these
ladies until I grow up and then see if I like them.Aunt Beulah thinks
that Uncle Jimmie takes me around to other studios and I won't tell
but he does not take me anywhere except to walk and have ice-cream
soda, but I say I don't want it because of saving the ten cents.We
cook on an old gas stove that smells.I can't do very good
housekeeping becase things are not convenient.I haven't any oven to
do a Saturday baking in, and Uncle Jimmie won't let me do the washing.I should feel more as if I earned my keap if I baked beans and made
boiled dinners and layer cake, but in New York they don't eat much but
hearty food and saluds.It isn't stylish to have cake and pie and
pudding all at one meal.He eats pie for
his breakfast, but if I told anybody they would laugh.If I wrote
Albertina what folks eat in New York she would laugh."Uncle Jimmie is teaching me to like salud.He laughs when I cut up
lettice and put sugar on it.He teaches me to like olives and dried
up sausages and sour crought.He says it is important to be edjucated
in eating, and everytime we go to the Delicate Essenn store to buy
something that will edjucate me better.He teaches me to say 'I beg
your pardon,' and 'Polly vous Fransay?'and to courtesy and how to
enter a room the way you do in private theatricals.He says it isn't
knowing these things so much as knowing when you do them that counts,
and then Aunt Beulah complains that I am not being brought up."I have not seen Uncle Peter for a weak.I would not have to tell him how I was being brought up, and
whether I was hitting the white lights as Uncle Jimmie says.--He would
know."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor did not write Albertina during the time when she was living in
the studio.Some curious inversion of pride kept her silent on the
subject of the change in her life.Albertina would have turned up her
nose at the studio, Eleanor knew.Therefore, she would not so much as
address an envelope to that young lady from an interior which she
would have beheld with scorn.She held long conversations with
Gwendolyn, taking the part of Albertina, on the subject of this
snobbishness of attitude.*       *       *       *       *

"Lots of people in New York have to live in little teny, weeny rooms,
Albertina," she would say.This
studio is so big I get tired dusting all the way round it, and even if
it isn't furnished very much, why, think how much furnishing would
cost, and carpets and gold frames for the pictures!The pictures that
are in here already, without any frames, would sell for hundreds of
dollars apiece if the painter could get anybody to buy them.You ought
to be very thankful for such a place, Albertina, instead of feeling so
stuck up that you pick up your skirts from it."*       *       *       *       *

But Albertina's superiority of mind was impregnable.Her spirit sat in
judgment on all the conditions of Eleanor's new environment.She hated the nicked, dun 
dishes they ate from, and the black bottomed pots and pans that all
the energy of Eleanor's energetic little elbow could not restore to
decency again.She hated the cracked, dun  walls, and the
mottled floor that no amount of sweeping and dusting seemed to make an
impression on.She hated the compromise of housekeeping in an
attic,--she who had been bred in an atmosphere of shining
nickle-plated ranges and linoleum, where even the kitchen pump gleamed
brightly under its annual coat of good green paint.She hated the
compromise, that was the burden of her complaint--either in the person
of Albertina or Gwendolyn, whether she lay in the crook of Eleanor's
arm in the lumpy bed where she reposed at the end of the day's labor,
or whether she sat bolt upright on the lumpy cot in the studio, the
broken bisque arm, which Jimmie insisted on her wearing in a sling
whenever he was present, dangling limply at her side in the relaxation
Eleanor preferred for it.The fact of not having adequate opportunity to keep her house in order
troubled the child, for her days were zealously planned by her
enthusiastic guardians.Beulah came at ten o'clock every morning to
give her lessons.As Jimmie's quest for work grew into a more and more
disheartening adventure, she had difficulty in getting him out of bed
in time to prepare and clear away the breakfast for Beulah's arrival.After lunch, to which Jimmie scrupulously came home, she was supposed
to work an hour at her modeling clay.Gertrude, who was doing very
promising work at the art league, came to the studio twice a week to
give her instruction in handling it.Later in the afternoon one of the
aunts or uncles usually appeared with some scheme to divert her.Margaret was telling her the stories of the Shakespeare plays, and
David was trying to make a card player of her, but was not succeeding
as well as if Albertina had not been brought up a hard shell Baptist,
who thought card playing a device of the devil's.Peter alone did not
come, for even when he was in town he was busy in the afternoon.As soon as her guests were gone, Eleanor hurried through such
housewifely tasks as were possible of accomplishment at that hour, but
the strain was telling on her.Jimmie began to realize this and it
added to his own distress.One night to save her the labor of
preparing the meal, he took her to an Italian restaurant in the
neighborhood where the food was honest and palatable, and the service
at least deft and clean.Eleanor enjoyed the experience extremely, until an incident occurred
which robbed her evening of its sweetness and plunged her into the
purgatory of the child who has inadvertently broken one of its own
laws.Among the belongings in the carpetbag, which was no more--having been
supplanted by a smart little suit-case marked with her initials--was a
certificate from the Massachusetts Total Abstinence Society, duly
signed by herself, and witnessed by the grammar-school teacher and the
secretary of the organization.On this certificate (which was
decorated by many presentations in dim black and white of
mid-Victorian domestic life, and surmounted by a collection of
scalloped clouds in which drifted three amateur looking angels amid a
crowd of more professional cherubim) Eleanor had pledged herself to
abstain from the use as a beverage of all intoxicating drinks, and
from the manufacture or traffic in them.She had also subscribed
herself as willing to make direct and persevering efforts to extend
the principles and blessings of total abstinence."Red ink, Andrea," her Uncle Jimmie had demanded, as the black-eyed
waiter bent over him, "and ginger ale for the offspring."It was fun to be with Uncle Jimmie in a restaurant again.He
always called for something new and unexpected when he spoke of her to
the waiter, and he was always what Albertina would consider "very
comical" when he talked to him."But stay," he added holding up an
admonitory finger, "I think we'll give the little one _eau rougie_
this time.Wouldn't you like _eau rougie_, tinted water, Eleanor, the
way the French children drink it?"Unsuspectingly she sipped the mixture of water and ice and sugar, and
"red ink" from the big brown glass bottle that the glowing waiter set
before them.As the meal progressed Jimmie told her that the grated cheese was
sawdust and almost made her believe it.He showed her how to eat
spaghetti without cutting it and pointed out to her various Italian
examples of his object lesson; but she soon realized that in spite of
his efforts to entertain her, he was really very unhappy."I've borrowed all the money I can, Angelface," he confessed finally.If I don't land that job at the
Perkins agency I'll have to give in and tell Peter and David, or wire
Dad.""You could get some other kind of a job," Eleanor said; "plumbing or
clerking or something."On Cape Cod the plumber and the grocer's clerk
lost no caste because of their calling."I _could_ so demean myself, and I will.I'll be a chauffeur, I can
run a car all right; but the fact remains that by to-morrow
something's got to happen, or I've got to own up to the bunch."She tried hard to think of something to comfort
him but she could not.Jimmie mixed her more _eau rougie_ and she
drank it.He poured a full glass, undiluted, for himself, and held it
up to the light."Well, here's to crime, daughter," he said."Long may it wave, and us
with it.""That isn't really red ink, is it?""It's an awfully pretty
color--like grape juice.""It is grape juice, my child, if we don't inquire too closely into the
matter.The Italians are like the French in the guide book, 'fond of
dancing and light wines.'This is one of the light wines they are fond
of.--Hello, do you feel sick, child?As soon as I can get hold of that sacrificed waiter we'll get
out of here."Eleanor's sickness was of the spirit, but at the moment she was
incapable of telling him so, incapable of any sort of speech.A great
wave of faintness encompassed her.She had
lightly encouraged a departure from the blessings and principles of
total abstinence.That night in her bed she made a long and impassioned apology to her
Maker for the sin of intemperance into which she had been so
unwittingly betrayed.She promised Him that she would never drink
anything that came out of a bottle again.She reviewed sorrowfully her
many arguments with Albertina--Albertina in the flesh that is--on the
subject of bottled drinks in general, and decided that again that
virtuous child was right in her condemnation of any drink, however
harmless in appearance or nomenclature, that bore the stigma of a
bottled label.She knew, however, that something more than a prayer for forgiveness
was required of her.She was pledged to protest against the evil that
she had seemingly countenanced.She could not seek the sleep of the
innocent until that reparation was made.Through the crack of her
sagging door she saw the light from Jimmie's reading lamp and knew
that he was still dressed, or clothed at least, with a sufficient
regard for the conventionalities to permit her intrusion.She rose and
rebraided her hair and tied a daytime ribbon on it.Then she put on
her stockings and her blue Japanese kimono--real Japanese, as Aunt
Beulah explained, made for a Japanese lady of quality--and made her
way into the studio.Jimmie was not sitting in the one comfortable studio chair with his
book under the light and his feet on the bamboo tea table as usual.He was flung on the couch with his face
buried in the cushions, and his shoulders were shaking.Eleanor seeing
him thus, forgot her righteous purpose, forgot her pledge to
disseminate the principles and blessings of abstinence, forgot
everything but the pitiful spectacle of her gallant Uncle Jimmie in
grief.She stood looking down at him without quite the courage to
kneel at his side to give him comfort."Uncle Jimmie," she said, "Uncle Jimmie."At the sound of her voice he put out his hand to her, gropingly, but
he did not uncover his face or shift his position.She found herself
smoothing his hair, gingerly at first, but with more and more
conviction as he snuggled his boyish head closer."I'm awfully discouraged," he said in a weak muffled voice."I'm sorry
you caught me at it, Baby."Eleanor put her face down close to his as he turned it to her."Everything will be all right," she promised him, "everything will be
all right.You'll soon get a job--tomorrow maybe."Then she gathered him close in her angular, tense little arms and held
him there tightly."Everything will be all right," she repeated
soothingly; "now you just put your head here, and have your cry out."CHAPTER VIII

THE TEN HUTCHINSONS


"My Aunt Margaret has a great many people living in her family,"
Eleanor wrote to Albertina from her new address on Morningside
Heights."She has a mother and a father, and two (2) grandparents, one
(1) aunt, one (1) brother, one (1) married lady and the boy of the
lady, I think the married lady is a sister but I do not ask any one,
oh--and another brother, who does not live here only on Saturdays and
Sundays.Aunt Margaret makes ten, and they have a man to wait on the
table.I guess you have read about them in
stories.I am taken right in to be one of the family, and I have a
good time every day now.Aunt Margaret's father is a college teacher,
and Aunt Margaret's grandfather looks like the father of his country.They have a piano here that
plays itself like a sewing machine.They have
after-dinner coffee and gold spoons to it.I guess you would like to
see a gold spoon.They are about the size of the tin spoons we
had in our playhouse.I have a lot of fun with that boy too.At first
I thought he was very affected, but that is just the way they teach
him to talk.He is nine and plays tricks on other people.He dares me
to do things that I don't do, like go down-stairs and steal sugar.If
Aunt Margaret's mother was my grandma I might steal sugar or plum
cake.Remember the time we took your mother's hermits?You would think this house was quite a
grand house.It has three (3) flights of stairs and one basement.I
sleep on the top floor in a dressing room out of Aunt Margaret's only
it isn't a dressing room.Aunt
Margaret is pretty and sings lovely.*       *       *       *       *

In her diary she recorded some of the more intimate facts of her new
existence, such facts as she instinctively guarded from Albertina's
calculating sense.*       *       *       *       *

"Everybody makes fun of me here.I don't care if they do, but I can't
eat so much at the table when every one is laughing at me.They get
me to talking and then they laugh.If I could see anything to laugh
at, I would laugh too.They laugh in a refined way but they laugh.They say to
my face that I am like a merry wilkins story and too good to be true,
and New England projuces lots of real art, and I am art, I can't
remember all the things, but I guess they mean well.Aunt Margaret's
grandfather sits at the head of the table, and talks about things I
never heard of before.He knows the govoner and does not like the way
he parts his hair.I thought all govoners did what they wanted to with
their hairs or anything and people had to like it because (I used to
spell because wrong but I spell better now) they was the govoners, but
it seems not at all.I meant to like
Aunt Beulah the best because she has done the most for me but I am
afrayd I don't.I would not cross my heart and say so.Aunt Margaret
gives me the lessons now.I guess I learn most as much as I learned I
mean was taught of Aunt Beulah.Oh dear sometimes I get descouraged
on account of its being such a funny world and so many diferent people
in it.I was afrayd of the hired
butler, but I am not now."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor had not made a direct change from the Washington Square studio
to the ample house of the Hutchinsons, and it was as well for her that
a change in Jimmie's fortunes had taken her back to the Winchester and
enabled her to accustom herself again to the amenities of gentler
living.Like all sensitive and impressionable children she took on the
color of a new environment very quickly.The strain of her studio
experience had left her a little cowed and unsure of herself, but she
had brightened up like a flower set in the cheerful surroundings of
the Winchester and under the influence of Jimmie's restored spirits.The change had come about on Jimmie's "last day of grace."He had
secured the coveted position at the Perkins agency at a slight advance
over the salary he had received at the old place.He had left Eleanor
in the morning determined to face becomingly the disappointment that
was in store for him, and to accept the bitter necessity of admitting
his failure to his friends.He had come back in the late afternoon
with his fortunes restored, the long weeks of humiliation wiped out,
and his life back again on its old confident and inspired footing.He had burst into the studio with his news before he understood that
Eleanor was not alone, and inadvertently shared the secret with
Gertrude, who had been waiting for him with the kettle alight and some
wonderful cakes from "Henri's" spread out on the tea table.The three
had celebrated by dining together at a festive down-town hotel and
going back to his studio for coffee.At parting they had solemnly and
severally kissed one another.Eleanor lay awake in the dark for a long
time that night softly rubbing the cheek that had been so caressed,
and rejoicing that the drink Uncle Jimmie had called a high-ball and
had pledged their health with so assiduously, had come out of two
glasses instead of a bottle.Her life at the Hutchinsons' was almost like a life on another planet.Margaret was the younger, somewhat delicate daughter of a family of
rather strident academics.Professor Hutchinson was not dependent on
his salary to defray the expenses of his elegant establishment, but
on his father, who had inherited from his father in turn the
substantial fortune on which the family was founded.Margaret was really a child of the fairies, but she was considerably
more fortunate in her choice of a foster family than is usually the
fate of the foundling.The rigorous altitude of intellect in which she
was reared served as a corrective to the oversensitive quality of her
imagination.Eleanor, who in the more leisurely moments of her life was given to
visitations from the poetic muse, was inspired to inscribe some lines
to her on one of the pink pages of the private diary.They ran as
follows, and even Professor Hutchinson, who occupied the chair of
English in that urban community of learning that so curiously bisects
the neighborhood of Harlem, could not have designated Eleanor's
description of his daughter as one that did not describe."Aunt Margaret is fair and kind,
                  And very good and tender."She moves around the room with grace,
                  Her hands she puts with quickness.Although she wears upon her face
                  The shadow of a sickness."It was this "shadow of a sickness," that served to segregate Margaret
to the extent that was really necessary for her well being.To have
shared perpetually in the almost superhuman activities of the family
might have forever dulled that delicate spirit to which Eleanor came
to owe so much in the various stages of her development.Margaret put her arm about the child after the ordeal of the first
dinner at the big table."Father does not bite," she said, "but Grandfather does.If Grandfather shows his teeth, run for your
life.""I don't know where to run to," Eleanor answered seriously, whereupon
Margaret hugged her.Her Aunt Margaret would have been puzzling to
Eleanor beyond any hope of extrication, but for the quick imagination
that unwound her riddles almost as she presented them.For one
terrible minute Eleanor had believed that Hugh Hutchinson senior did
bite, he looked so much like some of the worst of the pictures in
Little Red Riding Hood."While you are here I'm going to pretend you're my very own child,"
Margaret told Eleanor that first evening, "and we'll never, never tell
anybody all the foolish games we play and the things we say to each
other.I can just barely manage to be grown up in the bosom of my
family, and when I am in the company of your esteemed Aunt Beulah, but
up here in my room, Eleanor, I am never grown up.She opened a funny old chest in the
corner of the spacious, high studded chamber."And here are some of
the dolls that I play with."She produced a manikin dressed primly
after the manner of eighteen-thirty, prim parted hair over a small
head festooned with ringlets, a fichu, and mits painted on her
fingers."Beulah," she said with a mischievous flash of a grimace at
Eleanor."Gertrude,"--a dashing young brunette in riding clothes."Jimmie,"--a curly haired dandy."David,"--a serious creature with a
monocle."I couldn't find Peter," she said, "but we'll make him some
day out of cotton and water colors."Eleanor cried in delight, "real dolls with
hair and different  eyes?""I can make pretty good ones," Margaret smiled; "manikins like
these,--a Frenchwoman taught me."And do you play that the dolls talk to each other as if
they was--were the persons?"Margaret assembled the four manikins into a smart little
group.The doll Beulah rose,--on her forefinger."I can't help
feeling," mimicked Margaret in a perfect reproduction of Beulah's
earnest contralto, "that we're wasting our lives,--criminally
dissipating our forces."The doll Gertrude put up both hands."I want to laugh," she cried,
"won't everybody please stop talking till I've had my laugh out."Why, that's just like Aunt Gertrude," Eleanor said."Her voice has
that kind of a sound like a bell, only more ripply.""Don't be high-brow," Jimmie's lazy baritone besought with the slight
burring of the "r's" that Eleanor found so irresistible."I'm only a
poor hard-working, business man.""We intend to devote the
rest of our lives," he said, "to the care of our beloved cooperative
orphan."On that he made a rather over mannered exit, Margaret
planting each foot down deliberately until she flung him back in his
box."That's the kind of a silly your Aunt Margaret is," she
continued, "but you mustn't ever tell anybody, Eleanor."She clasped
the child again in one of her warm, sudden embraces, and Eleanor
squeezing her shyly in return was altogether enraptured with her new
existence."But there isn't any doll for _you_, Aunt Margaret," she cried.yes, there is, but I wasn't going to show her to you unless you
asked, because she's so nice.I saved the prettiest one of all to be
myself, not because I believe I'm so beautiful, but--but only because
I'd like to be, Eleanor.""I always pretend I'm a princess," Eleanor admitted.The Aunt Margaret doll was truly a beautiful creation, a little more
like Marie Antoinette than her namesake, but bearing a not
inconsiderable resemblance to both, as Margaret pointed out,
judicially analyzing her features.Eleanor played with the rabbit doll only at night after this.In the
daytime she looked rather battered and ugly to eyes accustomed to the
delicate finish of creatures like the French manikins, but after she
was tucked away in her cot in the passion flower dressing-room--all of
Margaret's belongings and decorations were a faint, pinky
lavender,--her dear daughter Gwendolyn, who impersonated Albertina at
increasingly rare intervals as time advanced, lay in the hollow of her
arm and received her sacred confidences and ministrations as usual.*       *       *       *       *

"When my two (2) months are up here I think I should be quite sorry,"
she wrote in the diary, "except that I'm going to Uncle Peter next,
and him I would lay me down and dee for, only I never get time enough
to see him, and know if he wants me to, when I live with him I shall
know.Well life is very exciting all the time now.Aunt Margaret
brings me up this way.She tells me that she loves me and that I've
got beautiful eyes and hair and am sweet.She says she wants to love me up enough to last because I never
had love enough before.Albertina never loves any
one, but on Cape Cod nobody loves anybody--not to say so anyway.If a
man is getting married they say he _likes_ that girl he is going to
marry.In New York they act as different as they eat.The Hutchinsons
act different from anybody.They do not know Aunt Margaret has adoptid
me.Nobody knows I am adoptid but me and my aunts and uncles.Miss
Prentis and Aunt Beulah's mother when she came home and all the
bohemiar ladies and all the ten Hutchinsons think I am a little
visiting girl from the country.It is nobody's business because I am
supported out of allowances and salaries, but it makes me feel queer
sometimes.I feel like

                "'Where did you come from, baby dear,
                Out of the nowhere unto the here?'Also I made this up out of home sweet home."'Pleasures and palaces where e'er I may roam,
            Be it ever so humble I wish I had a home.'"I like having six homes, but I wish everybody knew it.Speaking of homes I asked Aunt Margaret why my aunts
and uncles did not marry each other and make it easier for every one.She said they were not going to get married.'Am I the same thing as getting married?'She said no, I
wasn't except that I was a responsibility to keep them unselfish and
real.Aunt Beulah doesn't believe in marriage.Aunt Margaret doesn't think she has the health.Aunt Gertrude has
to have a career of sculpture, Uncle David has got to marry some one
his mother says to or not at all, and does not like to marry anyway.Uncle Jimmie never saw a happy mariage yet and thinks you have a beter
time in single blesedness.Uncle Peter did not sign in the book where
they said they would adopt me and not marry.They did not want to ask
him because he had some trouble once.Well I am
going to be married sometime.I want a house to do the housework in
and a husband and a backyard full of babies.Perhaps I would rather
have a hired butler and gold spoons.Of course I
would like to have time to write poetry.I can sculpture too, but I
don't want a career of it because it's so dirty."*       *       *       *       *

Physically Eleanor throve exceedingly during this phase of her
existence.The nourishing food and regular living, the sympathy
established between herself and Margaret, the regime of physical
exercise prescribed by Beulah which she had been obliged guiltily to
disregard during the strenuous days of her existence in Washington
Square, all contributed to the accentuation of her material
well-being.She played with Margaret's nephew, and ran up and down
stairs on errands for her mother.She listened to the tales related
for her benefit by the old people, and gravely accepted the attentions
of the two formidable young men of the family, who entertained her
with the pianola and excerpts from classic literature and folk lore.*       *       *       *       *

"The We Are Sevens meet every Saturday afternoon," she wrote--on a
yellow page this time--"usually at Aunt Beulah's house.I am examined on what I have learned but I don't mind
it much.Physically I am found to be very good by measure and waite.I am very bright on the subject of
poetry.They do not know whether David Copperfield had been a wise
choice for me, but when I told them the story and talked about it they
said I had took it right.I don't tell them about the love part of
Aunt Margaret's bringing up.Aunt Beulah says it would make me self
conscioush to know that I had such pretty eyes and hair.Aunt Gertrude
said 'why not mention my teeth to me, then,' but no one seemed to
think so.Aunt Beulah says not to develope my poetry because the
theory is to strengthen the weak part of the bridge, and make me do
arithmetic.'Drill on the deficiency,' she says.Well I should think
the love part was a deficiency, but Aunt Beulah thinks love is weak
and beneath her and any one.Uncle David told me privately that he
thought I was having the best that could happen to me right now being
with Aunt Margaret.I didn't tell him that the David doll always gets
put away in the box with the Aunt Margaret doll and nobody else ever,
but I should like to have.*       *       *       *       *

Some weeks later she wrote to chronicle a painful scene in which she
had participated.*       *       *       *       *

"I quarreled with the ten Hutchinsons.They laughed
at me too much for being a little girl and a Cape Codder, but they
could if they wanted to, but when they laughed at Aunt Margaret for
adopting me and the tears came in her eyes I could not bare it.I did
not let the cat out of the bag, but I made it jump out.The
Grandfather asked me when I was going back to Cape Cod, and I said I
hoped never, and then I said I was going to visit Uncle Peter and Aunt
Gertrude and Uncle David next.They said 'Uncle David--do you mean
David Bolling?'and I did, so I said 'yes.'Then all the Hutchinsons
pitched into Aunt Margaret and kept laughing and saying, 'Who is this
mysterious child anyway, and how is it that her guardians intrust her
to a crowd of scatter brain youngsters for so long?'and then they
said 'Uncle David Bolling--_what_ does his mother say?'Then Aunt
Margaret got very red in the face and the tears started to come, and I
said 'I am not a mysterious child, and my Uncle David is as much my
Uncle David as they all are,' and then I said 'My Aunt Margaret has
got a perfect right to have me intrusted to her at any time, and not
to be laughed at for it,' and I went and stood in front of her and
gave her my handkercheve."Well I am glad somebody has been told that I am properly adoptid, but
I am sorry it is the ten Hutchinsons who know."CHAPTER IX

PETER


Uncle Peter treated her as if she were grown up; that was the
wonderful thing about her visit to him,--if there could be one thing
about it more wonderful than another.From the moment when he ushered
her into his friendly, low ceiled drawing-room with its tiers upon
tiers of book shelves, he admitted her on terms of equality to the
miraculous order of existence that it was the privilege of her life to
share.The pink silk coverlet and the elegance of the silver coated
steampipes at Beulah's; the implacable British stuffiness at the
Winchester which had had its own stolid charm for the lineal
descendant of the Pilgrim fathers; the impressively casual atmosphere
over which the "hired butler" presided distributing after-dinner gold
spoons, these impressions all dwindled and diminished and took their
insignificant place in the background of the romance she was living
and breathing in Peter's jewel box of an apartment on Thirtieth
Street.Even to more sophisticated eyes than Eleanor's the place seemed to be
a realized ideal of charm and homeliness.It was one of the older
fashioned duplex apartments designed in a more aristocratic decade for
a more fastidious generation, yet sufficiently adapted to the modern
insistence on technical convenience.Peter owed his home to his
married sister, who had discovered it and leased it and settled it and
suddenly departed for a five years' residence in China with her
husband, who was as she so often described him, "a blooming
Englishman, and an itinerant banker."Peter's domestic affairs were
despatched by a large, motherly Irishwoman, whom Eleanor approved of
on sight and later came to respect and adore without reservation.Peter's home was a home with a place in it for her--a place that it
was perfectly evident was better with her than without her.She even
slept in the bed that Peter's sister's little girl had occupied, and
there were pictures on the walls that had been selected for her.She had been very glad to make her escape from the Hutchinson
household.Her "quarrel" with them had made no difference in their
relation to her.To her surprise they treated her with an increase of
deference after her outburst, and every member of the family,
excepting possibly Hugh Hutchinson senior, was much more carefully
polite to her.Margaret explained that the family really didn't mind
having their daughter a party to the experiment of cooperative
parenthood.It appealed to them as a very interesting try-out of
modern educational theory, and their own theories of the independence
of the individual modified their criticism of Margaret's secrecy in
the matter, which was the only criticism they had to make since
Margaret had an income of her own accruing from the estate of the aunt
for whom she had been named."It is very silly of me to be sensitive about being laughed at,"
Margaret concluded."I've lived all my life surrounded by people
suffering from an acute sense of humor, but I never, never, never
shall get used to being held up to ridicule for things that are not
funny to me.""I shouldn't think you would," Eleanor answered devoutly.In Peter's house there was no one to laugh at her but Peter, and when
Peter laughed she considered it a triumph.It meant that there was
something she said that he liked.The welcome she had received as a
guest in his house and the wonderful evening that succeeded it were
among the epoch making hours in Eleanor's life.The Hutchinson victoria, for Grandmother Hutchinson still clung to the
old-time, stately method of getting about the streets of New York, had
left her at Peter's door at six o'clock of a keen, cool May evening.Margaret had not been well enough to come with her, having been
prostrated by one of the headaches of which she was a frequent
victim.The low door of ivory white, beautifully carved and paneled, with its
mammoth brass knocker, the row of window boxes along the cornice a few
feet above it, the very look of the house was an experience and an
adventure to her.When she rang, the door opened almost instantly
revealing Peter on the threshold with his arms open.He had led her up
two short flights of stairs--ivory white with carved banisters, she
noticed, all as immaculately shining with soap and water as a Cape Cod
interior--to his own gracious drawing-room where Mrs.Finnigan was
bowing and smiling a warmhearted Irish welcome to her.It was like a
wonderful story in a book and her eyes were shining with joy as Uncle
Peter pulled out her chair and she sat down to the first meal in her
honor.The grown up box of candy at her plate, the grave air with
which Peter consulted her tastes and her preferences were all a part
of a beautiful magic that had never quite touched her before.She had been like a little girl in a dream passing dutifully or
delightedly through the required phases of her experience, never quite
believing in its permanence or reality; but her life with Uncle Peter
was going to be real, and her own.That was what she felt the moment
she stepped over his threshold.After their coffee before the open fire--she herself had had "cambric"
coffee--Peter smoked his cigar, while she curled up in silence in the
twin to his big cushioned chair and sampled her chocolates.The blue
flames skimmed the bed of black coals, and finally settled steadily at
work on them nibbling and sputtering until the whole grate was like a
basket full of molten light, glowing and golden as the hot sun when it
sinks into the sea.Except to offer her the ring about his slender Panatela, and to ask
her if she were happy, Peter did not speak until he had deliberately
crushed out the last spark from his stub and thrown it into the fire.The ceremony over, he held out his arms to her and she slipped into
them as if that moment were the one she had been waiting for ever
since the white morning looked into the window of the lavender
dressing-room on Morningside Heights, and found her awake and quite
cold with the excitement of thinking of what the day was to bring
forth."Eleanor," Peter said, when he was sure she was comfortably arranged
with her head on his shoulder, "Eleanor, I want you to feel at home
while you are here, really at home, as if you hadn't any other home,
and you and I belonged to each other.I'm almost too young to be your
father, but--"

"Oh!Eleanor asked fervently, as he paused.

"--But I can come pretty near feeling like a father to you if it's a
father you want.I lost my own father when I was a little older than
you are now, but I had my dear mother and sister left, and so I don't
know what it's like to be all alone in the world, and I can't always
understand exactly how you feel, but you must always remember that I
want to understand and that I will understand if you tell me."Yes, Uncle Peter," she said soberly; then perhaps for the first time
since her babyhood she volunteered a caress that was not purely
maternal in its nature.She put up a shy hand to the cheek so close to
her own and patted it earnestly."Of course I've got my grandfather
and grandmother," she argued, "but they're very old, and not very
affectionate, either.Then I have all these new aunts and uncles
pretending," she was penetrating to the core of the matter, Peter
realized, "that they're just as good as parents.Of course, they're
just as good as they can be and they take so much trouble that it
mortifies me, but it isn't just the same thing, Uncle Peter!""I know," Peter said, "I know, dear, but you must remember we mean
well.""I don't mean you; it isn't you that I think of when I think about my
co--co-woperative parents, and it isn't any of them specially,--it's
just the idea of--of visiting around, and being laughed at, and not
really belonging to anybody.""That was what I hoped you would say, Uncle Peter," she whispered.They had a long talk after this, discussing the past and the future;
the past few months of the experiment from Eleanor's point of view,
and the future in relation to its failures and successes.Beulah was
to begin giving her lessons again and she was to take up music with a
visiting teacher on Peter's piano.(Eleanor had not known it was a
piano at first, as she had never seen a baby grand before.Peter did
not know what a triumph it was when she made herself put the question
to him.)"If my Aunt Beulah could teach me as much as she does and make it as
interesting as Aunt Margaret does, I think I would make her feel very
proud of me," Eleanor said."I get so nervous saving energy the way
Aunt Beulah says for me to
