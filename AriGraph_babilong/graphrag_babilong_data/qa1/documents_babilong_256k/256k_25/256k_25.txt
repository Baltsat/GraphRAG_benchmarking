The man smiled imperturbably, and went on:

"The letter in question having come into your possession recently, you,
with two companions, spent three weeks encamped on Greenberry Point,
ostensibly for your health, or the night air, or anything else that
would deceive the Naval authorities.During which time, you dug up the
entire Point, dragged the waters immediately adjoining--and then
departed, very strangely choosing for it a time of storm and change of
weather.Evidently, the thieves had managed to
communicate with a confederate, and this was a hold-up."Therefore, it is entirely reasonable to suppose that your search was
not ineffectual.In plain words, you have recovered the treasure."Croyden only smiled, and waited, too."Very good!--we will proceed," said the stranger."The jewels were
found on Government land.It makes no difference whether recovered on
the Point or on the Bay--the law covering treasure trove, I am
informed, doesn't apply.The Government is entitled to the entire find,
it being the owner in fee of the land.""I have devoted my spare moments to the study of
the law----"

"And how to avoid it," Croyden interjected."And also how to prevent _others_ from avoiding it," he replied,
suggestively."Let us take up that phase, if it please you."asked Croyden, suppressing an inclination
to laugh."Then let us take it up, any way--unless you wish to forfeit your find
to the Government.""We are arriving, now, at the pith of the
matter.We will take Parmenter's estimate and
multiply it by two, though jewels have appreciated more than that in
valuation.Fifty thousand pounds is two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars, which will total, according to the calculation, half a million
dollars,--one half of which amount you pay us as our share."Why don't you call it properly--blackmail?""If you prefer blackmail to
share, it will not hinder the contract--seeing that it is quite as
illegal on your part as on ours.Share merely sounds a little better
but either obtains the same end.Call it what you
will--but _pay_.""If you are not familiar
with the law covering the subject under discussion, let me enlighten
you.""I was endeavoring to state the matter succinctly," the stranger
replied, refusing to be hurried or flustered."The Common Law and the
practice of the Treasury Department provide, that all treasure found on
Government land or within navigable waters, is Government property.If
declared by the finder, immediately, he shall be paid such reward as
the Secretary may determine.If he does not declare, and is informed
on, the informer gets the reward.You will observe that, under the law,
you have forfeited the jewels--I fancy I do not need to draw further
deductions.""No!--it's quite unnecessary," Croyden remarked."Your fellow thieves
went into that phase (good word, I like it!)rather fully, down on
Greenberry Point.Unluckily, they fell into the hands of the police,
almost immediately, and we have not been able to continue the
conversation.""I have the honor to continue the conversation--and, in the interim,
you have found the treasure.So, Parmenter's letter won't be
essential--the facts, circumstances, your own and Mr.Macloud's
testimony, will be sufficient to prove the Government's case.Then, as
you are aware, it's pay or go to prison for larceny.""There is one very material hypothesis, which you assume as a fact, but
which is, unfortunately, not a fact," said Croyden.The man laughed, good-humoredly."We don't ask you to acknowledge the
finding--just pay over the quarter of a million and we will forget
everything.""My good man, I'm speaking the truth!""Maybe it's
difficult for you to recognize, but it's the truth, none the less.I
only wish I _had_ the treasure--I think I'd be quite willing to share
it, even with a blackmailer!""I trust it will give no offence if I say I don't believe you."And, without more ado, he turned his back and went up the path to
Clarendon.XII

I COULD TELL SOME THINGS


When Croyden had got Parmenter's letter from the secret drawer in the
escritoire, he rang the old-fashioned pull-bell for Moses.It was only
a little after nine, and, though he did not require the <DW64> to remain
in attendance until he retired, he fancied the kitchen fire still held
him.In a moment Moses appeared--his eyes heavy
with the sleep from which he had been aroused."Moses, did you ever shoot a pistol?""Fur de Lawd, seh!Hit's bin so long sence I dun hit, I t'ink I'se
gun-shy, seh.""Yass, seh, I has don hit.""And you could do it again, if necessary?""I speck so, seh--leas'wise, I kin try--dough I'se mons'us unsuttin,
seh, mons'us unsuttin!""Uncertain of what--your shooting or your hitting?""Well, we're all of us somewhat uncertain in that line.At least you
know enough not to point the revolver toward yourself.""Hi!--I sut'n'y does!seh, I sut'n'y does!"said the <DW64>, with a
broad grin."There is a revolver, yonder, on the table," said Croyden, indicating
one of those they used on Greenberry Point."It's a self-cocker--you
simply pull the trigger and the action does the rest."Yass, seh, I onderstands," said Moses."Bring it here," Croyden ordered.Moses' fingers closed around the butt, a bit timorously, and he carried
it to his master."I'll show you the action," said Croyden."Here, is the ejector,"
throwing the chamber out, "it holds six shots, you see: but you never
put a cartridge under the firing-pin, because, if anything strikes the
trigger, it's likely to be discharged."Croyden loaded it, closed the cylinder, and passed it over to Moses,
who took it with a little more assurance.He was harkening back thirty
years, and more."What do yo warn me to do, seh?""I want you to sit down, here, while I'm away, and if any one tries to
get in this house, to-night, you're to shoot him.I'm going over to
Captain Carrington's--I'll be back by eleven o'clock.It isn't likely
you will be disturbed; if you are, one shot will frighten him off, even
if you don't hit him, and I'll hear the shot, and come back at once."Yass, seh!--I'm to shoot anyone what tries to get in.""You're to shoot anyone who tries to
_break_ in.don't shoot me, when I return, or any
one else who comes legitimately.Be sure he is an intruder, then bang
away.""Sut'n'y, seh!I'se dub'us bout hittin', but I kin bang
away right nuf.Does yo' spose any one will try to git in, seh?"Croyden smiled--"but you be ready for them, Moses, be
ready for them.It's just as well to provide against contingencies."as Croyden went out and the front door closed behind him,
"but dem 'tingencies is monty dang'ous t'ings to fools wid.I don'
likes hit, dat's whar I don'."Croyden found Miss Carrington just where he had left her--a quick
return to the sofa having been synchronous with his appearance in the
hall."I had a mind not to wait here," she said; "you were an inordinately
long time, Mr."I was, and I admit
it--but it can be explained.""Before you listen to me, listen to Robert Parmenter, deceased!"said
he, and gave her the letter."Oh, this is the letter--do you mean that I am to read it?"She read it through without a single word of comment--an amazing thing
in a woman, who, when her curiosity is aroused, can ask more questions
to the minute than can be answered in a month.When she had finished,
she turned back and read portions of it again, especially the direction
as to finding the treasure, and the postscript bequests by the Duvals.At last, she dropped the letter in her lap and looked up at Croyden."Most extraordinary in its
ordinariness, and most ordinary in its extraordinariness.And you
searched, carefully, for three weeks and found--nothing?""Now, I'll tell you about it.""First, tell me where you obtained this letter?""I found it by accident--in a secret compartment of an escritoire at
Clarendon," he answered."This is the tale of Parmenter's treasure--and how we did _not_ find
it!"Then he proceeded to narrate, briefly, the details--from the finding of
the letter to the present moment, dwelling particularly on the episode
of the theft of their wallets, the first and second coming of the
thieves to the Point, their capture and subsequent release, together
with the occurrence of this evening, when he was approached, by the
well-dressed stranger, at Clarendon's gates.And, once again, marvelous to relate, Miss Carrington did not
interrupt, through the entire course of the narrative.Nor did she
break the silence for a time after he had concluded, staring
thoughtfully, the while, down into the grate, where a smouldering back
log glowed fitfully."What do you intend to do, as to the treasure?"In the
words of the game, popular hereabout, he is playing a bobtail!""But he doesn't know it's a bobtail.He is convinced you found the
treasure," she objected."Let him make whatever trouble he can, it won't bother me, in the
least.""He is not acting alone," she persisted."He has confederates--they may
attack Clarendon, in an effort to capture the treasure."this is the twentieth century, not the seventeenth!""We don't'stand-by to repel boarders,' these days.""Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways!""Rather queer!--I've heard those same words before, in this
connection.""Possibly--though I don't recall it.Suppose you are attacked and
tortured till you reveal where you've hidden the jewels?""However, I
put Moses on guard--with a big revolver and orders to fire at anyone
molesting the house.If we hear a fusillade we'll know it's he shooting
up the neighborhood.""Then the same idea _did_ suggest itself to you!""Only to the extent of searching for the jewels--I regarded that as
vaguely possible, but there isn't the slightest danger of any one being
tortured.""You know best, I suppose," she said--"but you've had your warning--and
pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.You've given up all hope of finding
the treasure--abandoned jewels worth--how many dollars?""Possibly half a million," he filled in."If you can suggest what to do--anything which hasn't been done, I
shall be only too glad to consider it.""You say you dug up the entire Point for a hundred yards inland?""And dredged the Bay for a hundred yards?"She puckered her brows in thought.He regarded her with an amused
smile."I don't see what you're to do, except to do it all over again," she
announced--"Now, don't laugh!It may sound foolish, but many a thing
has been found on a second seeking--and this, surely, is worth a
second, or a third, or even many seekings.""If there were any assurance of ultimate success, it would pay to spend
a lifetime hunting.The two essentials, however, are wanting: the
extreme tip of Greenberry Point in 1720, and the beech-trees.We made
the best guess at their location.More than that, the zone of
exploration embraced every possible extreme of territory--yet, we
failed.It will make nothing for success to try again.""Somewhere, in the Bay!--It's shoal water, for three or four hundred
feet around the Point, with a rock bottom.The Point itself has been
eaten into by the Bay, down to this rock.Parmenter's chest disappeared
with the land in which it was buried, and no man will find it now,
except by accident.""Without anyone having the fun of wasting it!"She took up Parmenter's letter again, and glanced over it.Then she
handed it back, and shook her head."It's too much for my poor brain," she said.We gave it rather more than a fair trial,
and, then, we gave it up.When I go home, to-night, I shall
return the letter to the escritoire where I found it, and forget it."You can return it to its hiding place," she reflected, "but you can't
cease wondering.Why didn't Marmaduke Duval get the treasure while the
landmarks were there?"Probably on account of old Parmenter's restriction that it be left
until the 'extremity of need.'""Probably," she said, "the Duvals would regard it as a matter of honor
to observe the exact terms of the bequest."It's only because they did so, that I got a chance to search!""You mean that, otherwise, there would be no buried treasure!"And with all that money, the Duvals
might have gone away from Hampton--might have experienced other
conditions.Colonel Duval might never have met your father--you might
have never come to Clarendon.--My goodness!"In the realm of pure conjecture," he answered."It is idle to theorize
on the might-have-beens, or what might-have-happened if the
what-did-happen hadn't happened.Dismiss it, at least, for this
evening.You asked what I was doing for three weeks at Annapolis, and I
have consumed a great while in answering--let us talk of something
else.What have you been doing in those three weeks?"A little Bridge, a few riding parties, some sails on the Bay,
with an occasional homily by Miss Erskine, when she had me cornered,
and I couldn't get away.Then is when I learned what a deep impression
you had made!""We both were learning, it seems," he replied."I don't quite understand," she said."You made an impression, also--of course, that's to be expected, but
this impression is much more than the ordinary kind!"_"Merci, Monsieur_," she scoffed."No, it isn't _merci_, it's a fact.And he is a mighty good fellow on
whom to make an impression.""You mean, Mr.--Macloud?""For he's coming back----"

"To Hampton?""To be accurate, I expect him not later than the day-after-to-morrow.""I shall believe you, when I see him!""He is, I think, coming solely on your account.""But you're not quite sure?--oh!"Naturally, he hasn't confided in me.""So you're confiding in me--how clever!""I could tell some things----"

"Which are fables.""----but I won't--they might turn your head----"

"Which way--to the right or left?""----and make you too confident and too cruel.He saw you but
twice----"

"Once!""Once, on the street; again, when we called in the evening--but he gave
you a name, the instant he saw you----"

"How kind of him!""He called you: 'The Symphony in Blue.'""Was that the first time you had noticed it?""No, you most assuredly do not!"she said, "I know you're intrepid--but you _won't_!""Because, it would be false to your friend."Yes!--as between you two, you have renounced, in his favor.""At least, I so view it," with a teasingly fascinating smile."Don't you think that you protest over-much?""If we were two children, I'd say: 'You think you're smart, don't
you?'""And I'd retort: 'You got left, didn't you?'""Seriously, however--do you really expect Mr."I surely do--probably within two days; and I'm not chaffing when I say
that you're the inducement.So, be good to him--he's got more than
enough for two, I can assure you.""And what number am I--the twenty-first, or thereabout?""What matters it, if you're _the_ one, at present?""I'd sooner be the present one than all the has-beens," he insisted."If it will advantage any----"

"I didn't say so," she interrupted.

"----I can tell you----"

"Many fables, I don't doubt!"----that we have been rather intimate, for a few years, and I have
never before known him to exhibit particular interest in any woman.""'Why don't you speak for yourself, John,'" she quoted, merrily."Because, to be frank, I haven't enough for two," he answered, gayly.But beneath the gayety, she thought she detected the faintest note of
regret.And, woman-like, when he had gone, she wondered about her--whether she
was dark or fair, tall or small, vivacious or reserved, flirtatious or
sedate, rich or poor--and whether they loved each other--or whether it
was he, alone, who loved--or whether he had not permitted himself to be
carried so far--or whether--then, she dropped asleep.Croyden went back to Clarendon, keeping a sharp look-out for anyone
under the trees around the house.He found Moses in the library,
evidently just aroused from slumber by the master's door key."No one's bin heah, seh, 'cep de boy wid dis'spatch," he hastened to
say.Croyden tore open the envelope:--It was a wire from Macloud, that he
would be down to-morrow.yass, seh!--I'se pow'ful glad yo's back, seh.Nothin' I kin
git yo befo I goes?""You're a good soldier, Moses, you didn't
sleep on guard."I keps wide awake, Marster Croyden, wide awake all de time,
seh.Croyden finished his cigar, put out the light, and went slowly
upstairs--giving not a thought to the Parmenter treasure nor the man he
had met outside.His mind was busy with Elaine Cavendish--their last
night on the moonlit piazza--the brief farewell--the lingering pressure
of her fingers--the light in her eyes--the subdued pleasure, when they
met unexpectedly in Annapolis--her little ways to detain him, keep him
close to her--her instant defense of him at Mattison's scurrilous
insinuation--the officers' hop--the rhythmic throb of the melody--the
scented, fluttering body held close in his arms--the lowered head--the
veiled eyes--the trembling lashes--his senses steeped in the fragrance
of her beauty--the temptation well-nigh irresistible--his resolution
almost gone--trembling--trembling----

                  *       *       *       *       *

The vision passed--music ceased--the dance was ended.Sentiment
vanished--reason reigned once more.to think of her, to dream of the past, even.But
it is pleasant, sometimes, to be a fool--where a beautiful woman is
concerned, and only one's self to pay the piper.XIV

THE SYMPHONY IN BLUE


Macloud arrived the next day, bringing for his host a great batch of
mail, which had accumulated at the Club."I thought of it at the last moment--when I was starting for the
station, in fact," he remarked."The clerk said he had no instructions
for forwarding, so I just poked it in my bag and brought it along.Stupid of me not to think of it sooner.I
can understand why you didn't leave an address, but not why I shouldn't
forward it.""I didn't care, when I left--and I don't care much, now--but I'm
obliged, just the same!""It's something to do; the most
exciting incident of the day, down here, is the arrival of the mail.The people wait for it, with bated breath.I am getting in the way,
too, though I don't get much.... I never did have any extensive
correspondence, even in Northumberland--so this is just circulars and
such trash."He took the package, which Macloud handed him, and tossed it on the
desk.Everybody is
back--everybody is hard up or says he is--everybody is full of lies,
as usual, and is turning them loose on anyone who will listen,
credulous or sophisticated, it makes no difference.It's the telling,
not the believing that's the thing.the little cad Mattison is
engaged--Charlotte Brundage has landed him, and the wedding is set for
early next month.""I don't envy her the job," Croyden remarked."She'll be privileged to draw
on his bank account, and that's the all important thing with her.He
will fracture the seventh commandment, and she won't turn a hair.She
is a chilly proposition, all right.""Well, I wish her joy of her bargain," said Croyden."May she have
everything she wants, and see Mattison not at all, after the wedding
journey--and but very occasionally, then."He took up the letters and ran carelessly through them.he commented, as he consigned them, one by one,
to the waste-basket.Macloud watched him, languidly, behind his cigar smoke, and made no
comment.Presently Croyden came to a large, white envelope--darkened on the
interior so as to prevent the contents from being read until opened.It
bore the name of a firm of prominent brokers in Northumberland."'We own and offer, subject to
prior sale, the following high grade investment bonds.'He drew out the letter and looked at it,
perfunctorily, before sending it to rest with its fellows.--It wasn't
in the usual form.--He opened it, wider.--It was signed by the senior
partner.Croyden:

  "We have a customer who is interested in the Virginia Development
  Company.He has purchased the Bonds and the stock of Royster &
  Axtell, from the bank which held them as collateral.He is
  willing to pay you par for your Bonds, without any accrued
  interest, however.If you will consent to sell, the Company can
  proceed without reorganization but, if you decline, he will
  foreclose under the terms of the mortgage.We have suggested the
  propriety and the economy to him--since he owns or controls all
  the stock--of not purchasing your bonds, and, frankly, have told
  him it is worse than bad business to do so.But he refuses to be
  advised, insisting that he must be the sole owner, and that he is
  willing to submit to the additional expense rather than go
  through the tedious proceeding for foreclosure and sale.We are
  prepared to honor a sight-draft with the Bonds attached, or to
  pay cash on presentation and transfer.We shall be obliged for a
  prompt reply."Yours very truly,

                                              "R. J."What the devil!----"

He read it a second time.No, he wasn't asleep--it was all there,
typewritten and duly signed.Two hundred thousand dollars!--honor sight
draft, or pay cash on presentation and transfer!Then he passed it across to Macloud."Read this aloud, will you,--I want to see if I'm quite sane!"Macloud was at his favorite occupation--blowing smoke rings through one
another, and watching them spiral upward toward the ceiling.he said, as Croyden's words roused him from his
meditation.He and Blaxham had spent considerable time on that letter, trying to
explain the reason for the purchase, and the foolishly high price they
were offering, in such a way as to mislead Croyden."It is typewritten, you haven't a chance to get wrong!"he exclaimed.... "So, I wasn't crazy: and either
Blaxham is lying or his customer needs a guardian--which is it?""I don't see that it need concern you, in the least, which it is," said
Macloud."Be grateful for the offer--and accept by wireless or any
other way that's quicker.""But the bonds aren't worth five cents on the dollar!""So much the more reason to hustle the deal through.You may have slipped up on the Parmenter treasure, but you
have struck it here.""There's something queer about that
letter."Macloud smoked his cigar, and smiled."Blaxham's customer
may have the willies--indeed, he as much as intimates that such is the
case--but, thank God!we're not obliged to have a commission-in-lunacy
appointed on everybody who makes a silly stock or bond purchase.If we
were, we either would have no markets, or the courts would have time
for nothing else.take what the gods have given you
and be glad.You can return to
Northumberland, resume the old life, and be happy ever after;--or you
can live here, and there, and everywhere.You're unattached--not even a
light-o'-love to squander your money, and pester you for gowns and
hats, and get in a hell of a temper--and be false to you, besides.""No, I haven't one of them, thank God!""I've got
troubles enough of my own."It clears some of them away--if I take it."man, you're not thinking, seriously, of refusing?""It will put me on 'easy street,'" Croyden observed."And it comes with remarkable timeliness--so timely, indeed, as to be
suspicious.""It's a bona fide offer--there's no trouble on that score.""This," said Croyden: "I'm broke--finally.The Parmenter treasure is
moonshine, so far as I'm concerned.I'm down on my uppers, so to
speak--my only assets are some worthless bonds.along comes an
offer for them at par--two hundred thousand dollars for nothing!I
fancy, old man, there is a friend back of this offer--the only friend I
have in the world--and I did not think that even he was kind and
self-sacrificing enough to do it.--I'm grateful, Colin, grateful from
the heart, believe me, but I can't take your money."exclaimed Macloud--"you do me too much credit, Croyden.I'm
ashamed to admit it, but I never thought of the bonds, or of helping
you out, in your trouble.It's a way we have in Northumberland.We may
feel for misfortune, but it rarely gets as far as our pockets.Don't
imagine for a moment that I'm the purchaser.I'm not, though I wish,
now, that I was.""Will you give me your word on that?""I most assuredly will," Macloud answered.He looked at the
letter again.... "And, yet, it is very suspicious, very suspicious....
I wonder, could I ascertain the name of the purchaser of the stocks and
bonds, from the Trust Company who held them as collateral?""They won't know," said Macloud."Blaxham & Company bought them at the
public sale.""I could try the transfer agent, or the registrar.""They never tell anything, as you are aware," Macloud replied."I could refuse to sell unless Blaxham & Company disclosed their
customer.""Yes, you could--and, likely, lose the sale; they won't disclose.However, that's your business," Macloud observed; "though, it's a pity
to tilt at windmills, for a foolish notion."Croyden creased and uncreased the letter--thinking.Macloud resumed the smoke rings--and waited.It had proved easier than
he had anticipated.Croyden had not once thought of Elaine
Cavendish--and his simple word had been sufficient to clear
himself....

At length, Croyden put the letter back in its envelope and looked up."I'll sell the bonds," he said--"forward them at once with draft
attached, if you will witness my signature to the transfer.But it's a
queer proceeding, a queer proceeding: paying good money for bad!""That's his business--not yours," said Macloud, easily.Croyden went to the escritoire and took the bonds from one of the
drawers."You can judge, from the place I keep them, how much I thought them
worth!"When they were duly transferred and witnessed, Croyden attached a draft
drawn on an ordinary sheet of paper, dated Northumberland, and payable
to his account at the Tuscarora Trust Company.He placed them in an
envelope, sealed it and, enclosing it in a second envelope, passed it
over to Macloud."I don't care to inform them as to my whereabouts," he remarked, "so,
if you don't mind, I'll trouble you to address this to some one in New
York or Philadelphia, with a request that he mail the enclosed envelope
for you."Macloud, when he had done as requested, laid aside the pen and looked
inquiringly at Croyden."Which, being interpreted," he said, "might mean that you don't intend
to return to Northumberland.""The interpretation does not go quite so far; it means, simply, that I
have not decided.""It's a question of resolution, not of inclination," Croyden answered."I don't know whether I've sufficient resolution to go, and sufficient
resolution to stay, if I do go.It may be easier not to go, at all--to
live here, and wander, elsewhere, when the spirit moves.""I've been thinking over the proposition you
recently advanced of the folly of a relatively poor man marrying a rich
girl," he said, "and you're all wrong.It's a question of the
respective pair, not a theory that can be generalized over.I admit,
the man should not be a pauper, but, if he have enough money to support
_himself_, and the girl love him and he loves the girl, the fact that
she has gobs more money, won't send them on the rocks.It's up to the
pair, I repeat.""Meaning, that it would be up to Elaine Cavendish and me?""I wish I could be so sure," Croyden reflected."Sure of the girl, as
well as sure of myself.""What are you doubtful about--yourself?"Croyden laughed, a trifle self-consciously."I fancy I could manage myself," he said."Try her!--she's worth the try.""Get the miserable money out of your mind a moment, will you?--you're
hipped on it!""All right, old man, anything for peace!Tell me, did you see her, when
you were home?""I did--I dined with her.""You--she talked Croyden at least seven-eighths of the time; I, the
other eighth."Anything left of the
victim, afterward?""I refuse to become facetious," Macloud responded.Then he threw his
cigar into the grate and arose."It matters not what was said, nor who
said it!If you will permit me the advice, you will take your chance
while you have it.""You have--more than a chance, if you act, now----" He walked across to
the window.He would let that sink in.--"How's the Symphony in Blue?""As charming as ever--and prepared for your coming.""As charming as ever, and prepared for your coming.""I left that finality for you--being the person most interested.""When did you arrange for me to go over?""She confided in you, I suppose?""Not directly; she let me infer it.""In other words, you worked your imagination--overtime!""It's a pity you couldn't work it a bit over the Parmenter
jewels."I'm done with the Parmenter jewels!""But they're not done with you, my friend.So long as you live, they'll
be present with you.You'll be hunting for them in your dreams.""Meet me to-night in dream-land!""Well, they're not
likely to disturb my slumbers--unless--there was a rather queer thing
happened, last night, Colin.""Yes!--I got in to Hampton, in the evening; about nine o'clock, I was
returning to Clarendon when, at the gates, I was accosted by a tall,
well-dressed stranger.Here is the substance of our talk.... What do
you make of it?""It seems to me the fellow made it very plain," Macloud returned,
"except on one possible point.He evidently believes we found the
treasure.""Then, he knows that you came direct from Annapolis to Hampton--I mean,
you didn't visit a bank nor other place where you could have deposited
the jewels.Ergo, the jewels are still in your possession, according to
his theory, and he is going to make a try for them while they are
within reach.He hoped, by that
means, to induce you to keep the jewels on the premises--not to make
evidence against yourself, which could be traced by the United States,
by depositing them in any bank.""Why shouldn't I have taken them to a dealer in precious stones?""Because that would make the best sort of evidence against you.You
must remember, he thinks you have the jewels, and that you will try to
conceal it, pending a Government investigation.""You make him a very canny gentleman.""No--I make him only a clever rogue, which, by your own account, he
is.""And the more clever he is, the more he will have his wits' work for
naught.There's some compensation in everything--even in failure!""It would be a bit annoying," observed Macloud, "to be visited by
burglars, who are obsessed with the idea that you have a fortune
concealed on the premises, and are bent on obtaining it.""Annoying?--not a bit!""I should rather enjoy the
sport of putting them to flight.""Or of being bound, and gagged, and ill-treated."you've transferred your robber-barons from Northumberland to the
Eastern Shore.""The robber-barons were still on the
job in Northumberland.These are banditti, disguised as burglars, about
to hold you up for ransom.""I wish I had your fine imagination," scoffed Croyden."I could make a
fortune writing fiction.""Oh, you're not so bad yourself!""It's bully good to think you're coming back to us!""Here, Moses," said Croyden, "take this letter down to the post
office--I want it to catch the first mail.""I fancy you haven't heard of the stranger since last evening?""And of course you haven't told any one?""I suppose you even told
her the entire story--from the finding of the letter down to date.""I did!--and showed her the letter besides."No reason in the world, my dear fellow--except that in twenty-four
hours the dear public will know it, and we shall be town curiosities.""We don't have to remain," said Croyden, with affected seriousness--"there
are trains out, you know, as well as in.""I don't want to go away--I came here to visit you.""But we can't take the Symphony in Blue!"You don't think I came down here to see only
you, after having just spent nearly four weeks with you, in that fool
quest on Greenberry Point?"He turned, suddenly, and faced Croyden."Think she will retail it to the
dear public?""Because, if you do, you might mention it to her--there, she goes,
now!"said Macloud, whirling around toward the window.On the opposite side of
the street, Miss Carrington--in a tailored gown of blue broadcloth,
close fitting and short in the skirt, with a velvet toque to match--was
swinging briskly back from town.Macloud watched her a moment in silence."The old man is done for, at last!""Look at the poise of the
head, and ease of carriage, and the way she puts down her feet!--that's
the way to tell a woman."You better go over," said his friend."It's about the tea hour, she'll
brew you a cup.""And I'll drink it--as much as she will give me.I despise the stuff,
but I'll drink it!""She'll put rum in it, if you prefer!"laughed Croyden; "or make you a
high ball, or you can have it straight--just as you want.""I'll be over, presently," Croyden replied."_I_ don't want any tea,
you know.""Come along, as soon as you
wish--but don't come _too soon_."XV

AN OLD RUSE


Macloud found Miss Carrington plucking a few belated roses, which,
somehow, had escaped the frost.She looked up at his approach, and smiled--the bewilderingly bewitching
smile which lighted her whole countenance and seemed to say so much."And, if I may, to you," he replied.After them, you belong to _me_," she laughed."I don't know--it was the order of speech, and the order of
acquaintance," with a naive look."But not the order of--regard.""You did it very well for a--novice.""You decline to accept it?--Very well, sir, very well!""I can't accept, and be honest," he replied.Perchance,
you will accept a reward: a cup of tea--or a high ball!""Perchance, I will--the high ball!"She looked at him, with a sly smile."You know that I have just returned," she said."I saw you in the
window at Clarendon.""And you came over at once--prepared to be surprised that I was here.""And found you waiting for me--just as I expected."Peccavi!_" he said humbly."_Te absolvo!_" she replied, solemnly."Now, let us make a fresh
start--by going for a walk.You can postpone the high ball until we
return.""I can postpone the high ball for ever," he averred."Meaning, you could walk forever, or you're not thirsty?""Meaning, I could walk forever _with you_--on, and on, and on----"

"Until you walked into the Bay--I understand.I'll take the will for
the deed--the water's rather chilly at this season of the year."Macloud held up his hand, in mock despair."Let us make a third start--drop the attempt to be clever and talk
sense.I think I can do it, if I try."As they came out on the side walk, Croyden was going down the street."I've not forgot your admonition, so don't be uneasy," he observed to
Macloud."I'm going to town now, I'll be back in about half an hour--is
that too soon?"Miss Carrington looked at Macloud, quizzically, but made no comment."The regulation walk--to the Cemetery and back.""It's the favorite walk, here," she explained--"the most picturesque
and the smoothest.""To say nothing of accustoming the people to their future home,"
Macloud remarked."You're not used to the ways of small towns--the Cemetery is a resort,
a place to spend a while, a place to visit.""Does it make death any easier to hob-nob with it?""I shouldn't think so," she replied."However, I can see how it would
induce morbidity, though there are those who are happiest only when
they're miserable.""Such people ought to live in a morgue," agreed Macloud."However
we're safe enough--we can go to the Cemetery with impunity.""There are some rather queer old headstones, out there," she said."Remorse and the inevitable pay-up for earthly transgression seem to be
the leading subjects.There is one in the Duval lot--the Duvals from
whom Mr.Croyden got Clarendon, you know--and I never have been able to
understand just what it means.It is erected to the memory of one
Robert Parmenter, and has cut in the slab the legend: 'He feared nor
man, nor god, nor devil,' and below it, a man on his knees making
supplication to one standing over him.If he feared nor man, nor god,
nor devil, why should he be imploring mercy from any one?""Do you know who Parmenter was?""No--but I presume a connection of the family, from having been buried
with them.""You read his letter only last evening--his letter to Marmaduke
Duval.""His letter to Marmaduke Duval!""I didn't read any----"

"Robert Parmenter is the pirate who buried the treasure on Greenberry
Point," he interrupted.Then, suddenly, a light broke in on her."I see!--I didn't look at the name signed to the letter.And the
cutting on the tombstone----?""Is a victim begging mercy from him," said Macloud."I like that
Marmaduke Duval--there's something fine in a man, in those times,
bringing the old buccaneer over from Annapolis and burying him beside
the place where he, himself, some day would rest.--That is
friendship!""It was a sad day in Hampton
when the Colonel died.""He left a good deputy," Macloud replied."Croyden is well-born and
well-bred (the former does not always comprehend the latter, these
days), and of Southern blood on his mother's side.""We are a bit clannish,
still.""Delighted to hear you confess it!"Mine doesn't go so far South, however, as Croyden's--only,
to Virginia."I knew there was some reason for my liking you!""Than your Southern ancestors?--isn't that enough?""Not if there be a means to increase it.""Southern blood is never satisfied with _some_ things--it always wants
more!""Is the disposition to want more, in Southerners, confined to the male
sex?""In _some things_--yes, unquestionably yes!"Croyden told you of his experience, last
evening?""What possible danger could there be--the treasure isn't at
Clarendon.""But they think it is--and desperate men sometimes take desperate
means, when they feel sure that money is hidden on the premises.""In a town the size of Hampton, every stranger is known.""How will that advantage, in the prevention of the crime?""They don't need stay in the town--they can come in an automobile.""They could also drive, or walk, or come by boat," he added."They are not so likely to try it if there are two in the house.Do you
intend to remain at Clarendon some time?""It depends--on how you treat me.""I engage to be nice for--two weeks!""Done!--I'm booked for two weeks, at least.""And when the two weeks have expired we shall consider whether to
extend the period."She flung him a look that was delightfully alluring."Do you wish me to--consider that?""If you will," he said, bending down."This pace is getting rather
brisk--did you notice it, Mr."You're in a fast class, Miss Carrington.""Now don't misunderstand me----"

"You were speaking in the language of the race track, I presume.""A Southern girl usually loves--horses," with a tantalizing smile."It is well for you this is a public street," he said."But then if it hadn't been, you would not have ventured to tempt me,"
he added."I'm grateful for the temptation, at any rate.""No, not likely--but his first that he has resisted."The fact that we are on a public street would
not restrain you.There was absolutely no one within sight--and you
knew it.""This is rather faster than the former going!""Any way, here is
the Cemetery, and we dare not go faster than a walk in it.Yonder, just
within the gates, is the Duval burial place.Come, I'll show you
Parmenter's grave?"They crossed to it--marked by a blue slate slab, which covered it
entirely.The inscription, cut in script, was faint in places and
blurred by moss, in others.Macloud stooped and, with his knife, scratched out the latter."He died two days after the letter was written: May 12, 1738," said he.Duval did not know it, I reckon.""See, here is the picture--it stands out very plainly," said Miss
Carrington, indicating with the point of her shoe."I'm not given to moralizing, particularly over a grave," observed
Macloud, "but it's queer to think that the old pirate, who had so much
blood and death on his hands, who buried the treasure, and who wrote
the letter, lies at our feet; and we--or rather Croyden is the heir of
that treasure, and that we searched and dug all over Greenberry Point,
committed violence, were threatened with violence, did things
surreptitiously, are threatened, anew, with blackmail and
violence----"

"Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways," she quoted."It does seem one cannot get away from its pollution.It was gathered
in crime and crime clings to it, still.However, I fancy Croyden would
willingly chance the danger, if he could unearth the casket.""And is there no hope of finding it?""Absolutely none--there's half a million over on Greenberry Point, or
in the water close by, and none will ever see it--except by accident.""My own idea--and Croyden's (as he has,
doubtless, explained to you) is that the place, where Parmenter buried
the jewels, is now under water, possibly close to the shore.We dragged
every inch of the bottom, which has been washed away to a depth more
than sufficient to uncover the iron box, but found nothing.A great
storm, such as they say sometimes breaks over the Chesapeake, may wash
it on the beach--that, I think, is the only way it will ever be
found.... It makes everything seem very real to have stood by
Parmenter's grave!"he said, thoughtful, as they turned back toward
town.On nearing the Carrington house, they saw Croyden approaching."I've been communing with Parmenter," said Macloud."I didn't know there was a spiritualistic medium in Hampton!"Well, did he help you to locate his jewel box?""He wasn't especially communicative--he was in his grave.""That isn't surprising--he's been dead something over one hundred and
seventy years."He's buried with the Duvals in the Cemetery, here."one more circumstance to prove the
letter speaks the truth.We find his
will, probated with Marmaduke Duval as executor, we even discover a
notice of his death in the _Gazette_, and now, finally, you find his
body--or the place of its interment!what is really
worth while, we can't find.""Come into the house--I'll give you something to soothe your feelings
temporarily," said Miss Carrington.They encountered Miss Erskine just coming from the library on her way
to the door."My dear Davila, so glad to see you!"Croyden,
we thought you had deserted us, and just when we're trying to make you
feel at home."I'm delighted to be back," said Croyden."The Carringtons seemed
genuinely glad to see me--and, now, if I may include you, I'm quite
content to return," and he shook her hand, as though he meant it."Of course you may believe it," with an inane giggle."I'm going to
bring my art class over to Clarendon to revel in your treasures, some
day, soon.You'll be at home to them, won't you, dear Mr.I shall take pleasure in being at home," Croyden replied,
soberly.Then Macloud, who was talking with the Captain, was called over and
presented, that being, Miss Carrington thought, the quickest method of
getting rid of her.The evident intention to remain until he was
presented, being made entirely obvious by Miss Erskine, who, after she
had bubbled a bit more, departed."What is her name, I didn't catch it?--and" (observing smiles on
Croyden and Miss Carrington's faces) "what is she?""I think father can explain, in more appropriate language!""She's the most intolerable nuisance and greatest fool in Hampton!""A red flag to a bull isn't in it with Miss Erskine and father," Miss
Carrington observed."But I hide it pretty well--while she's here," he protested."If she's not here too long--and you can get away, in time."When the two men left the Carrington place, darkness had fallen.As
they approached Clarendon, the welcoming brightness of a well-lighted
house sprang out to greet them.It was Croyden's one extravagance--to
have plenty of illumination.He had always been accustomed to it, and
the gloom, at night, of the village residence, bright only in library
or living room--with, maybe, a timid taper in the hall--set his nerves
on edge.And Moses, with considerable wonder
at, to his mind, the waste of gas, and much grumbling to himself and
Josephine, obeyed.They had finished dinner and were smoking their cigars in the library,
when Croyden, suddenly bethinking himself of a matter which he had
forgotten, arose and pulled the bell.said old Mose a moment later from the doorway."Moses, who is the best carpenter in town?""Mistah Snyder, seh--he wuz heah dis arfternoon, yo knows, seh!""I didn't know it," said Croyden."Why yo sont 'im, seh.""Dat's mons'us 'culiar, seh--he said yo sont 'im.He com'd 'torrectly
arfter yo lef!Him an' a'nudder man, seh--I didn't know the nudder man,
hows'ever.""Dey sed yo warn dem to look over all de place, seh, an' see what
repairs wuz necessary, and fix dem.Dey wuz heah a'most two hours, I
s'pose.""Do you mean they were
in this house for two hours?"I didn't stays wid em, seh--I knows
Mistah Snyder well; he's bin heah off'n to wuk befo' yo cum, seh.But I
seed dem gwine th'oo de drawers, an' poundin on the floohs, seh.Dey
went down to de cellar, too, seh, an wuz dyar quite a while."seh, don't you t'inks I knows 'im?I knows 'im from de time
he wuz so high.""Go down and tell Snyder I want to see him, either
to-night or in the morning."The <DW64> bowed, and departed.Croyden got up and went to the escritoire: the drawers were in
confusion.He glanced at the book-cases: the books were disarranged.He
turned and looked, questioningly, at Macloud--and a smile slowly
overspread his face."Well, the tall gentleman has visited us!""I wondered how long you would be coming to it!""It's the old ruse, in a slightly modified form.Instead of a
telephone or gas inspector, it was a workman whom the servant knew; a
little more trouble in disguising himself, but vastly more satisfactory
in results.""They are clever rogues," said Croyden--"and the disguise must have
been pretty accurate to deceive Moses.""Disguise is their business," Macloud replied, laconically."If they're
not proficient in it, they go to prison--sure.""And if they _are_ proficient, they go--sometimes.""We'll make a tour of inspection--they couldn't find what they wanted,
so we'll see what they took."Every drawer was turned upside down, every
closet awry, every place, where the jewels could be concealed, bore
evidence of having been inspected--nothing, apparently, had been
missed.They had gone through the house completely, even into the
garret, where every board that was loose had evidently been taken up
and replaced--some of them carelessly.Not a thing was gone, so far as Croyden could judge--possibly, because
there was no money in the house; probably, because they were looking
for jewels, and scorned anything of moderate value."Really, this thing grows interesting--if it were not so ridiculous,"
said Croyden."I'm willing to go to almost any trouble to convince them
I haven't the treasure--just to be rid of them."Abduction, maybe," Macloud suggested."Some night a black cloth will
be thrown over your head, you'll be tossed into a cab--I mean, an
automobile--and borne off for ransom like Charlie Ross of fading
memory.""Moral--don't venture out after sunset!""And don't venture out at any time without a revolver handy and a good
pair of legs," added Macloud."I can work the legs better than I can the revolver.""Or, to make sure, you might have a guard of honor and a gatling gun.""You're appointed to the position--provide yourself with the gun!"said Macloud, "it would be well to take some
precaution.They seem obsessed with the idea that you have the jewels,
here--and they evidently intend to get a share, if it's possible."Macloud shrugged his shoulders, helplessly.XVI

THE MARABOU MUFF


The next two weeks passed uneventfully.The thieves did not manifest
themselves, and the Government authorities did nothing to suggest that
they had been informed of the Parmenter treasure.Macloud had developed an increasing fondness for Miss Carrington's
society, which she, on her part, seemed to accept with placid
equanimity.They rode, they drove, they walked, they sailed when the
weather warranted--and the weather had recovered from its fit of the
blues, and was lazy and warm and languid.In short, they did everything
which is commonly supposed to denote a growing fondness for each
other.Croyden had been paid promptly for the Virginia Development Company
bonds, and was once more on "comfortable street," as he expressed it.But he spoke no word of returning to Northumberland.On the contrary,
he settled down to enjoy the life of the village, social and otherwise.He was nice to all the girls, but showed a marked preference for Miss
Carrington; which, however, did not trouble his friend, in the least.Macloud was quite willing to run the risk with Croyden.He was
confident that the call of the old life, the memory of the girl that
was, and that was still, would be enough to hold Geoffrey from more
than firm friendship.He was not quite sure of himself, however--that
he wanted to marry.And he was entirely sure she had not decided
whether she wanted him--that was what gave him his lease of life; if
she decided _for_ him, he knew that he would decide for her--and
quickly.Then, one day, came a letter--forwarded by the Club, where he had left
his address with instructions that it be divulged to no one.It was
dated Northumberland, and read:

  "My dear Colin--

  "It is useless, between us, to dissemble, and I'm not going to
  try it.I want to know whether Geoffrey Croyden is coming back to
  Northumberland?If he is not
  coming and there is no one else--won't you tell me where you are?(I don't ask you to reveal his address, you see.)I shall come
  down--if only for an hour, between trains--and give him his
  chance.It is radically improper, according to accepted
  notions--but notions don't bother me, when they stand (as I am
  sure they do, in this case), in the way of happiness."Sincerely,

                                           "Elaine Cavendish."At dinner, Macloud casually remarked:

"I ought to go out to Northumberland, this week, for a short time,
won't you go along?""I'm not going back to Northumberland," he said."I'll promise to come back
with you in two days at the most.""You can easily find your
way back.For me, it's easier to stay away from Northumberland, than to
go away from it, _again_."And Macloud, being wise, dropped the conversation, saying only:

"Well, I may not have to go."A little later, as he sat in the drawing-room at Carringtons', he
broached a matter which had been on his mind for some time--working
around to it gradually, with Croyden the burden of their talk.When his
opportunity came--as it was bound to do--he took it without
hesitation."Croyden had two reasons for leaving
Northumberland: one of them has been eliminated; the other is stronger
than ever.""A woman who has plenty of money--more than she can ever
spend, indeed.""What was the
trouble--wouldn't she have him?""Her money--she has so much!--So much, that, in comparison, he is a
mere pauper:--twenty millions against two hundred thousand.""If she be willing, I can't see why he is shy?""He says it is all right for a poor girl to marry a rich man, but not
for a poor man to marry a rich girl.His idea is, that the husband
should be able to maintain his wife according to her condition.To
marry else, he says, is giving hostages to fortune, and is derogatory
to that mutual respect which should exist between them.""We all give hostages to fortune when we marry!""What is it you want me to do?"she asked hastily--"or can I do
anything?""You can ask Miss Cavendish to visit you for a
few days.""Can you, by any possibility, mean Elaine Cavendish?""That's exactly who I do mean--do you know her?""After a fashion--we went to Dobbs Ferry together.""She will think it a trifle peculiar.""On the contrary, she'll think it more than kind--a positive favor.You
see, she knows I'm with Croyden, but she doesn't know where; so she
wrote to me at my Club and they forwarded it.Croyden left
Northumberland without a word--and no one is aware of his residence but
me.She asks that I tell her where _I_ am.Then she intends to come
down and give Croyden a last chance.I want to help her--and your
invitation will be right to the point--she'll jump at it.""Come, we'll work out the letter
together.""Would I not be permitted to kiss you as Miss Cavendish's deputy?""Miss Cavendish can be her own deputy," she answered.--"Moreover, it
would be premature."The second morning after, when Elaine Cavendish's maid brought her
breakfast, Miss Carrington's letter was on the tray among tradesmen's
circulars, invitations, and friendly correspondence.She did not recognize the handwriting, and the postmark was unfamiliar,
wherefore, coupled with the fact that it was addressed in a
particularly stylish hand, she opened it first.It was very brief, very
succinct, very informing, and very satisfactory."Ashburton,

                             "Hampton, Md."My dear Elaine:--

  "Mr.Macloud tells me you are contemplating coming down to the
  Eastern Shore to look for a country-place.Let me advise
  Hampton--there are some delightful old residences in this
  vicinity which positively are crying for a purchaser.Geoffrey
  Croyden, whom you know, I believe, is resident here, and is
  thinking of making it his home permanently.If you can be
  persuaded to come, you are to stay with me--the hotels are simply
  impossible, and I shall be more than delighted to have you.We
  can talk over old times at Dobbs, and have a nice little visit
  together.Don't trouble to write--just wire the time of your
  arrival--and come before the good weather departs."With lots of love,

                                          "Davila Carrington."Elaine Cavendish read the letter slowly--and smiled."Colin is rather a diplomat--he
managed it with exceeding adroitness--and the letter is admirably
worded.I'd forgotten about
Davila Carrington, and I reckon she had forgotten me, till he somehow
found it out and jogged her memory.She went to her desk and wrote this wire,
in answer:

  "Miss Davila Carrington,

       "Hampton, Md."I shall be with you Friday, on morning train.Miss Carrington showed the wire to Macloud."Now, I've done all that I can; the rest is in your hands," she said."I'll cooperate, but you are the general.""Until Elaine comes--she will manage it then," Macloud answered.And on Friday morning, a little before noon, Miss Cavendish arrived.Miss Carrington, alone, met her at the station."You're just the same Davila I'd forgotten for years," said she,
laughingly, as they walked across the platform to the waiting carriage."And you're the same I had forgotten," Davila replied."And it's just as delightful to be able to remember," was the reply.Just after they left the business section, on the drive out, Miss
Carrington saw Croyden and Macloud coming down the street.Evidently
Macloud had not been able to detain him at home until she got her
charge safely into Ashburton.She glanced at Miss Cavendish--she had
seen them, also, and, settling back into the corner of the phaeton, she
hid her face with her Marabou muff.as both men raised their
hats--and drove straight on."Who was the girl with Miss Carrington?""I noticed a bag in the trap,
however, so I reckon she's a guest.""Your opportunity, for the
solitariness of two, will be limited."It depends on what she is--I'm not
sacrificing myself on the altar of general unattractiveness.""Rest easy, I'll fuss her to the limit.You shan't have her to
plead for an excuse."I'm not worried about the guest," Macloud
remarked."There was a certain style about as much of her as I could see which
promised very well," Croyden remarked."I think this would be a good
day to drop in for tea.""And if you find her something over sixty, you'll gallantly shove her
off on me, and preempt Miss Carrington."She's not over sixty--and you know it.You're by no means as blind as
you would have me believe.In fact, now that I think of it, there was
something about her that seems familiar.""You're an adept in many things," laughed Macloud, "but, I reckon,
you're not up to recognizing a brown coat and a brown hat.I think I've
seen the combination once or twice before on a woman.""Well, what about tea-time--shall we go over?""I haven't the slightest objection----"

"Really!""----to your going along with me--I'm expected!"pretty soon it will be: 'Come over and
see us, won't you?'""I trust so," said Macloud, placidly.--"But, as you're never coming
back to Northumberland, it's a bit impossible.""I've a faint recollection of having heard that remark before.""I dare say, it's popular there on smoky days.""Which is the same as saying it's popular there any time.""No, I don't mean that; Northumberland isn't half so bad as it's
painted.We may make fun of it--but we like it, just the same.""Yes, I suppose we do," said Macloud."Though we get mighty sick of
seeing every scatterbrain who sets fire to the Great White Way branded
by the newspapers as a Northumberland millionaire.We've got our share
of fools, but we haven't a monopoly of them, by any means.""We had a marvelously large crop, however, running loose at one time,
recently!""True!--and there's the reason for it, as well as the fallacy.Because
half a hundred light-weights were made millionaires over night, and,
top heavy, straightway went the devil's pace, doesn't imply that the
entire town is mad.""It's no worse than any other big town--and
the fellows with unsavory reputations aren't representative.They just
came all in a bunch.The misfortune is, that the whole country saw the
fireworks, and it hasn't forgot the lurid display.""And isn't likely to very soon," Macloud responded, "with the whole
Municipal Government rotten to the core, councilmen falling over one
another in their eagerness to plead _nolle contendere_ and escape the
penitentiary, bankers in jail for bribery, or fighting extradition; and
graft!permeating every department of the civic life--and
published by the newspapers' broadcast, through the land, for all the
world to read, while the people, as a body, sit supine, and meekly
suffer the robbers to remain.The trouble with the Northumberlander is,
that so long as he is not the immediate victim of a hold up, he is
quiescent.Let him be touched direct--by burglary, by theft, by
embezzlement--and the yell he lets out wakes the entire bailiwick.""It's the same everywhere," said Croyden."No, it's not,--other communities have waked up--Northumberland hasn't.There is too much of the moneyed interest to be looked after; and the
councilmen know it, and are out for the stuff, as brazen as the
street-walker, and vastly more insistent.--I'm going in here, for some
cigarettes--when I come out, we'll change the talk to something less
irritating.I like Northumberland, but I despise about ninety-nine one
hundredths of its inhabitants."When he returned, Croyden was gazing after an automobile which was
disappearing in a cloud of dust."The fellow driving, unless I am mightily
fooled, is the same who stopped me on the street, in front of
Clarendon," he said."That's interesting--any one with him?""He isn't travelling around with
a petticoat--at least, if he's thinking of tackling you.""It isn't likely, I admit--but suppose he is?""He is leaving here as fast as the wheels will turn.""I've got a very accurate memory for faces," said Croyden.If it was he, and he has some new scheme, it will be
declared in due time.So long as they think you have the jewels, they will try
for them.There's Captain Carrington standing at his office door."Sitting up to grandfather-in-law!""Distinctly
proper, sir, distinctly proper!Go and chat with him; I'll stop for
you, presently."*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the two women had continued on to Ashburton.Elaine asked, dropping her muff from before her
face, when they were past the two men."It would make a difference in my--attitude toward him when we met!"The
fact that Croyden did not come out and stop them, that he let them go
on, was sufficient proof that he had not recognized her."You see, I am assuming that you know why I wanted to come to Hampton,"
Elaine said, when, her greeting made to Mrs.Carrington, she had
carried Davila along to her room."And you made it very easy for me to come.""I did as I thought you would want--and as I know you would do with me
were I in a similar position.""I'm sadly afraid I should not have thought of you, were you----"

"Oh, yes, you would!If you had been in a small town, and Mr.Croyden
had told you of my difficulty----"

"As _Mr.Macloud_ told you of mine--I see, dear.""Not exactly that," said Davila, blushing.Macloud has been very
attentive and very nice and all that, you know, but you mustn't forget
there are not many girls here, and I'm convenient, and--I don't take
him seriously.""I don't know--sometimes I think he does, and sometimes I think he
doesn't!""He is an accomplished flirt and difficult to
gauge.""Well, let me tell you one fact, for your information: there isn't a
more indifferent man in Northumberland.He goes everywhere, is in great
demand, is enormously popular, yet, I've never known him to have even
an affair.He is armor-plated--but he is a dear, a perfect dear,
Davila!"she said, with heightening color--and Elaine said no more,
then.Croyden alone, for the first time, or in
company?""I confess I don't know, but I think, however, it would be better to
have a few words with Colin, first--if it can be arranged."Macloud is to come in a moment before
luncheon, if he can find an excuse that will not include Mr."Is an excuse difficult to find--or is any, even, needed?""He doesn't usually come before four--that's the tea hour in Hampton.""If you've got him into the tea habit, you can
do what you want with him--he will eat out of your hand.""I never tried him with tea," said Davila."He chose a high ball the
first time--so it's been a high ball ever since."Elaine sat down on the couch and put her arm about Davila."But we shall be good friends, better
friends than ever, Davila, when you come to Northumberland to live.""That is just the question, Elaine," was the quick answer; "whether I
shall be given the opportunity, and whether I shall take it, if I am.I
haven't let it go so far, because I don't feel sure of him.Until I do,
I intend to keep tight hold on myself."Just before luncheon, Macloud arrived."I'm glad to see
you here.""Yes, I'm here, thanks to you," said Elaine--and Davila not being
present, she kissed him."No--but I wish the other--would, too!""You're not wont to be so timid," she returned."I wish I had some of your bravery," he said."Isn't it impetuous womanliness."There isn't a doubt as to his feelings.""But there is a doubt as to his letting them control--I see."And you alone can help him solve it--if any one can.And I have
great hopes, Elaine, great hopes!""How any chap could resist you is inconceivable--I could not.""You could not at one time, you mean.""You gave me no encouragement,--so I must, perforce, fare elsewhere.""How many love affairs have you come down here to settle?""By the way, Croyden is impatient to come over this afternoon.The
guest in the trap with Miss Carrington has aroused his curiosity.He
could see only a long brown coat and a brown hat, but the muff before
your face, and his imagination, did the rest."It's simply the country town beginning to tell
on him.He is curious about new guests, and Miss Carrington hadn't
mentioned your coming!He suggested, in a vague sort of way, that there
was something familiar about you, but he didn't attempt to
particularize."I think not--we shall all be present.""And _how_ shall you meet him?""I reckon you don't know much about it--haven't any plans?"He will know why I'm
here, and whether he is glad or sorry or displeased at my coming, I
shall know instantly.It's absurd, this
notion of his, and why let it rule him and me!I've always got what I
wanted, and I'm going to get Geoffrey.A Queen of a Nation must propose
to a suitor, so why not a Queen of Money to a man less rich than
she--especially when she is convinced that that alone keeps them apart.I shall give him a chance to propose to me first; several chances,
indeed!""Then, if he doesn't respond--I shall do it
myself."XVII

A HANDKERCHIEF AND A GLOVE


Miss Cavendish was standing behind the curtains in the window of her
room, when Croyden and Macloud came up the walk, at four o'clock.She was waiting!--not another touch to be given to her attire.Her
gown, of shimmering blue silk, clung to her figure with every movement,
and fell to the floor in suggestively revealing folds.Her dark hair
was arranged in simple fashion--the simplicity of exquisite
taste--making the fair face below it, seem fairer even than it was.She heard them enter the lower hall, and pass into the drawing-room.She glided out to the stairway, and stood, peering down over the
balustrade.She heard Miss Carrington's greeting and theirs--heard
Macloud's chuckle, and Croyden's quiet laugh.Then she heard Macloud
say:

"Mr.Croyden is anxious to meet your guest--at least, we took her to be
a guest you were driving with this morning.""My guest is equally anxious to meet Mr.Croyden," Miss Carrington
replied."Did you ever know a woman to be ready?"Croyden imagined there was something familiar about her," Macloud
remarked.(Elaine strained her ears to catch his answer.)"She didn't let me have the chance to recognize her," said he--"she
wouldn't let me see her face."(Elaine gave a little sigh of relief.)"She couldn't have covered it completely--she saw you.""She can't--I'm on the pinnacle of expectation, now.""Humpty-Dumpty risks a great fall!""If the guest doesn't please me, I'm going
to talk to Miss Carrington.""You're growing blase," she warned."If it is, I know one who must
be too blase even to move," with a meaning glance at Macloud.A light foot-fall on the stairs, the soft swish of skirts in the
hallway, Croyden turned, expectantly--and Miss Cavendish entered the
room.Croyden's from astonishment; the
others' with watching him.Elaine's eyes were intent on Croyden's face--and what she saw there
gave her great content: he might not be persuaded, but he loved her,
and he would not misunderstand.Her face brightened with a fascinating
smile."You are surprised to see me, messieurs?"Croyden's eyes turned quickly to his friend, and back again."I'm not so sure as to Monsieur Macloud," he said."Surprised is quite too light a word--stunned would but meekly express
it.""Did neither of you ever hear me mention Miss Carrington?--We were
friends, almost chums, at Dobbs Ferry.""If I did, it has escaped me?""Well, you're likely not to forget it again.""Did you know that I--that we were here?"I knew that you and Colin were both here," Elaine replied,
imperturbably."Do you think yourself so unimportant as not to be
mentioned by Miss Carrington?""What will you have to drink, Mr.she asked--while Elaine and Macloud
laughed."You said you would take a _sour_ ball."A man who mixes a
high ball with a sour ball is either rattled or drunk, I am not the
latter, therefore----"

"You mean that my coming has rattled you?""Yes--I'm rattled for very joy.""You could spare a few--and not miss them!"said Macloud, handing him the glass."Sweetened by your touch, I suppose!"By the ladies' presence--God save them!""Colin," said Croyden, as, an hour later, they walked back to
Clarendon, "you should have told me.""Don't affect ignorance, old man--you knew Elaine was coming.""And that it was she in the trap.""The muff hid her face from me, too.""Do you think it was wise to let her come?""I had nothing to do with her decision.Miss Carrington asked her, she
accepted.""Didn't you give her my address?"Croyden looked at him, doubtfully."I'm telling you the truth," said Macloud."She tried to get your
address, when I was last in Northumberland, and I refused.""And then, she stumbles on it through Davila Carrington!I reckon, if I went off into some deserted spot in Africa, it
wouldn't be a month until some fellow I knew, or who knows a mutual
friend, would come nosing around, and blow on me."I'm not sorry she came--at least, not now, since she's here.--I'll
be sorry enough when she goes, however.""I must--it's the only proper thing to do.""Would it not be better that _she_ should decide what is proper for
her?""Based on your peculiar notion of relative wealth between husband and
wife--without regard to what she may think on the subject.In other
words, have you any right to decline the risk, if she is willing to
undertake it?"Her income, for three
months, about equals my entire fortune.""And live at the rate of pretty near two hundred thousand dollars a
year?""I think I could, if I loved the girl.""And suffer in your self-respect forever after?"If you
play _your_ part, you won't lose your self-respect.""It is a trifle difficult to do--to play my part, when all the world is
saying, 'he married her for her money,' and shows me scant regard in
consequence.""Why the devil need you care what the world says!""I don't--the world may go hang.But the question is, how long can the
man retain the woman's esteem, with such a handicap.""It depends entirely on yourself.--If you start with it, you can hold
it, if you take the trouble to try."Croyden laughed, as they entered
Clarendon."Just what I should like to know----"

"Well, I'll tell you what you are if you don't marry Elaine Cavendish,"
Macloud interrupted--"You're an unmitigated fool!""Assuming that Miss Cavendish would marry me.""You're not likely to marry her, otherwise," retorted Macloud, as he
went up the stairs.On the landing he halted and looked down at Croyden
in the hall below."And if you don't take your chance, the chance she
has deliberately offered you by coming to Hampton, you are worse
than----" and, with an expressive gesture, he resumed the ascent."How do you know she came down here just for that purpose?"But all that came back in answer, as Macloud went down the hall and
into his room, was the whistled air from a popular opera, then running
in the Metropolis."Ev'ry little movement has a meaning all its own,
          Ev'ry thought and action----"

The door slammed--the music ceased."I won't believe it," Croyden reflected, "that Elaine would do anything
so utterly unconventional as to seek me out deliberately.... I might
have had a chance if--Oh, damn it all!why didn't we find the old
pirate's box--it would have clarified the whole situation."As he changed into his evening clothes, he went over the matter,
carefully, and laid out the line of conduct that he intended to
follow.He would that Elaine had stayed away from Hampton.It was putting him
to too severe a test--to be with her, to be subject to her alluring
loveliness, and, yet, to be unmoved.It is hard to see the luscious
fruit within one's reach and to refrain from even touching it.It grew
harder the more he contemplated it....

"It's no use fighting against it, here!"he exclaimed, going into
Macloud's room, and throwing himself on a chair."I'm going to cut the
whole thing."Macloud inquired, pausing with
his waistcoat half on."What the devil do you think I'm talking about?""Not being a success at solving riddles, I give it up.""Can you comprehend this:--I'm going to
leave town?""He is coming to it, at last," he thought.What he said was:--"You're
not going to be put to flight by a woman?""I am.--If I stay here I shall lose.""Most people would not call that _losing_," said Macloud."I have nothing to do with most people--only, with myself.""It seems so!--even Elaine isn't to be considered.""Haven't we gone over all that?""I don't know--but, if we have, go over it again.""You assume she came down here solely on my account--because I'm
here?""I assume nothing," Macloud answered, with a quiet chuckle."I said you
have a chance, and urged you not to let it slip.I should not have
offered any suggestion--I admit that----"

"Oh, bosh!""Don't be so humble--you're rather
proud of your interference."I'm only sorry it is so unavailing.""You did!--or, at least, I inferred as much.""I'm not responsible for your inferences."Nothing!--not even for my resolution--I haven't any--I can't
make any that holds.Desire clamors for me to stay--to hasten over to Ashburton--to
put it to the test.When I get to Ashburton, common sense will be in
control.When I come away, desire will tug me back, again--and so on,
and so on--and so on.""You need a cock-tail, instead
of a weather-cock.if we are to dine at the Carringtons' at
seven, we would better be moving.Having thrown the blue funk, usual to
a man in your position, you'll now settle down to business.""Let future events determine--take it as it comes," Macloud urged."If I let future events
decide for me, the end's already fixed."The big clock on the landing was chiming seven when they rang the bell
at Ashburton and the maid ushered them into the drawing-room.Carrington was out of town, visiting in an adjoining county, and the
Captain had not appeared.He came down stairs a moment later, and took
Macloud and Croyden over to the library.After about a quarter of an hour, he glanced at his watch a trifle
impatiently.--Another fifteen minutes, and he glanced at it again.he called, as the maid passed the door."Go up to Miss
Davila's room and tell her it's half-after-seven."Then he continued with the story he was relating.Presently, the maid returned; the Captain looked at her,
interrogatingly."Mis' Davila, she ain' deah, no seh," said the girl."She is probably in Miss Cavendish's room,--look, there, for her," the
Captain directed.I looks dyar--she ain' no place up stairs, and neither is
Mis' Cav'dish, seh.Hit's all dark, in dey rooms, seh, all dark.""Half-after-seven, and not here?""They were here, two hours ago," said Croyden."Find out from the other servants whether they left any word."excuse me, sirs, I'll try to locate them."He went to the telephone, and called up the Lashiels, the Tilghmans,
the Tayloes, and all their neighbors and intimates, only to receive the
same answer: "They were not there, and hadn't been there that
afternoon.""We are at your service, Captain Carrington," said Macloud
instantly.--"At your service for anything we can do.""They knew, of course, you were expected for dinner?"he asked, as he
led the way upstairs.--"I can't account for it."The Captain inspected his granddaughter's and Miss Cavendish's rooms,
Macloud and Croyden, being discreet, the rooms on the other side of the
house."We will have dinner," said the Captain."They will surely turn up
before we have finished."The dinner ended, however, and the missing ones had not returned."Might they have gone for a drive?""The keys of the stable are on my desk,
which shows that the horses are in for the night.I admit I am at a
loss--however, I reckon they will be in presently, with an explanation
and a good laugh at us for being anxious."But when nine o'clock came, and then half-after-nine, and still they
did not appear, the men grew seriously alarmed.The Captain had recourse to the telephone again, getting residence
after residence, without result."I don't know what to make of it," he said, bewildered."I've called
every place I can think of, and I can't locate them."Let us see how the matter stands," said Macloud."We left them here
about half-after-five, and, so far as can be ascertained, no one has
seen them since.Consequently, they must have gone out for a walk or a
drive.A drive is most unlikely, at this time of the day--it is dark
and cold.Furthermore, your horses are in the stable, so, if they went,
they didn't go alone--some one drove them.The alternative--a walk--is
the probable explanation; and that remits us to an accident as the
cause of delay.Which, it seems to me, is the likely explanation.""But if there were an accident, they would have been discovered, long
since; the walks are not deserted," the Captain objected."Possibly, they went out of the town.""A young woman never goes out of town, unescorted," was the decisive
answer."This is a Southern town, you know.""I suppose you don't care to telephone the police?""No--not yet," the Captain replied."Davila would never forgive me, if
nothing really were wrong--besides, I couldn't.The Mayor's office is
closed for the night--we're not supposed to need the police after six
o'clock.""Then Croyden and I will patrol the roads, hereabout," said Macloud.I will go out the Queen Street pike a mile or two," the Captain
said.Croyden can take the King Street pike, North and
South.We'll meet here not later than eleven o'clock.Excuse me a
moment----"

"What do you make of it?""It is either very serious or else it's nothing at all.I mean, if
anything _has_ happened, it's far out of the ordinary," Croyden
answered."Exactly my idea--though, I confess, I haven't a notion what the
serious side could be.It's safe to assume that they didn't go into the
country--the hour, alone, would have deterred them, even if the danger
from the <DW64> were not present, constantly, in Miss Carrington's mind.On the other hand, how could anything have happened in the town which
would prevent one of them from telephoning, or sending a message, or
getting some sort of word to the Captain.""It's all very mysterious--yet, I dare say, easy of solution and
explanation.There isn't any danger of the one thing that is really
terrifying, so I'm not inclined to be alarmed, unduly--just
disquieted."take these," he said, giving each a revolver."Let us hope there
won't be any occasion to use them, but it is well to be prepared."They went out together--at the intersection of Queen and King Streets,
they parted.eleven o'clock at my house," said the Captain."If any one
of us isn't there, the other two will know he needs assistance."It was a chilly November night, with
frost in the air.The moon, in its second quarter and about to sink
into the waters of the Bay, gave light sufficient to make walking easy,
where the useless street lamps did not kill it with their timid
brilliancy.He passed the limits of the town, and struck out into the
country.It had just struck ten, when they parted--he would walk for
half an hour, and then return.He could do three miles--a mile and a
half each way--and still be at the Carrington house by eleven.He
proceeded along the east side of the road, his eyes busy lest, in the
uncertain light, he miss anything which might serve as a clue.For the
allotted time, he searched but found nothing--he must return.He
crossed to the west side of the road, and faced homeward.A mile passed--a quarter more was added--the feeble lights of the town
were gleaming dimly in the fore, when, beside the track, he noticed a
small white object.It was a woman's handkerchief, and, as he picked it up, a faint odor of
violets was clinging to it still.Here might be a clue--there was a
monogram on the corner, but he could not distinguish it, in the
darkness.He put it in his pocket and hastened on.A hundred feet
farther, and his foot hit something soft.He groped about, with his
hands, and found--a woman's glove.It, also, bore the odor of violets.At the first lamp-post, he stopped and examined the handkerchief--the
monogram was plain: E.C.--and violets, he remembered, were her
favorite perfume.He took out the glove--a soft, undressed kid
affair--but there was no mark on it to help him.He pushed the feminine trifles back
into his pocket, and hurried on.He was late, and when he arrived at Ashburton, Captain Carrington and
Macloud were just about to start in pursuit.he said, tossing the glove and the handkerchief on the
table--"on the west side of the road, about half a mile from town.""The violets are familiar--and the handkerchief is Elaine's," said he."I'm going to call in our friends," he said.XVIII

THE LONE HOUSE BY THE BAY


When Croyden and Macloud left the Carrington residence that evening,
after their call and tea, Elaine and Davila remained for a little while
in the drawing-room rehearsing the events of the day, as women will.Presently, Davila went over to draw the shades."What do you say to a walk before we dress for dinner?""I should like it, immensely," Elaine answered.They went upstairs, changed quickly to street attire, and set out."We will go down to the centre of the town and back," said Davila."It's about half a mile each way, and there isn't any danger, so long
as you keep in the town.I shouldn't venture beyond it unescorted,
however, even in daylight."It's the curse that hangs over the South
since the Civil War: the <DW64>.""I don't mean that all black men are bad, for they are not.Many are
entirely trustworthy, but the trustworthy ones are much, very much, in
the minority.The vast majority are worthless--and a worthless <DW65>
is the worst thing on earth.""I think I prefer only the lighted streets," Elaine remarked."And you will be perfectly safe there," Davila replied.They swung briskly along to the centre of the town--where the two main
thoroughfares, King and Queen Streets, met each other in a wide circle
that, after the fashion of Southern towns, was known, incongruously
enough, as "The Diamond."Passing around this circle, they retraced
their steps toward home.As they neared Ashburton, an automobile with the top up and side
curtains on shot up behind them, hesitated a moment, as though
uncertain of its destination and then drew up before the Carrington
place.Two men alighted, gave an order to the driver, and went across
the pavement to the gate, while the engine throbbed, softly.Then they seemed to notice the women approaching, and stepping back
from the gate, they waited.said one, raising his hat and bowing, "can you
tell me if this is where Captain Carrington lives?"said the man, standing aside to let them pass."I am Miss Carrington--whom do you wish to see?""Captain Carrington, is he at home?""I do not know--if you will come in, I'll inquire."Davila thanked him with a smile,
and she and Elaine went in, leaving the strangers to follow.The next instant, each girl was struggling in the folds of a shawl,
which had been flung over her from behind and wrapped securely around
her head and arms, smothering her cries to a mere whisper.In a trice,
despite their struggles--which, with heads covered and arms held close
to their sides, were utterly unavailing--they were caught up, tossed
into the tonneau, and the car shot swiftly away.In a moment, it was clear of the town, the driver "opened her up," and
they sped through the country at thirty miles an hour."Better give them some air," said the leader."It doesn't matter how
much they yell here."He had been holding Elaine on his lap, his arms keeping the shawl tight
around her.Now he loosed her, and unwound the folds."You will please pardon the liberty we have taken," he said, as he
freed her, "but there are----"

Crack!Elaine had struck him straight in the face with all her strength, and,
springing free, was on the point of leaping out, when he seized her
and forced her back, caught her arms in the shawl, which was still
around her, and bound them tight to her side."I got an upper cut on the
jaw that made me see stars.""I've been very easy with mine," his companion returned.However, he took care not to loosen the shawl from her
arms."There you are, my lady, I hope you've not been greatly
inconvenienced.""Don't forget, Bill!--mum's the word!""At least, you can permit us to sit on the floor of the car," said
Elaine."Whatever may be your scheme, it's scarcely necessary to hold
us in this disgusting position.""I reckon that is a trifle overstated!""What about you,
Miss Carrington?"Davila did not answer--contenting herself with a look, which was far
more expressive than words."Well, we will take pleasure in honoring your first request, Miss
Cavendish."He caught up a piece of rope, passed it around her arms, outside the
shawl, tied it in a running knot, and quietly lifted her from his lap
to the floor."Do you, Miss Carrington, wish to sit beside your
friend?"He took the rope and tied her, likewise.he said, and they placed her beside Elaine."If you will permit your legs to be tied, we will gladly let you have
the seat----"

"No!----"

"Well, I didn't think you would--so you will have to remain on the
floor; you see, you might be tempted to jump, if we gave you the
seat."They were running so rapidly, through the night air, that the country
could scarcely be distinguished, as it rushed by them.To Elaine, it
was an unknown land.Davila, however, was looking for something she
could recognize--some building that she knew, some stream, some
topographical formation.But in the faint and uncertain moonlight,
coupled with the speed at which they travelled, she was baffled.he said, and taking two handkerchiefs from his
pocket, he bound the eyes of both."It is only for a short while," he explained--"matter of an hour or
so, and you suffer no particular inconvenience, I trust."Neither Elaine nor Davila condescended to reply.After a moment's pause, the man went on:

"I neglected to say--and I apologize for my remissness--that you need
fear no ill-treatment.You will be shown every consideration--barring
freedom, of course--and all your wants, within the facilities at our
command, will be gratified.Naturally, however, you will not be
permitted to communicate with your friends.""But I should be better pleased if you
would tell us the reason for this abduction.""That, I regret, I am not at liberty to discuss.""And if it is not acceded to?""In that event--it would be necessary to decide what should be done
with you.""Nothing!--the time hasn't come to imply--I hope it will not come.""Do you mean that your failure would imperil our lives?""Is it possible you mean to threaten our lives?""But you will threaten,
if----"

"Exactly!if--you are at liberty to guess the rest.""Do you appreciate that the
whole Eastern Shore will be searching for us by morning--and that, if
the least indignity is offered us, your lives won't be worth a penny?""We take the risk, Miss Carrington," replied the man, placidly.Davila shrugged her shoulders, and they rode in silence, for half an
hour.Then the speed of the car slackened, they ran slowly for half a mile,
and stopped.The chief reached down, untied the handkerchiefs, and
sprang out."You may descend," he said, offering his hand.Elaine saw the hand, and ignored it; Davila refused even to see the
hand.They could make out, in the dim light, that they were before a long,
low, frame building, with the waters of the Bay just beyond.A light
burned within, and, as they entered, the odor of cooking greeted them."I
suppose it's scarcely proper in an abducted maiden, but I'm positively
famished.""I'm too enraged to eat," said Davila."Afraid?--not in the least!""No more am I--but oughtn't we be afraid?"They had been halted on the porch, while the chief went in, presumably,
to see that all was ready for their reception."If you will come in," he said, "I will show you to your apartment.""Prison, you mean," said Davila."Apartment is a little better word, don't you think?""However, as you wish, Miss Carrington, as you wish!We shall try to
make you comfortable, whatever you may call your temporary
quarters.--These two rooms are yours," he continued, throwing open the
door."They are small, but quiet and retired; you will not, I am sure,
be disturbed.Pardon me, if I remove these ropes, you will be less
hampered in your movements.supper will be served in fifteen
minutes--you will be ready?""Yes, we shall be ready," said Elaine, and the man bowed and retired."They might be worse," Davila retorted."Yes!--and we best be thankful for it.""The rooms aren't so bad," said Elaine, looking around."We each have a bed, and a bureau, and a wash-stand, and a couple of
chairs, a few chromos, a rug on the floor--and bars at the window.""I noticed the bars," said Davila."They've provided us with water, so we may as well use it," she said."I think my face needs--Heavens!"Haven't you observed the same sight in me?""I've lost
all my puffs, I know--and so have you--and your hat is a trifle awry.""Since we're not trying to make an impression, I reckon it doesn't
matter!""We will have ample opportunity to put them to
rights before Colin and Geoffrey see us."She took off her hat, pressed her hair into shape, replaced a few pins,
dashed water on her face, and washed her hands."Now," she said, going into the other room where Miss Carrington was
doing likewise, "if I only had a powder-rag, I'd feel dressed."Davila turned, and, taking a little book, from the pocket of her coat,
extended it."Here is some Papier Poudre," she said.Elaine exclaimed, and, tearing out a sheet, she
rubbed it over her face.A door opened and a young girl appeared, wearing apron and cap.said Elaine as she saw the table, with its candles and
silver (plated, to be sure), dainty china, and pressed glass."If the food is in keeping, I think we can get along for a few days.We
may as well enjoy it while it lasts.""You always were of a philosophic mind."She might have added, that it was the only way she knew--her wealth
having made all roads easy to her.The meal finished, they went back to their apartment, to find the bed
turned down for the night, and certain lingerie, which they were
without, laid out for them."You might think this was a
hotel.""We haven't tried, yet--wait until morning."A pack of cards was on the
table.Come, I'll play you Camden for a
cent a point.""I can't understand what their move is?""What
can they hope to accomplish by abducting us--or me, at any rate.It
seems they don't want anything from us.""I make it, that they hope to extort something, from a third party,
through us--by holding us prisoners.""Captain Carrington has no money--it can't be he," said Davila, "and
yet, why else should they seize me?""The question is, whose hand are they trying to force?""They will hold us until something is acceded to, the man said.Until _what_ is acceded to, and _by whom_?""You think that we are simply the pawns?""And if it isn't acceded to, they will kill us?""We won't contemplate it, just yet.They may gain their point, or we may
be rescued; in either case, we'll be saved from dying!""And, at the worst, I may be able to buy them off--to pay our own
ransom.If it's money they want, we shall not die, I assure you.""If I have to choose between death and paying, I reckon I'll pay.""Yes, I think I can pay," she said quietly."I'm not used to boasting
my wealth, but I can draw my check for a million, and it will be
honored without a moment's question.Does that make you feel easier, my
dear?""Considerably easier," said Davila, with a glad laugh."I couldn't draw
my check for much more than ten thousand cents.I am only----" She
stopped, staring."What on earth is the matter, Davila?""I have it!--it's the thieves!""I reckon I must be in a trance,
also.""Then maybe I shouldn't--but I will.Parmenter's chest is a fortune in
jewels."Croyden has searched for and not
found--and the thieves think----"

"You would better tell me the story," said Elaine, pushing back the
cards.And Davila told her....

"It is too absurd!"laughed Elaine, "those rogues trying to force
Geoffrey to divide what he hasn't got, and can't find, and we abducted
to constrain him.He couldn't comply if he wanted to, poor fellow!""But they will never believe it," said Davila.Well, if we're not rescued shortly, I can
advance the price and buy our freedom.I
reckon two hundred thousand will be sufficient--and, maybe, we can
compromise for one hundred thousand.it's not so bad, Davila, it's
not so bad!"Unless she were wofully mistaken, this abduction
would release her from the embarrassment of declaring herself to
Geoffrey."I was thinking of Colin and Geoffrey--and how they are pretty sure to
know their minds when this affair is ended."I mean, if this doesn't bring Colin to his senses, he is
hopeless."All his theoretical notions of relative wealth
will be forgotten.I've only to wait for rescue or release.On the
whole, Davila, I'm quite satisfied with being abducted.Moreover, it is
an experience which doesn't come to every girl.""What are you going to do about Colin?I rather
think you should have an answer ready; the circumstances are apt to
make him rather precipitate."The next morning after breakfast, which was served in their rooms,
Elaine was looking out through the bars on her window, trying to get
some notion of the country, when she saw, what she took to be, the
chief abductor approaching.He was a tall, well-dressed man of middle
age, with the outward appearance of a gentleman.She looked at him a
moment, then rang for the maid."I should like to have a word with the man who just came in," she
said.He appeared almost immediately, an inquiring look on his face."How can I serve you, Miss Cavendish?""By permitting us to go out for some air--these rooms were not
designed, apparently, for permanent residence.""You will have no objection to being attended, to
make sure you don't stray off too far, you know?""None whatever, if the attendant remains at a reasonable distance."Elaine asked, when they were some distance
from the house."It is south of Hampton, I think, but I can't
give any reason for my impression.The car was running very rapidly; we
were, I reckon, almost two hours on the way, but we can't be more than
fifty miles away.""If they came direct--but if they circled, we could be much less,"
Elaine observed."It's a pity we didn't think to drop something from the car to inform
our friends which way to look for us.""I tossed out a handkerchief and a glove a short
distance from Hampton--just as I struck that fellow.The difficulty is,
there isn't any assurance we kept to that road.Like as not, we started
north and ended east or south of town.What is this house, a fishing
club?"There is a small wharf, and a board-walk down to
the Bay, and the house itself is one story and spread-out, so to
speak.""Likely it's a summer club-house, which these men have either rented or
preempted for our prison.""Hence, a proper choice for our temporary residence.""I can't understand the care they are taking of us--the deference with
which we are treated, the food that is given us.""Parmenter's treasure, and the prize they think they're playing for,
has much to do with it.We are of considerable value, according to
their idea."After a while, they went back to the house.The two men, who had
remained out of hearing, but near enough to prevent any attempt to
escape, having seen them safely within, disappeared.As they passed
through the hall they encountered the chief."You are incurring considerable expense for nothing.""It is a very great pleasure, I assure you.""You are asking the impossible," she went on.Croyden told you
the simple truth.He _didn't_ find the Parmenter jewels."The man's face showed his surprise, but he only shrugged his shoulders
expressively, and made no reply."I know you do not believe it--yet it's a fact, nevertheless.Croyden couldn't pay your demands, if he wished.Of course, we enjoy
the experience, but, as I said, it's a trifle expensive for you."he said--"a jolly good sport!Macloud, so, you'll pardon me if I decline to
discuss the subject."XIX

ROBERT PARMENTER'S SUCCESSORS


In half-an-hour from the time Captain Carrington strode to the
telephone to arouse his friends, all Hampton had the startling news:
Davila Carrington and her guest, Miss Cavendish, had disappeared.How, when, and where, it could not learn, so it supplied the deficiency
as best pleased the individual--by morning, the wildest tales were
rehearsed and credited.Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish
were not in the town, nor anywhere within a circuit of five miles.Croyden, Macloud, all the men in the place had searched the night
through, and without avail.Every horse, and every boat had been
accounted for.It remained, that they either had fallen into the Bay,
or had gone in a strange conveyance.Croyden and Macloud had returned to Clarendon for a bite of
breakfast--very late breakfast, at eleven o'clock.They had met by
accident, on their way to the house, having come from totally different
directions of search."Parmenter:--Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.I told you it was he I saw, yesterday, driving the
automobile.""I don't quite understand why they selected Elaine and Miss Carrington
to abduct," Macloud objected, after a moment's consideration."Because they thought we would come to time more quickly, if they took
the women.They seem to be informed on everything, so, we can assume,
they are acquainted with your fondness for Miss Carrington and mine for
Elaine.Or, it's possible they thought that we both were interested in
Davila--for I've been with her a lot this autumn--and then, at the
pinch, were obliged to take Elaine, also, because she was with her and
would give the alarm if left behind.""A pretty fair scheme," said Macloud."The fellow who is managing this
business knew we would do more for the women than for ourselves.""It's the same old difficulty--we haven't got Parmenter's treasure, but
they refuse to be convinced."The telephone rang, and Croyden himself answered it."Captain Carrington asks that we come over at once," he said, hanging
up the receiver.Half way to the gate, they
met the postman coming up the walk.He handed Croyden a letter, faced
about and trudged away.Croyden glanced at it, mechanically tore open the envelope, and drew it
out.As his eyes fell on the first line, he stopped, abruptly."On Board The Parmenter,
                                      "Pirate Sloop of War,
                             "Off the Capes of the Chesapeake."Dear Sir:--

  "It seems something is required to persuade you that we mean
  business.Therefore, we have abducted Miss Carrington and her
  friend, Miss Cavendish, in the hope that it will rouse you to a
  proper realization of the eternal fitness of things, and of our
  intention that there shall be a division of the jewels--or their
  value in money.Our attorney had the pleasure of an interview
  with you, recently, at which time he specified a sum of two
  hundred and fifty thousand dollars, as being sufficient.A
  further investigation of the probable value of the jewels, having
  convinced us that we were in slight error as to their present
  worth, induces us to reduce the amount, which we claim as our
  share, to two hundred thousand dollars.This is the minimum of
  our demand, however, and we have taken the ladies, aforesaid, as
  security for its prompt payment."They will be held in all comfort and respect (if no effort at
  rescue be attempted--otherwise we will deal with them as we see
  fit), for the period of ten days from the receipt of this letter,
  which will be at noon to-morrow.If the sum indicated is not
  paid, they will, at the expiration of the ten days, be turned
  over to the tender mercies of the crew.--Understand?"As to the manner of payment--You, yourself, must go to
  Annapolis, and, between eleven and twelve in the morning, proceed
  to the extreme edge of Greenberry Point and remain standing, in
  full view from the Bay, for the space of fifteen minutes.You
  will, then, face about, step ten paces, and bury the money, which
  must be in thousand dollar bills, under a foot of sand.You will
  then, immediately, return to Annapolis and take the first car to
  Baltimore, and, thence, to Hampton."In the event that you have not reduced the jewels to cash, we
  will be content with such a division as will insure us a moiety
  thereof.It will be useless to try deception concerning
  them,--though a few thousand dollars, one way or the other, won't
  matter.When you have complied with these terms, the young women
  will be released and permitted to return to Hampton.If not--they
  will wish they were dead, even before they are.We are, sir, with
  deep respect,

                       "Y'r h'mbl.serv'ts,

                               "Robert Parmenter's Successors."Geoffrey Croyden, Esq'r.It was postmarked Hampton, 6.30 A.M.,
of that day."Which implies that it was mailed some time during the night," said
he."Do you mean, will they carry out their threat?""They have been rather persistent," Macloud replied.Damn
Parmenter and his infernal letter!""Parmenter is not to blame," said Macloud."And damn my carelessness in letting them pick my pocket!"Well, the thing, now, is to save the women--and how?""The two hundred thousand I got
for the Virginia Development bonds will be just enough.""I'm in for half, old man.Aside from any personal
feelings we may have for the women in question," he said, with a
serious sort of smile, "we owe it to them--they were abducted solely
because of us--to force us to disgorge.""I'm ready to pay the cash at once.""We have ten days, and the police
can take a try at it.""They're
all bunglers--they will be sure to make a mess of it, and, then, no man
can foresee what will happen.It's not right to subject the women to
the risk.Let us pay first, and punish after--if we can catch the
scoundrels.How long do you think Henry Cavendish will hesitate when he
learns that Elaine has been abducted, and the peril which menaces
her?""Just what he shouldn't be," Croyden returned."What is the good in
alarming him?Free her--then she may tell him, or not, as it pleases
her.""Our first duty _is_ to save the women, the rest can
bide until they are free."Much obliged, old man," said Croyden, "but a wire will do it--they're
all listed on New York.""Will you lose much, if you sell now?"He wished Croyden
would let him pay the entire amount."Just about even; a little to the good, in fact," was the answer.And Macloud said no more--he knew it was useless.At Ashburton, they found Captain Carrington pacing the long hall, in
deep distress--uncertain what course to pursue, because there was no
indication as to what had caused the disappearance.He turned, as the
two men entered."The detectives are quizzing the servants in the library," he said."I
couldn't sit still.--You have news?"he exclaimed, reading Croyden's
face.said Croyden, and gave him the letter.As he read, concern, perplexity, amazement, anger, all
showed in his countenance."They have been abducted!--Davila and Miss Cavendish, and are held for
ransom!--a fabulous ransom, which you are asked to pay," he said,
incredulously."So much, at least, is intelligible.Who
are Robert Parmenter's Successors?--and who was he?and the jewels?--I
cannot understand----"

"I'm not surprised," said Croyden."It's a long story--too long to
tell--save that Parmenter was a pirate, back in 1720, who buried a
treasure on Greenberry Point, across the Severn from Annapolis, you
know, and died, making Marmaduke Duval his heir, under certain
conditions.Marmaduke, in turn, passed it on to his son, and so on,
until Colonel Duval bequeathed it to me.Macloud and
I--for three weeks, but did not find it.Our secret was chanced upon by
two rogues, who, with their confederates, however, are under the
conviction we _did_ find it.I laughed at
them--and this abduction is the result.""Because they think I can be coerced more easily.They are under the
impression that I am--fond of Miss Carrington.At any rate, they know
I'm enough of a friend to pay, rather than subject her to the hazard."My whole fortune isn't over twenty thousand dollars.It I will gladly sacrifice, but more is impossible.""You're not to pay, my old friend," said Croyden.Macloud and I
are the ones aimed at and we will pay.""There is no reason
for you----"

"Tut!said Croyden, "you forget that we are wholly responsible;
but for us, Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish would not have been
abducted.The obligation is ours, and we will discharge it.It is our
plain, our very plain, duty."The old man threw up his hands in the extremity of despair.We'll have Miss Carrington back in
three days.""And safe--if the letter is trustworthy, and I think it is.The police
can't do as well--they may fail entirely--and think of the possible
consequences!Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish are very handsome
women."If they were
men, or children, it would be different--they could take some chances.--He sank on a chair and covered his face with his hands."You must let me pay what I am able," he insisted."All that I
have----"

Croyden let his hand fall sympathizingly on the other's shoulder."It shall be as you wish," he said quietly."We will pay, and you can
settle with us afterward--our stocks can be converted instantly, you
see, while yours will likely require some time.""I've been sort of unmanned--I'm better now.Shall you show the detectives the letter--tell them we are going to pay
the amount demanded?""I don't know," said Croyden, uncertainly."What's your opinion,
Colin?""Let them see the letter," Macloud answered, "but on the distinct
stipulation, that they make no effort to apprehend 'Robert Parmenter's
Successors' until the women are safely returned.They may pick up
whatever clues they can obtain for after use, but they must not do
anything which will arouse suspicion, even.""Why take them into our confidence at all?""For two reasons: It's acting square with them (which, it seems to me,
is always the wise thing to do).And, if they are not let in on the
facts, they may blunder in and spoil everything.We want to save the
women at the earliest moment, without any possible handicaps due to
ignorance or inadvertence.""We will have to explain the letter, its reference to the Parmenter
jewels, and all that it contains."We didn't find the treasure, and, I reckon,
they're welcome to search, if they think there is a chance.""Well, let it be exactly as you wish--you're quite as much concerned
for success as I am," said Croyden."Possibly, more so," returned Macloud, seriously.The two detectives arose at their
entrance.The one, Rebbert, was a Pinkerton man, the other, Sanders,
was from the Bureau at City Hall.Both were small men, with clean
shaven faces, steady, searching eyes, and an especially quiet manner.Croyden," said Rebbert, "we have been questioning the servants,
but have obtained nothing of importance, except that the ladies wore
their hats and coats (at least, they have disappeared).This, with the
fact that you found Miss Cavendish's glove and handkerchief, on a road
without the limits of Hampton, leads to the conclusion that they have
been abducted.Miss Carrington, we are informed, has no great
wealth--how as to Miss Cavendish?""She has more than sufficient--in fact, she is very rich----"

"Ah!then we _have_ a motive," said the detective."There is a motive, but it is not Miss Cavendish," Croyden answered."You're correct as to the abduction, however--this will explain," and
he handed him the letter."At noon to-day," replied Croyden, passing over the envelope."Do you object to explaining certain things in this letter?""Not in the least," replied Croyden."I'll tell you the entire
story.... Is there anything I have missed?"Now, we prefer that you should take no measures to
apprehend the abductors, until after Miss Cavendish and Miss
Carrington have been released.We are going to pay the amount
demanded.""Going to pay the two hundred thousand dollars!"cried the detectives,
in one breath."Afterward, you can get as busy as you like."A knowing smile broke over the men's faces, at the same instant."It looks that way, sir," said Rebbert; while Sanders acquiesced, with
another smile.Croyden turned to Macloud and held up his hands, hopelessly.XX

THE CHECK


On the second morning after their abduction, when Elaine and Davila
arose, the sky was obscured by fog, the trees exuded moisture, and only
a small portion of the Bay was faintly visible through the mist."We must have moved out to
Northumberland, in the night."Davila smiled, a feeble sort of smile.It was not a morning to promote
light-heartedness, and particularly under such circumstances."Yes!--Only Northumberland is more so.For a misty day, this would be
remarkably fine.--With us, it's midnight at noon--all the lights
burning, in streets, and shops, and electric cars, bells jangling,
people rushing, pushing, diving through the dirty blackness, like
devils in hell.Oh, it's pleasant, when you get used to it.--Ever been
there?""No," said Davila, "I haven't.""We must have you out--say, immediately after the holidays."I'll be glad to come, if I'm alive--and we ever get out of this awful
place.""It _is_ stupid here," said Elaine."I thought there was something
novel in being abducted, but it's rather dreary business.I'm ready to
quit, are you?""I was ready to quit before we started!""We will see what can be done about it."Ask the chief to be kind enough to come here a
moment," she said, to the girl who attended them.In a few minutes, he appeared--suave, polite, courteous."You sent for me, Miss Cavendish?"Sit down, please, I've something to say to you, Mr.----"

"Jones, for short," he replied.Jones, for short--you will pardon me, I know, if I seem unduly
personal, but these quarters are not entirely to our liking.""I'm very sorry, indeed," he replied."We tried to make them
comfortable.In what are they unsatisfactory?--we will remedy it, if
possible.""We would prefer another locality--Hampton, to be specific.""You mean that you are tired of captivity?""I see your
point of view, and I'm hopeful that Mr.Croyden will see it, also, and
permit us to release you, in a few days.""It is that very point I wish to discuss a moment with you," she
interrupted.Croyden didn't find the
jewels and that, therefore, it is impossible for him to pay.""You will pardon me if I doubt your statement.--Moreover, we are not
privileged to discuss the matter with you.Croyden, as I think I have already intimated.""Then you will draw an empty covert," she replied."That remains to be seen, as I have also intimated," said Mr."But you don't want to draw an empty covert, do you--to have only your
trouble for your pains?""It would be a great disappointment, I assure you.""You have been at considerable expense to provide for our
entertainment?""Pray do not mention it!--it's a very great pleasure.""It would be a greater pleasure to receive the cash?""Since the cash is our ultimate aim, I confess it would be equally
satisfactory," he replied."Are _we_ not
to be given a chance to find the cash?""But assume that he cannot," she reiterated, "or won't--it's the same
result.""In that event, you----"

"Would be given the opportunity," she broke in."Then why not let us consider the matter in the first instance?"It can make no difference to you whence
it comes--from Mr."And it would be much more simple to accept a check and to release us
when it is paid?""Checks are not accepted in this business!""Ordinarily not, it would be too dangerous, I admit.But if it could be
arranged to your satisfaction, what then?""I don't think it can be arranged," he replied."And that amount is----" she persisted, smiling at him the while."None--not a fraction of a penny!""I want to know why you think it can't be arranged?"No bank would pay a check for that amount to
an unknown party, without the personal advice of the drawer.""Not if it were made payable to self, and properly indorsed for
identification?""You can try it--there's no harm in trying.When it's paid, they will pay you.If it's not paid, there
is no harm done--and we are still your prisoners.You stand to win
everything and lose nothing.""If it isn't paid, you still have us," said Elaine.If the check is presented, it will be paid--you may
rest easy, on that score.""But remember," she cautioned, "when it is paid, we are to be released,
instantly.If we play
square with you, you must play square with us.I risk a fortune, see
that you make good.""Your check--it should be one of the sort you always use----"

"I always carry a few blank checks in my handbag--and fortunately, I
have it with me.You were careful to wrap it in with my arms.In a moment she returned, the blank check in
her fingers, and handed it to him.It was of a delicate robin's-egg
blue, with "The Tuscarora Trust Company" printed across the face in a
darker shade, and her monogram, in gold, at the upper end."Is it sufficiently individual to raise a presumption of regularity?""Then, let us understand each other," she said."I give you my check for two hundred thousand dollars, duly executed,
payable to my order, and endorsed by me, which, when paid, you, on
behalf of your associates and yourself, engage to accept in lieu of the
amount demanded from Mr.Croyden, and to release Miss Carrington and
myself forthwith.""There is one thing more," he said."You, on your part, are to
stipulate that no attempt will be made to arrest us.""We will engage that _we_ will do nothing to apprehend you.""Yes!--more than that is not in our power.You will have to assume the
general risk you took when you abducted us.""We will take it," was the quiet answer."I think not--at least, everything is entirely satisfactory to us.""Despite the fact that it couldn't be made so!""I didn't know we had to deal with a woman of such business sense
and--wealth," he answered gallantly."If you will get me ink and pen, I will sign the check,"
she said.She filled it in for the amount specified, signed and endorsed it.Then
she took, from her handbag, a correspondence card, embossed with her
initials, and wrote this note:

                                              "Hampton, Md.Thompson:--

  "I have made a purchase, down here, and my check for Two Hundred
  Thousand dollars, in consideration, will come through, at once."Yours very sincerely,

                                            "Elaine Cavendish."To James Thompson, Esq'r., "Treasurer, The Tuscarora Trust Co.,
  "Northumberland."She addressed the envelope and passed it and the card across to Mr."If you will mail this, to-night, it will provide against any chance of
non-payment," she said."You are a marvel of accuracy," he answered, with a bow."I would I
could always do business with you."monsieur, I pray thee, no
more!"There was a knock on the door; the maid entered and spoke in a low tone
to Jones."I am sorry to inconvenience you again," he said, turning to them, "but
I must trouble you to go aboard the tug.""On the water--that is usually the place for well behaved tugs!""Now--before I go to deposit the check!""You will be safer
on the tug.There will be no danger of an escape or a rescue--and it
won't be for long, I trust.""Your trust is no greater than ours, I assure you," said Elaine.Their few things were quickly gathered, and they went down to the
wharf, where a small boat was drawn up ready to take them to the tug,
which was lying a short distance out in the Bay."One of the Baltimore tugs, likely," said Davila."There are scores of
them, there, and some are none too chary about the sort of business
they are employed in."Jones conducted them to the little
cabin, which they were to occupy together--an upper and a lower bunk
having been provided."The maid will sleep in the galley," said he."She will look after the
cooking, and you will dine in the small cabin next to this one.It's a
bit contracted quarters for you, and I'm sorry, but it won't be for
long--as we both trust, Miss Cavendish."I will have my bank send it direct for
collection, with instructions to wire immediately if paid.I presume
you don't wish it to go through the ordinary course.""The check, and your note, should reach
the Trust Company in the same mail to-morrow morning; they can be
depended upon to wire promptly, I presume?""Then, we may be able to release you to-morrow night, certainly by
Saturday.""It can't come too soon for us.""You don't seem to like our hospitality," Jones observed."It's excellent of its sort, but we don't fancy the sort--you
understand, monsieur.And then, too, it is frightfully expensive.""We have done the best we could under the circumstances," he smiled."Until Saturday at the latest--meanwhile, permit me to offer you a very
hopeful farewell.""Why do you treat him so amiably?""I couldn't, if I
would."It wouldn't help our case
to be sullen--and it might make it much worse.I would gladly shoot
him, and hurrah over it, too, as I fancy you would do, but it does no
good to show it, now--when we _can't_ shoot him.""But I'm glad I don't have to play the
part.""Elaine, I don't know how to thank you
for my freedom----"

"Wait until you have it!""Though there isn't a
doubt of the check being paid.""My grandfather, I know, will repay you with his entire fortune, but
that will be little----"

Elaine stopped her further words by placing a hand over her mouth, and
kissing her."Take it that the reward is for
my release, and that you were just tossed in for good measure--or, that
it is a slight return for the pleasure of visiting you--or, that the
money is a small circumstance to me--or, that it is a trifling sum to
pay to be saved the embarrassment of proposing to Geoffrey,
myself--or, take it any way you like, only, don't bother your pretty
head an instant more about it.In the slang of the day: 'Forget it,'
completely and utterly, as a favor to me if for no other reason.""I'll promise to forget it--until we're free," agreed Davila."And, in the meantime, let us have a look around this old boat," said
Elaine."You're nearer the door, will you open it?Davila tried the door--it refused to open.we will content ourselves with watching the Bay through the
port hole, and when one wants to turn around the other can crawl up in
her bunk.I'm going to write a book about this experience, some
time.--I wonder what Geoffrey and Colin are doing?"she
laughed--"running around like mad and stirring up the country, I
reckon."XXI

THE JEWELS


Macloud went to New York on the evening train.He carried Croyden's
power of attorney with stock sufficient, when sold, to make up his
share of the cash.He had provided for his own share by a wire to his
brokers and his bank in Northumberland.He would reduce both amounts to one thousand dollar bills and hurry
back to Annapolis to meet Croyden.But they counted not on the railroads,--or rather they did count on
them, and they were disappointed.A freight was derailed just south of
Hampton, tearing up the track for a hundred yards, and piling the right
of way with wreckage of every description.Macloud's train was twelve
hours late leaving Hampton.Then, to add additional ill luck, they ran
into a wash out some fifty miles further on; with the result that they
did not reach New York until after the markets were over and the banks
had closed for the day.The following day, he sold the stocks,
the brokers gave him the proceeds in the desired bills, after the
delivery hour, and he made a quick get-away for Annapolis, arriving
there at nine o'clock in the evening.Croyden was awaiting him, at Carvel Hall."I'm sorry, for the girls' sake," said he, "but it's only a day lost.And, then, pray God, they be freed
before another night!That lawyer thief is a rogue and a robber, but
something tells me he will play straight.""I reckon we will have to trust him," returned Macloud.He will be over on the Point in the morning, disguised
as a <DW64> and chopping wood, on the edge of the timber.There isn't
much chance of him identifying the gang, but it's the best we can do.It's the girls first, the scoundrels afterward, if possible."At eleven o'clock the following day, Croyden, mounted on one of
"Cheney's Best," rode away from the hotel.There had been a sudden
change in the weather, during the night; the morning was clear and
bright and warm, as happens, sometimes, in Annapolis, in late November.The Severn, blue and placid, flung up an occasional white cap to greet
him, as he crossed the bridge.He nodded to the draw-keeper, who
recognized him, drew aside for an automobile to pass, and then trotted
sedately up the hill, and into the woods beyond.He could hear the Band of the Academy pounding out a quick-step, and
catch a glimpse of the long line of midshipmen passing in review,
before some notable.The "custard and cream" of the chapel dome
obtruded itself in all its hideousness; the long reach of Bancroft Hall
glowed white in the sun; the library with its clock--the former, by
some peculiar idea, placed at the farthest point from the dormitory,
and the latter where the midshipmen cannot see it--dominated the
opposite end of the grounds.Everywhere was quiet, peace, and
discipline--the embodiment of order and law,--the Flag flying over
all.And yet, he was on his way to pay a ransom of very considerable amount,
for two women who were held prisoners!He tied his horse to a limb of a maple, and walked out on the Point.Save for a few trees, uprooted by the gales, it was the same Point they
had dug over a few weeks before.A <DW64>, chopping at a log, stopped
his work, a moment, to look at him curiously, then resumed his labor.thought Croyden, but he made no effort to speak to
him.Somewhere,--from a window in the town, or from one of the numerous
ships bobbing about on the Bay or the River--he did not doubt a glass
was trained on him, and his every motion was being watched.For full twenty minutes, he stood on the extreme tip of the Point, and
looked out to sea.Then he faced directly around and stepped ten paces
inland.Kneeling, he quickly dug with a small trowel a hole a foot deep
in the sand, put into it the package of bills, wrapped in oil-skin,
and replaced the ground."Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.May
we have seen the last of you--and may the devil take you all!"He went slowly back to his horse, mounted, and rode back to town.They
had done their part--would the thieves do theirs?Adhering strictly to the instructions, Croyden and Macloud left
Annapolis on the next car, caught the boat at Baltimore, and arrived in
Hampton in the evening, in time for dinner.They stopped a few minutes
at Ashburton, to acquaint Captain Carrington with their return, and
then went on to Clarendon.Neither wanted the other to know and each
endeavored to appear at ease.He threw his cigarette into his coffee cup, and
pushed his chair back from the table."You're trying to appear nonchalant,
and you're doing it very well, too, but you can't control your fingers
and your eyes--and neither can I, I fancy, though I've tried hard
enough, God knows!These four days of strain and
uncertainty have taken it all out of us.If I had any doubt as to my
affection for Elaine, it's vanished, now.----I don't say I'm fool
enough to propose to her, yet I'm scarcely responsible, at present.If
I were to see her this minute, I'd likely do something rash.""You're coming around to it, gradually," said Macloud.I don't know about the 'gradually.'I want to pull
myself together--to get a rein on myself--to--what are you smiling at;
am I funny?""I never saw a man fight so hard against his
personal inclinations, and a rich wife.You don't deserve her!--if I
were Elaine, I'd turn you down hard, hard.""And hence, with a woman's unreasonableness and trust in the one she
loves, she will likely accept you."Macloud blew a couple of smoke rings and watched them sail upward."I suppose you're equally discerning as to Miss Carrington, and her
love for you," Croyden commented."I regret to say, I'm not," said Macloud, seriously."That is what
troubles me, indeed.Unlike my friend, Geoffrey Croyden, I'm perfectly
sure of my own mind, but I'm not sure of the lady's.""Then, why don't you find out?""Exactly what I shall do, when she returns."We each seem to be able to answer the other's uncertainty," he
remarked, calmly."I'm going over to Ashburton, and talk with the Captain a little--sort
of cheer him up."It's a very good occupation for you, sitting up to
the old gent.I'll give you a chance by staying away, to-night.Make a
hit with grandpa, Colin, make a hit with grandpa!""And you make a hit with yourself--get rid of your foolish theory, and
come down to simple facts," Macloud retorted, and he went out."Get rid of your foolish theory," Croyden soliloquized."Well,
maybe--but _is_ it foolish, that's the question?I'm poor, once
more--I've not enough even for Elaine Cavendish's husband--there's the
rub!she won't be Geoffrey Croyden's wife, it's I who will be Elaine
Cavendish's husband.'Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ dine with us
to-night!'--'Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ were at the horse
show!''Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ were here!--or there!--or
thus and so!'"It would be too belittling, too disparaging of
self-respect.--Elaine Cavendish's husband!--Elaine Cavendish's
husband!Might he out-grow it--be known for himself?He glanced up at
the portrait of the gallant soldier of a lost cause, with the high-bred
face and noble bearing."You were a brave man, Colonel Duval!"He took out a cigar, lit it very deliberately, and fell to thinking....
Presently, worn out by fatigue and anxiety, he dozed....

                  *       *       *       *       *

And as he dozed, the street door opened softly, a light step crossed
the hall, and Elaine Cavendish stood in the doorway.She was clad in black velvet, trimmed in sable.A
blue cloak was thrown, with careless grace, about her gleaming
shoulders.One slender hand lifted the gown from before her feet.She
saw the sleeping man and paused, and a smile of infinite tenderness
passed across her face.A moment she hesitated, and at the thought, a faint blush suffused her
face.Then she glided softly over, bent and kissed him on the lips.She was there, before him,
the blush still on cheek and brow.And, straightway took her, unresisting,
in his arms....

"Tell me all about yourself," he said, at last, drawing her down into
the chair and seating himself on the arm."Where is Miss
Carrington--safe?""Colin's with her--I reckon she's safe!""It won't be
his fault if she isn't, I'm sure.--I left them at Ashburton, and came
over here to--you.""I'll go back at once----"

He laughed, joyously."My hair,
dear,--do be careful!""I'll be good--if you will kiss me again!""But you're not asleep," she objected."And you will promise--not to kiss me again?"She looked up at him tantalizingly, her red lips parted, her bosom
fluttering below."If it's worth coming half way for, sweetheart--you may," she said....

"Now, if you're done with foolishness--for a little while," she said,
gayly, "I'll tell you how we managed to get free.""Oh, yes!--the Parmenter jewels.Davila told me the story, and how you
didn't find them, though our abductors think you did, and won't believe
otherwise.""None--we were most courteously treated; and they released us, as
quickly as the check was paid.""I mean, that I gave them my check for the ransom money--you hadn't the
jewels, you couldn't comply with the demand.I knew you couldn't pay it, so I did.Don't let us think of
it, dear!--It's over, and we have each other, now.Then suddenly she, woman-like, went straight back to
it."How did you think we managed to get free--escaped?""Yes--I never thought of your paying the money."she said, "you are deceiving me!--you are--_you_ paid the money,
also!"Macloud and I _did_ pay the ransom to-day--but of what consequence is
it; whether you bought your freedom, or we bought it, or both bought
it?You and Davila are here, again--that's the only thing that
matters!"came Macloud's voice from the
hallway, and Davila and he walked into the room.Elaine, with a little shriek, sprang up."Davila and I were occupying similar
positions at Ashburton, a short time ago.as
he made a motion to put his arm around her.Davila eluded him--though the traitor red confirmed his words--and
sought Elaine's side for safety."It's a pleasure only deferred, my dear!""By the way,
Elaine, how did Croyden happen to give in?He was shying off at your
wealth--said it would be giving hostages to fortune, and all that
rot.""I'm going to try to make
good.""Geoffrey," said Elaine, "won't you show us the old pirate's
letter--we're all interested in it, now.""I'll show you the letter, and where I
found it, and anything else you want to see.Croyden opened the secret drawer, and
took out the letter.he said, solemnly, and handed it to Elaine.She carried it to the table, spread it out under the lamp, and Davila
and she studied it, carefully, even as Croyden and Macloud had
done--reading the Duval endorsements over and over again."It seems to me there is something queer about these postscripts," she
said, at last; "something is needed to make them clear.Is this the
entire letter?--didn't you find anything else?""It's a bit dark in this hole.She struck it, and peered back into the recess."Here is something!--only a corner visible.""It has slipped down, back of the false partition.She drew out a tiny sheet of paper, and handed it to Croyden.Croyden glanced at it; then gave a cry of amazed surprise.The rest crowded around him while he read:

                                         "Hampton, Maryland."Memorandum to accompany the letter of Robert Parmenter, dated 10
  May 1738."Whereas, it is stipulated by the said Parmenter that the Jewels
  shall be used only in the Extremity of Need; and hence, as I have
  an abundance of this world's Goods, that Need will, likely, not
  come to me.And judging that Greenberry Point will change, in
  time--so that my son or his Descendants, if occasion arise, may
  be unable to locate the Treasure--I have lifted the Iron box,
  from the place where Parmenter buried it, and have reinterred it
  in the cellar of my House in Hampton, renewing the Injunction
  which Parmenter put upon it, that it shall be used only in the
  Extremity of Need.When this Need arise, it will be found in the
  south-east corner of the front cellar.At the depth of two feet,
  between two large stones, is the Iron box.It contains the
  jewels, the most marvelous I have ever seen.For a moment, they stood staring at one another too astonished to
speak."To think that it was here, all
the time!"They trooped down to the cellar, Croyden leading the way.Moses was off
for the evening, they had the house to themselves.As they passed the
foot of the stairs, Macloud picked up a mattock."Which is the south-east corner,
Davila?""The ground is not especially hard," observed Macloud, with the first
stroke."I reckon a yard square is sufficient.--At a depth of two feet
the memorandum says, doesn't it?"Fascinated, they were watching the fall of the pick.With every blow, they were listening for it to strike the stones."Better get a shovel, Croyden, we'll need it," said Macloud, pausing
long enough, to throw off his coat.... "Oh!I forgot to say, I wired
the Pinkerton man to recover the package you buried this morning."Croyden only nodded--stood the lamp on a box, and returned with the
coal scoop."This will answer, I reckon," he said, and fell to work.remarked Macloud, between strokes."To have hunted
the treasure, for weeks, all over Greenberry Point, and then to find it
in the cellar, like a can of lard or a bushel of potatoes.""You haven't found it, yet," Croyden cautioned."And we've gone the
depth mentioned."we haven't found it, yet!--but we're going to find it!"Macloud
answered, sinking the pick, viciously, in the ground, with the last
word.Macloud cried, sinking the pick in at another
place.The fifth stroke laid the stone
bare--the sixth and seventh loosened it, still more--the eighth and
ninth completed the task.When the earth was away and the stone exposed, he stooped and, putting
his fingers under the edges, heaved it out."The rest is for you, Croyden!"For a moment, Croyden looked at it, rather dazedly.Could it be the
jewels were _there_!--within his reach!--under that lid!Suddenly, he
laughed!--gladly, gleefully, as a boy--and sprang down into the hole.The box clung to its resting place for a second, as though it was
reluctant to be disturbed--then it yielded, and Croyden swung it onto
the bank."We'll take it to the library," he said, scraping it clean of the
adhering earth.And carrying it before them, like the Ark of the Covenant, they went
joyously up to the floor above.He placed it on the table under the chandelier, where all could see.It
was of iron, rusty with age; in dimension, about a foot square; and
fastened by a hasp, with the bar of the lock thrust through but not
secured."Light the gas, Colin!--every burner," he said."We'll have the full
effulgence, if you please."...The scintillations which leaped out to meet them, were like the rays
from myriads of gleaming, glistening, varicolored lights, of dazzling
brightness and infinite depth.A wonderful cavern of coruscating
splendor--rubies and diamonds, emeralds and sapphires, pearls and opals
glowing with all the fire of self, and the resentment of long neglect."You may touch them--they will not
fade."They put them out on the table--in little heaps of color.The women
exclaiming whene'er they touched them, cooingly as a woman does when
handling jewels--fondling them, caressing them, loving them.They stood back and gazed--fascinated by it
all:--the color--the glowing reds and whites, and greens and blues."It is wonderful--and it's true!"Two necklaces lay among the rubies, alike as lapidary's art could make
them.Croyden handed one to Macloud, the other he took."In remembrance of your release, and of Parmenter's treasure!"he said,
and clasped it around Elaine's fair neck.Macloud clasped his around Davila's."Who cares, now, for the time spent on Greenberry Point or the double
reward!"*       *       *       *       *




Transcriber's note:

Minor changes have been made to correct typesetters' errors;
otherwise, every effort has been made to remain true to the
author's words and intent."But--but----"

I hurriedly waved my hand."When you defied the coroner to find
any suspicious paper in your possession; when"--I forced myself to
speak--"you refused to tell Mr.Gryce how you came in possession of the
key--"

She drew hastily back, a heavy pall seeming to fall over her with my
words."Don't," she whispered, looking in terror about her.Sometimes I
think the walls have ears, and that the very shadows listen.""Ah," I returned; "then you hope to keep from the world what is known to
the detectives?""Miss Leavenworth," I went on, "I am afraid you do not comprehend
your position.Try to look at the case for a moment in the light of
an unprejudiced person; try to see for yourself the necessity of
explaining----"

"But I cannot explain," she murmured huskily.I do not know whether it was the tone of my voice or the word itself,
but that simple expression seemed to affect her like a blow.she cried, shrinking back: "you do not, cannot doubt me, too?I
thought that you--" and stopped."I did not dream that I--" and stopped
again.You have mistrusted
me from the first; the appearances against me have been too strong"; and
she sank inert, lost in the depths of her shame and humiliation."Ah,
but now I am forsaken!"Starting forward, I exclaimed: "Miss
Leavenworth, I am but a man; I cannot see you so distressed.Say
that you are innocent, and I will believe you, without regard to
appearances."Springing erect, she towered upon me."Can any one look in my face
and accuse me of guilt?"Then, as I sadly shook my head, she hurriedly
gasped: "You want further proof!"and, quivering with an extraordinary
emotion, she sprang to the door."Come, then," she cried, "come!"her eyes flashing full of resolve upon
me.Aroused, appalled, moved in spite of myself, I crossed the room to where
she stood; but she was already in the hall.Hastening after her, filled
with a fear I dared not express, I stood at the foot of the stairs; she
was half-way to the top.Following her into the hall above, I saw her
form standing erect and noble at the door of her uncle's bedroom.she again cried, but this time in a calm and reverential tone;
and flinging the door open before her, she passed in.Subduing the wonder which I felt, I slowly followed her.There was no
light in the room of death, but the flame of the gas-burner, at the far
end of the hall, shone weirdly in, and by its glimmering I beheld her
kneeling at the shrouded bed, her head bowed above that of the murdered
man, her hand upon his breast."You have said that if I declared my innocence you would believe me,"
she exclaimed, lifting her head as I entered."See here," and laying
her cheek against the pallid brow of her dead benefactor, she kissed the
clay-cold lips softly, wildly, agonizedly, then, leaping to her feet,
cried, in a subdued but thrilling tone: "Could I do that if I were
guilty?Would not the breath freeze on my lips, the blood congeal in
my veins, and my heart faint at this contact?Son of a father loved and
reverenced, can you believe me to be a woman stained with crime when I
can do this?"and kneeling again she cast her arms over and about that
inanimate form, looking in my face at the same time with an expression
no mortal touch could paint, nor tongue describe."In olden times," she went on, "they used to say that a dead body would
bleed if its murderer came in contact with it.What then would happen
here if I, his daughter, his cherished child, loaded with benefits,
enriched with his jewels, warm with his kisses, should be the thing they
accuse me of?Would not the body of the outraged dead burst its very
shroud and repel me?"I could not answer; in the presence of some scenes the tongue forgets
its functions.she went on, "if there is a God in heaven who loves justice and
hates a crime, let Him hear me now.If I, by thought or action, with
or without intention, have been the means of bringing this dear head to
this pass; if so much as the shadow of guilt, let alone the substance,
lies upon my heart and across these feeble woman's hands, may His wrath
speak in righteous retribution to the world, and here, upon the breast
of the dead, let this guilty forehead fall, never to rise again!"An awed silence followed this invocation; then a long, long sigh of
utter relief rose tremulously from my breast, and all the feelings
hitherto suppressed in my heart burst their bonds, and leaning towards
her I took her hand in mine."You do not, cannot believe me tainted by crime now?"she whispered,
the smile which does not stir the lips, but rather emanates from the
countenance, like the flowering of an inner peace, breaking softly out
on cheek and brow.The word broke uncontrollably from my lips; "crime!""No," she said calmly, "the man does not live who could accuse me of
crime, _here_."For reply, I took her hand, which lay in mine, and placed it on the
breast of the dead.Softly, slowly, gratefully, she bowed her head."There is one who will
believe in me, however dark appearances may be."THE PROBLEM


    "But who would force the soul, tilts with a straw
     Against a champion cased in adamant."WHEN we re-entered the parlor below, the first sight that met our eyes
was Mary, standing wrapped in her long cloak in the centre of the room.She had arrived during our absence, and now awaited us with lifted head
and countenance fixed in its proudest expression.Looking in her face, I
realized what the embarrassment of this meeting must be to these
women, and would have retreated, but something in the attitude of Mary
Leavenworth seemed to forbid my doing so.At the same time, determined
that the opportunity should not pass without some sort of reconcilement
between them, I stepped forward, and, bowing to Mary, said:

"Your cousin has just succeeded in convincing me of her entire
innocence, Miss Leavenworth.Gryce, heart and
soul, in finding out the true culprit.""I should have thought one look into Eleanore Leavenworth's face would
have been enough to satisfy you that she is incapable of crime," was
her unexpected answer; and, lifting her head with a proud gesture, Mary
Leavenworth fixed her eyes steadfastly on mine.I felt the blood flash to my brow, but before I could speak, her voice
rose again still more coldly than before."It is hard for a delicate girl, unused to aught but the most flattering
expressions of regard, to be obliged to assure the world of her
innocence in respect to the committal of a great crime.And sweeping her cloak from her shoulders with a quick
gesture, she turned her gaze for the first time upon her cousin.Instantly Eleanore advanced, as if to meet it; and I could not but feel
that, for some reason, this moment possessed an importance for them
which I was scarcely competent to measure.But if I found myself unable
to realize its significance, I at least responded to its intensity.And
indeed it was an occasion to remember.To behold two such women, either
of whom might be considered the model of her time, face to face
and drawn up in evident antagonism, was a sight to move the dullest
sensibilities.But there was something more in this scene than that.It
was the shock of all the most passionate emotions of the human soul;
the meeting of waters of whose depth and force I could only guess by the
effect.Drawing back with the cold
haughtiness which, alas, I had almost forgotten in the display of later
and softer emotions, she exclaimed:

"There is something better than sympathy, and that is justice"; and
turned, as if to go."I will confer with you in the reception room, Mr.But Mary, springing forward, caught her back with one powerful hand."No," she cried, "you shall confer with _me!_ I have something to say to
you, Eleanore Leavenworth."And, taking her stand in the centre of the
room, she waited.I glanced at Eleanore, saw this was no place for me, and hastily
withdrew.For ten long minutes I paced the floor of the reception room,
a prey to a thousand doubts and conjectures.What had given rise to the deadly mistrust continually manifested
between these cousins, fitted by nature for the completest companionship
and the most cordial friendship?It was not a thing of to-day or
yesterday.No sudden flame could awake such concentrated heat of emotion
as that of which I had just been the unwilling witness.One must go
farther back than this murder to find the root of a mistrust so great
that the struggle it caused made itself felt even where I stood, though
nothing but the faintest murmur came to my ears through the closed
doors.Presently the drawing-room curtain was raised, and Mary's voice was
heard in distinct articulation."The same roof can never shelter us both after this.To-morrow, you or I
find another home."And, blushing and panting, she stepped into the
hall and advanced to where I stood.But at the first sight of my face,
a change came over her; all her pride seemed to dissolve, and, flinging
out her hands, as if to ward off scrutiny, she fled from my side, and
rushed weeping up-stairs.I was yet laboring under the oppression caused by this painful
termination of the strange scene when the parlor curtain was again
lifted, and Eleanore entered the room where I was.Pale but calm,
showing no evidences of the struggle she had just been through, unless
by a little extra weariness about the eyes, she sat down by my side,
and, meeting my gaze with one unfathomable in its courage, said after
a pause: "Tell me where I stand; let me know the worst at once; I fear
that I have not indeed comprehended my own position."Rejoiced to hear this acknowledgment from her lips, I hastened to
comply.I began by placing before her the whole case as it appeared
to an unprejudiced person; enlarged upon the causes of suspicion, and
pointed out in what regard some things looked dark against her, which
perhaps to her own mind were easily explainable and of small account;
tried to make her see the importance of her decision, and finally wound
up with an appeal."And so I am; but I want the world to be so, too."The finger of suspicion never forgets the way
it has once pointed," she sadly answered."And you will submit to this, when a word--"

"I am thinking that any word of mine now would make very little
difference," she murmured.Fobbs, in hiding behind the curtains of
the opposite house, recurring painfully to my mind."If the affair looks as bad as you say it does," she pursued, "it is
scarcely probable that Mr.Gryce will care much for any interpretation
of mine in regard to the matter."Gryce would be glad to know where you procured that key, if only to
assist him in turning his inquiries in the right direction."She did not reply, and my spirits sank in renewed depression."It is worth your while to satisfy him," I pursued; "and though it may
compromise some one you desire to shield----"

She rose impetuously."I shall never divulge to any one how I came in
possession of that key."And sitting again, she locked her hands in
fixed resolve before her.I rose in my turn and paced the floor, the fang of an unreasoning
jealousy striking deep into my heart.Raymond, if the worst should come, and all who love me should plead
on bended knees for me to tell, I will never do it.""Then," said I, determined not to disclose my secret thought, but
equally resolved to find out if possible her motive for this silence,
"you desire to defeat the cause of justice.""Miss Leavenworth," I now said, "this determined shielding of another at
the expense of your own good name is no doubt generous of you; but
your friends and the lovers of truth and justice cannot accept such a
sacrifice.""If you will not assist us," I went on calmly, but determinedly, "we
must do without your aid.After the scene I have just witnessed above;
after the triumphant conviction which you have forced upon me, not only
of your innocence, but your horror of the crime and its consequences, I
should feel myself less than a man if I did not sacrifice even your own
good opinion, in urging your cause, and clearing your character from
this foul aspersion."Crossing the room, I stood before her."I propose to relieve you utterly
and forever from suspicion, by finding out and revealing to the world
the true culprit."I expected to see her recoil, so positive had I become by this time
as to who that culprit was.But instead of that, she merely folded her
hands still more tightly and exclaimed:

"I doubt if you will be able to do that, Mr."Doubt if I will be able to put my finger upon the guilty man, or doubt
if I will be able to bring him to justice?""I doubt," she said with strong effort, "if any one ever knows who is
the guilty person in this case.""There is one who knows," I said with a desire to test her."The girl Hannah is acquainted with the mystery of that night's evil
doings, Miss Leavenworth.Find Hannah, and we find one who can point out
to us the assassin of your uncle.""That is mere supposition," she said; but I saw the blow had told."Your cousin has offered a large reward for the girl, and the whole
country is on the lookout.Within a week we shall see her in our midst."A change took place in her expression and bearing."The girl cannot help me," she said.Baffled by her manner, I drew back."Is there anything or anybody that
can?""Miss Leavenworth," I continued with renewed earnestness, "you have no
brother to plead with you, you have no mother to guide you; let me then
entreat, in default of nearer and dearer friends, that you will rely
sufficiently upon me to tell me one thing.""Whether you took the paper imputed to you from the library table?"She did not instantly respond, but sat looking earnestly before her with
an intentness which seemed to argue that she was weighing the question
as well as her reply.Finally, turning toward me, she said:

"In answering you, I speak in confidence.Crushing back the sigh of despair that arose to my lips, I went on."I will not inquire what the paper was,"--she waved her hand
deprecatingly,--"but this much more you will tell me.I could with difficulty forbear showing my disappointment."Miss
Leavenworth," I now said, "it may seem cruel for me to press you at this
time; nothing less than my strong realization of the peril in which you
stand would induce me to run the risk of incurring your displeasure by
asking what under other circumstances would seem puerile and insulting
questions.You have told me one thing which I strongly desired to know;
will you also inform me what it was you heard that night while sitting
in your room, between the time of Mr.Harwell's going up-stairs and the
closing of the library door, of which you made mention at the inquest?"I had pushed my inquiries too far, and I saw it immediately.Raymond," she returned, "influenced by my desire not to appear
utterly ungrateful to you, I have been led to reply in confidence to one
of your urgent appeals; but I can go no further.Stricken to the heart by her look of reproach, I answered with some
sadness that her wishes should be respected."Not but what I intend to
make every effort in my power to discover the true author of this crime.That is a sacred duty which I feel myself called upon to perform; but I
will ask you no more questions, nor distress you with further appeals.What is done shall be done without your assistance, and with no other
hope than that in the event of my success you will acknowledge my
motives to have been pure and my action disinterested.""I am ready to acknowledge that now," she began, but paused and looked
with almost agonized entreaty in my face.Raymond, cannot you leave
things as they are?I don't ask for assistance, nor do I want
it; I would rather----"

But I would not listen."Guilt has no right to profit by the generosity
of the guiltless.The hand that struck this blow shall not be
accountable for the loss of a noble woman's honor and happiness as well."I shall do what I can, Miss Leavenworth."As I walked down the avenue that night, feeling like an adventurous
traveller that in a moment of desperation has set his foot upon a plank
stretching in narrow perspective over a chasm of immeasurable depth,
this problem evolved itself from the shadows before me: How, with no
other clue than the persuasion that Eleanore Leavenworth was engaged in
shielding another at the expense of her own good name, I was to
combat the prejudices of Mr.Gryce, find out the real assassin of Mr.Leavenworth, and free an innocent woman from the suspicion that had, not
without some show of reason, fallen upon her?HENRY CLAVERING



XIV.GRYCE AT HOME


    "Nay, but hear me."THAT the guilty person for whom Eleanore Leavenworth stood ready to
sacrifice herself was one for whom she had formerly cherished affection,
I could no longer doubt; love, or the strong sense of duty growing out
of love, being alone sufficient to account for such determined action.Obnoxious as it was to all my prejudices, one name alone, that of the
commonplace secretary, with his sudden heats and changeful manners, his
odd ways and studied self-possession, would recur to my mind whenever I
asked myself who this person could be.Not that, without the light which had been thrown upon the affair by
Eleanore's strange behavior, I should have selected this man as one in
any way open to suspicion; the peculiarity of his manner at the inquest
not being marked enough to counteract the improbability of one in his
relations to the deceased finding sufficient motive for a crime so
manifestly without favorable results to himself.But if love had entered
as a factor into the affair, what might not be expected?James Harwell,
simple amanuensis to a retired tea-merchant, was one man; James Harwell,
swayed by passion for a woman beautiful as Eleanore Leavenworth, was
another; and in placing him upon the list of those parties open to
suspicion I felt I was only doing what was warranted by a proper
consideration of probabilities.But, between casual suspicion and actual proof, what a gulf!To believe
James Harwell capable of guilt, and to find evidence enough to accuse
him of it, were two very different things.I felt myself instinctively
shrink from the task, before I had fully made up my mind to attempt it;
some relenting thought of his unhappy position, if innocent, forcing
itself upon me, and making my very distrust of him seem personally
ungenerous if not absolutely unjust.If I had liked the man better, I
should not have been so ready to look upon him with doubt.But Eleanore must be saved at all hazards.Once delivered up to the
blight of suspicion, who could tell what the result might be; the arrest
of her person perhaps,--a thing which, once accomplished, would cast a
shadow over her young life that it would take more than time to dispel.The accusation of an impecunious secretary would be less horrible than
this.I determined to make an early call upon Mr.Meanwhile the contrasted pictures of Eleanore standing with her hand
upon the breast of the dead, her face upraised and mirroring a glory,
I could not recall without emotion; and Mary, fleeing a short half-hour
later indignantly from her presence, haunted me and kept me awake long
after midnight.It was like a double vision of light and darkness that,
while contrasting, neither assimilated nor harmonized.Do what I would, the two pictures followed me, filling my soul
with alternate hope and distrust, till I knew not whether to place my
hand with Eleanore on the breast of the dead, and swear implicit faith
in her truth and purity, or to turn my face like Mary, and fly from what
I could neither comprehend nor reconcile.Expectant of difficulty, I started next morning upon my search for Mr.Gryce, with strong determination not to allow myself to become flurried
by disappointment nor discouraged by premature failure.My business was
to save Eleanore Leavenworth; and to do that, it was necessary for me to
preserve, not only my equanimity, but my self-possession.The worst
fear I anticipated was that matters would reach a crisis before I could
acquire the right, or obtain the opportunity, to interfere.Leavenworth's funeral being announced for that day gave
me some comfort in that direction; my knowledge of Mr.Gryce being
sufficient, as I thought, to warrant me in believing he would wait till
after that ceremony before proceeding to extreme measures.I do not know that I had any very definite ideas of what a detective's
home should be; but when I stood before the neat three-story brick house
to which I had been directed, I could not but acknowledge there was
something in the aspect of its half-open shutters, over closely drawn
curtains of spotless purity, highly suggestive of the character of its
inmate.A pale-looking youth, with vivid locks of red hair hanging straight down
over either ear, answered my rather nervous ring.Gryce was in, he gave a kind of snort which might have meant
no, but which I took to mean yes."My name is Raymond, and I wish to see him."He gave me one glance that took in every detail of my person and
apparel, and pointed to a door at the head of the stairs.Not waiting
for further directions, I hastened up, knocked at the door he had
designated, and went in.Gryce, stooping above a
desk that might have come over in the _Mayflower,_ confronted me.And rising, he opened with a
squeak and shut with a bang the door of an enormous stove that occupied
the centre of the room."Yes," I returned, eyeing him closely to see if he was in a
communicative mood."But I have had but little time to consider the
state of the weather.My anxiety in regard to this murder----"

"To be sure," he interrupted, fixing his eyes upon the poker, though
not with any hostile intention, I am sure.But perhaps it is an open book to you."I have, though I doubt if it is of the nature you expect.Gryce,
since I saw you last, my convictions upon a certain point have been
strengthened into an absolute belief.The object of your suspicions is
an innocent woman."If I had expected him to betray any surprise at this, I was destined to
be disappointed."That is a very pleasing belief," he observed."I honor
you for entertaining it, Mr."So thoroughly is it mine," I went on,
in the determination to arouse him in some way, "that I have come here
to-day to ask you in the name of justice and common humanity to suspend
action in that direction till we can convince ourselves there is no
truer scent to go upon."But there was no more show of curiosity than before.he cried;
"that is a singular request to come from a man like you."I was not to be discomposed, "Mr.Gryce," I went on, "a woman's name,
once tarnished, remains so forever.Eleanore Leavenworth has too many
noble traits to be thoughtlessly dealt with in so momentous a crisis.If
you will give me your attention, I promise you shall not regret it."He smiled, and allowed his eyes to roam from the poker to the arm of my
chair."Very well," he remarked; "I hear you; say on."I drew my notes from my pocketbook, and laid them on the table."Unsafe, very; never put your plans on
paper."Taking no heed of the interruption, I went on.Gryce, I have had fuller opportunities than yourself for studying
this woman.I have seen her in a position which no guilty person could
occupy, and I am assured, beyond all doubt, that not only her hands, but
her heart, are pure from this crime.She may have some knowledge of its
secrets; that I do not presume to deny.The key seen in her possession
would refute me if I did.You can never wish to see
so lovely a being brought to shame for withholding information which she
evidently considers it her duty to keep back, when by a little patient
finesse we may succeed in our purposes without it.""But," interposed the detective, "say this is so; how are we to arrive
at the knowledge we want without following out the only clue which has
yet been given us?""You will never reach it by following out any clue given you by Eleanore
Leavenworth."His eyebrows lifted expressively, but he said nothing."Miss Eleanore Leavenworth has been used by some one acquainted with her
firmness, generosity, and perhaps love.Let us discover who possesses
sufficient power over her to control her to this extent, and we find the
man we seek."Gryce's compressed lips, and no more.Determined that he should speak, I waited."You have, then, some one in your mind"; he remarked at last, almost
flippantly."You are, then, intending to make a personal business of this matter?""May I ask," he inquired at length,
"whether you expect to work entirely by yourself; or whether, if a
suitable coadjutor were provided, you would disdain his assistance and
slight his advice?""I desire nothing more than to have you for my colleague.""You must feel very sure of
yourself!""I am very sure of Miss Leavenworth."The truth was, I had formed no plans."It seems to me," he continued, "that you have undertaken a rather
difficult task for an amateur.Raymond;
better leave it to me.""I am sure," I returned, "that nothing would please me better----"

"Not," he interrupted, "but that a word from you now and then would
be welcome.I am open to suggestions: as, for
instance, now, if you could conveniently inform me of all you have
yourself seen and heard in regard to this matter, I should be most happy
to listen."Relieved to find him so amenable, I asked myself what I really had to
tell; not so much that he would consider vital.However, it would not do
to hesitate now.Gryce," said I, "I have but few facts to add to those already known
to you.Indeed, I am more moved by convictions than facts.That Eleanore
Leavenworth never committed this crime, I am assured.That, on the other
hand, the real perpetrator is known to her, I am equally certain;
and that for some reason she considers it a sacred duty to shield the
assassin, even at the risk of her own safety, follows as a matter
of course from the facts.Now, with such data, it cannot be a very
difficult task for you or me to work out satisfactorily, to our own
minds at least, who this person can be.A little more knowledge of the
family--"

"You know nothing of its secret history, then?""Do not even know whether either of these girls is engaged to be
married?""I do not," I returned, wincing at this direct expression of my own
thoughts.Raymond," he cried at last, "have
you any idea of the disadvantages under which a detective labors?For
instance, now, you imagine I can insinuate myself into all sorts of
society, perhaps; but you are mistaken.Strange as it may appear, I have
never by any possibility of means succeeded with one class of persons at
all.Tailors and barbers are
no good; I am always found out."He looked so dejected I could scarcely forbear smiling, notwithstanding
my secret care and anxiety."I have even employed a French valet, who understood dancing and
whiskers; but it was all of no avail.The first gentleman I approached
stared at me,--real gentleman, I mean, none of your American
dandies,--and I had no stare to return; I had forgotten that emergency
in my confabs with Pierre Catnille Marie Make-face."Amused, but a little discomposed by this sudden turn in the
conversation, I looked at Mr."Now you, I dare say, have no trouble?Can even
ask a lady to dance without blushing, eh?""Just so," he replied; "now, I can't.I can enter a house, bow to the
mistress of it, let her be as elegant as she will, so long as I have
a writ of arrest in my hand, or some such professional matter upon my
mind; but when it comes to visiting in kid gloves, raising a glass of
champagne in response to a toast--and such like, I am absolutely good
for nothing."And he plunged his two hands into his hair, and looked
dolefully at the head of the cane I carried in my hand."But it is much
the same with the whole of us.When we are in want of a gentleman to
work for us, we have to go outside of our profession."I began to see what he was driving at; but held my peace, vaguely
conscious I was likely to prove a necessity to him, after all.Raymond," he now said, almost abruptly; "do you know a gentleman by
the name of Clavering residing at present at the Hoffman House?""He is very polished in his manners; would you mind making his
acquaintance?"Gryce's example, and stared at the chimney-piece."I
cannot answer till I understand matters a little better," I returned at
length.Henry Clavering, a gentleman and
a man of the world, resides at the Hoffman House.He is a stranger in
town, without being strange; drives, walks, smokes, but never visits;
looks at the ladies, but is never seen to bow to one.In short, a
person whom it is desirable to know; but whom, being a proud man,
with something of the old-world prejudice against Yankee freedom and
forwardness, I could no more approach in the way of acquaintance than I
could the Emperor of Austria.""And you wish----"

"He would make a very agreeable companion for a rising young lawyer
of good family and undoubted respectability.I have no doubt, if you
undertook to cultivate him, you would find him well worth the trouble.""But----"

"Might even desire to take him into familiar relations; to confide in
him, and----"

"Mr.Gryce," I hastily interrupted; "I can never consent to plot for any
man's friendship for the sake of betraying him to the police.""It is essential to your plans to make the acquaintance of Mr.I returned, a light breaking in upon me; "he has some connection
with this case, then?"Gryce smoothed his coat-sleeve thoughtfully."I don't know as it
will be necessary for you to betray him.You wouldn't object to being
introduced to him?""Nor, if you found him pleasant, to converse with him?""Not even if, in the course of conversation, you should come across
something that might serve as a clue in your efforts to save Eleanore
Leavenworth?"The no I uttered this time was less assured; the part of a spy was the
very last one I desired to play in the coming drama."Well, then," he went on, ignoring the doubtful tone in which my assent
had been given, "I advise you to immediately take up your quarters at
the Hoffman House.""I doubt if that would do," I said."If I am not mistaken, I have
already seen this gentleman, and spoken to him.""Well, he is tall, finely formed, of very upright carriage, with a
handsome dark face, brown hair streaked with gray, a piercing eye, and a
smooth address.A very imposing personage, I assure you.""I have reason to think I have seen him," I returned; and in a few words
told him when and where.said he at the conclusion; "he is evidently as much interested
in you as we are in him.I think I see," he added, after a moment's thought."Pity you spoke to him; may have created an unfavorable impression; and
everything depends upon your meeting without any distrust.""Well, we must move slowly, that is all.Give him a chance to see you in
other and better lights.Talk with the best men you meet while there; but not too much, or too
indiscriminately.Clavering is fastidious, and will not feel honored
by the attentions of one who is hail-fellow-well-met with everybody.Show yourself for what you are, and leave all advances to him; he 'll
make them.""Supposing we are under a mistake, and the man I met on the corner of
Thirty-seventh Street was not Mr."I should be greatly surprised, that's all."Not knowing what further objection to make, I remained silent."And this head of mine would have to put on its thinking-cap," he
pursued jovially.Gryce," I now said, anxious to show that all this talk about an
unknown party had not served to put my own plans from my mind, "there is
one person of whom we have not spoken."he exclaimed softly, wheeling around until his broad back
confronted me."Why, who but Mr.--" I could get no further.What right had I to
mention any man's name in this connection, without possessing sufficient
evidence against him to make such mention justifiable?"I beg your
pardon," said I; "but I think I will hold to my first impulse, and speak
no names."The quick blush rising to my face gave an involuntary assent."I see no reason why we shouldn't speak of him," he went on; "that is,
if there is anything to be gained by it.""His testimony at the inquest was honest, you think?"I felt myself slightly nonplussed; and, conscious of appearing at a
disadvantage, lifted my hat from the table and prepared to take my
leave; but, suddenly thinking of Hannah, turned and asked if there was
any news of her.He seemed to debate with himself, hesitating so long that I began to
doubt if this man intended to confide in me, after all, when suddenly he
brought his two hands down before him and exclaimed vehemently:

"The evil one himself is in this business!If the earth had opened and
swallowed up this girl, she couldn't have more effectually disappeared."Eleanore had said: "Hannah can do
nothing for me."Could it be that the girl was indeed gone, and forever?"I have innumerable agents at work, to say nothing of the general
public; and yet not so much as a whisper has come to me in regard to her
whereabouts or situation.I am only afraid we shall find her floating in
the river some fine morning, without a confession in her pocket.""Everything hangs upon that girl's testimony," I remarked."What does Miss Leavenworth say about it?"I thought he looked a trifle surprised at this, but he covered it with a
nod and an exclamation."She must be found for all that," said he, "and
shall, if I have to send out Q.""An agent of mine who is a living interrogation point; so we call him
_Q,_ which is short for query."Then, as I turned again to go: "When the
contents of the will are made known, come to me."WAYS OPENING


    "It is not and it cannot come to good."Leavenworth, but did not see the
ladies before or after the ceremony.I, however, had a few moments'
conversation with Mr.Harwell; which, without eliciting anything new,
provided me with food for abundant conjecture.For he had asked, almost
at first greeting, if I had seen the _Telegram_ of the night before;
and when I responded in the affirmative, turned such a look of mingled
distress and appeal upon me, I was tempted to ask how such a frightful
insinuation against a young lady of reputation and breeding could ever
have got into the papers."That the guilty party might be driven by remorse to own himself the
true culprit."A curious remark to come from a person who had no knowledge or
suspicion of the criminal and his character; and I would have pushed
the conversation further, but the secretary, who was a man of few words,
drew off at this, and could be induced to say no more.Evidently it was
my business to cultivate Mr.Clavering, or any one else who could throw
any light upon the secret history of these girls.Veeley had arrived home, but
was in no condition to consult with me upon so painful a subject as
the murder of Mr.Also a line from Eleanore, giving me her
address, but requesting me at the same time not to call unless I had
something of importance to communicate, as she was too ill to receive
visitors.Ill, alone, and in a strange
home,--'twas pitiful!The next day, pursuant to the wishes of Mr.Gryce, in I stepped into the
Hoffman House, and took a seat in the reading room.I had been there but
a few moments when a gentleman entered whom I immediately recognized
as the same I had spoken to on the corner of Thirty-seventh Street
and Sixth Avenue.He must have remembered me also, for he seemed to be
slightly embarrassed at seeing me; but, recovering himself, took up a
paper and soon became to all appearance lost in its contents, though I
could feel his handsome black eye upon me, studying my features,
figure, apparel, and movements with a degree of interest which equally
astonished and disconcerted me.I felt that it would be injudicious on
my part to return his scrutiny, anxious as I was to meet his eye and
learn what emotion had so fired his curiosity in regard to a perfect
stranger; so I rose, and, crossing to an old friend of mine who sat at
a table opposite, commenced a desultory conversation, in the course of
which I took occasion to ask if he knew who the handsome stranger was.Dick Furbish was a society man, and knew everybody."His name is Clavering, and he comes from London.I don't know anything
more about him, though he is to be seen everywhere except in private
houses.He has not been received into society yet; waiting for letters
of introduction, perhaps.""Oh, yes; I talk to him, but the conversation is very one-sided."I could not help smiling at the grimace with which Dick accompanied this
remark."Which same goes to prove," he went on, "that he is the real
thing."Laughing outright this time, I left him, and in a few minutes sauntered
from the room.As I mingled again with the crowd on Broadway, I found myself wondering
immensely over this slight experience.That this unknown gentleman from
London, who went everywhere except into private houses, could be in
any way connected with the affair I had so at heart, seemed not only
improbable but absurd; and for the first time I felt tempted to doubt
the sagacity of Mr.The next day I repeated the experiment, but with no greater success
than before.Clavering came into the room, but, seeing me, did
not remain.I began to realize it was no easy matter to make his
acquaintance.To atone for my disappointment, I called on Mary
Leavenworth in the evening.She received me with almost a sister-like
familiarity."Ah," she cried, after introducing me to an elderly lady at her
side,--some connection of the family, I believe, who had come to remain
with her for a while,--"you are here to tell me Hannah is found; is it
not so?"I shook my head, sorry to disappoint her."No," said I; "not yet."Gryce was here to-day, and he told me he hoped she would be
heard from within twenty-four hours.""Yes; came to report how matters were progressing,--not that they seemed
to have advanced very far."You must not be so easily
discouraged.""But I cannot help it; every day, every hour that passes in this
uncertainty, is like a mountain weight here"; and she laid one trembling
hand upon her bosom."I would have the whole world at work.I would
leave no stone unturned; I----"

"What would you do?""Oh, I don't know," she cried, her whole manner suddenly changing;
"nothing, perhaps."Then, before I could reply to this: "Have you seen
Eleanore to-day?"She did not seem satisfied, but waited till her friend left the room
before saying more.Then, with an earnest look, inquired if I knew
whether Eleanore was well."I fear she is not," I returned."It is a great trial to me, Eleanore being away.Not," she resumed,
noting, perhaps, my incredulous look, "that I would have you think I
wish to disclaim my share in bringing about the present unhappy state
of things.I am willing to acknowledge I was the first to propose a
separation.But it is none the easier to bear on that account.""It is not as hard for you as for her," said I.because she is left comparatively poor, while I am
rich--is that what you would say?Ah," she went on, without waiting for
my answer, "would I could persuade Eleanore to share my riches with me!Willingly would I bestow upon her the half I have received; but I fear
she could never be induced to accept so much as a dollar from me.""Under the circumstances it would be better for her not to.""Just what I thought; yet it would ease me of a great weight if she
would.This fortune, suddenly thrown into my lap, sits like an incubus
upon me, Mr.When the will was read to-day which makes me
possessor of so much wealth, I could not but feel that a heavy, blinding
pall had settled upon me, spotted with blood and woven of horrors.Ah,
how different from the feelings with which I have been accustomed to
anticipate this day!Raymond," she went on, with a hurried
gasp, "dreadful as it seems now, I have been reared to look forward to
this hour with pride, if not with actual longing.Money has been made
so much of in my small world.Not that I wish in this evil time of
retribution to lay blame upon any one; least of all upon my uncle; but
from the day, twelve years ago, when for the first time he took us in
his arms, and looking down upon our childish faces, exclaimed: 'The
light-haired one pleases me best; she shall be my heiress,' I have
been petted, cajoled, and spoiled; called little princess, and uncle's
darling, till it is only strange I retain in this prejudiced breast any
of the impulses of generous womanhood; yes, though I was aware from the
first that whim alone had raised this distinction between myself and
cousin; a distinction which superior beauty, worth, or accomplishments
could never have drawn; Eleanore being more than my equal in all these
things."Pausing, she choked back the sudden sob that rose in her
throat, with an effort at self-control which was at once touching and
admirable.Then, while my eyes stole to her face, murmured in a low,
appealing voice: "If I have faults, you see there is some slight excuse
for them; arrogance, vanity, and selfishness being considered in the gay
young heiress as no more than so many assertions of a laudable dignity.ah," she bitterly exclaimed "money alone has been the ruin of us
all!"Then, with a falling of her voice: "And now it has come to me
with its heritage of evil, and I--I would give it all for--But this is
weakness!I have no right to afflict you with my griefs.Pray forget all
I have said, Mr.Raymond, or regard my complaints as the utterances of
an unhappy girl loaded down with sorrows and oppressed by the weight of
many perplexities and terrors.""But I do not wish to forget," I replied."You have spoken some good
words, manifested much noble emotion.Your possessions cannot but prove
a blessing to you if you enter upon them with such feelings as these."But, with a quick gesture, she ejaculated: "Impossible!Then, as if startled at her own words, bit her lip
and hastily added: "Very great wealth is never a blessing."And now," said she, with a total change of manner, "I wish to
address you on a subject which may strike you as ill-timed, but which,
nevertheless, I must mention, if the purpose I have at heart is ever to
be accomplished.My uncle, as you know, was engaged at the time of his
death in writing a book on Chinese customs and prejudices.It was a work
which he was anxious to see published, and naturally I desire to carry
out his wishes; but, in order to do so, I find it necessary not only
to interest myself in the matter now,--Mr.Harwell's services being
required, and it being my wish to dismiss that gentleman as soon as
possible--but to find some one competent to supervise its completion.Now I have heard,--I have been told,--that you were the one of all
others to do this; and though it is difficult if not improper for me to
ask so great a favor of one who but a week ago was a perfect stranger to
me, it would afford me the keenest pleasure if you would consent to look
over this manuscript and tell me what remains to be done."The timidity with which these words were uttered proved her to be in
earnest, and I could not but wonder at the strange coincidence of this
request with my secret wishes; it having been a question with me for
some time how I was to gain free access to this house without in any way
compromising either its inmates or myself.Gryce had been the one to recommend me to her favor in this respect.But, whatever satisfaction I may have experienced, I felt myself in duty
bound to plead my incompetence for a task so entirely out of the line
of my profession, and to suggest the employment of some one better
acquainted with such matters than myself.Harwell has notes and memoranda in plenty," she exclaimed, "and
can give you all the information necessary.You will have no difficulty;
indeed, you will not."He seems to be
a clever and diligent young man.""He thinks he can; but I know uncle never
trusted him with the composition of a single sentence.""But perhaps he will not be pleased,--Mr.Harwell, I mean--with the
intrusion of a stranger into his work.""That makes no difference," she
cried.Harwell is in my pay, and has nothing to say about it.I have already consulted him, and he expresses
himself as satisfied with the arrangement.""Very well," said I; "then I will promise to consider the subject.I
can at any rate look over the manuscript and give you my opinion of its
condition.""Oh, thank you," said she, with the prettiest gesture of satisfaction."How kind you are, and what can I ever do to repay you?and she moved towards the door; but
suddenly paused, whispering, with a short shudder of remembrance: "He is
in the library; do you mind?"Crushing down the sick qualm that arose at the mention of that spot, I
replied in the negative."The papers are all there, and he says he can work better in his old
place than anywhere else; but if you wish, I can call him down."But I would not listen to this, and myself led the way to the foot of
the stairs."I have sometimes thought I would lock up that room," she hurriedly
observed; "but something restrains me.I can no more do so than I can
leave this house; a power beyond myself forces me to confront all its
horrors.Sometimes, in the
darkness of the night--But I will not distress you.I have already said
too much; come," and with a sudden lift of the head she mounted the
stairs.Harwell was seated, when we entered that fatal room, in the one
chair of all others I expected to see unoccupied; and as I beheld his
meagre figure bending where such a little while before his eyes had
encountered the outstretched form of his murdered employer, I could not
but marvel over the unimaginativeness of the man who, in the face of
such memories, could not only appropriate that very spot for his own
use, but pursue his avocations there with so much calmness and evident
precision.But in another moment I discovered that the disposition of
the light in the room made that one seat the only desirable one for his
purpose; and instantly my wonder changed to admiration at this quiet
surrender of personal feeling to the requirements of the occasion.He looked up mechanically as we came in, but did not rise, his
countenance wearing the absorbed expression which bespeaks the
preoccupied mind."He is utterly oblivious," Mary whispered; "that is a way of his.I doubt if he knows who or what it is that has disturbed him."And,
advancing into the room, she passed across his line of vision, as if
to call attention to herself, and said: "I have brought Mr.Raymond
up-stairs to see you, Mr.He has been so kind as to accede to
my wishes in regard to the completion of the manuscript now before you."Harwell rose, wiped his pen, and put it away; manifesting,
however, a reluctance in doing so that proved this interference to be
in reality anything but agreeable to him.Observing this, I did not wait
for him to speak, but took up the pile of manuscript, arranged in one
mass on the table, saying:

"This seems to be very clearly written; if you will excuse me, I will
glance over it and thus learn something of its general character."He bowed, uttered a word or so of acquiescence, then, as Mary left the
room, awkwardly reseated himself, and took up his pen.Instantly the manuscript and all connected with it vanished from my
thoughts; and Eleanore, her situation, and the mystery surrounding
this family, returned upon me with renewed force.Looking the secretary
steadily in the face, I remarked:

"I am very glad of this opportunity of seeing you a moment alone, Mr.Harwell, if only for the purpose of saying----"

"Anything in regard to the murder?""Then you must pardon me," he respectfully but firmly replied."It is
a disagreeable subject which I cannot bear to think of, much less
discuss."Disconcerted and, what was more, convinced of the impossibility of
obtaining any information from this man, I abandoned the attempt; and,
taking up the manuscript once more, endeavored to master in some small
degree the nature of its contents.Succeeding beyond my hopes, I opened
a short conversation with him in regard to it, and finally, coming to
the conclusion I could accomplish what Miss Leavenworth desired, left
him and descended again to the reception room.When, an hour or so later, I withdrew from the house, it was with the
feeling that one obstacle had been removed from my path.If I failed
in what I had undertaken, it would not be from lack of opportunity of
studying the inmates of this dwelling.THE WILL OF A MILLIONAIRE


    "Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
     Which we ascribe to Heaven."THE next morning's _Tribune_ contained a synopsis of Mr.Its provisions were a surprise to me; for, while the bulk of his
immense estate was, according to the general understanding, bequeathed
to his niece, Mary, it appeared by a codicil, attached to his will some
five years before, that Eleanore was not entirely forgotten, she having
been made the recipient of a legacy which, if not large, was at least
sufficient to support her in comfort.After listening to the various
comments of my associates on the subject, I proceeded to the house
of Mr.Gryce, in obedience to his request to call upon him as soon as
possible after the publication of the will."Good-morning," he remarked as I entered, but whether addressing me or
the frowning top of the desk before which he was sitting it would be
difficult to say.nodding with a curious back movement
of his head towards a chair in his rear."I am curious to know," I remarked,
"what you have to say about this will, and its probable effect upon the
matters we have in hand.""What is your own idea in regard to it?""Well, I think upon the whole it will make but little difference in
public opinion.Those who thought Eleanore guilty before will feel that
they possess now greater cause than ever to doubt her innocence; while
those who have hitherto hesitated to suspect her will not consider
that the comparatively small amount bequeathed her would constitute an
adequate motive for so great a crime.""You have heard men talk; what seems to be the general opinion among
those you converse with?""That the motive of the tragedy will be found in the partiality shown in
so singular a will, though how, they do not profess to know."Gryce suddenly became interested in one of the small drawers before
him."And all this has not set you thinking?"I am sure I have
done nothing but think for the last three days.I----"

"Of course--of course," he cried."I didn't mean to say anything
disagreeable."Yes," said I; "Miss Leavenworth has requested me to do her that little
favor."Then, with an instant return to his business-like tone: "You are going
to have opportunities, Mr.Now there are two things I want you
to find out; first, what is the connection between these ladies and Mr.Clavering----"

"There is a connection, then?"And secondly, what is the cause of the unfriendly feeling
which evidently exists between the cousins."I drew back and pondered the position offered me.A spy in a fair
woman's house!How could I reconcile it with my natural instincts as a
gentleman?"Cannot you find some one better adapted to learn these secrets for
you?""The part of a spy is anything but agreeable to
my feelings, I assure you."Leavenworth's
manuscript for the press," I said; "I will give Mr.Clavering an
opportunity to form my acquaintance; and I will listen, if Miss
Leavenworth chooses to make me her confidant in any way.But any
hearkening at doors, surprises, unworthy feints or ungentlemanly
subterfuges, I herewith disclaim as outside of my province; my task
being to find out what I can in an open way, and yours to search into
the nooks and corners of this wretched business.""In other words, you are to play the hound, and I the mole; just so, I
know what belongs to a gentleman.""And now," said I, "what news of Hannah?"I cannot say I was greatly surprised, that evening, when, upon
descending from an hour's labor with Mr.Harwell, I encountered Miss
Leavenworth standing at the foot of the stairs.There had been something
in her bearing, the night before, which prepared me for another
interview this evening, though her manner of commencing it was a
surprise.Raymond," said she, with an air of marked embarrassment,
"I want to ask you a question.I believe you to be a good man, and I
know you will answer me conscientiously.As a brother would," she added,
lifting her eyes for a moment to my face."I know it will sound strange;
but remember, I have no adviser but you, and I must ask some one.Raymond, do you think a person could do something that was very wrong,
and yet grow to be thoroughly good afterwards?""Certainly," I replied; "if he were truly sorry for his fault.""But say it was more than a fault; say it was an actual harm; would not
the memory of that one evil hour cast a lasting shadow over one's life?""That depends upon the nature of the harm and its effect upon others.If one had irreparably injured a fellow-being, it would be hard for a
person of sensitive nature to live a happy life afterwards; though the
fact of not living a happy life ought to be no reason why one should not
live a good life.""But to live a good life would it be necessary to reveal the evil you
had done?Cannot one go on and do right without confessing to the world
a past wrong?""Yes, unless by its confession he can in some way make reparation."Drawing back, she stood for one moment
in a thoughtful attitude before me, her beauty shining with almost a
statuesque splendor in the glow of the porcelain-shaded lamp at her
side.Nor, though she presently roused herself, leading the way into the
drawing-room with a gesture that was allurement itself, did she recur to
this topic again; but rather seemed to strive, in the conversation that
followed, to make me forget what had already passed between us.That she
did not succeed, was owing to my intense and unfailing interest in her
cousin.As I descended the stoop, I saw Thomas, the butler, leaning over the
area gate.Immediately I was seized with an impulse to interrogate him
in regard to a matter which had more or less interested me ever since
the inquest; and that was, who was the Mr.Robbins who had called
upon Eleanore the night of the murder?He remembered such a person called, but could not
describe his looks any further than to say that he was not a small man.THE BEGINNING OF GREAT SURPRISES


    "Vous regardez une etoile pour deux motifs, parce qu'elle est
    lumineuse et parce qu'elle est impenetrable.Vous avez aupres
    de vous un plus doux rayonnement et un pas grand mystere, la femme."AND now followed days in which I seemed to make little or no progress.Clavering, disturbed perhaps by my presence, forsook his usual
haunts, thus depriving me of all opportunity of making his acquaintance
in any natural manner, while the evenings spent at Miss Leavenworth's
were productive of little else than constant suspense and uneasiness.But, in the
course of making such few changes as were necessary, I had ample
opportunity of studying the character of Mr.I found him to be
neither more nor less than an excellent amanuensis.Stiff, unbending,
and sombre, but true to his duty and reliable in its performance, I
learned to respect him, and even to like him; and this, too, though I
saw the liking was not reciprocated, whatever the respect may have been.He never spoke of Eleanore Leavenworth or, indeed, mentioned the family
or its trouble in any way; till I began to feel that all this reticence
had a cause deeper than the nature of the man, and that if he did
speak, it would be to some purpose.This suspicion, of course, kept me
restlessly eager in his presence.I could not forbear giving him sly
glances now and then, to see how he acted when he believed himself
unobserved; but he was ever the same, a passive, diligent, unexcitable
worker.This continual beating against a stone wall, for thus I regarded it,
became at last almost unendurable.Clavering shy, and the secretary
unapproachable--how was I to gain anything?The short interviews I had
with Mary did not help matters.Haughty, constrained, feverish, pettish,
grateful, appealing, everything at once, and never twice the same, I
learned to dread, even while I coveted, an interview.She appeared to be
passing through some crisis which occasioned her the keenest suffering.I have seen her, when she thought herself alone, throw up her hands
with the gesture which we use to ward off a coming evil or shut out some
hideous vision.I have likewise beheld her standing with her proud head
abased, her nervous hands drooping, her whole form sinking and inert, as
if the pressure of a weight she could neither upbear nor cast aside
had robbed her even of the show of resistance.Ordinarily she was at least stately in her trouble.Even when the
softest appeal came into her eyes she stood erect, and retained her
expression of conscious power.Even the night she met me in the hall,
with feverish cheeks and lips trembling with eagerness, only to turn and
fly again without giving utterance to what she had to say, she comported
herself with a fiery dignity that was well nigh imposing.That all this meant something, I was sure; and so I kept my patience
alive with the hope that some day she would make a revelation.Those
quivering lips would not always remain closed; the secret involving
Eleanore's honor and happiness would be divulged by this restless being,
if by no one else.Nor was the memory of that extraordinary, if not
cruel, accusation I had heard her make enough to destroy this hope--for
hope it had grown to be--so that I found myself insensibly shortening
my time with Mr.Harwell in the library, and extending my _tete-a-tete_
visits with Mary in the reception room, till the imperturbable secretary
was forced to complain that he was often left for hours without work.But, as I say, days passed, and a second Monday evening came round
without seeing me any further advanced upon the problem I had set myself
to solve than when I first started upon it two weeks before.The subject
of the murder had not even been broached; nor was Hannah spoken of,
though I observed the papers were not allowed to languish an instant
upon the stoop; mistress and servants betraying equal interest in their
contents.It was as if you saw a group of
human beings eating, drinking, and sleeping upon the sides of a volcano
hot with a late eruption and trembling with the birth of a new one.I
longed to break this silence as we shiver glass: by shouting the name
of Eleanore through those gilded rooms and satin-draped vestibules.But
this Monday evening I was in a calmer mood.I was determined to expect
nothing from my visits to Mary Leavenworth's house; and entered it upon
the eve in question with an equanimity such as I had not experienced
since the first day I passed under its unhappy portals.But when, upon nearing the reception room, I saw Mary pacing the floor
with the air of one who is restlessly awaiting something or somebody,
I took a sudden resolution, and, advancing towards her, said: "Do I see
you alone, Miss Leavenworth?"She paused in her hurried action, blushed and bowed, but, contrary to
her usual custom, did not bid me enter."Will it be too great an intrusion on my part, if I venture to come in?"Her glance flashed uneasily to the clock, and she seemed about to excuse
herself, but suddenly yielded, and, drawing up a chair before the fire,
motioned me towards it.Though she endeavored to appear calm, I vaguely
felt I had chanced upon her in one of her most agitated moods, and that
I had only to broach the subject I had in mind to behold her haughtiness
disappear before me like melting snow.I also felt that I had but few
moments in which to do it."Miss Leavenworth," said I, "in obtruding upon you to-night, I have a
purpose other than that of giving myself a pleasure.Instantly I saw that in some way I had started wrong.she asked, breathing coldness from every feature of her face."Yes," I went on, with passionate recklessness."Balked in every other
endeavor to learn the truth, I have come to you, whom I believe to be
noble at the core, for that help which seems likely to fail us in every
other direction: for the word which, if it does not absolutely save your
cousin, will at least put us upon the track of what will.""I do not understand what you mean," she protested, slightly shrinking."Miss Leavenworth," I pursued, "it is needless for me to tell you in
what position your cousin stands.You, who remember both the form and
drift of the questions put to her at the inquest, comprehend it all
without any explanation from me.But what you may not know is this, that
unless she is speedily relieved from the suspicion which, justly or not,
has attached itself to her name, the consequences which such suspicion
entails must fall upon her, and----"

"Good God!"she cried; "you do not mean she will be----"

"Subject to arrest?Shame, horror, and anguish were in every line of her
white face."Why," she cried, flushing painfully; "I cannot say; didn't you tell
me?"No, I did
not, either," she avowed, in a sudden burst of shame and penitence."I
knew it was a secret; but--oh, Mr.Raymond, it was Eleanore herself who
told me.""Yes, that last evening she was here; we were together in the
drawing-room.""That the key to the library had been seen in her possession."Eleanore, conscious of the
suspicion with which her cousin regarded her, inform that cousin of a
fact calculated to add weight to that suspicion?"I have revealed nothing I ought to
have kept secret?""No," said I; "and, Miss Leavenworth, it is this thing which makes
your cousin's position absolutely dangerous.It is a fact that,
left unexplained, must ever link her name with infamy; a bit of
circumstantial evidence no sophistry can smother, and no denial
obliterate.Only her hitherto spotless reputation, and the efforts of
one who, notwithstanding appearances, believes in her innocence, keeps
her so long from the clutch of the officers of justice.That key, and
the silence preserved by her in regard to it, is sinking her slowly into
a pit from which the utmost endeavors of her best friends will soon be
inadequate to extricate her.""And you tell me this----"

"That you may have pity on the poor girl, who will not have pity on
herself, and by the explanation of a few circumstances, which cannot be
mysteries to you, assist in bringing her from under the dreadful shadow
that threatens to overwhelm her.""And would you insinuate, sir," she cried, turning upon me with a look
of great anger, "that I know any more than you do of this matter?that
I possess any knowledge which I have not already made public concerning
the dreadful tragedy which has transformed our home into a desert, our
existence into a lasting horror?Has the blight of suspicion fallen upon
me, too; and have you come to accuse me in my own house----"

"Miss Leavenworth," I entreated; "calm yourself.I only desire you to enlighten me as to your cousin's probable
motive for this criminating silence.You
are her cousin, almost her sister, have been at all events her daily
companion for years, and must know for whom or for what she seals her
lips, and conceals facts which, if known, would direct suspicion to the
real criminal--that is, if you really believe what you have hitherto
stated, that your cousin is an innocent woman."She not making any answer to this, I rose and confronted her."Miss
Leavenworth, do you believe your cousin guiltless of this crime, or
not?"my God; if all the world were only as innocent
as she!""Then," said I, "you must likewise believe that if she refrains from
speaking in regard to matters which to ordinary observers ought to be
explained, she does it only from motives of kindness towards one less
guiltless than herself."No, no; I do not say that.What made you think of any such
explanation?"With one of Eleanore's character, such conduct
as hers admits of no other construction.Either she is mad, or she is
shielding another at the expense of herself."Mary's lip, which had trembled, slowly steadied itself."And whom
have you settled upon, as the person for whom Eleanore thus sacrifices
herself?""Ah," said I, "there is where I seek assistance from you.With your
knowledge of her history----"

But Mary Leavenworth, sinking haughtily back into her chair, stopped
me with a quiet gesture."I beg your pardon," said she; "but you make a
mistake.I know little or nothing of Eleanore's personal feelings.The
mystery must be solved by some one besides me.""When Eleanore confessed to you that the missing key had been seen in
her possession, did she likewise inform you where she obtained it, and
for what reason she was hiding it?""Merely told you the fact, without any explanation?""Was not that a strange piece of gratuitous information for her to
give one who, but a few hours before, had accused her to the face of
committing a deadly crime?""You will not deny that you were once, not only ready to believe her
guilty, but that you actually charged her with having perpetrated this
crime.""Miss Leavenworth, do you not remember what you said in that room
upstairs, when you were alone with your cousin on the morning of the
inquest, just before Mr.Her eyes did not fall, but they filled with sudden terror.I was just outside the door, and----"

"What did you hear?"It seemed as if her eyes would devour my face."Yet nothing was said
when you came in?""You, however, have never forgotten it?""How could we, Miss Leavenworth?"Her head fell forward in her hands, and for one wild moment she seemed
lost in despair.Then she roused, and desperately exclaimed:

"And that is why you come here to-night.With that sentence written upon
your heart, you invade my presence, torture me with questions----"

"Pardon me," I broke in; "are my questions such as you, with reasonable
regard for the honor of one with whom you are accustomed to associate,
should hesitate to answer?Do I derogate from my manhood in asking you
how and why you came to make an accusation of so grave a nature, at a
time when all the circumstances of the case were freshly before you,
only to insist fully as strongly upon your cousin's innocence when
you found there was even more cause for your imputation than you had
supposed?""Miss Leavenworth," said I, rising, and taking my stand before her;
"although there is a temporary estrangement between you and your cousin,
you cannot wish to seem her enemy.Speak, then; let me at least know the
name of him for whom she thus immolates herself.A hint from you----"

But rising, with a strange look, to her feet, she interrupted me with a
stern remark: "If you do not know, I cannot inform you; do not ask me,
Mr.And she glanced at the clock for the second time."Miss Leavenworth, you once asked me if a person who had committed a
wrong ought necessarily to confess it; and I replied no, unless by the
confession reparation could be made.Her lips moved, but no words issued from them."I begin to think," I solemnly proceeded, following the lead of her
emotion, "that confession is the only way out of this difficulty: that
only by the words you can utter Eleanore can be saved from the doom that
awaits her.Will you not then show yourself a true woman by responding
to my earnest entreaties?"I seemed to have touched the right chord; for she trembled, and a look
of wistfulness filled her eyes.Eleanore
persists in silence; but that is no reason why you should emulate her
example.You only make her position more doubtful by it.""I know it; but I cannot help myself.Fate has too strong a hold upon
me; I cannot break away."Any one can escape from bonds imaginary as yours.""No, no," she protested; "you do not understand.""I understand this: that the path of rectitude is a straight one, and
that he who steps into devious byways is going astray."A flicker of light, pathetic beyond description, flashed for a moment
across her face; her throat rose as with one wild sob; her lips opened;
she seemed yielding, when--A sharp ring at the front door-bell!"Oh," she cried, sharply turning, "tell him I cannot see him; tell
him----"

"Miss Leavenworth," said I, taking her by both hands, "never mind the
door; never mind anything but this.I have asked you a question which
involves the mystery of this whole affair; answer me, then, for your
soul's sake; tell me, what the unhappy circumstances were which could
induce you--"

But she tore her hands from mine.she cried; "it will open,
and--"

Stepping into the hall, I met Thomas coming up the basement stairs."Go
back," said I; "I will call you when you are wanted.""You expect me to answer," she exclaimed, when I re-entered, "now, in a
moment?"But----"

"Impossible!""I fear the time will never come, if you do not speak now.""You may open the door now,"
said I, and moved to return to her side.But, with a gesture of command, she pointed up-stairs.and
her glance passed on to Thomas, who stopped where he was."I will see you again before I go," said I, and hastened up-stairs.I heard a rich,
tremulous voice inquire."Yes, sir," came in the butler's most respectful and measured accents,
and, leaning over the banisters I beheld, to my amazement, the form of
Mr.Clavering enter the front hall and move towards the reception room.ON THE STAIRS


    "You cannot _say_ I did it."EXCITED, tremulous, filled with wonder at this unlooked-for event, I
paused for a moment to collect my scattered senses, when the sound of
a low, monotonous voice breaking upon my ear from the direction of the
library, I approached and found Mr.Harwell reading aloud from his late
employer's manuscript.It would be difficult for me to describe the
effect which this simple discovery made upon me at this time.There,
in that room of late death, withdrawn from the turmoil of the world, a
hermit in his skeleton-lined cell, this man employed himself in reading
and rereading, with passive interest, the words of the dead, while above
and below, human beings agonized in doubt and shame.Listening, I heard
these words:

"By these means their native rulers will not only lose their jealous
terror of our institutions, but acquire an actual curiosity in regard to
them."you are late, sir," was the greeting with which he rose and brought
forward a chair.My reply was probably inaudible, for he added, as he passed to his own
seat:

"I am afraid you are not well."And, pulling the papers towards me, I began looking them
over.But the words danced before my eyes, and I was obliged to give up
all attempt at work for that night."_I_ fear I am unable to assist you this evening, Mr.The fact
is, I find it difficult to give proper attention to this business while
the man who by a dastardly assassination has made it necessary goes
unpunished."The secretary in his turn pushed the papers aside, as if moved by a
sudden distaste of them, but gave me no answer."You told me, when you first came to me with news of this fearful
tragedy, that it was a mystery; but it is one which must be solved,
Mr.Harwell; it is wearing out the lives of too many whom we love and
respect.""And Miss Mary," I went on; "myself, you, and many others.""You have manifested much interest in the matter from the
beginning,"--he said, methodically dipping his pen into the ink."And you," said I; "do you take no interest in that which involves not
only the safety, but the happiness and honor, of the family in which you
have dwelt so long?""I have no wish to discuss
this subject.I believe I have before prayed you to spare me its
introduction.""But I cannot consider your wishes in this regard," I persisted."If you
know any facts, connected with this affair, which have not yet been made
public, it is manifestly your duty to state them.The position which
Miss Eleanore occupies at this time is one which should arouse the sense
of justice in every true breast; and if you----"

"If I knew anything which would serve to release her from her unhappy
position, Mr.Raymond, I should have spoken long ago."I bit my lip, weary of these continual bafflings, and rose also."If you have nothing more to say," he went on, "and feel utterly
disinclined to work, why, I should be glad to excuse myself, as I have
an engagement out.""Do not let me keep you," I said, bitterly.He turned upon me with a short stare, as if this display of feeling
was well nigh incomprehensible to him; and then, with a quiet, almost
compassionate bow left the room.I heard him go up-stairs, felt the
jar when his room door closed, and sat down to enjoy my solitude.But
solitude in that room was unbearable.Harwell again
descended, I felt I could remain no longer, and, stepping into the hall,
told him that if he had no objection I would accompany him for a short
stroll.He bowed a stiff assent, and hastened before me down the stairs.By the
time I had closed the library door, he was half-way to the foot, and I
was just remarking to myself upon the unpliability of his figure and the
awkwardness of his carriage, as seen from my present standpoint, when
suddenly I saw him stop, clutch the banister at his side, and hang there
with a startled, deathly expression upon his half-turned countenance,
which fixed me for an instant where I was in breathless astonishment,
and then caused me to rush down to his side, catch him by the arm, and
cry:

"What is it?But, thrusting out his hand, he pushed me upwards.he
whispered, in a voice shaking with intensest emotion, "go back."And
catching me by the arm, he literally pulled me up the stairs.Arrived
at the top, he loosened his grasp, and leaning, quivering from head to
foot, over the banisters, glared below.Startled in my turn, I bent beside him, and saw Henry Clavering come out
of the reception room and cross the hall.Clavering," I whispered, with all the self-possession I
could muster; "do you know him?""Clavering, Clavering,"
he murmured with quaking lips; then, suddenly bounding forward, clutched
the railing before him, and fixing me with his eyes, from which all the
stoic calmness had gone down forever in flame and frenzy, gurgled into
my ear: "You want to know who the assassin of Mr.Look there, then: that is the man, Clavering!"And with a leap, he
bounded from my side, and, swaying like a drunken man, disappeared from
my gaze in the hall above.Rushing upstairs, I knocked at the
door of his room, but no response came to my summons.I then called
his name in the hall, but without avail; he was determined not to show
himself.Resolved that he should not thus escape me, I returned to the
library, and wrote him a short note, in which I asked for an explanation
of his tremendous accusation, saying I would be in my rooms the next
evening at six, when I should expect to see him.This done I descended
to rejoin Mary.But the evening was destined to be full of disappointments.She had
retired to her room while I was in the library, and I lost the interview
from which I expected so much."The woman is slippery as an eel," I
inwardly commented, pacing the hall in my chagrin."Wrapped in mystery,
she expects me to feel for her the respect due to one of frank and open
nature."I was about to leave the house, when I saw Thomas descending the stairs
with a letter in his hand."Miss Leavenworth's compliments, sir, and she is too fatigued to remain
below this evening."I moved aside to read the note he handed me, feeling a little
conscience-stricken as I traced the hurried, trembling handwriting
through the following words:


    "You ask more than I can give.Matters must be received as they are
    without explanation from me.It is the grief of my life to deny you;
    but I have no choice.God forgive us all and keep us from despair.And below:


    "As we cannot meet now without embarrassment, it is better we should
    bear our burdens in silence and apart.As I was crossing Thirty-second Street, I heard a quick footstep behind
me, and turning, saw Thomas at my side."Excuse me, sir," said he, "but
I have something a little particular to say to you.When you asked me
the other night what sort of a person the gentleman was who called
on Miss Eleanore the evening of the murder, I didn't answer you as I
should.The fact is, the detectives had been talking to me about that
very thing, and I felt shy; but, sir, I know you are a friend of the
family, and I want to tell you now that that same gentleman, whoever
he was,--Mr.Robbins, he called himself then,--was at the house again
tonight, sir, and the name he gave me this time to carry to Miss
Leavenworth was Clavering.Yes, sir," he went on, seeing me start; "and,
as I told Molly, he acts queer for a stranger.When he came the other
night, he hesitated a long time before asking for Miss Eleanore, and
when I wanted his name, took out a card and wrote on it the one I told
you of, sir, with a look on his face a little peculiar for a caller;
besides----"

"Well?"Raymond," the butler went on, in a low, excited voice, edging up
very closely to me in the darkness."There is something I have never
told any living being but Molly, sir, which may be of use to those as
wishes to find out who committed this murder.""A fact, sir; which I beg your pardon for troubling you with at this
time; but Molly will give me no rest unless I speak of it to you or Mr.Gryce; her feelings being so worked up on Hannah's account, whom we all
know is innocent, though folks do dare to say as how she must be guilty
just because she is not to be found the minute they want her."Gryce," he resumed,
unconscious of my anxiety, "but I have my fears of detectives, sir; they
catch you up so quick at times, and seem to think you know so much more
than you really do.""But this fact," I again broke in."O yes, sir; the fact is, that that night, the one of the murder you
know, I saw Mr.Clavering, Robbins, or whatever his name is, enter the
house, but neither I nor any one else saw him go out of it; nor do I
know that he _did."_

"What do you mean?""Well, sir, what I mean is this.When I came down from Miss Eleanore and
told Mr.Robbins, as he called himself at that time, that my mistress
was ill and unable to see him (the word she gave me, sir, to deliver)
Mr.Robbins, instead of bowing and leaving the house like a gentleman,
stepped into the reception room and sat down.He may have felt sick, he
looked pale enough; at any rate, he asked me for a glass of water.Not knowing any reason then for suspicionating any one's actions, I
immediately went down to the kitchen for it, leaving him there in the
reception room alone.But before I could get it, I heard the front door
close.said Molly, who was helping me, sir.'I don't
know,' said I, 'unless it's the gentleman has got tired of waiting and
gone.''If he's gone, he won't want the water,' she said.So down I set
the pitcher, and up-stairs I come; and sure enough he was gone, or so
I thought then.But who knows, sir, if he was not in that room or the
drawing-room, which was dark that night, all the time I was a-shutting
up of the house?"I made no reply to this; I was more startled than I cared to reveal."You see, sir, I wouldn't speak of such a thing about any person that
comes to see the young ladies; but we all know some one who was in the
house that night murdered my master, and as it was not Hannah----"

"You say that Miss Eleanore refused to see him," I interrupted, in the
hope that the simple suggestion would be enough to elicitate further
details of his interview with Eleanore.When she first looked at the card, she showed a little
hesitation; but in a moment she grew very flushed in the face, and bade
me say what I told you.I should never have thought of it again if I had
not seen him come blazoning and bold into the house this evening, with
a new name on his tongue.Indeed, and I do not like to think any evil of
him now; but Molly would have it I should speak to you, sir, and ease my
mind,--and that is all, sir."When I arrived home that night, I entered into my memorandum-book a
new list of suspicious circumstances, but this time they were under the
caption "C" instead of "E."IN MY OFFICE


    "Something between an hindrance and a help."THE next day as, with nerves unstrung and an exhausted brain, I entered
my office, I was greeted by the announcement:

"A gentleman, sir, in your private room--been waiting some time, very
impatient."Weary, in no mood to hold consultation with clients new or old, I
advanced with anything but an eager step towards my room, when, upon
opening the door, I saw--Mr.Too much astounded for the moment to speak, I bowed to him silently,
whereupon he approached me with the air and dignity of a highly bred
gentleman, and presented his card, on which I saw written, in free and
handsome characters, his whole name, Henry Ritchie Clavering.After this
introduction of himself, he apologized for making so unceremonious
a call, saying, in excuse, that he was a stranger in town; that his
business was one of great urgency; that he had casually heard honorable
mention of me as a lawyer and a gentleman, and so had ventured to seek
this interview on behalf of a friend who was so unfortunately situated
as to require the opinion and advice of a lawyer upon a question which
not only involved an extraordinary state of facts, but was of a nature
peculiarly embarrassing to him, owing to his ignorance of American laws,
and the legal bearing of these facts upon the same.Having thus secured my attention, and awakened my curiosity, he asked me
if I would permit him to relate his story.Recovering in a measure from
my astonishment, and subduing the extreme repulsion, almost horror,
I felt for the man, I signified my assent; at which he drew from his
pocket a memorandum-book from which he read in substance as follows:

"An Englishman travelling in this country meets, at a fashionable
watering-place, an American girl, with whom he falls deeply in love, and
whom, after a few days, he desires to marry.Knowing his position to be
good, his fortune ample, and his intentions highly honorable, he offers
her his hand, and is accepted.But a decided opposition arising in the
family to the match, he is compelled to disguise his sentiments, though
the engagement remained unbroken.While matters were in this uncertain
condition, he received advices from England demanding his instant
return, and, alarmed at the prospect of a protracted absence from the
object of his affections, he writes to the lady, informing her of
the circumstances, and proposing a secret marriage.She consents with
stipulations; the first of which is, that he should leave her instantly
upon the conclusion of the ceremony, and the second, that he should
intrust the public declaration of the marriage to her.It was not
precisely what he wished, but anything which served to make her his
own was acceptable at such a crisis.He readily enters into the plans
proposed.Meeting the lady at a parsonage, some twenty miles from the
watering-place at which she was staying, he stands up with her before
a Methodist preacher, and the ceremony of marriage is performed.There
were two witnesses, a hired man of the minister, called in for the
purpose, and a lady friend who came with the bride; but there was no
license, and the bride had not completed her twenty-first year.If the lady, wedded in good faith upon that day by
my friend, chooses to deny that she is his lawful wife, can he hold
her to a compact entered into in so informal a manner?Raymond, is my friend the lawful husband of that girl or not?"While listening to this story, I found myself yielding to feelings
greatly in contrast to those with which I greeted the relator but a
moment before.I became so interested in his "friend's" case as to
quite forget, for the time being, that I had ever seen or heard of Henry
Clavering; and after learning that the marriage ceremony took place in
the State of New York, I replied to him, as near as I can remember, in
the following words:

"In this State, and I believe it to be American law, marriage is a
civil contract, requiring neither license, priest, ceremony, nor
certificate--and in some cases witnesses are not even necessary to give
it validity.Of old, the modes of getting a wife were the same as those
of acquiring any other species of property, and they are not materially
changed at the present time.It is enough that the man and woman say to
each other, 'From this time we are married,' or, 'You are now my wife,'
or,'my husband,' as the case may be.The mutual consent is all that is
necessary.In fact, you may contract marriage as you contract to lend a
sum of money, or to buy the merest trifle.""Then your opinion is----"

"That upon your statement, your friend is the lawful husband of the lady
in question; presuming, of course, that no legal disabilities of either
party existed to prevent such a union.As to the young lady's age, I
will merely say that any fourteen-year-old girl can be a party to a
marriage contract."Clavering bowed, his countenance assuming a look of great
satisfaction."I am very glad to hear this," said he; "my friend's
happiness is entirely involved in the establishment of his marriage."He appeared so relieved, my curiosity was yet further aroused.I
therefore said: "I have given you my opinion as to the legality of this
marriage; but it may be quite another thing to prove it, should the same
be contested."He started, cast me an inquiring look, and murmured:

"True.""Allow me to ask you a few questions.Was the lady married under her own
name?""Properly signed by the minister and witnesses?""I cannot say; but I presume she did.""The witnesses were----"

"A hired man of the minister----"

"Who can be found?""The minister is dead, the man has disappeared.""The other witness, the lady friend, where is she?""She can be found; but her action is not to be depended upon.""Has the gentleman himself no proofs of this marriage?""He cannot even prove he was in the town
where it took place on that particular day.""The marriage certificate was, however, filed with the clerk of the
town?"I only know that my friend has made inquiry, and that no
such paper is to be found.""I do not wonder your friend is
concerned in regard to his position, if what you hint is true, and the
lady seems disposed to deny that any such ceremony ever took place.Still, if he wishes to go to law, the Court may decide in his favor,
though I doubt it.His sworn word is all he would have to go upon, and
if she contradicts his testimony under oath, why the sympathy of a jury
is, as a rule, with the woman."Clavering rose, looked at me with some earnestness, and finally
asked, in a tone which, though somewhat changed, lacked nothing of its
former suavity, if I would be kind enough to give him in writing that
portion of my opinion which directly bore upon the legality of the
marriage; that such a paper would go far towards satisfying his friend
that his case had been properly presented; as he was aware that no
respectable lawyer would put his name to a legal opinion without first
having carefully arrived at his conclusions by a thorough examination of
the law bearing upon the facts submitted.This request seeming so reasonable, I unhesitatingly complied with it,
and handed him the opinion.He took it, and, after reading it carefully
over, deliberately copied it into his memorandum-book.This done, he
turned towards me, a strong, though hitherto subdued, emotion showing
itself in his countenance."Now, sir," said he, rising upon me to the full height of his majestic
figure, "I have but one more request to make; and that is, that you will
receive back this opinion into your own possession, and in the day you
think to lead a beautiful woman to the altar, pause and ask yourself:
'Am I sure that the hand I clasp with such impassioned fervor is free?Have I any certainty for knowing that it has not already been given
away, like that of the lady whom, in this opinion of mine, I have
declared to be a wedded wife according to the laws of my country? '"But he, with an urbane bow, laid his hand upon the knob of the door."I
thank you for your courtesy, Mr.Raymond, and I bid you good-day.I hope
you will have no need of consulting that paper before I see you again."It was the most vital shock I had yet experienced; and for a moment
I stood paralyzed.Why should he mix me up with the affair
unless--but I would not contemplate that possibility.Eleanore married,
and to this man?And yet I found myself
continually turning the supposition over in my mind until, to escape
the torment of my own conjectures, I seized my hat, and rushed into
the street in the hope of finding him again and extorting from him an
explanation of his mysterious conduct.But by the time I reached the
sidewalk, he was nowhere to be seen.A thousand busy men, with their
various cares and purposes, had pushed themselves between us, and I was
obliged to return to my office with my doubts unsolved.I think I never experienced a longer day; but it passed, and at five
o'clock I had the satisfaction of inquiring for Mr.Clavering at the
Hoffman House.Judge of my surprise when I learned that his visit to
my office was his last action before taking passage upon the steamer
leaving that day for Liverpool; that he was now on the high seas, and
all chance of another interview with him was at an end.I could scarcely
believe the fact at first; but after a talk with the cabman who
had driven him off to my office and thence to the steamer, I became
convinced.I had been brought face to
face with the accused man, had received an intimation from him that he
was not expecting to see me again for some time, and had weakly gone on
attending to my own affairs and allowed him to escape, like the simple
tyro that I was.My next, the necessity of notifying Mr.But it was now six o'clock, the hour set apart for my
interview with Mr.I could not afford to miss that, so merely
stopping to despatch a line to Mr.Gryce, in which I promised to visit
him that evening, I turned my steps towards home."Often do the spirits
    Of great events stride on before the events,
    And in to-day already walks to-morrow."What revelations might not this man
be going to make!But I subdued the feeling; and, greeting him with what
cordiality I could, settled myself to listen to his explanations.But Trueman Harwell had no explanations to give, or so it seemed; on
the contrary, he had come to apologize for the very violent words he had
used the evening before; words which, whatever their effect upon me, he
now felt bound to declare had been used without sufficient basis in fact
to make their utterance of the least importance."But you must have thought you had grounds for so tremendous an
accusation, or your act was that of a madman."His brow wrinkled heavily, and his eyes assumed a very gloomy
expression."Under the pressure of
surprise, I have known men utter convictions no better founded than mine
without running the risk of being called mad."Clavering's face or form must, then, have been known to
you.The mere fact of seeing a strange gentleman in the hall would have
been insufficient to cause you astonishment, Mr.He uneasily fingered the back of the chair before which he stood, but
made no reply."Sit down," I again urged, this time with a touch of command in my
voice."This is a serious matter, and I intend to deal with it as it
deserves.You once said that if you knew anything which might serve
to exonerate Eleanore Leavenworth from the suspicion under which she
stands, you would be ready to impart it."I said that if I had ever known anything calculated to
release her from her unhappy position, I would have spoken," he coldly
corrected.You know, and I know, that you are keeping something
back; and I ask you, in her behalf, and in the cause of justice, to tell
me what it is.""You are mistaken," was his dogged reply."I have reasons, perhaps, for
certain conclusions I may have drawn; but my conscience will not allow
me in cold blood to give utterance to suspicions which may not only
damage the reputation of an honest man, but place me in the unpleasant
position of an accuser without substantial foundation for my
accusations.""You occupy that position already," I retorted, with equal coldness."Nothing can make me forget that in my presence you have denounced Henry
Clavering as the murderer of Mr.You had better explain
yourself, Mr.He gave me a short look, but moved around and took the chair."You have
me at a disadvantage," he said, in a lighter tone."If you choose to
profit by your position, and press me to disclose the little I know, I
can only regret the necessity under which I lie, and speak.""Then you are deterred by conscientious scruples alone?""Yes, and by the meagreness of the facts at my command.""I will judge of the facts when I have heard them."He raised his eyes to mine, and I was astonished to observe a strange
eagerness in their depths; evidently his convictions were stronger
than his scruples.Raymond," he began, "you are a lawyer, and
undoubtedly a practical man; but you may know what it is to scent danger
before you see it, to feel influences working in the air over and
about you, and yet be in ignorance of what it is that affects you so
powerfully, till chance reveals that an enemy has been at your side, or
a friend passed your window, or the shadow of death crossed your book as
you read, or mingled with your breath as you slept?"I shook my head, fascinated by the intensity of his gaze into some sort
of response."Then you cannot understand me, or what I have suffered these last three
weeks."And he drew back with an icy reserve that seemed to promise but
little to my now thoroughly awakened curiosity."I beg your pardon," I hastened to say; "but the fact of my never having
experienced such sensations does not hinder me from comprehending the
emotions of others more affected by spiritual influences than myself.""Then you will not ridicule me if I say
that upon the eve of Mr.Leavenworth's murder I experienced in a dream
all that afterwards occurred; saw him murdered, saw"--and he clasped
his hands before him, in an attitude inexpressibly convincing, while his
voice sank to a horrified whisper, "saw the face of his murderer!"I started, looked at him in amazement, a thrill as at a ghostly presence
running through me."My reason for denouncing the man I beheld before me in the hall of
Miss Leavenworth's house last night?And, taking out his
handkerchief, he wiped his forehead, on which the perspiration was
standing in large drops."You would then intimate that the face you saw in your dream and the
face you saw in the hall last night were the same?"I had gone to bed
feeling especially contented with myself and the world at large; for,
though my life is anything but a happy one," and he heaved a short sigh,
"some pleasant words had been said to me that day, and I was revelling
in the happiness they conferred, when suddenly a chill struck my heart,
and the darkness which a moment before had appeared to me as the abode
of peace thrilled to the sound of a supernatural cry, and I heard my
name, 'Trueman, Trueman, Trueman,' repeated three times in a voice I did
not recognize, and starting from my pillow beheld at my bedside a woman.Her face was strange to me," he solemnly proceeded, "but I can give you
each and every detail of it, as, bending above me, she stared into my
eyes with a growing terror that seemed to implore help, though her lips
were quiet, and only the memory of that cry echoed in my ears.""Describe the face," I interposed."It was a round, fair, lady's face.Very lovely in contour, but devoid
of coloring; not beautiful, but winning from its childlike look of
trust.The hair, banded upon the low, broad forehead, was brown; the
eyes, which were very far apart, gray; the mouth, which was its most
charming feature, delicate of make and very expressive.There was
a dimple in the chin, but none in the cheeks.It was a face to be
remembered.""Meeting the gaze of those imploring eyes, I started up.Instantly the
face and all vanished, and I became conscious, as we sometimes do in
dreams, of a certain movement in the hall below, and the next instant
the gliding figure of a man of imposing size entered the library.I remember experiencing a certain thrill at this, half terror, half
curiosity, though I seemed to know, as if by intuition, what he was
going to do.Strange to say, I now seemed to change my personality,
and to be no longer a third party watching these proceedings, but Mr.Leavenworth himself, sitting at his library table and feeling his doom
crawling upon him without capacity for speech or power of movement to
avert it.Though my back was towards the man, I could feel his stealthy
form traverse the passage, enter the room beyond, pass to that stand
where the pistol was, try the drawer, find it locked, turn the key,
procure the pistol, weigh it in an accustomed hand, and advance again.I could feel each footstep he took as though his feet were in truth upon
my heart, and I remember staring at the table before me as if I expected
every moment to see it run with my own blood.I can see now how the
letters I had been writing danced upon the paper before me, appearing
to my eyes to take the phantom shapes of persons and things long ago
forgotten; crowding my last moments with regrets and dead shames, wild
longings, and unspeakable agonies, through all of which that face, the
face of my former dream, mingled, pale, sweet, and searching, while
closer and closer behind me crept that noiseless foot till I could
feel the glaring of the assassin's eyes across the narrow threshold
separating me from death and hear the click of his teeth as he set his
lips for the final act.and the secretary's livid face showed the
touch of awful horror, "what words can describe such an experience as
that?In one moment, all the agonies of hell in the heart and brain,
the next a blank through which I seemed to see afar, and as if suddenly
removed from all this, a crouching figure looking at its work with
starting eyes and pallid back-drawn lips; and seeing, recognize no face
that I had ever known, but one so handsome, so remarkable, so unique in
its formation and character, that it would be as easy for me to mistake
the countenance of my father as the look and figure of the man revealed
to me in my dream."said I, in a voice I failed to recognize as my own."Was that of him whom we saw leave Mary Leavenworth's presence last
night and go down the hall to the front door."A PREJUDICE


    "True, I talk of dreams,
     Which are the children of an idle brain
     Begot of nothing but vain phantasy."FOR one moment I sat a prey to superstitious horror; then, my natural
incredulity asserting itself, I looked up and remarked:

"You say that all this took place the night previous to the actual
occurrence?""But you did not seem to take it as such?""No; I am subject to horrible dreams.I thought but little of it in a
superstitious way till I looked next day upon Mr."I do not wonder you behaved strangely at the inquest.""Ah, sir," he returned, with a slow, sad smile; "no one knows what
I suffered in my endeavors not to tell more than I actually knew,
irrespective of my dream, of this murder and the manner of its
accomplishment.""You believe, then, that your dream foreshadowed the manner of the
murder as well as the fact?"John travelled to the kitchen."It is a pity it did not go a little further, then, and tell us how
the assassin escaped from, if not how he entered, a house so securely
fastened.""That would have been convenient," he repeated."Also, if I had been informed where Hannah was, and why a stranger and a
gentleman should have stooped to the committal of such a crime."Seeing that he was nettled, I dropped my bantering vein.I asked; "are you so well acquainted with all who visit
that house as to be able to say who are and who are not strangers to the
family?"I am well acquainted with the faces of their friends, and Henry
Clavering is not amongst the number; but----"

"Were you ever with Mr.Leavenworth," I interrupted, "when he has been
away from home; in the country, for instance, or upon his travels?""Yet I suppose he was in the habit of absenting himself from home?""Can you tell me where he was last July, he and the ladies?""Yes, sir; they went to R----.Ah,"
he cried, seeing a change in my face, "do you think he could have met
them there?"I looked at him for a moment, then, rising in my turn, stood level with
him, and exclaimed:

"You are keeping something back, Mr.Harwell; you have more knowledge of
this man than you have hitherto given me to understand.He seemed astonished at my penetration, but replied: "I know no more
of the man than I have already informed you; but"--and a burning flush
crossed his face, "if you are determined to pursue this matter--" and he
paused, with an inquiring look."I am resolved to find out all I can about Henry Clavering," was my
decided answer."Then," said he, "I can tell you this much.Henry Clavering wrote a
letter to Mr.Leavenworth a few days before the murder, which I have
some reason to believe produced a marked effect upon the household."And, folding his arms, the secretary stood quietly awaiting my next
question.Leavenworth's
business letters, and this, being from one unaccustomed to write to him,
lacked the mark which usually distinguished those of a private nature.""And you saw the name of Clavering?""I did; Henry Ritchie Clavering."Harwell," I reiterated, "this is no time for false delicacy."I did; but hastily, and with an agitated conscience.""You can, however, recall its general drift?""It was some complaint in regard to the treatment received by him at the
hand of one of Mr."But you inferred----"

"No, sir; that is just what I did not do.I forced myself to forget the
whole thing.""And yet you say it produced an effect upon the family?"None of them have ever appeared quite the
same as before."Harwell," I gravely continued; "when you were questioned as to the
receipt of any letter by Mr.Leavenworth, which might seem in any manner
to be connected with this tragedy, you denied having seen any such; how
was that?"Raymond, you are a gentleman; have a chivalrous regard for the
ladies; do you think you could have brought yourself (even if in your
secret heart you considered some such result possible, which I am not
ready to say I did) to mention, at such a time as that, the receipt of
a letter complaining of the treatment received from one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, as a suspicious circumstance worthy to be taken
into account by a coroner's jury?""What reason had I for thinking that letter was one of importance?I
knew of no Henry Ritchie Clavering.""And yet you seemed to think it was."It is true; but not as I should hesitate now, if the question were put
to me again."Silence followed these words, during which I took two or three turns up
and down the room."This is all very fanciful," I remarked, laughing in the vain endeavor
to throw off the superstitious horror his words had awakened."I am practical myself
in broad daylight, and recognize the flimsiness of an accusation based
upon a poor, hardworking secretary's dream, as plainly as you do.This
is the reason I desired to keep from speaking at all; but, Mr.Raymond,"
and his long, thin hand fell upon my arm with a nervous intensity which
gave me almost the sensation of an electrical shock, "if the murderer of
Mr.Leavenworth is ever brought to confess his deed, mark my words, he
will prove to be the man of my dream."For a moment his belief was mine; and a mingled
sensation of relief and exquisite pain swept over me as I thought of the
possibility of Eleanore being exonerated from crime only to be plunged
into fresh humiliation and deeper abysses of suffering."He stalks the streets in freedom now," the secretary went on, as if to
himself; "even dares to enter the house he has so wofully desecrated;
but justice is justice and, sooner or later, something will transpire
which will prove to you that a premonition so wonderful as that
I received had its significance; that the voice calling 'Trueman,
Trueman,' was something more than the empty utterances of an excited
brain; that it was Justice itself, calling attention to the guilty."Did he know that the officers of justice were
already upon the track of this same Clavering?I judged not from his
look, but felt an inclination to make an effort and see."You speak with strange conviction," I said; "but in all probability
you are doomed to be disappointed."I do not propose to denounce him;
I do not even propose to speak his name again.I have spoken thus plainly to you only in explanation of last
night's most unfortunate betrayal; and while I trust you will regard
what I have told you as confidential, I also hope you will give me
credit for behaving, on the whole, as well as could be expected under
the circumstances.""Certainly," I replied as I took it.Then, with a sudden impulse to
test the accuracy of this story of his, inquired if he had any means of
verifying his statement of having had this dream at the time spoken of:
that is, before the murder and not afterwards."No, sir; I know myself that I had it the night previous to that of Mr.Leavenworth's death; but I cannot prove the fact.""Did not speak of it next morning to any one?""O no, sir; I was scarcely in a position to do so.""Yet it must have had a great effect upon you, unfitting you for
work----"

"Nothing unfits me for work," was his bitter reply."I believe you," I returned, remembering his diligence for the last few
days."But you must at least have shown some traces of having passed an
uncomfortable night.Have you no recollection of any one speaking to you
in regard to your appearance the next morning?"Leavenworth may have done so; no one else would be likely to
notice."There was sadness in the tone, and my own voice softened as I
said:

"I shall not be at the house to-night, Mr.Harwell; nor do I know when
I shall return there.Personal considerations keep me from Miss
Leavenworth's presence for a time, and I look to you to carry on the
work we have undertaken without my assistance, unless you can bring it
here----"

"I can do that.""I shall expect you, then, to-morrow evening.""Very well, sir"; and he was going, when a sudden thought seemed to
strike him."Sir," he said, "as we do not wish to return to this subject
again, and as I have a natural curiosity in regard to this man, would
you object to telling me what you know of him?You believe him to be a
respectable man; are you acquainted with him, Mr."I know his name, and where he resides.""In London; he is an Englishman."he murmured, with a strange intonation.He bit his lip, looked down, then up, finally fixed his eyes on mine,
and returned, with marked emphasis: "I used an exclamation, sir, because
I was startled.""Yes; you say he is an Englishman.Leavenworth had the most bitter
antagonism to the English.He
would never be introduced to one if he could help it.""You know," continued the secretary, "that Mr.Leavenworth was a man who
carried his prejudices to the extreme.He had a hatred for the English
race amounting to mania.If he had known the letter I have mentioned was
from an Englishman, I doubt if he would have read it.He used to say he
would sooner see a daughter of his dead before him than married to an
Englishman."I turned hastily aside to hide the effect which this announcement made
upon me."You think I am exaggerating," he said."He had doubtless some cause for hating the English with which we are
unacquainted," pursued the secretary."He spent some time in Liverpool
when young, and had, of course, many opportunities for studying their
manners and character."And the secretary made another movement, as if
to leave.But it was my turn to detain him now.Do you
think that, in the case of one of his nieces, say, desiring to marry a
gentleman of that nationality, his prejudice was sufficient to cause him
to absolutely forbid the match?"I had learned what I wished, and saw no further reason for
prolonging the interview.PATCH-WORK


    "Come, give us a taste of your quality."Clavering in his conversation of
the morning had been giving me, with more or less accuracy, a
detailed account of his own experience and position regarding Eleanore
Leavenworth, I asked myself what particular facts it would be necessary
for me to establish in order to prove the truth of this assumption, and
found them to be:

I. That Mr.Clavering had not only been in this country at the time
designated, but that he had been located for some little time at a
watering-place in New York State.That this watering-place should correspond to the one in which Miss
Eleanore Leavenworth was staying at the same time.That they had been seen while there to hold more or less
communication.That they had both been absent from town, at Lorne one time, long
enough to have gone through the ceremony of marriage at a point twenty
miles or so away.V. That a Methodist clergyman, who has since died, lived at that time
within a radius of twenty miles of said watering-place.I next asked myself how I was to establish these acts.Clavering's
life was as yet too little known to me to offer me any assistance; so,
leaving it for the present, I took up the thread of Eleanore's history,
and found that at the time given me she had been in R----, a fashionable
watering-place in this State.Now, if his was true, and my theory
correct, he must have been there also.To prove this fact, became,
consequently, my first business.I resolved to go to R---- on the
morrow.But before proceeding in an undertaking of such importance, I considered
it expedient to make such inquiries and collect such facts as the few
hours I had left to work in rendered possible.I went first to the house
of Mr.I found him lying upon a hard sofa, in the bare sitting-room I have
before mentioned, suffering from a severe attack of rheumatism.His
hands were done up in bandages, and his feet incased in multiplied folds
of a dingy red shawl which looked as if it had been through the wars.Greeting me with a short nod that was both a welcome and an apology,
he devoted a few words to an explanation of his unwonted position; and
then, without further preliminaries, rushed into the subject which was
uppermost in both our minds by inquiring, in a slightly sarcastic way,
if I was very much surprised to find my bird flown when I returned to
the Hoffman House that afternoon."I was astonished to find you allowed him to fly at this time,"
I replied."From the manner in which you requested me to make his
acquaintance, I supposed you considered him an important character in
the tragedy which has just been enacted.""And what makes you think I don't?Oh, the fact that I let him go off
so easily?I never fiddle with the brakes till the
car starts down-hill.But let that pass for the present; Mr.Clavering,
then, did not explain himself before going?""That is a question which I find it exceedingly difficult to answer.Hampered by circumstances, I cannot at present speak with the directness
which is your due, but what I can say, I will.Know, then, that in my
opinion Mr.Clavering did explain himself in an interview with me this
morning.But it was done in so blind a way, it will be necessary for me
to make a few investigations before I shall feel sufficiently sure of
my ground to take you into my confidence.He has given me a possible
clue----"

"Wait," said Mr.Was it done intentionally
and with sinister motive, or unconsciously and in plain good faith?""It is very unfortunate you
cannot explain yourself a little more definitely," he said at last."I
am almost afraid to trust you to make investigations, as you call them,
on your own hook.You are not used to the business, and will lose time,
to say nothing of running upon false scents, and using up your strength
on unprofitable details.""You should have thought of that when you admitted me into partnership.""And you absolutely insist upon working this mine alone?"Clavering, for all I know,
is a gentleman of untarnished reputation.I am not even aware for what
purpose you set me upon his trail.I only know that in thus following
it I have come upon certain facts that seem worthy of further
investigation.""I know it, and for that reason I have come to you for such assistance
as you can give me at this stage of the proceedings.You are in
possession of certain facts relating to this man which it concerns me
to know, or your conduct in reference to him has been purposeless.Now,
frankly, will you make me master of those facts: in short, tell me all
you know of Mr.Clavering, without requiring an immediate return of
confidence on my part?""That is asking a great deal of a professional detective.""I know it, and under other circumstances I should hesitate long before
preferring such a request; but as things are, I don't see how I am to
proceed in the matter without some such concession on your part.At all
events----"

"Wait a moment!Clavering the lover of one of the young
ladies?"Anxious as I was to preserve the secret of my interest in that
gentleman, I could not prevent the blush from rising to my face at the
suddenness of this question."I thought as much," he went on."Being neither a relative nor
acknowledged friend, I took it for granted he must occupy some such
position as that in the family.""I do not see why you should draw such an inference," said I, anxious
to determine how much he knew about him.Clavering is a stranger in
town; has not even been in this country long; has indeed had no time to
establish himself upon any such footing as you suggest."He was
here a year ago to my certain knowledge."Can it be possible I am groping blindly
about for facts which are already in your possession?I pray you listen
to my entreaties, Mr.Gryce, and acquaint me at once with what I want to
know.If I succeed, the glory shall be yours; it I fail, the shame of the
defeat shall be mine.""My reward will be to free an innocent woman from the imputation of
crime which hangs over her."His voice and appearance changed;
for a moment he looked quite confidential."Well, well," said he; "and
what is it you want to know?""I should first like to know how your suspicions came to light on him
at all.What reason had you for thinking a gentleman of his bearing and
position was in any way connected with this affair?""That is a question you ought not to be obliged to put," he returned."Simply because the opportunity of answering it was in your hands before
ever it came into mine.""Don't you remember the letter mailed in your presence by Miss Mary
Leavenworth during your drive from her home to that of her friend in
Thirty-seventh Street?""Certainly, but----"

"You never thought to look at its superscription before it was dropped
into the box.""I had neither opportunity nor right to do so.""And you never regarded the affair as worth your attention?""However I may have regarded it, I did not see how I could prevent Miss
Leavenworth from dropping a letter into a box if she chose to do so.""That is because you are a _gentleman._ Well, it has its disadvantages,"
he muttered broodingly."But you," said I; "how came you to know anything about this letter?Ah, I see," remembering that the carriage in which we were riding at the
time had been procured for us by him."The man on the box was in your
pay, and informed, as you call it."Gryce winked at his muffled toes mysteriously."That is not the
point," he said."Enough that I heard that a letter, which might
reasonably prove to be of some interest to me, had been dropped at such
an hour into the box on the corner of a certain street.That, coinciding
in the opinion of my informant, I telegraphed to the station connected
with that box to take note of the address of a suspicious-looking letter
about to pass through their hands on the way to the General Post Office,
and following up the telegram in person, found that a curious epistle
addressed in lead pencil and sealed with a stamp, had just arrived, the
address of which I was allowed to see----"

"And which was?""Henry R. Clavering, Hoffman House, New York.""And so that is how your attention first came to
be directed to this man?""Why, next I followed up the clue by going to the Hoffman House and
instituting inquiries.Clavering was a regular guest
of the hotel.That he had come there, direct from the Liverpool
steamer, about three months since, and, registering his name as Henry
R. Clavering, Esq., London, had engaged a first-class room which he had
kept ever since.That, although nothing definite was known concerning
him, he had been seen with various highly respectable people, both of
his own nation and ours, by all of whom he was treated with respect.And
lastly, that while not liberal, he had given many evidences of being a
man of means.So much done, I entered the office, and waited for him to
come in, in the hope of having an opportunity to observe his manner when
the clerk handed him that strange-looking letter from Mary Leavenworth.""No; an awkward gawk of a fellow stepped between us just at the critical
moment, and shut off my view.But I heard enough that evening from the
clerk and servants, of the agitation he had shown on receiving it, to
convince me I was upon a trail worth following.I accordingly put on
my men, and for two days Mr.Clavering was subjected to the most
rigid watch a man ever walked under.But nothing was gained by it; his
interest in the murder, if interest at all, was a secret one; and though
he walked the streets, studied the papers, and haunted the vicinity
of the house in Fifth Avenue, he not only refrained from actually
approaching it, but made no attempt to communicate with any of the
family.Meanwhile, you crossed my path, and with your determination
incited me to renewed effort.Clavering's bearing,
and the gossip I had by this time gathered in regard to him, that no one
short of a gentleman and a friend could succeed in getting at the clue
of his connection with this family, I handed him over to you, and----"

"Found me rather an unmanageable colleague."Gryce smiled very much as if a sour plum had been put in his mouth,
but made no reply; and a momentary pause ensued."Did you think to inquire," I asked at last, "if any one knew where Mr.Clavering had spent the evening of the murder?"It was agreed he went out during the
evening; also that he was in his bed in the morning when the servant
came in to make his fire; but further than this no one seemed posted.""So that, in fact, you gleaned nothing that would in any way connect
this man with the murder except his marked and agitated interest in it,
and the fact that a niece of the murdered man had written a letter to
him?""Another question; did you hear in what manner and at what time he
procured a newspaper that evening?""No; I only learned that he was observed, by more than one, to hasten
out of the dining-room with the _Post_ in his hand, and go immediately
to his room without touching his dinner."that does not look---"

"If Mr.Clavering had had a guilty knowledge of the crime, he would
either have ordered dinner before opening the paper, or, having ordered
it, he would have eaten it.""Then you do not believe, from what you have learned, that Mr.Gryce shifted uneasily, glanced at the papers protruding from my
coat pocket and exclaimed: "I am ready to be convinced by you that he
is."That sentence recalled me to the business in hand.Without appearing to
notice his look, I recurred to my questions.Did you learn that, too, at the Hoffman House?""No; I ascertained that in quite another way.In short, I have had a
communication from London in regard to the matter."Yes; I've a friend there in my own line of business, who sometimes
assists me with a bit of information, when requested."You have not had time to write to London, and receive an
answer since the murder."It is enough for me to telegraph him the
name of a person, for him to understand that I want to know everything
he can gather in a reasonable length of time about that person.""It is not there," he said; "if you will be kind enough to feel in my
breast pocket you will find a letter----"

It was in my hand before he finished his sentence."Excuse my
eagerness," I said."This kind of business is new to me, you know."He smiled indulgently at a very old and faded picture hanging on the
wall before him."Eagerness is not a fault; only the betrayal of it.Let us hear what my friend Brown has to
tell us of Mr.Henry Ritchie Clavering, of Portland Place, London."I took the paper to the light and read as follows:


    "Henry Ritchie Clavering, Gentleman, aged 43.Born in

    ----, Hertfordshire, England.Clavering, for
    short time in the army.Mother was Helen Ritchie, of Dumfriesshire,
    Scotland; she is still living.Home with H. R. C., in Portland Place,
    London.H. R. C. is a bachelor, 6 ft.high, squarely built, weight
    about 12 stone.Eyes dark brown;
    nose straight.Called a handsome man; walks erect and rapidly.In
    society is considered a good fellow; rather a favorite, especially with
    ladies.Is liberal, not extravagant; reported to be worth about
    5000 pounds per year, and appearances give color to this statement.Property consists of a small estate in Hertfordshire, and some funds,
    amount not known.Since writing this much, a correspondent sends the
    following in regard to his history.In '46 went from uncle's house to
    Eton.From Eton went to Oxford, graduating in '56.In
    1855 his uncle died, and his father succeeded to the estates.Father
    died in '57 by a fall from his horse or a similar accident.Within a
    very short time H. R. C. took his mother to London, to the residence
    named, where they have lived to the present time."Travelled considerably in 1860; part of the time was with
    ----, of Munich; also in party of Vandervorts from New York; went
    as far east as Cairo.Went to America in 1875 alone, but at end of
    three months returned on account of mother's illness.Nothing is known
    of his movements while in America."From servants learn that he was always a favorite from a boy.More
    recently has become somewhat taciturn.Toward last of his stay watched
    the post carefully, especially foreign ones.Posted scarcely anything
    but newspapers.Have seen, from waste-paper
    basket, torn envelope directed to Amy Belden, no address.American
    correspondents mostly in Boston; two in New York.Names not known, but
    supposed to be bankers.Brought home considerable luggage, and fitted
    up part of house, as for a lady.Left
    for America two months since.Has been, I understand, travelling in the
    south.Has telegraphed twice to Portland Place.His friends hear from
    him but rarely.Letters rec'd recently, posted in New York.One by last
    steamer posted in F----, N. Y.In the country, ---- of ---- has
    charge of the property.F----, N. Y., was a small town near R----."Your friend is a trump," I declared."He tells me just what I wanted
most to know."And, taking out my book, I made memoranda of the facts
which had most forcibly struck me during my perusal of the communication
before me."With the aid of what he tells me, I shall ferret out the
mystery of Henry Clavering in a week; see if I do not."Gryce, "may I expect to be allowed to take
a hand in the game?""As soon as I am reasonably assured I am upon the right tack.""And what will it take to assure you of that?""Not much; a certain point settled, and----"

"Hold on; who knows but what I can do that for you?"And, looking
towards the desk which stood in the corner, Mr.Gryce asked me if I
would be kind enough to open the top drawer and bring him the bits of
partly-burned paper I would find there.Hastily complying, I brought three or four strips of ragged paper, and
laid them on the table at his side."Another result of Fobbs' researches under the coal on the first day of
the inquest," Mr."You thought the key was
all he found.A second turning over of the coal brought
these to light, and very interesting they are, too."I immediately bent over the torn and discolored scraps with great
anxiety.They were four in number, and appeared at first glance to be
the mere remnants of a sheet of common writing-paper, torn lengthwise
into strips, and twisted up into lighters; but, upon closer inspection,
they showed traces of writing upon one side, and, what was more
important still, the presence of one or more drops of spattered blood.This latter discovery was horrible to me, and so overcame me for the
moment that I put the scraps down, and, turning towards Mr.Gryce,
inquired:

"What do you make of them?""That is just the question I was going to put to you."Swallowing my disgust, I took them up again."They look like the
remnants of some old letter," said I."A letter which, from the drop of blood observable on the written side,
must have been lying face up on Mr.Leavenworth's table at the time of
the murder--"

"Just so.""And from the uniformity in width of each of these pieces, as well as
their tendency to curl up when left alone, must first have been torn
into even strips, and then severally rolled up, before being tossed into
the grate where they were afterwards found.""The writing, so far as discernible, is that of a cultivated gentleman.Leavenworth; for I have studied his chirography
too much lately not to know it at a glance; but it may be--Hold!"I
suddenly exclaimed, "have you any mucilage handy?I think, if I could
paste these strips down upon a piece of paper, so that they would
remain flat, I should be able to tell you what I think of them much more
easily.""There is mucilage on the desk," signified Mr.Procuring it, I proceeded to consult the scraps once more for evidence
to guide me in their arrangement.These were more marked than I
expected; the longer and best preserved strip, with its "Mr.Hor" at
the top, showing itself at first blush to be the left-hand margin of
the letter, while the machine-cut edge of the next in length presented
tokens fully as conclusive of its being the right-hand margin of the
same.Selecting these, then, I pasted them down on a piece of paper at
just the distance they would occupy if the sheet from which they were
torn was of the ordinary commercial note size.Immediately it became
apparent: first, that it would take two other strips of the same width
to fill up the space left between them; and secondly, that the writing
did not terminate at the foot of the sheet, but was carried on to
another page.Taking up the third strip, I looked at its edge; it was machine-cut
at the top, and showed by the arrangement of its words that it was
the margin strip of a second leaf.Pasting that down by itself, I
scrutinized the fourth, and finding it also machine-cut at the top but
not on the side, endeavored to fit it to the piece already pasted down,
but the words would not match.Moving it along to the position it
would hold if it were the third strip, I fastened it down; the whole
presenting, when completed, the appearance seen on the opposite page.Then, as I held it up
before his eyes: "But don't show it to me.Study it yourself, and tell
me what you think of it.""Well," said I, "this much is certain: that it is a letter directed to
Mr.Leavenworth from some House, and dated--let's see; that is an _h,_
isn't it?"And I pointed to the one letter just discernible on the line
under the word House."I should think so; but don't ask me.""It must be an _h._ The year is 1875, and this is not the termination
of either January or February.Dated, then, March 1st, 1876, and
signed----"

Mr.Gryce rolled his eyes in anticipatory ecstasy towards the ceiling."By Henry Clavering," I announced without hesitation.Gryce's eyes returned to his swathed finger-ends."Wait a moment, and I'll show you"; and, taking out of my pocket the
card which Mr.Clavering had handed me as an introduction at our late
interview, I laid it underneath the last line of writing on the second
page.Henry Ritchie Clavering on the card;
H----chie--in the same handwriting on the letter."Clavering it is," said he, "without a doubt."But I saw he was not
surprised."And now," I continued, "for its general tenor and meaning."And,
commencing at the beginning, I read aloud the words as they came, with
pauses at the breaks, something as follows: "Mr.Hor--Dear--a niece whom
yo--one too who see--the love and trus--any other man ca--autiful, so
char----s she in face fo----conversation.ery rose has its----rose is no
exception------ely as she is, char----tender as she is,
s----------pable of tramplin------one who trusted----heart------------.-------------------- him to----he owes a----honor----ance."If------t believe ---- her to----cruel----face,---- what is----ble
serv----yours

"H------tchie"

"It reads like a complaint against one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces," I
said, and started at my own words."Why," said I, "the fact is I have heard this very letter spoken of.It _is_ a complaint against one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, and was
written by Mr.Harwell's communication
in regard to the matter.I thought he had
forsworn gossip."Harwell and I have seen each other almost daily for the last two
weeks," I replied."It would be strange if he had nothing to tell me.""And he says he has read a letter written to Mr."Yes; but the particular words of which he has now forgotten.""These few here may assist him in recalling the rest.""I would rather not admit him to a knowledge of the existence of
this piece of evidence.I don't believe in letting any one into our
confidence whom we can conscientiously keep out.""I see you don't," dryly responded Mr.Not appearing to notice the fling conveyed by these words, I took up the
letter once more, and began pointing out such half-formed words in it
as I thought we might venture to complete, as the Hor--, yo--,
see--utiful----, har----, for----, tramplin----, pable----, serv----.This done, I next proposed the introduction of such others as seemed
necessary to the sense, as _Leavenworth_ after _Horatio; Sir_ after
_Dear; have_ with a possible _you_ before _a niece; thorn_ after _its_
in the phrase _rose has its; on after trampling; whom_ after _to;
debt after a; you_ after _If; me ask_ after _believe; beautiful_ after
_cruel._

Between the columns of words thus furnished I interposed a phrase or
two, here and there, the whole reading upon its completion as follows:

"------------ House."Horatio Leavenworth; Dear Sir:_

"(You) have a niece whom you    one too who seems    worthy    the love
and trust     of any other man ca    so    beautiful, so charming    is
she in face form and    conversation.But every rose has its thorn
and (this) rose is no exception    lovely as she is, charming (as she
is,) tender as she is, she    is    capable of trampling on     one who
trusted her heart a

him to whom she owes a debt of honor a    ance

"If you don't believe me ask her to    her    cruel beautiful face   
what is (her) humble servant yours:

"Henry Ritchie Clavering.""I think that will do," said Mr."Its general tenor is evident,
and that is all we want at this time.""The whole tone of it is anything but complimentary to the lady it
mentions," I remarked."He must have had, or imagined he had, some
desperate grievance, to provoke him to the use of such plain language in
regard to one he can still characterize as tender, charming, beautiful.""Grievances are apt to lie back of mysterious crimes.""I think I know what this one was," I said; "but"--seeing him look
up--"must decline to communicate my suspicion to you for the present.My
theory stands unshaken, and in some degree confirmed; and that is all I
can say.""Then this letter does not supply the link you wanted?""No: it is a valuable bit of evidence; but it is not the link I am in
search of just now.""Yet it must be an important clue, or Eleanore Leavenworth would not
have been to such pains, first to take it in the way she did from her
uncle's table, and secondly----"

"Wait!what makes you think this is the paper she took, or was believed
to have taken, from Mr.Leavenworth's table on that fatal morning?""Why, the fact that it was found together with the key, which we know
she dropped into the grate, and that there are drops of blood on it.""Because I am not satisfied with your reason for believing this to be
the paper taken by her from Mr."Well, first, because Fobbs does not speak of seeing any paper in her
hand, when she bent over the fire; leaving us to conclude that these
pieces were in the scuttle of coal she threw upon it; which surely you
must acknowledge to be a strange place for her to have put a paper she
took such pains to gain possession of; and, secondly, for the reason
that these scraps were twisted as if they had been used for curl papers,
or something of that kind; a fact hard to explain by your hypothesis."The detective's eye stole in the direction of my necktie, which was as
near as he ever came to a face."You are a bright one," said he; "a very
bright one.A little surprised, and not altogether pleased with this unexpected
compliment, I regarded him doubtfully for a moment and then asked:

"What is your opinion upon the matter?""Oh, you know I have no opinion.I gave up everything of that kind when
I put the affair into your hands.""Still----"

"That the letter of which these scraps are the remnant was on Mr.Leavenworth's table at the time of the murder is believed.That upon the
body being removed, a paper was taken from the table by Miss Eleanore
Leavenworth, is also believed.That, when she found her action had been
noticed, and attention called to this paper and the key, she resorted to
subterfuge in order to escape the vigilance of the watch that had been
set over her, and, partially succeeding in her endeavor, flung the key
into the fire from which these same scraps were afterwards recovered, is
also known."Very well, then," said I, rising; "we will let conclusions go for the
present.My mind must be satisfied in regard to the truth or falsity of
a certain theory of mine, for my judgment to be worth much on this or
any other matter connected with the affair."And, only waiting to get the address of his subordinate P., in case
I should need assistance in my investigations, I left Mr.Gryce, and
proceeded immediately to the house of Mr.THE STORY OF A CHARMING WOMAN


    "Fe, fi, fo, fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.""I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted.""YOU have never heard, then, the particulars of Mr.I had been asking him to explain to me Mr.Leavenworth's well-known antipathy to the English race."If you had, you would not need to come to me for this explanation.But
it is not strange you are ignorant of the matter.I doubt if there
are half a dozen persons in existence who could tell you where Horatio
Leavenworth found the lovely woman who afterwards became his wife,
much less give you any details of the circumstances which led to his
marriage.""I am very fortunate, then, in being in the confidence of one who can."It will aid you but little to hear.Horatio Leavenworth, when a young
man, was very ambitious; so much so, that at one time he aspired to
marry a wealthy lady of Providence.But, chancing to go to England, he
there met a young woman whose grace and charm had such an effect upon
him that he relinquished all thought of the Providence lady, though it
was some time before he could face the prospect of marrying the one
who had so greatly interested him; as she was not only in humble
circumstances, but was encumbered with a child concerning whose
parentage the neighbors professed ignorance, and she had nothing to
say.But, as is very apt to be the case in an affair like this, love and
admiration soon got the better of worldly wisdom.Taking his future
in his hands, he offered himself as her husband, when she immediately
proved herself worthy of his regard by entering at once into those
explanations he was too much of a gentleman to demand.She proved to be an American by birth,
her father having been a well-known merchant of Chicago.While he lived,
her home was one of luxury, but just as she was emerging into womanhood
he died.It was at his funeral she met the man destined to be her ruin.How he came there she never knew; he was not a friend of her father's.It is enough he was there, and saw her, and that in three weeks--don't
shudder, she was such a child--they were married.In twenty-four hours
she knew what that word meant for her; it meant blows.Everett, I am
telling no fanciful story.In twenty-four hours after that girl was
married, her husband, coming drunk into the house, found her in his way,
and knocked her down.Her father's estate, on
being settled up, proving to be less than expected, he carried her off
to England, where he did not wait to be drunk in order to maltreat her.She was not free from his cruelty night or day.Before she was sixteen,
she had run the whole gamut of human suffering; and that, not at the
hands of a coarse, common ruffian, but from an elegant, handsome,
luxury-loving gentleman, whose taste in dress was so nice he would
sooner fling a garment of hers into the fire than see her go into
company clad in a manner he did not consider becoming.She bore it till
her child was born, then she fled.Two days after the little one saw the
light, she rose from her bed and, taking her baby in her arms, ran out
of the house.The few jewels she had put into her pocket supported her
till she could set up a little shop.As for her husband, she neither saw
him, nor heard from him, from the day she left him till about two weeks
before Horatio Leavenworth first met her, when she learned from the
papers that he was dead.She was, therefore, free; but though she loved
Horatio Leavenworth with all her heart, she would not marry him.She
felt herself forever stained and soiled by the one awful year of abuse
and contamination.Not till the death of her
child, a month or so after his proposal, did she consent to give him her
hand and what remained of her unhappy life.He brought her to New York,
surrounded her with luxury and every tender care, but the arrow had gone
too deep; two years from the day her child breathed its last, she too
died.It was the blow of his life to Horatio Leavenworth; he was never
the same man again.Though Mary and Eleanore shortly after entered his
home, he never recovered his old light-heartedness.Money became his
idol, and the ambition to make and leave a great fortune behind him
modified all his views of life.But one proof remained that he never
forgot the wife of his youth, and that was, he could not bear to have
the word 'Englishman' uttered in his hearing."Veeley paused, and I rose to go.He seemed a little astonished at my request, but immediately replied:
"She was a very pale woman; not strictly beautiful, but of a contour and
expression of great charm.Her hair was brown, her eyes gray--"

"And very wide apart?"On my way downstairs, I bethought me of a letter which I had in my
pocket for Mr.Veeley's son Fred, and, knowing of no surer way of
getting it to him that night than by leaving it on the library table, I
stepped to the door of that room, which in this house was at the rear
of the parlors, and receiving no reply to my knock, opened it and looked
in.The room was unlighted, but a cheerful fire was burning in the grate,
and by its glow I espied a lady crouching on the hearth, whom at first
glance I took for Mrs.But, upon advancing and addressing her by
that name, I saw my mistake; for the person before me not only refrained
from replying, but, rising at the sound of my voice, revealed a form
of such noble proportions that all possibility of its being that of the
dainty little wife of my partner fled."I see I have made a mistake," said I."I beg your pardon"; and would
have left the room, but something in the general attitude of the lady
before me restrained me, and, believing it to be Mary Leavenworth, I
inquired:

"Can it be this is Miss Leavenworth?"The noble figure appeared to droop, the gently lifted head to fall, and
for a moment I doubted if I had been correct in my supposition.Then
form and head slowly erected themselves, a soft voice spoke, and I heard
a low "yes," and hurriedly advancing, confronted--not Mary, with her
glancing, feverish gaze, and scarlet, trembling lips--but Eleanore, the
woman whose faintest look had moved me from the first, the woman whose
husband I believed myself to be even then pursuing to his doom!The surprise was too great; I could neither sustain nor conceal it.Stumbling slowly back, I murmured something about having believed it
to be her cousin; and then, conscious only of the one wish to fly a
presence I dared not encounter in my present mood, turned, when her
rich, heart-full voice rose once more and I heard:

"You will not leave me without a word, Mr.Raymond, now that chance has
thrown us together?"Then, as I came slowly forward: "Were you so very
much astonished to find me here?""I do not know--I did not expect--" was my incoherent reply."I had
heard you were ill; that you went nowhere; that you had no wish to see
your friends.""I have been ill," she said; "but I am better now, and have come to
spend the night with Mrs.Veeley, because I could not endure the stare
of the four walls of my room any longer."This was said without any effort at plaintiveness, but rather as if she
thought it necessary to excuse herself for being where she was."I am glad you did so," said I."You ought to be here all the while.That dreary, lonesome boarding-house is no place for you, Miss
Leavenworth.It distresses us all to feel that you are exiling yourself
at this time.""I do not wish anybody to be distressed," she returned."It is best for
me to be where I am.There is a child there
whose innocent eyes see nothing but innocence in mine.Do not let my friends be anxious; I can bear it."Then, in
a lower tone: "There is but one thing which really unnerves me; and
that is my ignorance of what is going on at home.Sorrow I can bear, but
suspense is killing me.Will you not tell me something of Mary and home?Veeley; she is kind, but has no real knowledge of Mary
or me, nor does she know anything of our estrangement.She thinks me
obstinate, and blames me for leaving my cousin in her trouble.But you
know I could not help it.You know,--" her voice wavered off into a
tremble, and she did not conclude."I cannot tell you much," I hastened to reply; "but whatever knowledge
is at my command is certainly yours.Is there anything in particular you
wish to know?""Yes, how Mary is; whether she is well, and--and composed.""Your cousin's health is good," I returned; "but I fear I cannot say she
is composed.Harwell in preparing your uncle's book for the
press, and necessarily am there much of the time."The words came in a tone of low horror.It has been thought best to bring it before the
world, and----"

"And Mary has set you at the task?"It seemed as if she could not escape from the horror which this caused."She considers herself as fulfilling her uncle's wishes.He was very
anxious, as you know, to have the book out by July."she broke in, "I cannot bear it."Then, as if she
feared she had hurt my feelings by her abruptness, lowered her voice and
said: "I do not, however, know of any one I should be better pleased to
have charged with the task than yourself.With you it will be a work of
respect and reverence; but a stranger--Oh, I could not have endured a
stranger touching it."She was fast falling into her old horror; but rousing herself, murmured:
"I wanted to ask you something; ah, I know"--and she moved so as to
face me."I wish to inquire if everything is as before in the house; the
servants the same and--and other things?"Darrell there; I do not know of any other change."Darrell to help her bear
her loneliness?"I knew what was coming, and strove to preserve my composure."Yes," I replied; "a few."How low her tones were, but how distinct!Gilbert, Miss Martin, and a--a----"

"Go on," she whispered."A gentleman by the name of Clavering.""You speak that name with evident embarrassment," she said, after a
moment of intense anxiety on my part.Astounded, I raised my eyes to her face.It was very pale, and wore
the old look of self-repressed calm I remembered so well.because there are some circumstances surrounding him which have
struck me as peculiar."To-day it is Clavering; a short time ago it
was----"

"Go on."Her dress rustled on the hearth; there was a sound of desolation in it;
but her voice when she spoke was expressionless as that of an automaton."How many times has this person, of whose name you do not appear to be
certain, been to see Mary?""And do you think he will come again?"A short silence followed this, I felt her eyes searching my face, but
doubt whether, if I had known she held a loaded pistol, I could have
looked up at that moment.Raymond," she at length observed, in a changed tone, "the last time
I saw you, you told me you were going to make some endeavor to restore
me to my former position before the world.I did not wish you to do so
then; nor do I wish you to do so now.Can you not make me comparatively
happy, then, by assuring me you have abandoned or will abandon a project
so hopeless?""It is impossible," I replied with emphasis.Much
as I grieve to be a source of sorrow to you, it is best you should know
that I can never give up the hope of righting you while I live."She put out her hand in a sort of hopeless appeal inexpressibly touching
to behold in the fast waning firelight."I should never be able to face the world or my own conscience if,
through any weakness of my own, I should miss the blessed privilege
of setting the wrong right, and saving a noble woman from unmerited
disgrace."And then, seeing she was not likely to reply to this, drew a
step nearer and said: "Is there not some little kindness I can show you,
Miss Leavenworth?Is there no message you would like taken, or act it
would give you pleasure to see performed?""No," said she; "I have only one request to make,
and that you refuse to grant.""For the most unselfish of reasons," I urged."You think so"; then, before I could reply,
"I could desire one little favor shown me, however.""That if anything should transpire; if Hannah should be found, or--or my
presence required in any way,--you will not keep me in ignorance.That
you will let me know the worst when it comes, without fail."Veeley is coming back, and you would scarcely
wish to be found here by her.""No," said I.

And yet I did not go, but stood watching the firelight flicker on her
black dress till the thought of Clavering and the duty I had for the
morrow struck coldly to my heart, and I turned away towards the
door.But at the threshold I paused again, and looked back.Oh, the
flickering, dying fire flame!Oh, the crowding, clustering shadows!Oh, that drooping figure in their midst, with its clasped hands and its
hidden face!I see it all again; I see it as in a dream; then darkness
falls, and in the glare of gas-lighted streets, I am hastening along,
solitary and sad, to my lonely home.A REPORT FOLLOWED BY SMOKE


    "Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
    Where most it promises; and oft it hits
    Where Hope is coldest, and Despair most sits."Gryce I only waited for the determination of one fact,
to feel justified in throwing the case unreservedly into his hands,
I alluded to the proving or disproving of the supposition that Henry
Clavering had been a guest at the same watering-place with Eleanore
Leavenworth the summer before.When, therefore, I found myself the next morning with the Visitor Book
of the Hotel Union at R---- in my hands, it was only by the strongest
effort of will I could restrain my impatience.Almost immediately I encountered his name, written not half
a page below those of Mr.Leavenworth and his nieces, and, whatever
may have been my emotion at finding my suspicions thus confirmed, I
recognized the fact that I was in the possession of a clue which would
yet lead to the solving of the fearful problem which had been imposed
upon me.Hastening to the telegraph office, I sent a message for the man promised
me by Mr.Gryce, and receiving for an answer that he could not be with
me before three o'clock, started for the house of Mr.Monell, a client
of ours, living in R----.I found him at home and, during our interview
of two hours, suffered the ordeal of appearing at ease and interested
in what he had to say, while my heart was heavy with its first
disappointment and my brain on fire with the excitement of the work then
on my hands.I arrived at the depot just as the train came in.There was but one passenger for R----, a brisk young man, whose whole
appearance differed so from the description which had been given me of
Q that I at once made up my mind he could not be the man I was looking
for, and was turning away disappointed, when he approached, and handed
me a card on which was inscribed the single character "?"Even then I
could not bring myself to believe that the slyest and most successful
agent in Mr.Gryce's employ was before me, till, catching his eye, I saw
such a keen, enjoyable twinkle sparkling in its depths that all doubt
fled, and, returning his bow with a show of satisfaction, I remarked:

"You are very punctual."Glad, sir, to please you.Punctuality
is too cheap a virtue not to be practised by a man on the lookout for
a rise.Down train due in ten minutes; no time to
spare.""I thought you might wish to take it, sir.Brown"--winking
expressively at the name, "always checks his carpet-bag for home when he
sees me coming.But that is your affair; I am not particular.""I wish to do what is wisest under the circumstances.""Go home, then, as speedily as possible."And he gave a third sharp nod
exceedingly business-like and determined."If I leave you, it is with the understanding that you bring your
information first to me; that you are in my employ, and in that of no
one else for the time being; and that _mum_ is the word till I give you
liberty to speak.""Very well then, here are your instructions."He looked at the paper I handed him with a certain degree of care, then
stepped into the waiting-room and threw it into the stove, saying in
a low tone: "So much in case I should meet with some accident: have an
apoplectic fit, or anything of that sort.""But----"

"Oh, don't worry; I sha'n't forget.No need of
anybody using pen and paper with me."And laughing in the short, quick way one would expect from a person of
his appearance and conversation, he added: "You will probably hear from
me in a day or so," and bowing, took his brisk, free way down the street
just as the train came rushing in from the West.My instructions to Q were as follows:

1.To find out on what day, and in whose company, the Misses Leavenworth
arrived at R---- the year before.What their movements had been while
there, and in whose society they were oftenest to be seen.Also the date
of their departure, and such facts as could be gathered in regard to
their habits, etc.Henry Clavering, fellow-guest and probable
friend of said ladies.Name of individual fulfilling the following requirements: Clergyman,
Methodist, deceased since last December or thereabouts, who in July of
Seventy-five was located in some town not over twenty miles from R----.Also name and present whereabouts of a man at that time in service of
the above.To say that the interval of time necessary to a proper inquiry into
these matters was passed by me in any reasonable frame of mind, would be
to give myself credit for an equanimity of temper which I unfortunately
do not possess.Never have days seemed so long as the two which
interposed between my return from R---- and the receipt of the following
letter:

"Sir:

"Individuals mentioned arrived in R---- July 3, 1875.Party consisted
of four; the two ladies, their uncle, and the girl named Hannah.Uncle remained three days, and then left for a short tour through
Massachusetts.Gone two weeks, during which ladies were seen more
or less with the gentleman named between us, but not to an extent
sufficient to excite gossip or occasion remark, when said gentleman
left R---- abruptly, two days after uncle's return.As to
habits of ladies, more or less social.They were always to be seen
at picnics, rides, etc., and in the ballroom.E----considered grave, and, towards the last of her stay, moody.It is
remembered now that her manner was always peculiar, and that she was
more or less shunned by her cousin.However, in the opinion of one girl still to be found at the hotel, she
was the sweetest lady that ever breathed.Uncle, ladies, and servants left R---- for New York, August 7,
1875.H. C. arrived at the hotel in R----July 6, 1875, in-company with Mr.Vandervort, friends of the above.Left July 19, two weeks from
day of arrival.Remembered as the
handsome gentleman who was in the party with the L. girls, and that is
all.F----, a small town, some sixteen or seventeen miles from R----, had
for its Methodist minister, in July of last year, a man who has since
died, Samuel Stebbins by name.Name of man in employ of S. S. at that time is Timothy Cook.He
has been absent, but returned to P---- two days ago.I cried aloud at this point, in my sudden surprise and
satisfaction; "now we have something to work upon!"And sitting down I
penned the following reply:

"T. C. wanted by all means.Also any evidence going to prove that H.
C. and E. L. were married at the house of Mr.S. on any day of July or
August last."Next morning came the following telegram:

"T. C. on the road.Will be with you by 2 p.m."At three o'clock of that same day, I stood before Mr."I am here
to make my report," I announced.The flicker of a smile passed over his face, and he gazed for the first
time at his bound-up finger-ends with a softening aspect which must have
done them good.Gryce," I began, "do you remember the conclusion we came to at our
first interview in this house?""I remember the _one you_ came to.""Well, well," I acknowledged a little peevishly, "the one I came to,
then.It was this: that if we could find to whom Eleanore Leavenworth
felt she owed her best duty and love, we should discover the man who
murdered her uncle.""And do you imagine you have done this?""When I undertook this business of clearing Eleanore Leavenworth from
suspicion," I resumed, "it was with the premonition that this person
would prove to be her lover; but I had no idea he would prove to be her
husband."Gryce's gaze flashed like lightning to the ceiling."The lover of Eleanore Leavenworth is likewise her husband," I repeated.Clavering holds no lesser connection to her than that."Gryce, in a harsh tone that
argued disappointment or displeasure."That I will not take time to state.The question is not how I became
acquainted with a certain thing, but is what I assert in regard to it
true.If you will cast your eye over this summary of events gleaned by
me from the lives of these two persons, I think you will agree with me
that it is."And I held up before his eyes the following:

"During the two weeks commencing July 6, of the year 1875, and ending
July 19, of the same year, Henry R. Clavering, of London, and Eleanore
Leavenworth, of New York, were guests of the same hotel._ Fact proved
by Visitor Book of the Hotel Union at R_----, _New York._

"They were not only guests of the same hotel, but are known to have
held more or less communication with each other._Fact proved by such
servants now employed in R---- as were in the hotel at that time._

"July 19.Clavering left R---- abruptly, a circumstance that would
not be considered remarkable if Mr.Leavenworth, whose violent antipathy
to Englishmen as husbands is publicly known, had not just returned from
a journey.Clavering was seen in the parlor of Mr.Stebbins, the
Methodist minister at F----, a town about sixteen miles from R----,
where he was married to a lady of great beauty._Proved by Timothy Cook,
a man in the employ of Mr.Stebbins, who was called in from the garden
to witness the ceremony and sign a paper supposed to be a certificate._

"July 31._Proved by
newspapers of that date._

"September.Eleanore Leavenworth in her uncle's house in New York,
conducting herself as usual, but pale of face and preoccupied in manner._Proved by servants then in her service._ Mr.Clavering in London;
watches the United States mails with eagerness, but receives no letters.Fits up room elegantly, as for a lady._Proved by secret communication
from London._

"November.Miss Leavenworth still in uncle's house.Clavering in London; shows signs of
uneasiness; the room prepared for lady closed._Proved as above._

"January 17, 1876.Clavering, having returned to America, engages
room at Hoffman House, New York.Leavenworth receives a letter signed by Henry
Clavering, in which he complains of having been ill-used by one of that
gentleman's nieces.A manifest shade falls over the family at this time.Clavering under a false name inquires at the door of Mr.Leavenworth's house for Miss Eleanore Leavenworth."That was the night of
the murder.-"

"Yes; the Mr.Le Roy Robbins said to have called that evening was none
other than Mr.Miss Mary Leavenworth, in a conversation with me,
acknowledges that there is a secret in the family, and is just upon the
point of revealing its nature, when Mr.Upon
his departure she declares her unwillingness ever to mention the subject
again.""And from these facts you draw
the inference that Eleanore Leavenworth is the wife of Mr."And that, being his wife----"

"It would be natural for her to conceal anything she knew likely to
criminate him.""Always supposing Clavering himself had done anything criminal!""Which latter supposition you now propose to justify!""Which latter supposition it is left for _us_ to justify.""Then you have no new evidence against Mr."I should think the fact just given, of his standing in the relation of
unacknowledged husband to the suspected party was something.""No positive evidence as to his being the assassin of Mr.I was obliged to admit I had none which he would consider positive."But
I can show the existence of motive; and I can likewise show it was not
only possible, but probable, he was in the house at the time of the
murder."Gryce, rousing a little from his abstraction."The motive was the usual one of self-interest.Leavenworth stood
in the way of Eleanore's acknowledging him as a husband, and he must
therefore be put out of the way."Too much calculation was shown for the arm
to have been nerved by anything short of the most deliberate intention,
founded upon the deadliest necessity of passion or avarice.""One should never deliberate upon the causes which have led to the
destruction of a rich man without taking into account that most common
passion of the human race.""But----"

"Let us hear what you have to say of Mr.Clavering's presence in the
house at the time of the murder."I related what Thomas the butler had told me in regard to Mr.Clavering's call upon Miss Leavenworth that night, and the lack of proof
which existed as to his having left the house when supposed to do so."Valueless as direct evidence, it might prove of great value as
corroborative."Then, in a graver tone, he went on to say: "Mr.Raymond,
are you aware that in all this you have been strengthening the case
against Eleanore Leavenworth instead of weakening it?"I could only ejaculate, in my sudden wonder and dismay."You have shown her to be secret, sly, and unprincipled; capable of
wronging those to whom she was most bound, her uncle and her husband.""You put it very strongly," said I, conscious of a shocking discrepancy
between this description of Eleanore's character and all that I had
preconceived in regard to it."No more so than your own conclusions from this story warrant me in
doing."Then, as I sat silent, murmured low, and as if to himself:
"If the case was dark against her before, it is doubly so with this
supposition established of her being the woman secretly married to Mr."And yet," I protested, unable to give up my hope without a struggle;
"you do not, cannot, believe the noble-looking Eleanore guilty of this
horrible crime?""No," he slowly said; "you might as well know right here what I think
about that.I believe Eleanore Leavenworth to be an innocent woman."Then what," I cried, swaying between joy at this admission and
doubt as to the meaning of his former expressions, "remains to be done?"Gryce quietly responded: "Why, nothing but to prove your supposition
a false one."TIMOTHY COOK


    "Look here upon this picture and on this.""I doubt if it will be so very difficult,"
said he.Then, in a sudden burst, "Where is the man Cook?""That was a wise move; let us see the boys; have them up.""I expected, of course, you would want to question them," said I, coming
back.In another moment the spruce Q and the shock-headed Cook entered the
room.Gryce, directing his attention at the latter in his own
whimsical, non-committal way; "this is the deceased Mr.Stebbins' hired
man, is it?Well, you look as though you could tell the truth.""I usually calculate to do that thing, sir; at all events, I was never
called a liar as I can remember.""Of course not, of course not," returned the affable detective.Then,
without any further introduction: "What was the first name of the lady
you saw married in your master's house last summer?""As well as if she was my own mother.No disrespect to the lady, sir, if
you know her," he made haste to add, glancing hurriedly at me."What I
mean is, she was so handsome, I could never forget the look of her sweet
face if I lived a hundred years.""I don't know, sirs; she was tall and grand-looking, had the brightest
eyes and the whitest hand, and smiled in a way to make even a common man
like me wish he had never seen her.""Very well; now tell us all you can about that marriage.""Well, sirs, it was something like this.Stebbins'
employ about a year, when one morning as I was hoeing in the garden
I saw a gentleman walk rapidly up the road to our gate and come in.I
noticed him particularly, because he was so fine-looking; unlike anybody
in F----, and, indeed, unlike anybody I had ever seen, for that matter;
but I shouldn't have thought much about that if there hadn't come along,
not five minutes after, a buggy with two ladies in it, which stopped at
our gate, too.I saw they wanted to get out, so I went and held their
horse for them, and they got down and went into the house.""I hadn't been to work long, before I heard some one calling my name,
and looking up, saw Mr.Stebbins standing in the doorway beckoning.I
went to him, and he said, 'I want you, Tim; wash your hands and come
into the parlor.'I had never been asked to do that before, and it
struck me all of a heap; but I did what he asked, and was so taken
aback at the looks of the lady I saw standing up on the floor with
the handsome gentleman, that I stumbled over a stool and made a great
racket, and didn't know much where I was or what was going on, till I
heard Mr.Stebbins say'man and wife'; and then it came over me in a hot
kind of way that it was a marriage I was seeing."Timothy Cook stopped to wipe his forehead, as if overcome with the very
recollection, and Mr.Gryce took the opportunity to remark:

"You say there were two ladies; now where was the other one at this
time?""She was there, sir; but I didn't mind much about her, I was so taken up
with the handsome one and the way she had of smiling when any one looked
at her."Can you remember the color of her hair or eyes?""No, sir; I had a feeling as if she wasn't dark, and that is all I
know."Gryce here whispered me to procure two pictures which I would find
in a certain drawer in his desk, and set them up in different parts of
the room unbeknown to the man.Gryce, "that you have no remembrance
of her name.Weren't you called upon to sign the
certificate?""Yes, sir; but I am most ashamed to say it; I was in a sort of maze,
and didn't hear much, and only remember it was a Mr.Clavering she was
married to, and that some one called some one else Elner, or something
like that.I wish I hadn't been so stupid, sir, if it would have done
you any good.""Tell us about the signing of the certificate," said Mr."Well, sir, there isn't much to tell.Stebbins asked me to put my
name down in a certain place on a piece of paper he pushed towards me,
and I put it down there; that is all.""Was there no other name there when you wrote yours?"Stebbins turned towards the other lady, who now
came forward, and asked her if she wouldn't please sign it, too; and she
said,' yes,' and came very quickly and did so.""And didn't you see her face then?""No, sir; her back was to me when she threw by her veil, and I only saw
Mr.Stebbins staring at her as she stooped, with a kind of wonder on his
face, which made me think she might have been something worth looking at
too; but I didn't see her myself."I went stumbling out of the room, and didn't see
anything more.""Where were you when the ladies went away?""No, sir; that was the queer part of it all.They went back as they
came, and so did he; and in a few minutes Mr.Stebbins came out where I
was, and told me I was to say nothing about what I had seen, for it was
a secret.""Were you the only one in the house who knew anything about it?"No, sir; Miss Stebbins had gone to the sewing circle."I had by this time some faint impression of what Mr.Gryce's suspicions
were, and in arranging the pictures had placed one, that of Eleanore, on
the mantel-piece, and the other, which was an uncommonly fine photograph
of Mary, in plain view on the desk.Cook's back was as yet
towards that part of the room, and, taking advantage of the moment,
I returned and asked him if that was all he had to tell us about this
matter.Gryce, with a glance at Q, "isn't there something you
can give Mr.Q nodded, and moved towards a cupboard in the wall at the side of the
mantel-piece; Mr.Cook following him with his eyes, as was natural,
when, with a sudden start, he crossed the room and, pausing before the
mantelpiece, looked at the picture of Eleanore which I had put there,
gave a low grunt of satisfaction or pleasure, looked at it again, and
walked away.I felt my heart leap into my throat, and, moved by what
impulse of dread or hope I cannot say, turned my back, when suddenly I
heard him give vent to a startled exclamation, followed by the words:
"Why!here she is; this is her, sirs," and turning around saw him
hurrying towards us with Mary's picture in his hands.I do not know as I was greatly surprised.I was powerfully excited, as
well as conscious of a certain whirl of thought, and an unsettling of
old conclusions that was very confusing; but surprised?Gryce's
manner had too well prepared me."This the lady who was married to Mr.I guess
you are mistaken," cried the detective, in a very incredulous tone.Didn't I say I would know her anywhere?This is the lady, if
she is the president's wife herself."Cook leaned over it with a
devouring look that was not without its element of homage.Gryce went on, winking at me in a slow,
diabolical way which in another mood would have aroused my fiercest
anger."Now, if you had said the other lady was the one"--pointing to
the picture on the mantelpiece," I shouldn't have wondered."I never saw that lady before; but this one--would you mind telling
me her name, sirs?""If what you say is true, her name is Mrs."And a very lovely lady," said Mr."Morris, haven't you found
anything yet?"Q, for answer, brought forward glasses and a bottle.I think he was struck with
remorse; for, looking from the picture to Q, and from Q to the picture,
he said:

"If I have done this lady wrong by my talk, I'll never forgive myself.You told me I would help her to get her rights; if you have deceived me
----"

"Oh, I haven't deceived you," broke in Q, in his short, sharp way."Ask
that gentleman there if we are not all interested in Mrs.He had designated me; but I was in no mood to reply.I longed to
have the man dismissed, that I might inquire the reason of the great
complacency which I now saw overspreading Mr.Gryce's frame, to his very
finger-ends.Cook needn't be concerned," remarked Mr."If he will take
a glass of warm drink to fortify him for his walk, I think he may go to
the lodgings Mr.Give the gent
a glass, and let him mix for himself."But it was full ten minutes before we were delivered of the man and his
vain regrets.Mary's image had called up every latent feeling in his
heart, and I could but wonder over a loveliness capable of swaying the
low as well as the high.But at last he yielded to the seductions of the
now wily Q, and departed.Gryce, I must have allowed some of the confused
emotions which filled my breast to become apparent on my countenance;
for after a few minutes of ominous silence, he exclaimed very grimly,
and yet with a latent touch of that complacency I had before noticed:

"This discovery rather upsets you, doesn't it?Well, it don't me,"
shutting his mouth like a trap."Your conclusions must differ very materially from mine," I returned;
"or you would see that this discovery alters the complexion of the whole
affair."Gryce's very legs grew thoughtful; his voice sank to its deepest
tone."Then," said he, "to my notion, the complexion of things has altered,
but very much for the better.As long as Eleanore was believed to be
the wife, her action in this matter was accounted for; but the tragedy
itself was not.Why should Eleanore or Eleanore's husband wish the death
of a man whose bounty they believed would end with his life?But with
Mary, the heiress, proved the wife!--I tell you, Mr.Raymond, it all
hangs together now.You must never, in reckoning up an affair of murder
like this, forget who it is that most profits by the deceased man's
death."her concealment of certain proofs and evidences
in her own breast--how will you account for that?I can imagine a woman
devoting herself to the shielding of a husband from the consequences of
crime; but a cousin's husband, never."Gryce put his feet very close together, and softly grunted.I could only stare at him in my sudden doubt and dread."Why, what else is there to think?You don't--you can't--suspect
Eleanore of having deliberately undertaken to help her cousin out of a
difficulty by taking the life of their mutual benefactor?"Gryce; "no, I do not think Eleanore Leavenworth had any
hand in the business.""Then who--" I began, and stopped, lost in the dark vista that was
opening before me.Why, who but the one whose past deceit and present necessity
demanded his death as a relief?Who but the beautiful, money-loving,
man-deceiving goddess----"

I leaped to my feet in my sudden horror and repugnance.You are wrong; but do not speak the name.""Excuse me," said he; "but it will have to be spoken many times, and we
may as well begin here and now--who then but Mary Leavenworth; or, if
you like it better, Mrs.It
has been my thought from the beginning."GRYCE EXPLAINS HIMSELF


    "Sits the wind in that corner?"I DO not propose to enter into a description of the mingled feelings
aroused in me by this announcement.As a drowning man is said to live
over in one terrible instant the events of a lifetime, so each word
uttered in my hearing by Mary, from her first introduction to me in her
own room, on the morning of the inquest, to our final conversation on
the night of Mr.Clavering's call, swept in one wild phantasmagoria
through my brain, leaving me aghast at the signification which her whole
conduct seemed to acquire from the lurid light which now fell upon it."I perceive that I have pulled down an avalanche of doubts about your
ears," exclaimed my companion from the height of his calm superiority."You never thought of this possibility, then, yourself?""Do not ask me what I have thought.I only know I will never believe
your suspicions true.That, however much Mary may have been benefited by
her uncle's death, she never had a hand in it; actual hand, I mean.""And what makes you so sure of this?""And what makes you so sure of the contrary?It is for you to prove, not
for me to prove her innocence."Gryce, in his slow, sarcastic way, "you recollect that
principle of law, do you?If I remember rightly, you have not always
been so punctilious in regarding it, or wishing to have it regarded,
when the question was whether Mr.It does not seem so dreadful to accuse a man of a
crime.I cannot listen to it; it is
horrible.Nothing short of absolute confession on her part will ever
make me believe Mary Leavenworth, or any other woman, committed this
deed.It was too cruel, too deliberate, too----"

"Read the criminal records," broke in Mr."I do not care for the criminal records.All the
criminal records in the world would never make me believe Eleanore
perpetrated this crime, nor will I be less generous towards her cousin.Mary Leavenworth is a faulty woman, but not a guilty one.""You are more lenient in your judgment of her than her cousin was, it
appears.""I do not understand you," I muttered, feeling a new and yet more
fearful light breaking upon me.have you forgotten, in the hurry of these late events, the
sentence of accusation which we overheard uttered between these ladies
on the morning of the inquest?""No, but----"

"You believed it to have been spoken by Mary to Eleanore?"I left that
baby-play for you.I thought one was enough to follow on that tack."The light, the light that was breaking upon me!"And do you mean to say
it was Eleanore who was speaking at that time?That I have been laboring
all these weeks under a terrible mistake, and that you could have
righted me with a word, and did not?""Well, as to that, I had a purpose in letting you follow your own lead
for a while.In the first place, I was not sure myself which spoke;
though I had but little doubt about the matter.The voices are, as you
must have noticed, very much alike, while the attitudes in which we
found them upon entering were such as to be explainable equally by the
supposition that Mary was in the act of launching a denunciation, or in
that of repelling one.So that, while I did not hesitate myself as to
the true explanation of the scene before me, I was pleased to find you
accept a contrary one; as in this way both theories had a chance of
being tested; as was right in a case of so much mystery.You accordingly
took up the affair with one idea for your starting-point, and I with
another.You saw every fact as it developed through the medium of Mary's
belief in Eleanore's guilt, and I through the opposite.With you, doubt, contradiction, constant unsettlement,
and unwarranted resorts to strange sources for reconcilement between
appearances and your own convictions; with me, growing assurance, and
a belief which each and every development so far has but served to
strengthen and make more probable."Again that wild panorama of events, looks, and words swept before me.Mary's reiterated assertions of her cousin's innocence, Eleanore's
attitude of lofty silence in regard to certain matters which might be
considered by her as pointing towards the murderer."Your theory must be the correct one," I finally admitted; "it was
undoubtedly Eleanore who spoke.She believes in Mary's guilt, and I have
been blind, indeed, not to have seen it from the first.""If Eleanore Leavenworth believes in her cousin's criminality, she must
have some good reasons for doing so.""She did not conceal in her bosom that
telltale key,--found who knows where?--and destroy, or seek to destroy,
it and the letter which introduced her cousin to the public as the
unprincipled destroyer of a trusting man's peace, for nothing.""And yet you, a stranger, a young man who have never seen Mary
Leavenworth in any other light than that in which her coquettish nature
sought to display itself, presume to say she is innocent, in the face of
the attitude maintained from the first by her cousin!""But," said I, in my great unwillingness to accept his conclusions,
"Eleanore Leavenworth is but mortal.She may have been mistaken in her
inferences.She has never stated what her suspicion was founded upon;
nor can we know what basis she has for maintaining the attitude you
speak of.Clavering is as likely as Mary to be the assassin, for all we
know, and possibly for all she knows.""You seem to be almost superstitious in your belief in Clavering's
guilt."Harwell's fanciful conviction in
regard to this man had in any way influenced me to the detriment of my
better judgment?"I do not pretend to be set
in my notions.Future investigation may succeed in fixing something upon
him; though I hardly think it likely.His behavior as the secret husband
of a woman possessing motives for the commission of a crime has been too
consistent throughout.""No exception at all; for he hasn't left her.""I mean that, instead of leaving the country, Mr.Clavering has only
made pretence of doing so.That, in place of dragging himself off to
Europe at her command, he has only changed his lodgings, and can now be
found, not only in a house opposite to hers, but in the window of that
house, where he sits day after day watching who goes in and out of her
front door."I remembered his parting injunction to me, in that memorable interview
we had in my office, and saw myself compelled to put a new construction
upon it."But I was assured at the Hoffman House that he had sailed for Europe,
and myself saw the man who professes to have driven him to the steamer.""In another carriage, and to another house.""And you tell me that man is all right?""No; I only say there isn't the shadow of evidence against him as the
person who shot Mr.Rising, I paced the floor, and for a few minutes silence fell between
us.But the clock, striking, recalled me to the necessity of the hour,
and, turning, I asked Mr."There is but one thing I can do," said he."To go upon such lights as I have, and cause the arrest of Miss
Leavenworth."I had by this time schooled myself to endurance, and was able to hear
this without uttering an exclamation.But I could not let it pass
without making one effort to combat his determination."But," said I, "I do not see what evidence you have, positive enough in
its character, to warrant extreme measures.You have yourself intimated
that the existence of motive is not enough, even though taken with
the fact of the suspected party being in the house at the time of the
murder; and what more have you to urge against Miss Leavenworth?"I said 'Miss Leavenworth'; I should have said 'Eleanore
Leavenworth.'"when you and all unite in thinking that she alone of
all these parties to the crime is utterly guiltless of wrong?""And yet who is the only one against whom positive testimony of any kind
can be brought."Raymond," he remarked very gravely; "the public is becoming
clamorous; something must be done to satisfy it, if only for the moment.Eleanore has laid herself open to the suspicion of the police, and
must take the consequences of her action.I am sorry; she is a noble
creature; I admire her; but justice is justice, and though I think her
innocent, I shall be forced to put her under arrest unless----"

"But I cannot be reconciled to it.It is doing an irretrievable injury
to one whose only fault is an undue and mistaken devotion to an unworthy
cousin."Unless something occurs between now and tomorrow morning," Mr.Gryce
went on, as if I had not spoken.I tried to realize it; tried to face the fact that all my efforts had
been for nothing, and failed."Will you not grant me one more day?"Clavering, and force from him the
truth.""To make a mess of the whole affair!""No, sir; the die is
cast.Eleanore Leavenworth knows the one point which fixes this
crime upon her cousin, and she must tell us that point or suffer the
consequences of her refusal."Having exhausted so much time already in our
inquiries, why not take a little more; especially as the trail is
constantly growing warmer?A little more moleing----"

"A little more folderol!""No,
sir; the hour for moleing has passed; something decisive has got to be
done now; though, to be sure, if I could find the one missing link I
want----"

"Missing link?"The immediate motive of the tragedy; a bit of proof that Mr.Leavenworth threatened his niece with his displeasure, or Mr.Clavering
with his revenge, would place me on the vantage-point at once; no
arresting of Eleanore then!I would walk right into your
own gilded parlors, and when you asked me if I had found the murderer
yet, say 'yes,' and show you a bit of paper which would surprise you!This has been moled for, and
moled for, as you are pleased to call our system of investigation, and
totally without result.Nothing but the confession of some one of these
several parties to the crime will give us what we want.I will tell you
what I will do," he suddenly cried."Miss Leavenworth has desired me to
report to her; she is very anxious for the detection of the murderer,
you know, and offers an immense reward.Well, I will gratify this desire
of hers.The suspicions I have, together with my reasons for them, will
make an interesting disclosure.I should not greatly wonder if they
produced an equally interesting confession."I could only jump to my feet in my horror."At all events, I propose to try it.Eleanore is worth that much risk
any way.""It will do no good," said I."If Mary is guilty, she will never confess
it.If not----"

"She will tell us who is.""Not if it is Clavering, her husband.""Yes; even if it is Clavering, her husband.She has not the devotion of
Eleanore."She would hide no keys for the sake of
shielding another: no, if Mary were accused, she would speak.The future
opening before us looked sombre enough.And yet when, in a short time
from that, I found myself alone in a busy street, the thought that
Eleanore was free rose above all others, filling and moving me till my
walk home in the rain that day has become a marked memory of my life.It was only with nightfall that I began to realize the truly critical
position in which Mary stood if Mr.But,
once seized with this thought, nothing could drive it from my mind.Shrink as I would, it was ever before me, haunting me with the direst
forebodings.Nor, though I retired early, could I succeed in getting
either sleep or rest.All night I tossed on my pillow, saying over to
myself with dreary iteration: "Something must happen, something will
happen, to prevent Mr.Then I would
start up and ask what could happen; and my mind would run over various
contingencies, such as,--Mr.Clavering might confess; Hannah might come
back; Mary herself wake up to her position and speak the word I had more
than once seen trembling on her lips.But further thought showed me how
unlikely any of these things were to happen, and it was with a brain
utterly exhausted that I fell asleep in the early dawn, to dream I saw
Mary standing above Mr.I was awakened
from this pleasing vision by a heavy knock at the door.Hastily rising,
I asked who was there.The answer came in the shape of an envelope
thrust under the door.Raising it, I found it to be a note.Gryce, and ran thus:

"Come at once; Hannah Chester is found.""Sit down, and I will tell you."Drawing up a chair in a flurry of hope and fear, I sat down by Mr."She is not in the cupboard," that person dryly assured me, noting
without doubt how my eyes went travelling about the room in my anxiety
and impatience."We are not absolutely sure that she is anywhere.But
word has come to us that a girl's face believed to be Hannah's has been
seen at the upper window of a certain house in--don't start--R----,
where a year ago she was in the habit of visiting while at the hotel
with the Misses Leavenworth.Now, as it has already been determined that
she left New York the night of the murder, by the ------ ----Railroad,
though for what point we have been unable to ascertain, we consider the
matter worth inquiring into.""But--"

"If she is there," resumed Mr.Gryce, "she is secreted; kept very
close.No one except the informant has ever seen her, nor is there any
suspicion among the neighbors of her being in town.""Hannah secreted at a certain house in R----?Gryce honored me with one of his grimmest smiles."The name of
the lady she's with is given in the communication as Belden; Mrs.the name found written on a torn envelope by Mr."Then we are upon the
verge of some discovery; Providence has interfered, and Eleanore will be
saved!"Last night, or rather this morning; Q brought it.""It was a message, then, to Q?""Yes, the result of his moleings while in R----, I suppose.""A respectable tinsmith who lives next door to Mrs."And is this the first you knew of an Amy Belden living in R----?""Don't know; don't know anything about her but her name.""But you have already sent Q to make inquiries?""No; the affair is a little too serious for him to manage alone.He is
not equal to great occasions, and might fail just for the lack of a keen
mind to direct him.""In short----"

"I wish you to go.Since I cannot be there myself, I know of no one else
sufficiently up in the affair to conduct it to a successful issue.You see, it is not enough to find and identify the girl.The present
condition of things demands that the arrest of so important a witness
should be kept secret.Now, for a man to walk into a strange house in a
distant village, find a girl who is secreted there, frighten her,
cajole her, force her, as the case may be, from her hiding-place to a
detective's office in New York, and all without the knowledge of the
next-door neighbor, if possible, requires judgment, brains, genius.She must have her reasons for doing so; and
they must be known.Altogether, the affair is a delicate one."To think what pleasure I am
losing on your account!"he grumbled, gazing reproachfully at his
helpless limbs.a train leaves the depot at 12.15.Once in R----,
it will be for you to decide upon the means of making Mrs.Belden's
acquaintance without arousing her suspicions.Q, who will follow you,
will hold himself in readiness to render you any assistance you may
require.Only this thing is to be understood: as he will doubtless go in
disguise, you are not to recognize him, much less interfere with him
and his plans, till he gives you leave to do so, by some preconcerted
signal.You are to work in your way, and he in his, till circumstances
seem to call for mutual support and countenance.I cannot even say
whether you will see him or not; he may find it necessary to keep out of
the way; but you may be sure of one thing, that he will know where
you are, and that the display of, well, let us say a red silk
handkerchief--have you such a thing?""Will be regarded by him as a sign that you desire his presence or
assistance, whether it be shown about your person or at the window of
your room.""And these are all the instructions you can give me?""Yes, I don't know of anything else.You must depend largely upon your
own discretion, and the exigencies of the moment.I cannot tell you now
what to do.Only, if possible, let
me either hear from you or see you by to-morrow at this time."And he handed me a cipher in case I should wish to telegraph.HANNAH



XXVII.AMY BELDEN


    "A merrier man
    Within the limits of becoming mirth,
    I never spent an hour's talk withal."I HAD a client in R---- by the name of Monell; and it was from him I
had planned to learn the best way of approaching Mrs.When,
therefore, I was so fortunate as to meet him, almost on my arrival,
driving on the long road behind his famous trotter Alfred, I regarded
the encounter as a most auspicious beginning of a very doubtful
enterprise.was his exclamation as, the first
greetings passed, we drove rapidly into town."Your part in it goes pretty smoothly," I returned; and thinking I could
never hope to win his attention to my own affairs till I had satisfied
him in regard to his, I told him all I could concerning the law-suit
then pending; a subject so prolific of question and answer, that we
had driven twice round the town before he remembered he had a letter to
post.As it was an important one, admitting of no delay, we hasted at
once to the post-office, where he went in, leaving me outside to watch
the rather meagre stream of goers and comers who at that time of day
make the post-office of a country town their place of rendezvous.Among
these, for some reason, I especially noted one middle-aged woman; why, I
cannot say; her appearance was anything but remarkable.And yet when
she came out, with two letters in her hand, one in a large and one in a
small envelope, and meeting my eye hastily drew them under her shawl,
I found myself wondering what was in her letters and who she could be,
that the casual glance of a stranger should unconsciously move her to an
action so suspicious.Monell's reappearance at the same moment,
diverted my attention, and in the interest of the conversation that
followed, I soon forgot both the woman and her letters.For determined
that he should have no opportunity to revert to that endless topic, a
law case, I exclaimed with the first crack of the whip,--"There, I knew
there was something I wanted to ask you.It is this: Are you acquainted
with any one is this town by the name of Belden?""There is a widow Belden in town; I don't know of any other.""Who is she, what is she, and what is the
extent of your acquaintance with her?""Well," said he, " I cannot conceive why you should be interested in
such an antiquated piece of commonplace goodness as she is, but seeing
you ask, I have no objection to telling you that she is the very
respectable relict of a deceased cabinetmaker of this town; that she
lives in a little house down the street there, and that if you have any
forlorn old tramp to be lodged over night, or any destitute family of
little ones to be looked after, she is the one to go to.As to knowing
her, I know her as I do a dozen other members of our church there up
over the hill.When I see her I speak to her, and that is all.""No; lives alone, has a little income, I believe; must have, to put the
money on the plate she always does; but spends her time in plain sewing
and such deeds of charity, as one with small means but willing heart can
find the opportunity of doing in a town like this.But why in the name
of wonders do you ask?"Belden--don't mention it by the
way--has got mixed up in a case of mine, and I felt it due to my
curiosity if not to my purse, to find out something about her.The fact is I would give something, Monell, for the
opportunity of studying this woman's character.Now couldn't you manage
to get me introduced into her house in some way that would make it
possible and proper for me to converse with her at my leisure?"Well, I don't know; I suppose it could be done.She used to take
lodgers in the summer when the hotel was full, and might be induced
to give a bed to a friend of mine who is very anxious to be near the
post-office on account of a business telegram he is expecting, and which
when it comes will demand his immediate attention."Monell gave
me a sly wink of his eye, little imagining how near the mark he had
struck.Tell her I have a peculiar dislike to sleeping
in a public house, and that you know of no one better fitted to
accommodate me, for the short time I desire to be in town, than
herself.""And what will be said of my hospitality in allowing you under these
circumstances to remain in any other house than my own?""I don't know; very hard things, no doubt; but I guess your hospitality
can stand it.""Well, if you persist, we will see what can be done."And driving up to
a neat white cottage of homely, but sufficiently attractive appearance,
he stopped."This is her house," said he, jumping to the ground; "let's go in and
see what we can do."Glancing up at the windows, which were all closed save the two on the
veranda overlooking the street, I thought to myself, "If she has anybody
in hiding here, whose presence in the house she desires to keep secret,
it is folly to hope she will take me in, however well recommended I may
come."But, yielding to the example of my friend, I alighted in my turn
and followed him up the short, grass-bordered walk to the front door."As she has no servant, she will come to the door herself, so be ready,"
he remarked as he knocked.I had barely time to observe that the curtains to the window at my left
suddenly dropped, when a hasty step made itself heard within, and a
quick hand drew open the door; and I saw before me the woman whom I
had observed at the post-office, and whose action with the letters had
struck me as peculiar.I recognized her at first glance, though she
was differently dressed, and had evidently passed through some worry or
excitement that had altered the expression of her countenance, and
made her manner what it was not at that time, strained and a trifle
uncertain.But I saw no reason for thinking she remembered me.On the
contrary, the look she directed towards me had nothing but inquiry in
it, and when Mr.Monell pushed me forward with the remark, "A friend
of mine; in fact my lawyer from New York," she dropped a hurried
old-fashioned curtsey whose only expression was a manifest desire to
appear sensible of the honor conferred upon her, through the mist of a
certain trouble that confused everything about her."We have come to ask a favor, Mrs.Belden; but may we not come in?"said
my client in a round, hearty voice well calculated to recall a person's
thoughts into their proper channel."I have heard many times of your
cosy home, and am glad of this opportunity of seeing it."And with a
blind disregard to the look of surprised resistance with which she met
his advance, he stepped gallantly into the little room whose cheery
red carpet and bright picture-hung walls showed invitingly through the
half-open door at our left.Finding her premises thus invaded by a sort of French _coup d'etat,_
Mrs.Belden made the best of the situation, and pressing me to enter
also, devoted herself to hospitality.Monell, he quite
blossomed out in his endeavors to make himself agreeable; so much so,
that I shortly found myself laughing at his sallies, though my heart was
full of anxiety lest, after all, our efforts should fail of the success
they certainly merited.Belden softened more and more,
joining in the conversation with an ease hardly to be expected from one
in her humble circumstances.Indeed, I soon saw she was no common woman.There was a refinement in her speech and manner, which, combined with
her motherly presence and gentle air, was very pleasing.The last woman
in the world to suspect of any underhanded proceeding, if she had not
shown a peculiar hesitation when Mr.Monell broached the subject of my
entertainment there."I don't know, sir; I would be glad, but," and she turned a very
scrutinizing look upon me, "the fact is, I have not taken lodgers of
late, and I have got out of the way of the whole thing, and am afraid I
cannot make him comfortable.In short, you will have to excuse me.""What, entice a fellow into a room
like this"--and he cast a hearty admiring glance round the apartment
which, for all its simplicity, both its warm coloring and general air of
cosiness amply merited, "and then turn a cold shoulder upon him when he
humbly entreats the honor of staying a single night in the enjoyment
of its attractions?Belden; I know you too well for that.Lazarus himself couldn't come to your door and be turned away; much less
a good-hearted, clever-headed young gentleman like my friend here.""You are very good," she began, an almost weak love of praise showing
itself for a moment in her eyes; "but I have no room prepared.I have
been house-cleaning, and everything is topsy-turvy Mrs.Wright, now,
over the way----"

"My young friend is going to stop here," Mr.Mouell broke in, with frank
positiveness."If I cannot have him at my own house,--and for certain
reasons it is not advisable,--I shall at least have the satisfaction of
knowing he is in the charge of the best housekeeper in R----.""Yes," I put in, but without too great a show of interest; "I should be
sorry, once introduced here, to be obliged to go elsewhere."The troubled eye wavered away from us to the door."I was never called inhospitable," she commenced; "but everything in
such disorder."I was in hopes I might remain now," I replied; "I have some letters
to write, and ask nothing better than for leave to sit here and write
them."At the word letters I saw her hand go to her pocket in a movement which
must have been involuntary, for her countenance did not change, and she
made the quick reply:

"Well, you may.If you can put up with such poor accommodations as I can
offer, it shall not be said I refused you what Mr.Monell is pleased to
call a favor."And, complete in her reception as she had been in her resistance, she
gave us a pleasant smile, and, ignoring my thanks, bustled out with Mr.Monell to the buggy, where she received my bag and what was, doubtless,
more to her taste, the compliments he was now more than ever ready to
bestow upon her."I will see that a room is got ready for you in a very short space of
time," she said, upon re-entering."Meanwhile, make yourself at home
here; and if you wish to write, why I think you will find everything for
the purpose in these drawers."And wheeling up a table to the easy chair
in which I sat, she pointed to the small compartments beneath, with
an air of such manifest desire to have me make use of anything and
everything she had, that I found myself wondering over my position with
a sort of startled embarrassment that was not remote from shame."Thank you; I have materials of my own," said I, and hastened to open my
bag and bring out the writing-case, which I always carried with me."Then I will leave you," said she; and with a quick bend and a short,
hurried look out of the window, she hastily quitted the room.I could hear her steps cross the hall, go up two or three stairs, pause,
go up the rest of the flight, pause again, and then pass on.I was left
on the first floor alone.A WEIRD EXPERIENCE


    "Flat burglary as ever was committed."THE first thing I did was to inspect with greater care the room in which
I sat.It was a pleasant apartment, as I have already said; square, sunny, and
well furnished.On the floor was a crimson carpet, on the walls several
pictures, at the windows, cheerful curtains of white, tastefully
ornamented with ferns and autumn leaves; in one corner an old melodeon,
and in the centre of the room a table draped with a bright cloth, on
which were various little knick-knacks which, without being rich or
expensive, were both pretty and, to a certain extent, ornamental.But
it was not these things, which I had seen repeated in many other country
homes, that especially attracted my attention, or drew me forward in the
slow march which I now undertook around the room.It was the something
underlying all these, the evidences which I found, or sought to find,
not only in the general aspect of the room, but in each trivial object
I encountered, of the character, disposition, and history of the woman
with whom I now had to deal.It was for this reason I studied the
daguerreotypes on the mantel-piece, the books on the shelf, and the
music on the rack; for this and the still further purpose of noting if
any indications were to be found of there being in the house any such
person as Hannah.First then, for the little library, which I was pleased to see occupied
one corner of the room.Composed of a few well-chosen books, poetical,
historical, and narrative, it was of itself sufficient to account
for the evidences of latent culture observable in Mrs.Taking out a well-worn copy of _Byron,_ I opened it.There
were many passages marked, and replacing the book with a mental comment
upon her evident impressibility to the softer emotions, I turned towards
the melodeon fronting me from the opposite wall.It was closed, but on
its neatly-covered top lay one or two hymn-books, a basket of russet
apples, and a piece of half-completed knitting work.I took up the latter, but was forced to lay it down again without a
notion for what it was intended.Proceeding, I next stopped before
a window opening upon the small yard that ran about the house, and
separated it from the one adjoining.The scene without failed to attract
me, but the window itself drew my attention, for, written with a diamond
point on one of the panes, I perceived a row of letters which, as
nearly as I could make out, were meant for some word or words, but which
utterly failed in sense or apparent connection.Passing it by as the
work of some school-girl, I glanced down at the work-basket standing on
a table at my side.It was full of various kinds of work, among which I
spied a pair of stockings, which were much too small, as well as in too
great a state of disrepair, to belong to Mrs.Belden; and drawing them
carefully out, I examined them for any name on them.Do not start when I
say I saw the letter H plainly marked upon them.Thrusting them back,
I drew a deep breath of relief, gazing, as I did so, out of the window,
when those letters again attracted my attention.Idly I began to read them backward, when--But try
for yourself, reader, and judge of my surprise!Elate at the discovery
thus made, I sat down to write my letters.I had barely finished them,
when Mrs.Belden came in with the announcement that supper was ready."As for your room," said she, "I have prepared my own room for your use,
thinking you would like to remain on the first floor."And, throwing
open a door at my side, she displayed a small, but comfortable room,
in which I could dimly see a bed, an immense bureau, and a shadowy
looking-glass in a dark, old-fashioned frame."I live in very primitive fashion," she resumed, leading the way into
the dining-room; "but I mean to be comfortable and make others so.""I should say you amply succeeded," I rejoined, with an appreciative
glance at her well-spread board.She smiled, and I felt I had paved the way to her good graces in a way
that would yet redound to my advantage.its dainties, its pleasant freedom, its
mysterious, pervading atmosphere of unreality, and the constant sense
which every bountiful dish she pressed upon me brought of the shame of
eating this woman's food with such feelings of suspicion in my heart!Shall I ever forget the emotion I experienced when I first perceived
she had something on her mind, which she longed, yet hesitated, to give
utterance to!Or how she started when a cat jumped from the sloping roof
of the kitchen on to the grass-plot at the back of the house; or how my
heart throbbed when I heard, or thought I heard, a board creak overhead!We were in a long and narrow room which seemed, curiously enough, to run
crosswise of the house, opening on one side into the parlor, and on the
other into the small bedroom, which had been allotted to my use."You live in this house alone, without fear?"Belden,
contrary to my desire, put another bit of cold chicken on my plate."Have you no marauders in this town: no tramps, of whom a solitary woman
like you might reasonably be afraid?""No one will hurt me," said she; "and no one ever came here for food or
shelter but got it.""I should think, then, that living as you do, upon a railroad, you would
be constantly overrun with worthless beings whose only trade is to take
all they can get without giving a return."It is the only luxury I have: to feed the
poor.""But the idle, restless ones, who neither will work, nor let others
work----"

"Are still the poor."Mentally remarking, here is the woman to shield an unfortunate who has
somehow become entangled in the meshes of a great crime, I drew back
from the table.As I did so, the thought crossed me that, in case
there was any such person in the house as Hannah, she would take the
opportunity of going up-stairs with something for her to eat; and that
she might not feel hampered by my presence, I stepped out on the veranda
with my cigar.While smoking it, I looked about for Q. I felt that the least token
of his presence in town would be very encouraging at this time.But it
seemed I was not to be afforded even that small satisfaction.If Q was
anywhere near, he was lying very low.Belden (who I know came down-stairs with an
empty plate, for going into the kitchen for a drink, I caught her in
the act of setting it down on the table), I made up my mind to wait a
reasonable length of time for what she had to say; and then, if she did
not speak, make an endeavor on my own part to surprise her secret.But her avowal was nearer and of a different nature from what I
expected, and brought its own train of consequences with it."You are a lawyer, I believe," she began, taking down her knitting work,
with a forced display of industry."Yes," I said; "that is my profession."She remained for a moment silent, creating great havoc in her work I am
sure, from the glance of surprise and vexation she afterwards threw it.Then, in a hesitating voice, remarked:

"Perhaps you may be willing, then, to give me some advice.The truth is,
I am in a very curious predicament; one from which I don't know how to
escape, and yet which demands immediate action.I should like to tell
you about it; may I?""You may; I shall be only too happy to give you any advice in my power."She drew in her breath with a sort of vague relief, though her forehead
did not lose its frown."It can all be said in a few words.I have in my possession a package of
papers which were intrusted to me by two ladies, with the understanding
that I should neither return nor destroy them without the full
cognizance and expressed desire of both parties, given in person or
writing.That they were to remain in my hands till then, and that
nothing or nobody should extort them from me.""That is easily understood," said I; for she stopped."But, now comes word from one of the ladies, the one, too, most
interested in the matter, that, for certain reasons, the immediate
destruction of those papers is necessary to her peace and safety.""And do you want to know what your duty is in this case?"I could not help it: a flood of conjectures rushing in tumult
over me."It is to hold on to the papers like grim death till released from your
guardianship by the combined wish of both parties."Once pledged in that way, you have no choice.It
would be a betrayal of trust to yield to the solicitations of one party
what you have undertaken to return to both.The fact that grief or loss
might follow your retention of these papers does not release you from
your bond.You have nothing to do with that; besides, you are by no
means sure that the representations of the so-called interested party
are true.You might be doing a greater wrong, by destroying in this way,
what is manifestly considered of value to them both, than by preserving
the papers intact, according to compact."Circumstances alter cases; and in short, it
seems to me that the wishes of the one most interested ought to be
regarded, especially as there is an estrangement between these ladies
which may hinder the other's consent from ever being obtained.""No," said I; "two wrongs never make a right; nor are we at liberty to
do an act of justice at the expense of an injustice.The papers must be
preserved, Mrs.Her head sank very despondingly; evidently it had been her wish to
please the interested party."Law is very hard," she said; "very hard.""This is not only law, but plain duty," I remarked."Suppose a case
different; suppose the honor and happiness of the other party depended
upon the preservation of the papers; where would your duty be then?""But----"

"A contract is a contract," said I, "and cannot be tampered with.Having
accepted the trust and given your word, you are obliged to fulfil, to
the letter, all its conditions.It would be a breach of trust for you to
return or destroy the papers without the mutual consent necessary."An expression of great gloom settled slowly over her features."I
suppose you are right," said she, and became silent.Watching her, I thought to myself, "If I were Mr.Gryce, or even Q, I
would never leave this seat till I had probed this matter to the bottom,
learned the names of the parties concerned, and where those precious
papers are hidden, which she declares to be of so much importance."But
being neither, I could only keep her talking upon the subject until
she should let fall some word that might serve as a guide to my further
enlightenment; I therefore turned, with the intention of asking her
some question, when my attention was attracted by the figure of a woman
coming out of the back-door of the neighboring house, who, for general
dilapidation and uncouthness of bearing, was a perfect type of the style
of tramp of whom we had been talking at the supper table.Gnawing a
crust which she threw away as she reached the street, she trudged down
the path, her scanty dress, piteous in its rags and soil, flapping in
the keen spring wind, and revealing ragged shoes red with the mud of the
highway."There is a customer that may interest you," said I.

Mrs.Belden seemed to awake from a trance.Rising slowly, she looked
out, and with a rapidly softening gaze surveyed the forlorn creature
before her.she muttered; "but I cannot do much for her to-night.A
good supper is all I can give her."And, going to the front door, she bade her step round the house to the
kitchen, where, in another moment, I heard the rough creature's voice
rise in one long "Bless you!"that could only have been produced by the
setting before her of the good things with which Mrs.Belden's larder
seemed teeming.After a decent length of time,
employed as I should judge in mastication, I heard her voice rise once
more in a plea for shelter."The barn, ma'am, or the wood-house.Any place where I can lie out of
the wind."And she commenced a long tale of want and disease, so piteous
to hear that I was not at all surprised when Mrs.Belden told me,
upon re-entering, that she had consented, notwithstanding her previous
determination, to allow the woman to lie before the kitchen fire for the
night."She has such an honest eye," said she; "and charity is my only luxury."The interruption of this incident effectually broke up our conversation.Belden went up-stairs, and for some time I was left alone to ponder
over what I had heard, and determine upon my future course of action.I
had just reached the conclusion that she would be fully as liable to
be carried away by her feelings to the destruction of the papers in her
charge, as to be governed by the rules of equity I had laid down to her,
when I heard her stealthily descend the stairs and go out by the front
door.Distrustful of her intentions, I took up my hat and hastily
followed her.She was on her way down the main street, and my first
thought was, that she was bound for some neighbor's house or perhaps for
the hotel itself; but the settled swing into which she soon altered her
restless pace satisfied me that she had some distant goal in prospect;
and before long I found myself passing the hotel with its appurtenances,
even the little schoolhouse, that was the last building at this end of
the village, and stepping out into the country beyond.But still her fluttering figure hasted on, the outlines of her form,
with its close shawl and neat bonnet, growing fainter and fainter in the
now settled darkness of an April night; and still I followed, walking on
the turf at the side of the road lest she should hear my footsteps and
look round.Over this I could hear her
pass, and then every sound ceased.She had paused, and was evidently
listening.It would not do for me to pause too, so gathering myself into
as awkward a shape as possible, I sauntered by her down the road, but
arrived at a certain point, stopped, and began retracing my steps with a
sharp lookout for her advancing figure, till I had arrived once more at
the bridge.Convinced now that she had discovered my motive for being in her house
and, by leading me from it, had undertaken to supply Hannah with an
opportunity for escape, I was about to hasten back to the charge I had
so incautiously left, when a strange sound heard at my left arrested me.It came from the banks of the puny stream which ran under the bridge,
and was like the creaking of an old door on worn-out hinges.Leaping the fence, I made my way as best I could down the sloping field
in the direction from which the sound came.It was quite dark, and my
progress was slow; so much so, that I began to fear I had ventured upon
a wild-goose chase, when an unexpected streak of lightning shot across
the sky, and by its glare I saw before me what seemed, in the momentary
glimpse I had of it, an old barn.From the rush of waters near at hand,
I judged it to be somewhere on the edge of the stream, and consequently
hesitated to advance, when I heard the sound of heavy breathing near me,
followed by a stir as of some one feeling his way over a pile of loose
boards; and presently, while I stood there, a faint blue light flashed
up from the interior of the barn, and I saw, through the tumbled-down
door that faced me, the form of Mrs.Belden standing with a lighted
match in her hand, gazing round on the four walls that encompassed her.Hardly daring to breathe, lest I should alarm her, I watched her while
she turned and peered at the roof above her, which was so old as to be
more than half open to the sky, at the flooring beneath, which was in
a state of equal dilapidation, and finally at a small tin box which she
drew from under her shawl and laid on the ground at her feet.The sight
of that box at once satisfied me as to the nature of her errand.She was
going to hide what she dared not destroy; and, relieved upon this point,
I was about to take a step forward when the match went out in her hand.While she was engaged in lighting another, I considered that perhaps it
would be better for me not to arouse her apprehensions by accosting her
at this time, and thus endanger the success of my main scheme; but
to wait till she was gone, before I endeavored to secure the box.Accordingly I edged my way up to the side of the barn and waited till
she should leave it, knowing that if I attempted to peer in at the
door, I ran great risk of being seen, owing to the frequent streaks of
lightning which now flashed about us on every side.Minute after minute
went by, with its weird alternations of heavy darkness and sudden
glare; and still she did not come.At last, just as I was about to start
impatiently from my hiding-place, she reappeared, and began to withdraw
with faltering steps toward the bridge.When I thought her quite out of
hearing, I stole from my retreat and entered the barn.It was of course
as dark as Erebus, but thanks to being a smoker I was as well provided
with matches as she had been, and having struck one, I held it up; but
the light it gave was very feeble, and as I did not know just where to
look, it went out before I had obtained more than a cursory glimpse of
the spot where I was.I thereupon lit another; but though I confined my
attention to one place, namely, the floor at my feet, it too went out
before I could conjecture by means of any sign seen there where she had
hidden the box.I now for the first time realized the difficulty before
me.She had probably made up her mind, before she left home, in just
what portion of this old barn she would conceal her treasure; but I had
nothing to guide me: I could only waste matches.A
dozen had been lit and extinguished before I was so much as sure the box
was not under a pile of debris that lay in one corner, and I had taken
the last in my hand before I became aware that one of the broken boards
of the floor was pushed a little out of its proper position.and that board was to be raised, the space beneath examined, and the
box, if there, lifted safely out.I concluded not to waste my resources,
so kneeling down in the darkness, I groped for the board, tried it, and
found it to be loose.Wrenching at it with all my strength, I tore it
free and cast it aside; then lighting my match looked into the hole thus
made.Something, I could not tell what, stone or box, met my eye, but
while I reached for it, the match flew out of my hand.Deploring my
carelessness, but determined at all hazards to secure what I had seen,
I dived down deep into the hole, and in another moment had the object of
my curiosity in my hands.Satisfied at this result of my efforts, I turned to depart, my one wish
now being to arrive home before Mrs.She had
several minutes the start of me; I would have to pass her on the road,
and in so doing might be recognized.Regaining the highway, I started at a brisk pace.For some little
distance I kept it up, neither overtaking nor meeting any one.But
suddenly, at a turn in the road, I came unexpectedly upon Mrs.Belden,
standing in the middle of the path, looking back.Somewhat disconcerted,
I hastened swiftly by her, expecting her to make some effort to stop me.Indeed, I doubt now if she even saw
or heard me.Astonished at this treatment, and still more surprised
that she made no attempt to follow me, I looked back, when I saw what
enchained her to the spot, and made her so unmindful of my presence.The
barn behind us was on fire!Instantly I realized it was the work of my hands; I had dropped a
half-extinguished match, and it had fallen upon some inflammable
substance.Aghast at the sight, I paused in my turn, and stood staring.Higher and
higher the red flames mounted, brighter and brighter glowed the clouds
above, the stream beneath; and in the fascination of watching it all,
I forgot Mrs.But a short, agitated gasp in my vicinity soon
recalled her presence to my mind, and drawing nearer, I heard her
exclaim like a person speaking in a dream, "Well, I didn't mean to do
it"; then lower, and with a certain satisfaction in her tone, "But it's
all right, any way; the thing is lost now for good, and Mary will be
satisfied without any one being to blame."I did not linger to hear more; if this was the conclusion she had come
to, she would not wait there long, especially as the sound of distant
shouts and running feet announced that a crowd of village boys was on
its way to the scene of the conflagration.The first thing I did, upon my arrival at the house, was to assure
myself that no evil effects had followed my inconsiderate desertion of
it to the mercies of the tramp she had taken in; the next to retire to
my room, and take a peep at the box.I found it to be a neat tin coffer,
fastened with a lock.Satisfied from its weight that it contained
nothing heavier than the papers of which Mrs.Belden had spoken, I hid
it under the bed and returned to the sitting-room.I had barely taken a
seat and lifted a book when Mrs.cried she, taking off her bonnet and revealing a face much
flushed with exercise, but greatly relieved in expression; "this _is_
a night!It lightens, and there is a fire somewhere down street, and
altogether it is perfectly dreadful out.I hope you have not been
lonesome," she continued, with a keen searching of my face which I
bore in the best way I could."I had an errand to attend to, but didn't
expect to stay so long."I returned some nonchalant reply, and she hastened from the room to
fasten up the house.I waited, but she did not come back; fearful, perhaps, of betraying
herself, she had retired to her own apartment, leaving me to take care
of myself as best I might.I own that I was rather relieved at this.The
fact is, I did not feel equal to any more excitement that night, and was
glad to put off further action until the next day.As soon, then, as
the storm was over, I myself went to bed, and, after several ineffectual
efforts, succeeded in getting asleep.THE MISSING WITNESS


    "I fled and cried out death."The voice was low and searching; it reached me in my dreams, waked me,
and caused me to look up.Morning had begun to break, and by its light I
saw, standing in the open door leading into the dining-room, the forlorn
figure of the tramp who had been admitted into the house the night
before.Angry and perplexed, I was about to bid her be gone, when, to my
great surprise, she pulled out a red handkerchief from her pocket, and I
recognized Q."Read that," said he, hastily advancing and putting a slip of paper into
my hand.And, without another word or look, left the room, closing the
door behind him.Rising in considerable agitation, I took it to the window, and by the
rapidly increasing light, succeeded in making out the rudely scrawled
lines as follows:

"She is here; I have seen her; in the room marked with a cross in the
accompanying plan.Wait till eight o'clock, then go up.I will contrive
some means of getting Mrs.Sketched below this was the following plan of the upper floor:

Hannah, then, was in the small back room over the dining-room, and I had
not been deceived in thinking I had heard steps overhead, the evening
before.Greatly relieved, and yet at the same time much moved at the
near prospect of being brought face to face with one who we had every
reason to believe was acquainted with the dreadful secret involved in
the Leavenworth murder, I lay down once more, and endeavored to catch
another hour's rest.But I soon gave up the effort in despair, and
contented myself with listening to the sounds of awakening life which
now began to make themselves heard in the house and neighborhood.As Q had closed the door after him, I could only faintly hear Mrs.Belden when she came down-stairs.But the short, surprised exclamation
which she uttered upon reaching the kitchen and finding the tramp gone
and the back-door wide open, came plainly enough to my ears, and for a
moment I was not sure but that Q had made a mistake in thus leaving so
unceremoniously.As she came, in the course of her preparations for breakfast, into the
room adjoining mine, I could hear her murmur to herself:

"Poor thing!She has lived so long in the fields and at the roadside,
she finds it unnatural to be cooped up in the house all night."The effort to eat and appear unconcerned,
to chat and make no mistake,--May I never be called upon to go through
such another!But at last it was over, and I was left free to await
in my own room the time for the dreaded though much-to-be-desired
interview.Slowly the minutes passed; eight o'clock struck, when, just
as the last vibration ceased, there came a loud knock at the backdoor,
and a little boy burst into the kitchen, crying at the top of his voice:
"Papa's got a fit!papa's got a fit; do come!"Rising, as was natural, I hastened towards the kitchen, meeting Mrs.Belden's anxious face in the doorway."A poor wood-chopper down the street has fallen in a fit," she said."Will you please watch over the house while I see what I can do for him?I won't be absent any longer than I can help."And almost without waiting for my reply, she caught up a shawl, threw
it over her head, and followed the urchin, who was in a state of great
excitement, out into the street.Instantly the silence of death seemed to fill the house, and a dread the
greatest I had ever experienced settled upon me.To leave the kitchen,
go up those stairs, and confront that girl seemed for the moment beyond
my power; but, once on the stair, I found myself relieved from the
especial dread which had overwhelmed me, and possessed, instead, of a
sort of combative curiosity that led me to throw open the door which
I saw at the top with a certain fierceness new to my nature, and not
altogether suitable, perhaps, to the occasion.I found myself in a large bedroom, evidently the one occupied by Mrs.Barely stopping to note certain evidences of
her having passed a restless night, I passed on to the door leading into
the room marked with a cross in the plan drawn for me by Q. It was a
rough affair, made of pine boards rudely painted.Pausing before it, I
listened.Raising the latch, I endeavored to enter.Pausing again, I bent my ear to the keyhole.Not a
sound came from within; the grave itself could not have been stiller.Awe-struck and irresolute, I looked about me and questioned what I had
best do.Suddenly I remembered that, in the plan Q had given me, I had
seen intimation of another door leading into this same room from the one
on the opposite side of the hall.Going hastily around to it, I tried
it with my hand.Convinced at last that
nothing was left me but force, I spoke for the first time, and, calling
the girl by name, commanded her to open the door.Receiving no response,
I said aloud with an accent of severity:

"Hannah Chester, you are discovered; if you do not open the door, we
shall be obliged to break it down; save us the trouble, then, and open
immediately."Going back a step, I threw my whole weight against the door.It creaked
ominously, but still resisted.Stopping only long enough to be sure no movement had taken place within,
I pressed against it once more, this time with all my strength, when it
flew from its hinges, and I fell forward into a room so stifling, chill,
and dark that I paused for a moment to collect my scattered senses
before venturing to look around me.In another
moment, the pallor and fixity of the pretty Irish face staring upon me
from amidst the tumbled clothes of a bed, drawn up against the wall at
my side, struck me with so deathlike a chill that, had it not been for
that one instant of preparation, I should have been seriously dismayed.As it was, I could not prevent a feeling of sickly apprehension from
seizing me as I turned towards the silent figure stretched so near, and
observed with what marble-like repose it lay beneath the patchwork quilt
drawn across it, asking myself if sleep could be indeed so like death
in its appearance.For that it was a sleeping woman I beheld, I did not
seriously doubt.There were too many evidences of careless life in the
room for any other inference.The clothes, left just as she had stepped
from them in a circle on the floor; the liberal plate of food placed
in waiting for her on the chair by the door, --food amongst which I
recognized, even in this casual glance, the same dish which we had had
for breakfast --all and everything in the room spoke of robust life and
reckless belief in the morrow.And yet so white was the brow turned up to the bare beams of the
unfinished wall above her, so glassy the look of the half-opened eyes,
so motionless the arm lying half under, half over, the edge of the
coverlid that it was impossible not to shrink from contact with a
creature so sunk in unconsciousness.But contact seemed to be necessary;
any cry which I could raise at that moment would be ineffectual enough
to pierce those dull ears.Nerving myself, therefore, I stooped and
lifted the hand which lay with its telltale scar mockingly uppermost,
intending to speak, call, do something, anything, to arouse her.But at
the first touch of her hand on mine an unspeakable horror thrilled me.It was not only icy cold, but stiff.Dropping it in my agitation, I
started back and again surveyed the face.What sleep ever wore such pallid hues, such accusing
fixedness?Bending once more I listened at the lips.Not a breath, nor a
stir.Shocked to the core of my being, I made one final effort.Tearing
down the clothes, I laid my hand upon her heart.BURNED PAPER


    "I could have better spared a better man."I DO not think I called immediately for help.The awful shock of this
discovery, coming as it did at the very moment life and hope were
strongest within me; the sudden downfall which it brought of all the
plans based upon this woman's expected testimony; and, worst of all, the
dread coincidence between this sudden death and the exigency in which
the guilty party, whoever it was, was supposed to be at that hour were
much too appalling for instant action.I could only stand and stare at
the quiet face before me, smiling in its peaceful rest as if death
were pleasanter than we think, and marvel over the providence which
had brought us renewed fear instead of relief, complication instead of
enlightenment, disappointment instead of realization.For eloquent as is
death, even on the faces of those unknown and unloved by us, the causes
and consequences of this one were much too important to allow the mind
to dwell upon the pathos of the scene itself.Hannah, the girl, was lost
in Hannah the witness.But gradually, as I gazed, the look of expectation which I perceived
hovering about the wistful mouth and half-open lids attracted me, and I
bent above her with a more personal interest, asking myself if she were
quite dead, and whether or not immediate medical assistance would be of
any avail.But the more closely I looked, the more certain I became
that she had been dead for some hours; and the dismay occasioned by this
thought, taken with the regrets which I must ever feel, that I had not
adopted the bold course the evening before, and, by forcing my way to
the hiding-place of this poor creature, interrupted, if not prevented
the consummation of her fate, startled me into a realization of my
present situation; and, leaving her side, I went into the next room,
threw up the window, and fastened to the blind the red handkerchief
which I had taken the precaution to bring with me.Instantly a young man, whom I was fain to believe Q, though he bore
not the least resemblance, either in dress or facial expression to
any renderings of that youth which I had yet seen, emerged from the
tinsmith's house, and approached the one I was in.Observing him cast a hurried glance in my direction, I crossed the
floor, and stood awaiting him at the head of the stairs.he whispered, upon entering the house and meeting my glance from
below; "have you seen her?""Yes," I returned bitterly, "I have seen her!""No; I have had no talk with her."Then, as I perceived him growing
alarmed at my voice and manner, I drew him into Mrs.Belden's room and
hastily inquired: "What did you mean this morning when you informed me
you had seen this girl?that she was in a certain room where I might
find her?""You have, then, been to her room?""No; I have only been on the outside of it.Seeing a light, I crawled up
on to the ledge of the slanting roof last night while both you and Mrs.Belden were out, and, looking through the window, saw her moving round
the room."He must have observed my countenance change, for he stopped."Come," I said, "and see for
yourself!"And, leading him to the little room I had just left, I
pointed to the silent form lying within."You told me I should
find Hannah here; but you did not tell me I should find her in this
condition."he cried with a start: "not dead?"It seemed as if he could not realize it."She is in a heavy sleep, has taken a narcotic----"

"It is not sleep," I said, "or if it is, she will never wake.And, taking the hand once more in mine, I let it fall in its stone
weight upon the bed.Calming down, he stood gazing at her
with a very strange expression upon his face.Suddenly he moved and
began quietly turning over the clothes that were lying on the floor."I am looking for the bit of paper from which I saw her take what I
supposed to be a dose of medicine last night.he cried,
lifting a morsel of paper that, lying on the floor under the edge of the
bed, had hitherto escaped his notice.He handed me the paper, on the inner surface of which I could dimly
discern the traces of an impalpable white powder."This is important," I declared, carefully folding the paper together."If there is enough of this powder remaining to show that the contents
of this paper were poisonous, the manner and means of the girl's death
are accounted for, and a case of deliberate suicide made evident.""I am not so sure of that," he retorted."If I am any judge of
countenances, and I rather flatter myself I am, this girl had no more
idea she was taking poison than I had.She looked not only bright but
gay; and when she tipped up the paper, a smile of almost silly triumph
crossed her face.Belden gave her that dose to take, telling her
it was medicine----"

"That is something which yet remains to be learned; also whether the
dose, as you call it, was poisonous or not.It may be she died of heart
disease."He simply shrugged his shoulders, and pointed first at the plate of
breakfast left on the chair, and secondly at the broken-down door."Yes," I said, answering his look, "Mrs.Belden has been in here this
morning, and Mrs.Belden locked the door when she went out; but that
proves nothing beyond her belief in the girl's hearty condition.""A belief which that white face on its tumbled pillow did not seem to
shake?""Perhaps in her haste she may not have looked at the girl, but have set
the dishes down without more than a casual glance in her direction?""I don't want to suspect anything wrong, but it is such a coincidence!"This was touching me on a sore point, and I stepped back."Well,"
said I, "there is no use in our standing here busying ourselves with
conjectures.and I moved hurriedly
towards the door."Have you forgotten this is but
an episode in the one great mystery we are sent here to unravel?If this
girl has come to her death by some foul play, it is our business to find
it out.""I know; but we can at least take full note of the room and everything
in it before throwing the affair into the hands of strangers.Gryce
will expect that much of us, I am sure."I am
only afraid I can never forget it."the lay of the bed-clothes
around it?the lack there is of all signs of struggle or fear?"Yes, yes; don't make me look at it any more."--rapidly pointing out each
object as he spoke.a calico dress, a shawl,--not the
one in which she was believed to have run away, but an old black
one, probably belonging to Mrs.Then this chest,"--opening
it,--"containing a few underclothes marked,--let us see, ah, with the
name of the lady of the house, but smaller than any she ever wore;
made for Hannah, you observe, and marked with her own name to prevent
suspicion.And then these other clothes lying on the floor, all new,
all marked in the same way.Going over to where he stood I stooped down, when a wash-bowl half full
of burned paper met my eye."I saw her bending over something in this corner, and could not think
what it was.Can it be she is a suicide after all?She has evidently
destroyed something here which she didn't wish any one to see.""Not a scrap, not a morsel left to show what it was; how unfortunate!"Belden must solve this riddle," I cried.Belden must solve the whole riddle," he replied; "the secret
of the Leavenworth murder hangs upon it."Then, with a lingering
look towards the mass of burned paper, "Who knows but what that was a
confession?""Whatever it was," said I, "it is now ashes, and we have got to accept
the fact and make the best of it.""Yes," said he with a deep sigh; "that's so; but Mr.Gryce will never
forgive me for it, never.He will say I ought to have known it was a
suspicious circumstance for her to take a dose of medicine at the very
moment detection stood at her back.""But she did not know that; she did not see you.""We don't know what she saw, nor what Mrs.Women are a
mystery; and though I flatter myself that ordinarily I am a match for
the keenest bit of female flesh that ever walked, I must say that in
this case I feel myself thoroughly and shamefully worsted.""Well, well," I said, "the end has not come yet; who knows what a talk
with Mrs.And, by the way, she will be coming
back soon, and I must be ready to meet her.Everything depends upon
finding out, if I can, whether she is aware of this tragedy or not.It
is just possible she knows nothing about it."And, hurrying him from the room, I pulled the door to behind me, and led
the way down-stairs."Now," said I, "there is one thing you must attend to at once.Gryce acquainting him with this unlooked-for
occurrence.""All right, sir," and Q started for the door."I may not have another opportunity to
mention it.Belden received two letters from the postmaster
yesterday; one in a large and one in a small envelope; if you could find
out where they were postmarked----"

Q put his hand in his pocket."I think I will not have to go far to
find out where one of them came from.And
before I knew it, he had returned up-stairs."THEREBY HANGS A TALE.""IT was all a hoax; nobody was ill; I have been imposed upon, meanly
imposed upon!"Belden, flushed and panting, entered the room
where I was, and proceeded to take off her bonnet; but whilst doing so
paused, and suddenly exclaimed: "What is the matter?"Something very serious has occurred," I replied; "you have been gone
but a little while, but in that time a discovery has been made--" I
purposely paused here that the suspense might elicit from her some
betrayal; but, though she turned pale, she manifested less emotion than
I expected, and I went on--"which is likely to produce very important
consequences.""I always said it would be impossible to keep it secret
if I let anybody into the house; she is so restless.But I forget," she
suddenly said, with a frightened look; "you haven't told me what the
discovery was.Perhaps it isn't what I thought; perhaps----"

I did not hesitate to interrupt her.Belden," I said, "I shall not
try to mitigate the blow.A woman who, in the face of the most urgent
call from law and justice, can receive into her house and harbor there a
witness of such importance as Hannah, cannot stand in need of any great
preparation for hearing that her efforts, have been too successful, that
she has accomplished her design of suppressing valuable testimony, that
law and justice are outraged, and that the innocent woman whom this
girl's evidence might have saved stands for ever compromised in the eyes
of the world, if not in those of the officers of the law."Her eyes, which had never left me during this address, flashed wide with
dismay."I have intended no wrong; I have only
tried to save people.What have you got to do
with all this?What is it to you what I do or don't do?Can it be you are come from Mary Leavenworth to see how I
am fulfilling her commands, and----"

"Mrs.Belden," I said, "it is of small importance now as to who I am, or
for what purpose I am here.But that my words may have the more effect,
I will say, that whereas I have not deceived you, either as to my name
or position, it is true that I am the friend of the Misses Leavenworth,
and that anything which is likely to affect them, is of interest to
me.When, therefore, I say that Eleanore Leavenworth is irretrievably
injured by this girl's death----"

"Death?The burst was too natural, the tone too horror-stricken for me to doubt
for another moment as to this woman's ignorance of the true state of
affairs."Yes," I repeated, "the girl you have been hiding so long and so well is
now beyond your control.I shall never lose from my ears the shriek which she uttered, nor the
wild, "I don't believe it!with which she dashed
from the room and rushed up-stairs.Nor that after-scene when, in the presence of the dead, she stood
wringing her hands and protesting, amid sobs of the sincerest grief and
terror, that she knew nothing of it; that she had left the girl in the
best of spirits the night before; that it was true she had locked her
in, but this she always did when any one was in the house; and that if
she died of any sudden attack, it must have been quietly, for she had
heard no stir all night, though she had listened more than once, being
naturally anxious lest the girl should make some disturbance that would
arouse me.I was in a hurry, and thought she was asleep;
so I set the things down where she could get them and came right away,
locking the door as usual.""It is strange she should have died this night of all others."No, sir; she was even brighter than common; more lively.I never
thought of her being sick then or ever.If I had----"

"You never thought of her being sick?""Why,
then, did you take such pains to give her a dose of medicine last
night?"she protested, evidently under the supposition it was I who
had spoken."Did I, Hannah, did I, poor girl?"stroking the hand that
lay in hers with what appeared to be genuine sorrow and regret.Where she did she get it if you didn't give
it to her?"This time she seemed to be aware that some one besides myself was
talking to her, for, hurriedly rising, she looked at the man with a
wondering stare, before replying."I don't know who you are, sir; but I can tell you this, the girl had no
medicine,--took no dose; she wasn't sick last night that I know of.""Saw her!--the world is crazy, or I am--saw her swallow a powder!How
could you see her do that or anything else?Hasn't she been shut up in
this room for twenty-four hours?""Yes; but with a window like that in the roof, it isn't so very
difficult to see into the room, madam.""Oh," she cried, shrinking, "I have a spy in the house, have I?But I
deserve it; I kept her imprisoned in four close walls, and never came
to look at her once all night.I don't complain; but what was it you say
you saw her take?You think she has poisoned herself, and that I had a
hand in it!""No," I hastened to remark, "he does not think you had a hand in it.He
says he saw the girl herself swallow something which he believes to have
been the occasion of her death, and only asks you now where she obtained
it."I never gave her anything; didn't know she had
anything."Somehow, I believed her, and so felt unwilling to prolong the present
interview, especially as each moment delayed the action which I felt it
incumbent upon us to take.So, motioning Q to depart upon his errand, I
took Mrs.Belden by the hand and endeavored to lead her from the
room.But she resisted, sitting down by the side of the bed with the
expression, "I will not leave her again; do not ask it; here is my
place, and here I will stay," while Q, obdurate for the first time,
stood staring severely upon us both, and would not move, though I urged
him again to make haste, saying that the morning was slipping away, and
that the telegram to Mr."Till that woman leaves the room, I don't; and unless you promise to
take my place in watching her, I don't quit the house."Astonished, I left her side and crossed to him."You carry your suspicions too far," I whispered, "and I think you are
too rude.We have seen nothing, I am sure, to warrant us in any such
action; besides, she can do no harm here; though, as for watching her, I
promise to do that much if it will relieve your mind.""I don't want her watched here; take her below."Are you not assuming a trifle the master?"If I am, it is because I have something in my
possession which excuses my conduct."Agitated now in my turn, I held out my hand."Not while that woman remains in the room."Seeing him implacable, I returned to Mrs."I must entreat you to come with me," said I."This is not a common
death; we shall be obliged to have the coroner here and others.You had
better leave the room and go below.""I don't mind the coroner; he is a neighbor of mine; his coming won't
prevent my watching over the poor girl until he arrives."Belden," I said, "your position as the only one conscious of the
presence of this girl in your house makes it wiser for you not to invite
suspicion by lingering any longer than is necessary in the room where
her dead body lies.""As if my neglect of her now were the best surety of my good intentions
towards her in time past!""It will not be neglect for you to go below with me at my earnest
request.You can do no good here by staying; will, in fact, be doing
harm.So listen to me or I shall be obliged to leave you in charge of
this man and go myself to inform the authorities."This last argument seemed to affect her, for with one look of shuddering
abhorrence at Q she rose, saying, "You have me in your power," and then,
without another word, threw her handkerchief over the girl's face and
left the room.In two minutes more I had the letter of which Q had
spoken in my hands."It is the only one I could find, sir.It was in the pocket of the dress
Mrs.The other must be lying around somewhere,
but I haven't had time to find it.Scarcely noticing at the time with what deep significance he spoke, I
opened the letter.It was the smaller of the two I had seen her draw
under her shawl the day before at the post-office, and read as follows:


    "DEAR, DEAR FRIEND:

    "I am in awful trouble.I cannot
    explain, I can only make one prayer.Destroy what you have,
    to-day, instantly, without question or hesitation.The consent
    of any one else has nothing to do with it.I am
    lost if you refuse.Do then what I ask, and save

    "ONE WHO LOVES YOU."Belden; there was no signature or date,
only the postmark New York; but I knew the handwriting.came in the dry tones which Q seemed to think fit to
adopt on this occasion."And a damning bit of evidence against the one
who wrote it, and the woman who received it!""A terrible piece of evidence, indeed," said I, "if I did not happen to
know that this letter refers to the destruction of something radically
different from what you suspect."Quite; but we will talk of this hereafter.It is time you sent your
telegram, and went for the coroner."And with this we parted; he to perform his role and I
mine.Belden walking the floor below, bewailing her situation,
and uttering wild sentences as to what the neighbors would say of her;
what the minister would think; what Clara, whoever that was, would do,
and how she wished she had died before ever she had meddled with the
affair.Succeeding in calming her after a while, I induced her to sit down and
listen to what I had to say."You will only injure yourself by this
display of feeling," I remarked, "besides unfitting yourself for what
you will presently be called upon to go through."And, laying myself out
to comfort the unhappy woman, I first explained the necessities of the
case, and next inquired if she had no friend upon whom she could call in
this emergency.To my great surprise she replied no; that while she had kind neighbors
and good friends, there was no one upon whom she could call in a case
like this, either for assistance or sympathy, and that, unless I would
take pity on her, she would have to meet it alone--"As I have met
everything," she said, "from Mr.Belden's death to the loss of most of
my little savings in a town fire last year."I was touched by this,--that she who, in spite of her weakness and
inconsistencies of character, possessed at least the one virtue of
sympathy with her kind, should feel any lack of friends.Unhesitatingly,
I offered to do what I could for her, providing she would treat me with
the perfect frankness which the case demanded.To my great relief, she
expressed not only her willingness, but her strong desire, to tell all
she knew."I have had enough secrecy for my whole life," she said.And indeed I do believe she was so thoroughly frightened, that if a
police-officer had come into the house and asked her to reveal secrets
compromising the good name of her own son, she would have done so
without cavil or question."I feel as if I wanted to take my stand out
on the common, and, in the face of the whole world, declare what I have
done for Mary Leavenworth.But first," she whispered, "tell me, for
God's sake, how those girls are situated.I have not dared to ask or
write.The papers say a good deal about Eleanore, but nothing about
Mary; and yet Mary writes of her own peril only, and of the danger she
would be in if certain facts were known.I don't want
to injure them, only to take care of myself."Belden," I said, "Eleanore Leavenworth has got into her
present difficulty by not telling all that was required of her.Mary
Leavenworth--but I cannot speak of her till I know what you have to
divulge.Her position, as well as that of her cousin, is too anomalous
for either you or me to discuss.What we want to learn from you is, how
you became connected with this affair, and what it was that Hannah knew
which caused her to leave New York and take refuge here."Belden, clasping and unclasping her hands, met my gaze with one
full of the most apprehensive doubt."You will never believe me," she
cried; "but I don't know what Hannah knew.I am in utter ignorance of
what she saw or heard on that fatal night; she never told, and I never
asked.She merely said that Miss Leavenworth wished me to secrete her
for a short time; and I, because I loved Mary Leavenworth and admired
her beyond any one I ever saw, weakly consented, and----"

"Do you mean to say," I interrupted, "that after you knew of the murder,
you, at the mere expression of Miss Leavenworth's wishes, continued to
keep this girl concealed without asking her any questions or demanding
any explanations?""Yes, sir; you will never believe me, but it is so.I thought that,
since Mary had sent her here, she must have her reasons; and--and--I
cannot explain it now; it all looks so differently; but I did do as I
have said."You must have had strong reason for
obeying Mary Leavenworth so blindly.""Oh, sir," she gasped, "I thought I understood it all; that Mary, the
bright young creature, who had stooped from her lofty position to make
use of me and to love me, was in some way linked to the criminal, and
that it would be better for me to remain in ignorance, do as I was
bid, and trust all would come right.I did not reason about it; I only
followed my impulse.I couldn't do otherwise; it isn't my nature.When I
am requested to do anything for a person I love, I cannot refuse.""And you love Mary Leavenworth; a woman whom you yourself seem to
consider capable of a great crime?""Oh, I didn't say that; I don't know as I thought that.She might be in
some way connected with it, without being the actual perpetrator.She
could never be that; she is too dainty."Belden," I said, "what do you know of Mary Leavenworth which makes
even that supposition possible?"The white face of the woman before me flushed."I scarcely know what to
reply," she cried."It is a long story, and----"

"Never mind the long story," I interrupted."Let me hear the one vital
reason.""Well," said she, "it is this; that Mary was in an emergency from which
nothing but her uncle's death could release her."But here we were interrupted by the sound of steps on the porch, and,
looking out, I saw Q entering the house alone.Belden where
she was, I stepped into the hall."Well," said I, "what is the matter?"No, gone away; off in a buggy to look after a man that was found some
ten miles from here, lying in a ditch beside a yoke of oxen."Then, as
he saw my look of relief, for I was glad of this temporary delay, said,
with an expressive wink: "It would take a fellow a long time to go to
him--if he wasn't in a hurry--hours, I think.""Very; no horse I could get could travel it faster than a walk.""Well," said I, "so much the better for us.Belden has a long story
to tell, and----"

"Doesn't wish to be interrupted."Yes, sir; if he has to hobble on two sticks.""At what time do you look for him?""_You_ will look for him as early as three o'clock.I shall be among the
mountains, ruefully eying my broken-down team."And leisurely donning
his hat he strolled away down the street like one who has the whole day
on his hands and does not know what to do with it.Belden's story, she at once
composed herself to the task, with the following result.BELDEN'S NARRATIVE


    "Cursed, destructive Avarice,
     Thou everlasting foe to Love and Honor.""Mischief never thrives
     Without the help of Woman."IT will be a year next July since I first saw Mary Leavenworth.I
was living at that time a most monotonous existence.Loving what was
beautiful, hating what was sordid, drawn by nature towards all that
was romantic and uncommon, but doomed by my straitened position and the
loneliness of my widowhood to spend my days in the weary round of plain
sewing, I had begun to think that the shadow of a humdrum old age
was settling down upon me, when one morning, in the full tide of my
dissatisfaction, Mary Leavenworth stepped across the threshold of my
door and, with one smile, changed the whole tenor of my life.This may seem exaggeration to you, especially when I say that her errand
was simply one of business, she having heard I was handy with my needle;
but if you could have seen her as she appeared that day, marked the look
with which she approached me, and the smile with which she left, you
would pardon the folly of a romantic old woman, who beheld a fairy queen
in this lovely young lady.The fact is, I was dazzled by her beauty and
her charms.And when, a few days after, she came again, and crouching
down on the stool at my feet, said she was so tired of the gossip and
tumult down at the hotel, that it was a relief to run away and hide with
some one who would let her act like the child she was, I experienced
for the moment, I believe, the truest happiness of my life.Meeting her
advances with all the warmth her manner invited, I found her ere long
listening eagerly while I told her, almost without my own volition, the
story of my past life, in the form of an amusing allegory.The next day saw her in the same place; and the next; always with the
eager, laughing eyes, and the fluttering, uneasy hands, that grasped
everything they touched, and broke everything they grasped.But the fourth day she was not there, nor the fifth, nor the sixth, and
I was beginning to feel the old shadow settling back upon me, when one
night, just as the dusk of twilight was merging into evening gloom, she
came stealing in at the front door, and, creeping up to my side, put her
hands over my eyes with such a low, ringing laugh, that I started."You don't know what to make of me!"she cried, throwing aside her
cloak, and revealing herself in the full splendor of evening attire."I
don't know what to make of myself.Though it seems folly, I felt that
I must run away and tell some one that a certain pair of eyes have been
looking into mine, and that for the first time in my life I feel
myself a woman as well as a queen."And with a glance in which coyness
struggled with pride, she gathered up her cloak around her, and
laughingly cried:

"Have you had a visit from a flying sprite?Has one little ray of
moonlight found its way into your prison for a wee moment, with Mary's
laugh and Mary's snowy silk and flashing diamonds?and she patted
my cheek, and smiled so bewilderingly, that even now, with all the
dull horror of these after-events crowding upon me, I cannot but feel
something like tears spring to my eyes at the thought of it."And so the Prince has come for you?"I whispered, alluding to a story I
had told her the last time she had visited me; a story in which a girl,
who had waited all her life in rags and degradation for the lordly
knight who was to raise her from a hovel to a throne, died just as her
one lover, an honest peasant-lad whom she had discarded in her pride,
arrived at her door with the fortune he had spent all his days in
amassing for her sake.But at this she flushed, and drew back towards the door."I don't know;
I am afraid not.I--I don't think anything about that.Princes are not
so easily won," she murmured.But she only shook her fairy head, and replied: "No, no; that would be
spoiling the romance, indeed.I have come upon you like a sprite, and
like a sprite I will go."And, flashing like the moonbeam she was, she
glided out into the night, and floated away down the street.When she next came, I observed a feverish excitement in her manner,
which assured me, even plainer than the coy sweetness displayed in
our last interview, that her heart had been touched by her lover's
attentions.Indeed, she hinted as much before she left, saying in a
melancholy tone, when I had ended my story in the usual happy way, with
kisses and marriage, "I shall never marry!"finishing the exclamation
with a long-drawn sigh, that somehow emboldened me to say, perhaps
because I knew she had no mother:

"And why?What reason can there be for such rosy lips saying their
possessor will never marry?"She gave me one quick look, and then dropped her eyes.I feared I had
offended her, and was feeling very humble, when she suddenly replied, in
an even but low tone, "I said I should never marry, because the one man
who pleases me can never be my husband."All the hidden romance in my nature started at once into life."There is nothing to tell," said she; "only I have been so weak as
to"--she would not say, fall in love, she was a proud woman--"admire a
man whom my uncle will never allow me to marry."And she rose as if to go; but I drew her back."Whom your uncle will not
allow you to marry!""No; uncle loves money, but not to such an extent as that.He is the owner of a beautiful place in his own
country----"

"Own country?""No," she returned; "he is an Englishman."I did not see why she need say that in just the way she did, but,
supposing she was aggravated by some secret memory, went on to inquire:
"Then what difficulty can there be?Isn't he--" I was going to say
steady, but refrained."He is an Englishman," she emphasized in the same bitter tone as
before."In saying that, I say it all.Uncle will never let me marry an
Englishman."Such a puerile reason as this had never
entered my mind."He has an absolute mania on the subject," resumed she."I might as well
ask him to allow me to drown myself as to marry an Englishman."A woman of truer judgment than myself would have said: "Then, if that is
so, why not discard from your breast all thought of him?Why dance with
him, and talk to him, and let your admiration develop into love?"But
I was all romance then, and, angry at a prejudice I could neither
understand nor appreciate, I said:

"But that is mere tyranny!And why,
if he does, should you feel yourself obliged to gratify him in a whim so
unreasonable?""Yes," I returned; "tell me everything.""Well, then, if you want to know the worst of me, as you already know
the best, I hate to incur my uncle's displeasure, because--because--I
have always been brought up to regard myself as his heiress, and I
know that if I were to marry contrary to his wishes, he would instantly
change his mind, and leave me penniless.""But," I cried, my romance a little dampened by this admission, "you
tell me Mr.Clavering has enough to live upon, so you would not want;
and if you love--"

Her violet eyes fairly flashed in her amazement."You don't understand," she said; "Mr.Clavering is not poor; but uncle
is rich.I shall be a queen--" There she paused, trembling, and falling
on my breast."Oh, it sounds mercenary, I know, but it is the fault of
my bringing up.And yet"--her whole face softening with the light of
another emotion, "I cannot say to Henry Clavering, 'Go!my prospects are
dearer to me than you!'said I, determined to get at the truth of the
matter if possible.If you knew me, you
would say it was."And, turning, she took her stand before a picture
that hung on the wall of my sitting-room.It was one of a pair of good photographs I possessed."Yes," I remarked, "that is why I prize it."She did not seem to hear me; she was absorbed in gazing at the exquisite
face before her."That is a winning face," I heard her say.I wonder if she would ever hesitate between love and money.I
do not believe she would," her own countenance growing gloomy and sad
as she said so; "she would think only of the happiness she would confer;
she is not hard like me.I think she had forgotten my presence, for at the mention of her
cousin's name she turned quickly round with a half suspicious look,
saying lightly:

"My dear old Mamma Hubbard looks horrified.She did not know she had
such a very unromantic little wretch for a listener, when she was
telling all those wonderful stories of Love slaying dragons, and living
in caves, and walking over burning ploughshares as if they were tufts of
spring grass?""No," I said, taking her with an irresistible impulse of admiring
affection into my arms; "but if I had, it would have made no difference.I should still have talked about love, and of all it can do to make this
weary workaday world sweet and delightful."Then you do not think me such a wretch?"I thought her the winsomest being in the world, and
frankly told her so.Instantly she brightened into her very gayest self.Not that I thought then, much less do I think now, she partially
cared for my good opinion; but her nature demanded admiration, and
unconsciously blossomed under it, as a flower under the sunshine."And you will still let me come and tell you how bad I am,--that is, if
I go on being bad, as I doubtless shall to the end of the chapter?"Not if I should do a dreadful thing?Not if I should run away with my
lover some fine night, and leave uncle to discover how his affectionate
partiality had been requited?"It was lightly said, and lightly meant, for she did not even wait for my
reply.But its seed sank deep into our two hearts for all that.And for
the next few days I spent my time in planning how I should manage, if
it should ever fall to my lot to conduct to a successful issue so
enthralling a piece of business as an elopement.You may imagine, then,
how delighted I was, when one evening Hannah, this unhappy girl who
is now lying dead under my roof, and who was occupying the position of
lady's maid to Miss Mary Leavenworth at that time, came to my door with
a note from her mistress, running thus:


    "Have the loveliest story of the season ready for me tomorrow; and
    let the prince be as handsome as--as some one you have heard of,
    and the princess as foolish as your little yielding pet,

    "MARY."Which short note could only mean that she was engaged.But the next day
did not bring me my Mary, nor the next, nor the next; and beyond hearing
that Mr.Leavenworth had returned from his trip I received neither word
nor token.Two more days dragged by, when, just as twilight set in, she
came.It had been a week since I had seen her, but it might have been
a year from the change I observed in her countenance and expression.I
could scarcely greet her with any show of pleasure, she was so unlike
her former self."You
expected revelations, whispered hopes, and all manner of sweet
confidences; and you see, instead, a cold, bitter woman, who for
the first time in your presence feels inclined to be reserved and
uncommunicative.""That is because you have had more to trouble than encourage you in your
love," I returned, though not without a certain shrinking, caused more
by her manner than words.She did not reply to this, but rose and paced the floor, coldly at
first, but afterwards with a certain degree of excitement that proved
to be the prelude to a change in her manner; for, suddenly pausing, she
turned to me and said: "Mr."Yes, my uncle commanded me to dismiss him, and I obeyed."The work dropped from my hands, in my heartfelt disappointment."Yes; he had not been in the house five minutes before Eleanore told
him."I was foolish enough
to give her the cue in my first moment of joy and weakness.I did
not think of the consequences; but I might have known."I do not call it conscientiousness to tell another's secrets," I
returned."That is because you are not Eleanore."Not having a reply for this, I said, "And so your uncle did not regard
your engagement with favor?"Did I not tell you he would never allow me to marry an
Englishman?Let the hard, cruel man have his
way?"She was walking off to look again at that picture which had attracted
her attention the time before, but at this word gave me one little
sidelong look that was inexpressibly suggestive."I obeyed him when he commanded, if that is what you mean."Clavering after having given him your word of honor
to be his wife?""Why not, when I found I could not keep my word.""Then you have decided not to marry him?"She did not reply at once, but lifted her face mechanically to the
picture."My uncle would tell you that I had decided to be governed wholly by
his wishes!"she responded at last with what I felt was self-scornful
bitterness.and instantly blushed, startled that I had called her by her
first name."Is it not my manifest
duty to be governed by my uncle's wishes?Has he not brought me up from
childhood?made me all I am, even to the
love of riches which he has instilled into my soul with every gift he
has thrown into my lap, every word he has dropped into my ear, since I
was old enough to know what riches meant?Is it for me now to turn my
back upon fostering care so wise, beneficent, and free, just because
a man whom I have known some two weeks chances to offer me in exchange
what he pleases to call his love?""But," I feebly essayed, convinced perhaps by the tone of sarcasm in
which this was uttered that she was not far from my way of thinking
after all, "if in two weeks you have learned to love this man more than
everything else, even the riches which make your uncle's favor a thing
of such moment--"

"Well," said she, "what then?""Why, then I would say, secure your happiness with the man of your
choice, if you have to marry him in secret, trusting to your influence
over your uncle to win the forgiveness he never can persistently deny."You should have seen the arch expression which stole across her face
at that."Would it not be better," she asked, creeping to my arms, and
laying her head on my shoulder, "would it not be better for me to make
sure of that uncle's favor first, before undertaking the hazardous
experiment of running away with a too ardent lover?"Struck by her manner, I lifted her face and looked at it."Oh, my darling," said I, "you have not, then dismissed Mr."I have sent him away," she whispered demurely."Oh, you dear old Mamma Hubbard; what a matchmaker you are, to be sure!You appear as much interested as if you were the lover yourself.""He will wait for me," said she.The next day I submitted to her the plan I had formed for her
clandestine intercourse with Mr.It was for them both to
assume names, she taking mine, as one less liable to provoke conjecture
than a strange name, and he that of LeRoy Robbins.The plan pleased
her, and with the slight modification of a secret sign being used on the
envelope, to distinguish her letters from mine, was at once adopted.And so it was I took the fatal step that has involved me in all this
trouble.With the gift of my name to this young girl to use as she
would and sign what she would, I seemed to part with what was left me of
judgment and discretion.Henceforth, I was only her scheming, planning,
devoted slave; now copying the letters which she brought me, and
enclosing them to the false name we had agreed upon, and now busying
myself in devising ways to forward to her those which I received from
him, without risk of discovery.Hannah was the medium we employed, as
Mary felt it would not be wise for her to come too often to my house.To this girl's charge, then, I gave such notes as I could not forward in
any other way, secure in the reticence of her nature, as well as in her
inability to read, that these letters addressed to Mrs.Amy Belden would
arrive at their proper destination without mishap.At all events, no difficulty that I ever heard of arose out
of the use of this girl as a go-between.Clavering, who had left an invalid mother
in England, was suddenly summoned home.He prepared to go, but, flushed
with love, distracted by doubts, smitten with the fear that, once
withdrawn from the neighborhood of a woman so universally courted as
Mary, he would stand small chance of retaining his position in her
regard, he wrote to her, telling his fears and asking her to marry him
before he went."Make me your husband, and I will follow your wishes in all things,"
he wrote."The certainty that you are mine will make parting possible;
without it, I cannot go; no, not if my mother should die without the
comfort of saying good-bye to her only child."By some chance she was in my house when I brought this letter from the
post-office, and I shall never forget how she started when she read it.But, from looking as if she had received an insult, she speedily settled
down into a calm consideration of the subject, writing and delivering
into my charge for copying a few lines in which she promised to accede
to his request, if he would agree to leave the public declaration of the
marriage to her discretion, and consent to bid her farewell at the door
of the church or wherever the ceremony of marriage should take place,
never to come into her presence again till such declaration had been
made.Of course this brought in a couple of days the sure response:
"Anything, so you will be mine."And Amy Belden's wits and powers of planning were all summoned into
requisition for the second time, to devise how this matter could be
arranged without subjecting the parties to the chance of detection.In the first place, it was essential
that the marriage should come off within three days, Mr.Clavering
having, upon the receipt of her letter, secured his passage upon a
steamer that sailed on the following Saturday; and, next, both he and
Miss Leavenworth were too conspicuous in their personal appearance to
make it at all possible for them to be secretly married anywhere within
gossiping distance of this place.And yet it was desirable that the
scene of the ceremony should not be too far away, or the time occupied
in effecting the journey to and from the place would necessitate an
absence from the hotel on the part of Miss Leavenworth long enough to
arouse the suspicions of Eleanore; something which Mary felt it wiser
to avoid.Her uncle, I have forgotten to say, was not here--having gone
away again shortly after the apparent dismissal of Mr.F----, then, was the only town I could think of which combined the two
advantages of distance and accessibility.Although upon the railroad, it
was an insignificant place, and had, what was better yet, a very obscure
man for its clergyman, living, which was best of all, not ten rods from
the depot.Making inquiries, I found that it
could be done, and, all alive to the romance of the occasion, proceeded
to plan the details.And now I am coming to what might have caused the overthrow of the
whole scheme: I allude to the detection on the part of Eleanore of the
correspondence between Mary and Mr.Hannah,
who, in her frequent visits to my house, had grown very fond of my
society, had come in to sit with me for a while one evening.She had not
been in the house, however, more than ten minutes, before there came a
knock at the front door; and going to it I saw Mary, as I supposed, from
the long cloak she wore, standing before me.Thinking she had come with
a letter for Mr.Clavering, I grasped her arm and drew her into the
hall, saying, "Have you got it?I must post it to-night, or he will not
receive it in time."There I paused, for, the panting creature I had by the arm turning upon
me, I saw myself confronted by a stranger."You have made a mistake," she cried."I am Eleanore Leavenworth, and I
have come for my girl Hannah.I could only raise my hand in apprehension, and point to the girl
sitting in the corner of the room before her.Miss Leavenworth
immediately turned back."Hannah, I want you," said she, and would have left the house without
another word, but I caught her by the arm."Oh, miss--" I began, but she gave me such a look, I dropped her arm.And, with a glance to see if Hannah were following her,
she went out.For an hour I sat crouched on the stair just where she had left me.Then
I went to bed, but I did not sleep a wink that night.You can imagine,
then, my wonder when, with the first glow of the early morning light,
Mary, looking more beautiful than ever, came running up the steps and
into the room where I was, with the letter for Mr.I cried in my joy and relief, "didn't she understand me, then?"The gay look on Mary's face turned to one of reckless scorn."If you
mean Eleanore, yes.I couldn't keep it secret after the
mistake you made last evening; so I did the next best thing, told her
the truth.""Not that you were about to be married?""And you did not find her as angry as you expected?""I will not say that; she was angry enough.And yet," continued Mary,
with a burst of self-scornful penitence, "I will not call Eleanore's
lofty indignation anger.She was grieved, Mamma Hubbard, grieved."And
with a laugh which I believe was rather the result of her own relief
than of any wish to reflect on her cousin, she threw her head on one
side and eyed me with a look which seemed to say, "Do I plague you so
very much, you dear old Mamma Hubbard?"She did plague me, and I could not conceal it."And will she not tell
her uncle?"The naive expression on Mary's face quickly changed.I felt a heavy hand, hot with fever, lifted from my heart.The plan agreed upon between us for the carrying out of our intentions
was this.At the time appointed, Mary was to excuse herself to her
cousin upon the plea that she had promised to take me to see a friend
in the next town.She was then to enter a buggy previously ordered, and
drive here, where I was to join her.We were then to proceed immediately
to the minister's house in F----, where we had reason to believe we
should find everything prepared for us.But in this plan, simple as it
was, one thing was forgotten, and that was the character of Eleanore's
love for her cousin.That her suspicions would be aroused we did
not doubt; but that she would actually follow Mary up and demand an
explanation of her conduct, was what neither she, who knew her so well,
nor I, who knew her so little, ever imagined possible.Mary, who had followed out the
programme to the point of leaving a little note of excuse on Eleanore's
dressing-table, had come to my house, and was just taking off her long
cloak to show me her dress, when there came a commanding knock at
the front door.Hastily pulling her cloak about her I ran to open it,
intending, you may be sure, to dismiss my visitor with short ceremony,
when I heard a voice behind me say, "Good heavens, it is Eleanore!"and,
glancing back, saw Mary looking through the window-blind upon the porch
without.why, open the door and let her in; I am not afraid of Eleanore."I immediately did so, and Eleanore Leavenworth, very pale, but with
a resolute countenance, walked into the house and into this room,
confronting Mary in very nearly the same spot where you are now sitting."I have come," said she, lifting a face whose expression of mingled
sweetness and power I could not but admire, even in that moment of
apprehension, "to ask you without any excuse for my request, if you will
allow me to accompany you upon your drive this morning?"Mary, who had drawn herself up to meet some word of accusation or
appeal, turned carelessly away to the glass."I am very sorry," she
said, "but the buggy holds only two, and I shall be obliged to refuse.""But I do not wish your company, Eleanore.We are off on a pleasure
trip, and desire to have our fun by ourselves.""And you will not allow me to accompany you?""I cannot prevent your going in another carriage."Eleanore's face grew yet more earnest in its expression."Mary," said
she, "we have been brought up together.I am your sister in affection
if not in blood, and I cannot see you start upon this adventure with no
other companion than this woman.Then tell me, shall I go with you, as a
sister, or on the road behind you as the enforced guardian of your honor
against your will?""Now is it discreet or honorable in you to do this?"Mary's haughty lip took an ominous curve."The same hand that raised you
has raised me," she cried bitterly."This is no time to speak of that," returned Eleanore.All the antagonism of her nature was
aroused.She looked absolutely Juno-like in her wrath and reckless
menace."Eleanore," she cried, "I am going to F---- to marry Mr._Now_ do you wish to accompany me?"Leaping forward, she grasped her cousin's
arm and shook it."To witness the marriage, if it be a true one; to step between you
and shame if any element of falsehood should come in to affect its
legality."Mary's hand fell from her cousin's arm."I do not understand you,"
said she."I thought you never gave countenance to what you considered
wrong.""Nor do I. Any one who knows me will understand that I do not give my
approval to this marriage just because I attend its ceremonial in the
capacity of an unwilling witness.""Because I value your honor above my own peace.Because I love our
common benefactor, and know that he would never pardon me if I let his
darling be married, however contrary her union might be to his wishes,
without lending the support of my presence to make the transaction at
least a respectable one.""But in so doing you will be involved in a world of deception--which you
hate."Clavering does not return with me, Eleanore."Mary's face crimsoned, and she turned slowly away."What every other girl does under such circumstances, I suppose.The
development of more reasonable feelings in an obdurate parent's heart."Eleanore sighed, and a short silence ensued, broken by Eleanore's
suddenly falling upon her knees, and clasping her cousin's hand."Oh,
Mary," she sobbed, her haughtiness all disappearing in a gush of wild
entreaty, "consider what you are doing!Think, before it is too late, of
the consequences which must follow such an act as this.Marriage founded
upon deception can never lead to happiness.Love would have led you either to have dismissed Mr.Clavering at once,
or to have openly accepted the fate which a union with him would bring.Only passion stoops to subterfuge like this.And you," she continued,
rising and turning toward me in a sort of forlorn hope very touching
to see, "can you see this young motherless girl, driven by caprice, and
acknowledging no moral restraint, enter upon the dark and crooked path
she is planning for herself, without uttering one word of warning and
appeal?Tell me, mother of children dead and buried, what excuse you
will have for your own part in this day's work, when she, with her
face marred by the sorrows which must follow this deception, comes to
you----"

"The same excuse, probably," Mary's voice broke in, chill and strained,
"which you will have when uncle inquires how you came to allow such an
act of disobedience to be perpetrated in his absence: that she could not
help herself, that Mary would gang her ain gait, and every one around
must accommodate themselves to it."It was like a draught of icy air suddenly poured into a room heated up
to fever point.Eleanore stiffened immediately, and drawing back, pale
and composed, turned upon her cousin with the remark:

"Then nothing can move you?"The curling of Mary's lips was her only reply.Raymond, I do not wish to weary you with my feelings, but the first
great distrust I ever felt of my wisdom in pushing this matter so far
came with that curl of Mary's lip.More plainly than Eleanore's words it
showed me the temper with which she was entering upon this undertaking;
and, struck with momentary dismay, I advanced to speak when Mary stopped
me."There, now, Mamma Hubbard, don't you go and acknowledge that you
are frightened, for I won't hear it.I have promised to marry Henry
Clavering to-day, and I am going to keep my word--if I don't love him,"
she added with bitter emphasis.Then, smiling upon me in a way which
caused me to forget everything save the fact that she was going to her
bridal, she handed me her veil to fasten.As I was doing this, with very
trembling fingers, she said, looking straight at Eleanore:

"You have shown yourself more interested in my fate than I had any
reason to expect.Will you continue to display this concern all the way
to F----, or may I hope for a few moments of peace in which to dream
upon the step which, according to you, is about to hurl upon me such
dreadful consequences?""If I go with you to F----," Eleanore returned, "it is as a witness, no
more."Very well, then," Mary said, dimpling with sudden gayety; "I suppose
I shall have to accept the situation.Mamma Hubbard, I am so sorry to
disappoint you, but the buggy _won't_ hold three.If you are good you
shall be the first to congratulate me when I come home to-night."And,
almost before I knew it, the two had taken their seats in the buggy that
was waiting at the door."Good-by," cried Mary, waving her hand from the
back; "wish me much joy--of my ride."I tried to do so, but the words wouldn't come.I could only wave my hand
in response, and rush sobbing into the house.Of that day, and its long hours of alternate remorse and anxiety, I
cannot trust myself to speak.Let me come at once to the time when,
seated alone in my lamp-lighted room, I waited and watched for the token
of their return which Mary had promised me.It came in the shape of Mary
herself, who, wrapped in her long cloak, and with her beautiful face
aglow with blushes, came stealing into the house just as I was beginning
to despair.A strain of wild music from the hotel porch, where they were having a
dance, entered with her, producing such a weird effect upon my fancy
that I was not at all surprised when, in flinging off her cloak, she
displayed garments of bridal white and a head crowned with snowy roses.I cried, bursting into tears; "you are then----"

"Mrs."Without a bridal," I murmured, taking her passionately into my embrace.Nestling close to me, she gave
herself up for one wild moment to a genuine burst of tears, saying
between her sobs all manner of tender things; telling me how she loved
me, and how I was the only one in all the world to whom she dared come
on this, her wedding night, for comfort or congratulation, and of how
frightened she felt now it was all over, as if with her name she had
parted with something of inestimable value."And does not the thought of having made some one the proudest of men
solace you?"I asked, more than dismayed at this failure of mine to make
these lovers happy."I don't know," she sobbed."What satisfaction can it be for him to
feel himself tied for life to a girl who, sooner than lose a prospective
fortune, subjected him to such a parting?""Tell me about it," said I.

But she was not in the mood at that moment.The excitement of the day
had been too much for her.A thousand fears seemed to beset her mind.Crouching down on the stool at my feet, she sat with her hands folded
and a glare on her face that lent an aspect of strange unreality to her
brilliant attire.The thought haunts me
every moment; how can I keep it secret!""Why, is there any danger of its being known?""It all went off well, but----"

"Where is the danger, then?""I cannot say; but some deeds are like ghosts.They will not be laid;
they reappear; they gibber; they make themselves known whether we will
or not.I was mad, reckless, what you
will.But ever since the night has come, I have felt it crushing upon me
like a pall that smothers life and youth and love out of my heart.While
the sunlight remained I could endure it; but now--oh, Auntie, I have
done something that will keep me in constant fear.I have allied myself
to a living apprehension."For two hours I have played at being gay.Dressed in my bridal white,
and crowned with roses, I have greeted my friends as if they were
wedding-guests, and made believe to myself that all the compliments
bestowed upon me--and they are only too numerous--were just so many
congratulations upon my marriage.But it was no use; Eleanore knew it
was no use.She has gone to her room to pray, while I--I have come here
for the first time, perhaps for the last, to fall at some one's feet and
cry,--' God have mercy upon me!'""Oh, Mary, have I only
succeeded, then, in making you miserable?"She did not answer; she was engaged in picking up the crown of roses
which had fallen from her hair to the floor."If I had not been taught to love money so!""If,
like Eleanore, I could look upon the splendor which has been ours from
childhood as a mere accessory of life, easy to be dropped at the call of
duty or affection!If prestige, adulation, and elegant belongings were
not so much to me; or love, friendship, and domestic happiness more!If only I could walk a step without dragging the chain of a thousand
luxurious longings after me.Imperious as she often is in
her beautiful womanhood, haughty as she can be when the delicate quick
of her personality is touched too rudely, I have known her to sit by the
hour in a low, chilly, ill-lighted and ill-smelling garret, cradling a
dirty child on her knee, and feeding with her own hand an impatient old
woman whom no one else would consent to touch.they talk about
repentance and a change of heart!If some one or something would only
change mine!no hope of my ever being
anything else than what I am: a selfish, wilful, mercenary girl."Nor was this mood a mere transitory one.That same night she made a
discovery which increased her apprehension almost to terror.This was
nothing less than the fact that Eleanore had been keeping a diary of
the last few weeks."Oh," she cried in relating this to me the next day,
"what security shall I ever feel as long as this diary of hers remains
to confront me every time I go into her room?And she will not consent
to destroy it, though I have done my best to show her that it is a
betrayal of the trust I reposed in her.She says it is all she has to
show in the way of defence, if uncle should ever accuse her of treachery
to him and his happiness.She promises to keep it locked up; but what
good will that do!A thousand accidents might happen, any of them
sufficient to throw it into uncle's hands.I shall never feel safe for a
moment while it exists."I endeavored to calm her by saying that if Eleanore was without malice,
such fears were groundless.But she would not be comforted, and seeing
her so wrought up, I suggested that Eleanore should be asked to trust it
into my keeping till such time as she should feel the necessity of using
it."O yes," she cried; "and I will
put my certificate with it, and so get rid of all my care at once."And before the afternoon was over, she had seen Eleanore and made her
request.It was acceded to with this proviso, that I was neither to destroy nor
give up all or any of the papers except upon their united demand.A
small tin box was accordingly procured, into which were put all the
proofs of Mary's marriage then existing, viz.Clavering's letters, and such leaves from Eleanore's diary as referred
to this matter.It was then handed over to me with the stipulation
I have already mentioned, and I stowed it away in a certain closet
upstairs, where it has lain undisturbed till last night.Belden paused, and, blushing painfully, raised her eyes to
mine with a look in which anxiety and entreaty were curiously blended."I don't know what you will say," she began, "but, led away by my
fears, I took that box out of its hiding-place last evening and,
notwithstanding your advice, carried it from the house, and it is
now----"

"In my possession," I quietly finished.I don't think I ever saw her look more astounded, not even when I told
her of Hannah's death."I left it last
night in the old barn that was burned down.I merely meant to hide it
for the present, and could think of no better place in my hurry; for the
barn is said to be haunted--a man hung himself there once--and no one
ever goes there.she cried, "unless----"

"Unless I found and brought it away before the barn was destroyed," I
suggested."Yes," said I. Then, as I felt my own countenance redden, hastened to
add: "We have been playing strange and unaccustomed parts, you and I.
Some time, when all these dreadful events shall be a mere dream of the
past, we will ask each other's pardon.The
box is safe, and I am anxious to hear the rest of your story."This seemed to compose her, and after a minute she continued:

Mary seemed more like herself after this.Leavenworth's return and their subsequent preparations for departure,
I saw but little more of her, what I did see was enough to make me
fear that, with the locking up of the proofs of her marriage, she was
indulging the idea that the marriage itself had become void.But I may
have wronged her in this.The story of those few weeks is almost finished.On the eve of the day
before she left, Mary came to my house to bid me good-by.She had a
present in her hand the value of which I will not state, as I did not
take it, though she coaxed me with all her prettiest wiles.But she said
something that night that I have never been able to forget.I had been speaking of my hope that before two months had elapsed she
would find herself in a position to send for Mr.Clavering, and that
when that day came I should wish to be advised of it; when she suddenly
interrupted me by saying:

"Uncle will never be won upon, as you call it, while he lives.If I was
convinced of it before, I am sure of it now.Nothing but his death will
ever make it possible for me to send for Mr.Then, seeing
me look aghast at the long period of separation which this seemed to
betoken, blushed a little and whispered: "The prospect looks somewhat
dubious, doesn't it?"But," said I, "your uncle is only little past the prime of life and
appears to be in robust health; it will be years of waiting, Mary.""I don't know," she muttered, "I think not.Uncle is not as strong as he
looks and--" She did not say any more, horrified perhaps at the turn the
conversation was taking.But there was an expression on her countenance
that set me thinking at the time, and has kept me thinking ever since.Not that any actual dread of such an occurrence as has since happened
came to oppress my solitude during the long months which now intervened.I was as yet too much under the spell of her charm to allow anything
calculated to throw a shadow over her image to remain long in my
thoughts.But when, some time in the fall, a letter came to me
personally from Mr.Clavering, filled with a vivid appeal to tell
him something of the woman who, in spite of her vows, doomed him to a
suspense so cruel, and when, on the evening of the same day, a friend
of mine who had just returned from New York spoke of meeting Mary
Leavenworth at some gathering, surrounded by manifest admirers, I began
to realize the alarming features of the affair, and, sitting down, I
wrote her a letter.Not in the strain in which I had been accustomed to
talk to her,--I had not her pleading eyes and trembling, caressing hands
ever before me to beguile my judgment from its proper exercise,--but
honestly and earnestly, telling her how Mr.Clavering felt, and what a
risk she ran in keeping so ardent a lover from his rights.Robbins out of my calculations for the present, and
advise you to do the same.As for the gentleman himself, I have told him
that when I could receive him I would be careful to notify him."But do not let him be discouraged," she added in a postscript."When he
does receive his happiness, it will be a satisfying one."Ah, it is that _when_ which is likely to ruin all!But, intent only upon fulfilling her will, I sat down and wrote a letter
to Mr.Clavering, in which I stated what she had said, and begged him
to have patience, adding that I would surely let him know if any change
took place in Mary or her circumstances.And, having despatched it to
his address in London, awaited the development of events.In two weeks I heard of the sudden
death of Mr.Stebbins, the minister who had married them; and while
yet laboring under the agitation produced by this shock, was further
startled by seeing in a New York paper the name of Mr.Clavering among
the list of arrivals at the Hoffman House; showing that my letter to
him had failed in its intended effect, and that the patience Mary had
calculated upon so blindly was verging to its end.I was consequently
far from being surprised when, in a couple of weeks or so afterwards,
a letter came from him to my address, which, owing to the careless
omission of the private mark upon the envelope, I opened, and read
enough to learn that, driven to desperation by the constant failures
which he had experienced in all his endeavors to gain access to her in
public or private, a failure which he was not backward in ascribing
to her indisposition to see him, he had made up his mind to risk
everything, even her displeasure; and, by making an appeal to her uncle,
end the suspense under which he was laboring, definitely and at once."I
want you," he wrote; "dowered or dowerless, it makes little difference
to me.If you will not come of yourself, then I must follow the example
of the brave knights, my ancestors; storm the castle that holds you, and
carry you off by force of arms."Neither can I say I was much surprised, knowing Mary as I did, when, in
a few days from this, she forwarded to me for copying, this reply: "If
Mr.Robbins ever expects to be happy with Amy Belden, let him reconsider
the determination of which he speaks.Not only would he by such an
action succeed in destroying the happiness of her he professes to love,
but run the greater risk of effectually annulling the affection which
makes the tie between them endurable."It was the cry of warning
which a spirited, self-contained creature gives when brought to bay.It
made even me recoil, though I had known from the first that her pretty
wilfulness was but the tossing foam floating above the soundless depths
of cold resolve and most deliberate purpose.What its real effect was upon him and her fate I can only conjecture.All I know is that in two weeks thereafter Mr.Leavenworth was found
murdered in his room, and Hannah Chester, coming direct to my door from
the scene of violence, begged me to take her in and secrete her from
public inquiry, as I loved and desired to serve Mary Leavenworth.UNEXPECTED TESTIMONY


    _Pol._ What do you read, my lord?BELDEN paused, lost in the sombre shadow which these words were
calculated to evoke, and a short silence fell upon the room.It was
broken by my asking for some account of the occurrence she had just
mentioned, it being considered a mystery how Hannah could have found
entrance into her house without the knowledge of the neighbors."Well," said she, "it was a chilly night, and I had gone to bed early
(I was sleeping then in the room off this) when, at about a quarter to
one--the last train goes through R---- at 12.50--there came a low knock
on the window-pane at the head of my bed.Thinking that some of the
neighbors were sick, I hurriedly rose on my elbow and asked who
was there.The answer came in low, muffled tones, 'Hannah, Miss
Leavenworth's girl!Startled at
hearing the well-known voice, and fearing I knew not what, I caught up
a lamp and hurried round to the door.But no sooner had she done so than
my strength failed me, and I had to sit down, for I saw she looked very
pale and strange, was without baggage, and altogether had the appearance
of some wandering spirit.what brings you here in this condition and at this time
of night?''Miss Leavenworth has sent me,' she replied, in the low,
monotonous tone of one repeating a lesson by rote.'She told me to come
here; said you would keep me.I am not to go out of the house, and no
one is to know I am here.'I asked, trembling with a thousand
undefined fears; 'what has occurred?''I dare not say,' she whispered;
'I am forbid; I am just to stay here, and keep quiet.''But,' I began,
helping her to take off her shawl,--the dingy blanket advertised for
in the papers--'you must tell me.She surely did not forbid you to tell
_me?_' 'Yes she did; every one,' the girl replied, growing white in her
persistence, 'and I never break my word; fire couldn't draw it out
of me.'She looked so determined, so utterly unlike herself, as I
remembered her in the meek, unobtrusive days of our old acquaintance,
that I could do nothing but stare at her.'You will keep me,' she said;
'you will not turn me away?''No,' I said, 'I will not turn you away.'Thanking me, she quietly followed me
up-stairs.I put her into the room in which you found her, because it
was the most secret one in the house; and there she has remained ever
since, satisfied and contented, as far as I could see, till this very
same horrible day.""Did you have no explanation with her
afterwards?Did she never give you any information in regard to the
transactions which led to her flight?"Neither then nor when,
upon the next day, I confronted her with the papers in my hand, and the
awful question upon my lips as to whether her flight had been occasioned
by the murder which had taken place in Mr.Leavenworth's household, did
she do more than acknowledge she had run away on this account.Some one
or something had sealed her lips, and, as she said, 'Fire and torture
should never make her speak.'"Another short pause followed this; then, with my mind still hovering
about the one point of intensest interest to me, I said:

"This story, then, this account which you have just given me of Mary
Leavenworth's secret marriage and the great strait it put her
into--a strait from which nothing but her uncle's death could relieve
her--together with this acknowledgment of Hannah's that she had left
home and taken refuge here on the insistence of Mary Leavenworth, is the
groundwork you have for the suspicions you have mentioned?""Yes, sir; that and the proof of her interest in the matter which is
given by the letter I received from her yesterday, and which you say you
have now in your possession."Belden went on in a broken voice, "that it is wrong, in a
serious case like this, to draw hasty conclusions; but, oh, sir, how can
I help it, knowing what I do?"I did not answer; I was revolving in my mind the old question: was it
possible, in face of all these later developments, still to believe Mary
Leavenworth's own hand guiltless of her uncle's blood?"It is dreadful to come to such conclusions," proceeded Mrs.Belden,
"and nothing but her own words written in her own hand would ever have
driven me to them, but----"

"Pardon me," I interrupted; "but you said in the beginning of this
interview that you did not believe Mary herself had any direct hand in
her uncle's murder.Whatever I may think of her influence in inducing
it, I never could imagine her as having anything to do with its actual
performance.whatever was done on that dreadful night,
Mary Leavenworth never put hand to pistol or ball, or even stood by
while they were used; that you may be sure of.Only the man who loved
her, longed for her, and felt the impossibility of obtaining her by any
other means, could have found nerve for an act so horrible.""Then you think----"

"Mr.I do: and oh, sir, when you consider that he
is her husband, is it not dreadful enough?""It is, indeed," said I, rising to conceal how much I was affected by
this conclusion of hers.Something in my tone or appearance seemed to startle her."I hope and
trust I have not been indiscreet," she cried, eying me with something
like an incipient distrust."With this dead girl lying in my house, I
ought to be very careful, I know, but----"

"You have said nothing," was my earnest assurance as I edged towards the
door in my anxiety to escape, if but for a moment, from an atmosphere
that was stifling me."No one can blame you for anything you have
either said or done to-day.But"--and here I paused and walked hurriedly
back,--"I wish to ask one question more.Have you any reason, beyond
that of natural repugnance to believing a young and beautiful woman
guilty of a great crime, for saying what you have of Henry Clavering, a
gentleman who has hitherto been mentioned by you with respect?""No," she whispered, with a touch of her old agitation.I felt the reason insufficient, and turned away with something of the
same sense of suffocation with which I had heard that the missing key
had been found in Eleanore Leavenworth's possession."You must excuse
me," I said; "I want to be a moment by myself, in order to ponder over
the facts which I have just heard; I will soon return "; and without
further ceremony, hurried from the room.By some indefinable impulse, I went immediately up-stairs, and took my
stand at the western window of the large room directly over Mrs.The blinds were closed; the room was shrouded in funereal gloom, but
its sombreness and horror were for the moment unfelt; I was engaged in
a fearful debate with myself.Was Mary Leavenworth the principal, or
merely the accessory, in this crime?Gryce, the convictions of Eleanore, the circumstantial evidence even of
such facts as had come to our knowledge, preclude the possibility
that Mrs.That all the detectives
interested in the affair would regard the question as settled, I did not
doubt; but need it be?Was it utterly impossible to find evidence yet
that Henry Clavering was, after all, the assassin of Mr.Filled with the thought, I looked across the room to the closet where
lay the body of the girl who, according to all probability, had known
the truth of the matter, and a great longing seized me.Oh, why could
not the dead be made to speak?Why should she lie there so silent, so
pulseless, so inert, when a word from her were enough to decide the
awful question?Was there no power to compel those pallid lips to move?Carried away by the fervor of the moment, I made my way to her side.With what a mockery the closed lips and lids confronted
my demanding gaze!A stone could not have been more unresponsive.With a feeling that was almost like anger, I stood there, when--what
was it I saw protruding from beneath her shoulders where they crushed
against the bed?Dizzy with the sudden surprise, overcome with the wild hopes this
discovery awakened, I stooped in great agitation and drew the letter
out.Breaking it hastily open, I took
a glance at its contents.it was the work of the girl
herself!--its very appearance was enough to make that evident!Feeling
as if a miracle had happened, I hastened with it into the other room,
and set myself to decipher the awkward scrawl.This is what I saw, rudely printed in lead pencil on the inside of a
sheet of common writing-paper:

"I am a wicked girl.I have knone things all the time which I had ought
to have told but I didn't dare to he said he would kill me if I did I
mene the tall splendud looking gentulman with the black mustash who I
met coming out of Mister Levenworth's room with a key in his hand the
night Mr.He was so scared he gave me money and
made me go away and come here and keep every thing secret but I can't do
so no longer.I seem to see Miss Elenor all the time crying and asking
me if I want her sent to prisun.And this is
the truth and my last words and I pray every body's forgivness and hope
nobody will blame me and that they wont bother Miss Elenor any more but
go and look after the handsome gentulman with the black mushtash."THE PROBLEM SOLVED



XXXIV.GRYCE RESUMES CONTROL


    "It out-herods Herod."--Richard III

A HALF-HOUR had passed.The train upon which I had every reason to
expect Mr.Gryce had arrived, and I stood in the doorway awaiting with
indescribable agitation the slow and labored approach of the motley
group of men and women whom I had observed leave the depot at the
departure of the cars.Was the telegram of a
nature peremptory enough to make his presence here, sick as he was, an
absolute certainty?The written confession of Hannah throbbing against
my heart, a heart all elation now, as but a short half-hour before it
had been all doubt and struggle, seemed to rustle distrust, and the
prospect of a long afternoon spent in impatience was rising before me,
when a portion of the advancing crowd turned off into a side street,
and I saw the form of Mr.Gryce hobbling, not on two sticks, but very
painfully on one, coming slowly down the street.His face, as he approached, was a study."Well, well, well," he exclaimed, as we met at the gate; "this is a
pretty how-dye-do, I must say.and everything turned
topsy-turvy!Humph, and what do you think of Mary Leavenworth now?"It would therefore seem natural, in the conversation which followed his
introduction into the house and installment in Mrs.Belden's parlor,
that I should begin my narration by showing him Hannah's confession; but
it was not so.Whether it was that I felt anxious to have him go through
the same alternations of hope and fear it had been my lot to experience
since I came to R----; or whether, in the depravity of human nature,
there lingered within me sufficient resentment for the persistent
disregard he had always paid to my suspicions of Henry Clavering to make
it a matter of moment to me to spring this knowledge upon him just at
the instant his own convictions seemed to have reached the point of
absolute certainty, I cannot say.Enough that it was not till I had
given him a full account of every other matter connected with my stay in
this house; not till I saw his eye beaming, and his lip quivering with
the excitement incident upon the perusal of the letter from Mary, found
in Mrs.Belden's pocket; not, indeed, until I became assured from such
expressions as "Tremendous!Nothing
like it since the Lafarge affair!"that in another moment he would be
uttering some theory or belief that once heard would forever stand like
a barrier between us, did I allow myself to hand him the letter I had
taken from under the dead body of Hannah.I shall never forget his expression as he received it; "Good heavens!"I found it lying in her bed when
I went up, a half-hour ago, to take a second look at her."Opening it, he glanced over it with an incredulous air that speedily,
however, turned to one of the utmost astonishment, as he hastily perused
it, and then stood turning it over and over in his hand, examining it."A remarkable piece of evidence," I observed, not without a certain
feeling of triumph; "quite changes the aspect of affairs!"he sharply retorted; then, whilst I stood staring at him in
amazement, his manner was so different from what I expected, looked up
and said: "You tell me that you found this in her bed."Under the body of the girl herself," I returned."I saw one corner of
it protruding from beneath her shoulders, and drew it out.""Was it folded or open, when you first
looked at it?""Folded; fastened up in this envelope," showing it to him.He took it, looked at it for a moment, and went on with his questions."This envelope has a very crumpled appearance, as well as the letter
itself."Yes, not only so, but doubled up as you see."Folded, sealed, and then doubled up
as if her body had rolled across it while alive?"No look as if the thing had been insinuated there
since her death?"I should rather say that to every appearance she held it in
her hand when she lay down, but turning over, dropped it and then laid
upon it."Gryce's eyes, which had been very bright, ominously clouded;
evidently he had been disappointed in my answers, paying the letter
down, he stood musing, but suddenly lifted it again, scrutinized the
edges of the paper on which it was written, and, darting me a quick
look, vanished with it into the shade of the window curtain.His manner
was so peculiar, I involuntarily rose to follow; but he waved me back,
saying:

"Amuse yourself with that box on the table, which you had such an ado
over; see if it contains all we have a right to expect to find in it.I
want to be by myself for a moment."Subduing my astonishment, I proceeded to comply with his request, but
scarcely had I lifted the lid of the box before me when he came hurrying
back, flung the letter down on the table with an air of the greatest
excitement, and cried:

"Did I say there had never been anything like it since the Lafarge
affair?I tell you there has never been anything like it in any affair.It is the rummest case on record!Raymond," and his eyes, in his
excitement, actually met mine for the first time in my experience of
him, "prepare yourself for a disappointment.This pretended confession
of Hannah's is a fraud!""Yes; fraud, forgery, what you will; the girl never wrote it."Amazed, outraged almost, I bounded from my chair.Bending forward, he put the letter into my hand."Look at it," said he;
"examine it closely.Now tell me what is the first thing you notice in
regard to it?""Why, the first thing that strikes me, is that the words are printed,
instead of written; something which might be expected from this girl,
according to all accounts.""That they are printed on the inside of a sheet of ordinary paper----"

"Ordinary paper?""That is, a sheet of commercial note of the ordinary quality.""Why, yes; I should say so."Oh, I see, they run up close to the top of the page;
evidently the scissors have been used here.""In short, it is a large sheet, trimmed down to the size of commercial
note?""Don't you perceive what has been lost by means of this trimming down?""No, unless you mean the manufacturer's stamp in the corner.""But I don't see why the loss of that
should be deemed a matter of any importance."Not when you consider that by it we seem to be deprived of
all opportunity of tracing this sheet back to the quire of paper from
which it was taken?"then you are more of an amateur than I thought you.Don't you
see that, as Hannah could have had no motive for concealing where the
paper came from on which she wrote her dying words, this sheet must have
been prepared by some one else?""No," said I; "I cannot say that I see all that."Why should Hannah, a girl about to
commit suicide, care whether any clue was furnished, in her confession,
to the actual desk, drawer, or quire of paper from which the sheet was
taken, on which she wrote it?""Yet especial pains have been taken to destroy that clue.""But----"

"Then there is another thing.Raymond,
and tell me what you gather from it.""Why," said I, after complying, "that the girl, worn out with constant
apprehension, has made up her mind to do away with herself, and that
Henry Clavering----"

"Henry Clavering?"The interrogation was put with so much meaning, I looked up."Ah, I didn't know that Mr.Clavering's name was mentioned there; excuse
me.""His name is not mentioned, but a description is given so strikingly in
accordance----"

Here Mr."Does it not seem a little surprising to
you that a girl like Hannah should have stopped to describe a man she
knew by name?"Belden's story, don't you?""Consider her accurate in her relation of what took place here a year
ago?""Must believe, then, that Hannah, the go-between, was acquainted with
Mr.If her intention was, as she here
professes, to save Eleanore Leavenworth from the false imputation which
had fallen upon her, she would naturally take the most direct method
of doing it.This description of a man whose identity she could have at
once put beyond a doubt by the mention of his name is the work, not of
a poor, ignorant girl, but of some person who, in attempting to play the
_role_ of one, has signally failed.Belden,
according to you, maintains that Hannah told her, upon entering the
house, that Mary Leavenworth sent her here.But in this document, she
declares it to have been the work of Black Mustache.""I know; but could they not have both been parties to the transaction?""Yes," said he; "yet it is always a suspicious circumstance, when there
is a discrepancy between the written and spoken declaration of a person.But why do we stand here fooling, when a few words from this Mrs.Belden, you talk so much about, will probably settle the whole matter!""I have had thousands
from her to-day, and find the matter no nearer settled than in the
beginning.""_You_ have had," said he, "but I have not."One thing," said I, "before I go.What if Hannah had found the
sheet of paper, trimmed just as it is, and used it without any thought
of the suspicions it would occasion!"said he, "that is just what we are going to find out."Belden was in a flutter of impatience when I entered the
sitting-room.and what did I
imagine this detective would do for us?It was dreadful waiting there
alone for something, she knew not what.I calmed her as well as I could, telling her the detective had not yet
informed me what he could do, having some questions to ask her first.Gryce, who in the short interim of my absence had altered his mood
from the severe to the beneficent, received Mrs.Belden with just that
show of respectful courtesy likely to impress a woman as dependent as
she upon the good opinion of others.and this is the lady in whose house this very disagreeable event
has occurred," he exclaimed, partly rising in his enthusiasm to greet
her."May I request you to sit," he asked; "if a stranger may be allowed
to take the liberty of inviting a lady to sit in her own house.""It does not seem like my own house any longer," said she, but in a sad,
rather than an aggressive tone; so much had his genial way imposed upon
her."Little better than a prisoner here, go and come, keep silence or
speak, just as I am bidden; and all because an unhappy creature, whom
I took in for the most unselfish of motives, has chanced to die in my
house!"This sudden death
ought to be easily explained.You say you had no poison in the house?""And that no one has ever been here to see her?""So that she could not have procured any such thing if she had wished?""Unless," he added suavely, "she had it with her when she came here?"She brought no baggage; and as for her
pocket, I know everything there was in it, for I looked.""Some money in bills, more than you would have expected such a girl to
have, some loose pennies, and a common handkerchief.""Well, then, it is proved the girl didn't die of poison, there being
none in the house."He said this in so convinced a tone she was deceived."That is just what I have been telling Mr.Raymond," giving me a
triumphant look."Must have been heart disease," he went on, "You say she was well
yesterday?""I did not say that; she was, sir, very.""What, ma'am, this girl?"I
should think her anxiety about those she had left behind her in the city
would have been enough to keep her from being very cheerful."Belden; "but it wasn't so.On the
contrary, she never seemed to worry about them at all."not about Miss Eleanore, who, according to the papers, stands
in so cruel a position before the world?But perhaps she didn't know
anything about that--Miss Leavenworth's position, I mean?""Yes, she did, for I told her.I was so astonished I could not keep
it to myself.You see, I had always considered Eleanore as one above
reproach, and it so shocked me to see her name mentioned in the
newspaper in such a connection, that I went to Hannah and read the
article aloud, and watched her face to see how she took it."She looked as if she didn't understand; asked me why I
read such things to her, and told me she didn't want to hear any more;
that I had promised not to trouble her about this murder, and that if I
continued to do so she wouldn't listen."She put her hand over her ears and frowned in such a
sullen way I left the room.""She has, however, mentioned the subject since?"not asked what they were going to do with her mistress?""She has shown, however, that something was preying on her mind--fear,
remorse, or anxiety?""No, sir; on the contrary, she has oftener appeared like one secretly
elated."Gryce, with another sidelong look at me, "that was
very strange and unnatural.I used to try to explain it by thinking her sensibilities
had been blunted, or that she was too ignorant to comprehend the
seriousness of what had happened; but as I learned to know her better,
I gradually changed my mind.There was too much method in her gayety for
that.I could not help seeing she had some future before her for which
she was preparing herself.As, for instance, she asked me one day if I
thought she could learn to play on the piano.And I finally came to the
conclusion she had been promised money if she kept the secret intrusted
to her, and was so pleased with the prospect that she forgot the
dreadful past, and all connected with it.At all events, that was the
only explanation I could find for her general industry and desire to
improve herself, or for the complacent smiles I detected now and then
stealing over her face when she didn't know I was looking."Not such a smile as crept over the countenance of Mr.Gryce at that
moment, I warrant.Belden, "which made her death such a
shock to me.I couldn't believe that so cheerful and healthy a creature
could die like that, all in one night, without anybody knowing anything
about it.But----"

"Wait one moment," Mr."You speak of her endeavors
to improve herself."Her desire to learn things she didn't know; as, for instance, to write
and read writing.She could only clumsily print when she came here."Gryce would take a piece out of my arm, he griped it so.Do you mean to say that since she has been with you
she has learned to write?""Yes, sir; I used to set her copies and----"

"Where are these copies?"Gryce, subduing his voice to its
most professional tone.I'd like
to see some of them.I always made it a point to destroy them as soon as
they had answered their purpose.I didn't like to have such things lying
around."Do," said he; "and I will go with you.I want to take a look at things
upstairs, any way."And, heedless of his rheumatic feet, he rose and
prepared to accompany her."This is getting very intense," I whispered, as he passed me.The smile he gave me in reply would have made the fortune of a Thespian
Mephistopheles.Of the ten minutes of suspense which I endured in their absence, I say
nothing.At the end of that time they returned with their hands full of
paper boxes, which they flung down on the table."The writing-paper of the household," observed Mr.Gryce; "every scrap
and half-sheet which could be found.But, before you examine it, look at
this."And he held out a sheet of bluish foolscap, on which were written
some dozen imitations of that time-worn copy, "BE GOOD AND YOU WILL
BE HAPPY"; with an occasional "_Beauty soon fades,"_ and "_Evil
communications corrupt good manners."_

"What do you think of that?"The only specimens of her writing to be found.Not much like some scrawls we have seen, eh?"Belden says this girl has known how to write as good as this for
more than a week.Took great pride in it, and was continually talking
about how smart she was."Leaning over, he whispered in my ear, "This
thing you have in your hand must have been scrawled some time ago, if
she did it."Then aloud: "But let us look at the paper she used to write
on."Dashing open the covers of the boxes on the table, he took out the loose
sheets lying inside, and scattered them out before me.One glance showed
they were all of an utterly different quality from that used in the
confession."This is all the paper in the house," said he.Belden, who stood in
a sort of maze before us."Wasn't there one stray sheet lying around
somewhere, foolscap or something like that, which she might have got
hold of and used without your knowing it?""No, sir; I don't think so.I had only these kinds; besides, Hannah had
a whole pile of paper like this in her room, and wouldn't have been apt
to go hunting round after any stray sheets.""But you don't know what a girl like that might do.Look at this one,"
said I, showing her the blank side of the confession."Couldn't a sheet
like this have come from somewhere about the house?Examine it well; the
matter is important.""I have, and I say, no, I never had a sheet of paper like that in my
house."Gryce advanced and took the confession from my hand.As he did so,
he whispered: "What do you think now?Many chances that Hannah got up
this precious document?"I shook my head, convinced at last; but in another moment turned to him
and whispered back: "But, if Hannah didn't write it, who did?And how
came it to be found where it was?""That," said he, "is just what is left for us to learn."And, beginning
again, he put question after question concerning the girl's life in the
house, receiving answers which only tended to show that she could not
have brought the confession with her, much less received it from a
secret messenger.Belden's word, the mystery
seemed impenetrable, and I was beginning to despair of success, when Mr.Gryce, with an askance look at me, leaned towards Mrs.Belden and said:

"You received a letter from Miss Mary Leavenworth yesterday, I hear.""Now I want to ask you a question.Was the letter, as you see it, the
only contents of the envelope in which it came?Wasn't there one for
Hannah enclosed with it?"There was nothing in my letter for her; but she had a letter
herself yesterday.we both exclaimed; "and in the mail?""Yes; but it was not directed to her.It was"--casting me a look full of
despair, "directed to me.It was only by a certain mark in the corner of
the envelope that I knew----"

"Good heaven!"Why didn't you
speak of it before?What do you mean by allowing us to flounder about
here in the dark, when a glimpse at this letter might have set us right
at once?""I didn't think anything about it till this minute.I didn't know it was
of importance.I----"

But I couldn't restrain myself."No," said she; "I gave it to the girl yesterday; I haven't seen it
since."and I hastened
towards the door."You won't find it," said Mr.There
is nothing but a pile of burned paper in the corner.By the way, what
could that have been?"She hadn't anything to burn unless it was the
letter.""We will see about that," I muttered, hurrying upstairs and bringing
down the wash-bowl with its contents."If the letter was the one I saw
in your hand at the post-office, it was in a yellow envelope.""Yellow envelopes burn differently from white paper.I ought to be able
to tell the tinder made by a yellow envelope when I see it.Ah, the
letter has been destroyed; here is a piece of the envelope," and I drew
out of the heap of charred scraps a small bit less burnt than the rest,
and held it up."Then there is no use looking here for what the letter contained," said
Mr.Gryce, putting the wash-bowl aside."We will have to ask you, Mrs.It was directed to me, to be sure; but Hannah told
me, when she first requested me to teach her how to write, that she
expected such a letter, so I didn't open it when it came, but gave it to
her just as it was.""You, however, stayed by to see her read it?""No, sir; I was in too much of a flurry.Raymond had just come and I
had no time to think of her.My own letter, too, was troubling me.""But you surely asked her some questions about it before the day was
out?""Yes, sir, when I went up with her tea things; but she had nothing
to say.Hannah could be as reticent as any one I ever knew, when she
pleased.She didn't even admit it was from her mistress."then you thought it was from Miss Leavenworth?""Why, yes, sir; what else was I to think, seeing that mark in the
corner?Though, to be sure, it might have been put there by Mr."You say she was cheerful yesterday; was she so after receiving this
letter?""Yes, sir; as far as I could see.I wasn't with her long; the necessity
I felt of doing something with the box in my charge--but perhaps Mr."It was an exhausting evening, and quite put Hannah out of my head,
but----"

"Wait!"Gryce, and beckoning me into a corner, he whispered,
"Now comes in that experience of Q's.While you are gone from the house,
and before Mrs.Belden sees Hannah again, he has a glimpse of the girl
bending over something in the corner of her room which may very fairly
be the wash-bowl we found there.After which, he sees her swallow, in
the most lively way, a dose of something from a bit of paper."Very well, then," he cried, going back to Mrs."But----"

"But when I went upstairs to bed, I thought of the girl, and going to
her door opened it.The light was extinguished, and she seemed asleep,
so I closed it again and came out.""In something of the same position in which she was found this morning?""And that is all you can tell us, either of her letter or her mysterious
death?"Belden," said he, "you know Mr.Clavering's handwriting when _you_
see it?""Now, which of the two was upon the envelope of the letter you gave
Hannah?"It was a disguised handwriting and might have been that
of either; but I think----"

"Well?""That it was more like hers than his, though it wasn't like hers
either."Gryce enclosed the confession in his hand in the
envelope in which it had been found."You remember how large the letter
was which you gave her?""Oh, it was large, very large; one of the largest sort.""O yes; thick enough for two letters.""Large enough and thick enough to contain this?"laying the confession,
folded and enveloped as it was, before her."Yes, sir," giving it a look of startled amazement, "large enough and
thick enough to contain that."Gryce's eyes, bright as diamonds, flashed around the room, and
finally settled upon a fly traversing my coat-sleeve."Do you need to
ask now," he whispered, in a low voice, "where, and from whom, this
so-called confession comes?"He allowed himself one moment of silent triumph, then rising, began
folding the papers on the table and putting them in his pocket.He took me by the arm and led me across the hall into toe sitting-room."I am going back to New York, I am going to pursue this matter.I am
going to find out from whom came the poison which killed this girl, and
by whose hand this vile forgery of a confession was written.""But," said I, rather thrown off my balance by all this, "Q and the
coroner will be here presently, won't you wait to see them?""No; clues such as are given here must be followed while the trail is
hot; I can't afford to wait.""If I am not mistaken, they have already come," I remarked, as a
tramping of feet without announced that some one stood at the door."That is so," he assented, hastening to let them in.Judging from common experience, we had every reason to fear that an
immediate stop would be put to all proceedings on our part, as soon as
the coroner was introduced upon the scene.But happily for us and the
interest at stake, Dr.Fink, of R ----, proved to be a very sensible
man.He had only to hear a true story of the affair to recognize at
once its importance and the necessity of the most cautious action in
the matter.Further, by a sort of sympathy with Mr.Gryce, all the more
remarkable that he had never seen him before, he expressed himself
as willing to enter into our plans, offering not only to allow us the
temporary use of such papers as we desired, but even undertaking to
conduct the necessary formalities of calling a jury and instituting
an inquest in such a way as to give us time for the investigations we
proposed to make.Gryce was enabled to take the 6:30
train for New York, and I to follow on the 10 p.m.,--the calling of a
jury, ordering of an autopsy, and final adjournment of the inquiry till
the following Tuesday, having all taken place in the interim.FINE WORK


    "No hinge nor loop
     To hang a doubt on!""But yet the pity of it, Iago!Oh, Iago, the pity of it, Iago."Gryce before leaving R---- prepared me for
his next move."The clue to this murder is supplied by the paper on which the
confession is written.Find from whose desk or portfolio this especial
sheet was taken, and you find the double murderer," he had said.Consequently, I was not surprised when, upon visiting his house, early
the next morning, I beheld him seated before a table on which lay
a lady's writing-desk and a pile of paper, till told the desk was
Eleanore's."What," said I, "are you not
satisfied yet of her innocence?""O yes; but one must be thorough.No conclusion is valuable which is not
preceded by a full and complete investigation.Why," he cried, casting
his eyes complacently towards the fire-tongs, "I have even been
rummaging through Mr.Clavering's effects, though the confession bears
the proof upon its face that it could not have been written by him.It
is not enough to look for evidence where you expect to find it.You must
sometimes search for it where you don't.Now," said he, drawing the desk
before him, "I don't anticipate finding anything here of a criminating
character; but it is among the possibilities that I may; and that is
enough for a detective.""Did you see Miss Leavenworth this morning?"I asked, as he proceeded
to fulfil his intention by emptying the contents of the desk upon the
table."Yes; I was unable to procure what I desired without it.And she behaved
very handsomely, gave me the desk with her own hands, and never raised
an objection.To be sure, she had little idea what I was looking for;
thought, perhaps, I wanted to make sure it did not contain the letter
about which so much has been said.But it would have made but little
difference if she had known the truth.This desk contains nothing _we_
want.""Was she well; and had she heard of Hannah's sudden death?"I asked, in
my irrepressible anxiety."Yes, and feels it, as you might expect her to.But let us see what we
have here," said he, pushing aside the desk, and drawing towards him the
stack of paper I have already referred to."I found this pile, just as
you see it, in a drawer of the library table at Miss Mary Leavenworth's
house in Fifth Avenue.If I am not mistaken, it will supply us with the
clue we want.""But----"

"But this paper is square, while that of the confession is of the size
and shape of commercial note?I know; but you remember the sheet used in
the confession was trimmed down.Taking the confession from his pocket and the sheet from the pile before
him, he carefully compared them, then held them out for my inspection.A
glance showed them to be alike in color."Hold them up to the light," said he.I did so; the appearance presented by both was precisely alike.And, laying them both down on the
table, he placed the edges of the two sheets together.The lines on the
one accommodated themselves to the lines on the other; and that question
was decided."I was convinced of it," said he."From the
moment I pulled open that drawer and saw this mass of paper, I knew the
end was come.""But," I objected, in my old spirit of combativeness, "isn't there any
room for doubt?Every family on the
block might easily have specimens of it in their library.""It is letter size, and that has gone out.Leavenworth used it for his manuscript, or I doubt if it would have been
found in his library.But, if you are still incredulous, let us see what
can be done," and jumping up, he carried the confession to the window,
looked at it this way and that, and, finally discovering what he wanted,
came back and, laying it before me, pointed out one of the lines of
ruling which was markedly heavier than the rest, and another which was
so faint as to be almost undistinguishable."Defects like these often
run through a number of consecutive sheets," said he."If we could find
the identical half-quire from which this was taken, I might show you
proof that would dispel every doubt," and taking up the one that lay on
top, he rapidly counted the sheets."It might have
been taken from this one," said he; but, upon looking closely at the
ruling, he found it to be uniformly distinct.The remainder of the paper, some dozen or so half-quires, looked
undisturbed.Gryce tapped his fingers on the table and a frown
crossed his face."Such a pretty thing, if it could have been done!"Suddenly he took up the next half-quire."Count the
sheets," said he, thrusting it towards me, and himself lifting another."Go on with the rest," he cried.I counted the sheets in the next; twelve.He counted those in the one
following, and paused.He counted again, and quietly put them aside."I made a mistake," said
he.Taking another half-quire, he went
through with the same operation;--in vain.With a sigh of impatience he
flung it down on the table and looked up.he cried, "what is
the matter?""There are but eleven sheets in this package," I said, placing it in his
hand.The excitement he immediately evinced was contagious.Oppressed as I
was, I could not resist his eagerness.the light on the inside, the heavy one on the
outside, and both in positions precisely corresponding to those on
this sheet of Hannah's."The veriest doubter must succumb before this," returned I.

With something like a considerate regard for my emotion, he turned away."I am obliged to congratulate myself, notwithstanding the gravity of the
discovery that has been made," said he."It is so neat, so very neat,
and so conclusive.I declare I am myself astonished at the perfection
of the thing.he suddenly cried, in a tone
of the greatest admiration.I declare it is almost a pity to entrap a woman who has done
as well as this--taken a sheet from the very bottom of the pile, trimmed
it into another shape, and then, remembering the girl couldn't write,
put what she had to say into coarse, awkward printing, Hannah-like.or would have been, if any other man than myself had
had this thing in charge."And, all animated and glowing with his
enthusiasm, he eyed the chandelier above him as if it were the
embodiment of his own sagacity.Sunk in despair, I let him go on."Watched, circumscribed
as she was, could she have done any better?I hardly think so; the fact
of Hannah's having learned to write after she left here was fatal.No,
she could not have provided against that contingency."Gryce," I here interposed, unable to endure this any longer; "did
you have an interview with Miss Mary Leavenworth this morning?""No," said he; "it was not in the line of my present purpose to do so.I
doubt, indeed, if she knew I was in her house.A servant maid who has a
grievance is a very valuable assistant to a detective.With Molly at my
side, I didn't need to pay my respects to the mistress."Gryce," I asked, after another moment of silent self-congratulation
on his part, and of desperate self-control on mine, "what do you propose
to do now?You have followed your clue to the end and are satisfied.Such knowledge as this is the precursor of action."we will see," he returned, going to his private desk and
bringing out the box of papers which we had no opportunity of looking at
while in R----."First let us examine these documents, and see if they
do not contain some hint which may be of service to us."And taking out
the dozen or so loose sheets which had been torn from Eleanore's Diary,
he began turning them over.While he was doing this, I took occasion to examine the contents of
the box.Belden had led me to
expect,--a certificate of marriage between Mary and Mr.Clavering and
a half-dozen or more letters.While glancing over the former, a short
exclamation from Mr.He thrust into my hand the leaves of Eleanore's Diary."Most of it is a repetition of what you have already heard from Mrs.Belden, though given from a different standpoint; but there is one
passage in it which, if I am not mistaken, opens up the way to an
explanation of this murder such as we have not had yet.Begin at the
beginning; you won't find it dull."Eleanore's feelings and thoughts during that anxious time, dull!Mustering up my self-possession, I spread out the leaves in their order
and commenced:

"R----, July 6,-"

"Two days after they got there, you perceive," Mr.--A gentleman was introduced to us to-day upon the _piazza_ whom
I cannot forbear mentioning; first, because he is the most perfect
specimen of manly beauty I ever beheld, and secondly, because Mary, who
is usually so voluble where gentlemen are concerned, had nothing to say
when, in the privacy of our own apartment, I questioned her as to the
effect his appearance and conversation had made upon her.The fact
that he is an Englishman may have something to do with this; Uncle's
antipathy to every one of that nation being as well known to her as to
me.Her experience with
Charlie Somerville has made me suspicious.What if the story of last
summer were to be repeated here, with an Englishman for the hero!But
I will not allow myself to contemplate such a possibility.Uncle will
return in a few days, and then all communication with one who, however
prepossessing, is of a family and race with whom it is impossible for
us to unite ourselves, must of necessity cease.I doubt if I should have
thought twice of all this if Mr.Clavering had not betrayed, upon his
introduction to Mary, such intense and unrestrained admiration.Mary not only submits to the
attentions of Mr.To-day she sat
two hours at the piano singing over to him her favorite songs, and
to-night--But I will not put down every trivial circumstance that comes
under my observation; it is unworthy of me.And yet, how can I shut my
eyes when the happiness of so many I love is at stake!Clavering is not absolutely in love with Mary, he is on
the verge of it.He is a very fine-looking man, and too honorable to be
trifled with in this reckless fashion.She was absolutely
wonderful to-night in scarlet and silver.I think her smile the sweetest
I ever beheld, and in this I am sure Mr.Clavering passionately agrees
with me; he never looked away from her to-night.But it is not so easy
to read _her_ heart.To be sure, she appears anything but indifferent
to his fine appearance, strong sense, and devoted affection.But did she
not deceive us into believing she loved Charlie Somerville?In her case,
blush and smile go for little, I fear.Would it not be wiser under the
circumstances to say, I hope?Mary came into my room this evening, and
absolutely startled me by falling at my side and burying her face in my
lap.'Oh, Eleanore, Eleanore!'she murmured, quivering with what seemed
to me very happy sobs.But when I strove to lift her head to my breast,
she slid from my arms, and drawing herself up into her old attitude of
reserved pride, raised her hand as if to impose silence, and haughtily
left the room.There is but one interpretation to put upon this.Clavering has expressed his sentiments, and she is filled with that
reckless delight which in its first flush makes one insensible to the
existence of barriers which have hitherto been deemed impassable.Little did I think when I wrote the above that Uncle was
already in the house.He arrived unexpectedly on the last train, and
came into my room just as I was putting away my diary.Looking a little
care-worn, he took me in his arms and then asked for Mary.I dropped my
head, and could not help stammering as I replied that she was in her own
room.Instantly his love took alarm, and leaving me, he hastened to
her apartment, where I afterwards learned he came upon her sitting
abstractedly before her dressing-table with Mr.Clavering's family ring
on her finger.An unhappy scene, I fear,
for Mary is ill this morning, and Uncle exceedingly melancholy and
stern.Uncle not only refuses to consider
for a moment the question of Mary's alliance with Mr.Clavering, but
even goes so far as to demand his instant and unconditional dismissal.The knowledge of this came to me in the most distressing way.Recognizing the state of affairs, but secretly rebelling against a
prejudice which seemed destined to separate two persons otherwise fitted
for each other, I sought Uncle's presence this morning after breakfast,
and attempted to plead their cause.But he almost instantly stopped me
with the remark, 'You are the last one, Eleanore, who should seek to
promote this marriage.'Trembling with apprehension, I asked him
why.'For the reason that by so doing you work entirely for your own
interest.'More and more troubled, I begged him to explain himself.'I
mean,' said he, 'that if Mary disobeys me by marrying this Englishman,
I shall disinherit her, and substitute your name for hers in my will as
well as in my affection.'"For a moment everything swam before my eyes.'You will never make me so
wretched!''I will make you my heiress, if Mary persists
in her present determination,' he declared, and without further word
sternly left the room.What could I do but fall on my knees and pray!Of all in this miserable house, I am the most wretched.But I shall not be called upon to do it; Mary will give up Mr.Isn't it
becoming plain enough what was Mary's motive for this murder?But go on;
let us hear what followed."The next entry is dated July 19, and
runs thus:

"I was right.After a long struggle with Uncle's invincible will, Mary
has consented to dismiss Mr.I was in the room when she
made known her decision, and I shall never forget our Uncle's look of
gratified pride as he clasped her in his arms and called her his own
True Heart.He has evidently been very much exercised over this matter,
and I cannot but feel greatly relieved that affairs have terminated
so satisfactorily.What is there in her manner that vaguely
disappoints me?I only know that I felt a powerful
shrinking overwhelm me when she turned her face to me and asked if I
were satisfied now.But I conquered my feelings and held out my hand.The shadow of our late trial is upon
me yet; I cannot shake it off.Clavering's despairing
face wherever I go.How is it that Mary preserves her cheerfulness?If
she does not love him, I should think the respect which she must feel
for his disappointment would keep her from levity at least.Nothing I could say sufficed to keep him.Mary has only nominally separated from
Mr.Clavering; she still cherishes the idea of one day uniting herself
to him in marriage.The fact was revealed to me in a strange way not
necessary to mention here; and has since been confirmed by Mary herself.'I admire the man,' she declares, 'and have no intention of giving him
up.'Her only answer was a bitter
smile and a short,--'I leave that for you to do.'Worn completely out, but before my blood cools let
me write.I have just returned from seeing her give her
hand to Henry Clavering.Strange that I can write it without quivering
when my whole soul is one flush of indignation and revolt.Having left my room for a few minutes this morning,
I returned to find on my dressing-table a note from Mary in which she
informed me that she was going to take Mrs.Belden for a drive and would
not be back for some hours.Convinced, as I had every reason to be, that
she was on her way to meet Mr.Clavering, I only stopped to put on my
hat--"

There the Diary ceased."She was probably interrupted by Mary at this point," explained Mr."But we have come upon the one thing we wanted to know.Leavenworth threatened to supplant Mary with Eleanore if she persisted
in marrying contrary to his wishes.She did so marry, and to avoid the
consequences of her act she----"

"Say no more," I returned, convinced at last."But the writer of these words is saved," I went on, trying to grasp
the one comfort left me."No one who reads this Diary will ever dare to
insinuate she is capable of committing a crime.""Assuredly not; the Diary settles that matter effectually."I tried to be man enough to think of that and nothing else.To rejoice
in her deliverance, and let every other consideration go; but in this I
did not succeed."But Mary, her cousin, almost her sister, is lost," I
muttered.Gryce thrust his hands into his pockets and, for the first time,
showed some evidence of secret disturbance."Yes, I am afraid she is;
I really am afraid she is."Then after a pause, during which I felt a
certain thrill of vague hope: "Such an entrancing creature too!It is a
pity, it positively is a pity!I declare, now that the thing is worked
up, I begin to feel almost sorry we have succeeded so well.If there was the least loophole out of it," he muttered.The thing is clear as A, B, C."Suddenly he rose, and began
pacing the floor very thoughtfully, casting his glances here, there, and
everywhere, except at me, though I believe now, as then, my face was all
he saw."Would it be a very great grief to you, Mr.Raymond, if Miss Mary
Leavenworth should be arrested on this charge of murder?"he asked,
pausing before a sort of tank in which two or three disconsolate-looking
fishes were slowly swimming about."Yes," said I, "it would; a very great grief.""Yet it must be done," said he, though with a strange lack of his usual
decision."As an honest official, trusted to bring the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth to the notice of the proper authorities, I have got to do
it."Again that strange thrill of hope at my heart induced by his peculiar
manner.I am not so rich or so famous that I can afford to forget all that a
success like this may bring me.No, lovely as she is, I have got to push
it through."But even as he said this, he became still more thoughtful,
gazing down into the murky depths of the wretched tank before him with
such an intentness I half expected the fascinated fishes to rise from
the water and return his gaze.After a little while he turned, his indecision utterly gone.I shall then have my report ready for
the Superintendent.I should like to show it to you first, so don't fail
me."There was something so repressed in his expression, I could not prevent
myself from venturing one question."Yes," he returned, but in a peculiar tone, and with a peculiar gesture."And you are going to make the arrest you speak of?"GATHERED THREADS


    "This is the short and the long of it."PROMPTLY at the hour named, I made my appearance at Mr.I
found him awaiting me on the threshold."I have met you," said he gravely, "for the purpose of requesting you
not to speak during the coming interview.I am to do the talking; you
the listening.Neither are you to be surprised at anything I may do or
say.I am in a facetious mood"--he did not look so--"and may take it
into my head to address you by another name than your own.If I do,
don't mind it.Above all, don't talk: remember that."And without
waiting to meet my look of doubtful astonishment, he led me softly
up-stairs.The room in which I had been accustomed to meet him was at the top of
the first flight, but he took me past that into what appeared to be the
garret story, where, after many cautionary signs, he ushered me into
a room of singularly strange and unpromising appearance.In the first
place, it was darkly gloomy, being lighted simply by a very dim and
dirty skylight.Next, it was hideously empty; a pine table and two
hard-backed chairs, set face to face at each end of it, being the only
articles in the room.Lastly, it was surrounded by several closed doors
with blurred and ghostly ventilators over their tops which, being round,
looked like the blank eyes of a row of staring mummies.Altogether it
was a lugubrious spot, and in the present state of my mind made me
feel as if something unearthly and threatening lay crouched in the very
atmosphere.Nor, sitting there cold and desolate, could I imagine that
the sunshine glowed without, or that life, beauty, and pleasure paraded
the streets below.Gryce's expression, as he took a seat and beckoned me to do the
same, may have had something to do with this strange sensation, it was
so mysteriously and sombrely expectant."You'll not mind the room," said he, in so muffled a tone I scarcely
heard him."It's an awful lonesome spot, I know; but folks with such
matters before them mustn't be too particular as to the places in which
they hold their consultations, if they don't want all the world to know
as much as they do.Smith," and he gave me an admonitory shake of his
finger, while his voice took a more distinct tone, "I have done the
business; the reward is mine; the assassin of Mr.Leavenworth is found,
and in two hours will be in custody.Do you want to know who it
is?"leaning forward with every appearance of eagerness in tone and
expression.any
great change taken place in his conclusions?All this preparation could
not be for the purpose of acquainting me with what I already knew, yet--

He cut short my conjectures with a low, expressive chuckle."It was a
long chase, I tell you," raising his voice still more; "a tight go; a
woman in the business too; but all the women in the world can't pull
the wool over the eyes of Ebenezer Gryce when he is on a trail; and the
assassin of Mr.Leavenworth and"--here his voice became actually shrill
in his excitement--"and of Hannah Chester is found.he went on, though I had neither spoken nor made any move; "you
didn't know Hannah Chester was murdered.Well, she wasn't in one sense
of the word, but in another she was, and by the same hand that killed
the old gentleman.This scrap of paper
was found on the floor of her room; it had a few particles of white
powder sticking to it; those particles were tested last night and found
to be poison.But you say the girl took it herself, that she was a
suicide.You are right, she did take it herself, and it was a suicide;
but who terrified her into this act of self-destruction?Why, the one
who had the most reason to fear her testimony, of course.Well, sir, this girl left a confession behind her, throwing the
onus of the whole crime on a certain party believed to be innocent; this
confession was a forged one, known from three facts; first, that the
paper upon which it was written was unobtainable by the girl in the
place where she was; secondly, that the words used therein were printed
in coarse, awkward characters, whereas Hannah, thanks to the teaching of
the woman under whose care she has been since the murder, had learned to
write very well; thirdly, that the story told in the confession does not
agree with the one related by the girl herself.Now the fact of a forged
confession throwing the guilt upon an innocent party having been found
in the keeping of this ignorant girl, killed by a dose of poison, taken
with the fact here stated, that on the morning of the day on which she
killed herself the girl received from some one manifestly acquainted
with the customs of the Leavenworth family a letter large enough and
thick enough to contain the confession folded, as it was when found,
makes it almost certain to my mind that the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth
sent this powder and this so-called confession to the girl, meaning
her to use them precisely as she did: for the purpose of throwing off
suspicion from the right track and of destroying herself at the same
time; for, as you know, dead men tell no tales."He paused and looked at the dingy skylight above us.Why did the
air seem to grow heavier and heavier?Why did I shudder in vague
apprehension?I knew all this before; why did it strike me, then, as
something new?Ah, that is the secret; that is the bit of
knowledge which is to bring me fame and fortune.But, secret or not,
I don't mind telling you"; lowering his voice and rapidly raising it
again."The fact is, _I_ can't keep it to myself; it burns like a new
dollar in my pocket.Smith, my boy, the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth--but
stay, who does the world say it is?Whom do the papers point at and
shake their heads over?a young, beautiful, bewitching woman!The papers are right; it is a woman; young, beautiful, and
bewitching too.There is more
than one woman in this affair.Since Hannah's death I have heard it
openly advanced that she was the guilty party in the crime: bah!Others
cry it is the niece who was so unequally dealt with by her uncle in his
will: bah!But folks are not without some justification for this
latter assertion.Eleanore Leavenworth did know more of this matter than
appeared.Worse than that, Eleanore Leavenworth stands in a position of
positive peril to-day.If you don't think so, let me show you what the
detectives have against her."First, there is the fact that a handkerchief, with her name on it, was
found stained with pistol grease upon the scene of murder; a place which
she explicitly denies having entered for twenty-four hours previous to
the discovery of the dead body."Secondly, the fact that she not only evinced terror when confronted
with this bit of circumstantial evidence, but manifested a decided
disposition, both at this time and others, to mislead inquiry, shirking
a direct answer to some questions and refusing all answer to others."Thirdly, that an attempt was made by her to destroy a certain letter
evidently relating to this crime."Fourthly, that the key to the library door was seen in her possession."All this, taken with the fact that the fragments of the letter which
this same lady attempted to destroy within an hour after the inquest
were afterwards put together, and were found to contain a bitter
denunciation of one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, by a gentleman we will
call _X_ in other words, an unknown quantity--makes out a dark case
against _you,_ especially as after investigations revealed the fact that
a secret underlay the history of the Leavenworth family.That, unknown
to the world at large, and Mr.Leavenworth in particular, a marriage
ceremony had been performed a year before in a little town called F----
between a Miss Leavenworth and this same _X._ That, in other words, the
unknown gentleman who, in the letter partly destroyed by Miss Eleanore
Leavenworth, complained to Mr.Leavenworth of the treatment received
by him from one of his nieces, was in fact the secret husband of that
niece.And that, moreover, this same gentleman, under an assumed name,
called on the night of the murder at the house of Mr.Leavenworth and
asked for Miss Eleanore."Now you see, with all this against her, Eleanore Leavenworth is lost
if it cannot be proved, first that the articles testifying against her,
viz.: the handkerchief, letter, and key, passed after the murder through
other hands, before reaching hers; and secondly, that some one else had
even a stronger reason than she for desiring Mr.Leavenworth's death at
this time."Smith, my boy, both of these hypotheses have been established by me.By dint of moleing into old secrets, and following unpromising clues, I
have finally come to the conclusion that not Eleanore Leavenworth, dark
as are the appearances against her, but another woman, beautiful as
she, and fully as interesting, is the true criminal.In short, that her
cousin, the exquisite Mary, is the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth, and by
inference of Hannah Chester also."He brought this out with such force, and with such a look of triumph
and appearance of having led up to it, that I was for the moment
dumbfounded, and started as if I had not known what he was going to say.The stir I made seemed to awake an echo.Something like a suppressed
cry was in the air about me.All the room appeared to breathe horror and
dismay.Yet when, in the excitement of this fancy, I half turned round
to look, I found nothing but the blank eyes of those dull ventilators
staring upon me.Every one
else is engaged in watching the movements of Eleanore Leavenworth; I
only know where to put my hand upon the real culprit.Ebenezer Gryce deceived after a month of hard work!You are as
bad as Miss Leavenworth herself, who has so little faith in my sagacity
that she offered me, of all men, an enormous reward if I would find for
her the assassin of her uncle!But that is neither here nor there;
you have your doubts, and you are waiting for me to solve them.Know first that on the morning of the inquest I made
one or two discoveries not to be found in the records, viz.: that the
handkerchief picked up, as I have said, in Mr.Leavenworth's library,
had notwithstanding its stains of pistol grease, a decided perfume
lingering about it.Going to the dressing-table of the two ladies, I
sought for that perfume, and found it in Mary's room, not Eleanore's.This led me to examine the pockets of the dresses respectively worn by
them the evening before.In that of Eleanore I found a handkerchief,
presumably the one she had carried at that time.But in Mary's there was
none, nor did I see any lying about her room as if tossed down on
her retiring.The conclusion I drew from this was, that she, and
not Eleanore, had carried the handkerchief into her uncle's room, a
conclusion emphasized by the fact privately communicated to me by one of
the servants, that Mary was in Eleanore's room when the basket of clean
clothes was brought up with this handkerchief lying on top."But knowing the liability we are to mistake in such matters as these,
I made another search in the library, and came across a very curious
thing.Lying on the table was a penknife, and scattered on the floor
beneath, in close proximity to the chair, were two or three minute
portions of wood freshly chipped off from the leg of the table; all of
which looked as if some one of a nervous disposition had been sitting
there, whose hand in a moment of self-forgetfulness had caught up the
knife and unconsciously whittled the table.A little thing, you say;
but when the question is, which of two ladies, one of a calm and
self-possessed nature, the other restless in her ways and excitable in
her disposition, was in a certain spot at a certain time, it is these
little things that become almost deadly in their significance.No one
who has been with these two women an hour can hesitate as to whose
delicate hand made that cut in Mr.I distinctly overheard Eleanore accuse her cousin
of this deed.Now such a woman as Eleanore Leavenworth has proved
herself to be never would accuse a relative of crime without the
strongest and most substantial reasons.First, she must have been sure
her cousin stood in a position of such emergency that nothing but
the death of her uncle could release her from it; secondly, that her
cousin's character was of such a nature she would not hesitate to
relieve herself from a desperate emergency by the most desperate of
means; and lastly, been in possession of some circumstantial evidence
against her cousin, seriously corroborative of her suspicions.Smith,
all this was true of Eleanore Leavenworth.As to the character of her
cousin, she has had ample proof of her ambition, love of money, caprice
and deceit, it having been Mary Leavenworth, and not Eleanore, as was
first supposed, who had contracted the secret marriage already spoken
of.Of the critical position in which she stood, let the threat once
made by Mr.Leavenworth to substitute her cousin's name for hers in
his will in case she had married this _x_ be remembered, as well as the
tenacity with which Mary clung to her hopes of future fortune; while for
the corroborative testimony of her guilt which Eleanore is supposed
to have had, remember that previous to the key having been found in
Eleanore's possession, she had spent some time in her cousin's room; and
that it was at Mary's fireplace the half-burned fragments of that letter
were found,--and you have the outline of a report which in an hour's
time from this will lead to the arrest of Mary Leavenworth as the
assassin of her uncle and benefactor."A silence ensued which, like the darkness of Egypt, could be felt;
then a great and terrible cry rang through the room, and a man's form,
rushing from I knew not where, shot by me and fell at Mr.Gryce's feet
shrieking out:

"It is a lie!Mary Leavenworth is innocent as a babe unborn.CULMINATION


    "Saint seducing gold.""When our actions do not,
     Our fears do make us traitors."I NEVER saw such a look of mortal triumph on the face of a man as that
which crossed the countenance of the detective."Well," said he, "this is unexpected, but not wholly unwelcome.I am
truly glad to learn that Miss Leavenworth is innocent; but I must hear
some few more particulars before I shall be satisfied.Leavenworth, how comes it that things look so black against everybody
but yourself?"But in the hot, feverish eyes which sought him from the writhing form at
his feet, there was mad anxiety and pain, but little explanation.Seeing
him making unavailing efforts to speak, I drew near."Lean on me," said I, lifting him to his feet.His face, relieved forever from its mask of repression, turned towards
me with the look of a despairing spirit."Save
her--Mary--they are sending a report--stop it!""If there is a man here who believes in
God and prizes woman's honor, let him stop the issue of that report."And Henry Clavering, dignified as ever, but in a state of extreme
agitation, stepped into our midst through an open door at our right.But at the sight of his face, the man in our arms quivered, shrieked,
and gave one bound that would have overturned Mr.Clavering, herculean
of frame as he was, had not Mr.he cried; and holding back the secretary with one hand--where
was his rheumatism now!--he put the other in his pocket and drew thence
a document which he held up before Mr."It has not gone
yet," said he; "be easy.And you," he went on, turning towards Trueman
Harwell, "be quiet, or----"

His sentence was cut short by the man springing from his grasp."Let me have my revenge on him who, in face of all I
have done for Mary Leavenworth, dares to call her his wife!Let me--"
But at this point he paused, his quivering frame stiffening into stone,
and his clutching hands, outstretched for his rival's throat, falling
heavily back.Clavering's shoulder:
"it is she!she--" a low, shuddering sigh of longing and despair finished the
sentence: the door opened, and Mary Leavenworth stood before us!It was a moment to make young hairs turn gray.To see her face, so pale,
so haggard, so wild in its fixed horror, turned towards Henry Clavering,
to the utter ignoring of the real actor in this most horrible scene!Trueman Harwell could not stand it.cold, cold; not one glance for me,
though I have just drawn the halter from her neck and fastened it about
my own!"And, breaking from the clasp of the man who in his jealous rage would
now have withheld him, he fell on his knees before Mary, clutching her
dress with frenzied hands."You _shall_ look at me," he cried; "you
_shall_ listen to me!I will not lose body and soul for nothing.Mary,
they said you were in peril!I could not endure that thought, so I
uttered the truth,--yes, though I knew what the consequence would
be,--and all I want now is for you to say you believe me, when I swear
that I only meant to secure to you the fortune you so much desired; that
I never dreamed it would come to this; that it was because I loved you,
and hoped to win your love in return that I----"

But she did not seem to see him, did not seem to hear him.Her eyes were
fixed upon Henry Clavering with an awful inquiry in their depths, and
none but he could move her."Ice that you are, you
would not turn your head if I should call to you from the depths of
hell!"Pushing her hands down upon his
shoulders as though she would sweep some impediment from her path, she
endeavored to advance.she cried, indicating
her husband with one quivering hand."What has he done that he should be
brought here to confront me at this awful time?"'"I told her to come here to meet her uncle's murderer," whispered Mr.But before I could reply to her, before Mr.Clavering himself could
murmur a word, the guilty wretch before her had started to his feet.It is because these gentlemen,
chivalrous and honorable as they consider themselves, think that you,
the beauty and the Sybarite, committed with your own white hand the
deed of blood which has brought you freedom and fortune.Yes, yes, this
man"--turning and pointing at me--"friend as he has made himself out to
be, kindly and honorable as you have doubtless believed him, but who in
every look he has bestowed upon you, every word he has uttered in your
hearing during all these four horrible weeks, has been weaving a cord
for your neck--thinks you the assassin of your uncle, unknowing that a
man stood at your side ready to sweep half the world from your path if
that same white hand rose in bidding.now she could see him: now she could hear him!"Yes," clutching her robe again as she hastily recoiled; "didn't you
know it?When in that dreadful hour of your rejection by your uncle, you
cried aloud for some one to help you, didn't you know----"

"Don't!"she shrieked, bursting from him with a look of unspeakable
horror.she gasped, "is the mad cry of a stricken
woman for aid and sympathy the call for a murderer?"And turning away
in horror, she moaned: "Who that ever looks at me now will forget that
a man--such a man!--dared to think that, because I was in mortal
perplexity, I would accept the murder of my best friend as a relief from
it!""Oh, what a chastisement for folly!""What a punishment for the love of money which has always been
my curse!"Henry Clavering could no longer restrain himself, leaping to her side,
he bent over her.Are you guiltless of
any deeper wrong?Is there no link of complicity between you two?Have
you nothing on your soul but an inordinate desire to preserve your place
in your uncle's will, even at the risk of breaking my heart and wronging
your noble cousin?placing
his hand on her head, he pressed it slowly back and gazed into her eyes;
then, without a word, took her to his breast and looked calmly around
him.It was the uplifting of a stifling pall.No one in the room, unless it
was the wretched criminal shivering before us, but felt a sudden influx
of hope.Even Mary's own countenance caught a glow.she whispered,
withdrawing from his arms to look better into his face, "and is this the
man I have trifled with, injured, and tortured, till the very name of
Mary Leavenworth might well make him shudder?Is this he whom I married
in a fit of caprice, only to forsake and deny?Henry, do you declare
me innocent in face of all you have seen and heard; in face of that
moaning, chattering wretch before us, and my own quaking flesh and
evident terror; with the remembrance on your heart and in your mind of
the letter I wrote you the morning after the murder, in which I prayed
you to keep away from me, as I was in such deadly danger the least hint
given to the world that I had a secret to conceal would destroy me?Do
you, can you, will you, declare me innocent before God and the world?"A light such as had never visited her face before passed slowly over it."Then God forgive me the wrong I have done this noble heart, for I can
never forgive myself!"Before I
accept any further tokens of your generous confidence, let me show you
what I am.You shall know the worst of the woman you have taken to your
heart.Raymond," she cried, turning towards me for the first time,
"in those days when, with such an earnest desire for my welfare (you see
I do not believe this man's insinuations), you sought to induce me to
speak out and tell all I knew concerning this dreadful deed, I did not
do it because of my selfish fears.I knew the case looked dark against
me.Eleanore herself--and it was the keenest
pang I had to endure--believed me guilty.She knew
first, from the directed envelope she had found lying underneath my
uncle's dead body on the library table, that he had been engaged at the
moment of death in summoning his lawyer to make that change in his will
which would transfer my claims to her; secondly, that notwithstanding
my denial of the same, I had been down to his room the night before, for
she had heard my door open and my dress rustle as I passed out.But that
was not all; the key that every one felt to be a positive proof of guilt
wherever found, had been picked up by her from the floor of my room; the
letter written by Mr.Clavering to my uncle was found in my fire; and
the handkerchief which she had seen me take from the basket of clean
clothes, was produced at the inquest stained with pistol grease.I could not stir without encountering some new toil.I knew I was
innocent; but if I failed to satisfy my cousin of this, how could I
hope to convince the general public, if once called upon to do so.Worse
still, if Eleanore, with every apparent motive for desiring long life
to our uncle, was held in such suspicion because of a few circumstantial
evidences against her, what would I not have to fear if these evidences
were turned against me, the heiress!The tone and manner of the juryman
at the inquest that asked who would be most benefited by my uncle's will
showed but too plainly.When, therefore, Eleanore, true to her heart's
generous instincts, closed her lips and refused to speak when speech
would have been my ruin, I let her do it, justifying myself with the
thought that she had deemed me capable of crime, and so must bear the
consequences.Nor, when I saw how dreadful these were likely to
prove, did I relent.Fear of the ignominy, suspense, and danger which
confession would entail sealed my lips.That
was when, in the last conversation we had, I saw that, notwithstanding
appearances, you believed in Eleanore's innocence, and the thought
crossed me you might be induced to believe in mine if I threw myself
upon your mercy.Clavering came; and as in a flash I
seemed to realize what my future life would be, stained by suspicion,
and, instead of yielding to my impulse, went so far in the other
direction as to threaten Mr.Clavering with a denial of our marriage if
he approached me again till all danger was over."Yes, he will tell you that was my welcome to him when, with heart
and brain racked by long suspense, he came to my door for one word of
assurance that the peril I was in was not of my own making.That was the
greeting I gave him after a year of silence every moment of which was
torture to him.But he forgives me; I see it in his eyes; I hear it in
his accents; and you--oh, if in the long years to come you can forget
what I have made Eleanore suffer by my selfish fears; if with the shadow
of her wrong before you, you can by the grace of some sweet hope think
a little less hardly of me, do.As for this man--torture could not be
worse to me than this standing with him in the same room--let him
come forward and declare if I by look or word have given him reason to
believe I understood his passion, much less returned it.""Don't you see it was your indifference which
drove me mad?To stand before you, to agonize after you, to follow you
with thoughts in every move you made; to know my soul was welded to
yours with bands of steel no fire could melt, no force destroy, no
strain dissever; to sleep under the same roof, sit at the same table,
and yet meet not so much as one look to show me you understood!It was
that which made my life a hell.If I had to leap into a pit of flame, you should know what I was, and
what my passion for you was.Shrink as you will from my presence, cower as you may to the weak man
you call husband, you can never forget the love of Trueman Harwell;
never forget that love, love, love, was the force which led me down into
your uncle's room that night, and lent me will to pull the trigger which
poured all the wealth you hold this day into your lap.Yes," he went on,
towering in his preternatural despair till even the noble form of Henry
Clavering looked dwarfed beside him, "every dollar that chinks from
your purse shall talk of me.Every gew-gaw which flashes on that haughty
head, too haughty to bend to me, shall shriek my name into your ears.Fashion, pomp, luxury,--you will have them all; but till gold loses its
glitter and ease its attraction you will never forget the hand that gave
them to you!"With a look whose evil triumph I cannot describe, he put his hand into
the arm of the waiting detective, and in another moment would have been
led from the room; when Mary, crushing down the swell of emotions that
was seething in her breast, lifted her head and said:

"No, Trueman Harwell; I cannot give you even that thought for your
comfort.Wealth so laden would bring nothing but torture.I cannot
accept the torture, so must release the wealth.From this day, Mary
Clavering owns nothing but what comes to her from the husband she has so
long and so basely wronged."And raising her hands to her ears, she tore
out the diamonds which hung there, and flung them at the feet of the
unfortunate man.With a yell such as I never thought
to listen to from the lips of a man, he flung up his arms, while all the
lurid light of madness glared on his face."And I have given my soul to
hell for a shadow!""Well, that is the best day's work I ever did!Raymond, upon the success of the most daring game ever played in a
detective's office."I looked at the triumphant countenance of Mr.I cried; "did you plan all this?""Could I stand here, seeing how things
have turned out, if I had not?You
are a gentleman, but we can well shake hands over this.I have never
known such a satisfactory conclusion to a bad piece of business in all
my professional career."We did shake hands, long and fervently, and then I asked him to explain
himself."Well," said he, "there has always been one thing that plagued me, even
in the very moment of my strongest suspicion against this woman, and
that was, the pistol-cleaning business.I could not reconcile it with
what I knew of womankind.I could not make it seem the act of a woman.Did you ever know a woman who cleaned a pistol?They can fire them,
and do; but after firing them, they do not clean them.Now it is a
principle which every detective recognizes, that if of a hundred leading
circumstances connected with a crime, ninety-nine of these are acts
pointing to the suspected party with unerring certainty, but the
hundredth equally important act one which that person could not have
performed, the whole fabric of suspicion is destroyed.Recognizing this
principle, then, as I have said, I hesitated when it came to the point
of arrest.The chain was complete; the links were fastened; but one link
was of a different size and material from the rest; and in this argued a
break in the chain.Harwell, two persons whom I had no reason to suspect,
but who were the only persons beside herself who could have committed
this crime, being the only persons of intellect who were in the house
or believed to be, at the time of the murder, I notified them separately
that the assassin of Mr.Leavenworth was not only found, but was
about to be arrested in my house, and that if they wished to hear
the confession which would be sure to follow, they might have the
opportunity of doing so by coming here at such an hour.They were both
too much interested, though for very different reasons, to refuse; and
I succeeded in inducing them to conceal themselves in the two rooms from
which you saw them issue, knowing that if either of them had committed
this deed, he had done it for the love of Mary Leavenworth, and
consequently could not hear her charged with crime, and threatened
with arrest, without betraying himself.I did not hope much from the
experiment; least of all did I anticipate that Mr.Harwell would prove
to be the guilty man--but live and learn, Mr.A FULL CONFESSION


    "Between the acting of a dreadful thing,
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council; and the state of a man,
    Like to a little Kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection."I AM not a bad man; I am only an intense one.Ambition, love, jealousy,
hatred, revenge--transitory emotions with some, are terrific passions
with me.To be sure, they are quiet and concealed ones, coiled serpents
that make no stir till aroused; but then, deadly in their spring and
relentless in their action.Those who have known me best have not known
this.Often and often have I heard
her say: "If Trueman only had more sensibility!If Trueman were not so
indifferent to everything!In short, if Trueman had more power in him!"They thought me meek;
called me Dough-face.For three years they called me this, then I turned
upon them.Choosing out their ringleader, I felled him to the ground,
laid him on his back, and stamped upon him.He was handsome before
my foot came down; afterwards--Well, it is enough he never called me
Dough-face again.In the store I entered soon after, I met with even
less appreciation.Regular at my work and exact in my performance of it,
they thought me a good machine and nothing more.What heart, soul, and
feeling could a man have who never sported, never smoked, and never
laughed?I could reckon up figures correctly, but one scarcely needed
heart or soul for that.I could even write day by day and month by month
without showing a flaw in my copy; but that only argued I was no more
than they intimated, a regular automaton.I let them think so, with the
certainty before me that they would one day change their minds as others
had done.The fact was, I loved nobody well enough, not even myself,
to care for any man's opinion.Life was well-nigh a blank to me; a dead
level plain that had to be traversed whether I would or not.And such
it might have continued to this day if I had never met Mary Leavenworth.But when, some nine months since, I left my desk in the counting-house
for a seat in Mr.Leavenworth's library, a blazing torch fell into
my soul whose flame has never gone out, and never will, till the doom
before me is accomplished.When, on that first evening, I followed my new
employer into the parlor, and saw this woman standing up before me
in her half-alluring, half-appalling charm, I knew, as by a lightning
flash, what my future would be if I remained in that house.She was
in one of her haughty moods, and bestowed upon me little more than a
passing glance.But her indifference made slight impression upon me
then.It was enough that I was allowed to stand in her presence and look
unrebuked upon her loveliness.To be sure, it was like gazing into the
flower-wreathed crater of an awakening volcano.Fear and fascination
were in each moment I lingered there; but fear and fascination made the
moment what it was, and I could not have withdrawn if I would.Unspeakable pain as well as pleasure was in the
emotion with which I regarded her.Yet for all that I did not cease to
study her hour by hour and day by day; her smiles, her movement, her way
of turning her head or lifting her eyelids.I
wished to knit her beauty so firmly into the warp and woof of my being
that nothing could ever serve to tear it away.For I saw then as plainly
as now that, coquette though she was, she would never stoop to me.No;
I might lie down at her feet and let her trample over me; she would not
even turn to see what it was she had stepped upon.I might spend days,
months, years, learning the alphabet of her wishes; she would not thank
me for my pains or even raise the lashes from her cheek to look at me as
I passed.I was nothing to her, could not be anything unless--and this
thought came slowly--I could in some way become her master.Leavenworth's dictation and pleased him.My
methodical ways were just to his taste.As for the other member of the
family, Miss Eleanore Leavenworth--she treated me just as one of her
proud but sympathetic nature might be expected to do.Not familiarly,
but kindly; not as a friend, but as a member of the household whom she
met every day at table, and who, as she or any one else could see, was
none too happy or hopeful.I had learned two things; first, that Mary
Leavenworth loved her position as prospective heiress to a large fortune
above every other earthly consideration; and secondly, that she was in
the possession of a secret which endangered that position.What this
was, I had for some time no means of knowing.But when later I became
convinced it was one of love, I grew hopeful, strange as it may seem.Leavenworth's disposition almost as
perfectly as that of his niece, and knew that in a matter of this kind
he would be uncompromising; and that in the clashing of these two wills
something might occur which would give me a hold upon her.The only
thing that troubled me was the fact that I did not know the name of the
man in whom she was interested.One
day--a month ago now--I sat down to open Mr.ran thus:

"HOFFMAN HOUSE,

"March 1, 1876."HORATIO LEAVENWORTH:

"DEAR SIR,--You have a niece whom you love and trust, one, too, who
seems worthy of all the love and trust that you or any other man can
give her; so beautiful, so charming, so tender is she in face, form,
manner, and conversation.But, dear sir, every rose has its thorn, and
your rose is no exception to this rule.Lovely as she is, charming as
she is, tender as she is, she is not only capable of trampling on the
rights of one who trusted her, but of bruising the heart and breaking
the spirit of him to whom she owes all duty, honor, and observance."If you don't believe this, ask her to her cruel, bewitching face, who
and what is her humble servant, and yours.If a bombshell had exploded at my feet, or the evil one himself appeared
at my call, I would not have been more astounded.Not only was the name
signed to these remarkable words unknown to me, but the epistle itself
was that of one who felt himself to be her master: a position which, as
you know, I was myself aspiring to occupy.For a few minutes, then, I
stood a prey to feelings of the bitterest wrath and despair; then I grew
calm, realizing that with this letter in my possession I was virtually
the arbitrator of her destiny.Some men would have sought her there and
then and, by threatening to place it in her uncle's hand, won from her
a look of entreaty, if no more; but I--well, my plans went deeper than
that.I knew she would have to be in extremity before I could hope to
win her.She must feel herself slipping over the edge of the precipice
before she would clutch at the first thing offering succor.I decided
to allow the letter to pass into my employer's hands.How could I manage to give it to him in this condition without
exciting his suspicion?I knew of but one way; to let him see me open it
for what he would consider the first time.So, waiting till he came into
the room, I approached him with the letter, tearing off the end of the
envelope as I came.Opening it, I gave a cursory glance at its contents
and tossed it down on the table before him."That appears to be of a private character," said I, "though there is no
sign to that effect on the envelope."At the first word he started, looked
at me, seemed satisfied from my expression that I had not read far
enough to realize its nature, and, whirling slowly around in his chair,
devoured the remainder in silence.I waited a moment, then withdrew to
my own desk.One minute, two minutes passed in silence; he was evidently
rereading the letter; then he hurriedly rose and left the room.As he
passed me I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror.The expression I
saw there did not tend to lessen the hope that was rising in my breast.By following him almost immediately up-stairs I ascertained that he
went directly to Mary's room, and when in a few hours later the family
collected around the dinner table, I perceived, almost without looking
up, that a great and insurmountable barrier had been raised between him
and his favorite niece.Two days passed; days that were for me one long and unrelieved suspense.Would it all end as it had
begun, without the appearance of the mysterious Clavering on the scene?Meanwhile my monotonous work went on, grinding my heart beneath its
relentless wheel.I wrote and wrote and wrote, till it seemed as if my
life blood went from me with every drop of ink I used.Always alert
and listening, I dared not lift my head or turn my eyes at any unusual
sound, lest I should seem to be watching.The third night I had a dream;
I have already told Mr.Raymond what it was, and hence will not repeat
it here.One correction, however, I wish to make in regard to it.In my
statement to him I declared that the face of the man whom I saw lift his
hand against my employer was that of Mr.The face seen by me in my dream was my own.It was that fact
which made it so horrible to me.In the crouching figure stealing warily
down-stairs, I saw as in a glass the vision of my own form.Otherwise my
account of the matter was true.a
forewarning of the way in which I was to win this coveted creature for
my own?Was the death of her uncle the bridge by which the impassable
gulf between us might be spanned?I began to think it might be; to
consider the possibilities which could make this the only path to
my elysium; even went so far as to picture her lovely face bending
gratefully towards me through the glare of a sudden release from some
emergency in which she stood.One thing was sure; if that was the way I
must go, I had at least been taught how to tread it; and all through the
dizzy, blurred day that followed, I saw, as I sat at my work, repeated
visions of that stealthy, purposeful figure stealing down the stairs
and entering with uplifted pistol into the unconscious presence of my
employer.I even found myself a dozen times that day turning my eyes
upon the door through which it was to come, wondering how long it would
be before my actual form would pause there.That the moment was at hand
I did not imagine.Even when I left him that night after drinking with
him the glass of sherry mentioned at the inquest, I had no idea the hour
of action was so near.But when, not three minutes after going upstairs,
I caught the sound of a lady's dress rustling through the hall, and
listening, heard Mary Leavenworth pass my door on her way to the
library, I realized that the fatal hour was come; that something
was going to be said or done in that room which would make this deed
necessary.Casting about in my mind
for the means of doing so, I remembered that the ventilator running
up through the house opened first into the passage-way connecting Mr.Leavenworth's bedroom and library, and, secondly, into the closet of
the large spare room adjoining mine.Hastily unlocking the door of
the communication between the rooms, I took my position in the closet.Instantly the sound of voices reached my ears; all was open below, and
standing there, I was as much an auditor of what went on between Mary
and her uncle as if I were in the library itself.Enough to assure me my suspicions were correct; that it was a moment of
vital interest to her; that Mr.Leavenworth, in pursuance of a threat
evidently made some time since, was in the act of taking steps to change
his will, and that she had come to make an appeal to be forgiven her
fault and restored to his favor.What that fault was, I did not learn.I only heard her
declare that her action had been the result of impulse, rather than
love; that she regretted it, and desired nothing more than to be free
from all obligations to one she would fain forget, and be again to her
uncle what she was before she ever saw this man.I thought, fool that I
was, it was a mere engagement she was alluding to, and took the insanest
hope from these words; and when, in a moment later I heard her uncle
reply, in his sternest tone, that she had irreparably forfeited her
claims to his regard and favor, I did not need her short and bitter cry
of shame and disappointment, or that low moan for some one to help her,
for me to sound his death-knell in my heart.Creeping back to my own
room, I waited till I heard her reascend, then I stole forth.Calm as
I had ever been in my life, I went down the stairs just as I had seen
myself do in my dream, and knocking lightly at the library door, went
in.Leavenworth was sitting in his usual place writing."Excuse me," said I as he looked up, "I have lost my memorandum-book,
and think it possible I may have dropped it in the passage-way when I
went for the wine."He bowed, and I hurried past him into the closet.Once there, I proceeded rapidly into the room beyond, procured the
pistol, returned, and almost before I realized what I was doing, had
taken up my position behind him, aimed, and fired.Without a groan his head fell forward on his hands, and Mary
Leavenworth was the virtual possessor of the thousands she coveted.My first thought was to procure the letter he was writing.Approaching
the table, I tore it out from under his hands, looked at it, saw that
it was, as I expected, a summons to his lawyer, and thrust it into my
pocket, together with the letter from Mr.Clavering, which I perceived
lying spattered with blood on the table before me.Not till this was
done did I think of myself, or remember the echo which that low, sharp
report must have made in the house.Dropping the pistol at the side of
the murdered man, I stood ready to shriek to any one who entered that
Mr.But I was saved from committing such
a folly.The report had not been heard, or if so, had evidently failed
to create an alarm.No one came, and I was left to contemplate my
work undisturbed and decide upon the best course to be taken to avoid
detection.A moment's study of the wound made in his head by the
bullet convinced me of the impossibility of passing the affair off as
a suicide, or even the work of a burglar.To any one versed in such
matters it was manifestly a murder, and a most deliberate one.My one
hope, then, lay in making it as mysterious as it was deliberate, by
destroying all due to the motive and manner of the deed.Picking up the
pistol, I carried it into the other room with the intention of
cleaning it, but finding nothing there to do it with, came back for the
handkerchief I had seen lying on the floor at Mr.It
was Miss Eleanore's, but I did not know it till I had used it to clean
the barrel; then the sight of her initials in one corner so shocked me
I forgot to clean the cylinder, and only thought of how I could do
away with this evidence of her handkerchief having been employed for a
purpose so suspicious.Not daring to carry it from the room, I sought
for means to destroy it; but finding none, compromised the matter by
thrusting it deep down behind the cushion of one of the chairs, in the
hope of being able to recover and burn it the next day.This done, I
reloaded the pistol, locked it up, and prepared to leave the room.But here the horror which usually follows such deeds struck me like a
thunderbolt and made me for the first time uncertain in my action.I
locked the door on going out, something I should never have done.Not
till I reached the top of the stairs did I realize my folly; and then it
was too late, for there before me, candle in hand, and surprise written
on every feature of her face, stood Hannah, one of the servants, looking
at me."Lor, sir, where have you been?"she cried, but strange to say, in a
low tone."You look as if you had seen a ghost."And her eyes turned
suspiciously to the key which I held in my hand.I felt as if some one had clutched me round the throat.Thrusting the
key into my pocket, I took a step towards her."I will tell you what I
have seen if you will come down-stairs," I whispered; "the ladies will
be disturbed if we talk here," and smoothing my brow as best I could,
I put out my hand and drew her towards me.What my motive was I hardly
knew; the action was probably instinctive; but when I saw the look which
came into her face as I touched her, and the alacrity with which she
prepared to follow me, I took courage, remembering the one or two
previous tokens I had had of this girl's unreasonable susceptibility to
my influence; a susceptibility which I now felt could be utilized and
made to serve my purpose.Taking her down to the parlor floor, I drew her into the depths of
the great drawing-room, and there told her in the least alarming
way possible what had happened to Mr.She was of course
intensely agitated, but she did not scream;--the novelty of her position
evidently bewildering her--and, greatly relieved, I went on to say that
I did not know who committed the deed, but that folks would declare it
was I if they knew I had been seen by her on the stairs with the library
key in my hand."But I won't tell," she whispered, trembling violently
in her fright and eagerness.I will say I
didn't see anybody."But I soon convinced her that she could never keep
her secret if the police once began to question her, and, following
up my argument with a little cajolery, succeeded after a long while in
winning her consent to leave the house till the storm should be blown
over.But that given, it was some little time before I could make her
comprehend that she must depart at once and without going back after her
things.Not till I brightened up her wits by a promise to marry her some
day if she only obeyed me now, did she begin to look the thing in
the face and show any evidence of the real mother wit she evidently
possessed.Belden would take me in," said she, "if I could only
get to R----.She takes everybody in who asks, her; and she would
keep me, too, if I told her Miss Mary sent me.But I can't get there
to-night."I immediately set to work to convince her that she could.The midnight
train did not leave the city for a half-hour yet, and the distance to
the depot could be easily walked by her in fifteen minutes.And she was afraid she couldn't find
her way!She still hesitated, but
at length consented to go, and with some further understanding of the
method I was to employ in communicating with her, we went down-stairs.There we found a hat and shawl of the cook's which I put on her, and in
another moment we were in the carriage yard."Remember, you are to say
nothing of what has occurred, no matter what happens," I whispered in
parting injunction as she turned to leave me."Remember, you are to come
and marry me some day," she murmured in reply, throwing her arms about
my neck.The movement was sudden, and it was probably at this time she
dropped the candle she had unconsciously held clenched in her hand till
now.I promised her, and she glided out of the gate.Of the dreadful agitation that followed the disappearance of this girl
I can give no better idea than by saying I not only committed the
additional error of locking up the house on my re-entrance, but omitted
to dispose of the key then in my pocket by flinging it into the street
or dropping it in the hall as I went up.The fact is, I was so absorbed
by the thought of the danger I stood in from this girl, I forgot
everything else.Hannah's pale face, Hannah's look of terror, as she
turned from my side and flitted down the street, were continually before
me.I could not escape them; the form of the dead man lying below was
less vivid.It was as though I were tied in fancy to this woman of the
white face fluttering down the midnight streets.That she would fail in
something--come back or be brought back--that I should find her standing
white and horror-stricken on the front steps when I went down in the
morning, was like a nightmare to me.I began to think no other result
possible; that she never would or could win her way unchallenged to that
little cottage in a distant village; that I had but sent a trailing flag
of danger out into the world with this wretched girl;--danger that would
come back to me with the first burst of morning light!But even those thoughts faded after a while before the realization
of the peril I was in as long as the key and papers remained in my
possession.I dared not leave my room again,
or open my window.Indeed I was
afraid to move about in my room.Yes, my
morbid terror had reached that point--I was fearful of one whose ears I
myself had forever closed, imagined him in his bed beneath and wakeful
to the least sound.But the necessity of doing something with these evidences of guilt
finally overcame this morbid anxiety, and drawing the two letters from
my pocket--I had not yet undressed--I chose out the most dangerous of
the two, that written by Mr.Leavenworth himself, and, chewing it till
it was mere pulp, threw it into a corner; but the other had blood on it,
and nothing, not even the hope of safety, could induce me to put it
to my lips.I was forced to lie with it clenched in my hand, and the
flitting image of Hannah before my eyes, till the slow morning broke.I
have heard it said that a year in heaven seems like a day; I can easily
believe it.I know that an hour in hell seems an eternity!Whether it was that the sunshine glancing
on the wall made me think of Mary and all I was ready to do for her
sake, or whether it was the mere return of my natural stoicism in the
presence of actual necessity, I cannot say.I only know that I arose
calm and master of myself.The problem of the letter and key had solved
itself also.Instead of that I would
put them in plain sight, trusting to that very fact for their being
overlooked.Making the letter up into lighters, I carried them into the
spare room and placed them in a vase.Then, taking the key in my hand,
went down-stairs, intending to insert it in the lock of the library door
as I went by.But Miss Eleanore descending almost immediately behind me
made this impossible.I succeeded, however, in thrusting it, without
her knowledge, among the filagree work of the gas-fixture in the
second hall, and thus relieved, went down into the breakfast room as
self-possessed a man as ever crossed its threshold.Mary was there,
looking exceedingly pale and disheartened, and as I met her eye, which
for a wonder turned upon me as I entered, I could almost have laughed,
thinking of the deliverance that had come to her, and of the time when I
should proclaim myself to be the man who had accomplished it.Of the alarm that speedily followed, and my action at that time and
afterwards, I need not speak in detail.I behaved just as I would have
done if I had had no hand in the murder.I even forbore to touch the key
or go to the spare room, or make any movement which I was not willing
all the world should see.For as things stood, there was not a shadow
of evidence against me in the house; neither was I, a hard-working,
uncomplaining secretary, whose passion for one of his employer's nieces
was not even mistrusted by the lady herself, a person to be suspected
of the crime which threw him out of a fair situation.So I performed
all the duties of my position, summoning the police, and going for Mr.Veeley, just as I would have done if those hours between me leaving
Mr.Leavenworth for the first time and going down to breakfast in the
morning had been blotted from my consciousness.And this was the principle upon which I based my action at the inquest.Leaving that half-hour and its occurrences out of the question, I
resolved to answer such questions as might be put me as truthfully as
I could; the great fault with men situated as I was usually being that
they lied too much, thus committing themselves on unessential matters.But alas, in thus planning for my own safety, I forgot one thing,
and that was the dangerous position in which I should thus place Mary
Leavenworth as the one benefited by the crime.Not till the inference
was drawn by a juror, from the amount of wine found in Mr.Leavenworth's
glass in the morning, that he had come to his death shortly after my
leaving him, did I realize what an opening I had made for suspicion in
her direction by admitting that I had heard a rustle on the stair a few
minutes after going up.That all present believed it to have been made
by Eleanore, did not reassure me.She was so completely disconnected
with the crime I could not imagine suspicion holding to her for an
instant.But Mary--If a curtain had been let down before me, pictured
with the future as it has since developed, I could not have seen more
plainly what her position would be, if attention were once directed
towards her.So, in the vain endeavor to cover up my blunder, I began
to lie.Forced to admit that a shadow of disagreement had been lately
visible between Mr.Leavenworth and one of his nieces, I threw the
burden of it upon Eleanore, as the one best able to bear it.The
consequences were more serious than I anticipated.Direction had been
given to suspicion which every additional evidence that now came up
seemed by some strange fatality to strengthen.Leavenworth's own pistol had been used in the assassination,
and that too by a person then in the house, but I myself was brought
to acknowledge that Eleanore had learned from me, only a little while
before, how to load, aim, and fire this very pistol--a coincidence
mischievous enough to have been of the devil's own making.Seeing all this, my fear of what the ladies would admit when questioned
became very great.Let them in their innocence acknowledge that, upon my
ascent, Mary had gone to her uncle's room for the purpose of persuading
him not to carry into effect the action he contemplated, and what
consequences might not ensue!But events of which I had at that time no knowledge had occurred to
influence them.Eleanore, with some show of reason, as it seems, not
only suspected her cousin of the crime, but had informed her of the
fact, and Mary, overcome with terror at finding there was more or
less circumstantial evidence supporting the suspicion, decided to deny
whatever told against herself, trusting to Eleanore's generosity not to
be contradicted.Though, by the course
she took, Eleanore was forced to deepen the prejudice already rife
against herself, she not only forbore to contradict her cousin, but when
a true answer would have injured her, actually refused to return any,
a lie being something she could not utter, even to save one especially
endeared to her.This conduct of hers had one effect upon me.It aroused my admiration
and made me feel that here was a woman worth helping if assistance could
be given without danger to myself.Yet I doubt if my sympathy would have
led me into doing anything, if I had not perceived, by the stress laid
upon certain well-known matters, that actual danger hovered about us
all while the letter and key remained in the house.Even before the
handkerchief was produced, I had made up my mind to attempt their
destruction; but when that was brought up and shown, I became so alarmed
I immediately rose and, making my way under some pretence or other to
the floors above, snatched the key from the gas-fixture, the
lighters from the vase, and hastening with them down the hall to Mary
Leavenworth's room, went in under the expectation of finding a fire
there in which to destroy them.But, to my heavy disappointment, there
were only a few smoldering ashes in the grate, and, thwarted in my
design, I stood hesitating what to do, when I heard some one coming
up-stairs.Alive to the consequences of being found in that room at that
time, I cast the lighters into the grate and started for the door.But
in the quick move I made, the key flew from my hand and slid under a
chair.Aghast at the mischance, I paused, but the sound of approaching
steps increasing, I lost all control over myself and fled from the room.I had barely reached my own door when
Eleanore Leavenworth, followed by two servants, appeared at the top of
the staircase and proceeded towards the room I had just left.The sight
reassured me; she would see the key, and take some means of disposing
of it; and indeed I always supposed her to have done so, for no further
word of key or letter ever came to my ears.This may explain why the
questionable position in which Eleanore soon found herself awakened in
me no greater anxiety.I thought the suspicions of the police rested
upon nothing more tangible than the peculiarity of her manner at the
inquest and the discovery of her handkerchief on the scene of the
tragedy.I did not know they possessed what might be called absolute
proof of her connection with the crime.But if I had, I doubt if my
course would have been any different.Mary's peril was the one thing
capable of influencing me, and she did not appear to be in peril.On the
contrary, every one, by common consent, seemed to ignore all appearance
of guilt on her part.Gryce, whom I soon learned to fear, had
given one sign of suspicion, or Mr.Raymond, whom I speedily recognized
as my most persistent though unconscious foe, had betrayed the least
distrust of her, I should have taken warning.But they did not, and,
lulled into a false security by their manner, I let the days go by
without suffering any fears on her account.But not without many
anxieties for myself.Hannah's existence precluded all sense of personal
security.Knowing the determination of the police to find her, I trod
the verge of an awful suspense continually.Meantime the wretched certainty was forcing itself upon me that I had
lost, instead of gained, a hold on Mary Leavenworth.Not only did she
evince the utmost horror of the deed which had made her mistress of
her uncle's wealth, but, owing, as I believed, to the influence of Mr.Raymond, soon gave evidence that she was losing, to a certain extent,
the characteristics of mind and heart which had made me hopeful of
winning her by this deed of blood.Under the terrible restraint forced upon me, I walked my weary
round in a state of mind bordering on frenzy.Many and many a time have
I stopped in my work, wiped my pen and laid it down with the idea that
I could not repress myself another moment, but I have always taken it
up again and gone on with my task.Raymond has sometimes shown his
wonder at my sitting in my dead employer's chair.By keeping the murder constantly before my mind, I
was enabled to restrain myself from any inconsiderate action.At last there came a time when my agony could be no longer suppressed.Raymond, I saw a strange
gentleman standing in the reception room, looking at Mary Leavenworth
in a way that would have made my blood boil, even if I had not heard him
whisper these words: "But you are my wife, and know it, whatever you may
say or do!"It was the lightning-stroke of my life.After what I had done to make
her mine, to hear another claim her as already his own, was stunning,
maddening!I had either to yell in
my fury or deal the man beneath some tremendous blow in my hatred.I did
not dare to shriek, so I struck the blow.Raymond, and hearing that it was, as I expected, Clavering, I flung
caution, reason, common sense, all to the winds, and in a moment of fury
denounced him as the murderer of Mr.The next instant I would have given worlds to recall my words.What had
I done but drawn attention to myself in thus accusing a man against whom
nothing could of course be proved!So, after a night of thought, I did the next best thing: gave a
superstitious reason for my action, and so restored myself to my former
position without eradicating from the mind of Mr.Raymond that vague
doubt of the man which my own safety demanded.But I had no intention of
going any further, nor should I have done so if I had not observed that
for some reason Mr.But
that once seen, revenge took possession of me, and I asked myself if the
burden of this crime could be thrown on this man.Still I do not believe
that any active results would have followed this self-questioning if I
had not overheard a whispered conversation between two of the servants,
in which I learned that Mr.Clavering had been seen to enter the
house on the night of the murder, but was not seen to leave it.With such a fact for a starting-point, what might I not
hope to accomplish?While she remained
alive I saw nothing but ruin before me.I made up my mind to destroy
her and satisfy my hatred of Mr.By what
means could I reach her without deserting my post, or make away with
her without exciting fresh suspicion?The problem seemed insolvable;
but Trueman Harwell had not played the part of a machine so long without
result.Before I had studied the question a day, light broke upon it,
and I saw that the only way to accomplish my plans was to inveigle her
into destroying herself.No sooner had this thought matured than I hastened to act upon it.Knowing the tremendous risk I ran, I took every precaution.Locking
myself up in my room, I wrote her a letter in printed characters--she
having distinctly told me she could not read writing--in which I played
upon her ignorance, foolish fondness, and Irish superstition, by telling
her I dreamed of her every night and wondered if she did of me; was
afraid she didn't, so enclosed her a little charm, which, if she would
use according to directions, would give her the most beautiful visions.These directions were for her first to destroy my letter by burning it,
next to take in her hand the packet I was careful to enclose, swallow
the powder accompanying it, and go to bed.The powder was a deadly dose
of poison and the packet was, as you know, a forged confession falsely
criminating Henry Clavering.Enclosing all these in an envelope in
the corner of which I had marked a cross, I directed it, according to
agreement, to Mrs.Then followed the greatest period of suspense I had yet endured.Though
I had purposely refrained from putting my name to the letter, I felt
that the chances of detection were very great.Let her depart in the
least particular from the course I had marked out for her, and fatal
results must ensue.If she opened the enclosed packet, mistrusted the
powder, took Mrs.Belden into her confidence, or even failed to burn my
letter, all would be lost.I could not be sure of her or know the result
of my scheme except through the newspapers.Do you think I kept watch
of the countenances about me?devoured the telegraphic news, or started
when the bell rang?And when, a few days since, I read that short
paragraph in the paper which assured me that my efforts had at least
produced the death of the woman I feared, do you think I experienced any
sense of relief?In six hours had come the summons from Mr.Gryce,

no longer capable of speech or action.THE OUTCOME OF A GREAT CRIME


    "Leave her to Heaven
    And to those thorns that
    In her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her."--Hamlet

    "For she is wise, if I can judge of her;
    And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true;
    And true she is, as she has proved herself;
    And therefore like herself, wise, fair, and true,
    Shall she be placed in my constant soul."I cried, as I made my way into her presence, "are you
prepared for very good news?News that will brighten these pale cheeks
and give the light back to these eyes, and make life hopeful and sweet
to you once more?Tell me," I urged, stooping over her where she sat,
for she looked ready to faint."I don't know," she faltered; "I fear your idea of good news and mine
may differ.No news can be good but----"

"What?"I asked, taking her hands in mine with a smile that ought to
have reassured her, it was one of such profound happiness."Tell me; do
not be afraid."Her dreadful burden had lain upon her so long it had become
a part of her being.How could she realize it was founded on a mistake;
that she had no cause to fear the past, present, or future?But when the truth was made known to her; when, with all the fervor and
gentle tact of which I was capable, I showed her that her suspicions had
been groundless, and that Trueman Harwell, and not Mary, was accountable
for the evidences of crime which had led her into attributing to her
cousin the guilt of her uncle's death, her first words were a prayer to
be taken to the one she had so wronged.I cannot breathe or think till I have begged pardon of her on my
knees.Seeing the state she was in, I deemed it wise to humor her.So,
procuring a carriage, I drove with her to her cousin's home."Mary will spurn me; she will not even look at me; and she will be
right!"she cried, as we rolled away up the avenue."An outrage like
this can never be forgiven.But God knows I thought myself justified in
my suspicions.If you knew--"

"I do know," I interposed."Mary acknowledges that the circumstantial
evidence against her was so overwhelming, she was almost staggered
herself, asking if she could be guiltless with such proofs against her.But----"

"Wait, oh, wait; did Mary say that?"I did not answer; I wanted her to see for herself the extent of that
change.But when, in a few minutes later, the carriage stopped and I
hurried with her into the house which had been the scene of so much
misery, I was hardly prepared for the difference in her own countenance
which the hall light revealed.Her eyes were bright, her cheeks were
brilliant, her brow lifted and free from shadow; so quickly does the ice
of despair melt in the sunshine of hope.Thomas, who had opened the door, was sombrely glad to see his mistress
again."Miss Leavenworth is in the drawing-room," said he.I nodded, then seeing that Eleanore could scarcely move for agitation,
asked her whether she would go in at once, or wait till she was more
composed."I will go in at once; I cannot wait."And slipping from my grasp, she
crossed the hall and laid her hand upon the drawing-room curtain, when
it was suddenly lifted from within and Mary stepped out.I did not need to glance their
way to know that Eleanore had fallen at her cousin's feet, and that
her cousin had affrightedly lifted her.I did not need to hear: "My sin
against you is too great; you cannot forgive me!"followed by the low:
"My shame is great enough to lead me to forgive anything!"to know that
the lifelong shadow between these two had dissolved like a cloud, and
that, for the future, bright days of mutual confidence and sympathy were
in store.Yet when, a half-hour or so later, I heard the door of the reception
room, into which I had retired, softly open, and looking up, saw Mary
standing on the threshold, with the light of true humility on her face,
I own that I was surprised at the softening which had taken place in
her haughty beauty."Blessed is the shame that purifies," I inwardly
murmured, and advancing, held out my hand with a respect and sympathy I
never thought to feel for her again.Blushing deeply, she came and stood by
my side."I have much to be grateful for; how
much I never realized till to-night; but I cannot speak of it now.What
I wish is for you to come in and help me persuade Eleanore to accept
this fortune from my hands.It is hers, you know; was willed to her, or
would have been if--"

"Wait," said I, in the trepidation which this appeal to me on such a
subject somehow awakened.Is it your
determined purpose to transfer your fortune into your cousin's hands?"Her look was enough without the low, "Ah, how can you ask me?"Clavering was sitting by the side of Eleanore when we entered the
drawing-room.He immediately rose, and drawing me to one side, earnestly
said:

"Before the courtesies of the hour pass between us, Mr.Raymond, allow
me to tender you my apology.You have in your possession a document
which ought never to have been forced upon you.Founded upon a mistake,
the act was an insult which I bitterly regret.If, in consideration of
my mental misery at that time, you can pardon it, I shall feel forever
indebted to you; if not----"

"Mr.The occurrences of that day belong to
a past which I, for one, have made up my mind to forget as soon as
possible.The future promises too richly for us to dwell on bygone
miseries."And with a look of mutual understanding and friendship we hastened to
rejoin the ladies.Of the conversation that followed, it is only necessary to state the
result.Eleanore, remaining firm in her refusal to accept property so
stained by guilt, it was finally agreed upon that it should be devoted
to the erection and sustainment of some charitable institution of
magnitude sufficient to be a recognized benefit to the city and its
unfortunate poor.This settled, our thoughts returned to our friends,
especially to Mr."He has grieved like a father over us."And, in her spirit of penitence, she would have undertaken the unhappy
task of telling him the truth.But Eleanore, with her accustomed generosity, would not hear of this."No, Mary," said she; "you have suffered enough.And leaving them there, with the light of growing hope and confidence on
their faces, we went out again into the night, and so into a dream from
which I have never waked, though the shine of her dear eyes have been
now the load-star of my life for many happy, happy months.The
clouds also of smoke were dismal, and reached, upon computation, near
fifty miles in length.Thus, I left it this afternoon burning, a
resemblance of Sodom, or the last day.It forcibly called to my mind
that passage--"_non enim hic habemus stabilem civitatem_"; the ruins
resembling the picture of Troy.The burning still rages, and it is now gotten as
far as the Inner Temple.All Fleet street, the Old Bailey, Ludgate hill,
Warwick lane, Newgate, Paul's chain, Watling street, now flaming, and
most of it reduced to ashes; the stones of Paul's flew like grenados,
the melting lead running down the streets in a stream, and the very
pavements glowing with fiery redness, so as no horse, nor man, was able
to tread on them, and the demolition had stopped all the passages, so
that no help could be applied.The eastern wind still more impetuously
driving the flames forward.Nothing but the Almighty power of God was
able to stop them; for vain was the help of man.the confusion
there was then at that Court!It pleased his Majesty to command me,
among the rest, to look after the quenching of Fetter-lane end, to
preserve (if possible) that part of Holborn, while the rest of the
gentlemen took their several posts, some at one part, and some at
another (for now they began to bestir themselves, and not till now, who
hitherto had stood as men intoxicated, with their hands across), and
began to consider that nothing was likely to put a stop but the blowing
up of so many houses as might make a wider gap than any had yet been
made by the ordinary method of pulling them down with engines.This some
stout seamen proposed early enough to have saved near the whole city,
but this some tenacious and avaricious men, aldermen, etc., would not
permit, because their houses must have been of the first.It was,
therefore, now commended to be practiced; and my concern being
particularly for the Hospital of St.Bartholomew, near Smithfield, where
I had many wounded and sick men, made me the more diligent to promote
it; nor was my care for the Savoy less.It now pleased God, by abating
the wind, and by the industry of the people, when almost all was lost
infusing a new spirit into them, that the fury of it began sensibly to
abate about noon, so as it came no farther than the Temple westward, nor
than the entrance of Smithfield, north: but continued all this day and
night so impetuous toward Cripplegate and the Tower, as made us all
despair.It also broke out again in the temple; but the courage of the
multitude persisting, and many houses being blown up, such gaps and
desolations were soon made, as, with the former three days' consumption,
the back fire did not so vehemently urge upon the rest as formerly.There was yet no standing near the burning and glowing ruins by near a
furlong's space.The coal and wood wharfs, and magazines of oil, rosin, etc., did
infinite mischief, so as the invective which a little before I had
dedicated to his Majesty and published,[5] giving warning what probably
might be the issue of suffering those shops to be in the city was looked
upon as a prophecy.[Footnote 5: The _Fumifugium_.]George's Fields, and
Moorfields, as far as Highgate, and several miles in circle, some under
tents, some under miserable huts and hovels, many without a rag, or any
necessary utensils, bed or board, who from delicateness, riches, and
easy accommodations in stately and well-furnished houses, were now
reduced to extreme misery and poverty.In this calamitous condition, I returned with a sad heart to my house,
blessing and adoring the distinguishing mercy of God to me and mine,
who, in the midst of all this ruin, was like Lot, in my little Zoar,
safe and sound.I represented to his Majesty the case of
the French prisoners at war in my custody, and besought him that there
might be still the same care of watching at all places contiguous to
unseized houses.It is not indeed imaginable how extraordinary the
vigilance and activity of the King and the Duke was, even laboring in
person, and being present to command, order, reward, or encourage
workmen; by which he showed his affection to his people, and gained
theirs.Having, then, disposed of some under cure at the Savoy, I
returned to Whitehall, where I dined at Mr.Offley's, the groom-porter,
who was my relation.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1666.I went this morning on foot from Whitehall as far
as London Bridge, through the late Fleet street, Ludgate hill by St.Paul's, Cheapside, Exchange, Bishops-gate, Aldersgate, and out to
Moorfields, thence through Cornhill, etc., with extraordinary
difficulty, clambering over heaps of yet smoking rubbish, and frequently
mistaking where I was; the ground under my feet so hot, that it even
burnt the soles of my shoes.In the meantime, his Majesty got to the
Tower by water, to demolish the houses about the graff, which, being
built entirely about it, had they taken fire and attacked the White
Tower, where the magazine of powder lay, would undoubtedly not only have
beaten down and destroyed all the bridge, but sunk and torn the vessels
in the river, and rendered the demolition beyond all expression for
several miles about the country.At my return, I was infinitely concerned to find that goodly Church,
St.Paul's--now a sad ruin, and that beautiful portico (for structure
comparable to any in Europe, as not long before repaired by the late
King) now rent in pieces, flakes of large stones split asunder, and
nothing remaining entire but the inscription in the architrave showing
by whom it was built, which had not one letter of it defaced!It was
astonishing to see what immense stones the heat had in a manner
calcined, so that all the ornaments, columns, friezes, capitals, and
projectures of massy Portland stone, flew off, even to the very roof,
where a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less than six acres by
measure) was totally melted.The ruins of the vaulted roof falling,
broke into St.Faith's, which being filled with the magazines of books
belonging to the Stationers, and carried thither for safety, they were
all consumed, burning for a week following.It is also observable that
the lead over the altar at the east end was untouched, and among the
divers monuments the body of one bishop remained entire.Thus lay in
ashes that most venerable church, one of the most ancient pieces of
early piety in the Christian world, besides near one hundred more.The
lead, ironwork, bells, plate, etc., melted, the exquisitely wrought
Mercers' Chapel, the sumptuous Exchange, the august fabric of Christ
Church, all the rest of the Companies' Halls, splendid buildings,
arches, entries, all in dust; the fountains dried up and ruined, while
the very waters remained boiling; the voragos of subterranean cellars,
wells, and dungeons, formerly warehouses, still burning in stench and
dark clouds of smoke; so that in five or six miles traversing about I
did not see one load of timber unconsumed, nor many stones but what were
calcined white as snow.The people, who now walked about the ruins, appeared like men in some
dismal desert, or rather, in some great city laid waste by a cruel
enemy; to which was added the stench that came from some poor creatures'
bodies, beds, and other combustible goods.Sir Thomas Gresham's statue,
though fallen from its niche in the Royal Exchange, remained entire,
when all those of the Kings since the Conquest were broken to pieces.Also the standard in Cornhill, and Queen Elizabeth's effigies, with some
arms on Ludgate, continued with but little detriment, while the vast
iron chains of the city streets, hinges, bars, and gates of prisons,
were many of them melted and reduced to cinders by the vehement heat.Nor was I yet able to pass through any of the narrow streets, but kept
the widest; the ground and air, smoke and fiery vapor, continued so
intense, that my hair was almost singed, and my feet insufferably
surbated.The by-lanes and narrow streets were quite filled up with
rubbish; nor could one have possibly known where he was, but by the
ruins of some Church, or Hall, that had some remarkable tower, or
pinnacle remaining.I then went towards Islington and Highgate, where one might have seen
200,000 people of all ranks and degrees dispersed, and lying along by
their heaps of what they could save from the fire, deploring their loss;
and, though ready to perish for hunger and destitution, yet not asking
one penny for relief, which to me appeared a stranger sight than any I
had yet beheld.His Majesty and Council indeed took all imaginable care
for their relief, by proclamation for the country to come in, and
refresh them with provisions.In the midst of all this calamity and confusion, there was, I know not
how, an alarm begun that the French and Dutch, with whom we were now in
hostility, were not only landed, but even entering the city.There was,
in truth, some days before, great suspicion of those two nations
joining; and now that they had been the occasion of firing the town.This report did so terrify, that on a sudden there was such an uproar
and tumult that they ran from their goods, and, taking what weapons they
could come at, they could not be stopped from falling on some of those
nations whom they casually met, without sense or reason.The clamor and
peril grew so excessive, that it made the whole Court amazed, and they
did with infinite pains and great difficulty, reduce and appease the
people, sending troops of soldiers and guards, to cause them to retire
into the fields again, where they were watched all this night.I left
them pretty quiet, and came home sufficiently weary and broken.Their
spirits thus a little calmed, and the affright abated, they now began to
repair into the suburbs about the city, where such as had friends, or
opportunity, got shelter for the present to which his Majesty's
proclamation also invited them.Still, the plague continuing in our parish, I could not, without danger,
adventure to our church.I went again to the ruins; for it was now no
longer a city.I presented his Majesty with a survey of the
ruins, and a plot for a new city, with a discourse on it; whereupon,
after dinner, his Majesty sent for me into the Queen's bed-chamber, her
Majesty and the Duke only being present.They examined each particular,
and discoursed on them for near an hour, seeming to be extremely pleased
with what I had so early thought on.The Queen was now in her cavalier
riding-habit, hat and feather, and horseman's coat, going to take the
air.Plume
preached very well from this text: "Seeing, then, all these things shall
be dissolved," etc.: taking occasion from the late unparalleled
conflagration to remind us how we ought to walk more holy in all manner
of conversation.Dined at Sir William D'Oyly's, with that worthy
gentleman, Sir John Holland, of Suffolk.This day was ordered a general Fast through the
Nation, to humble us on the late dreadful conflagration, added to the
plague and war, the most dismal judgments that could be inflicted; but
which indeed we highly deserved for our prodigious ingratitude, burning
lusts, dissolute court, profane and abominable lives, under such
dispensations of God's continued favor in restoring Church, Prince, and
People from our late intestine calamities, of which we were altogether
unmindful, even to astonishment.This made me resolve to go to our
parish assembly, where our Doctor preached on Luke xix.41: piously
applying it to the occasion.After which, was a collection for the
distressed losers in the late fire.It being the first time his Majesty put
himself solemnly into the Eastern fashion of vest, changing doublet,
stiff collar, bands and cloak, into a comely dress, after the Persian
mode, with girdles or straps, and shoestrings and garters into buckles,
of which some were set with precious stones[6] resolving never to alter
it, and to leave the French mode, which had hitherto obtained to our
great expense and reproach.Upon which, divers courtiers and gentlemen
gave his Majesty gold by way of wager that he would not persist in this
resolution.I had sometime before presented an invective against that
unconstancy, and our so much affecting the French fashion, to his
Majesty; in which I took occasion to describe the comeliness and
usefulness of the Persian clothing, in the very same manner his Majesty
now clad himself.This pamphlet I entitled "_Tyrannus, or the Mode_,"
and gave it to the King to read.I do not impute to this discourse the
change which soon happened, but it was an identity that I could not but
take notice of.[Footnote 6: This costume was shortly after abandoned, and laid
    aside; nor does any existing portrait exhibit the King so
    accoutered.]This night was acted my Lord Broghill's tragedy, called "_Mustapha_,"
before their Majesties at Court, at which I was present; very seldom
going to the public theatres for many reasons now, as they were abused
to an atheistical liberty; foul and indecent women now (and never till
now) permitted to appear and act, who inflaming several young noblemen
and gallants, became their misses, and to some, their wives.Witness the
Earl of Oxford, Sir R. Howard, Prince Rupert, the Earl of Dorset, and
another greater person than any of them, who fell into their snares, to
the reproach of their noble families, and ruin of both body and soul.[7]
I was invited by my Lord Chamberlain to see this tragedy, exceedingly
well written, though in my mind I did not approve of any such pastime in
a time of such judgments and calamities.[Footnote 7: Among the principal offenders here aimed at were Mrs.Uphill,
    Mrs.Davenport (Roxolana) was "my Lord
    Oxford's Miss;" Mrs.Uphill was the actress alluded to in connection
    with Sir R. Howard; Mrs.Hughes ensnared Prince Rupert; and the last
    of the "misses" referred to by Evelyn was Nell Gwynne.]This season, after so long and extraordinary a
drought in August and September, as if preparatory for the dreadful
fire, was so very wet and rainy as many feared an ensuing famine.The pestilence, through God's mercy, began now to
abate considerably in our town.[Sidenote: LONDON]

30th October, 1666.To London to our office, and now had I on the vest
and surcoat, or tunic, as it was called, after his Majesty had brought
the whole court to it.It was a comely and manly habit, too good to
hold, it being impossible for us in good earnest to leave the Monsieurs'
vanities long.I heard the signal cause of my Lord Cleveland
pleaded before the House of Lords; and was this day forty-six years of
age, wonderfully protected by the mercies of God, for which I render him
immortal thanks.I went my winter circle through my district,
Rochester and other places, where I had men quartered, and in custody.I mustered the prisoners, being about 600 Dutch and
French, ordered their proportion of bread to be augmented and provided
clothes and fuel.Monsieur Colbert, Ambassador at the Court of England,
this day sent money from his master, the French King, to every prisoner
of that nation under my guard.I returned to Chatham, my chariot overturning on
the steep of Bexley Hill, wounded me in two places on the head; my son,
Jack, being with me, was like to have been worse cut by the glass; but I
thank God we both escaped without much hurt, though not without
exceeding danger.At London, I heard an extraordinary case before a
Committee of the whole House of Commons, in the Commons' House of
Parliament, between one Captain Taylor and my Lord Viscount Mordaunt,
where, after the lawyers had pleaded and the witnesses been examined,
such foul and dishonorable things were produced against his Lordship, of
tyranny during his government of Windsor Castle, of which he was
Constable, incontinence, and suborning witnesses (of which last, one Sir
Richard Breames was most concerned), that I was exceedingly interested
for his Lordship, who was my special friend, and husband of the most
virtuous lady in the world.We sat till near ten at night, and yet but
half the counsel had done on behalf of the plaintiff.The question then
was put for bringing in of lights to sit longer.This lasted so long
before it was determined, and raised such a confused noise among the
members, that a stranger would have been astonished at it.I admire that
there is not a rationale to regulate such trifling accidents, which
consume much time, and is a reproach to the gravity of so great an
assembly of sober men.Sir Hugh Pollard, Comptroller of the Household,
died at Whitehall, and his Majesty conferred the white staff on my
brother Commissioner for sick and wounded, Sir Thomas Clifford, a bold
young gentleman, of a small fortune in Devon, but advanced by Lord
Arlington, Secretary of State, to the great astonishment of all the
Court.This gentleman was somewhat related to me by the marriage of his
mother to my nearest kinsman, Gregory Coale, and was ever my noble
friend, a valiant and daring person, but by no means fit for a supple
and flattering courtier.Went to see Clarendon House, now almost finished, a
goodly pile to see, but had many defects as to the architecture, yet
placed most gracefully.After this, I waited on the Lord Chancellor, who
was now at Berkshire House, since the burning of London.Dined with me Monsieur Kiviet, a Dutch
gentleman-pensioner of Rotterdam, who came over for protection, being of
the Prince of Orange's party, now not welcome in Holland.The King
knighted him for some merit in the Prince's behalf.He should, if
caught, have been beheaded with Monsieur Buat, and was brother-in-law to
Van Tromp, the sea-general.Williamson, secretary to Lord Arlington; M. Kiviet came to examine
whether the soil about the river of Thames would be proper to make
clinker bricks, and to treat with me about some accommodation in order
to it.To the Royal Society, which since the sad
conflagration were invited by Mr.Howard to sit at Arundel-House in the
Strand, who at my instigation likewise bestowed on the Society that
noble library which his grandfather especially, and his ancestors had
collected.This gentleman had so little inclination to books, that it
was the preservation of them from embezzlement.Visited my Lord Clarendon, and presented my son,
John, to him, now preparing to go to Oxford, of which his Lordship was
Chancellor.This evening I heard rare Italian voices, two eunuchs and
one woman, in his Majesty's green chamber, next his cabinet.[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th January, 1667.To London, in order to my son's Oxford journey, who,
being very early entered both in Latin and Greek, and prompt to learn
beyond most of his age, I was persuaded to trust him under the tutorage
of Mr.Bohun, Fellow of New College, who had been his preceptor in my
house some years before; but, at Oxford, under the inspection of Dr.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, where I placed him, not as yet
thirteen years old.[8]

    [Footnote 8: In illustration of the garb which succeeded the "long
    coats" out of which lads of twelve or thirteen were thus suffered to
    emerge, it may be mentioned that there hung, some years ago, and
    perhaps may hang still, upon the walls of the Swan Inn at
    Leatherhead in Surrey, a picture of four children, dates of birth
    between 1640 and 1650, of whom a lad of about the age of young
    Evelyn is represented in a coat reaching to his ankles.]My little book, in answer to Sir George Mackenzie
on Solitude, was now published, entitled "Public Employment, and an
active Life with its Appanages, preferred to Solitude."[9]

    [Footnote 9: Reprinted in "Miscellaneous Writings," pp.In
    a letter to Cowley, 12th March, 1666, Evelyn apologises for having
    written against that life which he had joined with Mr.Cowley in so
    much admiring, assuring him he neither was nor could be serious in
    avowing such a preference.]I was present at a magnificent ball, or masque, in
the theatre at the Court, where their Majesties and all the great lords
and ladies danced, infinitely gallant, the men in their richly
embroidered, most becoming vests.In the afternoon, I
witnessed a wrestling match for L1,000 in St.James's Park, before his
Majesty, a vast assemblage of lords and other spectators, between the
western and northern men, Mr.Secretary Morice and Lord Gerard being the
judges.I proposed to my Lord Chancellor, Monsieur Kiviet's
undertaking to wharf the whole river of Thames, or quay, from the Temple
to the Tower, as far as the fire destroyed, with brick, without piles,
both lasting and ornamental.--Great frosts, snow and winds, prodigious
at the vernal equinox; indeed it had been a year of prodigies in this
nation, plague, war, fire, rain, tempest and comet.Saw "The Virgin Queen,"[10] a play written by Mr.[Footnote 10: The VIRGIN QUEEN which Evelyn saw was Dryden's MAIDEN
    QUEEN.Pepys saw it on the night of its first production (twelve
    days before Evelyn's visit); and was charmed by Nell Gwynne's
    Florimell."So great a performance of a comical part was never, I
    believe, in the world before."]Secretary Morice's, who showed me his
library, which was a well chosen collection.This afternoon, I had
audience of his Majesty, concerning the proposal I had made of building
the quay.Sir John Kiviet dined with me.We went to search for
brick-earth, in order to a great undertaking.The cold so intense, that there was hardly a leaf on a
tree.I went to make court to the Duke and Duchess of
Newcastle, at their house in Clerkenwell, being newly come out of the
north.They received me with great kindness, and I was much pleased with
the extraordinary fanciful habit, garb, and discourse of the Duchess.Saw the sumptuous supper in the banqueting-house at
Whitehall, on the eve of St.George's day, where were all the companions
of the Order of the Garter.In the morning, his Majesty went to chapel with the
Knights of the Garter, all in their habits and robes, ushered by the
heralds; after the first service, they went in procession, the youngest
first, the Sovereign last, with the Prelate of the Order and Dean, who
had about his neck the book of the Statutes of the Order; and then the
Chancellor of the Order (old Sir Henry de Vic), who wore the purse about
his neck; then the Heralds and Garter King-at-Arms, Clarencieux, Black
Rod.But before the Prelate and Dean of Windsor went the gentlemen of
the chapel and choristers, singing as they marched; behind them two
doctors of music in damask robes; this procession was about the courts
at Whitehall.Then, returning to their stalls and seats in the chapel,
placed under each knight's coat-armor and titles, the second service
began.Then, the King offered at the altar, an anthem was sung; then,
the rest of the Knights offered, and lastly proceeded to the
banqueting-house to a great feast.The King sat on an elevated throne at
the upper end at a table alone; the Knights at a table on the right
hand, reaching all the length of the room; over against them a cupboard
of rich gilded plate; at the lower end, the music; on the balusters
above, wind music, trumpets, and kettle-drums.The King was served by
the lords and pensioners who brought up the dishes.About the middle of
the dinner, the Knights drank the King's health, then the King, theirs,
when the trumpets and music played and sounded, the guns going off at
the Tower.At the Banquet, came in the Queen, and stood by the King's
left hand, but did not sit.Then was the banqueting-stuff flung about
the room profusely.In truth, the crowd was so great, that though I
stayed all the supper the day before, I now stayed no longer than this
sport began, for fear of disorder.The cheer was extraordinary, each
Knight having forty dishes to his mess, piled up five or six high; the
room hung with the richest tapestry.Visited again the Duke of Newcastle, with whom I had
been acquainted long before in France, where the Duchess had obligation
to my wife's mother for her marriage there; she was sister to Lord
Lucas, and maid of honor then to the Queen-Mother; married in our chapel
at Paris.My wife being with me, the Duke and Duchess both would needs
bring her to the very Court.My Lord Chancellor showed me all his newly finished
and furnished palace and library; then, we went to take the air in
Hyde-Park.I had a great deal of discourse with his Majesty at
dinner.In the afternoon, I went again with my wife to the Duchess of
Newcastle, who received her in a kind of transport, suitable to her
extravagant humor and dress, which was very singular.Made up accounts with our Receiver, which amounted to
L33,936 1s.Dined at Lord Cornbury's, with Don Francisco de Melos,
Portugal Ambassador, and kindred to the Queen: Of the party were Mr.Henry Jermyn and Sir Henry Capel.Afterward I went to Arundel House, to
salute Mr.Howard's sons, newly returned out of France.[Sidenote: LONDON]

11th May, 1667.To London; dined with the Duke of Newcastle, and sat
discoursing with her Grace in her bedchamber after dinner, till my Lord
Marquis of Dorchester, with other company came in, when I went away.To London, to wait on the Duchess of Newcastle (who was
a mighty pretender to learning, poetry, and philosophy, and had in both
published divers books) to the Royal Society, whither she came in great
pomp, and being received by our Lord President at the door of our
meeting-room, the mace, etc., carried before him, had several
experiments shown to her.I conducted her Grace to her coach, and
returned home.I went to Greenwich, where his Majesty was trying divers
grenadoes shot out of cannon at the Castlehill, from the house in the
park; they broke not till they hit the mark, the forged ones broke not
at all, but the cast ones very well.At the same time, a ring was shown to the King, pretended to be
a projection of mercury, and malleable, and said by the gentlemen to be
fixed by the juice of a plant.To London, alarmed by the Dutch, who were fallen on our
fleet at Chatham, by a most audacious enterprise, entering the very
river with part of their fleet, doing us not only disgrace, but
incredible mischief in burning several of our best men-of-war lying at
anchor and moored there, and all this through our unaccountable
negligence in not setting out our fleet in due time.This alarm caused
me, fearing the enemy might venture up the Thames even to London (which
they might have done with ease, and fired all the vessels in the river,
too), to send away my best goods, plate, etc., from my house to another
place.The alarm was so great that it put both country and city into
fear, panic, and consternation, such as I hope I shall never see more;
everybody was flying, none knew why or whither.Now, there were land
forces dispatched with the Duke of Albemarle, Lord Middleton, Prince
Rupert, and the Duke, to hinder the Dutch coming to Chatham, fortifying
Upnor Castle, and laying chains and bombs; but the resolute enemy broke
through all, and set fire on our ships, and retreated in spite, stopping
up the Thames, the rest of the fleet lying before the mouth of it.I went to see the work at Woolwich, a battery to
prevent them coming up to London, which Prince Rupert commanded, and
sunk some ships in the river.This night, about two o'clock, some chips and
combustible matter prepared for some fire-ships, taking flame in
Deptford-yard, made such a blaze, and caused such an uproar in the Tower
(it being given out that the Dutch fleet was come up, and had landed
their men and fired the Tower), as had liked to have done more mischief
before people would be persuaded to the contrary and believe the
accident.The Dutch fleet still continuing to stop up the river,
so as nothing could stir out or come in, I was before the Council, and
commanded by his Majesty to go with some others and search about the
environs of the city, now exceedingly distressed for want of fuel,
whether there could be any peat, or turf, found fit for use.The next
day, I went and discovered enough, and made my report that there might
be found a great deal; but nothing further was done in it.[Sidenote: CHATHAM]

28th June, 1667.I went to Chatham, and thence to view not only what
mischief the Dutch had done; but how triumphantly their whole fleet lay
within the very mouth of the Thames, all from the North Foreland,
Margate, even to the buoy of the Nore--a dreadful spectacle as ever
Englishmen saw, and a dishonor never to be wiped off!Those who advised
his Majesty to prepare no fleet this spring deserved--I know
what--but[11]--

    [Footnote 11: "The Parliament giving but weak supplies for the war,
    the King, to save charges, is persuaded by the Chancellor, the Lord
    Treasurer, Southampton, the Duke of Albemarle, and the other
    ministers, to lay up the first and second-rate ships, and make only
    a defensive war in the next campaign.The Duke of York opposed this,
    but was overruled."Here in the river off Chatham, just before the town, lay the carcase of
the "London" (now the third time burnt), the "Royal Oak," the "James,"
etc., yet smoking; and now, when the mischief was done, we were making
trifling forts on the brink of the river.Here were yet forces, both of
horse and foot, with General Middleton continually expecting the motions
of the enemy's fleet.I had much discourse with him, who was an
experienced commander, I told him I wondered the King did not fortify
Sheerness[12] and the Ferry; both abandoned.Called upon my Lord Arlington, as from his Majesty, about
the new fuel.The occasion why I was mentioned, was from what I said in
my _Sylva_ three years before, about a sort of fuel for a need, which
obstructed a patent of Lord Carlingford, who had been seeking for it
himself; he was endeavoring to bring me into the project, and proffered
me a share.I met my Lord; and, on the 9th, by an order of Council, went
to my Lord Mayor, to be assisting.In the meantime they had made an
experiment of my receipt of _houllies_, which I mention in my book to be
made at Maestricht, with a mixture of charcoal dust and loam, and which
was tried with success at Gresham College (then being the exchange for
the meeting of the merchants since the fire) for everybody to see.This
done, I went to the Treasury for L12,000 for the sick and wounded yet on
my hands.Next day, we met again about the fuel at Sir J. Armourer's in the Mews.My Lord Brereton and others dined at my house, where I
showed them proof of my new fuel, which was very glowing, and without
smoke or ill smell.I went to see Sir Samuel Morland's inventions and
machines, arithmetical wheels, quench-fires, and new harp.The master of the mint and his lady, Mr.Williamson,
Sir Nicholas Armourer, Sir Edward Bowyer, Sir Anthony Auger, and other
friends dined with me.I went to Gravesend; the Dutch fleet still at anchor
before the river, where I saw five of his Majesty's men-at-war encounter
above twenty of the Dutch, in the bottom of the Hope, chasing them with
many broadsides given and returned toward the buoy of the Nore, where
the body of their fleet lay, which lasted till about midnight.One of
their ships was fired, supposed by themselves, she being run on ground.Having seen this bold action, and their braving us so far up the river,
I went home the next day, not without indignation at our negligence, and
the nation's reproach.It is well known who of the Commissioners of the
Treasury gave advice that the charge of setting forth a fleet this year
might be spared, Sir W. C.I received the sad news of Abraham Cowley's death,
that incomparable poet and virtuous man, my very dear friend, and was
greatly deplored.[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d August, 1667.Cowley's funeral, whose corpse lay at
Wallingford House, and was thence conveyed to Westminster Abbey in a
hearse with six horses and all funeral decency, near a hundred coaches
of noblemen and persons of quality following; among these, all the wits
of the town, divers bishops and clergymen.He was interred next Geoffry
Chaucer, and near Spenser.A goodly monument is since erected to his
memory.Now did his Majesty again dine in the presence, in ancient state, with
music and all the court ceremonies, which had been interrupted since the
late war.Oldenburg, a close prisoner in the Tower,
being suspected of writing intelligence.I had an order from Lord
Arlington, Secretary of State, which caused me to be admitted.This
gentleman was secretary to our Society, and I am confident will prove an
innocent person.Finished my account, amounting to L25,000.Farringdon, a relation of my
wife's.There was now a very gallant horse to be baited to death with dogs; but
he fought them all, so as the fiercest of them could not fasten on him,
till the men run him through with their swords.This wicked and
barbarous sport deserved to have been punished in the cruel contrivers
to get money, under pretense that the horse had killed a man, which was
false.I would not be persuaded to be a spectator.Saw the famous Italian puppet-play, for it was no
other.I was appointed, with the rest of my brother
commissioners, to put in execution an order of Council for freeing the
prisoners at war in my custody at Leeds Castle, and taking off his
Majesty's extraordinary charge, having called before us the French and
Dutch agents.The peace was now proclaimed, in the usual form, by the
heralds-at-arms.After evening service, I went to visit Mr.Vaughan,
who lay at Greenwich, a very wise and learned person, one of Mr.Selden's executors and intimate friends.Visited the Lord Chancellor, to whom his Majesty had
sent for the seals a few days before; I found him in his bedchamber,
very sad.The Parliament had accused him, and he had enemies at Court,
especially the buffoons and ladies of pleasure, because he thwarted some
of them, and stood in their way; I could name some of the chief.The
truth is, he made few friends during his grandeur among the royal
sufferers, but advanced the old rebels.He was, however, though no
considerable lawyer, one who kept up the form and substance of things in
the Nation with more solemnity than some would have had.He was my
particular kind friend, on all occasions.The cabal, however, prevailed,
and that party in Parliament.Great division at Court concerning him,
and divers great persons interceding for him.I dined with my late Lord Chancellor, where also
dined Mr.W. Legge, of the bedchamber; his Lordship
pretty well in heart, though now many of his friends and sycophants
abandoned him.In the afternoon, to the Lords Commissioners for money, and thence to
the audience of a Russian Envoy in the Queen's presence-chamber,
introduced with much state, the soldiers, pensioners, and guards in
their order.His letters of credence brought by his secretary in a scarf
of sarsenet, their vests sumptuous, much embroidered with pearls.He
delivered his speech in the Russ language, but without the least action,
or motion, of his body, which was immediately interpreted aloud by a
German that spoke good English: half of it consisted in repetition of
the Czar's titles, which were very haughty and oriental: the substance
of the rest was, that he was only sent to see the King and Queen, and
know how they did, with much compliment and frothy language.Then, they
kissed their Majesties' hands, and went as they came; but their real
errand was to get money.We met at the Star-chamber about exchange and release
of prisoners.Came Sir John Kiviet, to article with me about his
brickwork.Between the hours of twelve and one, was born my
second daughter, who was afterward christened Elizabeth.[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th September, 1667.Henry Howard, of Norfolk, of
whom I obtained the gift of his Arundelian marbles, those celebrated and
famous inscriptions, Greek and Latin, gathered with so much cost and
industry from Greece, by his illustrious grandfather, the magnificent
Earl of Arundel, my noble friend while he lived.When I saw these
precious monuments miserably neglected, and scattered up and down about
the garden, and other parts of Arundel House, and how exceedingly the
corrosive air of London impaired them, I procured him to bestow them on
the University of Oxford.This he was pleased to grant me; and now gave
me the key of the gallery, with leave to mark all those stones, urns,
altars, etc., and whatever I found had inscriptions on them, that were
not statues.This I did; and getting them removed and piled together,
with those which were incrusted in the garden walls, I sent immediately
letters to the Vice-Chancellor of what I had procured, and that if they
esteemed it a service to the University (of which I had been a member),
they should take order for their transportation.Howard to his villa at Albury, where I
designed for him the plot of his canal and garden, with a crypt through
the hill.Returned to London, where I had orders to deliver
the possession of Chelsea College (used as my prison during the war with
Holland for such as were sent from the fleet to London) to our Society,
as a gift of his Majesty, our founder.Bathurst, Dean of Wells,
President of Trinity College, sent by the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, in
the name both of him and the whole University, to thank me for procuring
the inscriptions, and to receive my directions what was to be done to
show their gratitude to Mr.I went to see Lord Clarendon, late Lord Chancellor
and greatest officer in England, in continual apprehension what the
Parliament would determine concerning him.Barlow, Provost of Queen's College and
Protobibliothecus of the Bodleian library, to take order about the
transportation of the marbles.There were delivered to me two letters from the
Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, with the Decree of the Convocation, attested
by the Public Notary, ordering four Doctors of Divinity and Law to
acknowledge the obligation the University had to me for procuring the
_Marmora Arundeliana_, which was solemnly done by Dr.Jenkins, Judge of the Admiralty, Dr.Lloyd, and Obadiah Walker, of
University College, who having made a large compliment from the
University, delivered me the decree fairly written;

    _Gesta venerabili domo Convocationis Universitatis Oxon.Quo die retulit ad Senatum Academicum Dominus
    Vicecancellarius, quantum Universitas deberet singulari benevolentiae

    "SIR:

    "We intend also a noble inscription, in which also honorable mention
    shall be made of yourself; but Mr.Vice-Chancellor commands me to
    tell you that that was not sufficient for your merits; but, that if
    your occasions would permit you to come down at the Act (when we
    intend a dedication of our new Theater), some other testimony should
    be given both of your own worth and affection to this your old
    mother; for we are all very sensible that this great addition of
    learning and reputation to the University is due as well to your
    industrious care for the University, and interest with my Lord
    Howard, as to his great nobleness and generosity of spirit."I am, Sir, your most humble servant,

    "OBADIAH WALKER, Univ.The Vice-Chancellor's letter to the same effect was too vainglorious to
insert, with divers copies of verses that were also sent me.Their
mentioning me in the inscription I totally declined, when I directed the
titles of Mr.Howard, now made Lord, upon his Ambassage to Morocco.These four doctors, having made me this compliment, desired me to carry
and introduce them to Mr.Howard, at Arundel House; which I did, Dr.Barlow (Provost of Queen's) after a short speech, delivering a larger
letter of the University's thanks, which was written in Latin,
expressing the great sense they had of the honor done them.After this
compliment handsomely performed and as nobly received, Mr.Seymour
in the House of Commons; and, in the evening, I returned home.My birthday--blessed be God for all his mercies!I
made the Royal Society a present of the Table of Veins, Arteries, and
Nerves, which great curiosity I had caused to be made in Italy, out of
the natural human bodies, by a learned physician, and the help of
Veslingius (professor at Padua), from whence I brought them in 1646.For
this I received the public thanks of the Society; and they are hanging
up in their repository with an inscription.[13] I found him
in his garden at his new-built palace, sitting in his gout wheel-chair,
and seeing the gates setting up toward the north and the fields.He
looked and spake very disconsolately.After some while deploring his
condition to me, I took my leave.Next morning, I heard he was gone;
though I am persuaded that, had he gone sooner, though but to Cornbury,
and there lain quiet, it would have satisfied the Parliament.That which
exasperated them was his presuming to stay and contest the accusation as
long as it was possible: and they were on the point of sending him to
the Tower.[Footnote 13: This entry of the 9th December, 1667, is a mistake.Evelyn could not have visited the "late Lord Chancellor" on that
    day.Lord Clarendon fled on Saturday, the 29th of November, 1667,
    and his letter resigning the Chancellorship of the University of
    Oxford is dated from Calais on the 7th of December.That Evelyn's
    book is not, in every respect, strictly a diary, is shown by this
    and several similar passages already adverted to in the remarks
    prefixed to the present edition.If the entry of the 18th of August,
    1683, is correct, the date of Evelyn's last visit to Lord Clarendon
    was the 28th of November, 1667.]Heath, wife of my
worthy friend and schoolfellow.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st December, 1667.I saw one Carr pilloried at Charing-cross for a
libel, which was burnt before him by the hangman.I saw deep and prodigious gaming at the
Groom-Porter's, vast heaps of gold squandered away in a vain and profuse
manner.This I looked on as a horrid vice, and unsuitable in a Christian
Court.Went to see the revels at the Middle Temple, which is
also an old riotous custom, and has relation neither to virtue nor
policy.Povey, where were divers great Lords to
see his well-contrived cellar, and other elegancies.We went to stake out ground for building a college
for the Royal Society at Arundel-House, but did not finish it, which we
shall repent of.I saw the tragedy of "Horace" (written by the
VIRTUOUS Mrs.Philips) acted before their Majesties.Between each act a
masque and antique dance.The excessive gallantry of the ladies was
infinite, those especially on that... Castlemaine, esteemed at L40,000
and more, far outshining the Queen.I saw the audience of the Swedish Ambassador Count
Donna, in great state in the banqueting house.Was launched at Deptford, that goodly vessel, "The
Charles."She is longer than the "Sovereign,"
and carries 110 brass cannon; she was built by old Shish, a plain,
honest carpenter, master-builder of this dock, but one who can give very
little account of his art by discourse, and is hardly capable of
reading, yet of great ability in his calling.The family have been ship
carpenters in this yard above 300 years.Went to visit Sir John Cotton, who had me into his
library, full of good MSS., Greek and Latin, but most famous for those
of the Saxon and English antiquities, collected by his grandfather.To the Royal Society, where I subscribed 50,000 bricks,
toward building a college.Among other libertine libels, there was one
now printed and thrown about, a bold petition of the poor w----s to Lady
Castlemaine.[14]

    [Footnote 14: Evelyn has been supposed himself to have written this
    piece.][Sidenote: LONDON]

9th April, 1668.To London, about finishing my grand account of the sick
and wounded, and prisoners at war, amounting to above L34,000.I heard Sir R. Howard impeach Sir William Penn, in the House of Lords,
for breaking bulk, and taking away rich goods out of the East India
prizes, formerly taken by Lord Sandwich.To London, about the purchase of Ravensbourne Mills,
and land around it, in Upper Deptford, of one Mr.We sealed the deeds in Sir Edward Thurland's chambers
in the Inner Temple.I pray God bless it to me, it being a dear
pennyworth; but the passion Sir R. Browne had for it, and that it was
contiguous to our other grounds, engaged me!Invited by that expert commander, Captain Cox, master of
the lately built "Charles II.," now the best vessel of the fleet,
designed for the Duke of York, I went to Erith, where we had a great
dinner.Sir Richard Edgecombe, of Mount Edgecombe, by Plymouth,
my relation, came to visit me; a very virtuous and worthy gentleman.To a new play with several of my relations, "The
Evening Lover," a foolish plot, and very profane; it afflicted me to see
how the stage was degenerated and polluted by the licentious times.Sir Samuel Tuke, Bart., and the lady he had married this
day, came and bedded at night at my house, many friends accompanying the
bride.At the Royal Society, were presented divers _glossa
petras_, and other natural curiosities, found in digging to build the
fort at Sheerness.They were just the same as they bring from Malta,
pretending them to be viper's teeth, whereas, in truth, they are of a
shark, as we found by comparing them with one in our repository.), my old
fellow-traveler, now reader at the Middle Temple, invited me to his
feast, which was so very extravagant and great as the like had not been
seen at any time.There were the Duke of Ormond, Privy Seal, Bedford,
Belasis, Halifax, and a world more of Earls and Lords.His Majesty was pleased to grant me a lease of a slip
of ground out of Brick Close, to enlarge my fore-court, for which I now
gave him thanks; then, entering into other discourse, he talked to me of
a new varnish for ships, instead of pitch, and of the gilding with which
his new yacht was beautified.I showed his Majesty the perpetual motion
sent to me by Dr.Stokes, from Cologne; and then came in Monsieur
Colbert, the French Ambassador.I saw the magnificent entry of the French Ambassador
Colbert, received in the banqueting house.I had never seen a richer
coach than that which he came in to Whitehall.Standing by his Majesty
at dinner in the presence, there was of that rare fruit called the
king-pine, growing in Barbadoes and the West Indies; the first of them I
had ever seen.His Majesty having cut it up, was pleased to give me a
piece off his own plate to taste of; but, in my opinion, it falls short
of those ravishing varieties of deliciousness described in Captain
Ligon's history, and others; but possibly it might, or certainly was,
much impaired in coming so far; it has yet a grateful acidity, but
tastes more like the quince and melon than of any other fruit he
mentions.Published my book on "The Perfection of Painting,"
dedicated to Mr.I entertained Signor Muccinigo, the Venetian
Ambassador, of one of the noblest families of the State, this being the
day of making his public entry, setting forth from my house with several
gentlemen of Venice and others in a very glorious train.He staid with
me till the Earl of Anglesea and Sir Charles Cotterell (master of the
ceremonies) came with the King's barge to carry him to the Tower, where
the guns were fired at his landing; he then entered his Majesty's coach,
followed by many others of the nobility.I accompanied him to his house,
where there was a most noble supper to all the company, of course.After
the extraordinary compliments to me and my wife, for the civilities he
received at my house, I took leave and returned.He is a very
accomplished person.I had much discourse with Signor Pietro Cisij, a
Persian gentleman, about the affairs of Turkey, to my great
satisfaction.I went to see Sir Elias Leighton's project of a cart with
iron axletrees.Being at dinner, my sister Evelyn sent for me to
come up to London to my continuing sick brother.[Sidenote: LONDON]

14th November, 1668.To London, invited to the consecration of that
excellent person, the Dean of Ripon, Dr.Wilkins, now made Bishop of
Chester; it was at Ely House, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr.Cosin,
Bishop of Durham, the Bishops of Ely, Salisbury, Rochester, and others
officiating.Then, we went to a sumptuous dinner
in the hall, where were the Duke of Buckingham, Judges, Secretaries of
State, Lord-Keeper, Council, Noblemen, and innumerable other company,
who were honorers of this incomparable man, universally beloved by all
who knew him.This being the Queen's birthday, great was the gallantry at Whitehall,
and the night celebrated with very fine fireworks.My poor brother continuing ill, I went not from him till the 17th, when,
dining at the Groom Porters, I heard Sir Edward Sutton play excellently
on the Irish harp; he performs genteelly, but not approaching my worthy
friend, Mr.Clark, a gentleman of Northumberland, who makes it execute
lute, viol, and all the harmony an instrument is capable of; pity it is
that it is not more in use; but, indeed, to play well, takes up the
whole man, as Mr.Clark has assured me, who, though a gentleman of
quality and parts, was yet brought up to that instrument from five years
old, as I remember he told me.I waited on Lord Sandwich, who presented me with a
Sembrador he brought out of Spain, showing me his two books of
observations made during his embassy and stay at Madrid, in which were
several rare things he promised to impart to me.I dined at my Lord Ashley's (since Earl of
Shaftesbury), when the match of my niece was proposed for his only son,
in which my assistance was desired for my Lord.Patrick preached at Convent Garden, on Acts
xvii.31, the certainty of Christ's coming to judgment, it being Advent;
a most suitable discourse.I went to see the old play of "Cataline" acted,
having been now forgotten almost forty years.I dined with my Lord Cornbury, at Clarendon House,
now bravely furnished, especially with the pictures of most of our
ancient and modern wits, poets, philosophers, famous and learned
Englishmen; which collection of the Chancellor's I much commended, and
gave his Lordship a catalogue of more to be added.I entertained my kind neighbors, according to
custom, giving Almighty God thanks for his gracious mercies to me the
past year.Imploring his blessing for the year entering, I went
to church, where our Doctor preached on Psalm lxv.12, apposite to the
season, and beginning a new year.About this time one of Sir William Penn's sons had
published a blasphemous book against the Deity of our Blessed Lord.I went to see a tall gigantic woman who measured 6
feet 10 inches high, at 21 years old, born in the Low Countries.I presented his Majesty with my "History of the
Four Impostors;"[15] he told me of other like cheats.I gave my book to
Lord Arlington, to whom I dedicated it.It was now that he began to
tempt me about writing "The Dutch War."[Footnote 15: Reprinted in Evelyn's "Miscellaneous Writings."]Phillips' "Horace" acted again.To the Royal Society, when Signor Malpighi, an
Italian physician and anatomist, sent this learned body the incomparable
"History of the Silk-worm."Dined at Lord Arlington's at Goring House, with the
Bishop of Hereford.To the Council of the Royal Society, about disposing
my Lord Howard's library, now given to us.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th March, 1669.Christopher Wase about my Lord
Arlington.I went with Lord Howard of Norfolk, to visit Sir
William Ducie at Charlton, where we dined; the servants made our
coachmen so drunk, that they both fell off their boxes on the heath,
where we were fain to leave them, and were driven to London by two
servants of my Lord's.This barbarous custom of making the masters
welcome by intoxicating the servants, had now the second time happened
to my coachmen.Treasurer's, where was (with many noblemen)
Colonel Titus of the bedchamber, author of the famous piece against
Cromwell, "Killing no Murder."Williamson, Secretary to the Secretary of
State, and Clerk of the Papers.I dined with the Archbishop of Canterbury, at Lambeth,
and saw the library, which was not very considerable.At a Council of the Royal Society our grant was
finished, in which his Majesty gives us Chelsea College, and some land
about it.It was ordered that five should be a quorum for a Council.The
Vice-President was then sworn for the first time, and it was proposed
how we should receive the Prince of Tuscany, who desired to visit the
Society.This evening, at 10 o'clock, was born my third daughter,
who was baptized on the 25th by the name of Susannah.Went to take leave of Lord Howard, going Ambassador to
Morocco.Dined at Lord Arlington's, where were the Earl of Berkshire,
Lord Saint John, Sir Robert Howard, and Sir R. Holmes.Came my Lord Cornbury, Sir William Pulteney, and others
to visit me.I went this evening to London, to carry Mr.Pepys to my
brother Richard, now exceedingly afflicted with the stone, who had been
successfully cut, and carried the stone as big as a tennis ball to show
him, and encourage his resolution to go through the operation.My wife went a journey of pleasure down the river as
far as the sea, with Mrs.Howard and her daughter, the Maid of Honor,
and others, among whom that excellent creature, Mrs.[16]

    Evelyn, has been published under the auspices of the Bishop of
    Oxford.The affecting circumstances of her death will be found
    recorded on pp.I went toward Oxford; lay at Little Wycomb.[Sidenote: OXFORD]

8th July, 1669.In the morning was celebrated the Encaenia of the New
Theater, so magnificently built by the munificence of Dr.Gilbert
Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, in which was spent,L25,000, as Sir
Christopher Wren, the architect (as I remember), told me; and yet it was
never seen by the benefactor, my Lord Archbishop having told me that he
never did or ever would see it.It is, in truth, a fabric comparable to
any of this kind of former ages, and doubtless exceeding any of the
present, as this University does for colleges, libraries, schools,
students, and order, all the universities in the world.To the theater
is added the famous Sheldonian printing house.This being at the Act and
the first time of opening the Theater (Acts being formerly kept in St.Mary's Church, which might be thought indecent, that being a place set
apart for the immediate worship of God, and was the inducement for
building this noble pile), it was now resolved to keep the present Act
in it, and celebrate its dedication with the greatest splendor and
formality that might be; and, therefore, drew a world of strangers, and
other company, to the University, from all parts of the nation.The Vice-Chancellor, Heads of Houses, and Doctors, being seated in
magisterial seats, the Vice-Chancellor's chair and desk, Proctors, etc.,
covered with _brocatelle_ (a kind of brocade) and cloth of gold; the
University Registrar read the founder's grant and gift of it to the
University for their scholastic exercises upon these solemn occasions.South, the University's orator, in an eloquent speech,
which was very long, and not without some malicious and indecent
reflections on the Royal Society, as underminers of the University;
which was very foolish and untrue, as well as unseasonable.But, to let
that pass from an ill-natured man, the rest was in praise of the
Archbishop and the ingenious architect.This ended, after loud music
from the corridor above, where an organ was placed, there followed
divers panegyric speeches, both in prose and verse, interchangeably
pronounced by the young students placed in the rostrums, in Pindarics,
Eclogues, Heroics, etc., mingled with excellent music, vocal and
instrumental, to entertain the ladies and the rest of the company.A
speech was then made in praise of academical learning.This lasted from
eleven in the morning till seven at night, which was concluded with
ringing of bells, and universal joy and feasting.The next day began the more solemn lectures in all the
faculties, which were performed in the several schools, where all the
Inceptor-Doctors did their exercises, the Professors having first ended
their reading.The assembly now returned to the Theater, where the
_Terrae filius_ (the _University Buffoon_) entertained the auditory with
a tedious, abusive, sarcastical rhapsody, most unbecoming the gravity of
the University, and that so grossly, that unless it be suppressed, it
will be of ill consequence, as I afterward plainly expressed my sense of
it both to the Vice-Chancellor and several Heads of Houses, who were
perfectly ashamed of it, and resolved to take care of it in future.The
old facetious way of rallying upon the questions was left off, falling
wholly upon persons, so that it was rather licentious lying and railing
than genuine and noble wit.In my life, I was never witness of so
shameful an entertainment.After this ribaldry, the Proctors made their speeches.Then began the
music art, vocal and instrumental, above in the balustrade corridor
opposite to the Vice-Chancellor's seat.Wallis, the
mathematical Professor, made his oration, and created one Doctor of
music according to the usual ceremonies of gown (which was of white
damask), cap, ring, kiss, etc.Next followed the disputations of the
Inceptor-Doctors in Medicine, the speech of their Professor, Dr.Hyde,
and so in course their respective creations.Then disputed the Inceptors
of Law, the speech of their Professor, and creation.Lastly, Inceptors
of Theology: Dr.Compton (brother of the Earl of Northampton) being
junior, began with great modesty and applause; so the rest.Allestree's speech, the
King's Professor, and their respective creations.Last of all, the
Vice-Chancellor, shutting up the whole in a panegyrical oration,
celebrating their benefactor and the rest, apposite to the occasion.Thus was the Theater dedicated by the scholastic exercises in all the
Faculties with great solemnity; and the night, as the former,
entertaining the new Doctor's friends in feasting and music.Barlow, the worthy and learned Professor of Queen's
College.The Act sermon was this forenoon preached by Dr.Mary's, in an honest, practical discourse against atheism.In the
afternoon, the church was so crowded, that, not coming early, I could
not approach to hear.Was held the Divinity Act in the Theater again,
when proceeded seventeen Doctors, in all Faculties some.I dined at the Vice-Chancellor's, and spent the
afternoon in seeing the rarities of the public libraries, and visiting
the noble marbles and inscriptions, now inserted in the walls that
compass the area of the Theater, which were 150 of the most ancient and
worthy treasures of that kind in the learned world.Now, observing that
people approach them too near, some idle persons began to scratch and
injure them, I advised that a hedge of holly should be planted at the
foot of the wall, to be kept breast-high only to protect them; which the
Vice-Chancellor promised to do the next season.Fell, Dean of Christ Church and Vice-Chancellor,
with Dr.Allestree, Professor, with beadles and maces before them, came
to visit me at my lodging.I went to visit Lord Howard's sons at
Magdalen College.Having two days before had notice that the University
intended me the honor of Doctorship, I was this morning attended by the
beadles belonging to the Law, who conducted me to the Theater, where I
found the Duke of Ormond (now Chancellor of the University) with the
Earl of Chesterfield and Mr.Spencer (brother to the late Earl of
Sunderland).Thence, we marched to the Convocation House, a convocation
having been called on purpose; here, being all of us robed in the porch,
in scarlet with caps and hoods, we were led in by the Professor of Laws,
and presented respectively by name, with a short eulogy, to the
Vice-Chancellor, who sat in the chair, with all the Doctors and Heads of
Houses and masters about the room, which was exceedingly full.Then,
began the Public Orator his speech, directed chiefly to the Duke of
Ormond, the Chancellor; but in which I had my compliment, in course.This ended, we were called up, and created Doctors according to the
form, and seated by the Vice-Chancellor among the Doctors, on his right
hand; then, the Vice-Chancellor made a short speech, and so, saluting
our brother Doctors, the pageantry concluded, and the convocation was
dissolved.So formal a creation of honorary Doctors had seldom been
seen, that a convocation should be called on purpose, and speeches made
by the Orator; but they could do no less, their Chancellor being to
receive, or rather do them, this honor.I should have been made Doctor
with the rest at the public Act, but their expectation of their
Chancellor made them defer it.I was then led with my brother Doctors to
an extraordinary entertainment at Doctor Mewes's, head of St.John's
College, and, after abundance of feasting and compliments, having
visited the Vice-Chancellor and other Doctors, and given them thanks for
the honor done me, I went toward home the 16th, and got as far as
Windsor, and so to my house the next day.I was invited by Sir Henry Peckham to his reading
feast in the Middle Temple, a pompous entertainment, where were the
Archbishop of Canterbury, all the great Earls and Lords, etc.I had much
discourse with my Lord Winchelsea, a prodigious talker; and the Venetian
Ambassador.To London, spending almost the entire day in
surveying what progress was made in rebuilding the ruinous city, which
now began a little to revive after its sad calamity.I saw the splendid audience of the Danish Ambassador
in the Banqueting House at Whitehall.I went to visit my most excellent and worthy neighbor,
the Lord Bishop of Rochester, at Bromley, which he was now repairing,
after the delapidations of the late Rebellion.I was this day very ill of a pain in my limbs, which
continued most of this week, and was increased by a visit I made to my
old acquaintance, the Earl of Norwich, at his house in Epping Forest,
where are many good pictures put into the wainscot of the rooms, which
Mr.Baker, his Lordship's predecessor there, brought out of Spain;
especially the History of Joseph, a picture of the pious and learned
Picus Mirandula, and an incomparable one of old Breugel.The gardens
were well understood, I mean the _potager_.I returned late in the
evening, ferrying over the water at Greenwich.To church, to give God thanks for my recovery.I received the Blessed Eucharist, to my unspeakable
joy.To the Royal Society, meeting for the first time
after a long recess, during vacation, according to custom; where was
read a description of the prodigious eruption of Mount Etna; and our
English itinerant presented an account of his autumnal peregrination
about England, for which we hired him, bringing dried fowls, fish,
plants, animals, etc.My dear brother continued extremely full of pain,
the Lord be gracious to him!This being the day of meeting for the poor, we dined
neighborly together.Patrick, on
the Resurrection, and afterward, visited the Countess of Kent, my
kinswoman.To London, upon the second edition of my "Sylva,"
which I presented to the Royal Society.John Breton, Master of Emmanuel College, in
Cambridge (uncle to our vicar), preached on John i.27; "whose
shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose," etc., describing the various
fashions of shoes, or sandals, worn by the Jews, and other nations: of
the ornaments of the feet: how great persons had servants that took them
off when they came to their houses, and bore them after them: by which
pointing the dignity of our Savior, when such a person as St.John
Baptist acknowledged his unworthiness even of that mean office.The
lawfulness, decentness, and necessity, of subordinate degrees and ranks
of men and servants, as well in the Church as State: against the late
levelers, and others of that dangerous rabble, who would have all alike.Finding my brother [Richard] in such exceeding torture,
and that he now began to fall into convulsion-fits, I solemnly set the
next day apart to beg of God to mitigate his sufferings, and prosper the
only means which yet remained for his recovery, he being not only much
wasted, but exceedingly and all along averse from being cut (for the
stone); but, when he at last consented, and it came to the operation,
and all things prepared, his spirit and resolution failed.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th March, 1670.I
participated of the Blessed Sacrament, recommending to God the
deplorable condition of my dear brother, who was almost in the last
agonies of death.It pleased God to
deliver him out of this miserable life, toward five o'clock this Monday
morning, to my unspeakable grief.He was a brother whom I most dearly
loved, for his many virtues; but two years younger than myself, a sober,
prudent, worthy gentleman.He had married a great fortune, and left one
only daughter, and a noble seat at Woodcot, near Epsom.His body was
opened, and a stone taken out of his bladder, not much bigger than a
nutmeg.I returned home on the 8th, full of sadness, and to bemoan my
loss.A stranger preached at the Savoy French church; the
Liturgy of the Church of England being now used altogether, as
translated into French by Dr.We all accompanied the corpse of my dear brother to
Epsom Church, where he was decently interred in the chapel belonging to
Woodcot House.A great number of friends and gentlemen of the country
attended, about twenty coaches and six horses, and innumerable people.I went to Westminster, where in the House of Lords I
saw his Majesty sit on his throne, but without his robes, all the peers
sitting with their hats on; the business of the day being the divorce of
my Lord Ross.Such an occasion and sight had not been seen in England
since the time of Henry VIII.[17]

    [Footnote 17: Evelyn subjoins in a note: "When there was a project,
    1669, for getting a divorce for the King, to facilitate it there was
    brought into the House of Lords a bill for dissolving the marriage
    of Lord Ross, on account of adultery, and to give him leave to marry
    again.This Bill, after great debates, passed by the plurality of
    only two votes, and that by the great industry of the Lord's
    friends, as well as the Duke's enemies, who carried it on chiefly in
    hopes it might be a precedent and inducement for the King to enter
    the more easily into their late proposals; nor were they a little
    encouraged therein, when they saw the King countenance and drive on
    the Bill in Lord Ross's favor.Of eighteen bishops that were in the
    House, only two voted for the bill, of which one voted through age,
    and one was reputed Socinian."The two bishops favorable to the bill
    were Dr.Cosin, Bishop of Durham, and Dr.Wilkins, Bishop of
    Chester.]To London, concerning the office of Latin Secretary to
his Majesty, a place of more honor and dignity than profit, the
reversion of which he had promised me.Henry Saville, and Sir Charles
Scarborough.Philip Howard, Lord Almoner
to the Queen, that Monsieur Evelin, first physician to Madame (who was
now come to Dover to visit the King her brother), was come to town,
greatly desirous to see me; but his stay so short, that he could not
come to me, I went with my brother to meet him at the Tower, where he
was seeing the magazines and other curiosities, having never before been
in England: we renewed our alliance and friendship, with much regret on
both sides that, he being to return toward Dover that evening, we could
not enjoy one another any longer.How this French family, Ivelin, of
Evelin, Normandy, a very ancient and noble house is grafted into our
pedigree, see in the collection brought from Paris, 1650.I went with some friends to the Bear Garden, where was
cock-fighting, dog-fighting, bear and bull-baiting, it being a famous
day for all these butcherly sports, or rather barbarous cruelties.The
bulls did exceedingly well, but the Irish wolf dog exceeded, which was a
tall greyhound, a stately creature indeed, who beat a cruel mastiff.One
of the bulls tossed a dog full into a lady's lap as she sat in one of
the boxes at a considerable height from the arena.Two poor dogs were
killed, and so all ended with the ape on horseback, and I most heartily
weary of the rude and dirty pastime, which I had not seen, I think, in
twenty years before.Dined at Goring House, whither my Lord Arlington
carried me from Whitehall with the Marquis of Worcester; there, we found
Lord Sandwich, Viscount Stafford,[18] the Lieutenant of the Tower, and
others.After dinner, my Lord communicated to me his Majesty's desire
that I would engage to write the history of our late war with the
Hollanders, which I had hitherto declined; this I found was ill taken,
and that I should disoblige his Majesty, who had made choice of me to do
him this service, and, if I would undertake it, I should have all the
assistance the Secretary's office and others could give me, with other
encouragements, which I could not decently refuse.[Footnote 18: Sir William Howard, created in November, 1640,
    Viscount Stafford.In 1678, he was accused of complicity with the
    Popish Plot, and upon trial by his Peers in Westminster Hall, was
    found guilty, by a majority of twenty-four.He was beheaded,
    December 29, 1680, on Tower Hill.]Lord Stafford rose from the table, in some disorder, because there were
roses stuck about the fruit when the dessert was set on the table; such
an antipathy, it seems, he had to them as once Lady Selenger also had,
and to that degree that, as Sir Kenelm Digby tells us, laying but a rose
upon her cheek when she was asleep, it raised a blister: but Sir Kenelm
was a teller of strange things.Came the Earl of Huntington and Countess, with the Lord
Sherard, to visit us.[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th June, 1670.To London, in order to my niece's marriage, Mary,
daughter to my late brother Richard, of Woodcot, with the eldest son of
Mr.Attorney Montague, which was celebrated at Southampton-House chapel,
after which a magnificent entertainment, feast, and dancing, dinner and
supper, in the great room there; but the bride was bedded at my sister's
lodging, in Drury-Lane.Stanhope, gentleman-usher to her
Majesty, and uncle to the Earl of Chesterfield, a very fine man, with my
Lady Hutcheson.I accompanied my worthy friend, that excellent man, Sir
Robert Murray, with Mr.Slingsby, master of the mint, to see the
latter's seat and estate at Burrow-Green in Cambridgeshire, he desiring
our advice for placing a new house, which he was resolved to build.We
set out in a coach and six horses with him and his lady, dined about
midway at one Mr.Turner's, where we found a very noble dinner, venison,
music, and a circle of country ladies and their gallants.After dinner,
we proceeded, and came to Burrow-Green that night.This had been the
ancient seat of the Cheekes (whose daughter Mr.Slingsby married),
formerly tutor to King Henry VI.The old house large and ample, and
built for ancient hospitality, ready to fall down with age, placed in a
dirty hole, a stiff clay, no water, next an adjoining church-yard, and
with other inconveniences.We pitched on a spot of rising ground,
adorned with venerable woods, a dry and sweet prospect east and west,
and fit for a park, but no running water; at a mile distance from the
old house.We went to dine at Lord Allington's, who had newly
built a house of great cost, I believe a little less than L20,000.It is seated in a park, with a sweet prospect
and stately avenue; but water still defective; the house has also its
infirmities.[Sidenote: NEWMARKET]

22d July, 1670.We rode out to see the great mere, or level, of
recovered fen land, not far off.In the way, we met Lord Arlington going
to his house in Suffolk, accompanied with Count Ogniati, the Spanish
minister, and Sir Bernard Gascoigne; he was very importunate with me to
go with him to Euston, being but fifteen miles distant; but, in regard
of my company, I could not.So, passing through Newmarket, we alighted
to see his Majesty's house there, now new-building; the arches of the
cellars beneath are well turned by Mr.Samuel, the architect, the rest
mean enough, and hardly fit for a hunting house.Many of the rooms above
had the chimneys in the angles and corners, a mode now introduced by his
Majesty, which I do at no hand approve of.I predict it will spoil many
noble houses and rooms, if followed.It does only well in very small and
trifling rooms, but takes from the state of greater.Besides, this house
is placed in a dirty street, without any court or avenue, like a common
one, whereas it might and ought to have been built at either end of the
town, upon the very carpet where the sports are celebrated; but, it
being the purchase of an old wretched house of my Lord Thomond's, his
Majesty was persuaded to set it on that foundation, the most improper
imaginable for a house of sport and pleasure.We went to see the stables and fine horses, of which many were here kept
at a vast expense, with all the art and tenderness imaginable.Being arrived at some meres, we found Lord Wotton and Sir John Kiviet
about their draining engines, having, it seems, undertaken to do wonders
on a vast piece of marsh-ground they had hired of Sir Thomas Chicheley
(master of the ordnance).They much pleased themselves with the hopes of
a rich harvest of hemp and coleseed, which was the crop expected.Here we visited the engines and mills both for wind and water, draining
it through two rivers or graffs, cut by hand, and capable of carrying
considerable barges, which went thwart one the other, discharging the
water into the sea.Such this spot had been the former winter; it was
astonishing to see it now dry, and so rich that weeds grew on the banks,
almost as high as a man and horse.Here, my Lord and his partner had
built two or three rooms, with Flanders white bricks, very hard.One of
the great engines was in the kitchen, where I saw the fish swim up, even
to the very chimney hearth, by a small cut through the room, and running
within a foot of the very fire.Having, after dinner, ridden about that vast level, pestered with heat
and swarms of gnats, we returned over Newmarket Heath, the way being
mostly a sweet turf and down, like Salisbury Plain, the jockeys
breathing their fine barbs and racers and giving them their heats.We returned from Burrow Green to London, staying some
time at Audley End to see that fine palace.It is indeed a cheerful
piece of Gothic building, or rather _antico moderno_, but placed in an
obscure bottom.The cellars and galleries are very stately.It has a
river by it, a pretty avenue of limes, and in a park.This is in Saffron Walden parish, famous for that useful plant, with
which all the country is covered.[Sidenote: LONDON]

Dining at Bishop Stortford, we came late to London.There was sent me by a neighbor a servant maid, who,
in the last month, as she was sitting before her mistress at work, felt
a stroke on her arm a little above the wrist for some height, the smart
of which, as if struck by another hand, caused her to hold her arm
awhile till somewhat mitigated; but it put her into a kind of
convulsion, or rather hysteric fit.A gentleman coming casually in,
looking on her arm, found that part powdered with red crosses, set in
most exact and wonderful order, neither swelled nor depressed, about
this shape,

          x
      x       x
    x     x     x
      x       x
          x

not seeming to be any way made by artifice, of a reddish color, not so
red as blood, the skin over them smooth, the rest of the arm livid and
of a mortified hue, with certain prints, as it were, of the stroke of
fingers.This had happened three several times in July, at about ten
days' interval, the crosses beginning to wear out, but the successive
ones set in other different, yet uniform order.The maid seemed very
modest, and came from London to Deptford with her mistress, to avoid the
discourse and importunity of curious people.She made no gain by it,
pretended no religious fancies; but seemed to be a plain, ordinary,
silent, working wench, somewhat fat, short, and high-.She told
me divers divines and physicians had seen her, but were unsatisfied;
that she had taken some remedies against her fits, but they did her no
good; she had never before had any fits; once since, she seemed in her
sleep to hear one say to her that she should tamper no more with them,
nor trouble herself with anything that happened, but put her trust in
the merits of Christ only.This is the substance of what she told me, and what I saw and curiously
examined.I was formerly acquainted with the impostorious nuns of
Loudun, in France, which made such noise among the <DW7>s; I therefore
thought this worth the notice.I remember Monsieur Monconys[19] (that
curious traveler and a Roman Catholic) was by no means satisfied with
the _stigmata_ of those nuns, because they were so shy of letting him
scrape the letters, which were Jesus, Maria, Joseph (as I think),
observing they began to scale off with it, whereas this poor wench was
willing to submit to any trial; so that I profess I know not what to
think of it, nor dare I pronounce it anything supernatural.[Footnote 19: Balthasar de Monconys, a Frenchman, celebrated for his
    travels in the East, which he published in three volumes.His object
    was to discover vestiges of the philosophy of Trismegistus and
    Zoroaster; in which, it is hardly necessary to add, he was not very
    successful.]At Windsor I supped with the Duke of Monmouth; and,
the next day, invited by Lord Arlington, dined with the same Duke and
divers Lords.After dinner my Lord and I had a conference of more than
an hour alone in his bedchamber, to engage me in the History.I showed
him something that I had drawn up, to his great satisfaction, and he
desired me to show it to the Treasurer.One of the Canons preached; then followed the
offering of the Knights of the Order, according to custom; first the
poor Knights, in procession, then, the Canons in their formalities, the
Dean and Chancellor, then his Majesty (the Sovereign), the Duke of York,
Prince Rupert; and, lastly, the Earl of Oxford, being all the Knights
that were then at Court.I dined with the Treasurer, and consulted with him what pieces I was to
add; in the afternoon the King took me aside into the balcony over the
terrace, extremely pleased with what had been told him I had begun, in
order to his commands, and enjoining me to proceed vigorously in it.He
told me he had ordered the Secretaries of State to give me all necessary
assistance of papers and particulars relating to it and enjoining me to
make it a LITTLE KEEN, for that the Hollanders had very unhandsomely
abused him in their pictures, books, and libels.Windsor was now going to be repaired, being exceedingly ragged and
ruinous.Prince Rupert, the Constable, had begun to trim up the keep or
high round Tower, and handsomely adorned his hall with furniture of
arms, which was very singular, by so disposing the pikes, muskets,
pistols, bandoleers, holsters, drums, back, breast, and headpieces, as
was very extraordinary.Thus, those huge steep stairs ascending to it
had the walls invested with this martial furniture, all new and bright,
so disposing the bandoleers, holsters, and drums, as to represent
festoons, and that without any confusion, trophy-like.From the hall we
went into his bedchamber, and ample rooms hung with tapestry, curious
and effeminate pictures, so extremely different from the other, which
presented nothing but war and horror.The King passed most of his time in hunting the stag, and walking in the
park, which he was now planting with rows of trees.To visit Sir Richard Lashford, my kinsman, and Mr.Charles Howard, at his extraordinary garden, at Deepden.Arthur Onslow, at West
Clandon, a pretty dry seat on the Downs, where we dined in his great
room.Hussey, who, being near Wotton, lives
in a sweet valley, deliciously watered.To Albury, to see how that garden proceeded, which
I found exactly done to the design and plot I had made, with the crypta
through the mountain in the park, thirty perches in length.Such a
Pausilippe[20] is nowhere in England.The canal was now digging, and the
vineyard planted.[Footnote 20: A word adopted by Evelyn for a subterranean passage,
    from the famous grot of Pausilippo, at Naples.]I spent the whole afternoon in private with the
Treasurer who put into my hands those secret pieces and transactions
concerning the Dutch war, and particularly the expedition of Bergen, in
which he had himself the chief part, and gave me instructions, till the
King arriving from Newmarket, we both went up into his bedchamber.Dined with the Treasurer; and, after dinner, we
were shut up together.I received other [further] advices, and ten paper
books of dispatches and treaties; to return which again I gave a note
under my hand to Mr.I was this morning fifty years of age; the Lord
teach me to number my days so as to apply them to his glory!Saw the Prince of Orange, newly come to see the
King, his uncle; he has a manly, courageous, wise countenance,
resembling his mother and the Duke of Gloucester, both deceased.I now also saw that famous beauty, but in my opinion of a childish,
simple, and baby face, Mademoiselle Querouaille,[21] lately Maid of
Honor to Madame, and now to be so to the Queen.[Footnote 21: Henrietta, the King's sister, married to Philip, Duke
    of Orleans, was then on a visit here.Madame Querouaille came over
    in her train, on purpose to entice Charles into an union with Louis
    XIV.; a design which unhappily succeeded but too well.She became
    the King's mistress, was made Duchess of Portsmouth, and was his
    favorite till his death.]Dined with the Earl of Arlington, where was the
Venetian Ambassador, of whom I now took solemn leave, now on his return.There were also Lords Howard, Wharton, Windsor, and divers other great
persons.I dined with the Treasurer, where was the Earl of
Rochester, a very profane wit.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th December, 1670.It was the thickest and darkest fog on the Thames
that was ever known in the memory of man, and I happened to be in the
very midst of it.I supped with Monsieur Zulestein, late Governor to the
late Prince of Orange.Bohun, my son's tutor, had been five years in
my house, and now Bachelor of Laws, and Fellow of New College, went from
me to Oxford to reside there, having well and faithfully performed his
charge.This day I first acquainted his Majesty with that
incomparable young man, Gibbon,[22] whom I had lately met with in an
obscure place by mere accident, as I was walking near a poor solitary
thatched house, in a field in our parish, near Sayes Court.I found him
shut in; but looking in at the window, I perceived him carving that
large cartoon, or crucifix, of Tintoretto, a copy of which I had myself
brought from Venice, where the original painting remains.I asked if I
might enter; he opened the door civilly to me, and I saw him about such
a work as for the curiosity of handling, drawing, and studious
exactness, I never had before seen in all my travels.I questioned him
why he worked in such an obscure and lonesome place; he told me it was
that he might apply himself to his profession without interruption, and
wondered not a little how I found him out.I asked if he was unwilling
to be made known to some great man, for that I believed it might turn to
his profit; he answered, he was yet but a beginner, but would not be
sorry to sell off that piece; on demanding the price, he said L100.In
good earnest, the very frame was worth the money, there being nothing in
nature so tender and delicate as the flowers and festoons about it, and
yet the work was very strong; in the piece was more than one hundred
figures of men, etc.I found he was likewise musical, and very civil,
sober, and discreet in his discourse.There was only an old woman in the
house.So, desiring leave to visit him sometimes, I went away.[Footnote 22: Better known by the name of Grinling Gibbon;
    celebrated for his exquisite carving.Some of his most astonishing
    work is at Chatsworth and at Petworth.]Of this young artist, together with my manner of finding him out, I
acquainted the King, and begged that he would give me leave to bring him
and his work to Whitehall, for that I would adventure my reputation with
his Majesty that he had never seen anything approach it, and that he
would be exceedingly pleased, and employ him.The King said he would
himself go see him.This was the first notice his Majesty ever had of
Mr.The King came to me in the Queen's withdrawing-room
from the circle of ladies, to talk with me as to what advance I had made
in the Dutch History.I dined with the Treasurer, and afterward we went
to the Secretary's Office, where we conferred about divers particulars.I was directed to go to Sir George Downing, who
having been a public minister in Holland, at the beginning of the war,
was to give me light in some material passages.This year the weather was so wet, stormy, and unseasonable, as had not
been known in many years.I saw the great ball danced by the Queen and
distinguished ladies at Whitehall Theater.Next day; was acted there the
famous play, called, "The Siege of Granada," two days acted
successively; there were indeed very glorious scenes and perspectives,
the work of Mr.[23]

    [Footnote 23: Evelyn here refers to Dryden's "Conquest of Granada".]Pepys, Clerk of the Acts, two extraordinary,
ingenious, and knowing persons, and other friends.I carried them to see
the piece of carving which I had recommended to the King.Came to visit me one of the Lords Commissioners of
Scotland for the Union.The Treasurer acquainted me that his Majesty was
graciously pleased to nominate me one of the Council of Foreign
Plantations, and give me a salary of L500 per annum, to encourage me.I went to thank the Treasurer, who was my great
friend and loved me; I dined with him and much company, and went thence
to my Lord Arlington, Secretary of State, in whose favor I likewise was
upon many occasions, though I cultivated neither of their friendships by
any mean submissions.I kissed his Majesty's hand, on his making me one
of the new-established Council.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st March, 1671.Gibbon to bring to Whitehall his
excellent piece of carving, where being come, I advertised his Majesty,
who asked me where it was; I told him in Sir Richard Browne's (my
father-in-law) chamber, and that if it pleased his Majesty to appoint
whither it should be brought, being large and though of wood, heavy, I
would take care for it."No," says the King, "show me the way, I'll go
to Sir Richard's chamber," which he immediately did, walking along the
entries after me; as far as the ewry, till he came up into the room,
where I also lay.No sooner was he entered and cast his eyes on the
work, but he was astonished at the curiosity of it; and having
considered it a long time, and discoursed with Mr.Gibbon, whom I
brought to kiss his hand, he commanded it should be immediately carried
to the Queen's side to show her.It was carried up into her bedchamber,
where she and the King looked on and admired it again; the King, being
called away, left us with the Queen, believing she would have bought it,
it being a crucifix; but, when his Majesty was gone, a French peddling
woman, one Madame de Boord, who used to bring petticoats and fans, and
baubles, out of France to the ladies, began to find fault with several
things in the work, which she understood no more than an ass, or a
monkey, so as in a kind of indignation, I caused the person who brought
it to carry it back to the chamber, finding the Queen so much governed
by an ignorant Frenchwoman, and this incomparable artist had his labor
only for his pains, which not a little displeased me; and he was fain to
send it down to his cottage again; he not long after sold it for L80,
though well worth L100, without the frame, to Sir George Viner.Wren, faithfully promised me to employ
him.[24] I having also bespoke his Majesty for his work at Windsor,
which my friend, Mr.May, the architect there, was going to alter, and
repair universally; for, on the next day, I had a fair opportunity of
talking to his Majesty about it, in the lobby next the Queen's side,
where I presented him with some sheets of my history.James's Park to the garden, where I both saw and
heard a very familiar discourse between... and Mrs.Nelly,[25] as they
called an impudent comedian, she looking out of her garden on a terrace
at the top of the wall, and... standing on the green walk under it.I
was heartily sorry at this scene.Thence the King walked to the Duchess
of Cleveland, another lady of pleasure, and curse of our nation.[Footnote 24: The carving in the choir, etc., of St.Paul's
    Cathedral was executed by Gibbon.][Footnote 25: Nell Gwynne: there can be no doubt as to the name with
    which we are to fill up these blanks.This familiar interview of
    Nelly and the King has afforded a subject for painters.]I dined at Greenwich, to take leave of Sir Thomas
Linch, going Governor of Jamaica.To London, about passing my patent as one of the
standing Council for Plantations, a considerable honor, the others in
the Council being chiefly noblemen and officers of state.[Illustration: _NELL GWYNNE_

_Photogravure after Sir Peter Lely_]

2d April, 1671.To Sir Thomas Clifford, the Treasurer, to condole with
him on the loss of his eldest son, who died at Florence.The French King, being now with a great army of 28,000 men
about Dunkirk, divers of the grandees of that Court, and a vast number
of gentlemen and cadets, in fantastical habits, came flocking over to
see our Court and compliment his Majesty.I was present, when they first
were conducted into the Queen's withdrawing-room, where saluted their
Majesties the Dukes of Guise, Longueville, and many others of the first
rank.Treasurer's,[26] in company with Monsieur
De Grammont and several French noblemen, and one Blood, that impudent,
bold fellow who had not long before attempted to steal the imperial
crown itself out of the Tower, pretending only curiosity of seeing the
regalia there, when, stabbing the keeper, though not mortally, he boldly
went away with it through all the guards, taken only by the accident of
his horse falling down.How he came to be pardoned, and even received
into favor, not only after this, but several other exploits almost as
daring both in Ireland and here, I could never come to understand.Some
believed he became a spy of several parties, being well with the
sectaries and enthusiasts, and did his Majesty services that way, which
none alive could do so well as he; but it was certainly the boldest
attempt, so the only treason of this sort that was ever pardoned.This
man had not only a daring but a villanous, unmerciful look, a false
countenance, but very well-spoken and dangerously insinuating.[Footnote 26: This entry of 10th May, 1671, so far as it relates to
    Blood, and the stealing of the crown, etc., is a mistake.Blood
    stole the crown on the 9th of May, 1671--the very day before; and
    the "not long before" of Evelyn, and the circumstance of his being
    "pardoned," which Evelyn also mentions, can hardly be said to relate
    to only the day before.]I went to Eltham, to sit as one of the commissioners
about the subsidy now given by Parliament to his Majesty.Treasurer's [Sir Thomas Clifford] with
the Earl of Arlington, Carlingford, Lord Arundel of Wardour, Lord
Almoner to the Queen, a French Count and two abbots, with several more
of French nobility; and now by something I had lately observed of Mr.Treasurer's conversation on occasion, I suspected him a little warping
to Rome.I dined at a feast made for me and my wife by the
Trinity Company, for our passing a fine of the land which Sir R. Browne,
my wife's father, freely gave to found and build their college, or
almshouses on, at Deptford, it being my wife's after her father's
decease.It was a good and charitable work and gift, but would have been
better bestowed on the poor of that parish, than on the seamen's widows,
the Trinity Company being very rich, and the rest of the poor of the
parish exceedingly indigent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th May, 1671.The Earl of Bristol's house in Queen's Street
[Lincoln's Inn Fields] was taken for the Commissioners of Trade and
Plantations, and furnished with rich hangings of the King's.It
consisted of seven rooms on a floor, with a long gallery, gardens, etc.This day we met the Duke of Buckingham, Earl of Lauderdale, Lord
Culpeper, Sir George Carteret, Vice-Chamberlain, and myself, had the
oaths given us by the Earl of Sandwich, our President.It was to advise
and counsel his Majesty, to the best of our abilities, for the
well-governing of his Foreign Plantations, etc., the form very little
differing from that given to the Privy Council.We then took our places
at the Board in the Council-Chamber, a very large room furnished with
atlases, maps, charts, globes, etc.Then came the Lord Keeper, Sir
Orlando Bridgeman, Earl of Arlington, Secretary of State, Lord Ashley,
Mr.Treasurer, Sir John Trevor, the other Secretary, Sir John Duncomb,
Lord Allington, Mr.Grey, son to the Lord Grey, Mr.Henry Broncher, Sir
Humphrey Winch, Sir John Finch, Mr.Waller, and Colonel Titus, of the
bedchamber, with Mr.Slingsby, Secretary to the Council, and two Clerks
of the Council, who had all been sworn some days before.Being all set,
our Patent was read, and then the additional Patent, in which was
recited this new establishment; then, was delivered to each a copy of
the Patent, and of instructions: after which, we proceeded to business.The first thing we did was, to settle the form of a circular letter to
the Governors of all his Majesty's Plantations and Territories in the
West Indies and Islands thereof, to give them notice to whom they should
apply themselves on all occasions, and to render us an account of their
present state and government; but, what we most insisted on was, to know
the condition of New England, which appearing to be very independent as
to their regard to Old England, or his Majesty, rich and strong as they
now were, there were great debates in what style to write to them; for
the condition of that Colony was such, that they were able to contest
with all other Plantations about them, and there was fear of their
breaking from all dependence on this nation; his Majesty, therefore,
commended this affair more expressly.We, therefore, thought fit, in the
first place, to acquaint ourselves as well as we could of the state of
that place, by some whom we heard of that were newly come from thence,
and to be informed of their present posture and condition; some of our
Council were for sending them a menacing letter, which those who better
understood the peevish and touchy humor of that Colony, were utterly
against.A letter was then read from Sir Thomas Modiford, Governor of Jamaica;
and then the Council broke up.Having brought an action against one Cocke, for money which he had
received for me, it had been referred to an arbitration by the
recommendation of that excellent good man, the Chief-Justice Hale,[27]
but, this not succeeding, I went to advise with that famous lawyer, Mr.Jones, of Gray's Inn, and, 27th of May, had a trial before Lord Chief
Justice Hale; and, after the lawyers had wrangled sufficiently, it was
referred to a new arbitration.This was the very first suit at law that
ever I had with any creature, and oh, that it might be the last![Footnote 27: Sir Matthew Hale, so famous as one of the justices of
    the bench in Cromwell's time.After the Restoration, he became Chief
    Baron of the Exchequer; then Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and
    died in 1676.The author of numerous works, not only on professional
    subjects, but on mathematics and philosophy.]I went to Council, where was produced a most exact and
ample information of the state of Jamaica, and of the best expedients as
to New England, on which there was a long debate; but at length it was
concluded that, if any, it should be only a conciliating paper at first,
or civil letter, till we had better information of the present face of
things, since we understood they were a people almost upon the very
brink of renouncing any dependence on the Crown.To a splendid dinner at the great room in Deptford
Trinity House, Sir Thomas Allen chosen Master, and succeeding the Earl
of Craven.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th June, 1671.To carry Colonel Middleton to Whitehall, to my Lord
Sandwich, our President, for some information which he was able to give
of the state of the Colony in New England.To Council again, when one Colonel Cartwright, a
Nottinghamshire man, (formerly in commission with Colonel Nicholls) gave
us a considerable relation of that country; on which the Council
concluded that in the first place a letter of amnesty should be
dispatched.Constantine Huygens, Signor of Zuylichem, that
excellent learned man, poet, and musician, now near eighty years of age,
a vigorous, brisk man,[28] came to take leave of me before his return
into Holland with the Prince, whose Secretary he was.[Footnote 28: He died in 1687, at the great age of 90 years and 6
    months.Constantine and his son, Christian Huygens, were both
    eminent for scientific knowledge and classical attainments;
    Christian, particularly so; for he was the inventor of the pendulum,
    made an improvement in the air-pump, first discovered the ring and
    one of the satellites of Saturn, and ascertained the laws of
    collision of elastic bodies.Constantine, the
    father, was a person of influence and distinction in Holland, and
    held the post of secretary to the Prince of Orange.]To Council, where Lord Arlington acquainted us that it
was his Majesty's proposal we should, every one of us, contribute L20
toward building a Council chamber and conveniences somewhere in
Whitehall, that his Majesty might come and sit among us, and hear our
debates; the money we laid out to be reimbursed out of the contingent
moneys already set apart for us, viz, L1,000 yearly.To this we
unanimously consented.There came an uncertain bruit from Barbadoes of
some disorder there.On my return home I stepped in at the theater to
see the new machines for the intended scenes, which were indeed very
costly and magnificent.To Council, where were letters from Sir Thomas
Modiford, of the expedition and exploit of Colonel Morgan, and others of
Jamaica, on the Spanish Continent at Panama.To Council, where we drew up and agreed to a letter to
be sent to New England, and made some proposal to Mr.Gorges, for his
interest in a plantation there.Surveyor brought us a plot for the
building of our Council chamber, to be erected at the end of the Privy
garden, in Whitehall.The matter in debate
was, whether we should send a deputy to New England, requiring them of
the Massachusetts to restore such to their limits and respective
possessions, as had petitioned the Council; this to be the open
commission only; but, in truth, with secret instructions to inform us of
the condition of those Colonies, and whether they were of such power, as
to be able to resist his Majesty and declare for themselves as
independent of the Crown, which we were told, and which of late years
made them refractory.Colonel Middleton, being called in, assured us
they might be curbed by a few of his Majesty's first-rate frigates, to
spoil their trade with the islands; but, though my Lord President was
not satisfied, the rest were, and we did resolve to advise his Majesty
to send Commissioners with a formal commission for adjusting boundaries,
etc., with some other instructions.The letters of Sir Thomas Modiford were
read, giving relation of the exploit at Panama, which was very brave;
they took, burned, and pillaged the town of vast treasures, but the best
of the booty had been shipped off, and lay at anchor in the South Sea,
so that, after our men had ranged the country sixty miles about, they
went back to Nombre de Dios, and embarked for Jamaica.Such an action
had not been done since the famous Drake.I dined at the Hamburg Resident's, and, after dinner, went to the
christening of Sir Samuel Tuke's son, Charles, at Somerset House, by a
Popish priest, and many odd ceremonies.The godfathers were the King,
and Lord Arundel of Wardour, and godmother, the Countess of Huntingdon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th August, 1671.To London, with some more papers of my progress in
the Dutch War, delivered to the Treasurer.Dined with the Treasurer, in company with my Lord
Arlington, Halifax, and Sir Thomas Strickland; and next day, went home,
being the anniversary of the late dreadful fire of London.In the afternoon at Council, where letters were
read from Sir Charles Wheeler, concerning his resigning his government
of St.I dined in the city, at the fraternity feast in
Ironmongers' Hall, where the four stewards chose their successors for
the next year, with a solemn procession, garlands about their heads, and
music playing before them; so, coming up to the upper tables where the
gentlemen sat, they drank to the new stewards; and so we parted.I dined at the Treasurer's, where I had discourse
with Sir Henry Jones (now come over to raise a regiment of horse),
concerning the French conquests in Lorraine; he told me the King sold
all things to the soldiers, even to a handful of hay.After dinner, the Treasurer carried me to Lincoln's Inn, to one of the
Parliament Clerks, to obtain of him, that I might carry home and peruse,
some of the Journals, which were, accordingly, delivered to me to
examine about the late Dutch War.Returning home, I went on shore to see
the Custom House, now newly rebuilt since the dreadful conflagration.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th and 10th October, 1671.I went, after evening service, to London,
in order to a journey of refreshment with Mr.Treasurer, to Newmarket,
where the King then was, in his coach with six brave horses, which we
changed thrice, first, at Bishop-Stortford, and last, at Chesterford;
so, by night, we got to Newmarket, where Mr.Henry Jermain (nephew to
the Earl of St.We proceeded immediately
to Court, the King and all the English gallants being there at their
autumnal sports.Supped at the Lord Chamberlain's; and, the next day,
after dinner, I was on the heath, where I saw the great match run
between Woodcock and Flatfoot, belonging to the King, and to Mr.Eliot,
of the bedchamber, many thousands being spectators; a more signal race
had not been run for many years.This over, I went that night with Mr.Treasurer to Euston, a palace of
Lord Arlington's, where we found Monsieur Colbert (the French
Ambassador), and the famous new French Maid of Honor, Mademoiselle
Querouaille, now coming to be in great favor with the King.Here was
also the Countess of Sunderland, and several lords and ladies, who
lodged in the house.During my stay here with Lord Arlington, near a fortnight, his Majesty
came almost every second day with the Duke, who commonly returned to
Newmarket, but the King often lay here, during which time I had twice
the honor to sit at dinner with him, with all freedom.It was
universally reported that the fair lady ----, was bedded one of these
nights, and the stocking flung, after the manner of a married bride; I
acknowledge she was for the most part in her undress all day, and that
there was fondness and toying with that young wanton; nay, it was said,
I was at the former ceremony; but it is utterly false; I neither saw nor
heard of any such thing while I was there, though I had been in her
chamber, and all over that apartment late enough, and was myself
observing all passages with much curiosity.However, it was with
confidence believed she was first made _a Miss_, as they called these
unhappy creatures, with solemnity at this time.On Sunday, a young Cambridge divine preached an excellent sermon in the
chapel, the King and the Duke of York being present.Came all the great men from Newmarket, and other
parts both of Suffolk and Norfolk, to make their court, the whole house
filled from one end to the other with lords, ladies, and gallants; there
was such a furnished table, as I had seldom seen, nor anything more
splendid and free, so that for fifteen days there were entertained at
least 200 people, and half as many horses, besides servants and guards,
at infinite expense.In the morning, we went hunting and hawking; in the afternoon, till
almost morning, to cards and dice, yet I must say without noise,
swearing, quarrel, or confusion of any sort.I, who was no gamester, had
often discourse with the French Ambassador, Colbert, and went sometimes
abroad on horseback with the ladies to take the air, and now and then to
hunting; thus idly passing the time, but not without more often recess
to my pretty apartment, where I was quite out of all this hurry, and had
leisure when I would, to converse with books, for there is no man more
hospitably easy to be withal than my Lord Arlington, of whose particular
friendship and kindness I had ever a more than ordinary share.His house
is a very noble pile, consisting of four pavilions after the French,
beside a body of a large house, and, though not built altogether, but
formed of additions to an old house (purchased by his Lordship of one
Sir T. Rookwood) yet with a vast expense made not only capable and
roomsome, but very magnificent and commodious, as well within as
without, nor less splendidly furnished.The staircase is very elegant,
the garden handsome, the canal beautiful, but the soil dry, barren, and
miserably sandy, which flies in drifts as the wind sits.Here my Lord
was pleased to advise with me about ordering his plantations of firs,
elms, limes, etc., up his park, and in all other places and avenues.I
persuaded him to bring his park so near as to comprehend his house
within it; which he resolved upon, it being now near a mile to it.The
water furnishing the fountains, is raised by a pretty engine, or very
slight plain wheels, which likewise serve to grind his corn, from a
small cascade of the canal, the invention of Sir Samuel Morland.In my
Lord's house, and especially above the staircase, in the great hall and
some of the chambers and rooms of state, are paintings in fresco by
Signor Verrio, being the first work which he did in England.[Sidenote: NORWICH]

17th October, 1671.My Lord Henry Howard coming this night to visit my
Lord Chamberlain, and staying a day, would needs have me go with him to
Norwich, promising to convey me back, after a day or two; this, as I
could not refuse, I was not hard to be pursuaded to, having a desire to
see that famous scholar and physician, Dr.T. Browne, author of the
"_Religio Medici_" and "Vulgar Errors," now lately knighted.Thither,
then, went my Lord and I alone, in his flying chariot with six horses;
and by the way, discoursing with me of several of his concerns, he
acquainted me of his going to marry his eldest son to one of the King's
natural daughters, by the Duchess of Cleveland; by which he reckoned he
should come into mighty favor.He also told me that, though he kept that
idle creature, Mrs.B----, and would leave L200 a year to the son he had
by her, he would never marry her, and that the King himself had
cautioned him against it.All the world knows how he kept his promise,
and I was sorry at heart to hear what now he confessed to me; and that a
person and a family which I so much honored for the sake of that noble
and illustrious friend of mine, his grandfather, should dishonor and
pollute them both with those base and vicious courses he of late had
taken since the death of Sir Samuel Tuke, and that of his own virtuous
lady (my Lady Anne Somerset, sister to the Marquis); who, while they
lived, preserved this gentleman by their example and advice from those
many extravagances that impaired both his fortune and reputation.Being come to the Ducal palace, my Lord made very much of me; but I had
little rest, so exceedingly desirous he was to show me the contrivance
he had made for the entertainment of their Majesties, and the whole
Court not long before, and which, though much of it was but temporary,
apparently framed of boards only, was yet standing.As to the palace, it
is an old wretched building, and that part of it newly built of brick,
is very ill understood; so as I was of the opinion it had been much
better to have demolished all, and set it up in a better place, than to
proceed any further; for it stands in the very market-place, and, though
near a river, yet a very narrow muddy one, without any extent.Next morning, I went to see Sir Thomas Browne (with whom I had some
time corresponded by letter, though I had never seen him before); his
whole house and garden being a paradise and cabinet of rarities; and
that of the best collection, especially medals, books, plants, and
natural things.Among other curiosities, Sir Thomas had a collection of
the eggs of all the fowl and birds he could procure, that country
(especially the promontory of Norfolk) being frequented, as he said, by
several kinds which seldom or never go further into the land, as cranes,
storks, eagles, and variety of water fowl.He led me to see all the
remarkable places of this ancient city, being one of the largest, and
certainly, after London, one of the noblest of England, for its
venerable cathedral, number of stately churches, cleanness of the
streets, and buildings of flint so exquisitely headed and squared, as I
was much astonished at; but he told me they had lost the art of squaring
the flints, in which they so much excelled, and of which the churches,
best houses, and walls, are built.The Castle is an antique extent of
ground, which now they call Marsfield, and would have been a fitting
area to have placed the Ducal palace in.The suburbs are large, the
prospects sweet, with other amenities, not omitting the flower gardens,
in which all the inhabitants excel.The fabric of stuffs brings a vast
trade to this populous town.Being returned to my Lord's, who had been with me all this morning, he
advised with me concerning a plot to rebuild his house, having already,
as he said, erected a front next the street, and a left wing, and now
resolving to set up another wing and pavilion next the garden, and to
convert the bowling green into stables.My advice was, to desist from
all, and to meditate wholly on rebuilding a handsome palace at Arundel
House, in the Strand, before he proceeded further here, and then to
place this in the Castle, that ground belonging to his Lordship.I observed that most of the church yards (though some of them large
enough) were filled up with earth, or rather the congestion of dead
bodies one upon another, for want of earth, even to the very top of the
walls, and some above the walls, so as the churches seemed to be built
in pits.I returned to Euston, in Lord Henry Howard's coach,
leaving him at Norwich, in company with a very ingenious gentleman, Mr.White, whose father and mother (daughter to the late Lord Treasurer
Weston, Earl of Portland) I knew at Rome, where this gentleman was born,
and where his parents lived and died with much reputation, during their
banishment in our civil broils.Quitting Euston, I lodged this night at Newmarket,
where I found the jolly blades racing, dancing, feasting, and reveling;
more resembling a luxurious and abandoned rout, than a Christian Court.The Duke of Buckingham was now in mighty favor, and had with him that
impudent woman, the Countess of Shrewsbury, with his band of fiddlers,
etc.Next morning, in company with Sir Bernard Gascoyne, and Lord Hawley, I
came in the Treasurer's coach to Bishop Stortford, where he gave us a
noble supper.The following day, to London, and so home.To Council, where Sir Charles Wheeler, late
Governor of the Leeward Islands, having been complained of for many
indiscreet managements, it was resolved, on scanning many of the
particulars, to advise his Majesty to remove him; and consult what was
to be done, to prevent these inconveniences he had brought things to.This business staid me in London almost a week, being in Council, or
Committee, every morning till the 25th.We ordered that a proclamation should be presented
to his Majesty to sign, against what Sir Charles Wheeler had done in St.Christopher's since the war, on the articles of peace at Breda.Came to visit me Sir William Haywood, a great
pretender to English antiquities.Went to see the Duke of Buckingham's ridiculous
farce and rhapsody, called the "The Recital,"[29] buffooning all plays,
yet profane enough.[Footnote 29: The well-known play of "The Rehearsal" is meant.]The Councillors of the Board of Trade dined together
at the Cock, in Suffolk street.His Majesty renewed us our lease of Sayes Court
pastures for ninety-nine years, but ought, according to his solemn
promise[30] (as I hope he will still perform), have passed them to us in
fee-farm.[Footnote 30: The King's engagement, under his hand, is now at
    Wotton.][Sidenote: LONDON]

23d January, 1672.To London, in order to Sir Richard Browne, my
father-in-law, resigning his place as Clerk of the Council to Joseph
Williamson, Esq., who was admitted, and was knighted.This place his
Majesty had promised to give me many years before; but, upon
consideration of the renewal of our lease and other reasons, I chose to
part with it to Sir Joseph, who gave us and the rest of his brother
clerks a handsome supper at his house; and, after supper, a concert of
music.An extraordinary snow; part of the week was taken up
in consulting about the commission of prisoners of war, and instructions
to our officers, in order to a second war with the Hollanders, his
Majesty having made choice of the former commissioners, and myself among
them.In the afternoon, that famous proselyte, Monsieur
Brevall, preached at the Abbey, in English, extremely well and with much
eloquence.He had been a Capuchin, but much better learned than most of
that order.At the Council, we entered on inquiries about
improving the plantations by silks, galls, flax, senna, etc., and
considered how nutmegs and cinnamon might be obtained and brought to
Jamaica, that soil and climate promising success.Worsley being
called in, spoke many considerable things to encourage it.We took order
to send to the plantations, that none of their ships should adventure
homeward single, but stay for company and convoys.We also deliberated
on some fit person to go as commissioner to inspect their actions in New
England, and, from time to time, report how that people stood affected.Parr, of Camberwell, preached a most pathetic
funeral discourse and panegyric at the interment of our late pastor, Dr.Breton (who died on the 18th), on "Happy is the servant whom, when his
Lord cometh," etc.This good man, among other expressions, professed
that he had never been so touched and concerned at any loss as at this,
unless at that of King Charles our martyr, and Archbishop Usher, whose
chaplain he had been.Breton had preached on the 28th and 30th of
January: on the Friday, having fasted all day, making his provisionary
sermon for the Sunday following, he went well to bed; but was taken
suddenly ill and expired before help could come to him.Never had a parish a greater loss, not only as he was an excellent
preacher, and fitted for our great and vulgar auditory, but for his
excellent life and charity, his meekness and obliging nature,
industrious, helpful, and full of good works.He left near L400 to the
poor in his will, and that what children of his should die in their
minority, their portion should be so employed, I lost in particular a
special friend, and one that had an extraordinary love for me and mine.[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th February, 1672.To London, to speak with the Bishop, and Sir John
Cutler, our patron, to present Mr.Frampton (afterward Bishop of
Gloucester).A full Council of Plantations, on the danger of the
Leeward Islands, threatened by the French, who had taken some of our
ships, and began to interrupt our trade.Also in debate, whether the new
Governor of St.Christopher should be subordinate to the Governor of
Barbadoes.Now was the first blow given by us to the Dutch convoy
of the Smyrna fleet, by Sir Robert Holmes and Lord Ossory, in which we
received little save blows, and a worthy reproach for attacking our
neighbors ere any war was proclaimed, and then pretending the occasion
to be, that some time before, the Merlin yacht chancing to sail through
the whole Dutch fleet, their Admiral did not strike to that trifling
vessel.Surely, this was a quarrel slenderly grounded, and not becoming
Christian neighbors.Lord Ossory
several times deplored to me his being engaged in it; he had more
justice and honor than in the least to approve of it, though he had been
over-persuaded to the expedition.There is no doubt but we should have
surprised this exceeding rich fleet, had not the avarice and ambition of
Holmes and Spragge separated themselves, and willfully divided our
fleet, on presumption that either of them was strong enough to deal with
the Dutch convoy without joining and mutual help; but they so warmly
plied our divided fleets, that while in conflict the merchants sailed
away, and got safe into Holland.A few days before this, the Treasurer of the Household, Sir Thomas
Clifford, hinted to me, as a confidant, that his Majesty would SHUT UP
THE EXCHEQUER (and, accordingly, his Majesty made use of infinite
treasure there, to prepare for an intended rupture); but, says he, it
will soon be open again, and everybody satisfied; for this bold man, who
had been the sole adviser of the King to invade that sacred stock
(though some pretend it was Lord Ashley's counsel, then Chancellor of
the Exchequer), was so over-confident of the success of this unworthy
design against the Smyrna merchants, as to put his Majesty on an action
which not only lost the hearts of his subjects, and ruined many widows
and orphans, whose stocks were lent him, but the reputation of his
Exchequer forever, it being before in such credit, that he might have
commanded half the wealth of the nation.The credit of this bank being thus broken, did exceedingly discontent
the people, and never did his Majesty's affairs prosper to any purpose
after it, for as it did not supply the expense of the meditated war, so
it melted away, I know not how.To this succeeded the King's declaration for an universal toleration;
<DW7>s and swarms of Sectaries, now boldly showing themselves in their
public meetings.This was imputed to the same council, Clifford warping
to Rome as was believed, nor was Lord Arlington clear of suspicion, to
gratify that party, but as since it has proved, and was then evidently
foreseen, to the extreme weakening of the Church of England and its
Episcopal Government, as it was projected.I speak not this as my own
sense, but what was the discourse and thoughts of others, who were
lookers-on; for I think there might be some relaxations without the
least prejudice to the present establishment, discreetly limited, but to
let go the reins in this manner, and then to imagine they could take
them up again as easily, was a false policy, and greatly destructive.The truth is, our Bishops slipped the occasion; for, had they held a
steady hand upon his Majesty's restoration, as they might easily have
done, the Church of England had emerged and flourished, without
interruption; but they were then remiss, and covetous after advantages
of another kind while his Majesty suffered them to come into a harvest,
with which, without any injustice he might have remunerated innumerable
gallant gentlemen for their services who had ruined themselves in the
late rebellion.I visited the coasts in my district of Kent, and
divers wounded and languishing poor men, that had been in the Smyrna
conflict.I went over to see the new-begun Fort of Tilbury; a royal
work, indeed, and such as will one day bridle a great city to the
purpose, before they are aware.Captain Cox, one of the Commissioners of the Navy,
furnishing me with a yatch, I sailed to Sheerness to see that fort also,
now newly finished; several places on both sides the Swale and Medway to
Gillingham and Upnore, being also provided with redoubts and batteries
to secure the station of our men-of-war at Chatham, and shut the door
when the steeds were stolen.I saw the chirurgeon cut off the leg of a wounded
sailor, the stout and gallant man enduring it with incredible patience,
without being bound to his chair, as usual on such painful occasions.I
had hardly courage enough to be present.Not being cut off high enough
the gangrene prevailed, and the second operation cost the poor creature
his life.what miseries are mortal men subject to, and what confusion and
mischief do the avarice, anger, and ambition of Princes, cause in the
world!I proceeded to Canterbury, Dover, Deal, the Isle of
Thanet, by Sandwich, and so to Margate.Here we had abundance of
miserably wounded men, his Majesty sending his chief chirurgeon,
Sergeant Knight, to meet me, and Dr.Waldrond had attended me all the
journey.Having taken order for the accommodation of the wounded, I came
back through a country the best cultivated of any that in my life I had
anywhere seen, every field lying as even as a bowling-green, and the
fences, plantations, and husbandry, in such admirable order, as
infinitely delighted me, after the sad and afflicting spectacles and
objects I was come from.Observing almost every tall tree to have a
weathercock on the top bough, and some trees half-a-dozen, I learned
that, on a certain holyday, the farmers feast their servants; at which
solemnity, they set up these cocks, in a kind of triumph.[Sidenote: ROCHESTER]

Being come back toward Rochester, I went to take order respecting the
building a strong and high wall about a house I had hired of a
gentleman, at a place called Hartlip, for a prison, paying L50 yearly
rent.Here I settled a Provost-Marshal and other officers, returning by
Feversham.On the 30th heard a sermon in Rochester cathedral, and so got
to Sayes Court on the first of April.I went to see the fopperies of the <DW7>s at
Somerset-House and York-House, where now the French Ambassador had
caused to be represented our Blessed Savior at the Pascal Supper with
his disciples, in figures and puppets made as big as the life, of
wax-work, curiously clad and sitting round a large table, the room nobly
hung, and shining with innumerable lamps and candles: this was exposed
to all the world; all the city came to see it.Such liberty had the
Roman Catholics at this time obtained.Sat in Council, preparing Lord Willoughby's commission
and instructions as Governor of Barbadoes and the Caribbee Islands.At Council, preparing instructions for Colonel
Stapleton, now to go Governor of St.Christopher's, and heard the
complaints of the Jamaica merchants against the Spaniards, for hindering
them from cutting logwood on the mainland, where they have no pretense.To my Lord of Canterbury, to entreat him to engage Sir
John Cutler, the patron, to provide us a grave and learned man, in
opposition to a novice.Treasurer Clifford's new honor,
being made a Baron.My son, John, was specially admitted of the Middle Temple
by Sir Francis North, his Majesty's Solicitor-General, and since
Chancellor.I pray God bless this beginning, my intention being that he
should seriously apply himself to the study of the law.I was ordered, by letter from the Council, to repair
forthwith to his Majesty, whom I found in the Pall-Mall, in St.James's
Park, where his Majesty coming to me from the company, commanded me to
go immediately to the seacoast, and to observe the motion of the Dutch
fleet and ours, the Duke and so many of the flower of our nation being
now under sail, coming from Portsmouth, through the Downs, where it was
believed there might be an encounter.Heard a sermon in Rochester
Cathedral.Bargrave, my old
fellow-traveler in Italy, and great virtuoso.To Dover; but the fleet did not appear till the 16th,
when the Duke of York with his and the French squadron, in all 170 ships
(of which above 100 were men-of-war), sailed by, after the Dutch, who
were newly withdrawn.Such a gallant and formidable navy never, I think,
spread sail upon the seas.It was a goodly yet terrible sight, to behold
them as I did, passing eastward by the straits between Dover and Calais
in a glorious day.The wind was yet so high, that I could not well go
aboard, and they were soon got out of sight.The next day, having
visited our prisoners and the Castle, and saluted the Governor, I took
horse for Margate.Here, from the North Foreland Lighthouse top (which
is a pharos, built of brick, and having on the top a cradle of iron, in
which a man attends a great sea-coal fire all the year long, when the
nights are dark, for the safeguard of sailors), we could see our fleet
as they lay at anchor.The next morning, they weighed, and sailed out of
sight to the N. E.[Sidenote: MARGATE]

19th May, 1672.Went to Margate; and, the following day, was carried to
see a gallant widow, brought up a farmeress, and I think of gigantic
race, rich, comely, and exceedingly industrious.She put me in mind of
Deborah and Abigail, her house was so plentifully stored with all manner
of country provisions, all of her own growth, and all her conveniences
so substantial, neat, and well understood; she herself so jolly and
hospitable; and her land so trim and rarely husbanded, that it struck me
with admiration at her economy.This town much consists of brewers of a certain heady ale, and they deal
much in malt, etc.For the rest, it is raggedly built, and has an ill
haven, with a small fort of little concernment, nor is the island well
disciplined; but as to the husbandry and rural part, far exceeding any
part of England for the accurate culture of their ground, in which they
exceed, even to curiosity and emulation.We passed by Rickborough, and in sight of Reculvers, and so through a
sweet garden, as it were, to Canterbury.To London and gave his Majesty an account of my journey,
and that I had put all things in readiness upon all events, and so
returned home sufficiently wearied.I received another command to repair to the seaside; so
I went to Rochester, where I found many wounded, sick, and prisoners,
newly put on shore after the engagement on the 28th, in which the Earl
of Sandwich, that incomparable person and my particular friend, and
divers more whom I loved, were lost.My Lord (who was Admiral of the
Blue) was in the "Prince," which was burnt, one of the best men-of-war
that ever spread canvas on the sea.There were lost with this brave man,
a son of Sir Charles Cotterell (Master of the Ceremonies), and a son of
Sir Charles Harbord (his Majesty's Surveyor-General), two valiant and
most accomplished youths, full of virtue and courage, who might have
saved themselves; but chose to perish with my Lord, whom they honored
and loved above their own lives.Here, I cannot but make some reflections on things past.It was not
above a day or two that going to Whitehall to take leave of his
Lordship, who had his lodgings in the Privy-Garden, shaking me by the
hand he bid me good-by, and said he thought he would see me no more, and
I saw, to my thinking, something boding in his countenance: "No," says
he, "they will not have me live.Had I lost a fleet (meaning on his
return from Bergen when he took the East India prize) I should have
fared better; but, be as it pleases God--I must do something, I know not
what, to save my reputation."Something to this effect, he had hinted to
me; thus I took my leave.I well remember that the Duke of Albemarle,
and my now Lord Clifford, had, I know not why, no great opinion of his
courage, because, in former conflicts, being an able and experienced
seaman (which neither of them were), he always brought off his Majesty's
ships without loss, though not without as many marks of true courage as
the stoutest of them; and I am a witness that, in the late war, his own
ship was pierced like a colander.But the business was, he was utterly
against this war from the beginning, and abhorred the attacking of the
Smyrna fleet; he did not favor the heady expedition of Clifford at
Bergen, nor was he so furious and confident as was the Duke of
Albemarle, who believed he could vanquish the Hollanders with one
squadron.My Lord Sandwich was prudent as well as valiant, and always
governed his affairs with success and little loss; he was for
deliberation and reason, they for action and slaughter without either;
and for this, whispered as if my Lord Sandwich was not so gallant,
because he was not so rash, and knew how fatal it was to lose a fleet,
such as was that under his conduct, and for which these very persons
would have censured him on the other side.This it was, I am confident,
grieved him, and made him enter like a lion, and fight like one too, in
the midst of the hottest service, where the stoutest of the rest seeing
him engaged, and so many ships upon him, dared not, or would not, come
to his succor, as some of them, whom I know, might have done.Thus, this
gallant person perished, to gratify the pride and envy of some I named.Deplorable was the loss of one of the best accomplished persons, not
only of this nation, but of any other.He was learned in sea affairs, in
politics, in mathematics, and in music: he had been on divers embassies,
was of a sweet and obliging temper, sober, chaste, very ingenious, a
true nobleman, an ornament to the Court and his Prince; nor has he left
any behind him who approach his many virtues.He had, I confess, served the tyrant Cromwell, when a young man, but it
was without malice, as a soldier of fortune; and he readily submitted,
and that with joy, bringing an entire fleet with him from the Sound, at
the first tidings of his Majesty's restoration.I verily believe him as
faithful a subject as any that were not his friends.I am yet heartily
grieved at this mighty loss, nor do I call it to my thoughts without
emotion.[Sidenote: ROCHESTER]

2d June, 1672.Trinity Sunday, I passed at Rochester; and, on the 5th,
there was buried in the Cathedral Monsieur Rabiniere, Rear Admiral of
the French squadron, a gallant person, who died of the wounds he
received in the fight.This ceremony lay on me, which I performed with
all the decency I could, inviting the Mayor and Aldermen to come in
their formalities.Sir Jonas Atkins was there with his guards; and the
Dean and Prebendaries: one of his countrymen pronouncing a funeral
oration at the brink of his grave, which I caused to be dug in the
choir.This is more at large described in the "Gazette" of that day;
Colonel Reymes, my colleague in commission, assisting, who was so kind
as to accompany me from London, though it was not his district; for
indeed the stress of both these wars lay more on me by far than on any
of my brethren, who had little to do in theirs.I went to see Upnore
Castle, which I found pretty well defended, but of no great moment.Next day I sailed to the fleet, now riding at the buoy of the "Nore,"
where I met his Majesty, the Duke, Lord Arlington, and all the great
men, in the "Charles," lying miserably shattered; but the miss of Lord
Sandwich redoubled the loss to me, and showed the folly of hazarding so
brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for no provocation but that
the Hollanders exceeded us in industry, and in all things but envy.At Sheerness, I gave his Majesty and his Royal Highness an account of my
charge, and returned to Queenborough; next day dined at Major Dorel's,
Governor of Sheerness; thence, to Rochester; and the following day,
home.To London to his Majesty, to solicit for money for the
sick and wounded, which he promised me.Most of this week busied
with the sick and wounded.To Lord Sandwich's funeral, which was by water to
Westminster, in solemn pomp.I entertained the Maids of Honor (among whom there was
one I infinitely esteemed for her many and extraordinary virtues[31]) at
a comedy this afternoon, and so went home.Blagg whom Evelyn never tires of instancing and
    characterizing as a rare example of piety and virtue, in so rare a
    wit, beauty, and perfection, in a licentious court, and depraved
    age.Godolphin, and her life,
    written by Evelyn, has been edited and published by the Bishop of
    Oxford.]I was at the betrothal of Lord Arlington's only
daughter (a sweet child if ever there was any[32]) to the Duke of
Grafton, the King's natural son by the Duchess of Cleveland; the
Archbishop of Canterbury officiating, the King and the grandees being
present.I had a favor given me by my Lady; but took no great joy at the
thing for many reasons.[Footnote 32: She was then only fifteen years old.]Sir James Hayes, Secretary to Prince Rupert, dined
with me; after dinner I was sent to Gravesend to dispose of no fewer
than 800 sick men.That night I got to the fleet at the buoy of the
"Nore," where I spoke with the King and the Duke; and, after dinner next
day, returned to Gravesend.I spent this week in soliciting for moneys, and in
reading to my Lord Clifford my papers relating to the first Holland war.Now, our Council of Plantations met at Lord Shaftesbury's (Chancellor of
the Exchequer) to read and reform the draft of our new Patent, joining
the Council of Trade to our political capacities.After this, I returned
home, in order to another excursion to the seaside, to get as many as
possible of the men who were recovered on board the fleet.I lay at Gravesend, thence to Rochester, returning
on the 11th.Duport, Greek Professor of Cambridge, preached
before the King, on 1 Timothy vi.No great preacher, but a very
worthy and learned man.I dined at Lord John Berkeley's, newly arrived
out of Ireland, where he had been Deputy; it was in his new house, or
rather palace; for I am assured it stood him in near L30,000.It was
very well built, and has many noble rooms, but they are not very
convenient, consisting but of one _Corps de Logis_; they are all rooms
of state, without closets.The staircase is of cedar, the furniture is
princely: the kitchen and stables are ill placed, and the corridor
worse, having no report to the wings they join to.For the rest, the
fore-court is noble, so are the stables; and, above all, the gardens,
which are incomparable by reason of the inequality of the ground, and a
pretty piscina.The holly hedges on the terrace I advised the planting
of.The porticos are in imitation of a house described by Palladio; but
it happens to be the worst in his book, though my good friend, Mr.Hugh
May, his Lordship's architect, effected it.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th September, 1672.I carried with me to dinner my Lord H. Howard (now
to be made Earl of Norwich and Earl Marshal of England) to Sir Robert
Clayton's, now Sheriff of London, at his new house, where we had a great
feast; it is built indeed for a great magistrate, at excessive cost.The
cedar dining room is painted with the history of the Giants' War,
incomparably done by Mr.Streeter, but the figures are too near the eye.Thistlethwaite preached at Whitehall on Rev.2,--a young, but good preacher.Blandford, Bishop of Worcester, and Dean of the Chapel, officiating.Dined at my Lord Clifford's, with Lord Mulgrave, Sir Gilbert Talbot, and
Sir Robert Holmes.I took leave of my Lady Sunderland, who was going to
Paris to my Lord, now ambassador there.She made me stay to dinner at
Leicester House, and afterward sent for Richardson, the famous
fire-eater.He devoured brimstone on glowing coals before us, chewing
and swallowing them; he melted a beer-glass and ate it quite up; then,
taking a live coal on his tongue, he put on it a raw oyster, the coal
was blown on with bellows till it flamed and sparkled in his mouth, and
so remained till the oyster gaped and was quite boiled.Then, he melted
pitch and wax with sulphur, which he drank down as it flamed; I saw it
flaming in his mouth a good while; he also took up a thick piece of
iron, such as laundresses use to put in their smoothing boxes, when it
was fiery hot, held it between his teeth, then in his hand, and threw it
about like a stone; but this, I observed, he cared not to hold very
long; then he stood on a small pot, and, bending his body, took a
glowing iron with his mouth from between his feet, without touching the
pot, or ground, with his hands; with divers other prodigious feats.After sermon (being summoned before), I went to my
Lord Keeper's, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, at Essex House, where our new
patent was opened and read, constituting us that were of the Council of
Plantations, to be now of the Council of Trade also, both united.After
the patent was read, we all took our oaths, and departed.Met in Council, the Earl of Shaftesbury, now our
president, swearing our secretary and his clerks, which was Mr.Locke,
an excellent learned gentleman, and student of Christ Church, Mr.We dispatched a letter to Sir Thomas Linch, Governor of
Jamaica, giving him notice of a design of the Dutch on that island.I went to hear that famous preacher, Dr.Giles's, on Psalm xxxix.This divine had been twice at
Jerusalem, and was not only a very pious and holy man, but excellent in
the pulpit for the moving affections.At Council, we debated the business of the consulate
of Leghorn.I was of the committee with Sir Humphry Winch, the chairman,
to examine the laws of his Majesty's several plantations and colonies in
the West Indies, etc.Many merchants were summoned about the consulate of
Venice; which caused great disputes; the most considerable thought it
useless.This being the Queen-Consort's birthday, there was an
extraordinary appearance of gallantry, and a ball danced at Court.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st January, 1672-73.After public prayers in the chapel at Whitehall,
when I gave God solemn thanks for all his mercies to me the year past,
and my humble supplications to him for his blessing the year now
entering, I returned home, having my poor deceased servant (Adams) to
bury, who died of pleurisy.My son now published his version of "_Raptinus
Hortorum_."Visited Don Francisco de Melos, the Portugal
Ambassador, who showed me his curious collection of books and pictures.He was a person of good parts, and a virtuous man.To Council about reforming an abuse of the dyers
with _saundus_, and other false drugs; examined divers of that trade.The Bishop of Chichester preached before the King
on Coloss.14, 15, admirably well, as he can do nothing but what is
well.Holden, preached in Whitehall
chapel, on Psalm iv.This gentleman is a very excellent and
universal scholar, a good and wise man; but he had not the popular way
of preaching, nor is in any measure fit for our plain and vulgar
auditory, as his predecessor was.There was, however, no comparison
between their parts for profound learning.But time and experience may
form him to a more practical way than that he is in of University
lectures and erudition; which is now universally left off for what is
much more profitable.I heard the speech made to the Lords in their House by
Sir Samuel Tuke, in behalf of the <DW7>s, to take off the penal laws;
and then dined with Colonel Norwood.Pearson, Bishop of Chester, preached on Hebrews
ix.14; a most incomparable sermon from one of the most learned divines
of our nation.I dined at my Lord Arlington's with the Duke and Duchess
of Monmouth; she is one of the wisest and craftiest of her sex, and has
much wit.Here was also the learned Isaac Vossius.During Lent there is constantly the most excellent preaching by the most
eminent bishops and divines of the nation.I was sworn a younger brother of the Trinity House,
with my most worthy and long-acquainted noble friend, Lord Ossory
(eldest son to the Duke of Ormond), Sir Richard Browne, my
father-in-law, being now Master of that Society; after which there was a
great collation.I carried my son to the Bishop of Chichester, that
learned and pious man, Dr.Peter Gunning, to be instructed by him before
he received the Holy Sacrament, when he gave him most excellent advice,
which I pray God may influence and remain with him as long as he lives;
and O that I had been so blessed and instructed, when first I was
admitted to that sacred ordinance!Myself and son received the blessed
Communion, it being his first time, and with that whole week's more
extraordinary preparation.I beseech God to make him a sincere and good
Christian, while I endeavor to instill into him the fear and love of
God, and discharge the duty of a father.At the sermon _coram Rege_, preached by Dr.Sparrow, Bishop of Exeter,
to a most crowded auditory; I stayed to see whether, according to
custom, the Duke of York received the Communion with the King; but he
did not, to the amazement of everybody.This being the second year he
had forborne, and put it off, and within a day of the Parliament
sitting, who had lately made so severe an Act against the increase of
Popery, gave exceeding grief and scandal to the whole nation, that the
heir of it, and the son of a martyr for the Protestant religion, should
apostatize.What the consequence of this will be, God only knows, and
wise men dread.I dined with the plenipotentiaries designed for the
treaty of Nimeguen.I carried Lady Tuke to thank the Countess of Arlington
for speaking to his Majesty in her behalf, for being one of the Queen
Consort's women.She carried us up into her new dressing room at Goring
House, where was a bed, two glasses, silver jars, and vases, cabinets,
and other so rich furniture as I had seldom seen; to this excess of
superfluity were we now arrived and that not only at Court, but almost
universally, even to wantonness and profusion.Compton, brother to the Earl of Northampton, preached on 1 Corinth.11-16, showing the Church's power in ordaining things indifferent;
this worthy person's talent is not preaching, but he is likely to make a
grave and serious good man.I saw her Majesty's rich toilet in her dressing room, being all of massy
gold, presented to her by the King, valued at L4,000.Martin's the Holy
Sacrament following, which I partook of, upon obligation of the late Act
of Parliament, enjoining everybody in office, civil or military, under
penalty of L500, to receive it within one month before two authentic
witnesses; being engrossed on parchment, to be afterward produced in the
Court of Chancery, or some other Court of Record; which I did at the
Chancery bar, as being one of the Council of Plantations and Trade;
taking then also the oath of allegiance and supremacy, signing the
clause in the said Act against Transubstantiation.My son was made a younger brother of the Trinity House.The new master was Sir J. Smith, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, a
stout seaman, who had interposed and saved the Duke from perishing by a
fire ship in the late war.I carried one Withers, an ingenious shipwright, to the
King to show him some new method of building.I saw the Italian comedy at the Court, this afternoon.Came to visit and dine with me my Lord Viscount
Cornbury and his Lady; Lady Frances Hyde, sister to the Duchess of York;
and Mrs.We went, after dinner, to see
the formal and formidable camp on Blackheath, raised to invade Holland;
or, as others suspected for another design.Thence, to the Italian
glass-house at Greenwich, where glass was blown of finer metal than that
of Murano, at Venice.Came to visit us, with other ladies of rank, Mrs.Sedley,[33] daughter to Sir Charles, who was none of the most virtuous,
but a wit.[Footnote 33: The Duke of York's mistress, afterward created by him
    Countess of Dorchester.]Congratulated the new Lord Treasurer, Sir Thomas
Osborne, a gentleman with whom I had been intimately acquainted at
Paris, and who was every day at my father-in-law's house and table
there; on which account I was too confident of succeeding in his favor,
as I had done in his predecessor's; but such a friend shall I never
find, and I neglected my time, far from believing that my Lord Clifford
would have so rashly laid down his staff, as he did, to the amazement of
all the world, when it came to the test of his receiving the Communion,
which I am confident he forbore more from some promise he had entered
into to gratify the Duke, than from any prejudice to the Protestant
religion, though I found him wavering a pretty while.[Sidenote: LONDON]

23d June, 1673.To London, to accompany our Council who went in a body
to congratulate the new Lord Treasurer, no friend to it because promoted
by my Lord Arlington, whom he hated.Came visitors from Court to dine with me and see the
army still remaining encamped on Blackheath.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th July, 1673.This evening I went to the funeral of my dear and
excellent friend, that good man and accomplished gentleman, Sir Robert
Murray, Secretary of Scotland.He was buried by order of his Majesty in
Westminster Abbey.I went to Tunbridge Wells, to visit my Lord Clifford,
late Lord Treasurer, who was there to divert his mind more than his
body; it was believed that he had so engaged himself to the Duke, that
rather than take the Test, without which he was not capable of holding
any office, he would resign that great and honorable station.This, I am
confident, grieved him to the heart, and at last broke it; for, though
he carried with him music, and people to divert him, and, when I came to
see him, lodged me in his own apartment, and would not let me go from
him, I found he was struggling in his mind; and being of a rough and
ambitious nature, he could not long brook the necessity he had brought
on himself, of submission to this conjuncture.Besides, he saw the Dutch
war, which was made much by his advice, as well as the shutting up of
the Exchequer, very unprosperous.These things his high spirit could not
support.Having stayed here two or three days, I obtained leave of my
Lord to return.In my way, I saw my Lord of Dorset's house at Knowle, near Sevenoaks, a
great old-fashioned house.To Council, where the business of transporting wool was
brought before us.I went to see the pictures of all the judges and
eminent men of the Long Robe, newly painted by Mr.Wright, and set up in
Guildhall, costing the city L1,000.Most of them are very like the
persons they represent, though I never took Wright to be any
considerable artist.I rode to Durdans, where I dined at my Lord
Berkeley's of Berkeley Castle, my old and noble friend, it being his
wedding anniversary, where I found the Duchess of Albemarle, and other
company, and returned home on that evening late.Came to visit me my Lord Chancellor, the Earl of
Shaftesbury.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th August, 1673.My Lord Clifford, being about this time returned
from Tunbridge, and preparing for Devonshire, I went to take my leave of
him at Wallingford House; he was packing up pictures, most of which were
of hunting wild beasts and vast pieces of bull-baiting, bear-baiting,
etc.I found him in his study, and restored to him several papers of
state, and others of importance, which he had furnished me with, on
engaging me to write the "History of the Holland War," with other
private letters of his acknowledgments to my Lord Arlington, who from a
private gentleman of a very noble family, but inconsiderable fortune,
had advanced him from almost nothing.The first thing was his being in
Parliament, then knighted, then made one of the Commissioners of sick
and wounded, on which occasion we sat long together; then, on the death
of Hugh Pollard, he was made Comptroller of the Household and Privy
Councillor, yet still my brother Commissioner; after the death of Lord
Fitz-Harding, Treasurer of the Household, he, by letters to Lord
Arlington, which that Lord showed me, begged of his Lordship to obtain
it for him as the very height of his ambition.These were written with
such submissions and professions of his patronage, as I had never seen
any more acknowledging.The Earl of Southampton then dying, he was made
one of the Commissioners of the Treasury.His Majesty inclining to put
it into one hand, my Lord Clifford, under pretense of making all his
interest for his patron, my Lord Arlington, cut the grass under his
feet, and procured it for himself, assuring the King that Lord Arlington
did not desire it.Indeed, my Lord Arlington protested to me that his
confidence in Lord Clifford made him so remiss and his affection to him
was so particular, that he was absolutely minded to devolve it on Lord
Clifford, all the world knowing how he himself affected ease and quiet,
now growing into years, yet little thinking of this go-by.This was the
great ingratitude Lord Clifford showed, keeping my Lord Arlington in
ignorance, continually assuring him he was pursuing his interest, which
was the Duke's into whose great favor Lord Clifford was now gotten; but
which certainly cost him the loss of all, namely, his going so
irrevocably far in his interest.For the rest, my Lord Clifford was a valiant, incorrupt gentleman,
ambitious, not covetous; generous, passionate, a most constant, sincere
friend, to me in particular, so as when he laid down his office, I was
at the end of all my hopes and endeavors.These were not for high
matters, but to obtain what his Majesty was really indebted to my
father-in-law, which was the utmost of my ambition, and which I had
undoubtedly obtained, if this friend had stood.Sir Thomas Osborn, who
succeeded him, though much more obliged to my father-in-law and his
family, and my long and old acquaintance, being of a more haughty and
far less obliging nature, I could hope for little; a man of excellent
natural parts; but nothing of generous or grateful.Taking leave of my Lord Clifford, he wrung me by the hand, and, looking
earnestly on me, bid me God-b'ye, adding, "Mr.Evelyn, I shall never see
thee more."said I, "my Lord, what's the meaning of this?I hope I
shall see you often, and as great a person again."Evelyn, do
not expect it, I will never see this place, this city, or Court again,"
or words of this sound.In this manner, not without almost mutual tears,
I parted from him; nor was it long after, but the news was that he was
dead, and I have heard from some who I believe knew, he made himself
away, after an extraordinary melancholy.This is not confidently
affirmed, but a servant who lived in the house, and afterward with Sir
Robert Clayton, Lord Mayor, did, as well as others, report it, and when
I hinted some such thing to Mr.Prideaux, one of his trustees, he was
not willing to enter into that discourse.It was reported with these particulars, that, causing his servant to
leave him unusually one morning, locking himself in, he strangled
himself with his cravat upon the bed-tester; his servant, not liking the
manner of dismissing him, and looking through the keyhole (as I
remember), and seeing his master hanging, broke in before he was quite
dead, and taking him down, vomiting a great deal of blood, he was heard
to utter these words: "Well; let men say what they will, there is a God,
a just God above"; after which he spoke no more.This, if true, is
dismal.Really, he was the chief occasion of the Dutch war, and of all
that blood which was lost at Bergen in attacking the Smyrna fleet, and
that whole quarrel.This leads me to call to mind what my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury
affirmed, not to me only, but to all my brethren the Council of Foreign
Plantations, when not long after, this accident being mentioned as we
were one day sitting in Council, his Lordship told us this remarkable
passage: that, being one day discoursing with him when he was only Sir
Thomas Clifford, speaking of men's advancement to great charges in the
nation, "Well," says he, "my Lord, I shall be one of the greatest men in
England.Don't impute what I say either to fancy, or vanity; I am
certain that I shall be a mighty man; but it will not last long; I shall
not hold it, but die a bloody death.""What," says my Lord, "your
horoscope tells you so?""No matter for that, it will be as I tell you.""Well," says my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury, "if I were of that opinion,
I either would not be a great man, but decline preferment, or prevent my
danger."This my Lord affirmed in my hearing before several gentlemen and
noblemen sitting in council at Whitehall.And I the rather am confident
of it, remembering what Sir Edward Walker (Garter King-at-Arms) had
likewise affirmed to me a long time before, even when he was first made
a Lord; that carrying his pedigree to Lord Clifford on his being created
a peer, and, finding him busy, he bade him go into his study and divert
himself there till he was at leisure to discourse with him about some
things relating to his family; there lay, said Sir Edward, on his table,
his horoscope and nativity calculated, with some writing under it, where
he read that he should be advanced to the highest degree in the state
that could be conferred upon him, but that he should not long enjoy it,
but should die, or expressions to that sense; and I think, (but cannot
confidently say) a bloody death.This Sir Edward affirmed both to me and
Sir Richard Browne; nor could I forbear to note this extraordinary
passage in these memoirs.Creighton, son to the late eloquent Bishop of
Bath and Wells, preached to the Household on Isaiah, lvii.I procured L4,000 of the Lords of the Treasury,
and rectified divers matters about the sick and wounded.Bernard
Grenville, at Abs Court in Surrey; an old house in a pretty park.I went to see Paradise, a room in Hatton Garden
furnished with a representation of all sorts of animals handsomely
painted on boards or cloth, and so cut out and made to stand, move, fly,
crawl, roar, and make their several cries.The man who showed it, made
us laugh heartily at his formal poetry.To Council, about sending succors to recover New
York: and then we read the commission and instructions to Sir Jonathan
Atkins, the new Governor of Barbadoes.This night the youths of the city burned the Pope in
effigy, after they had made procession with it in great triumph, they
being displeased at the Duke for altering his religion and marrying an
Italian lady.Andrew's day I first saw the new Duchess of
York, and the Duchess of Modena, her mother.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st December, 1673.To Gresham College, whither the city had invited the
Royal Society by many of their chief aldermen and magistrates, who gave
us a collation, to welcome us to our first place of assembly, from
whence we had been driven to give place to the City, on their making it
their Exchange on the dreadful conflagration, till their new Exchange
was finished, which it now was.The Society having till now been
entertained and having met at Arundel House.I dined with some friends, and visited the sick;
thence, to an almshouse, where was prayers and relief, some very ill and
miserable.It was one of the best days I ever spent in my life.There was at dinner my Lord Lockhart, designed
Ambassador for France, a gallant and sober person.I saw again the Italian Duchess and her brother, the
Prince Reynaldo.I had some discourse with certain strangers, not
unlearned, who had been born not far from Old Nineveh; they assured me
of the ruins being still extant, and vast and wonderful were the
buildings, vaults, pillars, and magnificent fragments;[34] but they
could say little of the Tower of Babel that satisfied me.But the
description of the amenity and fragrancy of the country for health and
cheerfulness, delighted me; so sensibly they spoke of the excellent air
and climate in respect of our cloudy and splenetic country.[Footnote 34: The remarkable discoveries of Mr.Layard give now a
    curious interest to this notice by Evelyn.]Visited the prisoners at Ludgate, taking orders
about the releasing of some.I gave Almighty God thanks for his infinite
goodness to me the year past, and begged his mercy and protection the
year following; afterward, invited my neighbors to spend the day with
me.I saw an Italian opera in music, the first that
had been in England of this kind.Sent for by his Majesty to write something against
the Hollanders about the duty of the Flag and Fishery.I dined at Knightsbridge, with the Bishops of
Salisbury, Chester, and Lincoln, my old friends.Demalhoy,
Roger L'Estrange, and several of my friends, came to dine with me on the
happy occasion.Dryden, the famous poet and now laureate, came to
give me a visit.It was the anniversary of my marriage, and the first
day I went into my new little cell and cabinet, which I built below
toward the south court, at the east end of the parlor.Jacombe's son's share in
the mill and land at Deptford, which I bought of the Beechers.I went to Windsor with my wife and son to see my
daughter Mary, who was there with my Lady Tuke and to do my duty to his
Majesty.Next day, to a great entertainment at Sir Robert Holmes's at
Cranbourne Lodge, in the Forest; there were his Majesty, the Queen,
Duke, Duchess, and all the Court.I returned in the evening with Sir
Joseph Williamson, now declared Secretary of State.He was son of a poor
clergyman somewhere in Cumberland, brought up at Queen's College,
Oxford, of which he came to be a fellow; then traveled with... and
returning when the King was restored, was received as a clerk under Mr.Sir Henry Bennett (now Lord Arlington) succeeding,
Williamson is transferred to him, who loving his ease more than business
(though sufficiently able had he applied himself to it) remitted all to
his man Williamson; and, in a short time, let him so into the secret of
affairs, that (as his Lordship himself told me) there was a kind of
necessity to advance him; and so, by his subtlety, dexterity, and
insinuation, he got now to be principal Secretary; absolutely Lord
Arlington's creature, and ungrateful enough.It has been the fate of
this obliging favorite to advance those who soon forgot their original.Sir Joseph was a musician, could play at _Jeu de Goblets_, exceedingly
formal, a severe master to his servants, but so inward with my Lord
O'Brien, that after a few months of that gentleman's death, he married
his widow,[35] who, being sister and heir of the Duke of Richmond,
brought him a noble fortune.It was thought they lived not so kindly
after marriage as they did before.She was much censured for marrying so
meanly, being herself allied to the Royal family.[Footnote 35: Lady Catherine Stuart, sister and heir to Charles
    Stuart, Duke of Richmond and Lennox, the husband of Mrs.Frances
    Stuart, one of the most admired beauties of the Court, with whom
    Charles II.was so deeply in love that he never forgave the Duke for
    marrying her, having already, it is thought, formed some similar
    intention himself.He took the first opportunity of sending the Duke
    into an honorable exile, as Ambassador to Denmark, where he shortly
    after died, leaving no issue by the Duchess.][Sidenote: GROOMBRIDGE]

6th August, 1674.I went to Groombridge, to see my old friend, Mr.Packer; the house built within a moat, in a woody valley.The old house
had been the place of confinement of the Duke of Orleans, taken by one
Waller (whose house it then was) at the battle of Agincourt, now
demolished, and a new one built in its place, though a far better
situation had been on the south of the wood, on a graceful ascent.At
some small distance, is a large chapel, not long since built by Mr.Packer's father, on a vow he made to do it on the return of King Charles
I. out of Spain, 1625, and dedicated to St.Charles, but what saint
there was then of that name I am to seek, for, being a Protestant, I
conceive it was not Borromeo.I went to see my farm at Ripe, near Lewes.His Majesty told me how exceedingly the Dutch were
displeased at my treatise of the "History of Commerce;" that the Holland
Ambassador had complained to him of what I had touched of the Flags and
Fishery, etc., and desired the book might be called in; while on the
other side, he assured me he was exceedingly pleased with what I had
done, and gave me many thanks.However, it being just upon conclusion of
the treaty of Breda (indeed it was designed to have been published some
months before and when we were at defiance), his Majesty told me he must
recall it formally; but gave order that what copies should be publicly
seized to pacify the Ambassador, should immediately be restored to the
printer, and that neither he nor the vender should be molested.The
truth is, that which touched the Hollander was much less than what the
King himself furnished me with, and obliged me to publish, having caused
it to be read to him before it went to press; but the error was, it
should have been published before the peace was proclaimed.The noise of
this book's suppression made it presently to be bought up, and turned
much to the stationer's advantage.It was no other than the preface
prepared to be prefixed to my "History of the Whole War;" which I now
pursued no further.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st August, 1674.In one of the meadows at the foot of the long
Terrace below the Castle [Windsor], works were thrown up to show the
King a representation of the city of Maestricht, newly taken by the
French.Bastians, bulwarks, ramparts, palisadoes, graffs, horn-works,
counter-scarps, etc., were constructed.It was attacked by the Duke of
Monmouth (newly come from the real siege) and the Duke of York, with a
little army, to show their skill in tactics.On Saturday night they made
their approaches, opened trenches, raised batteries, took the
counter-scarp and ravelin, after a stout defense; great guns fired on
both sides, grenadoes shot, mines sprung, parties sent out, attempts of
raising the siege, prisoners taken, parleys; and, in short, all the
circumstances of a formal siege, to appearance, and, what is most
strange all without disorder, or ill accident, to the great satisfaction
of a thousand spectators.The
siege being over, I went with Mr.Pepys back to London, where we arrived
about three in the morning.To Council, about fetching away the English left
at Surinam, etc., since our reconciliation with Holland.I went to see the great loss that Lord Arlington
had sustained by fire at Goring House, this night consumed to the
ground, with exceeding loss of hangings, plate, rare pictures, and
cabinets; hardly anything was saved of the best and most princely
furniture that any subject had in England.My lord and lady were both
absent at the Bath.The Lord Chief Baron Turner, and Sergeant Wild,
Recorder of London, came to visit me.At Lord Berkeley's, I discoursed with Sir Thomas
Modiford, late Governor of Jamaica, and with Colonel Morgan, who
undertook that gallant exploit from Nombre de Dios to Panama, on the
Continent of America; he told me 10,000 men would easily conquer all the
Spanish Indies, they were so secure.They took great booty, and much
greater had been taken, had they not been betrayed and so discovered
before their approach, by which the Spaniards had time to carry their
vast treasure on board ships that put off to sea in sight of our men,
who had no boats to follow.They set fire to Panama, and ravaged the
country sixty miles about.The Spaniards were so supine and unexercised,
that they were afraid to fire a great gun.My birthday, 54th year of my life.It was also preparation day for the Holy Sacrament, in which I
participated the next day, imploring God's protection for the year
following, and confirming my resolutions of a more holy life, even upon
the Holy Book.The anniversary of my baptism: I first heard that
famous and excellent preacher, Dr.Burnet, author of the "History of the
Reformation" on Colossians iii.10, with such flow of eloquence and
fullness of matter, as showed him to be a person oL extraordinary parts.Being her Majesty's birthday, the Court was exceeding splendid in
clothes and jewels, to the height of excess.To Council, on the business of Surinam, where the
Dutch had detained some English in prison, ever since the first war,
1665.I heard that stupendous violin, Signor Nicholao
(with other rare musicians), whom I never heard mortal man exceed on
that instrument.He had a stroke so sweet, and made it speak like the
voice of a man, and, when he pleased, like a concert of several
instruments.He did wonders upon a note, and was an excellent composer.Here was also that rare lutanist, Dr.Wallgrave; but nothing approached
the violin in Nicholao's hand.He played such ravishing things as
astonished us all.Slingsby's, master of the mint, my worthy
friend, a great lover of music.Heard Signor Francisco on the
harpsichord, esteemed one of the most excellent masters in Europe on
that instrument; then, came Nicholao with his violin, and struck all
mute, but Mrs.Knight, who sung incomparably, and doubtless has the
greatest reach of any English woman; she had been lately roaming in
Italy, and was much improved in that quality.Saw a comedy at night, at Court, acted by the
ladies only, among them Lady Mary and Ann, his Royal Highness' two
daughters, and my dear friend Mrs.Blagg, who, having the principal
part, performed it to admiration.Was at the repetition of the "Pastoral," on which
occasion Mrs.Blagg had about her near L20,000 worth of jewels, of which
she lost one worth about L80, borrowed of the Countess of Suffolk.The
press was so great, that it is a wonder she lost no more.Streeter, that excellent painter
of perspective and landscape, to comfort and encourage him to be cut for
the stone, with which that honest man was exceedingly afflicted.[Sidenote: LONDON]

22d March, 1675.Supped at Sir William Petty's, with the Bishop of
Salisbury, and divers honorable persons.We had a noble entertainment in
a house gloriously furnished; the master and mistress of it were
extraordinary persons.Sir William was the son of a mean man somewhere
in Sussex, and sent from school to Oxford, where he studied Philosophy,
but was most eminent in Mathematics and Mechanics; proceeded Doctor of
Physic, and was grown famous, as for his learning so for his recovering
a poor wench that had been hanged for felony; and her body having been
begged (as the custom is) for the anatomy lecture, he bled her, put her
to bed to a warm woman, and, with spirits and other means, restored her
to life.The young scholars joined and made a little portion, and
married her to a man who had several children by her, she living fifteen
years after, as I have been assured.Sir William came from Oxford to be
tutor to a neighbor of mine; thence, when the rebels were dividing their
conquests in Ireland, he was employed by them to measure and set out the
land, which he did on an easy contract, so much per acre.This he
effected so exactly, that it not only furnished him with a great sum of
money; but enabled him to purchase an estate worth L4,000 a year.He
afterward married the daughter of Sir Hardress Waller; she was an
extraordinary wit as well as beauty, and a prudent woman.Sir William, among other inventions, was author of the double-bottomed
ship, which perished, and he was censured for rashness, being lost in
the Bay of Biscay in a storm, when, I think, fifteen other vessels
miscarried.This vessel was flat-bottomed, of exceeding use to put into
shallow ports, and ride over small depths of water.It consisted of two
distinct keels cramped together with huge timbers, etc., so as that a
violent stream ran between; it bore a monstrous broad sail, and he still
persists that it is practicable, and of exceeding use; and he has often
told me he would adventure himself in such another, could he procure
sailors, and his Majesty's permission to make a second Experiment; which
name the King gave the vessel at the launching.The Map of Ireland made by Sir William Petty is believed to be the most
exact that ever yet was made of any country.He did promise to publish
it; and I am told it has cost him near L1,000 to have it engraved at
Amsterdam.There is not a better Latin poet living, when he gives
himself that diversion; nor is his excellence less in Council and
prudent matters of state; but he is so exceedingly nice in sifting and
examining all possible contingencies, that he adventures at nothing
which is not demonstration.There was not in the whole world his equal
for a superintendent of manufacture and improvement of trade, or to
govern a plantation.If I were a Prince, I should make him my second
Counsellor, at least.He is, besides,
courageous; on which account, I cannot but note a true story of him,
that when Sir Aleyn Brodrick sent him a challenge upon a difference
between them in Ireland, Sir William, though exceedingly purblind,
accepted the challenge, and it being his part to propound the weapon,
desired his antagonist to meet him with a hatchet, or axe, in a dark
cellar; which the other, of course, refused.Sir William was, with all this, facetious and of easy conversation,
friendly and courteous, and had such a faculty of imitating others, that
he would take a text and preach, now like a grave orthodox divine, then
falling into the Presbyterian way, then to the fanatical, the Quaker,
the monk and friar, the Popish priest, with such admirable action, and
alteration of voice and tone, as it was not possible to abstain from
wonder, and one would swear to hear several persons, or forbear to think
he was not in good earnest an enthusiast and almost beside himself;
then, he would fall out of it into a serious discourse; but it was very
rarely he would be prevailed on to oblige the company with this faculty,
and that only among most intimate friends.My Lord Duke of Ormond once
obtained it of him, and was almost ravished with admiration; but by and
by, he fell upon a serious reprimand of the faults and miscarriages of
some Princes and Governors, which, though he named none, did so sensibly
touch the Duke, who was then Lieutenant of Ireland, that he began to be
very uneasy, and wished the spirit laid which he had raised, for he was
neither able to endure such truths, nor could he but be delighted.At
last, he melted his discourse to a ridiculous subject, and came down
from the joint stool on which he had stood; but my lord would not have
him preach any more.He never could get favor at Court, because he
outwitted all the projectors that came near him.Having never known such
another genius, I cannot but mention these particulars, among a
multitude of others which I could produce.When I, who knew him in mean
circumstances, have been in his splendid palace, he would himself be in
admiration how he arrived at it; nor was it his value or inclination for
splendid furniture and the curiosities of the age, but his elegant lady
could endure nothing mean, or that was not magnificent.He was very
negligent himself, and rather so of his person, and of a philosophic
temper.would he say, "I can lie in straw with
as much satisfaction."He is author of the ingenious deductions from the bills of mortality,
which go under the name of Mr.Graunt; also of that useful discourse of
the manufacture of wool, and several others in the register of the Royal
Society.He was also author of that paraphrase on the 104th Psalm in
Latin verse, which goes about in MS., and is inimitable.In a word,
there is nothing impenetrable to him.Brideoak was elected Bishop of Chichester, on the
translation of Dr.3, the necessity
of those who are baptized to die to sin; a very excellent discourse from
an excellent preacher.Barrow, that excellent, pious, and most learned
man, divine, mathematician, poet, traveler, and most humble person,
preached at Whitehall to the household, on Luke xx.27, of love and
charity to our neighbors.I read my first discourse, "Of Earth and Vegetation,"
before the Royal Society as a lecture in course, after Sir Robert
Southwell had read his, the week before, "On Water."I was commanded by
our President and the suffrage of the Society, to print it.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th May, 1675.Blagg, married at the
Temple Church to my friend, Mr.Sidney Godolphin, Groom of the
Bedchamber to his Majesty.Bathurst, a Spanish merchant, my
neighbor.I went with Lord Ossory to Deptford, where we chose him
Master of the Trinity Company.I was at a conference of the Lords and Commons in the
Painted Chamber, on a difference about imprisoning some of their
members; and on the 3d, at another conference, when the Lords accused
the Commons for their transcendent misbehavior, breach of privilege,
Magna Charta, subversion of government, and other high, provoking, and
diminishing expressions, showing what duties and subjection they owed to
the Lords in Parliament, by record of Henry IV.This was likely to
create a notable disturbance.This afternoon came Monsieur Querouaille and his lady,
parents to the famous beauty and... favorite at Court, to see Sir R.
Browne, with whom they were intimately acquainted in Bretagne, at the
time Sir Richard was sent to Brest to supervise his Majesty's sea
affairs, during the latter part of the King's banishment.This
gentleman's house was not a mile from Brest; Sir Richard made an
acquaintance there, and, being used very civilly, was obliged to return
it here, which we did.He seemed a soldierly person and a good fellow,
as the Bretons generally are; his lady had been very handsome, and
seemed a shrewd understanding woman.Conversing with him in our garden,
I found several words of the Breton language the same with our Welsh.His daughter was now made Duchess of Portsmouth, and in the height of
favor; but he never made any use of it.At Ely House, I went to the consecration of my worthy
friend, the learned Dr.Barlow, Warden of Queen's College, Oxford, now
made Bishop of Lincoln.After it succeeded a magnificent feast, where
were the Duke of Ormond, Earl of Lauderdale, the Lord Treasurer, Lord
Keeper, etc.Howard and her two daughters toward
Northampton Assizes, about a trial at law, in which I was concerned for
them as a trustee.We lay this night at Henley-on-the Thames, at our
attorney, Mr.Stephens's, who entertained us very handsomely.Next day,
dining at Shotover, at Sir Timothy Tyrill's, a sweet place, we lay at
Oxford, where it was the time of the Act.Robert Spencer, uncle to
the Earl of Sunderland, and my old acquaintance in France, entertained
us at his apartment in Christ Church with exceeding generosity.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th July, 1675.Bathurst (who had formerly
taken particular care of my son), President of Trinity College invited
me to dinner, and did me great honor all the time of my stay.The next
day, he invited me and all my company, though strangers to him, to a
very noble feast.I was at all the academic exercises.--Sunday, at St.Mary's, preached a Fellow of Brasen-nose, not a little magnifying the
dignity of Churchmen.We heard the speeches, and saw the ceremony of creating
doctors in Divinity, Law and Physic.I had, early in the morning, heard
Dr.Morison, Botanic Professor, read on divers plants in the Physic
Garden; and saw that rare collection of natural curiosities of Dr.Plot's, of Magdalen Hall, author of "The Natural History of
Oxfordshire," all of them collected in that shire, and indeed
extraordinary, that in one county there should be found such variety of
plants, shells, stones, minerals, marcasites, fowls, insects, models of
works, crystals, agates, and marbles.He was now intending to visit
Staffordshire, and, as he had of Oxfordshire, to give us the natural,
topical, political, and mechanical history.Pity it is that more of this
industrious man's genius were not employed so to describe every county
of England; it would be one of the most useful and illustrious works
that was ever produced in any age or nation.I visited also the Bodleian Library and my old friend, the learned
Obadiah Walker, head of University College, which he had now almost
rebuilt, or repaired.We then proceeded to Northampton, where we arrived
the next day.In this journey, went part of the way Mr.James Graham (since Privy
Purse to the Duke), a young gentleman exceedingly in love with Mrs.Dorothy Howard, one of the maids of honor in our company.I could not
but pity them both, the mother not much favoring it.This lady was not
only a great beauty, but a most virtuous and excellent creature, and
worthy to have been wife to the best of men.My advice was required, and
I spoke to the advantage of the young gentleman, more out of pity than
that she deserved no better match; for, though he was a gentleman of
good family, yet there was great inequality.I went to see my Lord Sunderland's Seat at Althorpe,
four miles from the ragged town of Northampton (since burned, and well
rebuilt).It is placed in a pretty open bottom, very finely watered and
flanked with stately woods and groves in a park, with a canal, but the
water is not running, which is a defect.The house, a kind of modern
building, of freestone, within most nobly furnished; the apartments very
commodious, a gallery and noble hall; but the kitchen being in the body
of the house, and chapel too small, were defects.There is an old yet
honorable gatehouse standing awry, and out-housing mean, but designed to
be taken away.It was moated round, after the old manner, but it is now
dry, and turfed with a beautiful carpet.Above all, are admirable and
magnificent the several ample gardens furnished with the choicest fruit,
and exquisitely kept.Great plenty of oranges, and other curiosities.The park full of fowl, especially herons, and from it a prospect to
Holmby House, which being demolished in the late civil wars, shows like
a Roman ruin shaded by the trees about it, a stately, solemn, and
pleasing view.Our cause was pleaded in behalf of the mother, Mrs.Howard and her daughters, before Baron Thurland, who had formerly been
steward of Courts for me; we carried our cause, as there was reason, for
here was an impudent as well as disobedient son against his mother, by
instigation, doubtless, of his wife, one Mrs.Ogle (an ancient maid),
whom he had clandestinely married, and who brought him no fortune, he
being heir-apparent to the Earl of Berkshire.We lay at Brickhill, in
Bedfordshire, and came late the next day to our journey's end.This was a journey of adventures and knight-errantry.One of the lady's
servants being as desperately in love with Mrs.Graham was with her daughter, and she riding on horseback behind his
rival, the amorous and jealous youth having a little drink in his pate,
had here killed himself had he not been prevented; for, alighting from
his horse, and drawing his sword, he endeavored twice or thrice to fall
on it, but was interrupted by our coachman, and a stranger passing by.After this, running to his rival, and snatching his sword from his side
(for we had beaten his own out of his hand), and on the sudden pulling
down his mistress, would have run both of them through; we parted them,
not without some blood.This miserable creature poisoned himself for her
not many days after they came to London.[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th July, 1675.The Lord Treasurer's Chaplain preached at Wallingford
House.Sprat, prebend of Westminster, and Chaplain to the
Duke of Buckingham, preached on the 3d Epistle of Jude, showing what the
primitive faith was, how near it and how excellent that of the Church of
England, also the danger of departing from it.I visited the Bishop of Rochester, at Bromley, and
dined at Sir Philip Warwick's, at Frogpoole [Frognall].I went to see Dulwich College, being the pious
foundation of one Alleyn, a famous comedian, in King James's time.The
chapel is pretty, the rest of the hospital very ill contrived; it yet
maintains divers poor of both sexes.It is in a melancholy part of
Camberwell parish.I came back by certain medicinal Spa waters, at a
place called Sydenham Wells, in Lewisham parish, much frequented in
summer.I was casually shown the Duchess of Portsmouth's
splendid apartment at Whitehall, luxuriously furnished, and with ten
times the richness and glory beyond the Queen's; such massy pieces of
plate, whole tables, and stands of incredible value.I saw the Italian Scaramuccio act before the King
at Whitehall, people giving money to come in, which was very scandalous,
and never so before at Court diversions.Having seen him act before in
Italy, many years past, I was not averse from seeing the most excellent
of that kind of folly.Dined at Kensington with my old acquaintance, Mr.Henshaw, newly returned from Denmark, where he had been left resident
after the death of the Duke of Richmond, who died there Ambassador.I got an extreme cold, such as was afterward so
epidemical, as not only to afflict us in this island, but was rife over
all Europe, like a plague.It was after an exceedingly dry summer and
autumn.I settled affairs, my son being to go into France with my Lord Berkeley,
designed Ambassador-extraordinary for France and Plenipotentiary for the
general treaty of peace at Nimeguen.Dined at Lord Chamberlain's with the Holland
Ambassador L. Duras, a valiant gentleman whom his Majesty made an
English Baron, of a cadet, and gave him his seat of Holmby, in
Northamptonshire.Lord Berkeley coming into Council, fell down in the
gallery at Whitehall, in a fit of apoplexy, and being carried into my
Lord Chamberlain's lodgings, several famous doctors were employed all
that night, and with much ado he was at last recovered to some sense, by
applying hot fire pans and spirit of amber to his head; but nothing was
found so effectual as cupping him on the shoulders.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.It was almost a
miraculous restoration.The next day he was carried to Berkeley House.This stopped his journey for the present, and caused my stay in town.He
had put all his affairs and his whole estate in England into my hands
during his intended absence, which though I was very unfit to undertake,
in regard of many businesses which then took me up, yet, upon the great
importunity of my lady and Mr.Godolphin (to whom I could refuse
nothing) I did take it on me.It seems when he was Deputy in Ireland,
not long before, he had been much wronged by one he left in trust with
his affairs, and therefore wished for some unmercenary friend who would
take that trouble on him; this was to receive his rents, look after his
houses and tenants, solicit supplies from the Lord Treasurer, and
correspond weekly with him, more than enough to employ any drudge in
England; but what will not friendship and love make one do?Dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, with my son.There
were the learned Isaac Vossius, and Spanhemius, son of the famous man of
Heidelberg; nor was this gentleman less learned, being a general
scholar.Among other pieces, he was author of an excellent treatise on
Medals.Being the day appointed for my Lord Ambassador to
set out, I met them with my coach at New Cross.There were with him my
Lady his wife, and my dear friend, Mrs.Godolphin, who, out of an
extraordinary friendship, would needs accompany my lady to Paris, and
stay with her some time, which was the chief inducement for permitting
my son to travel, but I knew him safe under her inspection, and in
regard my Lord himself had promised to take him into his special favor,
he having intrusted all he had to my care.Thus we set out three coaches (besides mine), three wagons, and about
forty horses.It being late, and my Lord as yet but valetudinary, we got
but to Dartford, the first day, the next to Sittingbourne.Cony, then an officer of mine for the sick
and wounded of that place, gave the ladies a handsome refreshment as we
came by his house.[Sidenote: DOVER]

12th November, 1675.We came to Canterbury: and, next morning, to Dover.There was in my Lady Ambassadress's company my Lady Hamilton, a
sprightly young lady, much in the good graces of the family, wife of
that valiant and worthy gentleman, George Hamilton, not long after slain
in the wars.She had been a maid of honor to the Duchess, and now turned
<DW7>.Being Sunday, my Lord having before delivered to me
his letter of attorney, keys, seal, and his Will, we took a solemn leave
of one another upon the beach, the coaches carrying them into the sea to
the boats, which delivered them to Captain Gunman's yacht, the "Mary."Being under sail, the castle gave them seventeen guns, which Captain
Gunman answered with eleven.Hence, I went to church, to beg a blessing
on their voyage.Being returned home, I visited Lady Mordaunt at
Parson's Green, my Lord, her son, being sick.This pious woman delivered
to me L100 to bestow as I thought fit for the release of poor prisoners,
and other charitable uses.Visited her Ladyship again, where I found the
Bishop of Winchester, whom I had long known in France; he invited me to
his house at Chelsea.Lady Sunderland gave me ten guineas, to bestow in
charities.Gunning, Bishop of Ely, preached before the
King from St.21, 22, 23, chiefly against an anonymous book,
called "Naked Truth," a famous and popular treatise against the
corruption in the Clergy, but not sound as to its quotations, supposed
to have been the Bishop of Hereford's and was answered by Dr.Turner, it
endeavoring to prove an equality of order of Bishop and Presbyter.Pritchard, Bishop of Gloucester, preached at
Whitehall, on Isaiah v.5, very allegorically, according to his manner,
yet very gravely and wittily.Povey, one of the Masters of
Requests, a nice contriver of all elegancies, and exceedingly formal.Supped with Sir J. Williamson, where were of our Society Mr.Robert
Boyle, Sir Christopher Wren, Sir William Petty, Dr.Holden, subdean of
his Majesty's Chapel, Sir James Shaen, Dr.Whistler, and our Secretary,
Mr.Sir Thomas Linch was returned from his government of
Jamaica.The Countess of Sunderland and I went by water to
Parson's Green, to visit my Lady Mordaunt, and to consult with her about
my Lord's monument.Lloyd, late Curate of Deptford, but now Bishop of
Llandaff, preached before the King, on 1 Cor.57, that though sin
subjects us to death, yet through Christ we become his conquerors.To Twickenham Park, Lord Berkeley's country seat, to
examine how the bailiffs and servants ordered matters.Brideoake, Bishop of Chichester, preached a mean
discourse for a Bishop.Fleetwood, Bishop of Worcester,
on Matt.38, of the sorrows of Christ, a deadly sorrow caused by
our sins; he was no great preacher.Dining with my Lady Sunderland, I saw a fellow swallow
a knife, and divers great pebble stones, which would make a plain
rattling one against another.The knife was in a sheath of horn.North, son of my Lord North, preached before the King, on Isaiah
liii.57, a very young but learned and excellent person.This was
the first time the Duke appeared no more in chapel, to the infinite
grief and threatened ruin of this poor nation.I had now notice that my dear friend Mrs.Godolphin, was
returning from Paris.On the 6th, she arrived to my great joy, whom I
most heartily welcomed.My wife entertained her Majesty at Deptford, for which
the Queen gave me thanks in the withdrawing room at Whitehall.The University of Oxford presented me with the "_Marmora Oxoniensia
Arundeliana_"; the Bishop of Oxford writing to desire that I would
introduce Mr.Prideaux, the editor (a young man most learned in
antiquities) to the Duke of Norfolk, to present another dedicated to his
Grace, which I did, and we dined with the Duke at Arundel House, and
supped at the Bishop of Rochester's with Isaac Vossius.I spoke to the Duke of York about my Lord Berkeley's
going to Nimeguen.Thence, to the Queen's Council at Somerset House,
about Mrs.Godolphin's lease of Spalding, in Lincolnshire.Montague's new palace, near Bloomsbury, built by Mr.Hooke, of our
Society, after the French manner.[36]

    [Footnote 36: Now the British Museum.]Returned home, and found my son returned from France;
praised be God!A chaplain of my Lord Ossory's preached,
after which we took barge to Trinity House in London.Pepys
(Secretary of the Admiralty) succeeded my Lord as Master.[Sidenote: ENFIELD]

2d June, 1676.I went with my Lord Chamberlain to see a garden, at
Enfield town; thence, to Mr.It
is a very pretty place, the house commodious, the gardens handsome, and
our entertainment very free, there being none but my Lord and myself.That which I most wondered at was, that, in the compass of twenty-five
miles, yet within fourteen of London, there is not a house, barn,
church, or building, besides three lodges.To this Lodge are three great
ponds, and some few inclosures, the rest a solitary desert, yet stored
with no less than 3,000 deer.These are pretty retreats for gentlemen,
especially for those who are studious and lovers of privacy.We returned in the evening by Hampstead, to see Lord Wotton's house and
garden (Bellsize House), built with vast expense by Mr.O'Neale, an
Irish gentleman who married Lord Wotton's mother, Lady Stanhope.The
furniture is very particular for Indian cabinets, porcelain, and other
solid and noble movables.The gallery very fine, the gardens very large,
but ill kept, yet woody and chargeable.The soil a cold weeping clay,
not answering the expense.I went to see Sir Thomas Bond's new and fine house by
Peckham; it is on a flat, but has a fine garden and prospect through the
meadows to London.Castillion, Prebend of Canterbury, preached before
the King, on John xv.Went to the funeral of Sir William Sanderson, husband
to the Mother of the Maids, and author of two large but mean histories
of King James and King Charles I. He was buried at Westminster.James's Chapel,
was christened a daughter of Dr.Leake's, the Duke's Chaplain:
godmothers were Lady Mary, daughter of the Duke of York, and the Duchess
of Monmouth: godfather, the Earl of Bath.Came to dine with me my Lord Halifax, Sir Thomas
Meeres, one of the Commissioners of the Admiralty, Sir John Clayton, Mr.Dined with Sir John Banks at his house in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, on recommending Mr.Upman to be tutor to his son going into
France.This Sir John Banks was a merchant of small beginning, but had
amassed L100,000.I dined at the Admiralty with Secretary Pepys, and
supped at the Lord Chamberlain's.Here was Captain Baker, who had been
lately on the attempt of the Northwest passage.He reported prodigious
depth of ice, blue as a sapphire, and as transparent.The thick mists
were their chief impediment, and cause of their return.I paid L1,700 to the Marquis de Sissac, which he had
lent to my Lord Berkeley, and which I heard the Marquis lost at play in
a night or two.The Dean of Chichester preached before the King, on Acts xxiv.Crichton preached the second sermon before him on Psalm xc.12, of
wisely numbering our days, and well employing our time.Dined at Captain Graham's, where I became acquainted
with Dr.Compton (brother to the Earl of Northampton), now Bishop of
London, and Mr.North, son to the Lord North, brother to the Lord
Chief-Justice and Clerk of the Closet, a most hopeful young man.The
Bishop had once been a soldier, had also traveled in Italy, and became a
most sober, grave, and excellent prelate.Supped at the Lord Chamberlain's, where also supped
the famous beauty and errant lady, the Duchess of Mazarine (all the
world knows her story), the Duke of Monmouth, Countess of Sussex (both
natural children of the King by the Duchess of Cleveland[37]), and the
Countess of Derby, a virtuous lady, daughter to my best friend, the Earl
of Ossory.[Footnote 37: Evelyn makes a slip here.The Duke of Monmouth's
    mother was, it is well known, Lucy Walters, sometimes called Mrs.Barlow, and heretofore mentioned in the "Diary."Nor is he more
    correct as to the Countess of Sussex.Lady Anne Fitzroy, as she is
    called in the Peerage books, was married to Lennard Dacre, Earl of
    Sussex, by whom she left a daughter only, who succeeded on her
    father's death to the Barony of Dacre.On the other hand, the Duke
    of Southampton, the Duke of Grafton, and the Duke of Northumberland,
    were all of them children of Charles II.by the Duchess of
    Cleveland.]Flamsted, the learned astrologer
and mathematician, whom his Majesty had established in the new
Observatory in Greenwich Park, furnished with the choicest instruments.To London, to take order about the building of a
house, or rather an apartment, which had all the conveniences of a
house, for my dear friend, Mr.Godolphin and lady, which I undertook to
contrive and survey, and employ workmen until it should be quite
finished; it being just over against his Majesty's wood-yard by the
Thames side, leading to Scotland Yard.To Lambeth, to that rare magazine of marble, to
take order for chimney-pieces, etc., for Mr.The
owner of the works had built for himself a pretty dwelling house; this
Dutchman had contracted with the Genoese for all their marble.We also
saw the Duke of Buckingham's glasswork, where they made huge vases of
metal as clear, ponderous, and thick as crystal; also looking-glasses
far larger and better than any that come from Venice.Godolphin and my wife to Blackwall,
to see some Indian curiosities; the streets being slippery, I fell
against a piece of timber with such violence that I could not speak nor
fetch my breath for some space; being carried into a house and let
blood, I was removed to the water-side and so home, where, after a day's
rest, I recovered.This being one of my greatest deliverances, the Lord
Jesus make me ever mindful and thankful!Being my birthday, and fifty-six years old, I spent
the morning in devotion and imploring God's protection, with solemn
thanksgiving for all his signal mercies to me, especially for that
escape which concerned me this month at Blackwall.Godolphin, and returned home through a prodigious and dangerous mist.Finished the lease of Spalding, for Mr.My son and I dining at my Lord Chamberlain's, he
showed us among others that incomparable piece of Raphael's, being a
Minister of State dictating to Guicciardini, the earnestness of whose
face looking up in expectation of what he was next to write, is so to
the life, and so natural, as I esteem it one of the choicest pieces of
that admirable artist.There was a woman's head of Leonardo da Vinci; a
Madonna of old Palma, and two of Vandyke's, of which one was his own
picture at length, when young, in a leaning posture; the other, an
eunuch, singing.I saw the great ball danced by all the gallants and
ladies at the Duchess of York's.There fell so deep a snow as hindered us from
church.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th December, 1676.To London, in so great a snow, as I remember not
to have seen the like.More snow falling, I was not able to get to church.I went to Roehampton, with my Lady Duchess of
Ormond.The garden and perspective is pretty, the prospect most
agreeable.Came the Earl of Peterborough, to desire me to be a
trustee for Lord Viscount Mordaunt and the Countess, for the sale of
certain lands set out by Act of Parliament, to pay debts.I went to London, to give the Lord Ambassador Berkeley
(now returned from the treaty at Nimeguen) an account of the great trust
reposed in me during his absence, I having received and remitted to him
no less than L20,000 to my no small trouble and loss of time, that
during his absence, and when the Lord Treasurer was no great friend [of
his] I yet procured him great sums, very often soliciting his Majesty in
his behalf; looking after the rest of his estates and concerns entirely,
without once accepting any kind of acknowledgment, purely upon the
request of my dear friend, Mr.I returned with abundance of
thanks and professions from my Lord Berkeley and my Lady.This business being now at an end, and myself delivered
from that intolerable servitude and correspondence, I had leisure to be
somewhat more at home and to myself.I sealed the deeds of sale of the manor of Blechingley to
Sir Robert Clayton, for payment of Lord Peterborough's debts, according
to the trust of the Act of Parliament.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

16th July, 1677.Evans, curate of Abinger,
preached an excellent sermon on Matt.Duncomb's, at Sheere, whose house stands
environed with very sweet and quick streams.Bohun, my Son's late tutor, preached at Abinger, on
Phil., iv.I went to visit my Lord Brounker, now taking the
waters at Dulwich.Dined at the Earl of Peterborough's the day after the
marriage of my Lord of Arundel to Lady Mary Mordaunt, daughter of the
Earl of Peterborough.To visit my Lord Chamberlain, in Suffolk; he sent his
coach and six to meet and bring me from St.Edmund's Bury to Euston.We hunted in the Park and killed a very fat buck.I went to visit my Lord Crofts, now dying at St.Edmunds Bury, and took the opportunity to see this ancient town, and the
remains of that famous monastery and abbey.There is little standing
entire, save the gatehouse; it has been a vast and magnificent Gothic
structure, and of great extent.The gates are wood, but quite plated
over with iron.There are also two stately churches, one especially.I went to Thetford, to the borough-town, where
stand the ruins of a religious house: there is a round mountain
artificially raised, either for some castle, or monument, which makes a
pretty landscape.As we went and returned, a tumbler showed his
extraordinary address in the Warren.I also saw the Decoy; much pleased
with the stratagem.There dined this day at my Lord's one Sir John
Gaudy, a very handsome person, but quite dumb, yet very intelligent by
signs, and a very fine painter; he was so civil and well bred, as it was
not possible to discern any imperfection in him.His lady and children
were also there, and he was at church in the morning with us.A stranger preached at Euston Church, and fell into
a handsome panegyric on my Lord's new building the church, which indeed
for its elegance and cheerfulness, is one of the prettiest country
churches in England.My Lord told me his heart smote him that, after he
had bestowed so much on his magnificent palace there, he should see
God's House in the ruin it lay in.He has also rebuilt the
parsonage-house, all of stone, very neat and ample.[Sidenote: EUSTON]

10th September, 1677.To divert me, my Lord would needs carry me to see
Ipswich, when we dined with one Mr.Mann by the way, who was Recorder of
the town.There were in our company my Lord Huntingtower, son to the
Duchess of Lauderdale, Sir Edward Bacon, a learned gentleman of the
family of the great Chancellor Verulam, and Sir John Felton, with some
other knights and gentlemen.After dinner came the bailiff and
magistrates in their formalities with their maces to compliment my Lord,
and invite him to the town-house, where they presented us a collation of
dried sweetmeats and wine, the bells ringing, etc.Then, we went to see
the town, and first, the Lord Viscount Hereford's house, which stands in
a park near the town, like that at Brussels, in Flanders; the house not
great, yet pretty, especially the hall.The stews for fish succeeded one
another, and feed one the other, all paved at bottom.There is a good
picture of the blessed virgin in one of the parlors, seeming to be of
Holbein, or some good master.Then we saw the Haven, seven miles from
Harwich.The tide runs out every day, but the bedding being soft mud, it
is safe for shipping and a station.The trade of Ipswich is for the most
part Newcastle coals, with which they supply London; but it was formerly
a clothing town.There is not any beggar asks alms in the whole place, a
thing very extraordinary, so ordered by the prudence of the magistrates.It has in it fourteen or fifteen beautiful churches: in a word, it is
for building, cleanness, and good order, one of the best towns in
England.Cardinal Wolsey was a butcher's son of Ipswich, but there is
little of that magnificent Prelate's foundation here, besides a school
and I think a library, which I did not see.His intentions were to build
some great thing.We returned late to Euston, having traveled about
fifty miles this day.Since first I was at this place, I found things exceedingly improved.It is seated in a bottom between two graceful swellings, the main
building being now in the figure of a Greek II with four pavilions, two
at each corner, and a break in the front, railed and balustered at the
top, where I caused huge jars to be placed full of earth to keep them
steady upon their pedestals between the statues, which make as good a
show as if they were of stone, and, though the building be of brick, and
but two stories besides cellars and garrets covered with blue slate, yet
there is room enough for a full court, the offices and outhouses being
so ample and well disposed.The King's apartment is painted _a fresco_,
and magnificently furnished.There are many excellent pictures of the
great masters.The gallery is a pleasant, noble room; in the break, or
middle, is a billiard table, but the wainscot, being of fir, and
painted, does not please me so well as Spanish oak without paint.The
chapel is pretty, the porch descending to the gardens.The orange garden
is very fine, and leads into the greenhouse, at the end of which is a
hall to eat in, and the conservatory some hundred feet long, adorned
with maps, as the other side is with the heads of the Caesars, ill cut in
alabaster; above are several apartments for my Lord, Lady, and Duchess,
with kitchens and other offices below, in a lesser form; lodgings for
servants, all distinct for them to retire to when they please and would
be in private, and have no communication with the palace, which he tells
me he will wholly resign to his son-in-law and daughter, that charming
young creature.The canal running under my Lady's dressing room chamber window, is full
of carps and fowl, which come and are fed there.The cascade at the end
of the canal turns a cornmill that provides the family, and raises water
for the fountains and offices.To pass this canal into the opposite
meadows, Sir Samuel Morland has invented a screw bridge, which, being
turned with a key, lands you fifty feet distant at the entrance of an
ascending walk of trees, a mile in length,--as it is also on the front
into the park,--of four rows of ash trees, and reaches to the park pale,
which is nine miles in compass, and the best for riding and meeting the
game that I ever saw.There were now of red and fallow deer almost a
thousand, with good covert, but the soil barren and flying sand, in
which nothing will grow kindly.The tufts of fir, and much of the other
wood, were planted by my direction some years before.This seat is
admirably placed for field sports, hawking, hunting, or racing.The
mutton is small, but sweet.The stables hold thirty horses and four
coaches.The out-offices make two large quadrangles, so as servants
never lived with more ease and convenience; never master more civil.Strangers are attended and accommodated as at their home, in pretty
apartments furnished with all manner of conveniences and privacy.There is a library full of excellent books; bathing rooms, elaboratory,
dispensary, a decoy, and places to keep and fat fowl in.He had now in
his new church (near the garden) built a dormitory, or vault, with
several repositories, in which to bury his family.In the expense of this pious structure, the church is most laudable,
most of the houses of God in this country resembling rather stables and
thatched cottages than temples in which to serve the Most High.He has
built a lodge in the park for the keeper, which is a neat dwelling, and
might become any gentleman.The same has he done for the parson, little
deserving it for murmuring that my Lord put him some time out of his
wretched hovel, while it was building.He has also erected a fair inn at
some distance from his palace, with a bridge of stone over a river near
it, and repaired all the tenants' houses, so as there is nothing but
neatness and accommodations about his estate, which I yet think is not
above L1,500 a year.I believe he had now in his family one hundred
domestic servants.His lady (being one of the Brederode's daughters, grandchild to a
natural son of Henry Frederick, Prince of Orange) is a good-natured and
obliging woman.They love fine things, and to live easily, pompously,
and hospitably; but, with so vast expense, as plunges my Lord into debts
exceedingly.My Lord himself is given into no expensive vice but
building, and to have all things rich, polite, and princely.He never
plays, but reads much, having the Latin, French, and Spanish tongues in
perfection.He has traveled much, and is the best bred and courtly
person his Majesty has about him, so as the public Ministers more
frequent him than any of the rest of the nobility.While he was
Secretary of State and Prime Minister, he had gotten vastly, but spent
it as hastily, even before he had established a fund to maintain his
greatness; and now beginning to decline in favor (the Duke being no
great friend of his), he knows not how to retrench.He was son of a
Doctor of Laws, whom I have seen, and, being sent from Westminster
School to Oxford, with intention to be a divine, and parson of
Arlington, a village near Brentford, when Master of Arts the Rebellion
falling out, he followed the King's Army, and receiving an HONORABLE
WOUND IN THE FACE, grew into favor, and was advanced from a mean
fortune, at his Majesty's Restoration, to be an Earl and Knight of the
Garter, Lord Chamberlain of the Household, and first favorite for a long
time, during which the King married his natural son, the Duke of
Grafton, to his only daughter and heiress, as before mentioned, worthy
for her beauty and virtue of the greatest prince in Christendom.My Lord
is, besides this, a prudent and understanding person in business, and
speaks well; unfortunate yet in those he has advanced, most of them
proving ungrateful.The many obligations and civilities I have received
from this noble gentleman, extracts from me this character, and I am
sorry he is in no better circumstances.Having now passed near three weeks at Euston, to my great satisfaction,
with much difficulty he suffered me to look homeward, being very earnest
with me to stay longer; and, to engage me, would himself have carried me
to Lynn-Regis, a town of important traffic, about twenty miles beyond,
which I had never seen; as also the Traveling Sands, about ten miles
wide of Euston, that have so damaged the country, rolling from place to
place, and, like the Sands in the Deserts of Lybia, quite overwhelmed
some gentlemen's whole estates, as the relation extant in print, and
brought to our Society, describes at large.My Lord's coach conveyed me to Bury, and thence
baiting at Newmarket, stepping in at Audley-End to see that house again,
I slept at Bishop-Stortford, and, the next day, home.I was accompanied
in my journey by Major Fairfax, of a younger house of the Lord Fairfax,
a soldier, a traveler, an excellent musician, a good-natured, well-bred
gentleman.Phillips (nephew of Milton) to the
service of my Lord Chamberlain, who wanted a scholar to read to and
entertain him sometimes.With Sir Robert Clayton to Marden, an estate he had
bought lately of my kinsman, Sir John Evelyn, of Godstone, in Surrey,
which from a despicable farmhouse Sir Robert had erected into a seat
with extraordinary expense.It is in such a solitude among hills, as,
being not above sixteen miles from London, seems almost incredible, the
ways up to it are so winding and intricate.The gardens are large, and
well-walled, and the husbandry part made very convenient and perfectly
understood.The barns, the stacks of corn, the stalls for cattle, pigeon
house, etc., of most laudable example.Innumerable are the plantations
of trees, especially walnuts.The orangery and gardens are very curious.He and his lady (who is very
curious in distillery) entertained me three or four days very freely.I
earnestly suggested to him the repairing of an old desolate dilapidated
church, standing on the hill above the house, which I left him in good
disposition to do, and endow it better; there not being above four or
five houses in the parish, besides that of this prodigious rich
Scrivener.This place is exceedingly sharp in the winter, by reason of
the serpentining of the hills: and it wants running water; but the
solitude much pleased me.All the ground is so full of wild thyme,
marjoram, and other sweet plants, that it cannot be overstocked with
bees; I think he had near forty hives of that industrious insect.I went to church at Godstone, and to see old Sir
John Evelyn's DORMITORY, joining to the church, paved with marble, where
he and his Lady lie on a very stately monument at length; he in armor of
white marble.The inscription is only an account of his particular
branch of the family, on black marble.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th October, 1677.Returned to London; in the evening, I saw the Prince
of Orange, and supped with Lord Ossory.Saw again the Prince of Orange; his marriage with the
Lady Mary, eldest daughter to the Duke of York, by Mrs.Hyde, the late
Duchess, was now declared.I was all this week composing matters between old
Mrs.Howard and Sir Gabriel Sylvius, upon his long and earnest addresses
to Mrs.Anne, her second daughter, maid of honor to the Queen.Godolphin (who exceedingly loved the young lady) was most
industrious in it, out of pity to the languishing knight; so as though
there were great differences in their years, it was at last effected,
and they were married the 13th, in Henry VII.'s Chapel, by the Bishop of
Rochester, there being besides my wife and Mrs.We dined at the old lady's, and supped at
Mr.The Queen's birthday, a great ball at Court, where
the Prince of Orange and his new Princess danced.They went away, and I saw embarked my Lady Sylvius,
who went into Holland with her husband, made Hoffmaester to the Prince,
a considerable employment.We parted with great sorrow, for the great
respect and honor I bore her, a most pious and virtuous lady.Dined at the Lord Treasurer's with Prince Rupert,
Viscount Falkenburg, Earl of Bath, Lord O'Brien, Sir John Lowther, Sir
Christopher Wren, Dr.Sir Joseph Williamson, Principal Secretary of
State, was chosen President of the Royal Society, after my Lord Viscount
Brouncker had possessed the chair now sixteen years successively, and
therefore now thought fit to CHANGE, that prescription might not
prejudice.Being the first day of his taking the chair, he gave
us a magnificent supper.Carried to my Lord Treasurer an account of the Earl
of Bristol's Library, at Wimbledon, which my Lord thought of purchasing,
till I acquainted him that it was a very broken collection, consisting
much in books of judicial astrology, romances, and trifles.I gave my son an office, with instructions how to
govern his youth; I pray God give him the grace to make a right use of
it!Dined with the Duke of Norfolk, being the first
time I had seen him since the death of his elder brother, who died at
Padua in Italy, where he had resided above thirty years.The Duke had
now newly declared his marriage to his concubine, whom he promised me he
never would marry.I went with him to see the Duke of Buckingham, thence
to my Lord Sunderland, now Secretary of State, to show him that rare
piece of Vosterman's (son of old Vosterman), which was a view, or
landscape of my Lord's palace, etc., at Althorpe in Northamptonshire.Supping at my Lord Chamberlain's I had a long
discourse with the Count de Castel Mellor, lately Prime Minister in
Portugal, who, taking part with his master, King Alphonso, was banished
by his brother, Don Pedro, now Regent; but had behaved himself so
uncorruptly in all his ministry that, though he was acquitted, and his
estate restored, yet would they not suffer him to return.He is a very
intelligent and worthy gentleman.My Lord Treasurer sent for me to accompany him to
Wimbledon, which he had lately purchased of the Earl of Bristol; so
breaking fast with him privately in his chamber, I accompanied him with
two of his daughters, my Lord Conway, and Sir Bernard Gascoyne; and,
having surveyed his gardens and alterations, returned late at night.[Sidenote: LONDON]

22d February, 1678.Pierce preached at Whitehall, on 2 Thessalonians
iii.6, against our late schismatics, in a rational discourse, but a
little over-sharp, and not at all proper for the auditory there.South preached _coram Rege_, an incomparable
discourse on this text, "A wounded spirit who can bear!"Note: Now was
our Communion table placed altarwise; the church steeple, clock, and
other reparations finished.I showed Don Emmanuel de Lyra (Portugal Ambassador)
and the Count de Castel Mellor, the Repository of the Royal Society, and
the College of Physicians.I went to see new Bedlam Hospital, magnificently
built, and most sweetly placed in Moorfields, since the dreadful fire in
London.I went to Windsor with my Lord Chamberlain (the castle
now repairing with exceeding cost) to see the rare work of Verrio, an
incomparable carving of Gibbons.Returned with my Lord by Hounslow Heath, where we saw
the newly raised army encamped, designed against France, in pretense, at
least; but which gave umbrage to the Parliament.His Majesty and a world
of company were in the field, and the whole army in battalia; a very
glorious sight.Now were brought into service a new sort of soldiers,
called GRENADIERS, who were dexterous in flinging hand grenades,
everyone having a pouch full; they had furred caps with coped crowns
like Janizaries, which made them look very fierce, and some had long
hoods hanging down behind, as we picture fools.Their clothing being
likewise piebald, yellow and red.Came to dine with me my Lord Longford, Treasurer of
Ireland, nephew to that learned gentleman, my Lord Aungier, with whom I
was long since acquainted; also the Lady Stidolph, and other company.The Earl of Ossory came to take his leave of me, going
into Holland to command the English forces.I went to the Tower to try a metal at the
Assay-master's, which only proved sulphur; then saw Monsieur Rotiere,
that excellent graver belonging to the Mint, who emulates even the
ancients, in both metal and stone;[38] he was now molding a horse for
the King's statue, to be cast in silver, of a yard high.[Footnote 38: Doubtless Philip Rotiere, who introduced the figure of
    Britannia into the coinage, taking for his model the King's
    favorite, Frances Stewart, Duchess of Richmond.]Elias Ashmole's library and curiosities,
at Lambeth.He had divers MSS., but most of them astrological, to which
study he is addicted, though I believe not learned, but very
industrious, as his History of the order of the Garter proves.He showed
me a toad included in amber.The prospect from a turret is very fine, it
being so near London, and yet not discovering any house about the
country.The famous John Tradescant bequeathed his Repository to this
gentleman, who has given them to the University of Oxford, and erected a
lecture on them, over the laboratory, in imitation of the Royal Society.Godolphin was made master of the robes to the King.There was sent me L70; from whom I knew not, to be by
me distributed among poor people; I afterward found it was from that
dear friend (Mrs.Godolphin), who had frequently given me large sums to
bestow on charities.I went to Lady Mordaunt, who put L100 into my hand to
dispose of for pious uses, relief of prisoners, poor, etc.Many a sum
had she sent me on similar occasions; a blessed creature she was, and
one that loved and feared God exemplarily.[Sidenote: WEYBRIDGE]

23d August, 1678.Upon Sir Robert Reading's importunity, I went to visit
the Duke of Norfolk, at his new palace at Weybridge, where he has laid
out in building near L10,000, on a copyhold, and in a miserable, barren,
sandy place by the street side; never in my life had I seen such expense
to so small purpose.The rooms are wainscotted, and some of them richly
pargeted with cedar, yew, cypress, etc.There are some good pictures,
especially that incomparable painting of Holbein's, where the Duke of
Norfolk, Charles Brandon and Henry VIII., are dancing with the three
ladies, with most amorous countenances, and sprightly motion exquisitely
expressed.It is a thousand pities (as I told my Lord of Arundel, his
son), that that jewel should be given away.Alban's house, at
Byfleet, an old, large building.Thence, to the papermills, where I
found them making a coarse white paper.They cull the rags which are
linen for white paper, woolen for brown; then they stamp them in troughs
to a pap, with pestles, or hammers, like the powder mills, then put it
into a vessel of water, in which they dip a frame closely wired with
wire as small as a hair and as close as a weaver's reed; on this they
take up the pap, the superfluous water draining through the wire; this
they dexterously turning, shake out like a pancake on a smooth board
between two pieces of flannel, then press it between a great press, the
flannel sucking out the moisture; then, taking it out, they ply and dry
it on strings, as they dry linen in the laundry; then dip it in alum
water, lastly, polish and make it up in quires.They put some gum in the
water in which they macerate the rags.The mark we find on the sheets is
formed in the wire.Sheldon (nephew to
the late Archbishop of Canterbury), and his pretty melancholy garden; I
took notice of the largest _arbor thuyris_ I had ever seen.The place is
finely watered, and there are many curiosities of India, shown in the
house.There was at Weybridge the Duchess of Norfolk, Lord Thomas Howard (a
worthy and virtuous gentleman, with whom my son was sometime bred in
Arundel House), who was newly come from Rome, where he had been some
time; also one of the Duke's daughters, by his first lady.My Lord
leading me about the house made no scruple of showing me all the hiding
places for the Popish priests, and where they said mass, for he was no
bigoted <DW7>.He told me he never trusted them with any secret, and
used Protestants only in all businesses of importance.I went this evening with my Lord Duke to Windsor, where was a
magnificent Court, it being the first time of his Majesty's removing
thither since it was repaired.I took leave of the Duke, and dined at Mr.Henry
Bruncker's, at the Abbey of Sheene, formerly a monastery of Carthusians,
there yet remaining one of their solitary cells with a cross.Within
this ample inclosure are several pretty villas and fine gardens of the
most excellent fruits, especially Sir William Temple's (lately
Ambassador into Holland), and the Lord Lisle's, son to the Earl of
Leicester, who has divers rare pictures, above all, that of Sir Brian
Tuke's, by Holbein.After dinner I walked to Ham, to see the house and garden of the Duke of
Lauderdale, which is indeed inferior to few of the best villas in Italy
itself; the house furnished like a great Prince's; the parterres,
flower-gardens, orangeries, groves, avenues, courts, statues,
perspectives, fountains, aviaries, and all this at the banks of the
sweetest river in the world, must needs be admirable.Hence, I went to my worthy friend, Sir Henry Capel [at Kew], brother to
the Earl of Essex; it is an old timber-house; but his garden has the
choicest fruit of any plantation in England, as he is the most
industrious and understanding in it.I was called to London to wait upon the Duke of
Norfolk, who having at my sole request bestowed the Arundelian Library
on the Royal Society; sent to me to take charge of the books, and remove
them, only stipulating that I would suffer the Herald's chief officer,
Sir William Dugdale, to have such of them as concerned heraldry and the
marshal's office, books of armory and genealogies, the Duke being Earl
Marshal of England.I procured for our Society, besides printed books,
near one hundred MSS.The printed
books being of the oldest impressions, are not the less valuable; I
esteem them almost equal to MSS.Among them, are most of the Fathers,
printed at Basil, before the Jesuits abused them with their expurgatory
Indexes; there is a noble MS.Many of these books had been
presented by Popes, Cardinals, and great persons, to the Earls of
Arundel and Dukes of Norfolk; and the late magnificent Earl of Arundel
bought a noble library in Germany, which is in this collection.I should
not, for the honor I bear the family, have persuaded the Duke to part
with these, had I not seen how negligent he was of them, suffering the
priests and everybody to carry away and dispose of what they pleased; so
that abundance of rare things are irrecoverably gone.Having taken order here, I went to the Royal Society to give them an
account of what I had procured, that they might call a Council and
appoint a day to wait on the Duke to thank him for this munificent gift.[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d September, 1678.I went to London, to dine with Mrs.Godolphin, and
found her in labor; she was brought to bed of a son, who was baptized in
the chamber, by the name of Francis, the susceptors being Sir William
Godolphin (head of the family), Mr.John Hervey, Treasurer to the Queen,
and Mrs.Boscawen, sister to Sir William and the father.While I was at church came a letter from Mr.Godolphin, that my dear friend his lady was exceedingly ill, and
desiring my prayers and assistance.My wife and I took boat immediately,
and went to Whitehall, where, to my inexpressible sorrow, I found she
had been attacked with a new fever, then reigning this excessive hot
autumn, and which was so violent, that it was not thought she could last
many hours.She died in the 26th year of her age, to the
inexpressible affliction of her dear husband, and all her relations, but
of none in the world more than of myself, who lost the most excellent
and inestimable friend that ever lived.Never was a more virtuous and
inviolable friendship; never a more religious, discreet, and admirable
creature, beloved of all, admired of all, for all possible perfections
of her sex.She is gone to receive the reward of her signal charity, and
all other her Christian graces, too blessed a creature to converse with
mortals, fitted as she was, by a most holy life, to be received into the
mansions above.She was for wit, beauty, good nature, fidelity,
discretion, and all accomplishments, the most incomparable person.How
shall I ever repay the obligations to her for the infinite good offices
she did my soul by so often engaging me to make religion the terms and
tie of the friendship there was between us!She was the best wife, the
best mistress, the best friend, that ever husband had.But it is not
here that I pretend to give her character, HAVING DESIGNED TO CONSECRATE
HER WORTHY LIFE TO POSTERITY.Her husband, struck with unspeakable affliction, fell down as dead.The
King himself, and all the Court, expressed their sorrow.To the poor and
miserable, her loss was irreparable; for there was no degree but had
some obligation to her memory.So careful and provident was she to be
prepared for all possible accidents, that (as if she foresaw her end)
she received the heavenly viaticum but the Sunday before, after a most
solemn recollection.She put all her domestic concerns into the exactest
order, and left a letter directed to her husband, to be opened in case
she died in childbed, in which with the most pathetic and endearing
expressions of the most loyal and virtuous wife, she begs his kindness
to her memory might be continued by his care and esteem of those she
left behind, even to her domestic servants, to the meanest of which she
left considerable legacies, as well as to the poor.It was now seven
years since she was maid of honor to the Queen, that she regarded me as
a father, a brother, and what is more, a friend.We often prayed,
visited the sick and miserable, received, read, discoursed, and
communicated in all holy offices together.She was most dear to my wife,
and affectionate to my children.This only is my
comfort, that she is happy in Christ, and I shall shortly behold her
again.She desired to be buried in the dormitory of his family, near
three hundred miles from all her other friends.So afflicted was her
husband at this severe loss, that the entire care of her funeral was
committed to me.Having closed the eyes, and dropped a tear upon the
cheek of my dear departed friend, lovely even in death, I caused her
corpse to be embalmed and wrapped in lead, a plate of brass soldered
thereon, with an inscription, and other circumstances due to her worth,
with as much diligence and care as my grieved heart would permit me; I
then retired home for two days, which were spent in solitude and sad
reflection.She was, accordingly, carried to Godolphin, in
Cornwall, in a hearse with six horses, attended by two coaches of as
many, with about thirty of her relations and servants.There accompanied
the hearse her husband's brother, Sir William, two more of his brothers,
and three sisters; her husband was so overcome with grief, that he was
wholly unfit to travel so long a journey, till he was more composed.I
went as far as Hounslow with a sad heart; but was obliged to return upon
some indispensable affairs.The corpse was ordered to be taken out of
the hearse every night, and decently placed in the house, with tapers
about it, and her servants attending, to Cornwall; and then was
honorably interred in the parish church of Godolphin.This funeral cost
not much less than L1,000.Godolphin, I looked over and sorted his lady's papers, most of
which consisted of Prayers, Meditations, Sermon-notes, Discourses, and
Collections on several religious subjects, and many of her own happy
composing, and so pertinently digested, as if she had been all her life
a student in divinity.We found a diary of her solemn resolutions,
tending to practical virtue, with letters from select friends, all put
into exact method.It astonished us to see what she had read and
written, her youth considered.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st October, 1678.The Parliament and the whole Nation were alarmed
about a conspiracy of some eminent <DW7>s for the destruction of the
King and introduction of Popery, discovered by one Oates and Dr.Tongue,[39] WHICH LAST I KNEW, BEING THE TRANSLATOR OF THE "Jesuits'
Morals"; I went to see and converse with him at Whitehall, with Mr.Oates, one that was lately an apostate to the church of Rome, and now
returned again with this discovery.He seemed to be a bold man, and, in
my thoughts, furiously indiscreet; but everybody believed what he said;
and it quite changed the genius and motions of the Parliament, growing
now corrupt and interested with long sitting and court practices; but,
with all this, Popery would not go down.This discovery turned them all
as one man against it, and nothing was done but to find out the depth of
this.Oates was encouraged, and everything he affirmed taken for gospel;
the truth is, the Roman Catholics were exceedingly bold and busy
everywhere, since the Duke forbore to go any longer to the chapel.[Footnote 39: Ezrael Tonge was bred in University College, Oxford,
    and being puritanically inclined, quitted the University; but in
    1648 returned, and was made a Fellow.He had the living of Pluckley,
    in Kent, which he resigned in consequence of quarrels with his
    parishioners and Quakers.In 1657, he was made fellow of the
    newly-erected College at Durham, and that being dissolved in 1660,
    he taught school at Islington.He then went with Colonel Edward
    Harley to Dunkirk, and subsequently took a small living in
    Herefordshire (Lentwardine); but quitted it for St.Mary Stayning,
    in London, which, after the fire in 1666, was united to St.These he held till his death, in 1680.He was a great
    opponent of the Roman Catholics.Wood mentions several publications
    of his, among which are, "The Jesuits Unmasked," 1678; "Jesuitical
    Aphorisms," 1678; and "The Jesuits' Morals," 1680 (1670); the two
    latter translated from the French.(Wood's "_Athenae, Oxon._" vol.Evelyn speaks of the last of these translations as
    having been executed by his desire: and it figures in a notable
    passage of Oates's testimony.Oates said, for example, "that Thomas
    Whitbread, a priest, on 13th of June, 16.did tell the rector of
    St.Omer's that a Minister of the Church of England had scandalously
    put out the 'Jesuits' Morals' in English, and had endeavored to
    render them odious, and had asked the Rector whether he thought
    Oates might know him?and the Rector called, the deponent, who heard
    these words as he stood at the chamber door, and when he went into
    the chamber of the Provincial, he asked him 'If he knew the author
    of the "Jesuits' Morals?"'deponent answered, 'His person, but not
    his name.'Whitbread then demanded, whether he would undertake to
    poison, or assassinate the author; which deponent undertook, having
    L50 reward promised him, and appointed to return to England."]Godolphin requested me to continue the trust his
wife had reposed in me, in behalf of his little son, conjuring me to
transfer the friendship I had for his dear wife, on him and his.The murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, found
strangled about this time, as was manifest, by the <DW7>s, he being the
Justice of the Peace, and one who knew much of their practices, as
conversant with Coleman (a servant of the... now accused), put the
whole nation into a new ferment against them.Being the 58th of my age, required my humble
addresses to Almighty God, and that he would take off his heavy hand,
still on my family; and restore comforts to us after the death of my
excellent friend.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1678.Tillotson preached before the Commons at St.He said the <DW7>s were now arrived at that impudence, as
to deny that there ever was any such as the gunpowder-conspiracy; but he
affirmed that he himself had several letters written by Sir Everard
Digby (one of the traitors), in which he gloried that he was to suffer
for it; and that it was so contrived, that of the <DW7>s not above two
or three should have been blown up, and they, such as were not worth
saving.I never saw the Court more
brave, nor the nation in more apprehension and consternation.Coleman
and one Staly had now been tried, condemned, and executed.On this,
Oates grew so presumptuous as to accuse the Queen of intending to poison
the King; which certainly that pious and virtuous lady abhorred the
thoughts of, and Oates's circumstances made it utterly unlikely in my
opinion.He probably thought to gratify some who would have been glad
his Majesty should have married a fruitful lady; but the King was too
kind a husband to let any of these make impression on him.However,
divers of the Popish peers were sent to the Tower, accused by Oates; and
all the Roman Catholic lords were by a new Act forever excluded the
Parliament; which was a mighty blow.The King's, Queen's, and Duke's
servants, were banished, and a test to be taken by everybody who
pretended to enjoy any office of public trust, and who would not be
suspected of Popery.I went with Sir William Godolphin, a member of the
Commons' House, to the Bishop of Ely (Dr.Peter Gunning), to be resolved
whether masses were idolatry, as the text expressed it, which was so
worded, that several good Protestants scrupled, and Sir William, though
a learned man and excellent divine himself, had some doubts about it.The Bishop's opinion was that he might take it, though he wished it had
been otherwise worded in the text.I went with my Lady Sunderland to Chelsa, and
dined with the Countess of Bristol [her mother] in the great house,
formerly the Duke of Buckingham's, a spacious and excellent place for
the extent of ground and situation in a good air.The house is large but
ill-contrived, though my Lord of Bristol, who purchased it after he sold
Wimbledon to my Lord Treasurer, expended much money on it.There were
divers pictures of Titian and Vandyke, and some of Bassano, very
excellent, especially an Adonis and Venus, a Duke of Venice, a butcher
in his shambles selling meat to a Swiss; and of Vandyke, my Lord of
Bristol's picture, with the Earl of Bedford's at length, in the same
table.There was in the garden a rare collection of orange trees, of
which she was pleased to bestow some upon me.Houblon's, a French merchant, who had his house furnished _en Prince_,
and gave us a splendid entertainment.The Long Parliament, which had sat ever since the
Restoration, was dissolved by persuasion of the Lord Treasurer, though
divers of them were believed to be his pensioner.At this, all the
politicians were at a stand, they being very eager in pursuit of the
late plot of the <DW7>s.Cudworth preached before the King at Whitehall,
on 2 Timothy iii.5, reckoning up the perils of the last times, in
which, among other wickedness, treasons should be one of the greatest,
applying it to the occasion, as committed under a form of reformation
and godliness; concluding that the prophecy did intend more particularly
the present age, as one of the last times; the sins there enumerated,
more abundantly reigning than ever.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d February, 1679.Durell, Dean of Windsor, preached to the
household at Whitehall, on 1 Cor.22; he read the whole sermon out
of his notes, which I had never before seen a Frenchman do, he being of
Jersey, and bred at Paris.Pierce, Dean of Salisbury, preached on 1 John,
iv.1, "Try the Spirits, there being so many delusory ones gone forth of
late into the world"; he inveighed against the pernicious doctrines of
Mr.My brother Evelyn, was now chosen Knight for the County of Surrey,
carrying it against my Lord Longford and Sir Adam Brown, of Bechworth
Castle.The country coming in to give him their suffrages were so many,
that I believe they ate and drank him out near L2,000, by a most
abominable custom.Godolphin, was now made one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury, and of the Privy Council.The Bishop of Gloucester preached in a manner very like
Bishop Andrews, full of divisions, and scholastical, and that with much
quickness.Our vicar preached exceedingly well on 1
Cor.The Holy Communion followed, at which I and my daughter, Mary
(now about fourteen years old), received for the first time.The Lord
Jesus continue his grace unto her, and improve this blessed beginning!The Duke of York, voted against by the Commons for his
recusancy, went over to Flanders; which made much discourse.Pepys in the Tower, he having been
committed by the House of Commons for misdemeanors in the Admiralty when
he was secretary; I believe he was unjustly charged.Here I saluted my
Lords Stafford and Petre, who were committed for the Popish plot.I saw the magnificent cavalcade and entry of the
Portugal Ambassador.I was godfather to a son of Sir Christopher Wren,
surveyor of his Majesty's buildings, that most excellent and learned
person, with Sir William Fermor, and my Lady Viscountess Newport, wife
of the Treasurer of the Household.Thence to Chelsea, to Sir Stephen Fox, and my lady, in order to the
purchase of the Countess of Bristol's house there, which she desired me
to procure a chapman for.I dined at Sir Robert Clayton's with Sir Robert Viner,
the great banker.There were now divers Jesuits executed about the plot,
and a rebellion in Scotland of the fanatics, so that there was a sad
prospect of public affairs.The new Commissioners of the Admiralty came to visit
me, viz, Sir Henry Capell, brother to the Earl of Essex, Mr.Finch,
eldest son to the Lord Chancellor, Sir Humphry Winch, Sir Thomas Meeres,
Mr.Hales, with some of the Commissioners of the Navy.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's, and with that
learned gentleman went to take the air in Hyde Park, where was a
glorious _cortege_.Sending a piece of venison to Mr.Pepys, still a
prisoner, I went and dined with him.Now were there papers, speeches, and libels, publicly
cried in the streets against the Dukes of York and Lauderdale, etc.,
obnoxious to the Parliament, with too much and indeed too shameful a
liberty; but the people and Parliament had gotten head by reason of the
vices of the great ones.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was now brought up to London a child, son of one Mr.Wotton,
formerly amanuensis to Dr.Andrews, Bishop of Winton, who both read and
perfectly understood Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Syriac, and most of
the modern languages; disputed in divinity, law, and all the sciences;
was skillful in history, both ecclesiastical and profane; in politics;
in a word, so universally and solidly learned at eleven years of age,
that he was looked on as a miracle.Lloyd, one of the most deeply
learned divines of this nation in all sorts of literature, with Dr.Burnet, who had severely examined him, came away astonished, and they
told me they did not believe there had the like appeared in the world.He had only been instructed by his father, who being himself a learned
person, confessed that his son knew all that he himself knew.But, what
was more admirable than his vast memory, was his judgment and invention,
he being tried with divers hard questions, which required maturity of
thought and experience.He was also dexterous in chronology,
antiquities, mathematics.In sum, an _intellectus universalis_, beyond
all that we read of Picus Mirandula, and other precocious wits, and yet
withal a very humble child.I went to see how things stood at Parson's Green, my
Lady Viscountess Mordaunt (now sick in Paris, whither she went for
health) having made me a trustee for her children, an office I could not
refuse to this most excellent, pious, and virtuous lady, my long
acquaintance.Sidney Godolphin, now one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury.I went early to the Old Bailey Sessions House, to the
famous trial of Sir George Wakeman, one of the Queen's physicians, and
three Benedictine monks; the first (whom I was well acquainted with, and
take to be a worthy gentleman abhorring such a fact), for intending to
poison the King; the others as accomplices to carry on the plot, to
subvert the government, and introduce Popery.The bench was crowded with
the judges, Lord Mayor justices, and innumerable spectators.Oates (as he called himself), and one Bedlow, a man of
inferior note.Their testimonies were not so pregnant, and I fear much
of it from hearsay, but swearing positively to some particulars, which
drew suspicion upon their truth; nor did circumstances so agree, as to
give either the bench or jury so entire satisfaction as was expected.After, therefore, a long and tedious trial of nine hours, the jury
brought them in not guilty, to the extraordinary triumph of the <DW7>s,
and without sufficient disadvantage and reflections on witnesses,
especially Oates and Bedlow.This was a happy day for the lords in the Tower, who, expecting their
trial, had this gone against the prisoners at the bar, would all have
been in the utmost hazard.For my part, I look on Oates as a vain,
insolent man, puffed up with the favor of the Commons for having
discovered something really true, more especially as detecting the
dangerous intrigue of Coleman, proved out of his own letters, and of a
general design which the Jesuited party of the <DW7>s ever had and
still have, to ruin the Church of England; but that he was trusted with
those great secrets he pretended, or had any solid ground for what he
accused divers noblemen of, I have many reasons to induce my contrary
belief.That among so many commissions as he affirmed to have delivered
to them from P. Oliva[40] and the Pope,--he who made no scruple of
opening all other papers, letters, and secrets, should not only not open
any of those pretended commissions, but not so much as take any copy or
witness of any one of them, is almost miraculous.But the Commons (some
leading persons I mean of them) had so exalted him that they took all he
said for Gospel, and without more ado ruined all whom he named to be
conspirators; nor did he spare whoever came in his way.But, indeed, the
murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, suspected to have been compassed by
the Jesuits' party for his intimacy with Coleman (a busy person whom I
also knew), and the fear they had that he was able to have discovered
things to their prejudice, did so exasperate not only the Commons, but
all the nation, that much of these sharpnesses against the more honest
Roman Catholics who lived peaceably, is to be imputed to that horrid
fact.[Footnote 40: Padre Oliva, General of the Order of Jesuits.]The sessions ended, I dined or rather supped (so late it was) with the
judges in the large room annexed to the place, and so returned home.Though it was not my custom or delight to be often present at any
capital trials, we having them commonly so exactly published by those
who take them in short-hand, yet I was inclined to be at this signal
one, that by the ocular view of the carriages and other circumstances of
the managers and parties concerned, I might inform myself, and regulate
my opinion of a cause that had so alarmed the whole nation.Dined at Clapham, at Sir D. Gauden's; went thence with
him to Windsor, to assist him in a business with his Majesty.I lay that
night at Eton College, the Provost's lodgings (Dr.Craddock), where I
was courteously entertained.[Sidenote: LONDON]

23d July, 1679.To Court: after dinner, I visited that excellent
painter, Verrio, whose works in _fresco_ in the King's palace, at
Windsor, will celebrate his name as long as those walls last.He showed
us his pretty garden, choice flowers, and curiosities, he himself being
a skillful gardener.I went to Clifden, that stupendous natural rock, wood, and prospect, of
the Duke of Buckingham's, and buildings of extraordinary expense.The
grots in the chalky rocks are pretty: it is a romantic object, and the
place altogether answers the most poetical description that can be made
of solitude, precipice, prospect, or whatever can contribute to a thing
so very like their imaginations.The stand, somewhat like Frascati as to
its front, and on the platform is a circular view to the utmost verge of
the horizon, which, with the serpenting of the Thames, is admirable.The
staircase is for its materials singular; the cloisters, descents,
gardens, and avenue through the wood, august and stately; but the land
all about wretchedly barren, and producing nothing but fern.Indeed, as
I told his Majesty that evening (asking me how I liked Clifden) without
flattery, that it did not please me so well as Windsor for the prospect
and park, which is without compare; there being but one only opening,
and that narrow, which led one to any variety; whereas that of Windsor
is everywhere great and unconfined.Returning, I called at my cousin Evelyn's, who has a very pretty seat in
the forest, two miles by hither Clifden, on a flat, with gardens
exquisitely kept, though large, and the house a staunch good old
building, and what was singular, some of the rooms floored dove
tail-wise without a nail, exactly close.One of the closets is pargeted
with plain deal, set in diamond, exceeding staunch and pretty.Dined at the Sheriff's, when, the Company of Drapers
and their wives being invited, there was a sumptuous entertainment,
according to the forms of the city, with music, etc., comparable to any
prince's service in Europe.I went this morning to show my Lord Chamberlain, his
Lady, and the Duchess of Grafton, the incomparable work of Mr.Gibbon,
the carver, whom I first recommended to his Majesty, his house being
furnished like a cabinet, not only with his own work, but divers
excellent paintings of the best hands.Thence, to Sir Stephen Fox's,
where we spent the day.After evening service, to see a neighbor, one Mr.Bohun, related to my son's late tutor of that name, a rich Spanish
merchant, living in a neat place, which he has adorned with many
curiosities, especially several carvings of Mr.Gibbons, and some
pictures by Streeter.To Windsor, to congratulate his Majesty on his
recovery; I kissed the Duke's hand, now lately returned from
Flanders[41] to visit his brother the King, on which there were various
bold and foolish discourses, the Duke of Monmouth being sent away.[Footnote 41: He returned the day before, the 12th of September.This is another of the indications that the entries of this Diary
    were not always made on the precise days they refer to.]My Lord Sunderland, one of the principal
Secretaries of State, invited me to dinner, where was the King's natural
son, the Earl of Plymouth, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Earl of Essex, Earl
of Mulgrave, Mr.After dinner I went to prayers
at Eton, and visited Mr.Henry Godolphin, fellow there, and Dr.Slingsby and Signor Verrio came to dine with
me, to whom I gave China oranges off my own trees, as good, I think, as
were ever eaten.Dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, the King being now
newly returned from his Newmarket recreations.Dined at the Lord Mayor's; and, in the evening, went
to the funeral of my pious, dear, and ancient learned friend, Dr.Jasper
Needham, who was buried at St.He was a true and holy
Christian, and one who loved me with great affection.Dove preached
with an eulogy due to his memory.I lost in this person one of my
dearest remaining sincere friends.I was invited to dine at my Lord Teviotdale's, a
Scotch Earl, a learned and knowing nobleman.Montague's new palace near Bloomsbury, built by our curator, Mr.Hooke, somewhat after the French; it was most nobly furnished, and a
fine, but too much exposed garden.[42]

6th November, 1679.Dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, and was this
evening at the remarriage of the Duchess of Grafton to the Duke (his
Majesty's natural son), she being now twelve years old.The ceremony was
performed in my Lord Chamberlain's (her father's) lodgings at Whitehall
by the Bishop of Rochester, his Majesty being present.A sudden and
unexpected thing, when everybody believed the first marriage would have
come to nothing; but, the measure being determined, I was privately
invited by my Lady, her mother, to be present.I confess I could give
her little joy, and so I plainly told her, but she said the King would
have it so, and there was no going back.This sweetest, most hopeful,
most beautiful, child, and most virtuous, too, was sacrificed to a boy
that had been rudely bred, without anything to encourage them but his
Majesty's pleasure.I pray God the sweet child find it to her advantage,
who, if my augury deceive me not, will in a few years be such a paragon
as were fit to make the wife of the greatest Prince in Europe!I staid
supper, where his Majesty sat between the Duchess of Cleveland (the
mother of the Duke of Grafton) and the sweet Duchess the bride; there
were several great persons and ladies, without pomp.My love to my Lord
Arlington's family, and the sweet child made me behold all this with
regret, though as the Duke of Grafton affects the sea, to which I find
his father intends to use him, he may emerge a plain, useful and robust
officer: and were he polished, a tolerable person; for he is exceedingly
handsome, by far surpassing any of the King's other natural issue.At Sir Stephen Fox's, and was agreeing for the
Countess of Bristol's house at Chelsea, within L500.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, being desired by the
Countess of Sunderland to carry her thither on a solemn day, that she
might see the pomp and ceremony of this Prince of Citizens, there never
having been any, who for the stateliness of his palace, prodigious
feasting, and magnificence, exceeded him.This Lord Mayor's acquaintance
had been from the time of his being apprentice to one Mr.Abbot, his
uncle, who being a scrivener, and an honest worthy man, one who was
condemned to die at the beginning of the troubles forty years past, as
concerned in the commission of array for King Charles I. had escaped
with his life; I often used his assistance in money matters.Robert
Clayton, then a boy, his nephew, became, after his uncle Abbot's death,
so prodigiously rich and opulent, that he was reckoned one of the
wealthiest citizens.He married a free-hearted woman, who became his
hospitable disposition; and having no children, with the accession of
his partner and fellow apprentice, who also left him his estate, he grew
excessively rich.He was a discreet magistrate, and though envied, I
think without much cause.Some believed him guilty of hard dealing,
especially with the Duke of Buckingham, much of whose estate he had
swallowed, but I never saw any ill by him, considering the trade he was
of.The reputation and known integrity of his uncle, Abbot, brought all
the royal party to him, by which he got not only great credit, but vast
wealth, so as he passed this office with infinite magnificence and
honor.Slingsby, Master of the Mint, with
my wife, invited to hear music, which was exquisitely performed by four
of the most renowned masters: Du Prue, a Frenchman, on the lute; Signor
Bartholomeo, an Italian, on the harpsichord; Nicholao on the violin;
but, above all, for its sweetness and novelty, the _viol d'amore_ of
five wire strings played on with a bow, being but an ordinary violin,
played on lyre-way, by a German.There was also a _flute douce_, now in
much request for accompanying the voice.Slingsby, whose son and
daughter played skillfully, had these meetings frequently in his house.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, to accompany my
worthiest and generous friend, the Earl of Ossory; it was on a Friday, a
private day, but the feast and entertainment might have become a King.Such an hospitable costume and splendid magistrature does no city in the
world show, as I believe.Allestree preached before the household on St.20, before the King, showing with
how little reason the <DW7>s applied those words of our blessed Savior
to maintain the pretended infallibility they boast of.I never heard a
more Christian and excellent discourse; yet were some offended that he
seemed to say the Church of Rome was a true church; but it was a
captious mistake; for he never affirmed anything that could be more to
their reproach, and that such was the present Church of Rome, showing
how much it had erred.There was not in this sermon so much as a shadow
for censure, no person of all the clergy having testified greater zeal
against the errors of the <DW7>s than this pious and most learned
person.I dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, and then went to St.Paul's to hear that great wit, Dr.His talent was a great memory,
never making use of notes, a readiness of expression in a most pure and
plain style of words, full of matter, easily delivered.I met the Earl of Clarendon with the rest of my
fellow executors of the Will of my late Lady Viscountess Mordaunt,
namely, Mr.Laurence Hyde, one of the Commissioners of the Treasury, and
lately Plenipotentiary-Ambassador at Nimeguen; Andrew Newport; and Sir
Charles Wheeler; to examine and audit and dispose of this year's account
of the estate of this excellent Lady, according to the direction of her
Will.I went to see Sir John Stonehouse, with whom I was
treating a marriage between my son and his daughter-in-law.Came over the Duke of Monmouth from Holland
unexpectedly to his Majesty; while the Duke of York was on his journey
to Scotland, whither the King sent him to reside and govern.The bells
and bonfires of the city at this arrival of the Duke of Monmouth
publishing their joy, to the no small regret of some at Court.This
Duke, whom for distinction they called the Protestant Duke (though the
son of an abandoned woman), the people made their idol.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th December, 1679.I dined, together with Lord Ossory and the Earl of
Chesterfield, at the Portugal Ambassador's, now newly come, at Cleveland
House, a noble palace, too good for that infamous.... The staircase is
sumptuous, and the gallery and garden; but, above all, the costly
furniture belonging to the Ambassador, especially the rich Japan
cabinets, of which I think there were a dozen.There was a billiard
table, with as many more hazards as ours commonly have; the game being
only to prosecute the ball till hazarded, without passing the port, or
touching the pin; if one miss hitting the ball every time, the game is
lost, or if hazarded.It is more difficult to hazard a ball, though so
many, than in our table, by reason the bound is made so exactly even,
and the edges not stuffed; the balls are also bigger, and they for the
most part use the sharp and small end of the billiard stick, which is
shod with brass, or silver.The entertainment was exceedingly civil;
but, besides a good olio, the dishes were trifling, hashed and condited
after their way, not at all fit for an English stomach, which is for
solid meat.There was yet good fowls, but roasted to coal, nor were the
sweetmeats good.I went to meet Sir John Stonehouse, and give him a
particular of the settlement on my son, who now made his addresses to
the young lady his daughter-in-law, daughter of Lady Stonehouse.Cave, author of "Primitive Christianity,"
etc., a pious and learned man, preached at Whitehall to the household,
on James iii.17, concerning the duty of grace and charity.I supped with Sir Stephen Fox, now made one of the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.The writings for the settling jointure and other
contracts of marriage of my son were finished and sealed.The lady was
to bring L5,000, in consideration of a settlement of L500 a year present
maintenance, which was likewise to be her jointure, and L500 a year
after mine and my wife's decease.But, with God's blessing, it will be
at the least L1,000 a year more in a few years.I pray God make him
worthy of it, and a comfort to his excellent mother, who deserves much
from him!Martha
Spencer, daughter to my Lady Stonehouse by a former gentleman, at St.Andrew's, Holborn, by our Vicar, borrowing the church of Dr.We afterward
dined at a house in Holborn; and, after the solemnity and dancing was
done, they were bedded at Sir John Stonehouse's lodgings in Bow Street,
Convent Garden.To the Royal Society, where I met an Irish Bishop
with his Lady, who was daughter to my worthy and pious friend, Dr.Jeremy Taylor, late Bishop of Down and Connor; they came to see the
Repository.She seemed to be a knowing woman, beyond the ordinary talent
of her sex.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, in order to the meeting of
my Lady Beckford, whose daughter (a rich heiress) I had recommended to
my brother of Wotton for his only son, she being the daughter of the
lady by Mr.To London, to receive L3,000 of my daughter-in-law's
portion, which was paid in gold.The Dean of Sarum preached on Jerem.5, an hour
and a half from his common-place book, of kings and great men retiring
to private situations.[Sidenote: CASHIOBURY]

18th April, 1680.On the earnest invitation of the Earl of Essex, I went
with him to his house at Cashiobury, in Hertfordshire.It was on Sunday,
but going early from his house in the square of St.James, we arrived by
ten o'clock; this he thought too late to go to church, and we had
prayers in his chapel.The house is new, a plain fabric, built by my
friend, Mr.There are divers fair and good rooms, and
excellent carving by Gibbons, especially the chimney-piece of the
library.There is in the porch, or entrance, a painting by Verrio, of
Apollo and the Liberal Arts.One room pargeted with yew, which I liked
well.Some of the chimney mantels are of Irish marble, brought by my
Lord from Ireland, when he was Lord-Lieutenant, and not much inferior to
Italian.The tympanum, or gable, at the front is a bass-relievo of Diana
hunting, cut in Portland stone, handsomely enough.I do not approve of
the middle doors being round: but, when the hall is finished as
designed, it being an oval with a cupola, together with the other wing,
it will be a very noble palace.The library is large, and very nobly
furnished, and all the books are richly bound and gilded; but there are
no MSS., except the Parliament Rolls and Journals, the transcribing and
binding of which cost him, as he assured me, L500.No man has been more industrious than this noble Lord in planting about
his seat, adorned with walks, ponds, and other rural elegancies; but the
soil is stony, churlish, and uneven, nor is the water near enough to the
house, though a very swift and clear stream runs within a flight-shot
from it in the valley, which may fitly be called Coldbrook, it being
indeed excessively cold, yet producing fair trouts.It is a pity the
house was not situated to more advantage: but it seems it was built just
where the old one was, which I believe he only meant to repair; this
leads men into irremediable errors, and saves but a little.The land about is exceedingly addicted to wood, but the coldness of the
place hinders the growth.Black cherry trees prosper even to
considerable timber, some being eighty feet long; they make also very
handsome avenues.There is a pretty oval at the end of a fair walk, set
about with treble rows of Spanish chestnut trees.The gardens are very rare, and cannot be otherwise, having so skillful
an artist to govern them as Mr.Cooke, who is, as to the mechanic part,
not ignorant in mathematics, and pretends to astrology.There is an
excellent collection of the choicest fruit.As for my Lord, he is a sober, wise, judicious, and pondering person,
not illiterate beyond the rate of most noblemen in this age, very well
versed in English history and affairs, industrious, frugal, methodical,
and every way accomplished.His Lady (being sister of the late Earl of
Northumberland) is a wise, yet somewhat melancholy woman, setting her
heart too much on the little lady, her daughter, of whom she is over
fond.My Lord was not long since come from his Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland,
where he showed his abilities in administration and government, as well
as prudence in considerably augmenting his estate without reproach.He
had been Ambassador-extraordinary in Denmark, and, in a word, such a
person as became the son of that worthy hero his father to be, the late
Lord Capel, who lost his life for King Charles I.

We spent our time in the mornings in walking, or riding, and contriving
[alterations], and the afternoons in the library, so as I passed my time
for three or four days with much satisfaction.He was pleased in
conversation to impart to me divers particulars of state, relating to
the present times.He being no great friend to the D---- was now laid
aside, his integrity and abilities being not so suitable in this
conjuncture.To a meeting of the executors of late Viscountess
Mordaunt's estate, to consider of the sale of Parson's Green, being in
treaty with Mr.Loftus, and to settle the half year's account.Was a meeting of the feoffees of the poor of our parish.This year I would stand one of the collectors of their rents, to give
example to others.My son was added to the feoffees.This afternoon came to visit me Sir Edward Deering, of Surrendon, in
Kent, one of the Lords of the Treasury, with his daughter, married to my
worthy friend, Sir Robert Southwell, Clerk of the Council, now
Extraordinary-Envoy to the Duke of Brandenburgh, and other Princes in
Germany, as before he had been in Portugal, being a sober, wise, and
virtuous gentleman.Shish, master-shipwright
of his Majesty's Yard here, an honest and remarkable man, and his death
a public loss, for his excellent success in building ships (though
altogether illiterate), and for breeding up so many of his children to
be able artists.I held up the pall with three knights, who did him that
honor, and he was worthy of it.It was the custom of this good man to
rise in the night, and to pray, kneeling in his own coffin, which he had
lying by him for many years.He was born that famous year, the
Gunpowder-plot, 1605.Came to dine with us the Countess of Clarendon, Dr.Lloyd, Dean of Bangor (since Bishop of St.Burnet, author of
the "History of the Reformation," and my old friend, Mr.After
dinner we all went to see the Observatory, and Mr.Flamsted, who showed
us divers rare instruments, especially the great quadrant.[Sidenote: WINDSOR]

24th July, 1680.Went with my wife and daughter to Windsor, to see that
stately court, now near finished.There was erected in the court the
King on horseback, lately cast in copper, and set on a rich pedestal of
white marble, the work of Mr.Gibbons, at the expense of Toby Rustate, a
page of the back stairs, who by his wonderful frugality had arrived to a
great estate in money, and did many works of charity, as well as this of
gratitude to his master, which cost him L1,000.He is very simple,
ignorant, but honest and loyal creature.We all dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, afterward to see Signor
Verrio's garden, thence to Eton College, to salute the provost, and
heard a Latin speech of one of the alumni (it being at the election) and
were invited to supper; but took our leave, and got to London that night
in good time.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th July, 1680.My most noble and illustrious friend, the Earl of
Ossory, espying me this morning after sermon in the privy gallery,
calling to me, told me he was now going his journey (meaning to Tangier,
whither he was designed Governor, and General of the forces, to regain
the losses we had lately sustained from the Moors, when Inchiquin was
Governor).I asked if he would not call at my house (as he always did
whenever he went out of England on any exploit).He said he must embark
at Portsmouth, "wherefore let you and me dine together to-day; I am
quite alone, and have something to impart to you; I am not well, shall
be private, and desire your company."Being retired to his lodgings, and set down on a couch, he sent to his
secretary for the copy of a letter which he had written to Lord
Sunderland (Secretary of State), wishing me to read it; it was to take
notice how ill he resented it, that he should tell the King before Lord
Ossory's face, that Tangier was not to be kept, but would certainly be
lost, and yet added that it was fit Lord Ossory should be sent, that
they might give some account of it to the world, meaning (as supposed)
the next Parliament, when all such miscarriages would probably be
examined; this Lord Ossory took very ill of Lord Sunderland, and not
kindly of the King, who resolving to send him with an incompetent force,
seemed, as his Lordship took it, to be willing to cast him away, not
only on a hazardous adventure, but in most men's opinion, an
impossibility, seeing there was not to be above 300 or 400 horse, and
4,000 foot for the garrison and all, both to defend the town, form a
camp, repulse the enemy, and fortify what ground they should get in.This touched my Lord deeply, that he should be so little considered as
to put him on a business in which he should probably not only lose his
reputation, but be charged with all the miscarriage and ill success;
whereas, at first they promised 6,000 foot and 600 horse effective.My Lord, being an exceedingly brave and valiant person, and who had so
approved himself in divers signal battles, both at sea and land; so
beloved and so esteemed by the people, as one they depended on, upon all
occasions worthy of such a captain;--he looked on this as too great an
indifference in his Majesty, after all his services, and the merits of
his father, the Duke of Ormond, and a design of some who envied his
virtue.It certainly took so deep root in his mind, that he who was the
most void of fear in the world (and assured me he would go to Tangier
with ten men if his Majesty commanded him) could not bear up against
this unkindness.Having disburdened himself of this to me after dinner,
he went with his Majesty to the sheriffs at a great supper in
Fishmongers' Hall; but finding himself ill, took his leave immediately
of his Majesty, and came back to his lodging.Not resting well this
night, he was persuaded to remove to Arlington House, for better
accommodation.His disorder turned to a malignant fever, which
increasing, after all that six of the most able physicians could do, he
became delirious, with intervals of sense, during which Dr.Lloyd (after
Bishop of St.Asaph) administered the Holy Sacrament, of which I also
participated.He died the Friday following, the 30th of July, to the
universal grief of all that knew or heard of his great worth, nor had
any a greater loss than myself.Oft would he say I was the oldest
acquaintance he had in England (when his father was in Ireland), it
being now of about thirty years, contracted abroad, when he rode in the
Academy in Paris, and when we were seldom asunder.His Majesty never lost a worthier subject, nor father a better or more
dutiful son; a loving, generous, good-natured, and perfectly obliging
friend; one who had done innumerable kindnesses to several before they
knew it; nor did he ever advance any that were not worthy; no one more
brave, more modest; none more humble, sober, and every way virtuous.Unhappy England in this illustrious person's loss!Universal was the
mourning for him, and the eulogies on him; I stayed night and day by his
bedside to his last gasp, to close his dear eyes!O sad father, mother,
wife, and children!He deserved all that a sincere
friend, a brave soldier, a virtuous courtier, a loyal subject, an honest
man, a bountiful master, and good Christian, could deserve of his prince
and country.One thing more let me note, that he often expressed to me
the abhorrence he had of that base and unworthy action which he was put
upon, of engaging the Smyrna fleet in time of peace, in which though he
behaved himself like a great captain, yet he told me it was the only
blot in his life, and troubled him exceedingly.Though he was commanded,
and never examined further when he was so, yet he always spoke of it
with regret and detestation.The Countess was at the seat of her
daughter, the Countess of Derby, about 200 miles off.I went to visit a French gentleman, one Monsieur
Chardin, who having been thrice in the East Indies, Persia, and other
remote countries, came hither in our return ships from those parts, and
it being reported that he was a very curious and knowing man, I was
desired by the Royal Society to salute him in their name, and to invite
him to honor them with his company.Sir Joseph Hoskins and Sir
Christopher Wren accompanied me.We found him at his lodgings in his
eastern habit, a very handsome person, extremely affable, a modest,
well-bred man, not inclined to talk wonders.He spoke Latin, and
understood Greek, Arabic, and Persian, from eleven years' travels in
those parts, whither he went in search of jewels, and was become very
rich.After the usual civilities, we
asked some account of the extraordinary things he must have seen in
traveling over land to those places where few, if any, northern
Europeans used to go, as the Black and Caspian Sea, Mingrelia, Bagdad,
Nineveh, Persepolis, etc.He told us that the things most worthy of our
sight would be, the draughts he had caused to be made of some noble
ruins, etc.; for that, besides his own little talent that way, he had
carried two good painters with him, to draw landscapes, measure and
design the remains of the palace which Alexander burned in his frolic at
Persepolis, with divers temples, columns, relievos, and statues, yet
extant, which he affirmed to be sculpture far exceeding anything he had
observed either at Rome, in Greece, or in any other part of the world
where magnificence was in estimation.He said there was an inscription
in letters not intelligible, though entire.He was sorry he could not
gratify the curiosity of the Society at present, his things not being
yet out of the ship; but would wait on them with them on his return from
Paris, whither he was going the next day, but with intention to return
suddenly, and stay longer here, the persecution in France not suffering
Protestants, and he was one, to be quiet.He told us that Nineveh was a vast city, now all buried in her ruins,
the inhabitants building on the subterranean vaults, which were, as
appeared, the first stories of the old city, that there were frequently
found huge vases of fine earth, columns, and other antiquities; that the
straw which the Egyptians required of the Israelites, was not to burn,
or cover the rows of bricks as we use, but being chopped small to mingle
with the clay, which being dried in the sun (for they bake not in the
furnace) would else cleave asunder; that in Persia are yet a race of
Ignicolae, who worship the sun and the fire as Gods; that the women of
Georgia and Mingrelia were universally, and without any compare, the
most beautiful creatures for shape, features, and figure, in the world,
and therefore the Grand Seignor and Bashaws had had from thence most of
their wives and concubines; that there had within these hundred years
been Amazons among them, that is to say, a sort or race of valiant
women, given to war; that Persia was extremely fertile; he spoke also of
Japan and China, and of the many great errors of our late geographers,
as we suggested matter for discourse.We then took our leave, failing of
seeing his papers; but it was told us by others that indeed he dared not
open, or show them, till he had first showed them to the French King;
but of this he himself said nothing.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d September, 1680.I had an opportunity, his Majesty being still at
Windsor, of seeing his private library at Whitehall, at my full ease.I
went with expectation of finding some curiosities, but, though there
were about 1,000 volumes, there were few of importance which I had not
perused before.They consisted chiefly of such books as had from time to
time been dedicated, or presented to him; a few histories, some Travels
and French books, abundance of maps and sea charts, entertainments and
pomps, buildings and pieces relating to the navy, some mathematical
instruments; but what was most rare, were three or four Romish
breviaries, with a great deal of miniature and monkish painting and
gilding, one of which is most exquisitely done, both as to the figures,
grotesques, and compartments, to the utmost of that curious art.There
is another in which I find written by the hand of King Henry VII., his
giving it to his dear daughter, Margaret, afterward Queen of Scots, in
which he desires her to pray for his soul, subscribing his name at
length.There is also the process of the philosophers' great elixir,
represented in divers pieces of excellent miniature, but the discourse
is in high Dutch, a MS.in quarto, of above 300
years old, in French, being an institution of physic, and in the
botanical part the plants are curiously painted in miniature; also a
folio MS.of good thickness, being the several exercises, as Themes,
Orations, Translations, etc., of King Edward VI., all written and
subscribed by his own hand, and with his name very legible, and divers
of the Greek interleaved and corrected after the manner of schoolboys'
exercises, and that exceedingly well and proper; with some epistles to
his preceptor, which show that young prince to have been extraordinarily
advanced in learning, and as Cardan, who had been in England affirmed,
stupendously knowing for his age.There is likewise his journal, no less
testifying his early ripeness and care about the affairs of state.There are besides many pompous volumes, some embossed with gold, and
intaglios on agates, medals, etc.I spent three or four entire days,
locked up, and alone, among these books and curiosities.In the rest of
the private lodgings contiguous to this, are divers of the best pictures
of the great masters, Raphael, Titian, etc., and in my esteem, above
all, the "_Noli me tangere_" of our blessed Savior to Mary Magdalen
after his Resurrection, of Hans Holbein; than which I never saw so much
reverence and kind of heavenly astonishment expressed in a picture.There are also divers curious clocks, watches, and pendules of exquisite
work, and other curiosities.An ancient woman who made these lodgings
clean, and had all the keys, let me in at pleasure for a small reward,
by means of a friend.I dined with Sir Stephen Fox, now one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury.This gentleman came first a poor boy from
the choir of Salisbury, then he was taken notice of by Bishop Duppa, and
afterward waited on my Lord Percy (brother to Algernon, Earl of
Northumberland), who procured for him an inferior place among the clerks
of the kitchen and Greencloth side, where he was found so humble,
diligent, industrious, and prudent in his behavior, that his Majesty
being in exile, and Mr.Fox waiting, both the King and Lords about him
frequently employed him about their affairs, and trusted him both with
receiving and paying the little money they had.Returning with his
Majesty to England, after great want and great sufferings, his Majesty
found him so honest and industrious, and withal so capable and ready,
that, being advanced from clerk of the kitchen to that of the
Greencloth, he procured to be paymaster of the whole army, and by his
dexterity and punctual dealing he obtained such credit among the
bankers, that he was in a short time able to borrow vast sums of them
upon any exigence.The continual turning thus of money, and the
soldiers' moderate allowance to him for keeping touch with them, did so
enrich him, that he is believed to be worth at least L200,000, honestly
got and unenvied; which is next to a miracle.With all this he continues
as humble and ready to do a courtesy as ever he was.He is generous, and lives very honorably, of a sweet nature,
well-spoken, well-bred, and is so highly in his Majesty's esteem, and so
useful, that being long since made a knight, he is also advanced to be
one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and has the reversion of
the Cofferer's place after Harry Brouncker.He has married his eldest
daughter to my Lord Cornwallis, and gave her L12,000, and restored that
entangled family besides.Trollop, who brings
with her (besides a great sum) near, if not altogether, L2,000 per
annum.Sir Stephen's lady (an excellent woman) is sister to Mr.Whittle,
one of the King's chirurgeons.In a word, never was man more fortunate
than Sir Stephen; he is a handsome person, virtuous, and very religious.Came to my house some German strangers and Signor
Pietro, a famous musician, who had been long in Sweden in Queen
Christina's Court; he sung admirably to a guitar, and had a perfect good
tenor and bass, and had set to Italian composure many of Abraham
Cowley's pieces which showed extremely well.He told me that in Sweden
the heat in some part of summer was as excessive as the cold in winter;
so cold, he affirmed, that the streets of all the towns are desolate, no
creatures stirring in them for many months, all the inhabitants retiring
to their stoves.He spoke high things of that romantic Queen's learning
and skill in languages, the majesty of her behavior, her exceeding wit,
and that the histories she had read of other countries, especially of
Italy and Rome, had made her despise her own.That the real occasion of
her resigning her crown was the nobleman's importuning her to marry, and
the promise which the Pope had made her of procuring her to be Queen of
Naples, which also caused her to change her religion; but she was
cheated by his crafty Holiness,[43] working on her ambition; that the
reason of her killing her secretary at Fontainebleau, was, his revealing
that intrigue with the Pope.But, after all this, I rather believe it
was her mad prodigality and extreme vanity, which had consumed those
vast treasures the great Adolphus, her father, had brought out of
Germany during his [campaigns] there and wonderful successes; and that,
if she had not voluntarily resigned, as foreseeing the event, the
Estates of her kingdom would have compelled her to do so.[Footnote 43: Pope Alexander VII., of the family of Chighi, at
    Sienna.][Sidenote: LONDON]

30th October, 1680.I went to London to be private, my birthday being
the next day, and I now arrived at my sixtieth year; on which I began a
more solemn survey of my whole life, in order to the making and
confirming my peace with God, by an accurate scrutiny of all my actions
past, as far as I was able to call them to mind.How difficult and
uncertain, yet how necessary a work!The Lord be merciful to me, and
accept me!Teach me, therefore, so to
number my days, that I may apply my heart unto wisdom, and make my
calling and election sure.A stranger
preached at Whitehall[44] on Luke xvi.15; the
Holy Communion followed, at which I participated, humbly imploring God's
assistance in the great work I was entering into.Margaret's, on Acts xvii.[Footnote 44: Probably to the King's household, very early in the
    morning, as the custom was.]I began and spent the whole week in examining my life, begging pardon
for my faults, assistance and blessing for the future, that I might, in
some sort, be prepared for the time that now drew near, and not have the
great work to begin, when one can work no longer.I therefore stirred little abroad till the 5th of
November, when I heard Dr.Tenison, the now vicar of St.Lloyd, the former incumbent, being made Bishop of St.I participated of the blessed Communion, finishing
and confirming my resolutions of giving myself up more entirely to God,
to whom I had now most solemnly devoted the rest of the poor remainder
of life in this world; the Lord enabling me, who am an unprofitable
servant, a miserable sinner, yet depending on his infinite goodness and
mercy accepting my endeavors.Came to dine with us Sir Richard Anderson, his
lady, son and wife, sister to my daughter-in-law.[Sidenote: LONDON]

30th November, 1680.The anniversary election at the Royal Society
brought me to London, where was chosen President that excellent person
and great philosopher, Mr.Robert Boyle, who indeed ought to have been
the very first; but neither his infirmity nor his modesty could now any
longer excuse him.I desired I might for this year be left out of the
Council, by reason my dwelling was in the country.The Society according
to custom dined together.The signal day begun the trial (at which I was present) of my Lord
Viscount Stafford, (for conspiring the death of the King), second son to
my Lord Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshal of
England, and grandfather to the present Duke of Norfolk, whom I so well
knew, and from which excellent person I received so many favors.It was
likewise his birthday, The trial was in Westminster Hall, before the
King, Lords, and Commons, just in the same manner as, forty years past,
the great and wise Earl of Strafford (there being but one letter
differing their names) received his trial for pretended ill government
in Ireland, in the very same place, this Lord Stafford's father being
then High Steward.The place of sitting was now exalted some
considerable height from the paved floor of the hall, with a stage of
boards.The throne, woolsacks for the Judges, long forms for the Peers,
chair for the Lord Steward, exactly ranged, as in the House of Lords.The sides on both hands scaffolded to the very roof for the members of
the House of Commons.At the upper end, and on the right side of the
King's state, was a box for his Majesty, and on the left others for the
great ladies, and over head a gallery for ambassadors and public
ministers.At the lower end, or entrance, was a bar, and place for the
prisoner, the Lieutenant of the Tower of London, the ax-bearer and
guards, my Lord Stafford's two daughters, the Marchioness of Winchester
being one; there was likewise a box for my Lord to retire into.At the
right hand, in another box, somewhat higher, stood the witnesses; at the
left, the managers, in the name of the Commons of England, namely,
Serjeant Maynard (the great lawyer, the same who prosecuted the cause
against the Earl of Strafford forty years before, being now near eighty
years of age), Sir William Jones, late Attorney-General, Sir Francis
Winnington, a famous pleader, and Mr.Treby, now Recorder of London, not
appearing in their gowns as lawyers, but in their cloaks and swords, as
representing the Commons of England: to these were joined Mr.Poule, Colonel Titus, Sir Thomas Lee, all gentlemen
of quality, and noted parliamentary men.The first two days, in which
were read the commission and impeachment, were but a tedious entrance
into matter of fact, at which I was but little present.But, on
Thursday, I was commodiously seated among the Commons, when the
witnesses were sworn and examined.Oates
swore that he delivered a commission to Viscount Stafford from the Pope,
to be Paymaster-General to an army intended to be raised; Dugdale, that
being at Lord Aston's, the prisoner dealt with him plainly to murder his
Majesty; and Turberville, that at Paris he also proposed the same to
him.The depositions of my Lord's witnesses were taken, to
invalidate the King's witnesses; they were very slight persons, but,
being fifteen or sixteen, they took up all that day, and in truth they
rather did my Lord more injury than service.Came other witnesses of the Commons to corroborate
the King's, some being Peers, some Commons, with others of good quality,
who took off all the former day's objections, and set the King's
witnesses _recti in curia_.Sir William Jones summed up the evidence; to him
succeeded all the rest of the managers, and then Mr.Henry Poule made a
vehement oration.After this my Lord, as on all occasions, and often
during the trial, spoke in his own defense, denying the charge
altogether, and that he had never seen Oates, or Turberville, at the
time and manner affirmed: in truth, their testimony did little weigh
with me; Dugdale's only seemed to press hardest, to which my Lord spoke
a great while, but confusedly, without any method.One thing my Lord said as to Oates, which I confess did exceedingly
affect me: That a person who during his depositions should so vauntingly
brag that though he went over to the Church of Rome, yet he was never a
<DW7>, nor of their religion, all the time that he seemed to apostatize
from the Protestant, but only as a spy; though he confessed he took
their sacrament; worshiped images, went through all their oaths and
discipline of their proselytes, swearing secrecy and to be faithful, but
with intent to come over again and betray them; that such a hypocrite,
that had so deeply prevaricated as even to turn idolater (for so we of
the Church of England termed it), attesting God so solemnly that he was
entirely theirs and devoted to their interest, and consequently (as he
pretended) trusted; I say, that the witness of such a profligate wretch
should be admitted against the life of a peer,--this my Lord looked upon
as a monstrous thing, and such as must needs redound to the dishonor of
our religion and nation.And verily I am of his Lordship's opinion: such
a man's testimony should not be taken against the life of a dog.But the
merit of something material which he discovered against Coleman, put him
in such esteem with the Parliament, that now, I fancy, he stuck at
nothing, and thought everybody was to take what he said for Gospel.The
consideration of this, and some other circumstances, began to stagger
me; particularly how it was possible that one who went among the <DW7>s
on such a design, and pretended to be intrusted with so many letters and
commissions from the Pope and the party,--nay, and delivered them to so
many great persons,--should not reserve one of them to show, nor so much
as one copy of any commission, which he who had such dexterity in
opening letters might certainly have done, to the undeniable conviction
of those whom he accused; but, as I said, he gained credit on Coleman.But, as to others whom he so madly flew upon, I am little inclined to
believe his testimony, he being so slight a person, so passionate, ill
bred, and of such impudent behavior; nor is it likely that such piercing
politicians as the Jesuits should trust him with so high and so
dangerous secrets.On Tuesday, I was again at the trial, when judgment
was demanded; and, after my Lord had spoken what he could in denying the
fact, the managers answering the objections, the Peers adjourned to
their House, and within two hours returned again.There was, in the
meantime, this question put to the judges, "whether there being but one
witness to any single crime, or act, it could amount to convict a man of
treason."They gave an unanimous opinion that in case of treason they
all were overt acts for though no man should be condemned by one witness
for any one act, yet for several acts to the same intent, it was valid;
which was my Lord's case.This being past, and the Peers in their seats
again, the Lord Chancellor Finch (this day the Lord High-Steward)
removing to the woolsack next his Majesty's state, after summoning the
Lieutenant of the Tower to bring forth his prisoner, and proclamation
made for silence, demanded of every Peer (who were in all eighty-six)
whether William, Lord Viscount Stafford, were guilty of the treason laid
to his charge, or not guilty.Then the Peer spoken to, standing up, and laying his right hand upon his
breast, said guilty, or not guilty, upon my honor, and then sat down,
the Lord Steward noting their suffrages as they answered upon a paper:
when all had done, the number of not guilty being but 31, the guilty 55;
and then, after proclamation for silence again, the Lord Steward
directing his speech to the prisoner, against whom the ax was turned
edgeways and not before, in aggravation of his crime, he being ennobled
by the King's father, and since received many favors from his present
Majesty: after enlarging on his offense, deploring first his own
unhappiness that he who had never condemned any man before should now be
necessitated to begin with him, he then pronounced sentence of death by
hanging, drawing, and quartering, according to form, with great
solemnity and dreadful gravity; and, after a short pause, told the
prisoner that he believed the Lords would intercede for the omission of
some circumstances of his sentence, beheading only excepted; and then
breaking his white staff, the Court was dissolved.My Lord Stafford
during all this latter part spoke but little, and only gave their
Lordships thanks after the sentence was pronounced; and indeed behaved
himself modestly, and as became him.It was observed that all his own relations of his name and family
condemned him, except his nephew, the Earl of Arundel, son to the Duke
of Norfolk.And it must be acknowledged that the whole trial was carried
on with exceeding gravity: so stately and august an appearance I had
never seen before; for, besides the innumerable spectators of gentlemen
and foreign ministers, who saw and heard all the proceedings, the
prisoner had the consciences of all the Commons of England for his
accusers, and all the Peers to be his judges and jury.He had likewise
the assistance of what counsel he would, to direct him in his plea, who
stood by him.And yet I can hardly think that a person of his age and
experience should engage men whom he never saw before (and one of them
that came to visit him as a stranger at Paris) POINT BLANK to murder the
King: God only, who searches hearts, can discover the truth.Lord
Stafford was not a man beloved especially of his own family.This evening, looking out of my chamber window
toward the west, I saw a meteor of an obscure bright color, very much in
shape like the blade of a sword, the rest of the sky very serene and
clear.What this may portend, God only knows; but such another
phenomenon I remember to have seen in 1640, about the trial of the great
Earl of Strafford, preceding our bloody Rebellion.We have had of late several comets, which though I believe
appear from natural causes, and of themselves operate not, yet I cannot
despise them.They may be warnings from God, as they commonly are
forerunners of his animadversions.After many days and nights of snow,
cloudy and dark weather, the comet was very much wasted.My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a son,
christened Richard.A solemn public Fast that God would prevent all
Popish plots, avert his judgments, and give a blessing to the
proceedings of Parliament now assembled, and which struck at the
succession of the Duke of York.The Viscount Stafford was beheaded on Towerhill.I was at the wedding of my nephew, John Evelyn
of Wotton, married by the Bishop of Rochester at Westminster, in Henry
VII.'s chapel, to the daughter and heir of Mr.Eversfield, of Sussex,
her portion L8,000.The solemnity was kept with a few friends only at
Lady Beckford's, the lady's mother.Visited and dined at the Earl of Essex's, with whom I
spent most of the afternoon alone.Thence to my (yet living) godmother
and kinswoman, Mrs.Keightley, sister to Sir Thomas Evelyn and niece to
my father, being now eighty-six years of age, sprightly, and in perfect
health, her eyes serving her as well as ever, and of a comely
countenance, that one would not suppose her above fifty.Great
expectation of his Royal Highness's case as to the succession, against
which the House was set.An extraordinary sharp, cold spring, not yet a leaf on the trees, frost
and snow lying: while the whole nation was in the greatest ferment.Asaph) at
his house in Leicester Fields, now going to reside in his diocese.Brisbane's, Secretary to the Admiralty,
a learned and industrious person, whither came Dr.Burnet, to thank me
for some papers I had contributed toward his excellent "History of the
Reformation."[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th April, 1681.I dined at Don Pietro Ronquillo's, the Spanish
Ambassador, at Wild House, who used me with extraordinary civility.The
dinner was plentiful, half after the Spanish, half after the English
way.After dinner, he led me into his bedchamber, where we fell into a
long discourse concerning religion.Though he was a learned man in
politics, and an advocate, he was very ignorant in religion, and unable
to defend any point of controversy; he was, however, far from being
fierce.At parting, he earnestly wished me to apply humbly to the
blessed virgin to direct me, assuring me that he had known divers who
had been averse from the Roman Catholic religion, wonderfully
enlightened and convinced by her intercession.He importuned me to come
and visit him often.Came to dine with me Sir William Fermor, of
Northamptonshire, and Sir Christopher Wren, his Majesty's architect and
surveyor, now building the Cathedral of St.Paul, and the column in
memory of the city's conflagration, and was in hand with the building of
fifty parish churches.Came my Lady Sunderland, to desire that I would propose
a match to Sir Stephen Fox for her son, Lord Spencer, to marry Mrs.I excused myself all I was able; for the
truth is, I was afraid he would prove an extravagant man: for, though a
youth of extraordinary parts, and had an excellent education to render
him a worthy man, yet his early inclinations to extravagance made me
apprehensive, that I should not serve Sir Stephen by proposing it, like
a friend; this being now his only daughter, well-bred, and likely to
receive a large share of her father's opulence.Lord Sunderland was much
sunk in his estate by gaming and other prodigalities, and was now no
longer Secretary of State, having fallen into displeasure of the King
for siding with the Commons about the succession; but which, I am
assured, he did not do out of his own inclination, or for the
preservation of the Protestant religion, but by mistaking the ability of
the party to carry it.However, so earnest and importunate was the
Countess, that I did mention it to Sir Stephen, who said it was too
great an honor, that his daughter was very young, as well as my Lord,
and he was resolved never to marry her without the parties' mutual
liking; with other objections which I neither would or could contradict.He desired me to express to the Countess the great sense he had of the
honor done him, that his daughter and her son were too young, that he
would do nothing without her liking, which he did not think her capable
of expressing judiciously, till she was sixteen or seventeen years of
age, of which she now wanted four years, and that I would put it off as
civilly as I could.Our new curate preached, a pretty hopeful young man, yet
somewhat raw, newly come from college, full of Latin sentences, which in
time will wear off.There came to visit me Sir William Walter and Sir John
Elowes: and the next day, the Earl of Kildare, a young gentleman related
to my wife, and other company.There had scarce fallen any rain since
Christmas.I went to Hampton Court, when the Surrey gentlemen
presented their addresses to his Majesty, whose hand I kissed,
introduced by the Duke of Albemarle.Being at the Privy Council, I took
another occasion of discoursing with Sir Stephen Fox about his daughter
and to revive that business, and at least brought it to this: That in
case the young people liked one the other, after four years, he first
desiring to see a particular of my Lord's present estate if I could
transmit it to him privately, he would make her portion L14,000, though
to all appearance he might likely make it L50,000 as easily, his eldest
son having no child and growing very corpulent.It still continued so great a drought as had never been
known in England, and it was said to be universal.No sermon this afternoon, which I think did not
happen twice in this parish these thirty years; so gracious has God been
to it, and indeed to the whole nation: God grant that we abuse not this
great privilege either by our wantonness, schism, or unfaithfulness,
under such means as he has not favored any other nation under Heaven
besides![Sidenote: WOTTON]

23d August, 1681.I went to Wotton, and, on the following day, was
invited to Mr.Denzil Onslow's at his seat at Purford, where was much
company, and such an extraordinary feast, as I had hardly seen at any
country gentleman's table.What made it more remarkable was, that there
was not anything save what his estate about it did afford; as venison,
rabbits, hares, pheasants, partridges, pigeons, quails, poultry, all
sorts of fowl in season from his own decoy near his house, and all sorts
of fresh fish.After dinner we went to see sport at the decoy, where I
never saw so many herons.The seat stands on a flat, the ground pasture, rarely watered, and
exceedingly improved since Mr.Onslow bought it of Sir Robert Parkhurst,
who spent a fair estate.The house is timber, but commodious, and with
one ample dining-room, the hall adorned with paintings of fowl and
huntings, etc., the work of Mr.Barlow, who is excellent in this kind
from the life.Hussey (at Sutton in
Shere), who has a very pretty seat well watered, near my brother's.He
is the neatest husband for curious ordering his domestic and field
accommodations, and what pertains to husbandry, that I have ever seen,
as to his granaries, tacklings, tools, and utensils, plows, carts,
stables, wood piles, wood houses, even to hen roosts and hog troughs.Methought, I saw old Cato, or Varro, in him; all substantial, all in
exact order.The sole inconvenience he lies under, is the great quantity
of sand which the stream brings along with it, and fills his canals and
receptacles for fish too soon.The rest of my time of stay at Wotton was
spent in walking about the grounds and goodly woods, where I have in my
youth so often entertained my solitude; and so, on the 2d of September,
I once more returned to my home.Died my pretty grandchild, and was interred on the
8th [at Deptford].Dined with Sir Stephen Fox, who proposed to me the
purchasing of Chelsea College, which his Majesty had sometime since
given to our Society, and would now purchase it again to build a
hospital; or infirmary for soldiers there, in which he desired my
assistance as one of the Council of the Royal Society.I had another opportunity of visiting his
Majesty's private library at Whitehall.To Sir Samuel Morland's, to see his house and mechanics.I went with Monsieur Faubert about taking the
Countess of Bristol's house for an academy, he being lately come from
Paris for his religion, and resolving to settle here.I went to see Sir Thomas Bond's fine house and
garden at Peckham.I went to Camberwell, where that good man Dr.Parr
(late chaplain to Archbishop Usher) preached on Acts xvi.To Fulham, to visit the Bishop of London, in whose
garden I first saw the _Sedum arborescens_ in flower, which was
exceedingly beautiful.16, 17, before the
King, of the usurpation of the Church of Rome.This is one of the first
rank of pulpit men in the nation.I dined with the Earl of Essex who, after dinner
in his study, where we were alone, related to me how much he had been
scandalized and injured in the report of his being privy to the marriage
of his Lady's niece, the rich young widow of the late Lord Ogle, sole
daughter of the Earl of Northumberland; showing me a letter of Mr.Thynn's, excusing himself for not communicating his marriage to his
Lordship.He acquainted me also with the whole story of that unfortunate
lady being betrayed by her grandmother, the Countess of Northumberland,
and Colonel Bret, for money; and that though, upon the importunity of
the Duke of Monmouth, he had delivered to the grandmother a particular
of the jointure which Mr.Thynn pretended he would settle on the lady,
yet he totally discouraged the proceeding as by no means a competent
match for one that both by birth and fortune might have pretended to the
greatest prince in Christendom; that he also proposed the Earl of
Kingston, or the Lord Cranburn, but was by no means for Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th November, 1681.I dined with my worthy friend, Mr.Erskine, Master
of the Charter House, uncle to the Duchess of Monmouth; a wise and
learned gentleman, fitter to have been a privy councillor and minister
of state than to have been laid aside.I was at the audience of the Russian Ambassador
before both their Majesties in the Banqueting House.The presents were
carried before him, held up by his followers in two ranks before the
King's State, and consisted of tapestry (one suite of which was
doubtlessly brought from France as being of that fabric, the Ambassador
having passed through that kingdom as he came out of Spain), a large
Persian carpet, furs of sable and ermine, etc.; but nothing was so
splendid and exotic as the Ambassador who came soon after the King's
restoration.This present Ambassador was exceedingly offended that his
coach was not permitted to come into the Court, till, being told that no
King's Ambassador did, he was pacified, yet requiring an attestation of
it under the hand of Sir Charles Cotterell, the Master of the
Ceremonies; being, it seems, afraid he should offend his Master, if he
omitted the least punctilio.It was reported he condemned his son to
lose his head for shaving off his beard, and putting himself in the
French mode at Paris, and that he would have executed it, had not the
French King interceded--but qy.Sir Christopher Wren chosen President [of the Royal
Society], Mr.Plot, the ingenious author of
the "History of Oxfordshire."I saw the audience of the Morocco Ambassador,
his retinue not numerous.He was received in the Banqueting House, both
their Majesties being present.He came up to the throne without making
any sort of reverence, not bowing his head, or body.He spoke by a
renegado Englishman, for whose safe return there was a promise.They
were all clad in the Moorish habit, cassocks of  cloth, or silk,
with buttons and loops, over this an _alhaga_, or white woolen mantle,
so large as to wrap both head and body, a sash, or small turban,
naked-legged and armed, but with leather socks like the Turks, rich
scymetar, and large calico sleeved shirts.The Ambassador had a string
of pearls oddly woven in his turban.I fancy the old Roman habit was
little different as to the mantle and naked limbs.He was a handsome
person, well featured, of a wise look, subtle, and extremely civil.Their presents were lions and ostriches; their errand about a peace at
Tangier.But the concourse and tumult of the people was intolerable, so
as the officers could keep no order, which these strangers were
astonished at first, there being nothing so regular, exact, and
performed with such silence, as is on all these public occasions of
their country, and indeed over all the Turkish dominions.Dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, at the Abbey, it
being his marriage day, after twenty-four years.He related to me how he
had been treated by Sir William Temple, foreseeing that he might be a
delegate in the concern of my Lady Ogle now likely come in controversy
upon her marriage with Mr.Thynn; also how earnestly the late Earl of
Danby, Lord Treasurer, sought his friendship, and what plain and sincere
advice he gave him from time to time about his miscarriages and
partialities; particularly his outing Sir John Duncomb from being
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir Stephen Fox, above all, from being
Paymaster of the Army.The Treasurer's excuse and reason was, that Fox's
credit was so over great with the bankers and monied men, that he could
procure none but by his means, "for that reason," replied the Bishop, "I
would have made him my friend, Sir Stephen being a person both honest
and of credit."He told him likewise of his stateliness and difficulty
of access, and several other miscarriages, and which indeed made him
hated.To the Royal Society, where at the Council we
passed a new law for the more accurate consideration of candidates, as
whether they would really be useful; also concerning the honorary
members, that none should be admitted but by diploma.[Sidenote: LONDON]

This evening I was at the entertainment of the Morocco Ambassador at the
Duchess of Portsmouth's glorious apartments at Whitehall, where was a
great banquet of sweetmeats and music; but at which both the Ambassador
and his retinue behaved themselves with extraordinary moderation and
modesty, though placed about a long table, a lady between two Moors, and
among these were the King's natural children, namely, Lady Lichfield and
Sussex, the Duchess of Portsmouth, Nelly, etc., concubines, and cattle
of that sort, as splendid as jewels and excess of bravery could make
them; the Moors neither admiring nor seeming to regard anything,
furniture or the like, with any earnestness, and but decently tasting of
the banquet.They drank a little milk and water, but not a drop of wine;
they also drank of a sorbet and jacolatt;[45] did not look about, or
stare on the ladies, or express the least surprise, but with a courtly
negligence in pace, countenance, and whole behavior, answering only to
such questions as were asked with a great deal of wit and gallantry, and
so gravely took leave with this compliment, that God would bless the
Duchess of Portsmouth and the Prince, her son meaning the little Duke of
Richmond.The King came in at the latter end, just as the Ambassador was
going away.In this manner was this slave (for he was no more at home)
entertained by most of the nobility in town, and went often to Hyde Park
on horseback, where he and his retinue showed their extraordinary
activity in horsemanship, and flinging and catching their lances at full
speed; they rode very short, and could stand upright at full speed,
managing their spears with incredible agility.He went sometimes to the
theaters, where, upon any foolish or fantastical action, he could not
forbear laughing, but he endeavored to hide it with extraordinary
modesty and gravity.In a word, the Russian Ambassador, still at Court
behaved himself like a clown compared to this civil heathen.This evening, Sir Stephen Fox acquainted me again
with his Majesty's resolution of proceeding in the erection of a Royal
Hospital for emerited soldiers on that spot of ground which the Royal
Society had sold to his Majesty for L1,300, and that he would settle
L5,000 per annum on it, and build to the value of L20,000 for the relief
and reception of four companies, namely, 400 men, to be as in a college,
or monastery.I was therefore desired by Sir Stephen (who had not only
the whole managing of this, but was, as I perceived, himself to be a
grand benefactor, as well it became him who had gotten so vast an estate
by the soldiers) to assist him, and consult what method to cast it in,
as to the government.So, in his study we arranged the governor,
chaplain, steward, housekeeper, chirurgeon, cook, butler, gardener,
porter, and other officers, with their several salaries and
entertainments.I would needs have a library, and mentioned several
books, since some soldiers might possibly be studious, when they were at
leisure to recollect.Thus we made the first calculations, and set down
our thoughts to be considered and digested better, to show his Majesty
and the Archbishop.He also engaged me to consider of what laws and
orders were fit for the government, which was to be in every respect as
strict as in any religious convent.After supper, came in the famous treble, Mr.Abel, newly returned from
Italy; I never heard a more excellent voice; one would have sworn it had
been a woman's, it was so high, and so well and skillfully managed,
being accompanied by Signor Francesco on the harpsichord.Pepys, late Secretary to the Admiralty, showed
me a large folio containing the whole mechanic part and art of building
royal ships and men-of-war, made by Sir Anthony Dean, being so accurate
a piece from the very keel to the lead block, rigging, guns, victualing,
manning, and even to every individual pin and nail, in a method so
astonishing and curious, with a draught, both geometrical and in
perspective, and several sections, that I do not think the world can
show the like.My daughter, Mary, began to learn music of Signor
Bartholomeo, and dancing of Monsieur Isaac, reputed the best masters.Having had several violent fits of an ague, recourse was had to bathing
my legs in milk up to the knees, made as hot as I could endure it: and
sitting so in it in a deep churn, or vessel, covered with blankets, and
drinking _carduus_ posset, then going to bed and sweating, I not only
missed that expected fit, but had no more, only continued weak, that I
could not go to church till Ash Wednesday, which I had not missed, I
think, so long in twenty years, so gracious had God been to me.After this warning and admonition, I now began to look over and
methodize all my writings, accounts, letters, papers; inventoried the
goods, and other articles of the house, and put things into the best
order I could, and made my will; that now, growing in years, I might
have none of these secular things and concerns to distract me, when it
should please Almighty God to call me from this transitory life.With
this, I prepared some special meditations and devotions for the time of
sickness.The Lord Jesus grant them to be salutary for my poor soul in
that day, that I may obtain mercy and acceptance!My second grandchild was born, and christened the next
day by our vicar at Sayes Court, by the name of John.[46] I beseech God
to bless him![Footnote 46: Who became his successor, and was created a baronet in
    1713.]I went to church: our vicar preached on
Proverbs, showing what care and vigilance was required for the keeping
of the heart upright.The Holy Communion followed, on which I gave God
thanks for his gracious dealing with me in my late sickness, and
affording me this blessed opportunity of praising him in the
congregation, and receiving the cup of salvation with new and serious
resolutions.Came to see and congratulate my recovery, Sir John Lowther, Mr.Pepys, Sir Anthony Deane, and Mr.This day was executed Colonel Vrats, and some of his
accomplices, for the execrable murder of Mr.Thynn, set on by the
principal Koningsmark.He went to execution like an undaunted hero, as
one that had done a friendly office for that base coward, Count
Koningsmark, who had hopes to marry his widow, the rich Lady Ogle, and
was acquitted by a corrupt jury, and so got away.Vrats told a friend of
mine who accompanied him to the gallows, and gave him some advice that
he did not value dying of a rush, and hoped and believed God would deal
with him like a gentleman.Never man went, so unconcerned for his sad
fate.I went to see the corpse of that obstinate creature,
Colonel Vrats, the King permitting that his body should be transported
to his own country, he being of a good family, and one of the first
embalmed by a particular art, invented by one William Russell, a
coffin-maker, which preserved the body without disboweling, or to
appearance using any bituminous matter.The flesh was florid, soft, and
full, as if the person were only sleeping.He had now been dead near
fifteen days, and lay exposed in a very rich coffin lined with lead, too
magnificent for so daring and horrid a murderer.[Sidenote: LONDON]

At the meeting of the Royal Society were exhibited some pieces of amber
sent by the Duke of Brandenburg, in one of which was a spider, in
another a gnat, both very entire.There was a discourse of the tingeing
of glass, especially with red, and the difficulty of finding any red
color effectual to penetrate glass, among the glass-painters; that the
most diaporous, as blue, yellow, etc., did not enter into the substance
of what was ordinarily painted, more than very shallow, unless
incorporated in the metal itself, other reds and whites not at all
beyond the superfices.To the Royal Society, where at a Council was regulated
what collections should be published monthly, as formerly the
transactions, which had of late been discontinued, but were now much
called for by the curious abroad and at home.I went this afternoon with several of the Royal
Society to a supper which was all dressed, both fish and flesh, in
Monsieur Papin's digestors, by which the hardest bones of beef itself,
and mutton, were made as soft as cheese, without water or other liquor,
and with less than eight ounces of coals, producing an incredible
quantity of gravy; and for close of all, a jelly made of the bones of
beef, the best for clearness and good relish, and the most delicious
that I had ever seen, or tasted.We ate pike and other fish, bones and
all, without impediment; but nothing exceeded the pigeons, which tasted
just as if baked in a pie, all these being stewed in their own juice,
without any addition of water save what swam about the digestor, as _in
balneo_; the natural juice of all these provisions acting on the grosser
substances, reduced the hardest bones to tenderness; but it is best
descanted with more particulars for extracting tinctures, preserving and
stewing fruit, and saving fuel, in Dr.Papin's book, published and
dedicated to our Society of which he is a member.He is since gone to
Venice with the late Resident here (and also a member of our Society),
who carried this excellent mechanic, philosopher, and physician, to set
up a philosophical meeting in that city.This philosophical supper
caused much mirth among us, and exceedingly pleased all the company.I
sent a glass of the jelly to my wife, to the reproach of all that the
ladies ever made of their best hartshorn.[47]

    [Footnote 47: Denys Papin, a French physician and mathematician, who
    possessed so remarkable a knowledge of mathematics, that he very
    nearly brought the invention of the steam engine into working order.Boyle in his pneumatic experiments, and was
    afterward mathematical professor at Marburg.The season was unusually wet, with rain and thunder.I was desired by Sir Stephen Fox and Sir Christopher
Wren to accompany them to Lambeth, with the plot and design of the
college to be built at Chelsea, to have the Archbishop's approbation.It
was a quadrangle of 200 feet square, after the dimensions of the larger
quadrangle at Christ church, Oxford, for the accommodation of 440
persons, with governor and officers.The Duke and Duchess of York were just now come to London, after his
escape and shipwreck, as he went by sea for Scotland.At the Rolls' chapel preached the famous Dr.10, describing excellently well what was meant by election;
viz, not the effect of any irreversible decree, but so called because
they embraced the Gospel readily, by which they became elect, or
precious to God.It would be very needless to make our calling and
election sure, were they irreversible and what the rigid Presbyterians
pretend.Lawrence's church, a new and cheerful
pile.I gave notice to the Bishop of Rochester of what
Maimburg had published about the motives of the late Duchess of York's
perversion, in his "History of Calvinism;" and did myself write to the
Bishop of Winchester about it, who being concerned in it, I urged him to
set forth his vindication.The Morocco Ambassador being admitted an honorary member
of the Royal Society, and subscribing his name and titles in Arabic, I
was deputed by the Council to go and compliment him.The Bantam, or East India Ambassadors (at this time we
had in London the Russian, Moroccan, and Indian Ambassadors), being
invited to dine at Lord George Berkeley's (now Earl), I went to the
entertainment to contemplate the exotic guests.They were both very
hard-favored, and much resembling in countenance some sort of monkeys.We ate at two tables, the Ambassadors and interpreter by themselves.Their garments were rich Indian silks, flowered with gold, viz, a close
waistcoat to their knees, drawers, naked legs, and on their heads caps
made like fruit baskets.They wore poisoned daggers at their bosoms, the
hafts carved with some ugly serpents' or devils' heads, exceedingly
keen, and of Damascus metal.The second Ambassador
(sent it seems to succeed in case the first should die by the way in so
tedious a journey), having been at Mecca, wore a Turkish or Arab sash, a
little part of the linen hanging down behind his neck, with some other
difference of habit, and was half a <DW64>, bare legged and naked feet,
and deemed a very holy man.They sat cross-legged like Turks, and
sometimes in the posture of apes and monkeys; their nails and teeth as
black as jet, and shining, which being the effect, as to their teeth, of
perpetually chewing betel to preserve them from the toothache, much
raging in their country, is esteemed beautiful.The first ambassador was of an olive hue, a flat face, narrow eyes,
squat nose, and Moorish lips, no hair appeared; they wore several rings
of silver, gold and copper on their fingers, which was a token of
knighthood, or nobility.They were of Java Major, whose princes have
been turned Mahometans not above fifty years since; the inhabitants are
still pagans and idolaters.They seemed of a dull and heavy
constitution, not wondering at any thing they saw; but exceedingly
astonished how our law gave us propriety in our estates, and so thinking
we were all kings, for they could not be made to comprehend how subjects
could possess anything but at the pleasure of their Prince, they being
all slaves; they were pleased with the notion, and admired our
happiness.They were very sober, and I believe subtle in their way.Their meat was cooked, carried up, and they attended by several fat
slaves, who had no covering save drawers, which appeared very uncouth
and loathsome.They ate their pilaw, and other spoon-meat, without
spoons, taking up their pottage in the hollow of their fingers, and very
dexterously flung it into their mouths without spilling a drop.Came to dine with me, the Duke of Grafton and the young
Earl of Ossory, son to my most dear deceased friend.Went to visit our good neighbor, Mr.Bohun, whose whole
house is a cabinet of all elegancies, especially Indian; in the hall are
contrivances of Japan screens, instead of wainscot; and there is an
excellent pendule clock inclosed in the curious flowerwork of Mr.Gibbons, in the middle of the vestibule.The landscapes of the screens
represent the manner of living, and country of the Chinese.But, above
all, his lady's cabinet is adorned on the fret, ceiling, and
chimney-piece, with Mr.There are also some of
Streeter's best paintings, and many rich curiosities of gold and silver
as growing in the mines.The gardens are exactly kept, and the whole
place very agreeable and well watered.The owners are good neighbors,
and Mr.Bohun has also built and endowed a hospital for eight poor
people, with a pretty chapel, and every necessary accommodation.To the Bishop of London at Fulham, to review the
additions which Mr.Marshall had made to his curious book of flowers in
miniature, and collection of insects.With Sir Stephen Fox, to survey the foundations of the
Royal Hospital begun at Chelsea.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th August, 1682.The Council of the Royal Society had it recommended
to them to be trustees and visitors, or supervisors, of the Academy
which Monsieur Faubert did hope to procure to be built by subscription
of worthy gentlemen and noblemen, for the education of youth, and to
lessen the vast expense the nation is at yearly by sending children into
France to be taught military exercises.We thought to give him all the
encouragement our recommendation could procure.Rogers, an acquaintance of mine
long since at Padua.He was then Consul of the English nation, and
student in that University, where he proceeded Doctor in Physic;
presenting me now with the Latin oration he lately made upon the famous
Dr.Harvey's anniversary in the College of Physicians, at London.This night I saw another comet, near Cancer, very
bright, but the stream not so long as the former.Supped at Lord Clarendon's, with Lord Hyde, his
brother, now the great favorite, who invited himself to dine at my house
the Tuesday following.Being my birthday, and I now entering my great
climacterical of 63, after serious recollections of the years past,
giving Almighty God thanks for all his merciful preservations and
forbearance, begging pardon for my sins and unworthiness, and his
blessing on me the year entering, I went with my Lady Fox to survey her
building, and give some directions for the garden at Chiswick; the
architect is Mr.May,--somewhat heavy and thick, and not so well
understood: the garden much too narrow, the place without water, near a
highway, and near another great house of my Lord Burlington, little land
about it, so that I wonder at the expense; but women will have their
will.I was invited to dine with Monsieur Lionberg, the
Swedish Resident, who made a magnificent entertainment, it being the
birthday of his King.There dined the Duke of Albemarle, Duke of
Hamilton, Earl of Bath, Earl of Aylesbury, Lord Arran, Lord Castlehaven,
the son of him who was executed fifty years before, and several great
persons.I was exceedingly afraid of drinking (it being a Dutch feast),
but the Duke of Albemarle being that night to wait on his Majesty,
excess was prohibited; and, to prevent all, I stole away and left the
company as soon as we rose from table.[Sidenote: LONDON]

28th November, 1682.I went to the Council of the Royal Society, for the
auditing the last year's account, where I was surprised with a fainting
fit that for a time took away my sight; but God being merciful to me, I
recovered it after a short repose.I was exceedingly endangered and importuned to
stand the election,[48] having so many voices, but by favor of my
friends, and regard of my remote dwelling, and now frequent infirmities,
I desired their suffrages might be transferred to Sir John Hoskins, one
of the Masters of Chancery; a most learned virtuoso as well as lawyer,
who accordingly was elected.[Footnote 48: For President of the Royal Society.]Went to congratulate Lord Hyde (the great favorite)
newly made Earl of Rochester, and lately marrying his eldest daughter to
the Earl of Ossory.I sold my East India adventure of L250 principal
for L750 to the Royal Society, after I had been in that company
twenty-five years, being extraordinarily advantageous, by the blessing
of God.Sir Francis North, son to the Lord North, and Lord
Chief Justice, being made Lord Keeper on the death of the Earl of
Nottingham, the Lord Chancellor, I went to congratulate him.He is a
most knowing, learned, and ingenious man, and, besides being an
excellent person, of an ingenious and sweet disposition, very skillful
in music, painting, the new philosophy, and politer studies.Supped at Sir Joseph Williamson's, where was a
select company of our Society, Sir William Petty, Dr.Gale (that learned
schoolmaster of St.The
conversation was philosophical and cheerful, on divers considerable
questions proposed; as of the hereditary succession of the Roman
Emperors; the Pica mentioned in the preface to our Common Prayer, which
signifies only the Greek _Kalendarium_.James's, when I saw the sea
charts of Captain Collins, which that industrious man now brought to
show the Duke, having taken all the coasting from the mouth of the
Thames, as far as Wales, and exactly measuring every creek, island,
rock, soundings, harbors, sands, and tides, intending next spring to
proceed till he had finished the whole island, and that measured by
chains and other instruments: a most exact and useful undertaking.He
affirmed, that of all the maps put out since, there are none extant so
true as those of Joseph Norden, who gave us the first in Queen
Elizabeth's time; all since him are erroneous.This morning I received the news of the death of my
father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, Knt.and Bart., who died at my house
at Sayes Court this day at ten in the morning, after he had labored
under the gout and dropsy for nearly six months, in the 78th year of his
age.The funeral was solemnized on the 19th at Deptford, with as much
decency as the dignity of the person, and our relation to him, required;
there being invited the Bishop of Rochester, several noblemen, knights,
and all the fraternity of the Trinity Company, of which he had been
Master, and others of the country.The vicar preached a short but proper
discourse on Psalm xxxix.10, on the frailty of our mortal condition,
concluding with an ample and well-deserved eulogy on the defunct,
relating to his honorable birth and ancestors, education, learning in
Greek and Latin, modern languages, travels, public employments, signal
loyalty, character abroad, and particularly the honor of supporting the
Church of England in its public worship during its persecution by the
late rebels' usurpation and regicide, by the suffrages of divers
Bishops, Doctors of the Church, and others, who found such an asylum in
his house and family at Paris, that in their disputes with the <DW7>s
(then triumphing over it as utterly lost) they used to argue for its
visibility and existence from Sir R. Browne's chapel and assembly there.Then he spoke of his great and loyal sufferings during thirteen years'
exile with his present Majesty, his return with him in the signal year
1660; his honorable employment at home, his timely recess to recollect
himself, his great age, infirmities, and death.He gave to the Trinity Corporation that land in Deptford on which are
built those almshouses for twenty-four widows of emerited seamen.He was
born the famous year of the Gunpowder Treason, in 1605, and being the
last [male] of his family, left my wife, his only daughter, heir.His
grandfather, Sir Richard Browne, was the great instrument under the
great Earl of Leicester (favorite to Queen Elizabeth) in his government
of the Netherland.He was Master of the Household to King James, and
Cofferer; I think was the first who regulated the compositions through
England for the King's household, provisions, progresses,[49] etc.,
which was so high a service, and so grateful to the whole nation, that
he had acknowledgments and public thanks sent him from all the counties;
he died by the rupture of a vein in a vehement speech he made about the
compositions in a Parliament of King James.By his mother's side he was
a Gunson, Treasurer of the Navy in the reigns of Henry VIII., Queen
Mary, and Queen Elizabeth, and, as by his large pedigree appears,
related to divers of the English nobility.Thus ended this honorable
person, after so many changes and tossings to and fro, in the same house
where he was born."Lord teach us so to number our days, that we may
apply our hearts unto wisdom!"[Footnote 49: Notice was taken of this in a previous passage of the
    "Diary."The different counties were bound to supply provisions of
    various kinds, and these were collected by officers called
    purveyors, whose extortions often excited the attention of
    Parliament.]By a special clause in his will, he ordered that his body should be
buried in the churchyard under the southeast window of the chancel,
adjoining to the burying places of his ancestors, since they came out of
Essex into Sayes Court, he being much offended at the novel custom of
burying everyone within the body of the church and chancel; that being a
favor heretofore granted to martyrs and great persons; this excess of
making churches charnel houses being of ill and irreverend example, and
prejudicial to the health of the living, besides the continual
disturbance of the pavement and seats, and several other indecencies.Hall, the pious Bishop of Norwich, would also be so interred, as may
be read in his testament.I went to see Sir Josiah Child's prodigious cost in
planting walnut trees about his seat, and making fish ponds, many miles
in circuit, in Epping Forest, in a barren spot, as oftentimes these
suddenly monied men for the most part seat themselves.He from a
merchant's apprentice, and management of the East India Company's stock,
being arrived to an estate (it is said) of L200,000; and lately married
his daughter to the eldest son of the Duke of Beaufort, late Marquis of
Worcester, with L50,000 portional present, and various expectations.Houblon's, a rich and gentle French merchant, who was
building a house in the Forest, near Sir J. Child's, in a place where
the late Earl of Norwich dwelt some time, and which came from his lady,
the widow of Mr.It will be a pretty villa, about five miles from
Whitechapel.Horneck preach at the Savoy Church,
on Phil.He was a German born, a most pathetic preacher, a person
of a saint-like life, and hath written an excellent treatise on
Consideration.Whistler's, at the Physicians' College,
with Sir Thomas Millington, both learned men; Dr.W. the most facetious
man in nature, and now Censor of the college.I was here consulted where
they should build their library; it is a pity this college is built so
near Newgate Prison, and in so obscure a hole, a fault in placing most
of our public buildings and churches in the city, through the avarice of
some few men, and his Majesty not overruling it, when it was in his
power after the dreadful conflagration.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st March, 1683.Tenison preached at Whitehall on 1 Cor.12; I
esteem him to be one of the most profitable preachers in the Church of
England, being also of a most holy conversation, very learned and
ingenious.The pains he takes and care of his parish will, I fear, wear
him out, which would be an inexpressible loss.Charleton's lecture on the heart in
the Anatomy Theater at the Physicians' College.To London, in order to my passing the following week,
for the celebration of the Easter now approaching, there being in the
Holy Week so many eminent preachers officiating at the Court and other
places.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1683.There was in the afternoon, according to
custom, a sermon before the King, at Whitehall; Dr.Sprat preached for
the Bishop of Rochester.I was at the launching of the last of the thirty ships
ordered to be newly built by Act of Parliament, named the "Neptune," a
second rate, one of the goodliest vessels of the whole navy, built by my
kind neighbor, young Mr.Shish, his Majesty's master shipwright of this
dock.I went to Blackheath, to see the new fair, being the
first procured by the Lord Dartmouth.This was the first day, pretended
for the sale of cattle, but I think in truth to enrich the new tavern at
the bowling-green, erected by Snape, his Majesty's farrier, a man full
of projects.There appeared nothing but an innumerable assembly of
drinking people from London, peddlars, etc., and I suppose it too near
London to be of any great use to the country.March was unusually hot and dry, and all April excessively wet.I planted all the out limits of the garden and long walks with
holly.[50]

Duke of Norfolk, to ask whether he would part with any of his cartoons
and other drawings of Raphael, and the great masters; he told me if he
might sell them all together he would, but that the late Sir Peter Lely
(our famous painter) had gotten some of his best.The person who desired
me to treat for them was Vander Douse, grandson to that great scholar,
contemporary and friend of Joseph Scaliger.Came to dinner and visited me Sir Richard Anderson, of
Pendley, and his lady, with whom I went to London.On my return home from the Royal Society, I found Mr.Wilbraham, a young gentleman of Cheshire.The Lord Dartmouth was elected Master of the Trinity
House; son to George Legge, late Master of the Ordnance, and one of the
grooms of the bedchamber; a great favorite of the Duke's, an active and
understanding gentleman in sea affairs.To our Society, where we received the Count de
Zinzendorp, Ambassador from the Duke of Saxony, a fine young man; we
showed him divers experiments on the magnet, on which subject the
Society were upon.I went to Windsor, dining by the way at Chiswick, at
Sir Stephen Fox's, where I found Sir Robert Howard (that universal
pretender), and Signor Verrio, who brought his draught and designs for
the painting of the staircase of Sir Stephen's new house.That which was new at Windsor since I was last there, and was surprising
to me, was the incomparable fresco painting in St.George's Hall,
representing the legend of St.George, and triumph of the Black Prince,
and his reception by Edward III.; the volto, or roof, not totally
finished; then the Resurrection in the Chapel, where the figure of the
Ascension is, in my opinion, comparable to any paintings of the most
famous Roman masters; the Last Supper, also over the altar.I liked the
contrivance of the unseen organ behind the altar, nor less the
stupendous and beyond all description the incomparable carving of our
Gibbons, who is, without controversy, the greatest master both for
invention and rareness of work, that the world ever had in any age; nor
doubt I at all that he will prove as great a master in the statuary art.Verrio's invention is admirable, his ordnance full and flowing, antique
and heroical; his figures move; and, if the walls hold (which is the
only doubt by reason of the salts which in time and in this moist
climate prejudice), the work will preserve his name to ages.There was now the terrace brought almost round the old castle; the
grass made clean, even, and curiously turfed; the avenues to the new
park, and other walks, planted with elms and limes, and a pretty canal,
and receptacle for fowl; nor less observable and famous is the throwing
so huge a quantity of excellent water to the enormous height of the
castle, for the use of the whole house, by an extraordinary invention of
Sir Samuel Morland.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with the Earls of
Bath, Castlehaven, Lords Viscounts Falconberg, Falkland, Bishop of
London, the Grand Master of Malta, brother to the Duke de Vendome (a
young wild spark), and Mr.After evening prayer, I
walked in the park with my Lord Clarendon, where we fell into discourse
of the Bishop of Salisbury (Dr.Seth Ward), his subtlety, etc.Durell, late Dean of Windsor, being dead, Dr.Turner, one of the Duke's
chaplains was made dean.I visited my Lady Arlington, groom of the stole to her Majesty, who
being hardly set down to supper, word was brought her that the Queen was
going into the park to walk, it being now near eleven at night; the
alarm caused the Countess to rise in all haste, and leave her supper to
us.By this one may take an estimate of the extreme slavery and subjection
that courtiers live in, who had not time to eat and drink at their
pleasure.It put me in mind of Horace's "Mouse," and to bless God for my
own private condition.Here was Monsieur de l'Angle, the famous minister of Charenton, lately
fled from the persecution in France, concerning the deplorable condition
of the Protestants there.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th June, 1683.I was present, and saw and heard the humble submission
and petition of the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen, on behalf of the
city of London, on the _quo warranto_ against their charter which they
delivered to his Majesty in the presence chamber.It was delivered
kneeling, and then the King and Council went into the council chamber,
the mayor and his brethren attending still in the presence chamber.After a short space they were called in, and my Lord Keeper made a
speech to them, exaggerating the disorderly and riotous behavior in the
late election, and polling for Papillon and Du Bois after the Common
hall had been formally dissolved: with other misdemeanors, libels on the
government, etc., by which they had incurred his Majesty's high
displeasure: and that but for this submission, and under such articles
as the King should require their obedience to, he would certainly enter
judgment against them, which hitherto he had suspended.The things
required were as follows: that they should neither elect mayor,
sheriffs, aldermen, recorder, common Serjeant town clerk, coroner, nor
steward of Southwark, without his Majesty's approbation; and that if
they presented any his Majesty did not like, they should proceed in
wonted manner to a second choice; if that was disapproved, his Majesty
to nominate them; and if within five days they thought good to assent to
this, all former miscarriages should be forgotten.And so they tamely
parted with their so ancient privileges after they had dined and been
treated by the King.What
the consequences will prove, time will show.Divers of the old and most
learned lawyers and judges were of opinion that they could not forfeit
their charter, but might be personally punished for their misdemeanors;
but the plurality of the younger judges and rising men judged it
otherwise.The Popish Plot also, which had hitherto made such a noise, began now
sensibly to dwindle, through the folly, knavery, impudence, and
giddiness of Oates, so as the <DW7>s began to hold up their heads
higher than ever, and those who had fled, flocked to London from abroad.Such sudden changes and eager doings there had been without anything
steady or prudent, for these last seven years.I returned to town in a coach with the Earl of
Clarendon, when passing by the glorious palace of his father, built but
a few years before, which they were now demolishing, being sold to
certain undertakers, I turned my head the contrary way till the coach
had gone past it, lest I might minister occasion of speaking of it;
which must needs have grieved him, that in so short a time their pomp
was fallen.After the Popish Plot, there was now a new and (as
they called it) a Protestant Plot discovered, that certain Lords and
others should design the assassination of the King and the Duke as they
were to come from Newmarket, with a general rising of the nation, and
especially of the city of London, disaffected to the present Government.Upon which were committed to the Tower, the Lord Russell, eldest son of
the Earl of Bedford, the Earl of Essex, Mr.Algernon Sidney, son to the
old Earl of Leicester, Mr.Trenchard, Hampden, Lord Howard of Escrick,
and others.A proclamation was issued against my Lord Grey, the Duke of
Monmouth, Sir Thomas Armstrong, and one Ferguson, who had escaped beyond
sea; of these some were said to be for killing the King, others for only
seizing on him, and persuading him to new counsels, on the pretense of
the danger of Popery, should the Duke live to succeed, who was now again
admitted to the councils and cabinet secrets.The Lords Essex and
Russell were much deplored, for believing they had any evil intention
against the King, or the Church; some thought they were cunningly drawn
in by their enemies for not approving some late counsels and management
relating to France, to Popery, to the persecution of the Dissenters,
etc.They were discovered by the Lord Howard of Escrick and some false
brethren of the club, and the design happily broken; had it taken
effect, it would, to all appearance, have exposed the Government to
unknown and dangerous events; which God avert!Was born my granddaughter at Sayes Court, and christened by the name of
Martha Maria, our Vicar officiating.I pray God bless her, and may she
choose the better part![Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1683.As I was visiting Sir Thomas Yarborough and his Lady,
in Covent Garden, the astonishing news was brought to us of the Earl of
Essex having cut his throat, having been but three days a prisoner in
the Tower, and this happened on the very day and instant that Lord
Russell was on his trial, and had sentence of death.This accident
exceedingly amazed me, my Lord Essex being so well known by me to be a
person of such sober and religious deportment, so well at his ease, and
so much obliged to the King.It is certain the King and Duke were at the
Tower, and passed by his window about the same time this morning, when
my Lord asking for a razor, shut himself into a closet, and perpetrated
the horrid act.Yet it was wondered by some how it was possible he
should do it in the manner he was found, for the wound was so deep and
wide, that being cut through the gullet, windpipe, and both the
jugulars, it reached to the very vertebrae of the neck, so that the head
held to it by a very little skin as it were; the gapping too of the
razor, and cutting his own fingers, was a little strange; but more, that
having passed the jugulars he should have strength to proceed so far,
that an executioner could hardly have done more with an ax.The fatal news coming to Hicks's Hall upon the article of my Lord
Russell's trial, was said to have had no little influence on the Jury
and all the Bench to his prejudice.Others said that he had himself on
some occasions hinted that in case he should be in danger of having his
life taken from him by any public misfortune, those who thirsted for his
estate should miss of their aim; and that he should speak favorably of
that Earl of Northumberland,[51] and some others, who made away with
themselves; but these are discourses so unlike his sober and prudent
conversation that I have no inclination to credit them.What might
instigate him to this devilish act, I am not able to conjecture.My Lord
Clarendon, his brother-in-law, who was with him but the day before,
assured me he was then very cheerful, and declared it to be the effect
of his innocence and loyalty; and most believe that his Majesty had no
severe intentions against him, though he was altogether inexorable as to
Lord Russell and some of the rest.For my part, I believe the crafty and
ambitious Earl of Shaftesbury had brought them into some dislike of the
present carriage of matters at Court, not with any design of destroying
the monarchy (which Shaftesbury had in confidence and for unanswerable
reasons told me he would support to his last breath, as having seen and
felt the misery of being under mechanic tyranny), but perhaps of setting
up some other whom he might govern, and frame to his own platonic fancy,
without much regard to the religion established under the hierarchy, for
which he had no esteem; but when he perceived those whom he had engaged
to rise, fail of his expectations, and the day past, reproaching his
accomplices that a second day for an exploit of this nature was never
successful, he gave them the slip, and got into Holland, where the fox
died, three months before these unhappy Lords and others were discovered
or suspected.Every one deplored Essex and Russell, especially the last,
as being thought to have been drawn in on pretense only of endeavoring
to rescue the King from his present councilors, and secure religion from
Popery, and the nation from arbitrary government, now so much
apprehended; while the rest of those who were fled, especially Ferguson
and his gang, had doubtless some bloody design to get up a Commonwealth,
and turn all things topsy-turvy.Of the same tragical principles is
Sydney.[Footnote 51: Henry Percy, eighth Earl of Northumberland, shot
    himself in the Tower, to which he had been committed on a charge of
    high treason in June, 1585.]I had this day much discourse with Monsieur Pontaq, son to the famous
and wise prime President of Bordeaux.This gentleman was owner of that
excellent _vignoble_ of Pontaq and O'Brien, from whence come the
choicest of our Bordeaux wines; and I think I may truly say of him, what
was not so truly said of St.Paul, that much learning had made him mad.He had studied well in philosophy, but chiefly the Rabbins, and was
exceedingly addicted to cabalistical fancies, an eternal hablador
[romancer], and half distracted by reading abundance of the extravagant
Eastern Jews.He spoke all languages, was very rich, had a handsome
person, and was well bred, about forty-five years of age.Fraser, a learned Scotch gentleman, whom
I had formerly recommended to Lord Berkeley for the instruction and
government of his son, since dead at sea.He had now been in Holland at
the sale of the learned Heinsius's library, and showed me some very rare
and curious books, and some MSS., which he had purchased to good value.There were three or four Herbals in miniature, accurately done, divers
Roman antiquities of Verona, and very many books of Aldus's impression.A stranger, an old man, preached on Jerem.8, the
not hearkening to instruction, portentous of desolation to a people;
much after Bishop Andrew's method, full of logical divisions, in short
and broken periods, and Latin sentences, now quite out of fashion in the
pulpit, which is grown into a far more profitable way, of plain and
practical discourses, of which sort this nation, or any other, never had
greater plenty or more profitable (I am confident); so much has it to
answer for thriving no better on it.The public was now in great consternation on the late plot and
conspiracy; his Majesty very melancholy, and not stirring without double
guards; all the avenues and private doors about Whitehall and the Park
shut up, few admitted to walk in it.The <DW7>s, in the meantime, very
jocund; and indeed with reason, seeing their own plot brought to
nothing, and turned to ridicule, and now a conspiracy of Protestants, as
they called them.The Turks were likewise in hostility against the German Emperor, almost
masters of the Upper Hungary, and drawing toward Vienna.On the other
side, the French King (who it is believed brought in the infidels)
disturbing his Spanish and Dutch neighbors, having swallowed up almost
all Flanders, pursuing his ambition of a fifth universal monarchy; and
all this blood and disorder in Christendom had evidently its rise from
our defections at home, in a wanton peace, minding nothing but luxury,
ambition, and to procure money for our vices.To this add our irreligion
and atheism, great ingratitude, and self-interest; the apostacy of some,
and the suffering the French to grow so great, and the Hollanders so
weak.In a word, we were wanton, mad, and surfeiting with prosperity;
every moment unsettling the old foundations, and never constant to
anything.The Lord in mercy avert the sad omen, and that we do not
provoke him till he bear it no longer!This summer did we suffer twenty French men-of-war to pass our Channel
toward the Sound, to help the Danes against the Swedes, who had
abandoned the French interest, we not having ready sufficient to guard
our coasts, or take cognizance of what they did; though the nation never
had more, or a better navy, yet the sea had never so slender a fleet.George, Prince of Denmark, who had landed this day,
came to marry the Lady Anne, daughter to the Duke; so I returned home,
having seen the young gallant at dinner at Whitehall.Several of the conspirators of the lower form were
executed at Tyburn; and the next day,

[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st July, 1683.Lord Russell was beheaded in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the
executioner giving him three butcherly strokes.The speech he made, and
the paper which he gave the Sheriff declaring his innocence, the
nobleness of the family, the piety and worthiness of the unhappy
gentleman, wrought much pity, and occasioned various discourses on the
plot.I again saw Prince George of Denmark: he had the Danish
countenance, blonde, of few words, spoke French but ill, seemed somewhat
heavy, but reported to be valiant, and indeed he had bravely rescued and
brought off his brother, the King of Denmark, in a battle against the
Swedes, when both these Kings were engaged very smartly.He was married to the Lady Anne at Whitehall.Her Court
and household to be modeled as the Duke's, her father, had been, and
they to continue in England.Flamsted, the famous astronomer,

cousin-german of the late Lord Russell, came to visit me, and condole
his sad fate.The next day, came Colonel Russell, uncle to the late Lord
Russell, and brother to the Earl of Bedford, and with him Mrs.Middleton, that famous and indeed incomparable beauty, daughter to my
relation, Sir Robert Needham.I went to Bromley to visit our Bishop, and excellent
neighbor, and to congratulate his now being made Archbishop of York.On
the 28th, he came to take his leave of us, now preparing for his journey
and residence in his province.My sweet little grandchild, Martha Maria, died, and
on the 29th was buried in the parish church.This morning, was read in the church, after the
office was done, the Declaration setting forth the late conspiracy
against the King's person.I went to see what had been done by the Duke of
Beaufort on his lately purchased house at Chelsea, which I once had the
selling of for the Countess of Bristol, he had made great alterations,
but might have built a better house with the materials and the cost he
had been at.Saw the Countess of Monte Feltre, whose husband I had formerly known,
he was a subject of the Pope's, but becoming a Protestant he resided in
England, and married into the family of the Savilles, of Yorkshire.The
Count, her late husband, was a very learned gentleman, a great
politician, and a goodly man.She was accompanied by her sister,
exceedingly skilled in painting, nor did they spare for color on their
own faces.It being the day of public thanksgiving for his
Majesty's late preservation, the former Declaration was again read, and
there was an office used, composed for the occasion.A loyal sermon was
preached on the divine right of Kings, from Psalm cxliv."Thou hast
preserved David from the peril of the sword."Came to visit me the learned anatomist, Dr.Tyson,[52] with some other Fellows of our Society.[Footnote 52: Doctor Edward Tyson, a learned physician, born at
    Clevedon, Somersetshire, in 1649, who became reader of the
    anatomical lecture in Surgeons' Hall, and physician to the hospitals
    of Bethlehem and Bridewell, which offices he held at his death, Aug.He was an ingenious writer, and has left various Essays in

    also "The Anatomy of a Porpoise Dissected at Gresham College," and
    "The Anatomy of a Pigmy Compared with a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man,"
    4to., 1698-99.]At the elegant villa and garden of Mr.He showed me the zinnar tree, or platanus, and told me that since
they had planted this kind of tree about the city of Ispahan, in Persia,
the plague, which formerly much infested the place, had exceedingly
abated of its mortal effects, and rendered it very healthy.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th September, 1683.I went to London to visit the Duchess of Grafton,
now great with child, a most virtuous and beautiful lady.Dining with
her at my Lord Chamberlain's, met my Lord of St.Alban's, now grown so
blind, that he could not see to take his meat.He has lived a most easy
life, in plenty even abroad, while his Majesty was a sufferer; he has
lost immense sums at play, which yet, at about eighty years old, he
continues, having one that sits by him to name the spots on the cards.He is a prudent old
courtier, and much enriched since his Majesty's return.After dinner, I walked to survey the sad demolition of Clarendon House,
that costly and only sumptuous palace of the late Lord Chancellor Hyde,
where I have often been so cheerful with him, and sometimes so sad:
happening to make him a visit but the day before he fled from the angry
Parliament, accusing him of maladministration, and being envious at his
grandeur, who from a private lawyer came to be father-in-law to the Duke
of York, and as some would suggest, designing his Majesty's marriage
with the Infanta of Portugal, not apt to breed.To this they imputed
much of our unhappiness; and that he, being sole minister and favorite
at his Majesty's restoration, neglected to gratify the King's suffering
party, preferring those who were the cause of our troubles.But perhaps
as many of these things were injuriously laid to his charge, so he kept
the government far steadier than it has proved since.I could name some
who I think contributed greatly to his ruin,--the buffoons and the
MISSIS, to whom he was an eye-sore.It is true he was of a jolly temper,
after the old English fashion; but France had now the ascendant, and we
were become quite another nation.The Chancellor gone, and dying in
exile, the Earl his successor sold that which cost L50,000 building, to
the young Duke of Albemarle for L25,000, to pay debts which how
contracted remains yet a mystery, his son being no way a prodigal.Some
imagine the Duchess his daughter had been chargeable to him.However it
were, this stately palace is decreed to ruin, to support the prodigious
waste the Duke of Albemarle had made of his estate, since the old man
died.He sold it to the highest bidder, and it fell to certain rich
bankers and mechanics, who gave for it and the ground about it, L35,000;
they design a new town, as it were, and a most magnificent piazza
[square].It is said they have already materials toward it with what
they sold of the house alone, more worth than what they paid for it.See
the vicissitudes of earthly things!I was astonished at this demolition,
nor less at the little army of laborers and artificers leveling the
ground, laying foundations, and contriving great buildings at an expense
of L200,000, if they perfect their design.In my walks I stepped into a goldbeater's
workhouse, where he showed me the wonderful ductility of that spreading
and oily metal.He said it must be finer than the standard, such as was
old angel-gold, and that of such he had once to the value of L100
stamped with the _agnus dei_, and coined at the time of the holy war;
which had been found in a ruined wall somewhere in the North, near to
Scotland, some of which he beat into leaves, and the rest sold to the
curiosi in antiquities and medals.We had now the welcome tidings of the King of
Poland raising the siege of Vienna, which had given terror to all
Europe, and utmost reproach to the French, who it is believed brought in
the Turks for diversion, that the French King might the more easily
swallow Flanders, and pursue his unjust conquest on the empire, while we
sat unconcerned and under a deadly charm from somebody.There was this day a collection for rebuilding Newmarket, consumed by an
accidental fire, which removing his Majesty thence sooner than was
intended, put by the assassins, who were disappointed of their
rendezvous and expectation by a wonderful providence.This made the King
more earnest to render Winchester the seat of his autumnal field
diversions for the future, designing a palace there, where the ancient
castle stood; infinitely indeed preferable to Newmarket for prospects,
air, pleasure, and provisions.The surveyor has already begun the
foundation for a palace, estimated to cost L35,000, and his Majesty is
purchasing ground about it to make a park, etc.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th October, 1683.I went to London, on receiving a note from the
Countess of Arlington, of some considerable charge or advantage I might
obtain by applying myself to his Majesty on this signal conjuncture of
his Majesty entering up judgment against the city charter; the proposal
made me I wholly declined, not being well satisfied with these violent
transactions, and not a little sorry that his Majesty was so often put
upon things of this nature against so great a city, the consequence
whereof may be so much to his prejudice; so I returned home.At this
time, the Lord Chief-Justice Pemberton was displaced.He was held to be
the most learned of the judges, and an honest man.Sir George Jeffreys
was advanced, reputed to be most ignorant, but most daring.Sir George
Treby, Recorder of London, was also put by, and one Genner, an obscure
lawyer, set in his place.Eight of the richest and chief aldermen were
removed and all the rest made only justices of the peace, and no more
wearing of gowns, or chains of gold; the Lord Mayor and two sheriffs
holding their places by new grants as _custodes_, at the King's
pleasure.The pomp and grandeur of the most august city in the world
thus changed face in a moment; which gave great occasion of discourse
and thoughts of hearts, what all this would end in.Prudent men were for
the old foundations.Following his Majesty this morning through the gallery, I went with the
few who attended him, into the Duchess of Portmouth's DRESSING ROOM
within her bedchamber, where she was in her morning loose garment, her
maids combing her, newly out of her bed, his Majesty and the gallants
standing about her; but that which engaged my curiosity, was the rich
and splendid furniture of this woman's apartment, now twice or thrice
pulled down and rebuilt to satisfy her prodigal and expensive pleasures,
while her Majesty's does not exceed some gentlemen's ladies in furniture
and accommodation.Here I saw the new fabric of French tapestry, for
design, tenderness of work, and incomparable imitation of the best
paintings, beyond anything I had ever beheld.Some pieces had
Versailles, St.Germains, and other palaces of the French King, with
huntings, figures, and landscapes, exotic fowls, and all to the life
rarely done.Then for Japan cabinets, screens, pendule clocks, great
vases of wrought plate, tables, stands, chimney-furniture, sconces,
branches, braseras, etc., all of massy silver and out of number, besides
some of her Majesty's best paintings.Surfeiting of this, I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's and went contented home
to my poor, but quiet villa.What contentment can there be in the riches
and splendor of this world, purchased with vice and dishonor?Visited the Duchess of Grafton, not yet brought to
bed, and dining with my Lord Chamberlain (her father), went with them to
see Montague House, a palace lately built by Lord Montague, who had
married the most beautiful Countess of Northumberland.It is a stately
and ample palace.Signor Verrio's fresco paintings, especially the
funeral pile of Dido, on the staircase, the labors of Hercules, fight
with the Centaurs, his effeminacy with Dejanira, and Apotheosis or
reception among the gods, on the walls and roof of the great room
above,--I think exceeds anything he has yet done, both for design,
coloring, and exuberance of invention, comparable to the greatest of the
old masters, or what they so celebrate at Rome.In the rest of the
chamber are some excellent paintings of Holbein, and other masters.The
garden is large, and in good air, but the fronts of the house not
answerable to the inside.The court at entry, and wings for offices seem
too near the street, and that so very narrow and meanly built, that the
corridor is not in proportion to the rest, to hide the court from being
overlooked by neighbors; all which might have been prevented, had they
placed the house further into the ground, of which there was enough to
spare.But on the whole it is a fine palace, built after the French
pavilion-way, by Mr.Hooke, the Curator of the Royal Society.There were
with us my Lady Scroope, the great wit, and Monsieur Chardine, the
celebrated traveler.Came to visit me my old and worthy friend, Mr.Packer, bringing with him his nephew Berkeley, grandson to the honest
judge.A most ingenious, virtuous, and religious gentleman, seated near
Worcester, and very curious in gardening.I was at the court-leet of this manor, my Lord
Arlington his Majesty's High Steward.Came to visit and dine with me, Mr.Brisbane,
Secretary to the Admiralty, a learned and agreeable man.I went to Kew to visit Sir Henry Capell, brother to
the late Earl of Essex; but he being gone to Cashiobury, after I had
seen his garden and the alterations therein, I returned home.He had
repaired his house, roofed his hall with a kind of cupola, and in a
niche was an artificial fountain; but the room seems to me
over-melancholy, yet might be much improved by having the walls well
painted _a fresco_.The two green houses for oranges and myrtles,
communicating with the rooms below, are very well contrived.There is a
cupola made with pole-work between two elms at the end of a walk, which
being covered by plashing the trees to them, is very pretty; for the
rest there are too many fir trees in the garden.[Sidenote: LONDON]

17th November, 1683.I took a house in Villiers Street, York Buildings,
for the winter, having many important concerns to dispatch, and for the
education of my daughters.The Duke of Monmouth, till now proclaimed traitor on
the pretended plot for which Lord Russell was lately beheaded, came this
evening to Whitehall and rendered himself, on which were various
discourses.I went to compliment the Duchess of Grafton, now
lying-in of her first child, a son, which she called for, that I might
see it.She was become more beautiful, if it were possible, than before,
and full of virtue and sweetness.She discoursed with me of many
particulars, with great prudence and gravity beyond her years.Forbes showed me the plot of the garden making
at Burleigh, at my Lord Exeter's, which I looked on as one of the most
noble that I had seen.The whole court and town in solemn mourning for the death of the King of
Portugal, her Majesty's brother.At the anniversary dinner of the Royal Society the
King sent us two does.I was this day invited to a wedding of one Mrs.Castle, to whom I had some obligation, and it was to her fifth husband,
a lieutenant-colonel of the city.She was the daughter of one Burton, a
broom-man, by his wife, who sold kitchen stuff in Kent Street, whom God
so blessed that the father became a very rich, and was a very honest
man; he was sheriff of Surrey, where I have sat on the bench with him.Another of his daughters was married to Sir John Bowles; and this
daughter was a jolly friendly woman.There was at the wedding the Lord
Mayor, the Sheriff, several Aldermen and persons of quality; above all,
Sir George Jeffreys, newly made Lord Chief Justice of England, with Mr.Justice Withings, danced with the bride, and were exceedingly merry.These great men spent the rest of the afternoon, till eleven at night,
in drinking healths, taking tobacco, and talking much beneath the
gravity of judges, who had but a day or two before condemned Mr.Algernon Sidney, who was executed the 7th on Tower Hill, on the single
witness of that monster of a man, Lord Howard of Escrick, and some
sheets of paper taken in Mr.Sidney's study, pretended to be written by
him, but not fully proved, nor the time when, but appearing to have been
written before his Majesty's Restoration, and then pardoned by the Act
of Oblivion; so that though Mr.Sidney was known to be a person
obstinately averse to government by a monarch (the subject of the paper
was in answer to one by Sir E. Filmer), yet it was thought he had very
hard measure.There is this yet observable, that he had been an
inveterate enemy to the last king, and in actual rebellion against him;
a man of great courage, great sense, great parts, which he showed both
at his trial and death; for, when he came on the scaffold, instead of a
speech, he told them only that he had made his peace with God, that he
came not thither to talk, but to die; put a paper into the sheriff's
hand, and another into a friend's; said one prayer as short as a grace,
laid down his neck, and bid the executioner do his office.The Duke of Monmouth, now having his pardon, refuses to acknowledge
there was any treasonable plot; for which he is banished Whitehall.This
is a great disappointment to some who had prosecuted Trenchard, Hampden,
etc., that for want of a second witness were come out of the Tower upon
their _habeas corpus_.The King had now augmented his guards with a new sort of dragoons, who
carried also grenades, and were habited after the Polish manner, with
long peaked caps, very fierce and fantastical.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th December, 1683.I went to the Tower, and visited the Earl of Danby,
the late Lord High Treasurer, who had been imprisoned four years: he
received me with great kindness.I dined with him, and stayed till
night.We had discourse of many things, his Lady railing sufficiently at
the keeping her husband so long in prison.Here I saluted the Lord
Dumblaine's wife, who before had been married to Emerton, and about whom
there was that scandalous business before the delegates.The smallpox very prevalent and mortal; the Thames
frozen.I dined at Lord Clarendon's, where I was to meet
that ingenious and learned gentleman, Sir George Wheeler, who has
published the excellent description of Africa and Greece, and who, being
a knight of a very fair estate and young, had now newly entered into
holy orders.I went to visit Sir John Chardin, a French
gentleman, who traveled three times by land into Persia, and had made
many curious researches in his travels, of which he was now setting
forth a relation.It being in England this year one of the severest
frosts that has happened of many years, he told me the cold in Persia
was much greater, the ice of an incredible thickness; that they had
little use of iron in all that country, it being so moist (though the
air admirably clear and healthy) that oil would not preserve it from
rusting, so that they had neither clocks nor watches; some padlocks they
had for doors and boxes.Sprat, now made Dean of Westminster, preached
to the King at Whitehall, on Matt.Recollecting the passages of
the past year, I gave God thanks for his mercies, praying his blessing
for the future.The weather continuing intolerably severe, streets
of booths were set up on the Thames; the air was so very cold and thick,
as of many years there had not been the like.I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's: after dinner came a
fellow who ate live charcoal, glowingly ignited, quenching them in his
mouth, and then champing and swallowing them down.There was a dog also
which seemed to do many rational actions.I went across the Thames on the ice, now become so
thick as to bear not only streets of booths, in which they roasted meat,
and had divers shops of wares, quite across as in a town, but coaches,
carts, and horses passed over.So I went from Westminster stairs to
Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop: where I met my Lord Bruce, Sir
George Wheeler, Colonel Cooke, and several divines.After dinner and
discourse with his Grace till evening prayers, Sir George Wheeler and I
walked over the ice from Lambeth stairs to the Horse-ferry.I visited Sir Robert Reading, where after supper we
had music, but not comparable to that which Mrs.Bridgeman made us on
the guitar with such extraordinary skill and dexterity.The Thames was filled with people and tents selling
all sorts of wares as in the city.The frost continues more and more severe, the Thames
before London was still planted with booths in formal streets, all sorts
of trades and shops furnished, and full of commodities, even to a
printing press, where the people and ladies took a fancy to have their
names printed, and the day and year set down when printed on the Thames:
this humor took so universally, that it was estimated that the printer
gained L5 a day, for printing a line only, at sixpence a name, besides
what he got by ballads, etc.Coaches plied from Westminster to the
Temple, and from several other stairs to and fro, as in the streets,
sleds, sliding with skates, a bull-baiting, horse and coach-races,
puppet-plays and interludes, cooks, tippling, and other lewd places, so
that it seemed to be a bacchanalian triumph, or carnival on the water,
while it was a severe judgment on the land, the trees not only splitting
as if the lightning struck, but men and cattle perishing in divers
places, and the very seas so locked up with ice, that no vessels could
stir out or come in.The fowls, fish, and birds, and all our exotic
plants and greens, universally perishing.Many parks of deer were
destroyed, and all sorts of fuel so dear, that there were great
contributions to preserve the poor alive.Nor was this severe weather
much less intense in most parts of Europe, even as far as Spain and the
most southern tracts.London, by reason of the excessive coldness of the
air hindering the ascent of the smoke, was so filled with the fuliginous
steam of the sea-coal, that hardly could one see across the street, and
this filling the lungs with its gross particles, exceedingly obstructed
the breast, so as one could scarcely breathe.Here was no water to be
had from the pipes and engines, nor could the brewers and divers other
tradesmen work, and every moment was full of disastrous accidents.I went to Sayes Court to see how the frost had
dealt with my garden, where I found many of the greens and rare plants
utterly destroyed.The oranges and myrtles very sick, the rosemary and
laurels dead to all appearance, but the cypress likely to endure it.It began to thaw, but froze again.My coach crossed
from Lambeth, to the Horse-ferry at Milbank, Westminster.The booths
were almost all taken down; but there was first a map or landscape cut
in copper representing all the manner of the camp, and the several
actions, sports, and pastimes thereon, in memory of so signal a frost.I dined with my Lord Keeper, [North], and walking
alone with him some time in his gallery, we had discourse of music.He
told me he had been brought up to it from a child, so as to sing his
part at first sight.Then speaking of painting, of which he was also a
great lover, and other ingenious matters, he desired me to come oftener
to him.I went this evening to visit that great and knowing
virtuoso, Monsieur Justell.The weather was set in to an absolute thaw
and rain; but the Thames still frozen.After eight weeks missing the foreign posts, there
came abundance of intelligence from abroad.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th February, 1684.The Earl of Danby, late Lord-Treasurer, together
with the Roman Catholic Lords impeached of high treason in the Popish
Plot, had now their _habeas corpus_, and came out upon bail, after five
years' imprisonment in the Tower.Then were also tried and deeply fined
Mr.Hampden and others, for being supposed of the late plot, for which
Lord Russell and Colonel Sidney suffered; as also the person who went
about to prove that the Earl of Essex had his throat cut in the Tower by
others; likewise Mr.Johnson, the author of that famous piece called
Julian.News of the Prince of Orange having accused the
Deputies of Amsterdam of _crimen laesae Majestatis_, and being pensioners
to France.Tenison communicated to me his intention of erecting a library in
St.Martin's parish, for the public use, and desired my assistance, with
Sir Christopher Wren, about the placing and structure thereof, a worthy
and laudable design.He told me there were thirty or forty young men in
Orders in his parish, either governors to young gentlemen or chaplains
to noblemen, who being reproved by him on occasion for frequenting
taverns or coffeehouses, told him they would study or employ their time
better, if they had books.This put the pious Doctor on this design; and
indeed a great reproach it is that so great a city as London should not
have a public library becoming it.Paul's;
the west end of that church (if ever finished) would be a convenient
place.I went to Sir John Chardin, who desired my
assistance for the engraving the plates, the translation, and printing
his History of that wonderful Persian Monument near Persepolis, and
other rare antiquities, which he had caused to be drawn from the
originals in his second journey into Persia, which we now concluded
upon.Afterward, I went with Sir Christopher Wren to Dr.Tenison, where
we made the drawing and estimate of the expense of the library, to be
begun this next spring near the Mews.Great expectation of the Prince of Orange's attempts in Holland to bring
those of Amsterdam to consent to the new levies, to which we were no
friends, by a pseudo-politic adherence to the French interest.Turner, our new Bishop of
Rochester.I dined at Lady Tuke's, where I heard Dr.Walgrave
(physician to the Duke and Duchess) play excellently on the lute.Meggot, Dean of Winchester, preached an
incomparable sermon (the King being now gone to Newmarket), on Heb.15, showing and pathetically pressing the care we ought to have lest we
come short of the grace of God.Tenison
at Kensington, whither he was retired to refresh, after he had been sick
of the smallpox.Henry Godolphin, a prebend
of St.Paul's, and brother to my dear friend Sydney, on Isaiah 1v.I
dined at the Lord Keeper's, and brought him to Sir John Chardin, who
showed him his accurate drafts of his travels in Persia.There was so great a concourse of people with their
children to be touched for the Evil, that six or seven were crushed to
death by pressing at the chirurgeon's door for tickets.The weather
began to be more mild and tolerable; but there was not the least
appearance of any spring.The Bishop of Rochester preached before
the King; after which his Majesty, accompanied with three of his natural
sons, the Dukes of Northumberland, Richmond, and St.Alban (sons of
Portsmouth, Cleveland, and Nelly), went up to the altar; the three boys
entering before the King within the rails, at the right hand, and three
bishops on the left: London (who officiated), Durham, and Rochester,
with the subdean, Dr.The King, kneeling before the altar,
making his offering, the Bishops first received, and then his Majesty;
after which he retired to a canopied seat on the right hand.Note, there
was perfume burned before the office began.I had received the Sacrament
at Whitehall early with the Lords and household, the Bishop of London
officiating.Tenison preached
(recovered from the smallpox); then went again to Whitehall as above.I returned home with my family to my house at Sayes
Court, after five months' residence in London; hardly the least
appearance of any spring.A letter of mine to the Royal Society concerning the
terrible effects of the past winter being read, they desired it might be
printed in the next part of their "Transactions."[Sidenote: SURREY]

10th May, 1684.Called by the way
at Ashted, where Sir Robert Howard (Auditor of the Exchequer)
entertained me very civilly at his newly-built house, which stands in a
park on the Down, the avenue south; though down hill to the house, which
is not great, but with the outhouses very convenient.The staircase is
painted by Verrio with the story of Astrea; among other figures is the
picture of the painter himself, and not unlike him; the rest is well
done, only the columns did not at all please me; there is also Sir
Robert's own picture in an oval; the whole in _fresco_.The place has
this great defect, that there is no water but what is drawn up by horses
from a very deep well.Higham, who was ill, and died three days
after.His grandfather and father (who christened me), with himself, had
now been rectors of this parish 101 years, viz, from May, 1583.I returned to London, where I found the Commissioners of
the Admiralty abolished, and the office of Admiral restored to the Duke,
as to the disposing and ordering all sea business; but his Majesty
signed all petitions, papers, warrants, and commissions, that the Duke,
not acting as admiral by commission or office, might not incur the
penalty of the late Act against <DW7>s and Dissenters holding offices,
and refusing the oath and test.Every one was glad of this change, those
in the late Commission being utterly ignorant in their duty, to the
great damage of the Navy.The utter ruin of the Low Country was threatened by the siege of
Luxemburg, if not timely relieved, and by the obstinacy of the
Hollanders, who refused to assist the Prince of Orange, being corrupted
by the French.I received L600 of Sir Charles Bickerstaff for the fee
farm of Pilton, in Devon.Lord Dartmouth was chosen Master of the Trinity Company,
newly returned with the fleet from blowing up and demolishing Tangier.In the sermon preached on this occasion, Dr.Can observed that, in the
27th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, the casting anchor out of the
fore ship had been caviled at as betraying total ignorance: that it is
very true our seamen do not do so; but in the Mediterranean their ships
were built differently from ours, and to this day it was the practice to
do so there.Luxemburg was surrendered to the French, which makes them master of all
the Netherlands, gives them entrance into Germany, and a fair game for
universal monarchy; which that we should suffer, who only and easily
might have hindered, astonished all the world.Thus is the poor Prince
of Orange ruined, and this nation and all the Protestant interest in
Europe following, unless God in his infinite mercy, as by a miracle,
interpose, and our great ones alter their counsels.The French fleet
were now besieging Genoa, but after burning much of that beautiful city
with their bombs, went off with disgrace.My cousin, Verney, to whom a very great fortune was
fallen, came to take leave of us, going into the country; a very worthy
and virtuous young gentleman.I went to advise and give directions about the building
of two streets in Berkeley Garden, reserving the house and as much of
the garden as the breadth of the house.In the meantime, I could not but
deplore that sweet place (by far the most noble gardens, courts, and
accommodations, stately porticos, etc., anywhere about the town) should
be so much straitened and turned into tenements.But that magnificent
pile and gardens contiguous to it, built by the late Lord Chancellor
Clarendon, being all demolished, and designed for piazzas and buildings,
was some excuse for my Lady Berkeley's resolution of letting out her
ground also for so excessive a price as was offered, advancing near
L1,000 per annum in mere ground rents; to such a mad intemperance was
the age come of building about a city, by far too disproportionate
already to the nation:[53] I having in my time seen it almost as large
again as it was within my memory.[Footnote 53: What would Evelyn think if he could see what is now
    called London?]Last Friday, Sir Thomas Armstrong was executed at Tyburn
for treason, without trial, having been outlawed and apprehended in
Holland, on the conspiracy of the Duke of Monmouth, Lord Russell, etc.,
which gave occasion of discourse to people and lawyers, in regard it was
on an outlawry that judgment was given and execution.[54]

    [Footnote 54: When brought up for judgment, Armstrong insisted on
    his right to a trial, the act giving that right to those who came in
    within a year, and the year not having expired.Jefferies refused
    it; and when Armstrong insisted that he asked nothing but law,
    Jefferies told him he should have it to the full, and ordered his
    execution in six days.When Jefferies went to the King at Windsor
    soon after, the King took a ring from his finger and gave it to
    Jefferies.[Sidenote: GREENWICH]

2d July, 1684.I went to the Observatory at Greenwich, where Mr.Flamsted took his observations of the eclipse of the sun, now almost
three parts obscured.There had been an excessively hot and dry spring, and such a drought
still continued as never was in my memory.Some small sprinkling of rain; the leaves dropping
from the trees as in autumn.I dined at Lord Falkland's, Treasurer of the Navy,
where after dinner we had rare music, there being among others, Signor
Pietro Reggio, and Signor John Baptist, both famous, one for his voice,
the other for playing on the harpsichord, few if any in Europe exceeding
him.There was also a Frenchman who sung an admirable bass.I returned home, where I found my Lord Chief Justice
[Jefferies], the Countess of Clarendon, and Lady Catherine Fitzgerald,
who dined with me.We had now rain after such a drought as no man in
England had known.We had not had above one or two
considerable showers, and those storms, these eight or nine months.Many
trees died for the want of refreshment.Sidney Godolphin was made Baron Godolphin.The King being returned from Winchester, there was
a numerous Court at Whitehall.At this time the Earl of Rochester was removed from the Treasury to the
Presidentship of the Council; Lord Godolphin was made first Commissioner
of the Treasury in his place, Lord Middleton (a Scot) made Secretary of
State, in the room of Lord Godolphin.These alterations being very
unexpected and mysterious, gave great occasion of discourse.There was now an Ambassador from the King of Siam, in the East Indies,
to his Majesty.I went with Sir William Godolphin to see the
rhinoceros, or unicorn, being the first that I suppose was ever brought
into England.She belonged to some East India merchants, and was sold
(as I remember) for above L2,000.At the same time, I went to see a
crocodile, brought from some of the West India Islands, resembling the
Egyptian crocodile.I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's with the Duke of
Northumberland.He seemed to be a young gentleman of good capacity, well
bred, civil and modest: newly come from travel, and had made his
campaign at the siege of Luxemburg.Of all his Majesty's children (of
which he had now six Dukes) this seemed the most accomplished and worth
the owning.What the
Dukes of Richmond and St.Alban's will prove, their youth does not yet
discover; they are very pretty boys.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1684.Goodman preached before the King on James ii.12, concerning the law of liberty: an excellent discourse and in good
method.He is author of "The Prodigal Son," a treatise worth reading,
and another of the old religion.I visited the Lord Chamberlain, where dined the
BLACK BARON and Monsieur Flamerin, who had so long been banished from
France for a duel.I carried Lord Clarendon through the city amid all
the squibs and bacchanalia of the Lord Mayor's show, to the Royal
Society, where he was proposed a member; and then treated him at dinner.Clement's, that prettily built and contrived church where
a young divine gave us an eloquent sermon on 1 Cor.20, inciting to
gratitude and glorifying God for the fabric of our bodies and the
dignity of our nature.A sudden change from temperate warm weather to an
excessive cold rain, frost, snow, and storm, such as had seldom been
known.This winter weather began as early and fierce as the past did
late; till about Christmas there then had been hardly any winter.Turner, now translated from Rochester to Ely
upon the death of Dr.Peter Gunning, preached before the King at
Whitehall on Romans iii.8, a very excellent sermon, vindicating the
Church of England against the pernicious doctrines of the Church of
Rome.He challenged the producing but of five clergymen who forsook our
Church and went over to that of Rome, during all the troubles and
rebellion in England, which lasted near twenty years; and this was to my
certain observation a great truth.Being the Queen's birthday, there were fireworks
on the Thames before Whitehall, with pageants of castles, forts, and
other devices of girandolas, serpents, the King and Queen's arms and
mottoes, all represented in fire, such as had not been seen here.But
the most remarkable was the several fires and skirmishes in the very
water, which actually moved a long way, burning under the water, now and
then appearing above it, giving reports like muskets and cannon, with
grenades and innumerable other devices.It is said it cost L1,500.It
was concluded with a ball, where all the young ladies and gallants
danced in the great hall.The court had not been seen so brave and rich
in apparel since his Majesty's Restoration.Fiennes, son of the Lord Say
and Seale, preached before the King on Joshua xxi.Slingsby (Master of the
Mint), to see Mr.The series of Popes
was rare, and so were several among the moderns, especially that of John
Huss's martyrdom at Constance; of the Roman Emperors, Consulars some
Greek, etc., in copper, gold, and silver; not many truly antique; a
medallion of Otho Paulus Aemilius, etc., ancient.They were held at a
price of L1,000; but not worth, I judge, above L200.I went to see the new church at St.James's,
elegantly built; the altar was especially adorned, the white marble
inclosure curiously and richly carved, the flowers and garlands about
the walls by Mr.Gibbons, in wood: a pelican with her young at her
breast; just over the altar in the carved compartment and border
environing the purple velvet fringed with I. H. S. richly embroidered,
and most noble plate, were given by Sir R. Geere, to the value (as was
said) of L200.There was no altar anywhere in England, nor has there
been any abroad, more handsomely adorned.James's Park
to see three Turkish, or Asian horses, newly brought over, and now first
shown to his Majesty.There were four, but one of them died at sea,
being three weeks coming from Hamburg.They were taken from a Bashaw at
the siege of Vienna, at the late famous raising that leaguer.I never
beheld so delicate a creature as one of them was, of somewhat a bright
bay, two white feet, a blaze; such a head, eyes, ears, neck, breast,
belly, haunches, legs, pasterns, and feet, in all regards, beautiful,
and proportioned to admiration; spirited, proud, nimble, making halt,
turning with that swiftness, and in so small a compass, as was
admirable.With all this so gentle and tractable as called to mind what
I remember Busbequius, speaks of them, to the reproach of our grooms in
Europe, who bring up their horses so churlishly, as makes most of them
retain their ill habits.They trotted like does, as if they did not feel
the ground.Five hundred guineas was demanded for the first; 300 for the
second; and 200 for the third, which was brown.All of them were
choicely shaped, but the two last not altogether so perfect as the
first.It was judged by the spectators, among whom was the King, Prince of
Denmark, Duke of York, and several of the Court, noble persons skilled
in horses, especially Monsieur Faubert and his son (provost masters of
the Academy, and esteemed of the best in Europe), that there were never
seen any horses in these parts to be compared with them.Add to all
this, the furniture consisting of embroidery on the saddle, housings,
quiver, bow, arrows, scymitar, sword, mace, or battle-ax, _a la
Turcisq_; the Bashaw's velvet mantle furred with the most perfect ermine
I ever beheld; all which, ironwork in common furniture being here of
silver, curiously wrought and double gilt to an incredible value.Such
and so extraordinary was the embroidery, that I never saw anything
approaching it.The reins and headstall were of crimson silk, covered
with chains of silver gilt.There was also a Turkish royal standard of a
horse's tail, together with all sorts of other caparisons belonging to a
general's horse, by which one may estimate how gallantly and
magnificently those infidels appear in the field; for nothing could be
seen more glorious.The gentleman (a German) who rode the horse, was in
all this garb.They were shod with iron made round and closed at the
heel, with a hole in the middle about as wide as a shilling.I went with Lord Cornwallis to see the young
gallants do their exercise.Faubert having newly railed in a manage,
and fitted it for the academy.There were the Dukes of Norfolk and
Northumberland, Lord Newburgh, and a nephew of (Duras) Earl of
Feversham.The exercises were, 1, running at the ring; 2, flinging a
javelin at a Moor's head; 3, discharging a pistol at a mark; lastly
taking up a gauntlet with the point of a sword; all these performed in
full speed.The Duke of Northumberland hardly missed of succeeding in
every one, a dozen times, as I think.The Duke of Norfolk did exceeding
bravely.Lords Newburgh and Duras seemed nothing so dexterous.Here I
saw the difference of what the French call "_bel homme a cheval_," and
"_bon homme a cheval_"; the Duke of Norfolk being the first, that is
rather a fine person on a horse, the Duke of Northumberland being both
in perfection, namely, a graceful person and an excellent rider.But the
Duke of Norfolk told me he had not been at this exercise these twelve
years before.There were in the field the Prince of Denmark, and the
Lord Lansdowne, son of the Earl of Bath, who had been made a Count of
the Empire last summer for his service before Vienna.John, a worthy gentleman, on a knight
of quality, in a tavern.So
many horrid murders and duels were committed about this time as were
never before heard of in England; which gave much cause of complaint and
murmurings.It proved so sharp weather, and so long and cruel
a frost, that the Thames was frozen across, but the frost was often
dissolved, and then froze again.5, after
the Presbyterian tedious method and repetition.I dined at Lord Newport's, who had some excellent
pictures, especially that of Sir Thomas Hanmer, by Vandyke, one of the
best he ever painted; another of our English Dobson's painting; but,
above all, Christ in the Virgin's lap, by Poussin, an admirable piece;
with something of most other famous hands.I saw this
evening such a scene of profuse gaming, and the King in the midst of his
three concubines, as I have never before seen--luxurious dallying and
profaneness.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, being invited to hear
that celebrated voice of Mr.Pordage, newly come from Rome; his singing
was after the Venetian recitative, as masterly as could be, and with an
excellent voice both treble and bass; Dr.Walgrave accompanied it with
his THEORBO LUTE, on which he performed beyond imagination, and is
doubtless one of the greatest masters in Europe on that charming
instrument.Pordage is a priest, as Mr.There was in the room where we dined, and in his bedchamber, those
incomparable pieces of Columbus, a Flagellation, the Grammar school, the
Venus and Adonis of Titian; and of Vandyke's that picture of the late
Earl of Digby (father of the Countess of Sunderland), and Earl of
Bedford, Sir Kenelm Digby, and two ladies of incomparable performance;
besides that of Moses and the burning bush of Bassano, and several other
pieces of the best masters.A marble head of M. Brutus, etc.I was invited to my Lord Arundel's, of Wardour (now
newly released of his six years' confinement in the Tower on suspicion
of the plot called Oates's Plot), where after dinner the same Mr.Pordage entertained us with his voice, that excellent and stupendous
artist, Signor John Baptist, playing to it on the harpsichord.My
daughter Mary being with us, she also sang to the great satisfaction of
both the masters, and a world of people of quality present.She did so also at my Lord Rochester's the evening following, where we
had the French boy so famed for his singing, and indeed he had a
delicate voice, and had been well taught.Packer
(daughter to my old friend) sing before his Majesty and the Duke,
privately, that stupendous bass, Gosling, accompanying her, but hers was
so loud as took away much of the sweetness.Certainly never woman had a
stronger or better ear, could she possibly have governed it.She would
do rarely in a large church among the nuns.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th February, 1685.I went to London, hearing his Majesty had been the
Monday before (2d February) surprised in his bedchamber with an
apoplectic fit, so that if, by God's providence, Dr.King (that
excellent chirurgeon as well as physician) had not been accidentally
present to let him bleed (having his lancet in his pocket), his Majesty
had certainly died that moment; which might have been of direful
consequence, there being nobody else present with the King save this
Doctor and one more, as I am assured.It was a mark of the extraordinary
dexterity, resolution, and presence of mind in the Doctor, to let him
bleed in the very paroxysm, without staying the coming of other
physicians, which regularly should have been done, and for want of which
he must have a regular pardon, as they tell me.This rescued his Majesty
for the instant, but it was only a short reprieve.He still complained,
and was relapsing, often fainting, with sometimes epileptic symptoms,
till Wednesday, for which he was cupped, let bleed in both jugulars, and
both vomit and purges, which so relieved him, that on Thursday hopes of
recovery were signified in the public "Gazette," but that day about
noon, the physicians thought him feverish.This they seemed glad of, as
being more easily allayed and methodically dealt with than his former
fits; so as they prescribed the famous Jesuit's powder; but it made him
worse, and some very able doctors who were present did not think it a
fever, but the effect of his frequent bleeding and other sharp
operations used by them about his head, so that probably the powder
might stop the circulation, and renew his former fits, which now made
him very weak.Thus he passed Thursday night with great difficulty, when
complaining of a pain in his side, they drew twelve ounces more of blood
from him; this was by six in the morning on Friday, and it gave him
relief, but it did not continue, for being now in much pain, and
struggling for breath, he lay dozing, and, after some conflicts, the
physicians despairing of him, he gave up the ghost at half an hour after
eleven in the morning, being the sixth of February, 1685, in the 36th
year of his reign, and 54th of his age.Prayers were solemnly made in all the churches, especially in both the
Court Chapels, where the chaplains relieved one another every half
quarter of an hour from the time he began to be in danger till he
expired, according to the form prescribed in the Church offices.Those
who assisted his Majesty's devotions were, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Bishops of London, Durham, and Ely, but more especially Dr.Ken, the
Bishop of Bath and Wells.[55] It is said they exceedingly urged the
receiving Holy Sacrament, but his Majesty told them he would consider of
it, which he did so long till it was too late.Others whispered that the
Bishops and Lords, except the Earls of Bath and Feversham, being ordered
to withdraw the night before, Huddleston, the priest, had presumed to
administer the Popish offices.He gave his breeches and keys to the Duke
who was almost continually kneeling by his bedside, and in tears.He
also recommended to him the care of his natural children, all except the
Duke of Monmouth, now in Holland, and in his displeasure.He entreated
the Queen to pardon him (not without cause); who a little before had
sent a Bishop to excuse her not more frequently visiting him, in regard
of her excessive grief, and withal that his Majesty would forgive it if
at any time she had offended him.He spoke to the Duke to be kind to the
Duchess of Cleveland, and especially Portsmouth, and that Nelly might
not starve.[Footnote 55: The account given of this by Charles's brother and
    successor, is, that when the King's life was wholly despaired of,
    and it was time to prepare for another world, two Bishops came to do
    their function, who reading the prayers appointed in the Common
    Prayer Book on that occasion, when they came to the place where
    usually they exhort a sick person to make a confession of his sins,
    the Bishop of Bath and Wells, who was one of them, advertised him,
    IT WAS NOT OF OBLIGATION; and after a short exhortation, asked him
    if he was sorry for his sins?which the King saying he was, the
    Bishop pronounced the absolution, and then, asked him if he pleased
    to receive the Sacrament?to which the King made no reply; and being
    pressed by the Bishop several times, gave no other answer but that
    it was time enough, or that he would think of it.King James adds, that he stood all the while by the bedside, and
    seeing the King would not receive the Sacrament from them, and
    knowing his sentiments, he desired the company to stand a little
    from the bed, and then asked the King whether he should send for a
    priest, to which the King replied: "For God's sake, brother, do, and
    lose no time."The Duke said he would bring one to him; but none
    could be found except Father Huddleston, who had been so assistant
    in the King's escape from Worcester; he was brought up a back
    staircase, and the company were desired to withdraw, but he (the
    Duke of York) not thinking fit that he should be left alone with the
    King, desired the Earl of Bath, a Lord of the Bedchamber, and the
    Earl of Feversham, Captain of the Guard, should stay; the rest being
    gone, Father Huddleston was introduced, and administered the
    Sacrament.--"Life of James II."]Thus died King Charles II., of a vigorous and robust constitution, and
in all appearance promising a long life.He was a prince of many
virtues, and many great imperfections; debonair, easy of access, not
bloody nor cruel; his countenance fierce, his voice great, proper of
person, every motion became him; a lover of the sea, and skillful in
shipping; not affecting other studies, yet he had a laboratory, and knew
of many empirical medicines, and the easier mechanical mathematics; he
loved planting and building, and brought in a politer way of living,
which passed to luxury and intolerable expense.He had a particular
talent in telling a story, and facetious passages, of which he had
innumerable; this made some buffoons and vicious wretches too
presumptuous and familiar, not worthy the favor they abused.He took
delight in having a number of little spaniels follow him and lie in his
bedchamber, where he often suffered the bitches to puppy and give suck,
which rendered it very offensive, and indeed made the whole court nasty
and stinking.He would doubtless have been an excellent prince, had he
been less addicted to women, who made him uneasy, and always in want to
supply their immeasurable profusion, to the detriment of many indigent
persons who had signally served both him and his father.He frequently
and easily changed favorites to his great prejudice.As to other public transactions, and unhappy miscarriages, 'tis not
here I intend to number them; but certainly never had King more glorious
opportunities to have made himself, his people, and all Europe happy,
and prevented innumerable mischiefs, had not his too easy nature
resigned him to be managed by crafty men, and some abandoned and profane
wretches who corrupted his otherwise sufficient parts, disciplined as he
had been by many afflictions during his banishment, which gave him much
experience and knowledge of men and things; but those wicked creatures
took him from off all application becoming so great a King.The history
of his reign will certainly be the most wonderful for the variety of
matter and accidents, above any extant in former ages: the sad tragical
death of his father, his banishment and hardships, his miraculous
restoration, conspiracies against him, parliaments, wars, plagues,
fires, comets, revolutions abroad happening in his time, with a thousand
other particulars.He was ever kind to me, and very gracious upon all
occasions, and therefore I cannot without ingratitude but deplore his
loss, which for many respects, as well as duty, I do with all my soul.His Majesty being dead, the Duke, now King James II., went immediately
to Council, and before entering into any business, passionately
declaring his sorrow, told their Lordships, that since the succession
had fallen to him, he would endeavor to follow the example of his
predecessor in his clemency and tenderness to his people; that, however
he had been misrepresented as affecting arbitrary power, they should
find the contrary; for that the laws of England had made the King as
great a monarch as he could desire; that he would endeavor to maintain
the Government both in Church and State, as by law established, its
principles being so firm for monarchy, and the members of it showing
themselves so good and loyal subjects;[56] and that, as he would never
depart from the just rights and prerogatives of the Crown, so he would
never invade any man's property; but as he had often adventured his life
in defense of the nation, so he would still proceed, and preserve it in
all its lawful rights and liberties.[Footnote 56: This is the substance (and very nearly the words
    employed) of what is stated by King James II.printed in
    his life; but in that MS.For example, after speaking of the members of the Church of England
    as good and loyal subjects, the King adds, "AND THEREFORE I SHALL
    ALWAYS TAKE CARE TO DEFEND AND SUPPORT IT."James then goes on to
    say, that being desired by some present to allow copies to be taken,
    he said he had not committed it to writing; on which Mr.Finch (then
    Solicitor-General and afterward Earl of Aylesford) replied, that
    what his Majesty had said had made so deep an impression on him,
    that he believed he could repeat the very words, and if his Majesty
    would permit him, he would write them down, which the King agreeing
    to, he went to a table and wrote them down, and this being shown to
    the King, he approved of it, and it was immediately published.The
    King afterward proceeds to say: "No one can wonder that Mr.Finch
    should word the speech as strong as he could in favor of the
    Established Religion, nor that the King in such a hurry should pass
    it over without reflection; for though his Majesty intended to
    promise both security to their religion and protection to their
    persons, he was afterward convinced it had been better expressed by
    assuring them he never would endeavor to alter the Established
    Religion, than that he would endeavor to preserve it, and that he
    would rather support and defend the professors of it, than the
    religion itself; they could not expect he should make a conscience
    of supporting what in his conscience he thought erroneous: his
    engaging not to molest the professors of it, nor to deprive them or
    their successors of any spiritual dignity, revenue, or employment,
    but to suffer the ecclesiastical affairs to go on in the track they
    were in, was all they could wish or desire from a Prince of a
    different persuasion; but having once approved that way of
    expressing it which Mr.Finch had made choice of, he thought it
    necessary not to vary from it in the declarations or speeches he
    made afterward, not doubting but the world would understand it in
    the meaning he intended.----'Tis true, afterward IT WAS pretended
    he kept not up to this engagement; but had they deviated no further
    from the duty and allegience which both nature and repeated oath
    obliged them to, THAN HE DID FROM HIS WORD, they had still remained
    as happy a people as they really were during his short reign in
    England."The words printed in small
    caps in this extract are from the interlineations of the son of King
    James II.]This being the substance of what he said, the Lords desired it might be
published, as containing matter of great satisfaction to a jealous
people upon this change, which his Majesty consented to.Then were the
Council sworn, and a Proclamation ordered to be published that all
officers should continue in their stations, that there might be no
failure of public justice, till his further pleasure should be known.Then the King rose, the Lords accompanying him to his bedchamber, where,
while he reposed himself, tired indeed as he was with grief and
watching, they returned again into the Council chamber to take order for
the PROCLAIMING his Majesty, which (after some debate) they consented
should be in the very form his grandfather, King James I., was, after
the death of Queen Elizabeth; as likewise that the Lords, etc., should
proceed in their coaches through the city for the more solemnity of it.Upon this was I, and several other gentlemen waiting in the Privy
gallery, admitted into the Council chamber to be witness of what was
resolved on.Thence with the Lords, Lord Marshal and Heralds, and other
Crown officers being ready, we first went to Whitehall gate, where the
Lords stood on foot bareheaded, while the Herald proclaimed his
Majesty's title to the Imperial Crown and succession according to the
form, the trumpets and kettledrums having first sounded three times,
which ended with the people's acclamations.Then a herald called the
Lords' coaches according to rank, myself accompanying the solemnity in
my Lord Cornwallis's coach, first to Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor
and his brethren met us on horseback, in all their formalities, and
proclaimed the King; hence to the Exchange in Cornhill, and so we
returned in the order we set forth.Being come to Whitehall, we all went
and kissed the King and Queen's hands.He had been on the bed, but was
now risen and in his undress.The Queen was in bed in her apartment, but
put forth her hand, seeming to be much afflicted, as I believe she was,
having deported herself so decently upon all occasions since she came
into England, which made her universally beloved.I can never forget the inexpressible luxury and profaneness, gaming, and
all dissoluteness, and as it were total forgetfulness of God (it being
Sunday evening), which this day se'nnight I was witness of, the King
sitting and toying with his concubines, Portsmouth, Cleveland, and
Mazarin, etc., a French boy singing love songs[57] in that glorious
gallery, while about twenty of the great courtiers and other dissolute
persons were at Basset round a large table, a bank of at least 2,000 in
gold before them; upon which two gentlemen, who were with me, made
reflections with astonishment.Six days after, was all in the dust.[Footnote 57: _Ante_, p.It was enjoined that those who put on mourning should wear it as for a
father, in the most solemn manner.Being sent to by the Sheriff of the County to
appear and assist in proclaiming the King, I went the next day to
Bromley, where I met the Sheriff and the Commander of the Kentish Troop,
with an appearance, I suppose, of about 500 horse, and innumerable
people, two of his Majesty's trumpets, and a Sergeant with other
officers, who having drawn up the horse in a large field near the town,
marched thence, with swords drawn, to the market place, where, making a
ring, after sound of trumpets and silence made, the High Sheriff read
the proclaiming titles to his bailiff, who repeated them aloud, and
then, after many shouts of the people, his Majesty's health being drunk
in a flint glass of a yard long, by the Sheriff, Commander, Officers,
and chief gentlemen, they all dispersed, and I returned.I passed a fine on selling of Honson Grange in
Staffordshire, being about L20 per annum, which lying so great a
distance, I thought fit to part with it to one Burton, a farmer there.It came to me as part of my daughter-in-law's portion, this being but a
fourth part of what was divided between the mother and three sisters.The King was this night very obscurely buried in a
vault under Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster, without any manner of
pomp, and soon forgotten after all this vanity, and the face of the
whole Court was exceedingly changed into a more solemn and moral
behavior; the new King affecting neither profaneness nor buffoonery.All
the great officers broke their staves over the grave, according to form.The second
sermon should have been before the King; but he, to the great grief of
his subjects, did now, for the first time, go to mass publicly in the
little Oratory at the Duke's lodgings, the doors being set wide open.I dined at Sir Robert Howard's, auditor of the
exchequer, a gentleman pretending to all manner of arts and sciences,
for which he had been the subject of comedy, under the name of Sir
Positive; not ill-natured, but insufferably boasting.He was son to the
late Earl of Berkshire.This morning his Majesty restored the staff and key
to Lord Arlington, Chamberlain; to Mr.Savell, Vice-chamberlain; to
Lords Newport and Maynard, Treasurer and Comptroller of the household.Lord Godolphin made Chamberlain to the Queen; Lord Peterborough groom of
the stole, in place of the Earl of Bath; the Treasurer's staff to the
Earl of Rochester; and his brother, the Earl of Clarendon, Lord Privy
Seal, in the place of the Marquis of Halifax, who was made President of
the Council; the Secretaries of State remaining as before.The Lord Treasurer and the other new officers were
sworn at the Chancery Bar and the exchequer.The late King having the revenue of excise, customs, and other late
duties granted for his life only, they were now farmed and let to
several persons, upon an opinion that the late King might let them for
three years after his decease; some of the old commissioners refused to
act.The lease was made but the day before the King died;[58] the major
part of the Judges (but, as some think, not the best lawyers),
pronounced it legal, but four dissented.[Footnote 58: James, in his Life, makes no mention of this lease,
    but only says HE continued to collect them, which conduct was not
    blamed; but, on the contrary, he was thanked for it, in an address
    from the Middle Temple, penned by Sir Bartholomew Shore, and
    presented by Sir Humphrey Mackworth, carrying great authority with
    it; nor did the Parliament find fault.]The clerk of the closet had shut up the late King's private oratory next
the Privy-chamber above, but the King caused it to be opened again, and
that prayers should be said as formerly.Several most useful tracts against Dissenters,
<DW7>s and Fanatics, and resolutions of cases were now published by the
London divines.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th March, 1685.To my grief, I saw the new pulpit set up in the Popish
Oratory at Whitehall for the Lent preaching, mass being publicly said,
and the Romanists swarming at Court with greater confidence than had
ever been seen in England since the Reformation, so that everybody grew
jealous as to what this would tend.A Parliament was now summoned, and great industry used to obtain
elections which might promote the Court interest, most of the
corporations being now, by their new charters, empowered to make what
returns of members they pleased.There came over divers envoys and great persons to condole the death of
the late King, who were received by the Queen-Dowager on a bed of
mourning, the whole chamber, ceiling and floor, hung with black, and
tapers were lighted, so as nothing could be more lugubrious and solemn.The Queen-Consort sat under a state on a black foot-cloth, to entertain
the circle (as the Queen used to do), and that very decently.Lent preachers continued as formerly in the Royal
Chapel.My daughter, Mary, was taken with smallpox, and there
soon was found no hope of her recovery.A great affliction to me: but
God's holy will be done!She received the blessed sacrament; after which,
disposing herself to suffer what God should determine to inflict, she
bore the remainder of her sickness with extraordinary patience and
piety, and more than ordinary resignation and blessed frame of mind.She
died the 14th, to our unspeakable sorrow and affliction, and not to
our's only, but that of all who knew her, who were many of the best
quality, greatest and most virtuous persons.The justness of her
stature, person, comeliness of countenance, gracefulness of motion,
unaffected, though more than ordinarily beautiful, were the least of her
ornaments compared with those of her mind.Of early piety, singularly
religious, spending a part of every day in private devotion, reading,
and other virtuous exercises; she had collected and written out many of
the most useful and judicious periods of the books she read in a kind of
common-place, as out of Dr.Hammond on the New Testament, and most of
the best practical treatises.She had read and digested a considerable
deal of history, and of places.The French tongue was as familiar to her
as English; she understood Italian, and was able to render a laudable
account of what she read and observed, to which assisted a most faithful
memory and discernment; and she did make very prudent and discreet
reflections upon what she had observed of the conversations among which
she had at any time been, which being continually of persons of the best
quality, she thereby improved.She had an excellent voice, to which she
played a thorough-bass on the harpsichord, in both which she arrived to
that perfection, that of the scholars of those two famous masters,
Signors Pietro and Bartholomeo, she was esteemed the best; for the
sweetness of her voice and management of it added such an agreeableness
to her countenance, without any constraint or concern, that when she
sung, it was as charming to the eye as to the ear; this I rather note,
because it was a universal remark, and for which so many noble and
judicious persons in music desired to hear her, the last being at Lord
Arundel's, at Wardour.What shall I say, or rather not say, of the cheerfulness and
agreeableness of her humor?condescending to the meanest servant in the
family, or others, she still kept up respect, without the least pride.She would often read to them, examine, instruct, and pray with them if
they were sick, so as she was exceedingly beloved of everybody.Piety
was so prevalent an ingredient in her constitution (as I may say), that
even among equals and superiors she no sooner became intimately
acquainted, but she would endeavor to improve them, by insinuating
something religious, and that tended to bring them to a love of
devotion; she had one or two confidants with whom she used to pass whole
days in fasting, reading, and prayers, especially before the monthly
communion, and other solemn occasions.She abhorred flattery, and,
though she had abundance of wit, the raillery was so innocent and
ingenious that it was most agreeable; she sometimes would see a play,
but since the stage grew licentious, expressed herself weary of them,
and the time spent at the theater was an unaccountable vanity.She never
played at cards without extreme importunity and for the company; but
this was so very seldom, that I cannot number it among anything she
could name a fault.No one could read prose or verse better or with more judgment; and as
she read, so she wrote, not only most correct orthography, with that
maturity of judgment and exactness of the periods, choice of
expressions, and familiarity of style, that some letters of hers have
astonished me and others, to whom she has occasionally written.She had
a talent of rehearsing any comical part or poem, as to them she might be
decently free with; was more pleasing than heard on the theater; she
danced with the greatest grace I had ever seen, and so would her master
say, who was Monsieur Isaac; but she seldom showed that perfection, save
in the gracefulness of her carriage, which was with an air of sprightly
modesty not easily to be described.Nothing affected, but natural and
easy as well in her deportment as in her discourse, which was always
material, not trifling, and to which the extraordinary sweetness of her
tone, even in familiar speaking, was very charming.Nothing was so
pretty as her descending to play with little children, whom she would
caress and humor with great delight.But she most affected to be with
grave and sober men, of whom she might learn something, and improve
herself.I have been assisted by her in reading and praying by me;
comprehensive of uncommon notions, curious of knowing everything to some
excess, had I not sometimes repressed it.Nothing was so delightful to her as to go into my Study, where she would
willingly have spent whole days, for as I said she had read abundance of
history, and all the best poets, even Terence, Plautus, Homer, Virgil,
Horace, Ovid; all the best romancers and modern poems; she could compose
happily and put in pretty symbols, as in the "_Mundus Muliebris_,"
wherein is an enumeration of the immense variety of the modes and
ornaments belonging to the sex.But all these are vain trifles to the
virtues which adorned her soul; she was sincerely religious, most
dutiful to her parents, whom she loved with an affection tempered with
great esteem, so as we were easy and free, and never were so well
pleased as when she was with us, nor needed we other conversation; she
was kind to her sisters, and was still improving them by her constant
course of piety.Oh, dear, sweet, and desirable child, how shall I part
with all this goodness and virtue without the bitterness of sorrow and
reluctancy of a tender parent!Thy affection, duty and love to me was
that of a friend as well as a child.Nor less dear to thy mother, whose
example and tender care of thee was unparalleled, nor was thy return to
her less conspicuous.To the grave shall we both carry thy memory!God alone (in
whose bosom thou art at rest and happy!)give us to resign thee and all
our contentments (for thou indeed wert all in this world) to his blessed
pleasure!Let him be glorified by our submission, and give us grace to
bless him for the graces he implanted in thee, thy virtuous life, pious
and holy death, which is indeed the only comfort of our souls, hastening
through the infinite love and mercy of the Lord Jesus to be shortly with
thee, dear child, and with thee and those blessed saints like thee,
glorify the Redeemer of the world to all eternity!It was in the 19th year of her age that this sickness happened to her.An accident contributed to this disease; she had an apprehension of it
in particular, which struck her but two days before she came home, by an
imprudent gentlewoman whom she went with Lady Falkland to visit, who,
after they had been a good while in the house, told them she has a
servant sick of the smallpox (who indeed died the next day): this my
poor child acknowledged made an impression on her spirits.There were
four gentlemen of quality offering to treat with me about marriage, and
I freely gave her her own choice, knowing her discretion.She showed
great indifference to marrying at all, for truly, says she to her mother
(the other day), were I assured of your life and my dear father's, never
would I part from you; I love you and this home, where we serve God,
above all things, nor ever shall I be so happy; I know and consider the
vicissitudes of the world, I have some experience of its vanities, and
but for decency more than inclination, and that you judge it expedient
for me, I would not change my condition, but rather add the fortune you
design me to my sisters, and keep up the reputation of our family.This
was so discreetly and sincerely uttered that it could not but proceed
from an extraordinary child, and one who loved her parents beyond
example.At London, she took this fatal disease, and the occasion of her being
there was this: my Lord Viscount Falkland's Lady having been our
neighbor (as he was Treasurer of the Navy), she took so great an
affection to my daughter, that when they went back in the autumn to the
city, nothing would satisfy their incessant importunity but letting her
accompany my Lady, and staying some time with her; it was with the
greatest reluctance I complied.While she was there, my Lord being
musical, when I saw my Lady would not part with her till Christmas, I
was not unwilling she should improve the opportunity of learning of
Signor Pietro, who had an admirable way both of composure and teaching.It was the end of February before I could prevail with my Lady to part
with her; but my Lord going into Oxfordshire to stand for Knight of the
Shire there, she expressed her wish to come home, being tired of the
vain and empty conversation of the town, the theaters, the court, and
trifling visits which consumed so much precious time, and made her
sometimes miss of that regular course of piety that gave her the
greatest satisfaction.She was weary of this life, and I think went not
thrice to Court all this time, except when her mother or I carried her.She did not affect showing herself, she knew the Court well, and passed
one summer in it at Windsor with Lady Tuke, one of the Queen's women of
the bedchamber (a most virtuous relation of hers); she was not fond of
that glittering scene, now become abominably licentious, though there
was a design of Lady Rochester and Lady Clarendon to have made her a
maid of honor to the Queen as soon as there was a vacancy.But this she
did not set her heart upon, nor indeed on anything so much as the
service of God, a quiet and regular life, and how she might improve
herself in the most necessary accomplishments, and to which she was
arrived at so great a measure.This is the little history and imperfect character of my dear child,
whose piety, virtue, and incomparable endowments deserve a monument more
durable than brass and marble.Much I could enlarge on every period of this hasty account, but that I
ease and discharge my overcoming passion for the present, so many things
worthy an excellent Christian and dutiful child crowding upon me.Never
can I say enough, oh dear, my dear child, whose memory is so precious to
me!This dear child was born at Wotton, in the same house and chamber in
which I first drew my breath, my wife having retired to my brother there
in the great sickness that year upon the first of that month, and the
very hour that I was born, upon the last: viz, October.[Sidenote: SAYES COURT]

16th March, 1685.She was interred in the southeast end of the church at
Deptford, near her grandmother and several of my younger children and
relations.My desire was she should have been carried and laid among my
own parents and relations at Wotton, where I desire to be interred
myself, when God shall call me out of this uncertain transitory life,
but some circumstances did not permit it.Holden,
preached her funeral sermon on Phil."For to me to live is
Christ, and to die is gain," upon which he made an apposite discourse,
as those who heard it assured me (for grief suffered me not to be
present), concluding with a modest recital of her many virtues and
signal piety, so as to draw both tears and admiration from the hearers.I was not altogether unwilling that something of this sort should be
spoken, for the edification and encouragement of other young people.Divers noble persons honored her funeral, some in person, others
sending their coaches, of which there were six or seven with six horses,
viz, the Countess of Sunderland, Earl of Clarendon, Lord Godolphin, Sir
Stephen Fox, Sir William Godolphin, Viscount Falkland, and others.There
were distributed among her friends about sixty rings.Thus lived, died, and was buried the joy of my life, and ornament of her
sex and of my poor family!God Almighty of his infinite mercy grant me
the grace thankfully to resign myself and all I have, or had, to his
divine pleasure, and in his good time, restoring health and comfort to
my family: "teach me so to number my days, that I may apply my heart to
wisdom," be prepared for my dissolution, and that into the hands of my
blessed Savior I may recommend my spirit!On looking into her closet, it is incredible what a number of
collections she had made from historians, poets, travelers, etc., but,
above all, devotions, contemplations, and resolutions on these
contemplations, found under her hand in a book most methodically
disposed; prayers, meditations, and devotions on particular occasions,
with many pretty letters to her confidants; one to a divine (not named)
to whom she writes that he would be her ghostly father, and would not
despise her for her many errors and the imperfections of her youth, but
beg of God to give her courage to acquaint him with all her faults,
imploring his assistance and spiritual directions.I well remember she
had often desired me to recommend her to such a person; but I did not
think fit to do it as yet, seeing her apt to be scrupulous, and knowing
the great innocency and integrity of her life.It is astonishing how one who had acquired such substantial and
practical knowledge in other ornamental parts of education, especially
music, both vocal and instrumental, in dancing, paying and receiving
visits, and necessary conversation, could accomplish half of what she
has left; but, as she never affected play or cards, which consume a
world of precious time, so she was in continual exercise, which yet
abated nothing of her most agreeable conversation.But she was a little
miracle while she lived, and so she died!I was invited to the funeral of Captain Gunman, that
excellent pilot and seaman, who had behaved himself so gallantly in the
Dutch war.He died of a gangrene, occasioned by his fall from the pier
of Calais.This was the Captain of the yacht carrying the Duke (now
King) to Scotland, and was accused for not giving timely warning when
she split on the sands, where so many perished; but I am most confident
he was no ways guilty, either of negligence, or design, as he made
appear not only at the examination of the matter of fact, but in the
vindication he showed me, and which must needs give any man of reason
satisfaction.He was a sober, frugal, cheerful, and temperate man; we
have few such seamen left.Being now somewhat composed after my great affliction,
I went to London to hear Dr.Tenison (it being on a Wednesday in Lent)
at Whitehall.I observed that though the King was not in his seat above
in the chapel, the Doctor made his three congees, which they were not
used to do when the late King was absent, making then one bowing only.I
asked the reason; it was said he had a special order so to do.The
Princess of Denmark was in the King's closet, but sat on the left hand
of the chair, the Clerk of the Closet standing by his Majesty's chair,
as if he had been present.I met the Queen Dowager going now first from Whitehall to dwell at
Somerset House.This day my brother of Wotton and Mr.Onslow were candidates for Surrey
against Sir Adam Brown and my cousin, Sir Edward Evelyn, and were
circumvented in their election by a trick of the Sheriff's, taking
advantage of my brother's party going out of the small village of
Leatherhead to seek shelter and lodging, the afternoon being
tempestuous, proceeding to the election when they were gone; they
expecting the next morning; whereas before and then they exceeded the
other party by many hundreds, as I am assured.The Duke of Norfolk led
Sir Edward Evelyn's and Sir Adam Brown's party.For this Parliament,
very mean and slight persons (some of them gentlemen's servants, clerks,
and persons neither of reputation nor interest) were set up; but the
country would choose my brother whether he would or no, and he missed it
by the trick above mentioned.Sir Adam Brown was so deaf, that he could
not hear one word.Sir Edward Evelyn was an honest gentleman, much in
favor with his Majesty.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1685.I went early to Whitehall to hear Dr.Tillotson, Dean
of Canterbury, preaching on Eccles.I returned in the evening,
and visited Lady Tuke, and found with her Sir George Wakeman, the
physician, whom I had seen tried and acquitted, among the plotters for
poisoning the late King, on the accusation of the famous Oates; and
surely I believed him guiltless.According to my custom, I went to London to pass the
holy week.Tenison preached at the new church at
St.22, upon the infinite love of God to us, which
he illustrated in many instances.The Holy Sacrament followed, at which
I participated.Sprat,
Bishop of Rochester, preached in Whitehall chapel, the auditory very
full of Lords, the two Archbishops, and many others, now drawn to town
upon occasion of the coronation and ensuing Parliament.I supped with
the Countess of Sunderland and Lord Godolphin, and returned home.Was the coronation of the King and Queen.The solemnity
was magnificent as is set forth in print.The Bishop of Ely preached;
but, to the sorrow of the people, no Sacrament, as ought to have been.However, the King begins his reign with great expectations, and hopes of
much reformation as to the late vices and profaneness of both Court and
country.Having been present at the late King's coronation, I was not
ambitious of seeing this ceremony.A young man preached, going chaplain with Sir J. Wiburn,
Governor of Bombay, in the East Indies.I was in Westminster Hall when Oates, who had made such
a stir in the kingdom, on his revealing a plot of the <DW7>s, and
alarmed several Parliaments, and had occasioned the execution of divers
priests, noblemen, etc., was tried for perjury at the King's bench; but,
being very tedious, I did not endeavor to see the issue, considering
that it would be published.Abundance of Roman Catholics were in the
hall in expectation of the most grateful conviction and ruin of a person
who had been so obnoxious to them, and as I verily believe, had done
much mischief and great injury to several by his violent and
ill-grounded proceedings; while he was at first so unreasonably blown up
and encouraged, that his insolence was no longer sufferable.Roger L'Estrange (a gentleman whom I had long known, and a person of
excellent parts, abating some affectations) appearing first against the
Dissenters in several tracts, had now for some years turned his style
against those whom (by way of hateful distinction) they called Whigs and
Trimmers, under the title of "Observator," which came out three or four
days every week, in which sheets, under pretense to serve the Church of
England, he gave suspicion of gratifying another party, by several
passages which rather kept up animosities than appeased them, especially
now that nobody gave the least occasion.[59]

    [Footnote 59: In the first Dutch war, while Evelyn was one of the
    Commissioners for sick and wounded, L'Estrange in his "Gazette"
    mentioned the barbarous usage of the Dutch prisoners of war:
    whereupon Evelyn wrote him a very spirited letter, desiring that the
    Dutch Ambassador (who was then in England) and his friends would
    visit the prisoners, and examine their provisions; and he required
    L'Estrange to publish that vindication in his next number.]The Scots valuing themselves exceedingly to have been
the first Parliament called by his Majesty, gave the excise and customs
to him and his successors forever; the Duke of Queensberry making
eloquent speeches, and especially minding them of a speedy suppression
of those late desperate Field-Conventiclers who had done such unheard of
assassinations.In the meantime, elections for the ensuing Parliament in
England were thought to be very indirectly carried on in most places.God grant a better issue of it than some expect!Oates was sentenced to be whipped and pilloried with the
utmost severity.I dined at my Lord Privy Seal's with Sir William
Dugdale, Garter King-at-Arms, author of the "MONASTICON" and other
learned works; he told me he was 82 years of age, and had his sight and
memory perfect.There was shown a draft of the exact shape and
dimensions of the crown the Queen had been crowned withal, together with
the jewels and pearls, their weight and value, which amounted to
L100,658 sterling, attested at the foot of the paper by the jeweler and
goldsmith who set them.In the morning, I went with a French gentleman, and my
Lord Privy Seal to the House of Lords, where we were placed by his
Lordship next the bar, just below the bishops, very commodiously both
for hearing and seeing.After a short space, came in the Queen and
Princess of Denmark, and stood next above the archbishops, at the side
of the House on the right hand of the throne.In the interim, divers of
the Lords, who had not finished before, took the test and usual oaths,
so that her Majesty, the Spanish and other Ambassadors, who stood behind
the throne, heard the Pope and the worship of the Virgin Mary, etc.,
renounced very decently, as likewise the prayers which followed,
standing all the while.Then came in the King, the crown on his head,
and being seated, the Commons were introduced, and the House being full,
he drew forth a paper containing his speech, which he read distinctly
enough, to this effect: "That he resolved to call a Parliament from the
moment of his brother's decease, as the best means to settle all the
concerns of the nation, so as to be most easy and happy to himself and
his subjects; that he would confirm whatever he had said in his
declaration at the first Council concerning his opinion of the
principles of the Church of England, for their loyalty, and would defend
and support it, and preserve its government as by law now established;
that, as he would invade no man's property, so he would never depart
from his own prerogative; and, as he had ventured his life in defense of
the nation, so he would proceed to do still; that, having given this
assurance of his care of our religion (his word was YOUR religion) and
property (which he had not said by chance, but solemnly), so he doubted
not of suitable returns of his subjects' duty and kindness, especially
as to settling his revenue for life, for the many weighty necessities of
government, which he would not suffer to be precarious; that some might
possibly suggest that it were better to feed and supply him from time to
time only, out of their inclination to frequent Parliaments; but that
that would be a very improper method to take with him, since the best
way to engage him to meet oftener would be always to use him well, and
therefore he expected their compliance speedily, that this session being
but short, they might meet again to satisfaction."At every period of this, the House gave loud shouts.Then he acquainted
them with that morning's news of Argyle's being landed in the West
Highlands of Scotland from Holland, and the treasonous declaration he
had published, which he would communicate to them, and that he should
take the best care he could it should meet with the reward it deserved,
not questioning the Parliament's zeal and readiness to assist him as he
desired; at which there followed another "_Vive le Roi_," and so his
Majesty retired.So soon as the Commons were returned and had put themselves into a grand
committee, they immediately put the question, and unanimously voted the
revenue to his Majesty for life.Seymour made a bold speech against
many elections, and would have had those members who (he pretended) were
obnoxious, to withdraw, till they had cleared the matter of their being
legally returned; but no one seconded him.The truth is, there were many
of the new members whose elections and returns were universally
censured, many of them being persons of no condition, or interest, in
the nation, or places for which they served, especially in Devon,
Cornwall, Norfolk, etc., said to have been recommended by the Court, and
from the effect of the new charters changing the electors.It was
reported that Lord Bath carried down with him [into Cornwall] no fewer
than fifteen charters, so that some called him the Prince Elector:
whence Seymour told the House in his speech that if this was digested,
they might introduce what religion and laws they pleased, and that
though he never gave heed to the fears and jealousies of the people
before, he was now really apprehensive of Popery.By the printed list of
members of 505, there did not appear to be above 135 who had been in
former Parliaments, especially that lately held at Oxford.In the Lords' House, Lord Newport made an exception against two or three
young Peers, who wanted some months, and some only four or five days, of
being of age.The Popish Lords, who had been sometime before released from their
confinement about the plot, were now discharged of their impeachment, of
which I gave Lord Arundel of Wardour joy.Oates, who had but two days before been pilloried at several places and
whipped at the cart's tail from Newgate to Aldgate, was this day placed
on a sledge, being not able to go by reason of so late scourging, and
dragged from prison to Tyburn, and whipped again all the way, which some
thought to be severe and extraordinary; but, if he was guilty of the
perjuries, and so of the death of many innocents (as I fear he was), his
punishment was but what he deserved.I chanced to pass just as execution
was doing on him.Note: there was no speech made by the Lord Keeper [Bridgman] after his
Majesty, as usual.It was whispered he would not be long in that situation, and many
believe the bold Chief Justice Jefferies, who was made Baron of Wem, in
Shropshire, and who went thorough stitch in that tribunal, stands fair
for that office.I gave him joy the morning before of his new honor, he
having always been very civil to me.We had hitherto not any rain for many months, so as the
caterpillars had already devoured all the winter fruit through the whole
land, and even killed several greater old trees.Such two winters and
summers I had never known.Came to visit and take leave of me Sir Gabriel Sylvius,
now going Envoy-extraordinary into Denmark, with his secretary and
chaplain, a Frenchman, who related the miserable persecution of the
Protestants in France; not above ten churches left them, and those also
threatened to be demolished; they were commanded to christen their
children within twenty-four hours after birth, or else a Popish priest
was to be called, and then the infant brought up in Popery.In some
places, they were thirty leagues from any minister, or opportunity of
worship.This persecution had displeased the most industrious part of
the nation, and dispersed those into Switzerland, Burgundy, Holland,
Germany, Denmark, England, and the Plantations.There were with Sir
Gabriel, his lady, Sir William Godolphin and sisters, and my Lord
Godolphin's little son, my charge.I brought them to the water side
where Sir Gabriel embarked, and the rest returned to London.There was now certain intelligence of the Duke of
Monmouth landing at Lyme, in Dorsetshire, and of his having set up his
standard as King of England.I pray God deliver us from the confusion
which these beginnings threaten!Such a dearth for want of rain was never in my memory.The Duke landed with but 150 men; but the whole kingdom
was alarmed, fearing that the disaffected would join them, many of the
trained bands flocking to him.At his landing, he published a
Declaration, charging his Majesty with usurpation and several horrid
crimes, on pretense of his own title, and offering to call a free
Parliament.This declaration was ordered to be burnt by the hangman, the
Duke proclaimed a traitor, and a reward of L5,000 to any who should kill
him.At this time, the words engraved on the monument in London, intimating
that the <DW7>s fired the city, were erased and cut out.I received a warrant to send out a horse with twelve
days' provisions, etc.We had now plentiful rain after two years' excessive
drought and severe winters.Argyle taken in Scotland, and executed, and his party dispersed.No considerable account of the troops sent against the
Duke, though great forces sent.There was a smart skirmish; but he would
not be provoked to come to an encounter, but still kept in the
fastnesses.Dangerfield whipped, like Oates, for perjury.Came news of Monmouth's utter defeat, and the next day
of his being taken by Sir William Portman and Lord Lumley with the
militia of their counties.It seems the Horse, commanded by Lord Grey,
being newly raised and undisciplined, were not to be brought in so short
a time to endure the fire, which exposed the Foot to the King's, so as
when Monmouth had led the Foot in great silence and order, thinking to
surprise Lieutenant-General Lord Feversham newly encamped, and given him
a smart charge, interchanging both great and small shot, the Horse,
breaking their own ranks, Monmouth gave it over, and fled with Grey,
leaving their party to be cut in pieces to the number of 2,000.The
whole number reported to be above 8,000; the King's but 2,700.The slain
were most of them MENDIP-MINERS, who did great execution with their
tools, and sold their lives very dearly, while their leaders flying were
pursued and taken the next morning, not far from one another.Monmouth
had gone sixteen miles on foot, changing his habit for a poor coat, and
was found by Lord Lumley in a dry ditch covered with fern-brakes, but
without sword, pistol, or any weapon, and so might have passed for some
countryman, his beard being grown so long and so gray as hardly to be
known, had not his George discovered him, which was found in his pocket.It is said he trembled exceedingly all over, not able to speak.Grey was
taken not far from him.Most of his party were Anabaptists and poor
cloth workers of the country, no gentlemen of account being come in to
him.The arch-_boutefeu_, Ferguson, Matthews, etc., were not yet found.The L5,000 to be given to whoever should bring Monmouth in, was to be
distributed among the militia by agreement between Sir William Portman
and Lord Lumley.The battle ended, some words, first in jest, then in
passion, passed between Sherrington Talbot (a worthy gentleman, son to
Sir John Talbot, and who had behaved himself very handsomely) and one
Captain Love, both commanders of the militia, as to whose soldiers
fought best, both drawing their swords and passing at one another.Sherrington was wounded to death on the spot, to the great regret of
those who knew him.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th July, 1685.Just as I was coming into the lodgings at Whitehall, a
little before dinner, my Lord of Devonshire standing very near his
Majesty's bedchamber door in the lobby, came Colonel Culpeper, and in a
rude manner looking at my Lord in the face, asked whether this was a
time and place for excluders to appear; my Lord at first took little
notice of what he said, knowing him to be a hotheaded fellow, but he
reiterating it, my Lord asked Culpeper whether he meant him; he said
yes, he meant his Lordship.My Lord told him he was no excluder (as
indeed he was not); the other affirming it again, my Lord told him he
lied; on which Culpeper struck him a box on the ear, which my Lord
returned, and felled him.They were soon parted, Culpeper was seized,
and his Majesty, who was all the while in his bedchamber, ordered him to
be carried to the Greencloth officer, who sent him to the Marshalsea, as
he deserved.I supped this night at Lambeth at my old friend's Mr.Elias Ashmole's,
with my Lady Clarendon, the Bishop of St.Tenison, when
we were treated at a great feast.The Count of Castel Mellor, that great favorite and
prime minister of Alphonso, late King of Portugal, after several years'
banishment, being now received to grace and called home by Don Pedro,
the present King, as having been found a person of the greatest
integrity after all his sufferings, desired me to spend part of this day
with him, and assist him in a collection of books and other curiosities,
which he would carry with him into Portugal.Hussey, a young gentleman who made love to my late dear child, but
whom she could not bring herself to answer in affection, died now of the
same cruel disease, for which I was extremely sorry, because he never
enjoyed himself after my daughter's decease, nor was I averse to the
match, could she have overcome her disinclination.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th July, 1685.Monmouth was this day brought to London and examined before the King,
to whom he made great submission, acknowledged his seduction by
Ferguson, the Scot, whom he named the bloody villain.He was sent to the
Tower, had an interview with his late Duchess, whom he received coldly,
having lived dishonestly with the Lady Henrietta Wentworth for two
years.He obstinately asserted his conversation with that debauched
woman to be no sin; whereupon, seeing he could not be persuaded to his
last breath, the divines who were sent to assist him thought not fit to
administer the Holy Communion to him.For the rest of his faults he
professed great sorrow, and so died without any apparent fear.He would
not make use of a cap or other circumstance, but lying down, bid the
fellow to do his office better than to the late Lord Russell, and gave
him gold; but the wretch made five chops before he had his head off;
which so incensed the people, that had he not been guarded and got away,
they would have torn him to pieces.The Duke made no speech on the scaffold (which was on Tower Hill), but
gave a paper containing not above five or six lines, for the King, in
which he disclaims all title to the Crown, acknowledges that the late
King, his father, had indeed told him he was but his base son, and so
desired his Majesty to be kind to his wife and children.Martin's), who, with the Bishops of
Ely and Bath and Wells, were sent to him by his Majesty, and were at the
execution.Thus ended this quondam Duke, darling of his father and the ladies,
being extremely handsome and adroit, an excellent soldier and dancer, a
favorite of the people, of an easy nature, debauched by lust; seduced by
crafty knaves, who would have set him up only to make a property, and
taken the opportunity of the King being of another religion, to gather a
party of discontented men.He was a lovely person, had a virtuous and excellent lady that brought
him great riches, and a second dukedom in Scotland.He was Master of the
Horse, General of the King his father's army, Gentleman of the
Bedchamber, Knight of the Garter, Chancellor of Cambridge, in a word,
had accumulations without end.See what ambition and want of principles
brought him to!He was beheaded on Tuesday, 14th of July.His mother,
whose name was Barlow, daughter of some very mean creatures, was a
beautiful strumpet, whom I had often seen at Paris; she died miserably
without anything to bury her; yet this Perkin had been made to believe
that the King had married her, a monstrous and ridiculous forgery!And
to satisfy the world of the iniquity of the report, the King his father
(if his father he really was, for he most resembled one Sidney who was
familiar with his mother) publicly and most solemnly renounced it, to be
so entered in the Council Book some years since, with all the Privy
Councillors' attestation.[60]

    [Footnote 60: The "Life of James II."contains an account of the
    circumstances of the Duke of Monmouth's birth, which may be given in
    illustration of the statements of the text.Ross, tutor to the Duke
    of Monmouth, is there said to have proposed to Bishop Cosins to sign
    a certificate of the King's marriage to Mrs.Barlow, though her own
    name was Walters: but this the Bishop refused.She was born of a
    gentleman's family in Wales, but having little means and less grace,
    came to London to make her fortune.Algernon Sydney, then a Colonel
    in Cromwell's army, had agreed to give her fifty broad pieces (as he
    told the Duke of York); but being ordered hastily away with his
    regiment, he missed his bargain.She went into Holland, where she
    fell into the hands of his brother, Colonel Robert Sydney, who kept
    her for some time, till the King hearing of her, got her from him.On which the Colonel was heard to say, Let who will have her, she is
    already sped; and, after being with the King, she was so soon with
    child, that the world had no cause to doubt whose child it was, and
    the rather that when he grew to be a man, he very much resembled the
    Colonel both in stature and countenance, even to a wart on his face.In the King's absence she behaved
    so loosely, that on his return from his escape at Worcester he would
    have no further commerce with her, and she became a common
    prostitute at Paris.]Had it not pleased God to dissipate this attempt in the beginning, there
would in all appearance have gathered an irresistible force which would
have desperately proceeded to the ruin of the Church and Government; so
general was the discontent and expectation of the opportunity.For my
own part, I looked upon this deliverance as most signal.Such an
inundation of fanatics and men of impious principles must needs have
caused universal disorder, cruelty, injustice, rapine, sacrilege, and
confusion, an unavoidable civil war, and misery without end.Blessed be
God, the knot was happily broken, and a fair prospect of tranquillity
for the future, if we reform, be thankful, and make a right use of this
mercy!I went to see the muster of the six Scotch and English
regiments whom the Prince of Orange had lately sent to his Majesty out
of Holland upon this rebellion, but which were now returning, there
having been no occasion for their use.They were all excellently clad
and well disciplined, and were encamped on Blackheath with their tents:
the King and Queen came to see them exercise, and the manner of their
encampment, which was very neat and magnificent.By a gross mistake of the Secretary of his Majesty's Forces, it had
been ordered that they should be quartered in private houses, contrary
to an Act of Parliament, but, on my informing his Majesty timely of it,
it was prevented.The two horsemen which my son and myself sent into the county troops,
were now come home, after a month's being out to our great charge.The Trinity Company met this day, which should have
been on the Monday after Trinity, but was put off by reason of the Royal
Charter being so large, that it could not be ready before.Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty, was a
second time chosen Master.There were present the Duke of Grafton, Lord
Dartmouth, Master of the Ordnance, the Commissioners of the Navy, and
Brethren of the Corporation.We went to church, according to custom, and
then took barge to the Trinity House, in London, where we had a great
dinner, above eighty at one table.[Sidenote: CHELSEA]

7th August, 1685.Watts, keeper of the Apothecaries'
garden of simples at Chelsea, where there is a collection of innumerable
rarities of that sort particularly, besides many rare annuals, the tree
bearing Jesuit's bark, which had done such wonders in quartan agues.What was very ingenious was the subterranean heat, conveyed by a stove
under the conservatory, all vaulted with brick, so as he has the doors
and windows open in the hardest frosts, secluding only the snow.Boscawen, with my Lord
Godolphin's little son, with whose education hitherto his father had
intrusted me.My daughter Elizabeth died of the smallpox, soon
after having married a young man, nephew of Sir John Tippett, Surveyor
of the Navy, and one of the Commissioners.The 30th, she was buried in
the church at Deptford.Thus, in less than six months were we deprived
of two children for our unworthiness and causes best known to God, whom
I beseech from the bottom of my heart that he will give us grace to make
that right use of all these chastisements, that we may become better,
and entirely submit in all things to his infinitely wise disposal.Lord Clarendon (Lord Privy Seal) wrote to let me
know that the King being pleased to send him Lord-Lieutenant into
Ireland, was also pleased to nominate me one of the Commissioners to
execute the office of Privy Seal during his Lieutenancy there, it
behoving me to wait upon his Majesty to give him thanks for this great
honor.I accompanied his Lordship to Windsor (dining by
the way of Sir Henry Capel's at Kew), where his Majesty receiving me
with extraordinary kindness, I kissed his hand, I told him how sensible
I was of his Majesty's gracious favor to me, that I would endeavor to
serve him with all sincerity, diligence, and loyalty, not more out of my
duty than inclination.He said he doubted not of it, and was glad he had
the opportunity to show me the kindness he had for me.After this, came
abundance of great men to give me joy.I went to prayer in the chapel, and heard
Dr.11, persuading to unity and peace, and to be mindful of our
own business, according to the advice of the apostle.Then I went to
hear a Frenchman who preached before the King and Queen in that splendid
chapel next St.Their Majesties going to mass, I withdrew
to consider the stupendous painting of the Hall, which, both for the art
and invention, deserve the inscription in honor of the painter, Signor
Verrio.receiving the Black Prince, coming
toward him in a Roman triumph.The throne, the carvings, etc., are incomparable, and I think
equal to any, and in many circumstances exceeding any, I have seen
abroad.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, with (among others) Sir William Soames,
designed Ambassador to Constantinople.About 6 o'clock came Sir Dudley and his brother Roger North, and
brought the Great Seal from my Lord Keeper, who died the day before at
his house in Oxfordshire.The King went immediately to council;
everybody guessing who was most likely to succeed this great officer;
most believing it could be no other than my Lord Chief Justice
Jefferies, who had so vigorously prosecuted the late rebels, and was now
gone the Western Circuit, to punish the rest that were secured in
several counties, and was now near upon his return.I took my leave of
his Majesty, who spoke very graciously to me, and supping that night at
Sir Stephen Fox's, I promised to dine there the next day.Pepys to Portsmouth, whither his
Majesty was going the first time since his coming to the Crown, to see
in what state the fortifications were.We took coach and six horses,
late after dinner, yet got to Bagshot that night.While supper was
making ready I went and made a visit to Mrs.Graham, some time maid of
honor to the Queen Dowager, now wife to James Graham, Esq., of the privy
purse to the King; her house being a walk in the forest, within a little
quarter of a mile from Bagshot town.Very importunate she was that I
would sup, and abide there that night; but, being obliged by my
companion, I returned to our inn, after she had shown me her house,
which was very commodious, and well furnished, as she was an excellent
housewife, a prudent and virtuous lady.There is a park full of red deer
about it.Her eldest son was now sick there of the smallpox, but in a
likely way of recovery, and other of her children run about, and among
the infected, which she said she let them do on purpose that they might
while young pass that fatal disease she fancied they were to undergo one
time or other, and that this would be the best: the severity of this
cruel distemper so lately in my poor family confirming much of what she
affirmed.[Sidenote: WINCHESTER]

16th September, 1685.The next morning, setting out early, we arrived
soon enough at Winchester to wait on the King, who was lodged at the
Dean's (Dr.I found very few with him besides my Lords
Feversham, Arran, Newport, and the Bishop of Bath and Wells.His Majesty
was discoursing with the bishops concerning miracles, and what strange
things the Saludadors[61] would do in Spain, as by creeping into heated
ovens without hurt, and that they had a black cross in the roof of their
mouths, but yet were commonly notorious and profane wretches; upon which
his Majesty further said, that he was so extremely difficult of
miracles, for fear of being imposed upon, that if he should chance to
see one himself, without some other witness, he should apprehend it a
delusion of his senses.Then they spoke of the boy who was pretended to
have a wanting leg restored him, so confidently asserted by Fr.To all of which the Bishop added a great miracle
happening in Winchester to his certain knowledge, of a poor, miserably
sick and decrepit child (as I remember long kept unbaptized) who
immediately on his baptism, recovered; as also of the salutary effect of
King Charles his Majesty's father's blood, in healing one that was
blind.[Footnote 61: Evelyn subjoins this note:--"As to that of the
    Saludador (of which likewise I remember Sir Arthur Hopton, formerly
    as Ambassador at Madrid, had told me many like wonders), Mr.Pepys
    passing through Spain, and being extremely inquisitive of the truth
    of these pretended miracles of the Saludadors, found a very famous
    one at last, to whom he offered a considerable reward if he would
    make a trial of the oven, or any other thing of that kind, before
    him; the fellow ingenuously told him, that finding he was a more
    than ordinary curious person, he would not deceive him, and so
    acknowledged that he could do none of the feats really, but that
    what they pretended was all a cheat, which he would easily discover,
    though the poor superstitious people were easily imposed upon; yet
    have these impostors an allowance of the Bishops to practice their
    jugglings.Pepys affirmed to me; but said he, I did not
    conceive it fit to interrupt his Majesty, who so solemnly told what
    they pretended to do.There was something said of the second sight happening to some persons,
especially Scotch; upon which his Majesty, and I think Lord Arran, told
us that Monsieur... a French nobleman, lately here in England, seeing
the late Duke of Monmouth come into the playhouse at London, suddenly
cried out to somebody sitting in the same box, "_Voila Monsieur comme il
entre sans tete!_" Afterward his Majesty spoke of some relics that had
effected strange cures, particularly a piece of our blessed Savior's
cross, that healed a gentleman's rotten nose by only touching.And
speaking of the golden cross and chain taken out of the coffin of St.Edward the Confessor at Westminster, by one of the singing-men, who, as
the scaffolds were taken down after his Majesty's coronation, espying a
hole in the tomb, and something glisten, put his hand in, and brought it
to the dean, and he to the King; his Majesty began to put the Bishop in
mind how earnestly the late King (his brother) called upon him during
his agony, to take out what he had in his pocket."I had thought," said
the King, "it had been for some keys, which might lead to some cabinet
that his Majesty would have me secure"; but, says he, "you will remember
that I found nothing in any of his pockets but a cross of gold, and a
few insignificant papers"; and thereupon he showed us the cross, and was
pleased to put it into my hand.It was of gold, about three inches long,
having on one side a crucifix enameled and embossed, the rest was graved
and garnished with goldsmiths' work, and two pretty broad table
amethysts (as I conceived), and at the bottom a pendant pearl; within
was enchased a little fragment, as was thought, of the true cross, and a
Latin inscription in gold and Roman letters.More company coming in,
this discourse ended.I may not forget a resolution which his Majesty
made, and had a little before entered upon it at the Council Board at
Windsor or Whitehall, that the <DW64>s in the plantations should all be
baptized, exceedingly declaiming against that impiety of their masters
prohibiting it, out of a mistaken opinion that they would be _ipso
facto_ free; but his Majesty persists in his resolution to have them
christened, which piety the Bishop blessed him for.I went out to see the new palace the late King had begun, and brought
almost to the covering.It is placed on the side of the hill, where
formerly stood the old castle.It is a stately fabric, of three sides
and a corridor, all built of brick, and cornished, windows and columns
at the break and entrance of free-stone.It was intended for a
hunting-house when his Majesty should come to these parts, and has an
incomparable prospect.I believe there had already been L20,000 and more
expended; but his now Majesty did not seem to encourage the finishing it
at least for a while.Hence to see the Cathedral, a reverend pile, and in good repair.There
are still the coffins of the six Saxon Kings, whose bones had been
scattered by the sacrilegious rebels of 1641, in expectation, I suppose,
of finding some valuable relics, and afterward gathered up again and put
into new chests, which stand above the stalls of the choir.[Sidenote: PORTSMOUTH]

17th September, 1685.Early next morning, we went to Portsmouth,
something before his Majesty arrived.We found all the road full of
people, the women in their best dress, in expectation of seeing the King
pass by, which he did, riding on horseback a good part of the way.The
Mayor and Aldermen with their mace, and in their formalities, were
standing at the entrance of the fort, a mile on this side of the town,
where the Mayor made a speech to the King, and then the guns of the fort
were fired, as were those of the garrison, as soon as the King was come
into Portsmouth.All the soldiers (near 3,000) were drawn up, and lining
the streets and platform to God's House (the name of the Governor's
residence), where, after he had viewed the new fortifications and
shipyard, his Majesty was entertained at a magnificent dinner by Sir...
Slingsby, the Lieutenant Governor, all the gentlemen in his train
sitting down at table with him, which I also had done, had I not been
before engaged to Sir Robert Holmes, Governor of the Isle of Wight, to
dine with him at a private house, where likewise we had a very sumptuous
and plentiful repast of excellent venison, fowl, fish, and fruit.After dinner, I went to wait on his Majesty again, who was pulling on
his boots in the Town Hall adjoining the house where he dined, and then
having saluted some ladies, who came to kiss his hand, he took horse for
Winchester, whither he returned that night.This hall is artificially
hung round with arms of all sorts, like the hall and keep at Windsor.Hence, to see the shipyard and dock, the fortifications, and other
things.Portsmouth, when finished, will be very strong, and a noble quay.There
were now thirty-two men-of-war in the harbor.I was invited by Sir R.
Beach, the Commissioner, where, after a great supper, Mr.Secretary and
myself lay that night, and the next morning set out for Guildford, where
we arrived in good hour, and so the day after to London.I had twice before been at Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, etc., many
years since.I found this part of Hampshire bravely wooded, especially
about the house and estate of Colonel Norton, who though now in being,
having formerly made his peace by means of Colonel Legg, was formerly a
very fierce commander in the first Rebellion.His house is large, and
standing low, on the road from Winchester to Portsmouth.By what I observed in this journey, is that infinite industry,
sedulity, gravity, and great understanding and experience of affairs, in
his Majesty, that I cannot but predict much happiness to the nation, as
to its political government; and, if he so persist, there could be
nothing more desired to accomplish our prosperity, but that he was of
the national religion.Lord Clarendon's commission for Lieutenant of
Ireland was sealed this day.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d October, 1685.Pepys with this
expression at the foot of it, "I have something to show you that I may
not have another time," and that I would not fail to dine with him.Houblon (a rich and
considerable merchant, whose father had fled out of Flanders on the
persecution of the Duke of Alva) into a private room, and told us that
being lately alone with his Majesty, and upon some occasion of speaking
concerning my late Lord Arlington dying a Roman Catholic, who had all
along seemed to profess himself a Protestant, taken all the tests, etc.,
till the day (I think) of his death, his Majesty said that as to his
inclinations he had known them long wavering, but from fear of losing
his places, he did not think it convenient to declare himself.There
are, says the King, those who believe the Church of Rome gives
dispensations for going to church, and many like things, but that is not
so; for if that might have been had, he himself had most reason to make
use of it.INDEED, he said, as to SOME MATRIMONIAL CASES, THERE ARE NOW
AND THEN DISPENSATIONS, but hardly in any cases else.Pepys to beg of his Majesty, if
he might ask it without offense, and for that his Majesty could not but
observe how it was whispered among many whether his late Majesty had
been reconciled to the Church of Rome; he again humbly besought his
Majesty to pardon his presumption, if he had touched upon a thing which
did not befit him to look into.The King ingenuously told him that he
both was and died a Roman Catholic, and that he had not long since
declared that it was upon some politic and state reasons, best known to
himself (meaning the King his brother), but that he was of that
persuasion: he bid him follow him into his closet, where opening a
cabinet, he showed him two papers, containing about a quarter of a
sheet, on both sides written, in the late King's own hand, several
arguments opposite to the doctrine of the Church of England, charging
her with heresy, novelty, and the fanaticism of other Protestants, the
chief whereof was, as I remember, our refusing to acknowledge the
primacy and infallibility of the Church of Rome; how impossible it was
that so many ages should never dispute it, till of late; how unlikely
our Savior would leave his Church without a visible Head and guide to
resort to, during his absence; with the like usual topic; so well penned
as to the discourse as did by no means seem to me to have been put
together by the late King yet written all with his own hand, blotted and
interlined, so as, if indeed it was not given him by some priest, they
might be such arguments and reasons as had been inculcated from time to
time, and here recollected; and, in the conclusion, showing his looking
on the Protestant religion (and by name the Church of England) to be
without foundation, and consequently false and unsafe.When his Majesty
had shown him these originals, he was pleased to lend him the copies of
these two papers, attested at the bottom in four or five lines under his
own hand.This nice and curious passage I
thought fit to set down.Though all the arguments and objections were
altogether weak, and have a thousand times been answered by our divines;
they are such as their priests insinuate among their proselytes, as if
nothing were Catholic but the Church of Rome, no salvation out of that,
no reformation sufferable, bottoming all their errors on St.Peter's
successors' unerring dictatorship, but proving nothing with any reason,
or taking notice of any objection which could be made against it.Here
all was taken for granted, and upon it a resolution and preference
implied.I was heartily sorry to see all this, though it was no other than was
to be suspected, by his late Majesty's too great indifference, neglect,
and course of life, that he had been perverted, and for secular respects
only professed to be of another belief, and thereby giving great
advantage to our adversaries, both the Court and generally the youth and
great persons of the nation becoming dissolute and highly profane.God
was incensed to make his reign very troublesome and unprosperous, by
wars, plagues, fires, loss of reputation by an universal neglect of the
public for the love of a voluptuous and sensual life, which a vicious
Court had brought into credit.I think of it with sorrow and pity, when
I consider how good and debonair a nature that unhappy Prince was; what
opportunities he had to have made himself the most renowned King that
ever swayed the British scepter, had he been firm to that Church for
which his martyred and blessed father suffered; and had he been grateful
to Almighty God, who so miraculously restored him, with so excellent a
religion; had he endeavored to own and propagate it as he should have
done, not only for the good of his kingdom, but of all the Reformed
Churches in christendom, now weakened and near ruined through our
remissness and suffering them to be supplanted, persecuted, and
destroyed, as in France, which we took no notice of.The consequence of
this, time will show, and I wish it may proceed no further.The
emissaries and instruments of the Church of Rome will never rest till
they have crushed the Church of England, as knowing that alone to be
able to cope with them, and that they can never answer her fairly, but
lie abundantly open to the irresistible force of her arguments,
antiquity and purity of her doctrine, so that albeit it may move God,
for the punishment of a nation so unworthy, to eclipse again the
profession of her here, and darkness and superstition prevail, I am most
confident the doctrine of the Church of England will never be
extinguished, but remain visible, if not eminent, to the consummation of
the world.I have innumerable reasons that confirm me in this opinion,
which I forbear to mention here.In the meantime, as to the discourse of his Majesty with Mr.Pepys, and
those papers, as I do exceedingly prefer his Majesty's free and
ingenuous profession of what his own religion is, beyond concealment
upon any politic accounts, so I think him of a most sincere and honest
nature, one on whose word one may rely, and that he makes a conscience
of what he promises, to perform it.In this confidence, I hope that the
Church of England may yet subsist, and when it shall please God to open
his eyes and turn his heart (for that is peculiarly in the Lord's hands)
to flourish also.In all events, whatever does become of the Church of
England, it is certainly, of all the Christian professions on the earth,
the most primitive, apostolical, and excellent.I had my picture drawn this week by the famous
Kneller
