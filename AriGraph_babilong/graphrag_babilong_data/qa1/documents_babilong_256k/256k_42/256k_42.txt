The second is, when it twists to the right or left, without
rising or bending, but straight, with the head turned towards one of
the shoulders.The third motion, which is called complex, is, when to
the bending of it is added the twisting, as when the ear leans towards
one of the shoulders, the head turning the same way, and the face
turned upwards.LXXXVII./--_Of the Shoulders._


/Of/ those which the shoulders can perform, simple motions are the
principal, such as moving the arm upwards and downwards, backwards and
forwards.Though one might almost call those motions infinite, for if
the arm can trace a circle upon a wall, it will have performed all the
motions belonging to the shoulders.Every continued quantity being
divisible _ad infinitum_, and this circle being a continued quantity,
produced by the motion of the arm going through every part of the
circumference, it follows, that the motions of the shoulders may also be
said to be infinite._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.LXXXVIII./--_Of the Motions of a Man._


/When/ you mean to represent a man removing a weight, consider that the
motions are various, viz.either a simple motion, by bending himself
to raise the weight from the ground upwards, or when he drags the
weight after him, or pushes it before him, or pulls it down with a rope
passing through a pulley.It is to be observed, that the weight of the
man's body pulls the more in proportion as the centre of his gravity
is removed from the centre of his support.To this must be added the
strength of the effort that the legs and back make when they are bent,
to return to their natural straight situation.A man never ascends or descends, nor walks at all in any direction,
without raising the heel of the back foot.LXXXIX./--_Of the Disposition of Members preparing to act with
great Force_, Plate XIV./When/ a man prepares himself to strike a violent blow, he bends and
twists his body as far as he can to the side contrary to that which
he means to strike, and collecting all his strength, he, by a complex
motion, returns and falls upon the point he has in view[21].XC./--_Of throwing any Thing with Violence_, Plate XV./A man/ throwing a dart, a stone, or any thing else with violence,
may be represented, chiefly, two different ways; that is, he may be
preparing to do it, or the act may be already performed.If you mean to
place him in the act of preparation, the inside of the foot upon which
he rests will be under the perpendicular line of the pit of the neck;
and if it be the right foot, the left shoulder will be perpendicular
over the toes of the same foot.XCI./--_On the Motion of driving any Thing into or drawing it
out of the Ground._


/He/ who wishes to pitch a pole into the ground, or draw one out of it,
will raise the leg and bend the knee opposite to the arm which acts,
in order to balance himself upon the foot that rests, without which he
could neither drive in, nor pull out any thing.XCII./--_Of forcible Motions_, Plate XVI./Of/ the two arms, that will be most powerful in its effort, which,
having been farthest removed from its natural situation, is assisted
more strongly by the other parts to bring it to the place where it
means to go.As the man A, who moves the arm with a club E, and brings
it to the opposite side B, assisted by the motion of the whole body._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.XCIII./--_The Action of Jumping._


/Nature/ will of itself, and without any reasoning in the mind of a man
going to jump, prompt him to raise his arms and shoulders by a sudden
motion, together with a great part of his body, and to lift them up
high, till the power of the effort subsides.This impetuous motion
is accompanied by an instantaneous extension of the body which had
bent itself, like a spring or bow, along the back, the joints of the
thighs, knees, and feet, and is let off obliquely, that is, upwards
and forwards; so that the disposition of the body tending forwards
and upwards, makes it describe a great arch when it springs up, which
increases the leap.XCIV./--_Of the three Motions in jumping upwards._


/When/ a man jumps upwards, the motion of the head is three times
quicker than that of the heel, before the extremity of the foot quits
the ground, and twice as quick as that of the hips; because three
angles are opened and extended at the same time: the superior one is
that formed by the body at its joint with the thigh before, the second
is at the joint of the thighs and legs behind, and the third is at the
instep before[22].XCV./--_Of the easy Motions of Members._


/In/ regard to the freedom and ease of motions, it is very necessary
to observe, that when you mean to represent a figure which has to turn
itself a little round, the feet and all the other members are not to
move in the same direction as the head.But you will divide that motion
among four joints, viz.the feet, the knees, the hips, and the neck.If it rests upon the right leg, the left knee should be a little bent
inward, with its foot somewhat raised outward.The left shoulder should
be lower than the other, and the nape of the neck turned on the same
side as the outward ankle of the left foot, and the left shoulder
perpendicular over the great toe of the right foot.And take it as a
general maxim, that figures do not turn their heads straight with the
chest, Nature having for our convenience formed the neck so as to turn
with ease on every side, when the eyes want to look round; and to this
the other joints are in some measure subservient.If the figure be
sitting, and the arms have some employment across the body, the breast
will turn over the joint of the hip._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.XCVI./--_The greatest Twist which a Man can make, in turning to
look at himself behind._ Plate XVII./The/ greatest twist that the body can perform is when the back of
the heels and the front of the face are seen at the same time.It is
not done without difficulty, and is effected by bending the leg and
lowering the shoulder on that side towards which the head turns.The
cause of this motion, and also which of the muscles move first and
which last, I shall explain in my treatise on anatomy[23].XCVII./--_Of turning the Leg without the Thigh._


/It/ is impossible to turn the leg inwards or outwards without turning
the thigh by the same motion, because the setting in of the bones at
the knee is such, that they have no motion but backwards and forwards,
and no more than is necessary for walking or kneeling; never sideways,
because the form of the bones at the joint of the knee does not allow
it.If this joint had been made pliable on all sides, as that of the
shoulder, or that of the thigh bone with the hip, a man would have
had his legs bent on each side as often as backwards and forwards,
and seldom or never straight with the thigh.Besides, this joint can
bend only one way, so that in walking it can never go beyond the
straight line of the leg; it bends only forwards, for if it could bend
backwards, a man could never get up again upon his feet, if once he
were kneeling; as when he means to get up from the kneeling posture (on
both knees), he gives the whole weight of his body to one of the knees
to support, unloading the other, which at that time feels no other
weight than its own, and therefore is lifted up with ease, and rests
his foot flat upon the ground; then returning the whole weight upon
that foot, and leaning his hand upon his knee, he at once extends the
other arm, raises his head, and straightening the thigh with the body,
he springs up, and rests upon the same foot, while he brings up the
other.XCVIII./--_Postures of Figures._


/Figures/ that are set in a fixed attitude, are nevertheless to have
some contrast of parts.If one arm come before, the other remains
still or goes behind.If the figure rest upon one leg, the shoulder on
that side will be lower than the other.This is observed by artists
of judgment, who always take care to balance the figure well upon its
feet, for fear it should appear to fall.Because by resting upon one
foot, the other leg, being a little bent, does not support the body any
more than if it were dead; therefore it is necessary that the parts
above that leg should transfer the centre of their weight upon the leg
which supports the body.XCIX./--_Of the Gracefulness of the Members._


/The/ members are to be suited to the body in graceful motions,
expressive of the meaning which the figure is intended to convey.If it had to give the idea of genteel and agreeable carriage, the
members must be slender and well turned, but not lean; the muscles very
slightly marked, indicating in a soft manner such as must necessarily
appear; the arms, particularly, pliant, and no member in a straight
line with any other adjoining member.If it happen, on account of the
motion of the figure, that the right hip be higher than the left, make
the joint of the shoulder fall perpendicularly on the highest part of
that hip; and let that right shoulder be lower than the left.The pit
of the neck will always be perpendicular over the middle of the instep
of the foot that supports the body.The leg that does not bear will
have its knee a little lower than the other, and near the other leg.In regard to the positions of the head and arms, they are infinite, and
for that reason I shall not enter into any detailed rule concerning
them; suffice it to say, that they are to be easy and free, graceful,
and varied in their bendings, so that they may not appear stiff like
pieces of wood.C./--_That it is impossible for any Memory to retain the Aspects
and Changes of the Members._


/It/ is impossible that any memory can be able to retain all the
aspects or motions of any member of any animal whatever.This case
we shall exemplify by the appearance of the hand.And because any
continued quantity is divisible _ad infinitum_, the motion of the eye
which looks at the hand, and moves from A to B, moves by a space A B,
which is also a continued quantity, and consequently divisible _ad
infinitum_, and in every part of the motion varies to its view the
aspect and figure of the hand; and so it will do if it move round the
whole circle.The same will the hand do which is raised in its motion,
that is, it will pass over a space, which is a continued quantity[24].[Illustration]




/Chap.CI./--_The Motions of Figures._


/Never/ put the head straight upon the shoulders, but a little turned
sideways to the right or left, even though the figures should be
looking up or down, or straight, because it is necessary to give them
some motion of life and spirit.Nor ever compose a figure in such
a manner, either in a front or back view, as that every part falls
straight upon another from the top to the bottom.But if you wish to
introduce such a figure, use it for old age.Never repeat the same
motion of arms, or of legs, not only not in the same figure, but in
those which are standing by, or near; if the necessity of the case,
or the expression of the subject you represent, do not oblige you to
it[25].CII./--_Of common Motions._


/The/ variety of motions in man are equal to the variety of accidents
or thoughts affecting the mind, and each of these thoughts, or
accidents, will operate more or less, according to the temper and age
of the subject; for the same cause will in the actions of youth, or of
old age, produce very different effects.CIII./--_Of simple Motions._


/Simple/ motion is that which a man performs in merely bending
backwards or forwards.CIV./--_Complex Motion._


/Complex/ motion is that which, to produce some particular action,
requires the body to bend downwards and sideways at the same time.The
painter must be careful in his compositions to apply these complex
motions according to the nature of the subject, and not to weaken or
destroy the effect of it by introducing figures with simple motions,
without any connexion with the subject.CV./--_Motions appropriated to the Subject._


/The/ motions of your figures are to be expressive of the quantity of
strength requisite to the force of the action.Let not the same effort
be used to take up a stick as would easily raise a piece of timber.Therefore shew great variety in the expression of strength, according
to the quality of the load to be managed.CVI./--_Appropriate Motions._


/There/ are some emotions of the mind which are not expressed by any
particular motion of the body, while in others, the expression cannot
be shewn without it.In the first, the arms fall down, the hands and
all the other parts, which in general are the most active, remain at
rest.But such emotions of the soul as produce bodily action, must put
the members into such motions as are appropriated to the intention of
the mind.This, however, is an ample subject, and we have a great deal
to say upon it.There is a third kind of motion, which participates
of the two already described; and a fourth, which depends neither on
the one nor the other.This last belongs to insensibility, or fury,
and should be ranked with madness or stupidity; and so adapted only to
grotesque or Moresco work.CVII./--_Of the Postures of Women and young People._


/It/ is not becoming in women and young people to have their legs
too much asunder, because it denotes boldness; while the legs close
together shew modesty.CVIII./--_Of the Postures of Children._


/Children/ and old people are not to express quick motions, in what
concerns their legs.CIX./--_Of the Motion of the Members._


/Let/ every member be employed in performing its proper functions.For
instance, in a dead body, or one asleep, no member should appear alive
or awake.A foot bearing the weight of the whole body, should not be
playing its toes up and down, but flat upon the ground; except when it
rests entirely upon the heel.CX./--_Of mental Motions._


/A mere/ thought, or operation of the mind, excites only simple and
easy motions of the body; not this way, and that way, because its
object is in the mind, which does not affect the senses when it is
collected within itself.CXI./--_Effect of the Mind upon the Motions of the Body,
occasioned by some outward Object._


/When/ the motion is produced by the presence of some object, either
the cause is immediate or not.If it be immediate, the figure will
first turn towards it the organs most necessary, the eyes; leaving its
feet in the same place; and will only move the thighs, hips, and knees
a little towards the same side, to which the eyes are directed.CXII./--_Of those who apply themselves to the Practice, without
having learnt the Theory of the Art._


/Those/ who become enamoured of the practice of the art, without having
previously applied to the diligent study of the scientific part of it,
may be compared to mariners, who put to sea in a ship without rudder or
compass, and therefore cannot be certain of arriving at the wished-for
port.Practice must always be founded on good theory; to this, Perspective is
the guide and entrance, without which nothing can be well done.CXIII./--_Precepts in Painting._


/Perspective/ is to Painting what the bridle is to a horse, and the
rudder to a ship.The size of a figure should denote the distance at which it is situated.If a figure be seen of the natural size, remember that it denotes its
being near to the eye.CXIV./--_Of the Boundaries of Objects called Outlines or
Contours._


/The/ outlines or contours of bodies are so little perceivable, that
at any small distance between that and the object, the eye will not be
able to recognise the features of a friend or relation, if it were not
for their clothes and general appearance.So that by the knowledge of
the whole it comes to know the parts.CXV./--_Of linear Perspective._


/Linear/ Perspective consists in giving, by established rules, the true
dimensions of objects, according to their respective distances; so that
the second object be less than the first, the third than the second,
and by degrees at last they become invisible.I find by experience,
that, if the second object be at the same distance from the first, as
the first is from the eye, though they be of the same size, the second
will appear half the size of the first; and, if the third be at the
same distance behind the second, it will diminish two thirds; and so
on, by degrees, they will, at equal distances, diminish in proportion;
provided that the interval be not more than twenty cubits[26]; at
which distance it will lose two fourths of its size: at forty it will
diminish three fourths; and at sixty it will lose five sixths, and so
on progressively.But you must be distant from your picture twice the
size of it; for, if you be only once the size, it will make a great
difference in the measure from the first to the second.CXVI./--_What Parts of Objects disappear first by Distance._


/Those/ parts which are of less magnitude will first vanish from the
sight[27].This happens, because the shape of small objects, at an
equal distance, comes to the eye under a more acute angle than the
large ones, and the perception of them is less, in proportion as they
are less in magnitude.It follows then, that if the large objects, by
being removed to a great distance, and consequently coming to the eye
by a small angle, are almost lost to the sight, the small objects will
entirely disappear.CXVII./--_Of remote Objects._


/The/ outlines of objects will be less seen, in proportion as they are
more distant from the eye.CXVIII./--_Of the Point of Sight._


/The/ point of sight must be on a level with the eyes of a common-sized
man, and placed upon the horizon, which is the line formed by a flat
country terminating with the sky.An exception must be made as to
mountains, which are above that line.CXIX./--_A Picture is to be viewed from one Point only._


/This/ will be proved by one single example.If you mean to represent
a round ball very high up, on a flat and perpendicular wall, it will
be necessary to make it oblong, like the shape of an egg, and to place
yourself (that is, the eye, or point of view) so far back, as that its
outline or circumference may appear round.CXX./--_Of the Dimensions of the first Figure in an historical
Painting._


/The/ first figure in your picture will be less than Nature, in
proportion as it recedes from the front of the picture, or the bottom
line; and by the same rule the others behind it will go on lessening in
an equal degree[28].CXXI./--_Of Objects that are lost to the Sight in Proportion to
their Distance._


/The/ first things that disappear, by being removed to some distance,
are the outlines or boundaries of objects.The second, as they remove
farther, are the shadows which divide contiguous bodies.The third
are the thickness of legs and feet; and so in succession the small
parts are lost to the sight, till nothing remains but a confused mass,
without any distinct parts.CXXII./--_Errors not so easily seen in small Objects as in large
ones._


/Supposing/ this small object to represent a man, or any other animal,
although the parts, by being so much diminished or reduced, cannot be
executed with the same exactness of proportion, nor finished with the
same accuracy, as if on a larger scale, yet on that very account the
faults will be less conspicuous.For example, if you look at a man at
the distance of two hundred yards, and with all due attention mean to
form a judgment, whether he be handsome or ugly, deformed or well made,
you will find that, with all your endeavours, you can hardly venture
to decide.The reason is, that the man diminishes so much by the
distance, that it is impossible to distinguish the parts minutely.If
you wish to know by demonstration the diminution of the above figure,
hold your finger up before your eye at about nine inches distance, so
that the top of your finger corresponds with the top of the head of
the distant figure: you will perceive that your finger covers, not
only its head, but part of its body; which is an evident proof of the
apparent diminution of that object.Hence it often happens, that we are
doubtful, and can scarcely, at some distance, distinguish the form of
even a friend.CXXIII./--_Historical Subjects one above another on the same
Wall to be avoided._


/This/ custom, which has been generally adopted by painters, on the
front and sides of chapels, is much to be condemned.They begin with an
historical picture, its landscape and buildings, in one compartment.After which, they raise another compartment, and execute another
history with other buildings upon another level; and from thence they
proceed to a third and fourth, varying the point of sight, as if the
beholder was going up steps, while, in fact, he must look at them all
from below, which is very ill judged in those matters.We know that the point of sight is the eye of the spectator; and if
you ask, how is a series of subjects, such as the life of a saint, to
be represented, in different compartments on the same wall?I answer,
that you are to place the principal event in the largest compartment,
and make the point of sight as high as the eye of the spectator.Begin
that subject with large figures; and as you go up, lessen the objects,
as well the figures, as buildings, varying the plans according to the
effect of perspective; but never varying the point of sight: and so
complete the series of subjects, till you come to a certain height,
where terrestrial objects can be seen no more, except the tops of
trees, or clouds and birds; or if you introduce figures, they must be
aerial, such as angels, or saints in glory, or the like, if they suit
the purpose of your history.If not, do not undertake this kind of
painting, for your work will be faulty, and justly reprehensible[29].CXXIV./--_Why Objects in Painting can never detach, as natural
Objects do._


/Painters/ often despair of being able to imitate Nature, from
observing, that their pictures have not the same relief, nor the same
life, as natural objects have in a looking-glass, though they both
appear upon a plain surface.They say, they have colours which surpass
in brightness the quality of the lights, and in darkness the quality of
the shades of the objects seen in the looking-glass; but attribute this
circumstance to their own ignorance, and not to the true cause, because
they do not know it.It is impossible that objects in painting should
appear with the same relief as those in the looking-glass, unless we
look at them with only one eye.The two eyes A B looking at objects one behind
another, as M and N, see them both; because M cannot entirely occupy
the space of N, by reason that the base of the visual rays is so broad,
that the second object is seen behind the first.But if one eye be
shut, and you look with the other S, the body F will entirely cover
the body R, because the visual rays beginning at one point, form a
triangle, of which the body F is the base, and being prolonged, they
form two diverging tangents at the two extremities of F, which cannot
touch the body R behind it, therefore can never see it[30].[Illustration]




/Chap.CXXV./--_How to give the proper Dimension to Objects in
Painting._


[Illustration]

/In/ order to give the appearance of the natural size, if the piece
be small (as miniatures), the figures on the fore-ground are to be
finished with as much precision as those of any large painting, because
being small they are to be brought up close to the eye.But large
paintings are seen at some distance; whence it happens, that though
the figures in each are so different in size, in appearance they will
be the same.This proceeds from the eye receiving those objects under
the same angle; and it is proved thus.Let the large painting be B C,
the eye A, and D E a pane of glass, through which are seen the figures
situated at B C. I say that the eye being fixed, the figures in the
copy of the paintings B C are to be smaller, in proportion as the glass
D E is nearer the eye A, and are to be as precise and finished.But if
you will execute the picture B C upon the glass D E, this ought to be
less finished than the picture B C, and more so than the figure M N
transferred upon the glass F G; because, supposing the figure P O to
be as much finished as the natural one in B C, the perspective of O P
would be false, since, though in regard to the diminution of the figure
it would be right, B C being diminished in P O, the finishing would not
agree with the distance, because in giving it the perfection of the
natural B C, B C would appear as near as O P; but, if you search for
the diminution of O P, O P will be found at the distance B C, and the
diminution of the finishing as at F G.CXXVI./--_How to draw accurately any particular Spot._


/Take/ a glass as large as your paper, fasten it well between your eye
and the object you mean to draw, and fixing your head in a frame (in
such a manner as not to be able to move it) at the distance of two
feet from the glass; shut one eye, and draw with a pencil accurately
upon the glass all that you see through it.After that, trace upon
paper what you have drawn on the glass, which tracing you may paint at
pleasure, observing the aerial perspective.CXXVII./--_Disproportion to be avoided, even in the accessory
Parts._


/A great/ fault is committed by many painters, which is highly to be
blamed, that is, to represent the habitations of men, and other parts
of their compositions, so low, that the doors do not reach as high as
the knees of their inhabitants, though, according to their situation,
they are nearer to the eye of the spectator, than the men who seem
willing to enter them.I have seen some pictures with porticos,
supported by columns loaded with figures; one grasping a column against
which it leans, as if it were a walking-stick, and other similar
errors, which are to be avoided with the greatest care.INVENTION, /or/ COMPOSITION.CXXVIII./--_Precept for avoiding a bad Choice in the Style or
Proportion of Figures._


/The/ painter ought to form his style upon the most proportionate
model in Nature; and after having measured that, he ought to measure
himself also, and be perfectly acquainted with his own defects or
deficiencies; and having acquired this knowledge, his constant care
should be to avoid conveying into his work those defects which he has
found in his own person; for these defects, becoming habitual to his
observation, mislead his judgment, and he perceives them no longer.We
ought, therefore, to struggle against such a prejudice, which grows
up with us; for the mind, being fond of its own habitation, is apt to
represent it to our imagination as beautiful.From the same motive it
may be, that there is not a woman, however plain in her person, who may
not find her admirer, if she be not a monster.Against this bent of the
mind you ought very cautiously to be on your guard.CXXIX./--_Variety in Figures._


/A painter/ ought to aim at universal excellence; for he will be
greatly wanting in dignity, if he do one thing well and another badly,
as many do, who study only the naked figure, measured and proportioned
by a pair of compasses in their hands, and do not seek for variety.A
man may be well proportioned, and yet be tall or short, large or lean,
or of a middle size; and whoever does not make great use of these
varieties, which are all existing in Nature in its most perfect state,
will produce figures as if cast in one and the same mould, which is
highly reprehensible.CXXX./--_How a Painter ought to proceed in his Studies._


/The/ painter ought always to form in his mind a kind of system of
reasoning or discussion within himself on any remarkable object
before him.He should stop, take notes, and form some rule upon it;
considering the place, the circumstances, the lights and shadows.CXXXI./--_Of sketching Histories and Figures._


/Sketches/ of historical subjects must be slight, attending only to the
situation of the figures, without regard to the finishing of particular
members, which may be done afterwards at leisure, when the mind is so
disposed.CXXXII./--_How to study Composition._


/The/ young student should begin by sketching slightly some single
figure, and turn that on all sides, knowing already how to contract,
and how to extend the members; after which, he may put two together in
various attitudes, we will suppose in the act of fighting boldly.This
composition also he must try on all sides, and in a variety of ways,
tending to the same expression.Then he may imagine one of them very
courageous, while the other is a coward.Let these attitudes, and many
other accidental affections of the mind, be with great care studied,
examined, and dwelt upon.CXXXIII./--_Of the Attitudes of Men._


/The/ attitudes and all the members are to be disposed in such
a manner, that by them the intentions of the mind may be easily
discovered.CXXXIV./--_Variety of Positions._


/The/ positions of the human figure are to be adapted to the age and
rank; and to be varied according to the difference of the sexes, men or
women.CXXXV./--_Of Studies from Nature for History._


/It/ is necessary to consider well the situation for which the history
is to be painted, particularly the height; and let the painter place
accordingly the model, from which he means to make his studies for that
historical picture; and set himself as much below the object, as the
picture is to be above the eye of the spectator, otherwise the work
will be faulty.CXXXVI./--_Of the Variety of Figures in History Painting._


/History/ painting must exhibit variety in its fullest extent.In
temper, size, complexion, actions, plumpness, leanness, thick, thin,
large, small, rough, smooth, old age and youth, strong and muscular,
weak, with little appearance of muscles, cheerfulness and melancholy.Some should be with curled hair, and some with straight; some short,
some long, some quick in their motions, and some slow, with a variety
of dresses and colours, according as the subject may require.CXXXVII./--_Of Variety in History._


/A painter/ should delight in introducing great variety into his
compositions, avoiding repetition, that by this fertility of invention
he may attract and charm the eye of the beholder.If it be requisite
according to the subject meant to be represented, that there should be
a mixture of men differing in their faces, ages, and dress, grouped
with women, children, dogs, and horses, buildings, hills and flat
country; observe dignity and decorum in the principal figure; such
as a king, magistrate, or philosopher, separating them from the low
classes of the people.Mix not afflicted or weeping figures with joyful
and laughing ones; for Nature dictates that the cheerful be attended
by others of the same disposition of mind.Laughter is productive of
laughter, and _vice versa_.CXXXVIII./--_Of the Age of Figures._


/Do/ not bring together a number of boys with as many old men, nor
young men with infants, nor women with men; if the subject you mean to
represent does not oblige you to it.CXXXIX./--_Of Variety of Faces._


/The/ Italian painters have been accused of a common fault, that is,
of introducing into their compositions the faces, and even the whole
figures, of Roman emperors, which they take from the antique.To
avoid such an error, let no repetition take place, either in parts,
or the whole of a figure; nor let there be even the same face in
another composition: and the more the figures are contrasted, viz.the
deformed opposed to the beautiful, the old to the young, the strong
to the feeble, the more the picture will please and be admired.These
different characters, contrasted with each other, will increase the
beauty of the whole.It frequently happens that a painter, while he is composing, will use
any little sketch or scrap of drawing he has by him, and endeavour to
make it serve his purpose; but this is extremely injudicious, because
he may very often find that the members he has drawn have not the
motion suited to what he means to express; and after he has adopted,
accurately drawn, and even well finished them, he will be loth to rub
out and change them for others.CXL./--_A Fault in Painters._


/It/ is a very great fault in a painter to repeat the same motions in
figures, and the same folds in draperies in the same composition, as
also to make all the faces alike.CXLI./--_How you may learn to compose Groups for History
Painting._


/When/ you are well instructed in perspective, and know perfectly how
to draw the anatomy and forms of different bodies or objects, it should
be your delight to observe and consider in your walks the different
actions of men, when they are talking, or quarrelling; when they laugh,
and when they fight.Attend to their positions, and to those of the
spectators; whether they are attempting to separate those who fight,
or merely lookers-on.Be quick in sketching these with slight strokes
in your pocket-book, which should always be about you, and made of
stained paper, as you ought not to rub out.When it is full, take
another, for these are not things to be rubbed out, but kept with the
greatest care; because forms and motions of bodies are so infinitely
various, that the memory is not able to retain them; therefore preserve
these sketches as your assistants and masters.CXLII./--_How to study the Motions of the human Body._


/The/ first requisite towards a perfect acquaintance with the various
motions of the human body, is the knowledge of all the parts,
particularly the joints, in all the attitudes in which it may be
placed.Then make slight sketches in your pocket-book, as opportunities
occur, of the actions of men, as they happen to meet your eye, without
being perceived by them; because, if they were to observe you, they
would be disturbed from that freedom of action, which is prompted by
inward feeling; as when two men are quarrelling and angry, each of
them seeming to be in the right, and with great vehemence move their
eyebrows, arms, and all the other members, using motions appropriated
to their words and feelings.This they could not do, if you wanted them
to imitate anger, or any other accidental emotion; such as laughter,
weeping, pain, admiration, fear, and the like.For that reason, take
care never to be without a little book, for the purpose of sketching
those various motions, and also groups of people standing by.This
will teach you how to compose history.Two things demand the principal
attention of a good painter.One is the exact outline and shape of the
figure; the other, the true expression of what passes in the mind of
that figure, which he must feel, and that is very important.CXLIII./--_Of Dresses, and of Draperies and Folds._


/The/ draperies with which you dress figures ought to have their
folds so accommodated as to surround the parts they are intended to
cover; that in the mass of light there be not any dark fold, and in
the mass of shadows none receiving too great a light.They must go
gently over, describing the parts; but not with lines across, cutting
the members with hard notches, deeper than the part can possibly
be; at the same time, it must fit the body, and not appear like an
empty bundle of cloth; a fault of many painters, who, enamoured of
the quantity and variety of folds, have encumbered their figures,
forgetting the intention of clothes, which is to dress and surround the
parts gracefully wherever they touch; and not to be filled with wind,
like bladders, puffed up where the parts project.I do not deny that
we ought not to neglect introducing some handsome folds among these
draperies, but it must be done with great judgment, and suited to the
parts, where, by the actions of the limbs and position of the whole
body, they gather together.Above all, be careful to vary the quality
and quantity of your folds in compositions of many figures; so that,
if some have large folds, produced by thick woollen cloth; others,
being dressed in thinner stuff, may have them narrower; some sharp and
straight, others soft and undulating.CXLIV./--_Of the Nature of Folds in Draperies._


/Many/ painters prefer making the folds of their draperies with acute
angles, deep and precise; others with angles hardly perceptible; and
some with none at all; but instead of them, certain curved lines.CXLV./--_How the Folds of Draperies ought to be represented_,
Plate XVIII./That/ part of the drapery, which is the farthest from the place where
it is gathered, will appear more approaching its natural state.Every
thing naturally inclines to preserve its primitive form.Therefore a
stuff or cloth, which is of equal thickness on both sides, will always
incline to remain flat.For that reason, when it is constrained by some
fold to relinquish its flat situation, it is observed that, at the part
of its greatest restraint, it is continually making efforts to return
to its natural shape; and the parts most distant from it reassume more
of their primitive state by ample and distended folds.For example, let
A B C be the drapery mentioned above; A B the place where it is folded
or restrained.I have said that the part, which is farthest from the
place of its restraint, would return more towards its primitive shape.Therefore C being the farthest, will be broader and more extended than
any other part._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.CXLVI./--_How the Folds in Draperies ought to be made._


/Draperies/ are not to be encumbered with many folds: on the contrary,
there ought to be some only where they are held up with the hands or
arms of the figures, and the rest left to fall with natural simplicity.They ought to be studied from Nature; that is to say, if a woollen
cloth be intended, the folds ought to be drawn after such cloth; if it
be of silk, or thin stuff, or else very thick for labourers, let it
be distinguished by the nature of the folds.But never copy them, as
some do, after models dressed in paper, or thin leather, for it greatly
misleads.CXLVII./--_Fore-shortening of Folds_, Plate XIX./Where/ the figure is fore-shortened, there ought to appear a greater
number of folds, than on the other parts, all surrounding it in a
circular manner.M N will have the
middle of every circular fold successively removed farther from its
outline, in proportion as it is more distant from the eye.In M O of
the other figure the outlines of these circular folds will appear
almost straight, because it is situated opposite the eye; but in P and
Q quite the contrary, as in N and M.CXLVIII./--_Of Folds._


/The/ folds of draperies, whatever be the motion of the figure, ought
always to shew, by the form of their outlines, the attitude of such
figure; so as to leave, in the mind of the beholder, no doubt or
confusion in regard to the true position of the body; and let there be
no fold, which, by its shadow, breaks through any of the members; that
is to say, appearing to go in deeper than the surface of the part it
covers.And if you represent the figure clothed with several garments,
one over the other, let it not appear as if the upper one covered only
a mere skeleton; but let it express that it is also well furnished with
flesh, and a thickness of folds, suitable to the number of its under
garments.The folds surrounding the members ought to diminish in thickness near
the extremities of the part they surround.The length of the folds, which are close to the members, ought to
produce other folds on that side where the member is diminished by
fore-shortening, and be more extended on the opposite side.CXLIX./--_Of Decorum._


/Observe/ decorum in every thing you represent, that is, fitness of
action, dress, and situation, according to the dignity or meanness of
the subject to be represented.Be careful that a king, for instance,
be grave and majestic in his countenance and dress; that the place be
well decorated; and that his attendants, or the by-standers, express
reverence and admiration, and appear as noble, in dresses suitable to a
royal court.On the contrary, in the representation of a mean subject, let the
figures appear low and despicable; those about them with similar
countenances, and actions, denoting base and presumptuous minds, and
meanly clad.In short, in both cases, the parts must correspond with
the general sentiment of the composition.The motions of old age should not be similar to those of youth; those
of a woman to those of a man; nor should the latter be the same as
those of a boy.CL./--_The Character of Figures in Composition._


/In/ general, the painter ought to introduce very few old men, in the
ordinary course of historical subjects, and those few separated from
young people; because old people are few, and their habits do not agree
with those of youth.Where there is no conformity of custom, there can
be no intimacy, and, without it, a company is soon separated.But if
the subject require an appearance of gravity, a meeting on important
business, as a council, for instance, let there be few young men
introduced, for youth willingly avoids such meetings.CLI./--_The Motion of the Muscles, when the Figures are in
natural Positions._


/A figure/, which does not express by its position the sentiments and
passions, by which we suppose it animated, will appear to indicate
that its muscles are not obedient to its will, and the painter very
deficient in judgment.For that reason, a figure is to shew great
eagerness and meaning; and its position is to be so well appropriated
to that meaning, that it cannot be mistaken, nor made use of for any
other.CLII./--_A Precept in Painting._


/The/ painter ought to notice those quick motions, which men are apt to
make without thinking, when impelled by strong and powerful affections
of the mind.He ought to take memorandums of them, and sketch them in
his pocket-book, in order to make use of them when they may answer his
purpose; and then to put a living model in the same position, to see
the quality and aspect of the muscles which are in action.CLIII./--_Of the Motion of Man_, Plates XX./The/ first and principal part of the art is composition of any sort,
or putting things together.The second relates to the expression and
motion of the figures, and requires that they be well appropriated,
and seeming attentive to what they are about; appearing to move with
alacrity and spirit, according to the degree of expression suitable
to the occasion; expressing slow and tardy motions, as well as those
of eagerness in pursuit: and that quickness and ferocity be expressed
with such force as to give an idea of the sensations of the actors.When a figure is to throw a dart, stones, or the like, let it be
seen evidently by the attitude and disposition of all the members,
that such is its intention; of which there are two examples in the
opposite plates, varied both in action and power.The first in point
of vigour is A. The second is B. But A will throw his weapon farther
than B, because, though they seem desirous of throwing it to the same
point, A having turned his feet towards the object, while his body is
twisted and bent back the contrary way, to increase his power, returns
with more velocity and force to the point to which he means to throw.But the figure B having turned his feet the same way as his body,
it returns to its place with great inconvenience, and consequently
with weakened powers.For in the expression of great efforts, the
preparatory motions of the body must be strong and violent, twisting
and bending, so that it may return with convenient ease, and by that
means have a great effect.In the same manner, if a cross-bow be not
strung with force, the motion of whatever it shoots will be short and
without effect; because, where there is no impulse, there can be no
motion; and if the impulse be not violent, the motion is but tardy
and feeble.So a bow, which is not strong, has no motion; and, if it
be strung, it will remain in that state till the impulse be given
by another power which puts it in motion, and it will shoot with a
violence equal to that which was employed in bending it.In the same
manner, the man who does not twist and bend his body will have acquired
no power.Therefore, after A has thrown his dart, he will find himself
twisted the contrary way, viz.on the side where he has thrown; and
he will have acquired only power sufficient to serve him to return to
where he was at first._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.CLIV./--_Of Attitudes, and the Motions of the Members._


/The/ same attitude is not to be repeated in the same picture, nor the
same motion of members in the same figure, nay, not even in the hands
or fingers.And if the history requires a great number of figures, such
as a battle, or a massacre of soldiers, in which there are but three
ways of striking, viz.thrusting, cutting, or back-handed; in that
case you must take care, that all those who are cutting be expressed
in different views; some turning their backs, some their sides, and
others be seen in front; varying in the same manner the three different
ways of fighting, so that all the actions may have a relation to those
three principles.In battles, complex motions display great art, giving
spirit and animation to the whole.By complex motion is meant, for
instance, that of a single figure shewing the front of the legs, and at
the same time the profile of the shoulder.But of this I shall treat in
another place[31].CLV./--_Of a single Figure separate from an historical Group._


/The/ same motion of members should not be repeated in a figure which
you mean to be alone; for instance, if the figure be represented
running, it must not throw both hands forward; but one forward and the
other backward, or else it cannot run.If the right foot come forward,
the right arm must go backward and the left forward, because, without
such disposition and contraste of parts, it is impossible to run well.If another figure be supposed to follow this, one of its legs should
be brought somewhat forward, and the other be perpendicular under the
head; the arm on the same side should pass forward.But of this we
shall treat more fully in the book on motion[32].CLVI./--_On the Attitudes of the human Figure._


/A painter/ is to be attentive to the motions and actions of men,
occasioned by some sudden accident.He must observe them on the spot,
take sketches, and not wait till he wants such expression, and then
have it counterfeited for him; for instance, setting a model to weep
when there is no cause; such an expression without a cause will be
neither quick nor natural.But it will be of great use to have observed
every action from nature, as it occurs, and then to have a model set in
the same attitude to help the recollection, and find out something to
the purpose, according to the subject in hand.CLVII./--_How to represent a Storm._


/To/ form a just idea of a storm, you must consider it attentively in
its effects.When the wind blows violently over the sea or land, it
removes and carries off with it every thing that is not firmly fixed
to the general mass.The clouds must appear straggling and broken,
carried according to the direction and the force of the wind, and
blended with clouds of dust raised from the sandy shore.Branches and
leaves of trees must be represented as carried along by the violence
of the storm, and, together with numberless other light substances,
scattered in the air.Trees and grass must be bent to the ground, as if
yielding to the course of the wind.Boughs must be twisted out of their
natural form, with their leaves reversed and entangled.Of the figures
dispersed in the picture, some should appear thrown on the ground, so
wrapped up in their cloaks and covered with dust, as to be scarcely
distinguishable.Of those who remain on their feet, some should be
sheltered by and holding fast behind some great trees, to avoid the
same fate: others bending to the ground, their hands over their faces
to ward off the dust; their hair and their clothes flying straight up
at the mercy of the wind.The high tremendous waves of the stormy sea will be covered with
foaming froth; the most subtle parts of which, being raised by the
wind, like a thick mist, mix with the air.What vessels are seen should
appear with broken cordage, and torn sails, fluttering in the wind;
some with broken masts fallen across the hulk, already on its side
amidst the tempestuous waves.Some of the crew should be represented as
if crying aloud for help, and clinging to the remains of the shattered
vessel.Let the clouds appear as driven by tempestuous winds against
the summits of lofty mountains, enveloping those mountains, and
breaking and recoiling with redoubled force, like waves against a rocky
shore.The air should be rendered awfully dark, by the mist, dust, and
thick clouds.CLVIII./--_How to compose a Battle._


/First/, let the air exhibit a confused mixture of smoke, arising from
the discharge of artillery and musquetry, and the dust raised by the
horses of the combatants; and observe, that dust being of an earthy
nature, is heavy; but yet, by reason of its minute particles, it is
easily impelled upwards, and mixes with the air; nevertheless, it
naturally falls downwards again, the most subtle parts of it alone
gaining any considerable degree of elevation, and at its utmost height
it is so thin and transparent, as to appear nearly of the colour of
the air.The smoke, thus mixing with the dusty air, forms a kind of
dark cloud, at the top of which it is distinguished from the dust by a
blueish cast, the dust retaining more of its natural colour.On that
part from which the light proceeds, this mixture of air, smoke, and
dust, will appear much brighter than on the opposite side.The more the
combatants are involved in this turbulent mist, the less distinctly
they will be seen, and the more confused will they be in their lights
and shades.Let the faces of the musketeers, their bodies, and every
object near them, be tinged with a reddish hue, even the air or cloud
of dust; in short, all that surrounds them.This red tinge you will
diminish, in proportion to their distance, from the primary cause.The
groups of figures, which appear at a distance between the spectator
and the light, will form a dark mass upon a light ground; and their
legs will be more undetermined and lost as they approach nearer to the
ground; because there the dust is heavier and thicker.If you mean to represent some straggling horses, running out of the
main body, introduce also some small clouds of dust, as far distant
from each other as the leap of the horse, and these little clouds will
become fainter, more scanty, and diffused, in proportion to their
distance from the horse.That nearest to his feet will consequently be
the most determined, smallest, and the thickest of all.Let the air be full of arrows, in all directions; some ascending, some
falling down, and some darting straight forwards.The bullets of the
musketry, though not seen, will be marked in their course by a train
of smoke, which breaks through the general confusion.The figures in
the fore-ground should have their hair covered with dust, as also their
eyebrows, and all parts liable to receive it.The victorious party will be running forwards, their hair and other
light parts flying in the wind, their eyebrows lowered, and the motion
of every member properly contrasted; for instance, in moving the right
foot forwards, the left arm must be brought forwards also.If you make
any of them fallen down, mark the trace of his fall on the slippery,
gore-stained dust; and where the ground is less impregnated with blood,
let the print of men's feet and of horses, that have passed that
way, be marked.Let there be some horses dragging the bodies of their
riders, and leaving behind them a furrow, made by the body thus trailed
along.The countenances of the vanquished will appear pale and dejected.Their
eyebrows raised, and much wrinkled about the forehead and cheeks.The tip of their noses somewhat divided from the nostrils by arched
wrinkles terminating at the corner of the eyes, those wrinkles being
occasioned by the opening and raising of the nostrils; the upper
lips turned up, discovering the teeth.Their mouths wide open, and
expressive of violent lamentation.One may be seen fallen wounded
on the ground, endeavouring with one hand to support his body, and
covering his eyes with the other, the palm of which is turned towards
the enemy.Others running away, and with open mouths seeming to cry
aloud.Between the legs of the combatants let the ground be strewed
with all sorts of arms; as broken shields, spears, swords, and the
like.Many dead bodies should be introduced, some entirely covered
with dust, others in part only; let the blood, which seems to issue
immediately from the wound, appear of its natural colour, and running
in a winding course, till, mixing with the dust, it forms a reddish
kind of mud.Some should be in the agonies of death; their teeth shut,
their eyes wildly staring, their fists clenched, and their legs in a
distorted position.Some may appear disarmed, and beaten down by the
enemy, still fighting with their fists and teeth, and endeavouring
to take a passionate, though unavailing revenge.There may be also a
straggling horse without a rider, running in wild disorder; his mane
flying in the wind, beating down with his feet all before him, and
doing a deal of damage.A wounded soldier may also be seen falling to
the ground, and attempting to cover himself with his shield, while an
enemy bending over him endeavours to give him the finishing stroke.Several dead bodies should be heaped together under a dead horse.Some
of the conquerors, as having ceased fighting, may be wiping their faces
from the dirt, collected on them by the mixture of dust with the water
from their eyes.The _corps de reserve_ will be seen advancing gaily, but cautiously,
their eyebrows directed forwards, shading their eyes with their hands
to observe the motions of the enemy, amidst clouds of dust and smoke,
and seeming attentive to the orders of their chief.You may also make
their commander holding up his staff, pushing forwards, and pointing
towards the place where they are wanted.A river may likewise be
introduced, with horses fording it, dashing the water about between
their legs, and in the air, covering all the adjacent ground with water
and foam.Not a spot is to be left without some marks of blood and
carnage.CLIX./--_The Representation of an Orator and his Audience._


/If/ you have to represent a man who is speaking to a large assembly of
people, you are to consider the subject matter of his discourse, and
to adapt his attitude to such subject.If he means to persuade, let it
be known by his gesture.If he is giving an explanation, deduced from
several reasons, let him put two fingers of the right hand within one
of the left, having the other two bent close, his face turned towards
the audience, with the mouth half open, seeming to speak.If he is
sitting, let him appear as going to raise himself up a little, and his
head be forward.But if he is represented standing, let him bend his
chest and his head forward towards the people.The auditory are to appear silent and attentive, with their eyes upon
the speaker, in the act of admiration.There should be some old men,
with their mouths close shut, in token of approbation, and their lips
pressed together, so as to form wrinkles at the corners of the mouth,
and about the cheeks, and forming others about the forehead, by raising
the eyebrows, as if struck with astonishment.Some others of those
sitting by, should be seated with their hands within each other, round
one of their knees; some with one knee upon the other, and upon that,
one hand receiving the elbow, the other supporting the chin, covered
with a venerable beard.CLX./--_Of demonstrative Gestures._


/The/ action by which a figure points at any thing near, either in
regard to time or situation, is to be expressed by the hand very little
removed from the body.But if the same thing is far distant, the hand
must also be far removed from the body, and the face of the figure
pointing, must be turned towards those to whom he is pointing it out.CLXI./--_Of the Attitudes of the By-standers at some remarkable
Event._


/All/ those who are present at some event deserving notice, express
their admiration, but in various manners.As when the hand of justice
punishes some malefactor.If the subject be an act of devotion, the
eyes of all present should be directed towards the object of their
adoration, aided by a variety of pious actions with the other members;
as at the elevation of the host at mass, and other similar ceremonies.If it be a laughable subject, or one exciting compassion and moving to
tears, in those cases it will not be necessary for all to have their
eyes turned towards the object, but they will express their feelings
by different actions; and let there be several assembled in groups, to
rejoice or lament together.If the event be terrific, let the faces of
those who run away from the fight, be strongly expressive of fright,
with various motions; as shall be described in the tract on Motion.CLXII./--_How to represent Night._


/Those/ objects which are entirely deprived of light, are lost to the
sight, as in the night; therefore if you mean to paint a history under
those circumstances, you must suppose a large fire, and those objects
that are near it to be tinged with its colour, and the nearer they are
the more they will partake of it.The fire being red, all those objects
which receive light from it will appear of a reddish colour, and
those that are most distant from it will partake of the darkness that
surrounds them.The figures which are represented before the fire will
appear dark in proportion to the brightness of the fire, because those
parts of them which we see, are tinged by that darkness of the night,
and not by the light of the fire, which they intercept.Those that are
on either side of the fire, will be half in the shade of night, and
half in the red light.Those seen beyond the extent of the flames,
will be all of a reddish light upon a black ground.In regard to their
attitudes, let those who are nearest the fire, make screens of their
hands and cloaks, against the scorching heat, with their faces turned
on the contrary side, as if ready to run away from it.The most remote
will only be shading their eyes with their hands, as if hurt by the too
great glare.CLXIII./--_The Method of awakening the Mind to a Variety of
Inventions._


/I will/ not omit to introduce among these precepts a new kind of
speculative invention, which though apparently trifling, and almost
laughable, is nevertheless of great utility in assisting the genius to
find variety for composition.By looking attentively at old and smeared walls, or stones and veined
marble of various colours, you may fancy that you see in them several
compositions, landscapes, battles, figures in quick motion, strange
countenances, and dresses, with an infinity of other objects.By these
confused lines the inventive genius is excited to new exertions.CLXIV./--_Of Composition in History._


/When/ the painter has only a single figure to represent, he must avoid
any shortening whatever, as well of any particular member, as of the
whole figure, because he would have to contend with the prejudices of
those who have no knowledge in that branch of the art.But in subjects
of history, composed of many figures, shortenings may be introduced
with great propriety, nay, they are indispensable, and ought to be used
without reserve, as the subject may require; particularly in battles,
where of course many shortenings and contortions of figures happen,
amongst such an enraged multitude of actors, possessed, as it were, of
a brutal madness.EXPRESSION /and/ CHARACTER.CLXV./--_Of expressive Motions._


/Let/ your figures have actions appropriated to what they are intended
to think or say, and these will be well learnt by imitating the deaf,
who by the motion of their hands, eyes, eyebrows, and the whole body,
endeavour to express the sentiments of their mind.Do not ridicule the
thought of a master without a tongue teaching you an art he does not
understand; he will do it better by his expressive motions, than all
the rest by their words and examples.Let then the painter, of whatever
school, attend well to this maxim, and apply it to the different
qualities of the figures he represents, and to the nature of the
subject in which they are actors.CLXVI./--_How to paint Children._


/Children/ are to be represented with quick and contorted motions,
when they are sitting; but when standing, with fearful and timid
motions.CLXVII./--_How to represent old Men._


/Old/ men must have slow and heavy motions; their legs and knees must
be bent when they are standing, and their feet placed parallel and wide
asunder.Let them be bowed downwards, the head leaning much forward,
and their arms very little extended.CLXVIII./--_How to paint old Women._


/Old/ women, on the contrary, are to be represented bold and quick,
with passionate motions, like furies[33].But the motions are to appear
a great deal quicker in their arms than in their legs.CLXIX./--_How to paint Women._


/Women/ are to be represented in modest and reserved attitudes, with
their knees rather close, their arms drawing near each other, or folded
about the body; their heads looking downwards, and leaning a little on
one side.CLXX./--_Of the Variety of Faces._


/The/ countenances of your figures should be expressive of their
different situations: men at work, at rest, weeping, laughing, crying
out, in fear, or joy, and the like.The attitudes also, and all the
members, ought to correspond with the sentiment expressed in the faces.CLXXI./--_The Parts of the Face, and their Motions._


/The/ motions of the different parts of the face, occasioned by sudden
agitations of the mind, are many.The principal of these are, Laughter,
Weeping, Calling out, Singing, either in a high or low pitch,
Admiration, Anger, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Pain, and others, of which
I propose to treat.First, of Laughing and Weeping, which are very
similar in the motion of the mouth, the cheeks, the shutting of the
eyebrows, and the space between them; as we shall explain in its place,
in treating of the changes which happen in the face, hands, fingers,
and all the other parts of the body, as they are affected by the
different emotions of the soul; the knowledge of which is absolutely
necessary to a painter, or else his figures may be said to be twice
dead.But it is very necessary also that he be careful not to fall into
the contrary extreme; giving extraordinary motions to his figures, so
that in a quiet and peaceable subject, he does not seem to represent a
battle, or the revellings of drunken men: but, above all, the actors in
any point of history must be attentive to what they are about, or to
what is going forward; with actions that denote admiration, respect,
pain, suspicion, fear, and joy, according as the occasion, for which
they are brought together, may require.Endeavour that different points
of history be not placed one above the other on the same canvass, nor
walls with different horizons[34], as if it were a jeweller's shop,
shewing the goods in different square caskets.CLXXII./--_Laughing and Weeping._


/Between/ the expression of laughter and that of weeping there is no
difference in the motion of the features either in the eyes, mouth,
or cheeks; only in the ruffling of the brows, which is added when
weeping, but more elevated and extended in laughing.One may represent
the figure weeping as tearing his clothes, or some other expression,
as various as the cause of his feeling may be; because some weep
for anger, some through fear, others for tenderness and joy, or for
suspicion; some for real pain and torment; whilst others weep through
compassion, or regret at the loss of some friend and near relation.These different feelings will be expressed by some with marks of
despair, by others with moderation; some only shed tears, others cry
aloud, while another has his face turned towards heaven, with his
hand depressed, and his fingers twisted.Some again will be full of
apprehension, with their shoulders raised up to their ears, and so on,
according to the above causes.Those who weep, raise the brows, and bring them close together above
the nose, forming many wrinkles on the forehead, and the corners of the
mouth are turned downwards.Those who laugh have them turned upwards,
and the brows open and extended.CLXXIII./--_Of Anger._


/If/ you represent a man in a violent fit of anger, make him seize
another by the hair, holding his head writhed down against the ground,
with his knee fixed upon the ribs of his antagonist; his right arm up,
and his fist ready to strike; his hair standing on end, his eyebrows
low and straight; his teeth close, and seen at the corner of the mouth;
his neck swelled, and his body covered in the Abdomen with creases,
occasioned by his bending over his enemy, and the excess of his passion.CLXXIV./--_Despair._


/The/ last act of despondency is, when a man is in the act of putting a
period to his own existence.He should be represented with a knife in
one hand, with which he has already inflicted the wound, and tearing it
open with the other.He
will be standing with his feet asunder, his knees a little bent, and
his body leaning forward, as if ready to fall to the ground.CLXXV./--_The Course of Study to be pursued._


/The/ student who is desirous of making great proficiency in the art
of imitating the works of Nature, should not only learn the shape of
figures or other objects, and be able to delineate them with truth and
precision, but he must also accompany them with their proper lights and
shadows, according to the situation in which those objects appear.CLXXVI./--_Which of the two is the most useful Knowledge, the
Outlines of Figures, or that of Light and Shadow._


/The/ knowledge of the outline is of most consequence, and yet may be
acquired to great certainty by dint of study; as the outlines of the
different parts of the human figure, particularly those which do not
bend, are invariably the same.But the knowledge of the situation,
quality, and quantity of shadows, being infinite, requires the most
extensive study.CLXXVII./--_Which is the most important, the Shadows or Outlines
in Painting._


/It/ requires much more observation and study to arrive at perfection
in the shadowing of a picture, than in merely drawing the lines of it.The proof of this is, that the lines may be traced upon a veil or a
flat glass placed between the eye and the object to be imitated.But
that cannot be of any use in shadowing, on account of the infinite
gradation of shades, and the blending of them, which does not allow of
any precise termination; and most frequently they are confused, as will
be demonstrated in another place[35].CLXXVIII./--_What is a Painter's first Aim, and Object._


/The/ first object of a painter is to make a simple flat surface appear
like a relievo, and some of its parts detached from the ground; he
who excels all others in that part of the art, deserves the greatest
praise.This perfection of the art depends on the correct distribution
of lights and shades, called _Chiaro-scuro_.If the painter then avoids
shadows, he may be said to avoid the glory of the art, and to render
his work despicable to real connoisseurs, for the sake of acquiring the
esteem of vulgar and ignorant admirers of fine colours, who never have
any knowledge of relievo.CLXXIX./--_The Difference of Superficies, in regard to Painting._


/Solid/ bodies are of two sorts: the one has the surface curvilinear,
oval, or spherical; the other has several surfaces, or sides producing
angles, either regular or irregular.Spherical, or oval bodies, will
always appear detached from their ground, though they are exactly of
the same colour.Bodies also of different sides and angles will always
detach, because they are always disposed so as to produce shades on
some of their sides, which cannot happen to a plain superficies[36].CLXXX./--_How a Painter may become universal._


/The/ painter who wishes to be universal, and please a variety of
judges, must unite in the same composition, objects susceptible of
great force in the shadows, and great sweetness in the management of
them; accounting, however, in every instance, for such boldness and
softenings.CLXXXI./--_Accuracy ought to be learnt before Dispatch in the
Execution._


/If/ you wish to make good and useful studies, use great deliberation
in your drawings, observe well among the lights which, and how many,
hold the first rank in point of brightness; and so among the shadows,
which are darker than others, and in what manner they blend together;
compare the quality and quantity of one with the other, and observe
to what part they are directed.Be careful also in your outlines, or
divisions of the members.Remark well what quantity of parts are to be
on one side, and what on the other; and where they are more or less
apparent, or broad, or slender.Lastly, take care that the shadows and
lights be united, or lost in each other; without any hard strokes, or
lines: as smoke loses itself in the air, so are your lights and shadows
to pass from the one to the other, without any apparent separation.When you have acquired the habit, and formed your hand to accuracy,
quickness of execution will come of itself[37].CLXXXII./--_How the Painter is to place himself in regard to the
Light, and his Model._


/Let/ A B be the window, M the centre of it, C the model.The best
situation for the painter will be a little sideways, between the window
and his model, as D, so that he may see his object partly in the light
and partly in the shadow.[Illustration]




/Chap.CLXXXIII./--_Of the best Light._


/The/ light from on high, and not too powerful, will be found the best
calculated to shew the parts to advantage.CLXXXIV./--_Of Drawing by Candle-light._


/To/ this artificial light apply a paper blind, and you will see the
shadows undetermined and soft.CLXXXV./--_Of those Painters who draw at Home from one Light,
and afterwards adapt their Studies to another Situation in the Country,
and a different Light._


/It/ is a great error in some painters who draw a figure from Nature at
home, by any particular light, and afterwards make use of that drawing
in a picture representing an open country, which receives the general
light of the sky, where the surrounding air gives light on all sides.This painter would put dark shadows, where Nature would either produce
none, or, if any, so very faint as to be almost imperceptible; and he
would throw reflected lights where it is impossible there should be any.CLXXXVI./--_How high the Light should be in drawing from Nature._


/To/ paint well from Nature, your window should be to the North, that
the lights may not vary.If it be to the South, you must have paper
blinds, that the sun, in going round, may not alter the shadows.The
situation of the light should be such as to produce upon the ground a
shadow from your model as long as that is high.CLXXXVII./--_What Light the Painter must make use of to give
most Relief to his Figures._


/The/ figures which receive a particular light shew more relief than
those which receive an universal one; because the particular light
occasions some reflexes, which proceed from the light of one object
upon the shadows of another, and helps to detach it from the dark
ground.But a figure placed in front of a dark and large space, and
receiving a particular light, can receive no reflexion from any other
objects, and nothing is seen of the figure but what the light strikes
on, the rest being blended and lost in the darkness of the back ground.This is to be applied only to the imitation of night subjects with very
little light.CLXXXVIII./--_Advice to Painters._


/Be/ very careful, in painting, to observe, that between the shadows
there are other shadows, almost imperceptible, both for darkness and
shape; and this is proved by the third proposition[38], which says,
that the surfaces of globular or convex bodies have as great a variety
of lights and shadows as the bodies that surround them have.CLXXXIX./--_Of Shadows._


/Those/ shadows which in Nature are undetermined, and the extremities of
which can hardly be perceived, are to be copied in your painting in
the same manner, never to be precisely finished, but left confused and
blended.This apparent neglect will shew great judgment, and be the
ingenious result of your observation of Nature.CXC./--_Of the Kind of Light proper for drawing from Relievos,
or from Nature._


/Lights/ separated from the shadows with too much precision, have a
very bad effect.In order, therefore, to avoid this inconvenience,
if the object be in the open country, you need not let your figures
be illumined by the sun; but may suppose some transparent clouds
interposed, so that the sun not being visible, the termination of the
shadows will be also imperceptible and soft.CXCI./--_Whether the Light should be admitted in Front or
sideways; and which is most pleasing and graceful._


/The/ light admitted in front of heads situated opposite to side walls
that are dark, will cause them to have great relievo, particularly if
the light be placed high; and the reason is, that the most prominent
parts of those faces are illumined by the general light striking them
in front, which light produces very faint shadows on the part where it
strikes; but as it turns towards the sides, it begins to participate
of the dark shadows of the room, which grow darker in proportion as
it sinks into them.Besides, when the light comes from on high, it
does not strike on every part of the face alike, but one part produces
great shadows upon another; as the eyebrows, which deprive the whole
sockets of the eyes of light.The nose keeps it off from great part of
the mouth, and the chin from the neck, and such other parts.This, by
concentrating the light upon the most projecting parts, produces a very
great relief.CXCII./--_Of the Difference of Lights according to the
Situation._


/A small/ light will cast large and determined shadows upon the
surrounding bodies.A large light, on the contrary, will cast small
shadows on them, and they will be much confused in their termination.When a small but strong light is surrounded by a broad but weaker
light, the latter will appear like a demi-tint to the other, as the sky
round the sun.And the bodies which receive the light from the one,
will serve as demi-tints to those which receive the light from the
other.CXCIII./--_How to distribute the Light on Figures._


/The/ lights are to be distributed according to the natural situation
you mean your figures should occupy.If you suppose them in sunshine,
the shades must be dark, the lights broad and extended, and the shadows
of all the surrounding objects distinctly marked upon the ground.If
seen in a gloomy day, there will be very little difference between
the lights and shades, and no shadows at the feet.If the figures
be represented within doors, the lights and shadows will again be
distinctly divided, and produce shadows on the ground.But if you
suppose a paper blind at the window, and the walls painted white,
the effect will be the same as in a gloomy day, when the lights and
shadows have little difference.If the figures are enlightened by the
fire, the lights must be red and powerful, the shadows dark, and the
shadows upon the ground and upon the walls must be precise; observing
that they spread wider as they go off from the body.If the figures
be enlightened, partly by the sky and partly by the fire, that side
which receives the light from the sky will be the brightest, and on
the other side it will be reddish, somewhat of the colour of the fire.Above all, contrive, that your figures receive a broad light, and that
from above; particularly in portraits, because the people we see in the
street receive all the light from above; and it is curious to observe,
that there is not a face ever so well known amongst your acquaintance,
but would be recognised with difficulty, if it were enlightened from
beneath.CXCIV./--_Of the Beauty of Faces._


/You/ must not mark any muscles with hardness of line, but let the
soft light glide upon them, and terminate imperceptibly in delightful
shadows: from this will arise grace and beauty to the face.CXCV./--_How, in drawing a Face, to give it Grace, by the
Management of Light and Shade._


/A face/ placed in the dark part of a room, acquires great additional
grace by means of light and shadow.The shadowed part of the face
blends with the darkness of the ground, and the light part receives
an increase of brightness from the open air, the shadows on this side
becoming almost insensible; and from this augmentation of light and
shadow, the face has much relief, and acquires great beauty.CXCVI./--_How to give Grace and Relief to Faces._


/In/ streets running towards the west, when the sun is in the meridian,
and the walls on each side so high that they cast no reflexions on that
side of the bodies which is in shade, and the sky is not too bright,
we find the most advantageous situation for giving relief and grace to
figures, particularly to faces; because both sides of the face will
participate of the shadows of the walls.The sides of the nose and
the face towards the west, will be light, and the man whom we suppose
placed at the entrance, and in the middle of the street, will see all
the parts of that face, which are before him, perfectly illumined,
while both sides of it, towards the walls, will be in shadow.What
gives additional grace is, that these shades do not appear cutting,
hard, or dry, but softly blended and lost in each other.The reason of
it is, that the light which is spread all over in the air, strikes also
the pavement of the street, and reflecting upon the shady part of the
face, it tinges that slightly with the same hue: while the great light
which comes from above being confined by the tops of houses, strikes
on the face from different points, almost to the very beginning of
the shadows under the projecting parts of the face.It diminishes by
degrees the strength of them, increasing the light till it comes upon
the chin, where it terminates, and loses itself, blending softly into
the shades on all sides.For instance, if such light were A E, the line
F E would give light even to the bottom of the nose.The line C F will
give light only to the under lip; but the line A H would extend the
shadow to all the under parts of the face, and under the chin.In this situation the nose receives a very strong light from all the
points A B C D E.[Illustration]




/Chap.CXCVII./--_Of the Termination of Bodies upon each other._


/When/ a body, of a cylindrical or convex surface, terminates upon
another body of the same colour, it will appear darker on the edge,
than the body upon which it terminates.And any flat body, adjacent to
a white surface, will appear very dark; but upon a dark ground it will
appear lighter than any other part, though the lights be equal.CXCVIII./--_Of the Back-grounds of painted Objects._


/The/ ground which surrounds the figures in any painting, ought to
be darker than the light part of those figures, and lighter than the
shadowed part.CXCIX./--_How to detach and bring forward Figures out of their
Back-ground._


/If/ your figure be dark, place it on a light ground; if it be light,
upon a dark ground; and if it be partly light and partly dark, as is
generally the case, contrive that the dark part of the figure be upon
the light part of the ground, and the light side of it against the
dark[39].CC./--_Of proper Back-grounds._


/It/ is of the greatest importance to consider well the nature of
back-grounds, upon which any opake body is to be placed.In order to
detach it properly, you should place the light part of such opake body
against the dark part of the back-ground, and the dark parts on a light
ground[40]; as in the cut[41].[Illustration]




/Chap.CCI./--_Of the general Light diffused over Figures._


/In/ compositions of many figures and animals, observe, that the parts
of these different objects ought to be darker in proportion as they are
lower, and as they are nearer the middle of the groups, though they
are all of an uniform colour.This is necessary, because a smaller
portion of the sky (from which all bodies are illuminated) can give
light to the lower spaces between these different figures, than to the
upper parts of the spaces.It is proved thus: A B C D is that portion
of the sky which gives light to all the objects beneath; M and N are
the bodies which occupy the space S T R H, in which it is evidently
perceived, that the point F, receiving the light only from the portion
of the sky C D, has a smaller quantity of it than the point E which
receives it from the whole space A B (a larger portion than C D);
therefore it will be lighter in E than in F.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCII./--_Of those Parts in Shadows which appear the darkest at a
Distance._


[Illustration]

/The/ neck, or any other part which is raised straight upwards, and
has a projection over it, will be darker than the perpendicular
front of that projection; and this projecting part will be lighter,
in proportion as it presents a larger surface to the light.For
instance, the recess A receives no light from any part of the sky G
K, but B begins to receive the light from the part of the sky H K,
and C from G K; and the point D receives the whole of F K. Therefore
the chest will be as light as the forehead, nose, and chin.But what
I have particularly to recommend, in regard to faces, is, that you
observe well those different qualities of shades which are lost at
different distances (while there remain only the first and principal
spots or strokes of shades, such as those of the sockets of the eyes,
and other similar recesses, which are always dark), and at last the
whole face becomes obscured; because the greatest lights (being small
in proportion to the demi-tints) are lost.The quality, therefore,
and quantity of the principal lights and shades are by means of great
distance blended together into a general half-tint; and this is the
reason why trees and other objects are found to be in appearance darker
at some distance than they are in reality, when nearer to the eye.But then the air, which interposes between the objects and the eye,
will render them light again by tinging them with azure, rather in the
shades than in the lights; for the lights will preserve the truth of
the different colours much longer.CCIII./--_Of the Eye viewing the Folds of Draperies surrounding
a Figure._


/The/ shadows between the folds of a drapery surrounding the parts of
the human body will be darker as the deep hollows where the shadows are
generated are more directly opposite the eye.This is to be observed
only when the eye is placed between the light and the shady part of the
figure.CCIV./--_Of the Relief of Figures remote from the Eye._


/Any/ opake body appears less relieved in proportion as it is farther
distant from the eye; because the air, interposed between the eye
and such body, being lighter than the shadow of it, it tarnishes and
weakens that shadow, lessens its power, and consequently lessens also
its relief.CCV./--_Of Outlines of Objects on the Side towards the Light._


/The/ extremities of any object on the side which receives the light,
will appear darker if upon a lighter ground, and lighter if seen upon a
darker ground.But if such body be flat, and seen upon a ground equal
in point of light with itself, and of the same colour, such boundaries,
or outlines, will be entirely lost to the sight[42].CCVI./--_How to make Objects detach from their Ground, that is
to say, from the Surface on which they are painted._


/Objects/ contrasted with a light ground will appear much more detached
than those which are placed against a dark one.The reason is, that
if you wish to give relief to your figures, you will make those parts
which are the farthest from the light, participate the least of it;
therefore they will remain the darkest, and every distinction of
outline would be lost in the general mass of shadows.But to give it
grace, roundness, and effect, those dark shades are always attended by
reflexes, or else they would either cut too hard upon the ground, or
stick to it, by the similarity of shade, and relieve the less as the
ground is darker; for at some distance nothing would be seen but the
light parts, therefore your figures would appear mutilated of all that
remains lost in the back-ground.CCVII./--_A Precept._


/Figures/ will have more grace, placed in the open and general light,
than in any particular or small one; because the powerful and
extended light will surround and embrace the objects: and works done
in that kind of light appear pleasant and graceful when placed at a
distance[43], while those which are drawn in a narrow light, will
receive great force of shadow, but will never appear at a great
distance, but as painted objects.CCVIII./--_Of the Interposition of transparent Bodies between
the Eye and the Object._


/The/ greater the transparent interposition is between the eye and the
object, the more the colour of that object will participate of, or be
changed into that of the transparent medium[44].When an opake body is situated between the eye and the luminary, so
that the central line of the one passes also through the centre of the
other, that object will be entirely deprived of light.CCIX./--_Of proper Back-grounds for Figures._


/As/ we find by experience, that all bodies are surrounded by lights
and shadows, I would have the painter to accommodate that part which is
enlightened, so as to terminate upon something dark; and to manage the
dark parts so that they may terminate on a light ground.This will be
of great assistance in detaching and bringing out his figures[45].CCX./--_Of Back-grounds._


/To/ give a great effect to figures, you must oppose to a light one a
dark ground, and to a dark figure a light ground, contrasting white
with black, and black with white.In general, all contraries give a
particular force and brilliancy of effect by their opposition[46].CCXI./--_Of Objects placed on a light Ground, and why such a
Practice is useful in Painting._


/When/ a darkish body terminates upon a light ground, it will appear
detached from that ground; because all opake bodies of a curved
surface are not only dark on that side which receives no light, and
consequently very different from the ground; but even that side of the
curved surface which is enlightened, will not carry its principal light
to the extremities, but have between the ground and the principal light
a certain demi-tint, darker than either the ground or that light.CCXII./--_Of the different Effects of White, according to the
Difference of Back-grounds._


/Any/ thing white will appear whiter, by being opposed to a dark
ground; and, on the contrary, darker upon a light ground.This we learn
from observing snow as it falls; while it is descending it appears
darker against the sky, than when we see it against an open window,
which (owing to the darkness of the inside of the house) makes it
appear very white.Observe also, that snow appears to fall very quick
and in a great quantity when near the eye; but when at some distance,
it seems to come down slowly, and in a smaller quantity[47].CCXIII./--_Of Reverberation._


/Reverberations/ are produced by all bodies of a bright nature, that
have a smooth and tolerably hard surface, which, repelling the light it
receives, makes it rebound like a foot-ball against the first object
opposed to it.CCXIV./--_Where there cannot be any Reverberation of Light._


/The/ surfaces of hard bodies are surrounded by various qualities of
light and shadow.The lights are of two sorts; one is called original,
the other derivative.The original light is that which comes from the
sun, or the brightness of fire, or else from the air.But to return to our definition, I say, there can
be no reflexion on that side which is turned towards any dark body;
such as roofs, either high or low, shrubs, grass, wood, either dry
or green; because, though every individual part of those objects be
turned towards the original light, and struck by it; yet the quantity
of shadow which every one of these parts produces upon the others, is
so great, that, upon the whole, the light, not forming a compact mass,
loses its effect, so that those objects cannot reflect any light upon
the opposite bodies.CCXV./--_In what Part the Reflexes have more or less Brightness._


/The/ reflected lights will be more or less apparent or bright, in
proportion as they are seen against a darker or fainter ground; because
if the ground be darker than the reflex, then this reflex will appear
stronger on account of the great difference of colour.But, on the
contrary, if this reflexion has behind it a ground lighter than itself,
it will appear dark, in comparison to the brightness which is close to
it, and therefore it will be hardly perceptible[48].CCXVI./--_Of the reflected Lights which surround the Shadows._


/The/ reflected lights which strike upon the midst of shadows, will
brighten up or lessen their obscurity in proportion to the strength
of those lights, and their proximity to those shadows.Many painters
neglect this observation, while others attend to and deduce their
practice from it.This difference of opinion and practice divides the
sentiments of artists, so that they blame each other for not thinking
and acting as they themselves do.The best way is to steer a middle
course, and not to admit of any reflected light, but when the cause of
it is evident to every eye; and _vice versa_, if you introduce none
at all, let it appear evident that there was no reasonable cause for
it.In doing so, you will neither be totally blamed nor praised by the
variety of opinion, which, if not proceeding from entire ignorance,
will ensure to you the approbation of both parties.CCXVII./--_Where Reflexes are to be most apparent._


/Of/ all reflected lights, that is to be the most apparent, bold, and
precise, which detaches from the darkest ground; and, on the contrary,
that which is upon a lighter ground will be less apparent.And this
proceeds from the contraste of shades, by which the faintest makes the
dark ones appear still darker; so in contrasted lights, the brightest
cause the others to appear less bright than they really are[49].CCXVIII./--_What Part of a Reflex is to be the lightest._


/That/ part will be the brightest which receives the reflected light
between angles the most nearly equal.For example, let N be the
luminary, and A B the illuminated part of the object, reflecting the
light over all the shady part of the concavity opposite to it.The
light which reflects upon F will be placed between equal angles.But
E at the base will not be reflected by equal angles, as it is evident
that the angle E A B is more obtuse than the angle E B A. The angle
A F B however, though it is between angles of less quality than the
angle E, and has a common base B A, is between angles more nearly equal
than E, therefore it will be lighter in F than in E; and it will also
be brighter, because it is nearer to the part which gives them light.According to the 6th rule[50], which says, that part of the body is to
be the lightest, which is nearest to the luminary.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXIX./--_Of the Termination of Reflexes on their Grounds._


/The/ termination of a reflected light on a ground lighter than that
reflex, will not be perceivable; but if such a reflex terminates upon a
ground darker than itself, it will be plainly seen; and the more so in
proportion as that ground is darker, and _vice versa_[51].CCXX./--_Of double and treble Reflexions of Light._


/Double/ reflexes are stronger than single ones, and the shadows which
interpose between the common light and these reflexes are very faint.For instance, let A be the luminous body, A N, A S, are the direct
rays, and S N the parts which receive the light from them.O and E are
the places enlightened by the reflexion of that light in those parts.A N E is a single reflex, but A N O, A S O is the double reflex.The
single reflex is that which proceeds from a single light, but the
double reflexion is produced by two different lights.The single one
E is produced by the light striking on B D, while the double one O
proceeds from the enlightened bodies B D and D R co-operating together;
and the shadows which are between N O and S O will be very faint.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXXI./--_Reflexes in the Water, and particularly those of the
Air._


/The/ only portion of air that will be seen reflected in the water,
will be that which is reflected by the surface of the water to the eye
between equal angles; that is to say, the angle of incidence must be
equal to the angle of reflexion.COLOURS /and/ COLOURING.CCXXII./--_What Surface is best calculated to receive most
Colours._


/White/ is more capable of receiving all sorts of colours, than the
surface of any body whatever, that is not transparent.To prove it, we
shall say, that any void space is capable of receiving what another
space, not void, cannot receive.In the same manner, a white surface,
like a void space, being destitute of any colour, will be fittest to
receive such as are conveyed to it from any other enlightened body, and
will participate more of the colour than black can do; which latter,
like a broken vessel, is not able to contain any thing.CCXXIII./--_What Surface will shew most perfectly its true
Colour._


/That/ opake body will shew its colour more perfect and beautiful,
which has near it another body of the same colour.CCXXIV./--_On what Surfaces the true Colour is least apparent._


/Polished/ and glossy surfaces shew least of their genuine colour.This
is exemplified in the grass of the fields, and the leaves of trees,
which, being smooth and glossy, will reflect the colour of the sun, and
the air, where they strike, so that the parts which receive the light
do not shew their natural colour.CCXXV./--_What Surfaces shew most of their true and genuine
Colour._


/Those/ objects that are the least smooth and polished shew their
natural colours best; as we see in cloth, and in the leaves of such
grass or trees as are of a woolly nature; which, having no lustre,
are exhibited to the eye in their true natural colour; unless that
colour happen to be confused by that of another body casting on them
reflexions of an opposite colour, such as the redness of the setting
sun, when all the clouds are tinged with its colour.CCXXVI./--_Of the Mixture of Colours._


/Although/ the mixture of colours may be extended to an infinite
variety, almost impossible to be described, I will not omit touching
slightly upon it, setting down at first a certain number of simple
colours to serve as a foundation, and with each of these mixing one
of the others; one with one, then two with two, and three with three,
proceeding in this manner to the full mixture of all the colors
together: then I would begin again, mixing two of these colours with
two others, and three with three, four with four, and so on to the end.To these two colours we shall put three; to these three add three more,
and then six, increasing always in the same proportion.I call those simple colours, which are not composed, and cannot be made
or supplied by any mixture of other colours.Black and White are not
reckoned among colours; the one is the representative of darkness, the
other of light: that is, one is a simple privation of light, the other
is light itself.Yet I will not omit mentioning them, because there is
nothing in painting more useful and necessary; since painting is but an
effect produced by lights and shadows, viz.After Black
and White come Blue and Yellow, then Green, and Tawny or Umber, and
then Purple and Red.With these I begin my mixtures, first Black and White, Black and
Yellow, Black and Red; then Yellow and Red: but I shall treat more at
length of these mixtures in a separate work[52], which will be of great
utility, nay very necessary.I shall place this subject between theory
and practice.CCXXVII./--_Of the Colours produced by the Mixture of other
Colours, called secondary Colours._


/The/ first of all simple colours is White, though philosophers will
not acknowledge either White or Black to be colours; because the first
is the cause, or the receiver of colours, the other totally deprived
of them.But as painters cannot do without either, we shall place them
among the others; and according to this order of things, White will
be the first, Yellow the second, Green the third, Blue the fourth,
Red the fifth, and Black the sixth.We shall set down White for the
representative of light, without which no colour can be seen; Yellow
for the earth; Green for water; Blue for air; Red for fire; and Black
for total darkness.If you wish to see by a short process the variety of all the mixed, or
composed colours, take some  glasses, and, through them, look
at all the country round: you will find that the colour of each object
will be altered and mixed with the colour of the glass through which it
is seen; observe which colour is made better, and which is hurt by the
mixture.If the glass be yellow, the colour of the objects may either
be improved, or greatly impaired by it.Black and White will be most
altered, while Green and Yellow will be meliorated.In the same manner
you may go through all the mixtures of colours, which are infinite.Select those which are new and agreeable to the sight; and following
the same method you may go on with two glasses, or three, till you have
found what will best answer your purpose.CCXXVIII./--_Of Verdegris._


/This/ green, which is made of copper, though it be mixed with oil,
will lose its beauty, if it be not varnished immediately.It not only
fades, but, if washed with a sponge and pure water only, it will detach
from the ground upon which it is painted, particularly in damp weather;
because verdegris is produced by the strength of salts, which easily
dissolve in rainy weather, but still more if washed with a wet sponge.CCXXIX./--_How to increase the Beauty of Verdegris._


/If/ you mix with the Verdegris some Caballine Aloe, it will add to it
a great degree of beauty.It would acquire still more from Saffron, if
it did not fade.The quality and goodness of this Aloe will be proved
by dissolving it in warm Brandy.Supposing the Verdegris has already
been used, and the part finished, you may then glaze it thinly with
this dissolved Aloe, and it will produce a very fine colour.This Aloe
may be ground also in oil by itself, or with the Verdegris, or any
other colour, at pleasure.CCXXX./--_How to paint a Picture that will last almost for ever._


/After/ you have made a drawing of your intended picture, prepare a
good and thick priming with pitch and brickdust well pounded; after
which give it a second coat of white lead and Naples yellow; then,
having traced your drawing upon it, and painted your picture, varnish
it with clear and thick old oil, and stick it to a flat glass, or
crystal, with a clear varnish.Another method, which may be better,
is, instead of the priming of pitch and brickdust, take a flat tile
well vitrified, then apply the coat of white and Naples yellow, and all
the rest as before.But before the glass is applied to it, the painting
must be perfectly dried in a stove, and varnished with nut oil and
amber, or else with purified nut oil alone, thickened in the sun[53].CCXXXI./--_The Mode of painting on Canvass, or Linen Cloth_[54]./Stretch/ your canvass upon a frame, then give it a coat of weak size,
let it dry, and draw your outlines upon it.Paint the flesh colours
first; and while it is still fresh or moist, paint also the shadows,
well softened and blended together.The flesh colour may be made with
white, lake, and Naples yellow.The shades with black, umber, and
a little lake; you may, if you please, use black chalk.After you
have softened this first coat, or dead colour, and let it dry, you
may retouch over it with lake and other colours, and gum water that
has been a long while made and kept liquid, because in that state it
becomes better, and does not leave any gloss.Again, to make the shades
darker, take the lake and gum as above, and ink[55]; and with this you
may shade or glaze many colours, because it is transparent; such as
azure, lake, and several others.As for the lights, you may retouch
or glaze them slightly with gum water and pure lake, particularly
vermilion.CCXXXII./--_Of lively and beautiful Colours._


/For/ those colours which you mean should appear beautiful, prepare a
ground of pure white.This is meant only for transparent colours: as
for those that have a body, and are opake, it matters not what ground
they have, and a white one is of no use.This is exemplified by painted
glasses; when placed between the eye and clear air, they exhibit most
excellent and beautiful colours, which is not the case, when they have
thick air, or some opake body behind them.CCXXXIII./--_Of transparent Colours._


/When/ a transparent colour is laid upon another of a different
nature, it produces a mixed colour, different from either of the
simple ones which compose it.This is observed in the smoke coming
out of a chimney, which, when passing before the black soot, appears
blueish, but as it ascends against the blue of the sky, it changes its
appearance into a reddish brown.So the colour lake laid on blue will
turn it to a violet colour; yellow upon blue turns to green; saffron
upon white becomes yellow; white scumbled upon a dark ground appears
blue, and is more or less beautiful, as the white and the ground are
more or less pure.CCXXXIV./--_In what Part a Colour will appear in its greatest
Beauty._


/We/ are to consider here in what part any colour will shew itself in
its most perfect purity; whether in the strongest light or deepest
shadow, in the demi-tint, or in the reflex.It would be necessary to
determine first, of what colour we mean to treat, because different
colours differ materially in that respect.Black is most beautiful
in the shades; white in the strongest light; blue and green in the
half-tint; yellow and red in the principal light; gold in the reflexes;
and lake in the half-tint.CCXXXV./--_How any Colour without Gloss, is more beautiful in
the Lights than in the Shades._


/All/ objects which have no gloss, shew their colours better in the
light than in the shadow, because the light vivifies and gives a true
knowledge of the nature of the colour, while the shadows lower, and
destroy its beauty, preventing the discovery of its nature.If, on the
contrary, black be more beautiful in the shadows, it is because black
is not a colour.CCXXXVI./--_Of the Appearance of Colours._


/The/ lighter a colour is in its nature, the more so it will appear when
removed to some distance; but with dark colours it is quite the reverse.CCXXXVII./--_What Part of a Colour is to be the most beautiful._


/If/ A be the light, and B the object receiving it in a direct line,
E cannot receive that light, but only the reflexion from B, which we
shall suppose to be red.In that case, the light it produces being red,
it will tinge with red the object E; and if E happen to be also red
before, you will see that colour increase in beauty, and appear redder
than B; but if E were yellow, you will see a new colour, participating
of the red and the yellow.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXXXVIII./--_That the Beauty of a Colour is to be found
in the Lights._


/As/ the quality of colours is discovered to the eye by the light, it
is natural to conclude, that where there is most light, there also
the true quality of the colour is to be seen; and where there is most
shadow the colour will participate of, and be tinged with the colour of
that shadow.Remember then to shew the true quality of the colour in
the light parts only[56].CCXXXIX./--_Of Colours._


/The/ colour which is between the light and the shadow will not be so
beautiful as that which is in the full light.Therefore the chief beauty
of colours will be found in the principal lights[57].CCXL./--_No Object appears in its true Colour, unless the
Light which strikes upon it be of the same Colour._


/This/ is very observable in draperies, where the light folds casting a
reflexion, and throwing a light on other folds opposite to them, make
them appear in their natural colour.The same effect is produced by gold
leaves casting their light reciprocally on each other.The effect is
quite contrary if the light be received from an object of a different
colour[58].CCXLI./--_Of the Colour of Shadows._


/The/ colour of the shadows of an object can never be pure if the body
which is opposed to these shadows be not of the same colour as that on
which they are produced.For instance, if in a room, the walls of which
are green, I place a figure clothed in blue, and receiving the light
from another blue object, the light part of that figure will be of a
beautiful blue, but the shadows of it will become dingy, and not like a
true shade of that beautiful blue, because it will be corrupted by the
reflexions from the green wall; and it would be still worse if the walls
were of a darkish brown.CCXLII./--_Of Colours._


/Colours/ placed in shadow will preserve more or less of their original
beauty, as they are more or less immersed in the shade.But colours
situated in a light space will shew their natural beauty in proportion
to the brightness of that light.Some say, that there is as great
variety in the colours of shadows, as in the colours of objects shaded
by them.It may be answered, that colours placed in shadow will shew
less variety amongst themselves as the shadows are darker.We shall
soon convince ourselves of this truth, if, from a large square, we look
through the open door of a church, where pictures, though enriched with
a variety of colours, appear all clothed in darkness.CCXLIII./--_Whether it be possible for all Colours to
appear alike by means of the same Shadow._


/It/ is very possible that all the different colours may be changed
into that of a general shadow; as is manifest in the darkness of a
cloudy night, in which neither the shape nor colour of bodies is
distinguished.Total darkness being nothing but a privation of the
primitive and reflected lights, by which the form and colour of bodies
are seen; it is evident, that the cause being removed the effect
ceases, and the objects are entirely lost to the sight.CCXLIV./--_Why White is not reckoned among the Colours._


/White/ is not a colour, but has the power of receiving all the other
colours.When it is placed in a high situation in the country, all its
shades are azure; according to the fourth proposition[59], which says,
that the surface of any opake body participates of the colour of any
other body sending the light to it.Therefore white being deprived of
the light of the sun by the interposition of any other body, will remain
white; if exposed to the sun on one side, and to the open air on the
other, it will participate both of the colour of the sun and of the air.That side which is not opposed to the sun, will be shaded of the colour
of the air.And if this white were not surrounded by green fields all
the way to the horizon, nor could receive any light from that horizon,
without doubt it would appear of one simple and uniform colour, viz.CCXLV./--_Of Colours._


/The/ light of the fire tinges every thing of a reddish yellow; but
this will hardly appear evident, if we do not make the comparison with
the daylight.Towards the close of the evening this is easily done; but
more certainly after the morning twilight; and the difference will be
clearly distinguished in a dark room, when a little glimpse of daylight
strikes upon any part of the room, and there still remains a candle
burning.Without such a trial the difference is hardly perceivable,
particularly in those colours which have most similarity; such as white
and yellow, light green and light blue; because the light which strikes
the blue, being yellow, will naturally turn it green; as we have said
in another place[60], that a mixture of blue and yellow produces green.And if to a green colour you add some yellow, it will make it of a more
beautiful green.CCXLVI./--_Of the Colouring of remote Objects._


/The/ painter, who is to represent objects at some distance from the
eye, ought merely to convey the idea of general undetermined masses,
making choice, for that purpose, of cloudy weather, or towards the
evening, and avoiding, as was said before, to mark the lights and
shadows too strong on the extremities; because they would in that
case appear like spots of difficult execution, and without grace.He
ought to remember, that the shadows are never to be of such a quality,
as to obliterate the proper colour, in which they originated; if the
situation of the <DW52> body be not in total darkness.He ought to
mark no outline, not to make the hair stringy, and not to touch with
pure white, any but those things which in themselves are white; in
short, the lightest touch upon any particular object ought to denote
the beauty of its proper and natural colour.CCXLVII./--_The Surface of all opake Bodies participates
of the Colour of the surrounding Objects._


/The/ painter ought to know, that if any white object is placed between
two walls, one of which is also white, and the other black, there will
be found between the shady side of that object and the light side, a
similar proportion to that of the two walls; and if that object be
blue, the effect will be the same.Having therefore to paint this
object, take some black, similar to that of the wall from which the
reflexes come; and to proceed by a certain and scientific method, do as
follows.When you paint the wall, take a small spoon to measure exactly
the quantity of colour you mean to employ in mixing your tints; for
instance, if you have put in the shading of this wall three spoonfuls
of pure black, and one of white, you have, without any doubt, a mixture
of a certain and precise quality.Now having painted one of the walls
white, and the other dark, if you mean to place a blue object between
them with shades suitable to that colour, place first on your pallet
the light blue, such as you mean it to be, without any mixture of
shade, and it will do for the lightest part of your object.After which
take three spoonfuls of black, and one of this light blue, for your
darkest shades.Then observe whether your object be round or square:
if it be square, these two extreme tints of light and shade will be
close to each other, cutting sharply at the angle; but if it be round,
draw lines from the extremities of the walls to the centre of the
object, and put the darkest shade between equal angles, where the lines
intersect upon the superficies of it; then begin to make them lighter
and lighter gradually to the point N O, lessening the strength of the
shadows as much as that place participates of the light A D, and mixing
that colour with the darkest shade A B, in the same proportion.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXLVIII./--_General Remarks on Colours._


/Blue/ and green are not simple colours in their nature, for blue is
composed of light and darkness; such is the azure of the sky, viz.Green is composed of a simple and a
mixed colour, being produced by blue and yellow.Any object seen in a mirror, will participate of the colour of that
body which serves as a mirror; and the mirror in its turn is tinged in
part by the colour of the object it represents; they partake more or
less of each other as the colour of the object seen is more or less
strong than the colour of the mirror.That object will appear of the
strongest and most lively colour in the mirror, which has the most
affinity to the colour of the mirror itself.Of  bodies, the purest white will be seen at the greatest
distance, therefore the darker the colour, the less it will bear
distance.Of different bodies equal in whiteness, and in distance from the eye,
that which is surrounded by the greatest darkness will appear the
whitest; and on the contrary, that shadow will appear the darkest that
has the brightest white round it.Of different colours, equally perfect, that will appear most excellent,
which is seen near its direct contrary.A pale colour against red, a
black upon white (though neither the one nor the other are colours),
blue near a yellow; green near red; because each colour is more
distinctly seen, when opposed to its contrary, than to any other
similar to it.Any thing white seen in a dense air full of vapours, will appear larger
than it is in reality.The air, between the eye and the object seen, will change the colour
of that object into its own; so will the azure of the air change the
distant mountains into blue masses.Through a red glass every thing
appears red; the light round the stars is dimmed by the darkness of the
air, which fills the space between the eye and the planets.The true colour of any object whatever will be seen in those parts
which are not occupied by any kind of shade, and have not any gloss (if
it be a polished surface).I say, that white terminating abruptly upon a dark ground, will cause
that part where it terminates to appear darker, and the white whiter.COLOURS IN REGARD TO LIGHT AND SHADOW.CCXLIX./--_Of the Light proper for painting Flesh Colour from
Nature._


/Your/ window must be open to the sky, and the walls painted of a
reddish colour.The summertime is the best, when the clouds conceal the
sun, or else your walls on the south side of the room must be so high,
as that the sun-beams cannot strike on the opposite side, in order
that the reflexion of those beams may not destroy the shadows.CCL./--_Of the Painter's Window._


/The/ window which gives light to a painting-room, ought to be made of
oiled paper, without any cross bar, or projecting edge at the opening,
or any sharp angle in the inside of the wall, but should be slanting by
degrees the whole thickness of it; and the sides be painted black.CCLI./--_The Shadows of Colours._


/The/ shadows of any colour whatever must participate of that colour
more or less, as it is nearer to, or more remote from the mass of
shadows; and also in proportion to its distance from, or proximity to
the mass of light.CCLII./--_Of the Shadows of White._


/To/ any white body receiving the light from the sun, or the air, the
shadows should be of a blueish cast; because white is no colour, but a
receiver of all colours; and as by the fourth proposition[61] we learn,
that the surface of any object participates of the colours of other
objects near it, it is evident that a white surface will participate of
the colour of the air by which it is surrounded.CCLIII./--_Which of the Colours will produce the darkest Shade._


/That/ shade will be the darkest which is produced by the whitest
surface; this also will have a greater propensity to variety than any
other surface; because white is not properly a colour, but a receiver
of colours, and its surface will participate strongly of the colour of
surrounding objects, but principally of black or any other dark colour,
which being the most opposite to its nature, produces the most sensible
difference between the shadows and the lights.CCLIV./--_How to manage, when a White terminates upon another
White._


/When/ one white body terminates on another of the same colour, the
white of these two bodies will be either alike or not.If they be
alike, that object which of the two is nearest to the eye, should be
made a little darker than the other, upon the rounding of the outline;
but if the object which serves as a ground to the other be not quite so
white, the latter will detach of itself, without the help of any darker
termination.CCLV./--_On the Back-grounds of Figures._


/Of/ two objects equally light, one will appear less so if seen upon
a whiter ground; and, on the contrary, it will appear a great deal
lighter if upon a space of a darker shade.So flesh colour will appear
pale upon a red ground, and a pale colour will appear redder upon
a yellow ground.In short, colours will appear what they are not,
according to the ground which surrounds them.CCLVI./--_The Mode of composing History._


/Amongst/ the figures which compose an historical picture, those which
are meant to appear the nearest to the eye, must have the greatest
force; according to the second proposition[62] of the third book, which
says, that colour will be seen in the greatest perfection which has
less air interposed between it and the eye of the beholder; and for
that reason the shadows (by which we express the relievo of bodies)
appear darker when near than when at a distance, being then deadened by
the air which interposes.This does not happen to those shadows which
are near the eye, where they will produce the greatest relievo when
they are darkest.CCLVII./--_Remarks concerning Lights and Shadows._


/Observe/, that where the shadows end, there be always a kind of
half-shadow to blend them with the lights.The shadow derived from any
object will mix more with the light at its termination, in proportion
as it is more distant from that object.But the colour of the shadow
will never be simple: this is proved by the ninth proposition[63],
which says, that the superficies of any object participates of the
colours of other bodies, by which it is surrounded, although it were
transparent, such as water, air, and the like: because the air receives
its light from the sun, and darkness is produced by the privation of
it.But as the air has no colour in itself any more than water, it
receives all the colours that are between the object and the eye.The
vapours mixing with the air in the lower regions near the earth, render
it thick, and apt to reflect the sun's rays on all sides, while the air
above remains dark; and because light (that is, white) and darkness
(that is, black), mixed together, compose the azure that becomes the
colour of the sky, which is lighter or darker in proportion as the air
is more or less mixed with damp vapours.CCLVIII./--_Why the Shadows of Bodies upon a white Wall are
blueish towards Evening._


[Illustration]

/The/ shadows of bodies produced by the redness of the setting
sun, will always be blueish.This is accounted for by the eleventh
proposition[64], which says, that the superficies of any opake body
participates of the colour of the object from which it receives the
light; therefore the white wall being deprived entirely of colour, is
tinged by the colour of those bodies from which it receives the light,
which in this case are the sun and the sky.But because the sun is red
towards the evening, and the sky is blue, the shadow on the wall not
being enlightened by the sun, receives only the reflexion of the sky,
and therefore will appear blue; and the rest of the wall, receiving
light immediately from the sun, will participate of its red colour.CCLIX./--_Of the Colour of Faces._


/The/ colour of any object will appear more or less distinct in
proportion to the extent of its surface.This proportion is proved, by
observing that a face appears dark at a small distance, because, being
composed of many small parts, it produces a great number of shadows;
and the lights being the smallest part of it, are soonest lost to the
sight, leaving only the shadows, which being in a greater quantity, the
whole of the face appears dark, and the more so if that face has on the
head, or at the back, something whiter.CCLX./--_A Precept relating to Painting._


/Where/ the shadows terminate upon the lights, observe well what parts
of them are lighter than the others, and where they are more or less
softened and blended; but above all remember, that young people have
no sharp shadings: their flesh is transparent, something like what
we observe when we put our hand between the sun and eyes; it appears
reddish, and of a transparent brightness.If you wish to know what
kind of shadow will suit the flesh colour you are painting, place one
of your fingers close to your picture, so as to cast a shadow upon it,
and according as you wish it either lighter or darker, put it nearer or
farther from it, and imitate it.CCLXI./--_Of Colours in Shadow._


/It/ happens very often that the shadows of an opake body do not retain
the same colour as the lights.Sometimes they will be greenish, while
the lights are reddish, although this opake body be all over of one
uniform colour.This happens when the light falls upon the object (we
will suppose from the East), and tinges that side with its own colour.In the West we will suppose another opake body of a colour different
from the first, but receiving the same light.This last will reflect
its colour towards the East, and strike the first with its rays on the
opposite side, where they will be stopped, and remain with their full
colour and brightness.We often see a white object with red lights, and
the shades of a blueish cast; this we observe particularly in mountains
covered with snow, at sun-set, when the effulgence of its rays makes
the horizon appear all on fire.CCLXII./--_Of the Choice of Lights._


/Whatever/ object you intend to represent is to be supposed situated
in a particular light, and that entirely of your own choosing.If you
imagine such objects to be in the country, and the sun be overcast,
they will be surrounded by a great quantity of general light.If the
sun strikes upon those objects, then the shadows will be very dark,
in proportion to the lights, and will be determined and sharp; the
primitive as well as the secondary ones.These shadows will vary from
the lights in colour, because on that side the object receives a
reflected light hue from the azure of the air, which tinges that part;
and this is particularly observable in white objects.That side which
receives the light from the sun, participates also of the colour of
that.This may be particularly observed in the evening, when the sun
is setting between the clouds, which it reddens; those clouds being
tinged with the colour of the body illuminating them, the red colour
of the clouds, with that of the sun, casts a hue on those parts which
receive the light from them.On the contrary, those parts which are not
turned towards that side of the sky, remain of the colour of the air,
so that the former and the latter are of two different colours.This
we must not lose sight of, that, knowing the cause of those lights and
shades, it be made apparent in the effect, or else the work will be
false and absurd.But if a figure be situated within a house, and seen
from without, such figure will have its shadows very soft; and if the
beholder stands in the line of the light, it will acquire grace, and do
credit to the painter, as it will have great relief in the lights, and
soft and well-blended shadows, particularly in those parts where the
inside of the room appears less obscure, because there the shadows are
almost imperceptible: the cause of which we shall explain in its proper
place.COLOURS IN REGARD TO BACK-GROUNDS.CCLXIII./--_Of avoiding hard Outlines._


/Do/ not make the boundaries of your figures with any other colour
than that of the back-ground, on which they are placed; that is, avoid
making dark outlines.CCLXIV./--_Of Outlines._


/The/ extremities of objects which are at some distance, are not seen
so distinctly as if they were nearer.Therefore the painter ought to
regulate the strength of his outlines, or extremities, according to the
distance.The boundaries which separate one body from another, are of the nature
of mathematical lines, but not of real lines.The end of any colour
is only the beginning of another, and it ought not to be called a
line, for nothing interposes between them, except the termination of
the one against the other, which being nothing in itself, cannot be
perceivable; therefore the painter ought not to pronounce it in distant
objects.CCLXV./--_Of Back-grounds._


/One/ of the principal parts of painting is the nature and quality of
back-grounds, upon which the extremities of any convex or solid body
will always detach and be distinguished in nature, though the colour
of such objects, and that of the ground, be exactly the same.This
happens, because the convex sides of solid bodies do not receive the
light in the same manner with the ground, for such sides or extremities
are often lighter or darker than the ground.But if such extremities
were to be of the same colour as the ground, and in the same degree
of light, they certainly could not be distinguished.Therefore such a
choice in painting ought to be avoided by all intelligent and judicious
painters; since the intention is to make the objects appear as it were
out of the ground.The above case would produce the contrary effect,
not only in painting, but also in objects of real relievo.CCLXVI./--_How to detach Figures from the Ground._


/All/ solid bodies will appear to have a greater relief, and to come
more out of the canvass, on a ground of an undetermined colour, with
the greatest variety of lights and shades against the confines of
such bodies (as will be demonstrated in its place), provided a proper
diminution of lights in the white tints, and of darkness in the shades,
be judiciously observed.CCLXVII./--_Of Uniformity and Variety of Colours upon plain
Surfaces._


/The/ back-grounds of any flat surfaces which are uniform in colour and
quantity of light, will never appear separated from each other; _vice
versa_, they will appear separated if they are of different colours or
lights.CCLXVIII./--_Of Back-grounds suitable both to Shadows and
Lights._


/The/ shadows or lights which surround figures, or any other objects,
will help the more to detach them the more they differ from the
objects; that is, if a dark colour does not terminate upon another dark
colour, but upon a very different one; as white, or partaking of white,
but lowered, and approximated to the dark shade.CCLXIX./--_The apparent Variation of Colours, occasioned by the
Contraste of the Ground upon which they are placed._


/No/ colour appears uniform and equal in all its parts unless it
terminate on a ground of the same colour.This is very apparent when a
black terminates on a white ground, where the contraste of colour gives
more strength and richness to the extremities than to the middle.CONTRASTE, HARMONY, AND REFLEXES, IN REGARD TO COLOURS.CCLXX./--_Gradation in Painting._


/What/ is fine is not always beautiful and good: I address this to
such painters as are so attached to the beauty of colours, that they
regret being obliged to give them almost imperceptible shadows, not
considering the beautiful relief which figures acquire by a proper
gradation and strength of shadows.Such persons may be compared to
those speakers who in conversation make use of many fine words without
meaning, which altogether scarcely form one good sentence.CCLXXI./--_How to assort Colours in such a Manner as that they
may add Beauty to each other._


/If/ you mean that the proximity of one colour should give beauty to
another that terminates near it, observe the rays of the sun in the
composition of the rainbow, the colours of which are generated by the
falling rain, when each drop in its descent takes every colour of that
bow, as is demonstrated in its place[65].If you mean to represent great darkness, it must be done by contrasting
it with great light; on the contrary, if you want to produce great
brightness, you must oppose to it a very dark shade: so a pale yellow
will cause red to appear more beautiful than if opposed to a purple
colour.There is another rule, by observing which, though you do not increase
the natural beauty of the colours, yet by bringing them together they
may give additional grace to each other, as green placed near red,
while the effect would be quite the reverse, if placed near blue.Harmony and grace are also produced by a judicious arrangement of
colours, such as blue with pale yellow or white, and the like; as will
be noticed in its place.CCLXXII./--_Of detaching the Figures._


/Let/ the colours of which the draperies of your figures are composed,
be such as to form a pleasing variety, to distinguish one from the
other; and although, for the sake of harmony, they should be of the
same nature[66], they must not stick together, but vary in point of
light, according to the distance and interposition of the air between
them.By the same rule, the outlines are to be more precise, or lost,
in proportion to their distance or proximity.CCLXXIII./--_Of the Colour of Reflexes._


/All/ reflected colours are less brilliant and strong, than those which
receive a direct light, in the same proportion as there is between the
light of a body and the cause of that light.CCLXXIV./--_What Body will be the most strongly tinged with the
Colour of any other Object._


/An/ opake surface will partake most of the genuine colour of the body
nearest to it, because a great quantity of the species of colour will
be conveyed to it; whereas such colour would be broken and disturbed if
coming from a more distant object.CCLXXV./--_Of Reflexes._


/Reflexes/ will partake, more or less, both of the colour of the object
which produces them, and of the colour of that object on which they are
produced, in proportion as this latter body is of a smoother or more
polished surface, than that by which they are produced.CCLXXVI./--_Of the Surface of all shadowed Bodies._


/The/ surface of any opake body placed in shadow, will participate of
the colour of any other object which reflects the light upon it.This
is very evident; for if such bodies were deprived of light in the space
between them and the other bodies, they could not shew either shape or
colour.We shall conclude then, that if the opake body be yellow, and
that which reflects the light blue, the part reflected will be green,
because green is composed of blue and yellow.CCLXXVII./--_That no reflected Colour is simple, but is mixed
with the Nature of the other Colours._


/No/ colour reflected upon the surface of another body, will tinge that
surface with its own colour alone, but will be mixed by the concurrence
of other colours also reflected on the same spot.Let us suppose A to
be of a yellow colour, which is reflected on the convex C O E, and that
the blue colour B be reflected on the same place.I say that a mixture
of the blue and yellow colours will tinge the convex surface; and that,
if the ground be white, it will produce a green reflexion, because it
is proved that a mixture of blue and yellow produces a very fine green.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCLXXVIII./--_Of the Colour of Lights and Reflexes._


/When/ two lights strike upon an opake body, they can vary only in
two ways; either they are equal in strength, or they are not.If
they be equal, they may still vary in two other ways, that is, by
the equality or inequality of their brightness; they will be equal,
if their distance be the same; and unequal, if it be otherwise.The
object placed at an equal distance, between two equal lights, in point
both of colour and brightness, may still be enlightened by them in two
different ways, either equally on each side, or unequally.It will be
equally enlightened by them, when the space which remains round the
lights shall be equal in colour, in degree of shade, and in brightness.It will be unequally enlightened by them when the spaces happen to be
of different degrees of darkness.CCLXXIX./--_Why reflected Colours seldom partake of the Colour
of the Body where they meet._


/It/ happens very seldom that the reflexes are of the same colour with
the body from which they proceed, or with that upon which they meet.To exemplify this, let the convex body D F G E be of a yellow colour,
and the body B C, which reflects its colour on it, blue; the part of
the convex surface which is struck by that reflected light, will take
a green tinge, being B C, acted on by the natural light of the air, or

/Chap.CCLXXX./--_The Reflexes of Flesh Colours._


/The/ lights upon the flesh colours, which are reflected by the light
striking upon another flesh-<DW52> body, are redder and more lively
than any other part of the human figure; and that happens according
to the third proposition of the second book[67], which says, the
surface of any opake body participates of the colour of the object
which reflects the light, in proportion as it is near to or remote
from it, and also in proportion to the size of it; because, being
large, it prevents the variety of colours in smaller objects round it,
from interfering with, and discomposing the principal colour, which
is nearer.Nevertheless it does not prevent its participating more of
the colour of a small object near it, than of a large one more remote.See the sixth proposition[68] of perspective, which says, that large
objects may be situated at such a distance as to appear less than small
ones that are near.CCLXXXI./--_Of the Nature of Comparison._


/Black/ draperies will make the flesh of the human figure appear whiter
than in reality it is[69]; and white draperies, on the contrary, will
make it appear darker.Yellow will render it higher, while red
will make it pale.CCLXXXII./--_Where the Reflexes are seen._


/Of/ all reflexions of the same shape, size, and strength, that will be
more or less strong, which terminates on a ground more or less dark.The surface of those bodies will partake most of the colour of the
object that reflects it, which receive that reflexion by the most
nearly equal angles.Of the colours of objects reflected upon any opposite surface by equal
angles, that will be the most distinct which has its reflecting ray the
shortest.Of all colours, reflected under equal angles, and at equal distance
upon the opposite body, those will be the strongest, which come
reflected by the lightest <DW52> body.That object will reflect its own colour most precisely on the opposite
object, which has not round it any colour that clashes with its own;
and consequently that reflected colour will be most confused which
takes its origin from a variety of bodies of different colours.That colour which is nearest the opposed object, will tinge it the most
strongly; and _vice versa_: let the painter, therefore, in his reflexes
on the human body, particularly on the flesh colour, mix some of the
colour of the drapery which comes nearest to it; but not pronounce it
too distinctly, if there be not good reason for it.CCLXXXIII./--_A Precept of Perspective in regard to Painting._


/When/, on account of some particular quality of the air, you can no
longer distinguish the difference between the lights and shadows of
objects, you may reject the perspective of shadows, and make use only
of the linear perspective, and the diminution of colours, to lessen the
knowledge of the objects opposed to the eye; and this, that is to say,
the loss of the knowledge of the figure of each object, will make the
same object appear more remote.The eye can never arrive at a perfect knowledge of the interval between
two objects variously distant, by means of the linear perspective
alone, if not assisted by the perspective of colours.CCLXXXIV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._


/The/ air will participate less of the azure of the sky, in proportion
as it comes nearer to the horizon, as it is proved by the third and
ninth proposition[70], that pure and subtile bodies (such as compose
the air) will be less illuminated by the sun than those of thicker and
grosser substance: and as it is certain that the air which is remote
from the earth, is thinner than that which is near it, it will follow,
that the latter will be more impregnated with the rays of the sun,
which giving light at the same time to an infinity of atoms floating
in this air, renders it more sensible to the eye.So that the air will
appear lighter towards the horizon, and darker as well as bluer in
looking up to the sky; because there is more of the thick air between
our eyes and the horizon, than between our eyes and that part of the
sky above our heads.[Illustration]

For instance: if the eye placed in P, looks through the air along the
line P R, and then lowers itself a little along P S, the air will begin
to appear a little whiter, because there is more of the thick air in
this space than in the first.And if it be still removed lower, so
as to look straight at the horizon, no more of that blue sky will be
perceived which was observable along the first line P R, because there
is a much greater quantity of thick air along the horizontal line P D,
than along the oblique P S, or the perpendicular P R.CCLXXXV./--_The Cause of the Diminution of Colours._


/The/ natural colour of any visible object will be diminished in
proportion to the density of any other substance which interposes
between that object and the eye.CCLXXXVI./--_Of the Diminution of Colours and Objects._


/Let/ the colours vanish in proportion as the objects diminish in size,
according to the distance.CCLXXXVII./--_Of the Variety observable in Colours, according to
their Distance, or Proximity._


/The/ local colour of such objects as are darker than the air, will
appear less dark as they are more remote; and, on the contrary, objects
lighter than the air will lose their brightness in proportion to their
distance from the eye.In general, all objects that are darker or
lighter than the air, are discoloured by distance, which changes their
quality, so that the lighter appears darker, and the darker lighter.CCLXXXVIII./--_At what Distance Colours are entirely lost._


/Local/ colours are entirely lost at a greater or less distance,
according as the eye and the object are more or less elevated from the
earth.This is proved by the seventh proposition[71], which says, the
air is more or less pure, as it is near to, or remote from the earth.If the eye then, and the object are near the earth, the thickness of
the air which interposes, will in a great measure confuse the colour of
that object to the eye.But if the eye and the object are placed high
above the earth, the air will disturb the natural colour of that object
very little.In short, the various gradations of colour depend not only
on the various distances, in which they may be lost; but also on the
variety of lights, which change according to the different hours of the
day, and the thickness or purity of the air, through which the colour
of the object is conveyed to the eye.CCLXXXIX./--_Of the Change observable in the same Colour,
according to its Distance from the Eye._


/Among/ several colours of the same nature, that which is the nearest
to the eye will alter the least; because the air which interposes
between the eye and the object seen, envelopes, in some measure, that
object.If the air, which interposes, be in great quantity, the object
seen will be strongly tinged with the colour of that air; but if the
air be thin, then the view of that object, and its colour, will be very
little obstructed.CCXC./--_Of the blueish Appearance of remote Objects in a
Landscape._


/Whatever/ be the colour of distant objects, the darkest, whether
natural or accidental, will appear the most tinged with azure.By
the natural darkness is meant the proper colour of the object; the
accidental one is produced by the shadow of some other body.CCXCI./--_Of the Qualities in the Surface which first lose
themselves by Distance._


/The/ first part of any colour which is lost by the distance, is the
gloss, being the smallest part of it, as a light within a light.The
second that diminishes by being farther removed, is the light, because
it is less in quantity than the shadow.The third is the principal
shadows, nothing remaining at last but a kind of middling obscurity.CCXCII./--_From what Cause the Azure of the Air proceeds._


/The/ azure of the sky is produced by the transparent body of the
air, illumined by the sun, and interposed between the darkness of the
expanse above, and the earth below.The air in itself has no quality
of smell, taste, or colour, but is easily impregnated with the quality
of other matter surrounding it; and will appear bluer in proportion to
the darkness of the space behind it, as may be observed against the
shady sides of mountains, which are darker than any other object.In
this instance the air appears of the most beautiful azure, while on the
other side that receives the light, it shews through that more of the
natural colour of the mountain.CCXCIII./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._


/The/ same colour being placed at various distances and equal
elevation, the force and effect of its colouring will be according
to the proportion of the distance which there is from each of these
colours to the eye.It is proved thus: let C B E D be one and the same
colour.The first, E, is placed at two degrees of distance from the eye
A; the second, B, shall be four degrees, the third, C, six degrees,
and the fourth, D, eight degrees; as appears by the circles which
terminate upon and intersect the line A R. Let us suppose that the
space A R, S P, is one degree of thin air, and S P E T another degree
of thicker air.It will follow, that the first colour, E, will pass
to the eye through one degree of thick air, E S, and through another
degree, S A, of thinner air.And B will send its colour to the eye in
A, through two degrees of thick air, and through two others of the
thinner sort.C will send it through three degrees of the thin, and
three of the thick sort, while D goes through four degrees of the one,
and four of the other.This demonstrates, that the gradation of colours
is in proportion to their distance from the eye[72].But this happens
only to those colours which are on a level with the eye; as for those
which happen to be at unequal elevations, we cannot observe the same
rule, because they are in that case situated in different qualities of
air, which alter and diminish these colours in various manners.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXCIV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours in dark Places._


/In/ any place where the light diminishes in a gradual proportion till
it terminates in total darkness, the colours also will lose themselves
and be dissolved in proportion as they recede from the eye.CCXCV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._


/The/ principal colours, or those nearest to the eye, should be pure
and simple; and the degree of their diminution should be in proportion
to their distance, viz.the nearer they are to the principal point, the
more they will possess of the purity of those colours, and they will
partake of the colour of the horizon in proportion as they approach to
it.CCXCVI./--_Of Colours._


/Of/ all the colours which are not blue, those that are nearest to
black will, when distant, partake most of the azure; and, on the
contrary, those will preserve their proper colour at the greatest
distance, that are most dissimilar to black.The green therefore of the fields will change sooner into blue than
yellow, or white, which will preserve their natural colour at a greater
distance than that, or even red.CCXCVII./--_How it happens that Colours do not change, though
placed in different Qualities of Air._


/The/ colour will not be subject to any alteration when the distance
and the quality of air have a reciprocal proportion.What it loses by
the distance it regains by the purity of the air, viz.if we suppose
the first or lowest air to have four degrees of thickness, and the
colour to be at one degree from the eye, and the second air above to
have three degrees.The air having lost one degree of thickness, the
colour will acquire one degree upon the distance.And when the air
still higher shall have lost two degrees of thickness, the colour will
acquire as many upon the distance; and in that case the colour will be
the same at three degrees as at one.But to be brief, if the colour be
raised so high as to enter that quality of air which has lost three
degrees of thickness, and acquired three degrees of distance, then you
may be certain that that colour which is high and remote, has lost
no more than the colour which is below and nearer; because in rising
it has acquired those three degrees which it was losing by the same
distance from the eye; and this is what was meant to be proved.CCXCVIII./--_Why Colours experience no apparent Change, though
placed in different Qualities of Air._


[Illustration]

/It/ may happen that a colour does not alter, though placed at
different distances, when the thickness of the air and the distance
are in the same inverse proportion.It is proved thus: let A be the
eye, and H any colour whatever, placed at one degree of distance
from the eye, in a quality of air of four degrees of thickness; but
because the second degree above, A M N L, contains a thinner air by
one half, which air conveys this colour, it follows that this colour
will appear as if removed double the distance it was at before, viz.at two degrees of distance, A F and F G, from the eye; and it will be
placed in G. If that is raised to the second degree of air A M N L, and
to the degree O M, P N, it will necessarily be placed at E, and will
be removed from the eye the whole length of the line A E, which will
be proved in this manner to be equal in thickness to the distance A G.
If in the same quality of air the distance A G interposed between the
eye and the colour occupies two degrees, and A E occupies two degrees
and a half, it is sufficient to preserve the colour G, when raised to
E, from any change, because the degree A C and the degree A F being
the same in thickness, are equal and alike, and the degree C D, though
equal in length to the degree F G, is not alike in point of thickness
of air; because half of it is situated in a degree of air of double the
thickness of the air above: this half degree of distance occupies as
much of the colour as one whole degree of the air above would, which
air above is twice as thin as the air below, with which it terminates;
so that by calculating the thickness of the air, and the distances,
you will find that the colours have changed places without undergoing
any alteration in their beauty.And we shall prove it thus: reckoning
first the thickness of air, the colour H is placed in four degrees of
thickness, the colour G in two degrees, and E at one degree.Now let
us see whether the distances are in an equal inverse proportion; the
colour E is at two degrees and a half of distance, G at two degrees,
and H at one degree.But as this distance has not an exact proportion
with the thickness of air, it is necessary to make a third calculation
in this manner: A C is perfectly like and equal to A F; the half
degree, C B, is like but not equal to A F, because it is only half a
degree in length, which is equal to a whole degree of the quality of
the air above; so that by this calculation we shall solve the question.For A C is equal to two degrees of thickness of the air above, and the
half degree C B is equal to a whole degree of the same air above; and
one degree more is to be taken in, viz.A H has four degrees of thickness of air, A G also four, viz.A F two
in value, and F G also two, which taken together make four.A E has
also four, because A C contains two, and C D one, which is the half
of A C, and in the same quality of air; and there is a whole degree
above in the thin air, which all together make four.So that if A E is
not double the distance A G, nor four times the distance A H, it is
made equivalent by the half degree C B of thick air, which is equal
to a whole degree of thin air above.This proves the truth of the
proposition, that the colour H G E does not undergo any alteration by
these different distances.CCXCIX./--_Contrary Opinions in regard to Objects seen afar off._


/Many/ painters will represent the objects darker, in proportion as
they are removed from the eye; but this cannot be true, unless the
objects seen be white; as shall be examined in the next chapter.CCC./--_Of the Colour of Objects remote from the Eye._


/The/ air tinges objects with its own colour more or less in proportion
to the quantity of intervening air between it and the eye, so that a
dark object at the distance of two miles (or a density of air equal to
such distance), will be more tinged with its colour than if only one
mile distant.It is said, that, in a landscape, trees of the same species appear
darker in the distance than near; this cannot be true, if they be of
equal size, and divided by equal spaces.But it will be so if the
first trees are scattered, and the light of the fields is seen through
and between them, while the others which are farther off, are thick
together, as is often the case near some river or other piece of water:
in this case no space of light fields can be perceived, but the trees
appear thick together, accumulating the shadow on each other.It also
happens, that as the shady parts of plants are much broader than the
light ones, the colour of the plants becoming darker by the multiplied
shadows, is preserved, and conveyed to the eye more strongly than that
of the other parts; these masses, therefore, will carry the strongest
parts of their colour to a greater distance.CCCI./--_Of the Colour of Mountains._


/The/ darker the mountain is in itself, the bluer it will appear at a
great distance.The highest part will be the darkest, as being more
woody; because woods cover a great many shrubs, and other plants,
which never receive any light.The wild plants of those woods are also
naturally of a darker hue than cultivated plants; for oak, beech, fir,
cypress, and pine trees are much darker than olive and other domestic
plants.Near the top of these mountains, where the air is thinner and
purer, the darkness of the woods will make it appear of a deeper azure,
than at the bottom, where the air is thicker.A plant will detach very
little from the ground it stands upon, if that ground be of a colour
something similar to its own; and, _vice versa_, that part of any white
object which is nearest to a dark one, will appear the whitest, and
the less so as it is removed from it; and any dark object will appear
darker, the nearer it is to a white one; and less so, if removed from
it.CCCII./--_Why the Colour and Shape of Objects are lost in some
Situations apparently dark, though not so in Reality._


/There/ are some situations which, though light, appear dark, and in
which objects are deprived both of form and colour.This is caused by
the great light which pervades the intervening air; as is observable by
looking in through a window at some distance from the eye, when nothing
is seen but an uniform darkish shade; but if we enter the house, we
shall find that room to be full of light, and soon distinguish every
small object contained within that window.This difference of effect
is produced by the great brightness of the air, which contracts
considerably the pupil of the eye, and by so doing diminishes its
power.But in dark places the pupil is enlarged, and acquires as much
in strength, as it increases in size.This is proved in my second
proposition of perspective[73].CCCIII./--_Various Precepts in Painting._


/The/ termination and shape of the parts in general are very little
seen, either in great masses of light, or of shadows; but those which
are situated between the extremes of light and shade are the most
distinct.Perspective, as far as it extends in regard to painting, is divided
into three principal parts; the first consists in the diminution of
size, according to distance; the second concerns the diminution of
colours in such objects; and the third treats of the diminution of the
perception altogether of those objects, and of the degree of precision
they ought to exhibit at various distances.The azure of the sky is produced by a mixture composed of light and
darkness[74]; I say of light, because of the moist particles floating
in the air, which reflect the light.By darkness, I mean the pure air,
which has none of these extraneous particles to stop and reflect the
rays.Of this we see an example in the air interposed between the eye
and some dark mountains, rendered so by the shadows of an innumerable
quantity of trees; or else shaded on one side by the natural privation
of the rays of the sun; this air becomes azure, but not so on the side
of the mountain which is light, particularly when it is covered with
snow.Among objects of equal darkness and equal distance, those will appear
darker that terminate upon a lighter ground, and _vice versa_[75].That object which is painted with the most white and the most black,
will shew greater relief than any other; for that reason I would
recommend to painters to colour and dress their figures with the
brightest and most lively colours; for if they are painted of a dull
or obscure colour, they will detach but little, and not be much seen,
when the picture is placed at some distance; because the colour of
every object is obscured in the shades; and if it be represented as
originally so all over, there will be but little difference between
the lights and the shades, while lively colours will shew a striking
difference.CCCIV./--_Aerial Perspective._


/There/ is another kind of perspective called aerial, because by the
difference of the air it is easy to determine the distance of different
objects, though seen on the same line; such, for instance, as buildings
behind a wall, and appearing all of the same height above it.If in
your picture you want to have one appear more distant than another, you
must first suppose the air somewhat thick, because, as we have said
before, in such a kind of air the objects seen at a great distance,
as mountains are, appear blueish like the air, by means of the great
quantity of air that interposes between the eye and such mountains.You will then paint the first building behind that wall of its proper
colour; the next in point of distance, less distinct in the outline,
and participating, in a greater degree, of the blueish colour of the
air; another which you wish to send off as much farther, should be
painted as much bluer; and if you wish one of them to appear five times
farther removed beyond the wall, it must have five times more of the
azure.By this rule these buildings which appeared all of the same
size, and upon the same line, will be distinctly perceived to be of
different dimensions, and at different distances.CCCV./--_The Parts of the Smallest Objects will first disappear
in Painting._


/Of/ objects receding from the eye the smallest will be the first lost
to the sight; from which it follows, that the largest will be the last
to disappear.The painter, therefore, ought not to finish the parts of
those objects which are very far off, but follow the rule given in the
sixth book[76].How many, in the representation of towns, and other objects remote
from the eye, express every part of the buildings in the same manner
as if they were very near.It is not so in nature, because there is no
sight so powerful as to perceive distinctly at any great distance the
precise form of parts or extremities of objects.The painter therefore
who pronounces the outlines, and the minute distinction of parts, as
several have done, will not give the representation of distant objects,
but by this error will make them appear exceedingly near.Again, the
angles of buildings in distant towns are not to be expressed (for they
cannot be seen), considering that angles are formed by the concurrence
of two lines into one point, and that a point has no parts; it is
therefore invisible.CCCVI./--_Small Figures ought not to be too much finished._


/Objects/ appear smaller than they really are when they are distant
from the eye, and because there is a great deal of air interposed,
which weakens the appearance of forms, and, by a natural consequence,
prevents our seeing distinctly the minute parts of such objects.It
behoves the painter therefore to touch those parts slightly, in an
unfinished manner; otherwise it would be against the effect of Nature,
whom he has chosen for his guide.For, as we said before, objects
appear small on account of their great distance from the eye; that
distance includes a great quantity of air, which, forming a dense body,
obstructs the light, and prevents our seeing the minute parts of the
objects.CCCVII./--_Why the Air is to appear whiter as it approaches
nearer to the Earth._


/As/ the air is thicker nearer the earth, and becomes thinner as it
rises, look, when the sun is in the east, towards the west, between the
north and south, and you will perceive that the thickest and lowest air
will receive more light from the sun than the thinner air, because its
beams meet with more resistance.If the sky terminate low, at the end of a plain, that part of it
nearest to the horizon, being seen only through the thick air, will
alter and break its natural colour, and will appear whiter than over
your head, where the visual ray does not pass through so much of that
gross air, corrupted by earthy vapours.But if you turn towards the
east, the air will be darker the nearer it approaches the earth; for
the air being thicker, does not admit the light of the sun to pass so
freely.CCCVIII./--_How to paint the distant Part of a Landscape._


/It/ is evident that the air is in some parts thicker and grosser than
in others, particularly that nearest to the earth; and as it rises
higher, it becomes thinner and more transparent.The objects which
are high and large, from which you are at some distance, will be less
apparent in the lower parts; because the visual ray which perceives
them, passes through a long space of dense air; and it is easy to prove
that the upper parts are seen by a line, which, though on the side of
the eye it originates in a thick air, nevertheless, as it ascends to
the highest summit of its object, terminates in an air much thinner
than that of the lower parts; and for that reason the more that line
or visual ray advances from the eye, it becomes, in its progress
from one point to another, thinner and thinner, passing from a pure
air into another which is purer; so that a painter who has mountains
to represent in a landscape, ought to observe, that from one hill
to another, the tops will appear always clearer than the bases.In
proportion as the distance from one to another is greater, the top will
be clearer; and the higher they are, the more they will shew their
variety of form and colour.CCCIX./--_Of precise and confused Objects._


/The/ parts that are near in the fore-ground should be finished in a
bold determined manner; but those in the distance must be unfinished,
and confused in their outlines.CCCX./--_Of distant Objects._


/That/ part of any object which is nearest to the luminary from which
it receives the light, will be the lightest.The representation of an object in every degree of distance, loses
degrees of its strength; that is, in proportion as the object is more
remote from the eye it will be less perceivable through the air in its
representation.CCCXI./--_Of Buildings seen in a thick Air._


[Illustration]

/That/ part of a building seen through a thick air, will appear less
distinct than another part seen through a thinner air.Therefore the
eye, N, looking at the tower A D, will see it more confusedly in the
lower degrees, but at the same time lighter; and as it ascends to the
other degrees it will appear more distinct, but somewhat darker.CCCXII./--_Of Towns and other Objects seen through a thick Air._


[Illustration]

/Buildings/ or towns seen through a fog, or the air made thick by
smoke or other vapours, will appear less distinct the lower they
are; and, _vice versa_, they will be sharper and more visible in
proportion as they are higher.We have said, in Chapter cccxxi.that
the air is thicker the lower it is, and thinner as it is higher.It is
demonstrated also by the cut, where the tower, A F, is seen by the eye
N, in a thick air, from B to F, which is divided into four degrees,
growing thicker as they are nearer the bottom.The less the quantity of
air interposed between the eye and its object is, the less also will
the colour of the object participate of the colour of that air.It
follows, that the greater the quantity of the air interposed between
the eye and the object seen, is, the more this object will participate
of the colour of the air.It is demonstrated thus: N being the eye
looking at the five parts of the tower A F, viz.A B C D E, I say,
that if the air were of the same thickness, there would be the same
proportion between the colour of the air at the bottom of the tower and
the colour of the air that the same tower has at the place B, as there
is in length between the line M and F. As, however, we have supposed
that the air is not of equal thickness, but, on the contrary, thicker
as it is lower, it follows, that the proportion by which the air tinges
the different elevations of the tower B C F, exceeds the proportion
of the lines; because the line M F, besides its being longer than the
line S B, passes by unequal degrees through a quality of air which is
unequal in thickness.CCCXIII./--_Of the inferior Extremities of distant Objects._


/The/ inferior or lower extremities of distant objects are not so
apparent as the upper extremities.This is observable in mountains
and hills, the tops of which detach from the sides of other mountains
behind.We see the tops of these more determined and distinctly than
their bases; because the upper extremities are darker, being less
encompassed by thick air, which always remains in the lower regions,
and makes them appear dim and confused.It is the same with trees,
buildings, and other objects high up.From this effect it often happens
that a high tower, seen at a great distance, will appear broad at top,
and narrow at bottom; because the thin air towards the top does not
prevent the angles on the sides and other different parts of the tower
from being seen, as the thick air does at bottom.This is demonstrated
by the seventh proposition[77], which says, that the thick air
interposed between the eye and the sun, is lighter below than above,
and where the air is whiteish, it confuses the dark objects more than if
such air were blueish or thinner, as it is higher up.The battlements
of a fortress have the spaces between equal to the breadth of the
battlement, and yet the space will appear wider; at a great distance
the battlements will appear very much diminished, and being removed
still farther, will disappear entirely, and the fort shew only the
straight wall, as if there were no battlements.CCCXIV./--_Which Parts of Objects disappear first by being
removed farther from the Eye, and which preserve their Appearance._


/The/ smallest parts are those which, by being removed, lose their
appearance first; this may be observed in the gloss upon spherical
bodies, or columns, and the slender parts of animals; as in a stag,
the first sight of which does not discover its legs and horns so soon
as its body, which, being broader, will be perceived from a greater
distance.But the parts which disappear the very first, are the lines
which describe the members, and terminate the surface and shape of
bodies.CCCXV./--_Why Objects are less distinguished in proportion as
they are farther removed from the Eye._


/This/ happens because the smallest parts are lost first; the second,
in point of size, are also lost at a somewhat greater distance, and so
on successively; the parts by degrees melting away, the perception of
the object is diminished; and at last all the parts, and the whole, are
entirely lost to the sight[78].Colours also disappear on account of
the density of the air interposed between the eye and the object.CCCXVI./--_Why Faces appear dark at a Distance._


/It/ is evident that the similitude of all objects placed before us,
large as well as small, is perceptible to our senses through the iris
of the eye.If through so small an entrance the immensity of the sky
and of the earth is admitted, the faces of men (which are scarcely any
thing in comparison of such large objects), being still diminished by
the distance, will occupy so little of the eye, that they become almost
imperceptible.Besides, having to pass through a dark medium from the
surface to the _Retina_ in the inside, where the impression is made,
the colour of faces (not being very strong, and rendered still more
obscure by the darkness of the tube) when arrived at the focus appears
dark.No other reason can be given on that point, except that the speck
in the middle of the apple of the eye is black, and, being full of a
transparent fluid like air, performs the same office as a hole in a
board, which on looking into it appears black; and that those things
which are seen through both a light and dark air, become confused and
obscure.CCCXVII./--_Of Towns and other Buildings seen through a Fog in
the Morning or Evening._


/Buildings/ seen afar off in the morning or in the evening, when there
is a fog, or thick air, shew only those parts distinctly which are
enlightened by the sun towards the horizon; and the parts of those
buildings which are not turned towards the sun remain confused and
almost of the colour of the fog.CCCXVIII./--_Of the Height of Buildings seen in a Fog._


/Of/ a building near the eye the top parts will appear more confused
than the bottom, because there is more fog between the eye and the top
than at the base.And a square tower, seen at a great distance through
a fog, will appear narrower at the base than at the summit.This is
accounted for in Chapter cccxiii.which says, that the fog will appear
whiter and thicker as it approaches the ground; and as it is said
before[79], that a dark object will appear smaller in proportion as it
is placed on a whiter ground.Therefore the fog being whiter at bottom
than at top, it follows that the tower (being darkish) will appear
narrower at the base than at the summit.CCCXIX./--_Why Objects which are high, appear darker at a
Distance than those which are low, though the Fog be uniform, and of
equal Thickness._


/Amongst/ objects situated in a fog, thick air, vapour, smoke, or at
a distance, the highest will be the most distinctly seen: and amongst
objects equal in height, that placed in the darkest fog, will be most
confused and dark.As it happens to the eye H, looking at A B C, three
towers of equal height; it sees the top C as low as R, in two degrees
of thickness; and the top B, in one degree only; therefore the top C
will appear darker than the top of the tower B.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXX./--_Of Objects seen in a Fog._


/Objects/ seen through a fog will appear larger than they are in
reality, because the aerial perspective does not agree with the linear,
viz.the colour does not agree with the magnitude of the object[80];
such a fog being similar to the thickness of air interposed between the
eye and the horizon in fine weather.But in this case the fog is near
the eye, and though the object be also near, it makes it appear as if
it were as far off as the horizon; where a great tower would appear no
bigger than a man placed near the eye.CCCXXI./--_Of those Objects which the Eyes perceive through a
Mist or thick Air._


/The/ nearer the air is to water, or to the ground, the thicker it
becomes.It is proved by the nineteenth proposition of the second
book[81], that bodies rise in proportion to their weight; and it
follows, that a light body will rise higher than another which is heavy.CCCXXII./--_Miscellaneous Observations._


/Of/ different objects equal in magnitude, form, shade, and distance
from the eye, those will appear the smaller that are placed on the
lighter ground.This is exemplified by observing the sun when seen
behind a tree without leaves; all the ramifications seen against that
great light are so diminished that they remain almost invisible.The
same may be observed of a pole placed between the sun and the eye.Parallel bodies placed upright, and seen through a fog, will
appear larger at top than at bottom.This is proved by the ninth
proposition[82], which says, that a fog, or thick air, penetrated by
the rays of the sun, will appear whiter the lower they are.Things seen afar off will appear out of proportion, because the parts
which are the lightest will send their image with stronger rays than
the parts which are darkest.I have seen a woman dressed in black,
with a white veil over her head, which appeared twice as large as her
shoulders covered with black.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.CCCXXIII./--_Of Objects seen at a Distance._


/Any/ dark object will appear lighter when removed to some distance
from the eye.It follows, by the contrary reason, that a dark object
will appear still darker when brought nearer to the eye.Therefore the
inferior parts of any object whatever, placed in thick air, will appear
farther from the eye at the bottom than at the top; for that reason the
lower parts of a mountain appear farther off than its top, which is in
reality the farthest.CCCXXIV./--_Of a Town seen through a thick Air._


/The/ eye which, looking downwards, sees a town immersed in very thick
air, will perceive the top of the buildings darker, but more distinct
than the bottom.The tops detach against a light ground, because they
are seen against the low and thick air which is beyond them.This is a
consequence of what has been explained in the preceding chapter.CCCXXV./--_How to draw a Landscape._


/Contrive/ that the trees in your landscape be half in shadow and half
in the light.It is better to represent them as when the sun is veiled
with thin clouds, because in that case the trees receive a general
light from the sky, and are darkest in those parts which are nearest to
the earth.CCCXXVI./--_Of the Green of the Country._


/Of/ the greens seen in the country, that of trees and other plants
will appear darker than that of fields and meadows, though they may
happen to be of the same quality.CCCXXVII./--_What Greens will appear most of a blueish Cast._


/Those/ greens will appear to approach nearest to blue which are
of the darkest shade when remote.This is proved by the seventh
proposition[83], which says, that blue is composed of black and white
seen at a great distance.CCCXXVIII./--_The Colour of the Sea from different Aspects._


/When/ the sea is a little ruffled it has no sameness of colour; for
whoever looks at it from the shore, will see it of a dark colour, in a
greater degree as it approaches towards the horizon, and will perceive
also certain lights moving slowly on the surface like a flock of sheep.Whoever looks at the sea from on board a ship, at a distance from the
land, sees it blue.Near the shore it appears darkish, on account of
the colour of the earth reflected by the water, as in a looking-glass;
but at sea the azure of the air is reflected to the eye by the waves in
the same manner.CCCXXIX./--_Why the same Prospect appears larger at some Times
than at others._


/Objects/ in the country appear sometimes larger and sometimes smaller
than they actually are, from the circumstance of the air interposed
between the eye and the horizon, happening to be either thicker or
thinner than usual.Of two horizons equally distant from the eye, that which is seen
through the thicker air will appear farther removed; and the other will
seem nearer, being seen through a thinner air.Objects of unequal size, but equally distant, will appear equal if the
air which is between them and the eye be of proportionable inequality
of thickness, viz.if the thickest air be interposed between the eye
and the smallest of the objects.This is proved by the perspective of
colours[84], which is so deceitful that a mountain which would appear
small by the compasses, will seem larger than a small hill near the
eye; as a finger placed near the eye will cover a large mountain far
off.CCCXXX./--_Of Smoke._


/Smoke/ is more transparent, though darker towards the extremities of
its waves than in the middle.It moves in a more oblique direction in proportion to the force of the
wind which impels it.Different kinds of smoke vary in colour, as the causes that produce
them are various.Smoke never produces determined shadows, and the extremities are lost
as they recede from their primary cause.Objects behind it are less
apparent in proportion to the thickness of the smoke.It is whiter
nearer its origin, and bluer towards its termination.Fire appears darker, the more smoke there is interposed between it and
the eye.Where smoke is farther distant, the objects are less confused by it.It encumbers and dims all the landscape like a fog.Smoke is seen to
issue from different places, with flames at the origin, and the most
dense part of it.The tops of mountains will be more seen than the
lower parts, as in a fog.CCCXXXI./--_In what Part Smoke is lightest._


/Smoke/ which is seen between the sun and the eye will be lighter and
more transparent than any other in the landscape.The same is observed
of dust, and of fog; while, if you place yourself between the sun and
those objects, they will appear dark.CCCXXXII./--_Of the Sun-beams passing through the Openings of
Clouds._


/The/ sun-beams which penetrate the openings interposed between clouds
of various density and form, illuminate all the places over which they
pass, and tinge with their own colour all the dark places that are
behind: which dark places are only seen in the intervals between the
rays.CCCXXXIII./--_Of the Beginning of Rain._


/When/ the rain begins to fall, it tarnishes and darkens the air,
giving it a dull colour, but receives still on one side a faint light
from the sun, and is shaded on the other side, as we observe in clouds;
till at last it darkens also the earth, depriving it entirely of the
light of the sun.Objects seen through the rain appear confused and of
undetermined shape, but those which are near will be more distinct.It
is observable, that on the side where the rain is shaded, objects will
be more clearly distinguished than where it receives the light; because
on the shady side they lose only their principal lights, whilst on
the other they lose both their lights and shadows, the lights mixing
with the light part of the rain, and the shadows are also considerably
weakened by it.CCCXXXIV./--_The Seasons are to be observed._


/In/ Autumn you will represent the objects according as it is more or
less advanced.At the beginning of it the leaves of the oldest branches
only begin to fade, more or less, however, according as the plant is
situated in a fertile or barren country; and do not imitate those who
represent trees of every kind (though at equal distance) with the same
quality of green.Endeavour to vary the colour of meadows, stones,
trunks of trees, and all other objects, as much as possible, for Nature
abounds in variety _ad infinitum_.CCCXXXV./--_The Difference of Climates to be observed._


/Near/ the sea-shore, and in southern parts, you will be careful not to
represent the Winter season by the appearance of trees and fields, as
you would do in places more inland, and in northern countries, except
when these are covered with ever-greens, which shoot afresh all the
year round.CCCXXXVI./--_Of Dust._


/Dust/ becomes lighter the higher it rises, and appears darker the less
it is raised, when it is seen between the eye and the sun.CCCXXXVII./--_How to represent the Wind._


/In/ representing the effect of the wind, besides the bending of trees,
and leaves twisting the wrong side upwards, you will also express the
small dust whirling upwards till it mixes in a confused manner with the
air.CCCXXXVIII./--_Of a Wilderness._


/Those/ trees and shrubs which are by their nature more loaded with
small branches, ought to be touched smartly in the shadows, but those
which have larger foliage, will cause broader shadows.CCCXXXIX./--_Of the Horizon seen in the Water._


/By/ the sixth proposition[85], the horizon will be seen in the water
as in a looking-glass, on that side which is opposite the eye.And
if the painter has to represent a spot covered with water, let him
remember that the colour of it cannot be either lighter or darker than
that of the neighbouring objects.CCCXL./--_Of the Shadow of Bridges on the Surface of the Water._


/The/ shadows of bridges can never be seen on the surface of the water,
unless it should have lost its transparent and reflecting quality,
and become troubled and muddy; because clear water being polished and
smooth on its surface, the image of the bridge is formed in it as in
a looking-glass, and reflected in all the points situated between the
eye and the bridge at equal angles; and even the air is seen under the
arches.These circumstances cannot happen when the water is muddy,
because it does not reflect the objects any longer, but receives the
shadow of the bridge in the same manner as a dusty road would receive
it.CCCXLI./--_How a Painter ought to put in Practice the
Perspective of Colours._


/To/ put in practice that perspective which teaches the alteration, the
lessening, and even the entire loss of the very essence of colours,
you must take some points in the country at the distance of about
sixty-five yards[86] from each other; as trees, men, or some other
remarkable objects.In regard to the first tree, you will take a glass,
and having fixed that well, and also your eye, draw upon it, with the
greatest accuracy, the tree you see through it; then put it a little
on one side, and compare it closely with the natural one, and colour
it, so that in shape and colour it may resemble the original, and that
by shutting one eye they may both appear painted, and at the same
distance.The same rule may be applied to the second and third tree
at the distance you have fixed.These studies will be very useful if
managed with judgment, where they may be wanted in the offscape of a
picture.I have observed that the second tree is less by four fifths
than the first, at the distance of thirteen yards.CCCXLII./--_Various Precepts in Painting._


/The/ superficies of any opake body participates of the colour of the
transparent medium interposed between the eye and such body, in a
greater or less degree, in proportion to the density of such medium and
the space it occupies.The outlines of opake bodies will be less apparent in proportion as
those bodies are farther distant from the eye.That part of the opake body will be the most shaded, or lightest, which
is nearest to the body that shades it, or gives it light.The surface of any opake body participates more or less of the colour
of that body which gives it light, in proportion as the latter is more
or less remote, or more or less strong.Objects seen between lights and shadows will appear to have greater
relievo than those which are placed wholly in the light, or wholly in
shadow.When you give strength and precision to objects seen at a great
distance, they will appear as if they were very near.Endeavour that
your imitation be such as to give a just idea of distances.If the
object in nature appear confused in the outlines, let the same be
observed in your picture.The outlines of distant objects appear undetermined and confused,
for two reasons: the first is, that they come to the eye by so small
an angle, and are therefore so much diminished, that they strike the
sight no more than small objects do, which though near can hardly be
distinguished, such as the nails of the fingers, insects, and other
similar things: the second is, that between the eye and the distant
objects there is so much air interposed, that it becomes thick; and,
like a veil, tinges the shadows with its own whiteness, and turns them
from a dark colour to another between black and white, such as azure.Although, by reason of the great distance, the appearance of many
things is lost, yet those things which receive the light from the sun
will be more discernible, while the rest remain enveloped in confused
shadows.And because the air is thicker near the ground, the things
which are lower will appear confused; and _vice versa_.When the sun tinges the clouds on the horizon with red, those objects
which, on account of their distance, appear blueish, will participate
of that redness, and will produce a mixture between the azure and red,
which renders the prospect lively and pleasant; all the opake bodies
which receive that light will appear distinct, and of a reddish colour,
and the air, being transparent, will be impregnated with it, and appear
of the colour of lilies[87].The air which is between the earth and the sun when it rises or sets,
will always dim the objects it surrounds, more than the air any where
else, because it is whiter.It is not necessary to mark strongly the outlines of any object which
is placed upon another.If the outline or extremity of a white and curved surface terminate
upon another white body, it will have a shade at that extremity, darker
than any part of the light; but if against a dark object, such outline,
or extremity, will be lighter than any part of the light.Those objects which are most different in colour, will appear the most
detached from each other.Those parts of objects which first disappear in the distance, are
extremities similar in colour, and ending one upon the other, as the
extremities of an oak tree upon another oak similar to it.The next to
disappear at a greater distance are, objects of mixed colours, when
they terminate one upon the other, as trees, ploughed fields, walls,
heaps of rubbish, or of stones.The last extremities of bodies that
vanish are those which, being light, terminate upon a dark ground; or
being dark, upon a light ground.Of objects situated above the eye, at equal heights, the farthest
removed from the eye will appear the lowest; and if situated below
the eye, the nearest to it will appear the lowest.The parallel lines
situated sidewise will concur to one point[88].Those objects which are near a river, or a lake, in the distant part of
a landscape, are less apparent and distinct than those that are remote
from them.Of bodies of equal density, those that are nearest to the eye will
appear thinnest, and the most remote thickest.A large eye-ball will see objects larger than a small one.The
experiment may be made by looking at any of the celestial bodies,
through a pin-hole, which being capable of admitting but a portion
of its light, it seems to diminish and lose of its size in the same
proportion as the pin-hole is smaller than the usual apparent size of
the object.A thick air interposed between the eye and any object, will render the
outlines of such object undetermined and confused, and make it appear
of a larger size than it is in reality; because the linear perspective
does not diminish the angle which conveys the object to the eye.The
aerial perspective carries it farther off, so that the one removes it
from the eye, while the other preserves its magnitude[89].When the sun is in the West the vapours of the earth fall down again
and thicken the air, so that objects not enlightened by the sun remain
dark and confused, but those which receive its light will be tinged
yellow and red, according to the sun's appearance on the horizon.Again, those that receive its light are very distinct, particularly
public buildings and houses in towns and villages, because their
shadows are dark, and it seems as if those parts which are plainly seen
were coming out of confused and undetermined foundations, because at
that time every thing is of one and the same colour, except what is
enlightened by the sun[90].Any object receiving the light from the sun, receives also the general
light; so that two kinds of shadows are produced: the darkest of the
two is that which happens to have its central line directed towards the
centre of the sun.The central lines of the primitive and secondary
lights are the same as the central lines of the primitive and secondary
shadows.The setting sun is a beautiful and magnificent object when it tinges
with its colour all the great buildings of towns, villages, and the top
of high trees in the country.All below is confused and almost lost in
a tender and general mass; for, being only enlightened by the air, the
difference between the shadows and the lights is small, and for that
reason it is not much detached.But those that are high are touched
by the rays of the sun, and, as was said before, are tinged with its
colour; the painter therefore ought to take the same colour with which
he has painted the sun, and employ it in all those parts of his work
which receive its light.It also happens very often, that a cloud will appear dark without
receiving any shadow from a separate cloud, according to the situation
of the eye; because it will see only the shady part of the one, while
it sees both the enlightened and shady parts of the other.Of two objects at equal height, that which is the farthest off will
appear the lowest.Observe the first cloud in the cut, though it
is lower than the second, it appears as if it were higher.This is
demonstrated by the section of the pyramidical rays of the low cloud at
M A, and the second (which is higher) at N M, below M A. This happens
also when, on account of the rays of the setting or rising sun, a dark
cloud appears higher than another which is light.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLIII./--_The Brilliancy of a Landscape._


/The/ vivacity and brightness of colours in a landscape will never bear
any comparison with a landscape in nature when illumined by the sun,
unless the picture be placed so as to receive the same light from the
sun itself.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.CCCXLIV./--_Why a painted Object does not appear so far distant
as a real one, though they be conveyed to the Eye by equal Angles._


[Illustration]

/If/ a house be painted on the pannel B C, at the apparent distance of
one mile, and by the side of it a real one be perceived at the true
distance of one mile also; which objects are so disposed, that the
pannel, or picture, A C, intersects the pyramidical rays with the same
opening of angles; yet these two objects will never appear of the same
size, nor at the same distance, if seen with both eyes[91].CCCXLV./--_How to draw a Figure standing upon its Feet, to
appear forty Braccia_[92] _high, in a Space of twenty Braccia, with
proportionate Members._


/In/ this, as in any other case, the painter is not to mind what kind
of surface he has to work upon; particularly if his painting is to be
seen from a determined point, such as a window, or any other opening.Because the eye is not to attend to the evenness or roughness of the
wall, but only to what is to be represented as beyond that wall; such
as a landscape, or any thing else.Nevertheless a curved surface, such
as F R G, would be the best, because it has no angles.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLVI./--_How to draw a Figure twenty-four Braccia high, upon
a Wall twelve Braccia high._ Plate XXII./Draw/ upon part of the wall M N, half the figure you mean to
represent; and the other half upon the cove above, M R. But before
that, it will be necessary to draw upon a flat board, or a paper, the
profile of the wall and cove, of the same shape and dimension, as that
upon which you are to paint.Then draw also the profile of your figure,
of whatever size you please, by the side of it; draw all the lines to
the point F, and where they intersect the profile M R, you will have
the dimensions of your figure as they ought to be drawn upon the real
spot.You will find, that on the straight part of the wall M N, it will
come of its proper form, because the going off perpendicularly will
diminish it naturally; but that part which comes upon the curve will be
diminished upon your drawing.The whole must be traced afterwards upon
the real spot, which is similar to M N. This is a good and safe method._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.CCCXLVII./--_Why, on measuring a Face, and then painting it of
the same Size, it will appear larger than the natural one._


A B is the breadth of the space, or of the head, and it is placed on
the paper at the distance C F, where the cheeks are, and it would have
to stand back all A C, and then the temples would be carried to the
distance O R of the lines A F, B F; so that there is the difference C
O and R D. It follows that the line C F, and the line D F, in order
to become shorter[93], have to go and find the paper where the whole
height is drawn, that is to say, the lines F A, and F B, where the true
size is; and so it makes the difference, as I have said, of C O, and R
D.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLVIII./--_Why the most perfect Imitation of Nature will not
appear to have the same Relief as Nature itself._


/If/ nature is seen with two eyes, it will be impossible to imitate it
upon a picture so as to appear with the same relief, though the lines,
the lights, shades, and colour, be perfectly imitated[94].It is proved
thus: let the eyes A B, look at the object C, with the concurrence of
both the central visual rays A C and B C. I say, that the sides of the
visual angles (which contain these central rays) will see the space G
D, behind the object C. The eye A will see all the space FD, and the
eye B all the space G E. Therefore the two eyes will see behind the
object C all the space F E; for which reason that object C becomes as
it were transparent, according to the definition of transparent bodies,
behind which nothing is hidden.This cannot happen if an object were
seen with one eye only, provided it be larger than the eye.From all
that has been said, we may conclude, that a painted object, occupying
all the space it has behind, leaves no possible way to see any part of
the ground, which it covers entirely by its own circumference[95].[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLIX./--_Universality of Painting; a Precept._


/A painter/ cannot be said to aim at universality in the art, unless
he love equally every species of that art.For instance, if he delight
only in landscape, his can be esteemed only as a simple investigation;
and, as our friend Botticello[96] remarks, is but a vain study; since,
by throwing a sponge impregnated with various colours against a wall,
it leaves some spots upon it, which may appear like a landscape.It is
true also, that a variety of compositions may be seen in such spots,
according to the disposition of mind with which they are considered;
such as heads of men, various animals, battles, rocky scenes, seas,
clouds, woods, and the like.It may be compared to the sound of bells,
which may seem to say whatever we choose to imagine.In the same manner
also, those spots may furnish hints for compositions, though they do
not teach us how to finish any particular part; and the imitators of
them are but sorry landscape-painters.CCCL./--_In what Manner the Mirror is the true Master of
Painters._


/When/ you wish to know if your picture be like the object you mean to
represent, have a flat looking-glass, and place it so as to reflect the
object you have imitated, and compare carefully the original with the
copy.You see upon a flat mirror the representation of things which
appear real; Painting is the same.They are both an even superficies,
and both give the idea of something beyond their superficies.Since you
are persuaded that the looking-glass, by means of lines and shades,
gives you the representation of things as if they were real; you being
in possession of colours which in their different lights and shades are
stronger than those of the looking-glass, may certainly, if you employ
the rules with judgment, give to your picture the same appearance of
Nature as you admire in the looking-glass.Or rather, your picture will
be like Nature itself seen in a large looking-glass.This looking-glass (being your master) will shew you the lights and
shades of any object whatever.Amongst your colours there are some
lighter than the lightest part of your model, and also some darker
than the strongest shades; from which it follows, that you ought to
represent Nature as seen in your looking-glass, when you look at it
with one eye only; because both eyes surround the objects too much,
particularly when they are small[97].CCCLI./--_Which Painting is to be esteemed the best._


/That/ painting is the most commendable which has the greatest
conformity to what is meant to be imitated.This kind of comparison
will often put to shame a certain description of painters, who pretend
they can mend the works of Nature; as they do, for instance, when
they pretend to represent a child twelve months old, giving him eight
heads in height, when Nature in its best proportion admits but five.The breadth of the shoulders also, which is equal to the head, they
make double, giving to a child a year old, the proportions of a man of
thirty.They have so often practised, and seen others practise these
errors, that they have converted them into habit, which has taken so
deep a root in their corrupted judgment, that they persuade themselves
that Nature and her imitators are wrong in not following their own
practice[98].CCCLII./--_Of the Judgment to be made of a Painter's Work._


/The/ first thing to be considered is, whether the figures have their
proper relief, according to their respective situations, and the light
they are in: that the shadows be not the same at the extremities of
the groups, as in the middle; because being surrounded by shadows, or
shaded only on one side, produce very different effects.The groups in
the middle are surrounded by shadows from the other figures, which are
between them and the light.Those which are at the extremities have
the shadows only on one side, and receive the light on the other.The
strongest and smartest touches of shadows are to be in the interstice
between the figures of the principal group where the light cannot
penetrate[99].Secondly, that by the order and disposition of the figures they appear
to be accommodated to the subject, and the true representation of the
history in question.Thirdly, that the figures appear alive to the occasion which brought
them together, with expressions suited to their attitudes.CCCLIII./--_How to make an imaginary Animal appear natural._


/It/ is evident that it will be impossible to invent any animal without
giving it members, and these members must individually resemble those
of some known animal.If you wish, therefore, to make a chimera, or imaginary animal, appear
natural (let us suppose a serpent); take the head of a mastiff, the
eyes of a cat, the ears of a porcupine, the mouth of a hare, the
brows of a lion, the temples of an old cock, and the neck of a sea
tortoise[100].CCCLIV./--_Painters are not to imitate one another._


/One/ painter ought never to imitate the manner of any other; because
in that case he cannot be called the child of Nature, but the
grandchild.It is always best to have recourse to Nature, which is
replete with such abundance of objects, than to the productions of
other masters, who learnt every thing from her.CCCLV./--_How to judge of one's own Work._


/It/ is an acknowledged fact, that we perceive errors in the works of
others more readily than in our own.A painter, therefore, ought to
be well instructed in perspective, and acquire a perfect knowledge of
the dimensions of the human body; he should also be a good architect,
at least as far as concerns the outward shape of buildings, with their
different parts; and where he is deficient, he ought not to neglect
taking drawings from Nature.It will be well also to have a looking-glass by him, when he paints,
to look often at his work in it, which being seen the contrary way,
will appear as the work of another hand, and will better shew his
faults.It will be useful also to quit his work often, and take some
relaxation, that his judgment may be clearer at his return; for too
great application and sitting still is sometimes the cause of many
gross errors.CCCLVI./--_Of correcting Errors which you discover._


/Remember/, that when, by the exercise of your own judgment, or the
observation of others, you discover any errors in your work, you
immediately set about correcting them, lest, in exposing your works to
the public, you expose your defects also.Admit not any self-excuse,
by persuading yourself that you shall retrieve your character, and
that by some succeeding work you shall make amends for your shameful
negligence; for your work does not perish as soon as it is out of your
hands, like the sound of music, but remains a standing monument of your
ignorance.If you excuse yourself by saying that you have not time for
the study necessary to form a great painter, having to struggle against
necessity, you yourself are only to blame; for the study of what is
excellent is food both for mind and body.How many philosophers, born
to great riches, have given them away, that they might not be retarded
in their pursuits!CCCLVII./--_The best Place for looking at a Picture._


/Let/ us suppose, that A B is the picture, receiving the light from D;
I say, that whoever is placed between C and E, will see the picture
very badly, particularly if it be painted in oil, or varnished; because
it will shine, and will appear almost of the nature of a looking-glass.For these reasons, the nearer you go towards C, the less you will be
able to see, because of the light from the window upon the picture,
sending its reflection to that point.But if you place yourself between
E D, you may conveniently see the picture, and the more so as you draw
nearer to the point D, because that place is less liable to be struck
by the reflected rays.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCLVIII./--_Of Judgment._


/There/ is nothing more apt to deceive us than our own judgment, in
deciding on our own works; and we should derive more advantage from
having our faults pointed out by our enemies, than by hearing the
opinions of our friends, because they are too much like ourselves, and
may deceive us as much as our own judgment.CCCLIX./--_Of Employment anxiously wished for by Painters._


/And/ you, painter, who are desirous of great practice, understand,
that if you do not rest it on the good foundation of Nature, you will
labour with little honour and less profit; and if you do it on a good
ground your works will be many and good, to your great honour and
advantage.CCCLX./--_Advice to Painters._


/A painter/ ought to study universal Nature, and reason much within
himself on all he sees, making use of the most excellent parts that
compose the species of every object before him.His mind will by this
method be like a mirror, reflecting truly every object placed before
it, and become, as it were, a second Nature.CCCLXI./--_Of Statuary._


/To/ execute a figure in marble, you must first make a model of it in
clay, or plaster, and when it is finished, place it in a square case,
equally capable of receiving the block of marble intended to be shaped
like it.Have some peg-like sticks to pass through holes made in the
sides, and all round the case; push them in till every one touches the
model, marking what remains of the sticks outwards with ink, and making
a countermark to every stick and its hole, so that you may at pleasure
replace them again.Then having taken out the model, and placed the
block of marble in its stead, take so much out of it, till all the pegs
go in at the same holes to the marks you had made.To facilitate the
work, contrive your frame so that every part of it, separately, or all
together, may be lifted up, except the bottom, which must remain under
the marble.By this method you may chop it off with great facility[101].CCCLXII./--_On the Measurement and Division of Statues into
Parts._


/Divide/ the head into twelve parts, each part into twelve degrees,
each degree into twelve minutes, and these minutes into seconds[102].CCCLXIII./--_A Precept for the Painter._


/The/ painter who entertains no doubt of his own ability, will attain
very little.When the work succeeds beyond the judgment, the artist
acquires nothing; but when the judgment is superior to the work, he
never ceases improving, if the love of gain do not <DW44> his progress.CCCLXIV./--_On the Judgment of Painters._


/When/ the work is equal to the knowledge and judgment of the painter,
it is a bad sign; and when it surpasses the judgment, it is still
worse, as is the case with those who wonder at having succeeded so
well.But when the judgment surpasses the work, it is a perfectly good
sign; and the young painter who possesses that rare disposition, will,
no doubt, arrive at great perfection.He will produce few works, but
they will be such as to fix the admiration of every beholder.CCCLXV./--_That a Man ought not to trust to himself, but ought
to consult Nature._


/Whoever/ flatters himself that he can retain in his memory all the
effects of Nature, is deceived, for our memory is not so capacious;
therefore consult Nature for every thing.BOOKS

and supposed to require, that the student should be a deep proficient
in perspective, before he commences the study of painting; but it is
a knowledge of the leading principles only of perspective that the
author here means, and without such a knowledge, which is easily to be
acquired, the student will inevitably fall into errors, as gross as
those humorously pointed out by Hogarth, in his Frontispiece to Kirby's
Perspective.][Footnote 3: Not to be found in this work.][Footnote 4: From this, and many other similar passages, it is evident,
that the author intended at some future time to arrange his manuscript
collections, and to publish them as separate treatises.That he did not
do so is well known; but it is also a fact, that, in selecting from the
whole mass of his collections the chapters of which the present work
consists, great care appears in general to have been taken to extract
also those to which there was any reference from any of the chapters
intended for this work, or which from their subject were necessarily
connected with them.Accordingly, the reader will find, in the notes
to this translation, that all such chapters in any other part of the
present work are uniformly pointed out, as have any relation to the
respective passages in the text.This, which has never before been
done, though indispensably necessary, will be found of singular use,
and it was thought proper here, once for all, to notice it.In the present instance the chapters, referring to the subject in the
text, are Chap.; and though these
do not afford complete information, yet it is to be remembered, that
drawing from relievos is subject to the very same rules as drawing from
Nature; and that, therefore, what is elsewhere said on that subject is
also equally applicable to this.][Footnote 5: The meaning of this is, that the last touches of light,
such as the shining parts (which are always narrow), must be given
sparingly.In short, that the drawing must be kept in broad masses as
much as possible.][Footnote 6: This is not an absolute rule, but it is a very good one
for drawing of portraits.][Footnote 9: See the two preceding chapters.][Footnote 10: Man being the highest of the animal creation, ought to be
the chief object of study.][Footnote 11: An intended Treatise, as it seems, on Anatomy, which
however never was published; but there are several chapters in the
present work on the subject of Anatomy, most of which will be found
under the present head of Anatomy; and of such as could not be placed
there, because they also related to some other branch, the following
is a list by which they may be found: Chapters vi.[Footnote 13: It does not appear that this intention was ever carried
into execution; but there are many chapters in this work on the subject
of motion, where all that is necessary for a painter in this branch
will be found.][Footnote 14: Anatomists have divided this muscle into four or five
sections; but painters, following the ancient sculptors, shew only
the three principal ones; and, in fact, we find that a greater number
of them (as may often be observed in nature) gives a disagreeable
meagreness to the subject.Beautiful nature does not shew more than
three, though there may be more hid under the skin.][Footnote 15: A treatise on weights, like many others, intended by this
author, but never published.][Footnote 17: It is believed that this treatise, like many others
promised by the author, was never written; and to save the necessity of
frequently repeating this fact, the reader is here informed, once for
all, that in the life of the author prefixed to this edition, will be
found an account of the works promised or projected by him, and how far
his intentions have been carried into effect.][Footnote 19: See in this work from chap.[Footnote 22: The author here means to compare the different quickness
of the motion of the head and the heel, when employed in the same
action of jumping; and he states the proportion of the former to be
three times that of the latter.The reason he gives for this is in
substance, that as the head has but one motion to make, while in fact
the lower part of the figure has three successive operations to perform
at the places he mentions, three times the velocity, or, in other
words, three times the degree of effort, is necessary in the head, the
prime mover, to give the power of influencing the other parts; and
the rule deducible from this axiom is, that where two different parts
of the body concur in the same action, and one of them has to perform
one motion only, while the other is to have several, the proportion of
velocity or effort in the former must be regulated by the number of
operations necessary in the latter.][Footnote 23: It is explained in this work, or at least there is
something respecting it in the preceding chapter, and in chap.[Footnote 24: The eyeball moving up and down to look at the hand,
describes a part of a circle, from every point of which it sees it
in an infinite variety of aspects.The hand also is moveable _ad
infinitum_ (for it can go round the whole circle--see chap.),
and consequently shew itself in an infinite variety of aspects, which
it is impossible for any memory to retain.][Footnote 26: About thirteen yards of our measure, the Florentine
braccia, or cubit, by which the author measures, being 1 foot 10 inches
7-8ths English measure.][Footnote 28: It is supposed that the figures are to appear of the
natural size, and not bigger.In that case, the measure of the first,
to be of the exact dimension, should have its feet resting upon the
bottom line; but as you remove it from that, it should diminish.No allusion is here intended to the distance at which a picture is to
be placed from the eye.][Footnote 29: The author does not mean here to say, that one historical
picture cannot be hung over another.It certainly may, because, in
viewing each, the spectator is at liberty (especially if they are
subjects independent of each other) to shift his place so as to stand
at the true point of sight for viewing every one of them; but in
covering a wall with a succession of subjects from the same history,
the author considers the whole as, in fact, but one picture, divided
into compartments, and to be seen at one view, and which cannot
therefore admit more than one point of sight.In the former case, the
pictures are in fact so many distinct subjects unconnected with each
other.]This chapter is obscure, and may probably be made clear by merely
stating it in other words.Leonardo objects to the use of both eyes,
because, in viewing in that manner the objects here mentioned, two
balls, one behind the other, the second is seen, which would not be
the case, if the angle of the visual rays were not too big for the
first object.Whoever is at all acquainted with optics, need not be
told, that the visual rays commence in a single point in the centre, or
nearly the centre of each eye, and continue diverging.But, in using
both eyes, the visual rays proceed not from one and the same centre,
but from a different centre in each eye, and intersecting each other,
as they do a little before passing the first object, they become
together broader than the extent of the first object, and consequently
give a view of part of the second.On the contrary, in using but one
eye, the visual rays proceed but from one centre; and as, therefore,
there cannot be any intersection, the visual rays, when they reach the
first object, are not broader than the first object, and the second is
completely hidden.Properly speaking, therefore, in using both eyes we
introduce more than one point of sight, which renders the perspective
false in the painting; but in using one eye only, there can be, as
there ought, but one point of sight.There is, however, this difference
between viewing real objects and those represented in painting, that in
looking at the former, whether we use one or both eyes, the objects,
by being actually detached from the back ground, admit the visual rays
to strike on them, so as to form a correct perspective, from whatever
point they are viewed, and the eye accordingly forms a perspective of
its own; but in viewing the latter, there is no possibility of varying
the perspective; and, unless the picture is seen precisely under the
same angle as it was painted under, the perspective in all other views
must be false.This is observable in the perspective views painted for
scenes at the playhouse.If the beholder is seated in the central line
of the house, whether in the boxes or pit, the perspective is correct;
but, in proportion as he is placed at a greater or less distance to the
right or left of that line, the perspective appears to him more or less
faulty.And hence arises the necessity of using but one eye in viewing
a painting, in order thereby to reduce it to one point of sight.][Footnote 32: See the Life of the Author prefixed, and chap.[Footnote 33: The author here speaks of unpolished Nature; and indeed
it is from such subjects only, that the genuine and characteristic
operations of Nature are to be learnt.It is the effect of education
to correct the natural peculiarities and defects, and, by so doing, to
assimilate one person to the rest of the world.][Footnote 36: See chapter cclxvii.][Footnote 37: Sir Joshua Reynolds frequently inculcated these precepts
in his lectures, and indeed they cannot be too often enforced.][Footnote 38: Probably this would have formed a part of his intended
Treatise on Light and Shadow, but no such proposition occurs in the
present work.][Footnote 41: This cannot be taken as an absolute rule; it must be left
in a great measure to the judgment of the painter.For much graceful
softness and grandeur is acquired, sometimes, by blending the lights of
the figures with the light part of the ground; and so of the shadows;
as Leonardo himself has observed in chapters cxciv.and Sir
Joshua Reynolds has often put in practice with success.][Footnote 44: He means here to say, that in proportion as the body
interposed between the eye and the object is more or less transparent,
the greater or less quantity of the colour of the body interposed will
be communicated to the object.][Footnote 45: See the note to chap.[Footnote 46: See the preceding chapter, and chap.[Footnote 47: The appearance of motion is lessened according to the
distance, in the same proportion as objects diminish in size.][Footnote 50: This was intended to constitute a part of some book of
Perspective, which we have not; but the rule here referred to will be
found in chap.[Footnote 52: No such work was ever published, nor, for any thing that
appears, ever written.][Footnote 53: The French translation of 1716 has a note on this
chapter, saying, that the invention of enamel painting found out since
the time of Leonardo da Vinci, would better answer to the title of this
chapter, and also be a better method of painting.I must beg leave,
however, to dissent from this opinion, as the two kinds of painting
are so different, that they cannot be compared.Leonardo treats of oil
painting, but the other is vitrification.Leonardo is known to have
spent a great deal of time in experiments, of which this is a specimen,
and it may appear ridiculous to the practitioners of more modern
date, as he does not enter more fully into a minute description of
the materials, or the mode of employing them.The principle laid down
in the text appears to me to be simply this: to make the oil entirely
evaporate from the colours by the action of fire, and afterwards to
prevent the action of the air by the means of a glass, which in itself
is an excellent principle, but not applicable, any more than enamel
painting to large works.][Footnote 54: It is evident that distemper or size painting is here
meant.][Footnote 56: This rule is not without exception: see chap.[Footnote 59: See chapters ccxlvii.Probably they were intended to form a part of a distinct treatise, and
to have been ranged as propositions in that, but at present they are
not so placed.][Footnote 62: Although the author seems to have designed that this, and
many other propositions to which he refers, should have formed a part
of some regular work, and he has accordingly referred to them whenever
he has mentioned them, by their intended numerical situation in that
work, whatever it might be, it does not appear that he ever carried
this design into execution.There are, however, several chapters in
the present work, viz.in which the
principle in the text is recognised, and which probably would have been
transferred into the projected treatise, if he had ever drawn it up.][Footnote 63: The note on the preceding chapter is in a great measure
applicable to this, and the proposition mentioned in the text is also
to be found in chapter ccxlvii.[Footnote 64: See the note on the chapter next but one preceding.The
proposition in the text occurs in chap.[Footnote 66: I do not know a better comment on this passage than
Felibien's Examination of Le Brun's Picture of the Tent of Darius.From this (which has been reprinted with an English translation, by
Colonel Parsons in 1700, in folio) it will clearly appear, what the
chain of connexion is between every colour there used, and its nearest
neighbour, and consequently a rule may be formed from it with more
certainty and precision than where the student is left to develope
it for himself, from the mere inspection of different examples of
colouring.]We have before remarked, that the propositions so
frequently referred to by the author, were never reduced into form,
though apparently he intended a regular work in which they were to be
included.][Footnote 68: No where in this work.][Footnote 69: This is evident in many of Vandyke's portraits,
particularly of ladies, many of whom are dressed in black velvet; and
this remark will in some measure account for the delicate fairness
which he frequently gives to the female complexion.][Footnote 70: These propositions, any more than the others mentioned
in different parts of this work, were never digested into a regular
treatise, as was evidently intended by the author, and consequently are
not to be found, except perhaps in some of the volumes of the author's
manuscript collections.][Footnote 73: This book on perspective was never drawn up.][Footnote 76: There is no work of this author to which this can at
present refer, but the principle is laid down in chapters cclxxxiv.[Footnote 77: See chapters cccvii.[Footnote 80: To our obtaining a correct idea of the magnitude and
distance of any object seen from afar, it is necessary that we consider
how much of distinctness an object loses at a distance (from the mere
interposition of the air), as well as what it loses in size; and these
two considerations must unite before we can decidedly pronounce as to
its distance or magnitude.This calculation, as to distinctness, must
be made upon the idea that the air is clear, as, if by any accident it
is otherwise, we shall (knowing the proportion in which clear air dims
a prospect) be led to conclude this farther off than it is, and, to
justify that conclusion, shall suppose its real magnitude correspondent
with the distance, at which from its degree of distinctness it appears
to be.In the circumstance remarked in the text there is, however, a
great deception; the fact is, that the colour and the minute parts of
the object are lost in the fog, while the size of it is not diminished
in proportion; and the eye being accustomed to see objects diminished
in size at a great distance, supposes this to be farther off than it
is, and consequently imagines it larger.][Footnote 81: This proposition, though undoubtedly intended to form a
part of some future work, which never was drawn up, makes no part of
the present.][Footnote 84: See chapter ccxcviii.][Footnote 85: This was probably to have been a part of some other work,
but it does not occur in this.][Footnote 86: Cento braccia, or cubits.The Florence braccio is one
foot ten inches seven eighths, English measure.][Footnote 87: Probably the Author here means yellow lilies, or fleurs
de lis.][Footnote 88: That point is always found in the horizon, and is called
the point of sight, or the vanishing point.][Footnote 91: This position has been already laid down in chapter
cxxiv.(and will also be found in chapter cccxlviii.); and the reader
is referred to the note on that passage, which will also explain that
in the text, for further illustration.It may, however, be proper to
remark, that though the author has here supposed both objects conveyed
to the eye by an angle of the same extent, they cannot, in fact, be so
seen, unless one eye be shut; and the reason is this: if viewed with
both eyes, there will be two points of sight, one in the centre of each
eye; and the rays from each of these to the objects must of course be
different, and will consequently form different angles.][Footnote 92: The braccio is one foot ten inches and seven eighths
English measure.]To be abridged according to the rules of
perspective.][Footnote 95: The whole of this chapter, like the next but one
preceding, depends on the circumstance of there being in fact two
points of sight, one in the centre of each eye, when an object is
viewed with both eyes.In natural objects the effect which this
circumstance produces is, that the rays from each point of sight,
diverging as they extend towards the object, take in not only that, but
some part also of the distance behind it, till at length, at a certain
distance behind it, they cross each other; whereas, in a painted
representation, there being no real distance behind the object, but the
whole being a flat surface, it is impossible that the rays from the
points of sight should pass beyond that flat surface; and as the object
itself is on that flat surface, which is the real extremity of the
view, the eyes cannot acquire a sight of any thing beyond.][Footnote 96: A well-known painter at Florence, contemporary with
Leonardo da Vinci, who painted several altar-pieces and other public
works.][Footnote 100: Leonardo da Vinci was remarkably fond of this kind of
invention, and is accused of having lost a great deal of time that way.][Footnote 101: The method here recommended, was the general and common
practice at that time, and continued so with little, if any variation,
till lately.But about thirty years ago, the late Mr.Bacon invented
an entirely new method, which, as better answering the purpose,
he constantly used, and from him others have also adopted it into
practice.][Footnote 102: This may be a good method of dividing the figure for the
purpose of reducing from large to small, or _vice versa_; but it not
being the method generally used by the painters for measuring their
figures, as being too minute, this chapter was not introduced amongst
those of general proportions.]Minster had put her business
in your hands.”

Horace flushed a little, and returned the other’s gaze with one equally
truculent.“It didn’t seem to be necessary,” he replied, curtly.“It is private
business.”

“Nothing was said about your having private business when the firm was
established,” commented Reuben.“That may be,” retorted Horace.“But you have your railroad affairs--a
purely personal matter.Why shouldn’t I have an equal right?”

“I don’t say you haven’t.What I am thinking of is your secrecy in
the matter.I hate to have people act in that way, as if I couldn’t be
trusted.”

Horace had never heard Reuben speak in this tone before.The whole
Minster business had perplexed and harassed him into a state of nervous
irritability these last few weeks, and it was easy for him now to snap
at provocation.“At least _I_ may be trusted to mind my own affairs,” he said, with
cutting niceness of enunciation and a lowering scowl of the brows.There came a little pause, for Reuben saw himself face to face with
a quarrel, and shrank from precipitating it needlessly.Perhaps the
rupture would be necessary, but he would do nothing to hasten it out of
mere ill-temper.“That isn’t the point,” he said at last, looking up with more calmness
into the other’s face.“I simply commented on your having taken such
pains to keep the whole thing from me.Why on earth should you have
thought that essential?”

Horace answered with a question.“Who told you about it?” he asked, in a
surly tone.“Old ’Squire Gedney mentioned it first.Others have spoken of it
since.”

“Well, what am I to understand?Do you intend to object to my keeping
the business?I may tell you that it was by the special request of my
clients that I undertook it alone, and, as they laid so much stress on
that, it seemed to me best not to speak of it at all to you.”

“Why?”

“To be frank,” said Horace, with a cold gleam in his eye, “I didn’t
imagine that it would be particularly pleasant to you to learn that the
Minster ladies desired not to have you associated with their affairs.It
seemed one of those things best left unsaid.However, you have it now.”

Reuben felt the disagreeable intention of his partner’s words even
more than he did their bearing upon the dreams from which he had been
awakened.He had by this time perfectly made up his mind about Horace,
and realized that a break-up was inevitable.The conviction that this
young man was dishonest carried with it, however, the suggestion that it
would be wise to probe him and try to learn what he was at.“I wish you would sit down a minute or two,” he said.“I want to talk to
you.”

Horace took a chair, and turned the cigar restlessly around in his
teeth.He was conscious that his nerves were not quite what they should
be.“It seems to me,” pursued Reuben--“I’m speaking as an older lawyer
than you, and an older man--it seems to me that to put a four hundred
thousand dollar mortgage on the Minster property is a pretty big
undertaking for a young man to go into on his own hook, without
consulting anybody.Don’t think I wish to
meddle.Only it seems to me, if I had been in your place, I should have
moved very cautiously and taken advice.“I did take advice,” said Horace.The discovery that Reuben knew of this
mortgage filled him with uneasiness.Schuyler Tenney?” asked Reuben, speaking calmly enough, but
watching with all his eyes.Horace visibly flushed, and
then turned pale.“I decline to be catechised in this way,” he said, nervously shifting
his position on the chair, and then suddenly rising.“Gedney is a
damned, meddlesome, drunken old fool,” he added, with irrelevant
vehemence.“Yes, I’m afraid ‘Cal’ does drink too much,” answered Reuben, with
perfect amiability of tone.He evinced no desire to continue the
conversation, and Horace, after standing for an uncertain moment or
two in the doorway, went out and put on his overcoat.“Am I to take it that you object to my continuing to act as attorney for
these ladies?” he asked from the threshold of the outer room, his voice
shaking a little in spite of itself.“I don’t think I have said that,” replied Reuben.“No, you haven’t _said_ it,” commented the other.“To tell the truth, I haven’t quite cleared up in my own mind just what
I do object to, or how much,” said Reuben, relighting his cigar, and
contemplating his boots crossed on the desk-top.“We’ll talk of this
again.”

“As you like,” muttered young Mr.Then he turned, and went away
without saying good-night.Twilight began to close in upon the winter’s day, but Reuben still sat
in meditation.He had parted with his colleague in anger, and it was
evident enough that the office family was to be broken up; but he
gave scarcely a thought to these things.His mind, in fact, seemed by
preference to dwell chiefly upon the large twisted silken cord which
girdled the waist of that wonderful young woman, and the tasselled ends
of which hung against the white front of her gown like the beads of a
nun.Many variant thoughts about her affairs, about her future, rose in
his mind and pleasantly excited it, but they all in turn merged vaguely
into fancies circling around that glossy rope and weaving themselves
into its strands.It was very near tea-time, and darkness had established itself for the
night in the offices, before Reuben’s vagrant musings prompted him to
action.Upon the spur of the moment, he all at once put down his feet,
lighted the gas over his desk, took out the perfumed letter from its
consecrated resting-place, and began hurriedly to write a reply to it.He had suddenly realized that the memorable interview that afternoon had
been, from her point of view, inconclusive.Five times he worked his way down nearly to the bottom of the page,
and then tore up the sheet.At first he was too expansive; then
the contrasted fault of over-reticence jarred upon him.At last he
constructed this letter, which obtained a reluctant approval from his
critical sense, though it seemed to his heart a pitifully gagged and
blindfolded missive:

Dear Miss Minster: Unfortunately, I was unable this afternoon to see my
way to helping you upon the lines which you suggested.Matters have assumed a somewhat different aspect since our talk.By the
time that you have mastered the details of what you had on your mind, I
may be in a position to consult with you freely upon the whole subject.I want you to believe that I am very anxious to be of assistance to you,
in this as in all other things.Faithfully yours,

Reuben TRacy.Reuben locked up the keepsake note again, fondly entertaining the idea
as he did so that soon there might be others to bear it company.Then he
closed the offices, went down upon the street, and told the first idle
boy he met that he could earn fifty cents by carrying a letter at once
to the home of the Minsters.The money would be his when he returned to
the Dearborn House.“Will there be any answer?” asked the boy.This opened up a new idea to the lawyer.“You might wait and see,” he
said.But the messenger came back in a depressingly short space of time, with
the word that no answer was required.He had hurried both ways with a stem concentration of purpose, and now
he dashed off once more in an even more strenuous face against time
with the half-dollar clutched securely inside his mitten.The Great
Occidental Minstrel Combination was in town, and the boy leaped over
snowbanks, and slid furiously across slippery places, in the earnestness
of his intention not to miss one single joke.The big man whom he left went wearily up the stairs to his room, and
walked therein for aimless hours, and almost scowled as he shook his
head at the waitress who came up to remind him that he had had no
supper.*****

The two Minster sisters had read Reuben’s note together, in the
seclusion of their own sitting-room.They had previously discussed
the fact of his refusal to assist them--for so it translated itself
in Kate’s account of the interview--and had viewed it with almost
displeasure.Ethel was, however, disposed to relent when the letter came.“At least it might be well to write him a polite note,” she said,
“thanking him, and saying that circumstances might arise under which you
would be glad to--to avail yourself, and so on.”

“I don’t think I shall write at all,” Kate replied, glancing over the
lawyer’s missive again.“He took no interest in the thing whatever.And you see how even now he infers that ‘the lines I suggested’ were
dishonorable.”

“I didn’t see that, Kate.”

“Here it is.‘He was unable to see his way,’ and that sort of thing.And
he _said_ himself that the business all seemed regular enough, so far
as he could see.--Say that there is no answer,” she added to the maid at
the door.The two girls sat in silence for a moment in the soft, cosey light
between the fire-place and the lace-shaded lamp.Then Ethel spoke again:

“And you really didn’t like him, Kate?You know you were so enthusiastic
about him, that day you came back from the milliner’s shop.I never
heard you have so much to say about any other man before.”

“That was different,” mused the other.Her voice grew even less kindly,
and the words came swifter as she went on.“_Then_ it was a question of
helping the Lawton girl.He didn’t
hum and haw, and talk about ‘the lines suggested’ to him, then.He could
‘see his way’ very clearly indeed.And
I was childish enough to be taken in by it all.I am vexed with myself
when I think of it.”

“Are you sure you are being quite fair, Kate?” pale Ethel asked, putting
her hand caressingly on the sister’s knee.He _says_ he wants to help you; and he hints, too, that something has
happened, or is going to happen, to make him free in the matter.How can
we tell what that something is, or how he felt himself bound before?It seems to me that we oughtn’t to leap at the idea of his being
unfriendly.I am sure that you believed him to be a wholly good man
before.Why assume all at once now that he is not, just because--Men
don’t change from good to bad like that.”

“Ah, but _was_ he good before, or did we only think so?”

Ethel went on: “Surely, he knows more about business than we do.And if
he was unable to help you, it must have been for some real reason.”

“That is _it!_ I should like to be helped first, and let reasons come
afterward.” The girl’s dark eyes flashed with an imperious light.“What
kind of a hero is it who, when you cry for assistance, calmly says:
‘Upon the lines you suggest I do not see my way’?It is high time the
books about chivalry were burned, if ‘that’ is the modern man.”

“But you did not cry to a hero for assistance.You merely asked the
advice of a lawyer about a mortgage---if mamma is right about its being
a mortgage.”

“It is the same thing,” said Kate, pushing the hassock impatiently with
her foot.. “Whether the distressed maiden falls into the water or into
debt, the principle is precisely the same.”

“He couldn’t do what you asked, because it would be unfair to his
partner.Now, isn’t that it exactly?Now,
_be_ frank, Kate.”

“The partner would have gone into anything headlong, asking no
questions, raising no objections, if I had so much ais lifted my finger.He never would have given, partner a thought.”

Kate, confided this answer to the firelight.She was conscious of a
desire just now not to meet her sister’s glance.“And you like the man without scruples better than the man with them?”

“At least, he is more interesting,” the elder girl said, still with her
eyes on the burning logs.Ethel waited a little for some additional hint as to her sister’s state
of mind.When the silence had begun to make itself felt, she said:

“Kate Minster, you don’t mean one word of what you are saying.”

“Ah, but I do.”

“No; listen to me.Tracy very much
for his action to-day.”

“For being so much less eager to help me than he was to help the
milliner?”

“No; for not being willing to help even you by doing an unfair thing.”

“Well--if you like--respect, yes.But so one respects John Knox, and
Increase Mather, and St.Simon What’s-his-name on top of the pillar--all
the disagreeable people, in fact.But it isn’t respect that makes the
world go round.There is such a thing as caring too much for respect,
and too little for warmth of feeling, and generous impulses, and--and so
on.”

“You’re a queer girl, Kate,” was all Ethel could think to say.This time the silence maintained itself so long that the snapping
of sparks on the hearth, and even the rushing suction of air in the
lamp-flame, grew to be obvious noises.At last Ethel slid softly from
the couch to the carpet, and nestled her head against her sister’s
waist.Kate put her arm tenderly over the girl’s shoulder, and drew
her closer to her, and the silence had become vocal with affectionate
mur-murings to them both.It was the younger sister who finally spoke:

“You _won’t_ do anything rash, Kate?Nothing without talking it over
with me?” she pleaded, almost sadly.Kate bent over and kissed her twice, thrice, on the forehead, and
stroked the silken hair upon this forehead caressingly.Her own eyes
glistened with the beginnings of tears before she made answer, rising as
she spoke, and striving to import into her voice the accent of gayety:

“As if I ever dreamed of doing anything at all without asking you!And
please, puss, may I go to bed now?”




CHAPTER XXIII.--HORACE’S PATH BECOMES TORTUOUS.“Tracy has found out that I’m doing the Minster business, and he’s cut
up rough about it.I shouldn’t be surprised if the firm came a cropper
over the thing.”

Horace Boyce confided this information to Mr.Schuyler Tenney on the
forenoon following his scene with Reuben, and though the language in
which it was couched was in part unfamiliar, the hardware merchant had
no difficulty in grasping its meaning.He stopped his task of going
through the morning’s batch of business letters, and looked up keenly at
the young man.“Found out--how do you mean?I told you to tell him--told you the day
you came here to talk about the General’s affairs.”

“Well, I didn’t tell him.”

“And why?” Tenney demanded, sharply.“I should like to know why?”

“Because it didn’t suit me to do so,” replied the young man; “just as it
doesn’t suit me now to be bullied about it.”

Mr.Tenney looked for just a fleeting instant as if he were going to
respond in kind.Then he thought better of it, and began toying with one
of the envelopes before him.“You must have got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning,” he
said, smilingly.“Why, man alive, nobody dreamed of bullying you.Only,
of course, it would have been better if you’d told Tracy.And you say he
is mad about it?”

“Yes, he was deucedly offensive.I daresay it will come to an open row.I haven’t seen him yet to-day, but things looked very dickey indeed for
the partnership last night.”

“Then the firm hasn’t got any specified term to run?”

“No, it is terminable at pleasure of both parties, which of course means
either party.”

“Well, there, you can tell him to go to the old Harry, if you like.”

“Precisely what I mean to do--if--”

“If what?”

“If there is going to be enough in this Minster business to keep me
going in the mean while.I don’t think I could take much of his regular
office business away.I haven’t been there long enough, you know.”

“Enough?I Should think there _would_ be enough!You will have five
thousand dollars as her representative in the Thessaly Manufacturing
Company.I daresay you might charge something for acting as her agent in
the pig-iron trust, too, though I’d draw it pretty mild if I were you.Women get scared at bills for that sort of thing.A young fellow like
you ought to save money on half of five thousand dollars.It never cost
me fifteen hundred dollars yet to live, and live well, too.”

Horace smiled in turn, and the smile was felt by both to suffice,
without words.There was no need to express in terms the fact that
in matters of necessary expense a Boyce and a Tenney, were two widely
differentiated persons.Horace had more satisfaction out
of the thought than did his companion.“Oh, by the way,” he added, “I ought to tell you, Tracy knows in
some way that you are mixed up with me in the thing.He mentioned your
name--in that slow, ox-like way of his so that I couldn’t tell how much
he knew or suspected.”

Mr.Tenney was interested in this; and showed his concern by separating
the letters on his desk into little piles, as if he were preparing to
perform a card tricks:

“I guess it won’t matter, much,” he said at last.“Everybody’s going
to know it pretty soon, now.” He thought again for a little, and then
added: “Only, on second thought, you’d better stick in with him a while
longer, if you can.Make some sort of apology to him, if he needs one,
and keep in the firm.It will be better so.”

“Why should I, pray?” demanded the young man, curtly.Tenney again looked momentarily as if he were tempted to reply with
acerbity, and again the look vanished as swiftly as it came.He answered
in all mildness:

“Because I don’t want Tracy to be sniffing around, inquiring into
things, until we are fairly in the saddle.He might spoil everything.”

“But how will my remaining with him prevent that?”

“You don’t know your man,” replied Tenney.“He’s one of those fellows
who would feel in honor bound to keep his hands off, simply because you
_were_ with him.That’s the beauty of that kind of chap.”

This tribute to the moral value of his partner impressed Horace but
faintly.“Well, I’ll see how he talks to-day,” he said, doubtfully.“Perhaps we can manage to hit it off together a while longer.” Then a
thought crossed his mind, and he asked with abruptness:

“What are you afraid of his finding out, if he does ‘sniff around’ as
you call it?Everything is above board, isn’t
it?”

“Why, you know it is.Who should know it better than you?” Mr.Horace reasoned to himself as he walked away that there really was no
cause for apprehension.Tenney was smart, and evidently Wendover was
smart too, but if they tried to pull the wool over his eyes they would
find that he himself had not been born yesterday.He had done everything
they had suggested to him, but he felt that the independent and even
captious manner in which he had done it all must have shown the schemers
that he was not a man to be trifled with.Thus far he could see no
dishonesty in their plans.He had been very nervous about the first
steps, but his mind was almost easy now.He was in a position where he
could protect the Minsters if any harm threatened them.And very
soon now, he said confidently to himself, he would be in an even more
enviable position--that of a member of the family council, a prospective
son-in-law.It was clear to his perceptions that Kate liked him, and
that he had no rivals.It happened that Reuben did not refer again to the subject of
yesterday’s dispute, and while Horace acquiesced in the silence, he was
conscious of some disappointment over it.It annoyed him to even look at
his partner this morning, and he was sick and tired of the partnership.It required an effort to be passing civil with Reuben, and he said to
himself a hundred times during the day that he should be heartily glad
when the Thessaly Manufacturing Company got its new machinery in, and
began real operations, so that he could take up his position there
as the visible agent of the millions, and pitch his partner and the
pettifogging law business overboard altogether.In the course of the afternoon he went to the residence of the Minsters.The day was not Tuesday, but Horace regarded himself as emancipated from
formal conditions, and at the door asked for the ladies, and then made
his own way into the drawing-room, with entire self-possession.Minster came down, he had some trivial matter of business
ready as a pretext for his visit, but her manner was so gracious that
he felt pleasantly conscious of the futility of pretexts.He was on such
a footing in the Minster household that he would never need excuses any
more.The lady herself mentioned the plan of his attending the forthcoming
meeting of the directors of the pig-iron trust at Pittsburg, and told
him that she had instructed her bankers to deposit with his bankers a
lump sum for expenses chargeable against the estate, which he could
use at discretion.“You mustn’t be asked to use your own money on our
business,” she said, smilingly.It is only natural to warm toward people who have such nice things as
this to say, and Horace found himself assuming a very confidential,
almost filial, attitude toward Mrs.Her kindness to him was so
marked that he felt really moved by it, and in a gracefully indirect
way said so.He managed this by alluding to his own mother, who had died
when he was a little boy, and then dwelling, with a tender inflection
in his voice, upon the painful loneliness which young men feel who are
brought up in motherless homes.“It seems as if I had never known a home
at all,” he said, and sighed.“She was one of the Beekmans from Tyre, wasn’t she?I’ve heard Tabitha
speak of her often,” said Mrs.The words were not important,
but the look which accompanied them was distinctly sympathetic.Perhaps it was this glance that affected Horace.He made a little
gulping sound in his throat, clinched his hands together, and looked
fixedly down upon the pattern of the carpet.“We should both have been better men if she had lived’,” he murmured,
in a low voice.As no answer came, he was forced to look up after a time, and then
upon the instant he realized that his pathos had been wasted, for Mrs.Minster’s face did not betray the emotion he had anticipated.She seemed
to have been thinking of something else.“Have you seen any Bermuda potatoes in the market yet?” she asked.“It’s
about time for them, isn’t it?”

“I’ll ask my father,” Horace replied, determined not to be thrown off
the trail.“He has been in the West Indies a good deal, and he knows all
about their vegetables, and the seasons, and so on.It is about him that
I wish to speak, Mrs.Minster.”

The lady nodded her head, and drew down the comers of her mouth a
little.“I feel the homeless condition of the General very much,” Horace went
on.“The death of my mother was a terrible blow to him, one he has never
recovered from.”

Mrs.Minster had heard differently, but she nodded her head again in
sympathy with this new view.Horace had not been mistaken in believing
that filial affection was good in her eyes.“So he has lived all these years almost alone in the big house,” the son
proceeded, “and the solitary life has affected his spirits, weakened
his ambition, relaxed his regard for the part he ought to play in the
community.Since I have been back, he has brightened up a good deal.He
has been a most loving father to me always, and I would do anything in
the world to contribute to his happiness.It is borne in upon me more
and more that if I had a cheerful home to which he could turn for warmth
and sunshine, if I had a wife whom he could reverence and be fond of, if
there were grandchildren to greet him when he came and to play upon his
knee--he would feel once more as if there was something in life worth
living for.”

Horace awaited with deep anxiety the answer to this.The General was the
worst card in his hand, one which he was glad to be rid of at any risk.If it should turn out that it had actually taken a trick in the game,
then he would indeed be lucky.“If it is no offence, how old are you, Mr.“I shall be twenty-eight in April.”

Mrs.“I never have believed in
early marriages,” she said.“They make more than half the trouble there
is.The Mauverensens were never great hands for marrying early.My
grandfather, Major Douw, was almost thirty, and my father was past
that age.And, of course, people married then much earlier than they do
nowadays.”

“I hope you do not think twenty-eight too young,” Horace pleaded, with
alert eyes resting on her face.He paused only for an instant, and then,
just as the tremor arising in his heart had reached his tongue, added
earnestly, “For it is a Mauverensen I wish to marry.”

Mrs.Minster looked at him with no light of comprehension in her glance.“It can’t be our people,” she said, composedly, “for Anthony has no
daughters.It must be some of the Schenectady lot.We’re not related at
all.They try to make out that they are, but they’re not.”

“You are very closely and tenderly related to the young lady I have
learned to adore,” the young man said, leaning forward on his low chair
until one knee almost touched the carpet.“I called her a Mauverensen
because she is worthy of that historic blood, but it was her mother’s,
not her father’s name.Minster, I love your daughter Kate!”

“Goodness me!” was the astonished lady’s comment.She stared at the young man in suppliant attitude before her, in
very considerable confusion of thought, and for what seemed to him an
intolerable time.“I am afraid it wouldn’t do at all,” she said first, doubtingly.Then
she added, as if thinking aloud: “I might have known Kate was keeping
something from me.She hasn’t been herself at all these last few weeks.”

“But she has not been keeping _this_ from you, Mrs.Minster,” urged the
young man, in his softest voice.“It is my own secret--all my own--kept
locked in the inner tabernacle of my heart until this very moment, when
I revealed it to you.”

“You mean that Kate--my daughter--does not know of this?”

“She must know that I worship the ground she treads on--she would be
blind not to realize that--but I have never said a word to her about it.No, not a word!”

Mrs.Minster uttered the little monosyllable “oh!” with a hesitating,
long-drawn-out sound.It was evident that this revelation altered
matters in her mind, and Horace hurried on:

“No,” he said; “the relation between mother and child has always seemed
to pie the most sacred thing on earth--perhaps because my own mother
died so many, many years ago.I would rather stifle my own feelings than
let an act of mine desecrate or imperil that relation.It may be that
I am old-fashioned, Mrs.Minster,” the young man continued, with a
deprecatory smile, “but I like the old habit of the good families--that
of deferring to the parents.I say that to them the chief courtesy and
deference are due.I know it is out of date, but I have always felt that
way.I say to you with profound respect that
you have reared the loveliest and best of all the daughters of the sons
of men, and that if you will only entertain the idea of permitting me to
strive to win her love, I shall be the proudest and happiest mortal on
earth.”

Whatever might betide with the daughter, the conquest of the mother was
easy and complete.“I like your sentiments very much indeed,” she said, with evident
sincerity.Of course I
haven’t the least idea what Kate will say.”

“Oh, leave that to me!” said Horace, with ardent confidence.Then, after
this rapturous outburst, he went on more quietly: “I would beg of you
not to mention the subject to her.Your favor has allowed me to come and go here on pleasant terms of
friendship.I will not ask your daughter
to commit herself until she has had time and chance to know me through
and through.To pick a husband
is the one grand, irrevocable step in a young girl’s life.Its success
means bliss, content, sunshine; its failure means all that is the
reverse.Therefore, I say, she cannot have too much information, too
many advantages, to help her in her choice.”

Thus it came to be understood that Mrs.Minster was to say nothing, and
was not to seem to make more of Horace than she had previously done.Then he bowed over her hand and lightly kissed it, in a fashion which
the good lady fondly assumed to be European, and was gone.Minster spent the rest of the afternoon and evening in a semi-dazed
abstraction of mental power, from time to time fitfully remembering
some wealthy young man whom she had vaguely considered as a
possible son-in-law, and sighing impartially over each mustached
and shirt-fronted figure as she pushed it out into the limbo of the
might-have-been.She almost groaned once when she recalled that this
secret must be kept even from her friend Tabitha.As for Horace, he walked on air.The marvel of his great success
surrounded and lifted him, as angels bear the souls of the blessed
fleeting from earth in the artist’s dream.The young Bonaparte, home
from Italy and the reproduction of Hannibal’s storied feat, with Paris
on its knees before him and France resounding with his name, could not
have swung his shoulders more proudly, or gazed upon unfolding destiny
with a more exultant confidence.On his way homeward an instinctive desire to be alone with his joy led
him to choose unfrequented streets, and on one of these he passed a
milliner’s shop which he had never seen before.He would not have noted
it now, save that his eye was unconsciously caught by some stray
freak of color in the window where bonnets were displayed.Then, still
unconsciously, his vision embraced the glass door beside this window,
and there suddenly it was arrested and turned to a bewildered stare.In the dusk of the little shop nothing could be distinguished but two
figures which stood close by the door.The dying light from the western
sky, ruddily brilliant and penetrating in its final glow, fell full upon
the faces of these two as they were framed in profile by the door.One was the face of Kate Minster, the woman he was to wed.The other was
the face of Jessica Law-ton, the woman whose life he had despoiled.Horace realized nothing else so swiftly as that he had not been seen,
and, with an instinctive lowering of the head and a quickened step, he
passed on.It was not until he had got out of the street altogether that
he breathed a long breath and was able to think.Then he found himself
trembling with excitement, as if he had been through a battle or a
burning house.Reflection soon helped his nerves to quietude again.Evidently the girl
had opened a millinery shop, and evidently Miss Minster was buying a
bonnet of her.That was all there was of it, and surely there was no
earthly cause for perturbation in that.The young man had thought so
lightly of the Law-ton incident at Thanksgiving time that it had never
since occurred to him to ask Tracy about its sequel.It came to his mind now that Tracy had probably helped her to start the
shop.“Damn Tracy!” he said to himself.No, there was nothing to be uneasy about in the casual, commercial
meeting of these two women.He became quite clear on this point as he
strode along toward home.At his next meeting with Kate it might do no
harm to mention having seen her there in passing, and to drop a hint as
to the character of the girl whom she was dealing with.He would see
how the talk shaped itself, after the Law-ton woman’s name had been
mentioned.It was a great nuisance, her coming to Thessaly, anyway.He
didn’t wish her any special harm, but if she got in his way here she
should be crushed like an insect.it was silly to conceive
injury or embarrassment coming from her.So with a laugh he dismissed the subject from his thoughts, and went
home to dine with his father, and gladdened the General’s heart by
a more or less elaborated account of the day’s momentous event, in
complete forgetfulness of the shock he had had.In the dead of the night, however, he did think of it again with a
vengeance.He awoke screaming, and cold with frightened quakings, under
the spell of some hideous nightmare.When he thought upon them, the
terrors of his dream were purely fantastic and could not be shaped into
any kind of coherent form.But the profile of the Lawton girl seemed to
be a part of all these terrors, a twisted and elongated side-face, with
staring, empty eyes and lips down-drawn like those of the Medusa’s head,
and yet, strangely enough, with a certain shifting effect of beauty upon
it all under the warm light of a winter sunset.Horace lay a long time awake, deliberately striving to exorcise this
repellent countenance by fixing his thoughts upon the other face--the
strong, beautiful, queenly face of the girl who was to be his wife.But
he could not bring up before his mind’s eye this picture that he wanted,
and he could not drive the other away.Sleep came again somehow, and there were no more bad dreams to be
remembered.In the morning Horace did not even recall very distinctly
the episode of the nightmare, but he discovered some novel threads of
gray at his temple as he brushed his hair, and for the first time in his
life, too, he took a drink of spirits before breakfast.CHAPTER XXIV.--A VEHEMENT RESOLVE.The sloppy snow went away at last, and the reluctant frost was forced
to follow, yet not before it had wreaked its spite by softening all
the country roads into dismal swamps of mud, and heaving into painful
confusion of holes and hummocks the pavements on Thessaly’s main
streets.But in compensation the birds came back, and the crocus and
hyacinth showed themselves, and buds warmed to life again along the
tender silk-brown boughs and melted into the pale bright green of a
springs new foliage.Overcoats disappeared, and bare-legged boys with
poles and strings of fish dawned upon the vision.The air was laden with
the perfume of lilacs and talk about baseball.From this to midsummer seemed but a step.The factory workmen walked
more wearily up the hill in the heat to their noonday dinners;
lager-beer kegs advanced all at once to be the chief staple of freight
traffic at the railway dépôt.People who could afford to take travelling
vacations began to make their plans or to fulfil them, and those who
could not began musing pleasantly upon the charms of hop-picking in
September.it was autumn, and young men added with pride
another unit to the sum of their age, and their mothers and sisters
secretly subtracted such groups or fractions of units as were needful,
and felt no more compunction at thus hoodwinking Time than if he had
been a customs-officer.The village of Thessaly, which like a horizon encompassed most of the
individuals whom we know, could tell little more than this of the months
that had passed since Thanksgiving Day, now once again the holiday
closest at hand.The seasons of rest and open-air amusement lay behind
it, and in front was a vista made of toil.There had been many deaths,
and still more numerous births, and none in either class mattered much
save under the roof-tree actually blessed or afflicted.The year had
been fairly prosperous, and the legislature had passed the bill which at
New Year’s would enable the village to call itself a city.Of the people with whom this story is concerned, there is scarcely more
to record during this lapse of time.Jessica Lawton was perhaps the one most conscious of change.At the
very beginning of spring, indeed on the very day when Horace had his
momentary fright in passing the shop, Miss Minster had visited her, had
brought a reasonably comprehensive plan for the Girls’ Resting House, as
she wanted it called, and had given her a considerable sum of money to
carry out this plan.For a long time it puzzled Jessica a good deal that
Miss Minster never came again.The scheme took on tangible form; some
score of work-girls availed themselves of its privileges, and the
result thus far involved less friction and more substantial success
than Jessica had dared to expect.It seemed passing strange that Miss
Minster, who had been so deeply enthusiastic at first, should never have
cared to come and see the enterprise, now that it was in working order.Once or twice Miss Tabitha had dropped in, and professed to be greatly
pleased with everything, but even in her manner there was an indefinable
alteration which forbade questions about the younger lady.There were rumors about in the town which might have helped Jessica to
an explanation had they reached her.The village gossips did not fail
to note that the Minster family made a much longer sojourn this year at
Newport, and then at Brick Church, New Jersey, than they had ever done
before; and gradually the intelligence sifted about that young Horace
Boyce had spent a considerable portion of his summer vacation with them.Thessaly could put two and two together as well as any other community.The understanding little by little spread its way that Horace was going
to marry into the Minster millions.If there were repinings over this foreseen event, they were carefully
dissembled.People who knew the young man liked him well enough.His
professional record was good, and he had made a speech on the Fourth
of July which pleased everybody except ’Squire Gedney; but then, the
spiteful old “Cal” never liked anybody’s speeches save his own.Even
more satisfaction was felt, however, on the score of the General.His
son was a showy young fellow, smart and well-dressed, no doubt, but
perhaps a trifle too much given to patronizing folks who had not been to
Europe, and did not scrub themselves all over with cold water, and put
on a clean shirt with both collar and cuffs attached, every morning.But
for the General there was a genuine affection.It pleased Thessaly to
note that, since he had begun to visit at the home of the Minsters,
other signs of social rehabilitation had followed, and that he himself
drank less and led a more orderly life than of yore.When his intimates
jokingly congratulated him on the rumors of his son’s good fortune, the
General tacitly gave them confirmation by his smile.If Jessica had heard these reports, she might have traced at once to
its source Miss Minster’s sudden and inexplicable coolness.Not hearing
them, she felt grieved and perplexed for a time, and then schooled
herself into resignation as she recalled Reuben Tracy’s warning about
the way rich people took up whims and dropped them again, just as fancy
dictated.It was on the first day of November that the popular rumor as to
Horace’s prospects reached her, and this was a day memorable for vastly
more important occurrences in the history of industrial Thessaly.The return of cold weather had been marked, among other signs of the
season, by a renewed disposition on the part of Ben Lawton to drop in
to the millinery shop, and sit around by the fire in the inner room.Ben
came this day somewhat earlier than usual--the midday meal was in its
preliminary stages of preparation under Lucinda’s red hands--and it was
immediately evident that he was more excited over something that had
happened outside than by his expectation of getting a dinner.“There’s the very old Nick to pay down in the village!” he said, as he
put his feet on the stove-hearth.“Heard about it, any of you?”

Ben had scarcely ascended in the social scale during the scant year that
had passed, though the general average of whiteness in his paper collars
had somewhat risen, and his hair and straggling dry-mud- beard
were kept more duly under the subjection of shears.His clothes,
too, were whole and unworn, but they hung upon his slouching and
round-shouldered figure with “poor white” written in every misfitting
fold and on every bagging projection.Jessica had resigned all hope that
he would ever be anything but a canal boatman in mien or ambition, but
her affection for him had grown rather than diminished; and she was glad
that Lucinda, in whom there had been more marked personal improvements,
seemed also to like him better.No, Jessica said, she had heard nothing.“Well, the Minster furnaces was all shut down this morning, and so was
the work out at the ore-beds at Juno, and the men, boys, and girls in
the Thessaly Company’s mills all got word that wages was going to be
cut down.You can bet there’s a buzz around town, with them three things
coming all together, smack!”

“I suppose so,” answered Jessica, still bending over her work of
cleaning and picking out some plumes.“That looks bad for business this
winter, doesn’t it?”

Ben’s relations with business, or with industry generally, were of the
most remote and casual sort, but he had a lively objective interest in
the topic.“Why, it’s the worst thing that ever happened,” he said, with
conviction.“There’s seven hundred men thrown out already” (the figure
was really two hundred and twelve), “and more than a thousand more got
to git unless they’ll work for starvation wages.”

“It seems very hard,” the girl made reply.The idea came to her that
very possibly this would put an extra strain upon the facilities and
financial strength of the Resting House.“Hard!” her father exclaimed, stretching his hands over the stove-top;
“them rich people are harder than Pharaoh’s heart.What do them Minsters
care about poor folks, whether they starve or freeze to death, or
anything?”

“Oh, it is the Minsters, you say!” Jessica looked up now, with a new
interest.“Sure enough, they own the furnaces.How could they have done
such a thing, with winter right ahead of us?”

“It’s all to make more money,” put in Lucinda.“Them that don’t need
it’ll do anything to get it.That Kate Minster of
yours, for instance, she’ll wear her sealskin and eat pie just the same.What does it matter to her?”

“No; she has a good heart.I know she has,” said Jessica.“She wouldn’t
willingly do harm to any one.But perhaps she has nothing to do with
managing such things.Yes, that must be it.”

“I guess Schuyler Tenney and Hod Boyce about run the thing, from what I
hear,” commented the father.“Tenney’s been bossing around since summer
begun, and Boyce is the lawyer, so they say.”

Ben suddenly stopped, and looked first at Jessica, then at Lucinda.Catching the latter’s eye, he made furtive motions to her to leave the
room; but she either did not or would not understand them, and continued
stolidly at her work.“That Kate you spoke about,” he went on stum-blingly, nodding hints at
Lucinda to go away as he spoke, “she’s the tall girl, with the black
eyes and her chin up in the air, ain’t she?”

“Yes,” the two sisters answered, speaking together.“Well, as I was saying about Hod Boyce,” Ben said, and then stopped in
evident embarrassment.Finally he added, confusedly avoiding Jessica’s
glance, “‘Cindy, won’t you jest step outside for a minute?I want to
tell your sister something--something you don’t know about.”

“She knows about Horace Boyce, father,” said Jessica, flushing, but
speaking calmly.“There is no need of her going.”

Lucinda, however, wiped her hands on her apron, and went out into the
store, shutting the door behind her.Then Ben, ostentatiously regarding
the hands he held out over the stove, and turning them as if they
had been fowls on a spit, sought hesitatingly for words with which to
unbosom himself.“You see,” he began, “as I was a-saying, Hod Boyce is the lawyer, and
he’s pretty thick with Schuyler Tenney, his father’s partner, which,
of course, is only natural; and Tenney he kind of runs the whole
thing--and--and that’s it, don’t you see!”

“You didn’t send Lucinda out in order to tell me _that_, surely?”

“Well, no.But Hod being the lawyer, as I said, why, don’t you see, he
has a good deal to say for himself with the women-folks, and he’s been
off with them down to the sea-side, and so it’s come about that they
say--”

“They say what?” The girl had laid down her work altogether.“They say he’s going to marry the girl you call Kate--the big one with
the black eyes.”

The story was out.Jessica sat still under the revelation for a moment,
and held up a restraining hand when her father offered to speak further.Then she rose and walked to and fro across the little room, in front
of the stove where Ben sat, her hands hanging at her side and her brows
bent with thought.At last she stopped before him and said:

“Tell me all over again about the stopping of the works--all you know
about it.”

Ben Lawton complied, and re-stated, with as much detail as he could
command, the facts already exposed.The girl listened carefully, but with growing disappointment.Somehow the notion had arisen in her mind that there would be something
important in this story--something which it would be of use to
understand.But her brain could make nothing significant out of this
commonplace narrative of a lockout and a threatened dispute about wages.Gradually, as she thought, two things rose as certainties upon the
surface of her reflections.“That scoundrel is to blame for both things.He advised her to avoid me,
and he advised her to do this other mischief.”

“I thought you’d like to know,” Ben put in, deferentially.He felt a
very humble individual indeed when his eldest daughter paced up and down
and spoke in that tone.“Yes, I’m glad I know,” she said, swiftly.She eyed her father in an
abstracted way for an instant, and then added, as if thinking aloud:
“Well, then, my fine gentleman, you--simply--shall--_not_--marry Miss
Minster!”

Ben moved uneasily in his seat, as if this warning had been personally
addressed to him.“It _would_ be pretty rough, for a fact, wouldn’t it?”
 he said.“Well, it won’t _be_ at all!” she made emphatic answer.“I don’t know as you can do much to pervent it, Jess,” he ventured to
say._Cant_ I!” she exclaimed, with grim earnestness.“Wait and
see.”

Ben had waited all his life, and he proceeded now to take her at her
word, sitting very still, and fixing a ruminative gaze on the side
of the little stove.“All right,” he said, wrapped in silence and the
placidity of contented suspense.But Jessica was now all eagerness and energy.She opened the store door,
and called out to Lucinda with business-like decision of tone: “Come in
now, and hurry dinner up as fast as you can.I want to catch the 1.20
train for Tecumseh.”

The other two made no comment on this hasty resolve, but during the
brief and not over-inviting meal which followed, watched their kinswoman
with side-glances of uneasy surprise.The girl herself hastened through
her dinner without a word of conversation, and then disappeared within
the little chamber where she and Lucinda slept together.It was only when she came out again, with her hat and cloak on and a
little travelling-bag in her hand, that she felt impelled to throw some
light on her intention.She took from her purse a bank-note and gave it
to her sister.“Shut up the store at half-past four or five today,” she said; “and
there are two things I want you to do for me outside.Go around the
furniture stores, and get some kind of small sofa that will turn into a
bed at night, and whatever extra bed-clothes we need for it--as cheap as
you can.We’ve got a pillow to spare, haven’t we?You can put those two
chairs out in the Resting House; that will make a place for the bed in
this room.You must have it all ready when I get back to-morrow night.You needn’t say anything to the girls, except that I am away for a day.And then--or no: _you_ can do it better, father.”

The girl had spoken swiftly, but with ready precision.As she turned now
to the wondering Ben, she lost something of her collected demeanor, and
hesitated for a moment.“I want you--I want you to see Reuben Tracy, and ask him to come here at
six to-morrow,” she said.She deliberated upon this for an instant, and
held out her hand as if she had changed her mind.Then she nodded, and
said: “Or no: tell him I will come to his office, and at six sharp.It
will be better that way.”

When she had perfunctorily kissed them both, and gone, silence fell
upon the room.Ben took his pipe out of his pocket and looked at it with
tentative longing, and then at the stove.“You can go out in the yard and smoke, if you want to, but not in here,”
 said Lucinda, promptly.“You wouldn’t dare think of such a thing if she
were here,” she added, with reproach.Ben put back his pipe and seated himself again by the fire.“Mighty
queer girl, that, eh?” he said.“When she gets stirred up, she’s a
hustler, eh?”

“It must be she takes it from you,” said Lucinda, with a modified grin
of irony.“No,” said Ben, with quiet candor,
“she gets it from my father.He used to count on licking a lock-tender
somewhere along the canal every time he made a trip.I remember there
was one particular fellow on the Montezuma Ma’ash that he used to
whale for choice, but any of ’em would do on a pinch.He was jest
blue-mouldy for a fight all the while, your grandfather was.He was
Benjamin Franklin Lawton, the same as me, but somehow I never took
much to rassling round or fighting.It’s more in my line to take things
easy.”

Lucinda bore an armful of dishes out into the kitchen, without making
any reply, and Ben, presently wearying of solitude, followed to where
she bent over the sink, enveloped in soap-suds and steam.“I suppose you’ve got an idea what she’s gone for?” he propounded, with
caution.“It’s a ‘_who_’ she’s gone for,” said Lucinda.Pronouns were not Ben’s strong point, and he said, “Yes, I suppose it
is,” rather helplessly.He waited in patience for more information, and
by and by it came.“If I was her, I wouldn’t do it,” said Lucinda, slapping a plate
impatiently with the wet cloth.“No, I don’t suppose you would.In some ways you always had more sense
than people give you credit for, ‘Cindy,” remarked the father, with
guarded flattery.“Jess, now, she’s one of your hoity-toity kind--flare
up and whirl around like a wheel on a tree in the Fourth of July
fireworks.”

“She’s head and shoulders above all the other Lawtons there ever was or
ever will be, and don’t you forget it!” declared the loyal Lucinda, with
fervor.“That’s what I say always,” assented Ben.“Only--I thought you said you
didn’t think she was quite right in doing what she’s going to do.”

“It’s right enough; only she was happy here, and this’ll make her
miserable again--though, of course, she was always letting her mind run
on it, and perhaps she’ll enjoy having it with her--only the girls may
talk--and--”

Lucinda let her sentence die off unfinished in a rattle of knives and
spoons in the dish-pan.“Well, Cindy,” said Ben, in the frankness of despair, “I’m dot-rotted if
I know what you are talking about.” He grew pathetic as he went on: “I’m
your father and I’m her father, and there ain’t neither of you got a
better friend on earth than I be; but you never tell me anything, any
more’n as if I was a last year’s bird’s-nest.”

Lucinda’s reserve yielded to this appeal.“Well, dad,” she said, with
unwonted graciousness of tone, “Jess has gone to Tecumseh to bring
back--to bring her little boy.She hasn’t told me so, but I know it.”

The father nodded his head in comprehension, and said nothing.He had
vaguely known of the existence of the child, and he saw more or less
clearly the reason for this present step.The shame and sorrow which
were fastened upon his family through this grandson whom he had never
seen, and never spoken of above a whisper, seemed to rankle in his heart
with a new pain of mingled bitterness and compassion.He mechanically took out his pipe, filled it from loose tobacco in his
pocket, and struck a match to light it.objected to his smoking in the house, on account of the wares
in her shop, and let the flame burn itself out in the coal-scuttle.A
whimsical query as to whether this calamitous boy had also been named
Benjamin Franklin crossed his confused mind, and then it perversely
raised the question whether the child, if so named, would be a “hustler”
 or not.Ben leaned heavily against the door-sill, and surrendered
himself to humiliation.“What I don’t understand,” he heard Lucinda saying after a time, “is why
she took this spurt all of a sudden.”

“It’s all on account of that Gawd-damned Hod Boyce!” groaned Ben.“Yes; you told her something about him.What was it?”

“Only that they all say that he’s going to marry that big Minster
girl--the black-eyed one.”

Lucinda turned away from the sink, threw down her dish-cloth with a
thud, and put her arms akimbo and her shoulders well back.Watching her,
Ben felt that somehow this girl, too, took after her grandfather rather
than him.“Oh, _is_ he!” she said, her voice high-pitched and vehement.“I guess
_we’ll_ have something to say about _that_!”




CHAPTER XXV.--A VISITATION OF ANGELS.REUBEN Tracy waited in his office next day for the visit of the
milliner, but, to tell the truth, devoted very little thought to
wondering about her errand.The whole summer and autumn, as he sat now and smoked in meditation upon
them, seemed to have been an utterly wasted period in his life.Through all the interval which lay between this November day and that
afternoon in March, when he had been for the only time inside the
Minster house, one solitary set thought had possessed his mind.Long
ago it had formulated itself in his brain; found its way to the silent,
spiritual tongue with which we speak to ourselves.He loved Kate
Minster, and had had room for no other feeling all these months.At first, when this thought was still new to him, he had hugged it to
his heart with delight.Now the melancholy days indeed were come, and he
had only suffering and disquiet from it.She had never even answered his
letter proffering assistance.She was as far away from him, as coldly
unattainable, as the north star.It made him wretched to muse upon her
beauty and charm; his heart was weary with hopeless longing for her
friendship--yet he was powerless to command either mind or heart.They
clung to her with painful persistency; they kept her image before him,
whispered her name in his ear, filled all his dreams with her fair
presence, to make each wakening a fresh grief.In his revolt against this weakness, Reuben had burned the little
scented note for which so reverential a treasure-box had been made in
his desk.He could never enter that small
inner room where he now sat without glancing at the drawer which had
once been consecrated to the letter.It was humiliating that he should prove to have so little sense and
strength.He bit his cigar fiercely with annoyance when this aspect
of the case rose before him.If love meant anything, it meant a mutual
sentiment.By all the lights of philosophy, it was not possible to love
a person who did not return that love.This he said to himself over and
over again, but the argument was not helpful.Still his mind remained
perversely full of Kate Minster.During all this time he had taken no step to probe the business which
had formed the topic of that single disagreeable talk with his partner
in the preceding March.Miss Minster’s failure to answer his letter had
deeply wounded his pride, and had put it out of the question that he
should seem to meddle in her affairs.He had never mentioned the subject
again to Horace.The two young men had gone through the summer and
autumn under the same office roof, engaged very often upon the same
business, but with mutual formality and personal reserve.No controversy
had arisen between them, but Reuben was conscious now that they had
ceased to be friends, as men understand the term, for a long time.For his own part, his dislike for his partner had grown so deep and
strong that he felt doubly bound to guard himself against showing it.It
was apparent to the most superficial introspection that a good deal of
his aversion to Horace arose from the fact that he was on friendly terms
with the Minsters, and could see Miss Kate every day.He never looked
at his partner without remembering this, and extracting unhappiness from
the thought.But he realized that this was all the more reason why
he should not yield to his feelings.Both his pride and his sense of
fairness restrained him from quarrelling with Horace on grounds of that
sort.But the events of the last day or two had opened afresh the former
dilemma about a rupture over the Minster works business.Since Schuyler
Tenney had blossomed forth as the visible head of the rolling-mills,
Reuben had, in spite of his pique and of his resolution not to be
betrayed into meddling, kept a close watch upon events connected with
the two great iron manufacturing establishments.He had practically
learned next to nothing, but he was none the less convinced that a
swindle underlay what was going on.It was with this same conviction that he now strove to understand the
shutting-down of the furnaces and ore-fields owned by the Minsters, and
the threatened lockout in the Thessaly Manufacturing Company’s mills.But it was very difficult to see where dishonesty could come in.The
furnaces and ore-supply had been stopped by an order of the pig-iron
trust, but of course the owners would be amply compensated for that.The other company’s resolve to reduce wages meant, equally of course,
a desire to make up on the pay-list the loss entailed by the closing of
the furnaces, which compelled it to secure its raw material elsewhere.Taken by themselves, each transaction was intelligible.But considered
together, and as both advised by the same men, they seemed strangely in
conflict.What possible reason could the Thessaly Company, for example,
have for urging Mrs.Minster to enter a trust, the chief purpose of
which was to raise the price of pig-iron which they themselves bought
almost entirely?He racked his brain in
futile search for the missing clew to this financial paradox.Evidently
there was such a clew somewhere; an initial fact which would explain
the whole mystery, if only it could be got at.He had for his own
satisfaction collected some figures about the Minster business, partly
exact, partly estimated, and he had worked laboriously over these in the
effort to discover the false quantity which he felt sure was somewhere
concealed.But thus far his work had been in vain.Just now a strange idea for the moment fascinated his inclination.It
was nothing else than the thought of putting his pride in his pocket--of
going to Miss Minster and saying frankly: “I believe you are being
robbed.In Heaven’s name, give me a chance to find out, and to protect
you if I am right!I shall not even ask ever to
see you again, once the rescue is achieved.do not send me away
until then--I pray you that!”

While the wild project urged itself upon his mind the man himself
seemed able to stand apart and watch this battle of his own thoughts and
longings, like an outside observer.He realized that the passion he
had nursed so long in silence had affected his mental balance.He was
conscious of surprise, almost of a hysterical kind of amusement,
that Reuben Tracy should be so altered as to think twice about such a
proceeding.Then he fell to deploring and angrily reviling the change
that had come over him; and lo!all at once he found himself strangely
glad of the change, and was stretching forth his arms in a fantasy of
yearning toward a dream figure in creamy-white robes, girdled with a
silken cord, and was crying out in his soul, “I love you!”

The vision faded away in an instant as there came the sound of rapping
at the outer door.Reuben rose to his feet, his brain still bewildered
by the sun-like brilliancy of the picture which had been burned into
it, and confusedly collected his thoughts as he walked across the larger
room.His partner had been out of town some days, and he had sent the
office-boy home, in order that the Lawton girl might be able to talk
in freedom.The knocking; was that of a woman’s hand.Evidently it was
Jessica, who had come an hour or so earlier than she had appointed.He
wondered vaguely what her errand might be, as he opened the door.In the dingy hallway stood two figures instead of one, both thickly clad
and half veiled.The waning light of late afternoon did not enable him
to recognize his visitors with any certainty.The smaller lady of the
two might be Jessica--the the who stood farthest away.He had almost
resolved that it was, in this moment of mental dubiety, when the other,
putting out her gloved hand, said to him:

“I am afraid you don’t remember me, it is so long since we met.Tracy--Miss Ethel Minster.”

The door-knob creaked in Reuben’s hand as he pressed upon it for
support, and there were eccentric flashes of light before his eyes.“Oh, I am _so_ glad!” was what he said.“Do come in--do come in.” He
led the way into the office with a dazed sense of heading a triumphal
procession, and then stopped in the centre of the room, suddenly
remembering that he had not shaken hands.To give
himself time to think, he lighted the gas in both offices and closed all
the shutters.“Oh, I am _so_ glad!” he repeated, as he turned to the two ladies.The
radiant smile on his face bore out his words.“I am afraid the little
room--my own place--is full of cigar-smoke.Let me see about the fire
here.” He shook the grate vehemently, and poked down the coals through
one of the upper windows.“Perhaps it will be warm enough here.Let me
bring some chairs.” He bustled into the inner room, and pushed out his
own revolving desk-chair, and drew up two others from different ends of
the office.The easiest chair of all, which was at Horace’s table, he
did not touch.Then, when his two visitors had taken seats, he beamed
down upon them once more, and said for the third time:

“I really _am_ delighted!”

Miss Kate put up her short veil with a frank gesture.The unaffected
pleasure which shone in Reuben’s face and radiated from his manner was
something more exuberant than she had expected, but it was grateful to
her, and she and her sister both smiled in response.“I have an apology to make first of all, Mr.Tracy,” she said, and her
voice was the music of the seraphim to his senses.“I don’t think--I am
afraid I never answered your kind letter last spring.It is a bad habit
of mine; I am the worst correspondent in the world.And then we went
away so soon afterward.”

“I beg that you won’t mention it,” said Reuben; and indeed it seemed to
him to be a trivial thing now--not worth a thought, much less a word.He
had taken a chair also, and was at once intoxicated with the rapture of
looking Kate in the face thus again, and nervous lest the room was not
warm enough.“Won’t you loosen your wraps?” he asked, with solicitude.“I am afraid
you won’t feel them when you go out.” It was an old formula which he had
heard his mother use with callers at the farm, but which he himself
had never uttered before in his life.But then he had never before been
pervaded with such a tender anxiety for the small comforts of visitors.Miss Kate opened the throat of her fur coat.“We sha’n’t stay long,”
 she said.“We must be home to dinner.” She paused for a moment and then
asked: “Is there any likelihood of our seeing your partner, Mr.Boyce,
here to-day?”

Reuben’s face fell on the instant.Alas, poor fool, he thought, to
imagine there were angels’ visits for you!“No,” he answered, gloomily.He is out of town.”

“Oh, we didn’t want to see him,” put in Miss Ethel.“Quite the
contrary.”

Reuben’s countenance recovered all its luminous radiance.He stole a
glance at this younger girl’s face, and felt that he almost loved her
too.“No,” Miss Kate went on, “in fact, we took the opportunity of his being
away to come and try to see you alone.Tracy, about the way things are going on.”

The lawyer could not restrain a comprehending nod of the head, but he
did not speak.“We do not understand at all what is being done,” proceeded Kate.“There
is nobody to explain things to us except the men who are doing those
things, and it seems to us that they tell us just what they like.We
maybe doing them an injustice, but we are very nervous about a good many
matters.That is why we came to you.”

Reuben bowed again.There was an instant’s pause, and then he opened one
of the little mica doors in the stove.“I’m afraid this isn’t going
to burn up,” he said.“If you don’t mind smoke, the other room is much
warmer.”

It was not until he had safely bestowed his precious visitors in the
cosier room, and persuaded them to loosen all their furs, that his mind
was really at ease.“Now,” he remarked, with a smile of relief, “now go
ahead.Tell me everything.”

“We have this difficulty,” said Kate, hesitatingly; “when I spoke to you
before, you felt that you couldn’t act in the matter, or learn
things, or advise us, on account of the partnership.And as that still
exists--why--” She broke off with an inquiring sigh.“My dear Miss Minster,” Reuben answered, in a voice so firm and full
of force that it bore away in front of it all possibility of suspecting
that he was too bold, “when I left you I wanted to tell you, when I
wrote to you I tried to have you understand, that if there arose a
question of honestly helping you, of protecting you, and the partnership
stood between me and that act of honorable service, I would crush the
partnership like an eggshell, and put all my powers at your disposal.But I am afraid you did not understand.”

The two girls looked at each other, and then at the strong face before
them, with the focussed light of the argand burner upon it.“No,” said Kate, “I am afraid we didn’t.”

“And so I say to you now,” pursued Reuben, with a sense of exultation
in the resolute words as they sounded on his ear, “I will not allow any
professional chimeras to bind me to inactivity, to acquiescence, if
a wrong is being done to you.And more, I will do all that lies in my
power to help you understand the whole situation.And if, when it is
all mapped out before us, you need my assistance to set crooked things
straight, why, with all my heart you shall have it, and the partnership
shall go out of the window.”

“If you had said that at the beginning,” sighed Kate.“Ah, then I did not know what I know now!” answered Reuben, holding her
eyes with his, while the light on his face grew ruddier.“Well, then, this is what I can tell you,” said the elder girl, “and I
am to tell it to you as our lawyer, am I not--our lawyer in the sense
that Mr.Boyce is mamma’s lawyer?”

Reuben bowed, and settled himself in his chair to listen.It was a long
recital, broken now by suggestions from Ethel, now by questions from the
lawyer.From time to time he made notes on the blotter before him, and
when the narrative was finished he spent some moments in consulting
these, and combining them with figures from another paper, in new
columns.Then he said, speaking slowly and with deliberation:

“This I take to be the situation: You are millionnaires, and are in a
strait for money.When I say ‘you’ I speak of your mother and yourselves
as one.Your income, which formerly gave you a surplus of sixty thousand
or seventy thousand dollars a year for new investments, is all at once
not large enough to pay the interest on your debts, let alone your
household and personal expenses.It came from three sources--the furnaces, the telegraph stock, and a
group of minor properties.These furnaces and iron-mines, which were all
your own until you were persuaded to put a mortgage on them, have
been closed by the orders of outsiders with whom you were persuaded to
combine.Telegraph competition has
cut down your earnings from the Northern Union stock to next to nothing.No doubt we shall find that your income from the other properties has
been absorbed in salaries voted to themselves by the men into whose
hands you have fallen.That is a very old trick, and I shall be
surprised if it does not turn up here.In the second place, you are
heavily in debt.On the 1st of January next, you must borrow money,
apparently, to pay the interest on this debt.What makes it the harder
is that you have not, as far as I can discover, had any value received
whatever for this debt.In other words, you are being swindled out of
something like one hundred thousand dollars per year, and not even such
a property as your father left can stand _that_ very long.I should say
it was high time you came to somebody for advice.”

Before this terribly lucid statement the two girls sat aghast.It was Ethel who first found something to say.“We never dreamed of
this, Mr.Tracy,” she said, breathlessly.“Our idea in coming, what we
thought of most, was the poor people being thrown out of work in the
winter, like this, and it being in some way, _our_ fault!”

“People _think_ it is our fault,” interposed Kate.“Only to-day, as we
were driving here, there were some men standing on the corner, and one
of them called out a very cruel thing about us, as if we had personally
injured him.But what you tell me--is it really as bad as that?”

“I am afraid it is quite as bad as I have pictured it.”

“And what is to be done?There must be some way to stop it,” said Kate.“You will put these men in prison the first thing, won’t you, Mr.Who are the men who are robbing
us?”

Reuben smiled gravely, and ignored the latter question.“There are a
good many first things to do,” he said.“I must think it all over very
carefully before any step is taken.But the very beginning will be, I
think, for you both to revoke the power of attorney your mother holds
for you, and to obtain a statement of her management of the trusteeship
over your property.”

“She will refuse it plump!You don’t know mamma,” said Ethel.“She couldn’t refuse if the demand were made regularly, could she, Mr.He shook his head, and she went on: “But it seems
dreadful not to act _with_ mamma in the matter.Just think what a
situation it will be, to bring our lawyer up to fight her lawyer!It
sounds unnatural, doesn’t it?Tracy, if you were to
speak to her now--”

“No, that could hardly be, unless she asked me,” returned the lawyer.“Well, then, if I told her all you said, or you wrote it out for me to
show her.”

“No, nor that either,” said Reuben.“To speak frankly, Miss Minster,
your mother is perhaps the most difficult and dangerous element in the
whole problem.I hope you won’t be offended--but that any woman in
her senses could have done what she seems to have done, is almost
incredible.”

“Poor mamma!” commented Ethel.“She never would listen to advice.”

“Unfortunately, that is just what she has done,” broke in Kate.Tracy, tell me candidly, is it possible that the man who advised her
to do these things--or rather the two men, both lawyers, who advised
her--could have done so honestly?”

“I should say it was impossible,” answered Reuben, after a pause.Again the two girls exchanged glances, and then Kate, looking at her
watch, rose to her feet.Tracy,” she said,
offering him her hand, and unconsciously allowing him to hold it in
his own as she went on: “We are both deeply indebted to you.We want
you--oh, so much!--to help us.We will do everything you say; we will
put ourselves completely in your hands, won’t we, Ethel?”

The younger sister said “Yes, indeed!” and then smiled as she furtively
glanced up into Kate’s face and thence downward to her hand.Kate
herself with a flush and murmur of confusion withdrew the fingers which
the lawyer still held.“Then you must begin,” he said, not striving very hard to conceal the
delight he had had from that stolen custody of the gloved hand,
“by resolving not to say a word to anybody--least of all to your
mother--about having consulted me.You must realize that we have to
deal with criminals--it is a harsh word, I know, but there can be no
other--and that to give them warning before our plans are laid would be
a folly almost amounting to crime itself.If I may, Miss Kate”--there
was a little gulp in his throat as he safely passed this perilous first
use of the familiar name--“I will write to you to-morrow, outlining my
suggestions in detail, telling you what to do, perhaps something of
what I am going to do, and naming a time--subject, of course, to your
convenience--when we would better meet again.”

Thus, after some further words on the same lines, the interview ended.Reuben went to the door with them, and would have descended to the
street to bear them company, but they begged him not to expose himself
to the cold, and so, with gracious adieus, left him in his office and
went down, the narrow, unlighted staircase, picking their way.On the landing, where some faint reflection of the starlight and
gas-light outside filtered through the musty atmosphere, Kate paused
a moment to gather the weaker form of her sister protectingly close to
her.“Are you utterly tired out, pet?” she asked.“I’m afraid it’s been too
much for you.”

“Oh, no,” said Ethel.“Only--yes, I am tired of one thing--of your
slowness of perception.Tracy has been just
burning to take up our cause ever since he first saw you.You thought
he was indifferent, and all the while he was over head and ears in love
with you!I watched him every moment, and it was written all over his
face; and you never saw it!”

The answering voice fell with a caressing imitation of reproof upon the
darkness: “You silly puss, you think everybody is in love with me!” it
said.Then the two young ladies, furred and tippeted, emerged upon the
sidewalk, stepped into their carriage, and were whirled off homeward
under the starlight.A few seconds later, two other figures, a woman and a child, also
emerged from this same stairway, and, there being no coachman in waiting
for them, started on foot down the street.The woman was Jessica Lawton,
and she walked wearily with drooping head and shoulders, never once
looking at the little boy whose hand she held, and who followed her in
wondering patience.She had stood in the stairway, drawn up against the wall to let these
descending ladies pass.She had heard all they said, and had on the
instant recognized Kate Minster’s voice.For a moment, in this darkness
suddenly illumined by Ethel’s words, she had reflected.Then she, too,
had turned and come down the stairs again.It seemed best, under these
new circumstances, not to see Reuben Tracy just now.And as she slowly
walked home, she almost forgot the existence of the little boy, so
deeply was her mind engaged with what she had heard.As for Reuben, the roseate dreams had all come back.From the drear
mournfulness of chill November his heart had leaped, by a fairy
transition, straight into the bowers of June, where birds sang and
fountains plashed, and beauty and happiness were the only law.It would
be time enough to-morrow to think about this great struggle with cunning
scoundrels for the rescue of a princely fortune, which opened before
him.This evening his mind should dwell upon nothing but thoughts of
_her!_

And so it happened that an hour later, when he decided to lock up the
office and go over to supper, he had never once remembered that the
Lawton girl’s appointment remained unkept.CHAPTER XXVI.--OVERWHELMING DISCOMFITURE.Horace Boyce returned to Thessaly the next morning and drove at
once to his father’s house.There, after a longer and more luxurious
bath than usual, he breakfasted at his leisure, and then shaved and
dressed himself with great care.He had brought some new clothes from
New York, and as he put them on he did not regret the long detour to the
metropolis, both in going to and coming from Pittsburg, which had been
made in order to secure them.The frock coat was peculiarly to his
liking.No noble dandy in all the West End of London owed his tailor for
a more perfectly fitting garment.It was not easy to decide as to the
neckwear which should best set off the admirable upper lines of this
coat, but at last he settled on a lustreless, fine-ribbed tie of white
silk, into which he set a beautiful moonstone pin that Miss Kate had
once praised.Decidedly, the _ensemble_ left nothing to be desired.Horace, having completely satisfied himself, took off the coat again,
went down-stairs in his velveteen lounging-jacket, and sought out his
father in the library, which served as a smoking-room for the two men.The General sat in one chair, with his feet comfortably disposed on
another, and with a cup of coffee on still a third at his side.He was
reading that morning’s Thessaly _Banner_, through passing clouds of
cigar-smoke.“Hello, you’re back, are you?” was his greeting to his son.“I see the
whole crowd of workmen in your rolling-mills decided last night not to
submit to the new scale; unanimous, the paper says.Seen it?”

“No, but I guessed they would,” said Horace, nonchalantly.“They can all
be damned.”

The General turned over his paper.“There’s an editorial,” he went on,
“taking the workmen’s side, out and out.Says there’s something very
mysterious about the whole business.Winds up with a hint that
steps will be taken to test the legality of the trust, and probe
the conspiracy that underlies it.Those are the words--‘probe the
conspiracy.’ Evidently, you’re going to have John Fairchild in your
wool.He’s a good fighter, once you get him stirred up.”

“He can be damned, too,” said Horace, taking a chair and lighting a
cigar.“These free-trade editors make a lot of noise, but they don’t
do anything else.They’re merely blue-bottle flies on a window-pane--a
deuce of a nuisance to nervous people, that’s all.I’m not nervous,
myself.”

The General smiled with good-humored sarcasm at his offspring.“Seems
to me it wasn’t so long ago that you were tarred with the same brush
yourself,” he commented.“Most fellows are free-traders until it touches their own pockets, or
rather until they get something in their pockets to be touched.Then
they learn sense,” replied Horace.“You can count them by thousands,” said the General.“But what of the
other poor devils--the millions of consumers who pay through the nose,
in order to keep those pockets full, eh?They never seem to learn
sense.”

Horace smiled a little, and then stretched out his limbs in a
comprehensive yawn.“I can’t sleep on the cars as well as I used to,”
 he said, in explanation.“I almost wish now I’d gone to bed when I got
home.I don’t want to be sleepy _this_ afternoon, of all times.”

The General had returned to his paper.“I see there’s a story afloat
that you chaps mean to bring in French Canadian workmen, when the other
fellows are locked out.I thought there was a contract labor law against
that.”

Horace yawned again, and then, rising, poured out a little glassful of
spirits from a bottle on the mantel, and tossed it off.“No,” he said,
“it’s easy enough to get around that.Wendover is up to all those
dodges.Besides, I think they are already domiciled in Massachusetts.”

“Vane” Boyce laid down the paper and took off his eye-glasses.“I hope
these fellows haven’t got you into a scrape,” he remarked, eyeing his
son.“I don’t more than half like this whole business.”

“Don’t you worry,” was Horace’s easy response.“I’ll take good care of myself.If it comes to ‘dog eat dog,’ they’ll
find my teeth are filed down to a point quite as sharp as theirs are.”

“Maybe so,” said the father, doubtfully.“But that Tenney--he’s got eyes
in the back of his head.”

“My dear fellow,” said Horace, with a pleasant air of patronage, “he’s a
mere child compared with Wendover.But I’m not afraid of them both.I’m
going to play a card this afternoon that will take the wind out of both
their sails.When that is done, I’ll be in a position to lay down the
law to them, and read the riot act too, if necessary.”

The General looked inquiry, and Horace went on: “I want you to call for
me at the office at three, and then we’ll go together to the Minsters.I wouldn’t smoke after luncheon, if I were you.I’m not going down until
afternoon.I’ll explain to you what my idea is as we walk out there.You’ve got some ‘heavy father’ business to do.”

Horace lay at his ease for a couple of hours in the big chair his father
had vacated, and mused upon the splendor of his position.This afternoon
he was to ask Kate Minster to be his wife, and of the answer he had
no earthly doubt.His place thus made secure, he had some highly
interesting things to say to Wendover and Tenney.He had fathomed
their plans, he thought, and could at the right moment turn them to his
advantage.He had not paid this latest visit to the iron magnates of
Pennsylvania for nothing.He saw that Wendover had counted upon their
postponing all discussion of the compensation to be given the Minsters
for the closing of their furnaces until after January 1, in order that
when that date came, and Mrs.Minster had not the money to pay the
half-yearly twelve thousand dollars interest on the bonds, she would be
compelled to borrow still more from him, and thus tighten the hold which
he and Tenney had on the Minster property.It was a pretty scheme, but
Horace felt that he could block it.For one thing, he was certain that
he could induce the outside trust directors to pass upon the question
of compensation long before January.And even if this failed, he could
himself raise the money which Mrs.Then he would turn around and demand an accounting from these scoundrels
of the four hundred thousand dollars employed in buying the machinery
rights, and levy upon the plant of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company,
if necessary, to secure Mrs.It became all very
clear to his mind, now he thought it over, and he metaphorically snapped
his fingers at Wendover and Tenney as he went up-stairs and once more
carefully dressed himself.The young man stopped in the hall-way as he came down and enjoyed a
comprehensive view of himself in the large mirror which was framed
by the hat-rack.The frock coat and the white effect at the neck were
excellent.The heavy fur collar of the outer coat only heightened their
beauty, and the soft, fawn-tinted suède gloves were quite as charming
in the contrast they afforded under the cuffs of the same costly fur.Horace put his glossy hat just a trifle to one side, and was too happy
even to curse the climate which made rubbers over his patent-leather
shoes a necessity.He remembered that minute before the looking-glass, in the after-time,
as the culmination of his upward career.It was the proudest, most
perfectly contented moment of his adult life.*****

“There is something I want to say to you before you go.”

Reuben Tracy stood at the door of a small inner office, and looked
steadily at his partner as he uttered these words.There was little doing in the law in these few dead-and-alive weeks
between terms, and the exquisitely dressed Horace, having gone through
his letters and signed some few papers, still with one of his gloves
on, had decided not to wait for his father, but to call instead at the
hardware store.“I am in a bit of a hurry just now.” he said, drawing on the other
glove.“I may look in again before dinner.Won’t it keep till then?”

“It isn’t very long,” answered Reuben.“I’ve concluded that the
partnership was a mistake.It is open to either of us to terminate it at
will.I wish you would look around, and let me know as soon as you see
your way to--to--”

“To getting out,” interposed Horace.In his present mood the idea rather
pleased him than otherwise.“With the greatest pleasure in the world.You have not been alone in thinking that the partnership was a mistake,
I can assure you.”

“Then we understand each other?”

“Perfectly.”

“And you will be back, say at--”

“Say at half-past five.”

“Half-past five be it,” said Reuben, turning back again to his desk.Horace made his way across the muddy high street and found his father,
who smelt rather more of tobacco than could have been wished, but
otherwise was in complete readiness.“By the way,” remarked the young man, as the two walked briskly along,
“I’ve given Tracy notice that I’m going to leave the firm.I daresay we
shall separate almost immediately.The business hasn’t been by any means
up to my expectations, and, besides, I have too much already to do for
the Minster estate, and am by way, now, of having a good deal more.”

“I’m sorry, for all that,” said the General.“Tracy is a first-rate,
honest, straightforward fellow.It always did me good to feel that you
were with him.To tell you the truth, my boy,” he went on after a pause,
“I’m damnably uneasy about your being so thick with Tenney and that
gang, and separating yourself from Tracy.It has an unsafe look.”

“Tracy is a tiresome prig,” was Horace’s comment.“I’ve stood him quite
long enough.”

The conversation turned now upon the object of their expedition,
and when this had been explained to the General, and his part in it
outlined, he had forgotten his forebodings about his son’s future.That son himself, as he strode along, with his head well up and his
shoulders squared, was physically an object upon which the paternal eye
could look with entire pride.The General said to himself that he
was not only the best-dressed, but the handsomest young fellow in
all Dearborn County; and from this it was but a mental flash to the
recollection that the Boyces had always been handsome fellows, and the
old soldier recalled with satisfaction how well he himself had felt that
he looked when he rode away from Thessaly at the head of his regiment
after the firing on Fort Sumter.Minster came down alone to the drawingroom to receive her visitors,
and showed by her manner some surprise that the General accompanied his
son.“I rather wanted to talk with you about what you learned at Pittsburg,”
 she said, somewhat bluntly, to Horace, after conversation on ordinary
topics had begun to flag.“Pray let me go into the library for a time,
I beg of you,” he said, in his courtly, cheery manner.“I know the way,
and I can amuse myself there till you want me; that is,” he added, with
a twinkle in his eye, “if you decide that you want me at all.”

Mrs.She did not quite understand
what this stout, red-faced man meant by being wanted, and she was
extremely anxious to know all that her lawyer had to tell her about the
trust.What he had to tell her was eminently satisfactory.The directors
had postponed the question of how much money should be paid for the
shutting-down of the Minster furnaces, simply because it was taken
for granted that so opulent a concern could not be in a hurry about
a settlement.He was sure that he could have the affair all arranged
before December.As to other matters, he was equally confident.A year
hence she would be in vastly better condition, financially, than she
had ever been before.Then Horace began to introduce the subject nearest his heart.The family
had been excessively kind to him during the summer, he said.He had
been privileged to meet them on terms of almost intimacy, both here and
elsewhere.Every day of this delightful intercourse had but strengthened
his original desire.True to his word, he had never uttered a syllable
of what lay on his heart to Miss Kate, but he was not without confidence
that she looked upon him favorably.They had seemed always the best
of friends, and she had accepted from him attentions which must have
shadowed forth to her, at least vaguely, the state of his mind.He had
brought his father--in accordance with what he felt to be the courtesy
due from one old family to another--to formally speak with her upon the
subject, if she desired it, and then he himself, if she thought it best,
would beg for an interview with Miss Kate.Minster think it
preferable to leave this latter to the sweet arbitrament of chance?Horace looked so well in his new clothes, and talked with such fluency
of feeling, and moreover had brought such comforting intelligence
about the business troubles, that Mrs.Minster found herself at the end
smiling on him maternally, and murmuring some sort of acquiescence to
his remarks in general.“Then shall I bring in my father?” He asked the question eagerly, and
rising before she could reply, went swiftly to the door of the hall and
opened it.Then he stopped with abruptness, and held the door open with a hand that
began to tremble as the color left his face.A voice in the hall was speaking, and with such sharply defined
distinctness and high volume that each word reached even the mother
where she sat.“_You may tell your son, General Boyce,”_ said this voice, _“that I will
not see him.I am sorry to have to say it to you, who have always been
polite to me, but your son is not a good man or an honest man, and I
wish never to see him again.With all my heart I wish, too, that we
never had seen him, any of us._”

An indistinct sound of pained remonstrance arose outside as the echoes
of this first voice died away.Then followed a noise of footsteps
ascending the carpeted stairs, and Horace’s empty, staring eyes had a
momentary vision of a woman’s form passing rapidly upward, away from
him.Then he stood face to face with his father--a bleared, swollen,
indignant countenance it was that thrust itself close to his--and he
heard his father say, huskily:

“I am going.Let us get out of this house.”

Horace mechanically started to follow.Then he remembered that he had
left his hat behind, and went back into the drawing-room where Mrs.The absence of deep emotion on her statuesque face
momentarily restored his own presence of mind.“You have heard your daughter?” he said, his head hanging in spite of
himself, but his eyes keeping a strenuous scrutiny upon her face.“Yes: I don’t know what has come over Kate, lately,” remarked Mrs.Minster; “she always was the most curious girl.”

“Curious, indeed!” He choked down the sneer which tempted him, and went
on slowly: “You heard what she said--that I was dishonest, wicked.Where
she has suddenly got this new view of me, doesn’t matter--at least, just
at this moment.But I surely ought to ask if you--if you share it.Of
course, if I haven’t your confidence, why, I must lay down everything.”

“Oh, mercy, no!You mustn’t think of it,” the lady said, with animation.“I’m sure I don’t know in the least what it all means.It makes my head
ache sometimes wondering what they will do next--Kate, especially.No,
you mustn’t mind her.You really mustn’t.”

The young man’s manner had gradually taken on firmness, as if under
a coat of ice.Minster had a
novel glitter in it now.“Then I am to remain your lawyer, in spite of this, as if it hadn’t
happened?”

“Why, bless me, yes!You must see me through this
dreadful trust business, though, as you say, it must all be better in
the end than ever before.”

“Good-day, Mrs.I shall continue, then, to hold myself at your
service.”

He spoke with the same grave slowness, and bowed formally, as if to go.The lady rose, and of her own volition offered him her hand.“Perhaps
things will alter in her mind.I am so sorry!” she said.The young man permitted himself a ghostly half-smile.“It is only when I
have thought it all over that I shall know whether I am sorry or not,”
 he said, and bowing again he left her.Out by the gate, standing on the gravel-path wet with November rain and
strewn with damp, fallen leaves, the General waited for him.The air had
grown chill, and the sky was spreading a canopy for the night of gloomy
gray clouds.The two men, without a word, fell into step, and walked
down the street together.Horace, striding silently along with his teeth tight set, his head bowed
and full of fierce confusion of thought, and his eyes angrily fixed
on the nothing straight ahead, became, all at once, aware that his
office-boy was approaching on the sidewalk, whistling dolefully to suit
the weather, and carrying his hands in his pockets.“Where are you going, Robert?” the lawyer demanded, stopping the lad,
and speaking with the aggressive abruptness of a man longing to affront
all about him.Minster’s,” answered the boy, wondering what was up, and
confusedly taking his hands out of his pockets.“What for?” This second question was even more sharply put.Tracy.” The boy took a letter from the inside of
his coat, and then added: “I said Mrs.Minster, but the letter is for
her daughter.I’m to give it to her herself.”

“I’ll take charge of it myself,” said Horace, with swift decision,
stretching out his hand.But another hand was reached forth also, and grasped the young man’s
extended wrist with a vehement grip.you won’t!” swore the General, his face purpling with the
rush of angry blood, and his little gray eyes flashing.“No, sir, you
won’t!” he repeated; and then, bending a momentary glance upon the boy,
he snapped out: “Well, you!Go and do your
errand as you were told!”

The office-boy started with a run to obey his command, and did not
slacken his pace until he had turned a corner.He had never encountered
a real general in action before, and the experience impressed him.Father and son looked in silence into each other’s faces for an instant.Then the father said, with something between a curse and a groan:

“My God!You _are_ a damned scoundrel!”

“Well, however that may be,” replied Horace, frowning, “I’m not in the
mood just now to take any cheek, least of all from you!”

As the General stared at him with swelling rage in his fat face, and
quivering, inarticulate lips, his son went on in a bitter voice, from
between clinched teeth:

“I owe this to you!Everything I did was done to
lift you out of the gutter, to try and make a man of you again, to put
you back into decent society--to have the name of Boyce something else
once more besides a butt for bar-keepers and factory-girls.I had you
around my neck like a mill-stone, and you’ve pulled me down.I hope
you’re satisfied!”

For a moment it seemed as if the General would fall.His thick neck grew
scarlet, his eyes turned opaque and filled with tears, and he trembled
and almost tottered on his legs.Then the fit passed as suddenly as
it had come.He threw a sweeping glance up and down the figure of his
son--taking in the elegant line of the trousers, the costly fur, the
delicate, spotless gloves, the white jewelled neckwear, the shining
hat, the hardened and angry face beneath it--and then broke boisterously
forth into a loud guffaw of contemptuous laughter.When he had laughed his fill, he turned upon his heel without a word
and walked away, carrying himself with proud erectness, and thumping his
umbrella on the sidewalk with each step as he went.When Thessaly awoke one morning some fortnight later, and rubbed its
eyes, and, looking again, discovered in truth that everything outside
was white, the recognition of the familiar visitor was followed by a
sigh.The children still had a noisy friendliness of greeting for the
snow, and got out their sleds and bored anticipatory holes in their
boot-heels with a thrill of old-time enthusiasm; but even their delight
became subdued in its manifestations before noon had arrived--their
elders seemed to take the advent of winter so seriously.Villagers,
when they spoke to one another that morning, noted that the voice of
the community had suddenly grown graver in tone and lower in pitch.The
threat of the approaching season weighed with novel heaviness on the
general mind.For the first time since the place had begun its manufacturing career,
Thessaly was idle.The Minster furnaces had been closed for more than
two weeks; the mills of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company, for nearly
that length of time.Half the bread-winners in the town were out of work
and saw no prospect of present employment.Usage is most of all advantageous _in_ adversity; These artisans of
Thessaly lacked experience in enforced idleness and the trick of making
bricks without straw.Employment, regular and well requited, had become
so much a matter of course that its sudden cessation now bewildered
and angered them.Each day brought to their minds its fresh train of
calamitous consequences.Children needed shoes; the flour-barrel was
nearly empty; to lay in a pig for the winter might now be impossible.The question of rent quarter loomed black and menacing like a
thunder-cloud on the horizon; and there were those with mortgages
on their little homes, who already saw this cloud streaked with the
lightning of impending tempest.Anxious housewives began to retrench at
the grocer’s and butcher’s; but the saloons and tobacco shops had almost
doubled their average of receipts.Even on ordinary holidays the American workman, bitten as he is with the
eager habitude of labor, more often than not some time during the day
finds himself close to the place where at other times he is employed.There his thoughts are: thither his steps all unconsciously bend
themselves.So now, in this melancholy, indefinite holiday which
November had brought to Thessaly, the idlers instinctively hung about
the deserted works.The tall, smokeless chimneys, the locked gates,
the grimy windows--through which the huge dark forms of the motionless
machines showed dimly, like the fossils of extinct monsters in a
museum--the dreary stretches of cinder heaps and blackened waste
which surrounded the silent buildings--all these had a cruel kind of
fascination for the dispossessed toilers.They came each day and stood lazily about in groups: they smoked in
taciturnity, told sardonic stories, or discussed their grievance, each
according to his mood; but they kept their eyes on the furnaces and
mills whence wages came no more and where all was still.There was
something in it akin in pathos to the visits a mother pays to the
graveyard where her child lies hidden from sight under the grass and the
flowers.It was the tomb of their daily avocation that these men came to
look at.But, as time went on, there grew to be less and less of the pathetic
in what these men thought and said.The sense of having been wronged
swelled within them until there was room for nothing but wrath.In a
general way they understood that a trust had done this thing to them.But that was too vague and far-off an object for specific cursing.The
Minster women were nearer home, and it was quite clear that they were
the beneficiaries of the trust’s action.There were various stories told
about the vast sum which these greedy women had been paid by the trust
for shutting down their furnaces and stopping the output of iron ore
from their fields, and as days succeeded one another this sum steadily
magnified itself.The Thessaly Manufacturing Company, which concerned a much larger number
of workmen, stood on a somewhat different footing.Mechanics who knew
men who were friendly with Schuyler Tenney learned in a roundabout
fashion that he really had been forced into closing the mills by the
action of the Minster women.When you came to think of it, this seemed
very plausible.Then the understanding sifted about among the men that
the Minsters were, in reality, the chief owners of the Manufacturing
Company, and that Tenney was only a business manager and minor partner,
who had been overruled by these heartless women.All this did not make
friends for Tenney.The lounging workmen on the street comers eyed him
scowlingly when he went by, but their active hatred passed him over and
concentrated itself upon the widow and daughters of Stephen Minster.On
occasion now, when fresh rumors of the coming of French Canadian workmen
were in the air, very sinister things were muttered about these women.Before the lockout had been two days old, one of the State officers of a
labor association had visited Thessaly, had addressed a hastily convened
meeting of the ejected workmen, and had promised liberal assistance
from the central organization.He had gone away again, but two or three
subordinate officials of the body had appeared in town and were still
there.They professed to be preparing detailed information upon which
their chiefs could act intelligently.They had money in their pockets,
and displayed a quite metropolitan freedom about spending it over
the various bars.Some of the more conservative workmen thought these
emissaries put in altogether too much time at these bars, but they were
evidently popular with the great bulk of the men.They had a large fund
of encouraging reminiscence about the way bloated capitalists had been
beaten and humbled and brought down to their knees elsewhere in the
country, and they were evidently quite confident that the workers would
win this fight, too.John went to the office.Just how it was to be won no one mentioned, but
when the financial aid began to come in it would be time to talk about
that.And when the French Canadians came, too, it would be time--The
rest of this familiar sentence was always left unspoken, but lowering
brows and significant nods told how it should be finished.So completely did this great paralytic stroke to industry monopolize
attention, that events in the village, not immediately connected with
it, passed almost unnoticed.Nobody gave a second thought, for example,
to the dissolution of the law firm of Tracy & Boyce, much less dreamed
of linking it in any way with the grand industrial drama which engaged
public interest.Horace, at the same time, took rooms at the new brick hotel, the
Central, which had been built near the railroad depot, and opened an
office of his own a block or two lower down Main Street than the one he
had vacated.This did not attract any special comment, and when, on the
evening of the 16th of November, a meeting of the Thessaly Citizens’
Club was convened, fully half those who attended learned there for the
first time that the two young lawyers had separated.The club at last had secured a building for itself--or rather the
refusal of one--and this meeting was called to decide upon ratifying
the purchase.It was held in a large upper room of the building under
discussion, which had been the gymnasium of a German Turn Verein, and
still had stowed away in its comers some of the apparatus that the
athletes had used.When Horace, as president, called the gathering to order, there were
some forty men present, representing very fairly the business and
professional classes of the village.Schuyler Tenney was there as one
of the newer members; and Reuben Tracy, with John Fairchild, Dr.Lester,
Father Chance, and others of the founders, sat near one another farther
back in the hall.The president, with ready facility, laid before the meeting the business
at hand.The building they were in could be purchased, or rented on a
reasonably extended lease.It seemed to the committee better to take it
than to think of erecting one for themselves--at least for the present.So much money would be needed: so much for furniture, so much for
repairs, etc.; so much for heating and lighting, so much for service,
and so on--a very compact and lucid statement, indeed.A half hour was passed in more or less inconclusive discussion before
Reuben Tracy rose to his feet and began to speak.The story that he and
Boyce were no longer friends had gone the round of the room, and some
men turned their chairs to give him the closer attention with eye and
ear.Before long all were listening with deep interest to every word.Reuben started by saying that there was something even more important
than the question of the new building, and that was the question of what
the club itself meant.In its inception, the idea of creating machinery
for municipal improvement had been foremost.Certainly he and those
associated with him in projecting the original meeting had taken that
view of their work.That meeting had contented itself with an indefinite
expression of good intentions, but still had not dissented from the idea
that the club was to mean something and to do something.Now it became
necessary, before final steps were taken, to ask what that something
was to be.So far as he gathered, much thought had been given as to
the probable receipts and expenditure, as to where the card-room, the
billiard-room, the lunch-room, and so forth should be located, and as to
the adoption of all modern facilities for making themselves comfortable
in their new club-house.But about the original objects of the club
he had not heard a syllable.To him this attitude was profoundly
unsatisfactory.At the present moment, the village was laboring under
a heavy load of trouble and anxiety.Nearly if not quite a thousand
families were painfully affected by the abrupt stoppage of the
two largest works in the section.If actual want was not already
experienced, at least the vivid threat of it hung over their poorer
neighbors all about them.This fact, it seemed to him, must appeal to
them all much more than any conceivable suggestion about furnishing a
place in which they might sit about at their ease in leisure hours.He
put it to the citizens before him, that their way was made exceptionally
clear for them by this calamity which had overtaken their village.If
the club meant anything, it must mean an organization to help these poor
people who were suddenly, through no fault of their own, deprived of
incomes and employment.That was something vital, pressing, urgent;
easy-chairs and billiard-tables could wait, but the unemployed artisans
of Thessaly and their families could not.This in substance was what Reuben said; and when he had finished there
succeeded a curious instant of dead silence, and then a loud confusion
of comment.Half a dozen men were on their feet now, among them both
Tenney and John Fairchild.The hardware merchant spoke first, and what he said was not so prudent
as those who knew him best might have expected.The novel excitement of
speaking in public got into his head, and he not only used language
like a more illiterate man than he really was, but he attacked Tracy
personally for striving to foment trouble between capital and labor,
and thereby created an unfavorable impression upon the minds of his
listeners.Editor Fairchild had ready a motion that the building be taken on a
lease, but that a special committee be appointed by the meeting to
devise means for using it to assist the men of Thessaly now out of
employment, and that until the present labor crisis was over, all
questions of furnishing a club-house proper be laid on the table.He
spoke vigorously in support of this measure, and when he had finished
there was a significant round of applause.Horace rose when order had been restored, and speaking with some
hesitation, said that he would put the motion, and that if it were
carried he would appoint such a committee, but----

“I said ‘to be appointed by the meeting’!” called out John Fairchild,
sharply.The president did not finish his sentence, but sat down again, and
Tenney pushed forward and whispered in his ear.Two or three others
gathered sympathetically about, and then still others joined the group
formed about the president, and discussed eagerly in undertones this new
situation.“I must decline to put the motion.It is out of order,” answered Horace at last, as a result of this
faction conference.“Then I will put it myself,” cried Fairchild, rising.“But I beg
first to move that you leave the chair!” Horace looked with angered
uncertainty down upon the men who remained seated about Fairchild.They
were as thirty to his ten, or thereabouts.He could not stand up against
this majority.For a moment he had a fleeting notion of trying to
conciliate it, and steer a middle course, but Tenney’s presence had made
that impossible.He laid down his gavel, and, gathering up his hat and
coat, stepped off the platform to the floor.“There is no need of moving that,” he said.“I’ll go without it.So far
as I am concerned, the meeting is over, and the club doesn’t exist.”

He led the way out, followed by Tenney, Jones the match-manufacturer,
the Rev.One or two gentlemen rose
as if to join the procession, and then thinking better of it sat down
again.By general suggestion, John Fairchild took the chair thus vacated, but
beyond approving the outlines of his plan, and appointing a committee
with Tracy at its head to see what could be done to carry it out, the
meeting found very little to do.It was agreed that this committee
should also consider the question of funds, and should call a meeting
when it was ready to report, which should be at the earliest possible
date.Then the meeting broke up, and its members dispersed, not without
well-founded apprehensions that they had heard the last of the Thessaly
Citizens’ Club.CHAPTER XXVIII.--IN THE ROBBER’S CAVE.HORACE Boyce was too enraged to preserve a polite demeanor toward the
sympathizers who had followed him out of the hall, and who showed
a disposition to discuss the situation with him now the street was
reached.After a muttered word or two to Tenney, the young man abruptly
turned his back on the group, and walked with a hurried step down the
street toward his hotel.Entering the building, he made his way direct to the bar-room back of
the office--a place where he had rarely been before--and poured out for
himself a heavy portion of whiskey, which he drank off without noticing
the glass of iced water placed for him beside the bottle.He turned to
go, but came back again to the bar after he had reached the swinging
screen-doors, and said he would take a bottle of the liquor up to his
room.“I haven’t been sleeping well these last few nights,” he explained
to the bar-keeper.Once in his room, Horace put off his boots, got into easy coat and
slippers, raked down the fire, looked for an aimless minute or two at
the row of books on his shelf, and then threw himself into the arm-chair
beside the stove.The earlier suggestion of gray in his hair at the
temples had grown more marked these last few weeks, and there were new
lines of care on his clear-cut face, which gave it a haggard look now as
he bent his brows in rumination.An important interview with Tenney and Wendover was to take place in
this room a half hour later; but, besides a certain hard-drawn notion
that he would briskly hold his own with them, Horace did not try to form
plans for this or even to fasten his mind upon it.The fortnight or more that had passed since that terrible momentary
vision of Kate Minster running up the stairs to avoid him, had been to
the young man a period of unexampled gloominess and unrest, full of
deep wrath at the fate which had played upon him such a group of scurvy
tricks all at once, yet having room for sustained exasperation over the
minor discomforts of his new condition.The quarrel with his father had forced him to change his residence, and
this was a peculiarly annoying circumstance coming at just such a time.He realized now that he had been very comfortable in the paternal house,
and that his was a temperament extremely dependent upon well-ordered and
satisfactory surroundings.These new rooms of his, though they cost a
good deal of money, were not at all to his liking, and the service was
execrable.The sense of being at home was wholly lacking; he felt as
disconnected and out of touch with the life about him as if he had been
travelling in a foreign country which he did not like.The great humiliation and wrong--the fact that he had been rejected with
open contumely by the rich girl he had planned to marry--lay steadily
day and night upon the confines of his consciousness, like a huge black
morass with danger signals hung upon all its borders.His perverse mind
kept returning to view these menacing signals, and torturing him with
threats to disregard them and plunge into the forbidden darkness.The
constant strain to hold his thoughts back from this hateful abyss wore
upon him like an unremitting physical pain.The resolve which had chilled and stiffened him into self-possession
that afternoon in the drawingroom, and had even enabled him to speak
with cold distinctness to Mrs.Minster and to leave the house of insult
and defeat with dignity, had been as formless and unshaped as poor,
heart-torn, trembling Lear’s threat to his daughters before Gloster’s
gate.Revenge he would have--sweeping, complete, merciless, but by what
means he knew not.Two weeks were gone, and the revenge seemed measurably nearer, though
still its paths were all unmapped.It was clear enough to the young
man’s mind now that Tenney and Wendover were intent on nothing less than
plundering the whole Minster estate.Until that fatal afternoon in the
drawingroom, he had kept himself surrounded with an elaborate system of
self-deception.He had pretended to himself that the designs of these
associates of his were merely smart commercial plans, which needed only
to be watched with equal smartness.He knew the men to be villains, and openly rated them as such in his
thoughts.He had a stem satisfaction in the thought that their schemes were in
his hands.He would join them now, frankly and with all his heart,
only providing the condition that his share of the proceeds should
be safe-guarded.They should have his help to wreck this insolent,
purse-proud, newly rich family, to strip them remorselessly of their
wealth.His fellow brigands might keep the furnaces, might keep
everything in and about this stupid Thessaly.He would take his share in
hard coin, and shake the mud and slush of Dearborn County from off his
feet.He was only in the prime of his youth.Romance beckoned to him
from a hundred centres of summer civilization, where men knew how to
live, and girls added culture and dowries to beauty and artistic dress.The dream of a career in his native village had brought him delight only
so long as Kate Minster was its central figure.That vision now seemed
so clumsy and foolish that he laughed at it.He realized that he had
never liked the people here about him.Even the Minsters had been
provincial, only a gilded variation upon the rustic character of the
section.Nothing but the over-sanguine folly of youth could ever have
prompted him to think that he wanted to be mayor of Thessaly, or that it
would be good to link his fortunes with the dull, under-bred place.The two men for whom he had been waiting broke abruptly in upon his
revery by entering the room.They came in without even a show of
knocking on the door, and Horace frowned a little at their rudeness.Stout Judge Wendover panted heavily with the exertion of ascending the
stairs, and it seemed to have put him out of temper as well as breath.He threw off his overcoat with an impatient jerk, took a chair, and
gruffly grunted “How-de-do!” in the direction of his host, without
taking the trouble to even nod a salutation.Tenney also seated himself,
but he did not remove his overcoat.Even in the coldest seasons he
seemed to wear the same light, autumnal clothes, creaseless and gray,
and mouselike in effect.The two men looked silently at Horace, and he
felt that they disapproved his velveteen coat.“Well?” he asked, at last, leaning back in his chair and trying to equal
them in indifference.“What is new in New York, Judge?”

“Never mind New York!Thessaly is more in our line just now,” said
Wendover, sternly.“You’re welcome to my share
of the town, I’m sure,” he said; “I’m not very enthusiastic about it
myself.”

“How much has Reuben Tracy got to work on?How much have you blabbed
about our business to him?” asked the New Yorker.“I neither know nor care anything about Mr.Tracy,” said Horace, coldly.“As for what you elegantly describe as my ‘blabbing’ to him, I daresay
you understand what it means.I don’t.”

“It means that you have made a fool of us; got us into trouble; perhaps
ruined the whole business, by your God A’mighty stupidity!That’s
what it means!” said Wendover, with his little blue-bead eyes snapping
angrily in the lamplight.“I hope it won’t strike you as irrelevant if I suggest that this is my
room,” drawled Horace, “and that I have a distinct preference for civil
conversation in it.If you have any criticisms to offer upon my conduct,
as you seem to think that you have, I must beg that you couch them in
the language which gentlemen--”

“Gentlemen be damned!” broke in the Judge, sharply.“We’ve had too much
‘gentleman’ in this whole business!What
does Tracy mean by his applications?”

“I haven’t the remotest idea what you are talking about.I’ve already
told you that I know nothing of Mr.Tracy or his doings.”

Schuyler Tenney interposed, impassively: “He may not have heard of the
application, Judge.You must remember that, for the sake of appearances,
he then being in partnership, you were made Mrs.Minster’s attorney, in
both the agreements.That is how notices came to be served on you.”

The Judge had not taken his eyes off the young man in the velveteen
jacket.“Do you mean to tell me that you haven’t learned from Mrs.Minster that this man Tracy has made applications on behalf of the
daughters to upset the trust agreement, and to have a receiver appointed
to overhaul the books of the Mfg.Company?”

Horace sat up straight.“Good God, no!” he stammered.“I’ve heard
nothing of that.”

“You never do seem to hear about things.What did you suppose you were
here for, except to watch Mrs.Minster, and keep track of what was going
on?” demanded Wendover.“I may tell you,” answered Horace, speaking hesitatingly, “that
circumstances have arisen which render it somewhat difficult for me
to call upon Mrs.Minster at her house--for that matter, out of the
question.She has only been to my office office within the--the last
fortnight.”

Schuyler Tenney spoke again.“The ‘circumstances’ means, Judge, that
he--”

“Pardon me, Mr.Tenney,” said Horace, with decision: “what the
circumstances mean is neither your business nor that of your friend.That is something that we will not discuss, if you please.”

“Won’t we, though!” burst in Wendover, peremptorily.“You make a fool of
us.You go sneaking around one of the girls up there.You think you’ll
set yourself in a tub of butter, and let our schemes go to the devil.You get kicked out of the house
for your impudence.And then you sit here, dressed like an Italian
organ-grinder, by God, and tell me that we won’t discuss the subject!”

Horace rose to his feet, with all his veins tingling.“You may leave
this room, both of you,” he said, in a voice which he with difficulty
kept down.Judge Wendover rose, also, but it was not to obey Horace’s command.Instead, he pointed imperiously to the chair which the young man had
vacated.“Sit down there,” he shouted.I warn you, I’m in
no mood to be fooled with.You deserve to have your neck wrung for what
you’ve done already.If I have another word of cheek from you, by God,
it _shall_ be wrung!We’ll throw you on the dungheap as we would a dead
rat.”

Horace had begun to listen to these staccato sentences with his arms
folded, and lofty defiance in his glance.Somehow, as he looked into his
antagonist’s blazing eyes, his courage melted before their hot menace.The pudgy figure of the Judge visibly magnified itself under his gaze,
and the threat in that dry, husky voice set his nerves to quaking.“All right,” he said, in an altered voice.“I’m willing enough to talk,
only a man doesn’t like to be bullied in that way in his own house.”

“It’s a tarnation sight better than being bullied by a warder in Auburn
State’s prison,” said the Judge, as he too resumed his chair.“Take my
word for that.”

Schuyler Tenney crossed his legs nervously at this, and coughed.Horace
looked at them both in a mystified but uneasy silence.“You heard what I said?” queried Wendover, brusquely, after a moment’s
pause.“Undoubtedly I did,” answered Horace.“But--but its application escaped
me.”

“What I mean is”--the Judge hesitated for a moment to note Tenney’s mute
signal of dissuasion, and then went on: “We might as well not beat about
the bush--what I mean is that there’s a penitentiary job in this thing
for somebody, unless we all keep our heads, and have good luck to boot.You’ve done your best to get us all into a hole, with your confounded
airs and general foolishness.If worse comes to worst, perhaps we can
save ourselves, but there won’t be a ghost of a chance for you.I’ll see
to that myself.If we come to grief, you shall pay for it.”

“What do you mean?” asked Horace, in a subdued tone, after a period of
silent reflection.“Where does the penitentiary part come in?”

“I don’t agree with the Judge at all,” interposed Tenney, eagerly.“I
don’t think there’s any need of looking on the dark side of the thing.We don’t _know_ that Tracy knows anything.And then, why shouldn’t we be
able to get our own man appointed receiver?”

“This is the situation,” said Wendover, speaking deliberately.Minster to borrow four hundred thousand dollars for the
purchase of certain machinery patents, and you drew up the papers for
the operation.It happens that she already owned--or rather that the
Mfg.Company already owned--these identical rights and patents.They
were a part of the plant and business we put into the company at one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars when we moved over from Cadmus.But
nobody on her side, except old Clarke, knew just what it was that we put
in.He died in Florida, and it was arranged that his papers should
pass to you.There was no record that we had sold the right of the nail
machine.”

Horace gazed with bewilderment into the hard-drawn, serious faces of
the two men who sat across the little table from him.In the yellow
lamplight these countenances looked like masks, and he searched them in
vain for any sign of astonishment or emotion.The thing which was now
for the first time being put into words was strange, but as it shaped
itself in his mind he did not find himself startled.It was as if he had
always known about it, but had allowed it to lapse in his memory.These
men were thieves--and he was their associate!The room with its central
point of light where the three knaves were gathered, and its deepening
shadows round about, suggested vaguely to him a robber’s cave.Primary
instincts arose strong within him.Terror lest discovery should come
yielded precedence to a fierce resolve to have a share of the booty.It
seemed minutes to him before he spoke again.“Then she was persuaded to mortgage her property, to buy over again at
four times its value what she had already purchased?” he asked, with an
assumption of calmness.“That seems to be about what you managed to induce her to do,” said the
Judge, dryly.“Then you admit that it was I who did it--that you owe the success of
the thing to me!” The young man could not restrain his eagerness to
establish this point.He leaned over the table, and his eyes sparkled
with premature triumph.“No: I said ‘_seems_,’” answered Wendover._We_
know that from the start you have done nothing but swell around at our
expense, and create as many difficulties for us and our business
as possible.But the courts and the newspapers would look at it
differently._They_ would be sure to regard you as the one chiefly
responsible.”

“I should think we were pretty much in the same boat, my friend,” said
Horace, coldly.“I daresay,” replied the New Yorker, “only with this difference: we can
swim, and you can’t.By that I mean, we’ve got money, and you haven’t.See the point?”

Horace saw the point, and felt himself revolted at the naked selfishness
and brutality with which it was exposed.The disheartening fact that
these men would not hesitate for an instant to sacrifice him--that they
did not like him, and would not lift a finger to help him unless it was
necessary for their own salvation--rose gloomily before his mind.“Still, it would be better for all of us that the boat shouldn’t be
capsized at all,” he remarked.“That’s it--that’s the point,” put in Tenney, with animation; “that’s
what I said to the Judge.”

“This Tracy of yours,” said Wendover, “has got hold of the Minster
girls.He has been before Judge Waller with a
whole batch of applications.First, in chambers, he’s brought an action
to dissolve the trust, and asked for an order returnable at Supreme
Court chambers to show cause why, in the mean time, the furnaces
shouldn’t be opened.His grounds are, first, that the woman was
deceived; and second, that the trust is against public policy.Now,
it seems to me that our State courts can’t issue an order binding on
a board of directors at Pittsburg.Isn’t it a thing that belongs to a
United States court?How is that?”

“I’m sure I don’t know,” answered Horace.“It’s a new question to me.”

“Tenney told me you knew something as a lawyer,” was Wendover’s angry
comment.“I’d like to know where it comes in.”

The hardware merchant hastened to avert the threatened return to
personalities.“Tell him about the receiver motion,” he said.“Then Tracy, before the same judge, but in special term, has applied for
a receiver for the Thessaly Mfg.Company, on the ground of fraud.”

“That’s the meanest thing about the whole business,” commented Tenney.“Well, what do you advise doing?” asked Horace, despondently.“There are two things,” said Wendover.“First, to delay everything until
after New Year, when Mrs.Minster’s interest becomes due and can’t be
paid.That can be done by denying jurisdiction of the State court in the
trust business, and by asking for particulars in the receiver matter.The next thing is to make Thessaly too hot for those women, and for
Tracy, too, before New Year.If a mob should smash all the widow’s
windows for her, for instance, perhaps burn her stable, she’d be mighty
glad to get out of town, and out of the iron business, too.”

“But that wouldn’t shut Tracy up,” observed Tenney.“He sticks at things
like a bull-dog, once he gets a good hold.”

“I’m thinking about Tracy,” mused the Judge.Horace found himself regarding these two visitors of his with something
like admiration.The resourcefulness and resolution of their villainy
were really wonderful.Such
men would be sure to win, if victory were not absolutely impossible.At
least, there was nothing for it but to cordially throw in his lot with
them.“Whatever is decided upon, I’ll do my share,” he said, with decision.Upon reflection, he added: “But if I share the risks, I must be clearly
understood to also share the profits.”

Judge Wendover looked at the young man sternly, and breathed hard as he
looked.“Upon my word,” he growled at last, “you’re the cheekiest young
cub I’ve seen since before the war!”

Horace stood to his guns.“However that may be,” he said, “you see what
I mean.This is a highly opportune time, it strikes me, to discover just
how I stand in this matter.”

“You’ll stand where you’re put, or it will be the worse for you!”

“Surely,” Schuyler Tenney interposed, “you ought to have confidence that
we will do the fair thing.”

“My bosom may be simply overflowing with confidence in you both”--Horace
ventured upon a suggestion of irony in his intonation--“but experience
seems to indicate the additional desirability of an understanding.If you will think it over, I daresay you will gather the force of my
remark.”

The New Yorker seemed not to have heard the remark, much less to have
understood it.He addressed the middle space between Horace and Tenney
in a meditative way: “Those two speech-making fellows who are here from
the Amalgamated Confederation of Labor, or whatever it is, can both be
had to kick up a row whenever we like.They
notified me that they were coming here ten days ago.We can tell them
to keep their hands off the Canadians when they come next week, and
lead their crowd instead up to the Minster house.We’ll go over that
together, Tenney, later on.But about Tracy--perhaps these fellows
might--”

Wendover followed up the train of this thought in silence, with a
ruminative eye on vacancy.“What I was saying,” insisted Horace, “was that I wanted to know just
how I stand.”

“I suppose it’s out of the question to square Tracy,” pursued Wendover,
thinking aloud, “and that Judge Waller that he’s applied to, he’s just
another such an impracticable cuss.There’s no security for business at
all, when such fellows have the power to muddle and interfere with it.Tenney, _you_ know this Tracy.Why can’t you think of something?”

“As I remarked before,” Horace interposed once more, “what am I to get
out of this thing?”

This time the New Yorker heard him.He slowly turned his round,
white-framed face toward the speaker, and fixed upon him a penetrating
glance of wrath, suspicion, and dislike.“Oh, _that_ is what you want to know, is it?” he said, abruptly, after a
momentary silence.“Well, sir, if you had your deserts, you’d get
about seven years’ hard labor.As it is, you’ve had over seven thousand
dollars out of the concern, and you’ve done seven hundred thousand
dollars’ worth of damage.If you can make a speech before Judge Waller
this week that will stave off all these things until after New Year’s,
perhaps I may forgive you some of the annoyance and loss your infernal
idiocy and self-conceit have caused us.When you’ve done that, it will
be time enough to talk to me about giving you another chance to keep
your salary.You never made a bigger mistake
in your life than in thinking you could dictate terms to Peter Wendover,
now or any other time!Why, you poor empty-headed creature, who do you
suppose _you_ could frighten?You’re as helpless as a June-bug in a
cistern with the curb shut down.”

The Judge had risen while speaking, and put on his overcoat.He took his
hat now, and glanced to note that Tenney was also on his feet.Then he
added these further words to the young man, whose head was drooping in
spite of himself, and whose figure had sunk into a crouching posture in
the easy-chair:

“Let me give you some advice.Take precious good care not to annoy me
any more while this business is on.It was Tenney who picked you out, and who thought you could be useful.I didn’t believe in you from the start.Now that I’ve summered and
wintered you, I stand amazed, by God!that I could ever have let you get
mixed up in my affairs.But here you are, and it will be easier for us
to put up with you, and carry you along, than throw you out.Besides,
you may be able to do some good, if what I’ve said puts any sense into
your head.But don’t run away with the idea that you are necessary to
us, or that you are going to share anything, as you call it, or that you
can so much as lift your finger against us without first of all crushing
yourself.This is plain talk, and it may help you to size yourself up as
you really are.According to your own notion of yourself, God Almighty’s
overcoat would have about made you a vest.My idee of you is different,
you see, and I’m a good deal nearer right than you are.I’ll send the
papers over to you to-morrow, and let us see what you will do with
them.”

The New York magnate turned on his heel at this, and, without any word
of adieu, he and Tenney left the room.Horace sat until long after midnight in his chair, with the bottle
before him, half-dazed and overwhelmed amidst the shapeless ruins of his
ambition.CHAPTER XXIX.--THE MISTS CLEARING AWAY.REUBEN Tracy rose at an unwontedly early hour next morning, under the
spur of consciousness that he had a very busy day before him.While he
was still at his breakfast in the hotel dining-room, John Fairchild came
to keep an appointment made the previous evening, and the two men were
out on the streets together before Thessaly seemed wholly awake.Their first visit was to the owner of the building which the Citizens’
Club had thought of hiring, and their business here was promptly
despatched; thence they made their way to the house of a boss-carpenter,
and within the hour they had called upon a plumber, a painter, and one
or two other master artisans.By ten o’clock those of this number with
whom arrangements had been made had put in an appearance at the building
in question, and Tracy and Fairchild explained to them the plans which
they were to carry out.The discussion and settlement of these consumed
the time until noon, when the lawyer and the editor separated, and
Reuben went to his office.Here, as had been arranged, he found old ’Squire Gedney waiting
for him.A long interview behind the closed door of the inner office
followed, and when the two men came out the justice of the peace was
putting a roll of bills into his pocket.“This is Tuesday,” he said to Tracy.“I daresay I can be back by
Thursday.The bother about it is that Cadmus is such an out-of-the-way
place to get at.”

“At all events, I’ll count on seeing you Friday morning,” answered
Reuben.“Then, if you’ve got what I expect, we can go before the county
judge and get our warrants by Saturday, and that will be in plenty of
time for the grand jury next week.”

“If they don’t all eat their Christmas dinner in Auburn prison, call me
a Dutchman!” was Gedney’s confident remark, as he took his departure.Reuben, thus left alone, walked up and down the larger room in
pleased excitement, his hands in his pockets and his eyes aglow with
satisfaction.So all-pervasive was his delight that it impelled him
to song, and he hummed to himself as he paced the floor a faulty
recollection of a tune his mother had been fond of, many years before.Reuben had no memory for music, and knew neither the words nor the air,
but no winged outburst of exultation from a triumphant Viking in the
opera could have reflected a more jubilant mood.He had unearthed the conspiracy, seized upon its avenues of escape,
laboriously traced all its subterranean burrowings.Even without the
proof which it was to be hoped that Gedney could bring from Cadmus,
Reuben believed he had information enough to justify criminal
proceedings.Nothing could be clearer than guilty collusion between this
New Yorker, Wendover, and some of the heads of the pig-iron trust to rob
Mrs.At almost every turn and corner in the
ramification of the huge swindle, Tenney and Boyce also appeared.Reuben Tracy was the softest-hearted of men, but
it did not occur to him to relent when he thought of his late partner.To the contrary, there was a decided pleasure in the reflection that
nothing could avert well-merited punishment from this particular young
man.The triumph had its splendid public side, moreover.Great and lasting
good must follow such an exposure as he would make of the economic and
social evils underlying the system of trusts.A staggering blow would be
dealt to the system, and to the sentiment back of it that rich men might
do what they liked in America.With pardonable pride he thrilled at the
thought that his arm was to strike this blow.The effect would be felt
all over the country.It could not but affect public opinion, too, on
the subject of the tariff--that bomb-proof cover under which these
men had conducted their knavish operations.Reuben sang with increased
fervor as this passed through his mind.On his way back from luncheon--which he still thought of as
dinner--Reuben Tracy stopped for a few moments at the building he and
Fairchild had rented.The carpenters were already at work, ripping down
the partitions on the ground floor, in a choking and clamorous confusion
of dust and sound of hammering.The visible energy of these workmen and
the noise they made were like a sympathetic continuation of his song of
success.He would have enjoyed staying for hours, watching and listening
to these proofs that he at last was doing something to help move the
world around.When he came out upon the street again, it was to turn his steps to the
house of the Minsters.He had not been there since his visit in March,
and there was a certain embarrassment about his going now.Minster’s house, and he had been put in the position of acting
against her, as counsel for her daughters.It was therefore a somewhat
delicate business.But Miss Kate had asked him to come, and he would
be sincerely glad of the opportunity of telling Mrs.Minster the whole
truth, if she would listen to it.Just what form this opportunity might
take he could not foresee; but his duty was so clear, and his arguments
must carry such absolute conviction, that he approached the ordeal with
a light heart.Miss Kate came down into the drawing-room to receive him, and Reuben
noted with a deep joy that she again wore the loose robe of creamy
cloth, girdled by that same enchanted rope of shining white silk.Something made him feel, too, that she observed the pleased glance of
recognition he bestowed upon her garments, and understood it, and
was not vexed.Their relations had been distinctly cordial--even
confidential--for the past fortnight; but the reappearance of this
sanctified and symbolical gown--this mystical robe which he had
enshrined in his heart with incense and candles and solemn veneration,
as does the Latin devotee with the jewelled dress of the Bambino--seemed
of itself to establish a far more tender intimacy between them.He
became conscious, all at once, that she knew of his love.“I have asked mamma to see you,” she said, when they were seated, “and
I think she will.Since it was first suggested to her, she has wavered a
good deal, sometimes consenting, sometimes not.The poor lady is almost
distracted with the trouble in which we have all become involved, and
that makes it all the more difficult for her to see things in their
proper connection.I hope you may be able to show her just how matters
stand, and who her real friends are.”

The girl left at this, and in a few moments reappeared with her mother,
to whom she formally presented Mr.Minster had suffered great mental anguish since the troubles
came on, her countenance gave no hint of the fact.It was as regular and
imperturbable and deceptively impressive as ever, and she bore herself
with perfect self-possession, bowing with frosty precision, and seating
herself in silence.Reuben himself began the talk by explaining that the steps which he had
felt himself compelled to take in the interest of the daughters implied
not the slightest hostility to the mother.They had had, in fact, the
ultimate aim of helping her as well.He had satisfied himself that she
was in the clutch of a criminal conspiracy to despoil her estate
and that of her daughters.It was absolutely necessary to act
with promptness, and, as he was not her lawyer, to temporarily and
technically separate the interest of her daughters from her own, for
legal purposes.All that had been done was, however, quite as much to
her advantage as to that of her daughters, and when he had explained to
her the entire situation he felt sure she would be willing to allow him
to represent her as well as her daughters in the effort to protect the
property and defeat the conspiracy.Minster offered no comment upon this expression of confidence, and
Reuben went on to lay before her the whole history of the case.He
did this with great clearness--as if he had been talking to a
child--pointing out to her how the scheme of plunder originated, where
its first operations revealed themselves, and what part in turn each of
the three conspirators had played.She listened to it all with an expressionless face, and though she must
have been startled and shocked by a good deal of it, Reuben could gather
no indication from her manner of her feelings or her opinions.When he
had finished, and his continued silence rendered it clear that he was
not going to say any more, she made her first remark.“I’m much obliged to you, I’m sure,” she said, with no sign of emotion.“It was very kind of you to explain it to me.But of course _they_
explain it quite differently.”

“No doubt,” answered Reuben.“That is just what they would do.The
difference is that they have lied to you, and that I have told you what
the books, what the proofs, really show.”

“I have known Peter Wendover since we were children together,” she said,
after a momentary pause, “and _he_ never would have advised my daughters
to sue their own mother!”

Reuben suppressed a groan.Minster; least
of all, your daughters,” he tried to explain.“The actions I have
brought--that is, including the applications--are directed against the
men who have combined to swindle you, not at all against you.They might
just as well have been brought in your name also, only that I had no
power to act for you.”

“It is the same as suing me.Judge Wendover said so,” was her reply.“What I seek to have you realize is that Judge Wendover purposely
misleads you.He is the head and front of the conspiracy to rob you.I am going to have him indicted for it.The proofs are as plain as a
pikestaff.How, then, can you continue to believe what he tells you?”

“I quite believe that you mean well, Mr.“But
lawyers, you know, always take opposite sides.One lawyer tells you one
thing; then the other swears to precisely the contrary.Don’t think I
blame them.But you know what I mean.”

A little more of this hopeless conversation ensued, and then Mrs.“Don’t let me drive you away, Mr.Tracy,” she said, as
he too got upon his feet.“But if you will excuse me--I’ve had so much
worry lately--and these headaches come on every afternoon now.”

As Reuben walked beside her to open the door, he ventured to say: “It
is a very dear wish of mine, Mrs.Minster, to remove all this cause for
worry, and to get you back control over your property, and to rid you
of these scoundrels, root and branch.For your own sake and that of your
daughters, let me beg of you to take no step that will embarrass me in
the fight.There is nothing that you could do now to specially help me,
except to do nothing at all.”

“If you mean for me not to sue my daughters,” she said, as he opened the
door, “you may rest easy.Nothing would tempt me to do _that!_ The very
idea of such a thing is too dreadful.Good-day, sir.”

Reuben this time did not repress the groan, after he had closed the door
upon Mrs.He realized that he had made no more impression on
her mind than ordnance practice makes on a sandbank.He did not attempt
to conceal his dejection as he returned to where Kate sat, and resumed
his chair in front of her.The daughter’s smiling face, however,
partially reassured him, “That’s mamma all over,” she said.“Isn’t it
wonderful how those old race types reappear, even in our day?She is
as Dutch as any lady of Haarlem that Franz Hals ever painted.Her mind
works sidewise, like a crab.I’m _so_ glad you told her everything!”

“If I could only feel that it had had any result,” said Reuben.“Oh, but it will have!” the girl insisted confidently.“I’m sure she
liked you very much.”

“That reminds me--” the lawyer spoke musingly--“I think I was told
once that she didn’t like me; that she stipulated that I was not to be
consulted about her business by--by my then partner.Do you know?”

“I have an idea,” said Kate.Then she stopped, and a delicate shadowy
flush passed over her face.“But it was nothing,” she added, hastily,
after a long pause.She could not bring herself to mention that year-old
foolish gossip about the Lawton girl.Reuben did not press for an answer, but began telling her about the work
he and Fairchild had inaugurated that morning.“We are not going to wait
for the committee,” he said.“The place can be in some sort of
shape within a week, I hope, and then we are going to open it as a
reading-room first of all, where every man of the village who behaves
himself can be free to come.There will be tea and coffee at low prices;
and if the lockout continues, I’ve got plans for something else--a kind
of soup-kitchen.We sha’n’t attempt to put the thing on a business basis
at all until the men have got to work again.Then we will leave it to
them, as to how they will support it, and what shall be done with the
other rooms.By the way, I haven’t seen much lately of the Lawton girl’s
project.I’ve heard vaguely that a start had been made, and that it
seemed to work well.Are you pleased with it?”

Kate answered in a low voice: “I have never been there but once since we
met there last winter.I did what I promised, in the way of assistance,
but I did not go again.I too have heard vaguely that it was a success.”

Reuben looked such obvious inquiry that that young lady felt impelled to
explain: “The very next day after I went there last with the money and
the plan, I heard some very painful things about the girl--about her
present life, I mean--from a friend, or rather from one whom I took then
to be a friend; and what he said prejudiced me, I suppose--”

A swift intuition helped Reuben to say: “By a friend’ you mean Horace
Boyce!”

Kate nodded her head in assent.As for Reuben, he rose abruptly from his
seat, motioning to his companion to keep her chair.He thrust his hands
into his pockets, and began pacing up and down along the edge of the
sofa at her side, frowning at the carpet.“Miss Kate,” he said at last, in a voice full of strong feeling, “there
is no possibility of my telling you what an infernal blackguard that man
is.”

“Yes, he has behaved very badly,” she said.“I suppose I am to blame for
having listened to him at all.But he had seen me there at her place,
through the glass door, and he seemed so anxious to keep me from being
imposed upon, and possibly compromised, that--”

“My dear young lady,” broke in Reuben, “you have no earthly idea of the
cruelty and meanness of what he did by saying that to you.I can’t--or
yes, why shouldn’t I?The fact is that that poor girl--and when she was
at my school she was as honest and good and clever a child as I ever saw
in my life--owed her whole misery and wretchedness to Horace Boyce.I
never dreamed of it, either at the time or later; in fact, until the
very day I met you at the milliner’s shop.Somehow I mentioned that he
was my partner, and then she told me.And then, knowing that, I had
to sit still all summer and see him coming here every day, on intimate
terms with you and your sister and mother.” Reuben stopped himself with
the timely recollection that this was an unauthorized emotion, and
added hurriedly: “But I never could have imagined such baseness, to
deliberately slander her to you!”

Kate did not at once reply, and when she did speak it was to turn the
talk away from Horace Boyce.“I will go and see her to-morrow,” she
said.“I am very glad to hear you say that,” was Reuben’s comment.“It is like
you to say it,” he went on, with brightening eyes.“It is a benediction
to be the friend of a young woman like you, who has no impulses that are
not generous, and whose only notion of power is to help others.”

“I shall not like you if you begin to flatter,” she replied, with mock
austerity, and an answering light in her eyes.“I am really a very
perverse and wrong-headed girl, distinguished only for having never done
any good at all.And anybody who says otherwise is not a friend, but a
flatterer, and I am weary of false tongues.”

Miss Ethel came in while Reuben was still turning over in his mind the
unexpressed meanings of these words, and with her entrance the talk
became general once more.The lawyer described to the two sisters the legal steps he had taken,
and their respective significance, and then spoke of his intention to
make a criminal complaint as soon as some additional proof, now being
sought, should come to hand.“And Horace Boyce will go to prison, then?” she
asked, eagerly.“There is a strong case against him,” answered Reuben.The graveness of his tone affected the girl’s spirits, and led her to
say in an altered voice: “I don’t want to be unkind, and I daresay I
shall be silly enough to cry in private if the thing really happens; but
when I think of the trouble and wickedness he has been responsible for,
and of the far more terrible mischief he might have wrought in this
family if I--that is, if we had not come to you as we did, I simply
_hate_ him.”

“Don’t let us talk about him any more, puss,” said Kate, soberly, rising
as she spoke.CHAPTER XXX.--JESSICA’S GREAT DESPAIR.It was on the following day that a less important member of society
than Miss Minster resolved to also pay a visit to the milliner’s shop.Ben Lawton’s second wife--for she herself scarcely thought of “Mrs.Lawton” as a title appertaining to her condition of ill-requited
servitude--had become possessed of some new clothes.Their monetary
value was not large, but they were warm and respectable, with bugle
trimming on the cloak, and a feather rising out of real velvet on the
bonnet; and they were new all together at the same time, a fact which
impressed her mind by its novelty even more than did the inherent charm
of acquisition.To go out in this splendid apparel was an obvious duty.The notion of going shopping loomed in the background of
Mrs.Lawton’s thoughts for a while, but in a formless and indistinct
way, and then disappeared again.Her mind was not civilized enough to
assimilate the idea of loitering around among the stores when she had no
money with which to buy anything.Gradually the conception of a visit to her step-Jessica took shape in
her imagination.Perhaps the fact that she owed her new clothes to the bounty of this
girl helped forward this decision.There was also a certain curiosity to
see the child who was Ben’s grandson, and so indirectly related to her,
and for whose anomalous existence there was more than one precedent in
her own family, and who might turn out to resemble her own little lost
Alonzo.But the consideration which primarily dictated her choice was
that there was no other place to go to.Her reception by Jessica, when she finally found her way by Samantha’s
complicated directions to the shop, was satisfactorily cordial.She was
allowed to linger for a time in the show-room, and satiate bewilderment
over the rich plumes, and multi- velvets and ribbons there
displayed; then she was taken into the domestic part of the building,
where she was asked like a real visitor to take off her cloak and
bonnet, and sat down to enjoy the unheard-of luxury of seeing somebody
else getting a “meal of victuals” ready.The child was playing by
himself back of the stove with some blocks.He seemed to take no
interest in his new relation, and Mrs.Lawton saw that if Alonzo
had lived he would not have looked like this boy, who was blonde
and delicate, with serious eyes and flaxen curls, and a high, rather
protuberant forehead.The brevet grandmother heard with surprise from Lucinda that this
five-year-old child already knew most of his letters.She stole furtive
glances at him after this, from time to time, and as soon as Jessica had
gone out into the store and closed the door she asked:

“Don’t his head look to you like water on the brain?”

Lucinda shook her head emphatically: “He’s healthy enough,” she said.“And his name’s Horace, you say?”

“Yes, that’s what I said,” replied the girl.Lawton burned to ask what other name the lad bore, but the
peremptory tones of her daughter warned her off.Instead she remarked:
“And so he’s been livin’ in Tecumseh all this while?They seem to have
brung him up pretty good--teachin’ him his A B C’s and curlin’ his
hair.”

“He had a good home.Jess paid high, and the people took a liking to
him,” said Lucinda.“I s’pose they died or broke up housekeepin’,” tentatively suggested
Mrs.“No: Jess wanted him here, or thought she did.” Lucinda’s loyalty to her
sister prompted her to stop the explanation at this.But she herself
had been sorely puzzled and tried by the change which had come over
the little household since the night of the boy’s arrival, and the
temptation to put something of this into words was too strong to be
mastered.“I wish myself he hadn’t come at all,” she continued from the table
where she was at work.“Not but that he’s a good enough young-one, and
lots of company for us both, but Jess ain’t been herself at all since
she brought him here.It ain’t his fault--poor little chap--but she
fetched him from Tecumseh on account of something special; and then
that something didn’t seem to come off, and she’s as blue as a whetstone
about it, and that makes everything blue.And there we are!”

Lucinda finished in a sigh, and proceeded to rub grease on the inside of
her cake tins with a gloomy air.*****

In the outer shop, Jessica found herself standing surprised and silent
before the sudden apparition of a visitor whom she had least of all
expected--Miss Kate Minster.The bell which formerly jangled when the street door opened had been
taken off because it interfered with the child’s mid-day sleep, and
Jessica herself had been so deeply lost in a brown study where she sat
sewing behind the counter that she had not noted the entrance of the
young lady until she stood almost within touch.Then she rose hurriedly,
and stood confused and tongue-tied, her work in hand.She dropped this
impediment when Miss Minster offered to shake hands with her, but even
this friendly greeting did not serve to restore her self-command or
induce a smile.“I have a thousand apologies to make for leaving you alone all this
while,” said Kate.“But--we have been so troubled of late--and, selfish
like, I have forgotten everything else.Or no--I won’t say that--for I
have thought a great deal about you and your work.And now you must tell
me all about both.”

Miss Minster had seated herself as she spoke, and loosened the boa
about her throat, but Jessica remained standing.She idly noted that no
equipage and coachman were in waiting outside, and let the comment drift
to her tongue.“You walked, I see,” she said.“It isn’t pleasant to take out the horses now.The
streets are full of men out of work, and they blame us for it, and to
see us drive about seems to make them angry.I suppose it’s a natural
enough feeling; but the boys pelted our coachman with snowballs the
other day, while my sister and I were driving, and the men on the corner
all laughed and encouraged them.But if I walk nobody molests me.”

The young lady, as she said this with an air of modest courage, had
never looked so beautiful before in Jessica’s eyes, or appealed so
powerfully to her liking and admiration.But the milliner was conscious
of an invasion of other and rival feelings which kept her face smileless
and hardened the tone of her voice.“Yes, the men feel very bitterly,” she said.“I know that from the
girls.A good many of them--pretty nearly all, for that matter--have
stopped coming here, since the lockout, because _your_ money furnished
the Resting House.That shows how strong the feeling is.”

“You amaze me!”

There was no pretence in Miss Kate’s emotion.She looked at Jessica with
wide-open eyes, and the astonishment in the gaze visibly softened and
saddened into genuine pain.“Oh, I _am_ so sorry!” she said.“I never
thought of _that_.How can we get that cruel
notion out of their heads?I did so _truly_ want to help the girls.Surely there must be some way of making them realize this.The closing
of the works, that is a business matter with which I had nothing to do,
and which I didn’t approve; but this plan of yours, _that_ was really
a pet of mine.It is only by a stupid accident that I did not come here
often, and get to know the girls, and show them how interested I was in
everything.Tracy spoke of you yesterday, I resolved to come at
once, and tell you how ashamed I was.”

Jessica’s heart was deeply stirred by this speech, and filled with
yearnings of tenderness toward the beautiful and good patrician.But
some strange, undefined force in her mind held all this softness in
subjection.“The girls are gone,” she said, almost coldly.“They will not come
back--at least for a long time, until all this trouble is forgotten.”

“They hate me too much,” groaned Kate, in grieved self-abasement.“They don’t know _you!_ What they think of is that it is the Minster
money; that is what they hate.To take away from the men with a shovel,
and give back to the girls with a spoon--they won’t stand that!” The
latent class-feeling of a factory town flamed up in Jessica’s bosom,
intolerant and vengeful, as she listened to her own words.“I would
feel like that myself, if I were in their place,” she said, in curt
conclusion.The daughter of the millions sat for a little in pained irresolution.She was conscious of impulses toward anger at the coldness, almost the
rudeness, of this girl whom she had gone far out of and beneath her way
to assist.Her own class-feeling, too, subtly prompted her to dismiss
with contempt the thought of these thick-fingered, uncouth factory-girls
who were rejecting her well-meant bounty.But kindlier feelings strove
within her mind, too, and kept her for the moment undecided.She looked up at Jessica, as if in search for help, and her woman’s
heart suddenly told her that the changes in the girl’s face, vaguely
apparent to her before, were the badges of grief and unrest.All the
annoyance she had been nursing fled on the instant.Her eyes moistened,
and she laid her hand softly on the other’s arm.“_You_ at least mustn’t think harshly of me,” she said with a smile.“That would be _too_ sad.I would give a great deal if the furnaces
could be opened to-morrow--if they had never been shut.Not even the
girls whose people are out of work feel more deeply about the thing
than I do.But--after all, time must soon set that right.Is there nothing I can do for you?”

An answering moisture came into Jessica’s eyes as she met the other’s
look.She shook her head, and withdrew her wrist from the kindly
pressure of Kate’s hand.“I spoke of you at length with Mr.Tracy,” Kate went on, gently.“_Do_
believe that we are both anxious to do all we can for you, in whatever
form you like.You have never spoken about more money for the Resting
House.If it is, don’t hesitate for a
moment to let me know.And mayn’t I go and see the house, now that I am
here?You know I have never been inside it once since you took it.”

For a second or two Jessica hesitated.It cost her a great deal
to maintain the unfriendly attitude she had taken up, and she was
hopelessly at sea as to why she was paying this price for unalloyed
unhappiness.Yet still she persisted doggedly, and as it were in spite
of herself.“It’s a good deal run down just now,” she said.“Since the trouble came,
Lucinda and I haven’t kept it up.You’d like better to see it some time
when it was in order; that is, if I--if it isn’t given up altogether!”

The despairing intonation of these closing words was not lost upon Kate.“Why do you speak like that?” she said.Oh, I hope it isn’t as bad as that!”

“I’m thinking a good deal of going away.You and Miss Wilcox can put
somebody else here, and keep open the house.My
heart isn’t in it any more.”

The girl forced herself through these words with a mournful effort.The
hot tears came to her eyes before she had finished, and she turned away
abruptly, walking behind the counter to the front of the shop.“There is something you are not
telling me, my child,” she urged with tender earnestness._Let_ me help you!”

“There is nothing--nothing at all,” Jessica made answer.“Only I am not
happy here.And there are--other things--that
were a mistake, too.”

“Why not confide in me, dear?Why not let me help you?”

“How could _you_ help me?” The girl spoke with momentary impatience.“There are things that _money_ can’t help.”

The rich young lady drew herself up instinctively, and tightened the fur
about her neck.The words affected her almost like an affront.“I’m very sorry,” she said, with an obvious cooling of manner.“I did
not mean money alone.I had hoped you felt I was your friend.And I
still want to be, if occasion arises.I shall be very much grieved,
indeed, if you do not let me know, at any and all times, when I can be
of use to you.”

She held out her hand, evidently as an indication that she was going.Jessica saw the hand through a mist of smarting tears, and took it, not
daring to look up.She was filled with longings to kiss this hand, to
cry out for forgiveness, to cast herself upon the soft shelter of this
sweet friendship, so sweetly proffered.But there was some strange spell
which held her back, and, still through the aching film of tears, she
saw the gloved hand withdrawn.A soft “good-by” spread its pathos upon
the silence about her, and then Miss Minster was gone.Jessica stood for a time, looking blankly into the street.Then she
turned and walked with unconscious directness, as in a dream, through
the back rooms and across the yard to the Resting House.She had passed
her stepmother, her sister, and her child without bestowing a glance
upon them, and she wandered now through the silent building aimlessly,
without power to think of what she saw.Although the furniture was
still of the most primitive and unpretentious sort, there were many
little appliances for the comfort of the girls, in which she had had
much innocent delight.The bath-rooms on the upper floor, the willow
rocking-chairs in the sitting-room, the neat row of cups and saucers
in the glassfaced cupboard, the magazines and pattern books on the
table--all these it had given her pleasure to contemplate only a
fortnight ago.She noted that the fire in
the base-burner had gone out, though the reservoir still seemed full of
coal.She was conscious of a vague sense of fitness in its having gone
out.The fire that had burned within her heart was in ashes, too.She
put her apron to her eyes and wept vehemently, here in solitude.Lucinda came out, nearly an hour later, to find her sister sitting
disconsolate by the fireless stove, shivering with the cold, and staring
into vacancy.She put her broad arm with maternal kindness around Jessica’s waist, and
led her unresisting toward the door.“Never mind, sis,” she murmured,
with clumsy sympathy.“Come in and play with Horace.”

Jessica, shuddering again with the chill, buried her face on her
sister’s shoulder, and wept supinely.There was not an atom of courage
remaining in her heart.“You are low down and miserable,” pursued Lucinda, compassionately.“I’ll make you up some boneset tea.It’ll be lucky if you haven’t caught
your death a-cold out here so long.” She had taken a shawl, which hung
in the hallway, and wrapped it about her sister’s shoulders.“I half wish I had,” sobbed Jessica.“There’s no fight left in me any
more.”

“What’s the matter, anyway?”

“If I knew myself,” the girl groaned in answer, “perhaps I could do
something; but I don’t.I can’t think, I can’t eat or sleep or work.what is the matter with me?”




CHAPTER XXXI.--A STRANGE ENCOUNTER.A SOMBRE excitement reigned in Thessaly next day, when it became known
that the French-Cana-dian workmen whom the rolling-mill people were
importing would arrive in the village within the next few hours.They
were coming through from Massachusetts, and watchful eyes at Troy had
noted their temporary halt there and the time of the train they took
westward.The telegraph sped forward the warning, and fully a thousand
idle men in Thessaly gathered about the dépôt, both inside and on the
street without, to witness the unwelcome advent.Some indefinite rumors of the sensation reached the secluded milliner’s
shop on the back street, during the day.Ben Lawton drifted in to warm
himself during the late forenoon, and told of the stirring scenes that
were expected.He was quick to observe that Jessica was not looking
well, and adjured her to be careful about the heavy cold which she said
she had taken.The claims upon him of the excitement outside were too
strong to be resisted, but he promised to look in during the afternoon
and tell them the news.The daylight of the November afternoon was beginning imperceptibly
to wane before any further tidings of the one topic of great public
interest reached the sisters.One of the better class of factory-girls
came in to gossip with Lucinda, and she brought with her a veritable
budget of information.The French Canadians had arrived, and with them
came some Pinkerton detectives, or whatever they were called, who were
said to be armed to the teeth.The crowd had fiercely hooted these
newcomers and their guards, and there had been a good deal of angry
hustling.For awhile it looked as if a fight must ensue; but, somehow,
it did not come off.The Canadians, in a body, had gone with their
escort to the row of new cottages which the company had hired for them,
followed by a diminishing throng of hostile men and boys.There were
numerous personal incidents to relate, and the two sisters listened with
deep interest to the whole recital.When it was finished the girl still sat about, evidently with something
on her mind.At last, with a blunt “Can I speak to you for a moment?”
 she led Jessica out into the shop.There, in a whisper, with repeated
affirmations and much detail, she imparted the confidential portion of
her intelligence.The effect of this information upon Jessica was marked and immediate.As soon as the girl had gone she hastened to the living-room, and began
hurriedly putting on her boots.The effort of stooping to button them
made her feverish head ache, and she was forced to call the amazed
Lucinda to her assistance.“You’re crazy to think of going out such a day as this,” protested the
girl, “and you with such a cold, too.”

“It’s got to be done,” said Jessica, her eyes burning with eagerness,
and her cheeks flushed.“If it killed me, it would have to be done.But
I’ll bundle up warm.I’ll be all right.” Refusing
to listen to further dissuasion she hastily put on her hat and cloak,
and then with nervous rapidity wrote a note, sealed it up tightly with
an envelope, and marked on it, with great plainness, the address: “Miss
Kate Minster.”

“Give this to father when he comes,” she cried, “and tell him--”

Ben Lawton’s appearance at the door interrupted the directions.He was
too excited about the events of the day to be surprised at seeing the
daughter he had left an invalid now dressed for the street; but she
curtly stopped the narrative which he began.“We’ve heard all about it,” she said.“I want you to come with me now.”

Lucinda watched the dominant sister drag on and button her gloves with
apprehension and solicitude written all over her honest face.“Now, do
be careful,” she repeated more than once.As Jessica said “I’m ready now,” and turned to join her father, the
little boy came into the shop through the open door of the living-room.A swift instinct prompted the mother to go to him and stoop to kiss him
on the forehead.The child smiled at her; and when she was out in
the street, walking so hurriedly that her father found the gait
unprecedented in his languid experience, she still dwelt curiously in
her mind upon the sweetness of that infantile smile.And this, by some strange process, suddenly brought clearness and order
to her thoughts.Under the stress of this nervous tension, perhaps
because of the illness which she felt in every bone, yet which seemed to
clarify her senses, her mind was all at once working without confusion.She saw now that what had depressed her, overthrown her self-control,
impelled her to reject the kindness of Miss Minster, had been the
humanization, so to speak, of her ideal, Reuben Tracy.The bare thought
of his marrying and giving in marriage--of his being in love with the
rich girl--this it was that had so strangely disturbed her.Looking at
it now, it was the most foolish thing in the world.What on earth had
she to do with Reuben Tracy?There could never conceivably have entered
her head even the most vagrant and transient notion that he--no, she
would not put _that_ thought into form, even in her own mind.And were
there two young people in all the world who had more claim to her good
wishes than Reuben and Kate?She answered this heartily in the negative,
and said to herself that she truly was glad that they loved each other.She bit her lips, and insisted on repeating this to
her own thoughts.But why, then, had the discovery of this so unnerved her?It must have been because the idea of their
happiness made the isolation of her own life so miserably clear; because
she felt that they had forgotten her and her work in their new-found
concern for each other.She was all over
that weak folly now.She had it in her power to help them, and dim,
half-formed wishes that she might give life itself to their service
flitted across her mind.She had spoken never a word to her father all this while, and had seemed
to take no note either of direction or of what and whom she passed; but
she stopped now in front of the doorway in Main Street which bore the
law-sign of Reuben Tracy.“Wait for me here,” she said to Ben, and
disappeared up the staircase.Jessica made her way with some difficulty up the second flight.Her head
burned with the exertion, and there was a novel numbness in her limbs;
but she gave this only a passing thought.On the panel was tacked a white
half-sheet of paper.It was not easy to decipher the inscription in the
failing light, but she finally made it out to be:

“_Called away until noon to-morrow (Friday)_.”

The girl leaned against the door-sill for support.In the first moment
or two it seemed to her that she was going to swoon.Then resolution
came back to her, and with it a new store of strength, and she went down
the stairs again slowly and in terrible doubt as to what should now be
done.The memory suddenly came to her of the one other time she had been in
this stairway, when she had stood in the darkness with her little boy,
gathered up against the wall to allow the two Minster ladies to pass.Upon the heels of this chased the recollection--with such lack of
sequence do our thoughts follow one another--of the singularly sweet
smile her little boy had bestowed upon her, half an hour since, when she
kissed him.The smile had lingered in her mind as a beautiful picture.Walking down
the stairs now, in the deepening shadows, the revelation dawned upon her
all at once--it was his father’s smile!Yes, yes--hurriedly the fancy
reared itself in her thoughts--thus the lover of her young girlhood had
looked upon her.The delicate, clever face; the prettily arched lips;
the soft, light curls upon the forehead; the tenderly beaming blue
eyes--all were the same.very often--this resemblance had forced itself upon her
consciousness before.But now, lighted up by that chance babyish smile,
it came to her in the guise of a novelty, and with a certain fascination
in it.Her head seemed to have ceased to ache, now that this almost
pleasant thought had entered it.It was passing strange, she felt, that
any sense of comfort should exist for her in memories which had fed
her soul upon bitterness for so long a time.Yet it was already on the
instant apparent to her that when she should next have time to think,
that old episode would assume less hateful aspects than it had always
presented before.At the street door she found her father leaning against a shutter and
discussing the events of the day with the village lamplighter, who
carried a ladder on his shoulder, and reported great popular agitation
to exist.Jessica beckoned Ben summarily aside, and put into his hands the letter
she had written at the shop.“I want you to take this at once to Miss
Minster, at her house,” she said, hurriedly.“See to it that she gets it
herself.Don’t say a word to any living
soul.I’ve said you can be depended
upon.If you show yourself a man, it may make your fortune.Now, hurry;
and I do hope you will do me credit!”

Under the spur of this surprising exhortation, Ben walked away with
unexampled rapidity, until he had overtaken the lamplighter, from whom
he borrowed some chewing tobacco.The girl, left to herself, began walking irresolutely down Main Street.The flaring lights in the store windows seemed to add to the confusion
of her mind.It had appeared to be important to send her father away at
once, but now she began to regret that she had not kept him to help her
in her search.For Reuben Tracy must be found at all hazards.How to go to work to trace him she did not know.She had no notion
whatever as to who his intimate friends were.The best device she could
think of would be to ask about him at the various law-offices; for she
had heard that however much lawyers might pretend to fight one another
in court, they were all on very good terms outside.Some little distance down the street she came upon the door of another
stairway which bore a number of lawyers’ signs.The windows all up the
front of this building were lighted, and without further examination she
ascended the first flight of stairs.The landing was almost completely
dark, but an obscured gleam came from the dusty transoms over three or
four doors close about her.She knocked on one of these at random, and
in response to an inarticulate vocal sound from within, opened the door
and entered.It was a square, medium-sized room in which she found herself, with
a long, paper-littered table in the centre, and tall columns of light
leather-covered books rising along the walls.At the opposite end of the
chamber a man sat at a desk, his back turned to her, his elbows on the
desk, and his head in his hands.The shaded light in front of him made a
mellow golden fringe around the outline of his hair.A sudden bewildering tumult burst forth in the girl’s breast as she
looked at this figure.Then, as suddenly, the recurring mental echoes of
the voice which had bidden her enter rose above this tumult and stilled
it.A gentle and comforting warmth stole through her veins.This was
Horace Boyce who sat there before her--and she did not hate him!During that instant in which she stood by the door, a whole flood of
self-illumination flashed its rays into every recess of her mind.This,
then, was the strange, formless opposing impulse which had warred with
the other in her heart for this last miserable fortnight, and dragged
her nearly to distraction.The bringing home of her boy had revived for her, by occult and subtle
processes, the old romance in which his father had been framed, as might
a hero be by sunlit clouds.She hugged the thought to her heart, and
stood looking at’ him motionless and mute.What is wanted?” he called out, querulously, without
changing his posture.It was as if a magic voice drew her
forward in a dream--herself all rapt and dumb.Irritably impressed by the continued silence, Horace lifted his head,
and swung abruptly around in his chair.His own shadow obscured the
features of his visitor.He saw only that it was a lady, and rose
hesitatingly to his feet.“Excuse me,” he mumbled, “I was busy with my thoughts, and did not know
who it was.”

“Do you know now?” Jessica heard herself ask, as in a trance.The balmy
warmth in her own heart told her that she was smiling.Horace took a step or two obliquely forward, so that the light fell on
her face.He peered with a confounded gaze at her for a moment, then let
his arms fall limp at his sides.“In the name of the dev--” he began, confusedly, and then bit the word
short, and stared at her again.“Is it really you?” he asked at last,
reassured in part by her smile.“Are you sorry to see me?” she asked in turn.Her mind could frame
nothing but these soft little meaningless queries.The young man seemed in doubt how best to answer this question.He
turned around and looked abstractedly at his desk; then with a slight
detour he walked past her, opened the door, and glanced up and down the
dark stairway.When he had closed the door once more, he turned the key
in the lock, and then, after momentary reflection, concluded to unlock
it again.“Why, no; why should I be?” he said in a more natural voice, as he
returned and stood beside her.Evidently her amiability was a more
difficult surprise for him to master than her original advent, and he
studied her face with increasing directness of gaze to make sure of it.“Come and sit down here,” he said, after a few moments of this puzzled
inspection, and resumed his own chair.“I want a good look at you,” he
explained, as he lifted the shade from the lamp.Jessica felt that she was blushing under this new radiance, and it
required an effort to return his glance.But, when she did so, the
changes in his face and expression which it revealed drove everything
else from her mind.She rose from her chair upon a sudden impulse,
and bent over him at a diffident distance.As she did so, she had the
feeling that this bitterness in which she had encased herself for years
had dropped from her on the instant like a discarded garment.“Why, Horace, your hair is quite gray!” she said, as if the fact
contained the sublimation of pathos.“There’s been trouble enough to turn it white twenty times over!You
don’t know what I’ve been through, my girl,” he said, sadly.The
novel sensation of being sympathized with, welcome as it was, greatly
accentuated his sense of deserving compassion.“I am very sorry,” she said, softly.She had seated herself again, and
was gradually recovering her self-possession.The whole situation was
so remarkable, not to say startling, that she found herself regarding it
from the outside, as if she were not a component part of it.Her pulses
were no longer strongly stirred by its personal phases.Most clear of
all things in her mind was that she was now perfectly independent of
this or any other man.She was her own master, and need ask favors from
nobody.Therefore, if it pleased her to call bygones bygones and make a
friend of Horace--or even to put a bandage across her eyes and cull from
those bygones only the rose leaves and violet blossoms, and make for her
weary soul a bed of these--what or who was to prevent her?Some inexplicable, unforeseen revulsion of feeling had made him pleasant
in her sight again.There was no doubt about it--she had genuine
satisfaction in sitting here opposite him and looking at him.Had she
so many pleasures, then, that she should throw this unlooked-for boon
deliberately away?Moreover--and here the new voices called most loudly in her heart--he
was worn and unhappy.The iron had palpably entered his soul too.He
looked years older than he had any chronological right to look.There
were heavy lines of anxiety on his face, and his blonde hair was
powdered thick with silver.“Yes, I am truly sorry,” she said again.“Is it business that has gone
wrong with you?”

“Business--family--health--sleep--everything!” he groaned, bitterly.“It
is literally a hell that I have been living in this last--these last few
months!”

“I had no idea of that,” she said, simply.Of course it would be
ridiculous to ask if there was anything she could do, but she had
comfort from the thought that he must realize what was in her mind.“So help me God, Jess!” he burst out vehemently, under the incentive of
her sympathy, “I’m coming to believe that every man is a scoundrel, and
every woman a fool!”

“There was a long time when _I_ thought that,” she said with a sigh.He looked quickly at her from under his brows, and then as swiftly
turned his glance away.“Yes, I know,” he answered uneasily, tapping
with his fingers on the desk.“But we won’t talk of that,” she urged, with a little tremor of anxiety
in her tone.“We needn’t talk of that at all.It was merely by accident
that I came here, Horace.I wanted to ask a question, and nothing was
further from my head than finding you here.”

“Let’s see--Mart Jocelyn had this place up to a couple of months ago.I didn’t know you knew him.”

“No, you foolish boy!” she said, with a smile which had a ground tone
of sadness.It was simply any lawyer I was
looking for.But what I wanted to say was that I am not angry with you
any more.I’ve learned a host of bitter lessons since we were--young
together, and I’m too much alone in the world to want to keep you an
enemy.You don’t seem so very happy yourself, Horace.Why shouldn’t
we two be friends again?I’m not talking of anything else,
Horace--understand me.But it appeals to me very strongly, this idea of
our being friends again.”

Horace looked meditatively at her, with softening eyes.“You’re the best
of the lot, dear old Jess,” he said at last, smiling candidly.“Truly
I’m glad you came--gladder than I can tell you.I was in the very slough
of despond when you entered; and now--well, at least I’m going to play
that I am out of it.”

Jessica rose with a beaming countenance, and laid her hand frankly on
his shoulder.“I’m glad I came, too,” she said.“And very soon I want to
see you again--when you are quite free--and have a long, quiet talk.”

“All right, my girl,” he answered, rising as well.The prospect seemed
entirely attractive to him.He took her hand in his, and said again:
“All right.And must you go now?”

“Oh, mercy, yes!” she exclaimed, with sudden recollection.“I had no
business to stay so long!Perhaps you can tell me--or no--” She vaguely
put together in her mind the facts that Tracy and Horace had been
partners, and seemed to be so no longer.“No, you wouldn’t know.”

“Have I so poor a legal reputation as all that?” he said, lightly
smiling.One’s friends, at least, ought to dissemble their
bad opinions.”

“No, it wasn’t about law,” she explained, stum-blingly.“It’s of no
importance.Good-by for the time.”

He would have drawn her to him and kissed her at this, but she gently
prevented the caress, and released herself from his hands.“Not that,” she said, with a smile in which still some sadness lingered.And--good-by, Horace, for the
time.”

He went with her to the door, lighting the hall gas that she might
see her way down the stairs.When she had disappeared, he walked for
a little up and down the room, whistling softly to himself.It was
undeniable that the world seemed vastly brighter to him than it had only
a half-hour before.Mere contact with somebody who liked him for himself
was a refreshing novelty.“A damned decent sort of girl--considering everything!” he mused aloud,
as he locked up his desk for the day.CHAPTER XXXII.--THE ALARM AT THE FARMHOUSE.To come upon the street again was like the confused awakening from a
dream.With the first few steps Jessica found herself shivering in an
extremity of cold, yet still uncomfortably warm.A sudden passing spasm
of giddiness, too, made her head swim so that for the instant she feared
to fall.Then, with an added sense of weakness, she went on, wearily and
desponding.The recollection of this novel and curious happiness upon which she
had stumbled only a few moments before took on now the character of
self-reproach.The burning headache had returned, and with it came a
pained consciousness that it had been little less than criminal in
her to weakly dally in Horace’s office when such urgent responsibility
rested upon her outside.If the burden of this responsibility appeared
too great for her to bear, now that her strength seemed to be so
strangely leaving her, there was all the more reason for her to set her
teeth together, and press forward, even if she staggered as she went.The search had been made cruelly
hopeless by that shameful delay; and she blamed herself with fierceness
for it, as she racked her brain for some new plan, wondering whether she
ought to have asked Horace or gone into some of the other offices.There were groups of men standing here and there on the comers--a little
away from the full light of the street-lamps, as if unwilling to court
observation.These knots of workmen had a sinister significance to her
feverish mind.She had the clew to the terrible mischief which some of
them intended--which no doubt even now they were canvassing in furtive
whispers--and only Tracy could stop it, and she was powerless to find
him!There came slouching along the sidewalk, as she grappled with this
anguish of irresolution, a slight and shabby figure which somehow
arrested her attention.It was a familiar enough figure--that of old
“Cal” Gedney; and there was nothing unusual or worthy of comment in
the fact that he was walking unsteadily by himself, with his gaze fixed
intently on the sidewalk.He had passed again out of the range of her
cursory glance before she suddenly remembered that he was a lawyer, and
even some kind of a judge.She turned swiftly and almost ran after him, clutching his sleeve as she
came up to him, and breathing so hard with weakness and excitement that
for the moment she could not speak.The ’squire looked up, and angrily shook his arm out of her grasp.“Leave me alone, you hussy,” he snarled, “or I’ll lock you up!”

His misconstruction of her purpose cleared her mind.“Don’t be foolish,”
 she said, hurriedly.“It’s a question of perhaps life and death!Do you
know where Reuben Tracy is?Or can you tell me where I can find out?”

“He don’t want to be bothered with _you_, wherever he is,” was the surly
response.“Be off with you!”

“I told you it was a matter of life and death,” she insisted, earnestly.“He’ll never forgive you--you’ll never forgive yourself--if you know and
won’t tell me.”

The sincerity of the girl’s tone impressed the old man.It was not easy
for him to stand erect and unaided without swaying, but his mind was
evidently clear enough.“What do you want with him?” he asked, in a less unfriendly voice.Then
he added, in a reflective undertone: “Cur’ous’t I sh’d want see Tracy,
too.”

“Then you do know where he is?”

“He’s drove out to ’s mother’s farm.Seems word come old woman’s sick.You’re one of that Lawton tribe, aren’t you?”

“If I get a cutter, will you drive out there with me?” She asked the
question with swift directness.She added in explanation, as he stared
vacantly at her: “I ask that because you said you wanted to see him,
that’s all.I shall go alone if you won’t come.He’s _got_ to be back
here this evening, or God only knows what’ll happen!I mean what I say!”

“Do you know the road?” the ’squire asked, catching something of her
own eager spirit.I was bom half a mile from where his mother lives.”

“But you won’t tell me what your business is?”

“I’ll tell you this much,” she whispered, hastily.“There is going to
be a mob at the Minster house to-night.A girl who knows one of the men
told--”

The old ’squire cut short the revelation by grasping her arm with
fierce energy.“Come on--come on!” he said, hoarsely.“Don’t waste a minute.We’ll gallop the horses both ways.” He muttered to himself with
excitement as he dragged her along.Jessica waited outside the livery stable for what seemed an interminable
period, while old “Cal” was getting the horses--walking up and down the
path in a state of mental torment which precluded all sense of bodily
suffering.When she conjured up before her frightened mind the
terrible consequences which delay might entail, every minute became an
intolerable hour of torture.There was even the evil chance that the old
man had been refused the horses because he had been drinking.Finally, however, there came the welcome sound of mailed hoofs on the
plank roadway inside, and the reverberating jingle of bells; and then
the ’squire, with a spacious double-seated sleigh containing plenty of
robes, drew up in front of a cutting in the snow.She took the front seat without hesitation, and gathered the lines into
her own hands.“Let me drive,” she said, clucking the horses into a
rapid trot.“I _should_ be home in bed.I’m too ill to sit up, unless
I’m doing something that keeps me from giving up.”

*****

Reuben Tracy felt the evening in the sitting-room of the old farmhouse
to be the most trying ordeal of his adult life.Ordinarily he rather enjoyed than otherwise the company of his brother
Ezra--a large, powerfully built, heavily bearded man, who sat now beside
him in a rocking-chair in front of the wood stove, his stockinged feet
on the hearth, and a last week’s agricultural paper on his knee.Ezra
was a worthy and hard-working citizen, with an original way of looking
at things, and considerable powers of expression.As a rule, the
lawyer liked to talk with him, and felt that he profited in ideas and
suggestions from the talk.But to-night he found his brother insufferably dull, and the task of
keeping down the “fidgets” one of incredible difficulty.His mother--on
whose account he had been summoned--was so much better that Ezra’s wife
had felt warranted in herself going off to bed, to get some much-needed
rest.Ezra had argued for a while, rather perversely, about the tariff
duty on wool, and now was nodding in his chair, although the dim-faced
old wooden clock showed it to be barely eight o’clock.The kerosene lamp
on the table gave forth only a feeble, reddened light through its smoky
chimney, but diffused a most powerful odor upon the stuffy air of the
over-heated room.A ragged and strong-smelling old farm dog groaned
offensively from time to time in his sleep behind the stove.Even the
draught which roared through the lower apertures in front of the stove
and up the pipe toward the chimney was irritating by the very futility
of its vehemence, for the place was too hot already.Reuben mused in silence upon the chances which had led him so far
away from this drowsy, unfruitful life, and smiled as he found himself
wondering if it would be in the least possible for him to return to it.The bright boys, the restless boys, the boys
of energy, of ambition, of yearning for culture or conquest or the mere
sensation of living where it was really life--all went away, leaving
none but the Ezras behind.Some succeeded; some failed; but none of them
ever came back.And the Ezras who remained on the farms--they seemed to
shut and bolt the doors of their minds against all idea of making their
own lot less sterile and barren and uninviting.The mere mental necessity for a great contrast brought up suddenly
in Reuben’s thoughts a picture of the drawing-room in the home of the
Minsters.It seemed as if the whole vast swing of the mind’s pendulum
separated that luxurious abode of cultured wealth from this dingy and
barren farmhouse room.And he, who had been born and reared in this
latter, now found himself at a loss how to spend so much as a single
evening in its environment, so completely had familiarity with the other
remoulded and changed his habits, his point of view, his very character.Curious slaves of habit--creatures of their surroundings--men were!A loud, peremptory knocking at the door aroused Reuben abruptly from his
revery, and Ezra, too, opened his eyes with a start, and sitting upright
rubbed them confusedly.“Now I think of it, I heard a sleigh stop,” said Reuben, rising.“It
can’t be the doctor this time of night, can it?”

“It ’ud be jest like him,” commented Ezra, captiously.“He’s a great
hand to keep dropping in, sort of casual-like, when there’s sickness in
the house.It all goes down in his bill.”

The farmer brother had also risen, and now, lamp in hand, walked
heavily in his stocking feet to the door, and opened it half way.Some
indistinct words passed, and then, shading the flickering flame with his
huge hairy hand, Ezra turned his head.“Somebody to see you, Rube,” he said.On second thought he added to the
visitor in a tone of formal politeness: “Won’t you step in, ma’am?”

Jessica Lawton almost pushed her host aside in her impulsive response to
his invitation.But when she had crossed the threshold the sudden change
into a heated atmosphere seemed to go to her brain like chloroform.She
stood silent, staring at Reuben, with parted lips and hands nervously
twitching.Even as he, in his complete surprise, recognized his visitor,
she trembled violently from head to foot, made a forward step, tottered,
and fell inertly into Ezra’s big, protecting arm.“I guessed she was going to do it,” said the farmer, not dissembling his
pride at the alert way in which the strange woman had been caught, and
holding up the lamp with his other hand in triumph.“Hannah keeled over
in that same identical way when Suky run her finger through the cogs of
the wringing-machine, and I ketched her, too!”

Reuben had hurriedly come to his brother’s assistance.The two men
placed the fainting girl in the rocking-chair, and the lawyer began
with anxious fumbling to loosen the neck of her cloak and draw off her
gloves.Her fingers were like ice, and her brow, though it felt now
almost equally cold, was covered with perspiration.Reuben rubbed her
hands between his broad palms in a crudely informed belief that it was
the right thing to do, while Ezra rummaged in the adjoining pantry for
the household bottle of brandy.Jessica came out of her swoon with the first touch of the pungent spirit
upon her whitened lips.She looked with weak blankness at the unfamiliar
scene about her, until her gaze fell upon the face of the lawyer.Then
she smiled faintly and closed her eyes again.“She is an old friend of mine,” whispered Reuben to his brother, as he
pressed the brandy once more upon her.“She’ll come to in a minute.It
must be something serious that brought her out here.”

The girl languidly opened her eyes.“‘Cal’ Ged-ney’s asleep in the
sleigh,” she murmured.“You’d better bring him in.He’ll tell you.”

It was with an obvious effort that she said this much; and now, while
Ezra hastily pulled on his boots, her eyes closed again, and her
head sank with utter weariness sideways upon the high back of the
old-fashioned chair.Reuben stood looking at her in pained anxiety--once or twice holding
the lamp close to her pale face, in dread of he knew not what--until
his brother returned.Ezra had brought the horses up into the yard, and
remained outside now to blanket them, while the old ’squire, benumbed
and drowsy, found his way into the house.It was evident enough to the
young lawyer’s first glance that Gedney had been drinking heavily.“Well, what does this all mean?” he demanded, with vexed asperity.“You’ve got to get on your things and race back with us, helly-to-hoot!”
 said the ’squire.“Quick--there ain’t a minute to lose!” The old man
almost gasped in his eagerness.“In Heaven’s name, what’s up?Have you been to Cadmus?”

“Yes, and got my pocket full of affidavits.We can send all three of
them to prison fast enough.But that’ll do to-morrow; for to-night
there’s a mob up at the Minster place._Look there!_”

The old man had gone to the window and swept the stiff curtain aside.He
held it now with a trembling hand, so that Reuben could look out.The whole southern sky overhanging Thessaly was crimson with the
reflection of a fire.it’s the rolling mill,” ejaculated Reuben, breathlessly.“Quite as likely it’s the Minster house; it’s the same direction, only
farther off, and fires are deceptive,” said Gedney, his excitement
rising under the stimulus of the spectacle.Reuben had kicked off his slippers, and was now dragging on his shoes.“Tell me about it,” he said, working furiously at the laces.’Squire Gedney helped himself generously to the brandy on the table as
he unfolded, in somewhat incoherent fashion, his narrative.The Lawton
girl had somehow found out that a hostile demonstration against the
Minsters was intended for the evening, and had started out to find
Tracy.By accident she had met him (Gedney), and they had come off in
the sleigh together.She had insisted upon driving, and as his long
journey from Cadmus had greatly fatigued him, he had got over into the
back seat and gone to sleep under the buffalo robes.He knew nothing
more until Ezra had roused him from his slumber in the sled, now at a
standstill on the road outside, and he had awakened to discover Jessica
gone, the horses wet and shivering in a cloud of steam, and the sky
behind them all ablaze.Looks as if the whole town was burning,” said Ezra,
coming in as this recital was concluded.“Them horses would a-got their
death out there in another ten minutes.Guess I’d better put ’em in
the barn, eh?”

“No, no!I’ve got to drive them back faster than
they came,” said Reuben, who had on his overcoat and hat.“Hurry, and
get me some thick gloves to drive in.We
won’t wake mother up.I’ll get you to run in to-morrow, if you will, and
let me know how she is.Tell her I _had_ to go.”

When Ezra had found the gloves and brought them, the two men for the
first time bent an instinctive joint glance at the recumbent figure of
the girl in the rocking-chair.“I’ll get Hannah up,” said the farmer, “and she can have your room.I
guess she’s too sick to try to go back with you.If she’s well enough,
I’ll bring her in in the morning.I was going to take in some apples,
anyway.”

To their surprise Jessica opened her eyes and even lifted her head at
these words.“No,” she said; “I feel better now--much better.I really must.” She rose to her feet as she spoke, and, though
she was conscious of great dizziness and languor, succeeded by her smile
in imposing upon her unskilled companions.Perhaps if Hannah had been
“got up” she would have seen through the weak pretence of strength, and
insisted on having matters ordered otherwise.But the men offered no
dissent.Jessica was persuaded to drink another glass of brandy, and
’Squire Gedney took one without being specially urged; and then Reuben
impatiently led the way out to the sleigh, which Ezra had turned around.“No; I’d rather be in front with you,” the girl said, when Reuben had
spread the robes for her to sit in the back seat.“Let the Judge sit
there; he wants to sleep.I’m not tired now, and I want to keep awake.”

Thus it was arranged, and Reuben, with a strong hand on the tight reins,
started the horses on their homeward rush toward the flaming horizon.CHAPTER XXXIII.--PACING TOWARD THE REDDENED SKY.For some time there was no conversation in the sleigh.The horses sped
evenly forward, with their heads well in the air, as if they too were
excited by the unnatural glare in the sky ahead.Before long there was
added to the hurried regular beating of their hoofs upon the hard-packed
track another sound--the snoring of the ’squire on the seat behind.There was a sense of melting in the air.Save where the intense glow
of the conflagration lit up the sky with a fan-like spread of ruddy
luminance--fierce orange at the central base, and then through an
expanse of vermilion, rose, and cherry to deepening crimsons and dull
reddish purples--the heavens hung black with snow-laden clouds.A
pleasant, moist night-breeze came softly across the valley, bearing ever
and again a solitary flake of snow.The effect of this mild wind was so
grateful to Jessica’s face, now once more burning with an inner heat,
that she gave no thought to a curious difficulty in breathing which was
growing upon her.“The scoundrels shall pay dear for this,” Reuben said to her, between
set teeth, when there came a place in the road where the horses must be
allowed to walk up hill.“I’m sure I hope so,” she said, quite in his spirit.The husky note in her voice caught his attention.“Are you sure you
are bundled up warm enough?” he asked with solicitude, pulling the robe
higher about her.I caught a heavy cold yesterday,” she
answered.“But it will be nothing, if only we can get there in time.”

It struck her as strange when Reuben presently replied, putting the whip
once more to the horses: “God only knows what can be done when I do
get there!” It had seemed to her a matter of course that Tracy would be
equal to any emergency--even an armed riot.There was something almost
disheartening in this confession of self-doubt.“But at any rate they shall pay for it to-morrow,” he broke out,
angrily, a moment later.“Down to the last pennyweight we will have our
pound of flesh!My girl,” he added, turning to look into her face, and
speaking with deep earnestness, “I never knew what it was before to feel
wholly merciless--absolutely without bowels of compassion.But I will
not abate so much as the fraction of a hair with these villains.I swear
that!”

By an odd contradiction, his words raised a vague spirit of compunction
within her.“They feel very bitterly,” she ventured to suggest.“It is
terrible to be turned out of work in the winter, and with families
dependent on that work for bare existence.And then the bringing in of
these strange workmen.I suppose that is what--”

Reuben interrupted her with an abrupt laugh.“I’m not thinking of them,”
 he said.“Poor foolish fellows, I don’t wish them any harm.I only
pray God they haven’t done too much harm to themselves.No: it’s the
swindling scoundrels who are responsible for the mischief--_they_ are
the ones I’ll put the clamps onto to-morrow.”

The words conveyed no meaning to her, and she kept silent until he spoke
further: “I don’t know whether he told you, but Gedney has brought me
to-night the last links needed for a chain of proof which must send all
three of these ruffians to State prison.I haven’t had time to
examine the papers yet, but he says he’s got them in his pocket
there--affidavits from the original inventor of certain machinery, about
its original sale, and from others who were a party to it--which makes
the whole fraud absolutely clear.I’ll go over them to-night, when we’ve
seen this thing through”--pointing vaguely with his whip toward the
reddened sky--“and if tomorrow I don’t lay all three of them by the
heels, you can have my head for a foot-ball!”

“I don’t understand these things very well,” said Jessica.“Who is it
you mean?” It was growing still harder for her to breathe, and sharp
pain came in her breast now with almost every respiration.Her head
ached, too, so violently that she cared very little indeed who it was
that should go to prison tomorrow.“There are three of them in the scheme,” said the lawyer; “as
cold-blooded and deliberate a piece of robbery as ever was planned.First, there’s a New York man named Wendover--they call him a Judge--a
smart, subtle, slippery scoundrel if ever there was one.Then there’s
Schuyler Tenney--perhaps you know who he is--he’s a big hardware
merchant here; and with him in the swindle was--Good heavens!Why, I
never thought of it before!”

Reuben had stopped short in his surprise.He began whipping the horses
now with a seeming air of exultation, and stole a momentary smile-lit
glance toward his companion.“It’s just occurred to me,” he said.“Curious--I hadn’t given it a
thought.Why, my girl, it’s like a special providence.You, too, will
have your full revenge--such revenge as you never dreamt of.The third
man is Horace Boyce!”

A great wave of cold stupor engulfed the girl’s reason as she took in
these words, and her head swam and roared as if in truth she had been
plunged headlong into unknown depths of icy water.When she came to the surface of consciousness again, the horses were
still rhythmically racing along the hill-side road overlooking the
village.The firelight in the sky had faded down now to a dull pinkish
effect like the northern lights.Reuben was chewing an unlighted cigar,
and the ’squire was steadily snoring behind them.“You will send them all to prison--surely?” she was able to ask.“As surely as God made little apples!” was the sententious response.The girl was cowering under the buffalo-robe in an anguish of mind so
terribly intense that her physical pains were all forgotten.Only her
throbbing head seemed full of thick blood, and there was such an
awful need that she should think clearly!She bit her lips in tortured
silence, striving through a myriad of wandering, crowding ideas to lay
hold upon something which should be of help.They had begun to descend the hill--a steep, uneven road full of drifts,
beyond which stretched a level mile of highway leading into the village
itself--when suddenly a bold thought came to her, which on the instant
had shot up, powerful and commanding, into a very tower of resolution.She laid her hand on Reuben’s arm.“If you don’t mind, I’ll change into the back seat,” she said, in a
voice which all her efforts could not keep from shaking.“I’m feeling
very ill.It’ll be easier for me there.”

Reuben at once drew up the horses, and the girl, summoning all her
strength, managed without his help to get around the side of the sleigh,
and under the robe, into the rear seat.The ’squire was sunk in such a
profound sleep that she had to push him bodily over into his own half of
the space, and the discovery that this did not waken him filled her
with so great a delight that all her strength and self-control seemed
miraculously to have returned to her.She had need of them both for the task which she had imposed upon
herself, and which now, with infinite caution and trepidation, she set
herself about.This was nothing less than to secure the papers which
the old ’squire had brought from Cadmus, and which, from something she
remembered his having said, must be in the inner pocket of one of his
coats.Slowly and deftly she opened button after button of his overcoat,
and gently pushed aside the cloth until her hand might have free
passage to and from the pocket, where, after careful soundings, she had
discovered a bundle of thick papers to be resting.Then whole minutes
seemed to pass before, having taken off her glove, she was able to draw
this packet out.Once during this operation Reuben half turned to speak
to her, and her fright was very great.But she had had the presence of
mind to draw the robe high about her, and answer collectedly, and he had
palpably suspected nothing.As for Gedney, he never once stirred in his
drunken sleep.The larceny was complete, and Jessica had been able to wrap the old man
up again, to button the parcel of papers under her own cloak, and to
draw on and fasten her glove once more, before the panting horses had
gained the outskirts of the village.She herself was breathing almost
as heavily as the animals after their gallop, and, now that the deed was
done, lay back wearily in her seat, with pain racking her every joint
and muscle, and a sickening dread in her mind lest there should be
neither strength nor courage forthcoming for what remained to do.For a considerable distance down the street no person was visible from
whom the eager Tracy could get news of what had happened.At last,
however, when the sleigh was within a couple of blocks of what seemed
in the distance to be a centre of interest, a man came along who shouted
from the sidewalk, in response to Reuben’s questions, sundry leading
facts of importance.A fire had started--probably incendiary--in the basement of the office
of the Minster furnaces, some hour or so ago, and had pretty well gutted
the building.The firemen were still playing on the ruins.An immense
crowd had witnessed the fire, and it was the drunkenest crowd he had
ever seen in Thessaly.Where the money came from to buy so much drink,
was what puzzled him.The crowd had pretty well cleared off now; some
said they had gone up to the Minster house to give its occupants a
“horning.” He himself had got his feet wet, and was afraid of the
rheumatics if he stayed out any longer.Probably he would get them, as
it was.Everybody said that the building was insured, and some folks
hinted that the company had it set on fire themselves.Reuben impatiently whipped up the jaded team at this, with a curt “Much
obliged,” and drove at a spanking pace down the street to the scene of
the conflagration.The outer walls
of the office building were still gloomily erect, but within nothing
was left but a glowing mass of embers about level with the ground.Some firemen were inside the yard, but more were congregated about the
water-soaked space where the engine still noisily throbbed, and where
hot coffee was being passed around to them.Here, too, there was a
report that the crowd had gone up to the Minster house.The horses tugged vehemently to drag the sleigh over the impedimenta of
hose stretched along the street, and over the considerable area of bare
stones where the snow had been melted by the heat or washed away by the
streams from the hydrants.Then Reuben half rose in his seat to lash
them into a last furious gallop, and, snorting with rebellion, they tore
onward toward the seminary road.At the corner, three doors from the home of the Minster ladies, Reuben
deemed it prudent to draw up.There was evidently a considerable throng
in the road in front of the house, and that still others were on the
lawn within the gates was obvious from the confused murmur which came
therefrom.Some boys were blowing spasmodically on fish-horns, and
rough jeers and loud boisterous talk rose and fell throughout the dimly
visible assemblage.The air had become thick with large wet snowflakes.Reuben sprang from the sleigh, and, stepping backward, vigorously shook
old Gedney into a state of semi-wakefulness.“Hold these lines,” he said, “and wait here for me.--Or,” he turned to
Jessica with the sudden thought, “would you rather he drove you home?”

The girl had been in a half-insensible condition of mind and body.At
the question she roused herself and shook her head.“No: let me stay
here,” she said, wearily.But when Reuben, squaring his broad shoulders and shaking himself to
free his muscles after the long ride, had disappeared with an energetic
stride in the direction of the crowd, Jessica forced herself to sit
upright, and then to rise to her feet.“You’d better put the blankets on the horses, if he doesn’t come back
right off,” she said to the ’squire.“Where are you going?” Gedney asked, still stupid with sleep.“I’ll walk up and down,” she answered, clambering with difficulty out of
the sleigh.“I’m tired of sitting still.”

Once on the sidewalk, she grew suddenly faint, and grasped a
fence-picket for support.The hand which she instinctively raised to her
heart touched the hard surface of the packet of papers, and the thought
which this inspired put new courage into her veins.With bowed head and a hurried, faltering step, she turned her back upon
the Minster house and stole off into the snowy darkness.CHAPTER XXXIV.--THE CONQUEST OF THE MOB.Even before he reached the gates of the carriage-drive opening upon
the Minster lawn, Reuben Tracy encountered some men whom he knew, and
gathered that the people in the street outside were in the main peaceful
on-lookers, who did not understand very clearly what was going on, and
disapproved of the proceedings as far as they comprehended them.There
was a crowd inside the grounds, he was told, made up in part of men who
were out of work, but composed still more largely, it seemed, of boys
and young hoodlums generally, who were improving the pretext to indulge
in horseplay.There was a report that some sort of deputation had gone
up on the doorstep and rung the bell, with a view to making some remarks
to the occupants of the house; but that they had failed to get any
answer, and certainly the whole front of the residence was black as
night.Reuben easily obtained the consent of several of these citizens to
follow him, and, as they went on, the number swelled to ten or a dozen.Doubtless many more could have been incorporated in the impromptu
procession had it not been so hopelessly dark.The lawyer led his friends through the gate, and began pushing his
way up the gravelled path through the crowd.No special opposition was
offered to his progress, for the air was so full of snow now that only
those immediately affected knew anything about it.Although the path
was fairly thronged, nobody seemed to have any idea why he was standing
there.Those who spoke appeared in the main to regard the matter as a
joke, the point of which was growing more and more obscure.Except for
some sporadic horn-blowing and hooting nearer to the house, the activity
of the assemblage was confined to a handful of boys, who mustered
among them two or three kerosene oil torches treasured from the last
Presidential campaign, and a grotesque jack-o’-lantem made of a pumpkin
and elevated on a broom-stick.These urchins were running about among
the little groups of bystanders, knocking off one another’s caps,
shouting prodigiously, and having a good time.As Reuben and those accompanying him approached the house, some of
these lads raised the cry of “Here’s the coppers!” and the crowd at
this seemed to close up with a simultaneous movement, while a murmur ran
across its surface like the wind over a field of corn.This sound was
one less of menace or even excitement than of gratification that at last
something was going to happen.One of the boys with a torch, in the true spirit of his generation,
placed himself in front of Reuben and marched with mock gravity at the
head of the advancing group.This, drolly enough, lent the movement a
semblance of authority, or at least of significance, before which the
men more readily than ever gave way.At this the other boys with
the torches and jack-o’-lantem fell into line at the rear of Tracy’s
immediate supporters, and they in turn were followed by the throng
generally.Thus whimsically escorted, Reuben reached the front steps of
the mansion.A more compact and apparently homogeneous cluster of men stood here,
some of them even on the steps, and dark and indistinct as everything
was, Reuben leaped to the conclusion that these were the men at least
visibly responsible for this strange gathering.Presumably they were
taken by surprise at his appearance with such a following.At any
rate, they, too, offered no concerted resistance, and he mounted to the
platform of the steps without difficulty.Then he turned and whispered
to a friend to have the boys with the torches also come up.This was
a suggestion gladly obeyed, not least of all by the boy with the
low-comedy pumpkin, whose illumination created a good-natured laugh.Tracy stood now, bareheaded in the falling snow, facing the throng.The
gathering of the lights about him indicated to everybody in the grounds
that the aimless demonstration had finally assumed some kind of form.Then there were
admonitory shouts here and there, under the influence of which the
horn-blowing gradually ceased, and Tracy’s name was passed from mouth to
mouth until its mention took on almost the character of a personal cheer
on the outskirts of the crowd.In answer to this two or three hostile
interrogations or comments were bawled out, but the throng did not favor
these, and so there fell a silence which invited Reuben to speak.“My friends,” he began, and then stopped because he had not pitched his
voice high enough, and a whole semicircle of cries of “louder!” rose
from the darkness of the central lawn.“He’s afraid of waking the fine ladies,” called out an anonymous voice.“Shut up, Tracy, and let the pumpkin talk,” was another shout.“Begorrah, it’s the pumpkin that _is_ talkin’ now!” cried a shrill third
voice, and at this there was a ripple of laughter.“My friends,” began Reuben, in a louder tone, this time without
immediate interruption, “although I don’t know precisely why you have
gathered here at so much discomfort to yourselves, I have some things to
say to you which I think you will regard as important.I have not seen
the persons who live in this house since Tuesday, but while I can easily
understand that your coming here to-night might otherwise cause them
some anxiety, I am sure that they, when they come to understand it,
will be as glad as I am that you _are_ here, and that I am given this
opportunity of speaking for them to you.If you had not taken this
notion of coming here tonight, I should have, in a day or two, asked you
to meet me somewhere else, in a more convenient place, to talk matters
over.“First of all let me tell you that the works are going to be opened
promptly, certainly the furnaces, and unless I am very much mistaken
about the law, the rolling mills too.I give you my word for that, as
the legal representative of two of these women.”

“Yes; they’ll be opened with the Frenchmen!” came a swift answering
shout.“Or will you get Chinamen?” cried another, amid derisive laughter.Reuben responded in his clearest tones: “No man who belongs to Thessaly
shall be crowded out by a newcomer.I give you my word for that, too.”

Some scattered cheers broke out at this announcement, which promised
for the instant to become general, and then were hushed down by the
prevalent anxiety to hear more.In this momentary interval Reuben caught
the sound of a window being cautiously raised immediately above the
front door, and guessed with a little flutter of the heart who this new
auditor might be.“Secondly,” he went on, “you ought to be told the truth about the
shutting down of the furnaces and the lockout.These women were not at
all responsible for either action.I know of my own knowledge that both
things caused them genuine grief, and that they were shocked beyond
measure at the proposal to bring outside workmen into the town to
undersell and drive away their own neighbors and fellow-townsmen.I
want you to realize this, because otherwise you would do a wrong in your
minds to these good women who belong to Thessaly, who are as fond of our
village and its people as any other soul within its borders, and who,
for their own sake as well as that of Stephen Minster’s memory, deserve
respect and liking at your hands.“I may tell you frankly that they were misled and deceived by agents, in
whom, mistakenly enough, they trusted, into temporarily giving power
to these unworthy men.The result was a series of steps which they
deplored, but did not know how to stop.A few days ago I was called
into the case to see what could be done toward undoing the mischief from
which they, and you, and the townspeople generally, suffer.Since then I
have been hard at work both in court and out of it, and I believe I can
say with authority that the attempt to plunder the Minster estate and to
impoverish you will be beaten all along the line.”

This time the outburst of cheering was spontaneous and prolonged.When
it died away, some voice called out, “Three cheers for the ladies!” and
these were given, too, not without laughter at the jack-o’-lantem boy,
who waved his pumpkin vigorously.“One word more,” called out Tracy, “and I hope you will take in good
part what I am going to say.When I made my way up through the grounds,
I was struck by the fact that nobody seemed to know just why he had come
here.I gather now that word was passed around during the day that there
would be a crowd here, and that something, nobody understood just what,
would be done after they got here.I do not know who started the idea,
or who circulated the word.It might be worth your while to find out.Meanwhile, don’t you agree with me that it is an unsatisfactory and
uncivil way of going at the thing?This is a free country, but just
because it _is_ free, we ought to feel the more bound to respect one
another’s rights.There are countries in which, I dare say, if I were a
citizen, or rather a subject, I might feel it my duty to head a mob or
join a riot.But here there ought to be no mob; there should be no room
for even thought of a riot.Our very strength lies in the idea that we
are our own policemen--our own soldiery.I say this not because one in
a hundred of you meant any special harm in coming here, but because the
notion of coming itself was not American.Beware of men who suggest that
kind of thing.Beware of men who preach the theory that because you are
puddlers or moulders or firemen, therefore you are different from the
rest of your fellow-citizens.I, for one, resent the idea that because I
am a lawyer, and you, for example, are a blacksmith, therefore we belong
to different classes.I wish with all my heart that everybody resented
it, and that that abominable word ‘classes’ could be wiped out of the
English language as it is spoken in America.I am glad if
you feel easier in your minds than you did when you came.If you do,
I guess there’s been no harm done by your coming which isn’t more than
balanced by the good that has come out of it.Only next time, if you
don’t mind, we’ll have our meeting somewhere else, where it will be
easier to speak than it is in a snowstorm, and where we won’t keep our
neighbors awake.And now good-night, everybody.”

Out of the satisfied and amiable murmur which spread through the crowd
at this, there rose a sharp, querulous voice:

“Give us the names of the men who, you say, _were_ responsible.”

“No, I can’t do that to-night.But if you read the next list of
indictments found by the grand jury of Dearborn County, my word as a
lawyer you’ll find them all there.”

The loudest cheer of the evening burst upon the air at this, and there
was a sustained roar when Tracy’s name was shouted out above the tumult.Some few men crowded up to the steps to shake hands with him, and many
others called out to him a personal “good-night.” The last of those to
shake the accumulated snow from their collars and hats, and turn their
steps homeward, noted that the whole front of the Minster house had
suddenly become illuminated.Thus Reuben’s simple and highly fortuitous conquest of what had been
planned to be a mob was accomplished.It is remembered to this day as
the best thing any man ever did single-handed in Thessaly, and it is
always spoken of as the foundation of his present political eminence.But he himself would say now, upon reflection, that he succeeded
because the better sense of his auditors, from the outset, wanted him
to succeed, and because he was lucky enough to impress a very decent and
bright-witted lot of men with the idea that he wasn’t a humbug.*****

At the moment he was in no mood to analyze his success.His hair was
streaming with melted snow, his throat was painfully hoarse and sore,
and the fatigue from speaking so loud, and the reaction from his great
excitement, combined to make him feel a very weak brother indeed.So utterly wearied was he that when the door of the now lighted hallway
opened behind him, and Miss Kate herself, standing in front of the
servant on the threshold, said: “We want you to come in, Mr.Tracy,” he
turned mechanically and went in, thinking more of a drink of some sort
and a chance to sit down beside her, than of all the possible results of
his speech to the crowd.The effect of warmth and welcome inside the mansion was grateful to
all his senses.He parted with his hat and overcoat, took the glass of
claret which was offered him, and allowed himself to be led into the
drawing-room and given a seat, all in a happy daze, which was, in truth,
so very happy, that he was dimly conscious of the beginnings of tears
in his eyes.It seemed now that the strain upon his mind and heart--the
anger, and fright, and terrible anxiety--had lasted for whole weary
years.Trial by soul-torture was new to him, and this ordeal through
which he had passed left him curiously flabby and tremulous.He lay back in the easy-chair in an ecstasy of physical lassitude and
mental content, surrendering himself to the delight of watching the
beautiful girl before him, and of listening to the music of her voice.The liquid depths of brown eyes into which he looked, and the soft tones
which wooed his hearing, produced upon him vaguely the sensation of
shining white robes and celestial harps--an indefinitely glorious
recompense for the travail that lay behind in the valley of the shadow
of death.Nothing was further from him than the temptation to break this bright
spell by speech.“We heard almost every word of what you said,” Kate was saying.“When
you began we were in this room, crouched there by the window--that is,
Ethel and I were, for mamma refused to even pretend to listen--and at
first we thought it was one of the mob, and then Ethel recognized your
voice.That almost annoyed me, for it seemed as if _I_ should have
been---at least, equally quick to know it--that is, I mean, I’ve heard
you speak so much more than she has.And then we both hurried up-stairs,
and lifted the window--and oh!“And from the moment we knew it was you--that you were here--we felt
perfectly safe.It doesn’t seem now that we were very much afraid, even
before that, although probably we were.There was a lot of hooting, and
that dreadful blowing on horns, and all that, and once somebody rang the
door-bell; but, beyond throwing snowballs, nothing else was done.So
I daresay they only wanted to scare us.Of course it was the fire that
made us really nervous.We got that brave girl’s warning about the mob’s
coming here just a little while before the sky began to redden with the
blaze; and that sight, coming on the heels of her letter--”

“What girl?“Here it is,” answered Kate, drawing a crumpled sheet of paper from her
bosom, and reading aloud:

“Dear Miss Minster:

“I have just heard that a crowd of men are coming to your house to-night
to do violent things.I am starting out to try and bring you help.Meanwhile, I send you my father, who will do whatever you tell him to
do.“Gratefully yours,

“Jessica Lawton.”

Reuben had risen abruptly to his feet before the signature was reached.“I am ashamed of myself,” he said; “I’ve left her out there all this
while.There was so much else that really she
escaped my memory altogether.”

He had made his way out into the hall and taken up his hat and coat.“You will come back, won’t you?” Kate asked.“There are so many things
to talk over, with all of us.And--and bring her too, if--if she will
come.”

With a sign of acquiescence and comprehension.Reuben darted down the
steps and into the darkness.In a very few minutes he returned,
disappointment written all over his face.Gedney, the man I left with the sleigh, says she went off
as soon as I had got out of sight.I had offered to have him drive her
home, but she refused.She’s a curiously independent girl.”

“I am very sorry,” said Kate.“But I will go over the first thing in the
morning and thank her.”

“You don’t as yet know the half of what you have to thank her for,”
 put in the lawyer.“I don’t mean that it was so great a thing--my
coming--but she drove all the way out to my mother’s farm to bring me
here to-night, and fainted when she got there.If
her father is still here, I think he’d better go at once to her place,
and see about her.”

The suggestion seemed a good one, and was instantly acted upon.Ben
Lawton had been in the kitchen, immensely proud of his position as
the responsible garrison of a beleaguered house, and came out into the
hallway now with a full stomach and a satisfied expression on his lank
face.He assented with readiness to Reuben’s idea, when it was explained to
him.“So she druv out to your mother’s place for you, did she?” he commented,
admiringly.“That girl’s a genuwine chip of the old block.I mean,” he
added, with an apologetic smile, “of the old, old block.I ain’t got so
much git-up-and-git about me, that I know of, but her grandfather was a
regular snorter!”

“We shall not forget how much we are obliged to you, Mr.Lawton,” said
Kate, pleasantly, offering him her hand.“Be sure that you tell your
daughter, too, how grateful we all are.”

Ben took the delicate hand thus amazingly extended to him, and shook it
with formal awkwardness.“I didn’t seem to do much,” he said, deprecatingly, “and perhaps I
wouldn’t have amounted to much, neether, if it had a-come to fightin’
and gougin’ and wras’lin’ round generally.But you can bet your boots,
ma’am, that I’d a-done what I could!”

With this chivalrous assurance Ben withdrew, and marched down the steps
with a carriage more nearly erect than Thessaly had ever seen him assume
before.The heavy front door swung to, and Reuben realized, with a new rush of
charmed emotion, that heaven had opened for him once more.A servant came and whispered something to Miss Kate.The latter nodded,
and then turned to Reuben with a smile full of light and softness.“If you will give me your arm,” she said, in a delicious murmur, “we
will go into the dining-room.My mother and sister are waiting for us
there.We are not supper-people as a rule, but it seemed right to have
one to-night.”




CHAPTER XXXV.--THE SHINING REWARD.The scene which opened upon Reuben’s eyes was like a vista of
fairyland.The dark panelled room, with its dim suggestions of gold
frames and heavy curtains, and its background of palms and oleanders,
contributed with the reticence of richness to the glowing splendor of
the table in its centre.Here all light was concentrated--light which
fell from beneath ruby shades at the summits of tall candles, and
softened the dazzling whiteness of the linen, mellowed the burnished
gleam of the silver plate, reflected itself in tender, prismatic hues
from the facets of the cut-glass decanters.There were flowers here
which gave forth still the blended fragrance of their hot-house home,
and fragile, painted china, and all the nameless things of luxury which
can make the breaking of bread a poem.Reuben had seen something dimly resembling this in New York once or
twice at semi-public dinners.The thought that this higher marvel was
in his honor intoxicated his reason.The other thought--that conceivably
his future might lie all in this flower-strewn, daintily lighted
path--was too heady, too full of threatened delirium, to be even
entertained.With an anxious hold upon himself, he felt his way forward
to self-possession.It came sooner than he had imagined it would, and
thereafter everything belonged to a dream of delight.The ladies were all dressed more elaborately than he had observed them
to be on any previous occasion, and, at the outset, there was something
disconcerting in this.Speedily enough, though, there came the
reflection that his clothes were those in which he had raced
breathlessly from the farm, in which he had faced and won the crowd
outside, and then, all at once, he was at perfect ease.He told them--addressing his talk chiefly to Mrs.Minster, who sat at
the head of the table, to his left--the story of Jessica’s ride, of her
fainting on her arrival, and of the furious homeward drive.From this
he drifted to the final proofs which had been procured at Cadmus--he
had sent Gedney home with the horses, and was to see him early in the
morning--and then to the steps toward a criminal prosecution which he
would summarily take.“So far as I can see, Mrs.Minster,” he concluded, when the servant
had again left the room, “no real loss will result from this whole
imbroglio.It may even show a net gain, when everything is cleared
up; for your big loan must really give you control of the Thessaly
Manufacturing Company, in law.These fellows staked their majority
interest in that concern to win your whole property in the game.They have lost, and the proceeds must go to you.Of course, it is not
entirely clear how the matter will shape itself; but my notion is that
you will come out winner.”

Mrs.“My daughters thought that I knew
nothing about business!” she said, with an air of easy triumph.The daughters displayed great eagerness to leave this branch of the
matter undiscussed.“And will it really be necessary to prosecute these men?” asked Ethel,
from Reuben’s right.The lawyer realized, even before he spoke, that not a little of his
bitterness had evaporated.“Men ought to be punished for such a crime as
they committed,” he said.“If only as a duty to the public, they should
be prosecuted.”

He was looking at Kate as he spoke, and in her glance, as their eyes
met, he read something which prompted him hastily to add:

“Of course, I am in your hands in the matter.I have committed myself
with the crowd outside to the statement that they should be punished.I
was full, then, of angry feelings; and I still think that they ought to
be punished.But it is really your question, not mine.And I may even
tell you that there would probably be a considerable financial advantage
in settling the thing with them, instead of taking it before the grand
jury.”

“That is a consideration which we won’t discuss,” said Kate.“If my mind
were clear as to the necessity of a prosecution, I would not alter the
decision for any amount of money.But my sister and I have been talking
a great deal about this matter, and we feel--You know that Mr.Boyce
was, for a time, on quite a friendly footing in this house.”

“Yes; I know.” Reuben bowed his head gravely.“Well, you yourself said that if one was prosecuted, they all must be.”

“No doubt.Wendover and Tenney were smart enough to put the credulous
youngster in the very forefront of everything.Until these affidavits
came to hand to-day, it would have been far easier to convict him than
them.”

“Precisely,” urged Kate.“Credulous is just the word.He was weak,
foolish, vain--whatever you like.But I
don’t believe that at the outset, or, indeed, till very recently, he had
any idea of being a party to a plan to plunder us.There are reasons,”
 the girl blushed a little, and hesitated, “to be frank, there are
reasons for my thinking so.”

Reuben, noting the faint flush of embarrassment, catching the doubtful
inflection of the words, felt that he comprehended everything, and
mirrored that feeling in his glance.“I quite follow you,” he said.“It is my notion that he was deceived, at
the beginning.”

“Others deceived him, and still more he deceived himself,” responded
Kate.“And that is why,” put in Ethel, “we feel like asking you not to take
the matter into the courts--I mean so as to put him in prison.It would
be too dreadful to think of--to take a man who had dined at your house,
and been boating with you, and had driven with you all over the Orange
Mountains, picking wild-flowers for you and all that, and put him into
prison, where he would have his hair shaved off, and tramp up and down
on a treadmill.No; we mustn’t do that, Mr.Tracy.”

Kate added musingly: “He has lost so much, we can afford to be generous,
can we not?”

Then Reuben felt that there could be no answer possible except “yes.”
 His heart pleaded with his brain for a lover’s interpretation of this
speech; and his tongue, to evade the issue, framed some halting words
about allowing him to go over the whole case to-morrow, and postponing a
final decision until that had been done.The consent of silence was accorded to this, and everybody at the
table knew that there would be no prosecutions.Upon the instant the
atmosphere grew lighter.“And now for the real thing,” said Kate, gayly.“I am commissioned on
behalf of the entire family to formally thank you for coming to our
rescue tonight.Mamma did not hear your speech--she resolutely sat in
the library, pretending to read, during the whole rumpus, and we were
in such a hurry to get up-stairs that we didn’t tell her when you
began--but she couldn’t help hearing the horns, and she is as much
obliged to you as we are; and that is very, very, very much indeed!”

“Yes, indeed,” assented Mrs.“I don’t know where the police
were, at all.”

“The police could have done next to nothing, if they had been
here,” said Reuben.“The visit of the crowd was annoying enough, and
discreditable in its way, but I don’t really imagine there was ever any
actual danger.The men felt disagreeable about the closing of the works
and the importation of the French Canadians, and I don’t blame them;
but as a body they never had any idea of molesting you.My own notion is
that the mob was organized by outsiders--by men who had an end to serve
in frightening you--and that after the crowd got here it didn’t know
what to do with itself.The truth is, that the mob isn’t an American
institution.Its component parts are too civilized, too open to appeals
to reason.As soon as I told these people the facts in the case, they
were quite ready to go, and they even cheered for you before they went.”

“Ethel tells me that you promised them the furnaces should be opened
promptly,” said the mother, with her calm, inquiring glance, which might
mean sarcasm, anger, approval, or nothing at all.Reuben answered resolutely: “Yes, Mrs.And so they must
be opened, on Monday.It is my dearest
wish that I should be able to act for you all in this whole business.But I have gone too far now, the interests involved are too great, to
make a pause here possible.The very essence of the situation is that we
should defy the trust, and throw upon it the _onus_ of stopping us if it
can.We have such a grip upon the men who led you into that trust, and
who can influence the decisions of its directors, that they will not
dare to show fight.The force of circumstances has made me the custodian
of your interests quite as much as of your daughters’.I am very proud
and happy that it is so.It is true that I have not your warrant for
acting in your behalf; but if you will permit me to say so, that cannot
now be allowed to make the slightest difference in my action.”

“Yes, mamma, you are to be rescued in spite of yourself,” said Ethel,
merrily.The young people were all smiling at one another, and to their
considerable relief Mrs.Nobody attempted to analyze the mental processes by which she had been
brought around.It was enough that she had come to accept the situation.The black shadow of discord, which had overhung the household so long,
was gone, and mother and daughters joined in a sigh of grateful relief.It must have been nearly midnight when Reuben rose finally to go.There
had been so much to talk about, and time had flown so softly, buoyantly
along, that the evening seemed to him only to have begun, and he felt
that he fain would have had it go on forever.These delicious hours that
were past had been one sweet sustained conspiracy to do him honor, to
minister to his pleasure.No word or smile or deferential glance of
attention had been wanting to make complete the homage with which the
family had chosen to envelop him.The sense of tender domestic intimacy
had surcharged the very air he breathed.It had not even been necessary
to keep the ball of talk in motion: so well and truly did they know one
another, that silences had come as natural rests--silences more eloquent
than spoken words could be of mutual liking and trust.The outside world
had shrunk to nothingness.Here within this charmed circle of softened
light was home.All that the whole universe contained for him of beauty,
of romance, of reverential desire, of happiness, here within touch it
was centred.The farewells that found their way into phrases left scarcely a mark
upon his memory.There had been cordial, softly significant words of
smiling leave-taking with Ethel and her mother, and then, divinely
prompted by the spirit which ruled this blessed hour, they had gone
away, and he stood alone in the hallway with the woman he worshipped.He
held her hand in his, and there was no need for speech.Slowly, devoutly, he bowed his head over this white hand, and pressed
his lips upon it.There were tears in his eyes when he stood erect
again, and through them he saw with dim rapture the marvel of an angel’s
face, pale, yet glowing in the half light, lovely beyond all mortal
dreams; and on this face there shone a smile, tender, languorous,
trembling with the supreme ecstasy of a soul.Reuben could hardly have told as he walked away down
the path to the street.bless you!” was what the song-birds
carolled in his brain; but whether the music was an echo of what he had
said, did not make itself clear.He was scarcely conscious of the physical element of walking in his
progress.Rather it seemed to him that his whole being was afloat in the
ether, wafted forward by the halcyon winds of a beneficent destiny.Was
there ever such unthinkable bliss before in all the vast span of the
universe?The snowfall had long since ceased, and the clouds were gone.The air
was colder, and the broad sky was brilliant with the clear starlight of
winter.To the lover’s eyes, the great planets were nearer, strangely
nearer, than they had ever been before, and the undying fire with which
they burned was the same that glowed in his own heart.His senses linked
themselves to the grand procession of the skies.The triumphant onward
glide of the earth itself within this colossal scheme of movement was
apparent to him, and seemed but a part of his own resistless, glorified
onward sweep.Oh, this--_this_ was life!*****

At the same hour a heavy and lumpish man made his way homeward by a
neighboring street, tramping with difficulty through the hardening snow
which lay thick upon the walks.There was nothing buoyant in his stride,
and he never once lifted his eyes to observe the luminous panorama
spread overhead.With his hands plunged deep into his pockets, and his
cane under his arm, he trudged moodily along, his shoulders rounded and
his brows bent in a frown.An acquaintance going in the other direction called out cheerily as he
passed, “Hello, General!Pretty tough walking, isn’t it?” and had only
an inarticulate grunt for an answer.There were evil hints abroad in the village below, this night--stories
of impending revelations of fraud, hints of coming prosecutions--and
General Boyce had heard enough of these to grow sick at heart.That
Horace had been deeply mixed up in something scoundrelly, seemed only
too evident.Since this foolish, ungrateful boy had left the paternal
roof, his father had surrendered himself more than ever to drink; but
indulgence now, instead of the old brightening merriment of song and
quip and pleasantly reminiscent camp-fire sparkle, seemed to swing him
like a pendulum between the extremes of sullen wrath and almost tearful
weakness.Something of both these moods weighted his mind to-night, and
to their burden was added a crushingly gloomy apprehension that naked
disgrace was coming as well.Precisely what it was, he knew not; but
winks and nods and unnatural efforts to shift the conversation when
he came in had been in the air about him all the evening.The very
vagueness of the fear lent it fresh terror.His own gate was reached at last, and he turned wearily into the path
which encircled the small yard to reach the front door.He cursorily
noted the existence of some partially obliterated footprints in the
snow, and took it for granted that one of the servants had been out
late.He had begun fumbling in his pocket for the key, and had his foot on the
lower step, before he discovered in the dim light something which
gave even his martial nerves a start.The dark-clad figure of a woman,
obviously well dressed, apparently young, lay before him, the head and
arms bent under against his very door.The General was a man of swift decision and ready resource.In an
instant he had lifted the figure up out of the snow which half enveloped
it, and sustained it in one arm, while with the other he sent the
reverberating clamor of the door-bell pealing through the house.Then,
unlocking the door, he bore his burden lightly into the hall, turned up
the gas, and disposed the inanimate form on a chair.He did not know the woman, but it was evident that she was very
ill--perhaps dying.When the servant came down, he bade her run with all possible haste for
Dr.Lester, who lived only a block or so away.CHAPTER XXXVI.--“I TELL YOU I HAVE LIVED IT DOWN!”

 Instead of snow and cold and the black terror of being overwhelmed
by stormy night, here were light and warmth and a curiously sleepy yet
volatile sense of comfort.Jessica’s eyes for a long time rested tranquilly upon what seemed a
gigantic rose hanging directly over her head.Her brain received no
impression whatever as to why it was there, and there was not the
slightest impulse to wonder or to think about it at all.Even when it
finally began to descend nearer, and to expand and unfold pale pink
leaves, still it was satisfying not to have to make any effort toward
understanding it.The transformation went on with infinite slowness
before her vacantly contented vision.Upon all sides the outer leaves
gradually, little by little, stretched themselves downward, still
downward, until they enveloped her as in the bell of some huge inverted
lily.Indefinite spaces of time intervened, and then it became vaguely
apparent that faint designs of other, smaller flowers were scattered
over these large environing leaves, and that a soft, ruddy light came
through them.With measured deliberation, as if all eternity were at
its disposal, this vast floral cone revealed itself at last to her
dim consciousness as being made of some thin, figured cloth.It seemed
weeks--months--before she further comprehended that the rose above her
was the embroidered centre of a canopy, and that the leaves depending
from it in long, graceful curves about her were bed-curtains.After a time she found herself lifting her hand upright and looking at
it.It was wan and white like wax, as if it did not belong to her at
all.From the wrist there was turned back the delicately quilted cuff of
a man’s silk night-shirt.She raised the arm in its novel silken sleeve,
and thrust it forward with some unformed notion that it would prove not
to be hers.The action pushed aside the curtains, and a glare of light
flashed in, under which she shut her eyes and gasped.When she looked again, an elderly, broad-figured man with a florid face
was standing close beside the bed, gazing with anxiety upon her.She
knew that it was General Boyce, and for a long time was not surprised
that he should be there.The capacity for wondering, for thinking about
things, seemed not to exist in her brain.She looked at him calmly and
did not dream of speaking.“Are you better?” she heard him eagerly whisper.“Are you in pain?”

The complex difficulty of two questions which required separate answers
troubled her remotely.She made some faint nodding motion of her head
and eyes, and then lay perfectly still again.She could hear the sound
of her own breathing--a hoarse, sighing sound, as if of blowing through
a comb--and, now that it was suggested to her, there was a deadened
heavy ache in her breast.Still placidly surveying the General, she began to be conscious of
remembering things.The pictures came slowly, taking form with a
fantastic absence of consecutive meaning, but they gradually produced
the effect of a recollection upon her mind.The starting point--and
everything else that went before that terrible sinking, despairing
struggle through the wet snow--was missing.She recalled most vividly
of all being seized with a sudden crisis of swimming giddiness
and choking--her throat and chest all afire with the tortures of
suffocation.It was under a lamp-post, she remembered; and when the
vehement coughing was over, her mouth was full of blood, and there were
terrifying crimson spatters on the snow.She had stood aghast at this,
and then fallen to weeping piteously to herself with fright.How strange
it was--in the anguish of that moment she had moaned out, “O mother,
mother!” and yet she had never seen that parent, and had scarcely
thought of her memory even for many, many years.Then she had blindly staggered on, sinking more than once from sheer
exhaustion, but still forcing herself forward, her wet feet weighing
like leaden balls, and fierce agonies clutching her very heart.She had
fallen in the snow at the very end of her journey; had dragged herself
laboriously, painfully, up on to the steps, and had beaten feebly on the
panels of the door with her numbed hands, making an inarticulate moan
which not all her desperate last effort could lift into a cry; and then
there had come, with a great downward swoop of skies and storm, utter
blackness and collapse.She closed her eyes now in the weariness which this effort at
recollection had caused.Her senses wandered off, unbidden, unguided,
to a dream of the buzzing of a bee upon a window-pane, which was somehow
like the stertorous sound of her own breathing.The bee--a big, loud, foolish fellow, with yellow fur upon his broad
back and thighs--had flown into the schoolroom, and had not wit enough
to go out again.Some of the children were giggling over this, but
she would not join them because Mr.Tracy, the schoolmaster upon the
platform, did not wish it.Already
she delighted in the hope that he liked her better than he did some of
the other girls--scornful girls who came from wealthy homes, and wore
better dresses than any of the despised Lawton brood could ever hope to
have.Silk dresses, opened boldly at the throat, and with long trains
tricked out with imitation garlands.They were worn now by older
girls--hard-faced, jealous, cruel creatures--and these sat in a room
with lace curtains and luxurious furniture.And some laughed with a ring
like brass in their voices, and some wept furtively in comers, and some
cursed their God and all living things; and there was the odor of wine
and the uproar of the piano, and over all a great, ceaseless shame and
terror.Escape from this should be made at all hazards; and the long, incredibly
fearful flight, with pursuit always pressing hot upon her, the evil
fangs of the wolf-pack snapping in the air all about her frightened
ears, led to a peaceful, soft-carpeted forest, where the low setting
sun spread a red light among the big tree-trunks.Against this deep,
far-distant sky there was the figure of a man coming.For him she waited
with a song in her heart.It was Reuben Tracy, and
he was too gentle and good not to see her when he passed.She would call
out to him--and lo!Horace was with her, and held her hand; and they both gazed with
terrified longing after Tracy, and could not cry out to him for the
awful dumbness that was on them.And when he, refusing to see them,
spread out his arms in anger, the whole great forest began to sway and
circle dizzily, and huge trees toppled, rocks crashed downward, gaunt
giant reptiles rose from yawning caves with hideous slimy eyes in a
lurid ring about her.And she would save Horace with her life, and
fought like mad, bleeding and maimed and frenzied, until the weight
of mountains piled upon her breast held her down in helpless, choking
horror.Then only came the power to scream, and--

Out of the roar of confusion and darkness came suddenly a hush and the
return of light.She was lying in the curtained bed, and a tender hand
was pressing soft cool linen to her lips.Opening her eyes in tranquil weakness, she saw two men standing at her
bedside.He who held the cloth in his hand was Dr.Lester, whom she
remembered very well.The other--he whose head was bowed, and whose eyes
were fastened upon hers with a pained and affrighted gaze--was Horace
Boyce.In her soul she smiled at him, but no answering softness came to his
harrowed face.“I told your father everything,” she heard the doctor say in a low tone.I happened to have attended her, by
the merest chance, when her child was born.”

“Her child?” the other asked, in the same low, far-away voice.He is in Thessaly now, a boy nearly six years
old.”

“Good God!I never knew--”

“You seem to have taken precious good care not to know,” said the
doctor, with grave dislike.“This is the time and place to speak plainly
to you, Boyce.This poor girl has come to her death through the effort
to save you from disgrace.She supposed you lived here, and dragged
herself here to help you.” Jessica heard the sentence of doom without
even a passing thought.Every energy left in her feebly fluttering
brain was concentrated upon the question, _Is_ he saved?Vaguely the
circumstances of the papers, of the threats against Horace, of her
desires and actions, seemed to come back to her memory.She waited in
dazed suspense to hear what Horace would say; but he only hung his head
the lower, and left the doctor to go on.“She raved for hours last night,” he said, “after the women had got her
to bed, and we had raised her out of the comatose state, about saving
you from State prison.First she would plead with Tracy, then she would
appeal to you to fly, and so backwards and forwards, until she wore
herself out.The papers she had got hold of--they must have slipped out
of Gedney’s pocket into the sleigh.I suppose you know that I took them
back to Tracy this morning?”

Still Horace made no answer, but bent that crushed and vacant gaze
upon her face.She marvelled that he could not see she was awake and
conscious, and still more that the strength and will to speak were
withheld from her.The dreadful pressure upon her breast was making
itself felt again, and the painful sound of the labored breathing took
on the sombre rhythm of a distant death-chant.No: still the doctor went on:

“Tracy will be here in a few minutes.He’s terribly upset by the thing,
and has gone first to tell the news at the Minsters’.Do you want to see
him when he comes?”

“I don’t know what I want,” said Horace, gloomily.“If I were you, I would go straight to him and say frankly, ‘I have been
a damned fool, and a still damneder hypocrite, and I throw myself on
your mercy.’ He’s the tenderest-hearted man alive, and this sight here
will move him.Upon my word, I can hardly keep the tears out of my eyes
myself.”

Jessica saw as through a mist that these two men’s faces, turned upon
her, were softened with a deep compassion.Then suddenly the power to
speak came to her.It was a puny and unnatural voice which fell upon her
ears--low and hoarsely grating, and the product of much pain.“Go away--doctor,” she murmured.“Leave him here.”

Horace sat softly upon the edge of the bed, and gathered her two hands
tenderly in his.He did not attempt to keep back the tears which welled
to his eyes, nor did he try to talk.Thus they were together for what
seemed a long time, surrounded by a silence which was full of voices
to them both.A wan smile settled upon her face as she held him in her
intent gaze.“Take the boy,” she whispered at last; “he is Horace, too.Don’t let him
lie--ever--to any girl.”

The young man groaned in spite of himself, and for answer gently pressed
her hands.“I promise you that, Jess,” he said, after a time, in a
broken voice.He bent over and kissed her on the forehead.The damp
roughness of the skin chilled and terrified him, but the radiance on her
face deepened.“It hurts--to breathe,” she said, after a time with a glance of
affectionate apology in her smile.Subdued noises were faintly heard now in the hallway outside, and
presently the door was opened cautiously, and a tall new figure entered
the room.After a moment’s hesitation Reuben Tracy tiptoed his way to
the bedside, and stood gravely behind and above his former partner.“Is she conscious?” he asked of Boyce, in a tremulous whisper; and
Horace, bending his head still lower, murmured between choking sobs: “It
is Mr.Tracy, Jess, come to say--to see you.”

Her eyes brightened with intelligence.“Good--good,” she said, slowly,
as if musing to herself.The gaze which she fastened upon Reuben’s face
was strangely full of intense meaning, and he felt it piercing his
very heart.Minutes went by under the strain of this deep, half-wild,
appealing look.At last she spoke, with a greater effort at distinctness
than before, and in a momentarily clearer tone.“You were always kind,” she said.“Don’t hurt--my boy.Shake hands with
him--for my sake.”

The two young men obeyed mechanically, after an instant’s pause, and
without looking at each other.Neither had eyes save for the white face
on the pillows in front of them, and for the gladdened, restful light
which spread softly over it as their hands touched in amity before her
vision.In the languor of peace which had come to possess her, even the sense of
pain in breathing was gone.There were shadowy figures on the retina of
her brain, but they conveyed no idea save of general beatitude to her
mind.The space in which her senses floated was radiant and warm and
full of formless beauty.Various individuals--types of her loosening
ties to life--came and went almost unheeded in this daze.Lucinda, vehemently weeping, and holding the little fair-haired,
wondering boy over the bed for her final kiss, passed away like a
dissolving mist.Her father’s face, too, dawned upon this dream,
tear-stained and woful, and faded again into nothingness.Other flitting
apparitions there were, even more vague and brief, melting noiselessly
into the darkened hush.The unclouded calm of this lethargy grew troubled presently when there
fell upon her dulled ear the low tones of a remembered woman’s voice.Enough of consciousness flickered up to tell her whose it was.She
strained her eyes in the gathering shadows to see Kate Minster, and
began restlessly to roll her head upon the pillow.“Where--where--_her?_” she moaned, striving to stretch forth her hand.It was lifted and held softly in a tender grasp, and she felt as well
a compassionate stroking touch laid upon her forehead.The gentle
magnetism of these helped the dying girl to bring into momentary being
the image of a countenance close above hers--a dark, beautiful face, all
melting now with affection and grief.She smiled faintly into this face,
and lay still again for a long time.The breathing grew terribly shorter
and more labored, the light faded.Did you not
confess to me in former days that you could not see into the future?And here you are, raising up ghosts to make the present more bitter
than it is.Black as things appear, there are bright
years yet in store for you.'"'I cannot help my forebodings, Louis.True, I cannot, nor can any
man, see into the future, but what can I do to turn my brother's hate
from me?'It was a cry of anguish wrung from his suffering heart.'I
think of the days of our childhood, when we strolled in the woods with
our arms round each other's necks, I think of the dreams we mapped of
the future.Running water by the side of which we sat, bending over to
see our faces, and making our lips meet in a shadowed kiss, flowers we
picked in field and meadow, errands of mercy we went upon together,
twilight communings, the little sweethearts we had--all these innocent
ways of childhood rise before me, and fill me with anguish.What can I
do?--what can I do to bring him back to me in brotherly love?Louis, I
have a fear that I have never whispered to living soul.It is that
Avicia may have twin children, as Kristel and I are, and they should
grow up to be as we are now!Would it not be better that they should
be born dead, or die young, when their souls are not stained with
hatred of each other and with evil thoughts that render existence a
curse?'"We were alone when he gave expression to his agonised feelings;
Avicia had left us to attend to domestic duties.I could say nothing
to comfort him; to harp upon one string of intended consolation to a
man who is in no mood to accept it becomes, after a time, an
oppression.He paced up and down, twining his fingers convulsively,
and presently said,

"'It would be too much, Louis, to ask you to remain with me a little
while?'"'No,' I replied, 'it would not.Indeed, it was partly in my mind to
suggest it.The crisis you have dreaded for many years has come, and
if you wish me to stop with you a day or two I will willingly do so.It may be--I do not know how--that I can be of service to you.The
boatmen are waiting in the boat below.I will write a letter to my
wife, and they shall post it, informing her that I shall be absent
from home perhaps until the end of the week, by which time I hope the
cloud will have passed away.No thanks, Silvain; friendship would be a
poor and valueless thing if one shrank from a sacrifice so slight.'"I wrote my letter, and despatched it by the boatmen.Then we waited
for events; it was all that it was in our power to do."Avicia was very glad when she heard of my intention to remain with
them a while."'Your companionship will do him good,' she said.'He has no one but
me to talk to, and he speaks of but one subject.If this continues
long he will lose his reason.'"The day passed, and night came on.There was but scanty living
accommodation in the lighthouse, but a mattress was spread for me upon
the floor of the tiny kitchen; and there I was to sleep.Avicia and
Silvain wished me to occupy their bed, but I would not have it so.Before retiring to rest, Silvain and I passed two or three hours in
converse; I purposely led the conversation into foreign channels, and
when I wished him good-night I was rejoiced to perceive that I had
succeeded for a brief space in diverting his mind from the fears which
weighed so heavily upon him."Nothing occurred during the night to disturb us; I awoke early, and
lay waiting for sunrise; but no light came, and when, aroused by
Silvain, I left my bed and went to the outer gallery, I was surprised
to see that all surrounding space was wrapt in a thick mist."'A great storm will soon be upon us,' said Silvain."He was right; before noon the storm burst, and the sea was lashed
into fury.It was a relief to see the play of lightning upon the angry
waters, but it was terrible too, and I thought how awful and joyless a
lone life must be when spent in such a home.This second day seemed as
if it would never end, and it was only by my watch that I knew of the
approach of night.With the sounds of the storm in my ears I lay down
upon my mattress and fell asleep."I know not at what time of the night I awoke, but with black darkness
upon and around me, I found myself sitting up, listening to sounds
without which did not proceed from the conflict of the elements.At
first I could not decide whether they were real or but the refrain of
a dream by which I had been disturbed; soon, however, I received
indisputable evidence that they were not the creations of my fancy."The voice was Silvain's, and the words were uttered in outer space.When I retired to rest I had lain down in my clothes, removing only my
coat, and using it as a covering.I quickly put it on, and lit a lamp,
to which a chain was attached, by which means it could be held over
the walls of the lighthouse.The lamp was scarcely lighted, when
Avicia, but half dressed, rushed into the little room."Her eyes wandered round the room, seeking him.At that moment the
voice from without pierced the air."I threw my arms round Avicia, and held her fast.'Are you, too, leagued against
us?"It needed all my strength to restrain her from rushing out in her
wild delirium, perhaps to her destruction.I whispered to her
hurriedly that I intended to go to the outer gallery, and that she
should accompany me; and also that if she truly wished to be of
assistance to her husband she must be calm.She ceased instantly to
struggle, and said in a tone of suppressed excitement,

"'Come, then.'"I did not quit my hold of her, but I used now only one hand, which I
clasped firmly round her wrist, my other being required for the
lantern.The next moment we were standing upon the gallery, bending
over.It was pitch dark, and we could see nothing; even the white
spray of the waves, as they dashed against the stone walls, was not
visible to us; but we heard Silvain's voice, at intervals, appealing
in frenzied tones to Kristel, who, it needed not the evidence of sight
to know, was holding on to the chains and struggling with his brother.How the two came into that awful position was never discovered, and I
could only judge by inference that Kristel, in the dead of this deadly
night, had made his way by some means to the lighthouse, and was
endeavouring to effect an entrance, when Silvain, awakened by his
attempts, had gone out to him, and was instantly seized and dragged
down."So fearful and confused were the minutes that immediately followed
that I have but an indistinct impression of the occurrences of the
time, which will live ever within me as the most awful in my life.I
know that I never lost my grasp of Avicia, and that but for me she
would have flung herself over the walls; I know that the brothers were
engaged in a struggle for life and death, and that Silvain continued
to make the most pathetic appeals to Kristel to listen to him, and not
to stain his soul with blood; I know that in those appeals there were
the tenderest references to their boyhood's days, to the love which
had existed between them, each for the other, to trivial incidents in
their childhood, to their mother who worshipped them and was now
looking down upon them, to the hopes in which they had indulged of a
life of harmony and affection; I know that it struck me then as most
terrible that during the whole of the struggle no word issued from
Kristel's lips; I know that there were heartrending appeals from
Avicia to Kristel to spare her husband, and that there were tender
cries from her to Silvain, and from Silvain to her; I know that,
finding a loose chain on the gallery, I lowered it to the combatants,
and called out to Silvain--foolishly enough, in so far as he could
avail himself of it--to release himself from his brother's arms and
seize it, and that I and Avicia would draw him up to safety; I know
that in one vivid flash of lightning I saw the struggling forms and
the beautiful white spray of the waves; I know that Silvain's voice
grew fainter and fainter until it was heard no more; I know that there
was the sound of a heavy body or bodies falling into the sea, that a
shriek of woe and despair clove my heart like a knife, and that Avicia
lay in my arms moaning and trembling.I bore her tenderly into her
room, and laid her on her bed."The storm ceased; no sound was heard without.The rising sun filled
the eastern horizon with loveliest hues of saffron and crimson.The
sea was calm; there was no trace of tempest and human agony.By that
time Avicia was a mother, and lay with her babes pressed to her bosom.Silvain's fear was realised: he was the dead father of twin brothers."The assistant whom Avicia's father had engaged rowed me to the
village, and there I enlisted the services of a woman, who accompanied
me back to the lighthouse, and attended to Avicia.The mother lived
but two days after the birth of her babes.Until her last hour she was
delirious, but then she recovered her senses and recognised me."'My dear Silvain told me,' she said, in a weak, faint voice, 'that
you would be a friend to our children.Bless the few moments remaining
to me by assuring me that you will not desert them.'"I gave her the assurance for which she yearned, and she desired me to
call them by the names of Eric and Emilius.It rejoiced me that she
passed away in peace; strange as it may seem, it was an inexpressible
relief to her bruised heart that the long agony was over.Her last
words were,

"'I trust you."And so, with her nerveless hand in mine, her spirit went out to her
lover and husband."We buried her in the village churchyard, and the day was observed as
a day of mourning in that village by the sea."I thought I could not do better than leave the twin babes for a time
in the charge of the woman I had engaged, and it occurred to me that
it might not be unprofitable to have some inquiries and investigation
made with respect to the inheritance left by their grandfather to his
sons Kristel and Silvain.I placed the matter in the hands of a shrewd
lawyer, and he was enabled to recover a portion of what was due to
their father.This was a great satisfaction to me, as it to some
extent provided for the future of Eric and Emilius, and supplied the
wherewithal for their education.It was my intention, when they
arrived at a certain age, to bring them to my home in Nerac, and treat
them as children of my own, but a difficulty cropped up for which I
was not prepared and which I could not surmount.Avicia's father,
learning that I had recovered a portion of Silvain's inheritance,
demanded from me an account of it, and asserted his rights as the
natural guardian of his grandchildren.There was no gainsaying the
demand, and I was compelled reluctantly to leave Eric and Emilius in
his charge.I succeeded, however, in prevailing upon him to allow them
to pay me regular visits of long duration, so that a close intimacy of
affectionate friendship has been established between them and the
members of my family.Here ends my story--a strange and eventful one,
you will admit.I often think of it in wonder, and this is the first
time a full recital of it has passed my lips."Such a story, which Doctor Louis truly described as strange and
eventful, could not have failed to leave a deep impression upon me.During its recital I had, as it were, been charmed out of myself.My
instinctive distrust of the twin brothers Eric and Emilius, the growth
of a groundless jealousy, was for a while forgotten, and at the
conclusion of the recital I was lost in the contemplation of the
tragic pictures which had been presented to my mind's eye.Singularly
enough, the most startling bit of colour in these pictures, that of
the two brothers in their life and death struggle on the outer walls
of the lighthouse, was not to me the dominant feature of the
remarkable story.The awful, unnatural contest, Avicias agony,
Silvain's soul-moving appeals, and the dread silence of Kristel--all
this was as nought in comparison with the figure of a solitary man
standing on the seashore, gazing in the direction of his lost
happiness.I traced his life back through the years during which he
was engaged in his relentless pursuit of the brother who had brought
desolation into his life.In him, and in him alone, was centred the
true pathos of the story; it was he who had been robbed, it was he who
had been wronged.No deliberate act of treachery lay at his door; he
loved, and had been deceived.Those in whom he placed his trust had
deliberately betrayed him.The vengeance he sought and consummated was
just.I did not make Doctor Louis acquainted with my views on the subject,
knowing that he would not agree with me, and that all his sympathies
were bestowed upon Silvain.There was something of cowardice in this
concealment of my feelings, but although I experienced twinges of
conscience for my want of courage, it was not difficult for me to
justify myself in my own eyes.Doctor Louis was the father of the
woman I loved, and in his hands lay my happiness.On no account must I
instil doubt into his mind; he was a man of decided opinions,
dogmatic, and strong-willed.No act or word of mine must cause him to
have the least distrust of me.Therefore I played the cunning part,
and was silent with respect to those threads in the story which
possessed the firmest hold upon his affections.This enforced silence accentuated and strengthened my view.Silvain
and Avicia were weak, feeble creatures.The man of great heart and
resolute will, the man whose sufferings and wrongs made him a martyr,
was Kristel.Trustful, heroic,
unflinching.But he and his brother, and the woman
who had been the instrument of their fate, belonged to the past.They
were dead and gone, and in the presence of Doctor Louis I put them
aside a while.Time enough to think of them when I was alone.They lived, and between their
lives and mine there was a link.Of this I entertained no doubt, nor
did I doubt that, in this connection, the future would not be
colourless for us.To be prepared for the course which events might
take: this was now my task and my duty."As Kristel acted, so would I act, in love and hate."I observed Doctor Louis's eyes fixed earnestly upon my face."Is not such a story," I said evasively, "enough to agitate one?Its
movements are as the movements of a sublime tragedy.""True," mused Doctor Louis; "even in obscure lives may be found such
elements.""You have told me little," I said, "of Eric and Emilius.Do they
reside permanently in the lighthouse in which their mother died?""They have a house in the village by the sea," replied Doctor Louis,
"and they are in a certain sense fishermen on a large scale.The place
has possessed for them a fascination, and it seemed as if they would
never be able to tear themselves away from it.But their intimate
association with it will soon be at an end.""They have sold their house and boats, and are coming to reside in
Nerac for a time."I started and turned aside, for I did not wish Doctor Louis to see the
cloud upon my face."It depends upon circumstances," said Doctor Louis."If they are happy
and contented in the present and in their prospects in the future,
they will remain.We have talked of it
often, and I have urged them not to waste their lives in a village so
small and primitive as that in which they were born.""Somewhat destructive of your own theories of happiness, doctor," I
observed."Yourself, for instance, wasting your life in a small place
like Nerac, when by your gifts you are so well fitted to play your
part in a large city.""I am selfish, I am afraid," he said with a deprecatory smile, "and am
too much wrapped up in my own ease and comfort.At the same time you
must bear in mind that mine is an exceptional case.It is a regretful
thing to be compelled to say that the majority of lives and homes are
less happy than my own.Often there is love, and poverty stands at the
bright door which opens but on a scene of privation and ill-requited
toil.Often there is wealth, in the use of which there has been an
endeavour to purchase love, which, my friend, is not a marketable
commodity.Often there are sorrow and sickness, and neither faith nor
patience to lighten the load.It is my good fortune to have none of
these ills.We have love and good health, and a sufficient share of
worldly prosperity to provide for our days.Therefore I will leave
myself out of the question.he cried, interrupting himself in a
tone at once light and earnest; "am I entirely useless in Nerac?"You do much," I said, "and also do Eric and Emilius in their village.You have admitted that they are fishermen on a large scale, and
possess boats.Consequently they employ labour, and the wages they pay
support the homes of those who serve them.""With some young men," said Doctor Louis, with a good-humoured laugh,
"there is no arguing.They are so keen in defence that they have a
formidable parry for every thrust.To the point, then, without
argument.Eric and Emilius have in them certain qualities which render
me doubtful whether, as middle-aged men, they would be in their proper
sphere in their village by the sea.The maidens there find no serious
favour in their eyes.""Do they look," I asked, with a torturing pang of jealousy, "with a
more appreciative eye upon the maidens in Nerac?""Tush, tush," said Doctor Louis, in a kind tone, laying his hand upon
my shoulder; "vex not yourself unnecessarily.Youth's hot blood is a
torrent, restless by day and night, never satisfied, never content,
for ever seeking cause to fret and fume.You have given evidence of
wisdom, Gabriel--exercise it when it is most needed."Of all the maidens in Nerac," I said, striving to speak with
calmness, "Lauretta is the fairest and sweetest."I, her father, will not gainsay you.""Is it because she is fairer and sweeter than any Eric and Emilius
have seen in the village by the sea that they quit their home there,
and come to live in Nerac?"Were I simply an ordinary friend of yours, and not
Lauretta's father, I might feel inclined to play with you; but as
it is, my happiness here is too largely at stake.Viewing with a selfish eye--a human failing, common
enough--your own immediate affairs, forget not that I, Lauretta's
father, am as deeply concerned in them as yourself.Never would I be
guilty of the crime of forcing my child's affections.Do you think I
love her less than you do?If it should be your happy fate to be a
father, you will learn how much purer and higher is the love of a
father than that which a young man, after an hour's acquaintance,
bears for the maiden whom he would wed.""It cannot be said to be more," responded Doctor Louis gravely,
"compared with my knowledge of my child."The retort was well-merited, and I murmured, "Forgive me!"The
consistently sweet accents of Doctor Louis's voice produced in me, at
this moment, a feeling of self-reproach, and a true sense of my
petulance and imperiousness forced itself upon me."There is little need to ask forgiveness," said Doctor Louis; "I can
make full allowance for the impetuous passions of youth, and if I wish
you to place a curb upon them it is for your welfare and that of my
child.Indulgence in such extravagances leads to injustice.Gabriel, I
will be entirely frank with you.Before your arrival in Nerac I had a
slight suspicion that one of the brothers--towards both of whom I feel
as a father--had an affection for Lauretta which might have ripened
into love.It is in the nature of things that a beautiful girl should
inspire a sentiment in the breasts of more than one man, but she can
belong only to one, to him to whom her heart is drawn.What passed
between us when you spoke to me as a lover of my daughter was honest
and outspoken.The encouragement you received from me would have been
withheld had it not been that I saw you occupied a place in Lauretta's
heart, and that the one end and aim I have in view is her happiness.""Is it too much to ask," I said, "to which of the brothers you
referred?""Altogether too much," replied Doctor Louis."It is an unrevealed
secret, and the right is not mine to say more than I have said."I did not speak for a little while; I was the slave of conflicting
passions.One moment I believed entirely in Doctor Louis; another
moment I doubted him; and through all I was oppressed by a
consciousness that I was doing him an injustice."Nothing special, sir," was my
reply, "but in a general way.""Born under such singular circumstances, and of such a father as
Silvain, it would not be unnatural to suppose that they might inherit
some touch of his strangely sympathetic nature.""They have inherited it," said Doctor Louis; "there exists between
them a sympathy as strange as that which existed in Silvain.I am at
liberty to say nothing more."He spoke in a firm tone, and I did not question him further.As I
accompanied him home we conversed upon general subjects, and I took
pains to convey to him an assurance that there was nothing really
serious in the ungracious temper I had displayed.He was relieved at
this, and we fell into our old confidential manner with each other.I passed the evening, as usual, in the society of his wife and
Lauretta.Peace descended upon me, and in the sweet presence of these
pure women I was tranquil and happy.How lovely, how beautiful was
this home of love and tender thought!The wild storms of life died
away, and strains of soft, angelic music melted the heart, and made
themselves heard even in the midst of the silences.Doctor Louis's
gaiety returned to him; he smiled upon me, and indulged in many a
harmless jest.I was charmed out of my moody humour, and contributed
to the innocent enjoyment of the home circle.The hours passed till it
was near bed-time, and then it was that a change came over me.Sitting
by Lauretta's side, turning the pages of an illustrated book of
travel, I heard the names of Eric and Emilius spoken by Doctor Louis.He was telling his wife of the impending change in their mode of life,
and there was an affectionate note in his voice, and also in hers,
which jarred upon me.I started to my feet, and they all turned to me
in surprise.I recovered myself in a moment, and explained that I had
suddenly thought of something which rendered it necessary that I
should go at once to the house I had taken, and of which Martin Hartog
was at present the sole custodian."But you were not to leave us till the end of the week," expostulated
Lauretta's mother."Indeed it is," I replied, "and should have been attended to earlier."You need have no anxiety; everything is prepared, and I
shall be quite comfortable.""My wife is thinking of the sheets," observed Doctor Louis jocosely;
"whether they are properly aired.""I have seen to that," she said, "and there is a fire in every room.""Then we can safely let him go," rejoined Doctor Louis."He is old
enough to take care of himself, and, besides, he is now a householder,
and has duties.We shall see you to-morrow, Gabriel?""Yes, I shall be here in the morning."So I wished them good-night, and presently was out in the open,
walking through dark shadows.In solitude I reviewed with amazement the occurrences of the last few
moments.It seemed to me that I had been impelled to do what I had
done by an occult agency outside myself.Not that I did not approve of
it.It was in accordance with my intense wish and desire--which had
lain dormant in the sweet society of Lauretta--to be alone, in order
that I might, without interruption, think over the story I had heard
from Doctor Louis's lips.And now that this wish and desire were
gratified, the one figure which still rose vividly before me was the
figure of Kristel.As I walked onward I followed the hapless man
mentally in his just pursuit of the brother who had snatched the cup
of happiness from his lips.Yes, it was just and right, and what he
did I would have done under similar circumstances.Of all who had
taken part in the tragic drama he, and he alone, commanded my
sympathy.The distance from Doctor Louis's house to mine was under two miles,
but I prolonged it by a _detour_ which brought me, without
premeditation, to the inn known as the Three Black Crows.I had no
intention of going there or of entering the inn, and yet, finding
myself at the door, I pushed it open, and walked into the room in
which the customers took their wine.This room was furnished with
rough tables and benches, and I seated myself, and in response to the
landlord's inquiry, ordered a bottle of his best, and invited him to
share it with me.He, nothing loth, accepted the invitation, and sat
at the table, emptying his glass, which I continued to fill for him,
while my own remained untasted.I had been inside the Three Black
Crows on only one occasion, in the company of Doctor Louis, and the
landlord now expressed his gratitude for the honour I did him by
paying him another visit.It was only the sense of his words which
reached my ears, my attention being almost entirely drawn to two men
who were seated at a table at the end of the room, drinking bad wine
and whispering to each other.Observing my eyes upon them, the
landlord said in a low tone, "Strangers."Their backs were towards me, and I could not see their faces, but I
noticed that one was humpbacked, and that, to judge from their attire,
they were poor peasants."I asked them," said the landlord, "whether they wanted a bed, and
they answered no, that they were going further.If they had stopped
here the night I should have kept watch on them!""I don't like their looks, and my wife's a timorous creature.Then
there's the children--you've seen my little ones, I think, sir?"Surely those men would do them no harm!""Perhaps not, sir; but a man, loving those near to him, thinks of the
possibilities of things.I've got a bit of money in the house, to pay
my rent that's due to-morrow, and one or two other accounts."Do you think they have come to Nerac on a robbing expedition?"Roguery has a plain face, and the signs are in
theirs, or my name's not what it is.When they said they were going
further on I asked them where, and they said it was no business of
mine.They gave me the same answer when I asked them where they came
from.They're up to no good, that's certain, and the sooner they're
out of the village the better for all of us."The more the worthy landlord talked the more settled became his
instinctive conviction that the strangers were rogues."If robbery is their errand," I said thoughtfully, "there are houses
in Nerac which would yield them a better harvest than yours.""Of course there is," was his response.He
has generally some money about him, and his silver plate would be a
prize.Are you going back there to-night, sir?""No; I am on my road to my own house, and I came out of the way a
little for the sake of the walk.""That's my profit, sir," said the landlord cheerfully."I would offer
to keep you company if it were not that I don't like to leave my
place.""There's nothing to fear," I said; "if they molest me I shall be a
match for them.""Still," urged the landlord, "I should leave before they do.It's as
well to avoid a difficulty when we have the opportunity."I took the hint, and paid my score.To all appearance there was no
reason for alarm on my part; during the time the landlord and I were
conversing the strangers had not turned in our direction, and as we
spoke in low tones they could not have heard what we said.They
remained in the same position, with their backs towards us, now
drinking in silence, now speaking in whispers to each other.Outside the Three Black Crows I walked slowly on, but I had not gone
fifty yards before I stopped.What was in my mind was the reference
made by the landlord to Doctor Louis's house and to its being worth
the plundering.The doctor's house contained what was dearer to me
than life or fortune.Should I leave her at the
mercy of these scoundrels who might possibly have planned a robbery of
the doctor's money and plate?In that case Lauretta would be in
danger.I would return to the Three
Black Crows, and look through the window of the room in which I had
left the men, to ascertain whether they were still there.If they
were, I would wait for them till they left the inn, and then would set
a watch upon their movements.If they were gone I would hasten to the
doctor's house, to render assistance, should any be needed.I had no
weapon, with the exception of a small knife; could I not provide
myself with something more formidable?A few paces from where I stood
were some trees with stout branches.I detached one of these branches,
and with my small knife fashioned it into a weapon which would serve
my purpose.It was about four feet in length, thick at the striking
end and tapering towards the other, so that it could be held with ease
and used to good purpose.I tried it on the air, swinging it round and
bringing it down with sufficient force to kill a man, or with
certainty to knock the senses out of him in one blow.Then I returned
to the inn, and looked through the window.In the settlement of my
proceedings I had remembered there was a red blind over the window
which did not entirely cover it, and through the uncovered space I now
saw the strangers sitting at the table as I had left them.Taking care to make no noise I stepped away from the window, and took
up a position from which I could see the door of the inn, which was
closed.I myself was in complete darkness, and there was no moon to
betray me; all that was needed from me was caution.I watched fully half an hour before the door of the inn was opened.No
person had entered during my watch, the inhabitants of Nerac being
early folk for rest and work.The two strangers lingered for a moment
upon the threshold, peering out into the night; behind them was the
landlord, with a candle in his hand.I did not observe that any words
passed between them and the landlord; they stepped into the road, and
the door was closed upon them.Then came the sounds of locking and
bolting doors and windows.I saw the faces of the men as they stood upon the threshold; they were
evil-looking fellows enough, and their clothes were of the commonest.For two or three minutes they did not stir; there had been nothing in
their manner to arouse suspicion, and the fact of their lingering on
the roadway seemed to denote that they were uncertain of the route
they should take.That they raised their faces to the sky was not
against them; it was a natural seeking for light to guide them.To the left lay the little nest of buildings amongst which were Father
Daniel's chapel and modest house, and the more pretentious dwelling of
Doctor Louis; to the right were the woods, at the entrance of which my
own house was situated.The left,
and it was part evidence of a guilty design.The right, and it would
be part proof that the landlord's suspicions were baseless.They exchanged a few words which did not reach my ears.Then they
moved onwards to the left.I grasped my weapon, and crept after them.But they walked only a dozen steps, and paused.In my mind
was the thought, "Continue the route you have commenced, and you are
dead men.The direction of the village was the more tempting to men who
had no roof to shelter them, for the reason that in Father Daniel's
chapel--which, built on an eminence, overlooked the village--lights
were visible from the spot upon which I and they were standing.There
was the chance of a straw bed and charity's helping hand, never
withheld by the good priest from the poor and wretched.On their right
was dense darkness; not a glimmer of light.Nevertheless, after the exchange of a few more words which, like the
others, were unheard by me, they seemed to resolve to seek the
gloomier way.They turned from the village, and facing me, walked past
me in the direction of the woods.I breathed more freely, and fell into a curious mental consideration
of the relief I experienced.Was it because, walking as they were from
the village in which Lauretta was sleeping, I was spared the taking of
these men's lives?It was because of the indication they afforded
me that Lauretta was not in peril.In her defence I could have
justified the taking of a hundred lives.No feeling of guilt would
have haunted me; there would have been not only no remorse but no pity
in my soul.The violation of the most sacred of human laws would be
justified where Lauretta was concerned.She was mine, to cherish, to
protect, to love--mine, inalienably.She belonged to no other man, and
none should step between her and me--neither he whose ruffianly design
threatened her with possible harm, nor he, in a higher and more
polished grade, who strove to win her affections and wrest them from
me.In an equal way both were equally my enemies, and I should be
justified in acting by them as Kristel had acted to Silvain.Ah, but he had left it too late.Not so would I. Let but the faintest
breath of certainty wait upon suspicion, and I would scotch it
effectually for once and all.Had Kristel possessed the strange power
in his hours of dreaming which Silvain possessed, he would not have
been robbed of the happiness which was his by right.He would have
been forewarned, and Avicia would have been his wife.In every step in
life he took there would have been the fragrance of flowers around
him, and a heavenly light.Did I, then, admit that there was any resemblance in the characters of
Avicia and Lauretta?No; one was a weed, the other a rose.Here low desire and cunning; there
angelic purity and goodness.But immeasurably beneath Lauretta as
Avicia was, Kristel's love for the girl would have made her radiant
and spotless.All this time I was stealthily following the strangers to the woods.The sound arrested them; they clutched each other in
fear.I stood motionless, and they stood without movement for many moments.Then they simultaneously emitted a deep-drawn sigh."It was the wind," said the man who had already spoken.I smiled in contempt; not a breath of wind was stirring; there was not
the flutter of a leaf, not the waving of the lightest branch.They resumed their course, and I crept after them noiselessly.They
entered the wood; the trees grew more thickly clustered."This will do," I heard one say; and upon the words they threw
themselves to the ground, and fell into slumber.I bent over them and was
satisfied.The landlord of the Three Black Crows was mistaken.I moved
softly away, and when I was at a safe distance from them I lit a match
and looked at my watch; it was twenty minutes to eleven, and before
the minute-hand had passed the hour I arrived at my house.The door
was fast, but I saw a light in the lower room of the gardener's
cottage, which I had given to Martin Hartog as a residence for him and
his daughter."Hartog is awake," I thought; "expecting me perhaps."I knocked at the door of the cottage, and received no answer; I
knocked again with the same result.The door had fastenings of lock and latch.I put my hand to the latch,
and finding that the key had not been turned in the lock, opened the
door and entered.The room, however, was not without an occupant.At the table sat a
young girl, the gardener's daughter, asleep.She lay back in her
chair, and the light shone upon her face.I had seen her when she was
awake, and knew that she was beautiful, but as I gazed now upon her
sleeping form I was surprised to discover that she was even fairer
than I had supposed.She had hair of dark brown, which curled most
gracefully about her brow and head; her face, in its repose, was sweet
to look upon; she was not dressed as the daughter of a labouring man,
but with a certain daintiness and taste which deepened my surprise;
there was lace at her sleeves and around her white neck.Had I not
known her station I should have taken her for a lady.She was young,
not more than eighteen or nineteen I judged, and life's springtime lay
sweetly upon her.There was a smile of wistful tenderness on her lips.Her left arm was extended over the table, and her hand rested upon the
portrait of a man, almost concealing the features.Her right hand,
which was on her lap, enfolded a letter, and that and the
portrait--which, without curious prying, I saw was not that of her
father--doubtless were the motive of a pleasant dream.I took in all this in a momentary glance, and quickly left the room,
closing the door behind me.Then I knocked loudly and roughly, and
heard the hurried movements of a sudden awaking.She came to the door
and cried softly, "Is that you, father?She opened the door, and fell back a step in confusion."I should have let your father know," I said, "that I intended to
sleep here to-night--but indeed it was a hasty decision."Oh, no, sir," she said.Father is away on
business; I expected him home earlier, and waiting for him I fell
asleep.The servants are not coming till to-morrow morning."She gave them to me, and asked if she could do anything for me.I
answered no, that there was nothing required.As I wished her
good-night a man's firm steps were heard, and Martin Hartog appeared.He cast swift glances at his daughter and me, and it struck me that
they were not devoid of suspicion.I explained matters, and he
appeared contented with my explanation; then bidding his daughter go
indoors he accompanied me to the house.There was a fire in my bedroom, almost burnt out, and the handiwork of
an affectionate and capable housewife was everywhere apparent.Martin
Hartog showed an inclination then and there to enter into particulars
of the work he had done in the grounds during my absence, but I told
him I was tired, and dismissed him.I listened to his retreating
footsteps, and when I heard the front door closed I blew out the
candle and sat before the dying embers in the grate.Darkness was best
suited to my mood, and I sat and mused upon the events of the last
forty-eight hours.Gradually my thoughts became fixed upon the figures
of the two strangers I had left sleeping in the woods, in connection
with the suspicion of their designs which the landlord had imparted to
me.So concentrated was my attention that I re-enacted all the
incidents of which they were the inspirers--the fashioning of the
branch into a weapon, the watch I had set upon them, their issuing
from the inn, the landlord standing behind with the candle in his
hand, their lingering in the road, the first steps they took towards
the village, their turning back, and my stealthy pursuit after
them--not the smallest detail was omitted.I do not remember
undressing and going to bed.Encompassed by silence and darkness I was
only spiritually awake.I was aroused at about eight o'clock in the morning by the arrival of
the servants of the household whom Lauretta's mother had engaged for
me, They comprised a housekeeper, who was to cook and generally
superintend, and two stout wenches to do the rougher work.In such a
village as Nerac these, in addition to Martin Hartog, constituted an
establishment of importance.They had been so well schooled by Lauretta's mother before commencing
the active duties of their service, that when I rose I found the
breakfast-table spread, and the housekeeper in attendance to receive
my orders.This augured well, and I experienced a feeling of
satisfaction at the prospect of the happy life before me.Lauretta would be not only a sweet and loving
companion, but the same order and regularity would reign in our home
as in the home of her childhood.I blessed the chance, if chance it
was, which had led me to Nerac, and as I paced the room and thought of
Lauretta, I said audibly, "Thank God!"Breakfast over, I strolled into the grounds, and made a careful
inspection of the work which Martin Hartog had performed.The
conspicuous conscientiousness of his labours added to my satisfaction,
and I gave expression to it.He received my approval in manly fashion,
and said he would be glad if I always spoke my mind, "as I always
speak mine," he added.It pleased me that he was not subservient; in
all conditions of life a man owes it to himself to maintain, within
proper bounds, a spirit of independence.While he was pointing out to
me this and that, and urging me to make any suggestions which occurred
to me, his daughter came up to us and said that a man wished to speak
to me.I asked who the man was, and she replied, "The landlord of the
Three Black Crows."Curious as to his purpose in making so early a
call, and settling it with myself that his errand was on business, in
connection, perhaps, with some wine he wished to dispose of, I told
the young woman to send him to me, and presently he appeared.There
was an expression of awkwardness, I thought, in his face as he stood
before me, cap in hand."Well, landlord," I said smiling; "you wish to see me?""Go on," I said, wondering somewhat at his hesitation."Can I speak to you alone, sir?"Hartog, I will see you again presently."Martin Hartog took the hint, and left us together."It's about those two men, sir, you saw in my place last night."I said, pondering, and then a light broke upon me,
and I thought it singular--as indeed it was--that no recollection,
either of the men or the incidents in association with them should
have occurred to me since my awaking."_You_ are quite safe, sir," said the landlord, "I am glad to find.""Quite safe, landlord; but why should you be so specially glad?""That's what brought me round so early this morning, for one thing; I
was afraid something _might_ have happened.""Kindly explain yourself," I said, not at all impatient, but amused
rather."Well, sir, they might have found out, somehow or other, that you were
sleeping in the house alone last night"--and here he broke off and
asked, "You _did_ sleep here alone last night?""Certainly I did, and a capital night's rest I had."As I was saying, if they had found out that
you were sleeping here alone, they might have taken it into their
heads to trouble you.""They might, landlord, but facts are stubborn things."I understand that now, sir, but I had my fears, and that's what
brought me round for one thing.""An expression you have used once before, landlord.I
infer there must be another thing in your mind.""As yet I have heard nothing but a number of very enigmatical
observations from you with respect to those men.Ah, yes, I remember;
you had your doubts of them when I visited you on my road home?""I had sir; I told you I didn't like the looks of them, and that I was
not easy in my mind about my own family, and the bit of money I had in
my place to pay my rent with, and one or two other accounts.""That is so; you are bringing the whole affair back to me.I saw the
men after I left the Three Black Crows.""To tell you would be to interrupt what you have come here to say."Well, sir, this is the way of it.I suspected them from the first,
and you will bear witness of it before the magistrate.They were
strangers in Nerac, but that is no reason why I should have refused to
sell them a bottle of red wine when they asked for it.It's my trade
to supply customers, and the wine was the worst I had, consequently
the cheapest.I had no right to ask their business, and if they chose
to answer me uncivilly, it was their affair.I wouldn't tell everybody
mine on the asking.They paid for the wine, and there was an end of
it.They called for another bottle, and when I brought it I did not
draw the cork till I had the money for it, and as they wouldn't pay
the price--not having it about 'em--the cork wasn't drawn, and the
bottle went back.I had trouble to get rid of them, but they stumbled
out at last, and I saw no more of them.Now, sir, you will remember
that when we were speaking of them Doctor Louis's house was mentioned
as a likely house for rogues to break into and rob.""The villains couldn't hear what we said, no more than we could hear
what they were whispering about.But they had laid their plans, and
tried to hatch them--worse luck for one, if not for both the
scoundrels; but the other will be caught and made to pay for it.What
they did between the time they left the Three Black Crows and the time
they made an attempt to break into Doctor Louis's is at present a
mystery.Don't be alarmed, sir; I see that my news has stirred you,
but they have only done harm to themselves.No one else is a bit the
worse for their roguery.Doctor Louis and his good wife and daughter
slept through the night undisturbed; nothing occurred to rouse or
alarm them.They got up as usual, the doctor being the first--he is
known as an early riser.As it happened, it was fortunate that he was
outside his house before his lady, for although we in Nerac have an
idea that she is as brave as she is good, a woman, after all, is only
a woman, and the sight of blood is what few of them can stand."But that I was assured that
Lauretta was safe and well, I should not have wasted a moment on the
landlord, eager as I was to learn what he had come to tell.My mind,
however, was quite at ease with respect to my dear girl, and the next
few minutes were not so precious that I could not spare them to hear
the landlord's strange story."That," he resumed, "is what the doctor saw when he went to the back
of his house.Blood on the ground--and what is more, what would have
given the ladies a greater shock, there before him was the body of a
man--dead.""That I can't for a certainty say, sir, because I haven't seen him as
yet.I'm telling the story second-hand, as it was told to me a while
ago by one who had come straight from the doctor's house.There was
the blood, and there the man; and from the description I should say it
was one of the men who were drinking in my place last night.It is not
ascertained at what time of the night he and his mate tried to break
into the doctor's house, but the attempt was made.They commenced to bore a hole in one of the shutters
at the back; the hole made, it would have been easy to enlargen it,
and so to draw the fastenings.However, they did not get so far as
that.They could scarcely have been at their scoundrelly work a minute
or two before it came to an end.""How and by whom were they interrupted, landlord?"It is not known, sir, and it's just at this point that the mystery
commences.There they are at their work, and likely to be successful.A dark night, and not a watchman in the village.Never a need for one,
sir.Plenty of time before them, and desperate men they.Only one man
in the house, the good doctor; all the others women, easily dealt
with.Robbery first--if interfered with, murder afterwards.They
wouldn't have stuck at it, not they!But there it was, sir, as God
willed.Not a minute at work, and something occurs.The man lies dead on the ground, with a gimlet in his hand, and
Doctor Louis, in full sunlight, stands looking down on the strange
sight.""The man lies dead on the ground," I said, repeating the landlord's
words; "but there were two.""No sign of the other, sir; he's a vanished body."He will be found," I said----

"It's to be hoped," interrupted the landlord."And then what you call a mystery will be solved.""It's beyond me, sir," said the landlord, with a puzzled air.These two scoundrels, would-be murderers, plan a
robbery, and proceed to execute it.They are ill-conditioned
creatures, no better than savages, swayed by their passions, in which
there is no show of reason.They quarrel, perhaps, about the share of
the spoil which each shall take, and are not wise enough to put aside
their quarrel till they are in possession of the booty.They continue
their dispute, and in such savages their brutal passions once roused,
swell and grow to a fitting climax of violence.Probably the disagreement commenced on their way to the house, and had
reached an angry point when one began to bore a hole in the shutter.The proof was in his hand--the
gimlet with which he was working.""Well conceived, sir," said the landlord, following with approval my
speculative explanation."This man's face," I continued, "would be turned toward the shutter,
his back to his comrade.Into this comrade's mind darts, like a
lightning flash, the idea of committing the robbery alone, and so
becoming the sole possessor of the treasure.""Good, sir, good," said the landlord, rubbing his hands.Out comes his knife, or perhaps he
has it ready in his hand, opened.""No; such men carry clasp-knives.They are safest, and never attract
notice.""You miss nothing, sir," said the landlord admiringly."What a
magistrate you would have made!""He plunges it into his fellow-scoundrel's back, who falls dead, with
the gimlet in his hand.The landlord nodded excitedly, and continued to rub his hands; then
suddenly stood quite still, with an incredulous expression on his
face."But the robbery is not committed," he exclaimed; "the house is not
broken into, and the scoundrel gets nothing for his pains."With superior wisdom I laid a patronising hand upon his shoulder."The deed done," I said, "the murderer, gazing upon his dead comrade,
is overcome with fear.He has been rash--he may be caught red-handed;
the execution of the robbery will take time.He is not familiar with
the habits of the village, and does not know it has no guardians of
the night.He has not only committed murder, he has robbed himself.Better
to have waited till they had possession of the treasure; but this kind
of logic always comes afterwards to ill-regulated minds.Under the
influence of his newly-born fears he recognises that every moment is
precious; he dare not linger; he dare not carry out the scheme.Shuddering, he flies from the spot, with rage and despair in his
heart.The landlord, who was profuse in the expressions of his admiration at
the light I had thrown upon the case, so far as it was known to us,
accompanied me to the house of Doctor Louis.It was natural that I
should find Lauretta and her mother in a state of agitation, and it
was sweet to me to learn that it was partly caused by their anxieties
for my safety.Doctor Louis was not at home, but had sent a messenger
to my house to inquire after me, and to give me some brief account of
the occurrences of the night.We did not meet this messenger on our
way to the doctor's; he must have taken a different route from ours."You did wrong to leave us last night," said Lauretta's mother
chidingly.I shook my head, and answered that it was but anticipating the date of
my removal by a few days, and that my presence in her house would not
have altered matters."Everything was right at home," I said.What inexpressible
sweetness there was in the word!"Martin Hartog showed me to my room,
and the servants you engaged came early this morning, and attended to
me as though they had known my ways and tastes for years.""A dreamless night," I replied; "but had I suspected what was going on
here, I should not have been able to rest.""I am glad you had no suspicion, Gabriel; you would have been in
danger.Dreadful as it all is, it is a comfort to know that the
misguided men do not belong to our village."Her merciful heart could find no harsher term than this to apply to
the monsters, and it pained her to hear me say, "One has met his
deserved fate; it is a pity the other has escaped."But I could not
keep back the words.Doctor Louis had left a message for me to follow him to the office of
the village magistrate, where the affair was being investigated, but
previous to going thither, I went to the back of the premises to make
an inspection.The village boasted of one constable, and he was now on
duty, in a state of stupefaction.His orders were to allow nothing to
be disturbed, but his bewilderment was such that it would have been
easy for an interested person to do as he pleased in the way of
alteration.A stupid lout, with as much intelligence as a vegetable.However, I saw at once that nothing had been disturbed.The shutter in
which a hole had been bored was closed; there were blood stains on the
stones, and I was surprised that they were so few; the gate by which
the villains had effected an entrance into the garden was open; I
observed some particles of sawdust on the window-ledge just below
where the hole had been bored.All that had been removed was the body
of the man who had been murdered by his comrade.I put two or three questions to the constable, and he managed to
answer in monosyllables, yes and no, at random."A valuable
assistant," I thought, "in unravelling a mysterious case!"And then I
reproached myself for the sneer.Happy was a village like Nerac in
which crime was so rare, and in which an official so stupid was
sufficient for the execution of the law.The first few stains of blood I noticed were close to the window, and
the stones thereabout had been disturbed, as though by the falling of
a heavy body."Was the man's body," I inquired of the constable, "lifted from this
spot?"He looked down vacantly and said, "Yes.""Sure," he said after a pause, but whether the word was spoken in
reply to my question, or as a question he put to himself, I could not
determine.From the open gate to the
window was a distance of forty-eight yards; I stepped exactly a yard,
and I counted my steps.The path from gate to window was shaped like
the letter S, and was for the most part defined by tall shrubs on
either side, of a height varying from six to nine feet.Through this
path the villains had made their way to the window; through this path
the murderer, leaving his comrade dead, had made his escape.Their
operations, for their own safety's sake, must undoubtedly have been
conducted while the night was still dark.Reasonable also to conclude
that, being strangers in the village (although by some means they must
have known beforehand that Doctor Louis's house was worth the
plundering), they could not have been acquainted with the devious
turns in the path from the gate to the window.Therefore they must
have felt their way through, touching the shrubs with their hands,
most likely breaking some of the slender stalks, until they arrived at
the open space at the back of the building.These reflections impelled me to make a careful inspection of the
shrubs, and I was very soon startled by a discovery.Here and there
some stalks were broken and torn away, and here and there were
indisputable evidences that the shrubs had been grasped by human
hands.It was not this that startled me, for it was in accordance with
my own train of reasoning, but it was that there were stains of blood
on the broken stalks, especially upon those which had been roughly
torn from the parent tree.I seemed to see a man, with blood about
him, staggering blindly through the path, snatching at the shrubs both
for support and guidance, and the loose stalks falling from his hands
as he went.Two men entered the grounds, only one left--that one, the
murderer.Between
the victim and the perpetrator of the deed?In that case, what became
of the theory of action I had so elaborately described to the landlord
of the Three Black Crows?I had imagined an instantaneous impulse of
crime and its instantaneous execution.I had imagined a death as
sudden as it was violent, a deed from which the murderer had escaped
without the least injury to himself; and here, on both sides of me,
were the clearest proofs that the man who had fled must have been
grievously wounded.My ingenuity was at fault in the endeavour to
bring these signs into harmony with the course of events I had
invented in my interview with the landlord.I went straight to the office of the magistrate, a small building of
four rooms on the ground floor, the two in front being used as the
magistrate's private room and court, the two in the rear as cells, not
at all uncomfortable, for aggressors of the law.It was but rarely
that they were occupied.At the door of the court I encountered Father
Daniel.During his lifetime no such
crime had been perpetrated in the village, and his only comfort was
that the actors in it were strangers.But that did not lessen his
horror of the deed, and his large heart overflowed with pity both for
the guilty man and the victim.he said, in a voice broken by tears.Thrust before the Eternal Presence weighed down by sin!I
have been praying by his side for mercy, and for mercy upon his
murderer.I could not sympathise with his sentiments, and I told him so sternly.He made no attempt to convert me to his views, but simply said, "All
men should pray that they may never be tempted."And so he left me, and turned in the direction of his little chapel to
offer up prayers for the dead and the living sinners.Doctor Louis was with the magistrate; they had been discussing
theories, and had heard from the landlord of the Three Black Crows my
own ideas of the movements of the strangers on the previous night."In certain respects you may be right in your speculations," the
magistrate said; "but on one important point you are in error.""I have already discovered," I said, "that my theory is wrong, and not
in accordance with fact; but we will speak of that presently."As to the weapon with which the murder was done," replied the
magistrate, a shrewd man, whose judicial perceptions fitted him for a
larger sphere of duties than he was called upon to perform in Nerac."A club of some sort," said the magistrate, "with which the dead man
was suddenly attacked from behind.""No, but a search is being made for it and also for the murderer."There is no shadow of doubt that the
missing man is guilty.""There can be none," said the magistrate."And yet," urged Doctor Louis, in a gentle tone, "to condemn a man
unheard is repugnant to justice.""There are circumstances," said the magistrate, "which point so surely
to guilt that it would be inimical to justice to dispute them.By the
way," he continued, addressing me, "did not the landlord of the Three
Black Crows mention something to the effect that you were at his inn
last night after you left Dr.Louis's house, and that you and he had a
conversation respecting the strangers, who were at that time in the
same room as yourselves?""If he did," I said, "he stated what is correct.I was there, and saw
the strangers, of whom the landlord entertained suspicions which have
been proved to be well founded.""Then you will be able to identify the body, already," added the
magistrate, "identified by the landlord.Confirmatory evidence
strengthens a case.""I shall be able to identify it," I said.We went to the inner room, and I saw at a glance that it was one of
the strangers who had spent the evening at the Three Black Crows, and
whom I had afterwards watched and followed."The man who has escaped," I observed, "was hump backed.""That tallies with the landlord's statement," said the magistrate."I have something to relate," I said, upon our return to the court,
"of my own movements last night after I quitted the inn."I then gave the magistrate and Doctor Louis a circumstantial account
of my movements, without, however, entering into a description of my
thoughts, only in so far as they affected my determination to protect
the doctor and his family from evil designs.They listened with great interest, and Doctor Louis pressed my hand.He understood and approved of the solicitude I had experienced for the
safety of his household; it was a guarantee that I would watch over
his daughter with love and firmness and protect her from harm."But you ran a great risk, Gabriel," he said affectionately."I did not consider that," I said.The magistrate looked on and smiled; a father himself, he divined the
undivulged ties by which I and Doctor Louis were bound."At what time," he asked, "do you say you left the rogues asleep in
the woods?""It was twenty minutes to eleven," I replied, "and at eleven o'clock I
reached my house, and was received by Martin Hartog's daughter.Hartog
was absent, on business his daughter said, and while we were talking,
and I was taking the keys from her hands, Hartog came home, and
accompanied me to my bedroom.""Were you at all disturbed in your mind for the safety of your friends
in consequence of what had passed?"The men I left slumbering in the woods appeared to
me to be but ordinary tramps, without any special evil intent, and I
was satisfied and relieved.I could not have slept else; it is seldom
that I have enjoyed a better night."May not their slumbers have been feigned?"They were in a profound sleep; I made sure of that.No,
I could not have been mistaken.""It is strange," mused Doctor Louis, "how guilt can sleep, and can
forget the present and the future!"I then entered into an account of the inspection I had made of the
path from the gate to the window; it was the magistrate's opinion,
from the position in which the body was found, that there had been no
struggle between the two men, and here he and I were in agreement.What I now narrated materially weakened his opinion, as it had
materially weakened mine, and he was greatly perplexed.He was annoyed
also that the signs I had discovered, which confirmed the notion that
a struggle must have taken place, had escaped the attention of his
assistants.He himself had made but a cursory examination of the
grounds, his presence being necessary in the court to take the
evidence of witnesses, to receive reports, and to issue instructions."There are so many things to be considered," said Doctor Louis, "in a
case like this, resting as it does at present entirely upon
circumstantial evidence, that it is scarcely possible some should not
be lost sight of.Often those that are omitted are of greater weight
than those which are argued out laboriously and with infinite
patience.Justice is blind, but the law must be Argus-eyed.You
believe, Gabriel, that there must have been a struggle in my garden?""Such is now my belief," I replied."Such signs as you have brought before our notice," continued the
doctor, "are to you an indication that the man who escaped must have
met with severe treatment?""Therefore, that the struggle was a violent one?""Such a struggle could not have taken place without considerable
disarrangement about the spot in which it occurred.On an even
pavement you would not look for any displacement of the stones; the
utmost you could hope to discover would be the scratches made by iron
heels.But the path from the gate of my house to the back garden, and
all the walking spaces in the garden itself, are formed of loose
stones and gravel.No such struggle could take place there without
conspicuous displacement of the materials of which the ground is
composed.If it took place amongst the flowers, the beds would bear
evidence."Then did you observe such a disarrangement of the stones and gravel
as I consider would be necessary evidence of the struggle in which you
suppose these men to have been engaged?"I was compelled to admit--but I admitted it grudgingly and
reluctantly--that such a disarrangement had not come within my
observation."That is partially destructive of your theory," pursued the doctor."There is still something further of moment which I consider it my duty
to say.You are a sound sleeper ordinarily, and last night you slept
more soundly than usual.I, unfortunately, am a light sleeper, and it
is really a fact that last night I slept more lightly than usual.I
think, Gabriel, you were to some extent the cause of this.I am
affected by changes in my domestic arrangements; during many pleasant
weeks you have resided in our house, and last night was the first, for
a long time past, that you slept away from us.It had an influence
upon me; then, apart from your absence, I was thinking a great deal of
you."(Here I observed the magistrate smile again, a fatherly
benignant smile.)"As a rule I am awakened by the least noise--the
dripping of water, the fall of an inconsiderable object, the mewing of
a cat, the barking of a dog.Now, last night I was not disturbed,
unusually wakeful as I was.The wonder is that I was not aroused by
the boring of the hole in the shutter; the unfortunate wretch must
have used his gimlet very softly and warily, and under any
circumstances the sound produced by such a tool is of a light nature.But had any desperate struggle taken place in the garden it would have
aroused me to a certainty, and I should have hastened down to
ascertain the cause."Then," said the magistrate, "how do you account for the injuries the
man who escaped must have undoubtedly received?"The words were barely uttered when we all started to our feet.There
was a great scuffling outside, and cries and loud voices.The door was
pushed open and half-a-dozen men rushed into the room, guarding one
whose arms were bound by ropes.He was in a dreadful condition, and so
weak that, without support, he could not have kept his feet.I
recognised him instantly; he was the hump backed man I had seen in the
Three Black Crows.He lifted his eyes and they fell on the magistrate; from him they
wandered to Doctor Louis; from him they wandered to me.I was gazing
steadfastly and sternly upon him, and as his eyes met mine his head
drooped to his breast and hung there, while a strong shuddering ran
through him.The examination of the prisoner by the magistrate lasted but a very
short time, for the reason that no replies of any kind could be
obtained to the questions put to him.He maintained a dogged silence,
and although the magistrate impressed upon him that this silence was
in itself a strong proof of his guilt, and that if he had anything to
say in his defence it would be to his advantage to say it at once, not
a word could be extracted from him, and he was taken to his cell,
instructions being given that he should not be unbound and that a
strict watch should be kept over him.While the unsuccessful
examination was proceeding I observed the man two or three times raise
his eyes furtively to mine, or rather endeavour to raise them, for he
could not, for the hundredth part of a second, meet my stern gaze, and
each time he made the attempt it ended in his drooping his head with a
shudder.On other occasions I observed his eyes wandering round the
room in a wild, disordered way, and these proceedings, which to my
mind were the result of a low, premeditated cunning, led me to the
conclusion that he wished to convey the impression that he was not in
his right senses, and therefore not entirely responsible for his
crime.When the monster was taken away I spoke of this, and the
magistrate fell in with my views, and said that the assumption of
pretended insanity was not an uncommon trick on the part of criminals.I then asked him and Doctor Louis whether they would accompany me in a
search for the weapon with which the dreadful deed was committed (for
none had been found on the prisoner), and in a further examination of
the ground the man had traversed after he had killed his comrade in
guilt.Doctor Louis expressed his willingness, but the magistrate said
he had certain duties to attend to which would occupy him half an hour
or so, and that he would join us later on.So Doctor Louis and I
departed alone to continue the investigation I had already commenced.We began at the window at the back of the doctor's house, and I again
propounded to Doctor Louis my theory of the course of events, to which
he listened attentively, but was no more convinced than he had been
before that a struggle had taken place."But," he said, "whether a struggle for life did or did not take place
there is not the slightest doubt of the man's guilt, I have always
viewed circumstantial evidence with the greatest suspicion, but in
this instance I should have no hesitation, were I the monster's judge,
to mete out to him the punishment for his crime."Shortly afterwards we were joined by the magistrate who had news to
communicate to us."I have had," he said, "another interview with the prisoner, and have
succeeded in unlocking his tongue.I went to his cell, unaccompanied,
and again questioned him.To my surprise he asked me if I was alone.I
moved back a pace or two, having the idea that he had managed to
loosen the ropes by which he was bound, and that he wished to know if
I was alone for the purpose of attacking me.In a moment, however, the
fear was dispelled, for I saw that his arms were tightly and closely
bound to his side, and that it was out of his power to injure me.He
repeated his question, and I answered that I was quite alone, and that
his question was a foolish one, for he had the evidence of his senses
to convince him.He shook his head at this, and said in a strange
voice that the evidence of his senses was sufficient in the case of
men and women, but not in the case of spirits and demons.I smiled
inwardly at this--for it does not do for a magistrate to allow a
prisoner from whom he wishes to extract evidence to detect any signs
of levity in his judge--and I thought of the view you had presented to
me that the man wished to convey an impression that he was a madman,
in order to escape to some extent the consequences of the crime he had
committed.'Put spirits and demons,' I said to him, 'out of the
question.If you have anything to say or confess, speak at once; and
if you wish to convince yourself that there are no witnesses either in
this cell--though that is plainly evident--or outside, here is the
proof.'I threw open the door, and showed him that no one was
listening to our speech.'I cannot put spirits or demons out of the
question,' he said, 'because I am haunted by one, who has brought me
to this.'He looked down at his ropes and imprisoned limbs.'Are you
guilty or not guilty?''I am not guilty,' he replied; 'I did
not kill him.''Yes,' he replied, 'he is
murdered.''If you did not kill him,' I continued, 'who did?''A demon killed him,' he said, 'and would have
killed me, if I had not fled and played him a trick.'I gazed at him
in thought, wondering whether he had the slightest hope that he was
imposing upon me by his lame attempt at being out of his senses.'But,' I
said, and I admit that my tone was somewhat bantering, 'demons are
more powerful than mortals.''That is where it is,' he said; 'that is
why I am here.''You are a clumsy scoundrel,' I said, 'and I will
prove it to you; then you may be induced to speak the truth--in
which,' I added, 'lies your only hope of a mitigation of punishment.Not that I hold out to you any such hope; but if you can establish,
when you are ready to confess, that what you did was done in
self-defence, it will be a point in your favour.''I cannot confess,'
he said, 'to a crime which I did not commit.I am a clumsy scoundrel
perhaps, but not in the way you mean.'You
say,' I began, 'that a demon killed your comrade.''And,' I continued, 'that he would have killed you if
you had not fled from him.''But,' I
said, 'demons are more powerful than men.Of what avail would have
been your flight?Men can only walk or run; demons can fly.The demon
you have invented could have easily overtaken you and finished you as
you say he finished the man you murdered.'He was a little staggered
at this, and I saw him pondering over it.'It isn't for me,' he said
presently, 'to pretend to know why he did not suspect the trick I
played him; he could have killed me if he wanted.'There again,' I said, wondering that
there should be in the world men with such a low order of
intelligence, 'you heard him pursuing you.Demons glide noiselessly
along.It is impossible you could have heard this one.'I have invented none,' he persisted
doggedly, and repeated, 'I have spoken the truth.'As I could get
nothing further out of him than a determined adherence to his
ridiculous defence, I left him.""Do you think," asked Doctor Louis, "that he has any, even the
remotest belief in the story?"I cannot believe it," replied the magistrate, "and yet I confess to
being slightly puzzled.There was an air of sincerity about him which
might be to his advantage had he to deal with judges who were ignorant
of the cunning of criminals.""Which means," said Doctor Louis, "that it is really not impossible
that the man's mind is diseased.""No," said the magistrate, in a positive tone, "I cannot for a moment
admit it.A tale in which a spirit or a demon is the principal actor!At that moment I made a discovery; I drew from the midst of a bush a
stick, one end of which was stained with blood.From its position it
seemed as if it had been thrown hastily away; there had certainly been
no attempt at concealment."Here is the weapon," I cried, "with which the deed was done!"The magistrate took it immediately from my hand, and examined it."Here," I said, pointing downwards, "is the direct line of flight
taken by the prisoner, and he must have flung the stick away in terror
as he ran.""It is an improvised weapon," said the magistrate, "cut but lately
from a tree, and fashioned so as to fit the hand and be used with
effect."I, in my turn, then examined the weapon, and was struck by its
resemblance to the branch I had myself cut the previous night during
the watch I kept upon the ruffians.I spoke of the resemblance, and
said that it looked to me as if it were the self-same stick I had
shaped with my knife."Do you remember," asked the magistrate, "what you did with it after
your suspicions were allayed?""No," I replied, "I have not the slightest remembrance what I did with
it.I could not have carried it home with me, or I should have seen it
this morning before I left my house.I have no doubt that, after my
mind was at ease as to the intentions of the ruffians, I flung it
aside into the woods, having no further use for it.When the men set
out to perpetrate the robbery they must have stumbled upon the branch,
and, appreciating the pains I had bestowed upon it, took it with them.There appears to be no other solution to their possession of it.""It is the only solution," said the magistrate."So that," I said with a sudden thrill of horror, "I am indirectly
responsible for the direction of the tragedy, and should have been
responsible had they used the weapon against those I love!"We have all happily been spared,
Gabriel," he said."It is only the guilty who have suffered."We continued our search for some time, without meeting with any
further evidence, and I spent the evening with Doctor Louis's family,
and was deeply grateful that Providence had frustrated the villainous
schemes of the wretches who had conspired against them.On this
evening Lauretta and I seemed to be drawn closer to each other, and
once, when I held her hand in mine for a moment or two (it was done
unconsciously), and her father's eyes were upon us, I was satisfied
that he did not deem it a breach of the obligation into which we had
entered with respect to my love for his daughter.Indeed it was not
possible that all manifestations of a love so profound and absorbing
as mine should be successfully kept out of sight; it would have been
contrary to nature.I slept that night in Doctor Louis's house, and the next morning
Lauretta and Lauretta's mother said that they had experienced a
feeling of security because of my presence.At noon I was on my way to the magistrate's office.My purpose was to obtain, by the magistrate's permission, an interview
with the prisoner.His account of the man's sincere or pretended
belief in spirits and demons had deeply interested me, and I wished to
have some conversation with him respecting this particular adventure
which had ended in murder.I obtained without difficulty the
permission I sought.I asked if the prisoner had made any further
admissions or confession, and the magistrate answered no, and that the
man persisted in a sullen adherence to the tale he had invented in his
own defence."I saw him this morning," the magistrate said, "and interrogated him
with severity, to no effect.He continues to declare himself to be
innocent, and reiterates his fable of the demon.""Have you asked him," I inquired, "to give you an account of all that
transpired within his knowledge from the moment he entered Nerac until
the moment he was arrested?""No," said the magistrate, "it did not occur to me to demand of him so
close a description of his movements; and I doubt whether I should
have been able to drag it from him.The truth he will not tell, and
his invention is not strong enough to go into minute details.He is
conscious of this, conscious that I should trip him up again and again
on minor points which would be fatal to him, and his cunning nature
warns him not to thrust his head into the trap.He belongs to the
lowest order of criminals."My idea was to obtain from the prisoner just such a circumstantial
account of his movements as I thought it likely the magistrate would
have extracted from him; and I felt that I had the power to succeed
where the magistrate had failed.I was taken into the man's cell, and left there without a word.He was
still bound; his brute face was even more brute and haggard than
before, his hair was matted, his eyes had a look in them of mingled
terror and ferocity.He spoke no word, but he raised his head and
lowered it again when the door of the cell was closed behind me.But I had to repeat the question twice
before he answered me."Why did you not reply to me at once?"But to this question, although
I repeated it also twice, he made no response."It is useless," I said sternly, "to attempt evasion with me, or to
think that I will be content with silence.I have come here to obtain
a confession from you--a true confession, Pierre--and I will force it
from you, if you do not give it willingly."I understand you," he said, keeping his face averted from me, "but I
will not speak.""Because you know all; because you are only playing with me; because
you have a design against me."His words astonished me, and made me more determined to carry out my
intention.He had made it clear to me that there was something hidden
in his mind, and I was resolved to get at it."What design can I have against you," I said, "of which you need be
afraid?You are in sufficient peril already, and there is no hope for
you.Soon you
will be as dead as the man you murdered.""I did not murder him," was the strange reply, "and you know it.""You are playing the same trick upon me that you
played upon your judge.It was unsuccessful with him; it will be as
unsuccessful with me.What further danger can threaten you
than the danger, the certain, positive danger, in which you now stand?"My body is, perhaps," he muttered, "but not my soul.""Oh," I said, in a tone of contempt, "you believe in a soul.""Yes," he replied, "do not you?"Not out of my fears, but out
of my hopes.""I have no hopes and no fears," he said."I have done wrong, but not
the wrong with which I am charged."His response to this was to hide his head closer on his breast, to
make an even stronger endeavour to avoid my glance."When I next command you," I said, "you will obey.Believing that you possess one, what worse peril can threaten it than
the pass to which you have brought it by your crime."And still he doggedly repeated, "I have committed no crime.""Because you are here to tempt me, to ensnare me.I strode to his side, and with my strong hand on his shoulder, forced
him to raise his head, forced him to look me straight in the face.His
eyes wavered for a few moments, shifted as though they would escape my
compelling power, and finally became fixed on mine.The will in me was strong, and produced its effects on the
weaker mind.Gradually what brilliancy there was in his eyes became
dimmed, and drew but a reflected, shadowy light from mine.Thus we
remained face to face for four or five minutes, and then I spoke."Relate to me," I said, "all that you know from the time you and the
man who is dead conceived the idea of coming to Nerac up to the
present moment."We were poor, both of us," Pierre commenced, "and had been poor all
our lives.That would not have mattered had we been able to obtain
meat and wine.We were neither of us honest, and had
been in prison more than once for theft.We were never innocent when
we were convicted, although we swore we were.I got tired of it;
starvation is a poor game.I would have been contented with a little,
and so would he, but we could not make sure of that little.Nothing
else was left to us but to take what we wanted.The wild beasts do;
why should not we?But we were too well known in our village, some
sixty miles from Nerac, so, talking it over, we said we would come
here and try our luck.We had heard of Doctor Louis, and that he was a
rich man.He can spare what we want, we said; we will go and take.We
had no idea of blood; we only wanted money, to buy meat and wine with.So we started, with nothing in our pockets.On the first day we had a
slice of luck.We met a man and waylaid him, and took from him all the
money he had in his pockets.It was not much, but enough to carry us
to Nerac.We did not hurt the man; a
knock on the head did not take his senses from him, but brought him to
them; so, being convinced, he gave us what he had, and we departed on
our way.We were not fast walkers, and, besides, we did not know the
straightest road to Nerac, so we were four days on the journey.When
we entered the inn of the Three Black Crows we had just enough money
left to pay for a bottle of red wine.We called for it, and sat
drinking.While we were there a spirit entered in the shape of a man.This spirit, whom I did not then know to be a demon, sat talking with
the landlord of the Three Black Crows.He looked towards the place
where we were sitting, and I wondered whether he and the landlord were
talking of us; I could not tell, because what they said did not reach
my ears.He went away, and we went away, too, some time afterwards.We
wanted another bottle of red wine, but the landlord would not give it
to us without our paying for it, and we had no money; our pockets were
bare.Before we entered the Three Black Crows we had found out
Doctor Louis's house, and knew exactly how it was situated; there
would be no difficulty in finding it later on, despite the darkness.We had decided not to make the attempt until at least two hours past
midnight, but, for all that, when we left the inn we walked in the
direction of the doctor's house.I do not know if we should have
continued our way, because, although I saw nothing and heard nothing,
I had a fancy that we were being followed; I couldn't say by what, but
the idea was in my mind.So, talking quietly together, he and I
determined to turn back to some woods on the outskirts of Nerac which
we had passed through before we reached the village, and there to
sleep an hour or two till the time arrived to put our plan into
execution.Back we turned, and as we went there came a sign to me.I
don't know how; it was through the senses, for I don't remember
hearing anything that I could not put down to the wind.My mate heard
it too, and we stopped in fear.We stood quiet a long while, and
heard nothing.Then my mate said, 'It was the wind;' and we went on
till we came to the woods, which we entered.Down upon the ground we
threw ourselves, and in a minute my mate was asleep.Not so I; but I
pretended to be.I did not move;
I even breathed regularly to put it off the scent.Presently it
departed, and I opened my eyes; nothing was near us.Then, being tired
with the long day's walk, and knowing that there was work before us
which would be better done after a little rest, I fell asleep myself.We both slept, I can't say how long, but from the appearance of the
night I judged till about the time we had resolved to do our work.I
woke first, and awoke my mate, and off we set to the doctor's house.We reached it in less than an hour, and nothing disturbed us on the
way.That made me think that I had been deceived, and that my senses
had been playing tricks with me.I told my mate of my fears, and he
laughed at me, and I laughed, too, glad to be relieved.We walked
round the doctor's house, to decide where we should commence.The
front of it faces the road, and we thought that too dangerous, so we
made our way to the back, and, talking in whispers, settled to bore a
hole through the shutters there.We were very quiet; no fear of our
being heard.The hole being bored, it was easy to cut away wood enough
to enable us to open the window and make our way into the house.We
did not intend violence, that is, not more than was necessary for our
safety.We had talked it over, and had decided that no blood was to be
shed.Our plan was to gag and tie
up any one who interfered with us.My mate and I had had no quarrel;
we were faithful partners; and I had no other thought than to remain
true to him as he had no other thought than to remain true to me.Share and share alike--that was what we both intended.So he worked
away at the shutter, while I looked on.A blow came,
from the air it seemed, and down fell my mate, struck dead!He did not
move; he did not speak; he died, unshriven.I looked down, dazed, when
I heard a swishing sound in the air behind me, as though a great club
was making a circle and about to fall upon my head.It was all in a
minute, and I turned and saw the demon.I
slanted my body aside, and the club, instead of falling upon my head,
fell upon my shoulder.I ran for my life, and down came another blow,
on my head this time, but it did not kill me.I raced like a madman,
tearing at the bushes, and the demon after me.I was struck again and
again, but not killed.Wounded and bleeding, I continued my flight,
till flat I fell like a log.Not because all my strength was gone; no,
there was still a little left; but I showed myself more cunning than
the demon, for down I went as if I was dead, and he left me, thinking
me so.Then, when he was gone, I opened my eyes, and managed to drag
myself away to the place where I was found yesterday more dead than
alive.I did not kill my mate; I never raised my hand against him.What I have said is the truth, as I hope for mercy in the next world,
if I don't get it in this!"This was the incredible story related to me by the villain who had
threatened the life of the woman I loved; for he did not deceive me;
murder was in his heart, and his low cunning only served to show him
in a blacker light.I
released him from the spell I had cast upon him, and he stood before
me, shaking and trembling, with a look in his eyes as though he had
just been awakened from sleep."You have confessed all," I said, meeting cunning with cunning.Then I told him that he had made a full confession of his crime, and
in the telling expounded my own theory, as if it had come from his
lips, of the thoughts which led to it, and of its final committal--my
hope being that he would even now admit that he was the murderer."If I have said as much," he said, "it is you who have driven me to
it, and it is you who have come here to set a snare for my
destruction.But it is not possible, because what you have told me is
false from beginning to end."So I left him, amazed at his dogged, determined obstinacy, which I
knew would not avail him.I have been reading over the record I have written of my life, which
has been made with care and a strict adherence to the truth.I am at
the present hour sitting alone in the house I have taken and
furnished, and to which I hope shortly to bring my beloved Lauretta as
my wife.The writing of this record from time to time has grown into a
kind of habit with me, and there are occasions in which I have been
greatly interested in it myself.Never until this night have I read
the record from beginning to end, and I have come to a resolution to
discontinue it.My reason is a sufficient one, and as it concerns no
man else, no man can dispute my right to make it.My resolution is, after to-morrow, to allow my new life, soon to
commence, to flow on uninterruptedly without burdening myself with the
labour of putting into writing the happy experiences awaiting me.I
shall be no longer alone; Lauretta will be by my side; I should
begrudge the hours which deprived me of her society.I must have no secrets from her; and much that here is
recorded should properly be read by no eye than mine.Lauretta's
nature is so gentle, her soul so pure, that it would distress her to
read these pages.I recognise a certain morbid vein
in myself which the continuing of this record might magnify into a
disease.It presents itself to me in the light of guarding myself
against myself, by adopting wise measures to foster cheerfulness.That
my nature is more melancholy than cheerful is doubtless to be ascribed
to the circumstances of my child-life, which was entirely devoid of
light and gaiety.This must not be in the future; I have a battle to
fight, and I shall conquer because Lauretta's happiness is on the
issue.It will, however, be as well to make the record complete in a certain
sense, and I shall therefore take note of certain things which have
occurred since my conversation with Pierre in his cell.That done, I
shall put these papers aside in a secret place, and shall endeavour to
forget them.My first thought was to destroy the record, but I was
influenced in the contrary direction by the fact that my first meeting
with Lauretta and the growth of my love for her are described in it.First impressions jotted down at the time of their occurrence have a
freshness about them which can never be imparted by the aid of memory,
and it may afford me pleasure in the future to live over again,
through these pages, the sweet days of my early intimacy with my
beloved girl.Then there is the strange story of Kristel and Silvain,
which undoubtedly is worth preserving.First, to get rid of the miserable affair of the attempt to rob Doctor
Louis's house.Pierre was tried and convicted, and has paid the
penalty of his crime.His belief in the possession of a soul could
not, after all, have had in it the spirit of sincerity; it must have
been vaunted merely in pursuance of his cunning endeavours to escape
his just punishment; otherwise he would have confessed before he died.Father Daniel, the good priest, did all he could to bring the man to
repentance, but to the last he insisted that he was innocent.It was
strange to me to hear Father Daniel express himself sympathetically
towards the criminal."He laboured, up to the supreme moment," said the good priest, in a
compassionate tone, "under the singular hallucination that he was
going before his Maker guiltless of the shedding of blood.So fervent
and apparently sincere were his protestations that I could not help
being shaken in my belief that he was guilty.""Not in the sense," said Father Daniel, "that the unhappy man would
have had me believe.Reason rejects his story as something altogether
too incredulous; and yet I pity him."I did not prolong the discussion with the good priest; it would have
been useless, and, to Father Daniel, painful.We looked at the matter
from widely different standpoints.Intolerance warps the judgment; no
less does such a life as Father Daniel has lived, for ever seeking to
find excuses for error and crime, for ever seeking to palliate a man's
misdeeds.Sweetness of disposition, carried to extremes, may
degenerate into positive mental feebleness; to my mind this is the
case with Father Daniel.He is not the kind who, in serious matters,
can be depended upon for a just estimate of human affairs.Eric and Emilius, after a longer delay than Doctor Louis anticipated,
have taken up their residence in Nerac.They paid two short visits to
the village, and I was in hopes each time upon their departure that
they had relinquished their intention of living in Nerac.I did not
give expression to my wish, for I knew it was not shared by any member
of Doctor Louis's family.It is useless to disguise that I dislike them, and that there exists
between us a certain antipathy.To be just, this appears to be more on
my side than on theirs, and it is not in my disfavour that the
feelings I entertain are nearer the surface.Doctor Louis and the
ladies entertain a high opinion of them; I do not; and I have already
some reason for looking upon them with a suspicious eye.When we were first introduced it was natural that I should regard them
with interest, an interest which sprang from the story of their
father's fateful life.They bear a wonderful resemblance to each other
they are both fair, with tawny beards, which it appears to me they
take a pride in shaping and trimming alike; their eyes are blue, and
they are of exactly the same height.Undoubtedly handsome men, having
in that respect the advantage of me, who, in point of attractive
looks, cannot compare with them.They seem to be devotedly attached to
each other, but this may or may not be.So were Silvain and Kristel
until a woman stepped between them and changed their love to hate.Before I came into personal relationship with Eric and Emilius I made
up my mind to distrust appearances and to seek for evidence upon which
to form an independent judgment.Some such evidence has already come
to me, and I shall secretly follow it up.They are on terms of the most affectionate intimacy with Doctor Louis
and his family, and both Lauretta and Lauretta's mother take pleasure
in their society; Doctor Louis, also, in a lesser degree.Women are
always more effusive than men.They are not aware of the relations which bind me to the village.That
they may have some suspicion of my feelings for Lauretta is more than
probable, for I have seen them look from her to me and then at each
other, and I have interpreted these looks.It is as if they said, "Why
is this stranger here?I have begged Doctor
Louis to allow me to speak openly to Lauretta, and he has consented to
shorten the period of silence to which I was pledged.I have his
permission to declare my love to his daughter to-morrow.There are no
doubts in my mind that she will accept me; but there _are_ doubts that
if I left it too late there would be danger that her love for me would
be weakened.Yes, although it is torture to me to admit it I cannot
rid myself of this impression.By these brothers, Eric and Emilius, and by means of misrepresentations
to my injury.I have no positive data to go upon, but I am convinced
that they have an aversion towards me, and that they are in their hearts
jealous of me.The doctor is blind to their true character; he believes
them to be generous and noble-minded, men of rectitude and high
principle.I have the evidence of my senses in proof
of it.So much have I been disturbed and unhinged by my feelings towards
these brothers--feelings which I have but imperfectly expressed--that
latterly I have frequently been unable to sleep.Impossible to lie
abed and toss about for hours in an agony of unrest; therefore I chose
the lesser evil, and resumed the nocturnal wanderings which was my
habit in Rosemullion before the death of my parents.These nightly
rambles have been taken in secret, as in the days of my boyhood, and I
mused and spoke aloud as was my custom during that period of my life.But I had new objects to occupy me now--the home in which I hoped to
enjoy a heaven of happiness, with Lauretta its guiding star, and all
the bright anticipations of the future.I strove to confine myself to
these dreams, which filled my soul with joy, but there came to me
always the figures of Eric and Emilius, dark shadows to threaten my
promised happiness.Last week it was, on a night in which I felt that sleep would not be
mine if I sought my couch; therefore, earlier than usual--it was
barely eleven o'clock--I left the house, and went into the woods.Martin Hartog and his fair daughter were in the habit of retiring
early and rising with the sun, and I stole quietly away unobserved.At
twelve o'clock I turned homewards, and when I was about a hundred
yards from my house I was surprised to hear a low murmur of voices
within a short distance of me.Since the night on which I visited the
Three Black Crows and saw the two strangers there who had come to
Nerac with evil intent, I had become very watchful, and now these
voices speaking at such an untimely hour thoroughly aroused me.I
stepped quietly in their direction, so quietly that I knew I could not
be heard, and presently I saw standing at a distance of ten or twelve
yards the figures of a man and a woman.The man was Emilius, the woman
Martin Hartog's daughter.Although I had heard their voices before I reached the spot upon which
I stood when I recognised their forms, I could not even now determine
what they said, they spoke in such low tones.So I stood still and
watched them and kept myself from their sight.I may say honestly that
I should not have been guilty of the meanness had it not been that I
entertain an unconquerable aversion against Eric and Emilius.I was
sorry to see Martin Hartog's daughter holding a secret interview with
a man at midnight, for the girl had inspired me with a respect of
which I now knew she was unworthy; but I cannot aver that I was sorry
to see Emilius in such a position, for it was an index to his
character and a justification of the unfavourable opinion I had formed
of him and Eric.Alike as they were in physical presentment, I had no
doubt that their moral natures bore the same kind of resemblance.Libertines both of them, ready for any low intrigue, and holding in
light regard a woman's good name and fame.Truly the picture before me
showed clearly the stuff of which these brothers are made.If they
hold one woman's good name so lightly, they hold all women so.Fit
associates, indeed, for a family so pure and stainless as Doctor
Louis's!This was no chance meeting--how was that possible at such an hour?Theirs was no new acquaintanceship; it must have
lasted already some time.The very secrecy of the interview was in
itself a condemnation.Should I make Doctor Louis acquainted with the true character of the
brothers who held so high a place in his esteem?This was the question
that occurred to me as I gazed upon Emilius and Martin Hartog's
daughter, and I soon answered it in the negative.Doctor Louis was a
man of settled convictions, hard to convince, hard to turn.His first
impulse, upon which he would act, would be to go straight to Emilius,
and enlighten him upon the discovery I had made.Why, then,
Emilius would invent some tale which it would not be hard to believe,
and make light of a matter I deemed so serious.I should be placed in
the position of an eavesdropper, as a man setting sly watches upon
others to whom, from causeless grounds, I had taken a dislike.Whatever the result one thing was
certain--that I was a person capable not only of unreasonable
antipathies but of small meannesses to which a gentleman would not
descend.The love which Doctor Louis bore to Silvain, and which he had
transferred to Silvain's children, was not to be easily turned; and at
the best I should be introducing doubts into his mind which would
reflect upon myself because of the part of spy I had played.No; I
decided for the present at least, to keep  the knowledge to myself.As to Martin Hartog, though I could not help feeling pity for him, it
was for him, not me, to look after his daughter.From a general point
of view these affairs were common enough.I seemed to see now in a clearer light the kind of man Silvain
was--one who would set himself deliberately to deceive where most he
was trusted.Honour, fair dealing, brotherly love, were as nought in
his eyes where a woman was concerned, and he had transmitted these
qualities to Eric and Emilius.My sympathy for Kristel was deepened by
what I was gazing on; more than ever was I convinced of the justice of
the revenge he took upon the brother who had betrayed him.These were the thoughts which passed through my mind while Emilius and
Martin Hartog's daughter stood conversing.Presently they strolled
towards me, and I shrank back in fear of being discovered.This
involuntary action on my part, being an accentuation of the meanness
of which I was guilty, confirmed me in the resolution at which I had
arrived to say nothing of my discovery to Doctor Louis.They passed me in silence, walking in the direction of my house.I did
not follow them, and did not return home for another hour.How shall I describe the occurrences of this day, the most memorable
and eventful in my life?I am
overwhelmed at the happiness which is within my grasp.As I walked
home from Doctor Louis's house through the darkness a spirit walked by
my side, illumining the gloom and filling my heart with gladness.At one o'clock I presented myself at Doctor Louis's house.He met me
at the door, expecting me, and asked me to come with him to a little
room he uses as a study.His face was
grave, and but for its kindly expression I should have feared it was
his intention to revoke the permission he had given me to speak to his
daughter on this day of the deep, the inextinguishable love I bear for
her.He motioned me to a chair, and I seated myself and waited for him
to speak."This hour," he said, "is to me most solemn.""And to me, sir," I responded."It should be," he said, "to you perhaps, more than to me; but we are
inclined ever to take the selfish view.I have been awake very nearly
the whole of the night, and so has my wife.Our conversation--well,
you can guess the object of it.""Yes, Lauretta, our only child, whom you are about to take from us."I
trembled with joy, his words betokening a certainty that Lauretta
loved me, an assurance I had yet to receive from her own sweet lips."My wife and I," he continued, "have been living over again the life
of our dear one, and the perfect happiness we have drawn from her.I
am not ashamed to say that we have committed some weaknesses during
these last few hours, weaknesses springing from our affection for our
Home Rose.In the future some such experience may be yours, and then
you will know--which now is hidden from you--what parents feel who are
asked to give their one ewe lamb into the care of a stranger.""There is no reason for alarm, Gabriel," he said, "because I
have used a true word.Until a few short months ago you were really a
stranger to us.""That has not been against me, sir," I said, "and is not, I trust.""There is no such thought in my mind, Gabriel.There is nothing
against you except--except," he repeated, with a little pitiful smile,
"that you are about to take from us our most precious possession.Until to-day our dear child was wholly and solely ours; and not only
herself, but her past was ours, her past, which has been to us a
garden of joy.Henceforth her heart will be divided, and you will have
the larger share.That is a great deal to think of, and we have
thought of it, my wife and I, and talked of it nearly all the night.Certain treasures," he said, and again the pitiful smile came on his
lips, "which in the eyes of other men and women are valueless, still
are ours."He opened a drawer, and gazed with loving eyes upon its
contents."Such as a little pair of shoes, a flower or two, a lock of
her bright hair."I asked, profoundly touched by the loving accents
of his voice."Surely," he replied, and he passed over to me a lock of golden hair,
which I pressed to my lips."The little head was once covered with
these golden curls, and to us, her parents, they were as holy as they
would have been on the head of an angel.She was all that to us,
Gabriel.It is within the scope of human love to lift one's thoughts
to heaven and God; it is within its scope to make one truly fit for
the life to come.All things are not of the world worldly; it is a
grievous error to think so, and only sceptics can so believe.In the
kiss of baby lips, in the touch of little hands, in the myriad sweet
ways of childhood, lie the breath of a pure religion which God
receives because of its power to sanctify the lowest as well as the
highest of human lives.It is good to think of that, and to feel that,
in the holiest forms of humanity, the poor stand as high as the rich.""Gabriel, it is an idle phrase
for a father holding the position towards you which I do at the
present moment, to say he has no fears for the happiness of his only
child.""If you have any, sir," I said, "question me, and let me endeavour to
set your mind at ease.In one respect I can do so with solemn
earnestness.If it be my happy lot to win your daughter, her welfare,
her honour, her peace of mind, shall be the care of my life.I love Lauretta with a pure heart;
no other woman has ever possessed my love; to no other woman have I
been drawn; nor is it possible that I could be.She is to me part of
my spiritual life.I am not as other men, in the ordinary acceptation.In my childhood's life there was but little joy, and the common
pleasures of childhood were not mine.From almost my earliest
remembrances there was but little light in my parents' house, and in
looking back upon it I can scarcely call it a home.The fault was not
mine, as you will admit.May I claim some small merit--not of my own
purposed earning, but because it was in me, for which I may have
reason to be grateful--from the fact that the circumstances of my
early life did not corrupt me, did not drive me to a searching for low
pleasures, and did not debase me?It seemed to me, sir, that I was
ever seeking for something in the heights and not in the depths.Books
and study were my comforters, and I derived real pleasures from them.They served to satisfy a want, and, although I contracted a melancholy
mood, I was not unhappy.I know that this mood is in me, but when I
think of Lauretta it is dispelled.I seem to hear the singing of
birds, to see flowers around me, to bathe in sunshine.Perhaps it
springs from the fervour of my love for her; but a kind of belief is
mine that I have been drawn hither to her, that my way of life was
measured to her heart."You have said much," said Doctor Louis, "to comfort and assure me,
and have, without being asked, answered questions which were in my
mind.Do you remember a conversation you had with my wife in the first
days of your convalescence, commenced I think by you in saying that
the happiest dream of your life was drawing to a close?"Even in those early days I felt that I
loved her.""I understand that now," said Doctor Louis."My wife replied that life
must not be dreamt away, that it has duties.""My wife said that one's ease and pleasures are rewards, only
enjoyable when they have been worthily earned; and when you asked,
'Earned in what way?'she answered, 'In accomplishing one's work in
the world.'""Yes, sir, her words come back to me.""There is something more," said Doctor Louis, with sad sweetness,
"which I should not recall did I not hold duty before me as my chief
beacon.Inclination and selfish desire must often be sacrificed for
it.You will understand how sadly significant this is to me when I
recall what followed.Though, to be sure," he added, in a slightly
gayer tone, "we could visit you and our daughter, wherever your abode
happened to be.Continuing your conversation with my wife, you said,
'How to discover what one's work really is, and where it should be
properly performed?'My wife answered, 'In one's native land.'""Those were the words we spoke to one another, sir.""It was my wife who recalled them to me, and I wish you--in the event
of your hopes being realised--to bear them in mind.It would be
painful to me to see you lead an idle life, and it would be injurious
to you.This quiet village opens out no opportunities to you; it is
too narrow, too confined.I have found my place here as an active
worker, but I doubt if you would do so.""There is time to think of it, sir."And now, if you like, we will join my wife and
daughter.""Have you said anything to Lauretta, sir?"I thought it best, and so did her mother, that her heart should
be left to speak for itself."Lauretta's mother received me with tender, wistful solicitude, and I
observed nothing in Lauretta to denote that she had been prepared for
the declaration I had come to make.After lunch I proposed to Lauretta
to go out into the garden, and she turned to her mother and asked if
she would accompany us."No, my child," said the mother, "I have things in the house to attend
to."It was a lovely day, and Lauretta had thrown a light lace scarf over
her head.She was in gay spirits, not boisterous, for she is ever
gentle, and she endeavoured to entertain me with innocent prattle, to
which I found it difficult to respond.In a little while this forced
itself upon her observation, and she asked me if I was not well."I am quite well, Lauretta," I replied."Then something has annoyed you," she said.No, I answered, nothing had annoyed me."But there _is_ something," she said."Yes," I said, "there _is_ something."We were standing by a rosebush, and I plucked one absently, and
absently plucked the leaves.She looked at me in silence for a moment
or two and said, "This is the first time I have ever seen you destroy
a flower.""I was not thinking of it," I said; and was about to throw it away
when an impulse, born purely of love for what was graceful and sweet,
restrained me, and I put it into my pocket.In this the most
impressive epoch in my life no sentiment but that of tenderness could
hold a place in my heart and mind."Lauretta," I said, taking her hand, which she left willingly in mine,
"will you listen to the story of my life?""You have already told me much," she said."You have heard only a part," I said, and I gently urged her to a
seat."I wish you to know all; I wish you to know me as I really am.""I know you as you really are," she said, and then a faint colour came
to her cheeks, and she trembled slightly, seeing a new meaning in my
earnest glances."Yes," she said, and gently withdrew her hand from mine.I told her all, withholding only from her those mysterious promptings
of my lonely hours which I knew would distress her, and to which I was
convinced, with her as my companion through life, there would be for
ever an end.Of even those promptings I gave her some insight, but so
toned down--for her sweet sake, not for mine--as to excite only her
sympathy.Apart from this, I was at sincere pains that she should see
my life as it had really been, a life stripped of the joys of
childhood; a life stripped of the light of home; a life dependent upon
itself for comfort and support.Then, unconsciously, and out of the
suffering of my soul--for as I spoke it seemed to me that a cruel
wrong had been perpetrated upon me in the past--I contrasted the young
life I had been condemned to live with that of a child who was blessed
with parents whose hearts were animated by a love the evidences of
which would endure all through his after life as a sweet and purifying
influence.The tears ran down her cheeks as I dwelt upon this part of
my story.Then I spoke of the happy chance which had conducted me to
her home, and of the happiness I had experienced in my association
with her and hers."Whatever fate may be mine," I said, "I shall never reflect upon these
experiences, I shall never think of your dear parents, without
gratitude and affection.Lauretta, it is with their permission I am
here now by your side.It is with their permission that I am opening
my heart to you.I love you, Lauretta,
and if you will bless me with your love, and place your hand in mine,
all my life shall be devoted to your happiness.You can bring a
blessing into my days; I will strive to bring a blessing into yours."My arm stole round her waist; her head drooped to my shoulder, so that
her face was hidden from my ardent gaze; the hand I clasped was not
withdrawn."Lauretta," I whispered, "say 'I love you, Gabriel.'""I love you, Gabriel," she whispered; and heaven itself opened out to
me.Half an hour later we went in to her mother, and the noble woman held
out her arms to her daughter.As the maiden nestled to her breast, she
said, holding out a hand to me, which I reverently kissed, "God in His
mercy keep guard over you!*   *   *   *   *

These are my last written words in the record I have kept.From this
day I commence a new life.IN WHICH THE SECRET OF THE INHERITANCE TRANSMITTED TO GABRIEL CAREW IS
REVEALED IN A SERIES OF LETTERS FROM ABRAHAM SANDIVAL, ESQ., ENGLAND,
TO HIS FRIEND, MAXIMILIAN GALLENGA, ESQ., CONTRA COSTA CO.,
CALIFORNIA.I.


My Dear Max,--For many months past you have complained that I have
been extremely reticent upon domestic matters, and that I have said
little or nothing concerning my son Reginald, who, since you quitted
the centres of European civilisation to bury yourself in a sparsely
populated Paradise, has grown from childhood to manhood.A ripe
manhood, my dear Max, such as I, his father, approve of, and to the
future development of which, now that a grave and strange crisis in
his life has come to a happy ending, I look forward with loving
interest.It is, I know, your affection for Reginald that causes you
to be anxious for news of him.Well do I remember when you informed me
of your fixed resolution to seek not only new scenes but new modes of
life, how earnestly you strove to prevail upon me to allow him to
accompany you."He is young and plastic," you said, "and I can train him to
happiness.The fewer the wants, the more contented the lot of man."You wished to educate Reginald according to the primitive views to
which you had become so strongly wedded, and you did your best to
convert me to them, saying, I remember, that I should doubtless suffer
in parting with Reginald, but that it was a father's duty to make
sacrifices for his children.My belief was, and
is, that man is born to progress, and that to go back into
primitiveness, to commence again, as it were, the history of the world
and mankind, as though we had been living in error through all the
centuries, is a folly.I did not apply this criticism to you; I
regarded your new departure not as a folly, but as a mistake.I doubt
even now whether it has made you happier than you were, and I fancy
I detect here and there in your letters a touch of sadness and
regret--of which perhaps you are unconscious--that you should have cut
yourself away from the busy life of multitudes of people.However, it
is not my purpose now to enlarge upon this theme.The history I am
about to relate is personal to myself and to Reginald, whose destiny
it has been to come into close contact with a family, the head of
which, Gabriel Carew, affords a psychological study as strange
probably as was ever presented to the judgment of mankind.There are various reasons for my undertaking a task which will occupy
a great deal of time and entail considerable labour.The labour will
be interesting to me, and its products no less interesting to you, who
were always fond of the mystical.I have leisure to apply myself to
it.Reginald is not at present with me; he has left me for a few weeks
upon a mission of sunshine.This will sound enigmatical to you, but
you must content yourself with the gradual and intelligible unfolding
of the wonderful story I am about to narrate.Like a skilful narrator
I shall not weaken the interest by giving information and presenting
pictures to you in the wrong places.The history is one which it is my
opinion should not be lost to the world; its phases are so remarkable
that it will open up a field of inquiry which may not be without
profitable results to those who study psychological mysteries.A few
years hence I should not be able to recall events in their logical
order; I therefore do so while I possess the power and while my memory
is clear with respect to them.You will soon discover that neither I nor Reginald is the principal
character in this drama of life.Gabriel Carew, the owner of an estate in the county of Kent, known as
Rosemullion.My labours will be thrown away unless you are prepared to read what I
shall write with unquestioning faith.I shall set down nothing but the
truth, and you must accept it without a thought of casting doubt upon
it.That you will wonder and be amazed is certain; it would, indeed,
be strange otherwise; for in all your varied experiences (you led a
busy and eventful life before you left us) you met with none so
singular and weird as the events which I am about to bring to your
knowledge.You must accept also--as the best and most suitable form
through which you will be made familiar not only with the personality
of Gabriel Carew, but with the mysterious incidents of his life--the
methods I shall adopt in the unfolding of my narrative.They are such
as are frequently adopted with success by writers of fiction, and as
my material is fact, I am justified in pressing it into my service.I
am aware that objection may be taken to it on the ground that I shall
be presenting you with conversations between persons of which I was
not a witness, but I do not see in what other way I could offer you an
intelligent and intelligible account of the circumstances of the
story.All that I can therefore do is to promise that I will keep a
strict curb upon my imagination and will not allow it to encroach upon
the domains of truth.With this necessary prelude I devote myself to
my task.Before, however, myself commencing the work there is something
essential for you to do.Accompanying my own manuscript is a packet,
carefully sealed and secured, on the outer sheet of which is written,
"Not to be disturbed or opened until instructions to do so are given
by Abraham Sandival to his friend Maximilian Gallenofa."The
precaution is sufficient to whet any man's curiosity, but is not taken
to that end.It is simply in pursuance of the plan I have designed, by
which you will become possessed of all the details and particulars for
the proper understanding of what I shall impart to you.The packet, my
dear Max, is neither more nor less than a life record made by Gabriel
Carew himself up to within a few months of his marriage, which took
place twenty years ago in the village of Nerac.The lady Gabriel Carew
married was the daughter of Doctor Louis, a gentleman of rare
acquirements, and distinguished both for his learning and benevolence.There is no evidence in the record as to whether its recital was
spread over a number of years, or was begun and finished within a few
months; but that matters little.It bears the impress of absolute
truth and candour, and apart from its startling revelations you will
recognise in it a picturesqueness of description hardly to be expected
from one who had not made a study of literature.Its perusal will
perplexedly stir your mind, and in the feelings it will excite towards
Gabriel Carew there will most likely be an element of pity, the reason
for which you will find it difficult to explain."Season your
admiration for a while;" before I am at the end of my task the riddle
will be solved.As I pen these words I can realise your perplexity during your perusal
of the record as to the manner in which my son Reginald came be
associated with so strange a man as the writer.But this is a world of
mystery, and we can never hope to find a key to its spiritual
workings.With respect to this particular mystery nothing shall be
hidden from you.You will learn how I came to be mixed up in it; you
will learn how vitally interwoven it threatened to be in Reginald's
life; you will learn how Gabriel Carew's manuscript fell into my
hands; and the mystery of his life will be revealed to you.Now, my dear Max, you can unfasten the packet, and read the record.I assume that you are now familiar with the story of Gabriel Carew's
life up to the point, or within a few months, of his marriage with
Lauretta, and that you have formed some opinion of the different
persons with whom he came in contact in Nerac.Outside Nerac there was
only one person who can be said to have been interested in his fate;
this was his mother's nurse, Mrs.Fortress, and you must be deeply
impressed by the part she played in the youthful life of Gabriel
Carew.Of her I shall have to speak in due course.I transport you in fancy to Nerac, my dear Max, where I have been not
very long ago, and where I conversed with old people who to this day
remember Gabriel Carew and his sweet wife Lauretta, whom he brought
with him to England some little time after their marriage.It is not
likely that the incidents in connection with Gabriel Carew and his
wife will be forgotten during this generation or the next in that
loveliest of villages.When you laid aside Carew's manuscript he had received the sanction of
Lauretta's mother to his engagement with the sweet maid, and the good
woman had given her children her blessing.Thereafter Gabriel Carew
wrote: "These are my last written words in the record I have kept.He kept his word with respect to
his resolve not to add another word to the record.He sealed it up and
deposited it in his desk; and it is my belief that from that day he
never read a line of its contents.We are, then, my dear Max, in Nerac, you and I in spirit, in the
holiday time of the open courtship of Gabriel Carew and Lauretta.Carew is occupying the house of which it was his intention to make
Lauretta the mistress, and there are residing in it, besides the
ordinary servants, Martin Hartog, the gardener, and his daughter, with
whom, from Carew's record, Emilius was supposed to be carrying on an
intrigue of a secret and discreditable nature.It is evident, from the
manner in which Carew referred to it, that he considered it
dishonourable.There remain to be mentioned, as characters in the drama then being
played, Doctor Louis, Eric, and Father Daniel.The crimes of the two ruffians who had attempted to enter Doctor
Louis's house remained for long fresh in the memories of the
villagers.They were both dead, one murdered, the other executed for a
deed of which only one person in Nerac had an uneasy sense of his
innocence--Father Daniel.The good priest, having received from the
unfortunate man a full account of his life from childhood, journeyed
shortly afterwards to the village in which he had been born and was
best known, for the purpose of making inquiries into its truth.He
found it verified in every particular, and he learnt, moreover, that
although the hunchback had been frequently in trouble, it was rather
from sheer wretchedness and poverty than from any natural brutality of
disposition that he had drifted into crime.It stood to his credit
that Father Daniel could trace to him no acts of cruel violence;
indeed, the priest succeeded in bringing to light two or three
circumstances in the hunchback's career which spoke well for his
humanity, one of them being that he was kind to his bedridden mother.Father Daniel returned to Nerac much shaken by the reflection that in
this man's case justice had been in error.But if this were so, if the
hunchback were innocent, upon whom to fix the guilt?A sadness weighed
upon the good priest's heart as he went about his daily duties, and
gazed upon his flock with an awful suspicion in his mind that there
was a murderer among them, for whose crime an innocent man had been
executed.The gloom of his early life, which threatened
to cast dark shadows over all his days, seemed banished for ever.He
was liked and respected in the village in which he had found his
happiness; his charities caused men and women to hold him in something
like affectionate regard; he was Father Daniel's friend, and no case
of suffering or poverty was mentioned to him which he was not ready to
relieve; in Doctor Louis's home he held an honoured place; and he was
loved by a good and pure woman, who had consented to link her fate
with his.Surely in this prospect there was nothing that could be
productive of aught but good.The sweetness and harmony of the time, however, were soon to be
disturbed.After a few weeks of happiness, Gabriel Carew began to be
troubled.In his heart he had no love for the twin brothers, Eric and
Emilius; he believed them to be light-minded and unscrupulous, nay,
more, he believed them to be treacherous in their dealings with both
men and women.These evil qualities, he had decided with himself, they
had inherited from their father, Silvain, whose conduct towards his
unhappy brother Kristel had excited Gabriel Carew's strong abhorrence.As is shown in the comments he makes in his record, all his sympathy
was with Kristel, and he had contracted a passionate antipathy against
Silvain, whom he believed to be guilty of the blackest treachery in
his dealings with Avicia.This antipathy he now transferred to
Silvain's sons, Eric and Emilius, and they needed to be angels, not
men, to overcome it.Not that they tried to win Carew's good opinion.Although his feelings
for them were not openly expressed, they made themselves felt in the
consciousness of these twin brothers, who instinctively recognised
that Gabriel Carew was their enemy.Therefore they held off from him,
and repaid him quietly in kind.But this was a matter solely and
entirely between themselves and known only to themselves.The three
men knew what deep pain and grief it would cause not only Doctor Louis
and his wife, but the gentle Lauretta, to learn that they were in
enmity with each other, and one and all were animated by the same
desire to keep this antagonism from the knowledge of the family.This
was, indeed, a tacit understanding between them, and it was so
thoroughly carried out that no member of Doctor Louis's family
suspected it; and neither was it suspected in the village.To all
outward appearance Gabriel Carew and Eric and Emilius were friends.It was not the brothers but Carew who, in the first instance, was to
blame.He was the originator and the creator of the trouble, for it is
scarcely to be doubted that had he held out the hand of a frank
friendship to them, they would have accepted it, even though their
acceptance needed some sacrifice on their parts.The reason for this
qualification will be apparent to you later on in the story, and you
will then also understand why I do not reveal certain circumstances
respecting the affection of Eric and Emilius for Martin Hartog's
daughter, Patricia, and for the female members of the family of Doctor
Louis.I am relating the story in the
order in which it progressed, and, so far as my knowledge of it goes,
according to the sequence of time.Certainly the dominant cause of Gabriel Carew's hatred for the
brothers sprang from his jealousy of them with respect to Lauretta.They and she had been friends from childhood, and they were regarded
by Doctor Louis and his wife as members of their family.This in
itself was sufficient to inflame so exacting a lover as Carew.He
interpreted every innocent little familiarity to their disadvantage,
and magnified trifles inordinately.They saw his sufferings and were,
perhaps, somewhat scornful of them.He had already shown them how deep
was his hatred of them, and they not unnaturally resented it.After
all, he was a stranger in Nerac, a come-by-chance visitor, who had
usurped the place which might have been occupied by one of them had
the winds been fair.Instead of being overbearing and arrogant he
should have been gracious and conciliating.It was undoubtedly his
duty to be courteous and mannerly from the first day of their
acquaintance; instead of which he had, before he saw them, contracted
a dislike for them which he had allowed to swell to monstrous and
unjustifiable proportions.Gabriel Carew, however, justified himself to himself, and it may be
at once conceded that he had grounds for his feelings which were to
him--and would likely have been to some other men--sufficient.When a lover's suspicious and jealous nature is aroused it does not
from that moment sleep.There is no rest, no repose for it.If it
require opportunities for confirmation or for the infliction of
self-suffering, it is never difficult to find them.Imagination steps
in and supplies the place of fact.Every hour is a torture; every
innocent look and smile is brooded over in secret.A most prolific,
unreasonable, and cruel breeder of shadows is jealousy, and the evil
of it is that it breeds in secret.Gabriel Carew set himself to watch, and from the keen observance of a
nature so thorough and intense as his nothing could escape.He was an
unseen witness of other interviews between Patricia Hartog and
Emilius; and not only of interviews between her and Emilius but
between her and Eric.The brothers were
playing false to each other, and the girl was playing false with both.This was of little account; he had no more than a passing interest in
Patricia, and although at one time he had some kind of intention of
informing Martin Hartog of these secret interviews, and placing the
father on his guard--for the gardener seemed to be quite unaware that
an intrigue was going on--he relinquished the intention, saying that
it was no affair of his.But it confirmed the impressions he had
formed of the character of Eric and Emilius, and it strengthened him
in his determination to allow no intercourse between them and the
woman he loved.An additional torture was in store for him, and it fell upon him like
a thunderbolt.One day he saw Emilius and Lauretta walking in the
woods, talking earnestly and confidentially together.His blood
boiled; his heart beat so violently that he could scarcely distinguish
surrounding objects.So violent was his agitation that it was many
minutes before he recovered himself, and then Lauretta and Emilius had
passed out of sight.He went home in a wild fury of despair.He had not been near enough to hear one word of the conversation, but
their attitude was to him confirmation of his jealous suspicion that
the young man was endeavouring to supplant him in Lauretta's
affections.In the evening he saw Lauretta in her home, and she
noticed a change in him."No," he replied, "I am quite well.The bitterness in his voice surprised her, and she insisted that he
should seek repose."To get me out of the way," he thought; and then,
gazing into her solicitous and innocent eyes, he mutely reproached
himself for doubting her.No, it was not she who was to blame; she was
still his, she was still true to him; but how easy was it for a friend
so close to her as Emilius to instil into her trustful heart evil
reports against himself!"That is the first step," he thought.These men, these villains, are capable of any
treachery.Honour is a stranger to their scheming natures.To meet them openly, to accuse them openly, may be my ruin.They are too firmly fixed in the affections of Doctor Louis and his
wife--they are too firmly fixed in the affections of even Lauretta
herself--for me to hope to expose them upon evidence so slender.Not
slender to me, but to them.These treacherous brothers are conspiring
secretly against me.I will wait and watch till I have the strongest proof
against them, and then I will expose their true characters to Doctor
Louis and Lauretta."Having thus resolved, he was not the man to swerve from the plan he
laid down.The nightly vigils he had kept in his young life served him
now, and it seemed as if he could do without sleep.The stealthy
meetings between Patricia and the brothers continued, and before long
he saw Eric and Lauretta in the woods together.In his espionage he
was always careful not to approach near enough to bring discovery upon
himself.In an indirect manner, as though it was a matter which he deemed of
slight importance, he questioned Lauretta as to her walks in the woods
with Eric and Emilius."Yes," she said artlessly, "we sometimes meet there.""Not always by accident," replied Lauretta."Remember, Gabriel, Eric
and Emilius are as my brothers, and if they have a secret----" And
then she blushed, grew confused, and paused.These signs were poisoned food indeed to Carew, but he did not betray
himself."It was wrong of me to speak," said Lauretta, "after my promise to say
nothing to a single soul in the village.""And most especially," said Carew, hitting the mark, "to me.""Only," he continued, with slight persistence, "that it must be a
heart secret."She was silent, and he dropped the subject.From the interchange of these few words he extracted the most
exquisite torture.There was, then, between Lauretta and the brothers
a secret of the heart, known only to themselves, to be revealed to
none, and to him, Gabriel Carew, to whom the young girl was affianced,
least of all.It must be well understood, in this explanation of what
was occurring in the lives of these young people at that momentous
period, that Gabriel Carew never once suspected that Lauretta was
false to him.His great fear was that Eric and Emilius were working
warily against him, and were cunningly fabricating some kind of
evidence in his disfavour which would rob him of Lauretta's love.They
were conspiring to this end, to the destruction of his happiness, and
they were waiting for the hour to strike the fatal blow.Well, it was
for him to strike first.His love for Lauretta was so all-absorbing
that all other considerations--however serious the direct or indirect
consequences of them--sank into utter insignificance by the side of
it.He did not allow it to weigh against Lauretta that she appeared to
be in collusion with Eric and Emilius, and to be favouring their
schemes.Her nature was so guileless and unsuspecting that she could
be easily led and deceived by friends in whom she placed a trust.It
was this that strengthened Carew in his resolve not to rudely make the
attempt to open her eyes to the perfidy of Eric and Emilius.She would
have been incredulous, and the arguments he should use against his
enemies might be turned against himself.Therefore he adhered to the
line of action he had marked out.He waited, and watched, and
suffered.Meanwhile, the day appointed for his union with Lauretta was
approaching.Within a fortnight of that day Gabriel Carew's passions were roused to
an almost uncontrollable pitch.It was evening, and he saw Eric and Emilius in the woods.They were
conversing with more than ordinary animation, and appeared to be
discussing some question upon which they did not agree.Carew saw
signs which he could not interpret--appeals, implorings, evidences of
strong feeling on one side and of humbleness on the other, despair
from one, sorrow from the other; and then suddenly a phase which
startled the watcher and filled him with a savage joy.Eric, in a
paroxysm, laid hands furiously upon his brother, and it seemed for a
moment as if a violent struggle were about to take place.It was to the restraint and moderation of Emilius that this
unbrotherly conflict was avoided.He did not meet violence with
violence; after a pause he gently lifted Eric's hands from his
shoulders, and with a sad look turned away, Eric gazing at his
retreating figure in a kind of bewilderment.Presently Emilius was
gone, and only Eric remained.From an opposite direction to that taken by
Emilius the watcher saw approaching the form of the woman he loved,
and to whom he was shortly to be wed.That her coming was not
accidental, but in fulfilment of a promise was clear to Gabriel Carew.Eric expected her, and welcomed her without surprise.Then the two
began to converse.Carew's heart beat tumultuously; he would have given worlds to hear
what was being said, but he was at too great a distance for a word to
reach his ears.For a time Eric was the principal speaker, Lauretta,
for the most part, listening, and uttering now and then merely a word
or two.In her quiet way she appeared to be as deeply agitated as the
young man who was addressing her in an attitude of despairing appeal.Again and again it seemed as if he had finished what he had to say,
and again and again he resumed, without abatement of the excitement
under which he was labouring.At length he ceased, and then Lauretta
became the principal actor in the scene.She spoke long and forcibly,
but always with that gentleness of manner which was one of her
sweetest characteristics.In her turn she seemed to be appealing to
the young man, and to be endeavouring to impress upon him a sad and
bitter truth which he was unwilling, and not in the mood, to
recognise.For a long time she was unsuccessful; the young man walked
impatiently a few steps from her, then returned, contrite and humble,
but still with all the signs of great suffering upon him.At length
her words had upon him the effect she desired; he wavered, he held out
his hands helplessly, and presently covered his face with them and
sank to the ground.Then, after a silence, during which Lauretta gazed
compassionately upon his convulsed form, she stooped and placed her
hand upon his shoulder.He lifted his eyes, from which the tears were
flowing, and raised himself from the earth.He stood before her with
bowed head, and she continued to speak.The pitiful sweetness of her
face almost drove Carew mad; it could not be mistaken that her heart
was beating with sympathy for Eric's sufferings.A few minutes more
passed, and then it seemed as if she had prevailed.Eric accepted the
hand she held out to him, and pressed his lips upon it.Had he at that
moment been within Gabriel Carew's reach, it would have fared ill with
both these men, but Heaven alone knows whether it would have averted
what was to follow before the setting of another sun, to the
consternation and grief of the entire village.After pressing his lips
to Lauretta's hand, the pair separated, each going a different way,
and Gabriel Carew ground his teeth as he observed that there were
tears in Lauretta's eyes as well as in Eric's.A darkness fell upon
him as he walked homewards.V.


The following morning Nerac and the neighbourhood around were agitated
by news of a tragedy more thrilling and terrible than that in which
the hunchback and his companion in crime were concerned.In attendance
upon this tragedy, and preceding its discovery, was a circumstance
stirring enough in its way in the usually quiet life of the simple
villagers, but which, in the light of the mysterious tragedy, would
have paled into insignificance had it not been that it appeared to
have a direct bearing upon it.Martin Hartog's daughter, Patricia, had
fled from her home, and was nowhere to be discovered.This flight was made known to the villagers early in the morning by
the appearance among them of Martin Hartog, demanding in which house
his daughter had taken refuge.The man was distracted; his wild words
and actions excited great alarm, and when he found that he could
obtain no satisfaction from them, and that every man and woman in
Nerac professed ignorance of his daughter's movements, he called down
heaven's vengeance upon the man who had betrayed her, and left them to
search the woods for Patricia.The words he had uttered in his imprecations when he called upon a
higher power for vengeance on a villain opened the villagers' eyes.Who was the monster who had
worked this evil?While they were talking excitedly together they saw Gabriel Carew
hurrying to the house of Father Daniel.He was admitted, and in the
course of a few minutes emerged from it in the company of the good
priest, whose troubled face denoted that he had heard the sad news of
Patricia's flight from her father's home.The villagers held aloof
from Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew, seeing that they were in earnest
converse.Carew was imparting to the priest his suspicions of Eric and
Emilius in connection with this event; he did not mention Lauretta's
name, but related how on several occasions he had been an accidental
witness of meetings between Patricia and one or other of the brothers."It was not for me to place a construction upon these meetings," said
Carew, "nor did it appear to me that I was called upon to mention it
to any one.It would have been natural for me to suppose that Martin
Hartog was fully acquainted with his daughter's movements, and that,
being of an independent nature, he would have resented any
interference from me.He is Patricia's father, and it was believed by
all that he guarded her well.Had he been my equal I might have
incidentally asked whether there was anything serious between his
daughter and these brothers, but I am his master, and therefore was
precluded from inviting a confidence which can only exist between men
occupying the same social condition.There is, besides, another reason
for my silence which, if you care to hear, I will impart to you.""Nothing should be concealed from me," said Father Daniel."Although," said Gabriel Carew, "I have been a resident here now for
some time, I felt, and feel, that a larger knowledge of me is
necessary to give due and just weight to the unfavourable opinion I
have formed of two men with whom you have been acquainted from
childhood, and who hold a place in your heart of which they are
utterly unworthy.Not alone in your heart, but in the hearts of my
dearest friends, Doctor Louis and his family."You refer to Eric and Emilius," said the priest."What you have already said concerning them has deeply pained me.Their meetings with Hartog's daughter were,
I am convinced, innocent.They are incapable of an act of baseness;
they are of noble natures, and it is impossible that they should ever
have harboured a thought of treachery to a young maiden.""I am more than justified," said Gabriel Carew, "by the expression of
your opinion, in the course I took.You would have listened with
impatience to me, and what I should have said would have recoiled on
myself.Yet now I regret that I did not interfere; this calamity might
have been avoided, and a woman's honour saved.Let us seek Martin
Hartog; he may be in possession of information to guide us."From the villagers they learnt that Hartog had gone to the woods, and
they were about to proceed in that direction when another, who had
just arrived, informed them that he had seen Hartog going to Gabriel
Carew's house.Thither they proceeded, and found Hartog in his
cottage.He was on his knees, when they entered, before a box in which
his daughter kept her clothes.This he had forced open, and was
searching.He looked wildly at Father Daniel and Carew, and
immediately resumed his task, throwing the girl's clothes upon the
floor after examining the pockets.In his haste and agitation he did
not observe a portrait which he had cast aside, Carew picked it up and
handed it to Father Daniel."Who is the more
likely to be right in our estimate of these brothers, you or I?"Father Daniel, overwhelmed by the evidence, did not reply.By this
time Martin Hartog had found a letter which he was eagerly perusing."If there is justice in heaven he has
met with his deserts.If he still lives he shall die by my hands!""Vengeance is not yours to deal
out.Pray for comfort--pray for mercy."If the monster be not already smitten, Lord, give him into
my hands!The
cunning villain has not even signed his name!"Father Daniel took the letter from his unresisting hand, and as his
eyes fell upon the writing he started and trembled.It was indeed the writing of Emilius.Martin Hartog had heard Carew's
inquiry and the priest's reply.And without another word he rushed
from the cottage.Carew and the priest hastily followed him, but he
outstripped them, and was soon out of sight."There will be a deed of violence done," said Father Daniel, "if the
men meet.I must go immediately to the house of these unhappy brothers
and warn them."Carew accompanied him, but when they arrived at the house they were
informed that nothing had been seen of Eric and Emilius since the
previous night.Neither of them had been home nor slept in his bed.This seemed to complicate the mystery in Father Daniel's eyes,
although it was no mystery to Carew, who was convinced that where
Patricia was there would Emilius be found.Father Daniel's grief and
horror were clearly depicted.He looked upon the inhabitants of Nerac
as one family, and he regarded the dishonour of Martin Hartog's
daughter as dishonour to all.Carew, being anxious to see Lauretta,
left him to his inquiries.Louis and his family were already
acquainted with the agitating news."Dark clouds hang over this once happy village," said Doctor Louis to
Carew.He was greatly shocked, but he had no hesitation in declaring that,
although circumstances looked black against the twin brothers, his
faith in them was undisturbed.Lauretta shared his belief, and
Lauretta's mother also.Gabriel Carew did not combat with them; he
held quietly to his views, convinced that in a short time they would
think as he did.Lauretta was very pale, and out of consideration for
her Gabriel Carew endeavoured to avoid the all-engrossing subject.Nothing else could be thought or spoken
of.Once Carew remarked
to Lauretta, "You said that Eric and Emilius had a secret, and you
gave me to understand that you were not ignorant of it.Has it any
connection with what has occurred?""I must not answer you, Gabriel," she replied; "when we see Emilius
again all will be explained."Little did she suspect the awful import of those simple words.In
Carew's mind the remembrance of the story of Kristel and Silvain was
very vivid."Were Eric and Emilius true friends?"Lauretta looked at him piteously; her lips quivered."They are
brothers," she said.She gazed at him in tender surprise; for weeks past he had not been so
happy.The trouble by which he had been haunted took flight."And yet," he could not help saying, "you have a secret, and you keep
it from me!"His voice was almost gay; there was no touch of reproach in it."The secret is not mine, Gabriel," she said, and she allowed him to
pass his arm around her; her head sank upon his breast."When you know
all, you will approve," she murmured."As I trust you, so must you
trust me."Their lips met; perfect confidence and faith were established between
them, although on Lauretta's side there had been no shadow on the love
she gave him.It was late in the afternoon when Carew was informed that Father
Daniel wished to speak to him privately.He kissed Lauretta and went
out to the priest, in whose face he saw a new horror."I should be the first to tell them," said Father Daniel in a husky
voice, "but I am not yet strong enough."No," replied the priest, "but Eric is.I would not have him removed
until the magistrate, who is absent and has been sent for, arrives.In a state of wonder Carew accompanied Father Daniel out of Doctor
Louis's house, and the priest led the way to the woods."We have passed the
house in which the brothers live."The sun was setting, and the light was quivering on the tops of the
distant trees.Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew plunged into the woods.There were scouts on the outskirts, to whom the priest said, "Has the
magistrate arrived?""No, father," was the answer, "we expect him every moment."From that moment until they arrived at the spot to which Father Daniel
led him, Carew was silent.What had passed between him and Lauretta
had so filled his soul with happiness that he bestowed but little
thought upon a vulgar intrigue between a peasant girl and men whom he
had long since condemned.They no longer troubled him; they had passed
for ever out of his life, and his heart was at rest.Father Daniel and
he walked some distance into the shadows of the forest and the night.Before him he saw lights in the hands of two villagers who had
evidently been stationed there to keep guard."Yes," he replied, "it is I."He conducted Gabriel Carew to a spot, and pointed downwards with his
finger; and there, prone and still upon the fallen leaves, lay the
body of Eric stone dead, stabbed to the heart!"Martin Hartog," said the priest, "is in custody on suspicion of this
ruthless murder.""What evidence is there to incriminate
him?""When the body was first discovered," said the priest, "your gardener
was standing by its side.Upon being questioned his answer was, 'If
judgment has not fallen upon the monster, it has overtaken his
brother.The brood should be wiped off the face of the earth.'Gabriel Carew was overwhelmed by the horror of this discovery.The
meeting between the brothers, of which he had been a secret witness on
the previous evening, and during which Eric had laid violent hands on
Emilius, recurred to him.He had not spoken of it, nor did he mention
it now.If Martin Hartog confessed his guilt
the matter was settled; if he did not, the criminal must be sought
elsewhere, and it would be his duty to supply evidence which would
tend to fix the crime upon Emilius.He did not believe Martin Hartog
to be guilty; he had already decided within himself that Emilius had
murdered Eric, and that the tragedy of Kristel and Silvain had been
repeated in the lives of Silvain's sons.There was a kind of
retribution in this which struck Gabriel Carew with singular force."Useless," he thought, "to fly from a fate which is preordained.When
he recovered from the horror which had fallen on him upon beholding
the body of Eric, he asked Father Daniel at what hour of the day the
unhappy man had been killed."That," said Father Daniel, "has yet to be determined.No doctor has
seen the body, but the presumption is that when Martin Hartog,
animated by his burning craving for vengeance, of which we were both a
witness, rushed from his cottage, he made his way to the woods, and
that he here unhappily met the brother of the man whom he believed to
be the betrayer of his daughter.The arrival of the magistrate put a stop to the conversation.He
listened to what Father Daniel had to relate, and some portions of the
priest's explanations were corroborated by Gabriel Carew.The
magistrate then gave directions that the body of Eric should be
conveyed to the courthouse; and he and the priest and Carew walked
back to the village together."The village will become notorious," he remarked."Is there an
epidemic of murder amongst us that this one should follow so closely
upon the heels of the other?"Then, after a pause, he asked Father
Daniel whether he believed Martin Hartog to be guilty."I believe no man to be guilty," said the priest, "until he is proved
so incontrovertibly."I bear in remembrance," said the magistrate, "that you would not
subscribe to the general belief in the hunchback's guilt.""Nor do I now," said Father Daniel."And you," said the magistrate, turning to Gabriel Carew, "do you
believe Hartog to be guilty?""This is not the time or place," said Carew, "for me to give
expression to any suspicion I may entertain.The first thing to be
settled is Hartog's complicity in this murder.""Father Daniel believes," continued Carew, "that Eric was murdered
to-day, within the last hour or two."The doctors will decide that," said the magistrate."If the deed was
not, in your opinion, perpetrated within the last few hours, when do
you suppose it was done?""Have you any distinct grounds for the belief?"You have asked me a question which I have answered.There is no
matter of absolute knowledge involved in it; if there were I should be
able to speak more definitely.Until the doctors pronounce there is
nothing more to be said.But I may say this: if Hartog is proved to be
innocent, I may have something to reveal in the interests of justice."The magistrate nodded and said, "By the way, where is Emilius, and
what has he to say about it?""Neither Eric nor Emilius," replied Father Daniel, "slept at home last
night, and since yesterday evening Emilius has not been seen.""Nothing is known of him," said Father Daniel."Inquiries have been
made, but nothing satisfactory has been elicited."The magistrate glanced at Carew, and for a little while was silent.Shortly after they reached the court-house the doctors presented their
report.In their opinion Eric had been dead at least fourteen or
fifteen hours, certainly for longer than twelve.This disposed of the
theory that he had been killed in the afternoon.Their belief was that
the crime was committed shortly after midnight.In that case Martin
Hartog must be incontestably innocent.He was able to account for
every hour of the previous day and night.He was out until near
midnight; he was accompanied home, and a friend sat up with him till
late, both keeping very quiet for fear of disturbing Patricia, who was
supposed to be asleep in her room, but who before that time had most
likely fled from her home.Moreover, it was proved that Martin Hartog
rose in the morning at a certain time, and that it was only then that
he became acquainted with the disappearance of his daughter.Father
Daniel and Gabriel Carew were present when the magistrate questioned
Hartog.The man seemed indifferent as to his fate, but he answered
quite clearly the questions put to him.He had not left his cottage
after going to bed on the previous night; he believed his daughter to
be in her room, and only this morning discovered his mistake.After
his interview with Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew he rushed from the
cottage in the hope of meeting with Emilius, whom he intended to kill;
he came upon the dead body of Eric in the woods, and his only regret
was that it was Eric and not Emilius."If the villain who has dishonoured me were here at this moment," said
Martin Hartog, "I would strangle him.No power should save him from my
just revenge!"The magistrate ordered him to be set at liberty, and he wandered out
of the court-house a hopeless and despairing man.Then the magistrate
turned to Carew, and asked him, now that Hartog was proved to be
innocent, what he had to reveal that might throw light upon the crime.Carew, after some hesitation, related what he had seen the night
before when Emilius and Eric were together in the forest."But," said the magistrate, "the brothers were known to be on the most
loving terms.""So," said Carew, "were their father, Silvain, and his brother Kristel
until a woman stepped between them.Upon this matter, however, it is
not for me to speak."I have heard something of the story of these hapless brothers," said
the magistrate, pondering, "but am not acquainted with all the
particulars.Carew then asked that he should be allowed to go for Doctor Louis, his
object being to explain to the doctor, on their way to the magistrate,
how it was that reference had been made to the story of Silvain and
Kristel which he had heard from the doctor's lips.He also desired to
hint to Doctor Louis that Lauretta might be in possession of
information respecting Eric and Emilius which might be useful in
clearing up the mystery."You have acted right," said Doctor Louis sadly to Gabriel Carew; "at
all risks justice must be done.And
is this to be the end of that fated family?I cannot believe that
Emilius can be guilty of a crime so horrible!"His distress was so keen that Carew himself, now that he was freed
from the jealousy by which he had been tortured with respect to
Lauretta, hoped also that Emilius would be able to clear himself of
the charge hanging over him.But when they arrived at the magistrate's
court they were confronted by additional evidence which seemed to tell
heavily against the absent brother.A witness had come forward who
deposed that, being out on the previous night very late, and taking a
short cut through the woods to his cottage, he heard voices of two men
which he recognised as the voices of Emilius and Eric.They were
raised in anger, and one--the witness could not say which--cried out,

"Well, kill me, for I do not wish to live!"Upon being asked why he did not interpose, his answer was that he did
not care to mix himself up with a desperate quarrel; and that as he
had a family he thought the best thing he could do was to hasten home
as quickly as possible.Having told all he knew he was dismissed, and
bade to hold himself in readiness to repeat his evidence on a future
occasion.Then the magistrate heard what Doctor Louis had to say, and summed up
the whole matter thus:

"The reasonable presumption is, that the brothers quarrelled over some
love affair with a person at present unknown; for although Martin
Hartog's daughter has disappeared, there is nothing as yet to connect
her directly with the affair.Whether premeditatedly, or in a fit of
ungovernable passion, Emilius killed his brother and fled.If he does
not present himself to-morrow morning in the village he must be sought
for.It was a melancholy night for all, to Carew in a lesser degree than to
the others, for the crime which had thrown gloom over the whole
village had brought ease to his heart.He saw now how unreasonable had
been his jealousy of the brothers, and he was disposed to judge them
more leniently.On that night Doctor Louis held a private conference with Lauretta,
and received from her an account of the unhappy difference between the
brothers.As Silvain and Kristel had both loved one woman, so had Eric
and Emilius, but in the case of the sons there had been no supplanting
of the affections.Emilius and Patricia had long loved each other, and
had kept their love a secret, Eric himself not knowing it.When
Emilius discovered that his brother loved Patricia his distress of
mind was very great, and it was increased by the knowledge that was
forced upon him that there was in Eric's passion for the girl
something of the fierce quality which had distinguished Kristel's
passion for Avicia.In his distress he had sought advice from
Lauretta, and she had undertaken to act as an intermediary, and to
endeavour to bring Eric to reason.On two or three occasions she
thought she had succeeded, but her influence over Eric lasted only as
long as he was in her presence.He made promises which he found it
impossible to keep, and he continued to hope against hope.Lauretta
did not know what had passed between the brothers on the previous
evening, in the interview of which I was a witness, but earlier in the
day she had seen Emilius, who had confided a secret to her keeping
which placed Eric's love for Patricia beyond the pale of hope.He was
secretly married to Patricia, and had been so for some time.When
Gabriel Carew heard this he recognised how unjust he had been towards
Emilius and Patricia in the construction he had placed upon their
secret interviews.Lauretta advised Emilius to make known his marriage
to Eric, and offered to reveal the fact to the despairing lover, but
Emilius would not consent to this being immediately done.He
stipulated that a week should pass before the revelation was made;
then, he said, it might be as well that all the world should know
it--a fatal stipulation, against which Lauretta argued in vain.Thus
it was that in the last interview between Eric and Lauretta, Eric was
still in ignorance of the insurmountable bar to his hopes.As it
subsequently transpired, Emilius had made preparations to remove
Patricia from Nerac that very night.Up to that point, and at that
time nothing more was known; but when Emilius was tried for the murder
Lauretta's evidence did not help to clear him, because it established
beyond doubt the fact of the existence of an animosity between the
brothers.On the day following the discovery of the murder, Emilius did not make
his appearance in the village, and officers were sent in search of
him.There was no clue as to the direction which he and Patricia had
taken, and the officers, being slow-witted, were many days before they
succeeded in finding him.Their statement, upon their return to Nerac
with their prisoner, was, that upon informing him of the charge
against him, he became violently agitated and endeavoured to escape.He denied that he made such an attempt, asserting that he was
naturally agitated by the awful news, and that for a few minutes he
scarcely knew what he was doing, but, being innocent, there was no
reason why he should make a fruitless endeavour to avoid an inevitable
inquiry into the circumstances of a most dreadful crime.No brother, he declared, had
ever been more fondly loved than Eric was by him, and he would have
suffered a voluntary death rather than be guilty of an act of violence
towards one for whom he entertained so profound an affection.In the
preliminary investigations he gave the following explanation of all
within his knowledge.What Lauretta had stated was true in every
particular; neither did he deny Carew's evidence nor the evidence of
the villager who had deposed that, late on the night of the murder,
high words had passed between him and Eric."The words," said Emilius, "'Well, kill me, for I do not wish to
live!'were uttered by my poor brother when I told him that Patricia
was my wife.For although I had not intended that this should be known
until a few days after my departure, my poor brother was so worked up
by his love for my wife, that I felt I dared not, in justice to him
and myself, leave him any longer in ignorance.For that reason, and
thus impelled, pitying him most deeply, I revealed to him the truth.Had the witness whose evidence, true as it is, seems to bear fatally
against me, waited and listened, he would have been able to testify in
my favour.My poor brother for a time was overwhelmed by the
revelation.His love for my wife perhaps did not die immediately away;
but, high-minded and honourable as he was, he recognised that to
persevere in it would be a guilty act.The force of his passion became
less; he was no longer violent--he was mournful.He even, in a
despairing way, begged my forgiveness, and I, reproachful that I had
not earlier confided in him, begged _his_ forgiveness for the
unconscious wrong I had done him.Then, after a while, we fell
into our old ways of love; tender words were exchanged; we clasped
each other's hand; we embraced.Truly you who hear me can scarcely
realise what Eric and I had always been to each other.More than
brothers--more like lovers.Heartbroken as he was at the conviction
that the woman he adored was lost to him, I was scarcely less
heartbroken that I had won her.And so, after an hour's loving
converse, I left him; and when we parted, with a promise to meet again
when his wound was healed, we kissed each other as we had done in the
days of our childhood."RICHARD CLAY AND SONS, LONDON AND BUNGAY.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Secret Inheritance  (Volume 2 of 3), by
B. L.The first mention of her is in "The True Relation," written by Captain
Smith in Virginia in 1608.In this narrative, as our readers have seen,
she is not referred to until after Smith's return from the captivity
in which Powhatan used him "with all the kindness he could devise."Her
name first appears, toward the close of the relation, in the following
sentence:

"Powhatan understanding we detained certain salvages, sent his daughter,
a child of tenne yeares old, which not only for feature, countenance,
and proportion, much exceedeth any of the rest of his people, but for
wit and spirit the only nonpareil of his country: this hee sent by his
most trusty messenger, called Rawhunt, as much exceeding in deformitie
of person, but of a subtill wit and crafty understanding, he with a long
circumstance told mee how well Powhatan loved and respected mee, and in
that I should not doubt any way of his kindness, he had sent his child,
which he most esteemed, to see mee, a Deere, and bread, besides for
a present: desiring mee that the Boy [Thomas Savage, the boy given by
Newport to Powhatan] might come again, which he loved exceedingly, his
little Daughter he had taught this lesson also: not taking notice at all
of the Indians that had been prisoners three daies, till that morning
that she saw their fathers and friends come quietly, and in good termes
to entreate their libertie."In the afternoon they [the friends of the prisoners] being gone, we
guarded them [the prisoners] as before to the church, and after prayer,
gave them to Pocahuntas the King's Daughter, in regard of her father's
kindness in sending her: after having well fed them, as all the time of
their imprisonment, we gave them their bows, arrowes, or what else
they had, and with much content, sent them packing: Pocahuntas, also we
requited with such trifles as contented her, to tel that we had used the
Paspaheyans very kindly in so releasing them."The next allusion to her is in the fourth chapter of the narratives
which are appended to the "Map of Virginia," etc.This was sent home by
Smith, with a description of Virginia, in the late autumn of 1608.It
was published at Oxford in 1612, from two to three years after Smith's
return to England.The appendix contains the narratives of several of
Smith's companions in Virginia, edited by Dr.In one of these is a brief reference to the above-quoted
incident.This Oxford tract, it is scarcely necessary to repeat, contains no
reference to the saving of Smith's life by Pocahontas from the clubs of
Powhatan.The next published mention of Pocahontas, in point of time, is in
Chapter X. and the last of the appendix to the "Map of Virginia," and is
Smith's denial, already quoted, of his intention to marry Pocahontas.In this passage he speaks of her as "at most not past 13 or 14 years of
age."If she was thirteen or fourteen in 1609, when Smith left Virginia,
she must have been more than ten when he wrote his "True Relation,"
composed in the winter of 1608, which in all probability was carried to
England by Captain Nelson, who left Jamestown June 2d.The next contemporary authority to be consulted in regard to Pocahontas
is William Strachey, who, as we have seen, went with the expedition of
Gates and Somers, was shipwrecked on the Bermudas, and reached Jamestown
May 23 or 24, 1610, and was made Secretary and Recorder of the colony
under Lord Delaware.Of the origin and life of Strachey, who was a
person of importance in Virginia, little is known.The better impression
is that he was the William Strachey of Saffron Walden, who was married
in 1588 and was living in 1620, and that it was his grandson of the same
name who was subsequently connected with the Virginia colony.He was,
judged by his writings, a man of considerable education, a good deal of
a pedant, and shared the credulity and fondness for embellishment of the
writers of his time.His connection with Lord Delaware, and his part
in framing the code of laws in Virginia, which may be inferred from
the fact that he first published them, show that he was a trusted and
capable man.William Strachey left behind him a manuscript entitled "The Historie of
Travaile into Virginia Britanica, &c., gathered and observed as well by
those who went first thither, as collected by William Strachey, gent.,
three years thither, employed as Secretaire of State."How long he
remained in Virginia is uncertain, but it could not have been "three
years," though he may have been continued Secretary for that period, for
he was in London in 1612, in which year he published there the laws of
Virginia which had been established by Sir Thomas Gates May 24, 1610,
approved by Lord Delaware June 10, 1610, and enlarged by Sir Thomas Dale
June 22, 1611.The "Travaile" was first published by the Hakluyt Society in 1849.When
and where it was written, and whether it was all composed at one time,
are matters much in dispute.The first book, descriptive of Virginia and
its people, is complete; the second book, a narration of discoveries in
America, is unfinished.That Strachey
made notes in Virginia may be assumed, but the book was no doubt written
after his return to England.[This code of laws, with its penalty of whipping and death for what are
held now to be venial offenses, gives it a high place among the Black
Codes.One clause will suffice:

"Every man and woman duly twice a day upon the first towling of the Bell
shall upon the working daies repaire unto the church, to hear divine
service upon pain of losing his or her allowance for the first omission,
for the second to be whipt, and for the third to be condemned to the
Gallies for six months.Likewise no man or woman shall dare to violate
the Sabbath by any gaming, publique or private, abroad or at home, but
duly sanctifie and observe the same, both himselfe and his familie, by
preparing themselves at home with private prayer, that they may be the
better fitted for the publique, according to the commandments of God,
and the orders of our church, as also every man and woman shall repaire
in the morning to the divine service, and sermons preached upon the
Sabbath day, and in the afternoon to divine service, and Catechism upon
paine for the first fault to lose their provision, and allowance for the
whole week following, for the second to lose the said allowance and also
to be whipt, and for the third to suffer death."]Was it written before or after the publication of Smith's "Map and
Description" at Oxford in 1612?The question is important, because
Smith's "Description" and Strachey's "Travaile" are page after page
literally the same.Commonly at that time
manuscripts seem to have been passed around and much read before they
were published.Purchas acknowledges that he had unpublished manuscripts
of Smith when he compiled his narrative.Did Smith see Strachey's
manuscript before he published his Oxford tract, or did Strachey enlarge
his own notes from Smith's description?It has been usually assumed
that Strachey cribbed from Smith without acknowledgment.If it were a
question to be settled by the internal evidence of the two accounts,
I should incline to think that Smith condensed his description from
Strachey, but the dates incline the balance in Smith's favor.Strachey in his "Travaile" refers sometimes to Smith, and always with
respect.It will be noted that Smith's "Map" was engraved and published
before the "Description" in the Oxford tract.Purchas had it, for he
says, in writing of Virginia for his "Pilgrimage" (which was published
in 1613):

"Concerning-the latter [Virginia], Capt.John Smith, partly by word
of mouth, partly by his mappe thereof in print, and more fully by a
Manuscript which he courteously communicated to mee, hath acquainted
me with that whereof himselfe with great perill and paine, had been
the discoverer."Strachey in his "Travaile" alludes to it, and pays a
tribute to Smith in the following: "Their severall habitations are more
plainly described by the annexed mappe, set forth by Capt.Smith, of
whose paines taken herein I leave to the censure of the reader to judge.Sure I am there will not return from thence in hast, any one who hath
been more industrious, or who hath had (Capt.Percie excepted)
greater experience amongst them, however misconstruction may traduce
here at home, where is not easily seen the mixed sufferances, both of
body and mynd, which is there daylie, and with no few hazards and hearty
griefes undergon."There are two copies of the Strachey manuscript.The one used by the
Hakluyt Society is dedicated to Sir Francis Bacon, with the title of
"Lord High Chancellor," and Bacon had not that title conferred on him
till after 1618.But the copy among the Ashmolean manuscripts at Oxford
is dedicated to Sir Allen Apsley, with the title of "Purveyor to His
Majestie's Navie Royall"; and as Sir Allen was made "Lieutenant of
the Tower" in 1616, it is believed that the manuscript must have been
written before that date, since the author would not have omitted the
more important of the two titles in his dedication.Strachey's prefatory letter to the Council, prefixed to his "Laws"
(1612), is dated "From my lodging in the Black Friars.At your best
pleasures, either to return unto the colony, or pray for the success of
it heere."In his letter he speaks of his experience in the Bermudas and
Virginia: "The full storie of both in due time [I] shall consecrate unto
your view.... Howbit since many impediments, as yet must detaine such
my observations in the shadow of darknesse, untill I shall be able to
deliver them perfect unto your judgments," etc.This is not, as has been assumed, a statement that the observations were
not written then, only that they were not "perfect"; in fact, they
were detained in the "shadow of darknesse" till the year 1849.Our
own inference is, from all the circumstances, that Strachey began his
manuscript in Virginia or shortly after his return, and added to it and
corrected it from time to time up to 1616.We are now in a position to consider Strachey's allusions to Pocahontas.The first occurs in his description of the apparel of Indian women:

"The better sort of women cover themselves (for the most part) all over
with skin mantells, finely drest, shagged and fringed at the skyrt,
carved and coloured with some pretty work, or the proportion of beasts,
fowle, tortayses, or other such like imagry, as shall best please or
expresse the fancy of the wearer; their younger women goe not shadowed
amongst their owne companie, until they be nigh eleaven or twelve
returnes of the leafe old (for soe they accompt and bring about the
yeare, calling the fall of the leaf tagnitock); nor are thev much
ashamed thereof, and therefore would the before remembered Pocahontas,
a well featured, but wanton yong girle, Powhatan's daughter, sometymes
resorting to our fort, of the age then of eleven or twelve yeares, get
the boyes forth with her into the markett place, and make them wheele,
falling on their hands, turning up their heeles upwards, whome she would
followe and wheele so herself, naked as she was, all the fort over;
but being once twelve yeares, they put on a kind of semecinctum lethern
apron (as do our artificers or handycrafts men) before their bellies,
and are very shamefac't to be seene bare.We have seene some use
mantells made both of Turkey feathers, and other fowle, so prettily
wrought and woven with threeds, that nothing could be discerned but the
feathers, which were exceedingly warme and very handsome."Strachey did not see Pocahontas.She did not resort to the camp after
the departure of Smith in September, 1609, until she was kidnapped by
Governor Dale in April, 1613.The
time mentioned by him of her resorting to the fort, "of the age then of
eleven or twelve yeares," must have been the time referred to by Smith
when he might have married her, namely, in 1608-9, when he calls her
"not past 13 or 14 years of age."The description of her as a "yong
girle" tumbling about the fort, "naked as she was," would seem to
preclude the idea that she was married at that time.The use of the word "wanton" is not necessarily disparaging, for
"wanton" in that age was frequently synonymous with "playful" and
"sportive"; but it is singular that she should be spoken of as "well
featured, but wanton."Strachey, however, gives in another place what is
no doubt the real significance of the Indian name "Pocahontas."He says:

"Both men, women, and children have their severall names; at first
according to the severall humor of their parents; and for the men
children, at first, when they are young, their mothers give them a name,
calling them by some affectionate title, or perhaps observing their
promising inclination give it accordingly; and so the great King
Powhatan called a young daughter of his, whom he loved well, Pocahontas,
which may signify a little wanton; howbeyt she was rightly called
Amonata at more ripe years."The polygamous Powhatan had a large
number of wives, but of all his women, his favorites were a dozen "for
the most part very young women," the names of whom Strachey obtained
from one Kemps, an Indian a good deal about camp, whom Smith certifies
was a great villain.Strachey gives a list of the names of twelve of
them, at the head of which is Winganuske.This list was no doubt written
down by the author in Virginia, and it is followed by a sentence,
quoted below, giving also the number of Powhatan's children.The
"great darling" in this list was Winganuske, a sister of Machumps,
who, according to Smith, murdered his comrade in the Bermudas.Strachey
writes:

"He [Powhatan] was reported by the said Kemps, as also by the Indian
Machumps, who was sometyme in England, and comes to and fro amongst us
as he dares, and as Powhatan gives him leave, for it is not otherwise
safe for him, no more than it was for one Amarice, who had his braynes
knockt out for selling but a baskett of corne, and lying in the English
fort two or three days without Powhatan's leave; I say they often
reported unto us that Powhatan had then lyving twenty sonnes and ten
daughters, besyde a young one by Winganuske, Machumps his sister, and a
great darling of the King's; and besides, younge Pocohunta, a daughter
of his, using sometyme to our fort in tymes past, nowe married to a
private Captaine, called Kocoum, some two years since."Does Strachey intend to say that
Pocahontas was married to an Iniaan named Kocoum?She might have been
during the time after Smith's departure in 1609, and her kidnapping
in 1613, when she was of marriageable age.We shall see hereafter that
Powhatan, in 1614, said he had sold another favorite daughter of his,
whom Sir Thomas Dale desired, and who was not twelve years of age, to
be wife to a great chief.The term "private Captain" might perhaps be
applied to an Indian chief.Smith, in his "General Historie," says
the Indians have "but few occasions to use any officers more than one
commander, which commonly they call Werowance, or Caucorouse, which is
Captaine."It is probably not possible, with the best intentions, to
twist Kocoum into Caucorouse, or to suppose that Strachey intended to
say that a private captain was called in Indian a Kocoum.Werowance
and Caucorouse are not synonymous terms.Werowance means "chief," and
Caucorouse means "talker" or "orator," and is the original of our word
"caucus."Either Strachey was uninformed, or Pocahontas was married to an
Indian--a not violent presumption considering her age and the fact
that war between Powhatan and the whites for some time had cut off
intercourse between them--or Strachey referred to her marriage with
Rolfe, whom he calls by mistake Kocoum.If this is to be accepted,
then this paragraph must have been written in England in 1616, and have
referred to the marriage to Rolfe it "some two years since," in 1614.That Pocahontas was a gentle-hearted and pleasing girl, and, through her
acquaintance with Smith, friendly to the whites, there is no doubt; that
she was not different in her habits and mode of life from other Indian
girls, before the time of her kidnapping, there is every reason to
suppose.It was the English who magnified the imperialism of her father,
and exaggerated her own station as Princess.She certainly put on no
airs of royalty when she was "cart-wheeling" about the fort.Nor
does this detract anything from the native dignity of the mature, and
converted, and partially civilized woman.We should expect there would be the discrepancies which have been
noticed in the estimates of her age.Powhatan is not said to have kept
a private secretary to register births in his family.If Pocahontas gave
her age correctly, as it appears upon her London portrait in 1616,
aged twenty-one, she must have been eighteen years of age when she was
captured in 1613 This would make her about twelve at the time of Smith's
captivity in 1607-8.There is certainly room for difference of opinion
as to whether so precocious a woman, as her intelligent apprehension of
affairs shows her to have been, should have remained unmarried till the
age of eighteen.In marrying at least as early as that she would have
followed the custom of her tribe.It is possible that her intercourse
with the whites had raised her above such an alliance as would be
offered her at the court of Werowocomoco.We are without any record of the life of Pocahontas for some years.The occasional mentions of her name in the "General Historie" are so
evidently interpolated at a late date, that they do not aid us.When
and where she took the name of Matoaka, which appears upon her London
portrait, we are not told, nor when she was called Amonata, as Strachey
says she was "at more ripe yeares."How she was occupied from the
departure of Smith to her abduction, we can only guess.To follow her
authentic history we must take up the account of Captain Argall and of
Ralph Hamor, Jr., secretary of the colony under Governor Dale.Captain Argall, who seems to have been as bold as he was unscrupulous
in the execution of any plan intrusted to him, arrived in Virginia
in September, 1612, and early in the spring of 1613 he was sent on an
expedition up the Patowomek to trade for corn and to effect a capture
that would bring Powhatan to terms.The Emperor, from being a friend,
had become the most implacable enemy of the English.Captain Argall
says: "I was told by certain Indians, my friends, that the great
Powhatan's daughter Pokahuntis was with the great King Potowomek,
whither I presently repaired, resolved to possess myself of her by any
stratagem that I could use, for the ransoming of so many Englishmen as
were prisoners with Powhatan, as also to get such armes and tooles as
he and other Indians had got by murther and stealing some others of our
nation, with some quantity of corn for the colonies relief."By the aid of Japazeus, King of Pasptancy, an old acquaintance and
friend of Argall's, and the connivance of the King of Potowomek,
Pocahontas was enticed on board Argall's ship and secured.Word was sent
to Powhatan of the capture and the terms on which his daughter would be
released; namely, the return of the white men he held in slavery, the
tools and arms he had gotten and stolen, and a great quantity of corn.Powhatan, "much grieved," replied that if Argall would use his daughter
well, and bring the ship into his river and release her, he would accede
to all his demands.Therefore, on the 13th of April, Argall repaired to
Governor Gates at Jamestown, and delivered his prisoner, and a few days
after the King sent home some of the white captives, three pieces, one
broad-axe, a long whip-saw, and a canoe of corn.Pocahontas, however,
was kept at Jamestown.Why Pocahontas had left Werowocomoco and gone to stay with Patowomek
we can only conjecture.It is possible that Powhatan suspected her
friendliness to the whites, and was weary of her importunity, and it may
be that she wanted to escape the sight of continual fighting, ambushes,
and murders.More likely she was only making a common friendly visit,
though Hamor says she went to trade at an Indian fair.The story of her capture is enlarged and more minutely related by Ralph
Hamor, Jr., who was one of the colony shipwrecked on the Bermudas in
1609, and returned to England in 1614, where he published (London, 1615)
"A True Discourse of Virginia, and the Success of the Affairs there
till the 18th of June, 1614."Hamor was the son of a merchant tailor in
London who was a member of the Virginia company.Hamor writes:

"It chanced Powhatan's delight and darling, his daughter Pocahuntas
(whose fame has even been spread in England by the title of Nonparella
of Firginia) in her princely progresse if I may so terme it, tooke some
pleasure (in the absence of Captaine Argall) to be among her friends at
Pataomecke (as it seemeth by the relation I had), implored thither as
shopkeeper to a Fare, to exchange some of her father's commodities for
theirs, where residing some three months or longer, it fortuned upon
occasion either of promise or profit, Captaine Argall to arrive there,
whom Pocahuntas, desirous to renew her familiaritie with the English,
and delighting to see them as unknown, fearefull perhaps to be
surprised, would gladly visit as she did, of whom no sooner had Captaine
Argall intelligence, but he delt with an old friend Iapazeus, how and
by what meanes he might procure her caption, assuring him that now or
never, was the time to pleasure him, if he intended indeede that love
which he had made profession of, that in ransome of hir he might redeeme
some of our English men and armes, now in the possession of her father,
promising to use her withall faire and gentle entreaty; Iapazeus well
assured that his brother, as he promised, would use her courteously,
promised his best endeavors and service to accomplish his desire, and
thus wrought it, making his wife an instrument (which sex have ever been
most powerful in beguiling inticements) to effect his plot which hee
had thus laid, he agreed that himself, his wife and Pocahuntas, would
accompanie his brother to the water side, whither come, his wife should
faine a great and longing desire to goe aboorde, and see the shippe,
which being there three or four times before she had never seene, and
should be earnest with her husband to permit her--he seemed angry with
her, making as he pretended so unnecessary request, especially being
without the company of women, which denial she taking unkindly,
must faine to weepe (as who knows not that women can command teares)
whereupon her husband seeming to pitty those counterfeit teares, gave
her leave to goe aboord, so that it would pleese Pocahuntas to accompany
her; now was the greatest labour to win her, guilty perhaps of her
father's wrongs, though not knowne as she supposed, to goe with her, yet
by her earnest persuasions, she assented: so forthwith aboord they went,
the best cheere that could be made was seasonably provided, to supper
they went, merry on all hands, especially Iapazeus and his wife, who to
expres their joy would ere be treading upon Captaine Argall's foot, as
who should say tis don, she is your own.Supper ended Pocahuntas was
lodged in the gunner's roome, but Iapazeus and his wife desired to have
some conference with their brother, which was onely to acquaint him by
what stratagem they had betraied his prisoner as I have already
related: after which discourse to sleepe they went, Pocahuntas nothing
mistrusting this policy, who nevertheless being most possessed with
feere, and desire of returne, was first up, and hastened Iapazeus to be
gon.Argall having secretly well rewarded him, with a small Copper
kittle, and some other les valuable toies so highly by him esteemed,
that doubtlesse he would have betraied his own father for them,
permitted both him and his wife to returne, but told him that for divers
considerations, as for that his father had then eigh [8] of our Englishe
men, many swords, peeces, and other tooles, which he hid at severall
times by trecherous murdering our men, taken from them which though
of no use to him, he would not redeliver, he would reserve Pocahuntas,
whereat she began to be exceeding pensive, and discontented, yet
ignorant of the dealing of Japazeus who in outward appearance was no les
discontented that he should be the meanes of her captivity, much adoe
there was to pursuade her to be patient, which with extraordinary
curteous usage, by little and little was wrought in her, and so to
Jamestowne she was brought."Smith, who condenses this account in his "General Historie," expresses
his contempt of this Indian treachery by saying: "The old Jew and his
wife began to howle and crie as fast as Pocahuntas."It will be noted
that the account of the visit (apparently alone) of Pocahontas and her
capture is strong evidence that she was not at this time married to
"Kocoum" or anybody else.Word was despatched to Powhatan of his daughter's duress, with a
demand made for the restitution of goods; but although this savage is
represented as dearly loving Pocahontas, his "delight and darling," it
was, according to Hamor, three months before they heard anything from
him.His anxiety about his daughter could not have been intense.He
retained a part of his plunder, and a message was sent to him that
Pocahontas would be kept till he restored all the arms.This answer pleased Powhatan so little that they heard nothing from him
till the following March.Then Sir Thomas Dale and Captain Argall, with
several vessels and one hundred and fifty men, went up to Powhatan's
chief seat, taking his daughter with them, offering the Indians a chance
to fight for her or to take her in peace on surrender of the stolen
goods.The Indians received this with bravado and flights of arrows,
reminding them of the fate of Captain Ratcliffe.The whites landed,
killed some Indians, burnt forty houses, pillaged the village, and went
on up the river and came to anchor in front of Matchcot, the Emperor's
chief town.Here were assembled four hundred armed men, with bows and
arrows, who dared them to come ashore.Ashore they went, and a palaver
was held.The Indians wanted a day to consult their King, after which
they would fight, if nothing but blood would satisfy the whites.Two of Powhatan's sons who were present expressed a desire to see their
sister, who had been taken on shore.When they had sight of her, and
saw how well she was cared for, they greatly rejoiced and promised to
persuade their father to redeem her and conclude a lasting peace.The
two brothers were taken on board ship, and Master John Rolfe and Master
Sparkes were sent to negotiate with the King.Powhatan did not show
himself, but his brother Apachamo, his successor, promised to use his
best efforts to bring about a peace, and the expedition returned to
Jamestown."Long before this time," Hamor relates, "a gentleman of approved
behaviour and honest carriage, Master John Rolfe, had been in love with
Pocahuntas and she with him, which thing at the instant that we were
in parlee with them, myselfe made known to Sir Thomas Dale, by a letter
from him [Rolfe] whereby he entreated his advice and furtherance to his
love, if so it seemed fit to him for the good of the Plantation, and
Pocahuntas herself acquainted her brethren therewith."Governor Dale
approved this, and consequently was willing to retire without other
conditions."The bruite of this pretended marriage [Hamor continues]
came soon to Powhatan's knowledge, a thing acceptable to him, as
appeared by his sudden consent thereunto, who some ten daies after sent
an old uncle of hirs, named Opachisco, to give her as his deputy in the
church, and two of his sonnes to see the mariage solemnized which was
accordingly done about the fifth of April [1614], and ever since we have
had friendly commerce and trade, not only with Powhatan himself, but
also with his subjects round about us; so as now I see no reason why the
collonie should not thrive a pace."This marriage was justly celebrated as the means and beginning of a firm
peace which long continued, so that Pocahontas was again entitled to the
grateful remembrance of the Virginia settlers.Already, in 1612, a plan
had been mooted in Virginia of marrying the English with the natives,
and of obtaining the recognition of Powhatan and those allied to him as
members of a fifth kingdom, with certain privileges.Cunega, the Spanish
ambassador at London, on September 22, 1612, writes: "Although some
suppose the plantation to decrease, he is credibly informed that there
is a determination to marry some of the people that go over to Virginia;
forty or fifty are already so married, and English women intermingle and
are received kindly by the natives.A zealous minister hath been wounded
for reprehending it."John Rolfe was a man of industry, and apparently devoted to the
welfare of the colony.He probably brought with him in 1610 his wife,
who gave birth to his daughter Bermuda, born on the Somers Islands at
the time of the shipwreck.Hamor gives
him the distinction of being the first in the colony to try, in 1612,
the planting and raising of tobacco."No man [he adds] hath labored to
his power, by good example there and worthy encouragement into England
by his letters, than he hath done, witness his marriage with Powhatan's
daughter, one of rude education, manners barbarous and cursed
generation, meerely for the good and honor of the plantation: and
least any man should conceive that some sinister respects allured him
hereunto, I have made bold, contrary to his knowledge, in the end of my
treatise to insert the true coppie of his letter written to Sir Thomas
Dale."The letter is a long, labored, and curious document, and comes nearer to
a theological treatise than any love-letter we have on record.Why Rolfe did not speak to Dale, whom he saw every day,
instead of inflicting upon him this painful document, in which the
flutterings of a too susceptible widower's heart are hidden under a
great resolve of self-sacrifice, is not plain.The letter protests in a tedious preamble that the writer is moved
entirely by the Spirit of God, and continues:

"Let therefore this my well advised protestation, which here I make
between God and my own conscience, be a sufficient witness, at the
dreadful day of judgment (when the secrets of all men's hearts shall be
opened) to condemne me herein, if my chiefest interest and purpose be
not to strive with all my power of body and mind, in the undertaking
of so weighty a matter, no way led (so far forth as man's weakness may
permit) with the unbridled desire of carnall affection; but for the good
of this plantation, for the honour of our countrie, for the glory of
God, for my owne salvation, and for the converting to the true knowledge
of God and Jesus Christ, an unbelieving creature, namely Pokahuntas.To whom my heartie and best thoughts are, and have a long time bin so
entangled, and inthralled in so intricate a laborinth, that I was even
awearied to unwinde myself thereout."Master Rolfe goes on to describe the mighty war in his meditations on
this subject, in which he had set before his eyes the frailty of mankind
and his proneness to evil and wicked thoughts.He is aware of God's
displeasure against the sons of Levi and Israel for marrying strange
wives, and this has caused him to look about warily and with good
circumspection "into the grounds and principall agitations which should
thus provoke me to be in love with one, whose education hath bin rude,
her manners barbarous, her generation accursed, and so discrepant in
all nurtriture from myselfe, that oftentimes with feare and trembling,
I have ended my private controversie with this: surely these are
wicked instigations, fetched by him who seeketh and delighteth in man's
distruction; and so with fervent prayers to be ever preserved from such
diabolical assaults (as I looke those to be) I have taken some rest."John journeyed to the bedroom.The good man was desperately in love and wanted to marry the Indian, and
consequently he got no peace; and still being tormented with her image,
whether she was absent or present, he set out to produce an ingenious
reason (to show the world) for marrying her.He continues:

"Thus when I thought I had obtained my peace and quietnesse, beholde
another, but more gracious tentation hath made breaches into my holiest
and strongest meditations; with which I have been put to a new triall,
in a straighter manner than the former; for besides the weary passions
and sufferings which I have dailey, hourely, yea and in my sleepe
indured, even awaking me to astonishment, taxing me with remissnesse,
and carelessnesse, refusing and neglecting to perform the duteie of a
good Christian, pulling me by the eare, and crying: Why dost thou not
indeavor to make her a Christian?And these have happened to my greater
wonder, even when she hath been furthest seperated from me, which
in common reason (were it not an undoubted work of God) might breede
forgetfulnesse of a far more worthie creature."He accurately describes the symptoms and appears to understand the
remedy, but he is after a large-sized motive:

"Besides, I say the holy Spirit of God hath often demanded of me, why I
was created?If not for transitory pleasures and worldly vanities, but
to labour in the Lord's vineyard, there to sow and plant, to nourish and
increase the fruites thereof, daily adding with the good husband in the
gospell, somewhat to the tallent, that in the ends the fruites may be
reaped, to the comfort of the labourer in this life, and his salvation
in the world to come.... Likewise, adding hereunto her great appearance
of love to me, her desire to be taught and instructed in the knowledge
of God, her capablenesse of understanding, her aptness and willingness
to receive anie good impression, and also the spirituall, besides her
owne incitements stirring me up hereunto."The "incitements" gave him courage, so that he exclaims: "Shall I be of
so untoward a disposition, as to refuse to lead the blind into the right
way?Shall I be so unnatural, as not to give bread to the hungrie, or
uncharitable, as not to cover the naked?"It wasn't to be thought of, such wickedness; and so Master Rolfe screwed
up his courage to marry the glorious Princess, from whom thousands
of people were afterwards so anxious to be descended.But he made the
sacrifice for the glory of the country, the benefit of the plantation,
and the conversion of the unregenerate, and other and lower motive
he vigorously repels: "Now, if the vulgar sort, who square all men's
actions by the base rule of their own filthinesse, shall tax or taunt
mee in this my godly labour: let them know it is not hungry appetite, to
gorge myselfe with incontinency; sure (if I would and were so sensually
inclined) I might satisfy such desire, though not without a seared
conscience, yet with Christians more pleasing to the eie, and less
fearefull in the offense unlawfully committed.Nor am I in so desperate
an estate, that I regard not what becometh of me; nor am I out of hope
but one day to see my country, nor so void of friends, nor mean in
birth, but there to obtain a mach to my great con'tent.... But shall it
please God thus to dispose of me (which I earnestly desire to fulfill
my ends before set down) I will heartily accept of it as a godly taxe
appointed me, and I will never cease (God assisting me) untill I have
accomplished, and brought to perfection so holy a worke, in which I will
daily pray God to bless me, to mine and her eternal happiness."It is to be hoped that if sanctimonious John wrote any love-letters to
Amonata they had less cant in them than this.But it was pleasing to Sir
Thomas Dale, who was a man to appreciate the high motives of Mr.In a letter which he despatched from Jamestown, June 18, 1614, to a
reverend friend in London, he describes the expedition when Pocahontas
was carried up the river, and adds the information that when she went on
shore, "she would not talk to any of them, scarcely to them of the best
sort, and to them only, that if her father had loved her, he would not
value her less than old swords, pieces, or axes; wherefore she would
still dwell with the Englishmen who loved her.""Powhatan's daughter [the letter continues] I caused to be carefully
instructed in Christian Religion, who after she had made some good
progress therein, renounced publically her countrey idolatry, openly
confessed her Christian faith, was, as she desired, baptized, and is
since married to an English Gentleman of good understanding (as by his
letter unto me, containing the reasons for his marriage of her you may
perceive), an other knot to bind this peace the stronger.Her father
and friends gave approbation to it, and her uncle gave her to him in
the church; she lives civilly and lovingly with him, and I trust will
increase in goodness, as the knowledge of God increaseth in her.She
will goe into England with me, and were it but the gayning of this one
soule, I will think my time, toile, and present stay well spent."Hamor also appends to his narration a short letter, of the same date
with the above, from the minister Alexander Whittaker, the genuineness
of which is questioned.In speaking of the good deeds of Sir Thomas Dale
it says: "But that which is best, one Pocahuntas or Matoa, the
daughter of Powhatan, is married to an honest and discreet English
Gentleman--Master Rolfe, and that after she had openly renounced her
countrey Idolatry, and confessed the faith of Jesus Christ, and was
baptized, which thing Sir Thomas Dale had laboured a long time to ground
her in."If, as this proclaims, she was married after her conversion,
then Rolfe's tender conscience must have given him another twist for
wedding her, when the reason for marrying her (her conversion) had
ceased with her baptism.His marriage, according to this, was a pure
work of supererogation.It took place about the 5th of April, 1614.It
is not known who performed the ceremony.How Pocahontas passed her time in Jamestown during the period of her
detention, we are not told.Conjectures are made that she was an inmate
of the house of Sir Thomas Dale, or of that of the Rev.Whittaker,
both of whom labored zealously to enlighten her mind on religious
subjects.She must also have been learning English and civilized ways,
for it is sure that she spoke our language very well when she went to
London.John Rolfe was also laboring for her conversion, and we may
suppose that with all these ministrations, mingled with her love of Mr.Rolfe, which that ingenious widower had discovered, and her desire to
convert him into a husband, she was not an unwilling captive.Whatever
may have been her barbarous instincts, we have the testimony of Governor
Dale that she lived "civilly and lovingly" with her husband.STORY OF POCAHONTAS, CONTINUED

Sir Thomas Dale was on the whole the most efficient and discreet
Governor the colony had had.One element of his success was no doubt the
change in the charter of 1609.By the first charter everything had
been held in common by the company, and there had been no division of
property or allotment of land among the colonists.Under the new regime
land was held in severalty, and the spur of individual interest began
at once to improve the condition of the settlement.The character of the
colonists was also gradually improving.They had not been of a sort
to fulfill the earnest desire of the London promoter's to spread vital
piety in the New World.A zealous defense of Virginia and Maryland,
against "scandalous imputation," entitled "Leah and Rachel; or, The
Two Fruitful Sisters," by Mr.John Hammond, London, 1656, considers
the charges that Virginia "is an unhealthy place, a nest of rogues,
abandoned women, dissolut and rookery persons; a place of intolerable
labour, bad usage and hard diet"; and admits that "at the first
settling, and for many years after, it deserved most of these
aspersions, nor were they then aspersions but truths.... There were
jails supplied, youth seduced, infamous women drilled in, the provision
all brought out of England, and that embezzled by the Trustees."Governor Dale was a soldier; entering the army in the Netherlands as a
private he had risen to high position, and received knighthood in 1606.Shortly after he was with Sir Thomas Gates in South Holland.The States
General in 1611 granted him three years' term of absence in Virginia.Upon his arrival he began to put in force that system of industry and
frugality he had observed in Holland.He had all the imperiousness of a
soldier, and in an altercation with Captain Newport, occasioned by some
injurious remarks the latter made about Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer,
he pulled his beard and threatened to hang him.Active operations for
settling new plantations were at once begun, and Dale wrote to Cecil,
the Earl of Salisbury, for 2,000 good colonists to be sent out, for the
three hundred that came were "so profane, so riotous, so full of mutiny,
that not many are Christians but in name, their bodies so diseased and
crazed that not sixty of them may be employed."He served afterwards
with credit in Holland, was made commander of the East Indian fleet in
1618, had a naval engagement with the Dutch near Bantam in 1619, and
died in 1620 from the effects of the climate.He was twice married, and
his second wife, Lady Fanny, the cousin of his first wife, survived him
and received a patent for a Virginia plantation.Governor Dale kept steadily in view the conversion of the Indians to
Christianity, and the success of John Rolfe with Matoaka inspired
him with a desire to convert another daughter of Powhatan, of whose
exquisite perfections he had heard.He therefore despatched Ralph Hamor,
with the English boy, Thomas Savage, as interpreter, on a mission to
the court of Powhatan, "upon a message unto him, which was to deale with
him, if by any means I might procure a daughter of his, who (Pocahuntas
being already in our possession) is generally reported to be his delight
and darling, and surely he esteemed her as his owne Soule, for surer
pledge of peace."This visit Hamor relates with great naivete.At his town of Matchcot, near the head of York River, Powhatan
himself received his visitors when they landed, with great cordiality,
expressing much pleasure at seeing again the boy who had been presented
to him by Captain Newport, and whom he had not seen since he gave him
leave to go and see his friends at Jamestown four years before; he also
inquired anxiously after Namontack, whom he had sent to King James's
land to see him and his country and report thereon, and then led the way
to his house, where he sat down on his bedstead side."On each hand of
him was placed a comely and personable young woman, which they called
his Queenes, the howse within round about beset with them, the outside
guarded with a hundred bowmen."The first thing offered was a pipe of tobacco, which Powhatan "first
drank," and then passed to Hamor, who "drank" what he pleased and then
returned it.The Emperor then inquired how his brother Sir Thomas Dale
fared, "and after that of his daughter's welfare, her marriage, his
unknown son, and how they liked, lived and loved together."Hamor
replied "that his brother was very well, and his daughter so well
content that she would not change her life to return and live with him,
whereat he laughed heartily, and said he was very glad of it."Powhatan then desired to know the cause of his unexpected coming, and
Mr.Hamor said his message was private, to be delivered to him without
the presence of any except one of his councilors, and one of the guides,
who already knew it.Therefore the house was cleared of all except the two Queens, who may
never sequester themselves, and Mr.First there
was a message of love and inviolable peace, the production of presents
of coffee, beads, combs, fish-hooks, and knives, and the promise of
a grindstone when it pleased the Emperor to send for it.Hamor then
proceeded:

"The bruite of the exquesite perfection of your youngest daughter, being
famous through all your territories, hath come to the hearing of your
brother, Sir Thomas Dale, who for this purpose hath addressed me hither,
to intreate you by that brotherly friendship you make profession of, to
permit her (with me) to returne unto him, partly for the desire which
himselfe hath, and partly for the desire her sister hath to see her of
whom, if fame hath not been prodigall, as like enough it hath not, your
brother (by your favour) would gladly make his nearest companion, wife
and bed fellow [many times he would have interrupted my speech, which
I entreated him to heare out, and then if he pleased to returne me
answer], and the reason hereof is, because being now friendly and firmly
united together, and made one people [as he supposeth and believes] in
the bond of love, he would make a natural union between us, principally
because himself hath taken resolution to dwel in your country so long as
he liveth, and would not only therefore have the firmest assurance hee
may, of perpetuall friendship from you, but also hereby binde himselfe
thereunto."Powhatan replied with dignity that he gladly accepted the salute of love
and peace, which he and his subjects would exactly maintain.But as to
the other matter he said: "My daughter, whom my brother desireth, I sold
within these three days to be wife to a great Weroance for two bushels
of Roanoke [a small kind of beads made of oyster shells], and it is true
she is already gone with him, three days' journey from me."Hamor persisted that this marriage need not stand in the way; "that if
he pleased herein to gratify his Brother he might, restoring the Roanoke
without the imputation of injustice, take home his daughter again, the
rather because she was not full twelve years old, and therefore not
marriageable; assuring him besides the bond of peace, so much the
firmer, he should have treble the price of his daughter in beads,
copper, hatchets, and many other things more useful for him."The reply of the noble old savage to this infamous demand ought to have
brought a blush to the cheeks of those who made it.He said he loved his
daughter as dearly as his life; he had many children, but he delighted
in none so much as in her; he could not live if he did not see her
often, as he would not if she were living with the whites, and he
was determined not to put himself in their hands.He desired no other
assurance of friendship than his brother had given him, who had already
one of his daughters as a pledge, which was sufficient while she lived;
"when she dieth he shall have another child of mine."And then he broke
forth in pathetic eloquence: "I hold it not a brotherly part of your
King, to desire to bereave me of two of my children at once; further
give him to understand, that if he had no pledge at all, he should not
need to distrust any injury from me, or any under my subjection; there
have been too many of his and my men killed, and by my occasion there
shall never be more; I which have power to perform it have said it; no
not though I should have just occasion offered, for I am now old and
would gladly end my days in peace; so as if the English offer me any
injury, my country is large enough, I will remove myself farther from
you."The old man hospitably entertained his guests for a day or two, loaded
them with presents, among which were two dressed buckskins, white as
snow, for his son and daughter, and, requesting some articles sent him
in return, bade them farewell with this message to Governor Dale: "I
hope this will give him good satisfaction, if it do not I will go three
days' journey farther from him, and never see Englishmen more."It
speaks well for the temperate habits of this savage that after he had
feasted his guests, "he caused to be fetched a great glass of sack, some
three quarts or better, which Captain Newport had given him six or seven
years since, carefully preserved by him, not much above a pint in all
this time spent, and gave each of us in a great oyster shell some three
spoonfuls."We trust that Sir Thomas Dale gave a faithful account of all this to his
wife in England.Sir Thomas Gates left Virginia in the spring of 1614 and never returned.After his departure scarcity and severity developed a mutiny, and six
of the settlers were executed.Rolfe was planting tobacco (he has the
credit of being the first white planter of it), and his wife was getting
an inside view of Christian civilization.In 1616 Sir Thomas Dale returned to England with his company and John
Rolfe and Pocahontas, and several other Indians.They reached Plymouth
early in June, and on the 20th Lord Carew made this note: "Sir Thomas
Dale returned from Virginia; he hath brought divers men and women of
thatt countrye to be educated here, and one Rolfe who married a daughter
of Pohetan (the barbarous prince) called Pocahuntas, hath brought his
wife with him into England."On the 22d Sir John Chamberlain wrote to
Sir Dudley Carlton that there were "ten or twelve, old and young, of
that country."The Indian girls who came with Pocahontas appear to have been a great
care to the London company.In May, 1620, is a record that the company
had to pay for physic and cordials for one of them who had been living
as a servant in Cheapside, and was very weak of a consumption.The same
year two other of the maids were shipped off to the Bermudas, after
being long a charge to the company, in the hope that they might there
get husbands, "that after they were converted and had children, they
might be sent to their country and kindred to civilize them."The attempt to educate them in England was not
very successful, and a proposal to bring over Indian boys obtained this
comment from Sir Edwin Sandys:

"Now to send for them into England, and to have them educated here, he
found upon experience of those brought by Sir Thomas Dale, might be far
from the Christian work intended."One Nanamack, a lad brought over by
Lord Delaware, lived some years in houses where "he heard not much of
religion but sins, had many times examples of drinking, swearing and
like evils, ran as he was a mere Pagan," till he fell in with a
devout family and changed his life, but died before he was baptized.Accompanying Pocahontas was a councilor of Powhatan, one Tomocomo, the
husband of one of her sisters, of whom Purchas says in his "Pilgrimes":
"With this savage I have often conversed with my good friend Master
Doctor Goldstone where he was a frequent geust, and where I have seen
him sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of
his country and religion.... Master Rolfe lent me a discourse which
I have in my Pilgrimage delivered.And his wife did not only accustom
herself to civility, but still carried herself as the daughter of a
king, and was accordingly respected, not only by the Company which
allowed provision for herself and her son, but of divers particular
persons of honor, in their hopeful zeal by her to advance Christianity.I was present when my honorable and reverend patron, the Lord Bishop of
London, Doctor King, entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond
what I had seen in his great hospitality offered to other ladies.At
her return towards Virginia she came at Gravesend to her end and grave,
having given great demonstration of her Christian sincerity, as the
first fruits of Virginia conversion, leaving here a goodly memory,
and the hopes of her resurrection, her soul aspiring to see and enjoy
permanently in heaven what here she had joyed to hear and believe of her
blessed Saviour.Not such was Tomocomo, but a blasphemer of what he knew
not and preferring his God to ours because he taught them (by his own
so appearing) to wear their Devil-lock at the left ear; he acquainted me
with the manner of that his appearance, and believed that their Okee or
Devil had taught them their husbandry."Upon news of her arrival, Captain Smith, either to increase his own
importance or because Pocahontas was neglected, addressed a letter or
"little booke" to Queen Anne, the consort of King James.This letter is
found in Smith's "General Historie" ( 1624), where it is introduced
as having been sent to Queen Anne in 1616.We find no mention of its receipt or of any acknowledgment of
it.Whether the "abstract" in the "General Historie" is exactly like
the original we have no means of knowing.We have no more confidence in
Smith's memory than we have in his dates.The letter is as follows:

"To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene Anne of Great Brittaine."The love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me
in the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee
presume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short
discourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,
I must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee
thankful."That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the
power of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage
exceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the
most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and
his sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,
being but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose
compassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause
to respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim
attendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I
cannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of
those my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After
some six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of
my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save
mine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was
safely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty
miserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those
large territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore
Commonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved."And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by
this Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant
Fortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not
spare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,
and our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to
imploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or
her extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am
sure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought
to surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not
affright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered
eies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:
which had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild
traine she as freely frequented, as her father's habitation: and during
the time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the
instrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter
confusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia
might have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since
then, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents
from that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and
troublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our
Colonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,
the Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last
rejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,
with whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of
that Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe
in mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly
considered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding."Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your
best leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done
in the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented
you from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet
I never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of
abilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,
her birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly
to beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be
from one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband's
estate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most
and least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried
it as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her
station: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome
may rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and
Christianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all
this good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should
doe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to
your servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare
her dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest
subjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious
hands."The passage in this letter, "She hazarded the beating out of her owne
braines to save mine," is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the
paragraph which speaks of "the exceeding great courtesie" of Powhatan;
and Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up
his

"General Historie."Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the
first three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to
New England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the
service she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect
of the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there
Smith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only
one we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she
had supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He
writes:

"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured
her face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband
with divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself
to have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to
talke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You
did promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to
you; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the
same reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I
durst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.With
a well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my
father's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and
fear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and
you shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your
contrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other
till I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek
you, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much."'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by
Powhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they
and their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make
notches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that
task.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him
to show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had
told so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had
heard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably
not coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was
convinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: "You gave
Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave
me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and "they
did think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen
many English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;" and
he heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,
as also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both
at the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but
the contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of
curiosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,
and the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's "Christmas his Mask" at court, January
6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain
writes to Carleton: "The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father
counsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and
her assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though
sore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away."Neill says that "after the first weeks of her residence in England
she does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter
writers," and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that "when they heard that
Rolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he
had not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian
princesse."His interest in the colony was never
the most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of
the Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The
King very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was
sure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, "but that
you know so well how he is affected to these toys."There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a
portrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is
translated: "Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,
Emperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died
on shipboard at Gravesend 1617."This is doubtless the portrait engraved
by Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the
London edition of the "General Historie," 1624.It is not probable that
the portrait was originally published with the "General Historie."The
portrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:

Round the portrait:

"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim."In the oval, under the portrait:

         "Aetatis suae 21 A.1616"
Below:

"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of
Attanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian
faith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his "History of Gravesend" says that everybody paid this
young lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have
sufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her
own country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the
English; and that she died, "giving testimony all the time she lay sick,
of her being a very good Christian."The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at
Gravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably
on the 21st of March, 1617.I have seen somewhere a statement, which
I cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George's Church,
where she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of
that church has this record:


       "1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe
        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent
     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried
          in ye chaunncle."Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State
Papers, dated "1617, 29 March, London," that her death occurred March
21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became
Governor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that
unscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the
company.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: "We cannot
imagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives
have given the country to Mr.Rolfe's child, and that they reserve it
from all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some
do here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for
yourself."It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that
Lady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe's hands
in Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and
Mr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late "Lord Deleware had
come into Rolfe's possession and get satisfaction of him."This George
Sandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish
Empire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book
written in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid's
"Metamorphosis."John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his
marriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his
brother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be
converted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own
indemnity for having brought up John's child by Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas
to the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil
practices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle
Henry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned
to Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his
application to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the
Indian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only
daughter who was married, says Stith (1753), "to Col.John Bolling; by
whom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father
to the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to
Col.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"
says that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an
esteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,
grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the
great granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with
fighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;
his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,
and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and
conquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not
defined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the
Potomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he
alternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of
which at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey
(York) River.He is said
to have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the
youngest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his
harem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into
all his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to
select.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:
"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold
and stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes
and attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is
supposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how
much more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a
sad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,
hanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so
on his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,
vigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath
been, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and
that to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,
as also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in
security and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions
of peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is
likewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives
whom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,
presenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,
or tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on
burning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.And even now, in later times
          (As travelers find in distant climes),
    Some savage tribes on plain and hill
    Can make it interesting still."Another spoke: "A scene like this,
    Reminds me of that valiant Swiss,
    Who in the dark and trying hour
    Revealed such nerve and matchless power,
          And from the head of his brave son
          The apple shot, and freedom won!While such a chance is offered here,
          We'll find the bows that must be near,
          And as an hour or two of night
          Will bring us 'round the morning light,
          We'll take such targets as we may,
            To safer haunts, some miles away.Then at our leisure we can shoot
            At bull's-eyes round or luscious fruit,
            Till like the Swiss of olden time,
            With steady nerves and skill sublime,
            Each one can split an apple fair
            On every head that offers there."[Illustration]

    Now buildings that were fastened tight
    Against the prowlers of the night,
    At the wee Brownies' touch and call
    Soon opened and surrendered all.So some with bulky targets strode,
    That made for eight or ten a load.And called for engineering skill
    To steer them up or down the hill;
    Some carried bows of rarest kind,
    That reached before and trailed behind.The English "self-yew" bow was there,
    Of nicest make and "cast" so rare,
    Well tipped with horn, the proper thing,
    With "nocks," or notches, for the string.Still others formed an "arrow line"
    That bristled like the porcupine.[Illustration]

    When safe within the forest shade,
    The targets often were displayed.At first, however near they stood,
    Some scattered trouble through the wood.The trees were stripped of leaves and bark,
    With arrows searching for the mark.The hares to other groves withdrew,
    And frighted birds in circles flew.But practice soon improves the art
        Of all, however dull or smart;
                             And there they stood to do their best,
                             And let all other pleasures rest,
                             While quickly grew their skill and power,
                             And confidence, from hour to hour.[Illustration]

    When targets seemed too plain or wide,
    A smaller mark the Brownies tried.By turns each member took his stand
    And risked his head to serve the band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For volunteers would bravely hold
    A pumpkin till in halves it rolled;
    And then a turnip, quince, or pear,
    Would next be shot to pieces there;
    Till not alone the apples flew
    In halves before their arrows true,
    But even plums and cherries too.For Brownies, as we often find,
    Can soon excel the human kind,
    And carry off with effort slight
    The highest praise and honors bright.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES FISHING.[Illustration]

    When glassy lakes and streams about
    Gave up their bass and speckled trout,
    The Brownies stood by water clear
    As shades of evening gathered near.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                          Said one: "Now country lads begin
                          To trim the rod and bend the pin
                          To catch the frogs and minnows spry
                          That in the brooks and ditches lie.While city chaps with reels come down,
                          And line enough to gird the town,
                          And flies of stranger shape and hue
                          Than ever Mother Nature knew--
                          With horns like crickets, tails like mice,
                          And plumes like birds of Paradise.Thus well prepared for sunny sky
              Or cloudy weather, wet or dry,
              They take the fish from stream and pool
              By native art and printed rule."Another said: "With peeping eyes
              I've watched an angler fighting flies,
              And thought, when thus he stood to bear
              The torture from those pests of air,
              There must indeed be pleasure fine
              Behind the baited hook and line.Now, off like arrows from the bow
    In search of tackle some must go;
    While others stay to dig supplies
    Of bait that anglers highly prize,--
    Such kind as best will bring the pout
    The dace, the chub, and'shiner' out;
    While locusts gathered from the grass
    Will answer well for thorny bass."Then some with speed for tackle start,
    And some to sandy banks depart,
              And some uplift a stone or rail
              In search of cricket, grub, or snail;
    While more in dewy meadows draw
    The drowsy locust from the straw.Nor is it long before the band
    Stands ready for the sport in hand.It seemed the time of all the year
    When fish the starving stage were near:
              They rose to straws and bits of bark,
              To bubbles bright and shadows dark,
              And jumped at hooks, concealed or bare,
              While yet they dangled in the air.Some Brownies many trials met
              Almost before their lines were wet;
              For stones below would hold them fast,
    And limbs above would stop the cast,
    And hands be forced to take a rest,
    At times when fish were biting best.Some stumbled in above their boots,
    And others spoiled their finest suits;
    But fun went on; for many there
    Had hooks that seemed a charm to bear,
    And fish of various scale and fin
    On every side were gathered in.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The catfish left his bed below,
    With croaks and protests from the go;
    And nerve as well as time it took
    From such a maw to win the hook.With horns that pointed every way,
    And life that seemed to stick and stay,
    Like antlered stag that stands at bay,
    He lay and eyed the Brownie band,
    And threatened every reaching hand.The gamy bass, when playing fine,
    Oft tried the strength of hook and line,
    And strove an hour before his mind
    To changing quarters was resigned.Some eels proved more than even match
    For those who made the wondrous catch,
        And, like a fortune won with ease,
        They slipped through fingers by degrees,
        And bade good-bye to margin sands,
        In spite of half a dozen hands.The hungry, wakeful birds of air
        Soon gathered 'round to claim their share,
        And did for days themselves regale
        On fish of every stripe and scale.Thus sport went on with laugh and shout,
        As hooks went in and fish came out,
        While more escaped with wounded gill,
        And yards of line they're trailing still;
        But day at length began to break,
        And forced the Brownies from the lake.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AT NIAGARA FALLS.[Illustration]

    The Brownies' Band, while passing through
    The country with some scheme in view,
    Paused in their race, and well they might,
    When broad Niagara came in sight.Said one: "Give ear to what I say,
    I've been a traveler in my day;
    I've waded through Canadian mud
    To Montmorenci's tumbling flood.Niagara is the fall
    That truly overtops them all--
    The children prattle of its tide,
    And age repeats its name with pride
    The school-boy draws it on his slate,
    The preacher owns its moral weight;
    The tourist views it dumb with awe,
    The Indian paints it for his squaw,
    And tells how many a warrior true
    Went o'er it in his bark canoe,
    And never after friend or foe
    Got sight of man or boat below."Another said: "The Brownie Band
    Upon the trembling brink may stand,
    Where kings and queens have sighed to be,
    But dare not risk themselves at sea."[Illustration]

        Some played along the shelving ledge
        That beetled o'er the river's edge;
        Some gazed in meditation deep
        Upon the water's fearful leap;
        Some went below, to crawl about
        Behind the fall, that shooting out
        Left space where they might safely stand
        And view the scene so wild and grand.Some climbed the trees of cedar kind,
        That o'er the rushing stream inclined,
    To find a seat, to swing and frisk
    And bend the boughs at fearful risk;
    Until the rogues could dip and lave
    Their toes at times beneath the wave.Still more and more would venture out
        In spite of every warning shout.At last the weight that dangled there
        Was greater than the tree could bear.And then the snapping roots let go
        Their hold upon the rocks below,
        And leaping out away it rode
        Upon the stream with all its load!Then shouts that rose above the roar
        Went up from tree-top, and from shore,
        When it was thought that half the band
        Was now forever leaving land.It chanced, for reasons of their own,
        Some men around that tree had thrown
        A lengthy rope that still was strong
        And stretching fifty feet along.Before it disappeared from sight,
        The Brownies seized it in their might,
        And then a strain for half an hour
        Went on between the mystic power
        Of Brownie hands united all,
        And water rushing o'er the fall.But true to friends the
        Brownies strained,
        And inch by inch the tree was gained.Across the awful bend it passed
        With those in danger clinging fast,
        And soon it reached the rocky shore
        With all the Brownies safe once more.And then, as morning showed her face,
        The Brownies hastened from the place.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' GARDEN.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                One night, as spring began to show
                In buds above and blades below,
                The Brownies reached a garden square
                That seemed in need of proper care.Said one, "Neglected ground like this
                Must argue some one most remiss,
                Or beds and paths would here be found
                Instead of rubbish scattered round.Old staves, and boots, and woolen strings,
                With bottles, bones, and wire-springs,
    Are quite unsightly things to see
    Where tender plants should sprouting be.This work must be progressing soon,
    If blossoms are to smile in June."A second said, "Let all give heed:
    On me depend to find the seed.For, thanks to my foreseeing mind,
    To merchants' goods we're not confined.Last autumn, when the leaves grew sere
    And birds sought regions less severe,
    One night through gardens fair I sped,
    And gathered seeds from every bed;
    Then placed them in a hollow tree,
    Where still they rest.So trust to me
    To bring supplies, while you prepare
    The mellow garden-soil with care."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Another cried, "While some one goes
    To find the shovels, rakes, and hoes,
    That in the sheds are stowed away,
    We'll use this plow as best we may.Our arms, united at the chain,
                Will not be exercised in vain,
                But, as if colts were in the trace,
    We'll make it dance around the place.I know how deep the share should go,
    And how the sods to overthrow.So not a patch of ground the size
    Of this old cap, when flat it lies,
    But shall attentive care receive,
                    And be improved before we leave."Then some to guide the plow began,
                    Others the walks and beds to plan.And soon they gazed with anxious eyes
                    For those who ran for seed-supplies.But, when they came, one had his say,
                    And thus explained the long delay:
                    "A woodchuck in the tree had made
                    His bed just where the seeds were laid.We wasted half an hour at least
                    In striving to dislodge the beast;
          Until at length he turned around,
          Then, quick as thought, without a sound,
          And ere he had his bearings got,
          The rogue was half across the lot."Then seed was sown in various styles,
    In circles, squares, and single files;
    While here and there, in central parts,
    They fashioned diamonds, stars, and hearts,
    Some using rake, some plying hoe,
    Some making holes where seed should go;
    While some laid garden tools aside
    And to the soil their hands applied.To stakes and racks more were assigned,
    That climbing-vines support might find.Cried one, "Here, side by side, will stand
    The fairest flowers in the land.The thrifty bees for miles around
    Ere long will seek this plot of ground,
    And be surprised to find each morn
    New blossoms do each bed adorn.And in their own peculiar screed
    Will bless the hands that sowed the seed."And while that night they labored there,
    The cunning rogues had taken care
    With sticks and strings to nicely frame
    In line the letters of their name.That when came round the proper time
    For plants to leaf and vines to climb,
    The Brownies would remembered be,
    If people there had eyes to see.But morning broke (as break it will
    Though one's awake or sleeping still),
    And then the seeds on every side
    The hurried Brownies scattered wide.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration: BROWNIE]

    Along the road and through the lane
    They pattered on the ground like rain,
    Where Brownies, as away they flew,
    Both right and left full handfuls threw,
    And children often halted there
    To pick the blossoms, sweet and fair,
    That sprung like daisies from the mead
    Where fleeing Brownies flung the seed.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' CELEBRATION.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        One night the Brownies reached a mound
        That rose above the country round.Said one, as seated on the place
        He glanced about with thoughtful face:
        "If almanacs have matters right
    The Fourth begins at twelve to-night,--
    A fitting time for us to fill
    Yon cannon there and shake the hill,
    And make the people all about
    Think war again has broken out.I know where powder may be found
              Both by the keg and by the pound;
              Men use it in a tunnel near
              For blasting purposes, I hear.To get supplies all hands will go,
    And when we come we'll not be slow
    To teach the folks the proper way
    To honor Independence Day."Then from the muzzle broke the flame,
                And echo answered to the sound
                That startled folk for miles around.'Twas lucky for the Brownies' Band
                They were not of the mortal brand,
                Or half the crew would have been hurled
                In pieces to another world.For when at last the cannon roared,
                So huge the charge had Brownies poured,
    The metal of the gun rebelled
    And threw all ways the load it held.The pieces clipped the daisy-heads
    And tore the tree-tops into shreds.But Brownies are not slow to spy
    A danger, as are you and I.[Illustration:

                For they through strange and mystic art
                Observed it as it flew apart,
                And ducked and dodged and flattened out,
                To shun the fragments flung about.Some rogues were lifted from their feet
    And, turning somersaults complete,
    Like leaves went twirling through the air
    But only to receive a scare;
    And ere the smoke away had cleared
    In forest shade they disappeared.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE SWIMMING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies passed along the street,
    Commenting on the summer's heat
    That wrapped the city day and night,
    A swimming-bath appeared in sight.Said one: "Of all the sights we've found,
    Since we commenced to ramble round,
    This seems to better suit the band
    Than anything, however grand.We'll rest awhile and find our way
    Inside the place without delay,
    And those who understand the art,
    Can knowledge to the rest impart;
        For every one should able be,
        To swim, in river, lake, or sea.We never know how soon we may,
        See some one sinking in dismay,--
        And then, to have the power to save
    A comrade from a watery grave,
    Will be a blessing sure to give
    Us joy the longest day we live."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The doors soon opened through the power
    That lay in Brownie hands that hour.When once within the fun began,
    As here and there they quickly ran;
    Some up the stairs made haste to go,
    Some into dressing-rooms below,
    In bathing-trunks to reappear
    And plunge into the water clear;
    Some from the spring-board leaping fair
    Would turn a somersault in air;
    More to the bottom like a stone,
    Would sink as soon as left alone,
    While others after trial brief
    Could float as buoyant as a leaf.[Illustration]

    Some all their time to others gave
    Assisting them to ride the wave,
    Explaining how to catch the trick,
    Both how to strike and how to kick;
    And still keep nose above the tide,
    That lungs with air might be supplied.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Thus diving in and climbing out,
    Or splashing round with laugh and shout,
    The happy band in water played
    As long as Night her scepter swayed.They heard the clocks in chapel towers
    Proclaim the swiftly passing hours.But when the sun looked from his bed
    To tint the eastern sky with red,
    In haste the frightened Brownies threw
    Their clothes about them and withdrew.[Illustration: TIME FLIES]




THE BROWNIES [Illustration] AND THE WHALE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As Brownies chanced at eve to stray
    Around a wide but shallow bay,
    Not far from shore, to their surprise,
    They saw a whale of monstrous size,
      That, favored by the wind and tide,
      Had ventured in from ocean wide,
      But waves receding by-and-by,
      Soon left him with a scant supply.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            At times, with flaps and lunges strong
            He worked his way some yards along,
            Till on a bar or sandy marge
            He grounded like a leaden barge."A chance like this for all the band,"
            Cried one, "but seldom comes to hand.I know the bottom of this bay
            Like those who made the coast survey.'Tis level as a threshing-floor
            And shallow now from shore to shore;
            That creature's back will be as dry
    As hay beneath a                  tropic sky,
    Till morning tide                 comes full and free
    And gives him aid                 to reach the sea."another cried;
    "Let all make haste               to gain his side
            Then clamber up as best we may,
            And ride him round till break of day."At once, the band in great delight
                         Went splashing through the water bright,
                         And soon to where he rolled about
                         They lightly swam, or waded out.Now climbing up, the Brownies tried
            To take position for the ride.Some lying down a hold maintained;
            More, losing place as soon as gained,
            Were forced a dozen times to scale
            The broad side of the stranded whale.Now half-afloat and half-aground
            The burdened monster circled round,
    Still groping clumsily about
    As if to find the channel out,
    And Brownies clustered close, in fear
    That darker moments might be near.And soon the dullest in the band
    Was sharp enough to understand
    The creature was no longer beached,
    But deeper water now had reached.For plunging left, or plunging right,
    Or plowing downward in his might,
    The fact was plain, as plain could be--
    The whale was working out to sea![Illustration]

    A creeping fear will seize the mind
    As one is leaving shores behind,
    And knows the bark whereon he sails
    Is hardly fit to weather gales.Soon Fancy, with a graphic sweep,
    Portrays the nightmares of the deep;
    While they can see, with living eye,
    The terrors of the air sweep by.[Illustration]

        For who would not a fierce bird dread,
        If it came flying at his head?And these were hungry, squawking things,
        With open beaks and flapping wings.They made the Brownies dodge and dip,
        Into the sea they feared to slip.The birds they viewed with chattering teeth,
    Yet dreaded more the foes beneath.The lobster, with his ready claw;
    The fish with sword, the fish with saw;
    The hermit-crab, in coral hall,
    Averse to every social call;
    The father-lasher, and the shrimp,
    The cuttle-fish, or ocean imp,
    All these increase the landsman's fright,
    As shores are fading out of sight.Such fear soon gained complete command
    Of every Brownie in the band.They looked behind, where fair and green
    The grassy banks and woods were seen.They looked ahead, where white and cold
    The foaming waves of ocean rolled,
    And then, with woful faces drew
    Comparisons between the two.[Illustration]

    Some blamed themselves for action rash
    Against all reason still to dash
    In danger's way, and never think
    Until they stood on ruin's brink.While others threw the blame on those
    Who did the risky trip propose.But meantime deep and deeper still
    The whale was settling down until
    His back looked like an island small
    That scarce gave standing-room to all.But, when their chance seemed slight indeed
    To sport again o'er dewy mead,
    The spouting whale, with movement strong,
    Ran crashing through some timbers long
    That lumbermen had strongly tied
    In cribs and rafts, an acre wide.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    'Twas then, in such a trying hour,
    The Brownies showed their nerve and power.The diving whale gave little time
    For them to choose a stick to climb,--
    But grips were strong; no hold was lost,
    However high the logs were tossed;
    By happy chance the boom remained
    That to the nearest shore was chained,
    And o'er that bridge the Brownies made
    A safe retreat to forest shade.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' KITES.[Illustration]

    The sun had hardly taken flight
    Unto the deepest caves of night;
    Or fowls secured a place of rest
    Where Reynard's paw could not molest,
    When Brownies gathered to pursue
    Their plans regarding pleasures new.Said one: "In spite of hand or string,
        Now hats fly round like crows in spring,
        Exposing heads to gusts of air,
    That ill the slightest draught can bear;
    While, high above the tallest tower,
    At morning, noon, and evening hour,
    The youngsters' kites with streaming tails
    Are riding out the strongest gales.The doves in steeples hide away
        Or keep their houses through the day,
        Mistaking every kite that flies
        For bird of prey of wondrous size."[Illustration]

        "You're not alone," another cried,
        "In taking note.I, too, have spied
        The boys of late, in street and court,
        Or on the roofs, at this fine sport;
        But yesternight I chanced to see
        A kite entangled in a tree.The string was nowhere to be found;
        The tail about a bough was wound.Some birds had torn the paper out,
        To line their nests, in trees about,
        But there beside the wreck I staid,
        Until I learned how kites are made.On me you safely may depend,
        To show the way to cut and bend.So let us now, while winds are high,
        Our hands at once to work apply;
        And from the hill that lifts its crown
        So far above the neighboring town,
        We'll send our kites aloft in crowds,
        To lose themselves among the clouds."A smile on every face was spread,
        At thought of fun like this, ahead;
        And quickly all the plans were laid,
        And work for every Brownie made.Some to the kitchens ran in haste,
        To manufacture pots of paste.Some ran for tacks or shingle-nails,
        And some for rags to make the tails,
        While more with loads of paper came,
        Or whittled sticks to make the frame.The strings, that others gathered, soon
        Seemed long enough to reach the moon.But where such quantities they found,
        'Tis not so easy to expound;--
        Perhaps some twine-shop, standing nigh,
        Was raided for the large supply;
        Perhaps some youthful angler whines
        About his missing fishing-lines.But let them find                   things where they will,
    The Brownies must                   be furnished still;
    And those who can't                 such losses stand,
    Will have to charge                 it to the Band.With busy fingers,                  well applied,
    They clipped and                    pasted, bent and tied;
    With paint and                      brush some ran about
    From kite to kite,                  to fit them out.On some they paint                  a visage fair,
    While others would                  affright a bear,
        Nor was it long (as one might guess
        Who knows what skill their hands possess)
        Before the kites, with string and tail,
        Were all prepared to ride the gale;
        And oh, the climax of their glee
        Was reached when kites were floating free!So quick they mounted through the air
        That tangling strings played mischief there,
    And threatened to remove from land
    Some valued members of the band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The birds of night were horrified
    At finding kites on every side,
    And netted strings, that seemed to be
    Designed to limit action free.But Brownies stood or ran about,
    Now winding up, now letting out;
    Now giving kites more tail or wing,
    Now wishing for a longer string;
    Until they saw the hints of day
    Approaching through the morning gray.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' DANCING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

    When flitting bats commenced to wheel
    Around the eaves to find their meal,
    And owls to hoot in forests wide,
    To call their owlets to their side,
    The Brownie Band, in full array,
    Through silent streets pursued their way.But as they neared a building high,
    Surprise was shown in every eye.They heard the strains of music sweet,
    And tripping of the dancers' feet;
    While o'er the tap of heel and toe,
    The twang of harp and scrape of bow,
    Arose the clear and ringing call
    Of those who had control of all.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The Brownies slackened their swift pace,
    Then gathered closely round the place,
            To study out some way to win
            A peep or two at those within.Said one: "In matters of this kind
            Opinions differ, you will find.And some might say, with sober thought,
            That children should not thus be taught
            To hop around on toe and heel
            So actively to fiddle's squeal,
                For fear 'twould turn their minds away
                From graver duties of the day."Another said: "The dancing art
                Doth ease to every move impart.It gives alike to city-bred
                And country-born a graceful tread,
            And helps them bear themselves along
            Without offense in greatest throng.The nimble step, the springing knee,
    And balanced body all agree.The feet, my friends, may glide with grace
    As well as trudge from place to place.And in the parlor or without
    They best can stand or walk about
    Who found in early life a chance
    To mingle in the sprightly dance."[Illustration]

    The Brownies need no ladders long,
    No hoists, nor elevators strong,
    To lift them to an upper flight,
    A window-sill, or transom light.The weather-vane upon the spire,
    That overlooks the town entire,
    Is not too high above the base
    If fancy leads them to the place.'Tis said the very fleecy clouds
    They can bestride in eager crowds,
    Around the world their way to find,
    And leave the lagging winds behind.Said one: "We've scaled the dizzy heights
    Of mountain-peaks on other nights,
    And crossed the stream from shore to shore
    Where but the string-piece stretched before;
    And cunning Brownies, never fear,
    Will find some way to enter here."[Illustration]

    When once the Brownies' plans were laid,
    No formal, tiresome speech was made.In mystic ways, to Brownies known,
    They clambered up the walls of stone.They clung to this and that, like briers,
    They climbed the smooth electric wires;
    Some members lending ready aid
    To those who weaker nerves displayed.And in five minutes at the most,
    By vine, by bracket, and by post,
    By every scroll, and carving bold,
    That toes could touch or fingers hold
    They made their way, and gained a chance
    To view, unnoticed, every dance.Said one: "How pleasant is the sight
    To see those children young and bright
    While skipping blithely to and fro,
    Now joined in pairs, now in a row,
    Or formed in circles, hand in hand,
    And lightly moving at command--

[Illustration]

        Like butterflies through balmy air
        When summer spreads attractions fair,
    And blends with every whispering breeze
    The drowsy hum of working bees."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Another said: "When this is o'er
    The Brownie Band will take the floor.We'll bide our time and not be slow
            To take possession when they go.Then up and down the spacious hall
              We'll imitate the steps of all.We'll show that not in Frenchmen's bones
              Lies all the grace that nature owns;
              That others at the waltz can shine
              As well as Germans from the Rhine;
            That we some capers can enjoy
            As well as natives of Savoy."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            While thus they talked, the moments flew,
            And soon the master's task was through.When children's cloaks were wrapped around,
    And heavier shoes their feet had found
    They hastened home; but while they slept
    The Brownies in that building crept
    To take their turn at lively reel,
            At graceful glide, or dizzy wheel,
            Till all the dances people know,
              From Cuba's palms to Russia's snow
              Were tried, and soon in every case
              Were mastered with surprising grace.Imagine how they skipped about,
              And how they danced, with laugh and shout![Illustration]

[Illustration]

    No sooner had the Brownies run
    Into the hall than 'twas begun.Some round the harp, with cunning stroke,
    The music in the strings awoke.The violins to others fell,
    Who scraped, and sawed, and fingered well,
    Until the sweet and stirring air
    Would rouse the feet of dullest there.Like people in the spring of life,
    Of joys and countless blessings rife,
    Who yield themselves to Pleasure's hand--
    So danced that night the Brownie Band.First one would take his place to show
    The special step for heel or toe,
    Just how to edge about with care,
    And help around the partner fair,
    Nor plant his feet upon a dress--
    To cause confusion and distress.Then more would play the master's part,
    And give some lessons in the art:

[Illustration]

        Would show the rest some figures new
        From Turkey, China, or Peru.Now smoothly glide, as if on wings,
    Then bob around, as if on springs,
    Until the sprightly steps would call
    Loud acclamations from them all.They danced in twos with skip and bound,
    They danced in circles, round and round;
    They danced in lines that coiled about
    As runs the serpent in and out,
    Some moving slow, some standing still--
    More cutting capers with a will.At length, by joining hand in hand,
    The set included all the band.A happier crowd was never seen
    On ball-room floor or village green.By turns they danced, by turns would go
    And try their skill at string and bow--
    They almost sawed the fiddle through,
    So fast the bow across it flew.And louder still the harp would ring,
    As nimbler fingers plucked the string.Alike they seemed a skillful band
    Upon the floor or music-stand.The night wore on, from hour to hour,
    And still they danced with vim and power;
    For supple-kneed and light of toe
    The Brownies are, as well you know,
    And such a thing as tiring out
    Gives them but small concern, no doubt.As long as darkness hung her pall
    In heavy folds around the hall,
    The Brownies stayed to dance and play,
    Until the very break of day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    To dance the figures o'er and o'er,
    They lingered on the polished floor;
    No sooner was one party done
    Than others the position won.They chose their partners for the set,
    And bowed, and scraped, and smiling, met.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As night advanced, and morning gray
    Nigh and still nigher cast its ray,
    The lively Brownies faster flew,
    Across and back, around and through;
    Now down the center, up the side,
    Then back to place with graceful glide--
                  Until it seemed that even day
                  Would hardly drive the band away.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                  At length some, more upon their guard
                  Against surprises, labored hard
    To urge their comrades from the place
    Before the sun would show his face.They pulled and hauled with all their might
    At those half crazy with delight,
                  Who still would struggle for a chance
                  To have, at least, another dance--
                  Some figure that was quite forgot,
                          Although "the finest of the lot."Another wished to linger still--
                          In spite of warning words--until
                          Each member present on the floor
                          Had been his partner twice or more.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Meantime, outside, the tell-tale dyes
                Of morn began to paint the skies,
                And, one by one, the stars of night
                Grew pale before the morning's light.Alone, bright Venus, in the west,
                Upheld her torch and warned the rest;
                While from the hedge the piping note
                Of waking birds began to float;
    And crows upon the wooded hills
    Commenced to stir and whet their bills,
    When Brownies scampered from the place,
    And undertook the homeward race.Nor made a halt in street or square,
    Or verdant park, however fair;
    But farther from the sight of man
    And light of day, they quickly ran.They traveled at their highest speed,
    And swiftly must they go, indeed;
    For, like the spokes of some great wheel,
    The rays of light began to steal
    Still higher up the eastern sky,
    And showed the sun was rolling nigh.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.[Illustration]

    One evening, while the Brownies sat
    Enjoying free and friendly chat,
    Some on the trees, some on the ground,
    And others perched on fences round--
    One Brownie, rising in his place,
    Addressed the band with beaming face.The listeners gathered with delight
    Around the member, bold and bright,
    To hear him tell of scenes he'd spied
    While roaming through the country wide."Last eve," said he, "to shun the blast,
    Behind a cottage fence I passed.While there, I heard a merry rout,
    And as the yard was dark without,
    I crawled along through weeds and grass,
    Through melon-vines and broken glass,
    Until I might, unnoticed, win
    A glimpse of all the sport within.At length, below the window-pane,
                    To reach the sill I stretched in vain;
                    But, thanks to my inquiring mind
                    And sundry bricks, I chanced to find
    The facts I can relate in full
    About that lively candy-pull.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    "An hour or more, I well believe,
    I stood, their actions to perceive,
    With elbows resting on the sill,
    And nose against the window still.I watched them closely at their fun,
    And learned how everything was done.The younger members took the lead,
    And carried on the work with speed.With nimble feet they ran about
    From place to place, with laugh and shout;
    But older heads looked on the while,
    And cheered the youngsters with a smile,
    And gave advice in manner kind
    To guide the inexperienced mind.They placed the sugar in a pot,
    And stirred it round till boiling hot;
    Then rolled and worked it in their hands,
    And stretched it out in shining bands,
    Until it reached across the floor,
    From mantel-piece to kitchen door."These eyes of mine for many a night
    Have not beheld a finer sight.To pull the candy was the part
    Of some who seemed to know the art.The moon had slipped behind the hill,
    And hoarse had grown the whip-poor-will;
    But still, with nose against the pane,
    I kept my place through wind and rain.There, perched upon the shaky pile,
    With bated breath I gazed the while.I watched them with the sharpest sight
    That I might tell the tale aright;
    For all the active youngsters there
    Appeared to have of work their share.Some put fresh sugar in the pot,
    Some kept the fire blazing hot,
    And worked away as best they could
    To keep the stove well filled with wood.Indeed, ourselves, with all our skill,
    At moving here and there at will,
    Would have to 'lively' be and 'tear
    Around' to beat those children there!Some cut it up, more passed it round,
    While others ate it by the pound!"[Illustration]

    At this, a murmur of surprise
    On every side began to rise;
    Then smiles o'er every visage flitted,
    As wide as cheeks and ears permitted,
    That told what train of thought had sped
    At once through every Brownie's head--
    A thought of pleasure near at hand
    That well would suit the cunning band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            The Brownies act without delay
            When new ideas cross their way,
            And soon one raised a finger small
            And close attention gained from all.They crowded near with anxious glance
            To learn what scheme he could advance--
    What methods mention or employ
    To bring about the promised joy.Said he: "A vacant house is near.The owner leaves it every year
    For several months, and pleasure seeks
    On ocean waves or mountain peaks.The range is there against the wall,
            The pots, the pans, the spoons, and all,
            While cans of syrup may be found
            In every grocer's store around.The Brownie must be dull and tame,
            And scarce deserves to bear the name,
            Who will not join with heart and hand
            To carry out a scheme so grand."[Illustration]

    Another cried: "When to his bed
    The sun to-morrow stoops his head,
    Again we'll muster in full force
    And to that building turn our course."[Illustration]

            Next eve they gained the street at last
            That through the silent city passed;
            And soon they paused, their eyes they raised
            And on the vacant mansion gazed.In vain the miser hides his store,
    In vain the merchant bars his door,
    In vain the locksmith changes keys--
    The Brownies enter where they please.Through iron doors, through gates of brass,
    And walls of stone they safely pass,
    And smile to think how soon they can
    Upset the studied schemes of man.Within that house, without delay,
    Behind the guide they worked their way,
    More happy far and full of glee
    Than was the owner, out at sea.The whale, the shark, or fish that flies
    Had less attraction for his eyes
    Than had the shining candy-balls
    For Brownies, swarming through his halls.Soon coal was from the cellar brought
    And kindling wood came, quick as thought;
    Then pots and pans came rattling in
    And syrup sweet, in cans of tin.Just where the syrup had been found
    It matters not.The cunning band was soon possessed
    Of full supplies and of the best;
    Next tablespoons of silver fine
    In every hand appeared to shine,
    And ladles long, of costly ware,
    That had been laid away with care.No sooner was the syrup hot
    Than some around the kettle got,
    And dabbed away in eager haste
    To be the first to get a taste.Then some were scalded when the spoon
    Let fall its contents all too soon,
            And gave the tongue too warm a mess
            To carry without some distress.Then steps were into service brought
            That dancing-masters never taught,
            And smothered cries and swinging hand
            Would wake the wonder of the band.And when the candy boiled until
            It could be pulled and hauled at will,
    Take every shape or twist, and seem
    As free as fancy in a dream,
    The busy, happy-hearted crew
    Enjoyed the moments as they flew.The Brownies in the building stayed
    And candy ate as fast as made.But when at length the brightening sky
    Gave warning they must homeward fly,
    They quickly sought the open air
    And had but little time to spare.The shortest way, as often found,
    Was o'er the roughest piece of ground,
    Where rocks as large as houses lay
    All scattered round in wild array.Some covered o'er with clinging vines,
    Some bearing up gigantic pines,
    Or spreading oaks, that rooted fast,
    For centuries had stood the blast.But over all the rugged ground
    The Brownies passed with lightsome bound,
    Now jumping clear from block to block,
    Now sliding down the shelving rock,
    Or cheering on the lagging kind
    Who here and there would fall behind.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE LOCOMOTIVE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                One night the Brownies found their way
                To where some tracks and switches lay,
                And buildings stood, such as are found
    In every town on railroad ground.They moved about from place to place,
    With prying eyes and cautious pace
    They peeped in shops and gained a view,
    Where cars were standing bright and new;
    While others, that had service known,
    And in some crash were overthrown,
    On jack-screws, blocks, and such affairs,
    Were undergoing full repairs.The table that turns end for end
            Its heavy load, without a bend,
            Was next inspected through and through
            And tested by the wondering crew.They scanned the signal-lights with care
            That told the state of switches there,--
            Showed whether tracks kept straight ahead,
            Or simply to some siding led.[Illustration]

                Then round a locomotive strong
                They gathered in an earnest throng,
                Commenting on the style it showed,
                Its strength and speed upon the road.Said one: "That 'pilot' placed before
                Will toss a cow a block or more;
            You'd hardly find a bone intact
            When such a thing her frame has racked--
            Above the fence, and, if you please,
            Above the smoke-stack and the trees
            Will go the horns and heels in air,
            When hoisted by that same affair.""Sometimes it saves," another cried,
            "And throws an object far aside
            That would to powder have been ground,
            If rushing wheels a chance had found.I saw a goat tossed from the track
            And landed on a farmer's stack,
            And though surprised at fate so strange,
            He seemed delighted at the change;
            And lived content, on best of fare,
            Until the farmer found him there."Another said: "We'll have some fun
    And down the road this engine run.The steam is up, as gauges show;
    She's puffing, ready now to go;
    The fireman and the engineer
    Are at their supper, in the rear
    Of yonder shed.I took a peep,
    And found the watchman fast asleep.So now's our time, if we but haste,
    The joys of railway life to taste.I know the engine-driver's art,
    Just how to stop, reverse, and start;
    I've watched them when they little knew
    From every move I knowledge drew;
    We'll not be seen till under way,
    And then, my friends, here let me say,
    The man or beast will something lack
    Who strives to stop us on the track."Then some upon the engine stepped,
    And some upon the pilot crept,
    And more upon the tender found
    A place to sit and look around.And soon away the engine rolled
    At speed 'twas fearful to behold;
    It seemed they ran, where tracks were straight,
    At least at mile-a-minute rate;
    And even where the curves were short
    The engine turned them with a snort
    That made the Brownies' hearts the while
    Rise in their throats, for half a mile.But travelers many dangers run
    On safest roads beneath the sun.They ran through yards, where dogs came out
    To choke with dust that whirled about,
    And so could neither growl nor bark
    Till they had vanished in the dark;
    Some pigs that wandered late at night,
    And neither turned to left nor right,
        But on the crossing held debate
        Who first should squeeze beneath the gate,
        Were helped above the fence to rise
        Ere they had time to squeal surprise,
        And never after cared to stray
        Along the track by night or day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        But when a town was just in sight,
        And speed was at its greatest height,--
        Alas!that such a thing should be,--
        An open switch the Brownies see.Then some thought best at once to go
                        Into the weeds and ditch below;
                        But many on the engine stayed
                        And held their grip, though much dismayed.And waited for the shock to fall
                        That would decide the fate of all.In vain reversing tricks were tried,
                        And brakes to every wheel applied;
                        The locomotive forward flew,
                        In spite of all that skill could do.But just as they approached the place
                Where trouble met them face to face,
    Through some arrangement, as it seemed,
    Of which the Brownies never dreamed,
    The automatic switch was closed,
    A safety signal-light exposed,
    And they were free to roll ahead,
    And wait for those who'd leaped in dread;
    Although the end seemed near at hand
    Of every Brownie in the band,
    And darkest heads through horrid fright
    Were in a moment changed to white,
    The injuries indeed were small.A few had suffered from their fall,
    And some were sprained about the toes,
    While more were scraped upon the nose;
    But all were able to succeed
    In climbing to a place with speed,
    And there they stayed until once more
    They passed the heavy round-house door.Then jumping down on every side
    The Brownies scampered off to hide;
    And as they crossed the trestle high
    The sun was creeping up the sky,
    And urged them onward in their race
    To find some safe abiding place.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' FANCY BALL.[Illustration]

    It was the season of the year
    When people, dressed in fancy gear,
    From every quarter hurried down
    And filled the largest halls in town;
    And there to flute and fiddle sweet
    Went through their sets with lively feet.The Brownies were not slow to note
    That fun indeed was now afloat;
    And ere the season passed away,
    Of longest night and shortest day,
    They looked about to find a hall
    Where they could hold their fancy ball.Said one: "A room can soon be found
    Where all the band can troop around;
    But want of costumes, much I fear,
    Will bar our pleasure all the year."My eyes have not been shut of late,--
    Don't show a weak and hopeless mind
    Because your knowledge is confined,--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For I'm prepared to take the band
    To costumes, ready to the hand,
    Of every pattern, new or old:
    The kingly robes, with chains of gold,
    The cloak and plume of belted knight,
    The pilgrim's hat and stockings white,
    The dresses for the ladies fair,
    The gems and artificial hair,
    The soldier-suits in blue and red,
    The turban for the Tartar's head,
    All can be found where I will lead,
    If friends are willing to proceed."[Illustration]

    Those knowing best the Brownie way
    Will know there was no long delay,
    Ere to the town he made a break
    With all the Brownies in his wake.It mattered not that roads were long,
    That hills were high or winds were strong;
    Soon robes were found on peg and shelf,
    And each one chose to suit himself.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The costumes, though a world too wide,
    And long enough a pair to hide,
    Were gathered in with skill and care,
    That showed the tailor's art was there.Then out they started for the hall,
    In fancy trappings one and all;
    Some clad like monks in sable gowns;
    And some like kings; and more like clowns;
    And Highlanders, with naked knees;
    And Turks, with turbans like a cheese;
    While many members in the line
    Were dressed like ladies fair and fine,
    And swept along the polished floor
    A train that reached a yard or more.[Illustration]

    By happy chance some laid their hand
    Upon the outfit of a band;
    The horns and trumpets took the lead,
    Supported well by string and reed;
    And violins, that would have made
    A mansion for the rogues that played,
    With flute and clarionet combined
    In music of the gayest kind.In dances wild and strange to see
    They passed the hours in greatest glee;
    Familiar figures all were lost
    In flowing robes that round them tossed;
    And well-known faces hid behind
    Queer masks that quite confused the mind.The queen and clown, a loving pair,
    Enjoyed a light fandango there;
    While solemn monks of gentle heart,
    In jig and scalp-dance took their part.The grand salute, with courteous words,
                The bobbing up and down, like birds,
                The lively skip, the stately glide,
                The double turn, and twist aside
                Were introduced in proper place
                And carried through with ease and grace.So great the pleasure proved to all,
    Too long they tarried in the hall,
    And morning caught them on the fly,
    Ere they could put the garments by!Then dodging out in great dismay,
            By walls and stumps they made their way;
            And not until the evening's shade
            Were costumes in their places laid.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE TUGBOAT.[Illustration]

    While Brownies strayed along a pier
    To view the shipping lying near,
    A tugboat drew their gaze at last;
    'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.Cried one: "See what in black and red
    Below the pilot-house is spread!In honor of the Brownie Band,
    It bears our name in letters grand.Through all the day she's on the go;
    Now with a laden scow in tow,
    And next with barges two or three,
    Then taking out a ship to sea,
    Or through the Narrows steaming round
    In search of vessels homeward bound;
    She's stanch and true from stack to keel,
    And we should highly honored feel."Another said: "An hour ago,
    The men went up to see a show,
    And left the tugboat lying here.The steam is up, our course is clear,
    We'll crowd on board without delay
    And run her up and down the bay.We have indeed a special claim,
    Because she bears the 'Brownie' name.Before the dawn creeps through the east
    We'll know about her speed at least,
    And prove how such a craft behaves
    When cutting through the roughest waves.Behind the wheel I'll take my stand
    And steer her round with skillful hand,
    Now down the river, now around
    The bay, or up the broader sound;
    Throughout the trip I'll keep her clear
    Of all that might awaken fear.When hard-a-port the helm I bring,
    Or starboard make a sudden swing,
    The Band can rest as free from dread
    As if they slept on mossy bed.I something know about the seas,
    I've boxed a compass, if you please,
    And so can steer her east or west,
    Or north or south, as suits me best.Without the aid of twinkling stars
    Or light-house lamps, I'll cross the bars.I know when north winds nip the nose,
    Or sou'-sou'-west the 'pig-wind' blows,
    As hardy sailors call the gale
    That from that quarter strikes the sail."A third replied: "No doubt you're smart
    And understand the pilot's art,
    But more than one a hand should take,
    For all our lives will be at stake.In spite of eyes and ears and hands,
    And all the skill a crew commands,
    How oft collisions crush the keel
    And give the fish a sumptuous meal!Too many rocks around the bay
    Stick up their heads to bar the way.Too many vessels, long and wide,
    At anchor in the channel ride
    For us to show ourselves unwise
    And trust to but one pair of eyes."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long the tugboat swinging clear
    Turned bow to stream and left the pier,
    While many Brownies, young and old,
    From upper deck to lower hold
    Were crowding round in happy vein
    Still striving better views to gain.Some watched the waves around them roll;
    Some stayed below to shovel coal,
    From hand to hand, with pitches strong,
    They passed the rattling loads along.Some at the engine took a place,
    More to the pilot-house would race
    To keep a sharp lookout ahead,
    Or man the wheel as fancy led.But accidents we oft record,
    However well we watch and ward,
    And vessels often go to wreck
    With careful captains on the deck;
    They had mishaps that night, for still,
    In spite of all their care and skill,
    While running straight or turning round
    In river, bay, or broader sound,
    At times they ran upon a rock,
    And startled by the sudden shock
    Some timid Brownies, turning pale,
    Would spring at once across the rail;
    And then, repenting, find all hope
    Of life depended on a rope,
    That willing hands were quick to throw
    And hoist them from the waves below.Sometimes too near a ship they ran
    For peace of mind; again, their plan
    Would come to naught through lengthy tow
    Of barges passing to and fro.The painted buoys around the bay
    At times occasioned some dismay--
    They took them for torpedoes dread
    That might the boat in fragments spread,
    Awake the city's slumbering crowds,
    And hoist the band among the clouds.But thus, till hints of dawn appeared
    Now here, now there, the boat was steered
    With many joys and many fears,
    That some will bear in mind for years;
    But at her pier once more she lay
    When night gave place to creeping day.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' TALLY-HO.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As shades of evening closed around,
        The Brownies, from some wooded ground,
        Looked out to view with staring eye
        A Tally-Ho, then passing by.Around the park they saw it roll,
    Now sweeping round a wooded knoll,
    Now rumbling o'er an arching bridge,
    Now hid behind a rocky ridge,
    Now wheeling out again in view
    To whirl along some avenue.They hardly could restrain a shout
    When they observed the grand turnout.The long, brass horn, that trilled so loud,
    The prancing horses, and the crowd
                    Of people perched so high in air
                    Pleased every wondering Brownie there.Said one: "A rig like this we see
    Would suit the Brownies to a T!And I'm the one, here let me say,
    To put such pleasures in our way:
    I know the very place to go
    To-night to find a Tally-Ho.It never yet has borne a load
                    Of happy hearts along the road;
                    But, bright and new in every part
                    'Tis ready for an early start.The horses in the stable stand
                    With harness ready for the hand;
                    If all agree, we'll take a ride
                    For miles across the country wide."Another said: "The plan is fine;
                    You well deserve to head the line;
                    But, on the road, the reins I'll draw;
    I know the way to 'gee' and 'haw,'
    And how to turn a corner round,
    And still keep wheels upon the ground."Another answered: "No, my friend,
    We'll not on one alone depend;
    But three or four the reins will hold,
                    That horses may be well controlled.The curves are short, the hills are steep,
                    The horses fast, and ditches deep,
                    And at some places half the band
                    May have to take the lines in hand."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    That night, according to their plan,
    The Brownies to the stable ran;
    Through swamps they cut to reach the place,
    And cleared the fences in their race
      As lightly as the swallow flies
        To catch its morning meal supplies.Though, in the race, some clothes were soiled,
            And stylish shoes completely spoiled,
    Across the roughest hill or rock
    They scampered like a frightened flock,
    Now o'er inclosures knee and knee,
    With equal speed they clambered free
    And soon with faces all aglow
    They crowded round the Tally-Ho;
    But little time they stood to stare
    Or smile upon the strange affair.As many hands make labor light,
    And active fingers win the fight,
    Each busy Brownie played his part,
    And soon 't was ready for the start.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    But ere they took their seats to ride
    By more than one the horns were tried,
    Each striving with tremendous strain
    The most enlivening sound to gain,
    And prove he had a special right
    To blow the horn throughout the night.[Illustration]

    Though some were crowded in a seat,
    And some were forced to keep their feet
    Or sit upon another's lap,
    And some were hanging to a strap,
    With merry laugh and ringing shout,
    And tooting horns, they drove about.A dozen miles, perhaps, or more,
    The lively band had traveled o'er,
    Commenting on their happy lot
    And keeping horses on the trot,
    When, as they passed a stunted oak
    A wheel was caught, the axle broke![Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some went out with sudden pitch,
    And some were tumbled in the ditch,
    And one jumped off to save his neck,
    While others still hung to the wreck.Confusion reigned, for coats were rent,
    And hats were crushed, and horns were bent,
    And what began with fun and clatter
    Had turned to quite a serious matter.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                        Some blamed the drivers, others thought
                        The tooting horns the trouble brought.More said, that they small wisdom showed,
                        Who left the root so near the road.But while they talked about their plight
                        Upon them burst the morning light
                        With all the grandeur and the sheen
                          That June could lavish on the scene.So hitching horses where they could,
                                  The Brownies scampered for the wood.And lucky were the Brownies spry:
                                  A dark and deep ravine was nigh
                                  That seemed to swallow them alive
    So quick were they to jump and dive,
    To safely hide from blazing day
    That fast had driven night away,
    And forced them to leave all repairs
    To other heads and hands than theirs.THE BROWNIES ON

THE RACE-TRACK.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies moved around one night
                    A seaside race-track came in sight."'T is here," said one, "the finest breed
                    Of horses often show their speed;
                    Here, neck and neck, and nose and nose,
                    Beneath the jockeys' urging blows,
                    They sweep around the level mile
                    The people shouting all the while;
    And climbing up or crowding through
    To gain a better point of view,
    So they can see beyond a doubt
    How favorites are holding out."Another said: "I know the place
    Where horses wait to-morrow's race;
    We'll strap the saddles on their back,
    And lead them out upon the track.Then some will act the jockey's part,
    And some, as judges, watch the start,
    And drop the crimson flag to show
    The start is fair and all must go."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long, the Brownies turned to haul
    Each wondering race-horse from his stall.They bridled them without delay,
        And saddles strapped in proper way.Some restless horses rearing there
        Would toss their holders high in air,
        And test the courage and the art
        Of those who took an active part.Said one: "I've lurked in yonder wood,
          And watched the races when I could.I know how all is done with care
              When thus for racing they prepare;
                How every buckle must be tight,
                And every strap and stirrup right,
    Or jockeys would be on the ground
    Before they circled half way round."When all was ready for the show
    Each Brownie rogue was nowise slow
    At climbing up to take a place
    And be a jockey in the race.Full half a dozen Brownies tried
    Upon one saddle now to ride;
    But some were into service pressed
    As judges to control the rest--
    To see that rules were kept complete,
    And then decide who won the heat.A dozen times they tried to start;
    Some shot ahead like jockeys smart,
    And were prepared to take the lead
    Around the track at flying speed.But others were so far behind,
    On horses of unruly mind,
    The judges from the stand declare
    The start was anything but fair.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        So back they'd jog at his command,
        In better shape to pass the stand.Indeed it was no simple trick
        To ride those horses, shy and quick,
        And only for the mystic art
        That is the Brownies' special part,
    A dozen backs, at least, had found
    A resting-place upon the ground.The rules of racing were not quite
    Observed in full upon that night.Around and round the track they flew,
    In spite of all the judge could do.The race, he tried to let them know,
    Had been decided long ago.But still the horses kept the track,
    With Brownies clinging to each back.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Some racers of the jumping kind
            At times disturbed the riders' mind
            When from the track they sudden wheeled,
            And over fences took the field,
            As if they hoped in some such mode
            To rid themselves of half their load.But horses, howsoever smart,
        Are not a match for Brownie art,
    For still the riders stuck through all,
    In spite of fence, or ditch, or wall.Some clung to saddle, some to mane,
    While others tugged at bridle rein.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    So all the steeds found it would pay
    To let the Brownies have their way,
    Until a glimpse of rising sun
    Soon made them leave the place and run.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' BIRTHDAY DINNER.[Illustration]

    When people through the county planned
    To give their public dinners grand,
    The Brownies met at day's decline
    To have a birthday banquet fine."The proper things," a speaker cried,
    "Await us here on every side;
    We simply have to reach and take
    And choose a place to boil and bake.With meal and flour at our feet,
    And wells of water pure and sweet,
    That Brownie must be dull indeed
    Who lacks the gumption to proceed.We'll peel the pumpkins, ripened well,
    And scoop them hollow, like a shell,
    Then slice them up the proper size
    To make at length those famous pies,
    For which the people, small and great,
    Are ever quick to reach a plate."[Illustration]

    This pleased them all; so none were slow
    In finding work at which to go.A stove that chance threw in their way
    Was put in shape without delay.Though doors were cracked, and legs were rare,
                    The spacious oven still was there,
                    Where pies and cakes and puddings wide
                    Might bake together side by side.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

              The level top, though incomplete,
              Gave pots and pans a welcome seat,
              Where stews could steam and dumplings found
              A fitting place to roll around.Some lengths of pipe were raised on high
    That made the soot and cinders fly,
    And caused a draught throughout the wreck
    That door or damper failed to check.The rogues who undertook the part,
              That tries the cook's delightful art,
              Had smarting hands and faces red
              Before the table-cloth was spread;
                      But what cared they at such an hour
                      For singeing flame or scalding shower?Such ills are always reckoned slight
                      When great successes are in sight.There cakes and tarts and cookies fine,
                      Of both the "leaf" and "notched" design,
                      Were ranged in rows around the pan
                    That into heated ovens ran;
                    Where, in what seemed a minute's space,
                    Another batch would take their place;
                    While birds, that had secured repose
                    Above the reach of Reynard's nose,
                    Without the aid of wings came down
                    To be at midnight roasted brown.They found some boards and benches laid
                    Aside by workmen at their trade,
                    And these upon the green were placed
                    By willing hands with proper haste.Said one, who board and bench combined:
                    "All art is not to cooks confined,
                    And some expertness we can show
                    As well as those who mix the dough."And all was as the speaker said;
                In fact, they were some points ahead;
              For when the cooks their triumphs showed,
            The table waited for its load.The knives and forks and dishes white
        By secret methods came to light.Much space would be required to tell
    Just how the table looked so well;
    But kitchen cupboards, three or four,
    Must there have yielded up their store;
    For all the guests on every side
    With full equipments were supplied.When people find a carver hacked,
    A saucer chipped, or platter cracked,
    They should be somewhat slow to claim
    That servants are the ones to blame;
        For Brownies may have used the ware
      And failed to show the proper care.[Illustration]

     A few, as waiters, passed about
    New dishes when the old gave out,
     And saw the plates, as soon as bare,
      Were heaped again with something rare.No member, as you may believe,
        Was anxious such a place to leave,
                Until he had a taste at least
                Of all the dishes in the feast.The Brownies, when they break their fast,
                Will eat as long as viands last,
                And even birds can not depend
                On crumbs or pickings at the end:
                The plates were scraped, the kettles clean,
                And not a morsel to be seen,
                Ere Brownies from that table ran
                To shun the prying eyes of man.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' HALLOW-EVE.[Illustration]

    On Hallow-eve, that night of fun,
     When elves and goblins frisk and run,
       And many games and tricks are tried
         At every pleasant fireside,
        The Brownies halted to survey
       A village that below them lay,
      And wondered as they rested there
    To hear the laughter fill the air
    That from the happy children came
    As they enjoyed some pleasant game.Said one: "What means this merry flow
    That comes so loudly from below,
    Uncommon pleasures must abound
    Where so much laughter can be found."Another said: "Now, by your leave,
    I'll tell you 't is All-Hallow-eve,
    When people meet to have their sport
    At curious games of every sort;
    I know them all from first to last,
    And now, before the night has passed,
    For some convenient place we'll start
    Without delay to play our part."Two dozen mouths commenced to show
    Their teeth in white and even row;
    Two dozen voices cried with speed,
    "The plan is good we're all agreed."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    And in a trice four dozen feet
    Went down the hill with even beat.Without a long or wearying race
    The Brownies soon secured a place
    That answered well in every way
    For all the games they wished to play.There tubs of water could be found,
    By which to stoop or kneel around,
    And strive to bring the pennies out
    That on the bottom slipped about.Then heads were wet and shoulders, too,
    Where some would still the coin pursue,
    And mouth about now here and there
    Without a pause or breath of air
    Until in pride, with joyful cries,
    They held aloft the captured prize.More stood the tempting bait beneath,
    And with a hasty snap of teeth
    The whirling apple thought to claim
    And shun the while the candle's flame,--
    But found that with such pleasure goes
    An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    More named the oats as people do
    To try which hearts are false, which true,
    And on the griddle placed the pair
    To let them part or smoulder there;
    And smiled to see, through woe or weal,
    How often hearts were true as steel.Still others tried to read their fate
    Or fortune in a dish or plate,
    Learn whether they would ever wed,
    Or lead a single life instead;
    Or if their mate would be a blessing,
    Or prove a partner most distressing.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then others in the open air,
    Of fun and frolic had their share;
    Played "hide and seek," and "blindman's buff,"
    And "tag" o'er places smooth or rough,
    And "snap the whip" and "trip the toe,"
    And games that none but Brownies know.As if their lives at stake were placed,
    They jumped around and dodged and raced,
    And tumbled headlong to the ground
    When feet some hard obstruction found;
    At times across the level mead,
    Some proved their special claims to speed,
    And as reward of merit wore
    A wreath of green till sport was o'er.The hours flew past as hours will
    When joys do every moment fill;
    The moon grew weak and said good-night,
    And turned her pallid face from sight;
    Then weakening stars began to fail,
    But still the Brownies kept the vale;
    Full many a time had hours retired
    Much faster than the band desired,
    And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay
    Aside, because of coming day,
      But never yet with greater pain
        Did they behold the crimson stain
          That morning spread along the sky,
            And told them they must homeward fly




THE BROWNIES' [Illustration] FLAG-POLE.[Illustration]

    The Brownies through a village bound,
    Paused in their run to look around,
    And wondered why the central square
    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.Said one: "Without delay we'll go
    To woods that stand some miles below.The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest
    So straight and high above the rest,
    We soon can choose a flag-pole there
    To ornament this village square.Then every one a hand will lend
    To trim it off from end to end,
    To peel it smooth and paint it white,
    And hoist it in the square to-night."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then to the woods the Brownies ran
    At once to carry out their plan;
    While some ran here and there with speed
    For implements to serve their need,
    Some rambled through the forest free
    To find the proper kind of tree,
    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood
    To learn if it was sound and good,
                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,
                                   To mar its looks from end to end.When one was found that suited well,
                                   To work the active Brownies fell;
      And soon with sticks beneath their load,
      The band in grand procession strode;
        It gave them quite enough to do
        To safely put the project through,
        But when they reached the square, at last,
        Some ropes around the pole were passed
        And from the tops of maples tall
        A crowd began to pull and haul,
        While others gathered at the base
        Until the flag-pole stood in place.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For Brownies seldom idle stand
    When there is fun or work on hand.At night when darkness wraps us round
    They come from secret haunts profound,
    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,
    They clamber over fence and wall;
    And soon on objects here and there
    That hold positions high in air,
    And most attract the human eye,
    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.Sometimes with feet that never tire
    They climb the tall cathedral spire;
    When all the town is still below,
    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,
    By light of moon, and stars alone,
    They dust the marble and the stone,
          And with their brushes, small and great,
          They paint and gild the dial-plate;
          And bring the figures plain in sight
          That all may note Time's rapid flight.And accidents they often know
          While through the heavy works they go,
          Where slowly turning wheels at last
          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all
          The hardships that may them befall,
          Still persevere in every case
          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly
          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]

    One night the Brownies stood beside
    A long canal, whose silent tide
    Connected seaboard cities great
    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band.""I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place.“My Norah, leave me; you may by chance be rudely handled in the scuffle.”

The terrified but faithful girl fell upon his breast.“Connor, your fate is mine; hasten to your boat, if it be not yet too
late.”

An iron-shod hunting pole was his only weapon; and using it with his
right arm, while Norah hung upon his left, he sprang without further
parley through an aperture in the wall, and made for the water.But his
assailants were upon him, the M’Diarmod himself with upraised battle-axe
at their head.“Spare my father,” faltered Norah; and Connor, with a mercifully
directed stroke, only dashed the weapon from the old man’s hand, and
then, clearing a passage with a vigorous sweep, accompanied with the
well-known charging cry, before which they had so often quailed, bounded
through it to the water’s brink.An instant, and with her who was now
more than his second self, he was once more in his little boat; but,
alas!it was aground, and so quickly fell the blows against him, that he
dare not adventure to shove it off.Letting Norah slip from his hold,
she sank backwards to the bottom of the boat; and then, with both arms
free, he redoubled his efforts, and after a short but furious struggle
succeeded in getting the little skiff afloat.Maddened at the sight, the
old chief rushed breast-deep into the water; but his right arm had been
disabled by a casual blow, and his disheartened followers feared, under
the circumstances, to come within range of that well-wielded club.But
a crafty one among them had already seized on a safer and surer plan.He had clambered up an adjacent tree, armed with a heavy stone, and now
stood on one of the branches above the devoted boat, and summoned him to
yield, if he would not perish.The young chief’s renewed exertions were
his only answer.“Let him escape, and your head shall pay for it,” shouted the infuriated
father.“My young mistress?”

“There are enough here to save her, if I will it.Down with the stone, or
by the blood----”

He needed not to finish the sentence, for down at the word it came,
striking helpless the youth’s right arm, and shivering the frail timber
of the boat, which filled at once, and all went down.For an instant
an arm re-appeared, feebly beating the water in vain--it was the young
chief’s broken one: the other held his Norah in its embrace, as was seen
by her white dress flaunting for a few moments on and above the troubled
surface.The lake at this point was deep, and though there was a rush of
the M’Diarmods towards it, yet in their confusion they were but awkward
aids, and the fluttering ensign that marked the fatal spot had sunk
before they reached it.The strength of Connor, disabled as he was by
his broken limb, and trammelled by her from whom even the final struggle
could not dissever him, had failed; and with her he loved locked in his
last embrace, they were after a time recovered from the water, and laid
side by side upon the bank, in all their touching, though, alas, lifeless
beauty!Remorse reached the rugged hearts even of those who had so
ruthlessly dealt by them; and as they looked on their goodly forms, thus
cold and senseless by a common fate, the rudest felt that it would be
an impious and unpardonable deed to do violence to their memory, by the
separation of that union which death itself had sanctified.Thus were
they laid in one grave; and, strange as it may appear, their fathers,
crushed and subdued, exhausted even of resentment by the overwhelming
stroke--for nothing can quell the stubborn spirit like the extremity of
sorrow--crossed their arms in amity over their remains, and grief wrought
the reconciliation which even centuries of time, that great pacificator,
had failed to do.The westering sun now warning me that the day was on the wane, I gave but
another look to the time-worn tombstone, another sigh to the early doom
of those whom it enclosed, and then, with a feeling of regret, again left
the little island to its still, unshared, and pensive loneliness.ANCIENT IRISH LITERATURE--No.The composition which we have selected as our fourth specimen of the
ancient literature of Ireland, is a poem, more remarkable, perhaps,
for its antiquity and historical interest, than for its poetic merits,
though we do not think it altogether deficient in those.It is ascribed,
apparently with truth, to the celebrated poet Mac Liag, the secretary of
the renowned monarch Brian Boru, who, as our readers are aware, fell at
the battle of Clontarf in 1014; and the subject of it is a lamentation
for the fallen condition of Kincora, the palace of that monarch,
consequent on his death.The decease of Mac Liag, whose proper name was Muircheartach, is thus
recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters, at the year 1015:--

“Mac Liag, i. e. Muirkeartach, son of Conkeartach, at this time laureate
of Ireland, died.”

A great number of his productions are still in existence; but none of
them have obtained a popularity so widely extended as the poem before us.Of the palace of Kincora, which was situated on the banks of the Shannon,
near Killaloe, there are at present no vestiges.LAMENTATION OF MAC LIAG FOR KINCORA.A Chinn-copath carthi Brian?And where is the beauty that once was thine?Oh, where are the princes and nobles that sate
    At the feast in thy halls, and drank the red wine?Oh, where are the Dalcassians of the Golden Swords?[1]
    And where are the warriors that Brian led on?And where is Morogh, the descendant of kings--
    The defeater of a hundred--the daringly brave--
    Who set but slight store by jewels and rings--
    Who swam down the torrent and laughed at its wave?And where is Donogh, King Brian’s worthy son?And where is Conaing, the Beautiful Chief?they are gone--
    They have left me this night alone with my grief!And where are the chiefs with whom Brian went forth,
    The never-vanquished son of Evin the Brave,
    The great King of Onaght, renowned for his worth,
    And the hosts of Baskinn, from the western wave?Oh, where is Duvlann of the Swiftfooted Steeds?And where is Kian, who was son of Molloy?And where is King Lonergan, the fame of whose deeds
    In the red battle-field no time can destroy?And where is that youth of majestic height,
    The faith-keeping Prince of the Scots?--Even he,
    As wide as his fame was, as great as was his might,
    Was tributary, oh, Kincora, to me!They are gone, those heroes of royal birth,
    Who plundered no churches, and broke no trust,
    ’Tis weary for me to be living on the earth
    When they, oh, Kincora, lie low in the dust!Oh, never again will Princes appear,
    To rival the Dalcassians of the Cleaving Swords!I can never dream of meeting afar or anear,
    In the east or the west, such heroes and lords!Oh, dear are the images my memory calls up
    Of Brian Boru!--how he never would miss
    To give me at the banquet the first bright cup!why did he heap on me honour like this?I am Mac Liag, and my home is on the Lake:
    Thither often, to that palace whose beauty is fled,
    Came Brian to ask me, and I went for his sake.that I should live, and Brian be dead![1] _Coolg n-or_, of the swords _of gold_, i. e. of the _gold-hilted_
swords.“Biography of a mouse!” cries the reader; “well, what shall we have
next?--what can the writer mean by offering such nonsense for our
perusal?” There is no creature, reader, however insignificant and
unimportant in the great scale of creation it may appear to us,
short-sighted mortals that we are, which is forgotten in the care of
our own common Creator; not a sparrow falls to the ground unknown and
unpermitted by Him; and whether or not you may derive interest from the
biography even of a mouse, you will be able to form a better judgment,
after, than before, having read my paper.The mouse belongs to the class _Mammalia_, or the animals which rear
their young by suckling them; to the order _Rodentia_, or animals whose
teeth are adapted for _gnawing_; to the genus _Mus_, or Rat kind, and the
family of _Mus musculus_, or domestic mouse.The mouse is a singularly
beautiful little animal, as no one who examines it attentively, and
without prejudice, can fail to discover.Its little body is plump and
sleek; its neck short; its head tapering and graceful; and its eyes
large, prominent, and sparkling.Its manners are lively and interesting,
its agility surprising, and its habits extremely cleanly.There are
several varieties of this little creature, amongst which the best known
is the common brown mouse of our granaries and store-rooms; the Albino,
or white mouse, with red eyes; and the black and white mouse, which is
more rare and very delicate.I mention these as _varieties_, for I think
we may safely regard them as such, from the fact of their propagating
unchanged, preserving their difference of hue to the fiftieth generation,
and never accidentally occurring amongst the offspring of differently
 parents.It is of the white mouse that I am now about to treat, and it is an
account of a tame individual of that extremely pretty variety that is
designed to form the subject of my present paper.When I was a boy of about sixteen, I got possession of a white mouse; the
little creature was very wild and unsocial at first, but by dint of care
and discipline I succeeded in rendering it familiar.The principal agent
I employed towards effecting its domestication was a singular one, and
which, though I can assure the reader its effects are speedy and certain,
still remains to me inexplicable: this was, ducking in cold water; and by
resorting to this simple expedient, I have since succeeded in rendering
even the rat as tame and as playful as a kitten.It is out of my power to
explain the manner in which _ducking_ operates on the animal subjected to
it, but I wish that some physiologist more experienced than I am would
give his attention to the subject, and favour the public with the result
of his reflections.At the time that I obtained possession of this mouse, I was residing at
Olney, in Buckinghamshire, a village which I presume my readers will
recollect as connected with the names of Newton and Cowper; but shortly
after having succeeded in rendering it pretty tame, circumstances
required my removal to Gloucester, whither I carried my little favourite
with me.During the journey I kept the mouse confined in a small wire
cage; but while resting at the inn where I passed the night, I adopted
the precaution of enveloping the cage in a handkerchief, lest by some
untoward circumstance its active little inmate might make its escape.Having thus, as I thought, made all safe, I retired to rest.The moment
I awoke in the morning, I sprang from my bed, and went to examine the
cage, when, to my infinite consternation, I found it empty!I searched
the bed, the room, raised the carpet, examined every nook and corner, but
all to no purpose.I dressed myself as hastily as I could, and summoning
one of the waiters, an intelligent, good-natured man, I informed
him of my loss, and got him to search every room in the house.His
investigations, however, proved equally unavailing, and I gave my poor
little pet completely up, inwardly hoping, despite of its ingratitude
in leaving me, that it might meet with some agreeable mate amongst its
brown congeners, and might lead a long and happy life, unchequered by
the terrors of the prowling cat, and unendangered by the more insidious
artifices of the fatal trap.With these reflections I was just getting
into the coach which was to convey me upon my road, when a waiter came
running to the door, out of breath, exclaiming, “Mr R., Mr R., I declare
your little mouse is in the kitchen.” Begging the coachman to wait an
instant, I followed the man to the kitchen, and there, on the hob,
seated contentedly in a pudding dish, and devouring its contents with
considerable _gout_, was my truant protegé.Once more secured within
its cage, and the latter carefully enveloped in a sheet of strong brown
paper, upon my knee, I reached Gloucester.I was here soon subjected to a similar alarm, for one morning the cage
was again empty, and my efforts to discover the retreat of the wanderer
unavailing as before.This time I had lost him for a week, when one
night, in getting into bed, I heard a scrambling in the curtains, and on
relighting my candle found the noise to have been occasioned by my mouse,
who seemed equally pleased with myself at our reunion.After having thus
lost and found my little friend a number of times, I gave up the idea
of confining him; and, accordingly, leaving the door of his cage open,
I placed it in a corner of my bedroom, and allowed him to go in and out
as he pleased.Of this permission he gladly availed himself, but would
regularly return to me at intervals of a week or a fortnight, and at such
periods of return he was usually much thinner than ordinary; and it was
pretty clear that during his visits to his brown acquaintances he fared
by no means so well as he did at home.Sometimes, when he happened to return, as he often did, in the
night-time, on which occasions his general custom was to come into bed to
me, I used, in order to induce him to remain with me until morning, to
immerse him in a basin of water, and then let him lie in my bosom, the
warmth of which, after his cold bath, commonly ensured his stay.Frequently, while absent on one of his excursions, I would hear an
unusual noise in the wainscot, as I lay in bed, of dozens of mice
running backwards and forwards in all directions, and squeaking in much
apparent glee.For some time I was puzzled to know whether this unusual
disturbance was the result of merriment or quarrelling, and I often
trembled for the safety of my pet, alone and unaided, among so many
strangers.But a very interesting circumstance occurred one morning,
which perfectly reassured me.It was a bright summer morning, about four
o’clock, and I was lying awake, reflecting as to the propriety of turning
on my pillow to take another sleep, or at once rising, and going forth to
enjoy the beauties of awakening nature.While thus meditating, I heard a
slight scratching in the wainscot, and looking towards the spot whence
the noise proceeded, perceived the head of a mouse peering from a hole.It was instantly withdrawn, but a second was thrust forth.This latter I
at once recognised as my own white friend, but so begrimed by soot and
dirt that it required an experienced eye to distinguish him from his
darker-coated entertainers.He emerged from the hole, and running over
to his cage, entered it, and remained for a couple of seconds within
it; he then returned to the wainscot, and, re-entering the hole, some
scrambling and squeaking took place.A second time he came forth, and on
this occasion was followed closely, to my no small astonishment, by a
brown mouse, who followed him, with much apparent timidity and caution,
to his box, and entered it along with him.More astonished at this
singular proceeding than I can well express, I lay fixed in mute and
breathless attention, to see what would follow next.In about a minute
the two mice came forth from the cage, each bearing in its mouth a large
piece of bread, which they dragged towards the hole they had previously
left.On arriving at it, they entered, but speedily re-appeared, having
deposited their burden; and repairing once more to the cage, again loaded
themselves with provision, and conveyed it away.This second time they
remained within the hole for a much longer period than the first time;
and when they again made their appearance, they were attended by three
other mice, who, following their leaders to the cage, loaded themselves
with bread as did they, and carried away their burdens to the hole.After
this I saw them no more that morning, and on rising I discovered that
they had carried away every particle of food that the cage contained.Nor
was this an isolated instance of their white guest leading them forth to
where he knew they should find provender.Day after day, whatever bread
or grain I left in the cage was regularly removed, and the duration of my
pet’s absence was proportionately long.Wishing to learn whether hunger
was the actual cause of his return, I no longer left food in his box; and
in about a week afterwards, on awaking one morning, I found him sleeping
upon the pillow, close to my face, having partly wormed his way under my
cheek.There was a cat in the house, an excellent mouser, and I dreaded lest she
should one day meet with and destroy my poor mouse, and I accordingly
used all my exertions with those in whose power it was, to obtain her
dismissal.She was, however, regarded by those persons as infinitely
better entitled to protection and patronage than a mouse, so I was
compelled to put up with her presence.People are fond of imputing to
cats a supernatural degree of sagacity: they will sometimes go so far
as to pronounce them to be genuine _witches_; and really I am scarcely
surprised at it, nor perhaps will the reader be, when I tell him the
following anecdote.I was one day entering my apartment, when I was filled with horror at
perceiving my mouse picking up some crumbs upon the carpet, beneath
the table, and the terrible cat seated upon a chair watching him with
what appeared to me to be an expression of sensual anticipation and
concentrated desire.Before I had time to interfere, Puss sprang from
her chair, and bounded towards the mouse, who, however, far from being
terrified at the approach of his natural enemy, scarcely so much as
favoured her with a single look.Puss raised her paw and dealt him a
gentle tap, when, judge of my astonishment if you can, the little mouse,
far from running away, or betraying any marks of fear, raised himself
on his legs, cocked his tail, and with a shrill and angry squeak, with
which any that have kept tame mice are well acquainted, sprang at and
positively _bit_ the paw which had struck him.I could
not jump forward to the rescue.I was, as it were, petrified where I
stood.But, stranger than all, the cat, instead of appearing irritated,
or seeming to design mischief, merely stretched out her nose and smelt
at her diminutive assailant, and then resuming her place upon the chair,
purred herself to sleep.I need not say that I immediately secured the
mouse within his cage.Whether the cat on this occasion knew the little
animal to be a pet, and as such feared to meddle with it, or whether its
boldness had disarmed her, I cannot pretend to explain: I merely state
the fact; and I think the reader will allow that it is sufficiently
extraordinary.In order to guard against such a dangerous encounter for the future,
I got a more secure cage made, of which the bars were so close as to
preclude the possibility of egress; and singularly enough, many a morning
was I amused by beholding brown mice coming from their holes in the
wainscot, and approaching the cage in which their friend was kept, as if
in order to condole with him on the subject of his unwonted captivity.Secure, however, as I conceived this new cage to be, my industrious pet
contrived to make his escape from it, and in doing so met his death.In
my room was a large bureau, with deep, old-fashioned, capacious drawers.Being obliged to go from home for a day, I put the cage containing my
little friend into one of these drawers, lest any one should attempt to
meddle with it during my absence.On returning, I opened the drawer,
and just as I did so, heard a faint squeak, and at the same instant my
poor little pet fell from the back of the drawer--lifeless.I took up
his body, and, placing it in my bosom, did my best to restore it to
animation.His little body had been crushed
in the crevice at the back part of the drawer, through which he had been
endeavouring to escape, and he was really and irrecoverably gone.*       *       *       *       *

NOTE ON THE FEEDING, &C., OF WHITE MICE.--Such of my juvenile readers
as may be disposed to make a pet of one of these interesting little
animals, would do well to observe the following rules:--Clean the cage
out daily, and keep it dry; do not keep it in too cold a place; in
winter it should be kept in a room in which there is a fire.Feed the
mice on bread steeped in milk, having first squeezed the milk out, as
too moist food is bad for them.Never give them cheese, as it is apt to
produce fatal disorders, though the more hardy brown mice eat it with
impunity.If you want to give them a treat, give them grains of wheat
or barley, or if these are not to be procured, oats or rice.A little
tin box of water should be constantly left in their cage, but securely
fixed, so that they cannot overturn it.Let the wires be not too slight,
or too long, otherwise the little animals will easily squeeze themselves
between them, and let them be of iron, never of copper, as the animals
are fond of nibbling at them, and the rust of the latter, or _verdigris_,
would quickly poison them.White mice are to be procured at most of the
bird-shops in Patrick’s Close, Dublin; of the wire-workers and bird-cage
makers in Edinburgh; and from all the animal fanciers in London,
whose residences are to be found chiefly on the New Road and about
Knightsbridge.Their prices vary from one shilling to two-and-sixpence
per pair, according to their age and beauty.H. D. R.




THE PROFESSIONS.If what are called the liberal professions could speak, they would
all utter the one cry, “we are overstocked;” and echo would reply
“overstocked.” This has long been a subject of complaint, and yet nobody
seems inclined to mend the matter by making any sacrifice on his own
part--just as in a crowd, to use a familiar illustration, the man who is
loudest in exclaiming “dear me, what pressing and jostling people do keep
here!” never thinks of lightening the pressure by withdrawing his own
person from the mass.There is, however, an advantage to be derived from
the utterance and reiteration of the complaint, if not by those already
in the press, at least by those who are still happily clear of it.There are many “vanities and vexations of spirit” under the sun, but this
evil of professional redundancy seems to be one of very great magnitude.It involves not merely an outlay of much precious time and substance to
no purpose, but in most cases unfits those who constitute the “excess”
from applying themselves afterwards to other pursuits.Such persons are
the primary sufferers; but the community at large participates in the
loss.It cannot but be interesting to inquire to what this tendency may be
owing, and what remedy it might be useful to apply to the evil.Now, it
strikes me that the great cause is the exclusive attention which people
pay to the great prizes, and their total inconsideration of the number of
blanks which accompany them.Life itself has been compared to a lottery;
but in some departments the scheme may be so particularly bad, that it is
nothing short of absolute gambling to purchase a share in it.A few arrive at great eminence, and these few excite the
envy and admiration of all beholders; but they are only a few compared
with the number of those who linger in the shade, and, however anxious to
enjoy the sport, never once get a rap at the ball.Again, parents are apt to look upon the mere name of a profession as a
provision for their children.They calculate all the expenses of general
education, professional education, and then of admission to “liberty to
practise;” and finding all these items amount to a tolerably large sum,
they conceive they have bestowed an ample portion on the son who has cost
them “thus much monies.” But unfortunately they soon learn by experience
that the elevation of a profession, great as it is, does not always
possess that homely recommendation of causing the “pot to boil,” and that
the individual for whom this costly provision has been made, cannot be so
soon left to shift for himself.Here then is another cause of this evil,
namely, that people do not adequately and fairly calculate the whole cost.Of our liberal professions, the army is the only one that yields a
certain income as the produce of the purchase money, But in these “piping
times of peace,” a private soldier in the ranks might as well attempt to
verify the old song, and

    “Spend half a crown out of sixpence a-day,”

as an ensign to pay mess-money and band-money, and all other regulation
monies, keep himself in dress coat and epaulettes, and all the other et
ceteras, upon his mere pay.To live in any
comfort in the army, a subaltern should have an income from some other
source, equal at least in amount to that which he receives through the
hands of the paymaster.The army is, in fact, an expensive profession,
and of all others the least agreeable to one who is prevented, by
circumscribed means, from doing as his brother officers do.Yet the
mistake of venturing to meet all these difficulties is not unfrequently
admitted, with what vain expectation it is needless to inquire.The usual
result is such as one would anticipate, namely, that the rash adventurer,
after incurring debts, or putting his friends to unlooked-for charges, is
obliged after a short time to sell out, and bid farewell for ever to the
unprofitable profession of arms.It would be painful to dwell upon the situation of those who enter other
professions without being duly prepared to wait their turn of employment.It is recognised as a poignantly applicable truth in the profession of
the bar, that “many are called but few are chosen;” but with very few and
rare exceptions indeed, the necessity of _biding_ the time is certain.In the legal and medical professions there is no fixed income, however
small, insured to the adventurer; and unless his circle of friends and
connections be very wide and serviceable indeed, he should make up his
mind for a procrastinated return and a late harvest.But how many from
day to day, and from year to year, do launch their bark upon the ocean,
without any such prudent foresight!The result therefore is, that vast
proportion of disastrous voyages and shipwrecks of which we hear so
constantly.Such is the admitted evil--it is granted on all sides.The question
is, what is to be done?--what is the remedy?Now, the remedy for an
overstocked profession very evidently is, that people should forbear to
enter it.I am no Malthusian on the subject of population: I desire no
unnatural checks upon the increase and multiplication of her Majesty’s
subjects; but I should like to drain off a surplus from certain
situations, and turn off the in-flowing stream into more profitable
channels.I would advise parents, then, to leave the choice of a liberal
profession to those who are able to live without one.Such parties can
afford to wait for advancement, however long it may be in coming, or to
bear up against disappointment, if such should be their lot.With such
it is a safe speculation, and they may be left to indulge in it, if they
think proper.But it will be asked, what is to
be done with the multitudes who would be diverted from the professions,
if this advice were acted upon?I answer, that the money unprofitably
spent upon their education, and in fees of admission to these expensive
pursuits, would insure them a “good location” and a certain provision
for life in Canada, or some of the colonies; and that any honourable
occupation which would yield a competency ought to be preferred to
“professions” which, however “liberal,” hold out to the many but a very
doubtful prospect of that result.It is much to be regretted that there is a prevalent notion among
certain of my countrymen that “trade” is not a “genteel” thing, and
that it must be eschewed by those who have any pretensions to fashion.This unfortunate, and I must say unsound state of opinion, contributes
also, I fear, in no small degree, to that professional redundancy of
which we have been speaking.The supposed absolute necessity of a high
classical education is a natural concomitant of this opinion.All our
schools therefore are eminently classical.The University follows, as a
matter of course, and then the University leads to a liberal profession,
as surely as one step of a ladder conducts to another.Thus the evil is
nourished at the very root.Now, I would take the liberty of advising
those parents who may concur with me in the main point of over-supply in
the professions, to begin at the beginning, and in the education of their
children, to exchange this superabundance of Greek and Latin for the less
elegant but more useful accomplishment of “ciphering.” I am disposed to
concur with that facetious but shrewd fellow, Mr Samuel Slick, upon the
inestimable advantages of that too much neglected art--neglected, I mean,
in our country here, Ireland.He has demonstrated that they do every
thing by it in the States, and that without it they could do nothing.With the most profound respect to my countrymen, then, I would earnestly
recommend them to cultivate it.But it may perhaps be said that there is
no encouragement to mercantile pursuits in Ireland, and that if there
were, there would be no necessity for me to recommend “ciphering” and
its virtues to the people.To this I answer, that merchandize offers
its prizes to the ingenious and venturous much rather than to those who
wait for a “highway” to be made for them.If people were resolved to
live by trade, I think they would contrive to do so--many more, at least,
than at present operate successfully in that department.If more of
education, and more of mind, were turned in that direction, new sources
of profitable industry, at present unthought of, would probably discover
themselves.Much might be said on this subject, but I shall not enter
further into the speculation, quite satisfied if I have thrown out a hint
which may be found capable of improvement by others.The rearing of geese might be more an object of attention to our small
farmers and labourers in the vicinity of bogs and mountain tracts than it
is.The general season for the consumption of fat geese is from Michaelmas to
Christmas, and the high prices paid for them in the English markets--to
which they can be so rapidly conveyed from many parts of Ireland--appear
to offer sufficient temptation to the speculator who has the capital and
accommodation necessary for fattening them.A well-organized system of feeding this hardy and nutritious species of
poultry, in favourable localities, would give a considerable impulse to
the rearing of them, and consequently promote the comforts of many poor
Irish families, who under existing circumstances do not find it worth
while to rear them except in very small numbers.I am led to offer a few suggestions on this subject from having
ascertained that in the Fens of Lincolnshire, notwithstanding a great
decrease there in the breeding of geese from extensive drainage, one
individual, Mr Clarke of Boston, fattens every year, between Michaelmas
and Christmas, the prodigious number of seven thousand geese, and that
another dealer at Spalding prepares for the poultry butcher nearly as
many: these they purchase in lots from the farmers’ wives.Perhaps a few details of the Lincolnshire practice may be acceptable to
some of the readers of this Journal:--

The farmers in the Fens keep breeding stocks proportioned to the extent
of suitable land which they can command; and in order to insure the
fertility of the eggs, they allow one gander to three geese, which is a
higher proportion of males than is deemed necessary elsewhere.The number
of goslings in each brood averages about ten, which, allowing for all
casualties, is a considerable produce.There have been extraordinary instances of individual fecundity, on
which, however, it would be as absurd for any goose-breeder to calculate,
as it is proverbially unwise to reckon chickens before they are hatched;
and this fruitfulness is only attainable by constant feeding with
stimulating food through the preceding winter.A goose has been known to lay seventy eggs within twelve months,
twenty-six in the spring, before the time of incubation, and (after
bringing out seventeen goslings) the remainder by the end of the year.The white variety is preferred to the grey or party-, as the
birds of this colour feed more kindly, and their feathers are worth three
shillings a stone more than the others: the quality of the land, however,
on which the breeding stock is to be maintained, decides this matter,
generally strong land being necessary for the support of the white or
larger kind.Under all circumstances a white gander is preferred, in
order to have a large progeny.It has been remarked, but I know not if
with reason, that ganders are more frequently white than the females.To state all the particulars of hatching and rearing would be
superfluous, and mere repetition of what is contained in the various
works on poultry.I shall merely state some of the peculiarities of the
practice in the county of Lincoln.When the young geese are brought up at different periods by the great
dealers, they are put into pens together, according to their age, size,
and condition, and fed on steamed potatoes and ground oats, in the ratio
of one measure of oats to three of potatoes.By unremitting care as to
cleanliness, pure water, and constant feeding, these geese are fattened
in about three weeks, at an average cost of one penny per day each.The _cramming_ system, either by the fingers or the forcing pump,
described by French writers, with the accompanying barbarities of
blinding, nailing the feet to the floor, or confinement in perforated
casks or earthen pots (as is said to be the case sometimes in Poland),
are happily unknown in Lincolnshire, and I may add throughout England,
with one exception--the nailing of the feet to boards.The unequivocal
proofs of this may occasionally, but very rarely, be seen in the geese
brought into the London markets: these, however, may possibly be imported
ones, though I fear they are not so.The Lincolnshire dealers do not give any of those rich greasy pellets
of barley meal and hot liquor, which always spoil the flavour, to their
geese, as they well know that oats is the best feeding for them; barley,
besides being more expensive, renders the flesh loose and insipid, and
rather _chickeny_ in flavour.Every point of economy on this subject is matter of great moment, on the
vast scale pursued by Mr Clarke, who pays seven hundred pounds a-year
for the mere conveyance of his birds to the London market; a fact which
gives a tolerable notion of the great extent of capital employed in this
business, the extent of which is scarcely conceivable by my agricultural
countrymen.Little cost, however, is incurred by those who breed the geese, as the
stock are left to provide for themselves, except in the laying season,
and in feeding the goslings until they are old enough to eat grass or
feed on the stubbles.I have no doubt, however, that the cramp would be
less frequently experienced, if solid food were added to the grass, when
the geese are turned out to graze, although Mr Clarke attributes the
cramp, as well as gout and fever, to too close confinement alone.This
opinion does not correspond with my far more limited observation, which
leads me to believe that the cramp attacks goslings most frequently when
they are at large, and left to shift for themselves on green food alone,
and that of the poorest kind.I should think it good economy to give
them, and the old stagers too, all spare garden vegetables, for loss of
condition is prejudicial to them as well as to other animals.Mr Cobbett
used to fatten his young geese, from June to October, on Swedish turnips,
carrots, white cabbages, or lettuces, with some corn.Swedish turnips no doubt will answer very well, but not so well as
farinaceous potatoes, when immediate profit is the object.The experience
of such an extensive dealer as Mr Clarke is worth volumes of theory
and conjecture as to the mode of feeding, and he decides in favour of
potatoes and oats.The treatment for cramp and fever in Lincolnshire is bleeding--I know not
if it be hazarded in gout--but as it is not successful in the cases of
cramp in one instance out of twenty, it may be pronounced inefficacious.I have had occasion lately to remark in this Journal on the general
disinclination in England to the barbarous custom of plucking geese
alive.In Lincolnshire, however, they do so with the breeding stock three
times in the year, beginning at midsummer, and repeating the operation
twice afterwards, at intervals of six weeks between the operations.The practice is defended on the plea, that if the feathers be matured,
the geese are better for it, while it is of course admitted that the
birds must be injured more or less--according to the handling by the
pluckers--if the feathers be not ripe.But as birds do not moult three
times in the year, I do not understand how it should be correctly said
that the feathers _can_ be ripe on these three occasions.How does nature
suggest the propriety of stripping the feathers so often?Where great
numbers are kept, the loss by allowing the feathers to drop on the ground
would be serious, and on this account alone can even one stripping be
justified.In proof of the general opinion that the goose is extremely long-lived,
we have many recorded facts; among them the following:--“In 1824 there
was a goose living in the possession of Mr Hewson of Glenham, near
Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, which was then upwards of a century old.It
had been throughout that term in the constant possession of Mr Hewson’s
forefathers and himself, and on quitting his farm he would not suffer
it to be sold with his other stock, but made a present of it to the
in-coming tenant, that the venerable fowl might terminate its career on
the spot where its useful life had been spent such a length of days.”

The taste which has long prevailed among gourmands for the liver of a
goose, and has led to the enormous cruelties exercised in order to cause
its enlargement by rendering the bird diseased in that organ through high
and forced feeding in a warm temperature and close confinement, is well
known; but I doubt if many are aware of the influence of _charcoal_ in
producing an unnatural state of the liver.I had read of charcoal being put into a trough of water to sweeten it for
geese when cooped up; but from a passage in a recent work by Liebig it
would appear that the charcoal acts not as a sweetener of the water, but
in another way on the constitution of the goose.I am tempted to give the extract from its novelty:--“The production of
flesh and fat may be artificially increased: all domestic animals, for
example, contain much fat.We give food to animals which increases the
activity of certain organs, and is itself capable of being transformed
into fat.We add to the quantity of food, or we lessen the progress
of respiration and perspiration by preventing motion.The conditions
necessary to effect this purpose in birds are different from those in
quadrupeds; and it is well known that charcoal powder produces such an
excessive growth in the liver of a goose as at length causes the death of
the animal.”

We are much inferior to the English in the art of preparing poultry for
the market; and this is the more to be regretted in the instance of
geese, especially as we can supply potatoes--which I have shown to be
the chief material of their fattening food--at half their cost in many
parts of England.This advantage alone ought to render the friends of our
agricultural poor earnest in promoting the rearing and fattening of geese
in localities favourable for the purpose.The encouragement of our native manufactures is now a general topic of
conversation and interest, and we hope the present excitement of the
public mind on this subject will be productive of permanent good.We also
hope that the encouragement proposed to be given to articles of Irish
manufacture will be extended to the productions of the head as well as to
those of the hands; that the manufacturer of Irish wit and humour will be
deemed worthy of support as well as those of silks, woollens, or felts;
and, that Irishmen shall venture to estimate the value of Irish produce
for themselves, without waiting as heretofore till they get “the London
stamp” upon them, as our play-going people of old times used to do in the
case of the eminent Irish actors.We are indeed greatly inclined to believe that our Irish manufactures
are rising in estimation in England, from the fact which has come to
our knowledge that many thousands of our Belfast hams are sold annually
at the other side of the water as genuine Yorkshire, and also that many
of those Belfast hams with the Yorkshire stamp find their way back into
“Ould Ireland,” and are bought as English by those who would despise
them as Irish.Now, we should like our countrymen not to be gulled in
this way, but depend upon their own judgment in the matter of hams, and
in like manner in the matter of articles of Irish literary manufacture,
without waiting for the London stamp to be put on them.The necessity
for such discrimination and confidence in their own judgment exists
equally in hams and literature.Thus certain English editors approve so
highly of our articles in the Irish Penny Journal, that they copy them
by wholesale, not only without acknowledgment, but actually do us the
favour to father them as their own!As an example of this patronage, we
may refer to a recent number of the Court Gazette, in which its editor
has been entertaining his aristocratic readers with a little piece of
_badinage_ from our Journal, expressly written for us, and entitled “A
short chapter on Bustles,” but which he gives as written for the said
Court Gazette!Now, this is really very considerate and complimentary,
and we of course feel grateful.But, better again, we find our able and
kind friend the editor of the _Monitor_ and _Irishman_, presenting, no
doubt inadvertently, this very article to his Irish readers a few weeks
ago--not even as an Irish article that had got the London stamp upon it,
but as actually one of true British manufacture--the produce of the Court
Gazette.Now, in perfect good humour, we ask our friend, as such we have reason to
consider him, could he not as well have copied this article from our own
Journal, and given us the credit of it--and would it not be worthy of the
consistency and patriotism of the _Irishman_, who writes so ably in the
cause of Irish manufactures, to extend his support, as far as might be
compatible with truth and honesty, to the native literature of Ireland?*       *       *       *       *

How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,
And know if he have wrong'd me.A small grate
Within that mew, which for my sake the name
Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,
Already through its opening sev'ral moons
Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,
That from the future tore the curtain off.This one, methought, as master of the sport,
Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight
Of Lucca to the Pisan.With lean brachs
Inquisitive and keen, before him rang'd
Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.After short course the father and the sons
Seem'd tir'd and lagging, and methought I saw
The sharp tusks gore their sides.When I awoke
Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard
My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask
For bread.Right cruel art thou, if no pang
Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;
And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?Now had they waken'd; and the hour drew near
When they were wont to bring us food; the mind
Of each misgave him through his dream, and I
Heard, at its outlet underneath lock'd up
The' horrible tower: whence uttering not a word
I look'd upon the visage of my sons.I wept not: so all stone I felt within.They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:
"Thou lookest so!Yet
I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day
Nor the next night, until another sun
Came out upon the world.When a faint beam
Had to our doleful prison made its way,
And in four countenances I descry'd
The image of my own, on either hand
Through agony I bit, and they who thought
I did it through desire of feeding, rose
O' th' sudden, and cried, 'Father, we should grieve
Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav'st
These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,

'And do thou strip them off from us again.'Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down
My spirit in stillness.That day and the next
We all were silent.When we came
To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet
Outstretch'd did fling him, crying, 'Hast no help
For me, my father!'There he died, and e'en
Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three
Fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth:

"Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope

Call'd on them who were dead.Thus having spoke,

Firm and unyielding.shame
Of all the people, who their dwelling make
In that fair region, where th' Italian voice
Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack
To punish, from their deep foundations rise
Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up
The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee
May perish in the waters!What if fame
Reported that thy castles were betray'd
By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou
To stretch his children on the rack.For them,
Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair
Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,
Their tender years, thou modern Thebes!Onward we pass'd,
Where others skarf'd in rugged folds of ice
Not on their feet were turn'd, but each revers'd.There very weeping suffers not to weep;
For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
Impediment, and rolling inward turns
For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears
Hang cluster'd, and like crystal vizors show,
Under the socket brimming all the cup.Now though the cold had from my face dislodg'd
Each feeling, as 't were callous, yet me seem'd
Some breath of wind I felt."Whence cometh this,"
Said I, "my master?Is not here below
All vapour quench'd?"--"'Thou shalt be speedily,"
He answer'd, "where thine eye shall tell thee whence
The cause descrying of this airy shower."Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn'd:
"O souls so cruel!that the farthest post
Hath been assign'd you, from this face remove
The harden'd veil, that I may vent the grief
Impregnate at my heart, some little space
Ere it congeal again!"I thus replied:
"Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;
And if I extricate thee not, far down
As to the lowest ice may I descend!""The friar Alberigo," answered he,
"Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd
Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date
More luscious for my fig."--"Hah!"I exclaim'd,
"Art thou too dead!"--"How in the world aloft
It fareth with my body," answer'd he,
"I am right ignorant.Such privilege
Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul
Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc'd.And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
The glazed tear-drops that o'erlay mine eyes,
Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,
As I did, yields her body to a fiend
Who after moves and governs it at will,
Till all its time be rounded; headlong she
Falls to this cistern.And perchance above
Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,
Who here behind me winters.Him thou know'st,
If thou but newly art arriv'd below.The years are many that have pass'd away,
Since to this fastness Branca Doria came.""Now," answer'd I, "methinks thou mockest me,
For Branca Doria never yet hath died,
But doth all natural functions of a man,
Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on."He thus: "Not yet unto that upper foss
By th' evil talons guarded, where the pitch
Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach'd,
When this one left a demon in his stead
In his own body, and of one his kin,
Who with him treachery wrought.But now put forth
Thy hand, and ope mine eyes."men perverse in every way,
With every foulness stain'd, why from the earth

"THE banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth
Towards us; therefore look," so spake my guide,
"If thou discern him."As, when breathes a cloud
Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night
Fall on our hemisphere, seems view'd from far
A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,
Such was the fabric then methought I saw,

To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew
Behind my guide: no covert else was there.Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain
Record the marvel) where the souls were all
Whelm'd underneath, transparent, as through glass
Pellucid the frail stem.Some prone were laid,
Others stood upright, this upon the soles,
That on his head, a third with face to feet
Arch'd like a bow.When to the point we came,
Whereat my guide was pleas'd that I should see
The creature eminent in beauty once,
He from before me stepp'd and made me pause.and lo the place,
Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."How frozen and how faint I then became,
Ask me not, reader!for I write it not,
Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.Think thyself
If quick conception work in thee at all,
How I did feel.That emperor, who sways
The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice
Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
A giant, than the giants are in his arms.Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits
With such a part.If he were beautiful
As he is hideous now, and yet did dare
To scowl upon his Maker, well from him
May all our mis'ry flow.How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy
Upon his head three faces: one in front
Of hue vermilion, th' other two with this
Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;
The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left
To look on, such as come from whence old Nile
Stoops to the lowlands.Under each shot forth
Two mighty wings, enormous as became
A bird so vast.Sails never such I saw
Outstretch'd on the wide sea.No plumes had they,
But were in texture like a bat, and these
He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still
Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth
Was frozen.At six eyes he wept: the tears
Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd
Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that three
Were in this guise tormented.But far more
Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd
By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back
Was stript of all its skin."That upper spirit,
Who hath worse punishment," so spake my guide,
"Is Judas, he that hath his head within
And plies the feet without.Of th' other two,
Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw
Who hangs, is Brutus: lo!how he doth writhe
And speaks not!Th' other Cassius, that appears
So large of limb.But night now re-ascends,
And it is time for parting.I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;
And noting time and place, he, when the wings
Enough were op'd, caught fast the shaggy sides,
And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd
Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh
Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,
My leader there with pain and struggling hard
Turn'd round his head, where his feet stood before,
And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,
That into hell methought we turn'd again."Expect that by such stairs as these," thus spake
The teacher, panting like a man forespent,
"We must depart from evil so extreme."Then at a rocky opening issued forth,
And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next join'd
With wary step my side.I rais'd mine eyes,
Believing that I Lucifer should see
Where he was lately left, but saw him now
With legs held upward.Let the grosser sort,
Who see not what the point was I had pass'd,
Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then."Arise," my master cried, "upon thy feet.The way is long, and much uncouth the road;
And now within one hour and half of noon
The sun returns."It was no palace-hall
Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,
But natural dungeon where ill footing was
And scant supply of light."Ere from th' abyss
I sep'rate," thus when risen I began,
"My guide!vouchsafe few words to set me free
From error's thralldom.How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?And how from eve to morn in space so brief
Hath the sun made his transit?"He in few
Thus answering spake: "Thou deemest thou art still
On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd
Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I
Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass
That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd
All heavy substance.Thou art now arriv'd
Under the hemisphere opposed to that,
Which the great continent doth overspread,
And underneath whose canopy expir'd
The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd.Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,
Whose other aspect is Judecca.Morn
Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,
Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,
As at the first.On this part he fell down
From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,
And to our hemisphere retir'd.Perchance
To shun him was the vacant space left here
By what of firm land on this side appears,
That sprang aloof."There is a place beneath,
From Belzebub as distant, as extends
The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,
But by the sound of brooklet, that descends
This way along the hollow of a rock,
Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,
The wave hath eaten.By that hidden way
My guide and I did enter, to return
To the fair world: and heedless of repose
We climbed, he first, I following his steps,
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.said
Eachin, who seemed very attentive."To my resolution," answered Simon; "for I think nothing can make a
man so bold to face one danger at some distance in his front as the
knowledge of another close behind him, to push him forward.Well, I
mounted the walls in tolerable heart, and was placed with others on the
Spey Tower, being accounted a good bowman.But a very cold fit seized me
as I saw the English, in great order, with their archers in front,
and their men at arms behind, marching forward to the attack in strong
columns, three in number.They came on steadily, and some of us would
fain have shot at them; but it was strictly forbidden, and we were
obliged to remain motionless, sheltering ourselves behind the battlement
as we best might.As the Southron formed their long ranks into lines,
each man occupying his place as by magic, and preparing to cover
themselves by large shields, called pavesses, which they planted before
them, I again felt a strange breathlessness, and some desire to go home
for a glass of distilled waters.But as I looked aside, I saw the worthy
Kempe of Kinfauns bending a large crossbow, and I thought it pity he
should waste the bolt on a true hearted Scotsman, when so many English
were in presence; so I e'en staid where I was, being in a comfortable
angle, formed by two battlements.The English then strode forward, and
drew their bowstrings--not to the breast, as your Highland kerne do, but
to the ear--and sent off their volleys of swallow tails before we could
call on St.I winked when I saw them haul up their tackle, and I
believe I started as the shafts began to rattle against the parapet.But looking round me, and seeing none hurt but John Squallit, the town
crier, whose jaws were pierced through with a cloth yard shaft, I took
heart of grace, and shot in my turn with good will and good aim.A
little man I shot at, who had just peeped out from behind his target,
dropt with a shaft through his shoulder.The provost cried, 'Well
stitched, Simon Glover!'John, for his own town, my fellow
craftsmen!'shouted I, though I was then but an apprentice.And if you
will believe me, in the rest of the skirmish, which was ended by the
foes drawing off, I drew bowstring and loosed shaft as calmly as if
I had been shooting at butts instead of men's breasts.I gained
some credit, and I have ever afterwards thought that, in case of
necessity--for with me it had never been matter of choice--I should not
have lost it again.And this is all I can tell of warlike experience in
battle.Other dangers I have had, which I have endeavoured to avoid like
a wise man, or, when they were inevitable, I have faced them like a
true one.Upon other terms a man cannot live or hold up his head in
Scotland.""I understand your tale," said Eachin; "but I shall find it difficult
to make you credit mine, knowing the race of which I am descended, and
especially that I am the son of him whom we have this day laid in the
tomb--well that he lies where he will never learn what you are now to
hear!Look, my father, the light which I bear grows short and pale, a
few minutes will extinguish it; but before it expires, the hideous tale
will be told.Father, I am--a COWARD!It is said at last, and the secret
of my disgrace is in keeping of another!"The young man sunk back in a species of syncope, produced by the agony
of his mind as he made the fatal communication.The glover, moved as
well by fear as by compassion, applied himself to recall him to life,
and succeeded in doing so, but not in restoring him to composure.He hid
his face with his hands, and his tears flowed plentifully and bitterly."For Our Lady's sake, be composed," said the old man, "and recall the
vile word!I know you better than yourself: you are no coward, but only
too young and inexperienced, ay, and somewhat too quick of fancy, to
have the steady valour of a bearded man.I would hear no other man say
that of you, Conachar, without giving him the lie.You are no coward:
I have seen high sparks of spirit fly from you even on slight enough
provocation."said the unfortunate youth; "but
when saw you them supported by the resolution that should have backed
them?The sparks you speak of fell on my dastardly heart as on a piece
of ice which could catch fire from nothing: if my offended pride urged
me to strike, my weakness of mind prompted me the next moment to fly.""Want of habit," said Simon; "it is by clambering over walls that youths
learn to scale precipices.Begin with slight feuds; exercise daily the
arms of your country in tourney with your followers."exclaimed the young chief,
starting as if something horrid had occurred to his imagination."How
many days are there betwixt this hour and Palm Sunday, and what is to
chance then?A list inclosed, from which no man can stir, more than the
poor bear who is chained to his stake.Sixty living men, the best
and fiercest--one alone excepted!--which Albyn can send down from her
mountains, all athirst for each other's blood, while a king and his
nobles, and shouting thousands besides, attend, as at a theatre, to
encourage their demoniac fury!Blows clang and blood flows, thicker,
faster, redder; they rush on each other like madmen, they tear each
other like wild beasts; the wounded are trodden to death amid the feet
of their companions!Blood ebbs, arms become weak; but there must be
no parley, no truce, no interruption, while any of the maimed wretches
remain alive!Here is no crouching behind battlements, no fighting with
missile weapons: all is hand to hand, till hands can no longer be raised
to maintain the ghastly conflict!If such a field is so horrible in
idea, what think you it will be in reality?""I can only pity you, Conachar," said Simon."It is hard to be the
descendant of a lofty line--the son of a noble father--the leader by
birth of a gallant array, and yet to want, or think you want, for
still I trust the fault lies much in a quick fancy, that over estimates
danger--to want that dogged quality which is possessed by every game
cock that is worth a handful of corn, every hound that is worth a
mess of offal.But how chanced it that, with such a consciousness of
inability to fight in this battle, you proffered even now to share your
chiefdom with my daughter?Your power must depend on your fighting this
combat, and in that Catharine cannot help you.""You mistake, old man," replied Eachin: "were Catharine to look kindly
on the earnest love I bear her, it would carry me against the front of
the enemies with the mettle of a war horse.Overwhelming as my sense
of weakness is, the feeling that Catharine looked on would give me
strength.Say yet--oh, say yet--she shall be mine if we gain the combat,
and not the Gow Chrom himself, whose heart is of a piece with his
anvil, ever went to battle so light as I shall do!One strong passion is
conquered by another."Cannot the recollection of your interest, your
honour, your kindred, do as much to stir your courage as the thoughts of
a brent browed lass?"You tell me but what I have told myself, but it is in vain," replied
Eachin, with a sigh."It is only whilst the timid stag is paired with
the doe that he is desperate and dangerous.Be it from constitution; be
it, as our Highland cailliachs will say, from the milk of the white
doe; be it from my peaceful education and the experience of your strict
restraint; be it, as you think, from an overheated fancy, which paints
danger yet more dangerous and ghastly than it is in reality, I cannot
tell.But I know my failing, and--yes, it must be said!--so sorely dread
that I cannot conquer it, that, could I have your consent to my wishes
on such terms, I would even here make a pause, renounce the rank I have
assumed, and retire into humble life.""What, turn glover at last, Conachar?""This beats the
legend of St.Nay--nay, your hand was not framed for that: you
shall spoil me no more doe skins.""Jest not," said Eachin, "I am serious.If I cannot labour, I will bring
wealth enough to live without it.They will proclaim me recreant with
horn and war pipe.Catharine will love me the better
that I have preferred the paths of peace to those of bloodshed, and
Father Clement shall teach us to pity and forgive the world, which will
load us with reproaches that wound not.I shall be the happiest of men;
Catharine will enjoy all that unbounded affection can confer upon her,
and will be freed from apprehension of the sights and sounds of horror
which your ill assorted match would have prepared for her; and you,
father Glover, shall occupy your chimney corner, the happiest and most
honoured man that ever--"

"Hold, Eachin--I prithee, hold," said the glover; "the fir light, with
which this discourse must terminate, burns very low, and I would speak
a word in my turn, and plain dealing is best.Though it may vex,
or perhaps enrage, you, let me end these visions by saying at once:
Catharine can never be yours.A glove is the emblem of faith, and a
man of my craft should therefore less than any other break his own.Catharine's hand is promised--promised to a man whom you may hate, but
whom you must honour--to Henry the armourer.The match is fitting by
degree, agreeable to their mutual wishes, and I have given my promise.It is best to be plain at once; resent my refusal as you will--I am
wholly in your power.The glover spoke thus decidedly, because he was aware from experience
that the very irritable disposition of his former apprentice yielded in
most cases to stern and decided resolution.Yet, recollecting where he
was, it was with some feelings of fear that he saw the dying flame leap
up and spread a flash of light on the visage of Eachin, which seemed
pale as the grave, while his eye rolled like that of a maniac in his
fever fit.The light instantly sunk down and died, and Simon felt a
momentary terror lest he should have to dispute for his life with
the youth, whom he knew to be capable of violent actions when highly
excited, however short a period his nature could support the measures
which his passion commenced.He was relieved by the voice of Eachin, who
muttered in a hoarse and altered tone:

"Let what we have spoken this night rest in silence for ever.If thou
bring'st it to light, thou wert better dig thine own grave."Thus speaking, the door of the hut opened, admitting a gleam of
moonshine.The form of the retiring chief crossed it for an instant, the
hurdle was then closed, and the shieling left in darkness.Simon Glover felt relieved when a conversation fraught with offence and
danger was thus peaceably terminated.But he remained deeply affected by
the condition of Hector MacIan, whom he had himself bred up."The poor child," said he, "to be called up to a place of eminence,
only to be hurled from it with contempt!What he told me I partly knew,
having often remarked that Conachar was more prone to quarrel than to
fight.But this overpowering faint heartedness, which neither shame
nor necessity can overcome, I, though no Sir William Wallace, cannot
conceive.And to propose himself for a husband to my daughter, as if
a bride were to find courage for herself and the bridegroom!No--no,
Catharine must wed a man to whom she may say, 'Husband, spare your
enemy'--not one in whose behalf she must cry, 'Generous enemy, spare my
husband!"Tired out with these reflections, the old man at length fell asleep.In the morning he was awakened by his friend the Booshalloch, who, with
something of a blank visage, proposed to him to return to his abode on
the meadow at the Ballough.He apologised that the chief could not see
Simon Glover that morning, being busied with things about the expected
combat; and that Eachin MacIan thought the residence at the Ballough
would be safest for Simon Glover's health, and had given charge that
every care should be taken for his protection and accommodation.Niel Booshalloch dilated on these circumstances, to gloss over the
neglect implied in the chief's dismissing his visitor without a
particular audience."His father knew better," said the herdsman."But where should he have
learned manners, poor thing, and bred up among your Perth burghers, who,
excepting yourself, neighbour Glover, who speak Gaelic as well as I do,
are a race incapable of civility?"Simon Glover, it may be well believed, felt none of the want of respect
which his friend resented on his account.On the contrary, he greatly
preferred the quiet residence of the good herdsman to the tumultuous
hospitality of the daily festival of the chief, even if there had not
just passed an interview with Eachin upon a subject which it would be
most painful to revive.To the Ballough, therefore, he quietly retreated, where, could he have
been secure of Catharine's safety, his leisure was spent pleasantly
enough.His amusement was sailing on the lake in a little skiff, which a
Highland boy managed, while the old man angled.He frequently landed
on the little island, where he mused over the tomb of his old friend
Gilchrist MacIan, and made friends with the monks, presenting the prior
with gloves of martens' fur, and the superior officers with each of them
a pair made from the skin of the wildcat.The cutting and stitching of
these little presents served to beguile the time after sunset, while
the family of the herdsman crowded around, admiring his address, and
listening to the tales and songs with which the old man had skill to
pass away a heavy evening.It must be confessed that the cautious glover avoided the conversation
of Father Clement, whom he erroneously considered as rather the author
of his misfortunes than the guiltless sharer of them."I will not," he
thought, "to please his fancies, lose the goodwill of these kind
monks, which may be one day useful to me.I have suffered enough by his
preachments already, I trow.Little the wiser and much the poorer they
have made me.No--no, Catharine and Clement may think as they will; but
I will take the first opportunity to sneak back like a rated hound at
the call of his master, submit to a plentiful course of haircloth and
whipcord, disburse a lusty mulct, and become whole with the church
again."More than a fortnight had passed since the glover had arrived at
Ballough, and he began to wonder that he had not heard news of Catharine
or of Henry Wynd, to whom he concluded the provost had communicated the
plan and place of his retreat.He knew the stout smith dared not come
up into the Clan Quhele country, on account of various feuds with
the inhabitants, and with Eachin himself, while bearing the name of
Conachar; but yet the glover thought Henry might have found means to
send him a message, or a token, by some one of the various couriers who
passed and repassed between the court and the headquarters of the Clan
Quhele, in order to concert the terms of the impending combat, the
march of the parties to Perth, and other particulars requiring previous
adjustment.It was now the middle of March, and the fatal Palm Sunday
was fast approaching.Whilst time was thus creeping on, the exiled glover had not even once
set eyes upon his former apprentice.The care that was taken to attend
to his wants and convenience in every respect showed that he was not
forgotten; but yet, when he heard the chieftain's horn ringing through
the woods, he usually made it a point to choose his walk in a different
direction.One morning, however, he found himself unexpectedly in
Eachin's close neighbourhood, with scarce leisure to avoid him, and thus
it happened.As Simon strolled pensively through a little silvan glade, surrounded
on either side with tall forest trees, mixed with underwood, a white doe
broke from the thicket, closely pursued by two deer greyhounds, one
of which griped her haunch, the other her throat, and pulled her down
within half a furlong of the glover, who was something startled at the
suddenness of the incident.The ear and piercing blast of a horn, and
the baying of a slow hound, made Simon aware that the hunters were close
behind, and on the trace of the deer.Hallooing and the sound of
men running through the copse were heard close at hand.A moment's
recollection would have satisfied Simon that his best way was to stand
fast, or retire slowly, and leave it to Eachin to acknowledge his
presence or not, as he should see cause.But his desire of shunning the
young man had grown into a kind of instinct, and in the alarm of finding
him so near, Simon hid himself in a bush of hazels mixed with holly,
which altogether concealed him.He had hardly done so ere Eachin, rosy
with exercise, dashed from the thicket into the open glade, accompanied
by his foster father, Torquil of the Oak.The latter, with equal
strength and address, turned the struggling hind on her back, and
holding her forefeet in his right hand, while he knelt on her body,
offered his skene with the left to the young chief, that he might cut
the animal's throat."It may not be, Torquil; do thine office, and take the assay thyself.I
must not kill the likeness of my foster--"

This was spoken with a melancholy smile, while a tear at the same time
stood in the speaker's eye.Torquil stared at his young chief for an
instant, then drew his sharp wood knife across the creature's throat
with a cut so swift and steady that the weapon reached the backbone.Then rising on his feet, and again fixing a long piercing look on his
chief, he said: "As much as I have done to that hind would I do to any
living man whose ears could have heard my dault (foster son) so much as
name a white doe, and couple the word with Hector's name!"If Simon had no reason before to keep himself concealed, this speech of
Torquil furnished him with a pressing one."It cannot be concealed, father Torquil," said Eachin: "it will all out
to the broad day.""It is the fatal secret," thought Simon; "and now, if this huge privy
councillor cannot keep silence, I shall be made answerable, I suppose,
for Eachin's disgrace having been blown abroad."Thinking thus anxiously, he availed himself at the same time of his
position to see as much as he could of what passed between the afflicted
chieftain and his confidant, impelled by that spirit of curiosity which
prompts us in the most momentous, as well as the most trivial, occasions
of life, and which is sometimes found to exist in company with great
personal fear.As Torquil listened to what Eachin communicated, the young man sank
into his arms, and, supporting himself on his shoulder, concluded his
confession by a whisper into his ear.Torquil seemed to listen with such
amazement as to make him incapable of crediting his ears.As if to be
certain that it was Eachin who spoke, he gradually roused the youth from
his reclining posture, and, holding him up in some measure by a grasp on
his shoulder, fixed on him an eye that seemed enlarged, and at the same
time turned to stone, by the marvels he listened to.And so wild waxed
the old man's visage after he had heard the murmured communication,
that Simon Glover apprehended he would cast the youth from him as a
dishonoured thing, in which case he might have lighted among the very
copse in which he lay concealed, and occasioned his discovery in a
manner equally painful and dangerous.But the passions of Torquil,
who entertained for his foster child even a double portion of that
passionate fondness which always attends that connexion in the Highlands
took a different turn."I believe it not," he exclaimed; "it is false of thy father's child,
false of thy mother's son, falsest of my dault!I offer my gage to
heaven and hell, and will maintain the combat with him that shall call
it true.Thou hast been spellbound by an evil eye, my darling, and the
fainting which you call cowardice is the work of magic.I remember the
bat that struck the torch out on the hour that thou wert born--that hour
of grief and of joy.Thou shalt with me to Iona,
and the good St.Columbus, with the whole choir of blessed saints and
angels, who ever favoured thy race, shall take from thee the heart of
the white doe and return that which they have stolen from thee."Eachin listened, with a look as if he would fain have believed the words
of the comforter."But, Torquil," he said, "supposing this might avail us, the fatal day
approaches, and if I go to the lists, I dread me we shall be shamed.""Hell shall not prevail so
far: we will steep thy sword in holy water, place vervain, St.John's
Wort, and rowan tree in thy crest.We will surround thee, I and thy
eight brethren: thou shalt be safe as in a castle."Again the youth helplessly uttered something, which, from the dejected
tone in which it was spoken, Simon could not understand, while Torquil's
deep tones in reply fell full and distinct upon his ear."Yes, there may be a chance of withdrawing thee from the conflict.Thou
art the youngest who is to draw blade.Now, hear me, and thou shalt know
what it is to have a foster father's love, and how far it exceeds the
love even of kinsmen.The youngest on the indenture of the Clan Chattan
is Ferquhard Day.His father slew mine, and the red blood is seething
hot between us; I looked to Palm Sunday as the term that should cool it.Thou wouldst have thought that the blood in the veins of this
Ferquhard Day and in mine would not have mingled had they been put into
the same vessel, yet hath he cast the eyes of his love upon my only
daughter Eva, the fairest of our maidens.Think with what feelings I
heard the news.It was as if a wolf from the skirts of Farragon had
said, 'Give me thy child in wedlock, Torquil.'My child thought not
thus: she loves Ferquhard, and weeps away her colour and strength in
dread of the approaching battle.Let her give him but a sign of favour,
and well I know he will forget kith and kin, forsake the field, and fly
with her to the desert.""He, the youngest of the champions of Clan Chattan, being absent, I, the
youngest of the Clan Quhele, may be excused from combat" said Eachin,
blushing at the mean chance of safety thus opened to him."See now, my chief;" said Torquil, "and judge my thoughts towards
thee: others might give thee their own lives and that of their sons--I
sacrifice to thee the honour of my house.""My friend--my father," repeated the chief, folding Torquil to his
bosom, "what a base wretch am I that have a spirit dastardly enough to
avail myself of your sacrifice!"Let us back to the camp, and
send our gillies for the venison.The slowhound, or lyme dog, luckily for Simon, had drenched his nose in
the blood of the deer, else he might have found the glover's lair in the
thicket; but its more acute properties of scent being lost, it followed
tranquilly with the gazehounds.When the hunters were out of sight and hearing, the glover arose,
greatly relieved by their departure, and began to move off in the
opposite direction as fast as his age permitted.His first reflection
was on the fidelity of the foster father."The wild mountain heart is faithful and true.Yonder man is more like
the giants in romaunts than a man of mould like ourselves; and yet
Christians might take an example from him for his lealty.A simple
contrivance this, though, to finger a man from off their enemies'
chequer, as if there would not be twenty of the wildcats ready to supply
his place."Thus thought the glover, not aware that the strictest proclamations
were issued, prohibiting any of the two contending clans, their friends,
allies, and dependants, from coming within fifty miles of Perth, during
a week before and a week after the combat, which regulation was to be
enforced by armed men.So soon as our friend Simon arrived at the habitation of the herdsman,
he found other news awaiting him.They were brought by Father Clement,
who came in a pilgrim's cloak, or dalmatic, ready to commence his return
to the southward, and desirous to take leave of his companion in exile,
or to accept him as a travelling companion."But what," said the citizen, "has so suddenly induced you to return
within the reach of danger?""Have you not heard," said Father Clement, "that, March and his English
allies having retired into England before the Earl of Douglas, the good
earl has applied himself to redress the evils of the commonwealth, and
hath written to the court letters desiring that the warrant for the High
Court of Commission against heresy be withdrawn, as a trouble to men's
consciences, that the nomination of Henry of Wardlaw to be prelate of
St.Andrews be referred to the Parliament, with sundry other things
pleasing to the Commons?Now, most of the nobles that are with the King
at Perth, and with them Sir Patrick Charteris, your worthy provost, have
declared for the proposals of the Douglas.The Duke of Albany had agreed
to them--whether from goodwill or policy I know not.The good King is
easily persuaded to mild and gentle courses.And thus are the jaw
teeth of the oppressors dashed to pieces in their sockets, and the prey
snatched from their ravening talons.Will you with me to the Lowlands,
or do you abide here a little space?"Neil Booshalloch saved his friend the trouble of reply."He had the chief's authority," he said, "for saying that Simon Glover
should abide until the champions went down to the battle."In this answer the citizen saw something not quite consistent with his
own perfect freedom of volition; but he cared little for it at the
time, as it furnished a good apology for not travelling along with the
clergyman."An exemplary man," he said to his friend Niel Booshalloch, as soon as
Father Clement had taken leave--"a great scholar and a great saint.It
is a pity almost he is no longer in danger to be burned, as his sermon
at the stake would convert thousands.O Niel Booshalloch, Father
Clement's pile would be a sweet savouring sacrifice and a beacon to
all decent Christians!But what would the burning of a borrel ignorant
burgess like me serve?Men offer not up old glove leather for incense,
nor are beacons fed with undressed hides, I trow.Sooth to speak, I have
too little learning and too much fear to get credit by the affair, and,
therefore, I should, in our homely phrase, have both the scathe and the
scorn.""True for you," answered the herdsman.We must return to the characters of our dramatic narrative whom we
     left at Perth, when we accompanied the glover and his fair daughter
     to Kinfauns, and from that hospitable mansion traced the course of
     Simon to Loch Tay; and the Prince, as the highest personage, claims
     our immediate attention.This rash and inconsiderate young man endured with some impatience his
sequestered residence with the Lord High Constable, with whose company,
otherwise in every respect satisfactory, he became dissatisfied, from
no other reason than that he held in some degree the character of his
warder.Incensed against his uncle and displeased with his father, he
longed, not unnaturally, for the society of Sir John Ramorny, on whom he
had been so long accustomed to throw himself for amusement, and, though
he would have resented the imputation as an insult, for guidance and
direction.He therefore sent him a summons to attend him, providing his
health permitted; and directed him to come by water to a little pavilion
in the High Constable's garden, which, like that of Sir John's own
lodgings, ran down to the Tay.In renewing an intimacy so dangerous,
Rothsay only remembered that he had been Sir Join Ramorny's munificent
friend; while Sir John, on receiving the invitation, only recollected,
on his part, the capricious insults he had sustained from his patron,
the loss of his hand, and the lightness with which he had treated the
subject, and the readiness with which Rothsay had abandoned his cause in
the matter of the bonnet maker's slaughter.He laughed bitterly when he
read the Prince's billet."Eviot," he said, "man a stout boat with six trusty men--trusty men,
mark me--lose not a moment, and bid Dwining instantly come hither."Heaven smiles on us, my trusty friend," he said to the mediciner."I
was but beating my brains how to get access to this fickle boy, and here
he sends to invite me."I see the matter very clearly," said Dwining."Heaven smiles on
some untoward consequences--he!"No matter, the trap is ready; and it is baited, too, my friend, with
what would lure the boy from a sanctuary, though a troop with drawn
weapons waited him in the churchyard.His own weariness of himself would have done the job.Get thy matters
ready--thou goest with us.Write to him, as I cannot, that we come
instantly to attend his commands, and do it clerkly.He reads well, and
that he owes to me.""He will be your valiancie's debtor for more knowledge before he
dies--he!But is your bargain sure with the Duke of Albany?""Enough to gratify my ambition, thy avarice, and the revenge of both.Aboard--aboard, and speedily; let Eviot throw in a few flasks of the
choicest wine, and some cold baked meats.""But your arm, my lord, Sir John?"The throbbing of my heart silences the pain of my wound.It beats as it
would burst my bosom."said Dwining; adding, in a low voice--"It would be a
strange sight if it should.I should like to dissect it, save that its
stony case would spoil my best instruments."In a few minutes they were in the boat, while a speedy messenger carried
the note to the Prince.Rothsay was seated with the Constable, after their noontide repast.He
was sullen and silent; and the earl had just asked whether it was his
pleasure that the table should be cleared, when a note, delivered to the
Prince, changed at once his aspect."I go to the pavilion in the garden--always
with permission of my Lord Constable--to receive my late master of the
horse.""Ay, my lord; must I ask permission twice?""No, surely, my lord," answered the Constable; "but has your Royal
Highness recollected that Sir John Ramorny--"

"Has not the plague, I hope?""Come, Errol,
you would play the surly turnkey, but it is not in your nature; farewell
for half an hour."said Errol, as the Prince, flinging open a lattice of
the ground parlour in which they sat, stept out into the garden--"a new
folly, to call back that villain to his counsels.The Prince, in the mean time, looked back, and said hastily:

"Your lordship's good housekeeping will afford us a flask or two of
wine and a slight collation in the pavilion?I love the al fresco of the
river."The Constable bowed, and gave the necessary orders; so that Sir John
found the materials of good cheer ready displayed, when, landing from
his barge, he entered the pavilion."It grieves my heart to see your Highness under restraint," said
Ramorny, with a well executed appearance of sympathy."That grief of thine will grieve mine," said the Prince."I am sure here
has Errol, and a right true hearted lord he is, so tired me with grave
looks, and something like grave lessons, that he has driven me back to
thee, thou reprobate, from whom, as I expect nothing good, I may perhaps
obtain something entertaining.Yet, ere we say more, it was foul work,
that upon the Fastern's Even, Ramorny.I well hope thou gavest not aim
to it.""On my honour, my lord, a simple mistake of the brute Bonthron.I did
hint to him that a dry beating would be due to the fellow by whom I had
lost a hand; and lo you, my knave makes a double mistake.He takes one
man for another, and instead of the baton he uses the axe.""It is well that it went no farther.Small matter for the bonnet maker;
but I had never forgiven you had the armourer fallen--there is not his
match in Britain.But I hope they hanged the villain high enough?""If thirty feet might serve," replied Ramorny.no more of him," said Rothsay; "his wretched name makes the good
wine taste of blood.And what are the news in Perth, Ramorny?How stands
it with the bona robas and the galliards?""Little galliardise stirring, my lord," answered the knight."All eyes
are turned to the motions of the Black Douglas, who comes with five
thousand chosen men to put us all to rights, as if he were bound for
another Otterburn.It is said he is to be lieutenant again.It is
certain many have declared for his faction.""It is time, then, my feet were free," said Rothsay, "otherwise I may
find a worse warder than Errol."were you once away from this place, you might make as bold
a head as Douglas.""Ramorny," said the Prince, gravely, "I have but a confused remembrance
of your once having proposed something horrible to me.I would be free--I would have my person at my own disposal; but
I will never levy arms against my father, nor those it pleases him to
trust.""It was only for your Royal Highness's personal freedom that I was
presuming to speak," answered Ramorny."Were I in your Grace's place,
I would get me into that good boat which hovers on the Tay, and drop
quietly down to Fife, where you have many friends, and make free to take
possession of Falkland.It is a royal castle; and though the King has
bestowed it in gift on your uncle, yet surely, even if the grant were
not subject to challenge, your Grace might make free with the residence
of so near a relative.""He hath made free with mine," said the Duke, "as the stewartry of
Renfrew can tell.But stay, Ramorny--hold; did I not hear Errol say
that the Lady Marjory Douglas, whom they call Duchess of Rothsay, is
at Falkland?I would neither dwell with that lady nor insult her by
dislodging her.""The lady was there, my lord," replied Ramorny; "I have sure advice that
she is gone to meet her father."or perhaps to beg him to spare
me, providing I come on my knees to her bed, as pilgrims say the emirs
and amirals upon whom a Saracen soldan bestows a daughter in marriage
are bound to do?Ramorny, I will act by the Douglas's own saying, 'It
is better to hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak.'I will keep both
foot and hand from fetters.""No place fitter than Falkland," replied Ramorny."I have enough of good
yeomen to keep the place; and should your Highness wish to leave it, a
brief ride reaches the sea in three directions."Neither mirth, music,
nor maidens--ha!""Pardon me, noble Duke; but, though the Lady Marjory Douglas be
departed, like an errant dame in romance, to implore succour of her
doughty sire, there is, I may say, a lovelier, I am sure a younger,
maiden, either presently at Falkland or who will soon be on the road
thither.Your Highness has not forgotten the Fair Maid of Perth?""Forget the prettiest wench in Scotland!No--any more than thou hast
forgotten the hand that thou hadst in the Curfew Street onslaught on St.Your Highness would say, the hand that I lost.As
certain as I shall never regain it, Catharine Glover is, or will soon
be, at Falkland.I will not flatter your Highness by saying she
expects to meet you; in truth, she proposes to place herself under the
protection of the Lady Marjory.""The little traitress," said the Prince--"she too to turn against me?"I trust your Grace will make her penance a gentle one," replied the
knight."Faith, I would have been her father confessor long ago, but I have ever
found her coy.""Opportunity was lacking, my lord," replied Ramorny; "and time presses
even now.""Nay, I am but too apt for a frolic; but my father--"

"He is personally safe," said Ramorny, "and as much at freedom as ever
he can be; while your Highness--"

"Must brook fetters, conjugal or literal--I know it.Yonder comes
Douglas, with his daughter in his hand, as haughty and as harsh featured
as himself, bating touches of age.""And at Falkland sits in solitude the fairest wench in Scotland," said
Ramorny."Here is penance and restraint, yonder is joy and freedom.""Thou hast prevailed, most sage counsellor," replied Rothsay; "but mark
you, it shall be the last of my frolics.""I trust so," replied Ramorny; "for, when at liberty, you may make a
good accommodation with your royal father.""I will write to him, Ramorny.No, I cannot
put my thoughts in words--do thou write.""Your Royal Highness forgets," said Ramorny, pointing to his mutilated
arm."So please your Highness," answered his counsellor, "if you would use
the hand of the mediciner, Dwining--he writes like a clerk.""Hath he a hint of the circumstances?"Fully," said Ramorny; and, stepping to the window, he called Dwining
from the boat.He entered the presence of the Prince of Scotland, creeping as if he
trode upon eggs, with downcast eyes, and a frame that seemed shrunk up
by a sense of awe produced by the occasion.I will make trial of you; thou
know'st the case--place my conduct to my father in a fair light."Dwining sat down, and in a few minutes wrote a letter, which he handed
to Sir John Ramorny."Why, the devil has aided thee, Dwining," said the knight.'Respected father and liege sovereign--Know that important
considerations induce me to take my departure from this your court,
purposing to make my abode at Falkland, both as the seat of my dearest
uncle Albany, with whom I know your Majesty would desire me to use all
familiarity, and as the residence of one from whom I have been too
long estranged, and with whom I haste to exchange vows of the closest
affection from henceforward.'"The Duke of Rothsay and Ramorny laughed aloud; and the physician,
who had listened to his own scroll as if it were a sentence of death,
encouraged by their applause, raised his eyes, uttered faintly his
chuckling note of "He!and was again grave and silent, as if afraid
he had transgressed the bounds of reverent respect.The old man will apply
all this to the Duchess, as they call her, of Rothsay.Dwining, thou
shouldst be a secretis to his Holiness the Pope, who sometimes, it is
said, wants a scribe that can make one word record two meanings.I will
subscribe it, and have the praise of the device.""And now, my lord," said Ramorny, sealing the letter and leaving it
behind, "will you not to boat?""Not till my chamberlain attends with some clothes and necessaries, and
you may call my sewer also.""My lord," said Ramorny, "time presses, and preparation will but excite
suspicion.Your officers will follow with the mails tomorrow.For
tonight, I trust my poor service may suffice to wait on you at table and
chamber.""Nay, this time it is thou who forgets," said the Prince, touching the
wounded arm with his walking rod."Recollect, man, thou canst neither
carve a capon nor tie a point--a goodly sewer or valet of the mouth!"Ramorny grinned with rage and pain; for his wound, though in a way of
healing, was still highly sensitive, and even the pointing a finger
towards it made him tremble."Will your Highness now be pleased to take boat?""Not till I take leave of the Lord Constable.Rothsay must not slip
away, like a thief from a prison, from the house of Errol."My Lord Duke," said Ramorny, "it may be dangerous to our plan.""To the devil with danger, thy plan, and thyself!I must and will act to
Errol as becomes us both."The earl entered, agreeable to the Prince's summons."I gave you this trouble, my lord," said Rothsay, with the dignified
courtesy which he knew so well how to assume, "to thank you for your
hospitality and your good company.I can enjoy them no longer, as
pressing affairs call me to Falkland.""My lord," said the Lord High Constable, "I trust your Grace remembers
that you are--under ward."If I am a prisoner, speak plainly; if not, I will
take my freedom to depart.""I would, my lord, your Highness would request his Majesty's permission
for this journey."Mean you displeasure against yourself, my lord, or against me?""I have already said your Highness lies in ward here; but if you
determine to break it, I have no warrant--God forbid--to put force on
your inclinations.I can but entreat your Highness, for your own sake--"

"Of my own interest I am the best judge.The wilful Prince stepped into the boat with Dwining and Ramorny, and,
waiting for no other attendance, Eviot pushed off the vessel, which
descended the Tay rapidly by the assistance of sail and oar and of the
ebb tide.For some space the Duke of Rothsay appeared silent and moody, nor did
his companions interrupt his reflections.He raised his head at length
and said: "My father loves a jest, and when all is over he will take
this frolic at no more serious rate than it deserves--a fit of youth,
with which he will deal as he has with others.Yonder, my masters, shows
the old hold of Kinfauns, frowning above the Tay.Now, tell me, John
Ramorny, how thou hast dealt to get the Fair Maid of Perth out of the
hands of yonder bull headed provost; for Errol told me it was rumoured
that she was under his protection.""Truly she was, my lord, with the purpose of being transferred to the
patronage of the Duchess--I mean of the Lady Marjory of Douglas.Now,
this beetle headed provost, who is after all but a piece of blundering
valiancy, has, like most such, a retainer of some slyness and cunning,
whom he uses in all his dealings, and whose suggestions he generally
considers as his own ideas.Whenever I would possess myself of a
landward baron, I address myself to such a confidant, who, in the
present case, is called Kitt Henshaw, an old skipper upon the Tay,
and who, having in his time sailed as far as Campvere, holds with Sir
Patrick Charteris the respect due to one who has seen foreign countries.This his agent I have made my own, and by his means have insinuated
various apologies in order to postpone the departure of Catharine for
Falkland.""I know not if it is wise to tell your Highness, lest you should
disapprove of my views.I meant the officers of the Commission for
inquiry into heretical opinions should have found the Fair Maid at
Kinfauns, for our beauty is a peevish, self willed swerver from the
church; and certes, I designed that the knight should have come in
for his share of the fines and confiscations that were about to be
inflicted.The monks were eager enough to be at him, seeing he hath had
frequent disputes with them about the salmon tithe.""But wherefore wouldst thou have ruined the knight's fortunes, and
brought the beautiful young woman to the stake, perchance?"An old woman
might have been in some danger; and as for my Lord Provost, as they call
him, if they had clipped off some of his fat acres, it would have
been some atonement for the needless brave he put on me in St."Methinks, John, it was but a base revenge," said Rothsay.He that cannot right himself by the hand
must use his head.Well, that chance was over by the tender hearted
Douglas's declaring in favour of tender conscience; and then, my lord,
old Henshaw found no further objections to carrying the Fair Maid
of Perth to Falkland, not to share the dulness of the Lady Marjory's
society, as Sir Patrick Charteris and she herself doth opine, but to
keep your Highness from tiring when we return from hunting in the park."There was again a long pause, in which the Prince seemed to muse deeply."Ramorny, I have a scruple in this matter; but if I
name it to thee, the devil of sophistry, with which thou art possessed,
will argue it out of me, as it has done many others.This girl is the
most beautiful, one excepted, whom I ever saw or knew; and I like her
the more that she bears some features of--Elizabeth of Dunbar.But she,
I mean Catharine Glover, is contracted, and presently to be wedded, to
Henry the armourer, a craftsman unequalled for skill, and a man at arms
yet unmatched in the barrace.To follow out this intrigue would do a
good fellow too much wrong.""Your Highness will not expect me to be very solicitous of Henry Smith's
interest," said Ramorny, looking at his wounded arm.Andrew with his shored cross, this disaster of thine is too much
harped upon, John Ramorny!Others are content with putting a finger
into every man's pie, but thou must thrust in thy whole gory hand.It is
done, and cannot be undone; let it be forgotten.""Nay, my lord, you allude to it more frequently than I," answered the
knight--"in derision, it is true; while I--but I can be silent on the
subject if I cannot forget it.""Well, then, I tell thee that I have scruple about this intrigue.Dost
thou remember, when we went in a frolic to hear Father Clement preach,
or rather to see this fair heretic, that he spoke as touchingly as a
minstrel about the rich man taking away the poor man's only ewe lamb?""A great matter, indeed," answered Sir John, "that this churl's wife's
eldest son should be fathered by the Prince of Scotland!How many earls
would covet the like fate for their fair countesses?and how many that
have had such good luck sleep not a grain the worse for it?""And if I might presume to speak," said the mediciner, "the ancient
laws of Scotland assigned such a privilege to every feudal lord over his
female vassals, though lack of spirit and love of money hath made many
exchange it for gold.""I require no argument to urge me to be kind to a pretty woman; but this
Catharine has been ever cold to me," said the Prince."Nay, my lord," said Ramorny, "if, young, handsome, and a prince, you
know not how to make yourself acceptable to a fine woman, it is not for
me to say more.""And if it were not far too great audacity in me to speak again, I would
say," quoth the leech, "that all Perth knows that the Gow Chrom never
was the maiden's choice, but fairly forced upon her by her father.I
know for certain that she refused him repeatedly.""Nay, if thou canst assure us of that, the case is much altered," said
Rothsay."Vulcan was a smith as well as Harry Wynd; he would needs wed
Venus, and our chronicles tell us what came of it.""Then long may Lady Venus live and be worshipped," said Sir John
Ramorny, "and success to the gallant knight Mars who goes a-wooing to
her goddess-ship!"The discourse took a gay and idle turn for a few minutes; but the Duke
of Rothsay soon dropped it."I have left," he said, "yonder air of the
prison house behind me, and yet my spirits scarce revive.I feel that
drowsy, not unpleasing, yet melancholy mood that comes over us when
exhausted by exercise or satiated with pleasure.Some music now,
stealing on the ear, yet not loud enough to make us lift the eye, were a
treat for the gods.""Your Grace has but to speak your wishes, and the nymphs of the Tay are
as favourable as the fair ones upon the shore.said the Duke of Rothsay, listening; "it is, and rarely
touched.Steer towards the boat from
whence the music comes.""It is old Henshaw," said Ramorny, "working up the stream.The boatman answered the hail, and drew up alongside of the Prince's
barge.said the Prince, recognising the figure as well
as the appointments of the French glee woman, Louise."I think I owe
thee something for being the means of thy having a fright, at least,
upon St.Into this boat with thee, lute, puppy dog,
scrip and all; I will prefer thee to a lady's service who shall feed thy
very cur on capons and canary.""I trust your Highness will consider--" said Ramorny."I will consider nothing but my pleasure, John.Pray, do thou be so
complying as to consider it also.""Is it indeed to a lady's service you would promote me?""Oh, I have heard of that great lady!"said Louise; "and will you indeed
prefer me to your right royal consort's service?""I will, by my honour--whenever I receive her as such.Mark that
reservation, John," said he aside to Ramorny.The persons who were in the boat caught up the tidings, and, concluding
a reconciliation was about to take place betwixt the royal couple,
exhorted Louise to profit by her good fortune, and add herself to the
Duchess of Rothsay's train.Several offered her some acknowledgment for
the exercise of her talents.During this moment of delay, Ramorny whispered to Dwining: "Make in,
knave, with some objection.Rouse thy
wits, while I speak a word with Henshaw.""If I might presume to speak," said Dwining, "as one who have made
my studies both in Spain and Arabia, I would say, my lord, that the
sickness has appeared in Edinburgh, and that there may be risk in
admitting this young wanderer into your Highness's vicinity."and what is it to thee," said Rothsay, "whether I choose to be
poisoned by the pestilence or the 'pothecary?Must thou, too, needs
thwart my humour?"While the Prince thus silenced the remonstrances of Dwining, Sir John
Ramorny had snatched a moment to learn from Henshaw that the removal of
the Duchess of Rothsay from Falkland was still kept profoundly secret,
and that Catharine Glover would arrive there that evening or the
next morning, in expectation of being taken under the noble lady's
protection.The Duke of Rothsay, deeply plunged in thought, received this intimation
so coldly, that Ramorny took the liberty of remonstrating."This, my
lord," he said, "is playing the spoiled child of fortune.You wish for
liberty; it comes.You wish for beauty; it awaits you, with just so much
delay as to render the boon more precious.Even your slightest desires
seem a law to the Fates; for you desire music when it seems most
distant, and the lute and song are at your hand.These things, so sent,
should be enjoyed, else we are but like petted children, who break and
throw from them the toys they have wept themselves sick for.""To enjoy pleasure, Ramorny," said the Prince, "a man should have
suffered pain, as it requires fasting to gain a good appetite.We, who
can have all for a wish, little enjoy that all when we have possessed
it.Seest thou yonder thick cloud, which is about to burst to rain?It
seems to stifle me--the waters look dark and lurid--the shores have lost
their beautiful form--"

"My lord, forgive your servant," said Ramorny."You indulge a powerful
imagination, as an unskilful horseman permits a fiery steed to rear
until he falls back on his master and crushes him.I pray you shake off
this lethargy.Shall the glee maiden make some music?""Let her; but it must be melancholy: all mirth would at this moment jar
on my ear."The maiden sung a melancholy dirge in Norman French; the words, of which
the following is an imitation, were united to a tune as doleful as they
are themselves:

     Yes, thou mayst sigh,
     And look once more at all around,
     At stream and bank, and sky and ground.Thy life its final course has found,
     And thou must die.Yes, lay thee down,
     And while thy struggling pulses flutter,
     Bid the grey monk his soul mass mutter,
     And the deep bell its death tone utter--
     Thy life is gone.'Tis but a pang, and then a thrill,
     A fever fit, and then a chill,
     And then an end of human ill,
     For thou art dead.The Prince made no observation on the music; and the maiden, at
Ramorny's beck, went on from time to time with her minstrel craft, until
the evening sunk down into rain, first soft and gentle, at length in
great quantities, and accompanied by a cold wind.There was neither
cloak nor covering for the Prince, and he sullenly rejected that which
Ramorny offered."It is not for Rothsay to wear your cast garments, Sir John; this melted
snow, which I feel pierce me to the very marrow, I am now encountering
by your fault.Why did you presume to put off the boat without my
servants and apparel?"Ramorny did not attempt an exculpation; for he knew the Prince was in
one of those humours, when to enlarge upon a grievance was more pleasing
to him than to have his mouth stopped by any reasonable apology.In
sullen silence, or amid unsuppressed chiding, the boat arrived at the
fishing village of Newburgh.The party landed, and found horses in
readiness, which, indeed, Ramorny had long since provided for the
occasion.Their quality underwent the Prince's bitter sarcasm, expressed
to Ramorny sometimes by direct words, oftener by bitter gibes.At length
they were mounted and rode on through the closing night and the falling
rain, the Prince leading the way with reckless haste.The glee maiden,
mounted by his express order, attended them and well for her that,
accustomed to severe weather, and exercise both on foot and horseback,
she supported as firmly as the men the fatigues of the nocturnal ride.Ramorny was compelled to keep at the Prince's rein, being under no small
anxiety lest, in his wayward fit, he might ride off from him entirely,
and, taking refuge in the house of some loyal baron, escape the snare
which was spread for him.He therefore suffered inexpressibly during the
ride, both in mind and in body.At length the forest of Falkland received them, and a glimpse of the
moon showed the dark and huge tower, an appendage of royalty itself,
though granted for a season to the Duke of Albany.On a signal given the
drawbridge fell.Torches glared in the courtyard, menials attended,
and the Prince, assisted from horseback, was ushered into an apartment,
where Ramorny waited on him, together with Dwining, and entreated him
to take the leech's advice.The Duke of Rothsay repulsed the proposal,
haughtily ordered his bed to be prepared, and having stood for some time
shivering in his dank garments beside a large blazing fire, he retired
to his apartment without taking leave of anyone."You see the peevish humour of this childish boy, now," said Ramorny to
Dwining; "can you wonder that a servant who has done so much for him as
I have should be tired of such a master?""No, truly," said Dwining, "that and the promised earldom of Lindores
would shake any man's fidelity.But shall we commence with him this
evening?He has, if eye and cheek speak true, the foundation of a fever
within him, which will make our work easy while it will seem the effect
of nature.""It is an opportunity lost," said Ramorny; "but we must delay our blow
till he has seen this beauty, Catharine Glover.She may be hereafter a
witness that she saw him in good health, and master of his own motions,
a brief space before--you understand me?"Dwining nodded assent, and added:

"There is no time lost; for there is little difficulty in blighting a
flower exhausted from having been made to bloom too soon."in sooth he was a shameless wight,
     Sore given to revel and ungodly glee:
     Few earthly things found favour in his sight,
     Save concubines and carnal companie,
     And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.With the next morning the humour of the Duke of Rothsay was changed.He complained, indeed, of pain and fever, but they rather seemed to
stimulate than to overwhelm him.He was familiar with Ramorny, and
though he said nothing on the subject of the preceding night, it was
plain he remembered what he desired to obliterate from the memory of his
followers--the ill humour he had then displayed.He was civil to every
one, and jested with Ramorny on the subject of Catharine's arrival."How surprised will the pretty prude be at seeing herself in a family
of men, when she expects to be admitted amongst the hoods and pinners
of Dame Marjory's waiting women!Thou hast not many of the tender sex in
thy household, I take it, Ramorny?""Faith, none except the minstrel wench, but a household drudge or two
whom we may not dispense with.By the way, she is anxiously inquiring
after the mistress your Highness promised to prefer her to.Shall I
dismiss her, to hunt for her new mistress at leisure?""By no means, she will serve to amuse Catharine.And, hark you, were it
not well to receive that coy jillet with something of a mumming?"We will not disappoint her, since she expects
to find the Duchess of Rothsay: I will be Duke and Duchess in my own
person.""No one so dull as a wit," said the Prince, "when he does not hit off
the scent at once.My Duchess, as they call her, has been in as great a
hurry to run away from Falkland as I to come hither.There is as much female trumpery in the wardrobe
adjoining to my sleeping room as would equip a whole carnival.Look you,
I will play Dame Marjory, disposed on this day bed here with a mourning
veil and a wreath of willow, to show my forsaken plight; thou, John,
wilt look starch and stiff enough for her Galwegian maid of honour,
the Countess Hermigild; and Dwining shall present the old Hecate, her
nurse--only she hath more beard on her upper lip than Dwining on his
whole face, and skull to boot.He should have the commodity of a beard
to set her forth conformably.Get thy kitchen drudges, and what passable
pages thou hast with thee, to make my women of the bedroom.Ramorny hasted into the anteroom, and told Dwining the Prince's device."Do thou look to humour the fool," he said; "I care not how little I see
him, knowing what is to be done.""Trust all to me," said the physician, shrugging his shoulders."What
sort of a butcher is he that can cut the lamb's throat, yet is afraid to
hear it bleat?""Tush, fear not my constancy: I cannot forget that he would have cast
me into the cloister with as little regard as if he threw away the
truncheon of a broken lance.Begone--yet stay; ere you go to arrange
this silly pageant, something must be settled to impose on the thick
witted Charteris.He is like enough, should he be left in the belief
that the Duchess of Rothsay is still here, and Catharine Glover in
attendance on her, to come down with offers of service, and the like,
when, as I need scarce tell thee, his presence would be inconvenient.Indeed, this is the more likely, that some folks have given a warmer
name to the iron headed knight's great and tender patronage of this
damsel.""With that hint, let me alone to deal with him.I will send him such a
letter, that for this month he shall hold himself as ready for a journey
to hell as to Falkland.Can you tell me the name of the Duchess's
confessor?""Waltheof, a grey friar."In a few minutes, for he was a clerk of rare celerity, Dwining finished
a letter, which he placed in Ramorny's hand."This is admirable, and would have made thy fortune with Rothsay.I
think I should have been too jealous to trust thee in his household,
save that his day is closed.""Read it aloud," said Dwining, "that we may judge if it goes trippingly
off."And Ramorny read as follows: "By command of our high and mighty Princess
Marjory, Duchess of Rothsay, and so forth, we Waltheof, unworthy brother
of the order of St.Francis, do thee, Sir Patrick Charteris, knight of
Kinfauns, to know, that her Highness marvels much at the temerity with
which you have sent to her presence a woman of whose fame she can judge
but lightly, seeing she hath made her abode, without any necessity,
for more than a week in thine own castle, without company of any other
female, saving menials; of which foul cohabitation the savour is gone
up through Fife, Angus, and Perthshire.Nevertheless, her Highness,
considering the ease as one of human frailty, hath not caused this
wanton one to be scourged with nettles, or otherwise to dree penance;
but, as two good brethren of the convent of Lindores, the Fathers
Thickskull and Dundermore, have been summoned up to the Highlands upon
an especial call, her Highness hath committed to their care this maiden
Catharine, with charge to convey her to her father, whom she states
to be residing beside Loch Tay, under whose protection she will find
a situation more fitting her qualities and habits than the Castle of
Falkland, while her Highness the Duchess of Rothsay abides there.She
hath charged the said reverend brothers so to deal with the young woman
as may give her a sense of the sin of incontinence, and she commendeth
thee to confession and penitence.--Signed, Waltheof, by command of an
high and mighty Princess"; and so forth.When he had finished, "Excellent--excellent!""This
unexpected rebuff will drive Charteris mad!He hath been long making
a sort of homage to this lady, and to find himself suspected of
incontinence, when he was expecting the full credit of a charitable
action, will altogether confound him; and, as thou say'st, it will be
long enough ere he come hither to look after the damsel or do honour
to the dame.But away to thy pageant, while I prepare that which shall
close the pageant for ever."It was an hour before noon, when Catharine, escorted by old Henshaw and
a groom of the Knight of Kinfauns, arrived before the lordly tower of
Falkland.The broad banner which was displayed from it bore the arms
of Rothsay, the servants who appeared wore the colours of the Prince's
household, all confirming the general belief that the Duchess still
resided there.Catharine's heart throbbed, for she had heard that
the Duchess had the pride as well as the high courage of the house
of Douglas, and felt uncertain touching the reception she was to
experience.On entering the castle, she observed that the train was
smaller than she had expected, but, as the Duchess lived in close
retirement, she was little surprised at this.In a species of anteroom
she was met by a little old woman, who seemed bent double with age, and
supported herself upon an ebony staff."Truly thou art welcome, fair daughter," said she, saluting Catharine,
"and, as I may say, to an afflicted house; and I trust (once more
saluting her) thou wilt be a consolation to my precious and right royal
daughter the Duchess.Sit thee down, my child, till I see whether my
lady be at leisure to receive thee.Ah, my child, thou art very lovely
indeed, if Our Lady hath given to thee a soul to match with so fair a
body."With that the counterfeit old woman crept into the next apartment,
where she found Rothsay in the masquerading habit he had prepared, and
Ramorny, who had evaded taking part in the pageant, in his ordinary
attire."Thou art a precious rascal, sir doctor," said the Prince; "by my
honour, I think thou couldst find in thy heart to play out the whole
play thyself, lover's part and all.""If it were to save your Highness trouble," said the leech, with his
usual subdued laugh."No--no," said Rothsay, "I never need thy help, man; and tell me now,
how look I, thus disposed on the couch--languishing and ladylike, ha?""Something too fine complexioned and soft featured for the Lady Marjory
of Douglas, if I may presume to say so," said the leech."Away, villain, and marshal in this fair frost piece--fear not she will
complain of my effeminacy; and thou, Ramorny, away also."As the knight left the apartment by one door, the fictitious old woman
ushered in Catharine Glover by another.The room had been carefully
darkened to twilight, so that Catharine saw the apparently female figure
stretched on the couch without the least suspicion.asked Rothsay, in a voice naturally sweet, and now
carefully modulated to a whispering tone."Let her approach, Griselda,
and kiss our hand."The supposed nurse led the trembling maiden forward to the side of the
couch, and signed to her to kneel.Catharine did so, and kissed with
much devotion and simplicity the gloved hand which the counterfeit
duchess extended to her."Be not afraid," said the same musical voice; "in me you only see a
melancholy example of the vanity of human greatness; happy those, my
child, whose rank places them beneath the storms of state."While he spoke, he put his arms around her neck and drew her towards
him, as if to salute her in token of welcome.But the kiss was bestowed
with an earnestness which so much overacted the part of the fair
patroness, that Catharine, concluding the Duchess had lost her senses,
screamed aloud.Catharine looked around her; the nurse was gone, and the Duke tearing
off his veil, she saw herself in the power of a daring young libertine.she said; "and Thou wilt, if I forsake
not myself."As this resolution darted through her mind, she repressed her
disposition to scream, and, as far as she might, strove to conceal her
fear."The jest hath been played," she said, with as much firmness as she
could assume; "may I entreat that your Highness will now unhand me?"for
he still kept hold of her arm."Nay, my pretty captive, struggle not--why should you fear?"As you are pleased to detain me, I will
not, by striving, provoke you to use me ill, and give pain to yourself,
when you have time to think.""Why, thou traitress, thou hast held me captive for months," said the
Prince, "and wilt thou not let me hold thee for a moment?""This were gallantry, my lord, were it in the streets of Perth, where I
might listen or escape as I listed; it is tyranny here.""And if I did let thee go, whither wouldst thou fly?""The bridges are up, the portcullis down, and the men who follow me are
strangely deaf to a peevish maiden's squalls.Be kind, therefore, and
you shall know what it is to oblige a prince.""Unloose me, then, my lord, and hear me appeal from thyself to thyself,
from Rothsay to the Prince of Scotland.I am the daughter of an humble
but honest citizen.I am, I may well nigh say, the spouse of a brave and
honest man.If I have given your Highness any encouragement for what you
have done, it has been unintentional.Thus forewarned, I entreat you to
forego your power over me, and suffer me to depart.Your Highness can
obtain nothing from me, save by means equally unworthy of knighthood or
manhood.""You are bold, Catharine," said the Prince, "but neither as a knight
nor a man can I avoid accepting a defiance.I must teach you the risk of
such challenges."While he spoke, he attempted to throw his arms again around her; but she
eluded his grasp, and proceeded in the same tone of firm decision."My strength, my lord, is as great to defend myself in an honourable
strife as yours can be to assail me with a most dishonourable purpose.Do not shame yourself and me by putting it to the combat.You may stun
me with blows, or you may call aid to overpower me; but otherwise you
will fail of your purpose.""The force I would
use is no more than excuses women in yielding to their own weakness.""Then keep it," said Catharine, "for those women who desire such an
excuse.My resistance is that of the most determined mind which love
of honour and fear of shame ever inspired.my lord, could you
succeed, you would but break every bond between me and life, between
yourself and honour.I have been trained fraudulently here, by what
decoys I know not; but were I to go dishonoured hence, it would be to
denounce the destroyer of my happiness to every quarter of Europe.I would take the palmer's staff in my hand, and wherever chivalry is
honoured, or the word Scotland has been heard, I would proclaim the heir
of a hundred kings, the son of the godly Robert Stuart, the heir of
the heroic Bruce, a truthless, faithless man, unworthy of the crown he
expects and of the spurs he wears.Every lady in wide Europe would hold
your name too foul for her lips; every worthy knight would hold you
a baffled, forsworn caitiff, false to the first vow of arms, the
protection of woman and the defence of the feeble."Rothsay resumed his seat, and looked at her with a countenance in which
resentment was mingled with admiration."You forget to whom you speak,
maiden.Know, the distinction I have offered you is one for which
hundreds whose trains you are born to bear would feel gratitude.""Once more, my lord," resumed Catharine, "keep these favours for those
by whom they are prized; or rather reserve your time and your health
for other and nobler pursuits--for the defence of your country and
the happiness of your subjects.Alas, my lord, how willingly would an
exulting people receive you for their chief!How gladly would they close
around you, did you show desire to head them against the oppression of
the mighty, the violence of the lawless, the seduction of the vicious,
and the tyranny of the hypocrite!"The Duke of Rothsay, whose virtuous feelings were as easily excited
as they were evanescent, was affected by the enthusiasm with which she
spoke."Forgive me if I have alarmed you, maiden," he said "thou art
too noble minded to be the toy of passing pleasure, for which my mistake
destined thee; and I, even were thy birth worthy of thy noble spirit and
transcendent beauty, have no heart to give thee; for by the homage of
the heart only should such as thou be wooed.But my hopes have been
blighted, Catharine: the only woman I ever loved has been torn from me
in the very wantonness of policy, and a wife imposed on me whom I must
ever detest, even had she the loveliness and softness which alone can
render a woman amiable in my eyes.My health is fading even in early
youth; and all that is left for me is to snatch such flowers as the
short passage from life to the grave will now present.Look at my hectic
cheek; feel, if you will, my intermitting pulse; and pity me and excuse
me if I, whose rights as a prince and as a man have been trampled upon
and usurped, feel occasional indifference towards the rights of others,
and indulge a selfish desire to gratify the wish of the passing moment."exclaimed Catharine, with the enthusiasm which belonged
to her character--"I will call you my dear lord, for dear must the heir
of Bruce be to every child of Scotland--let me not, I pray, hear you
speak thus!Your glorious ancestor endured exile, persecution, the night
of famine, and the day of unequal combat, to free his country; do you
practise the like self denial to free yourself.Tear yourself from those
who find their own way to greatness smoothed by feeding your follies.You know it not, I am sure--you could not
know; but the wretch who could urge the daughter to courses of shame by
threatening the life of the aged father is capable of all that is vile,
all that is treacherous!""He did indeed, my lord, and he dares not deny it.""It shall be looked to," answered the Duke of Rothsay."I have ceased
to love him; but he has suffered much for my sake, and I must see his
services honourably requited."Oh, my lord, if chronicles speak true, such services
brought Troy to ruins and gave the infidels possession of Spain.""Hush, maiden--speak within compass, I pray you," said the Prince,
rising up; "our conference ends here.""Yet one word, my Lord Duke of Rothsay," said Catharine, with animation,
while her beautiful countenance resembled that of an admonitory angel."I cannot tell what impels me to speak thus boldly; but the fire burns
within me, and will break out.Leave this castle without an hour's
delay; the air is unwholesome for you.Dismiss this Ramorny before the
day is ten minutes older; his company is most dangerous.""None in especial," answered Catharine, abashed at her own
eagerness--"none, perhaps, excepting my fears for your safety.""To vague fears the heir of Bruce must not listen.Ramorny entered, and bowed low to the Duke and to the maiden, whom,
perhaps, he considered as likely to be preferred to the post of
favourite sultana, and therefore entitled to a courteous obeisance."Ramorny," said the Prince, "is there in the household any female of
reputation who is fit to wait on this young woman till we can send her
where she may desire to go?""I fear," replied Ramorny, "if it displease not your Highness to hear
the truth, your household is indifferently provided in that way; and
that, to speak the very verity, the glee maiden is the most decorous
amongst us.""Let her wait upon this young person, then, since better may not be.And
take patience, maiden, for a few hours.""So, my lord, part you so soon from the Fair Maid of Perth?This is,
indeed, the very wantonness of victory.""There is neither victory nor defeat in the case," returned the Prince,
drily."The girl loves me not; nor do I love her well enough to torment
myself concerning her scruples.""The chaste Malcolm the Maiden revived in one of his descendants!""Favour me, sir, by a truce to your wit, or by choosing a different
subject for its career.It is noon, I believe, and you will oblige me by
commanding them to serve up dinner."Ramorny left the room; but Rothsay thought he discovered a smile upon
his countenance, and to be the subject of this man's satire gave him no
ordinary degree of pain.He summoned, however, the knight to his table,
and even admitted Dwining to the same honour.The conversation was of
a lively and dissolute cast, a tone encouraged by the Prince, as if
designing to counterbalance the gravity of his morals in the morning,
which Ramorny, who was read in old chronicles, had the boldness to liken
to the continence of Scipio.The banquet, nothwithstanding the Duke's indifferent health, was
protracted in idle wantonness far beyond the rules of temperance; and,
whether owing simply to the strength of the wine which he drank, or the
weakness of his constitution, or, as it is probable, because the last
wine which he quaffed had been adulterated by Dwining, it so happened
that the Prince, towards the end of the repast, fell into a lethargic
sleep, from which it seemed impossible to rouse him.Sir John Ramorny
and Dwining carried him to his chamber, accepting no other assistance
than that of another person, whom we will afterwards give name to.Next morning, it was announced that the Prince was taken ill of
an infectious disorder; and, to prevent its spreading through the
household, no one was admitted to wait on him save his late master of
horse, the physician Dwining, and the domestic already mentioned; one of
whom seemed always to remain in the apartment, while the others observed
a degree of precaution respecting their intercourse with the rest of the
family, so strict as to maintain the belief that he was dangerously ill
of an infectious disorder.In winter's tedious nights, sit by the fire,
     With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales
     Of woeful ages, long ago betid:
     And, ere thou bid goodnight, to quit their grief,
     Tell thou the lamentable fall of me.King Richard II Act V. Scene I.


Far different had been the fate of the misguided heir of Scotland from
that which was publicly given out in the town of Falkland.His ambitious
uncle had determined on his death, as the means of removing the first
and most formidable barrier betwixt his own family and the throne.James, the younger son of the King, was a mere boy, who might at more
leisure be easily set aside.Ramorny's views of aggrandisement, and the
resentment which he had latterly entertained against his masters made
him a willing agent in young Rothsay's destruction.Dwining's love of
gold, and his native malignity of disposition, rendered him equally
forward.It had been resolved, with the most calculating cruelty,
that all means which might leave behind marks of violence were to be
carefully avoided, and the extinction of life suffered to take place
of itself by privation of every kind acting upon a frail and impaired
constitution.The Prince of Scotland was not to be murdered, as Ramorny
had expressed himself on another occasion, he was only to cease to
exist.Rothsay's bedchamber in the Tower of Falkland was well adapted
for the execution of such a horrible project.A small, narrow staircase,
scarce known to exist, opened from thence by a trapdoor to the
subterranean dungeons of the castle, through a passage by which
the feudal lord was wont to visit, in private and in disguise, the
inhabitants of those miserable regions.By this staircase the villains
conveyed the insensible Prince to the lowest dungeon of the castle,
so deep in the bowels of the earth, that no cries or groans, it was
supposed, could possibly be heard, while the strength of its door and
fastenings must for a long time have defied force, even if the entrance
could have been discovered.Bonthron, who had been saved from the
gallows for the purpose, was the willing agent of Ramorny's unparalleled
cruelty to his misled and betrayed patron.This wretch revisited the dungeon at the time when the Prince's lethargy
began to wear off, and when, awaking to sensation, he felt himself
deadly cold, unable to move, and oppressed with fetters, which scarce
permitted him to stir from the dank straw on which he was laid.His
first idea was that he was in a fearful dream, his next brought a
confused augury of the truth.He called, shouted, yelled at length in
frenzy but no assistance came, and he was only answered by the vaulted
roof of the dungeon.The agent of hell heard these agonizing screams,
and deliberately reckoned them against the taunts and reproaches with
which Rothsay had expressed his instinctive aversion to him.When,
exhausted and hopeless, the unhappy youth remained silent, the savage
resolved to present himself before the eyes of his prisoner.The locks
were drawn, the chain fell; the Prince raised himself as high as his
fetters permitted; a red glare, against which he was fain to shut his
eyes, streamed through the vault; and when he opened them again, it was
on the ghastly form of one whom he had reason to think dead."I am judged and condemned," he exclaimed, "and the most abhorred fiend
in the infernal regions is sent to torment me!""I live, my lord," said Bonthron; "and that you may live and enjoy life,
be pleased to sit up and eat your victuals.""Free me from these irons," said the Prince, "release me from this
dungeon, and, dog as thou art, thou shalt be the richest man in
Scotland.""If you would give me the weight of your shackles in gold," said
Bonthron, "I would rather see the iron on you than have the treasure
myself!But look up; you were wont to love delicate fare--behold how I
have catered for you."The wretch, with fiendish glee, unfolded a piece of rawhide covering the
bundle which he bore under' his arm, and, passing the light to and fro
before it, showed the unhappy Prince a bull's head recently hewn from
the trunk, and known in Scotland as the certain signal of death.He
placed it at the foot of the bed, or rather lair, on which the Prince
lay."Be moderate in your food," he said; "it is like to be long ere thou
getst another meal.""Tell me but one thing, wretch," said the Prince."Does Ramorny know of
this practice?""How else hadst thou been decoyed hither?Poor woodcock, thou art
snared!"With these words, the door shut, the bolts resounded, and the unhappy
Prince was left to darkness, solitude, and misery."Oh, my father!--my
prophetic father!The staff I leaned on has indeed proved a spear!"We will not dwell on the subsequent hours, nay, days, of bodily agony
and mental despair.But it was not the pleasure of Heaven that so great a crime should be
perpetrated with impunity.Catharine Glover and the glee woman, neglected by the other inmates,
who seemed to be engaged with the tidings of the Prince's illness, were,
however, refused permission to leave the castle until it should be seen
how this alarming disease was to terminate, and whether it was actually
an infectious sickness.Forced on each other's society, the two desolate
women became companions, if not friends; and the union drew somewhat
closer when Catharine discovered that this was the same female minstrel
on whose account Henry Wynd had fallen under her displeasure.She now
heard his complete vindication, and listened with ardour to the praises
which Louise heaped on her gallant protector.On the other hand, the
minstrel, who felt the superiority of Catharine's station and character,
willingly dwelt upon a theme which seemed to please her, and recorded
her gratitude to the stout smith in the little song of "Bold and True,"
which was long a favourite in Scotland.Oh, bold and true,
     In bonnet blue,
     That fear or falsehood never knew,
     Whose heart was loyal to his word,
     Whose hand was faithful to his sword--
     Seek Europe wide from sea to sea,
     But bonny blue cap still for me!I've seen Almain's proud champions prance,
     Have seen the gallant knights of France,
     Unrivall'd with the sword and lance,
     Have seen the sons of England true,
     Wield the brown bill and bend the yew.Search France the fair, and England free,
     But bonny blue cap still for me!In short, though Louise's disreputable occupation would have been in
other circumstances an objection to Catharine's voluntarily frequenting
her company, yet, forced together as they now were, she found her a
humble and accommodating companion.They lived in this manner for four or five days, and, in order to avoid
as much as possible the gaze, and perhaps the incivility, of the menials
in the offices, they prepared their food in their own apartment.In the
absolutely necessary intercourse with domestics, Louise, more accustomed
to expedients, bolder by habit, and desirous to please Catharine,
willingly took on herself the trouble of getting from the pantler the
materials of their slender meal, and of arranging it with the dexterity
of her country.The glee woman had been abroad for this purpose upon the sixth day, a
little before noon; and the desire of fresh air, or the hope to find
some sallad or pot herbs, or at least an early flower or two, with which
to deck their board, had carried her into the small garden appertaining
to the castle.She re-entered her apartment in the tower with a
countenance pale as ashes, and a frame which trembled like an aspen
leaf.Her terror instantly extended itself to Catharine, who could
hardly find words to ask what new misfortune had occurred.said Louise, speaking under her breath, and huddling
her words so thick upon each other that Catharine could hardly catch
the sense."I was seeking for flowers to dress your pottage, because
you said you loved them yesterday; my poor little dog, thrusting himself
into a thicket of yew and holly bushes that grow out of some old ruins
close to the castle wall, came back whining and howling.I crept forward
to see what might be the cause--and, oh!I heard a groaning as of one
in extreme pain, but so faint, that it seemed to arise out of the very
depth of the earth.At length, I found it proceeded from a small rent in
the wall, covered with ivy; and when I laid my ear close to the opening,
I could hear the Prince's voice distinctly say, 'It cannot now last
long'--and then it sunk away in something like a prayer.""I said, 'Is it you, my lord?'and the answer was, 'Who mocks me with
that title?'I asked him if I could help him, and he answered with a
voice I shall never forget, 'Food--food!So I came
hither to tell you.that were more likely to destroy than to aid," said Catharine."I know not yet," said Catharine, prompt and bold on occasions of
moment, though yielding to her companion in ingenuity of resource on
ordinary occasions: "I know not yet, but something we will do: the blood
of Bruce shall not die unaided."So saying, she seized the small cruise which contained their soup, and
the meat of which it was made, wrapped some thin cakes which she had
baked into the fold of her plaid, and, beckoning her companion to follow
with a vessel of milk, also part of their provisions, she hastened
towards the garden."So, our fair vestal is stirring abroad?"said the only man she met, who
was one of the menials; but Catharine passed on without notice or reply,
and gained the little garden without farther interruption.Louise indicated to her a heap of ruins, which, covered with underwood,
was close to the castle wall.It had probably been originally a
projection from the building; and the small fissure, which communicated
with the dungeon, contrived for air, had terminated within it.But the
aperture had been a little enlarged by decay, and admitted a dim ray of
light to its recesses, although it could not be observed by those who
visited the place with torchlight aids."Here is dead silence," said Catharine, after she had listened
attentively for a moment."Heaven and earth, he is gone!""We must risk something," said her companion, and ran her fingers over
the strings of her guitar.A sigh was the only answer from the depth of the dungeon."I am here, my lord--I am here, with food and drink."The jest comes too late; I am dying," was the answer."His brain is turned, and no wonder," thought Catharine; "but whilst
there is life, there may be hope.""It is I, my lord, Catharine Glover.I have food, if I could pass it
safely to you."I thought the pain was over, but it glows
again within me at the name of food.""The food is here, but how--ah, how can I pass it to you?the chink
is so narrow, the wall is so thick!Yet there is a remedy--I have it.Quick, Louise; cut me a willow bough, the tallest you can find."The glee maiden obeyed, and, by means of a cleft in the top of the
wand, Catharine transmitted several morsels of the soft cakes, soaked in
broth, which served at once for food and for drink.The unfortunate young man ate little, and with difficulty, but prayed
for a thousand blessings on the head of his comforter."I had destined
thee to be the slave of my vices," he said, "and yet thou triest to
become the preserver of my life!"I will return with food as I shall see opportunity," said Catharine,
just as the glee maiden plucked her sleeve and desired her to be silent
and stand close.Both crouched among the ruins, and they heard the voices of Ramorny and
the mediciner in close conversation."He is stronger than I thought," said the former, in a low, croaking
tone."How long held out Dalwolsy, when the knight of Liddesdale
prisoned him in his castle of Hermitage?""For a fortnight," answered Dwining; "but he was a strong man, and had
some assistance by grain which fell from a granary above his prison
house.""Were it not better end the matter more speedily?He will demand to see the
Prince, and all must be over ere he comes."They passed on in their dark and fatal conversation."Now gain we the tower," said Catharine to her companion, when she saw
they had left the garden."I had a plan of escape for myself; I will
turn it into one of rescue for the Prince.The dey woman enters the
castle about vesper time, and usually leaves her cloak in the passage as
she goes into the pantlers' office with the milk.Take thou the cloak,
muffle thyself close, and pass the warder boldly; he is usually drunken
at that hour, and thou wilt go as the dey woman unchallenged through
gate and along bridge, if thou bear thyself with confidence.Then away
to meet the Black Douglas; he is our nearest and only aid.""But," said Louise, "is he not that terrible lord who threatened me with
shame and punishment?""Believe it," said Catharine, "such as thou or I never dwelt an hour in
the Douglas's memory, either for good or evil.Tell him that his son in
law, the Prince of Scotland dies--treacherously famished--in Falkland
Castle, and thou wilt merit not pardon only, but reward.""I care not for reward," said Louise; "the deed will reward itself.But
methinks to stay is more dangerous than to go.Let me stay, then, and
nourish the unhappy Prince, and do you depart to bring help.If they
kill me before you return, I leave you my poor lute, and pray you to be
kind to my poor Charlot.""No, Louise," replied Catharine, "you are a more privileged and
experienced wanderer than I--do you go; and if you find me dead on your
return, as may well chance, give my poor father this ring and a lock of
my hair, and say, Catharine died in endeavouring to save the blood of
Bruce.And give this other lock to Henry; say, Catharine thought of him
to the last, and that, if he has judged her too scrupulous touching the
blood of others, he will then know it was not because she valued her
own."They sobbed in each other's arms, and the intervening hours till evening
were spent in endeavouring to devise some better mode of supplying the
captive with nourishment, and in the construction of a tube, composed
of hollow reeds, slipping into each other, by which liquids might be
conveyed to him.The bell of the village church of Falkland tolled to
vespers.The dey, or farm woman, entered with her pitchers to deliver
the milk for the family, and to hear and tell the news stirring.She had
scarcely entered the kitchen when the female minstrel, again throwing
herself in Catharine's arms, and assuring her of her unalterable
fidelity, crept in silence downstairs, the little dog under her arm.A
moment after, she was seen by the breathless Catharine, wrapt in the dey
woman's cloak, and walking composedly across the drawbridge."So," said the warder, "you return early tonight, May Bridget?Small
mirth towards in the hall--ha, wench!"I have forgotten my tallies," said the ready witted French woman, "and
will return in the skimming of a bowie."She went onward, avoiding the village of Falkland, and took a footpath
which led through the park.Catharine breathed freely, and blessed God
when she saw her lost in the distance.It was another anxious hour
for Catharine which occurred before the escape of the fugitive was
discovered.This happened so soon as the dey girl, having taken an hour
to perform a task which ten minutes might have accomplished, was about
to return, and discovered that some one had taken away her grey frieze
cloak.A strict search was set on foot; at length the women of the
house remembered the glee maiden, and ventured to suggest her as one not
unlikely to exchange an old cloak for a new one.The warder, strictly
questioned, averred he saw the dey woman depart immediately after
vespers; and on this being contradicted by the party herself, he could
suggest, as the only alternative, that it must needs have been the
devil.As, however, the glee woman could not be found, the real circumstances
of the case were easily guessed at; and the steward went to inform Sir
John Ramorny and Dwining, who were now scarcely ever separate, of
the escape of one of their female captives.Everything awakens the
suspicions of the guilty.They looked on each other with faces of
dismay, and then went together to the humble apartment of Catharine,
that they might take her as much as possible by surprise while they
inquired into the facts attending Louise's disappearance.said Ramorny, in a tone of
austere gravity."I have no companion here," answered Catharine."Trifle not," replied the knight; "I mean the glee maiden, who lately
dwelt in this chamber with you.""She is gone, they tell me," said Catharine--"gone about an hour since.""How," answered Catharine, "should I know which way a professed wanderer
may choose to travel?She was tired no doubt of a solitary life, so
different from the scenes of feasting and dancing which her trade leads
her to frequent.She is gone, and the only wonder is that she should
have stayed so long.""This, then," said Ramorny, "is all you have to tell us?""All that I have to tell you, Sir John," answered Catharine, firmly;
"and if the Prince himself inquire, I can tell him no more.""There is little danger of his again doing you the honour to speak to
you in person," said Ramorny, "even if Scotland should escape being
rendered miserable by the sad event of his decease.""Is the Duke of Rothsay so very ill?""No help, save in Heaven," answered Ramorny, looking upward."Then may there yet be help there," said Catharine, "if human aid prove
unavailing!"said Ramorny, with the most determined gravity; while Dwining
adopted a face fit to echo the feeling, though it seemed to cost him
a painful struggle to suppress his sneering yet soft laugh of triumph,
which was peculiarly excited by anything having a religious tendency."And it is men--earthly men, and not incarnate devils, who thus appeal
to Heaven, while they are devouring by inches the life blood of their
hapless master!"muttered Catharine, as her two baffled inquisitors left
the apartment.But it will roll ere long, and
oh!may it be to preserve as well as to punish!"The hour of dinner alone afforded a space when, all in the castle being
occupied with that meal, Catharine thought she had the best opportunity
of venturing to the breach in the wall, with the least chance of being
observed.In waiting for the hour, she observed some stir in the castle,
which had been silent as the grave ever since the seclusion of the Duke
of Rothsay.The portcullis was lowered and raised, and the creaking of
the machinery was intermingled with the tramp of horse, as men at arms
went out and returned with steeds hard ridden and covered with foam.She
observed, too, that such domestics as she casually saw from her window
were in arms.All this made her heart throb high, for it augured the
approach of rescue; and besides, the bustle left the little garden more
lonely than ever.At length the hour of noon arrived; she had taken care
to provide, under pretence of her own wishes, which the pantler seemed
disposed to indulge, such articles of food as could be the most easily
conveyed to the unhappy captive.She whispered to intimate her presence;
there was no answer; she spoke louder, still there was silence."He sleeps," she muttered these words half aloud, and with a shuddering
which was succeeded by a start and a scream, when a voice replied behind
her:

"Yes, he sleeps; but it is for ever."Sir John Ramorny stood behind her in complete armour,
but the visor of his helmet was up, and displayed a countenance more
resembling one about to die than to fight.He spoke with a grave tone,
something between that of a calm observer of an interesting event and of
one who is an agent and partaker in it."Catharine," he said, "all is true which I tell you.You
have done your best for him; you can do no more.""I will not--I cannot believe it," said Catharine."Heaven be merciful
to me!it would make one doubt of Providence, to think so great a crime
has been accomplished.""Doubt not of Providence, Catharine, though it has suffered the
profligate to fall by his own devices.Follow me; I have that to say
which concerns you.I say follow (for she hesitated), unless you prefer
being left to the mercies of the brute Bonthron and the mediciner
Henbane Dwining.""I will follow you," said Catharine."You cannot do more to me than you
are permitted."He led the way into the tower, and mounted staircase after staircase and
ladder after ladder."I will follow no farther," she said.If to my death, I can die here.""Only to the battlements of the castle, fool," said Ramorny, throwing
wide a barred door which opened upon the vaulted roof of the castle,
where men were bending mangonels, as they called them (military engines,
that is, for throwing arrows or stones), getting ready crossbows, and
piling stones together.But the defenders did not exceed twenty in
number, and Catharine thought she could observe doubt and irresolution
amongst them."Catharine," said Ramorny, "I must not quit this station, which is
necessary for my defence; but I can speak with you here as well as
elsewhere.""Say on," answered Catharine, "I am prepared to hear you.""You have thrust yourself, Catharine, into a bloody secret.Have you the
firmness to keep it?""I do not understand you, Sir John," answered the maiden.I have slain--murdered, if you will--my late master, the Duke
of Rothsay.The spark of life which your kindness would have fed
was easily smothered.You are
faint--bear up--you have more to hear.You know the crime, but you know
not the provocation.this gauntlet is empty; I lost my right hand
in his cause, and when I was no longer fit to serve him, I was cast off
like a worn out hound, my loss ridiculed, and a cloister recommended,
instead of the halls and palaces in which I had my natural sphere!Think
on this--pity and assist me.""In what manner can you require my assistance?"said the trembling
maiden; "I can neither repair your loss nor cancel your crime.""Thou canst be silent, Catharine, on what thou hast seen and heard in
yonder thicket.It is but a brief oblivion I ask of you, whose word
will, I know, be listened to, whether you say such things were or were
not.That of your mountebank companion, the foreigner, none will hold
to be of a pin point's value.If you grant me this, I will take your
promise for my security, and throw the gate open to those who now
approach it.If you will not promise silence, I defend this castle till
every one perishes, and I fling you headlong from these battlements.Ay, look at them--it is not a leap to be rashly braved.Seven courses of
stairs brought you up hither with fatigue and shortened breath; but you
shall go from the top to the bottom in briefer time than you can breathe
a sigh!Speak the word, fair maid; for you speak to one unwilling to
harm you, but determined in his purpose."Catharine stood terrified, and without power of answering a man who
seemed so desperate; but she was saved the necessity of reply by the
approach of Dwining.He spoke with the same humble conges which at all
times distinguished his manner, and with his usual suppressed ironical
sneer, which gave that manner the lie."I do you wrong, noble sir, to intrude on your valiancie when engaged
with a fair damsel.But I come to ask a trifling question."said Ramorny; "ill news are sport to thee even when
they affect thyself, so that they concern others also.""Hem!--he, he!--I only desired to know if your knighthood proposed the
chivalrous task of defending the castle with your single hand--I crave
pardon, I meant your single arm?The question is worth asking, for I
am good for little to aid the defence, unless you could prevail on the
besiegers to take physic--he, he, he!--and Bonthron is as drunk as ale
and strong waters can make him; and you, he, and I make up the whole
garrison who are disposed for resistance.""Never saw men who showed less stomach to the work," answered
Dwining--"never.Eviot and his companion Buncle now approached, with sullen resolution
in their faces, like men who had made their minds up to resist that
authority which they had so long obeyed.said Ramorny, stepping forward to meet them.Why have you left the barbican, Eviot?And you other fellow,
did I not charge you to look to the mangonels?""We have something to tell you, Sir John Ramorny," answered Eviot."We
will not fight in this quarrel.""How--my own squires control me?""We were your squires and pages, my lord, while you were master of the
Duke of Rothsay's household.It is bruited about the Duke no longer
lives; we desire to know the truth.""What traitor dares spread such falsehoods?""All who have gone out to skirt the forest, my lord, and I myself among
others, bring back the same news.The minstrel woman who left the castle
yesterday has spread the report everywhere that the Duke of Rothsay
is murdered, or at death's door.The Douglas comes on us with a strong
force--"

"And you, cowards, take advantage of an idle report to forsake your
master?""My lord," said Eviot, "let Buncle and myself see the Duke of Rothsay,
and receive his personal orders for defence of this castle, and if we do
not fight to the death in that quarrel, I will consent to be hanged on
its highest turret.But if he be gone by natural disease, we will yield
up the castle to the Earl of Douglas, who is, they say, the King's
lieutenant.Or if--which Heaven forefend!--the noble Prince has had
foul play, we will not involve ourselves in the guilt of using arms in
defence of the murderers, be they who they will.""Eviot," said Ramorny, raising his mutilated arm, "had not that glove
been empty, thou hadst not lived to utter two words of this insolence.""It is as it is," answered Evict, "and we do but our duty.I have
followed you long, my lord, but here I draw bridle.""Farewell, then, and a curse light on all of you!""Our valiancie is about to run away," said the mediciner, who had crept
close to Catharine's side before she was aware."Catharine, thou art a
superstitious fool, like most women; nevertheless thou hast some mind,
and I speak to thee as one of more understanding than the buffaloes
which are herding about us.These haughty barons who overstride the
world, what are they in the day of adversity?Let
their sledge hammer hands or their column resembling legs have injury,
and bah!Heart and courage is nothing to
them, lith and limb everything: give them animal strength, what are they
better than furious bulls; take that away, and your hero of chivalry
lies grovelling like the brute when he is hamstrung.Not so the sage;
while a grain of sense remains in a crushed or mutilated frame, his mind
shall be strong as ever.Catharine, this morning I was practising your
death; but methinks I now rejoice that you may survive to tell how the
poor mediciner, the pill gilder, the mortar pounder, the poison vender,
met his fate, in company with the gallant Knight of Ramorny, Baron in
possession and Earl of Lindores in expectation--God save his lordship!""Old man," said Catharine, "if thou be indeed so near the day of thy
deserved doom, other thoughts were far wholesomer than the vainglorious
ravings of a vain philosophy.Ask to see a holy man--"

"Yes," said Dwining, scornfully, "refer myself to a greasy monk, who
does not--he!he!--understand the barbarous Latin he repeats by
rote.Such would be a fitting counsellor to one who has studied both
in Spain and Arabia!No, Catharine, I will choose a confessor that is
pleasant to look upon, and you shall be honoured with the office.Now,
look yonder at his valiancie, his eyebrow drops with moisture, his lip
trembles with agony; for his valiancie--he!he!--is pleading for his
life with his late domestics, and has not eloquence enough to persuade
them to let him slip.See how the fibres of his face work as he implores
the ungrateful brutes, whom he has heaped with obligations, to permit
him to get such a start for his life as the hare has from the greyhounds
when men course her fairly.Look also at the sullen, downcast, dogged
faces with which, fluctuating between fear and shame, the domestic
traitors deny their lord this poor chance for his life.These things
thought themselves the superior of a man like me!and you, foolish
wench, think so meanly of your Deity as to suppose wretches like them
are the work of Omnipotence!"said Catharine, warmly; "the God I worship
created these men with the attributes to know and adore Him, to guard
and defend their fellow creatures, to practise holiness and virtue.Their own vices, and the temptations of the Evil One, have made them
such as they now are.Oh, take the lesson home to thine own heart of
adamant!Heaven made thee wiser than thy fellows, gave thee eyes to look
into the secrets of nature, a sagacious heart, and a skilful hand; but
thy pride has poisoned all these fair gifts, and made an ungodly atheist
of one who might have been a Christian sage!""Atheist, say'st thou?""Perhaps I have doubts on that
matter--but they will be soon solved.Yonder comes one who will send
me, as he has done thousands, to the place where all mysteries shall be
cleared."Catharine followed the mediciner's eye up one of the forest glades, and
beheld it occupied by a body of horsemen advancing at full gallop.In
the midst was a pennon displayed, which, though its bearings were not
visible to Catharine, was, by a murmur around, acknowledged as that of
the Black Douglas.They halted within arrow shot of the castle, and a
herald with two trumpets advanced up to the main portal, where, after a
loud flourish, he demanded admittance for the high and dreaded Archibald
Earl of Douglas, Lord Lieutenant of the King, and acting for the time
with the plenary authority of his Majesty; commanding, at the same time,
that the inmates of the castle should lay down their arms, all under
penalty of high treason.said Eviot to Ramorny, who stood sullen and undecided."Will
you give orders to render the castle, or must I?"interrupted the knight, "to the last I will command you.Open the gates, drop the bridge, and render the castle to the Douglas.""Now, that's what may be called a gallant exertion of free will," said
Dwining."Just as if the pieces of brass that were screaming a minute
since should pretend to call those notes their own which are breathed
through them by a frowsy trumpeter."said Catharine, "either be silent or turn thy thoughts
to the eternity on the brink of which thou art standing.""Thou canst not, wench,
help hearing what I say to thee, and thou wilt tell it again, for thy
sex cannot help that either.Perth and all Scotland shall know what a
man they have lost in Henbane Dwining!"The clash of armour now announced that the newcomers had dismounted and
entered the castle, and were in the act of disarming the small garrison.Earl Douglas himself appeared on the battlements, with a few of his
followers, and signed to them to take Ramorny and Dwining into custody.Others dragged from some nook the stupefied Bonthron."It was to these three that the custody of the Prince was solely
committed daring his alleged illness?"said the Douglas, prosecuting an
inquiry which he had commenced in the hall of the castle."No other saw him, my lord," said Eviot, "though I offered my services.""Conduct us to the Duke's apartment, and bring the prisoners with
us.Also should there be a female in the castle, if she hath not been
murdered or spirited away--the companion of the glee maiden who brought
the first alarm.""She is here, my lord," said Eviot, bringing Catharine forward.Her beauty and her agitation made some impression even upon the
impassible Earl."Fear nothing, maiden," he said; "thou hast deserved both praise and
reward.Tell to me, as thou wouldst confess to Heaven, the things thou
hast witnessed in this castle."Few words served Catharine to unfold the dreadful story."It agrees," said the Douglas, "with the tale of the glee maiden, from
point to point.They passed to the room which the unhappy Duke of Rothsay had been
supposed to inhabit; but the key was not to be found, and the Earl could
only obtain entrance by forcing the door.On entering, the wasted and
squalid remains of the unhappy Prince were discovered, flung on the bed
as if in haste.The intention of the murderers had apparently been to
arrange the dead body so as to resemble a timely parted corpse, but they
had been disconcerted by the alarm occasioned by the escape of Louise.Douglas looked on the body of the misguided youth, whose wild passions
and caprices had brought him to this fatal and premature catastrophe."I had wrongs to be redressed," he said; "but to see such a sight as
this banishes all remembrance of injury!"It should have been arranged," said Dwining, "more to your
omnipotence's pleasure; but you came suddenly on us, and hasty masters
make slovenly service."Douglas seemed not to hear what his prisoner said, so closely did he
examine the wan and wasted features, and stiffened limbs, of the dead
body before him.Catharine, overcome by sickness and fainting, at length
obtained permission to retire from the dreadful scene, and, through
confusion of every description, found her way to her former apartment,
where she was locked in the arms of Louise, who had returned in the
interval.The dying hand of the Prince
was found to be clenched upon a lock of hair, resembling, in colour and
texture, the coal black bristles of Bonthron.Thus, though famine had
begun the work, it would seem that Rothsay's death had been finally
accomplished by violence.The private stair to the dungeon, the keys of
which were found at the subaltern assassin's belt, the situation of the
vault, its communication with the external air by the fissure in the
walls, and the wretched lair of straw, with the fetters which remained
there, fully confirmed the story of Catharine and of the glee woman."We will not hesitate an instant," said the Douglas to his near kinsman,
the Lord Balveny, as soon as they returned from the dungeon."But, my lord, some trial may be fitting," answered Balveny."I have taken them red hand; my
authority will stretch to instant execution.Yet stay--have we not some
Jedwood men in our troop?""Plenty of Turnbulls, Rutherfords, Ainslies, and so forth," said
Balveny."Call me an inquest of these together; they are all good men and true,
saving a little shifting for their living.Do you see to the execution
of these felons, while I hold a court in the great hall, and we'll try
whether the jury or the provost marshal do their work first; we will
have Jedwood justice--hang in haste and try at leisure.""Yet stay, my lord," said Ramorny, "you may rue your haste--will you
grant me a word out of earshot?"said Douglas; "speak out what thou hast to say before
all that are here present.""Know all; then," said Ramorny, aloud, "that this noble Earl had letters
from the Duke of Albany and myself, sent him by the hand of yon cowardly
deserter, Buncle--let him deny it if he dare--counselling the removal
of the Duke for a space from court, and his seclusion in this Castle of
Falkland.""But not a word," replied Douglas, sternly smiling, "of his being flung
into a dungeon--famished--strangled.Away with the wretches, Balveny,
they pollute God's air too long!"The prisoners were dragged off to the battlements.But while the means
of execution were in the act of being prepared, the apothecary expressed
so ardent a desire to see Catharine once more, and, as he said, for
the good of his soul, that the maiden, in hopes his obduracy might have
undergone some change even at the last hour, consented again to go
to the battlements, and face a scene which her heart recoiled from.A single glance showed her Bonthron, sunk in total and drunken
insensibility; Ramorny, stripped of his armour, endeavouring in vain to
conceal fear, while he spoke with a priest, whose good offices he had
solicited; and Dwining, the same humble, obsequious looking, crouching
individual she had always known him.He held in his hand a little silver
pen, with which he had been writing on a scrap of parchment."Catharine," he said--"he, he, he!--I wish to speak to thee on the
nature of my religious faith.""If such be thy intention, why lose time with me?"The good father," said Dwining, "is--he, he!--already a worshipper of
the deity whom I have served.I therefore prefer to give the altar of
mine idol a new worshipper in thee, Catharine.This scrap of parchment
will tell thee how to make your way into my chapel, where I have
worshipped so often in safety.I leave the images which it contains to
thee as a legacy, simply because I hate and contemn thee something less
than any of the absurd wretches whom I have hitherto been obliged to
call fellow creatures.And now away--or remain and see if the end of the
quacksalver belies his life.""Nay," said the mediciner, "I have but a single word to say, and yonder
nobleman's valiancie may hear it if he will."Lord Balveny approached, with some curiosity; for the undaunted
resolution of a man who never wielded sword or bore armour and was in
person a poor dwindled dwarf, had to him an air of something resembling
sorcery.""You see this trifling implement," said the criminal, showing the
silver pen."By means of this I can escape the power even of the Black
Douglas.""Give him no ink nor paper," said Balveny, hastily, "he will draw a
spell.""Not so, please your wisdom and valiancie--he, he, he!"said Dwining
with his usual chuckle, as he unscrewed the top of the pen, within which
was a piece of sponge or some such substance, no bigger than a pea."Now, mark this--" said the prisoner, and drew it between his lips.He lay a dead corpse before them, the
contemptuous sneer still on his countenance.Catharine shrieked and fled, seeking, by a hasty descent, an escape from
a sight so appalling.Lord Balveny was for a moment stupified, and then
exclaimed, "This may be glamour!hang him over the battlements, quick
or dead.If his foul spirit hath only withdrawn for a space, it shall
return to a body with a dislocated neck."Ramorny and Bonthron were then ordered for
execution.The last was hanged before he seemed quite to comprehend what
was designed to be done with him.Ramorny, pale as death, yet with
the same spirit of pride which had occasioned his ruin, pleaded his
knighthood, and demanded the privilege of dying by decapitation by the
sword, and not by the noose."The Douglas never alters his doom," said Balveny."But thou shalt have
all thy rights.The menial whom he called appeared at his summons."What shakest thou for, fellow?"said Balveny; "here, strike me this
man's gilt spurs from his heels with thy cleaver.And now, John Ramorny,
thou art no longer a knight, but a knave.To the halter with him,
provost marshal!hang him betwixt his companions, and higher than them
if it may be."In a quarter of an hour afterwards, Balveny descended to tell the
Douglas that the criminals were executed."Then there is no further use in the trial," said the Earl."How say
you, good men of inquest, were these men guilty of high treason--ay or
no?""Guilty," exclaimed the obsequious inquest, with edifying unanimity, "we
need no farther evidence.""Sound trumpets, and to horse then, with our own train only; and let
each man keep silence on what has chanced here, until the proceedings
shall be laid before the King, which cannot conveniently be till the
battle of Palm Sunday shall be fought and ended.Select our attendants,
and tell each man who either goes with us or remains behind that he who
prates dies."In a few minutes the Douglas was on horseback, with the followers
selected to attend his person.Expresses were sent to his daughter, the
widowed Duchess of Rothsay, directing her to take her course to Perth,
by the shores of Lochleven, without approaching Falkland, and committing
to her charge Catharine Glover and the glee woman, as persons whose
safety he tendered.As they rode through the forest, they looked back, and beheld the three
bodies hanging, like specks darkening the walls of the old castle."The hand is punished," said Douglas, "but who shall arraign the head by
whose direction the act was done?""I do, kinsman; and were I to listen to the dictates of my heart, I
would charge him with the deed, which I am certain he has authorised.But there is no proof of it beyond strong suspicion, and Albany has
attached to himself the numerous friends of the house of Stuart, to
whom, indeed, the imbecility of the King and the ill regulated habits
of Rothsay left no other choice of a leader.Were I, therefore, to break
the bond which I have so lately formed with Albany, the consequence
must be civil war, an event ruinous to poor Scotland while threatened
by invasion from the activity of the Percy, backed by the treachery
of March.No, Balveny, the punishment of Albany must rest with Heaven,
which, in its own good time, will execute judgment on him and on his
house."The hour is nigh: now hearts beat high;
     Each sword is sharpen'd well;
     And who dares die, who stoops to fly,
     Tomorrow's light shall tell.We are now to recall to our reader's recollection, that Simon Glover and
his fair daughter had been hurried from their residence without having
time to announce to Henry Smith either their departure or the alarming
cause of it.When, therefore, the lover appeared in Curfew Street, on
the morning of their flight, instead of the hearty welcome of the honest
burgher, and the April reception, half joy half censure, which he had
been promised on the part of his lovely daughter, he received only the
astounding intelligence, that her father and she had set off early, on
the summons of a stranger, who had kept himself carefully muffled from
observation.To this, Dorothy, whose talents for forestalling evil, and
communicating her views of it, are known to the reader, chose to add,
that she had no doubt her master and young mistress were bound for the
Highlands, to avoid a visit which had been made since their departure by
two or three apparitors, who, in the name of a Commission appointed by
the King, had searched the house, put seals upon such places as were
supposed to contain papers, and left citations for father and daughter
to appear before the Court of Commission, on a day certain, under pain
of outlawry.All these alarming particulars Dorothy took care to state
in the gloomiest colours, and the only consolation which she afforded
the alarmed lover was, that her master had charged her to tell him to
reside quietly at Perth, and that he should soon hear news of them.This
checked the smith's first resolve, which was to follow them instantly to
the Highlands, and partake the fate which they might encounter.But when he recollected his repeated feuds with divers of the Clan
Quhele, and particularly his personal quarrel with Conachar, who was now
raised to be a high chief, he could not but think, on reflection, that
his intrusion on their place of retirement was more likely to disturb
the safety which they might otherwise enjoy there than be of any service
to them.He was well acquainted with Simon's habitual intimacy with
the chief of the Clan Quhele, and justly augured that the glover would
obtain protection, which his own arrival might be likely to disturb,
while his personal prowess could little avail him in a quarrel with
a whole tribe of vindictive mountaineers.At the same time his heart
throbbed with indignation, when he thought of Catharine being within the
absolute power of young Conachar, whose rivalry he could not doubt, and
who had
