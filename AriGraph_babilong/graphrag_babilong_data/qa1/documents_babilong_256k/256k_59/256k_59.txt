That she was a woman and rather short and plainly dressed,
and that her bobbing up and down annoyed him, was all that he realized
of her presence, and he quite failed to connect her movements with
himself in any way."Sir," she said in French, "I beg your pardon,
but might I speak with you?"The Goodwood Plunger possessed a somewhat
various knowledge of Monte Carlo and its _habitues_.It was not the
first time that women who had lost at the tables had begged a napoleon
from him, or asked the distinguished child of fortune what color or
combination she should play.That, in his luckier days, had happened
often and had amused him, but now he moved back irritably and wished
that the figure in front of him would disappear as it had come."I am in great trouble, sir," the woman said."I have no friends here,
sir, to whom I may apply.I am very bold, but my anxiety is very great."The Goodwood Plunger raised his hat slightly and bowed.Then he
concentrated his eyes with what was a distinct effort on the queer
little figure hovering in front of him, and stared very hard.She wore
an odd piece of red coral for a brooch, and by looking steadily at
this he brought the rest of the figure into focus and saw, without
surprise,--for every commonplace seemed strange to him now, and
everything peculiar quite a matter of course,--that she was distinctly
not an _habituee_ of the place, and looked more like a lady's maid than
an adventuress.She was French and pretty,--such a girl as might wait in
a Duval restaurant or sit as a cashier behind a little counter near the
door."We should not be here," she said, as if in answer to his look and in
apology for her presence."But Louis, my husband, he would come.I told
him that this was not for such as we are, but Louis is so bold.He said
that upon his marriage tour he would live with the best, and so here
he must come to play as the others do.We have been married, sir, only
since Tuesday, and we must go back to Paris to-morrow; they would give
him only the three days.He is not a gambler; he plays dominos at the
cafes, it is true.He is young and with so much
spirit, and I know that you, sir, who are so fortunate and who
understand so well how to control these tables, I know that you will
persuade him.He will not listen to me; he is so greatly excited and so
little like himself.You will help me, sir, will you not?The Goodwood Plunger knit his eyebrows and closed the lids once or
twice, and forced the mistiness and pain out of his eyes.The woman seemed to be talking a great deal and to say
very much, but he could not make sense of it."I can't understand," he said wearily, turning away."It is my husband," the woman said anxiously: "Louis, he is playing at
the table inside, and he is only an apprentice to old Carbut the baker,
but he owns a third of the store.It was my _dot_ that paid for it," she
added proudly."Old Carbut says he may have it all for 20,000 francs,
and then old Carbut will retire, and we will be proprietors.We have
saved a little, and we had counted to buy the rest in five or six years
if we were very careful.""I see, I see," said the Plunger, with a little short laugh of relief;
"I understand."He was greatly comforted to think that it was not so bad
as it had threatened.He saw her distinctly now and followed what she
said quite easily, and even such a small matter as talking with this
woman seemed to help him."He is gambling," he said, "and losing the money, and you come to me to
advise him what to play.Well, tell him he will lose what
little he has left; tell him I advise him to go home; tell him--"

"No, no!"the girl said excitedly; "you do not understand; he has not
lost, he has won.He has won, oh, so many rolls of money, but he will
not stop.He has won as much as we could earn in many
months--in many years, sir, by saving and working, oh, so very hard!And
now he risks it again, and I cannot force him away.But if you, sir,
if you would tell him how great the chances are against him, if you who
know would tell him how foolish he is not to be content with what he
has, he would listen.you are a woman'; and he is
so red and fierce; he is imbecile with the sight of the money, but he
will listen to a grand gentleman like you.He thinks to win more and
more, and he thinks to buy another third from old Carbut."Oh, yes," said the Goodwood Plunger, nodding, "I see now.You want me
to take him away so that he can keep what he has.I see; but I don't
know him.He will not listen to me, you know; I have no right to
interfere."He turned away, rubbing his hand across his forehead.He wished so much
that this woman would leave him by himself."Ah, but, sir," cried the girl, desperately, and touching his coat, "you
who are so fortunate, and so rich, and of the great world, you cannot
feel what this is to me.To have my own little shop and to be free, and
not to slave, and sew, and sew until my back and fingers burn with the
pain.Speak to him, sir; ah, speak to him!It is so easy a thing to do,
and he will listen to you."The Goodwood Plunger turned again abruptly.The woman ran ahead, with a murmur of gratitude, to the open door and
pointed to where her husband was standing leaning over and placing
some money on one of the tables.He was a handsome young Frenchman,
as _bourgeois_ as his wife, and now terribly alive and excited.In the
self-contained air of the place and in contrast with the silence of the
great hall he seemed even more conspicuously out of place.The
Plunger touched him on the arm, and the Frenchman shoved the hand off
impatiently and without looking around.The Plunger touched him again
and forced him to turn toward him."Madame, your wife," said Cecil, with the grave politeness of an old
man, "has done me the honor to take me into her confidence.She tells me
that you have won a great deal of money; that you could put it to good
use at home, and so save yourselves much drudgery and debt, and all
that sort of trouble.You are quite right if you say it is no concern of
mine.But really, you know there is a great deal of sense in
what she wants, and you have apparently already won a large sum."He paused for
a second or two in some doubt, and even awe, for the disinherited
one carried the mark of a personage of consideration and of one whose
position is secure.Then he gave a short, unmirthful laugh."You are most kind, sir," he said with mock politeness and with an
impatient shrug."But madame, my wife, has not done well to interest a
stranger in this affair, which, as you say, concerns you not."He turned to the table again with a defiant swagger of independence and
placed two rolls of money upon the cloth, casting at the same moment a
childish look of displeasure at his wife."You see," said the Plunger,
with a deprecatory turning out of his hands.But there was so much grief
on the girl's face that he turned again to the gambler and touched his
arm.He could not tell why he was so interested in these two.He had
witnessed many such scenes before, and they had not affected him in any
way except to make him move out of hearing.But the same dumb numbness
in his head, which made so many things seem possible that should have
been terrible even to think upon, made him stubborn and unreasonable
over this.He felt intuitively--it could not be said that he
thought--that the woman was right and the man wrong, and so he grasped
him again by the arm, and said sharply this time:

"Come away!But even as he spoke the red won, and the Frenchman with a boyish gurgle
of pleasure raked in his winnings with his two hands, and then turned
with a happy, triumphant laugh to his wife.It is not easy to convince a
man that he is making a fool of himself when he is winning some hundred
francs every two minutes.His silent arguments to the contrary are
difficult to answer.But the Plunger did not regard this in the least.he said in the same stubborn tone and with much the
same manner with which he would have spoken to a groom.Again the Frenchman tossed off his hand, this time with an execration,
and again he placed the rolls of gold coin on the red; and again the red
won.cried the girl, running her fingers over the rolls on the
table, "he has won half of the 20,000 francs.Oh, sir, stop him, stop
him!"cried the Plunger, excited to a degree of utter
self-forgetfulness, and carried beyond himself; "you've got to come with
me.""Take away your hand," whispered the young Frenchman, fiercely."See,
I shall win it all; in one grand _coup_ I shall win it all.I shall win
five years' pay in one moment."He swept all of the money forward on the red and threw himself over the
table to see the wheel.whispered the Plunger, excitedly."If you will
risk it, risk it with some reason.You can't play all that money; they
won't take it.Six thousand francs is the limit, unless," he ran on
quickly, "you divide the 12,000 francs among the three of us.You
understand, 6,000 francs is all that any one person can play; but if you
give 4,000 to me, and 4,000 to your wife, and keep 4,000 yourself, we
can each chance it.You can back the red if you like, your wife shall
put her money on the numbers coming up below eighteen, and I will back
the odd.In that way you stand to win 24,000 francs if our combination
wins, and you lose less than if you simply back the color.cried the Frenchman, reaching for the piles of money which the
Plunger had divided rapidly into three parts, "on the red; all on the
red!""I may not know much,
but you should allow me to understand this dirty business."He caught
the Frenchman by the wrists, and the young man, more impressed with the
strange look in the boy's face than by his physical force, stood still,
while the ball rolled and rolled, and clicked merrily, and stopped, and
balanced, and then settled into the "seven.""Red, odd, and below," the croupier droned mechanically.said the Plunger, with sudden
calmness."You have won more than your 20,000 francs; you are
proprietors--I congratulate you!"cried the Frenchman, in a frenzy of delight, "I will
double it."He reached toward the fresh piles of coin as if he meant to sweep them
back again, but the Plunger put himself in his way and with a quick
movement caught up the rolls of money and dropped them into the skirt of
the woman, which she raised like an apron to receive her treasure."Now," said young Harringford, determinedly, "you come with me."The
Frenchman tried to argue and resist, but the Plunger pushed him on with
the silent stubbornness of a drunken man.He handed the woman into a
carriage at the door, shoved her husband in beside her, and while the
man drove to the address she gave him, he told the Frenchman, with an
air of a chief of police, that he must leave Monte Carlo at once, that
very night."Do you fancy I speak without
knowledge?I've seen them come here rich and go away paupers.But you
shall not; you shall keep what you have and spite them."He sent the
woman up to her room to pack while he expostulated with and browbeat
the excited bridegroom in the carriage.When she returned with the bag
packed, and so heavy with the gold that the servants could hardly lift
it up beside the driver, he ordered the coachman to go down the hill to
the station."The train for Paris leaves at midnight," he said, "and you will be
there by morning.Then you must close your bargain with this old Carbut,
and never return here again."The Frenchman had turned during the ride from an angry, indignant
prisoner to a joyful madman, and was now tearfully and effusively humble
in his petitions for pardon and in his thanks.Their benefactor, as they
were pleased to call him, hurried them into the waiting train and ran to
purchase their tickets for them."Now," he said, as the guard locked the door of the compartment, "you
are alone, and no one can get in, and you cannot get out.Go back to
your home, to your new home, and never come to this wretched place
again.Promise me--you understand?--never again!"They embraced each other like
children, and the man, pulling off his hat, called upon the good Lord to
thank the gentleman."You will be in Paris, will you not?"said the woman, in an ecstasy of
pleasure, "and you will come to see us in our own shop, will you not?we should be so greatly honored, sir, if you would visit us; if you
would come to the home you have given us.You have helped us so greatly,
sir," she said; "and may Heaven bless you!"She caught up his gloved hand as it rested on the door and kissed it
until he snatched it away in great embarrassment and flushing like a
girl.Her husband drew her toward him, and the young bride sat at
his side with her face close to his and wept tears of pleasure and of
excitement.said the young man, joyfully; "look how happy you have
made us.You have made us happy for the rest of our lives."The train moved out with a quick, heavy rush, and the car-wheels took
up the young stranger's last words and seemed to say, "You have made us
happy--made us happy for the rest of our lives."It had all come about so rapidly that the Plunger had had no time to
consider or to weigh his motives, and all that seemed real to him now,
as he stood alone on the platform of the dark, deserted station, were
the words of the man echoing and re-echoing like the refrain of the
song.And then there came to him suddenly, and with all the force of
a gambler's superstition, the thought that the words were the same as
those which his father had used in his letter, "you can make us happy
for the rest of our lives.""Ah," he said, with a quick gasp of doubt, "if I could!If I made those
poor fools happy, mayn't I live to be something to him, and to her?he cried, but so gently that one at his elbow could not have heard
him, "if I could, if I could!"He tossed up his hands, and drew them down again and clenched them in
front of him, and raised his tired, hot eyes to the calm purple sky with
its millions of moving stars.And as he lowered his head the queer numb feeling seemed to go, and
a calm came over his nerves and left him in peace.He did not know what
it might be, nor did he dare to question the change which had come to
him, but turned and slowly mounted the hill, with the awe and fear still
upon him of one who had passed beyond himself for one brief moment into
another world.When he reached his room he found his servant bending
with an anxious face over a letter which he tore up guiltily as his
master entered."You were writing to my father," said Cecil, gently,
"were you not?Well, you need not finish your letter; we are going home."I am going away from this place, Walters," he said as he pulled off his
coat and threw himself heavily on the bed."I will take the first train
that leaves here, and I will sleep a little while you put up my things.The first train, you understand--within an hour, if it leaves that
soon."His head sank back on the pillows heavily, as though he had come
in from a long, weary walk, and his eyes closed and his arms fell easily
at his side.The servant stood frightened and yet happy, with the tears
running down his cheeks, for he loved his master dearly."We are going home, Walters," the Plunger whispered drowsily."We are
going home; home to England and Harringford and the governor--and we are
going to be happy for all the rest of our lives."He paused a moment,
and Walters bent forward over the bed and held his breath to listen."For he came to me," murmured the boy, as though he was speaking in his
sleep, "when I was yet a great way off--while I was yet a great way off,
and ran to meet me--"

His voice sank until it died away into silence, and a few hours later,
when Walters came to wake him, he found his master sleeping like a child
and smiling in his sleep.THE CYNICAL MISS CATHERWAIGHT


Miss Catherwaight's collection of orders and decorations and medals was
her chief offence in the eyes of those of her dear friends who thought
her clever but cynical.All of them were willing to admit that she was clever, but some of them
said she was clever only to be unkind.Young Van Bibber had said that if Miss Catherwaight did not like dances
and days and teas, she had only to stop going to them instead of making
unpleasant remarks about those who did.So many people repeated this
that young Van Bibber believed finally that he had said something good,
and was somewhat pleased in consequence, as he was not much given to
that sort of thing.Catherwaight, while she was alive, lived solely for society, and,
so some people said, not only lived but died for it.She certainly did
go about a great deal, and she used to carry her husband away from
his library every night of every season and left him standing in
the doorways of drawing-rooms, outwardly courteous and distinguished
looking, but inwardly somnolent and unhappy.She was a born and trained
social leader, and her daughter's coming out was to have been the
greatest effort of her life.She regarded it as an event in the dear
child's lifetime second only in importance to her birth; equally
important with her probable marriage and of much more poignant interest
than her possible death.But the great effort proved too much for
the mother, and she died, fondly remembered by her peers and tenderly
referred to by a great many people who could not even show a card for
her Thursdays.Her husband and her daughter were not going out, of
necessity, for more than a year after her death, and then felt no
inclination to begin over again, but lived very much together and showed
themselves only occasionally.They entertained, though, a great deal, in the way of dinners, and
an invitation to one of these dinners soon became a diploma for
intellectual as well as social qualifications of a very high order.One was always sure of meeting some one of consideration there, which
was pleasant in itself, and also rendered it easy to let one's friends
know where one had been dining.It sounded so flat to boast abruptly, "I
dined at the Catherwaights' last night"; while it seemed only natural to
remark, "That reminds me of a story that novelist, what's his name, told
at Mr.Catherwaight's," or "That English chap, who's been in Africa, was
at the Catherwaights' the other night, and told me--"

After one of these dinners people always asked to be allowed to look
over Miss Catherwaight's collection, of which almost everybody had
heard.It consisted of over a hundred medals and decorations which Miss
Catherwaight had purchased while on the long tours she made with her
father in all parts of the world.Each of them had been given as a
reward for some public service, as a recognition of some virtue of the
highest order--for personal bravery, for statesmanship, for great genius
in the arts; and each had been pawned by the recipient or sold outright.Miss Catherwaight referred to them as her collection of dishonored
honors, and called them variously her Orders of the Knights of the
Almighty Dollar, pledges to patriotism and the pawnshops, and honors at
second-hand.It was her particular fad to get as many of these together as she could
and to know the story of each.The less creditable the story, the more
highly she valued the medal.People might think it was not a pretty
hobby for a young girl, but they could not help smiling at the stories
and at the scorn with which she told them."These," she would say, "are crosses of the Legion of Honor; they are of
the lowest degree, that of chevalier.I keep them in this cigar box to
show how cheaply I got them and how cheaply I hold them.I think you
can get them here in New York for ten dollars; they cost more than
that--about a hundred francs--in Paris.The
French government can imprison you, you know, for ten years, if you wear
one without the right to do so, but they have no punishment for those
who choose to part with them for a mess of pottage."All these," she would run on, "are English war medals.See, on this one
is 'Alma,' 'Balaclava,' and 'Sebastopol.'He was quite a veteran, was he
not?Well, he sold this to a dealer on Wardour Street, London, for five
and six.You can get any number of them on the Bowery for their weight
in silver.I tried very hard to get a Victoria Cross when I was in
England, and I only succeeded in getting this one after a great deal of
trouble.They value the cross so highly, you know, that it is the only
other decoration in the case which holds the Order of the Garter in the
Jewel Room at the Tower.It is made of copper, so that its intrinsic
value won't have any weight with the man who gets it, but I bought this
nevertheless for five pounds.The soldier to whom it belonged had loaded
and fired a cannon all alone when the rest of the men about the battery
had run away.He was captured by the enemy, but retaken immediately
afterward by re-enforcements from his own side, and the general in
command recommended him to the Queen for decoration.He sold his cross
to the proprietor of a curiosity shop and drank himself to death.I felt
rather meanly about keeping it and hunted up his widow to return it to
her, but she said I could have it for a consideration."This gold medal was given, as you see, to 'Hiram J. Stillman, of the
sloop _Annie Barker_, for saving the crew of the steamship _Olivia_,
June 18, 1888,' by the President of the United States and both houses of
Congress.I found it on Baxter Street in a pawnshop.The gallant Hiram
J. had pawned it for sixteen dollars and never came back to claim it.""But, Miss Catherwaight," some optimist would object, "these men
undoubtedly did do something brave and noble once.You can't get back
of that; and they didn't do it for a medal, either, but because it was
their duty.And so the medal meant nothing to them: their conscience
told them they had done the right thing; they didn't need a stamped coin
to remind them of it, or of their wounds, either, perhaps.""Quite right; that's quite true," Miss Catherwaight would say.Look at this gold medal with the diamonds: 'Presented to
Colonel James F. Placer by the men of his regiment, in camp before
Richmond.'Every soldier in the regiment gave something toward that, and
yet the brave gentleman put it up at a game of poker one night, and the
officer who won it sold it to the man who gave it to me.Miss Catherwaight was well known to the proprietors of the pawnshops and
loan offices on the Bowery and Park Row.They learned to look for her
once a month, and saved what medals they received for her and tried to
learn their stories from the people who pawned them, or else invented
some story which they hoped would answer just as well.Though her brougham produced a sensation in the unfashionable streets
into which she directed it, she was never annoyed.Her maid went with
her into the shops, and one of the grooms always stood at the door
within call, to the intense delight of the neighborhood.And one day she
found what, from her point of view, was a perfect gem.It was a poor,
cheap-looking, tarnished silver medal, a half-dollar once, undoubtedly,
beaten out roughly into the shape of a heart and engraved in script by
the jeweller of some country town.On one side were two clasped hands
with a wreath around them, and on the reverse was this inscription:
"From Henry Burgoyne to his beloved friend Lewis L. Lockwood"; and
below, "Through prosperity and adversity."And here it
was among razors and pistols and family Bibles in a pawnbroker's window.These two boy friends, and their boyish
friendship that was to withstand adversity and prosperity, and all that
remained of it was this inscription to its memory like the wording on a
tomb!"He couldn't have got so much on it any way," said the pawnbroker,
entering into her humor."I didn't lend him more'n a quarter of a dollar
at the most."Miss Catherwaight stood wondering if the Lewis L. Lockwood could be
Lewis Lockwood, the lawyer one read so much about.Then she remembered
his middle name was Lyman, and said quickly, "I'll take it, please."She stepped into the carriage, and told the man to go find a directory
and look for Lewis Lyman Lockwood.The groom returned in a few minutes
and said there was such a name down in the book as a lawyer, and that
his office was such a number on Broadway; it must be near Liberty."Go
there," said Miss Catherwaight.Her determination was made so quickly that they had stopped in front of
a huge pile of offices, sandwiched in, one above the other, until they
towered mountains high, before she had quite settled in her mind what
she wanted to know, or had appreciated how strange her errand might
appear.Lockwood was out, one of the young men in the outer office
said, but the junior partner, Mr.Latimer, was in and would see her.She had only time to remember that the junior partner was a dancing
acquaintance of hers, before young Mr.Latimer stood before her smiling,
and with her card in his hand.Lockwood is out just at present, Miss Catherwaight," he said, "but
he will be back in a moment.Won't you come into the other room and
wait?I'm sure he won't be away over five minutes.She saw that he was surprised to see her, and a little ill at ease as
to just how to take her visit.He tried to make it appear that he
considered it the most natural thing in the world, but he overdid it,
and she saw that her presence was something quite out of the common.This did not tend to set her any more at her ease.She already regretted
the step she had taken.What if it should prove to be the same Lockwood,
she thought, and what would they think of her?Lockwood," she said, as she
followed him into the inner office."I fear I have come upon a very
foolish errand, and one that has nothing at all to do with the law.""Not a breach of promise suit, then?""Perhaps it is only an innocent subscription to a most worthy charity.I
was afraid at first," he went on lightly, "that it was legal redress you
wanted, and I was hoping that the way I led the Courdert's cotillion
had made you think I could conduct you through the mazes of the law as
well.""No," returned Miss Catherwaight, with a nervous laugh; "it has to do
with my unfortunate collection.This is what brought me here," she said,
holding out the silver medal."I came across it just now in the Bowery.The name was the same, and I thought it just possible Mr.Lockwood would
like to have it; or, to tell you the truth, that he might tell me what
had become of the Henry Burgoyne who gave it to him."Young Latimer had the medal in his hand before she had finished
speaking, and was examining it carefully.He looked up with just a touch
of color in his cheeks and straightened himself visibly."Please don't be offended," said the fair collector.You've heard of my stupid collection, and I know you think
I meant to add this to it.But, indeed, now that I have had time to
think--you see I came here immediately from the pawnshop, and I was
so interested, like all collectors, you know, that I didn't stop to
consider.That's the worst of a hobby; it carries one rough-shod over
other people's feelings, and runs away with one.I beg of you, if you do
know anything about the coin, just to keep it and don't tell me, and I
assure you what little I know I will keep quite to myself."Young Latimer bowed, and stood looking at her curiously, with the medal
in his hand."I hardly know what to say," he began slowly.You say you found this on the Bowery, in a pawnshop.Well, of
course, you know Mr.Miss Catherwaight shook her head vehemently and smiled in deprecation."This medal was in his safe when he lived on Thirty-fifth Street at
the time he was robbed, and the burglars took this with the rest of the
silver and pawned it, I suppose.Lockwood would have given more for
it than any one else could have afforded to pay."He paused a moment,
and then continued more rapidly: "Henry Burgoyne is Judge Burgoyne.Lockwood and he were friends when they
were boys.They were Damon
and Pythias and that sort of thing.They roomed together at the State
college and started to practise law in Tuckahoe as a firm, but they made
nothing of it, and came on to New York and began reading law again with
Fuller & Mowbray.It was while they were at school that they had these
medals made.There was a mate to this, you know; Judge Burgoyne had it.Well, they continued to live and work together.They were both orphans
and dependent on themselves.I suppose that was one of the strongest
bonds between them; and they knew no one in New York, and always spent
their spare time together.They were pretty poor, I fancy, from all
Mr.Lockwood has told me, but they were very ambitious.They were--I'm
telling you this, you understand, because it concerns you somewhat:
well, more or less.They were great sportsmen, and whenever they could
get away from the law office they would go off shooting.I think they
were fonder of each other than brothers even.Lockwood
tell of the days they lay in the rushes along the Chesapeake Bay waiting
for duck.He has said often that they were the happiest hours of his
life.That was their greatest pleasure, going off together after duck or
snipe along the Maryland waters.Well, they grew rich and began to know
people; and then they met a girl.It seems they both thought a great
deal of her, as half the New York men did, I am told; and she was the
reigning belle and toast, and had other admirers, and neither met with
that favor she showed--well, the man she married, for instance.But for
a while each thought, for some reason or other, that he was especially
favored.Lockwood never spoke of it
to me.But they both fell very deeply in love with her, and each thought
the other disloyal, and so they quarrelled; and--and then, though the
woman married, the two men kept apart.It was the one great passion
of their lives, and both were proud, and each thought the other in the
wrong, and so they have kept apart ever since.And--well, I believe that
is all."Miss Catherwaight had listened in silence and with one little gloved
hand tightly clasping the other.Latimer, indeed," she began, tremulously, "I am terribly
ashamed of myself.I seemed to have rushed in where angels fear to
tread.Of course I might
have known there was a woman in the case, it adds so much to the story.But I suppose I must give up my medal.I never could tell that story,
could I?""No," said young Latimer, dryly; "I wouldn't if I were you."Something in his tone, and something in the fact that he seemed to avoid
her eyes, made her drop the lighter vein in which she had been speaking,
and rise to go.There was much that he had not told her, she suspected,
and when she bade him good-by it was with a reserve which she had not
shown at any other time during their interview.she murmured, as young Latimer turned
from the brougham door and said "Home," to the groom.She thought about
it a great deal that afternoon; at times she repented that she had given
up the medal, and at times she blushed that she should have been carried
in her zeal into such an unwarranted intimacy with another's story.She determined finally to ask her father about it.He would be sure to
know, she thought, as he and Mr.Then
she decided finally not to say anything about it at all, for Mr.Catherwaight did not approve of the collection of dishonored honors
as it was, and she had no desire to prejudice him still further by a
recital of her afternoon's adventure, of which she had no doubt but he
would also disapprove.So she was more than usually silent during
the dinner, which was a tete-a-tete family dinner that night, and she
allowed her father to doze after it in the library in his great chair
without disturbing him with either questions or confessions.{Illustration with caption: "What can Mr.Lockwood be calling upon me
about?"}They had been sitting there some time, he with his hands folded on the
evening paper and with his eyes closed, when the servant brought in a
card and offered it to Mr.Catherwaight fumbled
over his glasses, and read the name on the card aloud: "'Mr.Miss Catherwaight sat upright, and reached out for the card with a
nervous, gasping little laugh."Oh, I think it must be for me," she said; "I'm quite sure it is
intended for me.I was at his office to-day, you see, to return him some
keepsake of his that I found in an old curiosity shop.Something with
his name on it that had been stolen from him and pawned.You needn't go down, dear; I'll see him.It was I he asked for,
I'm sure; was it not, Morris?"Morris was not quite sure; being such an old gentleman, he thought it
must be for Mr.He did not like to disturb
his after-dinner nap, and he settled back in his chair again and
refolded his hands."I hardly thought he could have come to see me," he murmured, drowsily;
"though I used to see enough and more than enough of Lewis Lockwood
once, my dear," he added with a smile, as he opened his eyes and nodded
before he shut them again."That was before your mother and I were
engaged, and people did say that young Lockwood's chances at that time
were as good as mine.He was very attentive,
though; _very_ attentive."Miss Catherwaight stood startled and motionless at the door from which
she had turned.she asked quickly, and in a very low voice.Catherwaight did not deign to open his eyes this time, but moved his
head uneasily as if he wished to be let alone."To your mother, of course, my child," he answered; "of whom else was I
speaking?"Miss Catherwaight went down the stairs to the drawing-room slowly, and
paused half-way to allow this new suggestion to settle in her mind.There was something distasteful to her, something that seemed not
altogether unblamable, in a woman's having two men quarrel about her,
neither of whom was the woman's husband.And yet this girl of whom
Latimer had spoken must be her mother, and she, of course, could do no
wrong.It was very disquieting, and she went on down the rest of the way
with one hand resting heavily on the railing and with the other pressed
against her cheeks.It now seemed to her very
sad indeed that these two one-time friends should live in the same city
and meet, as they must meet, and not recognize each other.She argued
that her mother must have been very young when it happened, or she would
have brought two such men together again.Her mother could not have
known, she told herself; she was not to blame.For she felt sure that
had she herself known of such an accident she would have done something,
said something, to make it right.And she was not half the woman her
mother had been, she was sure of that.There was something very likable in the old gentleman who came forward
to greet her as she entered the drawing-room; something courtly and of
the old school, of which she was so tired of hearing, but of which she
wished she could have seen more in the men she met.Latimer
had accompanied his guardian, exactly why she did not see, but she
recognized his presence slightly.He seemed quite content to remain in
the background.Lockwood, as she had expected, explained that he had
called to thank her for the return of the medal.He had it in his hand
as he spoke, and touched it gently with the tips of his fingers as
though caressing it."I knew your father very well," said the lawyer, "and I at one time had
the honor of being one of your mother's younger friends.That was before
she was married, many years ago."He stopped and regarded the girl
gravely and with a touch of tenderness."You will pardon an old man, old
enough to be your father, if he says," he went on, "that you are greatly
like your mother, my dear young lady--greatly like.Your mother was
very kind to me, and I fear I abused her kindness; abused it by
misunderstanding it.There was a great deal of misunderstanding; and
I was proud, and my friend was proud, and so the misunderstanding
continued, until now it has become irretrievable."He had forgotten her presence apparently, and was speaking more to
himself than to her as he stood looking down at the medal in his hand."You were very thoughtful to give me this," he continued; "it was very
good of you.I don't know why I should keep it though, now, although I
was distressed enough when I lost it.But now it is only a reminder of
a time that is past and put away, but which was very, very dear to me.Perhaps I should tell you that I had a misunderstanding with the friend
who gave it to me, and since then we have never met; have ceased to
know each other.But I have always followed his life as a judge and as a
lawyer, and respected him for his own sake as a man.I cannot tell--I do
not know how he feels toward me."The old lawyer turned the medal over in his hand and stood looking down
at it wistfully.The cynical Miss Catherwaight could not stand it any longer.Lockwood," she said, impulsively, "Mr.Latimer has told me why
you and your friend separated, and I cannot bear to think that it
was she--my mother--should have been the cause.She could not have
understood; she must have been innocent of any knowledge of the trouble
she had brought to men who were such good friends of hers and to each
other.It seems to me as though my finding that coin is more than a
coincidence.I somehow think that the daughter is to help undo the harm
that her mother has caused--unwittingly caused.Keep the medal and don't
give it back to me, for I am sure your friend has kept his, and I am
sure he is still your friend at heart.Don't think I am speaking hastily
or that I am thoughtless in what I am saying, but it seems to me as if
friends--good, true friends--were so few that one cannot let them go
without a word to bring them back.But though I am only a girl, and a
very light and unfeeling girl, some people think, I feel this very
much, and I do wish I could bring your old friend back to you again as I
brought back his pledge.""It has been many years since Henry Burgoyne and I have met," said the
old man, slowly, "and it would be quite absurd to think that he still
holds any trace of that foolish, boyish feeling of loyalty that we once
had for each other.Yet I will keep this, if you will let me, and I
thank you, my dear young lady, for what you have said.I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.You are as good and as kind as your mother was,
and--I can say nothing, believe me, in higher praise."He rose slowly and made a movement as if to leave the room, and then,
as if the excitement of this sudden return into the past could not
be shaken off so readily, he started forward with a move of sudden
determination."I think," he said, "I will go to Henry Burgoyne's house at once,
to-night.I will see if this has
or has not been one long, unprofitable mistake.If my visit should
be fruitless, I will send you this coin to add to your collection of
dishonored honors, but if it should result as I hope it may, it will be
your doing, Miss Catherwaight, and two old men will have much to thank
you for.Good-night," he said as he bowed above her hand, "and--God
bless you!"Miss Catherwaight flushed slightly at what he had said, and sat looking
down at the floor for a moment after the door had closed behind him.Latimer moved uneasily in his chair.The routine of the office
had been strangely disturbed that day, and he now failed to recognize
in the girl before him with reddened cheeks and trembling eyelashes the
cold, self-possessed young woman of society whom he had formerly known."You have done very well, if you will let me say so," he began, gently."I hope you are right in what you said, and that Mr.Lockwood will not
meet with a rebuff or an ungracious answer.Why," he went on quickly, "I
have seen him take out his gun now every spring and every fall for the
last ten years and clean and polish it and tell what great shots he and
Henry, as he calls him, used to be.And then he would say he would take
a holiday and get off for a little shooting.He would
put the gun back into its case again and mope in his library for days
afterward.You see, he never married, and though he adopted me, in a
manner, and is fond of me in a certain way, no one ever took the place
in his heart his old friend had held.""You will let me know, will you not, at once,--to-night, even,--whether
he succeeds or not?""You can
understand why I am so deeply interested.I see now why you said I
would not tell the story of that medal.But, after all, it may be the
prettiest story, the only pretty story I have to tell."Lockwood had not returned, the man said, when young Latimer reached
the home the lawyer had made for them both.He did not know what to
argue from this, but determined to sit up and wait, and so sat smoking
before the fire and listening with his sense of hearing on a strain for
the first movement at the door.The front door shut with a clash, and he heard
Mr.Lockwood crossing the hall quickly to the library, in which he
waited.Then the inner door was swung back, and Mr.Lockwood came in
with his head high and his eyes smiling brightly.There was something in his step that had not been there before,
something light and vigorous, and he looked ten years younger.He
crossed the room to his writing-table without speaking and began tossing
the papers about on his desk.Then he closed the rolling-top lid with a
snap and looked up smiling."I shall have to ask you to look after things at the office for a little
while," he said."Judge Burgoyne and I are going to Maryland for a few
weeks' shooting."VAN BIBBER AND THE SWAN-BOATS


It was very hot in the Park, and young Van Bibber, who has a good heart
and a great deal more money than good-hearted people generally get, was
cross and somnolent.He had told his groom to bring a horse he wanted to
try to the Fifty-ninth Street entrance at ten o'clock, and the groom had
not appeared.He waited as long as his dignity would allow, and then turned off into
a by-lane end dropped on a bench and looked gloomily at the Lohengrin
swans with the paddle-wheel attachment that circle around the lake.They struck him as the most idiotic inventions he had ever seen, and he
pitied, with the pity of a man who contemplates crossing the ocean to
be measured for his fall clothes, the people who could find delight in
having some one paddle them around an artificial lake.Two little girls from the East Side, with a lunch basket, and an older
girl with her hair down her back, sat down on a bench beside him and
gazed at the swans.The place was becoming too popular, and Van Bibber decided to move on.But the bench on which he sat was in the shade, and the asphalt walk
leading to the street was in the sun, and his cigarette was soothing,
so he ignored the near presence of the three little girls, and remained
where he was."I s'pose," said one of the two little girls, in a high, public school
voice, "there's lots to see from those swan-boats that youse can't see
from the banks.""Oh, lots," assented the girl with long hair."If you walked all round the lake, clear all the way round, you could
see all there is to see," said the third, "except what there's in the
middle where the island is.""I guess it's mighty wild on that island," suggested the youngest."Eddie Case he took a trip around the lake on a swan-boat the other day.He said youse could see fishes and ducks, and
that it looked just as if there were snakes and things on the island."asked the other one, in a hushed voice."Well, wild things," explained the elder, vaguely; "bears and animals
like that, that grow in wild places."Van Bibber lit a fresh cigarette, and settled himself comfortably and
unreservedly to listen."My, but I'd like to take a trip just once," said the youngest,
under her breath.Then she clasped her fingers together and looked up
anxiously at the elder girl, who glanced at her with severe reproach.Ain't you having a good time
'nuff without wishing for everything you set your eyes on?"Van Bibber wondered at this--why humans should want to ride around on
the swans in the first place, and why, if they had such a wild desire,
they should not gratify it."Why, it costs more'n it costs to come all the way up town in an open
car," added the elder girl, as if in answer to his unspoken question.The younger girl sighed at this, and nodded her head in submission, but
blinked longingly at the big swans and the parti- awning and the
red seats."I beg your pardon," said Van Bibber, addressing himself uneasily to
the eldest girl with long hair, "but if the little girl would like to go
around in one of those things, and--and hasn't brought the change with
her, you know, I'm sure I should be very glad if she'd allow me to send
her around."exclaimed the little girl, with a jump, and so sharply
and in such a shrill voice that Van Bibber shuddered."I'm afraid maw wouldn't like our taking money from any one we didn't
know," she said with dignity; "but if you're going anyway and want
company--"

"Oh!my, no," said Van Bibber, hurriedly.He tried to picture himself
riding around the lake behind a tin swan with three little girls from
the East Side, and a lunch basket."Then," said the head of the trio, "we can't go."There was such a look of uncomplaining acceptance of this verdict on
the part of the two little girls, that Van Bibber felt uncomfortable.He
looked to the right and to the left, and then said desperately,
"Well, come along."The young man in a blue flannel shirt, who did the
paddling, smiled at Van Bibber's riding-breeches, which were so very
loose at one end and so very tight at the other, and at his gloves
and crop.The three little girls
placed the awful lunch basket on the front seat and sat on the middle
one, and Van Bibber cowered in the back.They were hushed in silent
ecstasy when it started, and gave little gasps of pleasure when it
careened slightly in turning.It was shady under the awning, and the
motion was pleasant enough, but Van Bibber was so afraid some one would
see him that he failed to enjoy it.But as soon as they passed into the narrow straits and were shut in by
the bushes and were out of sight of the people, he relaxed, and began to
play the host.He pointed out the fishes among the rocks at the edges
of the pool, and the sparrows and robins bathing and ruffling
their feathers in the shallow water, and agreed with them about the
possibility of bears, and even tigers, in the wild part of the island,
although the glimpse of the gray helmet of a Park policeman made such a
supposition doubtful.And it really seemed as though they were enjoying it more than he
ever enjoyed a trip up the Sound on a yacht or across the ocean on a
record-breaking steamship.It seemed long enough before they got back to
Van Bibber, but his guests were evidently but barely satisfied.Still,
all the goodness in his nature would not allow him to go through that
ordeal again.He stepped out of the boat eagerly and helped out the girl with long
hair as though she had been a princess and tipped the rude young man
who had laughed at him, but who was perspiring now with the work he had
done; and then as he turned to leave the dock he came face to face with
A Girl He Knew and Her brother.Her brother said, "How're you, Van Bibber?Been taking a trip around
the world in eighty minutes?"And added in a low voice, "Introduce me to
your young lady friends from Hester Street.""Ah, how're you--quite a surprise!"gasped Van Bibber, while his late
guests stared admiringly at the pretty young lady in the riding-habit,
and utterly refused to move on."Been taking ride on the lake,"
stammered Van Bibber; "most exhilarating.Young friends of mine--these
young ladies never rode on lake, so I took 'em."Oh, yes, we saw you," said Her brother, dryly, while she only smiled at
him, but so kindly and with such perfect understanding that Van Bibber
grew red with pleasure and bought three long strings of tickets for the
swans at some absurd discount, and gave each little girl a string."There," said Her brother to the little ladies from Hester Street, "now
you can take trips for a week without stopping.Don't try to smuggle in
any laces, and don't forget to fee the smoking-room steward."The Girl He Knew said they were walking over to the stables, and that
he had better go get his other horse and join her, which was to be his
reward for taking care of the young ladies.And the three little girls
proceeded to use up the yards of tickets so industriously that they were
sunburned when they reached the tenement, and went to bed dreaming of
a big white swan, and a beautiful young gentleman in patent-leather
riding-boots and baggy breeches.VAN BIBBER'S BURGLAR


There had been a dance up town, but as Van Bibber could not find Her
there, he accepted young Travers's suggestion to go over to Jersey City
and see a "go" between "Dutchy" Mack and a <DW52> person professionally
known as the Black Diamond.They covered up all signs of their evening
dress with their great-coats, and filled their pockets with cigars, for
the smoke which surrounds a "go" is trying to sensitive nostrils, and
they also fastened their watches to both key-chains.Alf Alpin, who was
acting as master of ceremonies, was greatly pleased and flattered
at their coming, and boisterously insisted on their sitting on the
platform.The fact was generally circulated among the spectators that
the "two gents in high hats" had come in a carriage, and this and their
patent-leather boots made them objects of keen interest.It was even
whispered that they were the "parties" who were putting up the money
to back the Black Diamond against the "Hester Street Jackson."This in
itself entitled them to respect.Van Bibber was asked to hold the watch,
but he wisely declined the honor, which was given to Andy Spielman, the
sporting reporter of the _Track and Ring_, whose watch-case was covered
with diamonds, and was just the sort of a watch a timekeeper should
hold.It was two o'clock before "Dutchy" Mack's backer threw the sponge
into the air, and three before they reached the city.They had another
reporter in the cab with them besides the gentleman who had bravely
held the watch in the face of several offers to "do for" him; and as
Van Bibber was ravenously hungry, and as he doubted that he could get
anything at that hour at the club, they accepted Spielman's invitation
and went for a porterhouse steak and onions at the Owl's Nest, Gus
McGowan's all-night restaurant on Third Avenue.It was a very dingy, dirty place, but it was as warm as the engine-room
of a steamboat, and the steak was perfectly done and tender.It was
too late to go to bed, so they sat around the table, with their chairs
tipped back and their knees against its edge.The two club men had
thrown off their great-coats, and their wide shirt fronts and silk
facings shone grandly in the smoky light of the oil lamps and the
red glow from the grill in the corner.They talked about the life the
reporters led, and the Philistines asked foolish questions, which the
gentleman of the press answered without showing them how foolish they
were."And I suppose you have all sorts of curious adventures," said Van
Bibber, tentatively."Well, no, not what I would call adventures," said one of the reporters."I have never seen anything that could not be explained or attributed
directly to some known cause, such as crime or poverty or drink.You may
think at first that you have stumbled on something strange and romantic,
but it comes to nothing.You would suppose that in a great city like
this one would come across something that could not be explained away
something mysterious or out of the common, like Stevenson's Suicide
Club.Dickens once told James Payn that the
most curious thing he ever saw In his rambles around London was a ragged
man who stood crouching under the window of a great house where the
owner was giving a ball.While the man hid beneath a window on the
ground floor, a woman wonderfully dressed and very beautiful raised the
sash from the inside and dropped her bouquet down into the man's hand,
and he nodded and stuck it under his coat and ran off with it."I call that, now, a really curious thing to see.But I have never come
across anything like it, and I have been in every part of this big city,
and at every hour of the night and morning, and I am not lacking in
imagination either, but no captured maidens have ever beckoned to me
from barred windows nor 'white hands waved from a passing hansom.'Balzac and De Musset and Stevenson suggest that they have had such
adventures, but they never come to me.It is all commonplace and vulgar,
and always ends in a police court or with a 'found drowned' in the North
River."McGowan, who had fallen into a doze behind the bar, woke suddenly and
shivered and rubbed his shirt-sleeves briskly.A woman knocked at the
side door and begged for a drink "for the love of heaven," and the man
who tended the grill told her to be off.They could hear her feeling
her way against the wall and cursing as she staggered out of the alley.Three men came in with a hack driver and wanted everybody to drink
with them, and became insolent when the gentlemen declined, and were
in consequence hustled out one at a time by McGowan, who went to sleep
again immediately, with his head resting among the cigar boxes and
pyramids of glasses at the back of the bar, and snored."You see," said the reporter, "it is all like this.Night in a great
city is not picturesque and it is not theatrical.It is sodden,
sometimes brutal, exciting enough until you get used to it, but it runs
in a groove.It is dramatic, but the plot is old and the motives and
characters always the same."The rumble of heavy market wagons and the rattle of milk carts told
them that it was morning, and as they opened the door the cold fresh
air swept into the place and made them wrap their collars around
their throats and stamp their feet.The morning wind swept down the
cross-street from the East River and the lights of the street lamps and
of the saloon looked old and tawdry.Travers and the reporter went off
to a Turkish bath, and the gentleman who held the watch, and who had
been asleep for the last hour, dropped into a nighthawk and told the
man to drive home.It was almost clear now and very cold, and Van Bibber
determined to walk.He had the strange feeling one gets when one stays
up until the sun rises, of having lost a day somewhere, and the dance
he had attended a few hours before seemed to have come off long ago, and
the fight in Jersey City was far back in the past.The houses along the cross-street through which he walked were as dead
as so many blank walls, and only here and there a lace curtain waved out
of the open window where some honest citizen was sleeping.The street
was quite deserted; not even a cat or a policeman moved on it and Van
Bibber's footsteps sounded brisk on the sidewalk.There was a great
house at the corner of the avenue and the cross-street on which he was
walking.The house faced the avenue and a stone wall ran back to the
brown stone stable which opened on the side street.There was a door
in this wall, and as Van Bibber approached it on his solitary walk it
opened cautiously, and a man's head appeared in it for an instant and
was withdrawn again like a flash, and the door snapped to.Van Bibber
stopped and looked at the door and at the house and up and down the
street.The house was tightly closed, as though some one was lying
inside dead, and the streets were still empty.Van Bibber could think of nothing in his appearance so dreadful as to
frighten an honest man, so he decided the face he had had a glimpse of
must belong to a dishonest one.It was none of his business, he assured
himself, but it was curious, and he liked adventure, and he would
have liked to prove his friend the reporter, who did not believe in
adventure, in the wrong.So he approached the door silently, and jumped
and caught at the top of the wall and stuck one foot on the handle of
the door, and, with the other on the knocker, drew himself up and looked
cautiously down on the other side.He had done this so lightly that the
only noise he made was the rattle of the door-knob on which his foot had
rested, and the man inside thought that the one outside was trying to
open the door, and placed his shoulder to it and pressed against it
heavily.Van Bibber, from his perch on the top of the wall, looked down
directly on the other's head and shoulders.He could see the top of the
man's head only two feet below, and he also saw that in one hand he
held a revolver and that two bags filled with projecting articles of
different sizes lay at his feet.It did not need explanatory notes to tell Van Bibber that the man below
had robbed the big house on the corner, and that if it had not been for
his having passed when he did the burglar would have escaped with his
treasure.His first thought was that he was not a policeman, and that a
fight with a burglar was not in his line of life; and this was followed
by the thought that though the gentleman who owned the property in the
two bags was of no interest to him, he was, as a respectable member of
society, more entitled to consideration than the man with the revolver.The fact that he was now, whether he liked it or not, perched on the top
of the wall like Humpty Dumpty, and that the burglar might see him
and shoot him the next minute, had also an immediate influence on his
movements.So he balanced himself cautiously and noiselessly and dropped
upon the man's head and shoulders, bringing him down to the flagged walk
with him and under him.The revolver went off once in the struggle, but
before the burglar could know how or from where his assailant had come,
Van Bibber was standing up over him and had driven his heel down on his
hand and kicked the pistol out of his fingers.Then he stepped quickly
to where it lay and picked it up and said, "Now, if you try to get up
I'll shoot at you."He felt an unwarranted and ill-timedly humorous
inclination to add, "and I'll probably miss you," but subdued it.The
burglar, much to Van Bibber's astonishment, did not attempt to rise, but
sat up with his hands locked across his knees and said: "Shoot ahead.His teeth were set and his face desperate and bitter, and hopeless to a
degree of utter hopelessness that Van Bibber had never imagined."Go ahead," reiterated the man, doggedly, "I won't move.Van Bibber felt the pistol loosening
in his hand, and he was conscious of a strong inclination to lay it down
and ask the burglar to tell him all about it."You haven't got much heart," said Van Bibber, finally."You're a pretty
poor sort of a burglar, I should say.""I won't go back--I won't go
back there alive.I've served my time forever in that hole.If I have to
go back again--s'help me if I don't do for a keeper and die for it.But
I won't serve there no more."asked Van Bibber, gently, and greatly interested; "to
prison?"cried the man, hoarsely: "to a grave.Look at my face," he said, "and look at my hair.That ought to tell you
where I've been.With all the color gone out of my skin, and all the
life out of my legs.I couldn't hurt you if
I wanted to.I'm a skeleton and a baby, I am.And
now you're going to send me back again for another lifetime.For twenty
years, this time, into that cold, forsaken hole, and after I done my
time so well and worked so hard."Van Bibber shifted the pistol from one
hand to the other and eyed his prisoner doubtfully.he asked, seating himself on the steps
of the kitchen and holding the revolver between his knees.The sun was
driving the morning mist away, and he had forgotten the cold."I got out yesterday," said the man.Van Bibber glanced at the bags and lifted the revolver."You didn't
waste much time," he said."No," answered the man, sullenly, "no, I didn't.I knew this place and
I wanted money to get West to my folks, and the Society said I'd have to
wait until I earned it, and I couldn't wait.I haven't seen my wife
for seven years, nor my daughter.Seven years, young man; think of
that--seven years.Seven years without
seeing your wife or your child!And they're straight people, they are,"
he added, hastily."My wife moved West after I was put away and took
another name, and my girl never knew nothing about me.I was to join 'em,
and I thought I could lift enough here to get the fare, and now," he
added, dropping his face in his hands, "I've got to go back.And I had
meant to live straight after I got West,--God help me, but I did!An' I don't care whether you believe
it or not neither," he added, fiercely."I didn't say whether I believed it or not," answered Van Bibber, with
grave consideration.He eyed the man for a brief space without speaking, and the burglar
looked back at him, doggedly and defiantly, and with not the faintest
suggestion of hope in his eyes, or of appeal for mercy.Perhaps it was
because of this fact, or perhaps it was the wife and child that moved
Van Bibber, but whatever his motives were, he acted on them promptly."I
suppose, though," he said, as though speaking to himself, "that I ought
to give you up.""I'll never go back alive," said the burglar, quietly."Well, that's bad, too," said Van Bibber."Of course I don't know
whether you're lying or not, and as to your meaning to live honestly, I
very much doubt it; but I'll give you a ticket to wherever your wife is,
and I'll see you on the train.And you can get off at the next station
and rob my house to-morrow night, if you feel that way about it.Throw
those bags inside that door where the servant will see them before the
milkman does, and walk on out ahead of me, and keep your hands in your
pockets, and don't try to run.The man placed the bags inside the kitchen door; and, with a doubtful
look at his custodian, stepped out into the street, and walked, as he
was directed to do, toward the Grand Central station.Van Bibber kept
just behind him, and kept turning the question over in his mind as to
what he ought to do.He felt very guilty as he passed each policeman,
but he recovered himself when he thought of the wife and child who lived
in the West, and who were "straight."asked Van Bibber, as he stood at the ticket-office window."Helena, Montana," answered the man with, for the first time, a look of
relief.Van Bibber bought the ticket and handed it to the burglar."I
suppose you know," he said, "that you can sell that at a place down town
for half the money.""Yes, I know that," said the burglar.There was a
half-hour before the train left, and Van Bibber took his charge into the
restaurant and watched him eat everything placed before him, with his
eyes glancing all the while to the right or left.Then Van Bibber gave
him some money and told him to write to him, and shook hands with him.The man nodded eagerly and pulled off his hat as the car drew out of
the station; and Van Bibber came down town again with the shop girls and
clerks going to work, still wondering if he had done the right thing.He went to his rooms and changed his clothes, took a cold bath, and
crossed over to Delmonico's for his breakfast, and, while the waiter
laid the cloth in the cafe, glanced at the headings in one of the
papers.He scanned first with polite interest the account of the dance
on the night previous and noticed his name among those present.With
greater interest he read of the fight between "Dutchy" Mack and the
"Black Diamond," and then he read carefully how "Abe" Hubbard, alias
"Jimmie the Gent," a burglar, had broken jail in New Jersey, and had
been traced to New York.There was a description of the man, and Van
Bibber breathed quickly as he read it."The detectives have a clew of
his whereabouts," the account said; "if he is still in the city they are
confident of recapturing him.But they fear that the same friends who
helped him to break jail will probably assist him from the country or to
get out West.""They may do that," murmured Van Bibber to himself, with a smile of grim
contentment; "they probably will."Then he said to the waiter, "Oh, I don't know.Some bacon and eggs and
green things and coffee."VAN BIBBER AS BEST MAN


Young Van Bibber came up to town in June from Newport to see his lawyer
about the preparation of some papers that needed his signature.He found
the city very hot and close, and as dreary and as empty as a house that
has been shut up for some time while its usual occupants are away in the
country.As he had to wait over for an afternoon train, and as he was down town,
he decided to lunch at a French restaurant near Washington Square, where
some one had told him you could get particular things particularly well
cooked.The tables were set on a terrace with plants and flowers about
them, and covered with a tricolored awning.There were no jangling
horse-car bells nor dust to disturb him, and almost all the other tables
were unoccupied.The waiters leaned against these tables and chatted in
a French argot; and a cool breeze blew through the plants and billowed
the awning, so that, on the whole, Van Bibber was glad he had come.There was, beside himself, an old Frenchman scolding over his late
breakfast; two young artists with Van <DW18> beards, who ordered the most
remarkable things in the same French argot that the waiters spoke; and a
young lady and a young gentleman at the table next to his own.The young
man's back was toward him, and he could only see the girl when the youth
moved to one side.She was very young and very pretty, and she seemed in
a most excited state of mind from the tip of her wide-brimmed, pointed
French hat to the points of her patent-leather ties.She was strikingly
well-bred in appearance, and Van Bibber wondered why she should be
dining alone with so young a man."It wasn't my fault," he heard the youth say earnestly."How could I
know he would be out of town?Your
cousin is not the only clergyman in the city.""Of course not," said the girl, almost tearfully, "but they're not my
cousins and he is, and that would have made it so much, oh, so very much
different."Runaway couple," commented Van Bibber.Read about
'em often; never seen 'em.He bent his head over an entree, but he could not help hearing what
followed, for the young runaways were indifferent to all around them,
and though he rattled his knife and fork in a most vulgar manner, they
did not heed him nor lower their voices."Well, what are you going to do?"said the girl, severely but not
unkindly."It doesn't seem to me that you are exactly rising to the
occasion.""Well, I don't know," answered the youth, easily.Nobody we know ever comes here, and if they did they are out of
town now.You go on and eat something, and I'll get a directory and look
up a lot of clergymen's addresses, and then we can make out a list and
drive around in a cab until we find one who has not gone off on his
vacation.We ought to be able to catch the Fall River boat back at
five this afternoon; then we can go right on to Boston from Fall River
to-morrow morning and run down to Narragansett during the day.""They'll never forgive us," said the girl."Oh, well, that's all right," exclaimed the young man, cheerfully."Really, you're the most uncomfortable young person I ever ran away
with.One might think you were going to a funeral.You were willing
enough two days ago, and now you don't help me at all.he asked, and then added, "but please don't say so, even if you are.""No, not sorry, exactly," said the girl; "but, indeed, Ted, it is going
to make so much talk.If we only had a girl with us, or if you had a
best man, or if we had witnesses, as they do in England, and a parish
registry, or something of that sort; or if Cousin Harold had only been
at home to do the marrying."The young gentleman called Ted did not look, judging from the expression
of his shoulders, as if he were having a very good time.He picked at the food on his plate gloomily, and the girl took out her
handkerchief and then put it resolutely back again and smiled at him.The youth called the waiter and told him to bring a directory, and as he
turned to give the order Van Bibber recognized him and he recognized Van
Bibber.Van Bibber knew him for a very nice boy, of a very good Boston
family named Standish, and the younger of two sons.It was the elder who
was Van Bibber's particular friend.The girl saw nothing of this mutual
recognition, for she was looking with startled eyes at a hansom that had
dashed up the side street and was turning the corner."Standish," said Van Bibber, jumping up and reaching for his hat, "pay
this chap for these things, will you, and I'll get rid of your brother."Van Bibber descended the steps lighting a cigar as the elder Standish
came up them on a jump."Wait a minute; where are you
going?Why, it seems to rain Standishes to-day!First see your brother;
then I see you.Van Bibber answered these different questions to the effect that he had
seen young Standish and Mrs.Standish not a half an hour before, and
that they were just then taking a cab for Jersey City, whence they were
to depart for Chicago."The driver who brought them here, and who told me where they were, said
they could not have left this place by the time I would reach it," said
the elder brother, doubtfully."That's so," said the driver of the cab, who had listened curiously."I
brought 'em here not more'n half an hour ago.Just had time to get back
to the depot."Yes, but they have," said Van Bibber."However, if you get over to
Jersey City in time for the 2.30, you can reach Chicago almost as soon
as they do.They are going to the Palmer House, they said.""Thank you, old fellow," shouted Standish, jumping back into his hansom.Nobody objected to the
marriage, only too young, you know."Don't mention it," said Van Bibber, politely."Now, then," said that young man, as he approached the frightened couple
trembling on the terrace, "I've sent your brother off to Chicago.I
do not know why I selected Chicago as a place where one would go on a
honeymoon.But I'm not used to lying and I'm not very good at it.Now,
if you will introduce me, I'll see what can be done toward getting you
two babes out of the woods."Standish said, "Miss Cambridge, this is Mr.Cortlandt Van Bibber, of
whom you have heard my brother speak," and Miss Cambridge said she
was very glad to meet Mr.Van Bibber even under such peculiarly trying
circumstances."Now what you two want to do," said Van Bibber, addressing them as
though they were just about fifteen years old and he were at least
forty, "is to give this thing all the publicity you can."chorused the two runaways, in violent protest."You were about to make a fatal mistake.You were about to go to some unknown clergyman of an unknown parish,
who would have married you in a back room, without a certificate or
a witness, just like any eloping farmer's daughter and lightning-rod
agent.Why you were not married
respectably in church I don't know, and I do not intend to ask, but
a kind Providence has sent me to you to see that there is no talk nor
scandal, which is such bad form, and which would have got your names
into all the papers.I am going to arrange this wedding properly, and
you will kindly remain here until I send a carriage for you.Now just
rely on me entirely and eat your luncheon in peace.It's all going to
come out right--and allow me to recommend the salad, which is especially
good."Van Bibber first drove madly to the Little Church Around the Corner,
where he told the kind old rector all about it, and arranged to have
the church open and the assistant organist in her place, and a
district-messenger boy to blow the bellows, punctually at three o'clock."And now," he soliloquized, "I must get some names.It doesn't matter
much whether they happen to know the high contracting parties or not,
but they must be names that everybody knows.Whoever is in town will be
lunching at Delmonico's, and the men will be at the clubs."So he first
went to the big restaurant, where, as good luck would have it, he found
Mrs."Regy" Van Arnt and Mrs."Jack" Peabody, and the Misses Brookline,
who had run up the Sound for the day on the yacht _Minerva_ of the
Boston Yacht Club, and he told them how things were and swore them to
secrecy, and told them to bring what men they could pick up.At the club he pressed four men into service who knew everybody and whom
everybody knew, and when they protested that they had not been properly
invited and that they only knew the bride and groom by sight, he told
them that made no difference, as it was only their names he wanted.Then
he sent a messenger boy to get the biggest suit of rooms on the Fall
River boat and another one for flowers, and then he put Mrs."Regy" Van
Arnt into a cab and sent her after the bride, and, as best man, he got
into another cab and carried off the groom."I have acted either as best man or usher forty-two times now," said Van
Bibber, as they drove to the church, "and this is the first time I ever
appeared in either capacity in russia-leather shoes and a blue serge
yachting suit.But then," he added, contentedly, "you ought to see the
other fellows.One of them is in a striped flannel.""Regy" and Miss Cambridge wept a great deal on the way up town, but
the bride was smiling and happy when she walked up the aisle to meet her
prospective husband, who looked exceedingly conscious before the eyes of
the men, all of whom he knew by sight or by name, and not one of whom he
had ever met before.But they all shook hands after it was over, and
the assistant organist played the Wedding March, and one of the club men
insisted in pulling a cheerful and jerky peal on the church bell in the
absence of the janitor, and then Van Bibber hurled an old shoe and a
handful of rice--which he had thoughtfully collected from the chef at
the club--after them as they drove off to the boat."Now," said Van Bibber, with a proud sigh of relief and satisfaction, "I
will send that to the papers, and when it is printed to-morrow it will
read like one of the most orthodox and one of the smartest weddings of
the season.And yet I can't help thinking--"

"Well?""Regy," as he paused doubtfully."Well, I can't help thinking," continued Van Bibber, "of Standish's
older brother racing around Chicago with the thermometer at 102 in the
shade.I wish I had only sent him to Jersey City.It just shows," he
added, mournfully, "that when a man is not practised in lying, he should
leave it alone.""Since I had been able to appreciate her
merits, I saw in her nothing but religion, gentleness, meekness, modesty,
and a devoted attachment to her family; she sacrificed her life for them,
since nothing could persuade her to leave the King and Queen.I never can
be sufficiently grateful to her for her goodness to me, which ended only
with her life.She looked on me as her child, and I honoured and loved
her as a second mother.I was thought to be very like her in countenance,
and I feel conscious that I have something of her character.Would to God
I might imitate her virtues, and hope that I may hereafter deserve to meet
her, as well as my dear parents, in the bosom of our Creator, where I
cannot doubt that they enjoy the reward of their virtuous lives and
meritorious deaths."Madame Royale vainly begged to be allowed to rejoin her mother or her
aunt, or at least to know their fate.The municipal officers would tell
her nothing, and rudely refused her request to have a woman placed with
her."I asked nothing but what seemed indispensable, though it was often
harshly refused," she says."But I at least could keep myself clean.I
had soap and water, and carefully swept out my room every day.I had no
light, but in the long days I did not feel this privation much.I had some religious works and travels, which I had read over and over.I
had also some knitting, 'qui m'ennuyait beaucoup'."Once, she believes,
Robespierre visited her prison:

[It has been said that Robespierre vainly tried to obtain the hand of
Mademoiselle d'Orleans.It was also rumoured that Madame Royale herself
owed her life to his matrimonial ambition.]"The officers showed him great respect; the people in the Tower did not
know him, or at least would not tell me who he was.He stared insolently
at me, glanced at my books, and, after joining the municipal officers in a
search, retired."[On another occasion "three men in scarfs," who entered the Princess's
room, told her that they did not see why she should wish to be released,
as she seemed very comfortable!"It is dreadful,' I replied, 'to be
separated for more than a year from one's mother, without even hearing
what has become of her or of my aunt.'--'No, monsieur,
but the cruellest illness is that of the heart'--' We can do nothing for
you.Be patient, and submit to the justice and goodness of the French
people: I had nothing more to say."--DUCHESSE D'ANGOULEME, "Royal
Memoirs," p.When Laurent was appointed by the Convention to the charge of the young
prisoners, Madame Royale was treated with more consideration."He was
always courteous," she says; he restored her tinderbox, gave her fresh
books, and allowed her candles and as much firewood as she wanted, "which
pleased me greatly."This simple expression of relief gives a clearer
idea of what the delicate girl must have suffered than a volume of
complaints.But however hard Madame Royale's lot might be, that of the Dauphin was
infinitely harder.Though only eight years old when he entered the
Temple, he was by nature and education extremely precocious; "his memory
retained everything, and his sensitiveness comprehended everything."His
features "recalled the somewhat effeminate look of Louis XV., and the
Austrian hauteur of Maria Theresa; his blue eyes, aquiline nose, elevated
nostrils, well-defined mouth, pouting lips, chestnut hair parted in the
middle and falling in thick curls on his shoulders, resembled his mother
before her years of tears and torture.All the beauty of his race, by
both descents, seemed to reappear in him."--[Lamartine]--For some time the
care of his parents preserved his health and cheerfulness even in the
Temple; but his constitution was weakened by the fever recorded by his
sister, and his gaolers were determined that he should never regain
strength."What does the Convention intend to do with him?"asked Simon, when the
innocent victim was placed in his clutches.For such a purpose they could not have chosen their instruments better."Simon and his wife, cut off all those fair locks that had been his
youthful glory and his mother's pride.This worthy pair stripped him of
the mourning he wore for his father; and as they did so, they called it
'playing at the game of the spoiled king.'They alternately induced him
to commit excesses, and then half starved him.They beat him mercilessly;
nor was the treatment by night less brutal than that by day.As soon as
the weary boy had sunk into his first profound sleep, they would loudly
call him by name, 'Capet!Startled, nervous, bathed in
perspiration, or sometimes trembling with cold, he would spring up, rush
through the dark, and present himself at Simon's bedside, murmuring,
tremblingly, 'I am here, citizen.'--'Come nearer; let me feel you.'He
would approach the bed as he was ordered, although he knew the treatment
that awaited him.Simon would buffet him on the head, or kick him away,
adding the remark, 'Get to bed again, wolfs cub; I only wanted to know
that you were safe.'On one of these occasions, when the child had fallen
half stunned upon his own miserable couch, and lay there groaning and
faint with pain, Simon roared out with a laugh, 'Suppose you were king,
Capet, what would you do to me?'The child thought of his father's dying
words, and said, 'I would forgive you.'"--[THIERS]

The change in the young Prince's mode of life, and the cruelties and
caprices to which he was subjected, soon made him fall ill, says his
sister."Simon forced him to eat to excess, and to drink large quantities
of wine, which he detested.He grew extremely fat without
increasing in height or strength."His aunt and sister, deprived of the
pleasure of tending him, had the pain of hearing his childish voice raised
in the abominable songs his gaolers taught him.The brutality of Simon
"depraved at once the body and soul of his pupil.He called him the young
wolf of the Temple.He treated him as the young of wild animals are
treated when taken from the mother and reduced to captivity,--at once
intimidated by blows and enervated by taming.He punished for
sensibility; he rewarded meanness; he encouraged vice; he made the child
wait on him at table, sometimes striking him on the face with a knotted
towel, sometimes raising the poker and threatening to strike him with it."[Simon left the Temple to become a municipal officer.He was involved in
the overthrow of Robespierre, and guillotined the day after him, 29th
July, 1794.]Yet when Simon was removed the poor young Prince's condition became even
worse.His horrible loneliness induced an apathetic stupor to which any
suffering would have been preferable."He passed his days without any
kind of occupation; they did not allow him light in the evening.His
keepers never approached him but to give him food;" and on the rare
occasions when they took him to the platform of the Tower, he was unable
or unwilling to move about.When, in November, 1794, a commissary named
Gomin arrived at the Temple, disposed to treat the little prisoner with
kindness, it was too late."He took extreme care of my brother," says
Madame Royale."For a long time the unhappy child had been shut up in
darkness, and he was dying of fright.He was very grateful for the
attentions of Gomin, and became much attached to him."But his physical
condition was alarming, and, owing to Gomin's representations, a
commission was instituted to examine him."The commissioners appointed
were Harmond, Mathieu, and Reverchon, who visited 'Louis Charles,' as he
was now called, in the month of February, 1795.They found the young
Prince seated at a square deal table, at which he was playing with some
dirty cards, making card houses and the like,--the materials having been
furnished him, probably, that they might figure in the report as evidences
of indulgence.He did not look up from the table as the commissioners
entered.He was in a slate-coloured dress, bareheaded; the room was
reported as clean, the bed in good condition, the linen fresh; his clothes
were also reported as new; but, in spite of all these assertions, it is
well known that his bed had not been made for months, that he had not left
his room, nor was permitted to leave it, for any purpose whatever, that it
was consequently uninhabitable, and that he was covered with vermin and
with sores.The swellings at his knees alone were sufficient to disable
him from walking.One of the commissioners approached the young Prince
respectfully.Harmond in a kind voice
begged him to speak to them.The eyes of the boy remained fixed on the
table before him.They told him of the kindly intentions of the
Government, of their hopes that he would yet be happy, and their desire
that he would speak unreservedly to the medical man that was to visit him.He seemed to listen with profound attention, but not a single word passed
his lips.It was an heroic principle that impelled that poor young heart
to maintain the silence of a mute in presence of these men.He remembered
too well the days when three other commissaries waited on him, regaled him
with pastry and wine, and obtained from him that hellish accusation
against the mother that he loved.He had learnt by some means the import
of the act, so far as it was an injury to his mother.He now dreaded
seeing again three commissaries, hearing again kind words, and being
treated again with fine promises.Dumb as death itself he sat before
them, and remained motionless as stone, and as mute."[THIERS]

His disease now made rapid progress, and Gomin and Lasne, superintendents
of the Temple, thinking it necessary to inform the Government of the
melancholy condition of their prisoner, wrote on the register: "Little
Capet is unwell."No notice was taken of this account, which was renewed
next day in more urgent terms: "Little Capet is dangerously ill."Still
there was no word from beyond the walls."We must knock harder," said the
keepers to each other, and they added, "It is feared he will not live," to
the words "dangerously ill."At length, on Wednesday, 6th May, 1795,
three days after the first report, the authorities appointed M. Desault to
give the invalid the assistance of his art.After having written down his
name on the register he was admitted to see the Prince.He made a long and
very attentive examination of the unfortunate child, asked him many
questions without being able to obtain an answer, and contented himself
with prescribing a decoction of hops, to be taken by spoonfuls every
half-hour, from six o'clock in the morning till eight in the evening.On
the first day the Prince steadily refused to take it.In vain Gomin
several times drank off a glass of the potion in his presence; his example
proved as ineffectual as his words.Next day Lasne renewed his
solicitations."Monsieur knows very well that I desire nothing but the
good of his health, and he distresses me deeply by thus refusing to take
what might contribute to it.I entreat him as a favour not to give me
this cause of grief."And as Lasne, while speaking, began to taste the
potion in a glass, the child took what he offered him out of his hands."You have, then, taken an oath that I should drink it," said he, firmly;
"well, give it me, I will drink it."From that moment he conformed with
docility to whatever was required of him, but the policy of the Commune
had attained its object; help had been withheld till it was almost a
mockery to supply it.The Prince's weakness was excessive; his keepers could scarcely drag him
to the, top of the Tower; walking hurt his tender feet, and at every step
he stopped to press the arm of Lasne with both hands upon his breast.At
last he suffered so much that it was no longer possible for him to walk,
and his keeper carried him about, sometimes on the platform, and sometimes
in the little tower, where the royal family had lived at first.But the
slight improvement to his health occasioned by the change of air scarcely
compensated for the pain which his fatigue gave him.On the battlement of
the platform nearest the left turret, the rain had, by perseverance
through ages, hollowed out a kind of basin.The water that fell remained
there for several days; and as, during the spring of 1795, storms were of
frequent occurrence, this little sheet of water was kept constantly
supplied.Whenever the child was brought out upon the platform, he saw a
little troop of sparrows, which used to come to drink and bathe in this
reservoir.At first they flew away at his approach, but from being
accustomed to see him walking quietly there every day, they at last grew
more familiar, and did not spread their wings for flight till he came up
close to them.They were always the same, he knew them by sight, and
perhaps like himself they were inhabitants of that ancient pile.He
called them his birds; and his first action, when the door into the
terrace was opened, was to look towards that side,--and the sparrows were
always there.He delighted in their chirping, and he must have envied
them their wings.Though so little could be done to alleviate his sufferings, a moral
improvement was taking place in him.He was touched by the lively
interest displayed by his physician, who never failed to visit him at nine
o'clock every morning.He seemed pleased with the attention paid him, and
ended by placing entire confidence in M. Desault.Gratitude loosened his
tongue; brutality and insult had failed to extort a murmur, but kind
treatment restored his speech he had no words for anger, but he found them
to express his thanks.M. Desault prolonged his visits as long as the
officers of the municipality would permit.When they announced the close
of the visit, the child, unwilling to beg them to allow a longer time,
held back M. Desault by the skirt of his coat.Suddenly M. Desault's
visits ceased.Several days passed and nothing was heard of him.The
keepers wondered at his absence, and the poor little invalid was much
distressed at it.The commissary on duty (M. Benoist) suggested that it
would be proper to send to the physician's house to make inquiries as to
the cause of so long an absence.Gomin and Larne had not yet ventured to
follow this advice, when next day M. Benoist was relieved by M. Bidault,
who, hearing M. Desault's name mentioned as he came in, immediately said,
"You must not expect to see him any more; he died yesterday."M. Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de l'Humanite, was next
directed to attend the prisoner, and in June he found him in so alarming a
state that he at once asked for a coadjutor, fearing to undertake the
responsibility alone.The physician--sent for form's sake to attend the
dying child, as an advocate is given by law to a criminal condemned
beforehand--blamed the officers of the municipality for not having removed
the blind, which obstructed the light, and the numerous bolts, the noise
of which never failed to remind the victim of his captivity.That sound,
which always caused him an involuntary shudder, disturbed him in the last
mournful scene of his unparalleled tortures.M. Pelletan said
authoritatively to the municipal on duty, "If you will not take these
bolts and casings away at once, at least you can make no objection to our
carrying the child into another room, for I suppose we are sent here to
take charge of him."The Prince, being disturbed by these words, spoken
as they were with great animation, made a sign to the physician to come
nearer."Speak lower, I beg of you," said he; "I am afraid they will hear
you up-stairs, and I should be very sorry for them to know that I am ill,
as it would give them much uneasiness."At first the change to a cheerful and airy room revived the Prince and
gave him evident pleasure, but the improvement did not last.Next day M.
Pelletan learned that the Government had acceded to his request for a
colleague.M. Dumangin, head physician of the Hospice de l'Unite, made
his appearance at his house on the morning of Sunday, 7th June, with the
official despatch sent him by the committee of public safety.They
repaired together immediately to the Tower.On their arrival they heard
that the child, whose weakness was excessive, had had a fainting fit,
which had occasioned fears to be entertained that his end was approaching.He had revived a little, however, when the physicians went up at about
nine o'clock.Unable to contend with increasing exhaustion, they
perceived there was no longer any hope of prolonging an existence worn out
by so much suffering, and that all their art could effect would be to
soften the last stage of this lamentable disease.While standing by the
Prince's bed, Gomin noticed that he was quietly crying, and asked him."My dear
mother remains in the other tower."Night came,--his last night,--which
the regulations of the prison condemned him to pass once more in solitude,
with suffering, his old companion, only at his side.This time, however,
death, too, stood at his pillow.When Gomin went up to the child's room
on the morning of 8th June, he said, seeing him calm, motionless, and
mute:

"I hope you are not in pain just now?""Oh, yes, I am still in pain, but not nearly so much,--the music is so
beautiful!"Now there was no music to be heard, either in the Tower or anywhere near.Gomin, astonished, said to him, "From what direction do you hear this
music?"And the
child, with a nervous motion, raised his faltering hand, as he opened his
large eyes illuminated by delight.His poor keeper, unwilling to destroy
this last sweet illusion, appeared to listen also.After a few minutes of attention the child again started, and cried out,
in intense rapture, "Amongst all the voices I have distinguished that of
my mother!"At a quarter past two he died, Lasne
only being in the room at the time.Lasne acquainted Gomin and Damont,
the commissary on duty, with the event, and they repaired to the chamber
of death.The poor little royal corpse was carried from the room into
that where he had suffered so long,--where for two years he had never
ceased to suffer.From this apartment the father had gone to the
scaffold, and thence the son must pass to the burial-ground.The remains
were laid out on the bed, and the doors of the apartment were set
open,--doors which had remained closed ever since the Revolution had
seized on a child, then full of vigour and grace and life and health!At eight o'clock next morning (9th June) four members of the committee of
general safety came to the Tower to make sure that the Prince was really
dead.When they were admitted to the death-chamber by Lasne and Damont
they affected the greatest indifference."The event is not of the least
importance," they repeated, several times over; "the police commissary of
the section will come and receive the declaration of the decease; he will
acknowledge it, and proceed to the interment without any ceremony; and the
committee will give the necessary directions."As they withdrew, some
officers of the Temple guard asked to see the remains of little Capet.Damont having observed that the guard would not permit the bier to pass
without its being opened, the deputies decided that the officers and
non-commissioned officers of the guard going off duty, together with those
coming on, should be all invited to assure themselves of the child's
death.All having assembled in the room where the body lay, he asked them
if they recognised it as that of the ex-Dauphin, son of the last King of
France.Those who had seen the young Prince at the Tuileries, or at the
Temple (and most of them had), bore witness to its being the body of Louis
XVII.When they were come down into the council-room, Darlot drew up the
minutes of this attestation, which was signed by a score of persons.These minutes were inserted in the journal of the Temple tower, which was
afterwards deposited in the office of the Minister of the Interior.During this visit the surgeons entrusted with the autopsy arrived at the
outer gate of the Temple.These were Dumangin, head physician of the
Hospice de l'Unite; Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de
l'Humanite; Jeanroy, professor in the medical schools of Paris; and
Laasus, professor of legal medicine at the Ecole de Sante of Paris.The
last two were selected by Dumangin and Pelletan because of the former
connection of M. Lassus with Mesdames de France, and of M. Jeanroy with
the House of Lorraine, which gave a peculiar weight to their signatures.Gomin received them in the council-room, and detained them until the
National Guard, descending from the second floor, entered to sign the
minutes prepared by Darlot.This done, Lasne, Darlot, and Bouquet went up
again with the surgeons, and introduced them into the apartment of Louis
XVII., whom they at first examined as he lay on his death-bed; but M.
Jeanroy observing that the dim light of this room was but little
favourable to the accomplishment of their mission, the commissaries
prepared a table in the first room, near the window, on which the corpse
was laid, and the surgeons began their melancholy operation.At seven o'clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up,
and that they should proceed to the cemetery.It was the season of the
longest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy
and at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took
place in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before
the gates of the Temple palace.One of the municipals wished to have the
coffin carried out secretly by the door opening into the chapel enclosure;
but M. Duaser, police commiasary, who was specially entrusted with the
arrangement of the ceremony, opposed this indecorous measure, and the
procession passed out through the great gate.The crowd that was pressing
round was kept back, and compelled to keep a line, by a tricoloured
ribbon, held at short distances by gendarmes.Compassion and sorrow were
impressed on every countenance.A small detachment of the troops of the line from the garrison of Paris,
sent by the authorities, was waiting to serve as an escort.The bier,
still covered with the pall, was carried on a litter on the shoulders of
four men, who relieved each other two at a time; it was preceded by six or
eight men, headed by a sergeant.The procession was accompanied a long
way by the crowd, and a great number of persona followed it even to the
cemetery.The name of "Little Capet," and the more popular title of
Dauphin, spread from lip to lip, with exclamations of pity and compassion.Marguerite, not by the church, as
some accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery.The interment
was made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight or nine feet
from the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a small house,
which subsequently served as a school.The grave was filled up,--no mound
marked its place, and not even a trace remained of the interment!Not
till then did the commissaries of police and the municipality withdraw,
and enter the house opposite the church to draw up the declaration of
interment.It was nearly nine o'clock, and still daylight.Release of Madame Royale.--Her Marriage to the Duc d'Angouleme.The last person to hear of the sad events in the Temple was the one for
whom they had the deepest and most painful interest.After her brother's
death the captivity of Madame Royale was much lightened.She was allowed
to walk in the Temple gardens, and to receive visits from some ladies of
the old Court, and from Madame de Chantereine, who at last, after several
times evading her questions, ventured cautiously to tell her of the deaths
of her mother, aunt, and brother.Madame Royale wept bitterly, but had
much difficulty in expressing her feelings."She spoke so confusedly,"
says Madame de la Ramiere in a letter to Madame de Verneuil, "that it was
difficult to understand her.It took her more than a month's reading
aloud, with careful study of pronunciation, to make herself
intelligible,--so much had she lost the power of expression."She was
dressed with plainness amounting to poverty, and her hands were disfigured
by exposure to cold and by the menial work she had been so long accustomed
to do for herself, and which it was difficult to persuade her to leave
off.When urged to accept the services of an attendant, she replied, with
a sad prevision of the vicissitudes of her future life, that she did not
like to form a habit which she might have again to abandon.She suffered
herself, however, to be persuaded gradually to modify her recluse and
ascetic habits.It was well she did so, as a preparation for the great
changes about to follow.Nine days after the death of her brother, the city of Orleans interceded
for the daughter of Louis XVI., and sent deputies to the Convention to
pray for her deliverance and restoration to her family.Names followed
this example; and Charette, on the part of the Vendeans, demanded, as a
condition of the pacification of La Vendee, that the Princess should be
allowed to join her relations.At length the Convention decreed that
Madame Royale should be exchanged with Austria for the representatives and
ministers whom Dumouriez had given up to the Prince of Cobourg,--Drouet,
Semonville, Maret, and other prisoners of importance.At midnight on 19th
December, 1795, which was her birthday, the Princess was released from
prison, the Minister of the Interior, M. Benezech, to avoid attracting
public attention and possible disturbance, conducting her on foot from the
Temple to a neighbouring street, where his carriage awaited her.She made
it her particular request that Gomin, who had been so devoted to her
brother, should be the commissary appointed to accompany her to the
frontier; Madame de Soucy, formerly under-governess to the children of
France, was also in attendance; and the Princess took with her a dog named
Coco, which had belonged to Louis XVI.[The mention of the little dog taken from the Temple by Madame Royale
reminds me how fond all the family were of these creatures.Mesdames had beautiful spaniels; little grayhounds
were preferred by Madame Elisabeth.was the only one of all his
family who had no dogs in his room.I remember one day waiting in the
great gallery for the King's retiring, when he entered with all his family
and the whole pack, who were escorting him.All at once all the dogs
began to bark, one louder than another, and ran away, passing like ghosts
along those great dark rooms, which rang with their hoarse cries.The
Princesses shouting, calling them, running everywhere after them,
completed a ridiculous spectacle, which made those august persons very
merry.--D'HEZECQUES, p.She was frequently recognised on her way through France, and always with
marks of pleasure and respect.It might have been supposed that the Princess would rejoice to leave
behind her the country which had been the scene of so many horrors and
such bitter suffering.But it was her birthplace, and it held the graves
of all she loved; and as she crossed the frontier she said to those around
her, "I leave France with regret, for I shall never cease to consider it
my country."She arrived in Vienna on 9th January, 1796, and her first
care was to attend a memorial service for her murdered relatives.After
many weeks of close retirement she occasionally began to appear in public,
and people looked with interest at the pale, grave, slender girl of
seventeen, dressed in the deepest mourning, over whose young head such
terrible storms had swept.The Emperor wished her to marry the Archduke
Charles of Austria, but her father and mother had, even in the cradle,
destined her hand for her cousin, the Duc d'Angouleme, son of the Comte
d'Artois, and the memory of their lightest wish was law to her.Her quiet determination entailed anger and opposition amounting to
persecution.Every effort was made to alienate her from her French
relations.She was urged to claim Provence, which had become her own if
Louis XVIII.A pressure of opinion
was brought to bear upon her which might well have overawed so young a
girl."I was sent for to the Emperor's cabinet," she writes, "where I
found the imperial family assembled.The ministers and chief imperial
counsellors were also present.When the Emperor invited me to
express my opinion, I answered that to be able to treat fittingly of such
interests I thought, I ought to be surrounded not only by my mother's
relatives, but also by those of my father.Besides, I said, I
was above all things French, and in entire subjection to the laws of
France, which had rendered me alternately the subject of the King my
father, the King my brother, and the King my uncle, and that I would yield
obedience to the latter, whatever might be his commands.This declaration
appeared very much to dissatisfy all who were present, and when they
observed that I was not to be shaken, they declared that my right being
independent of my will, my resistance would not be the slightest obstacle
to the measures they might deem it necessary to adopt for the preservation
of my interests."In their anxiety to make a German princess of Marie Therese, her imperial
relations suppressed her French title as much as possible.When, with
some difficulty, the Duc de Grammont succeeded in obtaining an audience of
her, and used the familiar form of address, she smiled faintly, and bade
him beware."Call me Madame de Bretagne, or de Bourgogne, or de
Lorraine," she said, "for here I am so identified with these
provinces--[which the Emperor wished her to claim from her uncle Louis
XVIII.]--that I shall end in believing in my own transformation."After
these discussions she was so closely watched, and so many restraints were
imposed upon her, that she was scarcely less a prisoner than in the old
days of the Temple, though her cage was this time gilded.Rescue,
however, was at hand.accepted a refuge offered to him at Mittau by the
Czar Paul, who had promised that he would grant his guest's first request,
whatever it might be.Louis begged the Czar to use his influence with the
Court of Vienna to allow his niece to join him."Monsieur, my brother,"
was Paul's answer, "Madame Royale shall be restored to you, or I shall
cease to be Paul I."Next morning the Czar despatched a courier to Vienna
with a demand for the Princess, so energetically worded that refusal must
have been followed by war.Accordingly, in May, 1799, Madame Royale was
allowed to leave the capital which she had found so uncongenial an asylum.In the old ducal castle of Mittau, the capital of Courland, Louis XVIII.and his wife, with their nephews, the Ducs d'Angouleme

[The Duc d'Angonleme was quiet and reserved.He loved hunting as means of
killing time; was given to early hours and innocent pleasures.He was a
gentleman, and brave as became one.He had not the "gentlemanly vices" of
his brother, and was all the better for it.He was ill educated, but had
natural good sense, and would have passed for having more than that had he
cared to put forth pretensions.Of all his family he was the one most ill
spoken of, and least deserving of it.--DOCTOR DORAN.]and de Berri, were awaiting her, attended by the Abbe Edgeworth, as chief
ecclesiastic, and a little Court of refugee nobles and officers.With
them were two men of humbler position, who must have been even more
welcome to Madame Royale,--De Malden, who had acted as courier to Louis
XVI.during the flight to Varennes, and Turgi, who had waited on the
Princesses in the Temple.It was a sad meeting, though so long anxiously
desired, and it was followed on 10th June, 1799, by an equally sad
wedding,--exiles, pensioners on the bounty of the Russian monarch,
fulfilling an engagement founded, not on personal preference, but on
family policy and reverence for the wishes of the dead, the bride and
bridegroom had small cause for rejoicing.During the eighteen months of
tranquil seclusion which followed her marriage, the favourite occupation
of the Duchess was visiting and relieving the poor.In January, 1801, the
Czar Paul, in compliance with the demand of Napoleon, who was just then
the object of his capricious enthusiasm, ordered the French royal family
to leave Mittau.Their wanderings commenced on the 21st, a day of bitter
memories; and the young Duchess led the King to his carriage through a
crowd of men, women, and children, whose tears and blessings attended them
on their way.The Duc d'Angouleme took another route
to join a body of French gentlemen in arms for the Legitimist cause.]The exiles asked permission from the King of Prussia to settle in his
dominions, and while awaiting his answer at Munich they were painfully
surprised by the entrance of five old soldiers of noble birth, part of the
body-guard they had left behind at Mittau, relying on the protection of
Paul.The "mad Czar" had decreed their immediate expulsion, and,
penniless and almost starving, they made their way to Louis XVIII.All
the money the royal family possessed was bestowed on these faithful
servants, who came to them in detachments for relief, and then the Duchess
offered her diamonds to the Danish consul for an advance of two thousand
ducats, saying she pledged her property "that in our common distress it
may be rendered of real use to my uncle, his faithful servants, and
myself."The Duchess's consistent and unselfish kindness procured her
from the King, and those about him who knew her best, the name of "our
angel."Warsaw was for a brief time the resting-place of the wanderers, but there
they were disturbed in 1803 by Napoleon's attempt to threaten and bribe
Louis XVIII.It was suggested that refusal might bring
upon them expulsion from Prussia."We are accustomed to suffering," was
the King's answer, "and we do not dread poverty.I would, trusting in
God, seek another asylum."In 1808, after many changes of scene, this
asylum was sought in England, Gosfield Hall, Essex, being placed at their
disposal by the Marquis of Buckingham.From Gosfield, the King moved to
Hartwell Hall, a fine old Elizabethan mansion rented from Sir George Lee
for L 500 a year.A yearly grant of L 24,000 was made to the exiled
family by the British Government, out of which a hundred and forty persons
were supported, the royal dinner-party generally numbering two dozen.At Hartwell, as in her other homes, the Duchess was most popular amongst
the poor.In general society she was cold and reserved, and she disliked
the notice of strangers.In March, 1814, the royalist successes at
Bordeaux paved the way for the restoration of royalty in France, and
amidst general sympathy and congratulation, with the Prince Regent himself
to wish them good fortune, the King, the Duchess, and their suite left
Hartwell in April, 1814.The return to France was as triumphant as a
somewhat half-hearted and doubtful enthusiasm could make it, and most of
such cordiality as there was fell to the share of the Duchess.As she
passed to Notre-Dame in May, 1814, on entering Paris, she was vociferously
greeted.The feeling of loyalty, however, was not much longer-lived than
the applause by which it was expressed; the Duchess had scarcely effected
one of the strongest wishes of her heart,--the identification of what
remained of her parents' bodies, and the magnificent ceremony with which
they were removed from the cemetery of the Madeleine to the Abbey of St.Denis,--when the escape of Napoleon from Elba in February,1815, scattered
the royal family and their followers like chaff before the wind.The Duc
d'Angouleme, compelled to capitulate at Toulouse, sailed from Cette in a
Swedish vessel.The Comte d'Artois, the Duc de Berri, and the Prince de
Conde withdrew beyond the frontier.The
Duchesse d'Angouleme, then at Bordeaux celebrating the anniversary of the
Proclamation of Louis XVIII., alone of all her family made any stand
against the general panic.Day after day she mounted her horse and
reviewed the National Guard.She made personal and even passionate
appeals to the officers and men, standing firm, and prevailing on a
handful of soldiers to remain by her, even when the imperialist troops
were on the other side of the river and their cannon were directed against
the square where the Duchess was reviewing her scanty followers.["It was the Duchesse d'Angouleme who saved you," said the gallant General
Clauzel, after these events, to a royalist volunteer; "I could not bring
myself to order such a woman to be fired upon, at the moment when she was
providing material for the noblest page in her history."--"Fillia
Dolorosa," vol.With pain and difficulty she was convinced that resistance was vain;
Napoleon's banner soon floated over Bordeaux; the Duchess issued a
farewell proclamation to her "brave Bordelais," and on the 1st April,
1815, she started for Pouillac, whence she embarked for Spain.During a
brief visit to England she heard that the reign of a hundred days was
over, and the 27th of July, 1815, saw her second triumphal return to the
Tuileries.She did not take up her abode there with any wish for State
ceremonies or Court gaieties.Her life was as secluded as her position
would allow.Her favourite retreat was the Pavilion, which had been
inhabited by her mother, and in her little oratory she collected relics of
her family, over which on the anniversaries of their deaths she wept and
prayed.In her daily drives through Paris she scrupulously avoided the
spot on which they had suffered; and the memory of the past seemed to rule
all her sad and self-denying life, both in what she did and what she
refrained from doing.[She was so methodical and economical, though liberal in her charities,
that one of her regular evening occupations was to tear off the seals from
the letters she had received during the day, in order that the wax might
be melted down and sold; the produce made one poor family "passing rich
with forty pounds a year."--See "Filia Dolorosa," vol.Her somewhat austere goodness was not of a nature to make her popular.The
few who really understood her loved her, but the majority of her
pleasure-seeking subjects regarded her either with ridicule or dread.She
is said to have taken no part in politics, and to have exerted no
influence in public affairs, but her sympathies were well known, and "the
very word liberty made her shudder;" like Madame Roland, she had seen "so
many crimes perpetrated under that name."The claims of three pretended Dauphins--Hervagault, the son of the tailor
of St.Lo; Bruneau, son of the shoemaker of Vergin; and Naundorf or
Norndorff, the watchmaker somewhat troubled her peace, but never for a
moment obtained her sanction.Of the many other pseudo-Dauphins (said to
number a dozen and a half) not even the names remain.In February,1820, a
fresh tragedy befell the royal family in the assassination of the Duc de
Berri, brother-in-law of the Duchesse d'Angouleme, as he was seeing his
wife into her carriage at the door of the Opera-house.He was carried
into the theatre, and there the dying Prince and his wife were joined by
the Duchess, who remained till he breathed his last, and was present when
he, too, was laid in the Abbey of St.She was present also when
his son, the Duc de Bordeaux, was born, and hoped that she saw in him a
guarantee for the stability of royalty in France.In September, 1824, she
stood by the death-bed of Louis XVIII., and thenceforward her chief
occupation was directing the education of the little Duc de Bordeaux, who
generally resided with her at Villeneuve l'Etang, her country house near
St.Thence she went in July, 1830, to the Baths of Vichy,
stopping at Dijon on her way to Paris, and visiting the theatre on the
evening of the 27th.She was received with "a roar of execrations and
seditious cries," and knew only too well what they signified.She
instantly left the theatre and proceeded to Tonnere, where she received
news of the rising in Paris, and, quitting the town by night, was driven
to Joigny with three attendants.Soon after leaving that place it was
thought more prudent that the party should separate and proceed on foot,
and the Duchess and M. de Foucigny, disguised as peasants, entered
Versailles arm-in-arm, to obtain tidings of the King.The Duchess found
him at Rambouillet with her husband, the Dauphin, and the King met her
with a request for "pardon," being fully conscious, too late, that his
unwise decrees and his headlong flight had destroyed the last hopes of his
family.The act of abdication followed, by which the prospect of royalty
passed from the Dauphin and his wife, as well as from Charles X.--Henri V.
being proclaimed King, and the Duc d'Orleans (who refused to take the boy
monarch under his personal protection) lieutenant-general of the kingdom.Then began the Duchess's third expatriation.At Cherbourg the royal
family, accompanied by the little King without a kingdom, embarked in the
'Great Britain', which stood out to sea.The Duchess, remaining on deck
for a last look at the coast of France, noticed a brig which kept, she
thought, suspiciously near them."To fire into and sink the vessels in which we sail, should any attempt be
made to return to France."Such was the farewell of their subjects to the House of Bourbon.The
fugitives landed at Weymouth; the Duchesse d'Angouleme under the title of
Comtesse de Marne, the Duchesse de Berri as Comtesse de Rosny, and her
son, Henri de Bordeaux, as Comte de Chambord, the title he retained till
his death, originally taken from the estate presented to him in infancy by
his enthusiastic people.Holyrood, with its royal and gloomy
associations, was their appointed dwelling.The Duc and Duchesse
d'Angouleme, and the daughter of the Duc de Berri, travelled thither by
land, the King and the young Comte de Chambord by sea."I prefer my route
to that of my sister," observed the latter, "because I shall see the coast
of France again, and she will not."The French Government soon complained that at Holyrood the exiles were
still too near their native land, and accordingly, in 1832, Charles X.,
with his son and grandson, left Scotland for Hamburg, while the Duchesse
d'Angouleme and her niece repaired to Vienna.The family were reunited at
Prague in 1833, where the birthday of the Comte de Chambord was celebrated
with some pomp and rejoicing, many Legitimists flocking thither to
congratulate him on attaining the age of thirteen, which the old law of
monarchical France had fixed as the majority of her princes.Three years
later the wanderings of the unfortunate family recommenced; the Emperor
Francis II.was dead, and his successor, Ferdinand, must visit Prague to
be crowned, and Charles X. feared that the presence of a discrowned
monarch might be embarrassing on such an occasion.Illness and sorrow
attended the exiles on their new journey, and a few months after they were
established in the Chateau of Graffenburg at Goritz, Charles X. died of
cholera, in his eightieth year.At Goritz, also, on the 31st May, 1844,
the Duchesse d'Angouleme, who had sat beside so many death-beds, watched
over that of her husband.Theirs had not been a marriage of affection in
youth, but they respected each other's virtues, and to a great extent
shared each other's tastes; banishment and suffering had united them very
closely, and of late years they had been almost inseparable,--walking,
riding, and reading together.When the Duchesse d'Angouleme had seen her
husband laid by his father's side in the vault of the Franciscan convent,
she, accompanied by her nephew and niece, removed to Frohsdorf, where they
spent seven tranquil years.Here she was addressed as "Queen" by her
household for the first time in her life, but she herself always
recognised Henri, Comte de Chambord, as her sovereign.The Duchess lived
to see the overthrow of Louis Philippe, the usurper of the inheritance of
her family.Her last attempt to exert herself was a characteristic one.She tried to rise from a sick-bed in order to attend the memorial service
held for her mother, Marie Antoinette, on the 16th October, the
anniversary of her execution.But her strength was not equal to the task;
on the 19th she expired, with her hand in that of the Comte de Chambord,
and on 28th October, 1851, Marie Therese Charlotte, Duchesse d'Angouleme,
was buried in the Franciscan convent."In the spring of 1814 a ceremony took place in Paris at which I was
present because there was nothing in it that could be mortifying to a
French heart.had long been admitted to be one of
the most serious misfortunes of the Revolution.The Emperor Napoleon
never spoke of that sovereign but in terms of the highest respect, and
always prefixed the epithet unfortunate to his name.The ceremony to
which I allude was proposed by the Emperor of Russia and the King of
Prussia.It consisted of a kind of expiation and purification of the spot
on which Louis XVI.I went to see the
ceremony, and I had a place at a window in the Hotel of Madame de Remusat,
next to the Hotel de Crillon, and what was termed the Hotel de Courlande."The expiation took place on the 10th of April.The weather was extremely
fine and warm for the season.The Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia,
accompanied by Prince Schwartzenberg, took their station at the entrance
of the Rue Royale; the King of Prussia being on the right of the Emperor
Alexander, and Prince Schwartzenberg on his left.There was a long
parade, during which the Russian, Prussian and Austrian military bands
vied with each other in playing the air, 'Vive Henri IV.!'The cavalry
defiled past, and then withdrew into the Champs Elysees; but the infantry
ranged themselves round an altar which was raised in the middle of the
Place, and which was elevated on a platform having twelve or fifteen
steps.The Emperor of Russia alighted from his horse, and, followed by
the King of Prussia, the Grand Duke Constantine, Lord Cathcart, and Prince
Schwartzenberg, advanced to the altar.When the Emperor had nearly
reached the altar the "Te Deum" commenced.At the moment of the
benediction, the sovereigns and persons who accompanied them, as well as
the twenty-five thousand troops who covered the Place, all knelt down.The Greek priest presented the cross to the Emperor Alexander, who kissed
it; his example was followed by the individuals who accompanied him,
though they were not of the Greek faith.On rising, the Grand Duke
Constantine took off his hat, and immediately salvoes of artillery were
heard."The following titles have the signification given below during the period
covered by this work:

never see it.I never fight in the presence of others, sir."As the major spoke these words a heavy footstep was heard on the stairs.cried the major, springing to his feet."I do not ask you for your gold,
       Nor for an old straw hat--
     I simply ask that I be told
       Oh what, oh what is that?""It is a footstep on the stairs," said Jimmieboy.moaned the major "If it is Fortyforefoot all is
over for us."I was afraid he could not wait,
       The miserable sinner,
     To serve me up in proper state
       At his to-morrow's dinner.Alas, he comes I greatly fear
       In search of Major Me, sir,
     And that he'll wash me down with beer
       This very night at tea, sir.""Oh, why did I come here--why----"

"I shall!"roared a voice out in the passage-way."You shall not," roared another voice, which Jimmieboy was delighted to
recognize as Bludgeonhead's."I am hungry," said the first voice, "and what is mine is my own to do
with as I please."I will toss you into the air, my dear Fortyforefoot," returned
Bludgeonhead's voice, "if you advance another step; and with such force,
sir, that you will never come down again."Stand aside," roared the voice of
Fortyforefoot.The two prisoners in the pantry heard a tremendous scuffling, a crash,
and a loud laugh.Then Bludgeonhead's voice was heard again."Good-by, Fortyforefoot," it cried."I hope he is not going to leave us," whispered Jimmieboy, but the major
was too frightened to speak, and he trembled so that half a dozen times
he fell off the ice-cake that he had been sitting on."Give my love to the moon when you pass her, and when you get up into
the milky way turn half a million of the stars there into baked apples
and throw 'em down to me," called Bludgeonhead's voice."If you'll only lasso me and pull me back I'll do anything you want me
to," came the voice of Fortyforefoot from some tremendous height, it
seemed to Jimmieboy."Not if I know it," replied Bludgeonhead, with a laugh."I think I'd
like to settle down here myself as the owner of Fortyforefoot Valley.Whatever answer was made to this it was too indistinct for Jimmieboy to
hear, and in a minute the key of the pantry door was turned, the door
thrown open, and Bludgeonhead stood before them."You are free," he said, grasping Jimmieboy's hand and squeezing it
affectionately."But I had to get rid of him.It was the only way to do
it."And did you really throw him off into the air?"asked Jimmieboy, as he
walked out into the hall.ejaculated Jimmieboy, as he glanced upward and saw a huge rent in
the ceiling, through which, gradually rising and getting smaller and
smaller the further he rose, was to be seen the unfortunate
Fortyforefoot."I simply picked him up and tossed him over
my head.I shall turn myself into Fortyforefoot
and settle down here forever, only instead of being a bad giant I shall
be a good one--but hallo!The major had crawled out of the ice-chest and was now trying to appear
calm, although his terrible fright still left him trembling so that he
could hardly speak."It is Major Blueface," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."He was Fortyforefoot's other prisoner.""N--nun--not at--t--at--at all," stammered the major."I
def--fuf--feated him in sus--single combat.""But what are you trembling so for now?""I--I am--m not tut--trembling," retorted the major."I--I am o--only
sh--shivering with--th--the--c--c--c--cold.I--I--I've bub--been in
th--that i--i--i--ice bu--box sus--so long."Jimmieboy and Bludgeonhead roared with laughter at this.Then giving the
major a warm coat to put on they sent him up stairs to lie down and
recover his nerves.After the major had been attended to, Bludgeonhead changed himself back
into the sprite again, and he and Jimmieboy sauntered in and out among
the gardens for an hour or more and were about returning to the castle
for supper when they heard sounds of music.There was evidently a brass
band coming up the road.In an instant they hid themselves behind a
tree, from which place of concealment they were delighted two or three
minutes later to perceive that the band was none other than that of the
"Jimmieboy Guards," and that behind it, in splendid military form,
appeared Colonel Zinc followed by the tin soldiers themselves.cried Jimmieboy, throwing his cap into the air.shrieked the colonel, waving his sword with delight, and
commanding his regiment to halt, as he caught sight of Jimmieboy.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD COMES TO THE RESCUE.[Blank Page]

"Us likewise!"cheered the soldiers: following which came a trembling
voice from one of the castle windows which said:

    "I also wish to add my cheer
       Upon this happy day;
     And if you'll kindly come up here
       You'll hear me cry 'Hooray.'""No," said the sprite, motioning to Jimmieboy not to betray the major."Only a little worn-out by the fight we have had with Fortyforefoot.""Yes," said the sprite, modestly."We three have got rid of him at
last.""Do you know who
Fortyforefoot really was?"asked Jimmieboy, his curiosity aroused."The Parallelopipedon himself," said the colonel."We found that out
last night, and fearing that he might have captured our general and our
major we came here to besiege him in his castle and rescue our
officers.""But I don't see how Fortyforefoot could have been the
Parallelopipedon," said Jimmieboy."What would he want to be him for,
when, all he had to do to get anything he wanted was to take sand and
turn it into it?""Ah, but don't you see," explained the colonel, "there was one thing he
never could do as Fortyforefoot.The law prevented him from leaving this
valley here in any other form than that of the Parallelopipedon.He
didn't mind his confinement to the valley very much at first, but after
a while he began to feel cooped up here, and then he took an old packing
box and made it look as much like a living Parallelopipedon as he could.Then he got into it whenever he wanted to roam about the world.Probably
if you will search the castle you will find the cast-off shell he used
to wear, and if you do I hope you will destroy it, because it is said to
be a most horrible spectacle--frightening animals to death and causing
every flower within a mile to wither and shrink up at the mere sight of
it.""It's all true, Jimmieboy," said the sprite.Why,
he only gave us those cherries and peaches there in exchange for
yourself because he expected to get them all back again, you know.""It was a glorious victory," said the colonel."I will now announce it
to the soldiers."This he did and the soldiers were wild with joy when they heard the
news, and the band played a hymn of victory in which the soldiers
joined, singing so vigorously that they nearly cracked their voices.When they had quite finished the colonel said he guessed it was time to
return to the barracks in the nursery."Not before the feast," said the sprite."We have here all the
provisions the general set out to get, and before you return home,
colonel, you and your men should divide them among you."So the table was spread and all went happily.In the midst of the feast
the major appeared, determination written upon every line of his face.The soldiers cheered him loudly as he walked down the length of the
table, which he acknowledged as gracefully as he could with a stiff bow,
and then he spoke:

"Gentlemen," he said, "I have always been a good deal of a favorite with
you, and I know that what I am about to do will fill you with deep
grief.I am going to stop being a man of war.The tremendous victory we
have won to-day is the result entirely of the efforts of myself, General
Jimmieboy and Major Sprite--for to the latter I now give the title I
have borne so honorably for so many years.Our present victory is one of
such brilliantly brilliant brilliance that I feel that I may now retire
with lustre enough attached to my name to last for millions and millions
of years.I need rest, and here I shall take it, in this beautiful
valley, which by virtue of our victory belongs wholly and in equal parts
to General Jimmieboy, Major Sprite and myself.Hereafter I shall be
known only as Mortimer Carraway Blueface, Poet Laureate of Fortyforefoot
Hall, Fortyforefoot Valley, Pictureland.As Governor-General of the
country we have decided to appoint our illustrious friend, Major
Benjamin Bludgeonhead Sprite.General Jimmieboy will remain commander of
the forces, and the rest of you may divide amongst yourselves, as a
reward for your gallant services, all the provisions that may now be
left upon this table.That
is that you do not take the table.It is of solid mahogany and must be
worth a very considerable sum.Now let the saddest word be said,
    Now bend in sorrow deep the head.Let tears flow forth and drench the dell:
    Farewell, brave soldier boys, farewell."Here the major wiped his eyes sadly and sat down by the sprite who shook
his hand kindly and thanked him for giving him his title of major."We'll have fine times living here together," said the sprite."I'm going to see if I can't have
myself made over again, too, Spritey.I'll be pleasanter for you to look
at.What's the use of being a tin soldier in a place where even the
cobblestones are of gold and silver.""You can be plated any how," said Jimmieboy."Yes, and maybe I can have a platinum sword put in, and a real solid
gold head--but just at present that isn't what I want," said the major."What I am after now is a piece of birthday cake with real fruit raisins
in it and strips of citron two inches long, the whole concealed beneath
a one inch frosting."I don't think we have any here," said Jimmieboy, who was much pleased
to see the sprite and the major, both of whom he dearly loved, on such
good terms."But I'll run home and see if I can get some.""Well, we'll all go with you," said the colonel, starting up and
ordering the trumpeters to sound the call to arms."All except Blueface and myself," said the sprite."We will stay here
and put everything in readiness for your return.""That is a good idea," said Jimmieboy."And you'll have to hurry for we
shall be back very soon."This, as it turned out, was a very rash promise for Jimmieboy to make,
for after he and the tin soldiers had got the birthday cake and were
ready to enter Pictureland once more, they found that not one of them
could do it, the frame was so high up and the picture itself so hard
and impenetrable.Jimmieboy felt so badly to be unable to return to his
friends, that, following the major's hint about sleep bringing
forgetfulness of trouble, he threw himself down on the nursery couch,
and closing his brimming eyes dozed off into a dreamless sleep.It was quite dark when he opened them again and found himself still on
the couch with a piece of his papa's birthday cake in his hand, his
sorrows all gone and contentment in their place.His papa was sitting at
his side, and his mamma was standing over by the window smiling."You've had a good long nap, Jimmieboy," said she, "and I rather think,
from several things I've heard you say in your sleep, you've been
dreaming about your tin soldiers.""I don't believe it was a dream, mamma," he said, "it was all too real."And then he told his papa all that had happened."Well, it is very singular," said his papa, when Jimmieboy had finished,
"and if you want to believe it all happened you may; but you say all the
soldiers came back with you except Major Blueface?""Yes, every one," said Jimmieboy."Then we can tell whether it was true or not by looking in the tin
soldier's box.If the major isn't there he may be up in Fortyforefoot
castle as you say."Jimmieboy climbed eagerly down from the couch and rushing to the toy
closet got out the box of soldiers and searched it from top to bottom.The major was not to be seen anywhere, nor to this day has Jimmieboy
ever again set eyes upon him.Transcriber's Note:

    ejaculated the Parallelopipedon?She was
too proud to ask him to spend more of his evenings with her.On those
occasions when he voluntarily stayed at home with her, he was so
discontented that he drove her almost to distraction.Although she was
convinced that he was seeing nothing of the girl who had been with
him the night of the accident, she did not trust him.Not that girl,
perhaps, but there were others.Into Christine's little parlor, then, K. turned, the evening after he
had seen Tillie.She was reading by the lamp, and the door into the hall
stood open."Come in," she said, as he hesitated in the doorway."There's a brush in the drawer of the hat-rack--although I don't really
mind how you look."The little room always cheered K. Its warmth and light appealed to his
aesthetic sense; after the bareness of his bedroom, it spelled luxury.And perhaps, to be entirely frank, there was more than physical comfort
and satisfaction in the evenings he spent in Christine's firelit parlor.He was entirely masculine, and her evident pleasure in his society
gratified him.He had fallen into a way of thinking of himself as a sort
of older brother to all the world because he was a sort of older brother
to Sidney.The evenings with her did something to reinstate him in his
own self-esteem.It was subtle, psychological, but also it was very
human."Here's a chair, and here are
cigarettes and there are matches.But, for once, K. declined the chair.He stood in front of the fireplace
and looked down at her, his head bent slightly to one side."I wonder if you would like to do a very kind thing," he said
unexpectedly."Something much more trouble and not so pleasant."When she was with him, when his steady eyes
looked down at her, small affectations fell away.She was more genuine
with K. than with anyone else, even herself."Tell me what it is, or shall I promise first?""I want you to promise just one thing: to keep a secret."Christine was not over-intelligent, perhaps, but she was shrewd.That Le
Moyne's past held a secret she had felt from the beginning.I want you to go out to see her."The Street did not go out to see women in
Tillie's situation.She's going to have a child,
Christine; and she has had no one to talk to but her hus--but Mr.I'd really rather not go, K. Not,"
she hastened to set herself right in his eyes--"not that I feel any
unwillingness to see her.But--what in the
world shall I say to her?"It had been rather a long time since Christine had been accused
of having a kind heart.Not that she was unkind, but in all her
self-centered young life there had been little call on her sympathies."I wish I were as good as you think I am."Then Le Moyne spoke briskly:--

"I'll tell you how to get there; perhaps I would better write it."He moved over to Christine's small writing-table and, seating himself,
proceeded to write out the directions for reaching Hillfoot.Behind him, Christine had taken his place on the hearth-rug and stood
watching his head in the light of the desk-lamp."What a strong, quiet
face it is," she thought.Why did she get the impression of such a
tremendous reserve power in this man who was a clerk, and a clerk only?Behind him she made a quick, unconscious gesture of appeal, both hands
out for an instant.She dropped them guiltily as K. rose with the paper
in his hand."I've drawn a sort of map of the roads," he began."You see, this--"

Christine was looking, not at the paper, but up at him."I wonder if you know, K.," she said, "what a lucky woman the woman will
be who marries you?""I wonder how long I could hypnotize her into thinking that.""I've had time to do a little thinking lately," she said, without
bitterness.I've been looking back,
wondering if I ever thought that about him.I wonder--"

She checked herself abruptly and took the paper from his hand."I'll go to see Tillie, of course," she consented."It is like you to
have found her."Although she picked up the book that she had been reading
with the evident intention of discussing it, her thoughts were still on
Tillie, on Palmer, on herself.After a moment:--

"Has it ever occurred to you how terribly mixed up things are?Can you think of anybody on it that--that things
have gone entirely right with?""It's a little world of its own, of course," said K., "and it has plenty
of contact points with life.But wherever one finds people, many or few,
one finds all the elements that make up life--joy and sorrow, birth and
death, and even tragedy.That's rather trite, isn't it?""To a certain extent they make their own
fates.But when you think of the women on the Street,--Tillie,
Harriet Kennedy, Sidney Page, myself, even Mrs.Rosenfeld back in the
alley,--somebody else moulds things for us, and all we can do is to sit
back and suffer.I am beginning to think the world is a terrible place,
K. Why do people so often marry the wrong people?Why can't a man
care for one woman and only one all his life?Why--why is it all so
complicated?""There are men who care for only one woman all their lives.""You're that sort, aren't you?""I don't want to put myself on any pinnacle.If I cared enough for
a woman to marry her, I'd hope to--But we are being very tragic,
Christine."There's going to be another mistake, K., unless you stop
it."He tried to leaven the conversation with a little fun."If you're going to ask me to interfere between Mrs.McKee and the
deaf-and-dumb book and insurance agent, I shall do nothing of the sort.She can both speak and hear enough for both of them."He's mad about her, K.; and, because
she's the sort she is, he'll probably be mad about her all his life,
even if he marries her.But he'll not be true to her; I know the type
now."K. leaned back with a flicker of pain in his eyes.Astute as he was, he did not suspect that Christine was using this
method to fathom his feeling for Sidney.But he had himself in hand by this time, and she learned nothing from
either his voice or his eyes."I'm not in a position to marry anybody.Even
if Sidney cared for me, which she doesn't, of course--"

"Then you don't intend to interfere?You're going to let the Street see
another failure?""I think you can understand," said K. rather wearily, "that if I cared
less, Christine, it would be easier to interfere."After all, Christine had known this, or surmised it, for weeks.But it
hurt like a fresh stab in an old wound.It was K. who spoke again after
a pause:--

"The deadly hard thing, of course, is to sit by and see things happening
that one--that one would naturally try to prevent.""I don't believe that you have always been of those who only stand and
wait," said Christine."Sometime, K., when you know me better and like
me better, I want you to tell me about it, will you?"When I discovered that I
was unfit to hold that trust any longer, I quit.But Christine's eyes were on
him often that evening, puzzled, rather sad.They talked of books, of music--Christine played well in a dashing way.K. had brought her soft, tender little things, and had stood over her
until her noisy touch became gentle.She played for him a little, while
he sat back in the big chair with his hand screening his eyes.When, at last, he rose and picked up his cap; it was nine o'clock."I've taken your whole evening," he said remorsefully."Why don't you
tell me I am a nuisance and send me off?"Christine was still at the piano, her hands on the keys.She spoke
without looking at him:--

"You're never a nuisance, K., and--"

"You'll go out to see Tillie, won't you?"But I'll not go under false pretenses.I am going quite frankly
because you want me to.""I forgot to tell you," she went on."Father has given Palmer five
thousand dollars.He's going to buy a share in a business."I don't believe much in Palmer's business ventures."Underneath it he divined strain and
repression."I hate to go and leave you alone," he said at last from the door."Have
you any idea when Palmer will be back?"Stand behind me; I
don't want to see you, and I want to tell you something."He did as she bade him, rather puzzled."I think I am a fool for saying this.Perhaps I am spoiling the only
chance I have to get any happiness out of life.I was terribly unhappy, K., and then you
came into my life, and I--now I listen for your step in the hall.I
can't be a hypocrite any longer, K."When he stood behind her, silent and not moving, she turned slowly about
and faced him.He towered there in the little room, grave eyes on hers."It's a long time since I have had a woman friend, Christine," he said
soberly.In a good many
ways, I'd not care to look ahead if it were not for you.I value our
friendship so much that I--"

"That you don't want me to spoil it," she finished for him."I know
you don't care for me, K., not the way I--But I wanted you to know.It
doesn't hurt a good man to know such a thing.And it--isn't going to
stop your coming here, is it?""Of course not," said K. heartily."But to-morrow, when we are both
clear-headed, we will talk this over.You are mistaken about this thing,
Christine; I am sure of that.Things have not been going well, and just
because I am always around, and all that sort of thing, you think things
that aren't really so.He tried to make her smile up at him.If she had cried, things might have been different for every one; for
perhaps K. would have taken her in his arms.He was heart-hungry enough,
those days, for anything.And perhaps, too, being intuitive, Christine
felt this.But she had no mind to force him into a situation against his
will."It is because you are good," she said, and held out her hand.Le Moyne took it and bent over and kissed it lightly.There was in
the kiss all that he could not say of respect, of affection and
understanding."Good-night, Christine," he said, and went into the hall and upstairs.The lamp was not lighted in his room, but the street light glowed
through the windows.Once again the waving fronds of the ailanthus tree
flung ghostly shadows on the walls.There was a faint sweet odor of
blossoms, so soon to become rank and heavy.Over the floor in a wild zigzag darted a strip of white paper which
disappeared under the bureau.CHAPTER XXI


Sidney went into the operating-room late in the spring as the result of
a conversation between the younger Wilson and the Head."When are you going to put my protegee into the operating-room?"asked
Wilson, meeting Miss Gregg in a corridor one bright, spring afternoon."That usually comes in the second year, Dr."That isn't a rule, is it?"Miss Page is very young, and of course there are other
girls who have not yet had the experience.But, if you make the
request--"

"I am going to have some good cases soon.I'll not make a request, of
course; but, if you see fit, it would be good training for Miss Page."Miss Gregg went on, knowing perfectly that at his next operation Dr.Wilson would expect Sidney Page in the operating-room.The other doctors
were not so exigent.She would have liked to have all the staff old and
settled, like Dr.These young men came in
and tore things up.The
butter had been bad--she must speak to the matron.The sterilizer in
the operating-room was out of order--that meant a quarrel with the chief
engineer.Requisitions were too heavy--that meant going around to the
wards and suggesting to the head nurses that lead pencils and bandages
and adhesive plaster and safety-pins cost money.It was particularly inconvenient to move Sidney just then.Carlotta
Harrison was off duty, ill.She had been ailing for a month, and now she
was down with a temperature.As the Head went toward Sidney's ward,
her busy mind was playing her nurses in their wards like pieces on a
checkerboard.Sidney went into the operating-room that afternoon.For her blue
uniform, kerchief, and cap she exchanged the hideous operating-room
garb: long, straight white gown with short sleeves and mob-cap,
gray-white from many sterilizations.But the ugly costume seemed to
emphasize her beauty, as the habit of a nun often brings out the placid
saintliness of her face.The relationship between Sidney and Max had reached that point that
occurs in all relationships between men and women: when things must
either go forward or go back, but cannot remain as they are.The
condition had existed for the last three months.As a matter of fact, Wilson could not go ahead.The situation with
Carlotta had become tense, irritating.He felt that she stood ready
to block any move he made.He would not go back, and he dared not go
forward.If Sidney was puzzled, she kept it bravely to herself.In her little
room at night, with the door carefully locked, she tried to think things
out.There were a few treasures that she looked over regularly: a dried
flower from the Christmas roses; a label that he had pasted playfully
on the back of her hand one day after the rush of surgical dressings was
over and which said "Rx, Take once and forever."There was another piece of paper over which Sidney spent much time.It
was a page torn out of an order book, and it read: "Sigsbee may have
light diet; Rosenfeld massage."Underneath was written, very small:

     "You are the most beautiful person in the world."Two reasons had prompted Wilson to request to have Sidney in the
operating-room.He wanted her with him, and he wanted her to see him at
work: the age-old instinct of the male to have his woman see him at his
best.He was in high spirits that first day of Sidney's operating-room
experience.For the time at least, Carlotta was out of the way.Her
somber eyes no longer watched him.Once he looked up from his work and
glanced at Sidney where she stood at strained attention.She  under the eyes that were turned on her."A great many of them faint on the first day.We sometimes have them
lying all over the floor."He challenged Miss Gregg with his eyes, and she reproved him with a
shake of her head, as she might a bad boy.One way and another, he managed to turn the attention of the
operating-room to Sidney several times.It suited his whim, and it did
more than that: it gave him a chance to speak to her in his teasing way.Sidney came through the operation as if she had been through fire--taut
as a string, rather pale, but undaunted.But when the last case had been
taken out, Max dropped his bantering manner.The internes were looking
over instruments; the nurses were busy on the hundred and one tasks of
clearing up; so he had a chance for a word with her alone."I am proud of you, Sidney; you came through it like a soldier."A nurse was coming toward him; he had only a moment."I shall leave a note in the mail-box," he said quickly, and proceeded
with the scrubbing of his hands which signified the end of the day's
work.The operations had lasted until late in the afternoon.The night nurses
had taken up their stations; prayers were over.The internes were
gathered in the smoking-room, threshing over the day's work, as was
their custom.When Sidney was free, she went to the office for the note.It was very brief:--

I have something I want to say to you, dear.I never see you alone at home any more.If you can get off for an
hour, won't you take the trolley to the end of Division Street?I'll be
there with the car at eight-thirty, and I promise to have you back by
ten o'clock.No one saw her as she stood by the mail-box.The
ticking of the office clock, the heavy rumble of a dray outside, the
roll of the ambulance as it went out through the gateway, and in her
hand the realization of what she had never confessed as a hope, even to
herself!He, the great one, was going to stoop to her.It had been in
his eyes that afternoon; it was there, in his letter, now.To get out of her uniform and into
street clothing, fifteen minutes; on the trolley, another fifteen.But she did not meet him, after all.Miss Wardwell met her in the upper
hall."She has been waiting for hours--ever since you went to the
operating-room."Sidney sighed, but she went to Carlotta at once.The girl's condition
was puzzling the staff.--which is hospital for
"typhoid restrictions."has apathy, generally, and Carlotta
was not apathetic.Sidney found her tossing restlessly on her high white
bed, and put her cool hand over Carlotta's hot one.Then, seeing her operating-room uniform: "You've been
THERE, have you?""Is there anything I can do, Carlotta?"Excitement had dyed Sidney's cheeks with color and made her eyes
luminous.The girl in the bed eyed her, and then abruptly drew her hand
away."I'll not keep you if you have an engagement."If you would
like me to stay with you tonight--"

Carlotta shook her head on her pillow.Nothing escaped Carlotta's eyes--the younger girl's radiance, her
confusion, even her operating room uniform and what it signified.How
she hated her, with her youth and freshness, her wide eyes, her soft red
lips!And this engagement--she had the uncanny divination of fury."I was going to ask you to do something for me," she said shortly; "but
I've changed my mind about it.To end the interview, she turned over and lay with her face to the wall.All her training had been to ignore
the irritability of the sick, and Carlotta was very ill; she could see
that."Just remember that I am ready to do anything I can, Carlotta," she
said.She waited a moment, but, receiving no acknowledgement of her offer, she
turned slowly and went toward the door."If it's typhoid, I'm gone."Of course you're not gone, or anything like it.I doze for a little, and when I waken there are
people in the room.They stand around the bed and talk about me."Sidney's precious minutes were flying; but Carlotta had gone into a
paroxysm of terror, holding to Sidney's hand and begging not to be left
alone."I'm too young to die," she would whimper.And in the next breath: "I
want to die--I don't want to live!"The hands of the little watch pointed to eight-thirty when at last she
lay quiet, with closed eyes.Sidney, tiptoeing to the door, was brought
up short by her name again, this time in a more normal voice:--

"Sidney.""Perhaps you are right and I'm going to get over this."Your nerves are playing tricks with you to-night.""I'll tell you now why I sent for you.""If--if I get very bad,--you know what I mean,--will you promise to do
exactly what I tell you?""My trunk key is in my pocket-book.There is a letter in the tray--just
a name, no address on it.Promise to see that it is not delivered; that
it is destroyed without being read."Sidney promised promptly; and, because it was too late now for her
meeting with Wilson, for the next hour she devoted herself to making
Carlotta comfortable.So long as she was busy, a sort of exaltation of
service upheld her.But when at last the night assistant came to sit
with the sick girl, and Sidney was free, all the life faded from her
face.He had waited for her and she had not come.Perhaps, after all, his question had
not been what she had thought.Her stiff cap moved in the breeze as it swung from the corner of her
mirror.Under her window passed and repassed the night life of the
city--taxicabs, stealthy painted women, tired office-cleaners trudging
home at midnight, a city patrol-wagon which rolled in through the gates
to the hospital's always open door.When she could not sleep, she got up
and padded to the window in bare feet.The light from a passing machine
showed a youthful figure that looked like Joe Drummond.Life, that had always seemed so simple, was growing very complicated
for Sidney: Joe and K., Palmer and Christine, Johnny Rosenfeld,
Carlotta--either lonely or tragic, all of them, or both.It
had been a quiet night and she was asleep in her chair.To save her cap
she had taken it off, and early streaks of silver showed in her hair."I want something from my trunk," she said.The assistant wakened reluctantly, and looked at her watch."You don't want me to go to the
trunk-room at this hour!""I can go myself," said Carlotta, and put her feet out of bed.If I wait my temperature will go up and I
can't think.""Bring it here," said Carlotta shortly.The young woman went without haste, to show that a night assistant may
do such things out of friendship, but not because she must.She stopped
at the desk where the night nurse in charge of the rooms on that floor
was filling out records."Give me twelve private patients to look after instead of one nurse like
Carlotta Harrison!""I've got to go to the trunk-room
for her at this hour, and it next door to the mortuary!"As the first rays of the summer sun came through the window, shadowing
the fire-escape like a lattice on the wall of the little gray-walled
room, Carlotta sat up in her bed and lighted the candle on the stand.The night assistant, who dreamed sometimes of fire, stood nervously by."Why don't you let me do it?"The candle was in her hand, and she was
staring at the letter."Because I want to do it myself," she said at last, and thrust the
envelope into the flame.It burned slowly, at first a thin blue flame
tipped with yellow, then, eating its way with a small fine crackling,
a widening, destroying blaze that left behind it black ash and
destruction.The acrid odor of burning filled the room.Not until it was
consumed, and the black ash fell into the saucer of the candlestick, did
Carlotta speak again.Then:--

"If every fool of a woman who wrote a letter burnt it, there would be
less trouble in the world," she said, and lay back among her pillows.She was sleepy and irritated, and she had
crushed her best cap by letting the lid of Carlotta's trunk fall on her.She went out of the room with disapproval in every line of her back."She burned it," she informed the night nurse at her desk."A letter to
a man--one of her suitors, I suppose.The deepening and broadening of Sidney's character had been very
noticeable in the last few months.She had gained in decision without
becoming hard; had learned to see things as they are, not through the
rose mist of early girlhood; and, far from being daunted, had developed
a philosophy that had for its basis God in His heaven and all well with
the world.But her new theory of acceptance did not comprehend everything.She was
in a state of wild revolt, for instance, as to Johnny Rosenfeld, and
more remotely but not less deeply concerned over Grace Irving.Soon
she was to learn of Tillie's predicament, and to take up the cudgels
valiantly for her.But her revolt was to be for herself too.On the day after her failure
to keep her appointment with Wilson she had her half-holiday.No word
had come from him, and when, after a restless night, she went to her new
station in the operating-room, it was to learn that he had been called
out of the city in consultation and would not operate that day.O'Hara
would take advantage of the free afternoon to run in some odds and ends
of cases.The operating-room made gauze that morning, and small packets of
tampons: absorbent cotton covered with sterilized gauze, and fastened
together--twelve, by careful count, in each bundle.Miss Grange, who had been kind to Sidney in her probation months, taught
her the method."Used instead of sponges," she explained."If you noticed yesterday,
they were counted before and after each operation.One of these missing
is worse than a bank clerk out a dollar at the end of the day.There's
no closing up until it's found!"Sidney eyed the small packet before her anxiously.From that time on she handled the small gauze sponges almost reverently.The operating-room--all glass, white enamel, and shining
nickel-plate--first frightened, then thrilled her.It was as if, having
loved a great actor, she now trod the enchanted boards on which he
achieved his triumphs.She was glad that it was her afternoon off, and
that she would not see some lesser star--O'Hara, to wit--usurping his
place.He must have known that
she had been delayed.The operating-room was a hive of industry, and tongues kept pace with
fingers.The hospital was a world, like the Street.The nurses had come
from many places, and, like cloistered nuns, seemed to have left the
other world behind.A new President of the country was less real than a
new interne.The country might wash its soiled linen in public; what was
that compared with enough sheets and towels for the wards?Big buildings
were going up in the city.but the hospital took cognizance of that,
gathering as it did a toll from each new story added.What news of
the world came in through the great doors was translated at once into
hospital terms.It took
up life where the town left it at its gates, and carried it on or saw
it ended, as the case might be.So these young women knew the ending of
many stories, the beginning of some; but of none did they know both the
first and last, the beginning and the end.By many small kindnesses Sidney had made herself popular.And there was
more to it than that.The other girls had the respect
for her of one honest worker for another.The episode that had caused
her suspension seemed entirely forgotten.They showed her carefully what
she was to do; and, because she must know the "why" of everything, they
explained as best they could.It was while she was standing by the great sterilizer that she heard,
through an open door, part of a conversation that sent her through the
day with her world in revolt.The talkers were putting the anaesthetizing-room in readiness for the
afternoon.Sidney, waiting for the time to open the sterilizer, was
busy, for the first time in her hurried morning, with her own thoughts.Because she was very human, there was a little exultation in her mind.What would these girls say when they learned of how things stood between
her and their hero--that, out of all his world of society and clubs and
beautiful women, he was going to choose her?Not shameful, this: the honest pride of a woman in being chosen from
many."Do you think he has really broken with her?"She knows it's coming; that's all.""Sometimes I have wondered--"

"So have others.She oughtn't to be here, of course.But among so many
there is bound to be one now and then who--who isn't quite--"

She hesitated, at a loss for a word."Did you--did you ever think over that trouble with Miss Page about the
medicines?That would have been easy, and like her.""She hates Miss Page, of course, but I hardly think--If that's true, it
was nearly murder."There were two voices, a young one, full of soft southern inflections,
and an older voice, a trifle hard, as from disillusion.Sidney could hear the clatter of
bottles on the tray, the scraping of a moved table.(The younger voice, with a thrill in it.)"I saw her with him in his car one evening.And on her vacation last
summer--"

The voices dropped to a whisper.Sidney, standing cold and white by the
sterilizer, put out a hand to steady herself.How hateful life was, and men and women.Must there always be
something hideous in the background?Now she felt its hot breath on her cheek.She was steady enough in a moment, cool and calm, moving about her work
with ice-cold hands and slightly narrowed eyes.To a sort of physical
nausea was succeeding anger, a blind fury of injured pride.He had been
in love with Carlotta and had tired of her.He was bringing her his
warmed-over emotions.She remembered the bitterness of her month's
exile, and its probable cause.Well he might,
if he suspected the truth.For just a moment she had an illuminating flash of Wilson as he really
was, selfish and self-indulgent, just a trifle too carefully dressed,
daring as to eye and speech, with a carefully calculated daring, frankly
pleasure-loving.The voices in the next room had risen above their whisper."Genius has privileges, of course," said the older voice.To-morrow he is to do the Edwardes operation again.I am
glad I am to see him do it."Sidney still held her hands over her eyes.He WAS a great surgeon: in
his hands he held the keys of life and death.And perhaps he had never
cared for Carlotta: she might have thrown herself at him.He was a man,
at the mercy of any scheming woman.She tried to summon his image to her aid.Instead, there came, clear and distinct, a
picture of K. Le Moyne in the hall of the little house, reaching one of
his long arms to the chandelier over his head and looking up at her as
she stood on the stairs.CHAPTER XXII


"My God, Sidney, I'm asking you to marry me!""I have never been in love with her."He had drawn the car close to a bank, and they were
sitting in the shade, on the grass.It was the Sunday afternoon after
Sidney's experience in the operating-room."You took her out, Max, didn't you?"Good Heavens, you've put me through a catechism in the last
ten minutes!""If my father were living, or even mother, I--one of them would have
done this for me, Max.I've been very wretched for
several days."It was the first encouragement she had given him.There was no coquetry
about her aloofness.It was only that her faith in him had had a shock
and was slow of reviving."You are very, very lovely, Sidney.I wonder if you have any idea what
you mean to me?""You meant a great deal to me, too," she said frankly, "until a few days
ago.I thought you were the greatest man I had ever known, and the best.And then--I think I'd better tell you what I overheard.He listened doggedly to her account of the hospital gossip, doggedly and
with a sinking sense of fear, not of the talk, but of Carlotta herself.Usually one might count on the woman's silence, her instinct for
self-protection.She
had known from the start that the affair was a temporary one; he had
never pretended anything else.There was silence for a moment after Sidney finished.Then:

"You are not a child any longer, Sidney.You have learned a great deal
in this last year.One of the things you know is that almost every man
has small affairs, many of them sometimes, before he finds the woman
he wants to marry.When he finds her, the others are all off--there's
nothing to them.It's the real thing then, instead of the sham.""Palmer was very much in love with Christine, and yet--"

"Palmer is a cad.""I don't want you to think I'm making terms.But if this thing
went on, and I found out afterward that you--that there was anyone else,
it would kill me."There was something boyish in his triumph, in the very gesture with
which he held out his arms, like a child who has escaped a whipping.He
stood up and, catching her hands, drew her to her feet."Then I'm yours, and only yours, if you want me," he said, and took her
in his arms.He was riotously happy, must hold her off for the joy of drawing her to
him again, must pull off her gloves and kiss her soft bare palms.he cried, and bent down to bury his face in the
warm hollow of her neck.Sidney glowed under his caresses--was rather startled at his passion, a
little ashamed."Tell me you love me a little bit."I love you," said Sidney, and flushed scarlet.But even in his arms, with the warm sunlight on his radiant face, with
his lips to her ear, whispering the divine absurdities of passion, in
the back of her obstinate little head was the thought that, while she
had given him her first embrace, he had held other women in his arms.It
made her passive, prevented her complete surrender."You are only letting me love you," he
complained."I don't believe you care, after all."He freed her, took a step back from her."I am afraid I am jealous," she said simply."I keep thinking of--of
Carlotta.""Will it help any if I swear that that is off absolutely?"But he insisted on swearing, standing with one hand upraised, his eyes
on her.The Sunday landscape was very still, save for the hum of busy
insect life.A mile or so away, at the foot of two hills, lay a white
farmhouse with its barn and outbuildings.In a small room in the barn
a woman sat; and because it was Sunday, and she could not sew, she read
her Bible.

"--and that after this there will be only one woman for me," finished
Max, and dropped his hand.He bent over and kissed Sidney on the lips.At the white farmhouse, a little man stood in the doorway and surveyed
the road with eyes shaded by a shirt-sleeved arm.Behind him, in a
darkened room, a barkeeper was wiping the bar with a clean cloth."I guess I'll go and get my coat on, Bill," said the little man heavily.I see a machine about a mile down the
road."Sidney broke the news of her engagement to K. herself, the evening of
the same day.The little house was quiet when she got out of the car at
the door.Harriet was asleep on the couch at the foot of her bed,
and Christine's rooms were empty.She found Katie on the back porch,
mountains of Sunday newspapers piled around her."I'd about give you up," said Katie."I was thinking, rather than see
your ice-cream that's left from dinner melt and go to waste, I'd take it
around to the Rosenfelds."She stood in front of Katie, drawing off her gloves."You're gettin' prettier every day, Miss Sidney.Is that the blue suit
Miss Harriet said she made for you?Sidney obediently turned, and Katie admired."When I think how things have turned out!""You in a
hospital, doing God knows what for all sorts of people, and Miss Harriet
making a suit like that and asking a hundred dollars for it, and that
tony that a person doesn't dare to speak to her when she's in the
dining-room.And your poor ma...well, it's all in a lifetime!"Well, that's what I call it.Don't I hear her dressing
up about four o'clock every afternoon, and, when she's all ready,
sittin' in the parlor with the door open, and a book on her knee, as if
she'd been reading all afternoon?If he doesn't stop, she's at the foot
of the stairs, calling up to him.'K.,' she says, 'K., I'm waiting to
ask you something!'or, 'K., wouldn't you like a cup of tea?'She's
always feedin' him tea and cake, so that when he comes to table he won't
eat honest victuals."Sidney had paused with one glove half off.Was life making another of its queer errors, and were
Christine and K. in love with each other?K. had always been HER
friend, HER confidant.To give him up to Christine--she shook herself
impatiently.Why not be glad that he had some
sort of companionship?She went upstairs to the room that had been her mother's, and took off
her hat.She wanted to be alone, to realize what had happened to
her.It gave her an odd, lost
feeling.She was going to be married--not very soon, but ultimately.A
year ago her half promise to Joe had gratified her sense of romance.She
was loved, and she had thrilled to it.Marriage, that had been but a vision then,
loomed large, almost menacing.She had learned the law of compensation:
that for every joy one pays in suffering.Women who married went down
into the valley of death for their children.One must love and be loved
very tenderly to pay for that.Women grew old, and age was not always
lovely.This very maternity--was it not fatal to beauty?Visions of
child-bearing women in the hospitals, with sagging breasts and relaxed
bodies, came to her.Sidney could hear her moving
about with flat, inelastic steps.One married, happily or not as the case might
be, and took the risk.Or one stayed single, like Harriet, growing a
little hard, exchanging slimness for leanness and austerity of figure,
flat-chested, thin-voiced.One blossomed and withered, then, or one
shriveled up without having flowered.All at once it seemed very
terrible to her.She felt as if she had been caught in an inexorable
hand that had closed about her.Harriet found her a little later, face down on her mother's bed, crying
as if her heart would break."You've been overworking," she said.Your
measurements for that suit showed it.I have never approved of this
hospital training, and after last January--"

She could hardly credit her senses when Sidney, still swollen with
weeping, told her of her engagement.If you care for him and he has asked you to
marry him, why on earth are you crying your eyes out?"It just came over me, all at once,
that I--It was just foolishness.The girl needed her mother, and she,
Harriet, was a hard, middle-aged woman and a poor substitute.She patted
Sidney's moist hand."I'll attend to your wedding things,
Sidney.We'll show this street that even Christine Lorenz can be
outdone."And, as an afterthought: "I hope Max Wilson will settle down
now.K. had taken Christine to see Tillie that Sunday afternoon.Palmer
had the car out--had, indeed, not been home since the morning of the
previous day.He played golf every Saturday afternoon and Sunday at the
Country Club, and invariably spent the night there.So K. and Christine
walked from the end of the trolley line, saying little, but under K.'s
keen direction finding bright birds in the hedgerows, hidden field
flowers, a dozen wonders of the country that Christine had never dreamed
of.The interview with Tillie had been a disappointment to K. Christine,
with the best and kindliest intentions, struck a wrong note.In her
endeavor to cover the fact that everything in Tillie's world was wrong,
she fell into the error of pretending that everything was right.Tillie, grotesque of figure and tragic-eyed, listened to her patiently,
while K. stood, uneasy and uncomfortable, in the wide door of the
hay-barn and watched automobiles turning in from the road.When
Christine rose to leave, she confessed her failure frankly."I've meant well, Tillie," she said."I'm afraid I've said exactly
what I shouldn't.I can only think that, no matter what is wrong, two
wonderful pieces of luck have come to you.Schwitter--cares for you,--you admit that,--and you are going to have a
child.""I used to be a good woman, Mrs.When I look in that glass at myself, and call myself what I am, I'd give
a good bit to be back on the Street again."She found opportunity for a word with K. while Christine went ahead of
him out of the barn."I've been wanting to speak to you, Mr."Joe Drummond's been coming out here pretty regular.Schwitter
says he's drinking a little.He don't like him loafing around here: he
sent him home last Sunday."The barkeeper says he carries a revolver around, and talks wild.I
thought maybe Sidney Page could do something with him.""I think he'd not like her to know.'s face was thoughtful as he followed Christine to the road.Christine was very silent, on the way back to the city.More than once
K. found her eyes fixed on him, and it puzzled him.Poor Christine was
only trying to fit him into the world she knew--a world whose men were
strong but seldom tender, who gave up their Sundays to golf, not to
visiting unhappy outcasts in the country.How masculine he was, and
yet how gentle!It gave her a choking feeling in her throat.She took
advantage of a steep bit of road to stop and stand a moment, her fingers
on his shabby gray sleeve.Sidney was sitting on the low step,
waiting for them.Wilson had come across at seven, impatient because he must see a case
that evening, and promising an early return.In the little hall he had
drawn her to him and kissed her, this time not on the lips, but on the
forehead and on each of her white eyelids.he had said, and was rather ashamed of his own
emotion.From across the Street, as he got into his car, he had waved
his hand to her.Christine went to her room, and, with a long breath of content, K.
folded up his long length on the step below Sidney."Well, dear ministering angel," he said, "how goes the world?"Perhaps because she had a woman's
instinct for making the most of a piece of news, perhaps--more likely,
indeed--because she divined that the announcement would not be entirely
agreeable, she delayed it, played with it."I have gone into the operating-room."There was relief in his eyes, and still a question.Apparently he did not wish to hear her say it; for when, after a moment,
he spoke, it was to forestall her, after all."I think I know what it is, Sidney.""I--it's not an entire surprise.""Aren't you going to wish me happiness?""If my wishing could bring anything good to you, you would have
everything in the world."His voice was not entirely steady, but his eyes smiled into hers."Am I--are we going to lose you soon?"Then, in a burst of confidence:--

"I know so little, K., and he knows so much!I am going to read and
study, so that he can talk to me about his work.That's what marriage
ought to be, a sort of partnership.His mind refused to go forward to the unthinkable future.Instead, he was looking back--back to those days when he had hoped
sometime to have a wife to talk to about his work, that beloved work
that was no longer his.And, finding it agonizing, as indeed all thought
was that summer night, he dwelt for a moment on that evening, a year
before, when in the same June moonlight, he had come up the Street and
had seen Sidney where she was now, with the tree shadows playing over
her.Now it was another and older man, daring,
intelligent, unscrupulous.And this time he had lost her absolutely,
lost her without a struggle to keep her.His only struggle had been with
himself, to remember that he had nothing to offer but failure."Do you know," said Sidney suddenly, "that it is almost a year since
that night you came up the Street, and I was here on the steps?""That's a fact, isn't it!"He managed to get some surprise into his
voice."Because--well, you know, K. Why do men always hate a woman who just
happens not to love them?"It would be much better for them if they
could.As a matter of fact, there are poor devils who go through life
trying to do that very thing, and failing."Sidney's eyes were on the tall house across.Ed's evening
office hour, and through the open window she could see a line of people
waiting their turn.They sat immobile, inert, doggedly patient, until
the opening of the back office door promoted them all one chair toward
the consulting-room."I shall be just across the Street," she said at last."Nearer than I am
at the hospital.""But we will still be friends, K.?"But, after another silence, he astounded her.She had fallen into the
way of thinking of him as always belonging to the house, even, in a
sense, belonging to her.And now--

"Shall you mind very much if I tell you that I am thinking of going
away?""My dear child, you do not need a roomer here any more.I have always
received infinitely more than I have paid for, even in the small
services I have been able to render.You are away, and some day you are going to be married.Don't you see--I
am not needed?""That does not mean you are not wanted."I'll always be near enough, so that I can see
you"--he changed this hastily--"so that we can still meet and talk
things over.Old friends ought to be like that, not too near, but to be
turned on when needed, like a tap.""The Rosenfelds are rather in straits.I thought of helping them to get
a small house somewhere and of taking a room with them.If they could furnish it even plainly, it could be
done."Have you always gone
through life helping people, K.?She bent over and put her hand on his shoulder."It will not be home without you, K."To save him, he could not have spoken just then.A riot of rebellion
surged up in him, that he must let this best thing in his life go out
of it.To go empty of heart through the rest of his days, while his very
arms ached to hold her!And she was so near--just above, with her hand
on his shoulder, her wistful face so close that, without moving, he
could have brushed her hair."You have not wished me happiness, K. Do you remember, when I was going
to the hospital and you gave me the little watch--do you remember what
you said?"You are going to leave us, and I--say it, K.""Good-bye, dear, and--God bless you."CHAPTER XXIII


The announcement of Sidney's engagement was not to be made for a year.Wilson, chafing under the delay, was obliged to admit to himself that
it was best.Carlotta would have
finished her training, and by that time would probably be reconciled to
the ending of their relationship.He had meant every word of what he had sworn to
Sidney.He was genuinely in love, even unselfishly--as far as he could
be unselfish.The secret was to be carefully kept also for Sidney's
sake.The hospital did not approve of engagements between nurses and the
staff.It was disorganizing, bad for discipline.Sidney was very happy all that summer.She glowed with pride when her
lover put through a difficult piece of work; flushed and palpitated when
she heard his praises sung; grew to know, by a sort of intuition, when
he was in the house.She wore his ring on a fine chain around her neck,
and grew prettier every day.Once or twice, however, when she was at home, away from the glamour, her
early fears obsessed her.He was so handsome
and so gifted, and there were women who were mad about him.That was the
gossip of the hospital.Suppose she married him and he tired of her?In
her humility she thought that perhaps only her youth, and such charm as
she had that belonged to youth, held him.And before her, always, she
saw the tragic women of the wards.Sidney had been insistent, and
Harriet had topped the argument in her businesslike way."If you insist
on being an idiot and adopting the Rosenfeld family," she said, "wait
until September.The season for boarders doesn't begin until fall."So K. waited for "the season," and ate his heart out for Sidney in the
interval.Johnny Rosenfeld still lay in his ward, inert from the waist down.As a matter of fact, he was watching the
boy closely, at Max Wilson's request."Tell me when I'm to do it," said Wilson, "and when the time comes,
for God's sake, stand by me.He's got so much
confidence that I'll help him that I don't dare to fail."So K. came on visiting days, and, by special dispensation, on Saturday
afternoons.Not that he knew
anything about it himself; but, by means of a blind teacher, he kept
just one lesson ahead.It found
something absurd and rather touching in this tall, serious young man
with the surprisingly deft fingers, tying raffia knots.The first basket went, by Johnny's request, to Sidney Page."I want her to have it," he said."She got corns on her fingers from
rubbing me when I came in first; and, besides--"

"Yes?"said K. He was tying a most complicated knot, and could not look
up."I'm not going to get in wrong by
talking, but I know something.K. looked up then, and surprised Johnny's secret in his face."If I'd squealed she'd have finished me for good.I'm not running in 2.40 these days.""I'll not tell, or make it uncomfortable for you.The ward was in the somnolence of mid-afternoon.The nearest patient, a man in a wheel-chair, was snoring heavily."It was the dark-eyed one that changed the medicine on me," he said."The one with the heels that were always tapping around, waking me up.After all, it was only what K. had suspected before.But a sense of
impending danger to Sidney obsessed him.If Carlotta would do that, what
would she do when she learned of the engagement?The odd coincidence of
their paths crossing again troubled him.Carlotta Harrison was well again, and back on duty.Luckily for Sidney,
her three months' service in the operating-room kept them apart.For
Carlotta was now not merely jealous.It had been her theory that
Wilson would not marry easily--that, in a sense, he would have to be
coerced into marriage.Some clever woman would marry him some day, and
no one would be more astonished than himself.She thought merely that
Sidney was playing a game like her own, with different weapons.So she
planned her battle, ignorant that she had lost already.She stopped sulking, met Max with smiles,
made no overtures toward a renewal of their relations.To desert a woman was justifiable,
under certain circumstances.But to desert a woman, and have her
apparently not even know it, was against the rules of the game.During a surgical dressing in a private room, one day, he allowed his
fingers to touch hers, as on that day a year before when she had taken
Miss Simpson's place in his office.He was rewarded by the same slow,
smouldering glance that had caught his attention before.A new interne had come into the
house, and was going through the process of learning that from a senior
at the medical school to a half-baked junior interne is a long step
back.He had to endure the good-humored contempt of the older men, the
patronizing instructions of nurses as to rules.His uneasy rounds in
Carlotta's precinct took on the state and form of staff visitations.She
flattered, cajoled, looked up to him.After a time it dawned on Wilson that this junior cub was getting more
attention than himself: that, wherever he happened to be, somewhere in
the offing would be Carlotta and the Lamb, the latter eyeing her with
worship.The enthroning of a
successor galled him.Between them, the Lamb suffered mightily--was
subject to frequent "bawling out," as he termed it, in the
operating-room as he assisted the anaesthetist.He took his troubles to
Carlotta, who soothed him in the corridor--in plain sight of her quarry,
of course--by putting a sympathetic hand on his sleeve.Then, one day, Wilson was goaded to speech."For the love of Heaven, Carlotta," he said impatiently, "stop making
love to that wretched boy.He wriggles like a worm if you look at him."I respect him, and--he respects
me.""It's rather a silly game, you know."I--I don't really care a lot about him, Max.Her attraction for him was almost gone--not quite.She lifted her eyes to his, and for once she was not
acting."I knew it would end, of course.Why, after all, should he not be her friend?He
had treated her cruelly, hideously.If she still desired his friendship,
there was no disloyalty to Sidney in giving it.Not once again did she allow him to see what lay in her eyes.She had
a chance to take up institutional work.She abhorred the thought of
private duty.The Lamb was hovering near, hot eyes on them both."Come to the office and we'll talk it over.""I don't like to go there; Miss Simpson is suspicious."The institution she spoke of was in another city.It occurred to
Wilson that if she took it the affair would have reached a graceful and
legitimate end.Also, the thought of another stolen evening alone with her was not
unpleasant.It would be the last, he promised himself.After all, it was
owing to her.Sidney would be at a lecture that night."Suppose you meet me at the old corner," he said carelessly, eyes on
the Lamb, who was forgetting that he was only a junior interne and was
glaring ferociously."We'll run out into the country and talk things
over."She demurred, with her heart beating triumphantly."What's the use of going back to that?When at last she had yielded, and he
made his way down to the smoking-room, it was with the feeling that he
had won a victory.K. had been uneasy all that day; his ledgers irritated him.He had been
sleeping badly since Sidney's announcement of her engagement.At five
o'clock, when he left the office, he found Joe Drummond waiting outside
on the pavement."Mother said you'd been up to see me a couple of times.I'll go about
town for a half-hour or so."Daniel journeyed to the garden.Thus forestalled, K. found his subject hard to lead up to.But here
again Joe met him more than halfway."Well, go on," he said, when they found themselves in the park; "I don't
suppose you were paying a call.""I guess I know what you are going to say.""I'm not going to preach, if you're expecting that.Ordinarily, if a man
insists on making a fool of himself, I let him alone.""One reason is that I happen to like you.The other reason is that,
whether you admit it or not, you are acting like a young idiot, and are
putting the responsibility on the shoulders of some one else."You are a man, and you are acting like a bad boy.It's a
disappointment to me.She's going to marry Wilson, isn't she?"If I'd go to her
to-night and tell her what I know, she'd never see him again."The idea,
thus born in his overwrought brain, obsessed him.He was not certain that the boy's
statement had any basis in fact.His single determination was to save
Sidney from any pain.When Joe suddenly announced his inclination to go out into the country
after all, he suspected a ruse to get rid of him, and insisted on going
along."Car's at Bailey's garage," he said sullenly."I don't know when I'll
get back."That passed unnoticed until they were on the highroad, with the car
running smoothly between yellowing fields of wheat.Then:--

"So you've got it too!"We'd both
be better off if I sent the car over a bank."He gave the wheel a reckless twist, and Le Moyne called him to time
sternly.They had supper at the White Springs Hotel--not on the terrace, but in
the little room where Carlotta and Wilson had taken their first meal
together.K. ordered beer for them both, and Joe submitted with bad
grace.K. found him more amenable to
reason, and, gaining his confidence, learned of his desire to leave the
city."I'm the only one, and mother yells blue
murder when I talk about it.His dilated pupils became more normal, his
restless hands grew quiet.'s even voice, the picture he drew of
life on the island, the stillness of the little hotel in its mid-week
dullness, seemed to quiet the boy's tortured nerves.He was nearer
to peace than he had been for many days.But he smoked incessantly,
lighting one cigarette from another.At ten o'clock he left K. and went for the car.He paused for a moment,
rather sheepishly, by K."I'm feeling a lot better," he said."I haven't got the band around my
head.That was the last K. saw of Joe Drummond until the next day.CHAPTER XXIV


Carlotta dressed herself with unusual care--not in black this time, but
in white.She coiled her yellow hair in a soft knot at the back of her
head, and she resorted to the faintest shading of rouge.The ride was to be a bright spot in Wilson's memory.He expected recriminations; she meant to make him happy.That was the
secret of the charm some women had for men.They went to such women to
forget their troubles.She set the hour of their meeting at nine, when
the late dusk of summer had fallen; and she met him then, smiling, a
faintly perfumed white figure, slim and young, with a thrill in her
voice that was only half assumed."Surely you are not going to be back at
ten.""I have special permission to be out late."And then, recollecting their new situation: "We have a lot to
talk over.At the White Springs Hotel they stopped to fill the gasolene tank of the
car.Joe Drummond saw Wilson there, in the sheet-iron garage alongside
of the road.It did not occur to Joe
that the white figure in the car was not Sidney.He went rather white,
and stepped out of the zone of light.The influence of Le Moyne was
still on him, however, and he went on quietly with what he was doing.But his hands shook as he filled the radiator.When Wilson's car had gone on, he went automatically about his
preparations for the return trip--lifted a seat cushion to investigate
his own store of gasolene, replacing carefully the revolver he always
carried under the seat and packed in waste to prevent its accidental
discharge, lighted his lamps, examined a loose brake-band.He had been an ass: Le Moyne was right.He'd
get away--to Cuba if he could--and start over again.He would forget the
Street and let it forget him."To Schwitter's, of course," one of them grumbled."We might as well go
out of business.""There's no money in running a straight place.Schwitter and half a
dozen others are getting rich.""That was Wilson, the surgeon in town.He cut off my brother-in-law's
leg--charged him as much as if he had grown a new one for him.Now he goes to Schwitter's, like the rest.So Max Wilson was taking Sidney to Schwitter's, making her the butt of
garage talk!Joe's hands grew cold, his
head hot.A red mist spread between him and the line of electric lights.He knew Schwitter's, and he knew Wilson.He flung himself into his car and threw the throttle open."You can't start like that, son," one of the men remonstrated."You let
'er in too fast."Joe snarled, and made a second ineffectual effort.Thus adjured, the men offered neither further advice nor assistance.The
minutes went by in useless cranking--fifteen.But when K., growing uneasy, came out
into the yard, the engine had started at last.He was in time to see Joe
run his car into the road and turn it viciously toward Schwitter's.Carlotta's nearness was having its calculated effect on Max Wilson.His
spirits rose as the engine, marking perfect time, carried them along the
quiet roads.Partly it was reaction--relief that she should be so reasonable, so
complaisant--and a sort of holiday spirit after the day's hard work.Oddly enough, and not so irrational as may appear, Sidney formed a
part of the evening's happiness--that she loved him; that, back in the
lecture-room, eyes and even mind on the lecturer, her heart was with
him.So, with Sidney the basis of his happiness, he made the most of his
evening's freedom.He sang a little in his clear tenor--even, once when
they had slowed down at a crossing, bent over audaciously and kissed
Carlotta's hand in the full glare of a passing train."I like to be reckless," he replied.She did not want the situation to get
out of hand.Moreover, what was so real for her was only too plainly a
lark for him.The hopelessness of her situation was dawning on her.Even when the
touch of her beside him and the solitude of the country roads got in
his blood, and he bent toward her, she found no encouragement in his
words:--"I am mad about you to-night."She took her courage in her hands:--"Then why give me up for some one
else?"No one else will
ever care as I do."I don't care for anyone else in the
world.If you let me go I'll want to die."Then, as he was silent:--

"If you'll marry me, I'll be true to you all my life.The sense, if not the words, of what he had sworn to Sidney that Sunday
afternoon under the trees, on this very road!Swift shame overtook
him, that he should be here, that he had allowed Carlotta to remain in
ignorance of how things really stood between them.I'm engaged to marry some one
else."He was ashamed at the way she took the news.If she had stormed or wept,
he would have known what to do."You must have expected it, sooner or later."He thought she might faint, and looked at her
anxiously.Her profile, indistinct beside him, looked white and drawn.If their
escapade became known, it would end things between Sidney and him.It must become known
without any apparent move on her part.If, for instance, she became ill,
and was away from the hospital all night, that might answer.The thing
would be investigated, and who knew--

The car turned in at Schwitter's road and drew up before the house.The narrow porch was filled with small tables, above which hung rows of
electric lights enclosed in Japanese paper lanterns.Midweek, which had
found the White Springs Hotel almost deserted, saw Schwitter's crowded
tables set out under the trees.Seeing the crowd, Wilson drove directly
to the yard and parked his machine."No need of running any risk," he explained to the still figure beside
him."We can walk back and take a table under the trees, away from those
infernal lanterns."She reeled a little as he helped her out.She leaned rather
heavily on him as they walked toward the house.The faint perfume that
had almost intoxicated him, earlier, vaguely irritated him now.At the rear of the house she shook off his arm and preceded him around
the building.She chose the end of the porch as the place in which to
drop, and went down like a stone, falling back.The visitors at Schwitter's were too
much engrossed with themselves to be much interested.She opened her
eyes almost as soon as she fell--to forestall any tests; she was
shrewd enough to know that Wilson would detect her malingering very
quickly--and begged to be taken into the house."I feel very ill," she
said, and her white face bore her out.Schwitter and Bill carried her in and up the stairs to one of the newly
furnished rooms.He had a
horror of knockout drops and the police.They laid her on the bed, her
hat beside her; and Wilson, stripping down the long sleeve of her glove,
felt her pulse."There's a doctor in the next town," said Schwitter."I was going to
send for him, anyhow--my wife's not very well."He closed the door behind the relieved figure of the landlord, and,
going back to Carlotta, stood looking down at her."You were no more faint than I am."The lanterns--"

He crossed the room deliberately and went out, closing the door behind
him.He saw at once where he stood--in what danger.If she insisted
that she was ill and unable to go back, there would be a fuss.At the foot of the stairs, Schwitter pulled himself together.After all,
the girl was only ill.The doctor ought to be here by this time.Tillie was alone, out
in the harness-room.He looked through the crowded rooms, at the
overflowing porch with its travesty of pleasure, and he hated the whole
thing with a desperate hatred.A young man edged his way into the hall and confronted him."Upstairs--first bedroom to the right."Surely, as
a man sowed he reaped.At the top, on the landing, he confronted
Wilson.He fired at him without a word--saw him fling up his arms and
fall back, striking first the wall, then the floor.The buzz of conversation on the porch suddenly ceased.Joe put his
revolver in his pocket and went quietly down the stairs.The crowd
parted to let him through.Carlotta, crouched in her room, listening, not daring to open the door,
heard the sound of a car as it swung out into the road.CHAPTER XXV


On the evening of the shooting at Schwitter's, there had been a late
operation at the hospital.Sidney, having duly transcribed her lecture
notes and said her prayers, was already asleep when she received the
insistent summons to the operating-room.These night battles with death roused all her fighting blood.There were times when she felt as if, by sheer will, she could force
strength, life itself, into failing bodies.Her sensitive nostrils
dilated, her brain worked like a machine.That night she received well-deserved praise.When the Lamb, telephoning
hysterically, had failed to locate the younger Wilson, another staff
surgeon was called.His keen eyes watched Sidney--felt her capacity, her
fiber, so to speak; and, when everything was over, he told her what was
in his mind."Don't wear yourself out, girl," he said gravely.It was good work to-night--fine work.By midnight the work was done, and the nurse in charge sent Sidney to
bed.It was the Lamb who received the message about Wilson; and because he
was not very keen at the best, and because the news was so startling, he
refused to credit his ears.I mustn't make a mess of this."Wilson, the surgeon, has been shot," came slowly and distinctly."Get the staff there and have a room ready.Get the operating-room
ready, too."The Lamb wakened then, and roused the house.He was incoherent, rather,
so that Dr.Ed got the impression that it was Le Moyne who had been
shot, and only learned the truth when he got to the hospital.He liked K., and his heart was sore within
him.Staff's in the
executive committee room, sir."I thought you said--"

The Lamb turned pale at that, and braced himself."I'm sorry--I thought you understood.Ed, who was heavy and not very young, sat down on an office chair.Out of sheer habit he had brought the bag.He put it down on the floor
beside him, and moistened his lips.The Lamb stood by the door, and Dr.Outside the windows, the night world went
by--taxi-cabs full of roisterers, women who walked stealthily close
to the buildings, a truck carrying steel, so heavy that it shook the
hospital as it rumbled by.The bag with the dog-collar in it was on the
floor.He thought of many things, but mostly of the promise he had made
his mother.And, having forgotten the injured man's shortcomings, he
was remembering his good qualities--his cheerfulness, his courage, his
achievements.He remembered the day Max had done the Edwardes operation,
and how proud he had been of him.He figured out how old he was--not
thirty-one yet, and already, perhaps--There he stopped thinking.Cold
beads of sweat stood out on his forehead."I think I hear them now, sir," said the Lamb, and stood back
respectfully to let him pass out of the door.Carlotta stayed in the room during the consultation.No one seemed to
wonder why she was there, or to pay any attention to her.Ed beside the bed, and
then closed in again.Carlotta waited, her hand over her mouth to keep herself from screaming.Surely they would operate; they wouldn't let him die like that!When she saw the phalanx break up, and realized that they would not
operate, she went mad.She stood against the door, and accused them of
cowardice--taunted them."Do you think he would let any of you die like that?""Die
like a hurt dog, and none of you to lift a hand?"It was Pfeiffer who drew her out of the room and tried to talk reason
and sanity to her."If there was a chance, we'd operate, and you
know it."The staff went hopelessly down the stairs to the smoking-room, and
smoked.The night assistant sent coffee down
to them, and they drank it.Ed stayed in his brother's room, and
said to his mother, under his breath, that he'd tried to do his best by
Max, and that from now on it would be up to her.The country doctor had come, too,
finding Tillie's trial not imminent.On the way in he had taken it
for granted that K. was a medical man like himself, and had placed his
hypodermic case at his disposal.When he missed him,--in the smoking-room, that was,--he asked for him."I don't see the chap who came in with us," he said.K. sat alone on a bench in the hall.He wondered who would tell Sidney;
he hoped they would be very gentle with her.He sat in the shadow,
waiting.He did not want to go home and leave her to what she might have
to face.There was a chance she would ask for him.He wanted to be near,
in that case.He sat in the shadow, on the bench.The night watchman went by twice and
stared at him.At last he asked K. to mind the door until he got some
coffee."One of the staff's been hurt," he explained."If I don't get some
coffee now, I won't get any."Somehow, she had not thought
of it before.Now she wondered how she could have failed to think of it.If only she could find him and he would do it!She would go down on her
knees--would tell him everything, if only he would consent.When she found him on his bench, however, she passed him by.She had a
terrible fear that he might go away if she put the thing to him first.So first she went to the staff and confronted them.They were men of
courage, only declining to undertake what they considered hopeless work.The one man among them who might have done the thing with any chance
of success lay stricken.Not one among them but would have given of his
best--only his best was not good enough."It would be the Edwardes operation, wouldn't it?"There were no rules to cover such conduct on
the part of a nurse.One of them--Pfeiffer again, by chance--replied
rather heavily:--

"If any, it would be the Edwardes operation."How
did this thing happen, Miss Harrison?"Her face was ghastly, save for the trace of
rouge; her eyes were red-rimmed.Edwardes is sitting on a bench in the hall outside!"He was to take up the old
burden.Ed remembered
about her when, tracing his brother's career from his babyhood to man's
estate and to what seemed now to be its ending, he had remembered that
Max was very fond of Sidney.He had hoped that Sidney would take him and
do for him what he, Ed, had failed to do.She thought it was another operation, and her spirit was just a little
weary.She forced her shoes on her
tired feet, and bathed her face in cold water to rouse herself.He was fond of Sidney; she always
smiled at him; and, on his morning rounds at six o'clock to waken the
nurses, her voice was always amiable.So she found him in the hall,
holding a cup of tepid coffee.He was old and bleary, unmistakably dirty
too--but he had divined Sidney's romance.She took it obediently, but over the cup her eyes searched his.He had had another name, but it was
lost in the mists of years.So she finished it, not without anxiety that she might be needed.But
daddy's attentions were for few, and not to be lightly received."Can you stand a piece of bad news?"Strangely, her first thought was of K.It ain't much, but I guess you'd like to know
it."So she went down alone to the room where Dr.Ed sat in a chair, with
his untidy bag beside him on the floor, and his eyes fixed on a straight
figure on the bed.When he saw Sidney, he got up and put his arms around
her.His eyes told her the truth before he told her anything.She hardly
listened to what he said.The fact was all that concerned her--that her
lover was dying there, so near that she could touch him with her hand,
so far away that no voice, no caress of hers, could reach him.Ed's arms
about her, and wait.Sidney's voice sounded strange to her
ears.For suddenly Sidney's small world, which
had always sedately revolved in one direction, began to move the other
way.The door opened, and the staff came in.But where before they had
moved heavily, with drooped heads, now they came quickly, as men with a
purpose.There was a tall man in a white coat with them.He ordered them
about like children, and they hastened to do his will.At first Sidney
only knew that now, at last, they were going to do something--the tall
man was going to do something.He stood with his back to Sidney, and
gave orders.The nurses stood
by, while the staff did nurses' work.The senior surgical interne,
essaying assistance, was shoved aside by the senior surgical consultant,
and stood by, aggrieved.It was the Lamb, after all, who brought the news to Sidney.Ed, and she was alone now, her face buried
against the back of a chair."There'll be something doing now, Miss Page," he offered.Do you know who's going to do it?"His voice echoed the subdued excitement of the room--excitement and new
hope."Did you ever hear of Edwardes, the surgeon?--the Edwardes operation,
you know.They found him
sitting on a bench in the hall downstairs."Sidney raised her head, but she could not see the miraculously found
Edwardes.She could see the familiar faces of the staff, and that other
face on the pillow, and--she gave a little cry.How like
him to be there, to be wherever anyone was in trouble!Tears came to her
eyes--the first tears she had shed.As if her eyes had called him, he looked up and saw her.The staff stood back to let him pass, and gazed after him.The wonder of what had happened was growing on them.K. stood beside Sidney, and looked down at her.Just at first it seemed
as if he found nothing to say.Then:

"There's just a chance, Sidney dear.If a shadow passed over his face, no one saw it."I'll not ask you to go back to your room.If you will wait somewhere
near, I'll see that you have immediate word.""I am going to the operating-room."She was
not herself, of course, what with strain and weariness.Whether she knew him as Le Moyne or as Edwardes mattered very
little, after all.The thing that really mattered was that he must try
to save Wilson for her.If he failed--It ran through his mind that if he
failed she might hate him the rest of her life--not for himself, but for
his failure; that, whichever way things went, he must lose.Edwardes says you are to stay away from the operation, but to
remain near.He--he promises to call you if--things go wrong."She sat in the
anaesthetizing-room, and after a time she knew that she was not alone.She realized dully that Carlotta was there,
too, pacing up and down the little room.She was never sure, for
instance, whether she imagined it, or whether Carlotta really stopped
before her and surveyed her with burning eyes."So you thought he was going to marry you!"Sidney tried to answer, and failed--or that was the way the dream went."If you had enough character, I'd think you did it.How do I know you
didn't follow us, and shoot him as he left the room?"It must have been reality, after all; for Sidney's numbed mind grasped
the essential fact here, and held on to it.He had promised--sworn that this should not happen.It seemed as if nothing more could hurt her.In the movement to and from the operating room, the door stood open for
a moment.A tall figure--how much it looked like K.!--straightened and
held out something in its hand.Then more waiting, a stir of movement in the room beyond the closed
door.Carlotta was standing, her face buried in her hands, against the
door.It
must be tragic to care like that!She herself was not caring much; she
was too numb.Beyond, across the courtyard, was the stable.Before the day of the
motor ambulances, horses had waited there for their summons, eager as
fire horses, heads lifted to the gong.When Sidney saw the outline of
the stable roof, she knew that it was dawn.The city still slept, but
the torturing night was over.And in the gray dawn the staff, looking
gray too, and elderly and weary, came out through the closed door and
took their hushed way toward the elevator.Sidney, straining her ears, gathered that they had seen a
miracle, and that the wonder was still on them.Almost on their heels came K. He was in the white coat, and more and
more he looked like the man who had raised up from his work and held out
something in his hand.Sidney's head was aching and confused.She sat there in her chair, looking small and childish.The dawn was
morning now--horizontal rays of sunlight on the stable roof and across
the windowsill of the anaesthetizing-room, where a row of bottles sat on
a clean towel.The tall man--or was it K.?--looked at her, and then reached up and
turned off the electric light.Why, it was K., of course; and he was
putting out the hall light before he went upstairs.When the light was
out everything was gray.She slid very quietly out of
her chair, and lay at his feet in a dead faint.He held her as he had held her that day
at the park when she fell in the river, very carefully, tenderly, as one
holds something infinitely precious.Not until he had placed her on her
bed did she open her eyes.She was
so tired, and to be carried like that, in strong arms, not knowing where
one was going, or caring--

The nurse he had summoned hustled out for aromatic ammonia.Sidney,
lying among her pillows, looked up at K.All the time I was sitting waiting, I kept
thinking that it was you who were operating!The nurse was a long time getting the ammonia.There was so much to talk
about: that Dr.Max had been out with Carlotta Harrison, and had been
shot by a jealous woman; the inexplicable return to life of the great
Edwardes; and--a fact the nurse herself was willing to vouch for, and
that thrilled the training-school to the core--that this very Edwardes,
newly risen, as it were, and being a miracle himself as well as
performing one, this very Edwardes, carrying Sidney to her bed and
putting her down, had kissed her on her white forehead.And,
after all, the nurse had only seen it in the mirror, being occupied
at the time in seeing if her cap was straight.The school, therefore,
accepted the miracle, but refused the kiss.But something had happened to K.
that savored of the marvelous.His faith in himself was coming back--not
strongly, with a rush, but with all humility.He had been loath to
take up the burden; but, now that he had it, he breathed a sort of
inarticulate prayer to be able to carry it.And, since men have looked for signs since the beginning of time, he too
asked for a sign.Not, of course, that he put it that way, or that he
was making terms with Providence.It was like this: if Wilson got well,
he'd keep on working.He'd feel that, perhaps, after all, this was
meant.If Wilson died--Sidney held out her hand to him."What should I do without you, K.?""All you have to do is to want me."His voice was not too steady, and he took her pulse in a most
businesslike way to distract her attention from it.You are quite professional about
pulses."He was not sure, to be frank, that she'd
be interested.Now, with Wilson as he was, was no time to obtrude his
own story."Will you drink some beef tea if I send it to you?""Sleep, while he--"

"I promise to tell you if there is any change.But, as he rose from the chair beside her low bed, she put out her hand
to him.And, when he hesitated: "I bring all my troubles
to you, as if you had none.Somehow, I can't go to Aunt Harriet, and of
course mother--Carlotta cares a great deal for him.He had so many friends, and no enemies that I knew
of."Her mind seemed to stagger about in a circle, making little excursions,
but always coming back to the one thing."Some drunken visitor to the road-house."He could have killed himself for the words the moment they were spoken."It is not just to judge anyone before you hear the story.""I must get up and go on duty."When the nurse
came in with the belated ammonia, she found K. making an arbitrary
ruling, and Sidney looking up at him mutinously."Miss Page is not to go on duty to-day.She is to stay in bed until
further orders."The confusion in Sidney's mind cleared away suddenly.It was K. who had performed the miracle operation--K. who
had dared and perhaps won!Dear K., with his steady eyes and his long
surgeon's fingers!Then, because she seemed to see ahead as well as
back into the past in that flash that comes to the drowning and to those
recovering from shock, and because she knew that now the little house
would no longer be home to K., she turned her face into her pillow and
cried.Her lover was not true and might
be dying; her friend would go away to his own world, which was not the
Street.K. left her at last and went back to Seventeen, where Dr.If Max would only open
his eyes, so he could tell him what had been in his mind all these
years--his pride in him and all that.With a sort of belated desire to make up for where he had failed, he put
the bag that had been Max's bete noir on the bedside table, and began
to clear it of rubbish--odd bits of dirty cotton, the tubing from a long
defunct stethoscope, glass from a broken bottle, a scrap of paper on
which was a memorandum, in his illegible writing, to send Max a check
for his graduating suit.When K. came in, he had the old dog-collar in
his hand."Belonged to an old collie of ours," he said heavily."Milkman ran over
him and killed him.Max chased the wagon and licked the driver with his
own whip."Got him in
a grape-basket."CHAPTER XXVI


Max had rallied well, and things looked bright for him.His patient did
not need him, but K. was anxious to find Joe; so he telephoned the
gas office and got a day off.The sordid little tragedy was easy to
reconstruct, except that, like Joe, K. did not believe in the innocence
of the excursion to Schwitter's.His spirit was heavy with the
conviction that he had saved Wilson to make Sidney ultimately wretched.And it is doubtful if the Street would
have been greatly concerned even had it known.It had never heard of
Edwardes, of the Edwardes clinic or the Edwardes operation.Its medical
knowledge comprised the two Wilsons and the osteopath around the corner.When, as would happen soon, it learned of Max Wilson's injury, it would
be more concerned with his chances of recovery than with the manner of
it.But Joe's affair with Sidney had been the talk of the neighborhood.If
the boy disappeared, a scandal would be inevitable.Twenty people had
seen him at Schwitter's and would know him again.At first it seemed as if the boy had frustrated him.Christine, waylaying K. in the little hall, told him
that.She
says Joe has not been home all night.She says he looks up to you, and
she thought if you could find him and would talk to him--"

"Joe was with me last night.Drummond he was in good spirits, and that she's not to worry.I feel sure she will hear from him to-day.Something went wrong with his
car, perhaps, after he left me."Katie brought his coffee to his room,
and he drank it standing.He was working out a theory about the boy.Beyond Schwitter's the highroad stretched, broad and inviting, across
the State.Either he would have gone that way, his little car eating up
the miles all that night, or--K. would not formulate his fear of what
might have happened, even to himself.As he went down the Street, he saw Mrs.McKee in her doorway, with a
little knot of people around her.The Street was getting the night's
news.He rented a car at a local garage, and drove himself out into the
country.He was not minded to have any eyes on him that day.Bill was
scrubbing the porch, and a farmhand was gathering bottles from the grass
into a box.The dead lanterns swung in the morning air, and from back on
the hill came the staccato sounds of a reaping-machine.He recognized K., and, mopping dry a part of the porch,
shoved a chair on it.Well, how's the man who got his last night?"County detectives were here bright and early.That's what this house
is--money.""Bill, did you see the man who fired that shot last night?"A sort of haze came over Bill's face, as if he had dropped a curtain
before his eyes.But his reply came promptly:

"Surest thing in the world.Dark man,
about thirty, small mustache--"

"Bill, you're lying, and I know it.The barkeeper kept his head, but his color changed.He thrust his mop into the pail.He's been out at the barn all night."The farmhand had filled his box and disappeared around the corner of the
house.K. put his hand on Bill's shirt-sleeved arm."We've got to get him away from here, Bill."The county men may come back to search the premises.""How do I know you aren't one of them?"As a matter of fact,
I followed him here; but I was too late.Did he take the revolver away
with him?"After all, it was a good world:
Tillie with her baby in her arms; Wilson conscious and rallying; Joe
safe, and, without the revolver, secure from his own remorse.Other
things there were, too--the feel of Sidney's inert body in his arms, the
way she had turned to him in trouble.It was not what he wanted, this
last, but it was worth while.The reaping-machine was in sight now; it
had stopped on the hillside.The men were drinking out of a bucket that
flashed in the sun.What had come over Wilson, to do so reckless
a thing?K., who was a one-woman man, could not explain it.From inside the bar Bill took a careful survey of Le Moyne.He noted his
tall figure and shabby suit, the slight stoop, the hair graying over his
ears.Barkeepers know men: that's a part of the job.After his survey he
went behind the bar and got the revolver from under an overturned pail."Now," he said quietly, "where is he?""In my room--top of the house."He remembered the day when he had sat
waiting in the parlor, and had heard Tillie's slow step coming down.And last night he himself had carried down Wilson's unconscious figure.Surely the wages of sin were wretchedness and misery.From nails in the rafters hung Bill's holiday wardrobe.A tin cup and a
cracked pitcher of spring water stood on the window-sill.Joe was sitting in the corner farthest from the window.When the door
swung open, he looked up.He showed no interest on seeing K., who had to
stoop to enter the low room.You're damned glad you didn't, and so am I.""But never mind about that, Joe;
I'll get some."Loud calls from below took Bill out of the room.As he closed the door
behind him, K.'s voice took on a new tone: "Joe, why did you do it?""You saw him with somebody at the White Springs, and followed them?"I did it, and I'll stand by
it.""Has it occurred to you that you made a mistake?""Go and tell that to somebody who'll believe you!""They
came here and took a room.I'd do it again
if I had a chance, and do it better."I got here not two minutes after you left.Sidney was not out of the hospital
last night.She attended a lecture, and then an operation."It was undoubtedly a relief to him to know that it had not
been Sidney; but if K. expected any remorse, he did not get it."If he is that sort, he deserves what he got," said the boy grimly.The hours he had spent
alone in the little room had been very bitter, and preceded by a time
that he shuddered to remember.K. got it by degrees--his descent of the
staircase, leaving Wilson lying on the landing above; his resolve to
walk back and surrender himself at Schwitter's, so that there could be
no mistake as to who had committed the crime."I intended to write a confession and then shoot myself," he told K."But the barkeeper got my gun out of my pocket.And--"

After a pause: "Does she know who did it?""Then, if he gets better, she'll marry him anyhow."The thing we've got to do is to
hush the thing up, and get you away.""I'd go to Cuba, but I haven't the money.""Sidney need never know who did it."There are times when some cataclysm tears down the walls of reserve
between men.That time had come for Joe, and to a lesser extent for K.
The boy rose and followed him to the door."Why don't you tell her the whole thing?--the whole filthy story?"Schwitter had taken in five hundred dollars the previous day."Five hundred gross," the little man hastened to explain.It's going hard
with her, just now, that she hasn't any women friends about.It's in the
safe, in cash; I haven't had time to take it to the bank."He seemed
to apologize to himself for the unbusinesslike proceeding of lending
an entire day's gross receipts on no security."It's better to get him
away, of course.I have tried to have an orderly
place.If they arrest him here--"

His voice trailed off.He had come a far way from the day he had walked
down the Street, and eyed Its poplars with appraising eyes--a far way.Now he had a son, and the child's mother looked at him with tragic eyes.It was arranged that K. should go back to town, returning late that
night to pick up Joe at a lonely point on the road, and to drive him to
a railroad station.But, as it happened, he went back that afternoon.He had told Schwitter he would be at the hospital, and the message found
him there.Wilson was holding his own, conscious now and making a hard
fight.The message from Schwitter was very brief:--

"Something has happened, and Tillie wants you.I don't like to trouble
you again, but she--wants you."K. was rather gray of face by that time, having had no sleep and little
food since the day before.But he got into the rented machine again--its
rental was running up; he tried to forget it--and turned it toward
Hillfoot.But first of all he drove back to the Street, and walked
without ringing into Mrs.McKee's approaching change of state had
altered the "mealing" house.The ticket-punch still lay on the hat-rack
in the hall.Through the rusty screen of the back parlor window one
viewed the spiraea, still in need of spraying.McKee herself was in
the pantry, placing one slice of tomato and three small lettuce leaves
on each of an interminable succession of plates."I've got a car at the door," he announced, "and there's nothing so
extravagant as an empty seat in an automobile.Being of the class who believe a boudoir cap the
ideal headdress for a motor-car, she apologized for having none."If I'd known you were coming I would have borrowed a cap," she said."Miss Tripp, third floor front, has a nice one.If you'll take me in my
toque--"

K. said he'd take her in her toque, and waited with some anxiety,
having not the faintest idea what a toque was.He was not without other
anxieties.What if the sight of Tillie's baby did not do all that he
expected?And Schwitter had been very
vague.But here K. was more sure of himself: the little man's voice had
expressed as exactly as words the sense of a bereavement that was not a
grief.McKee's old fondness for the girl to bring them
together.But, as they neared the house with its lanterns and tables,
its whitewashed stones outlining the drive, its small upper window
behind which Joe was waiting for night, his heart failed him, rather.He
had a masculine dislike for meddling, and yet--Mrs.McKee had suddenly
seen the name in the wooden arch over the gate: "Schwitter's.""I'm not going in there, Mr."Tillie's not in the house."She didn't approve of all that went on there, so she moved out.It's
very comfortable and clean; it smells of hay.You'd be surprised how
nice it is.""She's late with her conscience,
I'm thinking.""Last night," K. remarked, hands on the wheel, but car stopped, "she
had a child there.It--it's rather like very old times, isn't it?McKee, not in a manger, of course."McKee's tone, which had been fierce at
the beginning, ended feebly."I want you to go in and visit her, as you would any woman who'd had a
new baby and needed a friend.Tell her you've been wanting to see her.""Lie a little, for your soul's sake."She wavered, and while she wavered he drove her in under the arch with
the shameful name, and back to the barn.But there he had the tact to
remain in the car, and Mrs.McKee's peace with Tillie was made alone.When, five minutes later, she beckoned him from the door of the barn,
her eyes were red.They're going
to be married right away."The clergyman was coming along the path with Schwitter at his heels.At the door to Tillie's room he uncovered his head.Lorenz had saved Palmer Howe's
credit.On the strength of the deposit, he borrowed a thousand at the
bank with which he meant to pay his bills, arrears at the University and
Country Clubs, a hundred dollars lost throwing aces with poker dice, and
various small obligations of Christine's.He drank nothing for a week,
went into the details of the new venture with Christine's father, sat at
home with Christine on her balcony in the evenings.With the knowledge
that he could pay his debts, he postponed the day.He liked the feeling
of a bank account in four figures.The first evening or two Christine's pleasure in having him there
gratified him.He felt kind, magnanimous, almost virtuous.On the third
evening he was restless.It occurred to him that his wife was beginning
to take his presence as a matter of course.When he found that the ice was out and the beer warm and flat, he was
furious.Christine had been making a fight, although her heart was only half
in it.She was resolutely good-humored, ignored the past, dressed for
Palmer in the things he liked.They still took their dinners at the
Lorenz house up the street.When she saw that the haphazard table
service there irritated him, she coaxed her mother into getting a
butler.The Street sniffed at the butler behind his stately back.Secretly and
in its heart, it was proud of him.With a half-dozen automobiles, and
Christine Howe putting on low neck in the evenings, and now a butler,
not to mention Harriet Kennedy's Mimi, it ceased to pride itself on
its commonplaceness, ignorant of the fact that in its very lack of
affectation had lain its charm.On the night that Joe shot Max Wilson, Palmer was noticeably restless.He had seen Grace Irving that day for the first time but once since
the motor accident.To do him justice, his dissipation of the past few
months had not included women.Perhaps she typified the
care-free days before his marriage; perhaps the attraction was deeper,
fundamental.He met her in the street the day before Max Wilson was
shot.The sight of her walking sedately along in her shop-girl's black
dress had been enough to set his pulses racing.When he saw that she
meant to pass him, he fell into step beside her."I believe you were going to cut me!"And, after a second's hesitation: "I'm keeping straight, too.""Do you have to walk as fast as this?"Once a week I get off a little early.I--"

He eyed her suspiciously.The Rosenfeld boy is still there, you know."But a moment later he burst out irritably:--

"That was an accident, Grace.The boy took the chance when he engaged
to drive the car.I dream of the little
devil sometimes, lying there.I'll tell you what I'll do," he added
magnanimously."I'll stop in and talk to Wilson.He ought to have done
something before this."I don't think you can do anything for
him, unless--"

The monstrous injustice of the thing overcame her.Palmer and she
walking about, and the boy lying on his hot bed!If you could give her some money, it would
help.""You owe him too, don't you?I don't see that I'm under any
obligation, anyhow.I paid his board for two months in the hospital."When she did not acknowledge this generosity,--amounting to forty-eight
dollars,--his irritation grew.Her manner
galled him, into the bargain.She was too calm in his presence, too
cold.Where she had once palpitated visibly under his warm gaze, she was
now self-possessed and quiet.Where it had pleased his pride to think
that he had given her up, he found that the shoe was on the other foot.At the entrance to a side street she stopped.The next day he drew the thousand dollars from the bank.A good many
of his debts he wanted to pay in cash; there was no use putting checks
through, with incriminating indorsements.Also, he liked the idea of
carrying a roll of money around.The big fellows at the clubs always had
a wad and peeled off bills like skin off an onion.He took a couple of
drinks to celebrate his approaching immunity from debt.He played auction bridge that afternoon in a private room at one of the
hotels with the three men he had lunched with.He won eighty dollars, and thrust it loose in his trousers pocket.If he could carry the thousand around for a
day or so, something pretty good might come of it.When the game was over, he
bought drinks to celebrate his victory.The losers treated, too, to show
they were no pikers.He offered to put up
the eighty and throw for it.The losers mentioned dinner and various
engagements.Christine would greet him with raised
eyebrows.They would eat a stuffy Lorenz dinner, and in the evening
Christine would sit in the lamplight and drive him mad with soft music.He wanted lights, noise, the smiles of women.Luck was with him, and he
wanted to be happy.At nine o'clock that night he found Grace.She had moved to a cheap
apartment which she shared with two other girls from the store.His drunkenness was of the mind, mostly.The lines from his nose to the corners of his mouth were
slightly accentuated, his eyes open a trifle wider than usual.That
and a slight paleness of the nostrils were the only evidences of his
condition.She retreated before him, her eyes watchful.Men in his condition were
apt to be as quick with a blow as with a caress.But, having gained his
point, he was amiable.We can take in a roof-garden.""I've told you I'm not doing that sort of thing.""You've got somebody else on the string."There--there has never been anybody else, Palmer."He caught her suddenly and jerked her toward him."You let me hear of anybody else, and I'll cut the guts out of him!"He held her for a second, his face black and fierce.Then, slowly and
inevitably, he drew her into his arms.But, in the queer loyalty of her class, he was the only man she had
cared for.She took him for that moment, felt his hot
kisses on her mouth, her throat, submitted while his rather brutal
hands bruised her arms in fierce caresses.Then she put him from her
resolutely.But he was less steady than he had been.The heat of the little flat
brought more blood to his head.He wavered as he stood just inside the
door.She's in love with a fellow at the house.""Lemme come in and sit down, won't you?"She let him pass her into the sitting-room."You've turned me down, and now Christine--she thinks I don't know.I'm
no fool; I see a lot of things.I know that I've made her
miserable.But I made a merry little hell for you too, and you don't
kick about it."Nothing else, perhaps, could have shown her so well what a broken reed
he was.You were a good girl before I knew you.I'm not going to do you any harm, I swear it.I only
wanted to take you out for a good time.He
drew out the roll of bills and showed it to her.She had never known him to have much money.A new look flashed into her eyes, not cupidity, but purpose."Aren't you going to give me some of that?"The very drunk have the intuition sometimes of savages or brute beasts.He thrust it back into his pocket, but his hand retained its grasp of
it."Don't lemme be happy for a minute!"You give me that for the Rosenfeld boy, and I'll go out with you.""If I give you all that, I won't have any money to go out with!""I'm no piker," he said largely.He held it out to her, and from another pocket produced the eighty
dollars, in crushed and wrinkled notes."It's my lucky day," he said thickly.His head dropped back on his chair; he propped his sagging legs on a
stool.She knew him--knew that he would sleep almost all night.She would have to make up something to tell the other girls; but no
matter--she could attend to that later.She had never had a thousand dollars in her hands before.She paused, in
pinning on her hat, to count the bills.CHAPTER XXVII


K. spent all of the evening of that day with Wilson.He was not to go
for Joe until eleven o'clock.The injured man's vitality was standing
him in good stead.He had asked for Sidney and she was at his bedside.The office is full, they tell me," he said, bending
over the bed."I'll come in later, and if they'll make me a shakedown,
I'll stay with you to-night.""Get some sleep...I've been a
poor stick...try to do better--" His roving eyes fell on the dog collar
on the stand.he said, and put his hand over
Dr.Ed's, as it lay on the bed.K. found Sidney in the room, not sitting, but standing by the window.One shaded light burned in a far corner.It seemed to K. that she looked at
him as if she had never really seen him before, and he was right.Sidney was trying to reconcile the K. she had known so well with this
new K., no longer obscure, although still shabby, whose height had
suddenly become presence, whose quiet was the quiet of infinite power.She was suddenly shy of him, as he stood looking down at her.He saw the
gleam of her engagement ring on her finger.As
though she had meant by wearing it to emphasize her belief in her lover.They did not speak beyond their greeting, until he had gone over the
record.Then:--

"We can't talk here.Far away was the
night nurse's desk, with its lamp, its annunciator, its pile of records.The passage floor reflected the light on glistening boards."I have been thinking until I am almost crazy, K. And now I know how it
happened."The principal thing is, not how it happened, but that he is going to
get well, Sidney."She stood looking down, twisting her ring around her finger."We are going to get him away to-night.He'll
get off safely, I think."You shoulder all our
troubles, K., as if they were your own."You mean--but my part in
getting Joe off is practically nothing.As a matter of fact, Schwitter
has put up the money.My total capital in the world, after paying the
taxicab to-day, is seven dollars."Tillie married
and has a baby--all in twenty-four hours!Squalled like a maniac when the water went on its head."She said she would have to go in her toque."You find Max and save him--don't look like
that!And you get Joe away, borrowing money to send
him.And as if that isn't enough, when you ought to have been getting
some sleep, you are out taking a friend to Tillie, and being godfather
to the baby."I--"

"When I look back and remember how all these months I've been talking
about service, and you said nothing at all, and all the time you were
living what I preached--I'm so ashamed, K."She saw that, and tried to
smile.I'm to take him across the country to the railroad.I was
wondering--"

"Yes?""I'd better explain first what happened, and why it happened.Then if
you are willing to send him a line, I think it would help.He saw a girl
in white in the car and followed in his own machine.He thought it was
you, of course.He didn't like the idea of your going to Schwitter's.And Schwitter and--and Wilson took her upstairs
to a room."I feel very guilty, K., as if it all comes back to
me.He watched her go down the hall toward the night nurse's desk.He would
have given everything just then for the right to call her back, to take
her in his arms and comfort her.He himself had
gone through loneliness and heartache, and the shadow was still on him.He waited until he saw her sit down at the desk and take up a pen.Then
he went back into the quiet room.He stood by the bedside, looking down.Wilson was breathing quietly: his
color was coming up, as he rallied from the shock.'s mind now was
just one thought--to bring him through for Sidney, and then to go away.He could do
sanitation work, or he might try the Canal.The Street would go on working out its own salvation.He would have
to think of something for the Rosenfelds.But there again, perhaps it would be better if he went away.Christine's story would have to work itself out.He was glad in a way that Sidney had asked no questions about him, had
accepted his new identity so calmly.It had been overshadowed by the
night tragedy.It would have pleased him if she had shown more interest,
of course.It was enough, he told himself, that he
had helped her, that she counted on him.But more and more he knew in
his heart that it was not enough."I'd better get away from here," he
told himself savagely.And having taken the first step toward flight, as happens in such cases,
he was suddenly panicky with fear, fear that he would get out of hand,
and take her in his arms, whether or no; a temptation to run from
temptation, to cut everything and go with Joe that night.But there
his sense of humor saved him.That would be a sight for the gods, two
defeated lovers flying together under the soft September moon.He thought it was Sidney and turned with the
light in his eyes that was only for her.She wore a dark skirt and white waist and her
high heels tapped as she crossed the room.Of course it will be a day or two before we are quite
sure."She stood looking down at Wilson's quiet figure."I guess you know I've been crazy about him," she said quietly.I played his game and
I--lost.Quite suddenly she dropped on her knees beside the bed, and put her
cheek close to the sleeping man's hand.When after a moment she rose,
she was controlled again, calm, very white.Edwardes, when he is conscious, that I came in
and said good-bye?"She hesitated, as if the thought tempted her.But K. could not let her go like that.I'm about through with my training, but I've lost my
diploma.""I don't like to see you going away like this."She avoided his eyes, but his kindly tone did what neither the Head nor
the Executive Committee had done that day.One way and another I've known you a long time.""I'll tell you where I live, and--"

"I know where you live."I've tried twice for a diploma and failed.But in the end he prevailed on her to promise not to leave the city
until she had seen him again.It was not until she had gone, a straight
figure with haunted eyes, that he reflected whimsically that once again
he had defeated his own plans for flight.In the corridor outside the door Carlotta hesitated.He was kind; he was going to do something for her.But the old instinct of self-preservation prevailed.Sidney brought her letter to Joe back to K. She was flushed with the
effort and with a new excitement."This is the letter, K., and--I haven't been able to say what I wanted,
exactly.You'll let him know, won't you, how I feel, and how I blame
myself?"Somebody has sent Johnny Rosenfeld a lot of money.The ward nurse wants
you to come back."The well-ordered beds of the daytime
were chaotic now, torn apart by tossing figures.The night was hot and
an electric fan hummed in a far corner.Under its sporadic breezes, as
it turned, the ward was trying to sleep.He was sure it was there, for ever
since it came his hot hand had clutched it.He was quite sure that somehow or other K. had had a hand in it.When he
disclaimed it, the boy was bewildered."It'll buy the old lady what she wants for the house, anyhow," he
said."But I hope nobody's took up a collection for me."You can bet your last match he didn't."In some unknown way the news had reached the ward that Johnny's friend,
Mr."He works in the gas office," he said, "I've seen him there.If he's a
surgeon, what's he doing in the gas office.If he's a surgeon, what's he
doing teaching me raffia-work?After
all, he was a man, or almost.Didn't he have a
state license?"They've got a queer story about you here in the ward.""They say that you're a surgeon; that you operated on Dr.They say that you're the king pin where you came from.""I know it's a damn lie, but if it's true--"

"I used to be a surgeon.As a matter of fact I operated on Dr.I--I am rather apologetic, Jack, because I didn't explain to
you sooner.For--various reasons--I gave up that--that line of business."Don't you think you could do something for me, sir?"When K. did not reply at once, he launched into an explanation."I've been lying here a good while.I didn't say much because I knew I'd
have to take a chance.Either I'd pull through or I wouldn't, and the
odds were--well, I didn't say much.The old lady's had a lot of trouble.But now, with THIS under my pillow for her, I've got a right to ask.I'll take a chance, if you will."But lie here and watch these soaks off the street.Old, a
lot of them, and gettin' well to go out and starve, and--My God!Le
Moyne, they can walk, and I can't."He had started, and now he must go on.Mary moved to the bathroom.Faith in
himself or no faith, he must go on.Life, that had loosed its hold on
him for a time, had found him again."I'll go over you carefully to-morrow, Jack.I'll tell you your chances
honestly."Whatever you charge--"

"I'll take it out of my board bill in the new house!"At four o'clock that morning K. got back from seeing Joe off.Over Sidney's letter Joe had shed a shamefaced tear or two.And during
the night ride, with K. pushing the car to the utmost, he had felt that
the boy, in keeping his hand in his pocket, had kept it on the letter.When the road was smooth and stretched ahead, a gray-white line into the
night, he tried to talk a little courage into the boy's sick heart."You'll see new people, new life," he said."In a month from now you'll
wonder why you ever hung around the Street.I have a feeling that you're
going to make good down there."And once, when the time for parting was very near,--"No matter what
happens, keep on believing in yourself.Joe's response showed his entire self-engrossment."If he dies, I'm a murderer.""He's not going to die," said K. stoutly.At four o'clock in the morning he left the car at the garage and walked
around to the little house.He had had no sleep for forty-five hours;
his eyes were sunken in his head; the skin over his temples looked drawn
and white.His clothes were wrinkled; the soft hat he habitually wore
was white with the dust of the road.As he opened the hall door, Christine stirred in the room beyond.Why in the world aren't you in bed?""Palmer has just come home in a terrible rage.He says he's been robbed
of a thousand dollars.""He doesn't know, or says he doesn't.In the dim hall light he realized that her face was strained and set.The tender words broke down the last barrier of her self-control.She held her arms out to him, and because he was very tired and lonely,
and because more than anything else in the world just then he needed a
woman's arms, he drew her to him and held her close, his cheek to her
hair.Surely there must be some
happiness for us somewhere."But the next moment he let her go and stepped back."I shouldn't have
done that--You know how it is with me.""I'm afraid it will always be Sidney."CHAPTER XXVIII


Johnny Rosenfeld was dead.'s skill had not sufficed to save
him.The operation had been a marvel, but the boy's long-sapped strength
failed at the last.K., set of face, stayed with him to the end.The boy did not know he was
going.He roused from the coma and smiled up at Le Moyne."I've got a hunch that I can move my right foot," he said."Brake foot, clutch foot," said Johnny, and closed his eyes again.K. had forbidden the white screens, that outward symbol of death.So the ward had no suspicion, nor had the boy.It was Sunday, and from the chapel far below
came the faint singing of a hymn.When Johnny spoke again he did not
open his eyes.I'll put in a word for you whenever
I get a chance.""Yes, put in a word for me," said K. huskily.He felt that Johnny would be a good mediator--that whatever he, K., had
done of omission or commission, Johnny's voice before the Tribunal would
count.The lame young violin-player came into the ward.She had cherished a
secret and romantic affection for Max Wilson, and now he was in the
hospital and ill.So she wore the sacrificial air of a young nun and
played "The Holy City."Johnny was close on the edge of his long sleep by that time, and very
comfortable."Tell her nix on the sob stuff," he complained."Ask her to play 'I'm
twenty-one and she's eighteen.'"'s quick explanation she changed to
the staccato air."Ask her if she'll come a little nearer; I can't hear her."So she moved to the foot of the bed, and to the gay little tune Johnny
began his long sleep.But first he asked K. a question: "Are you sure
I'm going to walk, Mr."I give you my solemn word," said K. huskily, "that you are going to be
better than you have ever been in your life."It was K. who, seeing he would no longer notice, ordered the screens to
be set around the bed, K. who drew the coverings smooth and folded the
boy's hands over his breast."It was the result of a man's damnable folly," said K. grimly.The immediate result of his death was that K., who had gained some of
his faith in himself on seeing Wilson on the way to recovery, was beset
by his old doubts.What right had he to arrogate to himself again powers
of life and death?Over and over he told himself that there had been no
carelessness here, that the boy would have died ultimately, that he
had taken the only chance, that the boy himself had known the risk and
begged for it.And now came a question that demanded immediate answer.Wilson would
be out of commission for several months, probably.And he wanted K. to take over his work.You're not thinking about going back to that
ridiculous gas office, are you?""I had some thought of going to Cuba."You've done a marvelous thing; I lie
here and listen to the staff singing your praises until I'm sick of your
name!And now, because a boy who wouldn't have lived anyhow--"

"That's not it," K. put in hastily.I guess I could do
it and get away with it as well as the average.All that deters me--I've
never told you, have I, why I gave up before?"K. was walking restlessly about the
room, as was his habit when troubled."I've heard the gossip; that's all.""When you recognized me that night on the balcony, I told you I'd lost
my faith in myself, and you said the whole affair had been gone over
at the State Society.As a matter of fact, the Society knew of only two
cases."Even at that--"

"You know what I always felt about the profession, Max.We went into
that more than once in Berlin.When I left Lorch and built my own hospital, I hadn't
a doubt of myself.And because I was getting results I got a lot of
advertising.I found I was making
enough out of the patients who could pay to add a few free wards.I want
to tell you now, Wilson, that the opening of those free wards was the
greatest self-indulgence I ever permitted myself.I'd seen so much
careless attention given the poor--well, never mind that.It was almost
three years ago that things began to go wrong.All this doesn't influence me, Edwardes."We had a system in the operating-room as perfect as I
could devise it.I never finished an operation without having my first
assistant verify the clip and sponge count.But that first case died
because a sponge had been left in the operating field.You know how
those things go; you can't always see them, and one goes by the count,
after reasonable caution.Then I lost another case in the same way--a
free case."As well as I could tell, the precautions had not been relaxed.I was
doing from four to six cases a day.After the second one I almost went
crazy.I made up my mind, if there was ever another, I'd give up and go
away."When the last case died, a free case again, I
performed my own autopsy.I allowed only my first assistant in the room.He was almost as frenzied as I was.When I
told him I was going away, he offered to take the blame himself, to
say he had closed the incision.He tried to make me think he was
responsible.I've sent them money from time to time.I used to sit and think
about the children he left, and what would become of them.The ironic
part of it was that, for all that had happened, I was busier all the
time.Men were sending me cases from all over the country.It was either
stay and keep on working, with that chance, or--quit."But if
you had stayed, and taken extra precautions--"

"We'd taken every precaution we knew."K. stood, his tall figure outlined
against the window.Far off, in the children's ward, children were
laughing; from near by a very young baby wailed a thin cry of protest
against life; a bell rang constantly.'s mind was busy with the
past--with the day he decided to give up and go away, with the months of
wandering and homelessness, with the night he had come upon the Street
and had seen Sidney on the doorstep of the little house.You had an enemy somewhere--on your
staff, probably.This profession of ours is a big one, but you know its
jealousies.Let a man get his shoulders above the crowd, and the pack
is after him.""Mixed figure, but you know what I
mean."He had had that gift of the big man everywhere, in
every profession, of securing the loyalty of his followers.He would
have trusted every one of them with his life."You're going to do it, of course."To stay on, to be near Sidney, perhaps to stand
by as Wilson's best man when he was married--it turned him cold.But he
did not give a decided negative.The sick man was flushed and growing
fretful; it would not do to irritate him."Give me another day on it," he said at last.Max's injury had been productive of good, in one way.It had brought the
two brothers closer together.In the mornings Max was restless until
Dr.When he came, he brought books in the shabby bag--his
beloved Burns, although he needed no book for that, the "Pickwick
Papers," Renan's "Lives of the Disciples."Very often Max world doze
off; at the cessation of Dr.Ed's sonorous voice the sick man would stir
fretfully and demand more.But because he listened to everything without
discrimination, the older man came to the conclusion that it was the
companionship that counted.It reminded him of
Max's boyhood, when he had read to Max at night.For once in the last
dozen years, he needed him.What in blazes makes you stop every five minutes?"Ed, who had only stopped to bite off the end of a stogie to hold in
his cheek, picked up his book in a hurry, and eyed the invalid over it.Have you any idea what I'm
reading?"For ten minutes I've been reading across both pages!"Max laughed, and suddenly put out his hand.Demonstrations of affection
were so rare with him that for a moment Dr.Then, rather
sheepishly, he took it."When I get out," Max said, "we'll have to go out to the White Springs
again and have supper."Morning and evening, Sidney went to Max's room.In the morning she only
smiled at him from the doorway.In the evening she went to him after
prayers.The shooting had been a closed book between them.At first, when he
began to recover, he tried to talk to her about it.She was very gentle with him, but very firm."I know how it happened, Max," she said--"about Joe's mistake and all
that.The rest can wait until you are much better."If there had been any change in her manner to him, he would not
have submitted so easily, probably.But she was as tender as ever,
unfailingly patient, prompt to come to him and slow to leave.After a
time he began to dread reopening the subject.She seemed so effectually
to have closed it.And, after all, what good could he
do his cause by pleading it?The fact was there, and Sidney knew it.On the day when K. had told Max his reason for giving up his work, Max
was allowed out of bed for the first time.A box of
red roses came that day from the girl who had refused him a year or more
ago.He viewed them with a carelessness that was half assumed.The news had traveled to the Street that he was to get up that day.Early that morning the doorkeeper had opened the door to a gentleman
who did not speak, but who handed in a bunch of early chrysanthemums and
proceeded to write, on a pad he drew from his pocket:--

"From Mrs.McKee's family and guests, with their congratulations on your
recovery, and their hope that they will see you again soon.If their
ends are clipped every day and they are placed in ammonia water, they
will last indefinitely."Sidney spent her hour with Max that evening as
usual.His big chair had been drawn close to a window, and she found him
there, looking out.But this time, instead of letting
her draw away, he put out his arms and caught her to him."Very glad, indeed," she said soberly.You ought to smile; your
mouth--"

"I am almost always tired; that's all, Max.""Aren't you going to let me make love to you at all?"I was looking for the paper to read to you.""You don't like me to touch you any more.The fear of agitating him brought her quickly.For a moment he was
appeased.He lifted first one
hand and then the other to his lips."If you mean about Carlotta, I forgave that long ago."Many a woman would have held that over him for years--not that
he had done anything really wrong on that nightmare excursion.But so
many women are exigent about promises."We needn't discuss that to-night, Max."Let me tell Ed
that you will marry me soon.Then, when I go away, I'll take you with
me.""Can't we talk things over when you are stronger?"Her tone caught his attention, and turned him a little white.He faced
her to the window, so that the light fell full on her.She had meant to wait; but, with his keen eyes
on her, she could not dissemble."I am going to make you very unhappy for a little while.""I've had a lot of time to think.If you had really wanted me, Max--"

"My God, of course I want you!"I think you care for me--"

"I love you!I swear I never loved any other woman as I love you."Suddenly he remembered that he had also sworn to put Carlotta out of his
life.He knew that Sidney remembered, too; but she gave no sign.But there would always be other women, Max."If you loved me you could do anything with me."By the way her color leaped, he knew he had struck fire.All
his conjectures as to how Sidney would take the knowledge of his
entanglement with Carlotta had been founded on one major premise--that
she loved him."But, good Heavens, Sidney, you do care for me, don't you?""I'm afraid I don't, Max; not enough."After one look at his face, she
spoke to the window.To me you were the best
and greatest man that ever lived.I--when I said my prayers, I--But that
doesn't matter.When the Lamb--that's one
of the internes, you know--nicknamed you the 'Little Tin God,' I was
angry.You could never be anything little to me, or do anything that
wasn't big."No man could live up to that, Sidney."Now I know that I
didn't care for you, really, at all.I built up an idol and worshiped
it.I always saw you through a sort of haze.You were operating, with
everybody standing by, saying how wonderful it was.Or you were coming
to the wards, and everything was excitement, getting ready for you.It isn't that I think you
are wicked.It's just that I never loved the real you, because I never
knew you."When he remained silent, she made an attempt to justify herself."I'd known very few men," she said."I came into the hospital, and for
a time life seemed very terrible.There were wickednesses I had never
heard of, and somebody always paying for them.Then you would come in, and a lot of them you cured and sent out.You gave them their chance, don't you see?Until I knew about Carlotta,
you always meant that to me.In the nurses' parlor, a few feet down the
corridor, the nurses were at prayers."The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want," read the Head, her voice
calm with the quiet of twilight and the end of the day."He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the
still waters."The nurses read the response a little slowly, as if they, too, were
weary."Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death--"

The man in the chair stirred.He had come through the valley of the
shadow, and for what?He said to himself savagely
that they would better have let him die."You say you never loved me
because you never knew me.Isn't it possible
that the man you, cared about, who--who did his best by people and all
that--is the real me?"He missed something out of her eyes, the
sort of luminous, wistful look with which she had been wont to survey
his greatness.Measured by this new glance, so clear, so appraising, he
sank back into his chair."The man who did his best is quite real.You have always done the best
in your work; you always will.But the other is a part of you too, Max.John went to the hallway.Even if I cared, I would not dare to run the risk."Under the window rang the sharp gong of a city patrol-wagon.It rumbled
through the gates back to the courtyard, where its continued clamor
summoned white-coated orderlies.Sidney, chin lifted, listened
carefully.If it was a case for her, the elevator would go up to the
operating-room.With a renewed sense of loss, Max saw that already she
had put him out of her mind.The call to service was to her a call to
battle.Her sensitive nostrils quivered; her young figure stood erect,
alert.She took a step toward the door, hesitated, came back, and put a light
hand on his shoulder.She had kissed him lightly on the cheek before he knew what she intended
to do.So passionless was the little caress that, perhaps more than
anything else, it typified the change in their relation.When the door closed behind her, he saw that she had left her ring
on the arm of his chair.He held it to his lips with a quick gesture.In all his
successful young life he had never before felt the bitterness of
failure.He didn't want to live--he wouldn't live.He would--

His eyes, lifted from the ring, fell on the red glow of the roses that
had come that morning.Even in the half light, they glowed with fiery
color.With the left he settled his collar and
soft silk tie.K. saw Carlotta that evening for the last time.Katie brought word to
him, where he was helping Harriet close her trunk,--she was on her way
to Europe for the fall styles,--that he was wanted in the lower hall.she said, closing the door behind her by way of caution."And
a good thing for her she's not from the alley.The way those people beg
off you is a sin and a shame, and it's not at home you're going to be to
them from now on."So K. had put on his coat and, without so much as a glance in Harriet's
mirror, had gone down the stairs.She
stood under the chandelier, and he saw at once the ravages that trouble
had made in her.She was a dead white, and she looked ten years older
than her age.Now and then, when some one came to him for help, which was generally
money, he used Christine's parlor, if she happened to be out.So now,
finding the door ajar, and the room dark, he went in and turned on the
light."Come in here; we can talk better."She did not sit down at first; but, observing that her standing kept him
on his feet, she sat finally."You were to come," K. encouraged her, "to see if we couldn't plan
something for you."If it's another hospital--and I don't want to stay here, in the city.""You like surgical work, don't you?""Before we settle this, I'd better tell you what I'm thinking of.You know, of course, that I closed my hospital.I--a series of things
happened, and I decided I was in the wrong business.That wouldn't be
important, except for what it leads to.They are trying to persuade me
to go back, and--I'm trying to persuade myself that I'm fit to go back.You see,"--his tone was determinedly cheerful, "my faith in myself has
been pretty nearly gone.When one loses that, there isn't much left.""Well, I had and I hadn't.I'm not going to worry you about that.My
offer is this: We'll just try to forget about--about Schwitter's and all
the rest, and if I go back I'll take you on in the operating-room.""Well, I can ask you to come back, can't I?"He smiled at her
encouragingly."Are you sure you understand about Max Wilson and myself?""Don't you think you are taking a risk?""Every one makes mistakes now and then, and loving women have made
mistakes since the world began.Most people live in glass houses, Miss
Harrison.And don't make any mistake about this: people can always come
back.But the offer
he made was too alluring.It meant reinstatement, another chance, when
she had thought everything was over.After all, why should she damn
herself?She would work her finger-ends off for him.She would make it up to him in other ways.But she could not tell him
and lose everything."Shall we go back and start over again?"CHAPTER XXIX


Late September had come, with the Street, after its summer indolence
taking up the burden of the year.At eight-thirty and at one the school
bell called the children.Little girls in pig-tails, carrying freshly
sharpened pencils, went primly toward the school, gathering, comet
fashion, a tail of unwilling brothers as they went.Le Moyne had promised
the baseball club a football outfit, rumor said, but would not coach
them himself this year.Le Moyne
intended to go away.The Street had been furiously busy for a month.The cobblestones had
gone, and from curb to curb stretched smooth asphalt.The fascination
of writing on it with chalk still obsessed the children.Every few yards
was a hop-scotch diagram.Generally speaking, too, the Street had put up
new curtains, and even, here and there, had added a coat of paint.To this general excitement the strange case of Mr.One day he was in the gas office, making out statements that
were absolutely ridiculous.(What with no baking all last month, and
every Sunday spent in the country, nobody could have used that amount of
gas.They could come and take their old meter out!)And the next there
was the news that Mr.Le Moyne had been only taking a holiday in the
gas office,--paying off old scores, the barytone at Mrs.McKee's
hazarded!--and that he was really a very great surgeon and had saved Dr.The Street, which was busy at the time deciding whether to leave the old
sidewalks or to put down cement ones, had one evening of mad excitement
over the matter,--of K., not the sidewalks,--and then had accepted the
new situation.What was
the matter with things, anyhow?Here was Christine's marriage, which had
promised so well,--awnings and palms and everything,--turning out badly.True, Palmer Howe was doing better, but he would break out again.And
Johnny Rosenfeld was dead, so that his mother came on washing-days,
and brought no cheery gossip; but bent over her tubs dry-eyed and
silent--even the approaching move to a larger house failed to thrill
her.She was
married now, of course; but the Street did not tolerate such a reversal
of the usual processes as Tillie had indulged in.McKee
severely for having been, so to speak, and accessory after the fact.The Street made a resolve to keep K., if possible.If he had shown
any "high and mightiness," as they called it, since the change in his
estate, it would have let him go without protest.But when a man is the
real thing,--so that the newspapers give a column to his having been
in the city almost two years,--and still goes about in the same shabby
clothes, with the same friendly greeting for every one, it demonstrates
clearly, as the barytone put it, that "he's got no swelled head on him;
that's sure.""Anybody can see by the way he drives that machine of Wilson's that he's
been used to a car--likely a foreign one.Still the barytone, who was almost as fond of conversation as
of what he termed "vocal."Do you notice the way
he takes Dr.The old boy's
tickled to death."A little later, K., coming up the Street as he had that first day, heard
the barytone singing:--

      "Home is the hunter, home from the hill,
       And the sailor, home from sea."The Street seemed to stretch out its arms to
him.The ailanthus tree waved in the sunlight before the little house.Tree and house were old; September had touched them.Christine sat
sewing on the balcony.A boy with a piece of chalk was writing something
on the new cement under the tree.He stood back, head on one side, when
he had finished, and inspected his work.K. caught him up from behind,
and, swinging him around--

"Hey!""Don't you know better than to write all over
the street?"Aw, lemme down, Mr."You tell the boys that if I find this street scrawled over any more,
the picnic's off."Go and spend some of that chalk energy of yours in school."There was a certain tenderness in his hands, as in
his voice, when he dealt with children.'s eye fell on what he had written on the cement.At a certain part of his career, the child of such a neighborhood as the
Street "cancels" names.He does it as he
whittles his school desk or tries to smoke the long dried fruit of the
Indian cigar tree.So K. read in chalk an the smooth street:--

     Max Wilson Marriage.[Note: the a, l, s, and n of "Max Wilson" are crossed through, as are
the S, d, n, and a of "Sidney Page"]

The childish scrawl stared up at him impudently, a sacred thing profaned
by the day.The barytone was still singing;
but now it was "I'm twenty-one, and she's eighteen."It was a cheerful
air, as should be the air that had accompanied Johnny Rosenfeld to his
long sleep.After all, the
Street meant for him not so much home as it meant Sidney.And now,
before very long, that book of his life, like others, would have to be
closed.He turned and went heavily into the little house.Christine called to him from her little balcony:--

"I thought I heard your step outside.K. went through the parlor and stood in the long window.His steady eyes
looked down at her."I see very little of you now," she complained.And, when he did not
reply immediately: "Have you made any definite plans, K.?""I shall do Max's work until he is able to take hold again.After
that--"

"You will go away?"I am getting a good many letters, one way and another.I
suppose, now I'm back in harness, I'll stay.I'd
go back there--they want me.But it seems so futile, Christine, to leave
as I did, because I felt that I had no right to go on as things were;
and now to crawl back on the strength of having had my hand forced, and
to take up things again, not knowing that I've a bit more right to do it
than when I left!"He took an uneasy turn up and down the balcony.I tell you,
Christine, it isn't possible."Her thoughts had flown ahead to the
little house without K., to days without his steps on the stairs or the
heavy creak of his big chair overhead as he dropped into it.But perhaps it would be better if he went.She had no expectation of happiness, but, somehow or other, she must
build on the shaky foundation of her marriage a house of life, with
resignation serving for content, perhaps with fear lurking always.Misery implied affection, and her
love for Palmer was quite dead."Sidney will be here this afternoon.""Has it occurred to you, K., that Sidney is not very happy?""I'm not quite sure, but I think I know.She's lost faith in Max, and
she's not like me.I--I knew about Palmer before I married him.It's all rather hideous--I needn't go into it.I was afraid to
back out; it was just before my wedding.But Sidney has more character
than I have.Max isn't what she thought he was, and I doubt whether
she'll marry him."K. glanced toward the street where Sidney's name and Max's lay open to
the sun and to the smiles of the Street.Christine might be right, but
that did not alter things for him.Christine's thoughts went back inevitably to herself; to Palmer, who was
doing better just now; to K., who was going away--went back with an ache
to the night K. had taken her in his arms and then put her away."When you go away," she said at last, "I want you to remember this.I'm
going to do my best, K. You have taught me all I know.All my life I'll
have to overlook things; I know that.But, in his way, Palmer cares for
me.He will always come back, and perhaps sometime--"

Her voice trailed off.Far ahead of her she saw the years stretching
out, marked, not by days and months, but by Palmer's wanderings away,
his remorseful returns."Do a little more than forgetting," K. said."Try to care for him,
Christine.It's always a
woman's strongest weapon."I shall try, K.," she answered obediently.But he turned away from the look in her eyes.She had sent cards from Paris to her "trade."The two or three people on the Street who received her
engraved announcement that she was there, "buying new chic models
for the autumn and winter--afternoon frocks, evening gowns, reception
dresses, and wraps, from Poiret, Martial et Armand, and others," left
the envelopes casually on the parlor table, as if communications from
Paris were quite to be expected.So K. lunched alone, and ate little.After luncheon he fixed a broken
ironing-stand for Katie, and in return she pressed a pair of trousers
for him.He had it in mind to ask Sidney to go out with him in Max's
car, and his most presentable suit was very shabby."I'm thinking," said Katie, when she brought the pressed garments up
over her arm and passed them in through a discreet crack in the door,
"that these pants will stand more walking than sitting, Mr."I'll take a duster along in case of accident," he promised her; "and
to-morrow I'll order a suit, Katie.""I'll believe it when I see it," said Katie from the stairs."Some fool
of a woman from the alley will come in to-night and tell you she can't
pay her rent, and she'll take your suit away in her pocket-book--as like
as not to pay an installment on a piano.There's two new pianos in the
alley since you came here.""Show it to me," said Katie laconically."And don't go to picking up
anything you drop!"Sidney came home at half-past two--came delicately flushed, as if she
had hurried, and with a tremulous smile that caught Katie's eye at once."There's no need to ask how he is to-day."Katie, some one has written my name out on the street, in chalk."I'm about crazy with their old chalk.But when she learned that K. was upstairs, oddly enough, she did not go
up at once.Her lips parted slightly as she
listened.Christine, looking in from her balcony, saw her there, and, seeing
something in her face that she had never suspected, put her hand to her
throat."Won't you come and sit with me?""I haven't much time--that is, I want to speak to K.""You can see him when he comes down."Sidney came slowly through the parlor.It occurred to her, all at once,
that Christine must see a lot of K., especially now.No doubt he was
in and out of the house often.All that seemed to be necessary to win K.Well, surely, in that case--

"How is Max?"Sidney sat down on the edge of the railing; but she was careful,
Christine saw, to face the staircase.Christine sewed; Sidney sat and swung her feet idly.Ed says Max wants you to give up your training and marry him now.""I'm not going to marry him at all, Chris."It was one of his failings that he always
slammed doors.Harriet used to be quite disagreeable about it.Perhaps, in all her frivolous, selfish life, Christine had never had a
bigger moment than the one that followed.She could have said nothing,
and, in the queer way that life goes, K. might have gone away from the
Street as empty of heart as he had come to it."Be very good to him, Sidney," she said unsteadily.CHAPTER XXX


K. was being very dense.For so long had he considered Sidney as
unattainable that now his masculine mind, a little weary with much
wretchedness, refused to move from its old attitude."It was glamour, that was all, K.," said Sidney bravely."But, perhaps," said K., "it's just because of that miserable incident
with Carlotta.That wasn't the right thing, of course, but Max has told
me the story.She fainted in the yard,
and--"

Sidney was exasperated."Do you want me to marry him, K.?""I want you to be happy, dear."They were on the terrace of the White Springs Hotel again.K. had
ordered dinner, making a great to-do about getting the dishes they both
liked.But now that it was there, they were not eating.K. had placed
his chair so that his profile was turned toward her.He had worn the
duster religiously until nightfall, and then had discarded it.It hung
limp and dejected on the back of his chair.'s profile Sidney
could see the magnolia tree shaped like a heart."It seems to me," said Sidney suddenly, "that you are kind to every one
but me, K."He fairly stammered his astonishment:--

"Why, what on earth have I done?""You are trying to make me marry Max, aren't you?"She was very properly ashamed of that, and, when he failed of reply out
of sheer inability to think of one that would not say too much, she went
hastily to something else:

"It is hard for me to realize that you--that you lived a life of your
own, a busy life, doing useful things, before you came to us.I wish you
would tell me something about yourself.If we're to be friends when you
go away,"--she had to stop there, for the lump in her throat--"I'll want
to know how to think of you,--who your friends are,--all that."He was thinking, of course, that he would be
visualizing her, in the hospital, in the little house on its side
street, as she looked just then, her eyes like stars, her lips just
parted, her hands folded before her on the table."I shall be working," he said at last."Does that mean you won't have time to think of me?""I'm afraid I'm stupider than usual to-night.You can think of me as
never forgetting you or the Street, working or playing."Of course he would not work all the time.And he was going back
to his old friends, to people who had always known him, to girls--

He did his best then.He told her of the old family house, built by one
of his forebears who had been a king's man until Washington had put the
case for the colonies, and who had given himself and his oldest son then
to the cause that he made his own.He told of old servants who had wept
when he decided to close the house and go away.When she fell silent, he
thought he was interesting her.He told her the family traditions that
had been the fairy tales of his childhood.He described the library, the
choice room of the house, full of family paintings in old gilt frames,
and of his father's collection of books.Because it was home, he waxed
warm over it at last, although it had rather hurt him at first to
remember.It brought back the other things that he wanted to forget.Side by side with the
wonders he described so casually, she was placing the little house.What
an exile it must have been for him!How hopelessly middle-class they
must have seemed!How idiotic of her to think, for one moment, that she
could ever belong in this new-old life of his!None, of course, save to be honest and good
and to do her best for the people around her.Her mother's people, the
Kennedys went back a long way, but they had always been poor.She remembered the lamp with the blue-silk
shade, the figure of Eve that used to stand behind the minister's
portrait, and the cherry bookcase with the Encyclopaedia in it and
"Beacon Lights of History."When K., trying his best to interest her and
to conceal his own heaviness of spirit, told her of his grandfather's
old carriage, she sat back in the shadow."Fearful old thing," said K.,--"regular cabriolet.I can remember yet
the family rows over it.But the old gentleman liked it--used to have
it repainted every year.Strangers in the city used to turn around and
stare at it--thought it was advertising something!""When I was a child," said Sidney quietly, "and a carriage drove up and
stopped on the Street, I always knew some one had died!"K., whose ear was attuned to
every note in her voice, looked at her quickly."My great-grandfather,"
said Sidney in the same tone, "sold chickens at market.He didn't do it
himself; but the fact's there, isn't it?"But Sidney's agile mind had already traveled on.This K. she had never
known, who had lived in a wonderful house, and all the rest of it--he
must have known numbers of lovely women, his own sort of women, who had
traveled and knew all kinds of things: girls like the daughters of the
Executive Committee who came in from their country places in summer
with great armfuls of flowers, and hurried off, after consulting their
jeweled watches, to luncheon or tea or tennis."Tell me about the women you have known,
your friends, the ones you liked and the ones who liked you.""I've always been so busy," he confessed."I know a lot, but I don't
think they would interest you.They don't do anything, you know--they
travel around and have a good time.They're rather nice to look at, some
of them.But when you've said that you've said it all."Of course they would be, with nothing else to think of
in all the world but of how they looked.She wanted to go back to the hospital,
and turn the key in the door of her little room, and lie with her face
down on the bed."Would you mind very much if I asked you to take me back?"He had a depressed feeling that the evening had failed.And his depression grew as he brought the car around.After all, a girl couldn't care as
she had for a year and a half, and then give a man up because of another
woman, without a wrench."Do you really want to go home, Sidney, or were you tired of sitting
there?In that case, we could drive around for an hour or two.I'll not
talk if you'd like to be quiet."Being with K. had become an agony, now
that she realized how wrong Christine had been, and that their worlds,
hers and K.Soon they would be separated
by as wide a gulf as that which lay between the cherry bookcase--for
instance,--and a book-lined library hung with family portraits.But she
was not disposed to skimp as to agony.She would go through with it,
every word a stab, if only she might sit beside K. a little longer,
might feel the touch of his old gray coat against her arm."I'd like to
ride, if you don't mind."K. turned the automobile toward the country roads.He was remembering
acutely that other ride after Joe in his small car, the trouble he
had had to get a machine, the fear of he knew not what ahead, and his
arrival at last at the road-house, to find Max lying at the head of the
stairs and Carlotta on her knees beside him."Was there anybody you cared about,--any girl,--when you left home?""I was not in love with anyone, if that's what you mean.""You knew Max before, didn't you?""If you knew things about him that I should have known, why didn't you
tell me?""I couldn't do that, could I?It seemed to me that the mere
fact of your caring for him--" That was shaky ground; he got off it
quickly.Schwitter's had closed up, indeed.The lanterns had been taken down,
and in the dusk they could see Tillie rocking her baby on the porch.As
if to cover the last traces of his late infamy, Schwitter himself was
watering the worn places on the lawn with the garden can.Above the low hum of the engine they could hear
Tillie's voice, flat and unmusical, but filled with the harmonies of
love as she sang to the child.When they had left the house far behind, K. was suddenly aware that
Sidney was crying.She sat with her head turned away, using her
handkerchief stealthily.He drew the car up beside the road, and in a
masterful fashion turned her shoulders about until she faced him."Now, tell me about it," he said.I'm--I'm a little bit lonely.""Aunt Harriet's in Paris, and with Joe gone and everybody--"

"Aunt Harriet!"If she had said she was lonely
because the cherry bookcase was in Paris, he could not have been more
bewildered."And with you going away and never coming back--"

"I'll come back, of course.I'll promise to come back when
you graduate, and send you flowers.""I think," said Sidney, "that I'll become an army nurse.""You won't know, K. You'll be back with your old friends.You'll have
forgotten the Street and all of us.""Girls who have been everywhere, and have lovely clothes, and who won't
know a T bandage from a figure eight!""There will never be anybody in the world like you to me, dear."I--who have wanted you so long that it hurts even to
think about it!Ever since the night I came up the Street, and you were
sitting there on the steps--oh, my dear, my dear, if you only cared a
little!"Because he was afraid that he would get out of hand and take her in his
arms,--which would be idiotic, since, of course, she did not care for
him that way,--he gripped the steering-wheel.It gave him a curious
appearance of making a pathetic appeal to the wind-shield."I have been trying to make you say that all evening!""I
love you so much that--K., won't you take me in your arms?"He held her to him and
muttered incoherencies until she gasped.It was as if he must make up
for long arrears of hopelessness.He held her off a bit to look at her,
as if to be sure it was she and no changeling, and as if he wanted her
eyes to corroborate her lips.There was no lack of confession in her
eyes; they showed him a new heaven and a new earth."It was you always, K.," she confessed.But
now, when you look back, don't you see it was?"He looked back over the months when she had seemed as unattainable as
the stars, and he did not see it."Not when I came to you with everything?I brought you all my troubles,
and you always helped."She bent down and kissed one of his hands.He was so
happy that the foolish little caress made his heart hammer in his ears."I think, K., that is how one can always tell when it is the right one,
and will be the right one forever and ever.It is the person--one goes
to in trouble."He had no words for that, only little caressing touches of her arm, her
hand.Perhaps, without knowing it, he was formulating a sort of prayer
that, since there must be troubles, she would, always come to him and he
would always be able to help her.She was recalling the day she became
engaged to Max, and the lost feeling she had had.She did not feel the
same at all now.She felt as if she had been wandering, and had come
home to the arms that were about her.She would be married, and take the
risk that all women took, with her eyes open.She would go through the
valley of the shadow, as other women did; but K. would be with her.Looking into his steady eyes, she knew that she
was safe.Where before she had felt the clutch of inexorable destiny, the woman's
fate, now she felt only his arms about her, her cheek on his shabby
coat."I shall love you all my life," she said shakily.The little house was dark when they got back to it.The Street, which
had heard that Mr.Le Moyne approved of night air, was raising its
windows for the night and pinning cheesecloth bags over its curtains to
keep them clean.In the second-story front room at Mrs.McKee's, the barytone slept
heavily, and made divers unvocal sounds.He was hardening his throat,
and so slept with a wet towel about it.Wagner sat and made love with
the aid of a lighted match and the pencil-pad.The car drew up at the little house, and Sidney got out.Then it drove
away, for K. must take it to the garage and walk back.Sidney sat on the doorstep and waited.If one did one's best by life, it did its best too.She saw the flicker of the match across the
street, and knew what it meant.Once she would have thought that that
was funny; now it seemed very touching to her.Katie had heard the car, and now she came heavily along the hall."If you think it's a begging
letter, you'd better keep it until he's bought his new suit to-morrow.Almost any moment he's likely to bust out."K. read it in the hall, with Sidney's
shining eyes on him.It began abruptly:--

"I'm going to Africa with one of my cousins.It is a bad station on
the West Coast.I am not going because I feel any call to the work, but
because I do not know what else to do."You were kind to me the other day.I believe, if I had told you then,
you would still have been kind.I tried to tell you, but I was so
terribly afraid."If I caused death, I did not mean to.You will think that no excuse,
but it is true.In the hospital, when I changed the bottles on Miss
Page's medicine-tray, I did not care much what happened.I had been careless about a sponge
count.I made up my mind to get back at you.It seemed hopeless--you
were so secure.For two or three days I tried to think of some way to
hurt you."You remember the packets of gauze sponges we made and used in the
operating-room?When we counted them
as we got them out, we counted by packages.On the night before I left,
I went to the operating-room and added one sponge every here and there.Out of every dozen packets, perhaps, I fixed one that had thirteen.I had meant to give you
trouble, so you would have to do certain cases a second time.I was so frightened that I went down sick over it.When
I got better, I heard you had lost a case and the cause was being
whispered about."I tried to get back into the hospital one night.I went up the
fire-escape, but the windows were locked."I am not going to sign this letter.And I am
not going to ask your forgiveness, or anything of that sort.But one thing hurt me more than anything else, the other
night.You said you'd lost your faith in yourself.This is to tell you
that you need not.And you said something else--that any one can 'come
back.'K. stood in the hall of the little house with the letter in his hand.Just beyond on the doorstep was Sidney, waiting for him.His arms were
still warm from the touch of her.Beyond lay the Street, and beyond that
lay the world and a man's work to do.Work, and faith to do it, a good
woman's hand in the dark, a Providence that made things right in the
end.And, when he was beside her, his long figure folded
to the short measure of the step, he stooped humbly and kissed the hem
of her soft white dress.Wagner wrote something in the dark and then
lighted a match."So K. is in love with Sidney Page, after all!""She
is a sweet girl, and he is every inch a man.But, to my mind, a certain
lady--"

Mrs.McKee flushed and blew out the match.Late September now on the Street, with Joe gone and his mother eyeing
the postman with pitiful eagerness; with Mrs.Rosenfeld moving heavily
about the setting-up of the new furniture; and with Johnny driving
heavenly cars, brake and clutch legs well and Strong.Late September,
with Max recovering and settling his tie for any pretty nurse who
happened along, but listening eagerly for Dr.Ed's square tread in the
hall; with Tillie rocking her baby on the porch at Schwitter's, and
Carlotta staring westward over rolling seas; with Christine taking up
her burden and Grace laying hers down; with Joe's tragic young eyes
growing quiet with the peace of the tropics."The Lord is my shepherd," she reads."Yea, though
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."Sidney, on her knees in the little parlor, repeats the words with the
others.K. has gone from the Street, and before long she will join him.With the vision of his steady eyes before her, she adds her own prayer
to the others--that the touch of his arms about her may not make her
forget the vow she has taken, of charity and its sister, service, of a
cup of water to the thirsty, of open arms to a tired child.Beware!--But hark, what sounds are these?My dull ears catch no faltering breeze;
    No weeping birch, nor aspens wake,
    Nor breath is dimpling in the lake;
    Still is the canna's[117] hoary beard;
    Yet, by my minstrel faith, I heard--
    And hark again!some pipe of war
    Sends the bold pibroch from afar."[115] Archibald Douglas, so called because so many of his enterprises
ended in _tine_ (or "distress").After being defeated by Harry Hotspur
at Homildon Hill in 1402, he joined Hotspur in his rebellion against
Henry IV., and in the following year was with him disastrously defeated
at Shrewsbury.[116] The Celtic festival celebrated about the 1st of May.Far up the lengthen'd lake were spied
    Four darkening specks upon the tide,
    That, slow enlarging on the view,
    Four mann'd and masted barges grew,
    And, bearing downwards from Glengyle,
    Steer'd full upon the lonely isle;
    The point of Brianchoil[118] they pass'd,
    And, to the windward as they cast,
    Against the sun they gave to shine
    The bold Sir Roderick's banner'd Pine.[119]
    Nearer and nearer as they bear,
    Spears, pikes, and axes flash in air.Now might you see the tartans brave,[120]
    And plaids and plumage dance and wave:
    Now see the bonnets[121] sink and rise,
    As his tough oar the rower plies;
    See, flashing at each sturdy stroke,
    The wave ascending into smoke;
    See the proud pipers on the bow,
    And mark the gaudy streamers[122] flow
    From their loud chanters down, and sweep
    The furrow'd bosom of the deep,
    As, rushing through the lake amain,
    They plied the ancient Highland strain.[118] A promontory on the north bank of Loch Katrine.[119] The badge or crest of the MacGregors.[122] Ribbons attached to the chanters or tubes of a bagpipe for
decoration.Ever, as on they bore, more loud
    And louder rung the pibroch proud.At first the sound, by distance tame,
    Mellow'd along the waters came,
    And, lingering long by cape and bay,
    Wail'd every harsher note away;
    Then, bursting bolder on the ear,
    The clan's shrill Gathering they could hear;
    Those thrilling sounds, that call the might
    Of old Clan-Alpine to the fight.Thick beat the rapid notes, as when
    The mustering hundreds shake the glen,
    And, hurrying at the signal dread,
    The batter'd earth returns their tread.Then prelude light, of livelier tone,
    Express'd their merry marching on,
    Ere peal of closing battle rose,
    With mingled outcry, shrieks, and blows;
    And mimic din of stroke and ward,
    As broadsword upon target jarr'd;
    And groaning pause, ere yet again,
    Condensed, the battle yell'd amain;
    The rapid charge, the rallying shout,
    Retreat borne headlong into rout,
    And bursts of triumph, to declare
    Clan-Alpine's conquests--all were there.Nor ended thus the strain; but slow,
    Sunk in a moan prolong'd and low,
    And changed the conquering clarion swell,
    For wild lament o'er those that fell.The war pipes ceased; but lake and hill
    Were busy with their echoes still;
    And, when they slept, a vocal strain
    Bade their hoarse chorus wake again,
    While loud a hundred clansmen raise
    Their voices in their Chieftain's praise.Each boatman, bending to his oar,
    With measured sweep the burden[123] bore,
    In such wild cadence as the breeze
    Makes through December's leafless trees.The chorus first could Allan know,
    "Roderick Vich Alpine, ho!And near, and nearer as they row'd,
    Distinct the martial ditty flow'd.Hail to the Chief who in triumph advances!Honor'd and bless'd be the ever-green Pine!Long may the tree, in his banner that glances,
      Flourish, the shelter and grace of our line!Heaven send it happy dew,
          Earth lend it sap anew,
      Gayly to bourgeon,[124] and broadly to grow,
          While every Highland glen
          Sends our shout back agen,[125]
      "Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu,[126] ho!Ours is no sapling, chance-sown by the fountain,
      Blooming at Beltane, in winter to fade;
    When the whirlwind has stripp'd every leaf on the mountain,

    Had Lady Margaret sought the strand.Loose on the breeze their tresses flew,
    And high their snowy arms they threw,
    As echoing back with shrill acclaim,
    And chorus wild, the Chieftain's name;
    While prompt to please, with mother's art,
    The darling passion of his heart,
    The Dame call'd Ellen to the strand,
    To greet her kinsman ere he land:
    "Come, loiterer, come!a Douglas thou,
    And shun to wreathe a victor's brow?"Reluctantly and slow, the maid
    The unwelcome summoning obey'd,
    And, when a distant bugle rung,
    In the mid-path aside she sprung:--
    "List, Allan-Bane!From mainland cast,
    I hear my father's signal blast.Be ours," she cried, "the skiff to guide,
    And waft him from the mountain side."Then, like a sunbeam, swift and bright,
    She darted to her shallop light,
    And, eagerly while Roderick scann'd,
    For her dear form, his mother's band,
    The islet far behind her lay,
    And she had landed in the bay.Some feelings are to mortals given,
    With less of earth in them than heaven:
    And if there be a human tear
    From passion's dross refined and clear,
    A tear so limpid and so meek,
    It would not stain an angel's cheek,
    'Tis that which pious fathers shed
    Upon a duteous daughter's head!And as the Douglas to his breast
    His darling Ellen closely press'd,
    Such holy drops her tresses steep'd,
    Though 'twas an hero's eye that weep'd.Nor while on Ellen's faltering tongue
    Her filial welcomes crowded hung,
    Mark'd she, that fear (affection's proof)
    Still held a graceful youth aloof;
    No!not till Douglas named his name,
    Although the youth was Malcolm Graeme.Allan, with wistful look the while,
    Mark'd Roderick landing on the isle;
    His master piteously he eyed,
    Then gazed upon the Chieftain's pride,
    Then dash'd, with hasty hand, away
    From his dimm'd eye the gathering spray;
    And Douglas, as his hand he laid
    On Malcolm's shoulder, kindly said,
    "Canst thou, young friend, no meaning spy
    In my poor follower's glistening eye?I'll tell thee:--he recalls the day
    When in my praise he led the lay
    O'er the arch'd gate of Bothwell proud,
    While many a minstrel answer'd loud,
    When Percy's Norman pennon,[133] won
    In bloody field, before me shone,
    And twice ten knights, the least a name
    As mighty as yon Chief may claim,
    Gracing my pomp, behind me came.Yet trust me, Malcolm, not so proud
    Was I of all that marshal'd crowd,
    Though the waned crescent[134] own'd my might,
    And in my train troop'd lord and knight,
    Though Blantyre[135] hymn'd her holiest lays,
    And Bothwell's bards flung back my praise,
    As when this old man's silent tear,
    And this poor maid's affection dear,
    A welcome give more kind and true,
    Than aught my better fortunes knew.Forgive, my friend, a father's boast,
    Oh!it out-beggars[136] all I lost!"[133] The battle flag which Earl Douglas won from Hotspur at Newcastle
in 1388.[134] A crescent was one of the badges of the Percies.[135] An abbey near Bothwell Castle.Delightful praise!--Like summer rose,
    That brighter in the dewdrop glows,
    The bashful maiden's cheek appear'd,
    For Douglas spoke, and Malcolm heard.The flush of shamefaced joy to hide,
    The hounds, the hawk, her cares divide;
    The loved caresses of the maid
    The dogs with crouch and whimper paid;
    And, at her whistle, on her hand
    The falcon took his favorite stand,
    Closed his dark wing, relax'd his eye,
    Nor, though unhooded,[137] sought to fly.And, trust, while in such guise she stood,
    Like fabled goddess[138] of the wood,
    That if a father's partial thought
    O'erweigh'd her worth and beauty aught,
    Well might the lover's judgment fail
    To balance with a juster scale;
    For with each secret glance he stole,
    The fond enthusiast sent his soul.[137] Hawks or falcons were trained to pursue small game during the
middle ages.When not in flight, they were usually blinded by means of
a hood adorned with little bells.[138] Ellen, surrounded by the hounds and with the falcon on her hand,
is likened to Diana, the goddess of the chase, in Greek mythology.Of stature tall, and slender frame,
    But firmly knit, was Malcolm Graeme.The belted plaid and tartan hose
    Did ne'er more graceful limbs disclose;
    His flaxen hair, of sunny hue,
    Curl'd closely round his bonnet blue.Train'd to the chase, his eagle eye
    The ptarmigan in snow could spy:
    Each pass, by mountain, lake, and heath,
    He knew, through Lennox and Menteith;
    Vain was the bound of dark-brown doe
    When Malcolm bent his sounding bow;
    And scarce that doe, though wing'd with fear,
    Outstripp'd in speed the mountaineer:
    Right up Ben-Lomond could he press,
    And not a sob his toil confess.His form accorded with a mind
    Lively and ardent, frank and kind;
    A blither heart, till Ellen came,
    Did never love nor sorrow tame;
    It danced as lightsome in his breast,
    As play'd the feather on his crest.Yet friends, who nearest knew the youth,
    His scorn of wrong, his zeal for truth,
    And bards, who saw his features bold,
    When kindled by the tales of old,
    Said, were that youth to manhood grown,
    Not long should Roderick Dhu's renown
    Be foremost voiced by mountain fame,
    But quail to that of Malcolm Graeme.Now back they wend their watery way,
    And, "O my sire!"did Ellen say,
    "Why urge thy chase so far astray?And why"--
    The rest was in her speaking eye."My child, the chase I follow far,
    'Tis mimicry of noble war;
    And with that gallant pastime reft
    Were all of Douglas I have left.I met young Malcolm as I stray'd
    Far eastward, in Glenfinlas' shade.Nor stray'd I safe; for, all around,
    Hunters and horsemen scour'd the ground.This youth, though still a royal ward,[139]
    Risk'd life and land to be my guard,
    And through the passes of the wood
    Guided my steps, not unpursued;
    And Roderick shall his welcome make,
    Despite old spleen,[140] for Douglas' sake.Then must he seek Strath-Endrick glen,
    Nor peril aught for me agen."[139] "Royal ward," i.e., under the guardianship of the King, Douglas's
chief enemy.Sir Roderick, who to meet them came,
    Redden'd at sight of Malcolm Graeme,
    Yet not in action, word, or eye,
    Fail'd aught in hospitality.In talk and sport they whiled away
    The morning of that summer day;
    But at high noon a courier light
    Held secret parley with the Knight,
    Whose moody aspect soon declared
    That evil were the news he heard.Deep thought seem'd toiling in his head;
    Yet was the evening banquet made,
    Ere he assembled round the flame,
    His mother, Douglas, and the Graeme,
    And Ellen too; then cast around
    His eyes, then fix'd them on the ground,
    As studying phrase that might avail
    Best to convey unpleasant tale.Long with his dagger's hilt he play'd,
    Then raised his haughty brow, and said:--


XXVIII."Short be my speech;--nor time affords,
    Nor my plain temper, glozing[141] words.Kinsman and father,--if such name
    Douglas vouchsafe to Roderick's claim;
    Mine honor'd mother;--Ellen--why,
    My cousin, turn away thine eye?--
    And Graeme; in whom I hope to know--
    Full soon a noble friend or foe,
    When age shall give thee thy command
    And leading in thy native land,--
    List all!--The King's vindictive pride
    Boasts to have tamed the Border-side,
    Where chiefs, with hound and hawk who came
    To share their monarch's silvan game,
    Themselves in bloody toils were snared;
    And when the banquet they prepared,
    And wide their loyal portals flung,
    O'er their own gateway struggling hung.[142]
    Loud cries their blood from Meggat's[143] mead,
    From Yarrow[144] braes,[145] and banks of Tweed,
    Where the lone streams of Ettrick[146] glide,
    And from the silver Teviot's[147] side;
    The dales, where martial clans did ride,
    Are now one sheep-walk,[148] waste and wide.This tyrant of the Scottish throne,
    So faithless and so ruthless known,
    Now hither comes; his end the same,
    The same pretext of silvan game.What grace for Highland Chiefs, judge ye
    By fate of Border chivalry.Yet more; amid Glenfinlas green,
    Douglas, thy stately form was seen--
    This by espial sure I know:
    Your counsel, in the streight I show."[149]

emergency I indicate.Ellen and Margaret fearfully
    Sought comfort in each other's eye,
    Then turn'd their ghastly look, each one,
    This to her sire, that to her son.The hasty color went and came
    In the bold cheek of Malcolm Graeme;
    But from his glance it well appear'd
    'Twas but for Ellen that he fear'd;
    While, sorrowful, but undismay'd,
    The Douglas thus his counsel said:--
    "Brave Roderick, though the tempest roar,
    It may but thunder, and pass o'er;
    Nor will I here remain an hour,
    To draw the lightning on thy bower;
    For well thou know'st, at this gray head
    The royal bolt were fiercest sped.For thee, who, at thy King's command,
    Canst aid him with a gallant band,
    Submission, homage, humbled pride,
    Shall turn the monarch's wrath aside.Poor remnants of the Bleeding Heart,[150]
    Ellen and I will seek, apart,
    The refuge of some forest cell,
    There, like the hunted quarry, dwell,
    Till on the mountain and the moor,
    The stern pursuit be pass'd and o'er.""No, by mine honor," Roderick said,
    "So help me Heaven, and my good blade!Blasted be yon Pine,
    My fathers' ancient crest and mine,
    If from its shade in danger part
    The lineage of the Bleeding Heart!Hear my blunt speech: grant me this maid
    To wife, thy counsel to mine aid;
    To Douglas, leagued with Roderick Dhu,
    Will friends and allies flock enow;[151]
    Like cause of doubt, distrust, and grief,
    Will bind to us each Western Chief.When the loud pipes my bridal tell,
    The Links of Forth[152] shall hear the knell,
    The guards shall start in Stirling's[153] porch;
    And, when I light the nuptial torch,
    A thousand villages in flames
    Shall scare the slumbers of King James!--Nay, Ellen, blench not thus away,
    And, mother, cease these signs, I pray;
    I meant not all my heat might say.Small need of inroad, or of fight,
    When the sage Douglas may unite
    Each mountain clan in friendly band,
    To guard the passes of their land,
    Till the foil'd King, from pathless glen,
    Shall bootless turn him home agen."[152] The windings of the river Forth: hence the inhabitants of that
region.[153] Stirling Castle, on the Forth, below the junction of the Frith,
was a favorite residence of the Scottish kings.There are who have, at midnight hour,
    In slumber scaled a dizzy tower,
    And, on the verge that beetled o'er
    The ocean tide's incessant roar,
    Dream'd calmly out their dangerous dream,
    Till waken'd by the morning beam;
    When, dazzled by the eastern glow,
    Such startler[154] cast his glance below,
    And saw unmeasured depth around,
    And heard unintermitted sound,
    And thought the battled fence[155] so frail,
    It waved like cobweb in the gale;--
    Amid his senses' giddy wheel,
    Did he not desperate impulse feel,
    Headlong to plunge himself below,
    And meet the worst his fears foreshow?--
    Thus, Ellen, dizzy and astound,[156]
    As sudden ruin yawn'd around,
    By crossing[157] terrors wildly toss'd,
    Still for the Douglas fearing most,
    Could scarce the desperate thought withstand,
    To buy his safety with her hand.[155] "Battled fence," i.e., battlemented rampart.Such purpose dread could Malcolm spy
    In Ellen's quivering lip and eye,
    And eager rose to speak--but ere
    His tongue could hurry forth his fear,
    Had Douglas mark'd the hectic strife,
    Where death seem'd combating with life;
    For to her cheek, in feverish flood,
    One instant rush'd the throbbing blood,
    Then ebbing back, with sudden sway,
    Left its domain as wan as clay.he cried,
    "My daughter cannot be thy bride;
    Not that the blush to wooer dear,
    Nor paleness that of maiden fear.It may not be--forgive her, Chief,
    Nor hazard aught for our relief.Against his sovereign, Douglas ne'er
    Will level a rebellious spear.'Twas I that taught his youthful hand
    To rein a steed and wield a brand;
    I see him yet, the princely boy!Not Ellen more my pride and joy;
    I love him still, despite my wrongs,
    By hasty wrath, and slanderous tongues.Oh, seek the grace you well may find,
    Without a cause to mine combined."Twice through the hall the Chieftain strode;
    The waving of his tartans broad,
    And darken'd brow, where wounded pride
    With ire and disappointment vied,
    Seem'd, by the torch's gloomy light,
    Like the ill Demon of the night,
    Stooping his pinions' shadowy sway
    Upon the nighted pilgrim's way:
    But, unrequited Love!thy dart
    Plunged deepest its envenom'd smart,
    And Roderick, with thine anguish stung,
    At length the hand of Douglas wrung,
    While eyes that mock'd at tears before,
    With bitter drops were running o'er.The death pangs of long-cherish'd hope
    Scarce in that ample breast had scope,
    But, struggling with his spirit proud,
    Convulsive heaved its checker'd shroud,[158]
    While every sob--so mute were all--
    Was heard distinctly through the hall.The son's despair, the mother's look,
    Ill might the gentle Ellen brook;
    She rose, and to her side there came,
    To aid her parting steps, the Graeme.[158] "Checker'd shroud," i.e., his tartan plaid.Then Roderick from the Douglas broke--
    As flashes flame through sable smoke,
    Kindling its wreaths, long, dark, and low,
    To one broad blaze of ruddy glow,
    So the deep anguish of despair
    Burst, in fierce jealousy, to air.With stalwart grasp his hand he laid
    On Malcolm's breast and belted plaid:
    "Back, beardless boy!"he sternly said,
    "Back, minion!hold'st thou thus at naught
    The lesson I so lately taught?This roof, the Douglas, and that maid,
    Thank thou for punishment delay'd."Eager as greyhound on his game,
    Fiercely with Roderick grappled Graeme."Perish my name, if aught afford
    Its Chieftain safety save his sword!"Thus as they strove, their desperate hand
    Griped to the dagger or the brand,
    And death had been--but Douglas rose,
    And thrust between the struggling foes
    His giant strength:--"Chieftains, forego!I hold the first who strikes, my foe.--
    Madmen, forbear your frantic jar!is the Douglas fall'n so far,
    His daughter's hand is deem'd the spoil
    Of such dishonorable broil!"Sullen and slowly they unclasp,
    As struck with shame, their desperate grasp,
    And each upon his rival glared,
    With foot advanced, and blade half bared.Ere yet the brands aloft were flung,
    Margaret on Roderick's mantle hung,
    And Malcolm heard his Ellen's scream,
    As falter'd through terrific dream.Then Roderick plunged in sheath his sword,
    And veil'd his wrath in scornful word:
    "Rest safe till morning; pity 'twere
    Such cheek should feel the midnight air!Then mayst thou to James Stuart tell,
    Roderick will keep the lake and fell,[159]
    Nor lackey, with his freeborn clan,
    The pageant pomp of earthly man.More would he of Clan-Alpine know,
    Thou canst our strength and passes show.--
    Malise, what ho!"--his henchman[160] came;
    "Give our safe-conduct[161] to the Graeme."Young Malcolm answer'd, calm and bold,
    "Fear nothing for thy favorite hold;
    The spot an angel deigned to grace
    Is bless'd, though robbers haunt the place.Thy churlish courtesy for those
    Reserve, who fear to be thy foes.As safe to me the mountain way
    At midnight as in blaze of day,
    Though with his boldest at his back,
    Even Roderick Dhu beset the track.--
    Brave Douglas,--lovely Ellen,--nay,
    Naught here of parting will I say.Earth does not hold a lonesome glen
    So secret, but we meet agen.--
    Chieftain!we too shall find an hour,"
    He said, and left the silvan bower.[160] An officer or secretary who attended closely on the chieftain
(from _hengst_, or "horseman," i.e., groom).Old Allan follow'd to the strand,
    (Such was the Douglas's command,)
    And anxious told, how, on the morn,
    The stern Sir Roderick deep had sworn,
    The Fiery Cross[162] should circle o'er
    Dale, glen, and valley, down, and moor.Much were the peril to the Graeme,
    From those who to the signal came;
    Far up the lake 'twere safest land,
    Himself would row him to the strand.He gave his counsel to the wind,
    While Malcolm did, unheeding, bind,
    Round dirk and pouch and broadsword roll'd,
    His ample plaid in tighten'd fold,
    And stripp'd his limbs to such array
    As best might suit the watery way,--

[162] See Note 4, p.Then spoke abrupt: "Farewell to thee,
    Pattern of old fidelity!"The Minstrel's hand he kindly press'd,--
    "Oh!My sovereign holds in ward my land,
    My uncle leads my vassal band;
    To tame his foes, his friends to aid,
    Poor Malcolm has but heart and blade.Yet, if there be one faithful Graeme
    Who loves the Chieftain of his name,
    Not long shall honor'd Douglas dwell,
    Like hunted stag, in mountain cell;
    Nor, ere yon pride-swoll'n robber dare,--
    I may not give the rest to air!Tell Roderick Dhu, I owed him naught,
    Not the poor service of a boat,
    To waft me to yon mountain side."Bold o'er the flood his head he bore,
    And stoutly steer'd him from the shore;
    And Allan strain'd his anxious eye,
    Far'mid the lake his form to spy,
    Darkening across each puny wave,
    To which the moon her silver gave.Fast as the cormorant could skim,
    The swimmer plied each active limb;
    Then landing in the moonlight dell,
    Loud shouted, of his weal to tell.The Minstrel heard the far halloo,
    And joyful from the shore withdrew.I.

    Time rolls his ceaseless course.The race of yore,
      Who danced our infancy upon their knee,
    And told our marveling boyhood legends store,
      Of their strange ventures happ'd[163] by land or sea,
    How are they blotted from the things that be!How few, all weak and wither'd of their force,
    Wait on the verge of dark eternity,
      Like stranded wrecks, the tide returning hoarse,
    To sweep them from our sight!Yet live there still who[164] can remember well,
      How, when a mountain chief his bugle blew,
    Both field and forest, dingle, cliff, and dell,
      And solitary heath, the signal knew;
    And fast the faithful clan around him drew,
      What time[165] the warning note was keenly wound,
    What time aloft their kindred banner flew,
      While clamorous war pipes yell'd the gathering sound,
    And while the Fiery Cross[166] glanced, like a meteor, round.[163] "Ventures happ'd," i.e., adventures which happened.[165] "What time," i.e., when.[166] When a chieftain wished to assemble his clan suddenly, he sent
out a swift and trusty messenger, bearing a symbol, called the Fiery
Cross, consisting of a rough wooden cross the charred ends of which
had been quenched in the blood of a goat.All members of the clan who
saw this symbol, and who were capable of bearing arms, were obliged
to appear in arms forthwith at the appointed rendezvous.Arrived at
the next hamlet, the messenger delivered the symbol and the name of
the rendezvous to the principal personage, who immediately forwarded
them by a fresh messenger.In this way the signal for gathering was
disseminated throughout the territory of a large clan in a surprisingly
short space of time.The summer dawn's reflected hue
    To purple changed Loch Katrine blue;
    Mildly and soft the western breeze
    Just kiss'd the lake, just stirr'd the trees;
    And the pleased lake, like maiden coy,
    Trembled but dimpled not for joy;
    The mountain shadows on her breast
    Were neither broken nor at rest;
    In bright uncertainty they lie,
    Like future joys to Fancy's eye.The water lily to the light
    Her chalice rear'd of silver bright;
    The doe awoke, and to the lawn,
    Begemm'd with dewdrops, led her fawn;
    The gray mist left the mountain side,
    The torrent show'd its glistening pride;
    Invisible in flecked sky,
    The lark sent down her revelry;
    The blackbird and the speckled thrush
    Good-morrow gave from brake and bush;
    In answer coo'd the cushat dove
    Her notes of peace, and rest, and love.No thought of peace, no thought of rest,
    Assuaged the storm in Roderick's breast.With sheathed broadsword in his hand,
    Abrupt he paced the islet strand,
    And eyed the rising sun, and laid
    His hand on his impatient blade.Beneath a rock, his vassals' care
    Was prompt the ritual[167] to prepare,
    With deep and deathful meaning fraught;
    For such Antiquity had taught
    Was preface meet, ere yet abroad
    The Cross of Fire should take its road.The shrinking band stood oft aghast
    At the impatient glance he cast;--
    Such glance the mountain eagle threw,
    As, from the cliffs of Benvenue,
    She spread her dark sails on the wind,
    And, high in middle heaven reclined,
    With her broad shadow on the lake,
    Silenced the warblers of the brake.[167] The ritual or religious ceremony with which the Fiery Cross was
made.A heap of wither'd boughs was piled,
    Of juniper and rowan[168] wild,
    Mingled with shivers from the oak,
    Rent by the lightning's recent stroke.Brian, the Hermit, by it stood,
    Barefooted, in his frock and hood.[169]
    His grisled beard and matted hair
    Obscured a visage of despair;
    His naked arms and legs, seamed o'er,
    The scars of frantic penance bore.That monk, of savage form and face,
    The impending danger of his race
    Had drawn[170] from deepest solitude,
    Far in Benharrow's[171] bosom rude.Not his the mien of Christian priest,
    But Druid's,[172] from the grave released,
    Whose hardened heart and eye might brook
    On human sacrifice to look;
    And much, 'twas said, of heathen lore,
    Mixed in the charms he muttered o'er.The hallow'd creed gave only worse
    And deadlier emphasis of curse;
    No peasant sought that Hermit's prayer,
    His cave the pilgrim shunn'd with care,
    The eager huntsman knew his bound,
    And in mid-chase called off his hound;
    Or if, in lonely glen or strath,
    The desert dweller met his path,
    He pray'd, and signed the cross between,
    While terror took devotion's mien.[169] "Frock and hood," i.e., the usual garments of monks or hermits.[170] "That monk," etc., i.e., the impending danger... had drawn that
monk, etc.[171] A mountain near the head of Loch Lomond.[172] The Druids were the priests among the ancient Celtic nations
in Gaul and Britain.They worshiped in forests, regarded oaks and
mistletoe as sacred, and offered human sacrifices.V.

    Of Brian's birth strange tales were told.His mother watch'd a midnight fold,[173]
    Built deep within a dreary glen,
    Where scatter'd lay the bones of men,
    In some forgotten battle slain,
    And bleach'd by drifting wind and rain.It might have tamed a warrior's heart,
    To view such mockery of his art!The knot-grass fetter'd there the hand,
    Which once could burst an iron band;
    Beneath the broad and ample bone,
    That buckler'd heart to fear unknown,
    A feeble and a timorous guest,
    The field-fare[174] framed her lowly nest;
    There the slow blind-worm left his slime
    On the fleet limbs that mock'd at time;
    And there, too, lay the leader's skull,
    Still wreathed with chaplet, flush'd and full,
    For heath-bell, with her purple bloom,
    Supplied the bonnet and the plume.All night, in this sad glen, the maid
    Sate, shrouded in her mantle's shade:
    --She said, no shepherd sought her side,
    No hunter's hand her snood untied,
    Yet ne'er again, to braid her hair,
    The virgin snood did Alice wear;
    Gone was her maiden glee and sport,
    Her maiden girdle all too short;
    Nor sought she, from that fatal night,
    Or holy church, or blessed rite,
    But lock'd her secret in her breast,
    And died in travail, unconfess'd.Alone, among his young compeers,
    Was Brian from his infant years;
    A moody and heart-broken boy,
    Estranged from sympathy and joy,
    Bearing each taunt which careless tongue
    On his mysterious lineage flung.Whole nights he spent by moonlight pale,
    To wood and stream his hap to wail,
    Till, frantic, he as truth received
    What of his birth the crowd believed,
    And sought, in mist and meteor fire,
    To meet and know his Phantom Sire!In vain, to soothe his wayward fate,
    The cloister oped her pitying gate;
    In vain, the learning of the age
    Unclasp'd the sable-lettered[175] page;
    Even in its treasures he could find
    Food for the fever of his mind.Eager he read whatever tells
    Of magic, cabala,[176] and spells,
    And every dark pursuit allied
    To curious and presumptuous pride;
    Till, with fired brain and nerves o'erstrung,
    And heart with mystic horrors wrung,
    Desperate he sought Benharrow's den,
    And hid him from the haunts of men.[175] Black letter, the name of the Old English or modern Gothic
letters used in old manuscript and early printed books.The desert gave him visions wild,
    Such as might suit the specter's child.Where with black cliffs the torrents toil,
    He watch'd the wheeling eddies boil,
    Till, from their foam, his dazzled eyes
    Beheld the River Demon[177] rise;
    The mountain mist took form and limb,
    Of noontide hag, or goblin grim;
    The midnight wind came wild and dread,
    Swell'd with the voices of the dead;
    Far on the future battle heath
    His eye beheld the ranks of death:
    Thus the lone Seer, from mankind hurl'd,
    Shaped forth a disembodied world.One lingering sympathy of mind
    Still bound him to the mortal kind;
    The only parent he could claim
    Of ancient Alpine's lineage came.Late had he heard, in prophet's dream,
    The fatal Ben-Shie's[178] boding scream;
    Sounds,[179] too, had come in midnight blast,
    Of charging steeds, careering fast
    Along Benharrow's shingly side,
    Where mortal horseman ne'er might ride;
    The thunderbolt had split the pine,--
    All augur'd ill to Alpine's line.He girt his loins, and came to show
    The signals of impending woe,
    And now stood prompt to bless or ban,[180]
    As bade the Chieftain of his clan.[177] A malicious spirit supposed by the superstitious Scotch people to
inhabit lakes and rivers, and to forebode calamity.[178] A fairy supposed to indicate coming death or disaster by her
lamentations.[179] Sounds of the same foreboding character.'Twas all prepared;[181]--and from the rock,
    A goat, the patriarch of the flock,
    Before the kindling pile was laid,
    And pierced by Roderick's ready blade.Patient the sickening victim eyed
    The lifeblood ebb in crimson tide,
    Down his clogg'd beard and shaggy limb,
    Till darkness glazed his eyeballs dim.The grisly priest, with murmuring prayer,
    A slender crosslet form'd with care,
    A cubit's[182] length in measure due;
    The shaft and limbs were rods of yew,
    Whose parents in Inch-Cailliach[183] wave
    Their shadows o'er Clan-Alpine's grave,
    And, answering Lomond's breezes deep,
    Soothe many a chieftain's endless sleep.The Cross, thus form'd, he held on high,
    With wasted hand, and haggard eye,
    And strange and mingled feelings woke,
    While his anathema he spoke.[181] The ritual referred to in Canto III.[183] The Isles of Nuns in Loch Lomond, and place of burial of the
descendants of MacGregor."Woe to the clansman who shall view
    This symbol of sepulchral yew,
    Forgetful that its branches grew
    Where weep the heavens their holiest dew
      On Alpine's dwelling low!Deserter of his Chieftain's trust,
    He ne'er shall mingle with their dust,
    But, from his sires and kindred thrust,
    Each clansman's execration just
      Shall doom him wrath and woe."He paused;--the word the vassals took,
    With forward step and fiery look,
    On high their naked brands they shook,
    Their clattering targets wildly strook;[184]
      And first in murmur low,
    Then, like the billow in his course,
    That far to seaward finds his source,
    And flings to shore his muster'd force,
    Burst, with loud roar, their answer hoarse,
      "Woe to the traitor, woe!"Ben-an's gray scalp the accents knew,[185]
    The joyous wolf from covert drew,
    The exulting eagle scream'd afar,--
    They knew the voice of Alpine's war.[185] "Scalp," etc., i.e., summit the accents heard.X.

    The shout was hush'd on lake and fell,
    The monk resumed his mutter'd spell:
    Dismal and low its accents came,
    The while he scathed[186] the Cross with flame;
    And the few words that reach'd the air,
    Although the holiest name was there,
    Had more of blasphemy than prayer.But when he shook above the crowd
    Its kindled points, he spoke aloud:--
    "Woe to the wretch who fails to rear
    At this dread sign the ready spear!For, as the flames this symbol sear,
    His home, the refuge of his fear,
      A kindred fate shall know;
    Far o'er its roof the volumed flame
    Clan-Alpine's vengeance shall proclaim,
    While maids and matrons on his name
    Shall call down wretchedness and shame,
      And infamy and woe."Then rose the cry of females, shrill
    As goshawk's whistle on the hill,
    Denouncing[187] misery and ill,
    Mingled with childhood's babbling trill
      Of curses stammer'd slow;
    Answering, with imprecation dread,
    "Sunk be his home in embers red!And cursed be the meanest shed
    That e'er shall hide the houseless head,
      We doom to want and woe!"A sharp and shrieking echo gave,
    Coir-Uriskin,[188] thy Goblin-cave!And the gray pass where birches wave
      On Beala-nam-bo.[189]

[186] Scorched; charred.[187] Upon the recreant who failed to respond to the "dread sign" of
the Fiery Cross.[188] A ravine of Benvenue supposed to be haunted by evil spirits.[189] The Pass of the Cattle, above Coir-Uriskin.Then deeper paused the priest anew,
    And hard his laboring breath he drew,
    While, with set teeth and clinched hand,
    And eyes that glow'd like fiery brand,
    He meditated curse more dread,
    And deadlier, on the clansman's head,
    Who, summon'd to his Chieftain's aid,
    The signal saw and disobeyed.The crosslet's points of sparkling wood
    He quenched among the bubbling blood,
    And, as again the sign he rear'd,
    Hollow and hoarse his voice was heard:
    "When flits this Cross from man to man,
    Vich-Alpine's summons to his clan,
    Burst be the ear that fails to heed!Palsied the foot that shuns to speed!May ravens tear the careless eyes,
    Wolves make the coward heart their prize!As sinks that blood stream in the earth,
    So may his heart's blood drench his hearth!As dies in hissing gore the spark,
    Quench thou his light, Destruction dark,
    And be the grace to him denied,
    Bought by this sign to all beside!"He ceased; no echo gave agen
    The murmur of the deep Amen.Then Roderick, with impatient look,
    From Brian's hand the symbol took:
    "Speed, Malise, speed!"he said, and gave
    The crosslet to his henchman brave."The muster-place be Lanrick mead[190]--
    Instant the time--speed, Malise, speed!"Like heath bird, when the hawks pursue,
    A barge across Loch Katrine flew;
    High stood the henchman on the prow;
    So rapidly the barge-men row,
    The bubbles, where they launch'd the boat,
    Were all unbroken and afloat,
    Dancing in foam and ripple still,
    When it had near'd the mainland hill;
    And from the silver beach's side
    Still was the prow three fathom wide,
    When lightly bounded to the land
    The messenger of blood and brand.[190] A meadow at the western end of Loch Vennachar.the dun deer's hide[191]
    On fleeter foot was never tied.such cause of haste
    Thine active sinews never braced.Bend 'gainst the steepy hill thy breast,
    Burst down like torrent from its crest;
    With short and springing footstep pass
    The trembling bog and false morass;
    Across the brook like roebuck bound,
    And thread the brake like questing[192] hound;
    The crag is high, the scaur is deep,
    Yet shrink not from the desperate leap:
    Parch'd are thy burning lips and brow,
    Yet by the fountain pause not now;
    Herald of battle, fate, and fear,
    Stretch onward in thy fleet career!The wounded hind thou track'st not now,
    Pursuest not maid through greenwood bough,
    Nor pliest thou now thy flying pace
    With rivals in the mountain race;
    But danger, death, and warrior deed
    Are in thy course--speed, Malise, speed![191] The shoes or buskins of the Highlanders were made of this hide.Fast as the fatal symbol flies,
    In arms the huts and hamlets rise;
    From winding glen, from upland brown,
    They pour'd each hardy tenant down.Nor slack'd the messenger his pace;
    He show'd the sign, he named the place,
    And, pressing forward like the wind,
    Left clamor and surprise behind.The fisherman forsook the strand,
    The swarthy smith took dirk and brand;
    With changed cheer,[193] the mower blithe
    Left in the half-cut swath the scythe;
    The herds without a keeper stray'd,
    The plow was in mid-furrow stayed,
    The falc'ner toss'd his hawk away,
    The hunter left the stag at bay;
    Prompt at the signal of alarms,
    Each son of Alpine rush'd to arms;
    So swept the tumult and affray
    Along the margin of Achray.that e'er
    Thy banks should echo sounds of fear!The rocks, the bosky[194] thickets, sleep
    So stilly on thy bosom deep,
    The lark's blithe carol, from the cloud,
    Seems for the scene too gayly loud.The lake is past,
    Duncraggan's[195] huts appear at last,
    And peep, like moss-grown rocks, half seen,
    Half hidden in the copse so green;
    There mayst thou rest, thy labor done,
    Their lord shall speed the signal on.--
    As stoops the hawk upon his prey,
    The henchman shot him down the way.--What woeful accents load the gale?A gallant hunter's sport is o'er,
    A valiant warrior fights no more.Who, in the battle or the chase,
    At Roderick's side shall fill his place!--
    Within the hall, where torch's ray
    Supplies the excluded beams of day,
    Lies Duncan on his lowly bier,
    And o'er him streams his widow's tear.His stripling son stands mournful by,
    His youngest weeps, but knows not why;
    The village maids and matrons round
    The dismal coronach[196] resound.[195] An estate between Lochs Achray and Vennachar.[196] The Scottish wail or song over the dead.He is gone on the mountain,
      He is lost to the forest,
    Like a summer-dried fountain,
      When our need was the sorest.The font, reappearing,
      From the raindrops shall borrow,
    But to us comes no cheering,
      To Duncan no morrow!The hand of the reaper
      Takes the ears that are hoary,
    But the voice of the weeper
      Wails manhood in glory.The autumn winds rushing
      Waft the leaves that are searest,
    But our flower was in flushing,[197]
      When blighting was nearest.Fleet foot on the correi,[198]
      Sage counsel in cumber,[199]
    Red hand in the foray,
      How sound is thy slumber!Like the dew on the mountain,
      Like the foam on the river,
    Like the bubble on the fountain,
      Thou art gone, and forever![198] The side of a hill which the game usually frequents.See Stumah,[200] who, the bier beside,
    His master's corpse with wonder eyed,
    Poor Stumah!whom his least halloo
    Could send like lightning o'er the dew,
    Bristles his crest, and points his ears,
    As if some stranger step he hears.'Tis not a mourner's muffled tread,
    Who comes to sorrow o'er the dead,
    But headlong haste, or deadly fear,
    Urge the precipitate career.All stand aghast:--unheeding all,
    The henchman bursts into the hall;
    Before the dead man's bier he stood;
    Held forth the Cross besmear'd with blood:
    "The muster-place is Lanrick mead;
    Speed forth the signal!Angus, the heir of Duncan's line,
    Sprung forth and seized the fatal sign.In haste the stripling to his side
    His father's dirk and broadsword tied;
    But when he saw his mother's eye
    Watch him in speechless agony,
    Back to her open'd arms he flew,
    Press'd on her lips a fond adieu--
    "Alas!"she sobb'd,--"and yet, begone,
    And speed thee forth, like Duncan's son!"One look he cast upon the bier,
    Dash'd from his eye the gathering tear,
    Breathed deep to clear his laboring breast,
    And toss'd aloft his bonnet crest,
    Then, like the high-bred colt, when, freed,
    First he essays his fire and speed,
    He vanish'd, and o'er moor and moss
    Sped forward with the Fiery Cross.Suspended was the widow's tear,
    While yet his footsteps she could hear;
    And when she mark'd the henchman's eye
    Wet with unwonted sympathy,
    "Kinsman," she said, "his race is run,
    That should have sped thine errand on;
    The oak has fall'n,--the sapling bough
    Is all Duncraggan's shelter now.Yet trust I well, his duty done,
    The orphan's God will guard my son.--
    And you, in many a danger true,
    At Duncan's hest[201] your blades that drew,
    To arms, and guard that orphan's head!Let babes and women wail the dead."Then weapon clang, and martial call,
    Resounded through the funeral hall,
    While from the walls the attendant band
    Snatch'd sword and targe, with hurried hand;
    And short and flitting energy
    Glanced from the mourner's sunken eye,
    As if the sounds to warrior dear
    Might rouse her Duncan from his bier.But faded soon that borrow'd force;
    Grief claim'd his right, and tears their course.Benledi saw the Cross of Fire,
    It glanced like lightning up Strath-Ire.[202]
    O'er dale and hill the summons flew,
    Nor rest nor pause young Angus knew;
    The tear that gather'd in his eye
    He left the mountain breeze to dry;
    Until, where Teith's young waters roll,
    Betwixt him and a wooded knoll,
    That graced the sable strath with green,
    The chapel of St.Swoln was the stream, remote the bridge,
    But Angus paused not on the edge;
    Though the dark waves danced dizzily,
    Though reel'd his sympathetic eye,
    He dash'd amid the torrent's roar:
    His right hand high the crosslet bore,
    His left the poleax grasp'd, to guide
    And stay his footing in the tide.He stumbled twice--the foam splash'd high,
    With hoarser swell the stream raced by;
    And had he fall'n,--forever there,
    Farewell Duncraggan's orphan heir!But still, as if in parting life,
    Firmer he grasp'd the Cross of strife,
    Until the opposing bank he gain'd,
    And up the chapel pathway strain'd.[202] The valley in which Loch Lubnaig lies.A blithesome rout, that morning tide,[203]
    Had sought the chapel of St.Her troth Tombea's[204] Mary gave
    To Norman, heir of Armandave,[205]
    And, issuing from the Gothic arch,
    The bridal[206] now resumed their march.In rude, but glad procession, came
    Bonneted sire and coif-clad dame;
    And plaided youth, with jest and jeer,
    Which snooded maiden would not hear;
    And children, that, unwitting[207] why,
    Lent the gay shout their shrilly cry;
    And minstrels, that in measures vied
    Before the young and bonny bride,
    Whose downcast eye and cheek disclose
    The tear and blush of morning rose.With virgin step, and bashful hand,
    She held the kerchief's snowy band;
    The gallant bridegroom, by her side,
    Beheld his prize with victor's pride,
    And the glad mother in her ear
    Was closely whispering word of cheer.[204] Tombea and Armandave are names of neighboring farmsteads.[205] Tombea and Armandave are names of neighboring farmsteads.[206] Those composing the bridal procession.Haste in his hurried accent lies,
    And grief is swimming in his eyes.All dripping from the recent flood,
    Panting and travel-soil'd he stood,
    The fatal sign of fire and sword
    Held forth, and spoke the appointed word:
    "The muster-place is Lanrick mead--
    Speed forth the signal!And must he change so soon the hand,
    Just link'd to his by holy band,
    For the fell Cross of blood and brand?And must the day, so blithe that rose,
    And promised rapture in the close,
    Before its setting hour, divide
    The bridegroom from the plighted bride?Clan-Alpine's cause, her Chieftain's trust,
    Her summons dread, brook no delay;
    Stretch to the race--away!Yet slow he laid his plaid aside,
    And, lingering, eyed his lovely bride,
    Until he saw the starting tear
    Speak woe he might not stop to cheer;
    Then, trusting not a second look,
    In haste he sped him up the brook,
    Nor backward glanced, till on the heath
    Where Lubnaig's lake supplies the Teith.--What in the racer's bosom stirr'd?The sickening pang of hope deferr'd,
    And memory, with a torturing train
    Of all his morning visions vain.Mingled with love's impatience, came
    The manly thirst for martial fame;
    The stormy joy of mountaineers,
    Ere yet they rush upon the spears;
    And zeal for Clan and Chieftain burning,
    And hope, from well-fought field returning,
    With war's red honors on his crest,
    To clasp his Mary to his breast.Stung by such thoughts, o'er bank and brae,
    Like fire from flint he glanced away,
    While high resolve, and feeling strong,
    Burst into voluntary song.The heath this night must be my bed,
    The bracken curtain for my head,
    My lullaby the warder's tread,
        Far, far from love and thee, Mary;
    To-morrow eve, more stilly laid,
    My couch may be my bloody plaid,
    My vesper song thy wail, sweet maid!I may not, dare not, fancy now
    The grief that clouds thy lovely brow;
    I dare not think upon thy vow,
        And all it promised me, Mary.No fond regret must Norman know;
    When bursts Clan-Alpine on the foe,
    His heart must be like bended bow,
        His foot like arrow free, Mary.A time will come with feeling fraught,
    For, if I fall in battle fought,
    Thy hapless lover's dying thought
        Shall be a thought of thee, Mary.And if return'd from conquer'd foes,
    How blithely will the evening close,
    How sweet the linnet sing repose,
        To my young bride and me, Mary!Not faster o'er thy heathery braes,
    Balquhidder, speeds the midnight blaze,[208]
    Rushing, in conflagration strong,
    Thy deep ravines and dells along,
    Wrapping thy cliffs in purple glow,
    And reddening the dark lakes below;
    Nor faster speeds it, nor so far,
    As o'er thy heaths the voice of war.The signal roused to martial coil[209]
    The sullen margin of Loch Voil,
    Waked still Loch Doine, and to the source
    Alarm'd, Balvaig, thy swampy course;
    Thence southward turn'd its rapid road
    Adown Strath-Gartney's valley broad,
    Till rose in arms each man might claim
    A portion in Clan-Alpine's name,
    From the gray sire, whose trembling hand
    Could hardly buckle on his brand,
    To the raw boy, whose shaft and bow
    Were yet scarce terror to the crow.Each valley, each sequester'd glen,
    Muster'd its little horde of men,
    That met as torrents from the height
    In Highland dales their streams unite,
    Still gathering, as they pour along,
    A voice more loud, a tide more strong,
    Till at the rendezvous they stood
    By hundreds prompt for blows and blood;
    Each train'd to arms since life began,
    Owning no tie but to his clan,
    No oath, but by his Chieftain's hand,
    No law, but Roderick Dhu's command.[208] Blaze of the heather, which is often set on fire by the shepherds
to facilitate a growth of young herbage for the sheep.That summer morn had Roderick Dhu
    Survey'd the skirts of Benvenue,
    And sent his scouts o'er hill and heath,
    To view the frontiers of Menteith.All backward came with news of truce;
    Still lay each martial Graeme[210] and Bruce,[211]
    In Rednock[212] courts no horsemen wait,
    No banner waved on Cardross[213] gate,
    On Duchray's[214] towers no beacon shone,
    Nor scared the herons from Loch Con;
    All seemed at peace.--Now wot ye why
    The Chieftain, with such anxious eye,
    Ere to the muster he repair,
    This western frontier scann'd with care?--
    In Benvenue's most darksome cleft,
    A fair, though cruel, pledge was left;
    For Douglas, to his promise true,
    That morning from the isle withdrew,
    And in a deep sequester'd dell
    Had sought a low and lonely cell.By many a bard, in Celtic tongue,
    Has Coir-nan-Uriskin[215] been sung;
    A softer name the Saxons gave,
    And called the grot the Goblin-cave.[210] A powerful Lowland family (see Note 1, p.[211] A powerful Lowland family (see Note 1, p.[212] A castle in the Forth valley (see map, p.[213] A castle in the Forth valley (see map, p.[214] A castle in the Forth valley (see map, p.It was a wild and strange retreat,
    As e'er was trod by outlaw's feet.The dell, upon the mountain's crest,
    Yawn'd like a gash on warrior's breast;
    Its trench had stayed full many a rock,
    Hurl'd by primeval earthquake shock
    From Benvenue's gray summit wild,
    And here, in random ruin piled,
    They frown'd incumbent o'er the spot,
    And form'd the rugged silvan grot.The oak and birch, with mingled shade,
    At noontide there a twilight made,
    Unless when short and sudden shone
    Some straggling beam on cliff or stone,
    With such a glimpse as prophet's eye
    Gains on thy depth, Futurity.No murmur waked the solemn still,[216]
    Save tinkling of a fountain rill;
    But when the wind chafed with the lake,
    A sullen sound would upward break,
    With dashing hollow voice, that spoke
    The incessant war of wave and rock.Suspended cliffs, with hideous sway,
    Seem'd nodding o'er the cavern gray.From such a den the wolf had sprung,
    In such the wild-cat leaves her young;
    Yet Douglas and his daughter fair
    Sought for a space their safety there.Gray Superstition's whisper dread
    Debarr'd the spot to vulgar tread;
    For there, she said, did fays resort,
    And satyrs[217] hold their silvan court,
    By moonlight tread their mystic maze,
    And blast the rash beholder's gaze.[217] Silvan deities of Greek mythology, with head and body of a man
and legs of a goat.Now eve, with western shadows long,
    Floated on Katrine bright and strong,
    When Roderick, with a chosen few,
    Repass'd the heights of Benvenue.Above the Goblin-cave they go,
    Through the wild pass of Beal-nam-bo:
    The prompt retainers speed before,
    To launch the shallop from the shore,
    For 'cross Loch Katrine lies his way
    To view the passes of Achray,
    And place his clansmen in array.Yet lags the Chief in musing mind,
    Unwonted sight, his men behind.A single page, to bear his sword,
    Alone attended on his lord;
    The rest their way through thickets break,
    And soon await him by the lake.It was a fair and gallant sight,
    To view them from the neighboring height,
    By the low-level'd sunbeam's light!For strength and stature, from the clan
    Each warrior was a chosen man,
    As even afar might well be seen,
    By their proud step and martial mien.Their feathers dance, their tartans float,
    Their targets gleam, as by the boat
    A wild and warlike group they stand,
    That well became such mountain strand.Their Chief, with step reluctant, still
    Was lingering on the craggy hill,
    Hard by where turn'd apart the road
    To Douglas's obscure abode.It was but with that dawning morn,
    That Roderick Dhu had proudly sworn
    To drown his love in war's wild roar,
    Nor think of Ellen Douglas more;
    But he who stems[218] a stream with sand,
    And fetters flame with flaxen band,
    Has yet a harder task to prove--
    By firm resolve to conquer love!Eve finds the Chief, like restless ghost,
    Still hovering near his treasure lost;
    For though his haughty heart deny
    A parting meeting to his eye,
    Still fondly strains his anxious ear,
    The accents of her voice to hear,
    And inly did he curse the breeze
    That waked to sound the rustling trees.It is the harp of Allan-Bane,
    That wakes its measure slow and high,
    Attuned to sacred minstrelsy.'Tis Ellen, or an angel, sings._Ave Maria!_[219] maiden mild!Thou canst hear though from the wild,
      Thou canst save amid despair.Safe may we sleep beneath thy care,
      Though banish'd, outcast, and reviled--
    Maiden!_Ave Maria!_

    _Ave Maria!_ undefiled!The flinty couch we now must share
    Shall seem with down of eider[220] piled,
      If thy protection hover there.The murky cavern's heavy air
      Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled;
    Then, Maiden!_Ave Maria!_

    _Ave Maria!_ stainless styled!Foul demons of the earth and air,
    From this their wonted haunt exiled,
      Shall flee before thy presence fair.We bow us to our lot of care,
      Beneath thy guidance reconciled;
    Hear for a maid a maiden's prayer!_Ave Maria!_

[219] Hail, Mary!The beginning of the Roman Catholic prayer to the
Virgin Mary.[220] "Down of eider," i.e., the soft breast feathers of the eider duck.Died on the harp the closing hymn.--
    Unmoved in attitude and limb,
    As list'ning still, Clan-Alpine's lord
    Stood leaning on his heavy sword,
    Until the page, with humble sign,
    Twice pointed to the sun's decline.Then while his plaid he round him cast,
    "It is the last time--'tis the last,"
    He mutter'd thrice,--"the last time e'er
    That angel voice shall Roderick hear!"It was a goading thought--his stride
    Hied hastier down the mountain side;
    Sullen he flung him in the boat,
    And instant 'cross the lake it shot.They landed in that silvery bay,
    And eastward held their hasty way,
    Till, with the latest beams of light,
    The band arrived on Lanrick height,
    Where muster'd, in the vale below,
    Clan-Alpine's men in martial show.A various scene the clansmen made;
    Some sate, some stood, some slowly stray'd;
    But most, with mantles folded round,
    Were couch'd to rest upon the ground,
    Scarce to be known by curious eye,
    From the deep heather where they lie,
    So well was match'd the tartan screen
    With heath bell dark and brackens green;
    Unless where, here and there, a blade,
    Or lance's point, a glimmer made,
    Like glowworm twinkling through the shade.But when, advancing through the gloom,
    They saw the Chieftain's eagle plume,
    Their shout of welcome, shrill and wide,
    Shook the steep mountain's steady side.Thrice it arose, and lake and fell
    Three times return'd the martial yell;
    It died upon Bochastle's plain,
    And Silence claim'd her evening reign."The rose is fairest when 'tis budding new,
      And hope is brightest when it dawns from fears;
    The rose is sweetest wash'd with morning dew,
      And love is loveliest when embalm'd in tears.O wilding[221] rose, whom fancy thus endears,
      I bid your blossoms in my bonnet wave,
    Emblem of hope and love through future years!"--
      Thus spoke young Norman, heir of Armandave,
    What time the sun arose on Vennachar's broad wave.Such fond conceit, half said, half sung,
    Love prompted to the bridegroom's tongue,
    All while he stripp'd the wild-rose spray.His ax and bow beside him lay,
    For on a pass 'twixt lake and wood,
    A wakeful sentinel he stood.on the rock a footstep rung,
    And instant to his arms he sprung."Stand, or thou diest!--What, Malise?--soon
    Art thou return'd from Braes of Doune.By thy keen step and glance I know,
    Thou bring'st us tidings of the foe."--
    (For while the Fiery Cross hied on,
    On distant scout had Malise gone.)the henchman said.--
    "Apart, in yonder misty glade;
    To his lone couch I'll be your guide."--
    Then call'd a slumberer by his side,
    And stirr'd him with his slacken'd bow--
    "Up, up, Glentarkin!We seek the Chieftain; on the track,
    Keep eagle watch till I come back."Together up the pass they sped:
    "What of the foemen?"Norman said.--
    "Varying reports from near and far;
    This certain,--that a band of war
    Has for two days been ready boune,[222]
    At prompt command, to march from Doune;
    King James, the while, with princely powers,
    Holds revelry in Stirling towers.Soon will this dark and gathering cloud
    Speak on our glens in thunder loud.Inured to bide such bitter bout,
    The warrior's plaid may bear it out;[223]
    But, Norman, how wilt thou provide
    A shelter for thy bonny bride?"know ye not that Roderick's care
    To the lone isle hath caused repair
    Each maid and matron of the clan,
    And every child and aged man
    Unfit for arms; and given his charge,[224]
    Nor skiff nor shallop, boat nor barge,
    Upon these lakes shall float at large,
    But all beside the islet moor,
    That such dear pledge may rest secure?"--

[222] "Boune" itself means "ready" in Scotch: hence its use here is
tautology.[223] "Inured to bide," etc., i.e., accustomed to endure privations,
the warrior may withstand the coming storm."'Tis well advised--the Chieftain's plan
    Bespeaks the father of his clan.But wherefore sleeps Sir Roderick Dhu
    Apart from all his followers true?"--
    "It is, because last evening-tide
    Brian an augury hath tried,
    Of that dread kind which must not be
    Unless in dread extremity;
    The Taghairm[225] call'd; by which, afar,
    Our sires foresaw the events of war.Duncraggan's milk-white bull they slew."The choicest of the prey we had,
    When swept our merry men Gallangad.[226]
    His hide was snow, his horns were dark,
    His red eye glow'd like fiery spark;
    So fierce, so tameless, and so fleet,
    Sore did he cumber our retreat,
    And kept our stoutest kernes[227] in awe,
    Even at the pass of Beal'maha.But steep and flinty was the road,
    And sharp the hurrying pikeman's goad,
    And when we came to Dennan's Row,
    A child might scathless[228] stroke his brow."[225] An old Highland mode of "reading the future.""A person was
wrapped up in the skin of a newly slain bullock, and deposited beside a
waterfall, or at the bottom of a precipice, or in some other strange,
wild, and unusual situation.In this situation he revolved in his
mind the question proposed, and whatever was impressed upon him by
his exalted imagination passed for the inspiration of the disembodied
spirits who haunt the desolate recesses."--_Scott._

[226] South of Loch Lomond."That bull was slain: his reeking hide
    They stretch'd the cataract beside,
    Whose waters their wild tumult toss
    Adown the black and craggy boss
    Of that huge cliff, whose ample verge
    Tradition calls the Hero's Targe.Couch'd on a shelve beneath its brink,
    Close where the thundering torrents sink,
    Rocking beneath their headlong sway,
    And drizzled by the ceaseless spray,
    Midst groan of rock, and roar of stream,
    The wizard waits prophetic dream.Nor distant rests the Chief;--but hush!See, gliding slow through mist and bush,
    The Hermit gains yon rock, and stands
    To gaze upon our slumbering bands.Seems he not, Malise, like a ghost,
    That hovers o'er a slaughter'd host?Or raven on the blasted oak,
    That, watching while the deer is broke,[229]
    His morsel claims with sullen croak?"to other than to me,
    Thy words were evil augury;
    But still I hold Sir Roderick's blade
    Clan-Alpine's omen and her aid,
    Not aught that, glean'd from heaven or hell,
    Yon fiend-begotten monk can tell.The Chieftain joins him, see--and now,
    Together they descend the brow."And, as they came, with Alpine's lord
    The Hermit Monk held solemn word:--
    "Roderick!it is a fearful strife,
    For man endowed with mortal life,
    Whose shroud of sentient clay can still
    Feel feverish pang and fainting chill,
    Whose eye can stare in stony trance,
    Whose hair can rouse like warrior's lance,--
    'Tis hard for such to view, unfurl'd,
    The curtain of the future world.Yet, witness every quaking limb,
    My sunken pulse, my eyeballs dim,
    My soul with harrowing anguish torn,
    This for my Chieftain have I borne!--
    The shapes that sought my fearful couch,
    A human tongue may ne'er avouch;
    No mortal man,--save he, who, bred
    Between the living and the dead,
    Is gifted beyond nature's law,--
    Had e'er survived to say he saw.At length the fateful answer came,
    In characters of living flame!Not spoke in word, nor blazed[230] in scroll,
    But borne and branded on my soul;--
    WHICH SPILLS THE FOREMOST FOEMAN'S LIFE,
    THAT PARTY CONQUERS IN THE STRIFE."--

[230] Emblazoned."Thanks, Brian, for thy zeal and care!Good is thine augury, and fair.Clan-Alpine ne'er in battle stood,
    But first our broadswords tasted blood.A surer victim still I know,
    Self-offer'd to the auspicious blow:
    A spy has sought my land this morn,--
    No eve shall witness his return!My followers guard each pass's mouth,
    To east, to westward, and to south;
    Red Murdoch, bribed to be his guide,
    Has charge to lead his steps aside,
    Till, in deep path or dingle brown,
    He light on those shall bring him down.--But see, who comes his news to show!"At Doune, o'er many a spear and glaive[231]
    Two Barons proud their banners wave.I saw the Moray's silver star,
    And mark'd the sable pale[232] of Mar."--
    "By Alpine's soul, high tidings those!--"To-morrow's noon
    Will see them here for battle boune."--
    "Then shall it see a meeting stern!--
    But, for the place--say, couldst thou learn
    Naught of the friendly clans of Earn?[233]
    Strengthened by them, we well might bide
    The battle on Benledi's side.Clan-Alpine's men
    Shall man the Trosachs' shaggy glen;
    Within Loch Katrine's gorge we'll fight,
    All in our maids' and matrons' sight,
    Each for his hearth and household fire,
    Father for child, and son for sire,
    Lover for maid beloved!--But why--
    Is it the breeze affects mine eye?Or dost thou come, ill-omened tear!sooner may the Saxon lance
    Unfix Benledi from his stance,[234]
    Than doubt or terror can pierce through
    The unyielding heart of Roderick Dhu!'Tis stubborn as his trusty targe.Each to his post--all know their charge."The pibroch sounds, the bands advance,
    The broadswords gleam, the banners dance,
    Obedient to the Chieftain's glance.--I turn me from the martial roar,
    And seek Coir-Uriskin once more.[232] Black band in the coat of arms of the Earls of Mar.Where is the Douglas?--he is gone;
    And Ellen sits on the gray stone
    Fast by the cave, and makes her moan;
    While vainly Allan's words of cheer
    Are pour'd on her unheeding ear.--
    "He will return--Dear lady, trust!--
    With joy return;--he will--he must.Well was it time to seek, afar,
    Some refuge from impending war,
    When e'en Clan-Alpine's rugged swarm
    Are cow'd by the approaching storm.I saw their boats, with many a light,
    Floating the livelong yesternight,
    Shifting like flashes darted forth
    By the red streamers of the north;[235]
    I mark'd at morn how close they ride,
    Thick moor'd by the lone islet's side,
    Like wild ducks couching in the fen,
    When stoops the hawk upon the glen.Since this rude race dare not abide
    The peril on the mainland side,
    Shall not thy noble father's care
    Some safe retreat for thee prepare?"--

[235] "Red streamers," etc., i.e., the aurora borealis.Pretext so kind
    My wakeful terrors could not blind.When in such tender tone, yet grave,
    Douglas a parting blessing gave,
    The tear that glisten'd in his eye
    Drown'd not his purpose fix'd and high.My soul, though feminine and weak,
    Can image his; e'en as the lake,
    Itself disturb'd by slightest stroke,
    Reflects the invulnerable rock.He hears report of battle rife,
    He deems himself the cause of strife.I saw him redden, when the theme
    Turn'd, Allan, on thine idle dream
    Of Malcolm Graeme in fetters bound,
    Which I, thou saidst, about him wound.Think'st thou he trow'd[236] thine omen aught?'twas apprehensive thought
    For the kind youth,--for Roderick too--
    (Let me be just) that friend so true;
    In danger both, and in our cause!Minstrel, the Douglas dare not pause.Why else that solemn warning given,
    'If not on earth, we meet in heaven?'Why else, to Cambus-kenneth's fane,[237]
    If eve return him not again,
    Am I to hie, and make me known?he goes to Scotland's throne,
    Buys his friend's safety with his own;
    He goes to do--what I had done,
    Had Douglas' daughter been his son!"This abbey is not far from Stirling."Nay, lovely Ellen!--dearest, nay!If aught should his return delay,
    He only named yon holy fane
    As fitting place to meet again.Be sure he's safe; and for the Graeme,--
    Heaven's blessing on his gallant name!--
    My vision'd sight may yet prove true,
    Nor bode[238] of ill to him or you.When did my gifted[239] dream beguile?[240]
    Think of the stranger at the isle,
    And think upon the harpings slow,
    That presaged this approaching woe!Sooth was my prophecy of fear;
    Believe it when it augurs cheer.Ill luck still haunts a fairy grot.Of such a wondrous tale I know--
    Dear lady, change that look of woe,
    My harp was wont thy grief to cheer.""Well, be it as thou wilt; I hear,
    But cannot stop the bursting tear."The Minstrel tried his simple art,
    But distant far was Ellen's heart._Alice Brand._

    Merry it is in the good greenwood,
      When the mavis[241] and merle[242] are singing,
    When the deer sweeps by, and the hounds are in cry,
      And the hunter's horn is ringing."O Alice Brand, my native land
      Is lost for love of you;
    And we must hold by wood and wold,[243]
      As outlaws wont to do."O Alice, 'twas all for thy locks so bright,
      And 'twas all for thine eyes so blue,
    That on the night of our luckless flight,
      Thy brother bold I slew."Now must I teach to hew the beech
      The hand that held the glaive,
    For leaves to spread our lowly bed,
      And stakes to fence our cave."And for vest of pall,[244] thy finger small,
      That wont on harp to stray,
    A cloak must shear from the slaughter'd deer,
      To keep the cold away."if my brother died,
      'Twas but a fatal chance;
    For darkling[245] was the battle tried,
      And fortune sped the lance."If pall and vair[246] no more I wear,
      Nor thou the crimson sheen,
    As warm, we'll say, is the russet[247] gray,
      As gay the forest-green.[248]

    "And, Richard, if our lot be hard,
      And lost thy native land,
    Still Alice has her own Richard,
      And he his Alice Brand."'Tis merry, 'tis merry, in good greenwood,
      So blithe Lady Alice is singing;
    On the beech's pride, and oak's brown side,
      Lord Richard's ax is ringing.Up spoke the moody Elfin King,
      Who won'd[249] within the hill,--
    Like wind in the porch of a ruin'd church,
      His voice was ghostly shrill."Why sounds yon stroke on beech and oak,
      Our moonlight circle's screen?Or who comes here to chase the deer,
      Beloved of our Elfin Queen?Or who may dare on wold to wear
      The fairies' fatal green!to yon mortal hie,
      For thou wert christen'd man;
    For cross or sign thou wilt not fly,
      For mutter'd word or ban."Lay on him the curse of the wither'd heart,
      The curse of the sleepless eye;
    Till he wish and pray that his life would part,
      Nor yet find leave to die."'Tis merry, 'tis merry, in good greenwood,
      Though the birds have still'd their singing!The evening blaze doth Alice raise,
      And Richard is fagots bringing.Up Urgan starts, that hideous dwarf,
      Before Lord Richard stands,
    And, as he cross'd and bless'd himself,
    "I fear not sign," quoth the grisly elf,
      "That is made with bloody hands."But out then spoke she, Alice Brand,
      That woman void of fear,--
    "And if there's blood upon his hand,
      'Tis but the blood of deer."--

    "Now loud thou liest, thou bold of mood!It cleaves unto his hand,
    The stain of thine own kindly[250] blood,
      The blood of Ethert Brand."Then forward stepp'd she, Alice Brand,
      And made the holy sign,--
    "And if there's blood on Richard's hand,
      A spotless hand is mine."And I conjure thee, demon elf,
      By Him whom demons fear,
    To show us whence thou art thyself,
      And what thine errand here?""'Tis merry, 'tis merry, in Fairyland,
      When fairy birds are singing,
    When the court doth ride by their monarch's side,
      With bit and bridle ringing:

    "And gayly shines the Fairyland--
      But all is glistening show,
    Like the idle gleam that December's beam
      Can dart on ice and snow."And fading, like that varied gleam,
      Is our inconstant shape,
    Who now like knight and lady seem,
      And now like dwarf and ape."It was between the night and day,
      When the Fairy King has power,
    That I sunk down in a sinful fray,
    And, 'twixt life and death, was snatched away
      To the joyless Elfin bower."But wist[251] I of a woman bold,
      Who thrice my brow durst sign,
    I might regain my mortal mold,
      As fair a form as thine."She cross'd him once--she cross'd him twice--
      That lady was so brave;
    The fouler grew his goblin hue,
      The darker grew the cave.She cross'd him thrice, that lady bold;
      He rose beneath her hand
    The fairest knight on Scottish mold,
      Her brother, Ethert Brand!Merry it is in good greenwood,
      When the mavis and merle are singing,
    But merrier were they in Dunfermline[252] gray,
      When all the bells were ringing.[252] A town in Fifeshire, thirteen miles northwest of Edinburgh, the
residence of the early Scottish kings.Its Abbey of the Gray Friars was
the royal burial place.Just as the minstrel sounds were stayed,
    A stranger climb'd the steepy glade;
    His martial step, his stately mien,
    His hunting suit of Lincoln green,
    His eagle glance, remembrance claims--
    'Tis Snowdoun's Knight, 'tis James Fitz-James.Ellen beheld as in a dream,
    Then, starting, scarce suppress'd a scream:
    "O stranger!in such hour of fear,
    What evil hap has brought thee here?"--
    "An evil hap how can it be,
    That bids me look again on thee?By promise bound, my former guide
    Met me betimes this morning tide,
    And marshal'd, over bank and bourne,[253]
    The happy path of my return."--
    "The happy path!--what!said he naught
    Of war, of battle to be fought,
    Of guarded pass?"Nor saw I aught could augur scathe."[254]--
    "Oh haste thee, Allan, to the kern,[255]
    --Yonder his tartans I discern;
    Learn thou his purpose, and conjure
    That he will guide the stranger sure!--
    What prompted thee, unhappy man?The meanest serf in Roderick's clan
    Had not been bribed by love or fear,
    Unknown to him to guide thee here."Referring to the treacherous guide, Red Murdoch
(see Stanza VII."Sweet Ellen, dear my life must be,
    Since it is worthy care from thee;
    Yet life I hold but idle breath,
    When love or honor's weigh'd with death.Then let me profit by my chance,
    And speak my purpose bold at once.I come to bear thee from a wild,
    Where ne'er before such blossom smiled;
    By this soft hand to lead thee far
    From frantic scenes of feud and war.Near Bochastle my horses wait;
    They bear us soon to Stirling gate.I'll place thee in a lovely bower,
    I'll guard thee like a tender flower"--
    "Oh!'twere female art,
    To say I do not read thy heart;
    Too much, before, my selfish ear
    Was idly soothed my praise to hear.That fatal bait hath lured thee back,
    In deathful hour, o'er dangerous track;
    And how, oh how, can I atone
    The wreck my vanity brought on!--
    One way remains--I'll tell him all--
    Yes!struggling bosom, forth it shall!Thou, whose light folly bears the blame
    Buy thine own pardon with thy shame!But first--my father is a man
    Outlaw'd and exiled, under ban;
    The price of blood is on his head,
    With me 'twere infamy to wed.--
    Still wouldst thou speak?--then hear the truth!Fitz-James, there is a noble youth,--
    If yet he is!--exposed for me
    And mine to dread extremity[256]--
    Thou hast the secret of my heart;
    Forgive, be generous, and depart!"Fitz-James knew every wily train[257]
    A lady's fickle heart to gain;
    But here he knew and felt them vain.There shot no glance from Ellen's eye,
    To give her steadfast speech the lie;
    In maiden confidence she stood,
    Though mantled in her cheek the blood,
    And told her love with such a sigh
    Of deep and hopeless agony,
    As[258] death had seal'd her Malcolm's doom,
    And she sat sorrowing on his tomb.Hope vanish'd from Fitz-James's eye,
    But not with hope fled sympathy.He proffer'd to attend her side,
    As brother would a sister guide.--
    "Oh!little know'st thou Roderick's heart!Oh haste thee, and from Allan learn,
    If thou mayst trust yon wily kern."With hand upon his forehead laid,
    The conflict of his mind to shade,
    A parting step or two he made;
    Then, as some thought had cross'd his brain,
    He paused, and turn'd, and came again."Hear, lady, yet, a parting word!--
    It chanced in fight that my poor sword
    Preserved the life of Scotland's lord.This ring the grateful Monarch gave,
    And bade, when I had boon to crave,
    To bring it back, and boldly claim
    The recompense that I would name.Ellen, I am no courtly lord,
    But one who lives by lance and sword,
    Whose castle is his helm and shield,
    His lordship the embattled field.What from a prince can I demand,
    Who neither reck[259] of state nor land?Ellen, thy hand--the ring is thine;
    Each guard and usher knows the sign.Seek thou the King without delay;
    This signet shall secure thy way;
    And claim thy suit, whate'er it be,
    As ransom of his pledge to me."He placed the golden circlet on,
    Paused--kiss'd her hand--and then was gone.The aged Minstrel stood aghast,
    So hastily Fitz-James shot past.He join'd his guide, and wending down
    The ridges of the mountain brown,
    Across the stream they took their way,
    That joins Loch Katrine to Achray.All in the Trosachs' glen was still,
    Noontide was sleeping on the hill:
    Sudden his guide whoop'd loud and high--
    "Murdoch!--
    He stammer'd forth--"I shout to scare
    Yon raven from his dainty fare."He look'd--he knew the raven's prey,
    His own brave steed:--"Ah!For thee--for me, perchance--'twere well
    We ne'er had seen the Trosachs' dell.--
    Murdoch, move first--but silently;
    Whistle or whoop, and thou shalt die!"Jealous and sullen, on they fared,
    Each silent, each upon his guard.Now wound the path its dizzy ledge
    Around a precipice's edge,
    When lo!a wasted female form,
    Blighted by wrath of sun and storm,
    In tatter'd weeds[260] and wild array,
    Stood on a cliff beside the way,
    And glancing round her restless eye,
    Upon the wood, the rock, the sky,
    Seem'd naught to mark, yet all to spy.Her brow was wreath'd with gaudy broom;
    With gesture wild she waved a plume
    Of feathers, which the eagles fling
    To crag and cliff from dusky wing;
    Such spoils her desperate step had sought,
    Where scarce was footing for the goat.The tartan plaid she first descried,
    And shriek'd till all the rocks replied;
    As loud she laugh'd when near they drew,
    For then the Lowland garb she knew;
    And then her hands she wildly wrung,
    And then she wept, and then she sung--
    She sung!--the voice, in better time,
    Perchance to harp or lute might chime;
    And now, though strain'd and roughen'd, still
    Rung wildly sweet to dale and hill.They bid me sleep, they bid me pray,
      They say my brain is warp'd[261] and wrung--
    I cannot sleep on Highland brae,
      I cannot pray in Highland tongue.But were I now where Allan[262] glides,
    Or heard my native Devan's[263] tides,
    So sweetly would I rest, and pray
    That Heaven would close my wintry day!'Twas thus my hair they bade me braid,
      They made me to the church repair;
    It was my bridal morn, they said,
      And my true love would meet me there.But woe betide the cruel guile,
    That drown'd in blood the morning smile![262] A beautiful stream which joins the Forth near Stirling.[263] A beautiful stream which joins the Forth near Stirling.She hovers o'er the hollow way,
    And flutters wide her mantle gray,
    As the lone heron spreads his wing,
    By twilight, o'er a haunted spring."--
    "'Tis Blanche of Devan," Murdoch said,
    "A crazed and captive Lowland maid,
    Ta'en on the morn she was a bride,
    When Roderick foray'd Devan-side;
    The gay bridegroom resistance made,
    And felt our Chief's unconquer'd blade.I marvel she is now at large,
    But oft she'scapes from Maudlin's charge.--
    Hence, brain-sick fool!"--He raised his bow:--
    "Now, if thou strikest her but one blow,
    I'll pitch thee from the cliff as far
    As ever peasant pitch'd a bar!"[264]--
    "Thanks, champion, thanks!"the maniac cried,
    And press'd her to Fitz-James's side."See the gray pennons I prepare,
    To seek my true love through the air!I will not lend that savage groom,
    To break his fall, one downy plume!No!--deep amid disjointed stones,
    The wolves shall batten[265] on his bones,
    And then shall his detested plaid,
    By bush and brier in mid air stayed,
    Wave forth a banner fair and free,
    Meet signal for their revelry."--

[264] "Pitching the bar" was a favorite athletic sport in Scotland."Hush thee, poor maiden, and be still!"thou look'st kindly, and I will.--
    Mine eye has dried and wasted been,
    But still it loves the Lincoln green;
    And, though mine ear is all unstrung,
    Still, still it loves the Lowland tongue."For oh my sweet William was forester true,
      He stole poor Blanche's heart away!His coat it was all of the greenwood hue,
      And so blithely he trill'd the Lowland lay!"It was not that I meant to tell...
    But thou art wise, and guessest well."Then, in a low and broken tone,
    And hurried note, the song went on.Still on the Clansman, fearfully,
    She fixed her apprehensive eye;
    Then turn'd it on the Knight, and then
    Her look glanced wildly o'er the glen."The toils are pitch'd, and the stakes are set,
      Ever sing merrily, merrily;
    The bows they bend, and the knives they whet,
      Hunters live so cheerily."It was a stag, a stag of ten,[266]
      Bearing its branches sturdily;
    He came stately down the glen,
      Ever sing hardily, hardily."It was there he met with a wounded doe,
      She was bleeding deathfully;
    She warn'd him of the toils below,
      Oh, so faithfully, faithfully!"He had an eye, and he could heed,
      Ever sing warily, warily;
    He had a foot, and he could speed--
      Hunters watch so narrowly."[267]

[266] Having antlers with ten branches.[267] "The hunters are Clan-Alpine's men; the stag of ten is
Fitz-James; the wounded doe is herself!"Fitz-James's mind was passion-toss'd,
    When Ellen's hints and fears were lost;
    But Murdoch's shout suspicion wrought,
    And Blanche's song conviction brought.--
    Not like a stag that spies the snare,
    But lion of the hunt aware,
    He waved at once his blade on high,
    "Disclose thy treachery, or die!"Forth at full speed the Clansman flew,
    But in his race his bow he drew.The shaft just grazed Fitz-James's crest,
    And thrill'd in Blanche's faded breast.--
    Murdoch of Alpine!prove thy speed,
    For ne'er had Alpine's son such need!With heart of fire, and foot of wind,
    The fierce avenger is behind!Fate judges of the rapid strife--
    The forfeit[268] death--the prize is life!Thy kindred ambush lies before,
    Close couch'd upon the heathery moor;
    Them couldst thou reach!--it may not be--
    Thine ambush'd kin thou ne'er shalt see,
    The fiery Saxon gains on thee!--Resistless speeds the deadly thrust,
    As lightning strikes the pine to dust;
    With foot and hand Fitz-James must strain,
    Ere he can win his blade again.Bent o'er the fall'n, with falcon eye,
    He grimly smiled to see him die;
    Then slower wended back his way,
    Where the poor maiden bleeding lay.She sate beneath the birchen tree,
    Her elbow resting on her knee;
    She had withdrawn the fatal shaft,
    And gazed on it, and feebly laugh'd;
    Her wreath of broom and feathers gray,
    Daggled[269] with blood, beside her lay.The Knight to stanch the life-stream tried,--
    "Stranger, it is in vain!""This hour of death has given me more
    Of reason's power than years before;
    For, as these ebbing veins decay,
    My frenzied visions fade away.A helpless injured wretch I die,
    And something tells me in thine eye,
    That thou wert mine avenger born.--
    Seest thou this tress?--Oh!still I've worn
    This little tress of yellow hair,
    Through danger, frenzy, and despair!It once was bright and clear as thine,
    But blood and tears have dimm'd its shine.I will not tell thee when 'twas shred,
    Nor from what guiltless victim's head--
    My brain would turn!--but it shall wave
    Like plumage on thy helmet brave,
    Till sun and wind shall bleach the stain,
    And thou wilt bring it me again.--
    I waver still.--O God!more bright
    Let reason beam her parting light!--
    Oh!by thy knighthood's honor'd sign,
    And for thy life preserved by mine,
    When thou shalt see a darksome man,
    Who boasts him Chief of Alpine's Clan,
    With tartans broad, and shadowy plume,
    And hand of blood, and brow of gloom,
    Be thy heart bold, thy weapon strong,
    And wreak[270] poor Blanche of Devan's wrong!They watch for thee by pass and fell...
    Avoid the path... O God!...A kindly heart had brave Fitz-James;
    Fast pour'd his eyes at pity's claims;
    And now with mingled grief and ire,
    He saw the murder'd maid expire."God, in my need, be my relief,
    As I wreak this on yonder Chief!"A lock from Blanche's tresses fair
    He blended with her bridegroom's hair;
    The mingled braid in blood he dyed,
    And placed it on his bonnet-side:
    "By Him whose word is truth!I swear,
    No other favor will I wear,
    Till this sad token I imbrue
    In the best blood of Roderick Dhu.The chase is up,--but they shall know,
    The stag at bay's a dangerous foe."Barr'd from the known but guarded way,
    Through copse and cliffs Fitz-James must stray,
    And oft must change his desperate track,
    By stream and precipice turn'd back.Heartless, fatigued, and faint, at length,
    From lack of food and loss of strength,
    He couch'd him in a thicket hoar,
    And thought his toils and perils o'er:--
    "Of all my rash adventures past,
    This frantic feat must prove the last!Who e'er so mad but might have guess'd,
    That all this Highland hornet's nest
    Would muster up in swarms so soon
    As e'er they heard of bands[271] at Doune?Like bloodhounds now they search me out,--
    Hark, to the whistle and the shout!--
    If farther through the wilds I go,
    I only fall upon the foe:
    I'll couch me here till evening gray,
    Then darkling try my dangerous way."The shades of eve come slowly down,
    The woods are wrapt in deeper brown,
    The owl awakens from her dell,
    The fox is heard upon the fell;
    Enough remains of glimmering light
    To guide the wanderer's steps aright,
    Yet not enough from far to show
    His figure to the watchful foe.With cautious step, and ear awake,
    He climbs the crag and threads the brake;
    And not the summer solstice,[272] there,
    Temper'd the midnight mountain air,
    But every breeze, that swept the wold,
    Benumb'd his drenched limbs with cold.In dread, in danger, and alone,
    Famish'd and chill'd, through ways unknown,
    Tangled and steep, he journey'd on;
    Till, as a rock's huge point he turn'd,
    A watch fire close before him burn'd.Beside its embers red and clear,
    Bask'd, in his plaid, a mountaineer;
    And up he sprung with sword in hand,--
    "Thy name and purpose?--
    "Rest and a guide, and food and fire.My life's beset, my path is lost,
    The gale has chill'd my limbs with frost."--
    "Art thou a friend to Roderick?"--"No."--
    "Thou darest not call thyself a foe?"to him and all the band
    He brings to aid his murderous hand."--
    "Bold words!--but, though the beast of game
    The privilege of chase may claim,
    Though space and law the stag we lend,
    Ere hound we slip,[273] or bow we bend,
    Who ever reck'd, where, how, or when,
    The prowling fox was trapp'd or slain?Thus treacherous scouts,--yet sure they lie,
    Who say them earnest a secret spy!"--
    "They do, by Heaven!--Come Roderick Dhu,
    And of his clan the boldest two,
    And let me but till morning rest,
    I write the falsehood on their crest."--
    "If by the blaze I mark aright,
    Thou bear'st the belt and spur of Knight."--
    "Then by these tokens mayest thou know
    Each proud oppressor's mortal foe."--
    "Enough, enough;--sit down, and share
    A soldier's couch, a soldier's fare."He gave him of his Highland cheer,
    The harden'd flesh of mountain deer;
    Dry fuel on the fire he laid,
    And bade the Saxon share his plaid.He tended him like welcome guest,
    Then thus his farther speech address'd:--
    "Stranger, I am to Roderick Dhu
    A clansman born, a kinsman true;
    Each word against his honor spoke,
    Demands of me avenging stroke;
    Yet more, upon thy fate, 'tis said,
    A mighty augury[274] is laid.It rests with me to wind my horn,--
    Thou art with numbers overborne;
    It rests with me, here, brand to brand,
    Worn as thou art, to bid thee stand:
    But, not for clan, nor kindred's cause,
    Will I depart from honor's laws;
    To assail a wearied man were shame,
    And stranger is a holy name;
    Guidance and rest, and food and fire,
    In vain he never must require.Then rest thee here till dawn of day;
    Myself will guide thee on the way,
    O'er stock and stone, through watch and ward,
    Till past Clan-Alpine's utmost guard,
    As far as Coilantogle's ford;
    From thence thy warrant[275] is thy sword."--
    "I take thy courtesy, by Heaven,
    As freely as 'tis nobly given!"--
    "Well, rest thee; for the bittern's cry
    Sings us the lake's wild lullaby."With that he shook the gather'd heath,
    And spread his plaid upon the wreath;
    And the brave foemen, side by side,
    Lay peaceful down, like brothers tried,
    And slept until the dawning beam
    Purpled the mountain and the stream.I.

    Fair as the earliest beam of eastern light,
        When first, by the bewilder'd pilgrim spied,
    It smiles upon the dreary brow of night,
        And silvers o'er the torrent's foaming tide,
    And lights the fearful path on mountain side;--
      Fair as that beam, although the fairest far,
    Giving to horror grace, to danger pride,
      Shine martial Faith, and Courtesy's bright star,
    Through all the wreckful storms that cloud the brow of War.That early beam, so fair and sheen,
    Was twinkling through the hazel screen,
    When, rousing at its glimmer red,
    The warriors left their lowly bed,
    Look'd out upon the dappled sky,
    Mutter'd their soldier matins by,
    And then awaked their fire, to steal,[276]
    As short and rude, their soldier meal.That o'er, the Gael around him threw
    His graceful plaid of varied hue,
    And, true to promise, led the way,
    By thicket green and mountain gray.A wildering path!--they winded now
    Along the precipice's brow,
    Commanding the rich scenes beneath,
    The windings of the Forth and Teith,
    And all the vales beneath that lie,
    Till Stirling's turrets melt in sky;
    Then, sunk in copse, their farthest glance
    Gain'd not the length of horseman's lance
    'Twas oft so steep, the foot was fain
    Assistance from the hand to gain;
    So tangled oft, that, bursting through,
    Each hawthorn shed her showers of dew,--
    That diamond dew, so pure and clear,
    It rivals all but Beauty's tear!At length they came where, stern and steep,
    The hill sinks down upon the deep.Here Vennachar in silver flows,
    There, ridge on ridge, Benledi rose;
    Ever the hollow path twined on,
    Beneath steep bank and threatening stone;
    An hundred men might hold the post
    With hardihood against a host.The rugged mountain's scanty cloak
    Was dwarfish shrubs of birch and oak,
    With shingles[277] bare, and cliffs between,
    And patches bright of bracken green,
    And heather black, that waved so high,
    It held the copse in rivalry.But where the lake slept deep and still,
    Dank[278] osiers fringed the swamp and hill;
    And oft both path and hill were torn,
    Where wintry torrent down had borne,
    And heap'd upon the cumber'd land
    Its wreck of gravel, rocks, and sand.So toilsome was the road to trace,
    The guide, abating of his pace,
    Led slowly through the pass's jaws,
    And ask'd Fitz-James, by what strange cause
    He sought these wilds, traversed by few,
    Without a pass from Roderick Dhu."Brave Gael, my pass in danger tried,
    Hangs in my belt, and by my side;
    Yet, sooth to tell," the Saxon said,
    "I dreamt not now to claim its aid.When here, but three days since, I came,
    Bewilder'd in pursuit of game,
    All seem'd as peaceful and as still
    As the mist slumbering on yon hill;
    Thy dangerous Chief was then afar,
    Nor soon expected back from war.Thus said, at least, my mountain guide,
    Though deep, perchance, the villain lied."--
    "Yet why a second venture try?"--
    "A warrior thou, and ask me why!--
    Moves our free course by such fix'd cause
    As gives the poor mechanic laws?Enough, I sought to drive away
    The lazy hours of peaceful day;
    Slight cause will then suffice to guide
    A Knight's free footsteps far and wide,--
    A falcon flown, a greyhound stray'd,
    The merry glance of mountain maid:
    Or, if a path be dangerous known,
    The danger's self is lure alone.""Thy secret keep, I urge thee not;--
    Yet, ere again ye sought this spot,
    Say, heard ye naught of Lowland war,
    Against Clan-Alpine, raised by Mar?"--"No, by my word;--of bands prepared
    To guard King James's sports I heard;
    Nor doubt I aught, but, when they hear
    This muster of the mountaineer,
    Their pennons will abroad be flung,
    Which else in Doune had peaceful hung."--
    "Free be they flung!--for we were loth
    Their silken folds should feast the moth.Free be they flung!--as free shall wave
    Clan-Alpine's pine in banner brave.But, Stranger, peaceful since you came,
    Bewilder'd in the mountain game,
    Whence the bold boast by which you show[279]
    Vich-Alpine's vow'd and mortal foe?"--
    "Warrior, but yester-morn, I knew
    Naught of thy Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
    Save as an outlaw'd desperate man,
    The chief of a rebellious clan,
    Who, in the Regent's[280] court and sight,
    With ruffian dagger stabb'd a knight:
    Yet this alone might from his part
    Sever each true and loyal heart."[280] Duke of Albany (see Introduction, p.Wrothful at such arraignment foul,
    Dark lower'd the clansman's sable scowl.A space he paused, then sternly said,
    "And heardst thou why he drew his blade?Heardst thou, that shameful word and blow
    Brought Roderick's vengeance on his foe?What reck'd the Chieftain if he stood
    On Highland heath, or Holy-Rood?He rights such wrong where it is given,
    If it were in the court of heaven."--
    "Still was it outrage;--yet, 'tis true,
    Not then claim'd sovereignty his due;
    While Albany, with feeble hand,
    Held borrow'd truncheon of command,
    The young King, mew'd[281] in Stirling tower,
    Was stranger to respect and power.[282]
    But then, thy Chieftain's robber life!--
    Winning mean prey by causeless strife,
    Wrenching from ruin'd Lowland swain
    His herds and harvest rear'd in vain.--
    Methinks a soul, like thine, should scorn
    The spoils from such foul foray borne."[282] That period of Scottish history from the battle of Flodden to the
majority of James V. was full of disorder and violence.The Gael beheld him grim the while,
    And answer'd with disdainful smile,--
    "Saxon, from yonder mountain high,
    I mark'd thee send delighted eye,
    Far to the south and east, where lay,
    Extended in succession gay,
    Deep waving fields and pastures green,
    With gentle <DW72>s and groves between:--
    These fertile plains, that soften'd vale,
    Were once the birthright of the Gael;
    The stranger came with iron hand,
    And from our fathers reft[283] the land.See, rudely swell
    Crag over crag, and fell o'er fell.Ask we this savage hill we tread,
    For fatten'd steer or household bread;
    Ask we for flocks these shingles dry,--
    And well the mountain might reply,
    'To you, as to your sires of yore,
    Belong the target and claymore!I give you shelter in my breast,
    Your own good blades must win the rest.'Pent in this fortress of the north,
    Thinkst thou we will not sally forth,
    To spoil the spoiler as we may,
    And from the robber rend the prey?Ay, by my soul!--While on yon plain
    The Saxon rears one shock of grain;
    While, of ten thousand herds, there strays
    But one along yon river's maze,--
    The Gael, of plain and river heir,
    Shall, with strong hand, redeem his share.Where live the mountain Chiefs who hold,
    That plundering Lowland field and fold
    Is aught but retribution true?Seek other cause 'gainst Roderick Dhu."Answer'd Fitz-James,--"And, if I sought,
    Thinkst thou no other could be brought?What deem ye of my path waylaid?My life given o'er to ambuscade?"--
    "As of a meed to rashness due:
    Hadst thou sent warning fair and true,--
    I seek my hound, or falcon stray'd,
    I seek, good faith,[284] a Highland maid,--
    Free hadst thou been to come and go;
    But secret path marks secret foe.Nor yet, for this, even as a spy,
    Hadst thou, unheard, been doom'd to die,
    Save to fulfill an augury."--
    "Well, let it pass; nor will I now
    Fresh cause of enmity avow,
    To chafe thy mood and cloud thy brow.Enough, I am by promise tied
    To match me with this man of pride:
    Twice have I sought Clan-Alpine's glen
    In peace; but when I come agen,
    I come with banner, brand, and bow,
    As leader seeks his mortal foe.For lovelorn swain, in lady's bower,
    Ne'er panted for the appointed hour,
    As I, until before me stand
    This rebel Chieftain and his band!"--

[284] "Good faith," i.e., in good faith.--He whistled shrill,
    And he was answer'd from the hill;
    Wild as the scream of the curlew,
    From crag to crag the signal flew.Instant, through copse and heath, arose
    Bonnets and spears and bended bows;
    On right, on left, above, below,
    Sprung up at once the lurking foe;
    From shingles gray their lances start,
    The bracken bush sends forth the dart,
    The rushes and the willow wand
    Are bristling into ax and brand,
    And every tuft of broom gives life
    To plaided warrior arm'd for strife.That whistle garrison'd the glen
    At once with full five hundred men,
    As if the yawning hill to heaven
    A subterranean host had given.Watching their leader's beck and will,
    All silent there they stood, and still.Like the loose crags, whose threatening mass
    Lay tottering o'er the hollow pass,
    As if an infant's touch could urge
    Their headlong passage down the verge,
    With step and weapon forward flung,
    Upon the mountain side they hung.The Mountaineer cast glance of pride
    Along Benledi's living side,
    Then fix'd his eye and sable brow
    Full on Fitz-James--"How say'st thou now?These are Clan-Alpine's warriors true;
    And, Saxon,--I am Roderick Dhu!"X.

    Fitz-James was brave:--Though to his heart
    The lifeblood thrill'd with sudden start,
    He mann'd himself with dauntless air,
    Return'd the Chief his haughty stare,
    His back against a rock he bore,
    And firmly placed his foot before:--
    "Come one, come all!this rock shall fly
    From its firm base as soon as I."Sir Roderick mark'd--and in his eyes
    Respect was mingled with surprise,
    And the stern joy which warriors feel
    In foemen worthy of their steel.Short space he stood--then waved his hand:
    Down sunk the disappearing band;
    Each warrior vanish'd where he stood,
    In broom or bracken, heath or wood;
    Sunk brand and spear and bended bow,
    In osiers pale and copses low;
    It seem'd as if their mother Earth
    Had swallowed up her warlike birth.The wind's last breath had toss'd in air
    Pennon, and plaid, and plumage fair,--
    The next but swept a lone hillside,
    Where heath and fern were waving wide:
    The sun's last glance was glinted[285] back,
    From spear and glaive, from targe and jack,--
    The next, all unreflected, shone
    On bracken green, and cold gray stone.Fitz-James look'd round--yet scarce believed
    The witness that his sight received;
    Such apparition well might seem
    Delusion of a dreadful dream.Sir Roderick in suspense he eyed,
    And to his look the Chief replied,
    "Fear naught--nay, that I need not say--
    But--doubt not aught from mine array.Thou art my guest;--I pledged my word
    As far as Coilantogle ford:
    Nor would I call a clansman's brand
    For aid against one valiant hand,
    Though on our strife lay every vale
    Rent by the Saxon from the Gael.So move we on;--I only meant
    To show the reed on which you leant,
    Deeming this path you might pursue
    Without a pass from Roderick Dhu."They mov'd:--I said Fitz-James was brave,
    As ever knight that belted glaive;
    Yet dare not say, that now his blood
    Kept on its wont and temper'd flood,[286]
    As, following Roderick's stride, he drew
    That seeming lonesome pathway through,
    Which yet, by fearful proof, was rife
    With lances, that, to take his life,
    Waited but signal from a guide
    So late dishonor'd and defied.Ever, by stealth, his eye sought round
    The vanish'd guardians of the ground,
    And still, from copse and heather deep,
    Fancy saw spear and broadsword peep,
    And in the plover's shrilly strain,
    The signal-whistle heard again.Nor breathed he free till far behind
    The pass was left; for then they wind
    Along a wide and level green,
    Where neither tree nor tuft was seen,
    Nor rush nor bush of broom was near,
    To hide a bonnet or a spear.The Chief in silence strode before,
    And reach'd that torrent's sounding shore,
    Which, daughter of three mighty lakes,[287]
    From Vennachar in silver breaks,
    Sweeps through the plain, and ceaseless mines
    On Bochastle the moldering lines,
    Where Rome, the Empress of the world,
    Of yore her eagle[288] wings unfurl'd.And here his course the Chieftain stayed,
    Threw down his target and his plaid,
    And to the Lowland warrior said,--
    "Bold Saxon!to his promise just,
    Vich-Alpine has discharged his trust.This murderous Chief, this ruthless man,
    This head of a rebellious clan,
    Hath led thee safe, through watch and ward,
    Far past Clan-Alpine's outmost guard.Now, man to man, and steel to steel,
    A Chieftain's vengeance thou shalt feel.See here, all vantageless[289] I stand,
    Arm'd, like thyself, with single brand:
    For this is Coilantogle ford,
    And thou must keep thee with thy sword."[287] Katrine, Achray, and Vennachar.[288] The eagle, with wings displayed and a thunderbolt in one of its
talons, was the ensign of the Roman legions.Ancient earthworks near
Bochastle are thought to date back to the Roman occupation of Britain.The Saxon paused:--"I ne'er delay'd
    When foeman bade me draw my blade;
    Nay, more, brave Chief, I vow'd thy death:
    Yet sure thy fair and generous faith,
    And my deep debt for life preserv'd,
    A better meed have well deserv'd:
    Can naught but blood our feud atone?And hear,--to fire thy flagging zeal,--
    The Saxon cause rests on thy steel;
    For thus spoke Fate, by prophet bred
    Between the living and the dead:
    'Who spills the foremost foeman's life,
    His party conquers in the strife.'"--
    "Then, by my word," the Saxon said,
    "The riddle is already read.Seek yonder brake beneath the cliff,--
    There lies Red Murdoch, stark and stiff.Thus Fate hath solved her prophecy,
    Then yield to Fate, and not to me.To James, at Stirling, let us go,
    When, if thou wilt be still his foe,
    Or if the King shall not agree
    To grant thee grace and favor free,[290]
    I plight mine honor, oath, and word,
    That, to thy native strengths[291] restored,
    With each advantage shalt thou stand,
    That aids thee now to guard thy land."Dark lightning flash'd from Roderick's eye--
    "Soars thy presumption, then, so high,
    Because a wretched kern ye slew,
    Homage to name to Roderick Dhu?He yields not, he, to man nor Fate!Thou add'st but fuel to my hate:--
    My clansman's blood demands revenge.Not yet prepared?--By Heaven, I change
    My thought, and hold thy valor light
    As that of some vain carpet knight,
    Who ill deserved my courteous care,
    And whose best boast is but to wear
    A braid of his fair lady's hair."--
    "I thank thee, Roderick, for the word!It nerves my heart, it steels my sword;
    For I have sworn this braid to stain
    In the best blood that warms thy vein.and, ruth, begone!--
    Yet think not that by thee alone,
    Proud Chief!can courtesy be shown;
    Though not from copse, or heath, or cairn,
    Start at my whistle clansmen stern,
    Of this small horn one feeble blast
    Would fearful odds against thee cast.But fear not--doubt not--which thou wilt--
    We try this quarrel hilt to hilt."--
    Then each at once his falchion drew,
    Each on the ground his scabbard threw,
    Each look'd to sun, and stream, and plain,
    As what they ne'er might see again;
    Then foot, and point, and eye opposed,
    In dubious strife they darkly closed.Ill fared it then with Roderick Dhu,
    That on the field his targe he threw,
    Whose brazen studs and tough bull hide
    Had death so often dash'd aside;
    For, train'd abroad[292] his arms to wield,
    Fitz-James's blade was sword and shield.He practiced every pass and ward,
    To thrust, to strike, to feint, to guard;
    While less expert, though stronger far,
    The Gael maintain'd unequal war.Three times in closing strife they stood,
    And thrice the Saxon blade drank blood;
    No stinted draught, no scanty tide,
    The gushing flood the tartans dyed.Fierce Roderick felt the fatal drain,
    And shower'd his blows like wintry rain;
    And, as firm rock, or castle roof,
    Against the winter shower is proof,
    The foe, invulnerable still,
    Foil'd his wild rage by steady skill;
    Till, at advantage ta'en, his brand
    Forced Roderick's weapon from his hand,
    And backward borne upon the lea,
    Brought the proud Chieftain to his knee."Now, yield thee, or by Him who made
    The world, thy heart's blood dyes my blade!"--
    "Thy threats, thy mercy, I defy!Let recreant yield, who fears to die."--Like adder darting from his coil,
    Like wolf that dashes through the toil,
    Like mountain cat who guards her young,
    Full at Fitz-James's throat he sprung;
    Received, but reck'd not of a wound,
    And lock'd his arms his foeman round.--
    Now, gallant Saxon, hold thine own!That desperate grasp thy frame might feel,
    Through bars of brass and triple steel!--
    They tug, they strain!down, down they go,
    The Gael above, Fitz-James below.The Chieftain's gripe his throat compress'd,
    His knee was planted in his breast;
    His clotted locks he backward threw,
    Across his brow his hand he drew,
    From blood and mist to clear his sight,
    Then gleam'd aloft his dagger bright!--
    --But hate and fury ill supplied
    The stream of life's exhausted tide,
    And all too late the advantage came,
    To turn the odds of deadly game;
    For, while the dagger gleam'd on high,
    Reel'd soul and sense, reel'd brain and eye.but in the heath
    The erring blade found bloodless sheath.The struggling foe may now unclasp
    The fainting Chief's relaxing grasp;
    Unwounded from the dreadful close,
    But breathless all, Fitz-James arose.He falter'd thanks to Heaven for life,
    Redeem'd, unhoped, from desperate strife;
    Next on his foe his look he cast,
    Whose every gasp appear'd his last;
    In Roderick's gore he dipt the braid,--
    "Poor Blanche!thy wrongs are dearly paid:
    Yet with thy foe must die, or live,
    The praise that Faith and Valor give."With that he blew a bugle note,
    Undid the collar from his throat,
    Unbonneted, and by the wave
    Sate down his brow and hands to lave.Then faint afar are heard the feet
    Of rushing steeds in gallop fleet;
    The sounds increase, and now are seen
    Four mounted squires in Lincoln green;
    Two who bear lance, and two who lead,
    By loosen'd rein, a saddled steed;
    Each onward held his headlong course,
    And by Fitz-James rein'd up his horse,--
    With wonder view'd the bloody spot--
    "Exclaim not, gallants!question not.--
    You, Herbert and Luffness, alight,
    And bind the wounds of yonder knight;
    Let the gray palfrey bear his weight,
    We destined for a fairer freight,
    And bring him on to Stirling straight;
    I will before at better speed,
    To seek fresh horse and fitting weed.The sun rides high;--I must be boune,
    To see the archer game at noon;
    But lightly Bayard clears the lea.--
    De Vaux and Herries, follow me."--the steed obey'd,
    With arching neck and bended head,
    And glancing eye and quivering ear,
    As if he loved his lord to hear.No foot Fitz-James in stirrup stayed,
    No grasp upon the saddle laid,
    But wreath'd his left hand in the mane,
    And lightly bounded from the plain,
    Turn'd on the horse his armed heel,
    And stirr'd his courage with the steel.[293]
    Bounded the fiery steed in air,
    The rider sate erect and fair,
    Then like a bolt from steel crossbow
    Forth launch'd, along the plain they go.They dash'd that rapid torrent through,
    And up Carhonie's[294] hill they flew;
    Still at the gallop prick'd[295] the Knight,
    His merry-men follow'd as they might.they ride,
    And in the race they mock thy tide;
    Torry and Lendrick now are past,
    And Deanstown lies behind them cast;
    They rise, the banner'd towers of Doune,
    They sink in distant woodland soon;
    Blair-Drummond sees the hoofs strike fire,
    They sweep like breeze through Ochtertyre;
    They mark just glance and disappear
    The lofty brow of ancient Kier;
    They bathe their coursers' sweltering sides,
    Dark Forth!amid thy sluggish tides,
    And on the opposing shore take ground,
    With plash, with scramble, and with bound.Right-hand they leave thy cliffs, Craig-Forth!And soon the bulwark of the North,
    Gray Stirling, with her towers and town,
    Upon their fleet career look'd down.[294] About a mile from the mouth of Lake Vennachar.As up the flinty path they strain'd,
    Sudden his steed the leader rein'd;
    A signal to his squire he flung,
    Who instant to his stirrup sprung:--
    "Seest thou, De Vaux, yon woodsman gray,
    Who townward holds the rocky way,
    Of stature tall and poor array?Mark'st thou the firm, yet active stride,
    With which he scales the mountain side?Know'st thou from whence he comes, or whom?"--
    "No, by my word;--a burly groom
    He seems, who in the field or chase
    A baron's train would nobly grace."--
    "Out, out, De Vaux!can fear supply,
    And jealousy, no sharper eye?Afar, ere to the hill he drew,
    That stately form and step I knew;
    Like form in Scotland is not seen,
    Treads not such step on Scottish green.'Tis James of Douglas, by St.Away, away, to court, to show
    The near approach of dreaded foe:
    The King must stand upon his guard;
    Douglas and he must meet prepared."Then right-hand wheel'd their steeds, and straight
    They won the Castle's postern gate.The Douglas, who had bent his way
    From Cambus-kenneth's Abbey gray,
    Now, as he climb'd the rocky shelf,
    Held sad communion with himself:--
    "Yes!all is true my fears could frame;
    A prisoner lies the noble Graeme,
    And fiery Roderick soon will feel
    The vengeance of the royal steel.I, only I, can ward their fate,--
    God grant the ransom come not late!The Abbess hath her promise given,
    My child shall be the bride of Heaven;[296]--
    --Be pardon'd one repining tear!For He, who gave her, knows how dear,
    How excellent!but that is by,
    And now my business is--to die.within whose circuit dread
    A Douglas[297] by his sovereign bled;
    And thou, O sad and fatal mound![298]
    That oft hast heard the death-ax sound,
    As on the noblest of the land
    Fell the stern headsman's bloody hand,--
    The dungeon, block, and nameless tomb
    Prepare--for Douglas seeks his doom!--
    --But hark!what blithe and jolly peal
    Makes the Franciscan[299] steeple reel?upon the crowded street,
    In motley groups what maskers meet!Banner and pageant, pipe and drum,
    And merry morris dancers[300] come.I guess, by all this quaint array,
    The burghers hold their sports to-day.[301]
    James will be there; he loves such show,
    Where the good yeoman bends his bow,
    And the tough wrestler foils his foe,
    As well as where, in proud career,
    The high-born tilter shivers spear.I'll follow to the Castle-park,
    And play my prize;--King James shall mark,
    If age has tamed these sinews stark,[302]
    Whose force so oft, in happier days,
    His boyish wonder loved to praise."[296] "Bride of Heaven," i.e., a nun.[297] William, eighth earl of Douglas, was stabbed by James II.while
in Stirling Castle, and under royal safe-conduct.[298] "Heading Hill," where executions took place.[299] A church of the Franciscans or Gray Friars was built near the
castle, in 1494, by James IV.[300] The morris dance was of Moorish origin, and brought from Spain
to England, where it was combined with the national Mayday games.The
dress of the dancers was adorned with party- ribbons, and little
bells were attached to their anklets, armlets, or girdles.The dancers
often personated various fictitious characters.[301] Every borough had its solemn play or festival, where archery,
wrestling, hurling the bar, and other athletic exercises, were engaged
in.The Castle gates were open flung,
    The quivering drawbridge rock'd and rung,
    And echo'd loud the flinty street
    Beneath the coursers' clattering feet,
    As slowly down the steep descent
    Fair Scotland's King and nobles went,
    While all along the crowded way
    Was jubilee and loud huzza.And ever James was bending low,
    To his white jennet's[303] saddlebow,
    Doffing his cap to city dame,
    Who smiled and blush'd for pride and shame.And well the simperer might be vain,--
    He chose the fairest of the train.Gravely he greets each city sire,
    Commends each pageant's quaint attire,
    Gives to the dancers thanks aloud,
    And smiles and nods upon the crowd,
    Who rend the heavens with their acclaims,--
    "Long live the Commons' King,[304] King James!"Behind the King throng'd peer and knight,
    And noble dame, and damsel bright,
    Whose fiery steeds ill brook'd the stay
    Of the steep street and crowded way.--But in the train you might discern
    Dark lowering brow, and visage stern:
    There nobles mourn'd their pride restrain'd,
    And the mean burgher's joys disdain'd;
    And chiefs, who, hostage for their clan,
    Were each from home a banish'd man,
    There thought upon their own gray tower,
    Their waving woods, their feudal power,
    And deem'd themselves a shameful part
    Of pageant which they cursed in heart.in France, James V.
had checked the lawless nobles, and favored the commons or burghers.Now, in the Castle-park, drew out
    Their checker'd[305] bands the joyous rout.There morrisers, with bell at heel,
    And blade in hand, their mazes wheel;
    But chief, beside the butts, there stand
    Bold Robin Hood[306] and all his band,--
    Friar Tuck with quarterstaff and cowl,
    Old Scathlock with his surly scowl,
    Maid Marian, fair as ivory bone,
    Scarlet, and Mutch, and Little John;[307]
    Their bugles challenge all that will,
    In archery to prove their skill.The Douglas bent a bow of might,--
    His first shaft centered in the white,
    And when in turn he shot again,
    His second split the first in twain.From the King's hand must Douglas take
    A silver dart,[308] the archer's stake;
    Fondly he watch'd, with watery eye,
    Some answering glance of sympathy,--
    No kind emotion made reply!Indifferent as to archer wight,[309]
    The Monarch gave the arrow bright.[305] In clothing of varied form and color.[306] A renowned English outlaw and robber, supposed to have lived at
the end of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century, and to
have frequented Sherwood Forest.Characters representing him and his
followers were often introduced into the popular games.[307] All six were followers of Robin Hood.[308] The usual prize to the best shooter was a silver arrow.[309] A simple, ordinary archer.for, hand to hand,
    The manly wrestlers take their stand.Two o'er the rest superior rose,
    And proud demanded mightier foes,
    Nor call'd in vain; for Douglas came.--For life is Hugh of Larbert lame;
    Scarce better John of Alloa's fare,
    Whom senseless home his comrades bear.Prize of the wrestling match, the King
    To Douglas gave a golden ring,
    While coldly glanced his eye of blue,
    As frozen drop of wintry dew.Douglas would speak, but in his breast
    His struggling soul his words suppress'd;
    Indignant then he turn'd him where
    Their arms the brawny yeoman bare,
    To hurl the massive bar in air.When each his utmost strength had shown,
    The Douglas rent an earth-fast stone
    From its deep bed, then heaved it high,
    And sent the fragment through the sky,
    A rood beyond the farthest mark;--
    And still in Stirling's royal park,
    The gray-haired sires, who know the past,
    To strangers point the Douglas-cast,[310]
    And moralize on the decay
    Of Scottish strength in modern day.The vale with loud applauses rang,
    The Ladies' Rock[311] sent back the clang.The King, with look unmoved, bestow'd
    A purse well fill'd with pieces broad.Indignant smiled the Douglas proud,
    And threw the gold among the crowd,
    Who now, with anxious wonder, scan,
    And sharper glance, the dark gray man;
    Till whispers rose among the throng,
    That heart so free, and hand so strong,
    Must to the Douglas blood belong;
    The old men mark'd, and shook the head,
    To see his hair with silver spread,
    And wink'd aside, and told each son
    Of feats upon the English done,
    Ere Douglas of the stalwart hand
    Was exiled from his native land.The women praised his stately form,
    Though wreck'd by many a winter's storm;
    The youth with awe and wonder saw
    His strength surpassing nature's law.Thus judged, as is their wont, the crowd,
    Till murmur rose to clamors loud.But not a glance from that proud ring
    Of peers who circled round the King,
    With Douglas held communion kind,
    Or call'd the banish'd man to mind;
    No, not from those who, at the chase,
    Once held his side the honor'd place,
    Begirt[312] his board, and, in the field,
    Found safety underneath his shield;
    For he, whom royal eyes disown,
    When was his form to courtiers known![311] A point from which the ladies of the court viewed the games.The Monarch saw the gambols flag,
    And bade let loose a gallant stag,
    Whose pride, the holiday to crown,
    Two favorite greyhounds should pull down,
    That venison free, and Bordeaux wine,
    Might serve the archery to dine.But Lufra,--whom from Douglas' side
    Nor bribe nor threat could e'er divide,
    The fleetest hound in all the North,--
    Brave Lufra saw, and darted forth.She left the royal hounds midway,
    And dashing on the antler'd prey,
    Sunk her sharp muzzle in his flank,
    And deep the flowing lifeblood drank.The King's stout huntsman saw the sport
    By strange intruder broken short,
    Came up, and with his leash unbound,
    In anger struck the noble hound.--The Douglas had endured, that morn,
    The King's cold look, the nobles' scorn,
    And last, and worst to spirit proud,
    Had borne the pity of the crowd;
    But Lufra had been fondly bred,
    To share his board, to watch his bed,
    And oft would Ellen, Lufra's neck
    In maiden glee with garlands deck;
    They were such playmates, that with name
    Of Lufra, Ellen's image came.His stifled wrath is brimming high,
    In darken'd brow and flashing eye;
    As waves before the bark divide,
    The crowd gave way before his stride;
    Needs but a buffet and no more,
    The groom lies senseless in his gore.Such blow no other hand could deal
    Though gauntleted in glove of steel.Then clamor'd loud the royal train,
    And brandish'd swords and staves amain.But stern the baron's warning--"Back!Back, on[313] your lives, ye menial pack!behold,
    King James!The Douglas, doom'd of old,
    And vainly sought for near and far,
    A victim to atone the war,
    A willing victim, now attends,
    Nor craves thy grace but for his friends."--
    "Thus is my clemency repaid?the Monarch said;
    "Of thy mis-proud[314] ambitious clan,
    Thou, James of Bothwell, wert the man,
    The only man, in whom a foe
    My woman mercy would not know:
    But shall a Monarch's presence brook
    Injurious blow, and haughty look?--
    What ho!Give the offender fitting ward.--
    Break off the sports!"--for tumult rose,
    And yeomen 'gan to bend their bows,--
    "Break off the sports!"he said, and frown'd,
    "And bid our horsemen clear the ground."Then uproar wild and misarray[315]
    Marr'd the fair form of festal day.The horsemen prick'd among the crowd,
    Repell'd by threats and insult loud;
    To earth are borne the old and weak,
    The timorous fly, the women shriek;
    With flint, with shaft, with staff, with bar,
    The hardier urge tumultuous war.At once round Douglas darkly sweep
    The royal spears in circle deep,
    And slowly scale the pathway steep;
    While on the rear in thunder pour
    The rabble with disorder'd roar.With grief the noble Douglas saw
    The Commons rise against the law,
    And to the leading soldier said,--
    "Sir John of Hyndford![316] 'twas my blade
    That knighthood on thy shoulder laid;[317]
    For that good deed, permit me then
    A word with these misguided men."[317] Knighthood was conferred by a slight blow with the flat of a
sword on the back of the kneeling candidate.ere yet for me
    Ye break the bands of fealty.My life, my honor, and my cause,
    I tender free to Scotland's laws.Are these so weak as must require
    The aid of your misguided ire?Or, if I suffer causeless wrong,
    Is then my selfish rage so strong,
    My sense of public weal so low,
    That, for mean vengeance on a foe,
    Those cords of love I should unbind,
    Which knit my country and my kind?Believe, in yonder tower
    It will not soothe my captive hour,
    To know those spears our foes should dread,
    For me in kindred gore are red;
    To know, in fruitless brawl begun
    For me, that mother wails her son;
    For me, that widow's mate expires;
    For me, that orphans weep their sires;
    That patriots mourn insulted laws,
    And curse the Douglas for the cause.Oh, let your patience ward[318] such ill,
    And keep your right to love me still!"The crowd's wild fury sunk again
    In tears, as tempests melt in rain.With lifted hands and eyes, they pray'd
    For blessings on his generous head,
    Who for his country felt alone,
    And prized her blood beyond his own.Old men, upon the verge of life,
    Bless'd him who stayed the civil strife;
    And mothers held their babes on high,
    The self-devoted Chief to spy,
    Triumphant over wrongs and ire,
    To whom the prattlers owed a sire:
    Even the rough soldier's heart was moved;
    As if behind some bier beloved,
    With trailing arms and drooping head,
    The Douglas up the hill he led,
    And at the Castle's battled verge,
    With sighs resign'd his honor'd charge.The offended Monarch rode apart,
    With bitter thought and swelling heart,
    And would not now vouchsafe again
    Through Stirling streets to lead his train.--
    "O Lennox, who would wish to rule
    This changeling[319] crowd, this common fool?Hear'st thou," he said, "the loud acclaim
    With which they shout the Douglas name?With like acclaim, the vulgar throat
    Strain'd for King James their morning note;
    With like acclaim they hail'd the day
    When first I broke the Douglas' sway;
    And like acclaim would Douglas greet,
    If he could hurl me from my seat.Who o'er the herd would wish to reign,
    Fantastic, fickle, fierce, and vain!Vain as the leaf upon the stream,
    And fickle as a changeful dream;
    Fantastic as a woman's mood,
    And fierce as Frenzy's fever'd blood,
    Thou many-headed monster thing,
    Oh, who would wish to be thy king!"what messenger of speed
    Spurs hitherward his panting steed?I guess his cognizance[320] afar--
    What from our cousin,[321] John of Mar?"--
    "He prays, my liege, your sports keep bound
    Within the safe and guarded ground:
    For some foul purpose yet unknown,--
    Most sure for evil to the throne,--
    The outlaw'd Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
    Has summon'd his rebellious crew;
    'Tis said, in James of Bothwell's aid
    These loose banditti stand array'd.The Earl of Mar, this morn, from Doune,
    To break their muster march'd, and soon
    Your grace will hear of battle fought;
    But earnestly the Earl besought,
    Till for such danger he provide,
    With scanty train you will not ride."[321] Monarchs frequently applied this epithet to their noblemen, even
when no blood relationship existed."Thou warn'st me I have done amiss,--
    I should have earlier look'd to this:
    I lost it in this bustling day.--Retrace with speed thy former way;
    Spare not for spoiling of thy steed,
    The best of mine shall be thy meed.Say to our faithful Lord of Mar,
    We do forbid the intended war:
    Roderick, this morn, in single fight,
    Was made our prisoner by a knight;
    And Douglas hath himself and cause
    Submitted to our kingdom's laws.The tidings of their leaders lost
    Will soon dissolve the mountain host,
    Nor would we that the vulgar feel,
    For their Chief's crimes, avenging steel.Bear Mar our message, Braco: fly!"--
    He turn'd his steed,--"My liege, I hie,--
    Yet, ere I cross this lily lawn,
    I fear the broadswords will be drawn."The turf the flying courser spurn'd,
    And to his towers the King return'd.Ill with King James's mood that day,
    Suited gay feast and minstrel lay;
    Soon were dismiss'd the courtly throng,
    And soon cut short the festal song.Nor less upon the sadden'd town
    The evening sunk in sorrow down.The burghers spoke of civil jar,
    Of rumor'd feuds and mountain war,
    Of Moray, Mar, and Roderick Dhu,
    All up in arms:--the Douglas too,
    They mourn'd him pent within the hold,
    "Where stout Earl William[322] was of old."--
    And there his word the speaker stayed,
    And finger on his lip he laid,
    Or pointed to his dagger blade.But jaded horsemen, from the west,
    At evening to the Castle press'd;
    And busy talkers said they bore
    Tidings of fight on Katrine's shore;
    At noon the deadly fray begun,
    And lasted till the set of sun.Thus giddy rumor shook the town,
    Till closed the Night her pennons brown.[322] The Douglas who was stabbed by James II.I.

    The sun, awakening, through the smoky air
      Of the dark city casts a sullen glance,
    Rousing each caitiff[323] to his task of care,
      Of sinful man the sad inheritance;
    Summoning revelers from the lagging dance,
      Scaring the prowling robber to his den;
    Gilding on battled tower the warder's lance,
      And warning student pale to leave his pen,
    And yield his drowsy eyes to the kind nurse of men.what scenes of woe,
      Are witness'd by that red and struggling beam!The fever'd patient, from his pallet low,
      Through crowded hospital beholds its stream;
    The ruin'd maiden trembles at its gleam,
      The debtor wakes to thought of gyve and jail,
    The lovelorn wretch starts from tormenting dream;
      The wakeful mother, by the glimmering pale,
    Trims her sick infant's couch, and soothes his feeble wail.Mary went back to the bedroom.At dawn the towers of Stirling rang
    With soldier step and weapon clang,
    While drums, with rolling note, foretell
    Relief to weary sentinel.Through narrow loop and casement barr'd,
    The sunbeams sought the Court of Guard,
    And, struggling with the smoky air,
    Deaden'd the torches' yellow glare.In comfortless alliance shone
    The lights through arch of blacken'd stone,
    And show'd wild shapes in garb of war,
    Faces deform'd with beard and scar,
    All haggard from the midnight watch,
    And fever'd with the stern debauch;
    For the oak table's massive board,
    Flooded with wine, with fragments stored,
    And beakers drain'd, and cups o'erthrown,
    Show'd in what sport the night had flown.Some, weary, snored on floor and bench;
    Some labor'd still their thirst to quench;
    Some, chill'd with watching, spread their hands
    O'er the huge chimney's dying brands,
    While round them, or beside them flung,
    At every step their harness[324] rung.[324] Armor and other accouterments of war.These drew not for their fields the sword,
    Like tenants of a feudal lord,
    Nor own'd the patriarchal claim
    Of Chieftain in their leader's name;
    Adventurers[325] they, from far who roved,
    To live by battle which they loved.There the Italian's clouded face,
    The swarthy Spaniard's there you trace;
    The mountain-loving Switzer[326] there
    More freely breathed in mountain air;
    The Fleming[327] there despised the soil,
    That paid so ill the laborer's toil;
    Their rolls show'd French and German name;
    And merry England's exiles came,
    To share, with ill-conceal'd disdain,
    Of Scotland's pay the scanty gain.All brave in arms, well train'd to wield
    The heavy halberd, brand, and shield;
    In camps licentious, wild, and bold;
    In pillage fierce and uncontroll'd;
    And now, by holytide[328] and feast,
    From rules of discipline released.[325] James V. was the first to increase the army furnished by
the nobles and their vassals by the addition of a small number of
mercenaries.[327] An inhabitant of Flanders, as Belgium was then called.They held debate of bloody fray,
    Fought 'twixt Loch Katrine and Achray.Fierce was their speech, and,'mid their words,
    Their hands oft grappled to their swords;
    Nor sunk their tone to spare the ear
    Of wounded comrades groaning near,
    Whose mangled limbs, and bodies gored,
    Bore token of the mountain sword,
    Though, neighboring to the Court of Guard,
    Their prayers and feverish wails were heard;
    Sad burden to the ruffian joke,
    And savage oath by fury spoke!--
    At length up started John of Brent,
    A yeoman from the banks of Trent;
    A stranger to respect or fear,
    In peace a chaser[329] of the deer,
    In host[330] a hardy mutineer,
    But still the boldest of the crew,
    When deed of danger was to do.He grieved, that day, their games cut short,
    And marr'd the dicer's brawling sport,
    And shouted loud, "Renew the bowl!And, while a merry catch I troll,
    Let each the buxom chorus bear,
    Like brethren of the brand and spear."V.

SOLDIER'S SONG.Our vicar still preaches that Peter and Poule[331]
    Laid a swinging[332] long curse on the bonny brown bowl,
    That there's wrath and despair in the jolly black-jack,[333]
    And the seven deadly sins in a flagon of sack;[334]
    Yet whoop, Barnaby!off with thy liquor,
    Drink upsees out,[335] and a fig for the vicar!Our vicar he calls it damnation to sip
    The ripe ruddy dew of a woman's dear lip,
    Says, that Beelzebub[336] lurks in her kerchief so sly,
    And Apollyon[337] shoots darts from her merry black eye;
    Yet whoop, Jack!kiss Gillian the quicker,
    Till she bloom like a rose, and a fig for the vicar!Our vicar thus preaches--and why should he not?For the dues of his cure are the placket and pot;[338]
    And 'tis right of his office poor laymen to lurch,
    Who infringe the domains of our good Mother Church.off with your liquor,
    Sweet Marjorie's the word, and a fig for the vicar![335] "Upsees out," i.e., in the Dutch fashion, or deeply.[338] "Placket and pot," i.e., women and wine.The warder's challenge, heard without,
    Stayed in mid-roar the merry shout.A soldier to the portal went,--
    "Here is old Bertram, sirs, of Ghent;
    And,--beat for jubilee the drum!--
    A maid and minstrel with him come."Bertram, a Fleming, gray and scarr'd,
    Was entering now the Court of Guard,
    A harper with him, and in plaid
    All muffled close, a mountain maid,
    Who backward shrunk to'scape the view
    Of the loose scene and boisterous crew.they roar'd.--"I only know,
    From noon till eve we fought with foe
    As wild and as untamable
    As the rude mountains where they dwell;
    On both sides store of blood is lost,
    Nor much success can either boast."--
    "But whence thy captives, friend?such spoil
    As theirs must needs reward thy toil.Old dost thou wax, and wars grow sharp;
    Thou now hast glee-maiden and harp!Get thee an ape, and trudge the land,
    The leader of a juggler band.""No, comrade;--no such fortune mine.After the fight, these sought our line,
    That aged Harper and the girl,
    And, having audience of the Earl,
    Mar bade I should purvey them steed,
    And bring them hitherward with speed.Forbear your mirth and rude alarm,
    For none shall do them shame or harm."--
    "Hear ye his boast?"cried John of Brent,
    Ever to strife and jangling bent;
    "Shall he strike doe beside our lodge,
    And yet the jealous niggard grudge
    To pay the forester his fee?I'll have my share, howe'er it be,
    Despite of Moray, Mar, or thee."Bertram his forward step withstood;
    And, burning in his vengeful mood,
    Old Allan, though unfit for strife,
    Laid hand upon his dagger knife;
    But Ellen boldly stepp'd between,
    And dropp'd at once the tartan screen:--
    So, from his morning cloud, appears
    The sun of May, through summer tears.The savage soldiery, amazed,
    As on descended angel gazed;
    Even hardy Brent, abash'd and tamed,
    Stood half admiring, half ashamed.Boldly she spoke,--"Soldiers, attend!My father was the soldier's friend;
    Cheer'd him in camps, in marches led,
    And with him in the battle bled.Not from the valiant, or the strong,
    Should exile's daughter suffer wrong."--
    Answer'd De Brent, most forward still
    In every feat or good or ill,--
    "I shame me of the part I play'd;
    And thou an outlaw's child, poor maid!An outlaw I by forest laws,
    And merry Needwood[339] knows the cause.Poor Rose,--if Rose be living now,"--
    He wiped his iron eye and brow,--
    "Must bear such age, I think, as thou.--
    Hear ye, my mates;--I go to call
    The Captain of our watch to hall:
    There lies my halberd on the floor;
    And he that steps my halberd o'er,
    To do the maid injurious part,
    My shaft shall quiver in his heart!--
    Beware loose speech, or jesting rough:
    Ye all know John de Brent.[339] A royal forest in Staffordshire.Their Captain came, a gallant young,--
    Of Tullibardine's[340] house he sprung,--
    Nor wore he yet the spurs of knight;
    Gay was his mien, his humor light,
    And, though by courtesy controll'd,
    Forward his speech, his bearing bold.The high-born maiden ill could brook
    The scanning of his curious look
    And dauntless eye;--and yet, in sooth,
    Young Lewis was a generous youth;
    But Ellen's lovely face and mien,
    Ill suited to the garb and scene,
    Might lightly bear construction strange,
    And give loose fancy scope to range."Welcome to Stirling towers, fair maid!Come ye to seek a champion's aid,
    On palfrey white, with harper hoar,
    Like errant damosel[341] of yore?Does thy high quest[342] a knight require,
    Or may the venture suit a squire?"--
    Her dark eye flash'd;--she paused and sigh'd,--
    "Oh, what have I to do with pride!--
    Through scenes of sorrow, shame, and strife,
    A suppliant for a father's life,
    I crave an audience of the King.Behold, to back my suit, a ring,
    The royal pledge of grateful claims,
    Given by the Monarch to Fitz-James."[340] Tullibardine was an old seat of the Murrays in Perthshire.[341] In the days of chivalry any oppressed "damosel" could obtain
redress by applying to the court of the nearest king, where some knight
became her champion.X.

    The signet ring young Lewis took,
    With deep respect and alter'd look;
    And said,--"This ring our duties own;
    And pardon, if to worth unknown,
    In semblance mean, obscurely veil'd,
    Lady, in aught my folly fail'd.Soon as the day flings wide his gates,
    The King shall know what suitor waits.Please you, meanwhile, in fitting bower
    Repose you till his waking hour;
    Female attendance shall obey
    Your hest, for service or array.But, ere she followed, with the grace
    And open bounty of her race,
    She bade her slender purse be shared
    Among the soldiers of the guard.The rest with thanks their guerdon took;
    But Brent, with shy and awkward look,
    On the reluctant maiden's hold
    Forced bluntly back the proffer'd gold;--
    "Forgive a haughty English heart,
    And oh, forget its ruder part!The vacant purse shall be my share,
    Which in my barret cap I'll bear,
    Perchance, in jeopardy of war,
    Where gayer crests may keep afar."With thanks--'twas all she could--the maid
    His rugged courtesy repaid.When Ellen forth with Lewis went,
    Allan made suit to John of Brent:--
    "My lady safe, oh, let your grace
    Give me to see my master's face!His minstrel I,--to share his doom
    Bound from the cradle to the tomb.Tenth in descent, since first my sires
    Waked for his noble house their lyres,
    Nor one of all the race was known
    But prized its weal above their own.With the Chief's birth begins our care;
    Our harp must soothe the infant heir,
    Teach the youth tales of fight, and grace
    His earliest feat of field or chase;
    In peace, in war, our rank we keep,
    We cheer his board, we soothe his sleep,
    Nor leave him till we pour our verse--
    A doleful tribute!--o'er his hearse.Then let me share his captive lot;
    It is my right--deny it not!"--
    "Little we reck," said John of Brent,
    "We Southern men, of long descent;
    Nor wot we how a name--a word--
    Makes clansmen vassals to a lord:
    Yet kind my noble landlord's part,--
    God bless the house of Beaudesert!And, but I loved to drive the deer,
    More than to guide the laboring steer,
    I had not dwelt an outcast here.Come, good old Minstrel, follow me;
    Thy Lord and Chieftain shalt thou see."Then, from a rusted iron hook,
    A bunch of ponderous keys he took,
    Lighted a torch, and Allan led
    Through grated arch and passage dread.Portals they pass'd, where, deep within,
    Spoke prisoner's moan, and fetters' din;
    Through rugged vaults, where, loosely stored,
    Lay wheel, and ax, and headsman's sword,
    And many an hideous engine grim,
    For wrenching joint, and crushing limb,
    By artist form'd, who deemed it shame
    And sin to give their work a name.They halted at a low-brow'd porch,
    And Brent to Allan gave the torch,
    While bolt and chain he backward roll'd,
    And made the bar unhasp its hold.They enter'd:--'twas a prison room
    Of stern security and gloom,
    Yet not a dungeon; for the day
    Through lofty gratings found its way,
    And rude and antique garniture
    Deck'd the sad walls and oaken floor;
    Such as the rugged days of old
    Deem'd fit for captive noble's hold.[343]
    "Here," said De Brent, "thou mayst remain
    Till the Leech[344] visit him again.Strict is his charge, the warders tell,
    To tend the noble prisoner well."Retiring then, the bolt he drew,
    And the lock's murmurs growl'd anew.Roused at the sound, from lowly bed
    A captive feebly raised his head;
    The wondering Minstrel look'd, and knew--
    Not his dear lord, but Roderick Dhu!For, come from where Clan-Alpine fought,
    They, erring, deem'd the Chief he sought.As the tall ship, whose lofty prore[345]
    Shall never stem the billows more,
    Deserted by her gallant band,
    Amid the breakers lies astrand,[346]
    So, on his couch, lay Roderick Dhu!And oft his fever'd limbs he threw
    In toss abrupt, as when her sides
    Lie rocking in the advancing tides,
    That shake her frame with ceaseless beat,
    Yet cannot heave her from the seat;--
    Oh, how unlike her course on sea!Or his free step on hill and lea!--
    Soon as the Minstrel he could scan,
    "What of thy lady?--of my clan?--
    My mother?--Douglas?--tell me all.Yet speak,--speak boldly,--do not fear."--
    (For Allan, who his mood well knew,
    Was choked with grief and terror too.)"Who fought--who fled?--Old man, be brief;--
    Some might--for they had lost their Chief.Who basely live?--who bravely died?"--
    "Oh, calm thee, Chief!"the Minstrel cried;
    "Ellen is safe;"--"For that, thank Heaven!"--
    "And hopes are for the Douglas given;--
    The lady Margaret, too, is well;
    And, for thy clan,--on field or fell,
    Has never harp of minstrel told
    Of combat fought so true and bold.Thy stately Pine is yet unbent,
    Though many a goodly bough is rent."The Chieftain rear'd his form on high,
    And fever's fire was in his eye;
    But ghastly, pale, and livid streaks
    Checker'd his swarthy brow and cheeks.I have heard thee play,
    With measure bold, on festal day,
    In yon lone isle,... again where ne'er
    Shall harper play, or warrior hear!That stirring air that peals on high,
    O'er Dermid's[347] race our victory.--
    Strike it!--and then, (for well thou canst,)
    Free from thy minstrel spirit glanced,
    Fling me the picture of the fight,
    When met my clan the Saxon might.I'll listen, till my fancy hears
    The clang of swords, the crash of spears!These grates, these walls, shall vanish then,
    For the fair field of fighting men,
    And my free spirit burst away,
    As if it soar'd from battle fray."The trembling Bard with awe obey'd,--
    Slow on the harp his hand he laid;
    But soon remembrance of the sight
    He witness'd from the mountain's height,
    With what old Bertram told at night,
    Awaken'd the full power of song,
    And bore him in career along;--
    As shallop launch'd on river's tide,
    That slow and fearful leaves the side,
    But, when it feels the middle stream,
    Drives downward swift as lightning's beam.The Clan-Alpine, or the MacGregors, and the
Campbells, were hereditary enemies.BATTLE OF BEAL' AN DUINE."The Minstrel came once more to view
    The eastern ridge of Benvenue,
    For ere he parted, he would say
    Farewell to lovely Loch Achray--
    Where shall he find, in foreign land,
    So lone a lake, so sweet a strand!There is no breeze upon the fern,
        Nor ripple on the lake,
      Upon her eyry nods the erne,[348]
        The deer has sought the brake;
      The small birds will not sing aloud,
        The springing trout lies still,
      So darkly glooms yon thunder cloud,
      That swathes, as with a purple shroud,
        Benledi's distant hill.Is it the thunder's solemn sound
        That mutters deep and dread,
      Or echoes from the groaning ground
        The warrior's measured tread?Is it the lightning's quivering glance
        That on the thicket streams,
      Or do they flash on spear and lance
        The sun's retiring beams?I see the dagger crest of Mar,
    I see the Moray's silver star,
    Wave o'er the cloud of Saxon war,
    That up the lake comes winding far!To hero bound for battle strife,
        Or bard of martial lay,
      'Twere worth ten years of peaceful life,
        One glance at their array!"[348] The sea eagle or osprey."Their light arm'd archers far and near
        Survey'd the tangled ground;
      Their center ranks, with pike and spear,
        A twilight forest frown'd;
      Their barbed[349] horsemen, in the rear,
        The stern battalia[350] crown'd.No cymbal clash'd, no clarion rang,
        Still were the pipe and drum;
      Save heavy tread, and armor's clang,
        The sullen march was dumb.There breathed no wind their crests to shake,
        Or wave their flags abroad;
      Scarce the frail aspen seem'd to quake,
        That shadow'd o'er their road.Their vaward[351] scouts no tidings bring,
        Can rouse no lurking foe,
      Nor spy a trace of living thing,
        Save when they stirr'd the roe;
      The host moves like a deep-sea wave,
      Where rise no rocks its pride to brave,
        High swelling, dark, and slow.The lake is pass'd, and now they gain
    A narrow and a broken plain,
    Before the Trosachs' rugged jaws;
    And here the horse and spearmen pause.While, to explore the dangerous glen,
    Dive through the pass the archer men.""At once there rose so wild a yell
    Within that dark and narrow dell,
    As all the fiends, from heaven that fell,
    Had peal'd the banner cry of hell!Forth from the pass in tumult driven,
      Like chaff before the wind of heaven,
        The archery appear;
      For life!their plight they ply--
      And shriek, and shout, and battle cry,
      And plaids and bonnets waving high,
      And broadswords flashing to the sky,
        Are maddening in the rear.Onward they drive, in dreadful race,
        Pursuers and pursued;
      Before that tide of flight and chase,
      How shall it keep its rooted place,
        The spearmen's twilight wood?--
      'Down, down,' cried Mar, 'your lances down!--
      Like reeds before the tempest's frown,
      That serried grove of lances brown
        At once lay level'd low;
      And closely shouldering side to side,
      The bristling ranks the onset bide.--
      'We'll quell the savage mountaineer,
        As their Tinchel[352] cows the game!They come as fleet as forest deer,
        We'll drive them back as tame.'"--

[352] A circle of sportsmen surrounding a large space, which was
gradually narrowed till the game it inclosed was brought within reach."Bearing before them, in their course,
    The relics of the archer force,
    Like wave with crest of sparkling foam,
    Right onward did Clan-Alpine come.Above the tide, each broadsword bright
      Was brandishing like beam of light,
        Each targe was dark below;
      And with the ocean's mighty swing,
      When heaving to the tempest's wing,
        They hurl'd them on the foe.I heard the lance's shivering crash,
    As when the whirlwind rends the ash;
    I heard the broadsword's deadly clang,
    As if an hundred anvils rang!But Moray wheel'd his rearward rank
    Of horsemen on Clan-Alpine's flank,
        --'My banner man, advance!I see,' he cried, 'their column shake.--
      Now, gallants!for your ladies' sake,
        Upon them with the lance!'--
      The horsemen dash'd among the rout,
        As deer break through the broom;
      Their steeds are stout, their swords are out,
        They soon make lightsome room.Clan-Alpine's best are backward borne--
        Where, where was Roderick then?One blast upon his bugle horn
        Were worth a thousand men.And refluent[353] through the pass of fear
        The battle's tide was pour'd;
      Vanish'd the Saxon's struggling spear,
        Vanish'd the mountain sword.As Bracklinn's chasm, so black and steep,
        Receives her roaring linn,
      As the dark caverns of the deep
        Suck the dark whirlpool in,
    So did the deep and darksome pass
    Devour the battle's mingled mass:
    None linger now upon the plain,
    Save those who ne'er shall fight again.""Now westward rolls the battle's din,
    That deep and doubling pass within.the work of fate
    Is bearing on: its issue wait,
    Where the rude Trosachs' dread defile
    Opens on Katrine's lake and isle.Gray Benvenue I soon repass'd,
    Loch Katrine lay beneath me cast.The sun is set;--the clouds are met,
          The lowering scowl of heaven
      An inky hue of livid blue
          To the deep lake has given;
    Strange gusts of wind from mountain glen
    Swept o'er the lake, then sunk agen.I heeded not the eddying surge,
    Mine eye but saw the Trosachs' gorge,
    Mine ear but heard that sullen sound,
    Which like an earthquake shook the ground,
    And spoke the stern and desperate strife
    That parts not but with parting life,
    Seeming, to minstrel ear, to toll
    The dirge of many a passing soul.Nearer it comes--the dim-wood glen
      The martial flood disgorged agen,
          But not in mingled tide;
      The plaided warriors of the North
      High on the mountain thunder forth
          And overhang its side;
      While by the lake below appears
      The dark'ning cloud of Saxon spears.At weary bay each shatter'd band,
      Eying their foemen, sternly stand;
      Their banners stream like tatter'd sail,
      That flings its fragments to the gale,
      And broken arms and disarray
      Mark'd the fell havoc of the day.""Viewing the mountain's ridge askance,
    The Saxon stood in sullen trance,
    Till Moray pointed with his lance,
        And cried--'Behold yon isle!--
    See!none are left to guard its strand,
    But women weak, that wring the hand:
    'Tis there of yore the robber band
        Their booty wont to pile;--
    My purse, with bonnet pieces[354] store,
    To him will swim a bowshot o'er,
    And loose a shallop from the shore.Lightly we'll tame the war wolf then,
    Lords of his mate, and brood, and den.'--
    Forth from the ranks a spearman sprung,
    On earth his casque and corselet rung,
        He plunged him in the wave:--
    All saw the deed--the purpose knew,
    And to their clamors Benvenue
        A mingled echo gave;
    The Saxons shout, their mate to cheer,
    The helpless females scream for fear,
    And yells for rage the mountaineer.'Twas then, as by the outcry riven,
    Pour'd down at once the lowering heaven;
    A whirlwind swept Loch Katrine's breast,
    Her billows rear'd their snowy crest.Well for the swimmer swell'd they high,
    To mar the Highland marksman's eye;
    For round him shower'd,'mid rain and hail,
    The vengeful arrows of the Gael.--
    In vain--He nears the isle--and lo!His hand is on a shallop's bow.--Just then a flash of lightning came,
    It tinged the waves and strand with flame;--
    I mark'd Duncraggan's widow'd dame--
    Behind an oak I saw her stand,
    A naked dirk gleam'd in her hand:
    It darken'd,--but, amid the moan
    Of waves, I heard a dying groan;
    Another flash!--the spearman floats
    A weltering corse beside the boats,
    And the stern matron o'er him stood,
    Her hand and dagger streaming blood."[354] A bonnet piece is an elegant gold coin, bearing on one side the
head of James V. wearing a bonnet.the Saxons cried--
    The Gael's exulting shout replied.Despite the elemental rage,
    Again they hurried to engage;
    But, ere they closed in desperate fight,
    Bloody with spurring came a knight,
    Sprung from his horse, and, from a crag,
    Waved 'twixt the hosts a milk-white flag.Clarion and trumpet by his side
    Rung forth a truce note high and wide,
    While, in the Monarch's name, afar
    An herald's voice forbade the war,
    For Bothwell's lord, and Roderick bold,
    Were both, he said, in captive hold."--But here the lay made sudden stand,
    The harp escaped the Minstrel's hand!--
    Oft had he stolen a glance, to spy
    How Roderick brook'd his minstrelsy:
    At first, the Chieftain, to the chime,
    With lifted hand, kept feeble time;
    That motion ceased,--yet feeling strong
    Varied his look as changed the song;
    At length, no more his deafen'd ear
    The minstrel melody can hear;
    His face grows sharp,--his hands are clench'd,
    As if some pang his heartstrings wrench'd;
    Set are his teeth, his fading eye
    Is sternly fix'd on vacancy;
    Thus, motionless, and moanless, drew
    His parting breath, stout Roderick Dhu!--
    Old Allan-Bane look'd on aghast,
    While grim and still his spirit pass'd:
    But when he saw that life was fled,
    He pour'd his wailing o'er the dead."And art them cold and lowly laid,
    Thy foeman's dread, thy people's aid,
    Breadalbane's[355] boast, Clan-Alpine's shade!For thee shall none a requiem say?--
    For thee,--who loved the Minstrel's lay,
    For thee, of Bothwell's house the stay,
    The shelter of her exiled line?E'en in this prison house of thine,
    I'll wail for Alpine's honor'd Pine!"What groans shall yonder valleys fill!What shrieks of grief shall rend yon hill!What tears of burning rage shall thrill,
    When mourns thy tribe thy battles done,
    Thy fall before the race was won,
    Thy sword ungirt ere set of sun!There breathes not clansman of thy line,
    But would have given his life for thine.--
    Oh, woe for Alpine's honor'd Pine!"Sad was thy lot on mortal stage!--
    The captive thrush may brook the cage,
    The prison'd eagle dies for rage.And, when its notes awake again,
    Even she, so long beloved in vain,
    Shall with my harp her voice combine,
    And mix her woe and tears with mine,
    To wail Clan-Alpine's honor'd Pine."--

[355] The region bordering Loch Tay.Ellen, the while, with bursting heart,
    Remain'd in lordly bower apart,
    Where play'd, with many- gleams,
    Through storied[356] pane the rising beams.In vain on gilded roof they fall,
    And lighten'd up a tapestried wall,
    And for her use a menial train
    A rich collation spread in vain.The banquet proud, the chamber gay,
    Scarce drew one curious glance astray;
    Or if she look'd, 'twas but to say,
    With better omen dawn'd the day
    In that lone isle, where waved on high
    The dun deer's hide for canopy;
    Where oft her noble father shared
    The simple meal her care prepared,
    While Lufra, crouching by her side,
    Her station claim'd with jealous pride,
    And Douglas, bent on woodland game,
    Spoke of the chase to Malcolm Graeme,
    Whose answer, oft at random made,
    The wandering of his thoughts betray'd.--
    Those who such simple joys have known,
    Are taught to prize them when they're gone.But sudden, see, she lifts her head!What distant music has the power
    To win her in this woeful hour!'Twas from a turret that o'erhung
    Her latticed bower, the strain was sung.[356] Stained or painted to form pictures illustrating history.LAY OF THE IMPRISONED HUNTSMAN."My hawk is tired of perch and hood,
    My idle greyhound loathes his food,
    My horse is weary of his stall,
    And I am sick of captive thrall.I wish I were, as I have been,
    Hunting the hart in forest green,
    With bended bow and bloodhound free,
    For that's the life is meet for me."I hate to learn the ebb of time,
    From yon dull steeple's drowsy chime,
    Or mark it as the sunbeams crawl,
    Inch after inch, along the wall.The lark was wont my matins ring,
    The sable rook my vespers sing;
    These towers, although a king's they be,
    Have not a hall of joy for me."No more at dawning morn I rise,
    And sun myself in Ellen's eyes,
    Drive the fleet deer the forest through,
    And homeward wend with evening dew;
    A blithesome welcome blithely meet,
    And lay my trophies at her feet,
    While fled the eve on wing of glee,--
    That life is lost to love and me!"The heart-sick lay was hardly said,
    The list'ner had not turn'd her head,
    It trickled still, the starting tear,
    When light a footstep struck her ear,
    And Snowdoun's graceful Knight was near.She turn'd the hastier, lest again
    The prisoner should renew his strain."Oh, welcome, brave Fitz-James!"she said;
    "How may an almost orphan maid
    Pay the deep debt"--"Oh, say not so!the boon to give,
    And bid thy noble father live;
    I can but be thy guide, sweet maid,
    With Scotland's King thy suit to aid.No tyrant he, though ire and pride
    May lay his better mood aside.'tis more than time--
    He holds his court at morning prime."With beating heart, and bosom wrung,
    As to a brother's arm she clung.Gently he dried the falling tear,
    And gently whisper'd hope and cheer;
    Her faltering steps half led, half stayed,[357]
    Through gallery fair and high arcade,
    Till, at his touch, its wings of pride
    A portal arch unfolded wide.Within 'twas brilliant all and light,
    A thronging scene of figures bright;
    It glow'd on Ellen's dazzled sight,
    As when the setting sun has given
    Ten thousand hues to summer even,
    And from their tissue, fancy frames
    Aerial[358] knights and fairy dames.Still by Fitz-James her footing staid;
    A few faint steps she forward made,
    Then slow her drooping head she raised,
    And fearful round the presence[359] gazed;
    For him she sought, who own'd this state,
    The dreaded Prince, whose will was fate!--
    She gazed on many a princely port,
    Might well have ruled a royal court;
    On many a splendid garb she gazed,
    Then turn'd bewilder'd and amazed,
    For all stood bare; and, in the room,
    Fitz-James alone wore cap and plume.To him each lady's look was lent;
    On him each courtier's eye was bent;
    Midst furs, and silks, and jewels sheen,
    He stood, in simple Lincoln green,
    The center of the glittering ring,--
    And Snowdoun's Knight[360] is Scotland's King.[360] James V. was accustomed to make personal investigation of the
condition of his people.The name he generally assumed when in disguise
was "Laird of Ballingeich."As wreath of snow, on mountain breast,
    Slides from the rock that gave it rest,
    Poor Ellen glided from her stay,
    And at the Monarch's feet she lay;
    No word her choking voice commands,--
    She show'd the ring--she clasp'd her hands.not a moment could he brook,
    The generous Prince, that suppliant look!Gently he raised her; and, the while,
    Check'd with a glance the circle's smile;
    Graceful, but grave, her brow he kiss'd,
    And bade her terrors be dismiss'd:--
    "Yes, Fair; the wandering poor Fitz-James
    The fealty of Scotland claims.To him thy woes, thy wishes, bring;
    He will redeem his signet ring.Ask naught for Douglas; yestereven,
    His Prince and he have much forgiven:
    Wrong hath he had from slanderous tongue--
    I, from his rebel kinsmen, wrong.We would not, to the vulgar crowd,
    Yield what they craved with clamor loud;
    Calmly we heard and judged his cause,
    Our council aided, and our laws.I stanch'd thy father's death-feud stern
    With stout De Vaux and gray Glencairn;
    And Bothwell's Lord henceforth we own
    The friend and bulwark of our Throne.--
    But, lovely infidel, how now?Lord James of Douglas, lend thine aid;
    Thou must confirm this doubting maid."Then forth the noble Douglas sprung,
    And on his neck his daughter hung.The Monarch drank, that happy hour,
    The sweetest, holiest draught of Power,--
    When it can say, with godlike voice,
    Arise, sad Virtue, and rejoice!Yet would not James the general eye
    On Nature's raptures long should pry;
    He stepp'd between--"Nay, Douglas, nay,
    Steal not my proselyte away!The riddle 'tis my right to read,
    That brought this happy chance to speed.[361]
    Yes, Ellen, when disguised I stray
    In life's more low but happier way,
    'Tis under name which veils my power;
    Nor falsely veils--for Stirling's tower
    Of yore the name of Snowdoun claims,
    And Normans call me James Fitz-James.Thus watch I o'er insulted laws,
    Thus learn to right the injured cause."--
    Then, in a tone apart and low,--
    "Ah, little traitress!none must know
    What idle dream, what lighter thought,
    What vanity full dearly bought,
    Join'd to thine eye's dark witchcraft, drew
    My spellbound steps to Benvenue,
    In dangerous hour, and all but gave
    Thy Monarch's life to mountain glaive!"--
    Aloud he spoke,--"Thou still dost hold
    That little talisman of gold,
    Pledge of my faith, Fitz-James's ring--
    What seeks fair Ellen of the King?"Full well the conscious maiden guess'd
    He probed the weakness of her breast;
    But, with that consciousness, there came
    A lightening of her fears for Graeme,
    And more she deem'd the Monarch's ire
    Kindled 'gainst him, who, for her sire,
    Rebellious broadsword boldly drew;
    And, to her generous feeling true,
    She craved the grace of Roderick Dhu."Forbear thy suit:--the King of kings
    Alone can stay life's parting wings.I know his heart, I know his hand,
    Have shared his cheer, and proved his brand;--
    My fairest earldom would I give
    To bid Clan-Alpine's Chieftain live!--
    Hast thou no other boon to crave?Blushing, she turn'd her from the King,
    And to the Douglas gave the ring,
    As if she wish'd her sire to speak
    The suit that stain'd her glowing cheek.--
    "Nay, then, my pledge has lost its force,
    And stubborn Justice holds her course.--
    Malcolm, come forth!"--and, at the word,
    Down kneel'd the Graeme to Scotland's Lord."For thee, rash youth, no suppliant sues,
    From thee may Vengeance claim her dues,
    Who, nurtured underneath our smile,
    Hast paid our care by treacherous wile,
    And sought, amid thy faithful clan,
    A refuge for an outlaw'd man,
    Dishonoring thus thy loyal name.--
    Fetters and warder for the Graeme!"--
    His chain of gold the King unstrung,
    The links o'er Malcolm's neck he flung,
    Then gently drew the glittering band,
    And laid the clasp on Ellen's hand.The hills grow dark,
      On purple peaks a deeper shade descending;
    In twilight copse the glowworm lights her spark,
      The deer, half seen, are to the covert wending.the fountain lending,
      And the wild breeze, thy wilder minstrelsy;
    Thy numbers sweet with Nature's vespers blending,
      With distant echo from the fold and lea,
    And herd-boy's evening pipe, and hum of housing[362] bee.Yet, once again, farewell, thou Minstrel Harp!Yet, once again, forgive my feeble sway!And little reck I of the censure sharp
      May idly cavil at an idle lay.Much have I owed thy strains on life's long way,
      Through secret woes the world has never known,
    When on the weary night dawn'd wearier day,
      And bitterer was the grief devour'd alone.That I o'erlived such woes, Enchantress!as my lingering footsteps slow retire,
      Some Spirit of the Air has waked thy string!'Tis now a seraph bold, with touch of fire--
      'Tis now the brush of Fairy's frolic wing.Receding now, the dying numbers ring
      Fainter and fainter down the rugged dell,
    And now the mountain breezes scarcely bring
      A wandering witch note of the distant spell--
    And now, 'tis silent all!--Enchantress, fare thee well!A series of arches supported by columns or piers, either open
or backed by masonry.A kind of cap or head gear formerly worn by soldiers.A wall or rampart around the top of a castle, with openings
to look through and annoy the enemy.A capacious drinking cup or can formerly made of waxed
leather.A person knighted on some other ground than that of
military service; a knight who has not known the hardships of war.To grapple; to come to close quarters in fight.A kind of cap worn by Scottish matrons.The plume or decoration on the top of a helmet.The ridge of the neck of a horse or dog.A bridge at the entrance of a castle, which, when lowered
by chains, gave access across the moat or ditch surrounding the
structure.Something which was bestowed as a token of good will or of
love, as a glove or a knot of ribbon, to be worn habitually by a
knight-errant.A seeming aim at one part when it is
intended to strike another.Pertaining to that political form in which there was a chain of
persons holding land of one another on condition of performing certain
services.Every man in the chain was bound to his immediate superior,
held land from him, took oath of allegiance to him, and became his man.A trumpet call; a fanfare or prelude by one or more trumpets
performed on the approach of any person of distinction.The front of a stag's head; the horns.A long-handled weapon armed with a steel point, and having a
crosspiece of steel with a cutting edge.An upper garment of leather, worn for defense by common soldiers.It was sometimes strengthened by small pieces of metal stitched into it."To give law" to a stag is to allow it a start of a certain
distance or time before the hounds are slipped, the object being to
insure a long chase.A cage for hawks while mewing or moulting: hence an inclosure, a
place of confinement.In the Roman Catholic Church the first canonical hour of prayer,
six o'clock in the morning, generally the first quarter of the day.A stout staff used as a weapon of defense.In using it,
one hand was placed in the middle, and the other halfway between the
middle and the end.A ring containing a signet or private seal.To let slip; to loose hands from the noose; to be sent in pursuit
of game.A cup of wine drunk on parting from a friend on horseback.A valley of considerable size, through which a river flows.An officer of the forest, who had the nocturnal care of vert
and venison.A song the parts of which are sung in succession; a round.To sing in the manner of a catch or round, also in a full, jovial voice.The skin of the squirrel, much used in the fourteenth century as
fur for garments.A guarding or defensive position or motion in fencing._The Lady of the Lake_ is usually read in the first year of the high
school course, and it is with this fact in mind that the following
suggestions have been made.It is an excellent book with which to begin
the study of the ordinary forms of poetry, of plot structure, and the
simpler problems of description.For this reason in the exercises that
follow the emphasis has been placed on these topics._The Lady of the Lake_ is an excellent example of the minor epic.Corresponding to the "Arms and the man I sing," of the AEneid, and the
invocation to the Muse, are the statement of the theme, "Knighthood's
dauntless deed and Beauty's matchless eye," and the invocation to the
Harp of the North, in the opening stanzas.For the heroes, descendants
of the gods, of the great epic, we have a king, the chieftain of a
great clan, an outlaw earl and his daughter, characters less elevated
than those of the great epic, but still important.The element of the
supernatural brought in by the gods and goddesses of the epic is here
supplied by the minstrel, Brian the priest, and the harp.The interest
of the poem lies in the incidents as with the epic.The romantic story
of Ellen and Malcolm, however, lies quite outside the realm of the
great epic, which is concerned with the fate of a state or body of
people rather than with that of an individual.There are two threads to the story, one concerned with the love story
of Ellen and Malcolm, the main plot; and one with Roderick and his clan
against the King, the minor plot.The connection between them is very
slight, the story of Ellen could have been told almost without the
other, but the struggle of the Clan makes a fine background for the
love story of Ellen and Malcolm.The plot is an excellent one for the
beginner to study as the structure is so evident.The following is a
simple outline of the main incidents of the story.The coming of the stranger, later supposed by Roderick to
      be a spy of the King.The return of Douglas, guided by Malcolm, an act which
      brings Malcolm under the displeasure of the King.Roderick's proposal for Ellen's hand in order to avert the
      danger threatening Ellen and Douglas because of the recognition
      of the latter by the King's men.The rejection of the proposal, leading to the withdrawal of
      Ellen and her father to Coir-Uriskin and the departure of
      Douglas to the court to save Roderick and Malcolm.The preparations for war made by Roderick, including the
      sending of the Fiery Cross, and the Taghairm.Ellen and Allan-Bane at Coir-Uriskin.Douglas on his way to give himself up.The triumph of Fitz-James over Roderick.The interest reawakened in the King by Douglas's prowess
      and generosity.The battle of Beal 'an Duine.All of Scott's works afford excellent models of description for the
beginner in this very difficult form of composition.He deals with
the problems of description in a simple and evident manner.In most
cases he begins his description with the point of view, and chooses
the details in accordance with that point of view.The principle of
order used in the arrangement of the details is usually easy to find
and follow, and the beauty of his contrasts, the vanity and vividness
of his diction can be in a measure appreciated even by boys and girls
in the first year of the high school.If properly taught a pupil must
leave the study of the poem with a new sense of the power of words.In his description of character Scott deals with the most simple and
elemental emotions and is therefore fairly easy to imitate.In the
special topics under each canto special emphasis has been laid upon
description because of the adaptability of _his_ description to the needs
of the student.SPECIAL STUDIES IN THE CANTOS.CANTO I.

TEACHERS' OUTLINES FOR STUDIES IN ENGLISH

Based on the Requirements for Admission to College

By GILBERT SYKES BLAKELY, A.M., Instructor in English in the Morris
High School, New York City.This little book is intended to present to teachers plans for the study
of the English texts required for admission to college.These Outlines
are full of inspiration and suggestion, and will be welcomed by every
live teacher who hitherto, in order to avoid ruts, has been obliged to
compare notes with other teachers, visit classes, and note methods.The volume aims not at a discussion of the principles of teaching, but
at an application of certain principles to the teaching of some of the
books most generally read in schools.¶ The references by page and line to the book under discussion are to
the texts of the Gateway Series; but the Outlines can be used with any
series of English classics.¶ Certain brief plans of study are developed for the general teaching
of the novel, narrative poetry, lyric poetry, the drama, and the
essay.The suggestions are those of a practical teacher, and follow a
definite scheme in each work to be studied.There are discussions of
methods, topics for compositions, and questions for review.The lists
of questions are by no means exhaustive, but those that are given are
suggestive and typical.¶ The appendix contains twenty examinations in English, for admission
to college, recently set by different colleges in both the East and the
West.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

HALLECK'S NEW ENGLISH LITERATURE

By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M. A., LL.D. author of History of English
Literature, and History of American Literature.This New English Literature preserves the qualities which have caused
the author's former History of English Literature to be so widely used;
namely, suggestiveness, clearness, organic unity, interest, and power
to awaken thought and to stimulate the student to further reading.¶ Here are presented the new facts which have recently been brought
to light, and the new points of view which have been adopted.More
attention is paid to recent writers.The present critical point of
view concerning authors, which has been brought about by the new
social spirit, is reflected.Many new and important facts concerning
the Elizabethan theater and the drama of Shakespeare's time are
incorporated.¶ Other special features are the unusually detailed Suggested Readings
that follow each chapter, suggestions and references for a literary
trip to England, historical introductions to the chapters, careful
treatment of the modern drama, and a new and up-to-date bibliography.¶ Over 200 pictures selected for their pedagogical value and their
unusual character appear in their appropriate places in connection with
the text.The frontispiece, in colors, shows the performance of an
Elizabethan play in the Fortune Theater.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE

By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M.A., Principal, Male High School, Louisville,
Ky.A companion volume to the author's History of English Literature.It describes the greatest achievements in American literature from
colonial times to the present, placing emphasis not only upon men,
but also upon literary movements, the causes of which are thoroughly
investigated.Further, the relation of each period of American
literature to the corresponding epoch of English literature has been
carefully brought out--and each period is illuminated by a brief survey
of its history.¶ The seven chapters of the book treat in succession of Colonial
Literature, The Emergence of a Nation (1754-1809), the New York Group,
The New England Group, Southern Literature, Western Literature, and
the Eastern Realists.To these are added a supplementary list of less
important authors and their chief works, as well as A Glance Backward,
which emphasizes in brief compass the most important truths taught by
American literature.¶ At the end of each chapter is a summary which helps to fix the
period in mind by briefly reviewing the most significant achievements.This is followed by extensive historical and literary references for
further study, by a very helpful list of suggested readings, and by
questions and suggestions, designed to stimulate the student's interest
and enthusiasm, and to lead him to study and investigate further for
himself the remarkable literary record of American aspiration and
accomplishment.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

Transcriber's Notes:

     Underscores "_" before and after a word or phrase indicate italics
       in the original text.The word "onomatopoeia" uses an "oe" ligature in the original.A few words use diacritical characters in the original."They had to take help from the town."The child made a brave struggle with her tears, and David looked away
quickly.He knew something of the temper of the steel of the New
England nature; the fierce and terrible pride that is bred in the bone
of the race.He knew that the child before him had tasted of the
bitter waters of humiliation in seeing her kindred "helped" by the
town."Going out to work," he understood, had brought the family pride
low, but taking help from the town had leveled it to the dust."There is, you know, a small salary that goes with this being adopted
business," he remarked casually a few seconds later."Your Aunts
Gertrude and Beulah and Margaret, and your three stalwart uncles
aforesaid, are not the kind of people who have been brought up to
expect something for nothing.They don't expect to adopt a perfectly
good orphan without money and without price, merely for the privilege
of experimentation.No, indeed, an orphan in good standing of the best
New England extraction ought to exact for her services a salary of at
least fifteen dollars a month.I wouldn't consent to take a cent less,
Eleanor."She sat suddenly erect,
as if an actual burden had been dropped from her shoulders.Her eyes
were not violet, David decided, he had been deceived by the depth of
their coloring; they were blue, Mediterranean blue, and her lashes
were an inch and a half long at the very least.She was not only
pretty, she was going to be beautiful some day.A strange premonition
struck David of a future in which this long-lashed, stoic baby was in
some way inextricably bound.They had been making their way through the Park; the searer, yellower
Park of late November.It looked duller and more cheerless than David
ever remembered it.The leaves rattled on the trees, and the sun went
down suddenly."In the spring it's very beautiful
here, and all the people you know go motoring or driving in the
afternoon."He bowed to his mother's milliner in a little French runabout.The
Frenchman stared frankly at the baby blue tam-o'-shanter and the
tangled golden head it surmounted."Joseph could make you a peachy tam-o'-shanter looking thing of blue
velvet; I'll bet I could draw him a picture to copy.Your Uncle David,
you know, is an artist of a sort."For the first time since their incongruous association began the child
met his smile; her face relaxed ever so little, and the lips quivered,
but she smiled a shy, little dawning smile.David put out his hand to pat hers, but thought better of
it."Eleanor," he said, "my mother knows our only living Ex-president, and
the Countess of Warwick, one Vanderbilt, two Astors, and she's met Sir
Gilbert Parker, and Rudyard Kipling.She also knows many of the stars
and satellites of upper Fifth Avenue.She has, as well, family
connections of so much weight and stolidity that their very approach,
singly or in conjunction, shakes the earth underneath them.--I wish we
could meet them all, Eleanor, every blessed one of them."CHAPTER II

THE COOPERATIVE PARENTS


"I wonder how a place like this apartment will look to her," Beulah
said thoughtfully."I wonder if it will seem elegant, or cramped to
death.I wonder if she will take to it kindly, or with an ill
concealed contempt for its limitations.""The poor little thing will probably be so frightened and homesick by
the time David gets her here, that she won't know what kind of a place
she's arrived at," Gertrude suggested."Oh, I wouldn't be in your
shoes for the next few days for anything in the world, Beulah Page;
would you, Margaret?""I don't know," she said thoughtfully."It would be rather fun to
begin it.""I'd rather have her for the first two months, and get it over with,"
Beulah said decisively."It'll be hanging over your head long after my
ordeal is over, and by the time I have to have her again she'll be
absolutely in training.You don't come until the fifth on the list you
know, Gertrude.Jimmie has her after me, then Margaret, then Peter,
and you, and David, if he has got up the courage to tell his mother
by that time.""But if he hasn't," Gertrude suggested.He's got to take the child two months
like the rest of us."He will," Margaret said, "I've never known him to go back on his word
yet."Anyway, I've taken the
precaution to put it in writing, as you know, and the document is
filed.""No, Gertrude, we can't,--yet, but morally we are.She isn't an
infant, she's ten years old.I wish you girls would take the matter a
little more seriously.We've bound ourselves to be responsible for
this child's whole future.We have undertaken her moral, social and
religious education.Her body and soul are to be--"

"Equally divided among us," Gertrude cut in.Beulah scorned the interruption.

"--held sacredly in trust by the six of us, severally and
collectively.""Why haven't we adopted her legally then?""Well, you see, there are practical objections.You have to be a
corporation or an institution or something, to adopt a child as a
group.A child can't have three sets of parents in the eyes of the
law, especially when none of them is married, or have the least
intention of being married, to each other.--I don't see what you want
to keep laughing at, Gertrude.It's all a little unusual and modern
and that sort of thing, but I don't think it's funny."I think that it's funny, but I think that it's serious, too,
Beulah.""I don't see what's funny about--" Beulah began hotly."You don't see what's funny about anything,--even Rogers College, do
you, darling?It is funny though for the bunch of us to undertake the
upbringing of a child ten years old; to make ourselves financially and
spiritually responsible for it.It's a lot more than funny, I know,
but it doesn't seem to me as if I could go on with it at all, until
somebody was willing to admit what a _scream_ the whole thing is.""We'll admit that, if that's all you want, won't we, Beulah?""If I've got this insatiable sense of humor, let's indulge it by all
means," Gertrude laughed."Go on, chillun, go on, I'll try to be good
now.""Confine yourself to a syncopated
chortle while I get a few facts out of Beulah.I did most of my voting
on this proposition by proxy, while I was having the measles in
quarantine.Beulah, did I understand you to say you got hold of your
victim through Mrs."Yes, when we decided we'd do this, we thought we'd get a child about
six.We couldn't have her any younger, because there would be bottles,
and expert feeding, and well, you know, all those things.We couldn't
have done it, especially the boys.We thought six would be just about
the right age, but we simply couldn't find a child that would do.We
had to know about its antecedents.We looked through the orphan
asylums, but there wasn't anything pure-blooded American that we could
be sure of.We were all agreed that we wanted pure American blood.O'Farrel had relatives on Cape Cod.You know what that stock
is, a good sea-faring strain, and a race of wonderfully fine women,
'atavistic aristocrats' I remember an author in the _Atlantic Monthly_
called them once.I suppose you think it's funny to groan, Gertrude,
when anybody makes a literary allusion, but it isn't.O'Farrel knew about this child, and sent for her.O'Farrel over Sunday, and now David is bringing her here."It will be a good experience for
him, besides David is so amusing when he tries to be, I thought he
could divert her on the way.""It isn't such a crazy idea, after all, Gertrude."Margaret Hutchinson
was the youngest of the three, being within several months of her
majority, but she looked older.Her face had that look of wisdom that
comes to the young who have suffered physical pain.We're all too full of energy and spirits, at least the rest
of you are, and I'm getting huskier every minute, to twirl our hands
and do nothing.None of us ever wants to be married,--that's settled;
but we do want to be useful.We're a united group of the closest kind
of friends, bound by the ties of--of--natural selection, and we need a
purpose in life.Gertrude's a real artist, but the rest of us are not,
and--and--"

"What could be more natural for us than to want the living clay to
work on?"I can be serious
if I want to, Beulah-land, but, honestly, girls, when I come to face
out the proposition, I'm almost afraid to.What'll I do with that
child when it comes to be my turn?Buy her a string
of pearls, and show her the night life of New York very likely.How'll
I break it to my mother?That's the cheerful little echo in my
thoughts night and day.How did you break it to yours, Beulah?"Her serious brown eyes, deep brown with wine-
lights in them, met those of each of her friends in turn."Well, I do know this is funny," she said, "but, you know, I haven't
dared tell her.She'll be away for a month, anyway.Aunt Ann is here,
but I'm only telling her that I'm having a little girl from the
country to visit me."Occasionally the architect of an apartment on the upper west side of
New York--by pure accident, it would seem, since the general run of
such apartments is so uncomfortable, and unfriendly--hits upon a plan
for a group of rooms that are at once graciously proportioned and
charmingly convenient, while not being an absolute offense to the eye
in respect to the details of their decoration.Beulah Page and her
mother lived in such an apartment, and they had managed with a few
ancestral household gods, and a good many carefully related modern
additions to them, to make of their eight rooms and bath, to say
nothing of the ubiquitous butler's-pantry, something very remarkably
resembling a home, in its most delightful connotation: and it was in
the drawing room of this home that the three girls were gathered.Beulah, the younger daughter of a widowed mother--now visiting in the
home of the elder daughter, Beulah's sister Agatha, in the expectation
of what the Victorians refer to as an "interesting event"--was
technically under the chaperonage of her Aunt Ann, a solemn little
spinster with no control whatever over the movements of her determined
young niece.Beulah was just out of college,--just out, in fact, of the most
high-minded of all the colleges for women;--that founded by Andrew
Rogers in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and sixty-one.There
is probably a greater percentage of purposeful young women graduated
from Rogers College every year, than from any other one of the
communities of learning devoted to the education of women; and of all
the purposeful classes turned out from that admirable institution,
Beulah's class could without exaggeration be designated as the most
purposeful class of them all.That Beulah was not the most purposeful
member of her class merely argues that an almost abnormally high
standard of purposefulness was maintained by practically every
individual in it.At Rogers every graduating class has its fad; its propaganda for a
crusade against the most startling evils of the world.One year, the
sacred outlines of the human figure are protected against
disfigurement by an ardent group of young classicists in Grecian
draperies.The next, a fierce young brood of vegetarians challenge a
lethargic world to mortal combat over an Argentine sirloin.The year
of Beulah's graduation, the new theories of child culture that were
gaining serious headway in academic circles, had filtered into the
class rooms, and Beulah's mates had contracted the contagion
instantly.The entire senior class went mad on the subject of child
psychology and the various scientific prescriptions for the direction
of the young idea.It was therefore primarily to Beulah Page, that little Eleanor Hamlin,
of Colhassett, Massachusetts, owed the change in her fortune.At least
it was to Beulah that she owed the initial inspiration that set the
wheel of that fortune in motion; but it was to the glorious enterprise
and idealism of youth, and the courage of a set of the most intrepid
and quixotic convictions that ever quickened in the breasts of a mad
half dozen youngsters, that she owed the actual fulfillment of her
adventure.The sound of the door-bell brought the three girls to their feet, but
the footfalls in the corridor, double quick time, and accentuated,
announced merely the arrival of Jimmie Sears, and Peter Stuyvesant,
nicknamed _Gramercy_ by common consent.But Jimmie struck an attitude in the middle of the floor.For the love of Mike, children, where is she?"Sandra moved to the bathroom."She's coming," Beulah answered; "David's bringing her."Gertrude pushed him into the _chaise-lounge_ already in the
possession of Margaret, and squeezed in between them."Hold my hand, Jimmie," she said."The feelings of a father are
nothing,--_nothing_ in comparison to those which smolder in the
maternal breast.Look at Beulah, how white she is, and Margaret is
trembling this minute.""I'm trembling, too," Peter said, "or if I'm not trembling, I'm
frightened.""We're all frightened," Margaret said, "but we're game.""There they come," Beulah said, "oh!The familiar figure of their good friend David appeared on the
threshold at this instant, and beside him an odd-looking little figure
in a shoddy cloth coat, and a faded blue tam-o'-shanter.There was a
long smudge of dirt reaching from the corner of her eye well down into
the middle of her cheek.A kind of composite gasp went up from the
waiting group, a gasp of surprise, consternation, and panic.Not one
of the five could have told at that instant what it was he expected to
see, or how his imagination of the child differed from the concrete
reality, but amazement and keen disappointment constrained them.Here
was no figure of romance and delight.No miniature Galatea half hewn
out of the block of humanity, waiting for the chisel of a composite
Pygmalion.Here was only a grubby, little unkempt child, like all
other children, but not so presentable."I want to present you to our ward, Miss Eleanor Hamlin,
who has come a long way for the pleasure of meeting you.Eleanor,
these are your cooperative parents."The child's set gaze followed his gesture obediently.David took the
little hand in his, and led the owner into the heart of the group."This is your Aunt Beulah, Eleanor, of whom I've been telling you.""I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, Aunt Beulah," the little girl
said, as Beulah put out her hand, still uncertainly.The immaculate, inscrutable
David--the aristocrat of aristocrats, the one undemonstrative,
super-self-conscious member of the crowd, who had been delegated to
transport the little orphan chiefly because the errand was so
incongruous a mission on which to despatch him--David put his arm
around the neck of the child with a quick protecting gesture, and then
gathered her close in his arms, where she clung, quivering and
sobbing, the unkempt curls straggling helplessly over his shoulder.He strode across the room where Margaret was still sitting upright in
the _chaise-lounge_, her dove-gray eyes wide, her lips parted."Here, you take her," he said, without ceremony, and slipped his
burden into her arms."Welcome to our city, Kiddo," Jimmie said in his throat, but nobody
heard him.Peter, whose habit it was to walk up and down endlessly wherever he
felt most at home, paused in his peregrination, as Margaret shyly
gathered the rough little head to her bosom.The child met his gaze as
he did so."We weren't quite up to scratch," he said gravely."Peter," she said, "Peter, I didn't mean to
be--not to be--"

But Peter seemed not to know she was speaking.The child's eyes still
held him, and he stood gazing down at her, his handsome head thrown
slightly back; his face deeply intent; his eyes softened."I'm your Uncle Peter, Eleanor," he said, and bent down till his lips
touched her forehead.CHAPTER III

THE EXPERIMENT BEGINS


Eleanor walked over to the steam pipes, and examined them carefully.The terrible rattling noise had stopped, as had also the choking and
gurgling that had kept her awake because it was so like the noise that
Mrs.O'Farrel's aunt, the sick lady she had helped to take care of,
made constantly for the last two weeks of her life.Whenever there was
a sound that was anything like that, Eleanor could not help shivering.When Beulah had shown her the
room where she was to sleep--a room all in blue, baby blue, and pink
roses--Eleanor thought that the silver pipes standing upright in the
corner were a part of some musical instrument, like a pipe organ.When
the rattling sound had begun she thought that some one had come into
the room with her, and was tuning it.She had drawn the pink silk puff
closely about her ears, and tried not to be frightened.Trying not to
be frightened was the way she had spent a good deal of her time since
her Uncle Amos died, and she had had to look out for her
grandparents.Now that it was morning, and the bright sun was streaming into the
windows, she ventured to climb out of bed and approach the uncanny
instrument.She tripped on the trailing folds of that nightgown her
Aunt Beulah--it was funny that all these ladies should call themselves
her aunts, when they were really no relation to her--had insisted on
her wearing.Her own nightdress had been left in the time-worn
carpetbag that Uncle David had forgotten to take out of the "handsome
cab."They were _hot_; so hot
that the flesh of her arm nearly blistered, but she did not cry out.Here was another mysterious problem of the kind that New York
presented at every turn, to be silently accepted, and dealt with.Her mother and father had once lived in New York.Her father had been
born here, in a house with a brownstone front on West Tenth Street,
wherever that was.She herself had lived in New York when she was a
baby, though she had been born in her grandfather's house in
Colhassett.She had lived in Cincinnati, Ohio, too, until she was four
years old, and her father and mother had died there, both in the same
week, of pneumonia.She wished this morning, that she could remember
the house where they lived in New York, and the things that were in
it.Ought she to go and open the door in
her nightdress?Ought she to call out "Come in?"It might be a
gentleman, and her Aunt Beulah's nightdress was not very thick.She
decided to cough, so that whoever was outside might understand she was
in there, and had heard them.She started to get into bed, but Miss--Miss--the nearer
she was to her, the harder it was to call her aunt,--Aunt Beulah might
think it was time she was up.She compromised by sitting down in a
chair.Beulah had passed a practically sleepless night working out the theory
of Eleanor's development.The six had agreed on a certain sketchily
defined method of procedure.That is, they were to read certain books
indicated by Beulah, and to follow the general schedule that she was
to work out and adapt to the individual needs of the child herself,
during the first phase of the experiment.She felt that she had
managed the reception badly, that she had not done or said the right
thing.Peter's attitude had shown that he felt the situation had been
clumsily handled, and it was she who was responsible for it.Peter was
too kind to criticize her, but she had vowed in the muffled depths of
a feverish pillow that there should be no more flagrant flaws in the
conduct of the campaign."I didn't know I was to have one.""Nice little girls have a bath every day."Her Aunt Beulah seemed to expect her to say
something more, but she couldn't think of anything."I'll draw your bath for you this morning.After this you will be
expected to take it yourself."Eleanor had seen bathrooms before, but she had never been in a
bath-tub.At her grandfather's, she had taken her Saturday night baths
in an old wooden wash-tub, which had water poured in it from the tea
kettle.When Beulah closed the door on her she stepped gingerly into
the tub: the water was twice too hot, but she didn't know how to turn
the faucet, or whether she was expected to turn it.O'Farrel had
told her that people had to pay for water in New York.Perhaps Aunt
Beulah had drawn all the water she could have.She wished there was some way
of discovering just how much of things she was expected to use.The
number of towels distressed her, but she finally took the littlest and
dried herself.The heat of the water had nearly parboiled her.After that, she tried to do blindly what she was told.There was a
girl in a black dress and white apron that passed her everything she
had to eat.Her Aunt Beulah told her to help herself to sugar and to
cream for her oatmeal, from off this girl's tray.Her hand trembled a
good deal, but she was fortunate enough not to spill any.After
breakfast she was sent to wash her hands in the bathroom; she turned
the faucet, and used a very little water.Then, when she was called,
she went into the sitting-room and sat down, and folded her hands in
her lap.Beulah looked at her with some perplexity.The child was docile and
willing, but she seemed unexpectedly stupid for a girl ten years old."Have you ever been examined for adenoids, Eleanor?""Say, 'no, Aunt Beulah.'Don't say, 'no, ma'am' and 'yes, ma'am.'People don't say 'no, ma'am' and 'yes, ma'am' any more, you know.They
say 'no' and 'yes,' and then mention the name of the person to whom
they are speaking.""Yes, ma'am," Eleanor couldn't stop herself saying it."No, Aunt Beulah, no, Aunt Beulah," but the words
stuck in her throat."Well, try to remember," Beulah said.She was thinking of the case in
a book of psychology that she had been reading that morning, of a girl
who was "pale and sleepy looking, expressionless of face, careless of
her personal appearance," who after an operation for adenoids, had
become "as animated and bright as before she had been lethargic and
dull."She was pleased to see that Eleanor's fine hair had been
scrupulously combed, and neatly braided this morning, not being able
to realize--as how should she?--that the condition of Eleanor's fine
spun locks on her arrival the night before, had been attributable to
the fact that the O'Farrel baby had stolen her comb, and Eleanor had
been too shy to mention the fact, and had combed her hair
mermaid-wise, through her fingers."This morning," Beulah began brightly, "I am going to turn you loose
in the apartment, and let you do what you like.I want to get an idea
of the things you do like, you know.You can sew, or read, or drum on
the piano, or talk to me, anything that pleases you most.I want you
to be happy, that's all, and to enjoy yourself in your own way.""Give the child absolute freedom in which to demonstrate the worth and
value of its ego,"--that was what she was doing, "keeping it carefully
under observation while you determine the individual trend along which
to guide its development."The walls were white, and so was the woodwork, the mantle,
and some of the furniture.Gay figured curtains hung at the windows,
and there were little stools, and chairs, and even trays with glass
over them, covered with the same bright  material.Eleanor had
never seen a room anything like it.There was no center-table, no
crayon portraits of different members of the family, no easels, or
scarves thrown over the corners of the pictures.There were not many
pictures, and those that there were didn't seem to Eleanor like
pictures at all, they were all so blurry and smudgy,--excepting one of
a beautiful lady.She would have liked to have asked the name of that
lady,--but her Aunt Beulah's eyes were upon her.She slipped down from
her chair and walked across the room to the window."Well, dear, what would make this the happiest day you can think of?"Beulah asked, in the tone she was given to use when she asked Gertrude
and Margaret and Jimmie--but not often Peter--what they expected to do
with their lives.Eleanor turned a desperate face from the window, from the row of bland
elegant apartment buildings she had been contemplating with unseeing
eyes."Have to amuse myself in my own way?I don't know what you want me to
do.I don't know what you think that I ought to do."A strong-minded and spoiled younger daughter of a widowed
mother--whose chief anxiety had been to anticipate the wants of her
children before they were expressed--with an independent income, and a
beloved and admiring circle of intimate friends, is not likely to be
imaginatively equipped to explore the spiritual fastnesses of a
sensitive and alien orphan.Beulah tried earnestly to get some
perspective on the child's point of view, but she could not.The fact
that she was torturing the child would have been outside of the limits
of her comprehension.She searched her mind for some immediate
application of the methods of Madame Montessori, and produced a lump
of modeling clay."You don't really have to do anything, Eleanor," she said kindly."I
don't want you to make an effort to please me, only to be happy
yourself.Why don't you try and see what you can do with this modeling
clay?Just try making it up into mud pies, or anything.""Let the child teach himself the significance of contour, and the use
of his hands, by fashioning the clay into rudimentary forms of
beauty.""Yes, dear, mud pies, if you wish to."Whereupon Eleanor, conscientiously and miserably, turned out a neat
half-dozen skilful, miniature models of the New England deep dish
apple-pie, pricked and pinched to a nicety.Beulah, with a vision related to the nebulous stages of a study by
Rodin, was somewhat disconcerted with this result, but she brightened
as she thought at least she had discovered a natural tendency in the
child that she could help her develop.In the child's mind there rose the picture of her grim apprenticeship
on Cape Cod.She could see the querulous invalid in the sick chair,
her face distorted with pain and impatience; she could feel the sticky
dough in her fingers, and the heat from the stove rising round her."I hate cooking," she said, with the first hint of passion she had
shown in her relation to her new friends.Beulah took her to walk on the Drive, but
as far as she was able to determine the child saw nothing of her
surroundings.The crowds of trimly dressed people, the nursemaids and
babies, the swift slim outlines of the whizzing motors, even the
battleships lying so suggestively quiescent on the river before
them--all the spectacular, vivid panorama of afternoon on Riverside
Drive--seemed absolutely without interest or savor to the child.Beulah's despair and chagrin were increasing almost as rapidly as
Eleanor's.Late in the afternoon Beulah suggested a nap."I'll sit here and read
for a few minutes," she said, as she tucked Eleanor under the covers.Then, since she was quite desperate for subjects of conversation, and
still determined by the hot memory of her night's vigil to leave no
stone of geniality unturned, she added:

"This is a book that I am reading to help me to know how to guide and
educate you.I haven't had much experience in adopting children, you
know, Eleanor, and when there is anything in this world that you don't
know, there is usually some good and useful book that will help you to
find out all about it."Even to herself her words sounded hatefully patronizing and pedagogic,
but she was past the point of believing that she could handle the
situation with grace.When Eleanor's breath seemed to be coming
regularly, she put down her book with some thankfulness and escaped to
the tea table, where she poured tea for her aunt, and explained the
child's idiosyncrasies swiftly and smoothly to that estimable lady.Left alone, Eleanor lay still for a while, staring at the design of
pink roses on the blue wall-paper.On Cape Cod, pink and blue were not
considered to be colors that could be combined.There was nothing at
all in New York like anything she knew or remembered.Then
she made her way to the window and picked up the book Beulah had been
reading.It was about _her_, Aunt Beulah had said,--directions for
educating her and training her.The paragraph that caught her eye
where the book was open had been marked with a pencil."This girl had such a fat, frog like expression of face," Eleanor
read, "that her neighbors thought her an idiot.She was found to be
the victim of a severe case of ad-e-noids."As she spelled out the
word, she recognized it as the one Beulah had used earlier in the day.She remembered the sudden sharp look with which the question had been
accompanied.The sick lady for whom she had "worked out" had often
called her an idiot when her feet had stumbled, or she had failed to
understand at once what was required of her.She encountered a text replete with hideous examples
of backward and deficient children, victims of adenoids who had been
restored to a state of normality by the removal of the affliction.She
had no idea what an adenoid was.She had a hazy notion that it was a
kind of superfluous bone in the region of the breast, but her anguish
was rooted in the fact that this, _this_ was the good and useful book
that her Aunt Beulah had found it necessary to resort to for guidance,
in the case of her own--Eleanor's--education.When Beulah, refreshed by a cup of tea and further sustained by the
fact that Margaret and Peter had both telephoned they were coming to
dinner, returned to her charge, she found the stolid, apathetic child
she had left, sprawling face downward on the floor, in a passion of
convulsive weeping.CHAPTER IV

PETER ELUCIDATES


It was Peter who got at the heart of the trouble.Margaret tried, but
though Eleanor clung to her and relaxed under the balm of her gentle
caresses, the child remained entirely inarticulate until Peter
gathered her up in his arms, and signed to the others that he wished
to be left alone with her.By the time he rejoined the two in the drawing-room--he had missed his
after-dinner coffee in the long half-hour that he had spent shut into
the guest room with the child--Jimmie and Gertrude had arrived, and
the four sat grouped together to await his pronouncement.She wants the doll that David left in
that carpetbag of hers he forgot to take out of the 'Handsome cab.'She wants to be loved, and she wants to grow up and write poetry for
the newspapers," he announced."Also she will eat a piece of bread and
butter and a glass of milk, as soon as it can conveniently be provided
for her.""When did you take holy orders, Gram?""How do you
work the confessional?I wish I could make anybody give anything up to
me, but I can't.Did you just go into that darkened chamber and say to
the kid, 'Child of my adoption,--cough,' and she coughed, or are you
the master of some subtler system of choking the truth out of 'em?""Anybody would tell anything to Peter if he happened to want to know
it," Margaret said seriously."Wouldn't they, Beulah?""She wants to be loved," Peter had said.It was so
simple for some people to open their hearts and give out
love,--easily, lightly.She was not made like that,--loving came hard
with her, but when once she had given herself, it was done.Peter
didn't know how hard she had tried to do right with the child that
day."The doll is called the rabbit doll, though there is no reason why it
should be, as it only looks the least tiny bit like a rabbit, and is a
girl.Its other name is Gwendolyn, and it always goes to bed with her.O'Farrels aunt said that children always stopped playing with
dolls when they got to be as big as Eleanor, but she isn't never
going to stop.--You must get after that double negative, Beulah.--She
once wrote a poem beginning: 'The rabbit doll, it is my own.'She
thinks that she has a frog-like expression of face, and that is why
Beulah doesn't like her better.She is perfectly willing to have her
adenoids cut out, if Beulah thinks it would improve her, but she
doesn't want to 'take anything,' when she has it done.""You are a wonder, Gram," Gertrude said admiringly.I have made a mess of it, haven't I?""Yes, she's homesick," Peter said gravely, "but not for anything she's
left in Colhassett.David told you the story, didn't he?--She is
homesick for her own kind, for people she can really love, and she's
never found any of them.Her grandfather and grandmother are old and
decrepit.She feels a terrible responsibility for them, but she
doesn't love them, not really.She's too hungry to love anybody until
she finds the friends she can cling to--without compromise.""An emotional aristocrat," Gertrude murmured."It's the curse of
taste."Jimmie cried, grimacing at Gertrude."Didn't she have
any kids her own age to play with?""She had 'em, but she didn't have any time to play with them.You
forget she was supporting a family all the time, Jimmie.""By jove, I'd like to forget it.""She had one friend named Albertina Weston that she used to run around
with in school.They used to do poetic
'stunts' of one poem a day on some subject selected by Albertina.I
think Albertina was a snob.She candidly admitted to Eleanor that if
her clothes were more stylish, she would go round with her more.Eleanor seemed to think that was perfectly natural.""If I could get one
damsel, no matter how tender her years, to confide in me like that I'd
be happy for life.It's nothing to you with those eyes, and that
matinee forehead of yours; but I want 'em to weep down my neck, and I
can't make 'em do it.""Wait till you grow up, Jimmie, and then see what happens," Gertrude
soothed him."Wait till it's your turn with our child," Margaret said."In two
months more she's coming to you.""Do I ever forget it for a minute?""The point of the whole business is," Peter continued, "that we've got
a human soul on our hands.We imported a kind of scientific plaything
to exercise our spiritual muscle on, and we've got a real specimen of
womanhood in embryo.I don't know whether the situation appalls you as
much as it does me--" He broke off as he heard the bell ring."That's David, he said he was coming."Then as David appeared laden with the lost carpetbag and a huge box of
chocolates, he waved him to a chair, and took up his speech again."I
don't know whether the situation appalls you, as much as it does
me--if I don't get this off my chest now, David, I can't do it at
all--but the thought of that poor little waif in there and the
struggle she's had, and the shy valiant spirit of her,--the sand that
she's got, the _sand_ that put her through and kept her mouth shut
through experiences that might easily have killed her, why I feel as
if I'd give anything I had in the world to make it up to her, and yet
I'm not altogether sure that I could--that we could--that it's any of
our business to try it.""There's nobody else who will, if we don't," David said."That's it," Peter said, "I've never known any one of our bunch to
quit anything that they once started in on, but just by way of
formality there is one thing we ought to do about this proposition
before we slide into it any further, and that is to agree that we want
to go on with it, that we know what we're in for, and that we're
game.""We decided all that before we sent for the kid," Jimmie said, "didn't
we?""We decided we'd adopt a child, but we didn't decide we'd adopt this
one.Taking the responsibility of this one is the question before the
house just at present.""The idea being," David added, "that she's a fairly delicate piece of
work, and as time advances she's going to be _delicater_.""And that it's an awkward matter to play with souls," Beulah
contributed; whereupon Jimmie murmured, "Browning," sotto voice."She may be all that you say, Gram," Jimmie said, after a few minutes
of silence, "a thunderingly refined and high-minded young waif, but
you will admit that without an interpreter of the same class, she
hasn't been much good to us so far.""Good lord, she isn't refined and high-minded," Peter said.She's simply supremely sensitive and full of the most
pathetic possibilities.If we're going to undertake her we ought to
realize fully what we're up against, and acknowledge it,--that's all
I'm trying to say, and I apologize for assuming that it's more my
business than anybody's to say it.""That charming humility stuff, if I could only remember to pull it."The sofa pillow that Gertrude aimed at Jimmie hit him full on the
mouth and he busied himself pretending to eat it.Beulah scorned the
interruption."Of course, we're going to undertake her," Beulah said."We are signed
up and it's all down in writing.If anybody has any objections, they
can state them now."On every young
face was reflected the same earnestness that set gravely on her own."The 'ayes' have it," Jimmie murmured."From now on I become not only
a parent, but a soul doctor."He rose, and tiptoed solemnly toward the
door of Eleanor's room.Beulah called, as he was disappearing
around the bend in the corridor.He turned back to lift an admonitory finger."Shush," he said, "do not interrupt me.I am going to wrap baby up in
a blanket and bring her out to her mothers and fathers."CHAPTER V

ELEANOR ENJOYS HERSELF IN HER OWN WAY


"I am in society here," Eleanor wrote to her friend Albertina, with a
pardonable emphasis on that phase of her new existence that would
appeal to the haughty ideals of Miss Weston, "I don't have to do any
housework, or anything.I sleep under a pink silk bedquilt, and I have
all new clothes.I have a new black pattern leather sailor hat that I
sopose you would laugh at.It cost six dollars and draws the sun down
to my head but I don't say anything.I have six aunts and uncles all
diferent names and ages but grown up.Uncle Peter is the most elderly,
he is twenty-five.I know becase we gave him a birthday party with a
cake.You would
think that was pretty, well it is.There is a servant girl to do evry
thing even passing your food to you on a tray.I wish you could come
to visit me.I stay two months in a place and get broghut up there.Aunt Beulah is peculiar but nice when you know her.She is stric and
at first I thought we was not going to get along.She thought I had
adenoids and I thought she dislikt me too much, but it turned out not.I take lessons from her every morning like they give at Rogers
College, not like publick school.I have to think what I want to do a
good deal and then do it.At first she turned me loose to enjoy myself
and I could not do it, but now we have disapline which makes it all
right.My speling is weak, but uncle Peter says Stevanson could not
spel and did not care.Stevanson was the poat who wrote the birdie
with a yellow bill in the reader.I wish you would tel me if Grandma's
eye is worse and what about Grandfather's rheumatism."P. S. We have a silver organ in all the rooms to have heat in.I was
afrayd of them at first."*       *       *       *       *

In the letters to her grandparents, however, the undercurrent of
anxiety about the old people, which was a ruling motive in her life,
became apparent.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Grandma and Dear Grandpa," she wrote,

"I have been here a weak now.I inclose my salary, fifteen dollars
($15.00) which I hope you will like.I get it for doing evry thing I
am told and being adoptid besides.You can tell the silectmen that I
am rich now and can support you just as good as Uncle Amos.I want
Grandpa to buy some heavy undershurts right of.He will get a couff if
he doesn't do it.Tell him to rub your arm evry night before you go to
bed, Grandma, and to have a hot soapstone for you.If you don't have
your bed hot you will get newmonia and I can't come home to take care
of you, becase my salary would stop.I like New York better now that I
have lived here some.I miss seeing you around, and Grandpa."The cook cooks on a gas stove that is very funny.I asked her how it
went and she showed me it.She is going to leve, but lucky thing the
hired girl can cook till Aunt Beulah gets a nother cook as antyseptic
as this cook.In Rogers College they teach ladies to have their cook's
and hired girl's antyseptic.It is a good idear becase of sickness.I
inclose a recipete for a good cake.You
don't have to stir it much, and Grandpa can bring you the things.Let me hear that you are
all right.Don't forget to put the cat out nights.I hope she is all
right, but remember the time she stole the butter fish.I miss you,
and I miss the cat around.Uncle David pays me my salary out of his
own pocket, because he is the richest, but I like Uncle Peter the
best.He is very handsome and we like to talk to each other the best.*       *       *       *       *

But it was on the varicolored pages of a ruled tablet--with a picture
on its cover of a pink cheeked young lady beneath a cherry tree, and
marked in large straggling letters also varicolored "The Cherry
Blossom Tablet"--that Eleanor put down her most sacred thoughts.On
the outside, just above the cherry tree, her name was written with a
pencil that had been many times wet to get the desired degree of
blackness, "Eleanor Hamlin, Colhassett, Massachusetts.Private Dairy,"
and on the first page was this warning in the same painstaking,
heavily shaded chirography, "This book is sacrid, and not be trespased
in or read one word of.It was the private diary and Gwendolyn, the rabbit doll, and a small
blue china shepherdess given her by Albertina, that constituted
Eleanor's _lares et penates_.When David had finally succeeded in
tracing the ancient carpetbag in the lost and found department of the
cab company, Eleanor was able to set up her household gods, and draw
from them that measure of strength and security inseparable from their
familiar presence.She always slept with two of the three beloved
objects, and after Beulah had learned to understand and appreciate the
child's need for unsupervised privacy, she divined that the little
girl was happiest when she could devote at least an hour or two a day
to the transcribing of earnest sentences on the pink, blue and yellow
pages of the Cherry Blossom Tablet, and the mysterious games that she
played with the rabbit doll.That these games consisted largely in
making the rabbit doll impersonate Eleanor, while the child herself
became in turn each one of the six uncles and aunts, and exhorted the
victim accordingly, did not of course occur to Beulah.It did occur to
her that the pink, blue and yellow pages would have made interesting
reading to Eleanor's guardians, if they had been privileged to read
all that was chronicled there.*       *       *       *       *

"My aunt Beulah wears her hair to high of her forrid."My aunt Margaret wears her hair to slic on the sides."My aunt Gertrude wears her hair just about right."My aunt Margaret is the best looking, and has the nicest way."My aunt Gertrude is the funniest.I never laugh at what she says, but
I have trouble not to.By thinking of Grandpa's rheumaticks I stop
myself just in time.Aunt Beulah means all right, and wants to do
right and have everybody else the same."Uncle David is not handsome, but good."Uncle Jimmie is not handsome, but his hair curls."Uncle Peter is the most handsome man that ere the sun shown on.He has beautiful teeth, and I like him."Yesterday the Wordsworth Club--that's what Uncle Jimmie calls us
because he says we are seven--went to the Art Museum to edjucate me in
art."Aunt Beulah wanted to take me to one room and keep me there until I
asked to come out.Uncle Jimmie wanted to show me the statures.Uncle
David said I ought to begin with the Ming period and work down to Art
Newvoo.Aunts Gertrude and Margaret wanted to take me to the room of
the great masters.While they were talking Uncle Peter and I went to
see a picture that made me cry.He said that
wasn't the important thing, that the important thing was that one man
had nailed his dream.He didn't doubt that lots of other painters had,
but this one meant the most to him.When I cried he said, 'You're all
right, Baby.*       *       *       *       *

As the month progressed, it seemed to Beulah that she was making
distinct progress with the child.Since the evening when Peter had won
Eleanor's confidence and explained her mental processes, her task had
been illumined for her.She belonged to that class of women in whom
maternity arouses late.She had not the facile sympathy which accepts
a relationship without the endorsement of the understanding, and she
was too young to have much toleration for that which was not perfectly
clear to her.She had started in with high courage to demonstrate the value of a
sociological experiment.She hoped later, though these hopes she had
so far kept to herself, to write, or at least to collaborate with some
worthy educator, on a book which would serve as an exact guide to
other philanthropically inclined groups who might wish to follow the
example of cooperative adoption; but the first day of actual contact
with her problem had chilled her.She had put nothing down in her
note-book.There seemed to be no
intellectual response in the child.Peter had set all these things right for her.He had shown her the
child's uncompromising integrity of spirit.The keynote of Beulah's
nature was, as Jimmie said, that she "had to be shown."Peter pointed
out the fact to her that Eleanor's slogan also was, "No compromise."As Eleanor became more familiar with her surroundings this spirit
became more and more evident."I could let down the hem of these dresses, Aunt Beulah," she said one
day, looking down at the long stretch of leg protruding from the chic
blue frock that made her look like a Boutet de Monvil."I can't hem
very good, but my stitches don't show much.""That dress isn't too short, dear.It's the way little girls always
wear them.Do little girls on Cape Cod wear them longer?""Albertina," they had reached the point of discussion of Albertina
now, and Beulah was proud of it, "wore her dresses to her ankles,
be--because her--her legs was so fat.She said that mine was--were
getting to be fat too, and it wasn't refined to wear short dresses,
when your legs were fat.""There are a good many conflicting ideas of refinement in the world,
Eleanor," Beulah said."I've noticed there are, since I came to New York," Eleanor answered
unexpectedly.Beulah's academic spirit recognized and rejoiced in the fact that with
all her docility, Eleanor held firmly to her preconceived notions.She
continued to wear her dresses short, but when she was not actually on
exhibition, she hid her long legs behind every available bit of
furniture or drapery.The one doubt left in her mind, of the child's initiative and
executive ability, was destined to be dissipated by the rather heroic
measures sometimes resorted to by a superior agency taking an ironic
hand in the game of which we have been too inhumanly sure.On the fifth week of Eleanor's stay Beulah became a real aunt, the
cook left, and her own aunt and official chaperon, little Miss
Prentis, was laid low with an attack of inflammatory rheumatism.Beulah's excitement on these various counts, combined with
indiscretions in the matter of overshoes and overfatigue, made her an
easy victim to a wandering grip germ.She opened her eyes one morning
only to shut them with a groan of pain.There was an ache in her head
and a thickening in her chest, the significance of which she knew only
too well.She lifted a hoarse voice
and called for Mary, the maid, who did not sleep in the house but was
due every morning at seven.But the gentle knock on the door was
followed by the entrance of Eleanor, not Mary."Mary didn't come, Aunt Beulah.I thought you was--were so tired, I'd
let you have your sleep out.I heard Miss Prentis calling, and I made
her some gruel, and I got my own breakfast."how dreadful," Beulah gasped in the face of this new calamity;
"and I'm really so sick.Then she put a professional hand on her
pulse and her forehead."You've got the grip," she announced."I'm afraid I have, Eleanor, and Doctor Martin's out of town, and
won't be back till to-morrow when he comes to Aunt Ann.I don't know
what we'll do.""I'll tend to things," Eleanor said."You lie still and close your
eyes, and don't put your arms out of bed and get chilled.""Well, you'll have to manage somehow," Beulah moaned; "how, I don't
know, I'm sure.Give Aunt Annie her medicine and hot water bags, and
just let me be.After the door had closed on the child a dozen things occurred to
Beulah that might have been done for her.She thought of the soothing warmth
of antiphlogistine when applied to the chest.She thought of the
quinine on the shelf in the bathroom.Once more she tried lifting her
head, but she could not accomplish a sitting posture.She shivered as
a draft from the open window struck her."If I could only be taken in hand this morning," she thought, "I know
it could be broken."Eleanor, in the cook's serviceable apron of
gingham that would have easily contained another child the same size,
swung the door open with one hand and held it to accommodate the
passage of the big kitchen tray, deeply laden with a heterogeneous
collection of objects.She pulled two chairs close to the bedside and
deposited her burden upon them.Then she removed from the tray a
goblet of some steaming fluid and offered it to Beulah."It's cream of wheat gruel," she said, and added ingratiatingly: "It
tastes nice in a tumbler."Beulah drank the hot decoction gratefully and found, to her surprise,
that it was deliciously made.Eleanor took the glass away from her and placed it on the tray, from
which she took what looked to Beulah like a cloth covered omelet,--at
any rate, it was a crescent shaped article slightly yellow in tone."It's just about right," she said.Then she fixed Beulah with a stern
eye."Open your chest," she commanded, "and show me the spot where
it's worst.Beulah hesitated only a second, then she obeyed meekly.She had never
seen a meal poultice before, but the heat on her afflicted chest was
grateful to her.Antiphlogistine was only Denver mud anyhow.Meekly,
also, she took the six grains of quinine and the weak dose of jamaica
ginger and water that she was next offered.She felt encouraged and
refreshed enough by this treatment to display some slight curiosity
when the little girl produced a card of villainous looking
safety-pins."I'm going to pin you in with these, Aunt Beulah," she said, "and then
sweat your cold out of you.""Indeed, you're not," Beulah said; "don't be absurd, Eleanor.The
theory of the grip is--," but she was addressing merely the vanishing
hem of cook's voluminous apron.The child returned almost instantly with three objects of assorted
sizes that Beulah could not identify.From the outside they looked
like red flannel and from the way Eleanor handled them it was evident
that they also were hot."I het--heated the flatirons," Eleanor explained, "the way I do for
Grandma, and I'm going to spread 'em around you, after you're pinned
in the blankets, and you got to lie there till you prespire, and
prespire good.""I won't do it," Beulah moaned, "I won't do any such thing."I cured Grandma and Grandpa and Mrs.O'Farrel's aunt that I worked
for, and I'm going to cure you," Eleanor said."Put your arms under those covers," she said, "or I'll dash a glass of
cold water in your face,"--and Beulah obeyed her.Peter nodded wisely when Beulah, cured by these summary though
obsolete methods, told the story in full detail.Gertrude had laughed
until the invalid had enveloped herself in the last few shreds of her
dignity and ordered her out of the room, and the others had been
scarcely more sympathetic."I know that it's funny, Peter," she said, "but you see, I can't help
worrying about it just the same.Of course, as soon as I was up she
was just as respectful and obedient to my slightest wish as she ever
was, but at the time, when she was lording it over me so, she--she
actually slapped me.You never saw such a--blazingly determined little
creature."Peter smiled,--gently, as was Peter's way when any friend of his made
an appeal to him."That's all right, Beulah," he said, "don't you let it disturb you for
an instant.This manifestation had nothing to do with our experiment.Our experiment is working fine--better than I dreamed it would ever
work.What happened to Eleanor, you know, was simply this.Some of the
conditions of her experience were recreated suddenly, and she
reverted."CHAPTER VI

JIMMIE BECOMES A PARENT


The entrance into the dining-room of the curly headed young man and
his pretty little niece, who had a suite on the eighth floor, as the
room clerk informed all inquirers, was always a matter of interest to
the residents of the Hotel Winchester.They were an extremely
picturesque pair to the eye seeking for romance and color.The child
had the pure, clear cut features of the cameo type of New England
maidenhood.She was always dressed in some striking combination of
blue, deep blue like her eyes, with blue hair ribbons.Her
good-looking young relative, with hair almost as near the color of the
sun as her own, seemed to be entirely devoted to her, which,
considering the charm of the child and the radiant and magnetic spirit
of the young man himself, was a delightfully natural manifestation.But one morning near the close of the second week of their stay, the
usual radiation of resilient youth was conspicuously absent from the
young man's demeanor, and the child's face reflected the gloom that
sat so incongruously on the contour of an optimist.The little girl
fumbled her menu card, but the waitress--the usual aging pedagogic
type of the small residential hotel--stood unnoticed at the young
man's elbow for some minutes before he was sufficiently aroused from
his gloomy meditations to address her.When he turned to her at last,
however, it was with the grin that she had grown to associate with
him,--the grin, the absence of which had kept her waiting behind his
chair with a patience that she was, except in a case where her
affections were involved, entirely incapable of.Jimmie's
protestations of inability to make headway with the ladies were not
entirely sincere."Bring me everything on the menu," he said, with a wave of his hand in
the direction of that painstaking pasteboard."Coffee, tea, fruit,
marmalade, breakfast food, ham and eggs.With another wave of the hand he dismissed her."You can't eat it all, Uncle Jimmie," Eleanor protested."I'll make a bet with you," Jimmie declared."I'll bet you a dollar
to a doughnut that if she brings it all, I'll eat it."Uncle Jimmie, you know she won't bring it.You never bet so I can
get the dollar,--you never do.""I never bet so I can get my doughnut, if it comes to that.""I don't know where to buy any doughnuts," Eleanor said; "besides,
Uncle Jimmie, I don't really consider that I owe them.I never really
say that I'm betting, and you tell me I've lost before I've made up my
mind anything about it.""Speaking of doughnuts," Jimmie said, his face still wearing the look
of dejection under a grin worn awry, "can you cook, Eleanor?Can you
roast a steak, and saute baked beans, and stew sausages, and fry out a
breakfast muffin?he suddenly
demanded of the waitress, who was serving him, with an apologetic eye
on the menu, the invariable toast-coffee-and-three-minute-egg
breakfast that he had eaten every morning since his arrival."She looks like a capable one," she
pronounced."I _can_ cook, Uncle Jimmie," Eleanor giggled, "but not the way you
said.You don't roast steak, or--or--"

"Don't you?"Jimmie asked with the expression of pained surprise that
never failed to make his ward wriggle with delight.There were links
in the educational scheme that Jimmie forged better than any of the
cooperative guardians.Not even Jimmie realized the value of the
giggle as a developing factor in Eleanor's existence.He took three
swallows of coffee and frowned into his cup."I can make coffee," he
added.Well, we may as well look the facts in the face,
Eleanor.We're moving away from this elegant hostelry
to-morrow."Apologies to Aunt Beulah (mustn't call you Kiddo) and the
reason is, that I'm broke.I haven't got any money at all, Eleanor,
and I don't know where I am going to get any."But you go to work every morning, Uncle Jimmie?"I go looking for work, but so far no nice
juicy job has come rolling down into my lap.I haven't told you this
before because,--well--when Aunt Beulah comes down every day to give
you your lessons I wanted it to look all O. K. I thought if you didn't
know, you couldn't forget sometime and tell her.""I don't tattle tale," Eleanor said.It's only my doggone pride that makes me
want to keep up the bluff, but you're a game kid,--you--know.I tried
to get you switched off to one of the others till I could get on my
feet, but--no, they just thought I had stage fright.It would be pretty humiliating to me to admit that I couldn't
support one-sixth of a child that I'd given my solemn oath to
be-parent.""Be-parent, if it isn't a word, I invent it.It's awfully tough luck
for you, and if you want me to I'll own up to the crowd that I can't
swing you, but if you are willing to stick, why, we'll fix up some
kind of a way to cut down expenses and bluff it out."Jimmie watched her apparent
hesitation with some dismay."Say the word," he declared, "and I'll tell 'em."I don't want you to tell 'em," Eleanor cried.If you could get me a place, you know, I could go out to
work.You don't eat very much for a man, and I might get my meals
thrown in--"

"Don't, Eleanor, don't," Jimmie agonized."I've got a scheme for us
all right.The day will
come when I can provide you with Pol Roge and diamonds.My father is
rich, you know, but he swore to me that I couldn't support myself, and
I swore to him that I could, and if I don't do it, I'm damned.I am
really, and that isn't swearing.""I know it isn't, when you mean it the way they say in the Bible.""I don't want the crowd to know.I don't want Gertrude to know.She
hasn't got much idea of me anyway.I'll get another job, if I can only
hold out.""I can go to work in a store," Eleanor cried."I can be one of those
little girls in black dresses that runs between counters.""Do you want to break your poor Uncle James' heart, Eleanor,--do
you?"I've borrowed a studio, a large barnlike studio on
Washington Square, suitably equipped with pots and pans and kettles.Also, I am going to borrow the wherewithal to keep us going.It isn't
a bad kind of place if anybody likes it.There's one dinky little
bedroom for you and a cot bed for me, choked in bagdad.If you could
kind of engineer the cooking end of it, with me to do the dirty work,
of course, I think we could be quite snug and cozy.""I know we could, Uncle Jimmie," Eleanor said."Will Uncle Peter come
to see us just the same?"It thus befell that on the fourteenth day of the third month of her
residence in New York, Eleanor descended into Bohemia.Having no least
suspicion of the real state of affairs--for Jimmie, like most
apparently expansive people who are given to rattling nonsense, was
actually very reticent about his own business--the other members of
the sextette did not hesitate to show their chagrin and disapproval at
the change in his manner of living."The Winchester was an ideal place for Eleanor," Beulah wailed."It's
deadly respectable and middle class, but it was just the kind of
atmosphere for her to accustom herself to.She was learning to manage
herself so prettily.This morning when I went to the studio--I wanted
to get the lessons over early, and take Eleanor to see that exhibition
of Bavarian dolls at Kuhner's--I found her washing up a trail of
dishes in that closet behind the screen--you've seen it,
Gertrude?--like some poor little scullery maid.She said that Jimmie
had made an omelet for breakfast.If he'd made fifty omelets there
couldn't have been a greater assortment of dirty dishes and kettles.""Jimmie made an omelet for me once for which he used two dozen eggs.He kept breaking them until he found the yolks of a color to suit him.He said pale yolks made poor omelets, so he threw all the pale ones
away.""I suppose that you sat by and let him," Beulah said."You would let
Jimmie do anything.You're as bad as Margaret is about David.""Or as bad as you are about Peter.""There we go, just like any silly, brainless girls, whose chief object
in life is the--the other sex," Beulah cried inconsistently."So do I--in theory--" Gertrude answered, a little dreamily."Where do
Jimmie and Eleanor get the rest of their meals?""I can't seem to find out," Beulah said."I asked Eleanor point-blank
this morning what they had to eat last night and where they had it,
and she said, 'That's a secret, Aunt Beulah.'When I asked her why it
was a secret and who it was a secret with, she only looked worried,
and said she guessed she wouldn't talk about it at all because that
was the only way to be safe about tattling.You know what I think--I
think Jimmie is taking her around to the cafes and all the shady
extravagant restaurants.He thinks it's sport and it keeps him from
getting bored with the child.""Well, that's one way of educating the young," Gertrude said, "but I
think you are wrong, Beulah."CHAPTER VII

ONE DESCENT INTO BOHEMIA


"Aunt Beulah does not think that Uncle Jimmie is bringing me up
right," Eleanor confided to the pages of her diary."She comes down
here and is very uncomforterble.Well he is bringing me up good, in
some ways better than she did.When he swears he always puts out his
hand for me to slap him.He can't get any
work or earn wages.The advertisement business is on the bum this year
becase times are so hard up.The advertisers have to save their money
and advertising agents are failing right and left.So poor Uncle
Jimmie can't get a place to work at."The people in the other studios are very neighborly.Uncle Jimmie
leaves a sine on the door when he goes out.They don't they come right in and borrow things.Uncle Jimmie says not
to have much to do with them, becase they are so queer, but when I am
not at home, the ladies come to call on him, and drink Moxie or
something.Uncle Jimmie says I shall
not have Behemiar thrust upon me by him, and to keep away from these
ladies until I grow up and then see if I like them.Aunt Beulah thinks
that Uncle Jimmie takes me around to other studios and I won't tell
but he does not take me anywhere except to walk and have ice-cream
soda, but I say I don't want it because of saving the ten cents.We
cook on an old gas stove that smells.I can't do very good
housekeeping becase things are not convenient.I haven't any oven to
do a Saturday baking in, and Uncle Jimmie won't let me do the washing.I should feel more as if I earned my keap if I baked beans and made
boiled dinners and layer cake, but in New York they don't eat much but
hearty food and saluds.It isn't stylish to have cake and pie and
pudding all at one meal.He eats pie for
his breakfast, but if I told anybody they would laugh.If I wrote
Albertina what folks eat in New York she would laugh."Uncle Jimmie is teaching me to like salud.He laughs when I cut up
lettice and put sugar on it.He teaches me to like olives and dried
up sausages and sour crought.He says it is important to be edjucated
in eating, and everytime we go to the Delicate Essenn store to buy
something that will edjucate me better.He teaches me to say 'I beg
your pardon,' and 'Polly vous Fransay?'and to courtesy and how to
enter a room the way you do in private theatricals.He says it isn't
knowing these things so much as knowing when you do them that counts,
and then Aunt Beulah complains that I am not being brought up."I have not seen Uncle Peter for a weak.I would not have to tell him how I was being brought up, and
whether I was hitting the white lights as Uncle Jimmie says.--He would
know."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor did not write Albertina during the time when she was living in
the studio.Some curious inversion of pride kept her silent on the
subject of the change in her life.Albertina would have turned up her
nose at the studio, Eleanor knew.Therefore, she would not so much as
address an envelope to that young lady from an interior which she
would have beheld with scorn.She held long conversations with
Gwendolyn, taking the part of Albertina, on the subject of this
snobbishness of attitude.*       *       *       *       *

"Lots of people in New York have to live in little teny, weeny rooms,
Albertina," she would say.This
studio is so big I get tired dusting all the way round it, and even if
it isn't furnished very much, why, think how much furnishing would
cost, and carpets and gold frames for the pictures!The pictures that
are in here already, without any frames, would sell for hundreds of
dollars apiece if the painter could get anybody to buy them.You ought
to be very thankful for such a place, Albertina, instead of feeling so
stuck up that you pick up your skirts from it."*       *       *       *       *

But Albertina's superiority of mind was impregnable.Her spirit sat in
judgment on all the conditions of Eleanor's new environment.She hated the nicked, dun 
dishes they ate from, and the black bottomed pots and pans that all
the energy of Eleanor's energetic little elbow could not restore to
decency again.She hated the cracked, dun  walls, and the
mottled floor that no amount of sweeping and dusting seemed to make an
impression on.She hated the compromise of housekeeping in an
attic,--she who had been bred in an atmosphere of shining
nickle-plated ranges and linoleum, where even the kitchen pump gleamed
brightly under its annual coat of good green paint.She hated the
compromise, that was the burden of her complaint--either in the person
of Albertina or Gwendolyn, whether she lay in the crook of Eleanor's
arm in the lumpy bed where she reposed at the end of the day's labor,
or whether she sat bolt upright on the lumpy cot in the studio, the
broken bisque arm, which Jimmie insisted on her wearing in a sling
whenever he was present, dangling limply at her side in the relaxation
Eleanor preferred for it.The fact of not having adequate opportunity to keep her house in order
troubled the child, for her days were zealously planned by her
enthusiastic guardians.Beulah came at ten o'clock every morning to
give her lessons.As Jimmie's quest for work grew into a more and more
disheartening adventure, she had difficulty in getting him out of bed
in time to prepare and clear away the breakfast for Beulah's arrival.After lunch, to which Jimmie scrupulously came home, she was supposed
to work an hour at her modeling clay.Gertrude, who was doing very
promising work at the art league, came to the studio twice a week to
give her instruction in handling it.Later in the afternoon one of the
aunts or uncles usually appeared with some scheme to divert her.Margaret was telling her the stories of the Shakespeare plays, and
David was trying to make a card player of her, but was not succeeding
as well as if Albertina had not been brought up a hard shell Baptist,
who thought card playing a device of the devil's.Peter alone did not
come, for even when he was in town he was busy in the afternoon.As soon as her guests were gone, Eleanor hurried through such
housewifely tasks as were possible of accomplishment at that hour, but
the strain was telling on her.Jimmie began to realize this and it
added to his own distress.One night to save her the labor of
preparing the meal, he took her to an Italian restaurant in the
neighborhood where the food was honest and palatable, and the service
at least deft and clean.Eleanor enjoyed the experience extremely, until an incident occurred
which robbed her evening of its sweetness and plunged her into the
purgatory of the child who has inadvertently broken one of its own
laws.Among the belongings in the carpetbag, which was no more--having been
supplanted by a smart little suit-case marked with her initials--was a
certificate from the Massachusetts Total Abstinence Society, duly
signed by herself, and witnessed by the grammar-school teacher and the
secretary of the organization.On this certificate (which was
decorated by many presentations in dim black and white of
mid-Victorian domestic life, and surmounted by a collection of
scalloped clouds in which drifted three amateur looking angels amid a
crowd of more professional cherubim) Eleanor had pledged herself to
abstain from the use as a beverage of all intoxicating drinks, and
from the manufacture or traffic in them.She had also subscribed
herself as willing to make direct and persevering efforts to extend
the principles and blessings of total abstinence."Red ink, Andrea," her Uncle Jimmie had demanded, as the black-eyed
waiter bent over him, "and ginger ale for the offspring."It was fun to be with Uncle Jimmie in a restaurant again.He
always called for something new and unexpected when he spoke of her to
the waiter, and he was always what Albertina would consider "very
comical" when he talked to him."But stay," he added holding up an
admonitory finger, "I think we'll give the little one _eau rougie_
this time.Wouldn't you like _eau rougie_, tinted water, Eleanor, the
way the French children drink it?"Unsuspectingly she sipped the mixture of water and ice and sugar, and
"red ink" from the big brown glass bottle that the glowing waiter set
before them.As the meal progressed Jimmie told her that the grated cheese was
sawdust and almost made her believe it.He showed her how to eat
spaghetti without cutting it and pointed out to her various Italian
examples of his object lesson; but she soon realized that in spite of
his efforts to entertain her, he was really very unhappy."I've borrowed all the money I can, Angelface," he confessed finally.If I don't land that job at the
Perkins agency I'll have to give in and tell Peter and David, or wire
Dad.""You could get some other kind of a job," Eleanor said; "plumbing or
clerking or something."On Cape Cod the plumber and the grocer's clerk
lost no caste because of their calling."I _could_ so demean myself, and I will.I'll be a chauffeur, I can
run a car all right; but the fact remains that by to-morrow
something's got to happen, or I've got to own up to the bunch."She tried hard to think of something to comfort
him but she could not.Jimmie mixed her more _eau rougie_ and she
drank it.He poured a full glass, undiluted, for himself, and held it
up to the light."Well, here's to crime, daughter," he said."Long may it wave, and us
with it.""That isn't really red ink, is it?""It's an awfully pretty
color--like grape juice.""It is grape juice, my child, if we don't inquire too closely into the
matter.The Italians are like the French in the guide book, 'fond of
dancing and light wines.'This is one of the light wines they are fond
of.--Hello, do you feel sick, child?As soon as I can get hold of that sacrificed waiter we'll get
out of here."Eleanor's sickness was of the spirit, but at the moment she was
incapable of telling him so, incapable of any sort of speech.A great
wave of faintness encompassed her.She had
lightly encouraged a departure from the blessings and principles of
total abstinence.That night in her bed she made a long and impassioned apology to her
Maker for the sin of intemperance into which she had been so
unwittingly betrayed.She promised Him that she would never drink
anything that came out of a bottle again.She reviewed sorrowfully her
many arguments with Albertina--Albertina in the flesh that is--on the
subject of bottled drinks in general, and decided that again that
virtuous child was right in her condemnation of any drink, however
harmless in appearance or nomenclature, that bore the stigma of a
bottled label.She knew, however, that something more than a prayer for forgiveness
was required of her.She was pledged to protest against the evil that
she had seemingly countenanced.She could not seek the sleep of the
innocent until that reparation was made.Through the crack of her
sagging door she saw the light from Jimmie's reading lamp and knew
that he was still dressed, or clothed at least, with a sufficient
regard for the conventionalities to permit her intrusion.She rose and
rebraided her hair and tied a daytime ribbon on it.Then she put on
her stockings and her blue Japanese kimono--real Japanese, as Aunt
Beulah explained, made for a Japanese lady of quality--and made her
way into the studio.Jimmie was not sitting in the one comfortable studio chair with his
book under the light and his feet on the bamboo tea table as usual.He was flung on the couch with his face
buried in the cushions, and his shoulders were shaking.Eleanor seeing
him thus, forgot her righteous purpose, forgot her pledge to
disseminate the principles and blessings of abstinence, forgot
everything but the pitiful spectacle of her gallant Uncle Jimmie in
grief.She stood looking down at him without quite the courage to
kneel at his side to give him comfort."Uncle Jimmie," she said, "Uncle Jimmie."At the sound of her voice he put out his hand to her, gropingly, but
he did not uncover his face or shift his position.She found herself
smoothing his hair, gingerly at first, but with more and more
conviction as he snuggled his boyish head closer."I'm awfully discouraged," he said in a weak muffled voice."I'm sorry
you caught me at it, Baby."Eleanor put her face down close to his as he turned it to her."Everything will be all right," she promised him, "everything will be
all right.You'll soon get a job--tomorrow maybe."Then she gathered him close in her angular, tense little arms and held
him there tightly."Everything will be all right," she repeated
soothingly; "now you just put your head here, and have your cry out."CHAPTER VIII

THE TEN HUTCHINSONS


"My Aunt Margaret has a great many people living in her family,"
Eleanor wrote to Albertina from her new address on Morningside
Heights."She has a mother and a father, and two (2) grandparents, one
(1) aunt, one (1) brother, one (1) married lady and the boy of the
lady, I think the married lady is a sister but I do not ask any one,
oh--and another brother, who does not live here only on Saturdays and
Sundays.Aunt Margaret makes ten, and they have a man to wait on the
table.I guess you have read about them in
stories.I am taken right in to be one of the family, and I have a
good time every day now.Aunt Margaret's father is a college teacher,
and Aunt Margaret's grandfather looks like the father of his country.They have a piano here that
plays itself like a sewing machine.They have
after-dinner coffee and gold spoons to it.I guess you would like to
see a gold spoon.They are about the size of the tin spoons we
had in our playhouse.I have a lot of fun with that boy too.At first
I thought he was very affected, but that is just the way they teach
him to talk.He is nine and plays tricks on other people.He dares me
to do things that I don't do, like go down-stairs and steal sugar.If
Aunt Margaret's mother was my grandma I might steal sugar or plum
cake.Remember the time we took your mother's hermits?You would think this house was quite a
grand house.It has three (3) flights of stairs and one basement.I
sleep on the top floor in a dressing room out of Aunt Margaret's only
it isn't a dressing room.Aunt
Margaret is pretty and sings lovely.*       *       *       *       *

In her diary she recorded some of the more intimate facts of her new
existence, such facts as she instinctively guarded from Albertina's
calculating sense.*       *       *       *       *

"Everybody makes fun of me here.I don't care if they do, but I can't
eat so much at the table when every one is laughing at me.They get
me to talking and then they laugh.If I could see anything to laugh
at, I would laugh too.They laugh in a refined way but they laugh.They say to
my face that I am like a merry wilkins story and too good to be true,
and New England projuces lots of real art, and I am art, I can't
remember all the things, but I guess they mean well.Aunt Margaret's
grandfather sits at the head of the table, and talks about things I
never heard of before.He knows the govoner and does not like the way
he parts his hair.I thought all govoners did what they wanted to with
their hairs or anything and people had to like it because (I used to
spell because wrong but I spell better now) they was the govoners, but
it seems not at all.I meant to like
Aunt Beulah the best because she has done the most for me but I am
afrayd I don't.I would not cross my heart and say so.Aunt Margaret
gives me the lessons now.I guess I learn most as much as I learned I
mean was taught of Aunt Beulah.Oh dear sometimes I get descouraged
on account of its being such a funny world and so many diferent people
in it.I was afrayd of the hired
butler, but I am not now."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor had not made a direct change from the Washington Square studio
to the ample house of the Hutchinsons, and it was as well for her that
a change in Jimmie's fortunes had taken her back to the Winchester and
enabled her to accustom herself again to the amenities of gentler
living.Like all sensitive and impressionable children she took on the
color of a new environment very quickly.The strain of her studio
experience had left her a little cowed and unsure of herself, but she
had brightened up like a flower set in the cheerful surroundings of
the Winchester and under the influence of Jimmie's restored spirits.The change had come about on Jimmie's "last day of grace."He had
secured the coveted position at the Perkins agency at a slight advance
over the salary he had received at the old place.He had left Eleanor
in the morning determined to face becomingly the disappointment that
was in store for him, and to accept the bitter necessity of admitting
his failure to his friends.He had come back in the late afternoon
with his fortunes restored, the long weeks of humiliation wiped out,
and his life back again on its old confident and inspired footing.He had burst into the studio with his news before he understood that
Eleanor was not alone, and inadvertently shared the secret with
Gertrude, who had been waiting for him with the kettle alight and some
wonderful cakes from "Henri's" spread out on the tea table.The three
had celebrated by dining together at a festive down-town hotel and
going back to his studio for coffee.At parting they had solemnly and
severally kissed one another.Eleanor lay awake in the dark for a long
time that night softly rubbing the cheek that had been so caressed,
and rejoicing that the drink Uncle Jimmie had called a high-ball and
had pledged their health with so assiduously, had come out of two
glasses instead of a bottle.Her life at the Hutchinsons' was almost like a life on another planet.Margaret was the younger, somewhat delicate daughter of a family of
rather strident academics.Professor Hutchinson was not dependent on
his salary to defray the expenses of his elegant establishment, but
on his father, who had inherited from his father in turn the
substantial fortune on which the family was founded.Margaret was really a child of the fairies, but she was considerably
more fortunate in her choice of a foster family than is usually the
fate of the foundling.The rigorous altitude of intellect in which she
was reared served as a corrective to the oversensitive quality of her
imagination.Eleanor, who in the more leisurely moments of her life was given to
visitations from the poetic muse, was inspired to inscribe some lines
to her on one of the pink pages of the private diary.They ran as
follows, and even Professor Hutchinson, who occupied the chair of
English in that urban community of learning that so curiously bisects
the neighborhood of Harlem, could not have designated Eleanor's
description of his daughter as one that did not describe."Aunt Margaret is fair and kind,
                  And very good and tender."She moves around the room with grace,
                  Her hands she puts with quickness.Although she wears upon her face
                  The shadow of a sickness."It was this "shadow of a sickness," that served to segregate Margaret
to the extent that was really necessary for her well being.To have
shared perpetually in the almost superhuman activities of the family
might have forever dulled that delicate spirit to which Eleanor came
to owe so much in the various stages of her development.Margaret put her arm about the child after the ordeal of the first
dinner at the big table."Father does not bite," she said, "but Grandfather does.If Grandfather shows his teeth, run for your
life.""I don't know where to run to," Eleanor answered seriously, whereupon
Margaret hugged her.Her Aunt Margaret would have been puzzling to
Eleanor beyond any hope of extrication, but for the quick imagination
that unwound her riddles almost as she presented them.For one
terrible minute Eleanor had believed that Hugh Hutchinson senior did
bite, he looked so much like some of the worst of the pictures in
Little Red Riding Hood."While you are here I'm going to pretend you're my very own child,"
Margaret told Eleanor that first evening, "and we'll never, never tell
anybody all the foolish games we play and the things we say to each
other.I can just barely manage to be grown up in the bosom of my
family, and when I am in the company of your esteemed Aunt Beulah, but
up here in my room, Eleanor, I am never grown up.She opened a funny old chest in the
corner of the spacious, high studded chamber."And here are some of
the dolls that I play with."She produced a manikin dressed primly
after the manner of eighteen-thirty, prim parted hair over a small
head festooned with ringlets, a fichu, and mits painted on her
fingers."Beulah," she said with a mischievous flash of a grimace at
Eleanor."Gertrude,"--a dashing young brunette in riding clothes."Jimmie,"--a curly haired dandy."David,"--a serious creature with a
monocle."I couldn't find Peter," she said, "but we'll make him some
day out of cotton and water colors."Eleanor cried in delight, "real dolls with
hair and different  eyes?""I can make pretty good ones," Margaret smiled; "manikins like
these,--a Frenchwoman taught me."And do you play that the dolls talk to each other as if
they was--were the persons?"Margaret assembled the four manikins into a smart little
group.The doll Beulah rose,--on her forefinger."I can't help
feeling," mimicked Margaret in a perfect reproduction of Beulah's
earnest contralto, "that we're wasting our lives,--criminally
dissipating our forces."The doll Gertrude put up both hands."I want to laugh," she cried,
"won't everybody please stop talking till I've had my laugh out."Why, that's just like Aunt Gertrude," Eleanor said."Her voice has
that kind of a sound like a bell, only more ripply.""Don't be high-brow," Jimmie's lazy baritone besought with the slight
burring of the "r's" that Eleanor found so irresistible."I'm only a
poor hard-working, business man.""We intend to devote the
rest of our lives," he said, "to the care of our beloved cooperative
orphan."On that he made a rather over mannered exit, Margaret
planting each foot down deliberately until she flung him back in his
box."That's the kind of a silly your Aunt Margaret is," she
continued, "but you mustn't ever tell anybody, Eleanor."She clasped
the child again in one of her warm, sudden embraces, and Eleanor
squeezing her shyly in return was altogether enraptured with her new
existence."But there isn't any doll for _you_, Aunt Margaret," she cried.yes, there is, but I wasn't going to show her to you unless you
asked, because she's so nice.I saved the prettiest one of all to be
myself, not because I believe I'm so beautiful, but--but only because
I'd like to be, Eleanor.""I always pretend I'm a princess," Eleanor admitted.The Aunt Margaret doll was truly a beautiful creation, a little more
like Marie Antoinette than her namesake, but bearing a not
inconsiderable resemblance to both, as Margaret pointed out,
judicially analyzing her features.Eleanor played with the rabbit doll only at night after this.In the
daytime she looked rather battered and ugly to eyes accustomed to the
delicate finish of creatures like the French manikins, but after she
was tucked away in her cot in the passion flower dressing-room--all of
Margaret's belongings and decorations were a faint, pinky
lavender,--her dear daughter Gwendolyn, who impersonated Albertina at
increasingly rare intervals as time advanced, lay in the hollow of her
arm and received her sacred confidences and ministrations as usual.*       *       *       *       *

"When my two (2) months are up here I think I should be quite sorry,"
she wrote in the diary, "except that I'm going to Uncle Peter next,
and him I would lay me down and dee for, only I never get time enough
to see him, and know if he wants me to, when I live with him I shall
know.Well life is very exciting all the time now.Aunt Margaret
brings me up this way.She tells me that she loves me and that I've
got beautiful eyes and hair and am sweet.She says she wants to love me up enough to last because I never
had love enough before.Albertina never loves any
one, but on Cape Cod nobody loves anybody--not to say so anyway.If a
man is getting married they say he _likes_ that girl he is going to
marry.In New York they act as different as they eat.The Hutchinsons
act different from anybody.They do not know Aunt Margaret has adoptid
me.Nobody knows I am adoptid but me and my aunts and uncles.Miss
Prentis and Aunt Beulah's mother when she came home and all the
bohemiar ladies and all the ten Hutchinsons think I am a little
visiting girl from the country.It is nobody's business because I am
supported out of allowances and salaries, but it makes me feel queer
sometimes.I feel like

                "'Where did you come from, baby dear,
                Out of the nowhere unto the here?'Also I made this up out of home sweet home."'Pleasures and palaces where e'er I may roam,
            Be it ever so humble I wish I had a home.'"I like having six homes, but I wish everybody knew it.Speaking of homes I asked Aunt Margaret why my aunts
and uncles did not marry each other and make it easier for every one.She said they were not going to get married.'Am I the same thing as getting married?'She said no, I
wasn't except that I was a responsibility to keep them unselfish and
real.Aunt Beulah doesn't believe in marriage.Aunt Margaret doesn't think she has the health.Aunt Gertrude has
to have a career of sculpture, Uncle David has got to marry some one
his mother says to or not at all, and does not like to marry anyway.Uncle Jimmie never saw a happy mariage yet and thinks you have a beter
time in single blesedness.Uncle Peter did not sign in the book where
they said they would adopt me and not marry.They did not want to ask
him because he had some trouble once.Well I am
going to be married sometime.I want a house to do the housework in
and a husband and a backyard full of babies.Perhaps I would rather
have a hired butler and gold spoons.Of course I
would like to have time to write poetry.I can sculpture too, but I
don't want a career of it because it's so dirty."*       *       *       *       *

Physically Eleanor throve exceedingly during this phase of her
existence.The nourishing food and regular living, the sympathy
established between herself and Margaret, the regime of physical
exercise prescribed by Beulah which she had been obliged guiltily to
disregard during the strenuous days of her existence in Washington
Square, all contributed to the accentuation of her material
well-being.She played with Margaret's nephew, and ran up and down
stairs on errands for her mother.She listened to the tales related
for her benefit by the old people, and gravely accepted the attentions
of the two formidable young men of the family, who entertained her
with the pianola and excerpts from classic literature and folk lore.*       *       *       *       *

"The We Are Sevens meet every Saturday afternoon," she wrote--on a
yellow page this time--"usually at Aunt Beulah's house.I am examined on what I have learned but I don't mind
it much.Physically I am found to be very good by measure and waite.I am very bright on the subject of
poetry.They do not know whether David Copperfield had been a wise
choice for me, but when I told them the story and talked about it they
said I had took it right.I don't tell them about the love part of
Aunt Margaret's bringing up.Aunt Beulah says it would make me self
conscioush to know that I had such pretty eyes and hair.Aunt Gertrude
said 'why not mention my teeth to me, then,' but no one seemed to
think so.Aunt Beulah says not to develope my poetry because the
theory is to strengthen the weak part of the bridge, and make me do
arithmetic.'Drill on the deficiency,' she says.Well I should think
the love part was a deficiency, but Aunt Beulah thinks love is weak
and beneath her and any one.Uncle David told me privately that he
thought I was having the best that could happen to me right now being
with Aunt Margaret.I didn't tell him that the David doll always gets
put away in the box with the Aunt Margaret doll and nobody else ever,
but I should like to have.*       *       *       *       *

Some weeks later she wrote to chronicle a painful scene in which she
had participated.*       *       *       *       *

"I quarreled with the ten Hutchinsons.They laughed
at me too much for being a little girl and a Cape Codder, but they
could if they wanted to, but when they laughed at Aunt Margaret for
adopting me and the tears came in her eyes I could not bare it.I did
not let the cat out of the bag, but I made it jump out.The
Grandfather asked me when I was going back to Cape Cod, and I said I
hoped never, and then I said I was going to visit Uncle Peter and Aunt
Gertrude and Uncle David next.They said 'Uncle David--do you mean
David Bolling?'and I did, so I said 'yes.'Then all the Hutchinsons
pitched into Aunt Margaret and kept laughing and saying, 'Who is this
mysterious child anyway, and how is it that her guardians intrust her
to a crowd of scatter brain youngsters for so long?'and then they
said 'Uncle David Bolling--_what_ does his mother say?'Then Aunt
Margaret got very red in the face and the tears started to come, and I
said 'I am not a mysterious child, and my Uncle David is as much my
Uncle David as they all are,' and then I said 'My Aunt Margaret has
got a perfect right to have me intrusted to her at any time, and not
to be laughed at for it,' and I went and stood in front of her and
gave her my handkercheve."Well I am glad somebody has been told that I am properly adoptid, but
I am sorry it is the ten Hutchinsons who know."CHAPTER IX

PETER


Uncle Peter treated her as if she were grown up; that was the
wonderful thing about her visit to him,--if there could be one thing
about it more wonderful than another.From the moment when he ushered
her into his friendly, low ceiled drawing-room with its tiers upon
tiers of book shelves, he admitted her on terms of equality to the
miraculous order of existence that it was the privilege of her life to
share.The pink silk coverlet and the elegance of the silver coated
steampipes at Beulah's; the implacable British stuffiness at the
Winchester which had had its own stolid charm for the lineal
descendant of the Pilgrim fathers; the impressively casual atmosphere
over which the "hired butler" presided distributing after-dinner gold
spoons, these impressions all dwindled and diminished and took their
insignificant place in the background of the romance she was living
and breathing in Peter's jewel box of an apartment on Thirtieth
Street.Even to more sophisticated eyes than Eleanor's the place seemed to be
a realized ideal of charm and homeliness.It was one of the older
fashioned duplex apartments designed in a more aristocratic decade for
a more fastidious generation, yet sufficiently adapted to the modern
insistence on technical convenience.Peter owed his home to his
married sister, who had discovered it and leased it and settled it and
suddenly departed for a five years' residence in China with her
husband, who was as she so often described him, "a blooming
Englishman, and an itinerant banker."Peter's domestic affairs were
despatched by a large, motherly Irishwoman, whom Eleanor approved of
on sight and later came to respect and adore without reservation.Peter's home was a home with a place in it for her--a place that it
was perfectly evident was better with her than without her.She even
slept in the bed that Peter's sister's little girl had occupied, and
there were pictures on the walls that had been selected for her.She had been very glad to make her escape from the Hutchinson
household.Her "quarrel" with them had made no difference in their
relation to her.To her surprise they treated her with an increase of
deference after her outburst, and every member of the family,
excepting possibly Hugh Hutchinson senior, was much more carefully
polite to her.Margaret explained that the family really didn't mind
having their daughter a party to the experiment of cooperative
parenthood.It appealed to them as a very interesting try-out of
modern educational theory, and their own theories of the independence
of the individual modified their criticism of Margaret's secrecy in
the matter, which was the only criticism they had to make since
Margaret had an income of her own accruing from the estate of the aunt
for whom she had been named."It is very silly of me to be sensitive about being laughed at,"
Margaret concluded."I've lived all my life surrounded by people
suffering from an acute sense of humor, but I never, never, never
shall get used to being held up to ridicule for things that are not
funny to me.""I shouldn't think you would," Eleanor answered devoutly.In Peter's house there was no one to laugh at her but Peter, and when
Peter laughed she considered it a triumph.It meant that there was
something she said that he liked.The welcome she had received as a
guest in his house and the wonderful evening that succeeded it were
among the epoch making hours in Eleanor's life.The Hutchinson victoria, for Grandmother Hutchinson still clung to the
old-time, stately method of getting about the streets of New York, had
left her at Peter's door at six o'clock of a keen, cool May evening.Margaret had not been well enough to come with her, having been
prostrated by one of the headaches of which she was a frequent
victim.The low door of ivory white, beautifully carved and paneled, with its
mammoth brass knocker, the row of window boxes along the cornice a few
feet above it, the very look of the house was an experience and an
adventure to her.When she rang, the door opened almost instantly
revealing Peter on the threshold with his arms open.He had led her up
two short flights of stairs--ivory white with carved banisters, she
noticed, all as immaculately shining with soap and water as a Cape Cod
interior--to his own gracious drawing-room where Mrs.Finnigan was
bowing and smiling a warmhearted Irish welcome to her.It was like a
wonderful story in a book and her eyes were shining with joy as Uncle
Peter pulled out her chair and she sat down to the first meal in her
honor.The grown up box of candy at her plate, the grave air with
which Peter consulted her tastes and her preferences were all a part
of a beautiful magic that had never quite touched her before.She had been like a little girl in a dream passing dutifully or
delightedly through the required phases of her experience, never quite
believing in its permanence or reality; but her life with Uncle Peter
was going to be real, and her own.That was what she felt the moment
she stepped over his threshold.After their coffee before the open fire--she herself had had "cambric"
coffee--Peter smoked his cigar, while she curled up in silence in the
twin to his big cushioned chair and sampled her chocolates.The blue
flames skimmed the bed of black coals, and finally settled steadily at
work on them nibbling and sputtering until the whole grate was like a
basket full of molten light, glowing and golden as the hot sun when it
sinks into the sea.Except to offer her the ring about his slender Panatela, and to ask
her if she were happy, Peter did not speak until he had deliberately
crushed out the last spark from his stub and thrown it into the fire.The ceremony over, he held out his arms to her and she slipped into
them as if that moment were the one she had been waiting for ever
since the white morning looked into the window of the lavender
dressing-room on Morningside Heights, and found her awake and quite
cold with the excitement of thinking of what the day was to bring
forth."Eleanor," Peter said, when he was sure she was comfortably arranged
with her head on his shoulder, "Eleanor, I want you to feel at home
while you are here, really at home, as if you hadn't any other home,
and you and I belonged to each other.I'm almost too young to be your
father, but--"

"Oh!Eleanor asked fervently, as he paused.

"--But I can come pretty near feeling like a father to you if it's a
father you want.I lost my own father when I was a little older than
you are now, but I had my dear mother and sister left, and so I don't
know what it's like to be all alone in the world, and I can't always
understand exactly how you feel, but you must always remember that I
want to understand and that I will understand if you tell me."Yes, Uncle Peter," she said soberly; then perhaps for the first time
since her babyhood she volunteered a caress that was not purely
maternal in its nature.She put up a shy hand to the cheek so close to
her own and patted it earnestly."Of course I've got my grandfather
and grandmother," she argued, "but they're very old, and not very
affectionate, either.Then I have all these new aunts and uncles
pretending," she was penetrating to the core of the matter, Peter
realized, "that they're just as good as parents.Of course, they're
just as good as they can be and they take so much trouble that it
mortifies me, but it isn't just the same thing, Uncle Peter!""I know," Peter said, "I know, dear, but you must remember we mean
well.""I don't mean you; it isn't you that I think of when I think about my
co--co-woperative parents, and it isn't any of them specially,--it's
just the idea of--of visiting around, and being laughed at, and not
really belonging to anybody.""That was what I hoped you would say, Uncle Peter," she whispered.They had a long talk after this, discussing the past and the future;
the past few months of the experiment from Eleanor's point of view,
and the future in relation to its failures and successes.Beulah was
to begin giving her lessons again and she was to take up music with a
visiting teacher on Peter's piano.(Eleanor had not known it was a
piano at first, as she had never seen a baby grand before.Peter did
not know what a triumph it was when she made herself put the question
to him.)"If my Aunt Beulah could teach me as much as she does and make it as
interesting as Aunt Margaret does, I think I would make her feel very
proud of me," Eleanor said."I get so nervous saving energy the way
Aunt Beulah says for me to that I forget all the lesson.Aunt Margaret
tells too many stories, I guess, but I like them.""Your Aunt Margaret is a child of God," Peter said devoutly, "in spite
of her raw-boned, intellectual family.""Uncle David says she's a daughter of the fairies."When Margaret's a year or two older you won't feel
the need of a mother.""I don't now," said Eleanor; "only a father,--that I want you to be,
the way you promised."Then he continued musingly, "You'll find
Gertrude--different.I can't quite imagine her presiding over your
moral welfare but I think she'll be good at it.She's a good deal of a
person, you know.""Aunt Beulah's a good kind of person, too," Eleanor said; "she tries
hard.The only thing is that she keeps trying to make me express
myself, and I don't know what that means.""Let me see if I can tell you," said Peter."Self-expression is a part
of every man's duty.Inside we are all trying to be good and true and
fine--"

"Except the villains," Eleanor interposed."People like Iago aren't
trying.""Well, we'll make an exception of the villains; we're talking of
people like us, pretty good people with the right instincts.Well
then, if all the time we're trying to be good and true and fine, we
carry about a blank face that reflects nothing of what we are feeling
and thinking, the world is a little worse off, a little duller and
heavier place for what is going on inside of us.""Well, how can we make it better off then?""By not thinking too much about it for one thing, except to remember
to smile, by trying to be just as much at home in it as possible, by
letting the kind of person we are trying to be show through on the
outside."By just not being bashful, do you mean?""Well, when Aunt Beulah makes me do those dancing exercises, standing
up in the middle of the floor and telling me to be a flower and
express myself as a flower, does she just mean not to be bashful?""Something like that: she means stop thinking of yourself and go
ahead--"

"But how can I go ahead with her sitting there watching?""I suppose I ought to tell you to imagine that you had the soul of a
flower, but I haven't the nerve.""You've got nerve enough to do anything," Eleanor assured him, but she
meant it admiringly, and seriously."I haven't the nerve to go on with a moral conversation in which you
are getting the better of me at every turn," Peter laughed."I'm sure
it's unintentional, but you make me feel like a good deal of an ass,
Eleanor.""That means a donkey, doesn't it?""It does, and by jove, I believe that you're glad of it.""I do rather like it," said Eleanor; "of course you don't really feel
like a donkey to me.I mean I don't make you feel like one, but it's
funny just pretending that you mean it.""Beulah tried to convey something of
the fact that you always got the better of every one in your modest
unassuming way, but I never quite believed it before.At any rate it's
bedtime, and here comes Mrs.Kiss me good
night, sweetheart."Eleanor flung her arms about his neck, in her first moment of
abandonment to actual emotional self-expression if Peter had only
known it."I will never really get the better of you in my life, Uncle Peter,"
she promised him passionately.CHAPTER X

THE OMNISCIENT FOCUS


One of the traditional prerogatives of an Omnipotent Power is to look
down at the activities of earth at any given moment and ascertain
simultaneously the occupation of any number of people.Thus the Arch
Creator--that Being of the Supreme Artistic Consciousness--is able to
peer into segregated interiors at His own discretion and watch the
plot thicken and the drama develop.Eleanor, who often visualized this
proceeding, always imagined a huge finger projecting into space,
cautiously tilting the roofs of the Houses of Man to allow the sweep
of the Invisible Glance.Granting the hypothesis of the Divine privilege, and assuming for the
purposes of this narrative the Omniscient focus on the characters most
concerned in it, let us for the time being look over the shoulder of
God and inform ourselves of their various occupations and
preoccupations of a Saturday afternoon in late June during the hour
before dinner.Eleanor, in her little white chamber on Thirtieth Street, was engaged
in making a pink and green toothbrush case for a going-away gift for
her Uncle Peter.To be sure she was going away with him when he
started for the Long Island beach hotel from which he proposed to
return every day to his office in the city, but she felt that a slight
token of her affection would be fitting and proper on the eve of their
joint departure.She was hurrying to get it done that she might steal
softly into the dining-room and put it on his plate undetected.Her
eyes were very wide, her brow intent and serious, and her delicate
lips lightly parted.At that moment she bore a striking resemblance to
the Botticelli head in Beulah's drawing-room that she had so greatly
admired.Of all the people concerned in her history, she was the most
tranquilly occupied.Peter in the room beyond was packing his trunk and his suit-case.At
this precise stage of his proceedings he was trying to make two
decisions, equally difficult, but concerned with widely different
departments of his consciousness.He was gravely considering whether
or not to include among his effects the photograph before him on the
dressing-table--that of the girl to whom he had been engaged from the
time he was a Princeton sophomore until her death four years
later--and also whether or not it would be worth his while to order a
new suit of white flannels so late in the season.The fact that he
finally decided against the photograph and in favor of the white
flannels has nothing to do with the relative importance of the two
matters thus engrossing him.The health of the human mind depends
largely on its ability to assemble its irrelevant and incongruous
problems in dignified yet informal proximity.When he went to his desk
it was with the double intention of addressing a letter to his tailor,
and locking the cherished photograph in a drawer; but, the letter
finished, he still held the picture in his hand and gazed down at it
mutely and when the discreet knock on his door that constituted the
announcing of dinner came, he was still sitting motionless with the
photograph propped up before him.Up-town, Beulah, whose dinner hour came late, was rather more
actively, though possibly not more significantly, occupied.She was
doing her best to evade the wild onslaught of a young man in glasses
who had been wanting to marry her for a considerable period, and had
now broken all bounds in a cumulative attempt to inform her of the
fact.Though he was assuredly in no condition to listen to reason, Beulah
was reasoning with him, kindly and philosophically, paying earnest
attention to the style and structure of her remarks as she did so.Her
emotions, as is usual on such occasions, were decidedly mixed.She was
conscious of a very real dismay at her unresponsiveness, a distress
for the acute pain from which the distraught young man seemed to be
suffering, and the thrill, which had she only known it, is the
unfailing accompaniment to the first eligible proposal of marriage.In
the back of her brain there was also, so strangely is the human mind
constituted, a kind of relief at being able to use mature logic once
more, instead of the dilute form of moral dissertation with which she
tried to adapt herself to Eleanor's understanding."I never intend to marry any one," she was explaining gently."I not
only never intend to, but I am pledged in a way that I consider
irrevocably binding never to marry,"--and that was the text from which
all the rest of her discourse developed.Jimmie, equally bound by the oath of celibacy, but not equally
constrained by it apparently, was at the very moment when Beulah was
so successfully repulsing the familiarity of the high cheek-boned
young man in the black and white striped tie, occupied in encouraging
a familiarity of a like nature.That is, he was holding the hand of a
young woman in the darkened corner of a drawing-room which had been
entirely unfamiliar to him ten days before, and was about to impress a
caress on lips that seemed to be ready to meet his with a certain
degree of accustomed responsiveness.That this was not a peculiarly
significant incident in Jimmie's career might have been difficult to
explain, at least to the feminine portion of the group of friends he
cared most for.Margaret, dressed for an academic dinner party, in white net with a
girdle of pale pink and lavender ribbons, had flung herself face
downward on her bed in reckless disregard of her finery; and because
it was hot and she was homesick for green fields and the cool
stretches of dim wooded country, had transported herself in fancy and
still in her recumbent attitude to the floor of a canoe that was
drifting down-stream between lush banks of meadow grass studded with
marsh lilies.After some interval--and shift of position--the way was
arched overhead with whispering trees, the stars came out one by one,
showing faintly between waving branches; and she perceived dimly that
a figure that was vaguely compounded of David and Peter and the
handsomest of all the young kings of Spain, had quietly taken its
place in the bow and had busied itself with the paddles,--whereupon
she was summoned to dinner, where the ten Hutchinsons and their guests
were awaiting her.David, the only member of the group whose summer vacation had actually
begun, was sitting on the broad veranda of an exclusive country club
several hundreds of miles away from New York and looking soberly into
the eyes of a blue ribbon bull dog, whose heavy jowl rested on his
knees.His mother, in one of the most fashionable versions of the
season's foulards, sleekly corseted and coifed, was sitting less than
a hundred yards away from him, fanning herself with three inches of
hand woven fan and contemplating David.In the dressing-room above,
just alighted from a limousine de luxe, was a raven-haired,
crafty-eyed ingenue (whose presence David did not suspect or he would
have recollected a sudden pressing engagement out of her vicinity),
preening herself for conquest.David's mind, unlike the minds of the
"other gifted members of the We Are Seven Club," to quote Jimmie's
most frequent way of referring to them, was to all intents and
purposes a total blank.He answered monosyllabically his mother's
questions, patted the dog's beetling forehead and thought of nothing
at all for practically forty-five minutes.Then he rose, and offering
his arm to his mother led her gravely to the table reserved for him in
the dining-room.Gertrude, in her studio at the top of the house in Fifty-sixth Street
where she lived with her parents, was putting the finishing touches on
a faun's head; and a little because she had unconsciously used
Jimmie's head for her model, and a little because of her conscious
realization at this moment that the roughly indicated curls over the
brow were like nobody's in the world but Jimmie's, she was thinking of
him seriously.She was thinking also of the dinner on a tray that
would presently be brought up to her, since her mother and father were
out of town, and of her coming two months with Eleanor and her recent
inspiration concerning them.In Colhassett, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the dinner hour and even the
supper hour were long past.In the commodious kitchen of Eleanor's
former home two old people were sitting in calico valanced rockers,
one by either window.The house was a pleasant old colonial structure,
now badly run down but still marked with that distinction that only
the instincts of aristocracy can bestow upon a decaying habitation.A fattish child made her way up the walk, toeing out unnecessarily,
and let herself in by the back door without knocking.Amos," she said, seating herself in a
straight backed, yellow chair, and swinging her crossed foot
nonchalantly, "I thought I would come in to inquire about Eleanor.Ma
said that she heard that she was coming home to live again.Albertina was not a peculiar favorite of Eleanor's grandfather.Amos
Chase had ideas of his own about the proper bringing up of children,
and the respect due from them to their elders.Also Albertina's father
had come from "poor stock."There was a strain of bad blood in her.The women of the Weston families hadn't always "behaved themselves."He therefore answered this representative of the youngest generation
rather shortly."I don't know nothing about it," he said."Why, father," the querulous old voice of Grandmother Chase protested,
"you know she's comin' home somewhere 'bout the end of July, she and
one of her new aunties and a hired girl they're bringing along to do
the work.I don't see why you can't answer the child's question.""I don't know as I'm obligated to answer any questions that anybody
sees fit to put to me."Albertina, pass me my glasses from off the
mantel-tree-shelf, and that letter sticking out from behind the clock
and I'll read what she says."Albertina, with a reproachful look at Mr.Amos, who retired coughing
exasperatedly behind a paper that he did not read, allowed herself to
be informed through the medium of a letter from Gertrude and a
postscript from Eleanor of the projected invasion of the Chase
household."I should think you'd rather have Eleanor come home by herself than
bringing a strange woman and a hired girl," Albertina contributed a
trifle tartly.The distinction of a hired girl in the family was one
which she had long craved on her own account."All nonsense, I call it," the old man ejaculated."Well, Eleena, she writes that she can't get away without one of 'em
comin' along with her and I guess we can manage someways.I dunno what
work city help will make in this kitchen.You can't expect much from
city help.I shall certainly be
dretful pleased to see Eleena, and so will her grandpa--in spite o'
the way he goes on about it."A snort came from the region of the newspaper."I shouldn't think you'd feel as if you had a grandchild now that six
rich people has adopted her," Albertina suggested helpfully."It's a good thing for the child," her grandmother said."I'm so lame
I couldn't do my duty by her.Old folks is old folks, and they can't
do for others like young ones.I'd d'ruther have had her adopted by
one father and mother instead o' this passel o' young folks passing
her around among themselves, but you can't have what you'd d'ruther
have in this world.You got to take what comes and be thankful.""Did she write you about having gold coffee spoons at her last place?""I think they was probably gilded over like ice-cream
spoons, and she didn't know the difference.I guess she has got a lot
of new clothes.Well, I'll have to be getting along.At the precise moment that the door closed behind Albertina, the clock
in Peter Stuyvesant's apartment in New York struck seven and Eleanor,
in a fresh white dress and blue ribbons, slipped into her chair at the
dinner table and waited with eyes blazing with excitement for Peter to
make the momentous discovery of the gift at his plate.CHAPTER XI

GERTRUDE HAS TROUBLE WITH HER BEHAVIOR


"Dear Uncle Peter," Eleanor wrote from Colhassett when she had been
established there under the new regime for a week or more.I am very awfully sorry, but I could not help it.Don't tell Aunt Margaret because it is so contrary to her teachings
and also the golden rule, but she was more contrary to the golden rule
that I was.She said
Aunt Gertrude was homely and an old maid, and the hired girl was
homely too.Well, I think she is, but I am not going to have Albertina
think so.Sandra went to the kitchen.Aunt Gertrude is pretty with those big eyes and ink like
hair and lovely teeth and one dimple.Albertina likes hair fuzzed all
over faces and blonds.Then she said she guessed I wasn't your
favorite, and that the gold spoons were most likely tin gilded over.I
don't know what you think about slapping.Will you please write and
say what you think?You know I am anxsuch to do well.But I think I
know as much as Albertina about some things.She uster treat me like a
dog, but it is most a year now since I saw her before."Well, here we are, Aunt Gertrude and me, too.Grandpa did not like
her at first.She looked so much like summer folks, and acted that
way, too.He does not agree with summer folks, but she got him talking
about foreign parts and that Spanish girl that made eyes at him, and
nearly got him away from Grandma, and the time they were wrecked going
around the horn, and showing her dishes and carvings from China.Grandma likes her
too, but not when Grandpa tells her about that girl in Spain."We eat in the dining-room, and have lovely food, only Grandpa does
not like it, but we have him a pie now for breakfast,--his own pie
that he can eat from all the time and he feels better.Aunt Gertrude
is happy seeing him eat it for breakfast and claps her hands when he
does it, only he doesn't see her."She is teaching me more manners, and to swim, and some French.It is
vacation and I don't have regular lessons, the way I did while we
were on Long Island."Didn't we have a good time in that hotel?Do you remember the night I
stayed up till ten o'clock and we sat on the beach and talked?I would miss you more if I believed what Albertina said about my
not being your favorite.Uncle Jimmie is coming and then I
don't know what Albertina will say.Aunt Gertrude's idea of getting me cultivated is
to read to me from the great Masters of literature and funny books
too, like Mark Twain and the Nonsense Thology.Then I say what I think
of them, and she just lets me develop along those lines, which is
pretty good for summer."The sun and wind are on the sea,
                  The waves are clear and blue,
                This is the place I like to be,
                  If I could just have you."The insects chirrup in the grass,
                  The birds sing in the tree,
                And oh!how quick the time would pass
                  If you were here with me.""What do you think of slapping, Aunt Gertrude?"Eleanor asked one
evening when they were walking along the hard beach that the receding
tide had left cool and firm for their pathway, and the early moon had
illumined for them."Do you think it's awfully bad to slap any one?""I wouldn't slap you, if that's what you mean, Eleanor.""Would you slap somebody your own size and a little bigger?""I thought perhaps you would," Eleanor sighed with a gasp of relieved
satisfaction."I don't believe in moral suasion entirely, Eleanor," Gertrude tried
to follow Eleanor's leads, until she had in some way satisfied the
child's need for enlightenment on the subject under discussion.It was
not always simple to discover just what Eleanor wanted to know, but
Gertrude had come to believe that there was always some excellent
reason for her wanting to know it."I think there are some quarrels
that have to be settled by physical violence.""I want to bring
myself up good when--when all of my aunts and uncles are too busy, or
don't know.I want to grow up, and be ladylike and a credit, and I'm
getting such good culture that I think I ought to, but--I get worried
about my refinement.City refinement is different from country
refinement.""Refinement isn't a thing that you can worry about," Gertrude began
slowly.She realized perhaps better than any of the others, being a
better balanced, healthier creature than either Beulah or Margaret,
that there were serious defects in the scheme of cooperative
parentage.Eleanor, thanks to the overconscientious digging about her
roots, was acquiring a New England self-consciousness about her
processes.A child, Gertrude felt, should be handed a code ready made
and should be guided by it without question until his maturer
experience led him to modify it.The trouble with trying to explain
this to Eleanor was that she had already had too many things
explained to her, and the doctrine of unselfconsciousness can not be
inculcated by an exploitation of it."If you are naturally a fine
person your instinct will be to do the fine thing.You must follow it
when you feel the instinct and not think about it between times.""That's Uncle Peter's idea," Eleanor said, "that not thinking.Well,
I'll try--but you and Uncle Peter didn't have six different parents
and a Grandpa and Grandma and Albertina all criticizing your
refinement in different ways.Don't you ever have any trouble with
your behavior, Aunt Gertrude?"The truth was that she was having considerable
trouble with her behavior since Jimmie's arrival two days before.She
had thought to spend her two months with Eleanor on Cape Cod helping
the child to relate her new environment to her old, while she had the
benefit of her native air and the freedom of a rural summer.She also
felt that one of their number ought to have a working knowledge of
Eleanor's early surroundings and habits.She had meant to put herself
and her own concerns entirely aside.If she had a thought for any one
but Eleanor she meant it to be for the two old people whose guest she
had constituted herself.She explained all this to Jimmie a day or two
before her departure, and to her surprise he had suggested that he
spend his own two vacation weeks watching the progress of her
experiment.Before she was quite sure of the wisdom of allowing him to
do so she had given him permission to come.Jimmie was part of her
trouble.Her craving for isolation and undiscovered country; her
eagerness to escape with her charge to some spot where she would not
be subjected to any sort of familiar surveillance, were all a part of
an instinct to segregate herself long enough to work out the problem
of Jimmie and decide what to do about it.This she realized as soon as
he arrived on the spot.She realized further that she had made
practically no progress in the matter, for this curly headed young
man, bearing no relation to anything that Gertrude had decided a young
man should be, was rapidly becoming a serious menace to her peace of
mind, and her ideal of a future lived for art alone.She had
definitely begun to realize this on the night when Jimmie, in his
exuberance at securing his new job, had seized her about the waist and
kissed her on the lips.She had thought a good deal about that kiss,
which came dangerously near being her first one.She was too clever,
too cool and aloof, to have had many tentative love-affairs.Later, as
she softened and warmed and gathered grace with the years she was
likely to seem more alluring and approachable to the gregarious male.Now she answered her small interlocutor truthfully."Yes, Eleanor, I do have a whole lot of trouble with my behavior.I'm
having trouble with it today, and this evening," she glanced up at the
moon, which was seemingly throwing out conscious waves of effulgence,
"I expect to have more," she confessed.asked Eleanor, "I'm sorry I can't sit up with you then
and help you.You--you don't expect to be--provocated to _slap_
anybody, do you?""No, I don't, but as things are going I almost wish I did," Gertrude
answered, not realizing that before the evening was over there would
be one person whom she would be ruefully willing to slap several times
over.As they turned into the village street from the beach road they met
Jimmie, who had been having his after-dinner pipe with Grandfather
Amos, with whom he had become a prime favorite.With him was
Albertina, toeing out more than ever and conversing more than
blandly."This virtuous child has been urging me to come after Eleanor and
remind her that it is bedtime," Jimmie said, indicating the pink
gingham clad figure at his side."She argues that Eleanor is some six
months younger than she and ought to be in bed first, and personally
she has got to go in the next fifteen minutes.""It's pretty hot weather to go to bed in," Albertina said."Miss
Sturgis, if I can get my mother to let me stay up half an hour more,
will you let Eleanor stay up?"Just beyond her friend, in the shadow of her ample back, Eleanor was
making gestures intended to convey the fact that sitting up any longer
was abhorrent to her."Eleanor needs her sleep to-night, I think," Gertrude answered,
professionally maternal."I brought Albertina so that our child might go home under convoy,
while you and I were walking on the beach," Jimmie suggested.As the two little girls fell into step, the beginning of their
conversation drifted back to the other two, who stood watching them
for a moment."I thought I'd come over to see if you was willing to say you were
sorry," Albertina began."My face stayed red in one spot for two hours
that day after you slapped me.""I'm not sorry," Eleanor said ungraciously, "but I'll say that I am,
if you've come to make up.""Well, we won't say any more about it then," Albertina conceded."Are
Miss Sturgis and Mr.Sears going together, or are they just friends?""Isn't that Albertina one the limit?"Jimmie inquired, with a piloting
hand under Gertrude's elbow."She told me that she and Eleanor were
mad, but she didn't want to stay mad because there was more going on
over here than there was at her house and she liked to come over.""I'm glad Eleanor slapped her," Gertrude said; "still I'm sorry our
little girl has uncovered the clay feet of her idol.She's through
with Albertina for good.""Do you know, Gertrude," Jimmy said, as they set foot on the
glimmering beach, "you don't seem a bit natural lately.You used to be
so full of the everlasting mischief.Every time you opened your mouth
I dodged for fear of being spiked.Yet here you are just as docile as
other folks.""Don't you like me--as well?"Gertrude tried her best to make her
voice sound as usual."Better," Jimmie swore promptly; then he added a qualifying--"I
guess."But she didn't allow him the opportunity to answer."I'm in a transition period, Jimmie," she said."I meant to be such a
good parent to Eleanor and correct all the evil ways into which she
has fallen as a result of all her other injudicious training, and,
instead of that, I'm doing nothing but think of myself and my own
hankerings and yearnings and such.I thought I could do so much for
the child.""That's the way we all think till we tackle her and then we find it
quite otherwise and even more so.Tell me about your hankerings and
yearnings.""Tell me about your job, Jimmie."And for a little while they found themselves on safe and familiar
ground again.Jimmie's new position was a very satisfactory one.He
found himself associated with men of solidity and discernment, and for
the first time in his business career he felt himself appreciated and
stimulated by that appreciation to do his not inconsiderable best.Gertrude was the one woman--Eleanor had not yet attained the inches
for that classification--to whom he ever talked business."Now, at last, I feel that I've got my feet on the earth, Gertrude; as
if the stuff that was in me had a chance to show itself, and you don't
know what a good feeling that is after you've been marked trash by
your family and thrown into the dust heap.""I know you are, 'Trude.It isn't
everybody I'd talk to like this.John went to the office.The moonlight beat down upon them in floods of sentient palpitating
glory.Little breathy waves sought the shore and whispered to it.The
pines on the breast of the bank stirred softly and tenderly."Lord, what a night," Jimmie said, and began burying her little white
hand in the beach sand."Now
tell me about your job," he said."I don't think I want to talk about my job tonight."There was no question about her voice sounding as
usual this time.Jimmie brushed the sand slowly away from the buried hand and covered
it with his own.He drew nearer, his face close, and closer to hers.It was coming, it was coming and she was
glad.That silly old vow of celibacy, her silly old thoughts about
art.What was anything with the arms of the man you
loved closing about you.Jimmie drew a sharp breath, and let her go."Gertrude," he said, "I'm incorrigible.I'd
make love to--Eleanor's grandmother if I had her down here on a night
like this.Gertrude got to her feet a little unsteadily, but she managed a
smile."It's only the moon," she said, "and--and young blood.I think
Grandfather Amos would probably affect me the same way."Jimmie's momentary expression of blankness passed and Gertrude did not
press her advantage."It's awfully companionable to realize that you also are human,
'Trude," he hazarded on the doorstep.Gertrude put a still hand into his, which is a way of saying "Good
night," that may be more formal than any other."The Colonel's lady, and July O'Grady," she quoted lightly.Up-stairs in her great chamber under the eaves, Eleanor was composing
a poem which she copied carefully on a light blue page of her private
diary.It read as follows:

                "To love, it is the saddest thing,
                  When friendship proves unfit,
                For lots of sadness it will bring,
                  When e'er you think of it.that friends should prove untrue
                  And disappoint you so.Because you don't know what to do,
                  And hardly where to go."CHAPTER XII

MADAM BOLLING


"Is this the child, David?"Eleanor stared impassively into the lenses of Mrs.Eleanor courtesied as her Uncle Jimmie had taught her, but she did not
take her eyes from Mrs.I hate this American fashion of dressing
children like French dolls, in bright colors and smart lines.An English country child would have
cheeks as red as apples."I should have thought her younger, David.I'll teach her the ropes when the strangeness
begins to wear off.This kind of thing is all new to her, you know."Give her the blue chamber and tell Mademoiselle to
take charge of her.You say you want her to have lessons for so many
hours a day.She writes verses, she models pretty well,
Gertrude says.It's too soon to expect any special aptitude to
develop.""Well, I'm glad to discover your philanthropic tendencies, David.I
never knew you had any before, but this seems to me a very doubtful
undertaking.You take a child like this from very plain surroundings
and give her a year or two of life among cultivated and well-to-do
people, just enough for her to acquire a taste for extravagant living
and associations.You get tired of your
bargain.You marry--and then what
becomes of your protegee?She goes back to the country, a thoroughly
unsatisfied little rustic, quite unfitted to be the wife of the farmer
for whom fate intended her.""I wish you wouldn't, mother," David said, with an uneasy glance at
Eleanor's pale face, set in the stoic lines he remembered so well from
the afternoon of his first impression of her.It never hurts anybody to have a plain understanding of his
position in the world.I don't know what foolishness you romantic
young people may have filled her head with.It's just as well she
should hear common sense from me and I intend that she shall.""I've explained to you, mother, that this child is my legal and moral
responsibility and will be partly at least under my care until she
becomes of age.I want her to be treated as you'd treat a child of
mine if I had one.If you don't, I can't have her visit us again.I
shall take her away with me somewhere.Bringing her home to you this
time is only an experiment.""She'll have a much more healthful and normal experience with us than
she's had with any of the rest of your violent young set, I'll be
bound.She can look out for Zaidee--I
never say that name without irritation--but it's the only name the
little beast will answer to.Eleanor started at the suddenness of the question, but did not reply
to it.Bolling waited and David looked at her expectantly."My mother asked you if you liked dogs, Eleanor; didn't you
understand?"Eleanor opened her lips as if to speak and then shut them again
firmly."Your protegee is slightly deaf, David," his mother assured him."You can tell her 'yes,'" Eleanor said unexpectedly to David."I like
dogs, if they ain't treacherous.""She asked you the question," David said gravely; "this is her house,
you know."Why can't I talk to you about her, the way she does about me?""She can have consideration if she wants it, but she
doesn't think I'm any account.Let her ask you what she wants and I'll
tell you.""Eleanor," David remonstrated, "Eleanor, you never behaved like this
before.I don't know what's got into her, mother."Eleanor fixed her big blue eyes on the lorgnette again."If it's manners to talk the way you do to your own children and
strange little girls, why, then I don't want any," she said."I guess
I'll be going," she added abruptly and turned toward the door.David took her by the shoulders and brought her right about face."Say good-by to mother," he said sternly."Good-by, ma'am--madam," Eleanor said and courtesied primly."Tell Mademoiselle to teach her a few things before the next audience,
David, and come back to me in fifteen minutes.I have something
important to talk over with you."David stood by the open door of the blue chamber half an hour later
and watched Eleanor on her knees, repacking her suit-case.Her face
was set in pale determined lines, and she looked older and a little
sick.Outside it was blowing a September gale, and the trees were
waving desperate branches in the wind.David had thought that the
estate on the Hudson would appeal to the little girl.It had always
appealed to him so much, even though his mother's habits of migration
with the others of her flock at the different seasons had left him so
comparatively few associations with it.He had thought she would like
the broad sweeping lawns and the cherubim fountain, the apple orchard
and the kitchen garden, and the funny old bronze dog at the end of the
box hedge.When he saw how she was occupied, he understood that it was
not her intention to stay and explore these things."Eleanor," he said, stepping into the room suddenly, "what are you
doing with your suit-case?Didn't Mademoiselle unpack it for you?"He
was close enough now to see the signs of tears she had shed.Her eyes fell and she tried desperately to control a quivering lip."Because I am--I want to go back.""I ain't wanted," she said, her head low."I made up my mind to go
back to my own folks.I'm not going to be adopted any more."David led her to the deep window-seat and made her sit facing him.He
was too wise to attempt a caress with this issue between them."Do you think that's altogether fair to me?""I guess it won't make much difference to you."Do you think it will be fair to your other aunts and uncles who have
given so much care and thought to your welfare?""If they do get tired of their bargain it will be because they've
turned out to be very poor sports.I've known every one of them a long
time, and I've never known them to show any signs of poor
sportsmanship yet.If you run away without giving them their chance to
make good, it will be you who are the poor sport.""She said you would marry and get tired of me, and I would have to go
back to the country.If you marry and Uncle Jimmie marries--then Uncle
Peter will marry, and--"

"You'd still have your Aunts Beulah and Margaret and Gertrude," David
could not resist making the suggestion.If one person broke up the vow, I guess they
all would."But even if we did, Eleanor, even if we all married, we'd still
regard you as our own, our child, our charge."The tears came now, and David gathered the
little shaking figure to his breast."I don't want to be the wife of
the farmer for whom fate intended me," she sobbed."I want to marry
somebody refined with extravagant living and associations.""That's one of the things we are bringing you up for, my dear."This
aspect of the case occurred to David for the first time, but he
realized its potency."You mustn't take mother too seriously.Just
jolly her along a little and you'll soon get to be famous friends.She's never had any little girls of her own, only my brother and me,
and she doesn't know quite how to talk to them.""The Hutchinsons had a hired butler and gold spoons, and they didn't
think I was the dust beneath their feet.I don't know what to say to
her.I said ain't, and I wasn't refined, and I'll only just be a
disgrace to you.I'd rather go back to Cape Cod, and go out to work,
and stand Albertina and everything.""If you think it's the square thing to do," David said slowly, "you
may go, Eleanor.I'll take you to New York to-morrow and get one of
the girls to take you to Colhassett.Of course, if you do that it will
put me in rather an awkward position.The others have all had you for
two months and made good on the proposition.I shall have to admit
that I couldn't even keep you with me twenty-four hours.Peter and
Jimmie got along all right, but I couldn't handle you at all.As a
cooperative parent, I'm such a failure that the whole experiment goes
to pieces through me.""Well, it's the same thing,--you couldn't stand the surroundings I
brought you to.You couldn't even be polite to my mother for my
sake.""I--never thought of that, Uncle David.""Think of it now for a few minutes, won't you, Eleanor?"The rain was beginning to lash the windows, and to sweep the lawn in
long slant strokes.The little girl held up her face as if it could
beat through the panes on it."I thought," she said slowly, "that after Albertina I wouldn't _take_
anything from anybody.Uncle Peter says that I'm just as good as
anybody, even if I have been out to work.He said that all I had to do
was just to stand up to people.""There are a good many different ways of standing up to people,
Eleanor.Be sure you've got the right way and then go ahead.""I guess I ought to have been politer," Eleanor said slowly."I ought
to have thought that she was your own mother.You couldn't help the
way she acted, o' course.""The way you acted is the point, Eleanor.""I'll act different if you want me to, Uncle David," she said, "and I
won't go and leave you."I don't think that I altogether cover myself
with glory in an interview with my mother," he added."It isn't the
thing that I'm best at, I admit.""You did pretty good," Eleanor consoled him."I guess she makes you
kind of bashful the way she does me," from which David gathered with
an odd sense of shock that Eleanor felt there was something to
criticize in his conduct, if she had permitted herself to look for
it."I know what I'll do," Eleanor decided dreamily with her nose against
the pane."I'll just pretend that she's Mrs.O'Farrel's aunt, and then
whatever she does, I shan't care.I'll know that I'm the strongest and
could hit her if I had a mind to, and then I shan't want to.""By the time you grow up, Eleanor," he said finally, "you will have
developed all your cooperative parents into fine strong characters.*       *       *       *       *

"The dog got nearly drownded today in the founting," Eleanor wrote."It is a very little dog about the size of Gwendolyn.It was out with
Mademoiselle, and so was I, learning French on a garden seat.It
teetered around on the edge of the big wash basin--the founting looks
like a wash basin, and suddenly it fell in.I waded right in and got
it, but it slipped around so I couldn't get it right away.It looked
almost too dead to come to again, but I gave it first aid to the
drownded the way Uncle Jimmie taught me to practicing on Gwendolyn.When I got it fixed I looked up and saw Uncle David's mother coming.I
took the dog and gave it to her.I said, 'Madam, here's your dog.'Mademoiselle ran around ringing her hands and talking about it.Bolling's room, and we talked.I told her how to make
mustard pickles, and how my mother's grandpa's relation came over in
the Mayflower, and about our single white lilac bush, and she's going
to get one and make the pickles.Then I played double Canfield with
her for a while.I'm glad I didn't go home before I knew her better.O'Farrel's aunt I pretend she is her, and we
don't quarrel.She says does Uncle David go much to see Aunt Beulah,
and I say, not so often as Uncle Jimmie does.Then she says does he go
to see Aunt Margaret, and I say that he goes to see Uncle Peter the
most.Well, if he doesn't he almost does.Madam
Bolling that you won't tattle, because she would think the worst."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor grew to like Mademoiselle.She was the aging, rather wry
faced Frenchwoman who had been David's young brother's governess and
had made herself so useful to Mrs.Bolling that she was kept always on
the place, half companion and half resident housekeeper.She was glad
to have a child in charge again, and Eleanor soon found that her
crooked features and severe high-shouldered back that had somewhat
intimidated her at first, actually belonged to one of the kindest
hearted creatures in the world.Paris and Colhassett bore very little resemblance to each other, the
two discovered.To be sure there were red geraniums every alternating
year in the gardens of the Louvre, and every year in front of the
Sunshine Library in Colhassett.The residents of both places did a
great deal of driving in fine weather.In Colhassett they drove on the
state highway, recently macadamized to the dismay of the taxpayers who
did not own horses or automobiles.In Paris they drove out to the Bois
by way of the Champs Elysees.In Colhassett they had only one
ice-cream saloon, but in Paris they had a good many of them
out-of-doors in the parks and even on the sidewalk, and there you
could buy all kinds of sirups and 'what you call cordials' and
_aperitifs_; but the two places on the whole were quite different.The people of Colhassett were all
religious and thought it was sinful to play cards on Sundays.Mademoiselle said she always felt wicked when she played them on a
week day."I think of my mother," she said; "she would say 'Juliette, what will
you say to the Lord when he knows that you have been playing cards on
a working day."The Lord that they have in Colhassett is not like that," Eleanor
stated without conscious irreverence."She is a vary fonny child, madam," Mademoiselle answered Mrs."She has taste, but no--experience even of the most
ordinary.She cooks, but she does no embroidery.She knits and knows
no games to play.She has a good brain, but Mon Dieu, no one has
taught her to ask questions with it.""She has had lessons this year from some young Rogers graduates, very
intelligent girls.I should think a year of that kind of training
would have had its effect."Bolling's finger went into every pie
in her vicinity with unfailing direction."Lessons, yes, but no teaching.If she were not vary intelligent I
think she would have suffered for it.The public schools they did
somesing, but so little to elevate--to encourage."Thus in a breath were Beulah's efforts as an educator disposed of."Would you like to undertake the teaching of that child for a year?""I think I'll make the offer to David."Bolling was unsympathetic but she was thorough.Since David and his young friends had undertaken
a venture so absurd, she decided to lend them a helping hand with it.Besides, now that she had no children of her own in the house,
Mademoiselle was practically eating her head off.Also it had
developed that David was fond of the child, so fond of her that to
oppose that affection would have been bad policy, and Mrs.Bolling was
politic when she chose to be.She chose to be politic now, for
sometime during the season she was going to ask a very great favor of
David, and she hoped, that by first being extraordinarily complaisant
and kind and then by bringing considerable pressure to bear upon him,
he would finally do what he was asked.The favor was to provide
himself with a father-in-law, and that father-in-law the
multi-millionaire parent of the raven-haired, crafty-eyed ingenue, who
had begun angling for him that June night at the country club.She made the suggestion to David on the eve of the arrival of all of
Eleanor's guardians for the week-end.Bolling had invited a
house-party comprised of the associated parents as a part of her
policy of kindness before the actual summoning of her forces for the
campaign she was about to inaugurate.David was really touched by his mother's generosity concerning
Eleanor.He had been agreeably surprised at the development of the
situation between the child and his mother.He had been obliged to go
into town the day after Eleanor's first unfortunate encounter with her
hostess, and had hurried home in fear and trembling to try to smooth
out any tangles in the skein of their relationship that might have
resulted from a day in each other's vicinity.After hurrying over the
house and through the grounds in search of her he finally discovered
the child companionably currying a damp and afflicted Pekinese in his
mother's sitting-room, and engaged in a grave discussion of the
relative merits of molasses and sugar as a sweetening for Boston baked
beans.It was while they were having their after-dinner coffee in the
library, for which Eleanor had been allowed to come down, though
nursery supper was the order of the day in the Bolling establishment,
that David told his friends of his mother's offer."Of course, we decided to send her to school when she was twelve
anyway," he said."The idea was to keep her among ourselves for two
years to establish the parental tie, or ties I should say.If she is
quartered here with Mademoiselle we could still keep in touch with her
and she would be having the advantage of a year's steady tuition under
one person, and we'd be relieved--" a warning glance from Margaret,
with an almost imperceptible inclination of her head in the direction
of Beulah, caused him to modify the end of his sentence--"of the
responsibility--for her physical welfare.""Mentally and morally," Gertrude cut in, "the bunch would still
supervise her entirely."Jimmie, who was sitting beside her, ran his arm along the back of her
chair affectionately, and then thought better of it and drew it away.He was, for some unaccountable reason, feeling awkward and not like
himself.There was a girl in New York, with whom he was not in the
least in love, who had recently taken it upon herself to demonstrate
unmistakably that she was not in love with him.There was another girl
who insisted on his writing her every day.Here was Gertrude, who
never had any time for him any more, absolutely without enthusiasm at
his proximity.He thought it would be a good idea to allow Eleanor to
remain where she was and said so."Not that I won't miss the jolly times we had together, Babe," he
said."I was planning some real rackets this year,--to make up for
what I put you through," he added in her ear, as she came and stood
beside him for a minute.Gertrude wanted to go abroad for a year, "and lick her wounds," as she
told herself.She would have come back for her two months with
Eleanor, but she was glad to be relieved of that necessity.Margaret
had the secret feeling that the ordeal of the Hutchinsons was one that
she would like to spare her foster child, and incidentally herself in
relation to the adjustment of conditions necessary to Eleanor's visit.Peter wanted her with him, but he believed the new arrangement would
be better for the child.Beulah alone held out for her rights and her
parental privileges.She stood in the center of the group a little forlornly while they
awaited her word.A wave of her old shyness overtook her and she
blushed hot and crimson."It's all in your own hands, dear," Beulah said briskly."Poor kiddie," Gertrude thought, "it's all wrong somehow.""I don't know what you want me to say," Eleanor said piteously and
sped to the haven of Peter's breast."We'll manage a month together anyway," Peter whispered."Then I guess I'll stay here," she whispered back, "because next I
would have to go to Aunt Beulah's."Peter, turning involuntarily in Beulah's direction, saw the look of
chagrin and disappointment on her face, and realized how much she
minded playing a losing part in the game and yet how well she was
doing it."She's only a straight-laced kid after all," he thought."She's put her whole heart and soul into this thing.There's a look
about the top part of her face when it's softened that's a little like
Ellen's."Ellen was his dead fiancee--the girl in the photograph at
home in his desk."I guess I'll stay here," Eleanor said aloud, "all in one place, and
study with Mademoiselle."It was a decision that, on the whole, she never regretted.CHAPTER XIII

BROOK AND RIVER


                   "Standing with reluctant feet,
                   Where the brook and river meet.""I think it's a good plan to put a quotation like Kipling at the top
of the page whenever I write anything in this diary," Eleanor began in
the smart leather bound book with her initials stamped in black on the
red cover--the new private diary that had been Peter's gift to her on
the occasion of her fifteenth birthday some months before."I think it
is a very expressive thing to do.The quotation above is one that
expresses me, and I think it is beautiful too.Miss Hadley--that's my
English teacher--the girls call her Haddock because she does look
rather like a fish--says that it's undoubtedly one of the most
poignant descriptions of adolescent womanhood ever made.I made a note
to look up adolescent, but didn't.Bertha Stephens has my dictionary,
and won't bring it back because the leaves are all stuck together
with fudge, and she thinks she ought to buy me a new one.It is very
honorable of her to feel that way, but she never will.Good old
Stevie, she's a great borrower."'Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
             For borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.'"Well, I hardly know where to begin.I thought I would make a resume
of some of the events of the last year.I was only fourteen then, but
still I did a great many things that might be of interest to me in my
declining years when I look back into the annals of this book.To
begin with I was only a freshie at Harmon.It is very different to be
a sophomore.I can hardly believe that I was once a shivering looking
little thing like all the freshmen that came in this year.I was very
frightened, but did not think I showed it.wad some power the giftie gie us,
               To see ourselves as others see us.'"Robert Burns had twins and a rather bad character, but after he met
his bonnie Jean he wrote very beautiful poetry.A poet's life is
usually sad anyhow--full of disappointment and pain--but I digress."I had two years with Mademoiselle at the Bollings' instead of one the
way we planned.I haven't written in my Private Diary since the night
of that momentous decision that I was to stay in one place instead of
taking turns visiting my cooperative parents.I went to another school
one year before I came to Harmon, and that brings me to the threshold
of my fourteenth year.If I try to go back any farther, I'll never
catch up.I spent that vacation with Aunt Margaret in a cottage on
Long Island with her sister, and her sister's boy, who has grown up to
be the silly kind that wants to kiss you and pull your hair, and those
things.Aunt Margaret is so lovely I can't think of words to express
it.rare pale Margaret,' as Tennyson says.She wears her hair in
a coronet braid around the top of her head, and all her clothes are
the color of violets or a soft dovey gray or white, though baby blue
looks nice on her especially when she wears a fishyou."I went down to Cape Cod for a week before I came to Harmon, and while
I was there my grandmother died.I can't write about that in this
diary.I loved my grandmother and my grandmother loved me.Uncle Peter
came, and took charge of everything.He has great strength that holds
you up in trouble."The first day I came to Harmon I saw the girl I wanted for my best
friend, and so we roomed together, and have done so ever since.Her
name is Margaret Louise Hodges, but she is called Maggie Lou by every
one.She has dark curly hair, and deep brown eyes, and a very silvery
voice.I have found out that she lies some, but she says it is because
she had such an unhappy childhood, and has promised to overcome it for
my sake."That Christmas vacation the 'We Are Sevens' went up the Hudson to the
Bollings' again, but that was the last time they ever went there.Uncle David and his mother had a terrible fight over them.I was sorry
for Madam Bolling in a way.There was a girl she wanted Uncle David to
marry, a rich girl who looked something like Cleopatra, very dark
complexioned with burning eyes.She had a sweet little Pekinese
something like Zaidee."Uncle David said that gold could never buy him, and to take her away,
but Madam Bolling was very angry, of course.She accused him of
wanting to marry Aunt Margaret, and called her a characterless, faded
blonde.Then it was Uncle David's turn to get angry, and I have never
seen any one get any angrier, and he told about the vow of celibacy,
and how instead of having designs on him the whole crowd would back
him up in his struggle to stay single.I told
Madam Bolling that I would help her to get Uncle David back, and I
did, but she never forgave the other aunts and uncles.I suppose the
feelings of a mother would prompt her to want Uncle David settled down
with a rich and fashionable girl who would soon be the mother of a lot
of lovely children.I can't imagine a Cleopatra looking baby, but she
might have boys that looked like Uncle David."Vacations are really about all there is to school.Freshman year is
mostly grinding and stuffing.Having six parents to send you boxes of
'grub' is better than having only two.Some of the girls are rather
selfish about the eats, and come in and help themselves boldly when
you are out of the room.Maggie Lou puts up signs over the candy box:
'Closed for Repairs,' or 'No Trespassing by Order of the Board of
Health,' but they don't pay much attention.Well, last summer vacation
I spent with Uncle Jimmie.I wouldn't tell this, but I reformed him.I don't know what pledge it was because I
didn't read it, but he said he was addicted to something worse than
anything I could think of, and if somebody didn't pull him up, he
wouldn't answer for the consequences.I asked him why he didn't choose
Aunt Gertrude to do it, and he groaned only.So I said to write out a
pledge, and sign it and I would be the witness.We were at a hotel
with his brother's family.It isn't proper any more for me to go
around with my uncles unless I have a chaperon.Mademoiselle says that
I oughtn't even to go down-town alone with them but, of course, that
is French etiquette, and not American.Well, there were lots of pretty
girls at this hotel, all wearing white and pink dresses, and carrying
big bell shaped parasols of bright colors.They looked sweet, like so
many flowers, but Uncle Jimmie just about hated the sight of them.He
said they were not girls at all, but just pink and white devices of
the devil.On the whole he didn't act much like my merry uncle, but we
had good times together playing tennis and golf, and going on parties
with his brother's family, all mere children but the mother and
father.Uncle Jimmie was afraid to go and get his mail all summer,
although he had a great many letters on blue and lavender note paper
scented with Roger et Gallet's violet, and Hudnut's carnation.We used
to go down to the beach and make bonfires and burn them unread, and
then toast marshmallows in their ashes.He said that they were
communications from the spirits of the dead.I should have thought
that they were from different girls, but he seemed to hate the sight
of girls so much.Once I asked him if he had ever had an unhappy
love-affair, just to see what he would say, but he replied 'no, they
had all been happy ones,' and groaned and groaned."Aunt Beulah has changed too.She has become a suffragette and thinks
only of getting women their rights and their privileges."Maggie Lou is an anti, and we have long arguments about the cause.She says that woman's place is in the home, but I say look at me, who
have no home, how can I wash and bake and brew like the women of my
grandfather's day, visiting around the way I do?And she says that it
is the principle of the thing that is involved, and I ought to take a
stand for or against.Everybody has so many different arguments that I
don't know what I think yet, but some day I shall make up my mind for
good."Well, that about brings me up to the present.I meant to describe a
few things in detail, but I guess I will not begin on the past in that
way.I don't get so awfully much time to write in this diary because
of the many interruptions of school life, and the way the monitors
snoop in study hours.I don't know who I am going to spend my
Christmas holidays with.I sent Uncle Peter a poem three days ago, but
he has not answered it yet.I'm afraid he thought it was very silly.I
don't hardly know what it means myself.It goes as follows:

                              "A Song

                "The moon is very pale to-night,
                  The summer wind swings high,
                I seek the temple of delight,
                  And feel my love draw nigh."I seem to feel his fragrant breath
                  Upon my glowing cheek.Between us blows the wind of death,--
                  I shall not hear him speak."I don't know why I like to write love poems, but most of the women
poets did.CHAPTER XIV

MERRY CHRISTMAS


Margaret in mauve velvet and violets, and Gertrude in a frock of smart
black and white were in the act of meeting by appointment at Sherry's
one December afternoon, with a comfortable cup of tea in mind.Gertrude emerged from the recess of the revolving door and Margaret,
sitting eagerly by the entrance, almost upset the attendant in her
rush to her friend's side.Gertrude," she cried, "I'm so glad to see you.My family is
trying to cut me up in neat little quarters and send me north, south,
east and west, for the Christmas holidays, and I want to stay home and
have Eleanor.How did I ever come to be born into a family of giants,
tell me that, Gertrude?""The choice of parents is thrust upon us at an unfortunately immature
period, I'll admit," Gertrude laughed."My parents are dears, but
they've never forgiven me for being an artist instead of a dubby bud.Shall we have tea right away or shall we sit down and discuss life?""I don't know which is the hungrier--flesh or
spirit."But as they turned toward the dining-room a familiar figure blocked
their progress."I thought that was Gertrude's insatiable hat," David exclaimed
delightedly."I've phoned for you both until your families have given
instructions that I'm not to be indulged any more.I've got a surprise
for you.--Taxi," he said to the man at the door."Not till we've had our tea," Margaret wailed."You couldn't be so
cruel, David.""You shall have your tea, my dear, and one of the happiest surprises
of your life into the bargain," David assured her as he led the way to
the waiting cab."I wouldn't leave this place unfed for anybody but you, David, not if
it were ever so, and then some, as Jimmie says.""What's the matter with Jimmie, anyhow?"David inquired as the taxi
turned down the Avenue and immediately entangled itself in a hopeless
mesh of traffic.Gertrude answered, though she had not been the
one addressed at the moment.she
rattled on without waiting for an answer."I thought it was
good-looking myself, and Madam Paran robbed me for it.""It is good-looking," David allowed."It seems to be a kind of
retrieving hat, that's all.Keeps you in a rather constant state of
looking after the game."It's a lovely cross
between the style affected by the late Emperor Napoleon and my august
grandmother, with some frills added."The chauffeur turned into a cross street and stopped abruptly before
an imposing but apparently unguarded entrance."Why, I thought this was a studio building," Gertrude said."David, if
you're springing a tea party on us, and we in the wild ungovernable
state we are at present, I'll shoot the way my hat is pointing.""Straight through my left eye-glass," David finished."You wait till
you see the injustice you have done me."But Margaret, who often understood what was happening a few moments
before the revelation of it, clutched at his elbow.David, David," she whispered, "how wonderful!""Wait till you see," David said, and herded them into the elevator.David hurried them around
the bend in the sleekly carpeted corridor and touched the bell on the
right of the first door they came to.It opened almost instantly and
David's man, who was French, stood bowing and smiling on the
threshold.Styvvisont has arrive'," he said; "he waits you.""Welcome to our city," Peter cried, appearing in the doorway of the
room Alphonse was indicating with that high gesture of delight with
which only a Frenchman can lead the way."Jimmie's coming up from the
office and Beulah's due any minute.What do you think of the place,
girls?""It's really
ours, that's what it is.I've broken away from the mater at last," he
added a little sheepishly.I've got an
all-day desk job in my uncle's office and I'm going to dig in and see
what I can make of myself.Also, this is going to be our headquarters,
and Eleanor's permanent home if we're all agreed upon it,--but look
around, ladies.If you think I can interior
decorate, just tell me so frankly."It's like that old conundrum--black and white and red all over,"
Gertrude said."I never saw anything so stunning in all my life."I admire your nerve," Peter cried, "papering this place in
white, and then getting in all this heavy carved black stuff, and the
red in the tapestries and screens and pillows.""I wanted it to look studioish a little," David explained, "I wanted
to get away from Louis Quartorze.""And drawing-rooms like mother used to make," Gertrude suggested.Do you see, Margaret, everything is Indian
or Chinese?The ubiquitous Japanese print is conspicuous by its
absence.""I've got two portfolios full of 'em," David said, "and I always have
one or two up in the bedrooms.I change 'em around, you know, the way
the <DW61>s do themselves, a different scene every few days and the rest
decently out of sight till you're ready for 'em.""It's like a fairy story," Margaret said."I thought you'd appreciate what little Arabian Nights I was able to
introduce.I bought that screen," he indicated a sweep of Chinese line
and color, "with my eye on you, and that Aladdin's lamp is yours, of
course.You're to come in here and rub it whenever you like, and your
heart's desire will instantly be vouchsafed to you."Peter suggested, as David led the way through
the corridor and up the tiny stairs which led to the more intricate
part of the establishment."This is her room, didn't you say, David?"He paused on the threshold of a bedroom done in ivory white and
yellow, with all its hangings of a soft golden silk."She once said that she wanted a yellow room," David said, "a
daffy-down-dilly room, and I've tried to get her one.I know last
year that Maggie Lou child refused to have yellow curtains in that
flatiron shaped sitting-room of theirs, and Eleanor refused to be
comforted."A wild whoop in the below stairs announced Jimmie; and Beulah arrived
simultaneously with the tea tray.Jimmie was ecstatic when the actual
function of the place was explained to him."Headquarters is the one thing we've lacked," he said; "a place of our
own, hully gee!"You haven't been feeling altogether human lately, have you, Jimmie?""I'm a bad
egg," he explained to her darkly, "and the only thing you can do with
me is to scramble me.""Scrambled is just about the way I should have described your behavior
of late,--but that's Gertrude's line," David said."Only she doesn't
seem to be taking an active part in the conversation.Aren't you
Jimmie's keeper any more, Gertrude?""Not since she's come back from abroad," Jimmie muttered without
looking at her."Eleanor's taken the job over now," Peter said."She's made him swear
off red ink and red neckties.""Any color so long's it's red is the color that suits me best," Jimmie
quoted."Lord, isn't this room a pippin?"He swam in among the bright
pillows of the divan and so hid his face for a moment.It had been a
good many weeks since he had seen Gertrude."I want to give a suffrage tea here," Beulah broke in suddenly."It's
so central, but I don't suppose David would hear of it.""Angels and Ministers of Grace defend us--" Peter began."My _mother_ would hear of it," David said, "and then there wouldn't
be any little studio any more.She doesn't believe in votes for
women.""How any woman in this day and age--" Beulah began, and thought better
of it, since she was discussing Mrs."Makes your blood boil, doesn't it--Beulahland?"Gertrude suggested
helpfully, reaching for the tea cakes."Never mind, I'll vote for
women."The Lord helps those that help themselves," Peter said, "that's why
Gertrude is a suffragist.She believes in helping herself, in every
sense, don't you, 'Trude?""Not quite in every sense," Gertrude said gravely."Sometimes I feel
like that girl that Margaret describes as caught in a horrid way
between two generations."I'd rather be that way than early Victorian," Margaret sighed."Speaking of the latest generation, has anybody any objection to
having our child here for the holidays?""My idea is to
have one grand Christmas dinner.I suppose we'll all have to eat one
meal with our respective families, but can't we manage to get together
here for dinner at night?"We can't, but we will," Margaret murmured.I wanted her with me but the family thought otherwise.They've
been trying to send me away for my health, David."You'll stay in New York for your health and come
to my party.""Margaret's health is merely a matter of Margaret's happiness anyhow.Her soul and her body are all one," Gertrude said."Then cursed be he who brings anything but happiness to Margaret,"
Peter said, to which sentiment David added a solemn "Amen.""I wish you wouldn't," Margaret said, shivering a little, "I feel as
if some one were--were--"

"Trampling the violets on your grave," Gertrude finished for her.Christmas that year fell on a Monday, and Eleanor did not leave school
till the Friday before the great day.Owing to the exigencies of the
holiday season none of her guardians came to see her before the dinner
party itself.Even David was busy with his mother--installed now for a
few weeks in the hotel suite that would be her home until the opening
of the season at Palm Beach--and had only a few hurried words with
her.Mademoiselle, whom he had imported for the occasion, met her at
the station and helped her to do her modest shopping which consisted
chiefly of gifts for her beloved aunts and uncles.She had arranged
these things lovingly at their plates, and fled to dress when they
began to assemble for the celebration.The girls were the first
arrivals."I had a few minutes' talk
with her over the telephone and she seemed to be flourishing.""She's grown several feet since we last saw
her.They've been giving scenes from Shakespeare at school and she's
been playing Juliet, it appears.She has had a fight with another girl
about suffrage--I don't know which side she was on, Beulah, I am
merely giving you the facts as they came to me--and the other girl was
so unpleasant about it that she has been visited by just retribution
in the form of the mumps, and had to be sent home and quarantined.""Sounds a bit priggish," Peter suggested."Not really," David said, "she's as sound as a nut.She's only going
through the different stages.""To pass deliberately through one's ages," Beulah quoted, "is to get
the heart out of a liberal education.""Bravo, Beulah," Gertrude cried, "you're quite in your old form
to-night.""Is she just the same little girl, David?"I don't know why
she doesn't come down.No, it's only Alphonse
letting in Jimmie."Jimmie, whose spirits seemed to have revived under the holiday
influence, was staggering under the weight of his parcels.The
Christmas presents had already accumulated to a considerable mound on
the couch.Margaret was brooding over them and trying not to look
greedy.She was still very much of a child herself in relation to
Santa Claus.My eyes--but you're a slick trio, girls.Pale
lavender, pale blue, and pale pink, and all quite sophisticatedly
decollete.I don't know quite why
you do, but you do.""Give honor where honor is due, dearie.That's owing to the cleverness
of the decorator," David said."No man calls me dearie and lives to tell the tale," Jimmie remarked
almost dreamily as he squared off.But at that instant there was an unexpected interruption.Alphonse
threw open the big entrance door at the farther end of the long room
with a flourish."Mademoiselle Juliet Capulet," he proclaimed with the grand air, and
then retired behind his hand, smiling broadly.Framed in the high doorway, complete, cap and curls, softly rounding
bodice, and the long, straight lines of the Renaissance, stood
Juliet--Juliet, immemorial, immortal, young--austerely innocent and
delicately shy, already beautiful, and yet potential of all the beauty
and the wisdom of the world."I've never worn these clothes before anybody but the girls before,"
Eleanor said, "but I thought"--she looked about her appealingly--"you
might like it--for a surprise.""Great jumping Jehoshaphat," Jimmie exclaimed, "I thought you said she
was the same little girl, David.""She was half an hour ago," David answered, "I never saw such a
metamorphosis.In fact, I don't think I ever saw Juliet before.""She is the thing itself," Gertrude answered, the artist in her
sobered by the vision.But Peter passed a dazed hand over his eyes and stared at the delicate
figure advancing to him.she's a woman," he said, and drew the hard breath of a man
just awakened from sleep.[Illustration: "I thought"--she looked about her appealingly--"you might
like it--for a surprise"]




CHAPTER XV

GROWING UP


"Dear Uncle Jimmie:

"It was a pleasant surprise to get letters from every one of my uncles
the first week I got back to school.You wrote
me two letters last year, Uncle David six, and Uncle Peter sixteen.He
is the best correspondent, but perhaps that is because I ask him the
most advice.I shall never forget the
expressions on all the different faces when I came down in my Juliet
suit.I thought at first that no one liked me in it, but I guess they
did."You know how well I liked my presents because you heard my wild
exclamations of delight.It was
sweet of the We Are Sevens to get me that ivory set, and to know that
every different piece was the loving thought of a different aunt or
uncle.It looks entirely unique, and I
like to have things that are not like anybody else's in the world,
don't you, Uncle Jimmie?They are
'neat,' but not 'gaudy.'You play golf so well I thought a golf stick
was a nice emblem for you, and would remind you of me and last
summer."I am glad you think it is easier to keep your pledge now.I made a
New Year's resolution to go without chocolates, and give the money
they would cost to some good cause, but it's hard to pick out a cause,
or to decide exactly how much money you are saving.I can eat the
chocolates that are sent to me, however!!!!"Uncle David said that he thought you were not like yourself lately,
but you seemed just the same to me Christmas, only more affectionate.I was really only joking about the chocolates.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Uncle David:

"I was glad to get your nice letter.You did not have to write in
response to my bread and butter letter, but I am glad you did.When I
am at school, and getting letters all the time I feel as if I were
living two beautiful lives all at once, the life of a 'cooperative
child' and the life of Eleanor Hamlin, schoolgirl, both together.Letters make the people you love seem very near to you, don't you
think they do?I sleep with all my letters under my pillow whenever I
feel the least little bit homesick, and they almost seem to breathe
sometimes.Maggie Lou had a wrist watch, too, for
Christmas, but not so pretty as the one you gave me.Miss Hadley says
I do remarkable work in English whenever I feel like it.I don't know
whether that's a compliment or not.I took Kris Kringle for the
subject of a theme the other day, and represented him as caught in an
iceberg in the grim north, and not being able to reach all the poor
little children in the tenements and hovels.The Haddock said it
showed imagination."There was a lecture at school on Emerson the other day.The speaker
was a noted literary lecturer from New York.He had wonderful waving
hair, more like Pader--I can't spell him, but you know who I
mean--than Uncle Jimmie's, but a little like both.He introduced some
very noble thoughts in his discourse, putting perfectly old ideas in
a new way that made you think a lot more of them.I think a tall man
like that with waving hair can do a great deal of good as a lecturer,
because you listen a good deal more respectfully than if they were
plain looking.His voice sounded a good deal like what I imagine
Romeo's voice did.I had a nice letter from Madam Bolling.I love you,
and I have come to the bottom of the sheet.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Uncle Peter:

"I have just written to my other uncles, so I won't write you a long
letter this time.They deserve letters because of being so unusually
prompt after the holidays.You always deserve letters, but not
specially now, any more than any other time."Uncle Peter, I wrote to my grandfather.It seems funny to think of
Albertina's aunt taking care of him now that Grandma is gone.I
suppose Albertina is there a lot.She sent me a post card for
Christmas."Uncle Peter, I miss my grandmother out of the world.I remember how I
used to take care of her, and put a soapstone in the small of her
back when she was cold.I wish sometimes that I could hold your hand,
Uncle Peter, when I get thinking about it."Well, school is the same old school.Bertha Stephens has a felon on
her finger, and that lets her out of hard work for a while.I will
enclose a poem suggested by a lecture I heard recently on Emerson.It
isn't very good, but it will help to fill up the envelope."Life

                 "Life is a great, a noble task,
                   When we fulfill our duty.To work, that should be all we ask,
                   And seek the living beauty.We know not whence we come, or where
                   Our dim pathway is leading,
                 Whether we tread on lilies fair,
                   Or trample love-lies-bleeding.But we must onward go and up,
                   Nor stop to question whither.E'en if we drink the bitter cup,
                   And fall at last, to wither."P. S. I haven't got the last verse very good yet, but I think the
second one is pretty.You know 'love-lies-bleeding' is a flower, but
it sounds allegorical the way I have put it in.*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor's fifteenth year was on the whole the least eventful year of
her life, though not by any means the least happy.She throve
exceedingly, and gained the freedom and poise of movement and
spontaneity that result from properly balanced periods of work and
play and healthful exercise.From being rather small of her age she
developed into a tall slender creature, inherently graceful and erect,
with a small, delicate head set flower-wise on a slim white neck.Gertrude never tired of modeling that lovely contour, but Eleanor
herself was quite unconscious of her natural advantages.She preferred
the snappy-eyed, stocky, ringleted type of beauty, and spent many
unhappy quarters of an hour wishing she were pretty according to the
inexorable ideals of Harmon.She spent her vacation at David's apartment in charge of Mademoiselle,
though the latter part of the summer she went to Colhassett, quite by
herself according to her own desire, and spent a month with her
grandfather, now in charge of Albertina's aunt.She found Albertina
grown into a huge girl, sunk in depths of sloth and snobbishness, who
plied her with endless questions concerning life in the gilded circles
of New York society.Eleanor found her disgusting and yet possessed of
that vague fascination that the assumption of prerogative often
carries with it.She found her grandfather very old and shrunken, yet perfectly taken
care of and with every material want supplied.She realized as she had
never done before how the faithful six had assumed the responsibility
of this household from the beginning, and how the old people had been
warmed and comforted by their bounty.She laughed to remember her
simplicity in believing that an actual salary was a perquisite of her
adoption, and understood for the first time how small a part of the
expense of their living this faithful stipend had defrayed.She looked
back incredulously on that period when she had lived with them in a
state of semi-starvation on the corn meal and cereals and very little
else that her dollar and a half a week had purchased, and the "garden
sass," that her grandfather had faithfully hoed and tended in the
straggling patch of plowed field that he would hoe and tend no more.She spent a month practically at his feet, listening to his stories,
helping him to find his pipe and tobacco and glasses, and reading the
newspaper to him, and felt amply rewarded by his final acknowledgment
that she was a good girl and he would as soon have her come again
whenever she felt like it.On her way back to school she spent a week with her friend, Margaret
Louise, in the Connecticut town where she lived with her comfortable,
commonplace family.It was while she was on this visit that the most
significant event of the entire year took place, though it was a
happening that she put out of her mind as soon as possible and never
thought of it again when she could possibly avoid it.Maggie Lou had a brother of seventeen, and one night in the corner of
a moonlit porch, when they happened to be alone for a half hour, he
had asked Eleanor to kiss him."I don't want to kiss you," Eleanor said.Then, not wishing to convey
a sense of any personal dislike to the brother of a friend to whom
she was so sincerely devoted, she added, "I don't know you well
enough."He was a big boy, with mocking blue eyes and rough tweed clothes that
hung on him loosely."When you know me better, will you let me kiss you?""I don't know," Eleanor said, still endeavoring to preserve the
amenities.He took her hand and played with it softly."You're an awful sweet little girl," he said.He pulled her back to the
chair from which she had half arisen."I don't believe in kissing _you_," she tried to say, but the words
would not come.She could only pray for deliverance through the
arrival of some member of the family.The boy's face was close to
hers.It looked sweet in the moonlight she thought.She wished he
would talk of something else besides kissing."Well, then, there's no more to be said."His breath came heavily, with little irregular catches
in it.She pushed him away and turned into the house."Don't be angry, Eleanor," he pleaded, trying to snatch at her hand."I'm not angry," she said, her voice breaking, "I just wish you
hadn't, that's all."There was no reference to this incident in the private diary, but,
with an instinct which would have formed an indissoluble bond between
herself and her Uncle Jimmie, she avoided dimly lit porches and boys
with mischievous eyes and broad tweed covered shoulders.For her guardians too, this year was comparatively smooth running and
colorless.Beulah's militant spirit sought the assuagement of a fierce
expenditure of energy on the work that came to her hand through her
new interest in suffrage.Gertrude flung herself into her sculpturing.She had been hurt as only the young can be hurt when their first
delicate desires come to naught.She was very warm-blooded and eager
under her cool veneer, and she had spent four years of hard work and
hungry yearning for the fulness of a life she was too constrained to
get any emotional hold on.Her fancy for Jimmie she believed was
quite over and done with.Margaret, warmed by secret fires and nourished by the stuff that
dreams are made of, flourished strangely in her attic chamber, and
learned the wisdom of life by some curious method of her own of
apprehending its dangers and delights.The only experiences she had
that year were two proposals of marriage, one from a timid professor
of the romance languages and the other from a young society man,
already losing his waist line, whose sensuous spirit had been stirred
by the ethereal grace of hers; but these things interested her very
little.She was the princess, spinning fine dreams and waiting for the
dawning of the golden day when the prince should come for her.Neither
she nor Gertrude ever gave a serious thought to the five-year-old vow
of celibacy, which was to Beulah as real and as binding as it had
seemed on the first day she took it.Peter and David and Jimmie went their own way after the fashion of
men, all of them identified with the quickening romance of New York
business life.David in Wall Street was proving to be something of a
financier to his mother's surprise and amazement; and the pressure
relaxed, he showed some slight initiative in social matters.In fact,
two mothers, who were on Mrs.Bolling's list as suitable
parents-in-law, took heart of grace and began angling for him
adroitly, while their daughters served him tea and made unabashed,
modern-debutante eyes at him.Jimmie, successfully working his way up to the top of his firm,
suffered intermittently from his enthusiastic abuse of the privileges
of liberty and the pursuit of happiness.His mind and soul were in
reality hot on the trail of a wife, and there was no woman among those
with whom he habitually foregathered whom his spirit recognized as his
own woman.He was further rendered helpless and miserable by the fact
that he had not the slightest idea of his trouble.He regarded himself
as a congenital Don Juan, from whom his better self shrank at times
with a revulsion of loathing.Peter felt that he had his feet very firmly on a rather uninspired
earth.He was getting on in the woolen business, which happened to be
the vocation his father had handed down to him.He belonged to an
amusing club, and he still felt himself irrevocably widowed by the
early death of the girl in the photograph he so faithfully cherished.Eleanor was a very vital interest in his life.It had seemed to him
for a few minutes at the Christmas party that she was no longer the
little girl he had known, that a lovelier, more illusive creature--a
woman--had come to displace her, but when she had flung her arms
around him he had realized that it was still the heart of a child
beating so fondly against his own.The real trouble with arrogating to ourselves the privileges of
parenthood is that our native instincts are likely to become deflected
by the substitution of the artificial for the natural responsibility.Both Peter and David had the unconscious feeling that their obligation
to their race was met by their communal interest in Eleanor.Beulah,
of course, sincerely believed that the filling in of an intellectual
concept of life was all that was required of her.Only Jimmie groped
blindly and bewilderedly for his own.Gertrude and Margaret both
understood that they were unnaturally alone in a world where lovers
met and mated, but they, too, hugged to their souls the flattering
unction that they were parents of a sort.Thus three sets of perfectly suitable and devoted young men and
women, of marriageable age, with dozens of interests and sympathies in
common, and one extraordinarily vital bond, continued to walk side by
side in a state of inhuman preoccupation, their gaze fixed inward
instead of upon one another; and no Divine Power, happening upon the
curious circumstance, believed the matter one for His intervention nor
stooped to take the respective puppets by the back of their
unconscious necks, and so knock their sluggish heads together.CHAPTER XVI

MARGARET LOUISA'S BIRTHRIGHT


"I am sixteen years and eight months old to-day," Eleanor wrote, "and
I have had the kind of experience that makes me feel as if I never
wanted to be any older.I know life is full of disillusionment and
pain, but I did not know that any one with whom you have broken bread,
and slept in the same room with, and told everything to for four long
years, could turn out to be an absolute traitor and villainess.For nearly a year now I have noticed that
Bertha Stephens avoided me, and presented the appearance of disliking
me.I don't like to have any one dislike me, and I have tried to do
little things for her that would win back her affection, but with no
success.As I was editing the Lantern I could print her essayettes (as
she called them) and do her lots of little favors in a literary way,
which she seemed to appreciate, but personally she avoided me like the
plague."Of course Stevie has lots of faults, and since Margaret Louise and I
always talked everything over we used to talk about Stevie in the same
way.I remember that she used to try to draw me out about Stevie's
character.I've always thought Stevie was a kind of piker, that is
that she would say she was going to do a thing, and then from sheer
laziness not do it.She gummed it
all up with her nasty fudge and then wouldn't give it back to me or
get me another, but the reason she wouldn't give it back to me was
because her feelings were too fine to return a damaged article, and
not fine enough to make her hump herself and get me another.That's
only one kind of a piker and not the worst kind, but it was
_pikerish_."All this I told quite frankly to Maggie--I mean Margaret Louise,
because I had no secrets from her and never thought there was any
reason why I shouldn't.Stevie has a horrid brother, also, who has
been up here to dances.All the girls hate him because he is so
spoony.He isn't as spoony as Margaret Louise's brother, but he's
quite a sloppy little spooner at that.Well, I told Margaret Louise
that I didn't like Stevie's brother, and then I made the damaging
remark that one reason I didn't like him was because he looked so much
like Stevie.I didn't bother to explain to Maggie--I will not call her
Maggie Lou any more, because that is a dear little name and sounds so
affectionate,--Margaret Louise--what I meant by this, because I
thought it was perfectly evident.Stevie is a peachy looking girl, a
snow white blonde with pinky cheeks and dimples.Well, her brother is
a snow white blond too, and he has pinky cheeks and dimples and his
name is Carlo!We, of course, at once named him Curlo.It is not a
good idea for a man to look too much like his sister, or to have too
many dimples in his chin and cheeks.I had only to think of him in the
same room with my three uncles to get his number exactly.I don't mean
to use slang in my diary, but I can't seem to help it.Professor
Mathews says that slang has a distinct function in the language--in
replenishing it, but Uncle Peter says about slang words, that'many
are called, and few are chosen,' and there is no need to try to
accommodate them all in one's vocabulary."Well, I told Margaret Louise all these things about Curlo, and how
he tried to hold my hand coming from the station one day, when the
girls all went up to meet the boys that came up for the dance,--and I
told her everything else in the world that happened to come into my
head."Then one day I got thinking about leaving Harmon--this is our senior
year, of course--and I thought that I should leave all the girls with
things just about right between us, excepting good old Stevie, who had
this queer sort of grouch against me.So I decided that I'd just go
around and have it out with her, and I did.I went into her room one
day when her roommate was out, and demanded a show down.Well, I found
out that Maggie--Margaret Louise had just repeated to Stevie every
living thing that I ever said about her, just as I said it, only
without the explanations and foot-notes that make any kind of
conversation more understandable."Stevie told me all these things one after another, without stopping,
and when she was through I wished that the floor would open and
swallow me up, but nothing so comfortable happened.I was obliged to
gaze into Stevie's overflowing eyes and own up to the truth as well as
I could, and explain it.It was the most humiliating hour that I ever
spent, but I told Stevie exactly what I felt about her 'nothing
extenuate, and naught set down in malice,' and what I had said about
her to our mutual friend, who by the way, is not the mutual friend of
either of us any longer.We were both crying by the time I had
finished, but we understood each other.There were one or two things
that she said she didn't think she would ever forget that I had said
about her, but even those she could forgive.She said that my dislike
of her had rankled in her heart so long that it took away all the
bitterness to know that I wasn't really her enemy.She said that my
coming to her that way, and not lying had showed that I had lots of
character, and she thought in time that we could be quite intimate
friends if I wanted to as much as she did."After my talk with Stevie I still hoped against hope that Margaret
Louise would turn out to have some reason or excuse for what she had
done.I knew she had done it, but when a thing like that happens that
upsets your whole trust in a person you simply can not believe the
evidence of your own senses.When you read of a situation like that
in a book you are all prepared for it by the author, who has taken the
trouble to explain the moral weakness or unpleasantness of the
character, and given you to understand that you are to expect a
betrayal from him or her; but when it happens in real life out of a
clear sky you have nothing to go upon that makes you even _believe_
what you know."I won't even try to describe the scene that occurred between Margaret
Louise and me.She cried and she lied, and she accused me of trying to
curry favor with Stevie, and Stevie of being a backbiter, and she
argued and argued about all kinds of things but the truth, and when I
tried to pin her down to it, she ducked and crawled and sidestepped in
a way that was dreadful.I've seen her do something like it before
about different things, and I ought to have known then what she was
like inside of her soul, but I guess you have to be the object of such
a scene before you realize the full force of it."All I said was, 'Margaret Louise, if that's all you've got to say
about the injury you have done me, then everything is over between us
from this minute;' and it was, too."I feel as if I had been writing a beautiful story or poem on what I
thought was an enduring tablet of marble, and some one had come and
wiped it all off as if it were mere scribblings on a slate.I don't
know whether it would seem like telling tales to tell Uncle Peter or
not; I don't quite know whether I want to tell him.Sometimes I wish I
had a mother to tell such things to.It seems to me that a real mother
would know what to say that would help you.Disillusion is a very
strange thing--like death, only having people die seems more natural
somehow.When they die you can remember the happy hours that you spent
with them, but when disillusionment comes then you have lost even your
beautiful memories."We had for the subject of our theme this week, 'What Life Means to
Me,' which of course was the object of many facetious remarks from the
girls, but I've been thinking that if I sat down seriously to state in
just so many words what life means to _me_, I hardly know what I would
transcribe.It means disillusionment and death for one thing.Since my
grandfather died last year I have had nobody left of my own in the
world,--no real blood relation.Of course, I am a good deal fonder of
my aunts and uncles than most people are of their own flesh and blood,
but own flesh and blood is a thing that it makes you feel shivery to
be without.If I had been Margaret Louise's own flesh and blood, she
would never have acted like that to me.Stevie stuck up for Carlo as
if he was really something to be proud of.Perhaps my uncles and aunts
feel that way about me, I don't know.I don't even know if I feel that
way about them.I certainly criticize them in my soul at times, and
feel tired of being dragged around from pillar to post.I don't feel
that way about Uncle Peter, but there is nobody else that I am
certain, positive sure that I love better than life itself.If there
is only one in the world that you feel that way about, I might not be
Uncle Peter's one.I wish Margaret Louise had not sold her birthright for a mess of
pottage.I wish I had a home that I had a perfect right to go and live
in forevermore.I wish my mother was here to comfort me to-night."CHAPTER XVII

A REAL KISS


At seventeen, Eleanor was through at Harmon.She was to have one year
of preparatory school and then it was the desire of Beulah's heart
that she should go to Rogers.The others contended that the higher
education should be optional and not obligatory.The decision was
finally to be left to Eleanor herself, after she had considered it in
all its bearings."If she doesn't decide in favor of college," David said, "and she
makes her home with me here, as I hope she will do, of course, I don't
see what society we are going to be able to give her.Unfortunately
none of our contemporaries have growing daughters.She ought to meet
eligible young men and that sort of thing."The two were having a cozy cup of tea at
his apartment."You're so terribly worldly, David, that you frighten
me sometimes.""You don't know where I will end, is that the idea?""I don't know where Eleanor will end, if you're already thinking of
eligible young men for her.""Those things have got to be thought of," David answered gravely."I don't want her to be
married.I want to take her off by myself and growl over her all alone
for a while.Then I want Prince Charming to come along and snatch her
up quickly, and set her behind his milk white charger and ride away
with her.If we've all got to get together and connive at marrying her
off there won't be any comfort in having her.""I don't know," David said thoughtfully; "I think that might be fun,
too.A vicarious love-affair that you can manipulate is one of the
most interesting games in the world.""That's not my idea of an interesting game," Margaret said."I like
things very personal, David,--you ought to know that by this time.""I do know that," David said, "but it sometimes occurs to me that
except for a few obvious facts of that nature I really know very
little about you, Margaret.""There isn't much to know--except that I'm a woman.""That's a good deal," David answered slowly; "to a mere man that seems
to be considerable of an adventure.""It is about as much of an adventure sometimes as it would be to be a
field of clover in an insectless world.--This is wonderful tea, David,
but your cream is like butter and floats around in it in wudges.No,
don't get any more, I've got to go home.Grandmother still thinks it's
very improper for me to call upon you, in spite of Mademoiselle and
your ancient and honorable housekeeper.""Don't go," David said; "I apologize on my knees for the cream.I'll
send out and have it wet down, or whatever you do to cream in that
state."About the cream, or the proprieties?"I'm a little bit tired of being
one, that's all, and I want to go home.""She wants to go home when she's being so truly delightful and
cryptic," David said."Have you been seeing visions, Margaret, in my
hearth fire?She rose and stood absently fitting
her gloves to her fingers."I don't know exactly what it was I saw,
but it was something that made me uncomfortable.It gives me the
creeps to talk about being a woman.David, do you know sometimes I
have a kind of queer hunch about Eleanor?I love her, you know,
dearly, dearly.I think that she is a very successful kind of
Frankenstein; but there are moments when I have the feeling that she's
going to be a storm center and bring some queer trouble upon us.I
wouldn't say this to anybody but you, David."As David tucked her in the car--he had arrived at the dignity of
owning one now--and watched her sweet silhouette disappear, he, too,
had his moment of clairvoyance.He felt that he was letting something
very precious slip out of sight, as if some radiant and delicate gift
had been laid lightly within his grasp and as lightly withdrawn again.As if when the door closed on his friend Margaret some stranger, more
silent creature who was dear to him had gone with her.As soon as he
was dressed for dinner he called Margaret on the telephone to know if
she had arrived home safely, and was informed not only that she had,
but that she was very wroth at him for getting her down three flights
of stairs in the midst of her own dinner toilet."I had a kind of hunch, too," he told her, "and I felt as if I wanted
to hear your voice speaking.""If that's the way you feel about your chauffeur," she said, "you
ought to discharge him, but he brought me home beautifully."The difference between a man's moments of prescience and a woman's, is
that the man puts them out of his consciousness as quickly as he can,
while a woman clings to them fearfully and goes her way a little more
carefully for the momentary flash of foresight.David tried to see
Margaret once or twice during that week but failed to find her in when
he called or telephoned, and the special impulse to seek her alone
again died naturally.One Saturday a few weeks later Eleanor telegraphed him that she
wished to come to New York for the week-end to do some shopping.He went to the train to meet her, and when the slender chic figure in
the most correct of tailor made suits appeared at the gateway, with an
obsequious porter bearing her smart bag and ulster, he gave a sudden
gasp of surprise at the picture.He had been aware for some time of
the increase in her inches and the charm of the pure cameo-cut
profile, but he regarded her still as a child histrionically assuming
the airs and graces of womanhood, as small girl children masquerade in
the trailing skirts of their elders.He was accustomed to the idea
that she was growing up rapidly, but the fact that she was already
grown had never actually dawned on him until this moment."You look as if you were surprised to see me, Uncle David,--are you?"she said, slipping a slim hand, warm through its immaculate glove,
into his."You knew I was coming, and you came to meet me, and yet you
looked as surprised as if you hadn't expected me at all.""Surprised to see you just about expresses it, Eleanor.I was looking for a little girl in hair ribbons with her
skirts to her knees.""And a blue tam-o'-shanter?""And a blue tam-o'-shanter.I had forgotten you had grown up any to
speak of.""You see me every vacation," Eleanor grumbled, as she stepped into the
waiting motor."It isn't because you lack opportunity that you don't
notice what I look like.It's just because you're naturally
unobserving.""Peter and Jimmie have been making a good deal of fuss about your
being a young lady, now I think of it.Peter especially has been
rather a nuisance about it, breaking into my most precious moments of
triviality with the sweetly solemn thought that our little girl has
grown to be a woman now.""Oh, does _he_ think I'm grown up, does he really?"He's all the time wanting me to get you to
New York over the weekend, so that he can see if you are any taller
than you were the last time he saw you.""Are they coming to see me this evening?""Jimmie is going to look in.You
know she's on here from China with her daughter."She must be as grown up as I am," Eleanor said."I used to have her
room, you know, when I stayed with Uncle Peter."Not as much as he likes you, Miss Green-eyes.He says she looks like
a heathen Chinee but otherwise is passable.I didn't know that you
added jealousy to the list of your estimable vices.""I'm not jealous," Eleanor protested; "or if I am it's only because
she's blood relation,--and I'm not, you know.""It's a good deal more prosaic to be a blood relation, if anybody
should ask you," David smiled."A blood relation is a good deal like
the famous primrose on the river's brim.""'A primrose by the river's brim a yellow primrose was to him,--and
nothing more,'" Eleanor quoted gaily."Why, what more--" she broke off
suddenly and  slightly."What more would anybody want to be than a yellow primrose by the
river's brim?""I don't know, I'm sure.I'm a
mere man and such questions are too abstruse for me, as I told your
Aunt Margaret the other day.Now I think of it, though, you don't look
unlike a yellow primrose yourself to-day, daughter.""That's because I've got a yellow ribbon on my hat."It has something to do with
youth and fragrance and the flowers that bloom in the spring.""The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra la," Eleanor returned
saucily, "have nothing to do with the case.""She's learning that she has eyes, good Lord," David said to himself,
but aloud he remarked paternally, "I saw all your aunts yesterday.Gertrude gave a tea party and invited a great many famous tea party
types, and ourselves."Beulah was there, like the famous Queenie,
with her hair in a braid."She's gone in for dress reform now, you know, a kind
of middy blouse made out of a striped portiere with a kilted skirt of
the same material and a Scotch cap.Your Aunt Beulah presents a peculiar phenomenon these days.She's
growing better-looking and behaving worse every day of her life.""She's theory ridden and fad bitten.She'll come to a bad end if
something doesn't stop her.""Do you mean--stop her working for suffrage?I'm a suffragist, Uncle
David.""And quite right to remind me of it before I began slamming the cause.I mean the
way she's going after it.There are healthy ways of insisting on your
rights and unhealthy ways.Beulah's getting further and further off
key, that's all.Your poor old
cooperative father welcomes you to the associated hearthstone.""This front entrance looks more like my front entrance than any other
place does," Eleanor said.she asked the black elevator man, who beamed delightedly
upon her.I didn't know he had one," David chuckled."It takes a
woman--"

Jimmie appeared in the evening, laden with violets and a five pound
box of the chocolates most in favor in the politest circles at the
moment."What's devouring you, papa?""Don't I always place
tributes at the feet of the offspring?""Mirror candy and street corner violets, yes," David said."It's only
the labels that surprised me.""She knows the difference, now," Jimmie answered, "what would you?"The night before her return to school it was decreed that she should
go to bed early.She had spent two busy days of shopping and "seeing
the family."She had her hours discussing her future with Peter, long
visits and talks with Margaret and Gertrude, and a cup of tea at
suffrage headquarters with Beulah, as well as long sessions in the
shops accompanied by Mademoiselle, who made her home now permanently
with David.She sat before the fire drowsily constructing pyramids out
of the embers and David stood with one arm on the mantel, smoking his
after-dinner cigar, and watching her."I can't seem to make up my mind, Uncle David.""Yes, I'd love it,--if--"

"If what, daughter?""If I thought I could spare the time.""I'm going to earn my own living, you know."I've got to--in order to--to feel right about things.""Don't you like the style of living to which your cooperative parents
have accustomed you?""I love everything you've ever done for me, but I can't go on letting
you do things for me forever."It doesn't seem--right, that's all.""It's your New England conscience, Eleanor; one of the most specious
varieties of consciences in the world.It will always be tempting you
to do good that better may come.I don't know whether I would be better
fitted to earn my living if I went to business college or real
college."I can't think,--I'm stupefied.""Uncle Peter couldn't think, either.""Have you mentioned this brilliant idea to Peter?""He talked it over with me, but I think he thinks I'll change my
mind."Eleanor, we're all
able to afford you--the little we spend on you is nothing divided
among six of us.When did you come to
this extraordinary decision?"Bolling talked to me, I think.There are things she said that I've never forgotten.I told Uncle
Peter to think about it and then help me to decide which to do, and I
want you to think, Uncle David, and tell me truly what you believe
the best preparation for a business life would be.I thought perhaps I
might be a stenographer in an editorial office, and my training there
would be more use to me than four years at college, but I don't
know.""You're an extraordinary young woman," David said, staring at her."I'm glad you broached this subject, if only that I might realize how
extraordinary, but I don't think anything will come of it, my dear.I
don't want you to go to college unless you really want to, but if you
do want to, I hope you will take up the pursuit of learning as a
pursuit and not as a means to an end."Then let's have no more of this nonsense of earning your own
living.""Are you really displeased, Uncle David?""I should be if I thought you were serious,--but it's bedtime.If
you're going to get your beauty sleep, my dear, you ought to begin on
it immediately."Eleanor rose obediently, her brow clouded a little, and her head held
high.David watched the color coming and going in the sweet face and
the tender breast rising and falling with her quickening breath."I thought perhaps you would understand," she said.She had always kissed him "good night" until this visit, and he had
refrained from commenting on the omission before, but now he put out
his hand to her."There is only one way
for a daughter to say good night to her parent."She put up her face, and as she did so he caught the glint of tears in
her eyes."Why, Eleanor, dear," he said, "did you care?"With his arms still about her shoulder he stood looking down at her.A
hot tide of crimson made its way slowly to her brow and then receded,
accentuating the clear pallor of her face."That was a real kiss, dear," he said slowly."We mustn't get such
things confused.I won't bother you with talking about it to-night, or
until you are ready.Until then we'll pretend that it didn't happen,
but if the thought of it should ever disturb you the least bit, dear,
you are to remember that the time is coming when I shall have
something to say about it; will you remember?""Yes, Uncle David," Eleanor said uncertainly, "but I--I--"

David took her unceremoniously by the shoulders."Go now," he said, and she obeyed him without further question.CHAPTER XVIII

BEULAH'S PROBLEM


Peter was shaving for the evening.His sister was giving a dinner
party for two of her husband's fellow bankers and their wives.After
that they were going to see the latest Belasco production, and from
there to some one of the new dancing "clubs,"--the smart cabarets that
were forced to organize in the guise of private enterprises to evade
the two o'clock closing law.Peter enjoyed dancing, but he did not as
a usual thing enjoy bankers' wives.He was deliberating on the
possibility of excusing himself gracefully after the theater, on the
plea of having some work to do, and finally decided that his sister's
feelings would be hurt if she realized he was trying to escape the
climax of the hospitality she had provided so carefully.He gazed at himself intently over the drifts of lather and twisted his
shaving mirror to the most propitious angle from time to time.In the
room across the hall--Eleanor's room, he always called it to
himself--his young niece was singing bits of the Mascagni intermezzo
interspersed with bits of the latest musical comedy, in a rather
uncertain contralto."My last girl came from Vassar, and I don't know where to class her.""My last girl--" and
began at the beginning of the chorus again."My last girl came from
Vassar," which brought him by natural stages to the consideration of
the higher education and of Beulah, and a conversation concerning her
that he had had with Jimmie and David the night before."She's off her nut," Jimmie said succinctly."It's not exactly that
there's nobody home," he rapped his curly pate significantly, "but
there's too much of a crowd there.She's not the same old girl at all.She used to be a good fellow, high-brow propaganda and all.Now she's
got nothing else in her head."It's what hasn't happened to her that's addled her," David explained."It's these highly charged, hypersensitive young women that go to
pieces under the modern pressure.They're the ones that need licking
into shape by all the natural processes.""By which you mean a drunken husband and a howling family?""Feminism isn't the answer to
Beulah's problem.""It is the problem," David said; "she's poisoning herself with it.My cousin Jack
married a girl with a sister a great deal like Beulah, looks,
temperament, and everything else, though she wasn't half so nice.She
got going the militant pace and couldn't stop herself.I never met her
at a dinner party that she wasn't tackling somebody on the subject of
man's inhumanity to woman.She ended in a sanitorium; in fact, they're
thinking now of taking her to the--"

"--bug house," Jimmie finished cheerfully."And in the beginning she was a perfectly good girl that needed
nothing in the world but a chance to develop along legitimate lines.""The frustrate matron," David agreed gravely."I wonder you haven't
realized this yourself, Gram.You're keener about such things than I
am.Beulah is more your job than mine.""You're the only one she listens to or looks up to.Go up and tackle
her some day and see what you can do."Give her the once over and throw out the lifeline," Jimmie said."I thought all this stuff was a phase, a part of her taking herself
seriously as she always has.I had no idea it was anything to worry
about," Peter persisted."Are you sure she's in bad shape--that she's
got anything more than a bad attack of Feminism of the Species in its
most virulent form?They come out of _that_, you know.""She's batty," Jimmie nodded gravely."Go up and look her over," David persisted; "you'll see what we mean,
then.Peter reviewed this conversation while he shaved the right side of his
face, and frowned prodigiously through the lather.He wished that he
had an engagement that evening that he could break in order to get to
see Beulah at once, and discover for himself the harm that had come to
his friend.He had always felt that he saw
a little more clearly than the others the virtue that was in the girl.He admired the pluck with which she made her attack on life and the
energy with which she accomplished her ends.There was to him
something alluring and quaint about her earnestness.The fact that her
soundness could be questioned came to him with something like a shock.As soon as he was dressed he was called to the telephone to talk to
David."Margaret has just told me that Doctor Penrose has been up to see
Beulah and pronounces it a case of nervous breakdown.He wants her to
try out <DW43>-analysis, and that sort of thing.He seems to feel that
it's serious.Margaret is fearfully upset, poor girl.So'm I, to tell
the truth.""And so am I," Peter acknowledged to himself as he hung up the
receiver.He was so absorbed during the evening that one of the
ladies--the wife of the fat banker--found him extremely dull and
decided against asking him to dinner with his sister.The wife of the
thin banker, who was in his charge at the theater, got the benefit of
his effort to rouse himself and grace the occasion creditably, and
found him delightful.By the time the evening was over he had decided
that Beulah should be pulled out of whatever dim world of dismay and
delusion she might be wandering in, at whatever cost.It was
unthinkable that she should be wasted, or that her youth and splendid
vitality should go for naught.He found her eager to talk to him the next night when he went to see
her."Peter," she said, "I want you to go to my aunt and my mother, and
tell them that I've got to go on with my work,--that I can't be
stopped and interrupted by this foolishness of doctors and nurses.I
never felt better in my life, except for not being able to sleep, and
I think that is due to the way they have worried me.I live in a world
they don't know anything about, that's all.Even if they were right,
if I am wearing myself out soul and body for the sake of the cause,
what business is it of theirs to interfere?I'm working for the souls
and bodies of women for ages to come.What difference does it make if
my soul and body suffer?Peter
observed the unnatural light in them, the apparent dryness of her
lips, the two bright spots burning below her cheek-bones."Because," he answered her slowly, "I don't think it was the original
intention of Him who put us here that we should sacrifice everything
we are to the business of emphasizing the superiority of a sex.""That isn't the point at all, Peter.No man understands, no man can
understand.It's woman's equality we want emphasized, just literally
that and nothing more.You've pauperized and degraded us long
enough--"

"Thou canst not say I--" Peter began."Yes, you and every other man, every man in the world is a party to
it.""I had to get her going," Peter apologized to himself, "in order to
get a point of departure.Not if I vote for women, Beulah, dear," he
added aloud."If you throw your influence with us instead of against us," she
conceded, "you're helping to right the wrong that you have permitted
for so long.""Well, granting your premise, granting all your premises, Beulah--and
I admit that most of them have sound reasoning behind them--your
battle now is all over but the shouting.There's no reason that you
personally should sacrifice your last drop of energy to a campaign
that's practically won already.""If you think the mere franchise is all I have been working for,
Peter,--"

"I don't.I know the thousand and one activities you women are
concerned with.I know how much better church and state always have
been and are bound to be, when the women get behind and push, if they
throw their strength right."Beulah rose enthusiastically to this bait and talked rationally and
well for some time.Just as Peter was beginning to feel that David and
Jimmie had been guilty of the most unsympathetic exaggeration of her
state of mind--unquestionably she was not as fit physically as
usual--she startled him with an abrupt change into almost hysterical
incoherence."I have a right to live my own life," she concluded, "and
nobody--nobody shall stop me.""We are all living our own lives, aren't we?""No woman lives her own life to-day," Beulah cried, still excitedly."Every woman is living the life of some man, who has the legal right
to treat her as an imbecile."How about the suffrage states, how about the women
who are already in the proud possession of their rights and
privileges?They are not technical imbeciles any longer according to
your theory.Every woman will be a super-woman in
two shakes,--so what's devouring you, as Jimmie says?""It's after all the states have suffrage that the big fight will
really begin," Beulah answered wearily."It's the habit of wearing the
yoke we'll have to fight then.""The anti-feminists," Peter said, "I see.Beulah, can't you give
yourself any rest, or is the nature of the cause actually suicidal?"To his surprise her tense face quivered at this and she tried to
steady a tremulous lower lip."I am tired," she said, a little piteously, "dreadfully tired, but
nobody cares.""They only want to stop me doing something they have no sympathy with.What do Gertrude and Margaret know of the real purpose of my life or
my failure or success?They take a sentimental interest in my health,
that's all.Do you suppose it made any difference to Jeanne d'Arc how
many people took a sympathetic interest in her health if they didn't
believe in what she believed in?""I thought Eleanor would grow up to take an interest in the position
of women, and to care about the things I cared about, but she's not
going to.""Not as fond as she is of Margaret."Peter longed to dispute this, but he could not in honesty."She's so lukewarm she might just as well be an anti.They drag us back like
so much dead weight.""I suppose Eleanor has been a disappointment to you," Peter mused,
"but she tries pretty hard to be all things to all parents, Beulah.You'll find she won't fail you if you need her.""I shan't need her," Beulah said, prophetically."I hoped she'd stand
beside me in the work, but she's not that kind.She'll marry early and
have a family, and that will be the end of her.""I wonder if she will," Peter said, "I hope so.She still seems such
a child to me.I believe in marriage, Beulah, don't you?"I made a vow once that I would never
marry and I've always believed that it would be hampering and limiting
to a woman, but now I see that the fight has got to go on.If there
are going to be women to carry on the fight they will have to be born
of the women who are fighting to-day.""It doesn't make any difference why
you believe it, if you do believe it.""It makes all the difference," Beulah said, but her voice softened."What I believe is more to me than anything else in the world,
Peter."I understand your point of view, Beulah.You
carry it a little bit too far, that's all that's wrong with it from my
way of thinking.""Will you help me to go on, Peter?"Tell them that they're all wrong in
their treatment of me.""I think I could undertake to do that"--Peter was convinced that a
less antagonistic attitude on the part of her relatives would be more
successful--"and I will.""You're the only one who comes anywhere near knowing," she said, "or
who ever will, I guess.I try so hard, Peter, and now when I don't
seem to be accomplishing as much as I want to, as much as it's
necessary for me to accomplish if I am to go on respecting myself,
every one enters into a conspiracy to stop my doing anything at all.The only thing that makes me nervous is the way I am thwarted and
opposed at every turn."Perhaps not, but you have something remarkably like _idee fixe_,"
Peter said to himself compassionately.He found her actual condition less dangerous but much more difficult
than he had anticipated.She was living wrong, that was the sum and
substance of her malady.Her life was spent confronting theories and
discounting conditions.She did not realize that it is only the
interest of our investment in life that we can sanely contribute to
the cause of living.Our capital strength and energy must be used for
the struggle for existence itself if we are to have a world of
balanced individuals.There is an arrogance involved in assuming
ourselves more humane than human that reacts insidiously on our health
and morals.Peter, looking into the twitching hectic face before him
with the telltale glint of mania in the eyes, felt himself becoming
helpless with pity for a mind gone so far askew.He felt curiously
responsible for Beulah's condition."She wouldn't have run herself so far aground," he thought, "if I had
been on the job a little more.I could have helped her to steer
straighter.A word here and a lift there and she would have come
through all right.Now something's got to stop her or she can't be
stopped.She'll preach once too often out of the tail of a cart on the
subject of equal guardianship,--and--"

Beulah put her hands to her face suddenly, and, sinking back into the
depths of the big cushioned chair on the edge of which she had been
tensely poised during most of the conversation, burst into tears."You're the only one that knows," she sobbed over and over again."I'm so tired, Peter, but I've got to go on and on and on.If they
stop me, I'll kill myself."Peter crossed the room to her side and sat down on her chair-arm."Don't cry, dear," he said, with a hand on her head."You're too tired
to think things out now,--but I'll help you."She lifted a piteous face, for the moment so startlingly like that of
the dead girl he had loved that his senses were confused by the
resemblance."I think I see the way," he said slowly.He slipped to his knees and gathered her close in his arms."I think this will be the way, dear," he said very gently."Does this mean that you want me to marry you?"she whispered, when
she was calmer."If you will, dear," he said."I will,--if I can, if I can make it seem right to after I've thought
it all out.--Oh!"I had no idea of that," he said gravely, "but it's wonderful that
you do.I'll put everything I've got into trying to make you happy,
Beulah."Her arms closed around his neck and
tightened there.He made her comfortable and she relaxed like a tired child, almost
asleep under his soothing hand, and the quiet spell of his
tenderness."I didn't know it could be like this," she whispered.In his heart he was saying, "This is best.It
is the right and normal way for her--and for me."In her tri-cornered dormitory room at the new school which she was not
sharing with any one this year Eleanor, enveloped in a big brown and
yellow wadded bathrobe, was writing a letter to Peter.Her hair hung
in two golden brown braids over her shoulders and her pure profile was
bent intently over the paper.At the moment when Beulah made her
confession of love and closed her eyes against the breast of the man
who had just asked her to marry him, two big tears forced their way
between Eleanor's lids and splashed down upon her letter.CHAPTER XIX

MOSTLY UNCLE PETER


"Dear Uncle Peter," the letter ran, "I am very, very homesick and
lonely for you to-day.It seems to me that I would gladly give a whole
year of my life just for the privilege of being with you, and talking
instead of writing,--but since that can not be, I am going to try and
write you about the thing that is troubling me.I can't bear it alone
any longer, and still I don't know whether it is the kind of thing
that it is honorable to tell or not.So you see I am very much
troubled and puzzled, and this trouble involves some one else in a way
that it is terrible to think of."Uncle Peter, dear, I do not want to be married.Not until I have
grown up, and seen something of the world.You know it is one of my
dearest wishes to be self-supporting, not because I am a Feminist or a
new woman, or have 'the unnatural belief of an antipathy to man' that
you're always talking about, but just because it will prove to me once
and for all that I belong to myself, and that my _soul_ isn't, and
never has been cooperative.You know what I mean by this, and you are
not hurt by my feeling so.You, I am sure, would not want me to be
married, or to have to think of myself as engaged, especially not to
anybody that we all knew and loved, and who is very close to me and
you in quite another way.Please don't try to imagine what I mean,
Uncle Peter--even if you know, you must tell yourself that you don't
know.Please, please pretend even to yourself that I haven't written
you this letter.I know people do tell things like this, but I don't
know quite how they bring themselves to do it, even if they have
somebody like you who understands everything--everything."Uncle Peter, dear, I am supposed to be going to be married by and by
when the one who wants it feels that it can be spoken of, and until
that happens, I've got to wait for him to speak, unless I can find
some way to tell him that I do not want it ever to be.I don't know
how to tell him.I don't know how to make him feel that I do not
belong to him.It is only myself I belong to, and I belong to you, but
I don't know how to make that plain to any one who does not know it
already.I can't say it unless perhaps you can help me to.I know every girl always thinks
there is something different about her, but I think there are ways in
which I truly am different.When I want anything I know more clearly
what it is, and why I want it than most other girls do, and not only
that, but I know now, that I want to keep myself, and everything I
think and feel and am,--_sacred_.There is an inner shrine in a
woman's soul that she must keep inviolate."A liberty that you haven't known how, or had the strength to prevent,
is a terrible thing.Uncle Peter, dear, twice in
my life things have happened that drive me almost desperate when I
think of them.If these things should happen again when I know that I
don't want them to, I don't think there would be any way of my bearing
it.Perhaps you can tell me something that will make me find a way out
of this tangle.I don't see what it could be, but lots of times you
have shown me the way out of endless mazes that were not grown up
troubles like this, but seemed very real to me just the same."Uncle Peter, dear, dear, dear,--you are all I have.I wish you were
here to-night, though you wouldn't be let in, even if you beat on the
gate ever so hard, for it's long after bedtime.I am up in my tower
room all alone.*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor read her letter over and addressed a tear splotched envelope
to Peter.Then she slowly tore letter and envelope into little bits."He would know," she said to herself."I haven't any real right to
tell him.It would be just as bad as any kind of tattling."She began another letter to him but found she could not write without
saying what was in her heart, and so went to bed uncomforted.There
was nothing in her experience to help her in her relation to David.His kiss on her lips had taught her the nature of such kisses: had
made her understand suddenly the ease with which the strange, sweet
spell of sex is cast.She related it to the episode of the unwelcome
caress bestowed upon her by the brother of Maggie Lou, and that half
forgotten incident took on an almost terrible significance.She
understood now how she should have repelled that unconscionable boy,
but that understanding did not help her with the problem of her Uncle
David.Though the thought of it thrilled through her with a strange
incredible delight, she did not want another kiss of his upon her
lips."It's--it's--like that," she said to herself."I want it to be from
somebody--else.Somebody that would make it
seem right."She felt that she
must get upon her own feet quickly and be under no obligation to any
man.Vaguely her stern New England rearing was beginning to indicate
the way that she should tread.No man or woman who did not understand
"the value of a dollar," was properly equipped to do battle with the
realities of life.The value of a dollar, and a clear title to
it--these were the principles upon which her integrity must be founded
if she were to survive her own self-respect.Her Puritan fathers had
bestowed this heritage upon her.She had always felt the irregularity
of her economic position; now that the complication of her relation
with David had arisen, it was beginning to make her truly
uncomfortable.David had been very considerate of her, but his consideration
frightened her.He had been so afraid that she might be hurt or
troubled by his attitude toward her that he had explained again, and
almost in so many words that he was only waiting for her to grow
accustomed to the idea before he asked her to become his wife.She had
looked forward with considerable trepidation to the Easter vacation
following the establishment of their one-sided understanding, but
David relieved her apprehension by putting up at his club and leaving
her in undisturbed possession of his quarters.There, with
Mademoiselle still treating her as a little girl, and the other five
of her heterogeneous foster family to pet and divert her at intervals,
she soon began to feel her life swing back into a more accustomed and
normal perspective.David's attitude to her was as simple as ever, and
when she was with the devoted sextet she was almost able to forget the
matter that was at issue between them--almost but not quite.She took quite a new kind of delight in her association with the
group.She found herself suddenly on terms of grown up equality with
them.Her consciousness of the fact that David was tacitly waiting
for her to become a woman, had made a woman of her already, and she
looked on her guardians with the eyes of a woman, even though a very
newly fledged and timorous one.She was a trifle self-conscious with the others, but with Jimmie she
was soon on her old familiar footing.*       *       *       *       *

"Uncle Jimmie is still a great deal of fun," she wrote in her diary."He does just the same old things he used to do with me, and a good
many new ones in addition.He brings me flowers, and gets me taxi-cabs
as if I were really a grown up young lady, and he pinches my nose and
teases me as if I were still the little girl that kept house in a
studio for him.I never realized before what a good-looking man he is.I used to think that Uncle Peter was the only handsome man of the
three, but now I realize that they are all exceptionally good-looking.Uncle David has a great deal of distinction, of course, but Uncle
Jimmie is merry and radiant and vital, and tall and athletic looking
into the bargain.The ladies on the Avenue all turn to look at him
when we go walking.He says that the gentlemen all turn to look at
me, and I think perhaps they do when I have my best clothes on, but in
my school clothes I am quite certain that nothing like that happens."I have been out with Uncle Jimmie Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday
and Friday,--four days of my vacation.We've been to the Hippodrome
and Chinatown, and we've dined at Sherry's, and one night we went down
to the little Italian restaurant where I had my first introduction to
_eau rougie_, and was so distressed about it.I shall never forget
that night, and I don't think Uncle Jimmie will ever be done teasing
me about it.It is nice to be with Uncle Jimmie so much, but I never
seem to see Uncle Peter any more.Alphonse is very careful about
taking messages, I know, but it does seem to me that Uncle Peter must
have telephoned more times than I know of.It does seem as if he
would, at least, try to see me long enough to have one of our old time
talks again.To see him with all the others about is only a very
little better than not seeing him at all.He isn't like himself,
someway.There is a shadow over him that I do not understand."*       *       *       *       *

"Don't you think that Uncle Peter has changed?"she asked Jimmie,
when the need of speaking of him became too strong to withstand."He is a little pale about the ears," Jimmie conceded, "but I think
that's the result of hard work and not enough exercise.He spends all
his spare time trying to patch up Beulah instead of tramping and
getting out on his horse the way he used to.He's doing a good job on
the old dear, but it's some job, nevertheless and notwithstanding--"

"Is Aunt Beulah feeling better than she was?"Eleanor's lips were dry,
but she did her best to make her voice sound natural.It seemed
strange that Jimmie could speak so casually of a condition of affairs
that made her very heart stand still."I didn't know that Uncle Peter
had been taking care of her.""Taking care of her isn't a circumstance to what Peter has been doing
for Beulah.You know she hasn't been right for some time.She got
burning wrong, like the flame on our old gas stove in the studio when
there was air in it.""Uncle David thought so the last time I was here," Eleanor said, "but
I didn't know that Uncle Peter--"

"Peter, curiously enough, was the last one to tumble.Dave and I got
alarmed about the girl and held a consultation, with the result that
Doctor Gramercy was called.If we'd believed he would go into it quite
so heavily we might have thought again before we sicked him on.It's
very nice for Mary Ann, but rather tough on Abraham as they said when
the lady was deposited on that already overcrowded bosom.Now Beulah's
got suffrage mania, and Peter's got Beulah mania, and it's a merry
mess all around."You haven't seen much of him since you came, have
you?--Well, the reason is that every afternoon as soon as he can get
away from the office, he puts on a broad sash marked 'Votes for
Women,' and trundles Beulah around in her little white and green
perambulator, trying to distract her mind from suffrage while he talks
to her gently and persuasively upon the subject.Suffrage is the only
subject on her mind, he explains, so all he can do is to try to cuckoo
gently under it day by day.It's a very complicated process but he's
making headway.""I'm glad of that," Eleanor said faintly."How--how is Aunt Gertrude?I don't see her very often, either."It was Jimmie's turn to look self-conscious."She never has time for me any more; I'm not high-brow enough for her.She's getting on like a streak, you know, exhibiting everywhere."She gave me a cast of her faun's head."She is, I guess, but don't let's waste all our valuable time talking
about the family.Let's talk about us--you and me.You ask me how I'm
feeling and then I'll tell you.Then I'll ask you how you're feeling
and you'll tell me.Then I'll tell you how I imagine you must be
feeling from the way you're looking,--and that will give me a chance
to expatiate on the delectability of your appearance.I'll work up
delicately to the point where you will begin to compare me favorably
with all the other nice young men you know,--and then we'll be off."Eleanor asked, beginning to sparkle a little."We shall indeed," he assured her solemnly.No, on second
thoughts, I'll begin.I'll begin at the place where I start telling
you how excessively well you're looking.I don't know, considering its
source, whether it would interest you or not, but you have the biggest
blue eyes that I've, ever seen in all my life,--and I'm rather a judge
of them.""All the better to eat you with, my dear," Eleanor chanted.He shot her a queer glance from under his eyebrows."I don't feel very safe when I look into them, my child.It would be a
funny joke on me if they did prove fatal to me, wouldn't
it?--well,--but away with such nonsense.I mustn't blither to the very
babe whose cradle I am rocking, must I?""I'm not a babe, Uncle Jimmie.Peter says
that you even disconcert him at times, when you take to remembering
things out of your previous experience.""'When he was a King in Babylon and I was a Christian Slave?'"Only I'd prefer to play the part of the King of Babylon, if
it's all the same to you, niecelet.How does the rest of it go, 'yet
not for a--' something or other 'would I wish undone that deed beyond
the grave.'Gosh, my dear, if things were otherwise, I think I could
understand how that feller felt.Get on your hat, and let's get out
into the open.My soul is cramped with big potentialities this
afternoon.I wish you hadn't grown up, Eleanor.You are taking my
breath away in a peculiar manner.No man likes to have his breath
taken away so suddint like.Let's get out into the rolling prairie of
Central Park."But the rest of the afternoon was rather a failure.The Park had that
peculiar bleakness that foreruns the first promise of spring.The
children, that six weeks before were playing in the snow and six weeks
later would be searching the turf for dandelions, were in the listless
between seasons state of comparative inactivity.There was a deceptive
balminess in the air that seemed merely to overlay a penetrating
chilliness."I'm sorry I'm not more entertaining this afternoon," Jimmie
apologized on the way home."It isn't that I am not happy, or that I
don't feel the occasion to be more than ordinarily propitious; I'm
silent upon a peak in Darien,--that's all.""I was thinking of something else, too," Eleanor said."I didn't say I was thinking of something else.""People are always thinking of something else when they aren't talking
to each other, aren't they?""Something else, or each other, Eleanor.I wasn't thinking of
something else, I was thinking--well, I won't tell you exactly--at
present."A penny is a good deal of money."I'm afraid I couldn't--buy joy, even if you gave me your penny, Uncle
Jimmie."My penny might not be like other pennies.On the other
hand, your thoughts might be worth a fortune to me.""I'm afraid they wouldn't be worth anything to anybody.""You simply don't know what I am capable of making out of them.""I wish I could make something out of them," Eleanor said so
miserably that Jimmie was filled with compunction for having tired her
out, and hailed a passing taxi in which to whiz her home again.*       *       *       *       *

"I have found out that Uncle Peter is spending all his time with Aunt
Beulah," she wrote in her diary that evening."It is beautiful of him
to try to help her through this period of nervous collapse, and just
like him, but I don't understand why it is that he doesn't come and
tell me about it, especially since he is getting so tired.He ought to
know that I love him so dearly and deeply that I could help him even
in helping her.It isn't like him not to share his anxieties with me.Aunt Beulah is a grown up woman, and has friends and doctors and
nurses, and every one knows her need.It seems to me that he might
think that I have no one but him, and that whatever might lie heavy on
my heart I could only confide in him.Why doesn't it occur to him that I might have something to
tell him now?He needs a good deal of exercise to
keep in form.If he doesn't have a certain amount of muscular
activity his digestion is not so good.There are two little creases
between his eyes that I never remember seeing there before.I asked
him the other night when he was here with Aunt Beulah if his head
ached, and he said 'no,' but Aunt Beulah said her head ached almost
all the time.Of course, Aunt Beulah is important, and if Uncle Peter
is trying to bring her back to normality again she is important to
him, and that makes her important to me for his sake also, but nobody
in the world is worth the sacrifice of Uncle Peter."I suppose it's a part of his great beauty that he should think so
disparagingly of himself.I might not love him so well if he knew just
how dear and sweet and great his personality is.It isn't so much what
he says or does, or even the way he looks that constitutes his charm,
it's the simple power and radiance behind his slightest move.He doesn't think he is especially fine or beautiful.He doesn't know what a waste it is when he spends his strength upon
somebody who isn't as noble in character as he is,--but I know, and it
makes me wild to think of it.My
vacation is almost over, and I don't see how I could bear going back
to school without one comforting hour of him alone."I intended to write a detailed account of my vacation, but I can not.Uncle Jimmie has certainly tried to make me happy.I could have so much fun with him if I were not worried about
Uncle Peter!"Uncle David says he wants to spend my last evening with me.We are
going to dine here, and then go to the theater together.I am going to
try to tell him how I feel about things, but I am afraid he won't give
me the chance.Life is a strange mixture of things you want and can't
have, and things you can have and don't want.It seems almost disloyal
to put that down on paper about Uncle David.I do want him and love
him, but oh!--not in that way.There is only one
person in a woman's life that she can feel that way about.Why--why--why doesn't my Uncle Peter come to me?"CHAPTER XX

THE MAKINGS OF A TRIPLE WEDDING


"Just by way of formality," David said, "and not because I think any
one present"--he smiled on the five friends grouped about his dinner
table--"still takes our old resolution seriously, I should like to be
released from the anti-matrimonial pledge that I signed eight years
ago this November.I have no announcement to make as yet, but when I
do wish to make an announcement--and I trust to have the permission
granted very shortly--I want to be sure of my technical right to do
so."Jimmie exclaimed in a tone of such genuine
confusion that it raised a shout of laughter."I never signed any pledge to that effect.""We left you out of it, Old Horse, regarding you as a congenital
celibate anyway," Jimmie answered."Some day soon you will understand how much you wronged me," Peter
said with a covert glance at Beulah."I wish I could say as much," Jimmie sighed, "since this is the hour
of confession I don't mind adding that I hope I may be able to soon."Gertrude clapped her hands softly."We've the makings of a triple
wedding in our midst.Look into the blushing faces before us and hear
the voice that breathed o'er Eden echoing in our ears.This is the
most exciting moment of my life!Girls, get on your feet and drink to
the health of these about-to-be Benedicts.Up in your chairs,--one
slipper on the table.Gertrude had seen Margaret's sudden pallor and heard the convulsive
catching of her breath,--Margaret rising Undine-like out of a filmy,
pale green frock, with her eyes set a little more deeply in the
shadows than usual.Her quick instinct to the rescue was her own
salvation."On behalf of my coadjutors," he said, "I thank you.All this is
extremely premature for me, and I imagine from the confusion of the
other gentlemen present it is as much, if not more so, for them.Personally I regret exceedingly being unable to take you more fully
into my confidence.The only reason for this partial revelation is
that I wished to be sure that I was honorably released from my oath of
abstinence.You fellows say something," he concluded,
sinking abruptly into his chair."Your style always was distinctly mid-Victorian," Jimmie murmured."I've got nothing to say, except that I wish I had something to say
and that if I _do_ have something to say in the near future I'll
create a real sensation!When Miss Van Astorbilt permits David to link
her name with his in the caption under a double column cut in our
leading journals, you'll get nothing like the thrill that I expect to
create with my modest announcement.I've got a real romance up my
sleeve."There is no Van Astorbilt in mine.""The lady won't give me her permission to speak," Peter said."She
knows how proud and happy I shall be when I am able to do so.""It is better we should marry," she said."I didn't realize that when
I exacted that oath from you.It is from the intellectual type that
the brains to carry on the great work of the world must be
inherited."I'll destroy it to-night and then we may all consider
ourselves free to take any step that we see fit.It was really only as
a further protection to Eleanor that we signed it.""Eleanor will be surprised, won't she?"Three
self-conscious masculine faces met her innocent interrogation."_Eleanor_," Margaret breathed, "_Eleanor_.""I rather think she will," Jimmie chuckled irresistibly, but David
said nothing, and Peter stared unseeingly into the glass he was still
twirling on its stem."Eleanor will be taken care of just the same," Beulah said decisively."I don't think we need even go through the formality of a vote on
that.""Eleanor will be taken care of," David said softly.The Hutchinsons' limousine--old Grandmother Hutchinson had a motor
nowadays--was calling for Margaret, and she was to take the two other
girls home.David and Jimmie--such is the nature of men--were
disappointed in not being able to take Margaret and Gertrude
respectively under their accustomed protection."I wanted to talk to you, Gertrude," Jimmie said reproachfully as she
slipped away from his ingratiating hand on her arm."I thought I should take you home to-night, Margaret," David said;
"you never gave me the slip before.""The old order changeth," Gertrude replied lightly to them both, as
she preceded Margaret into the luxurious interior."It's Eleanor," Gertrude announced as the big car swung into Fifth
Avenue."Jimmie or David--or--or both are going to marry Eleanor.Didn't you
see their faces when Beulah spoke of her?""David wants to marry Eleanor," Margaret said quietly."I've known it
all winter--without realizing what it was I knew.""Well, who is Jimmy going to marry then?""Who is Peter going to marry for that matter?"it doesn't make any difference,--we're losing them just the same.""No matter what combinations come
about, we shall still have an indestructible friendship.""Indestructible friendship--shucks," Gertrude cried."The boys are
going to be married--married--married!Marriage is the one thing that
indestructible friendships don't survive--except as ghosts.""It should be Peter who is going to marry Eleanor," Margaret said."It's Peter who has always loved her best."As a friend," Beulah said, "as her dearest friend.""Not as a friend," Margaret answered softly, "she loves him."I believe it," Gertrude said.Of
course, it must be Peter who is going to marry her.""If it isn't we've succeeded in working out a rather tragic
experiment," Margaret said, "haven't we?""Life is a tragic experiment for any woman," Gertrude said
sententiously."Peter doesn't intend to marry Eleanor," Beulah persisted."Do you happen to know who he is going to marry?""Yes, I do know, but I--I can't tell you yet.""Whoever it is, it's a mistake," Margaret said."It's our little
Eleanor he wants.I suppose he doesn't realize it himself yet, and
when he does it will be too late.He's probably gone and tied himself
up with somebody entirely unsuitable, hasn't he, Beulah?""I don't know," Beulah said; "perhaps he has.I hadn't thought of it
that way.""It's the way to think of it, I know."Margaret's eyes filled with
sudden tears."But whatever he's done it's past mending now.There'll
be no question of Peter's backing out of a bargain--bad or good, and
our poor little kiddie's got to suffer.""Beulah took it hard," Gertrude commented, as they turned up-town
again after dropping their friend at her door.The two girls were
spending the night together at Margaret's.I think besides being devoted to Eleanor, she feels terrifically
responsible for her.I can't pretend to think of anything else,--who--who--who--are
our boys going to marry?""I don't know, Gertrude.""I always thought that you and David--"

Margaret met her eyes bravely but she did not answer the implicit
question."I always thought that you and Jimmie--" she said presently.Gertrude, you would have been so good for him."it's all over now," Gertrude said, "but I didn't know that a
living soul suspected me."Gertrude whispered as they clung to each
other.I've never seen any one else whom I thought that of.I--I was so
used to him.""That's the rub," Gertrude said, "we're so used to them.They're
so--so preposterously necessary to us."Late that night clasped in each other's arms they admitted the extent
of their desolation.Life had been robbed of a magic,--a mystery.The
solid friendship of years of mutual trust and understanding was the
background of so much lovely folly, so many unrealized possibilities,
so many nebulous desires and dreams that the sudden dissolution of
their circle was an unthinkable calamity."We ought to have put out our hands and taken them if we wanted them,"
Gertrude said, out of the darkness.They need to be firmly
turned in the right direction instead of being given their heads."I wouldn't pay that price for love," Margaret said.By
the time I had made it happen I wouldn't want it.""That's my trouble too," Gertrude said.Then she turned over on her
pillow and sobbed helplessly."Jimmie had such ducky little curls,"
she explained incoherently."I do this sometimes when I think of them.Margaret put out a hand to her; but long after Gertrude's breath began
to rise and fall regularly, she lay staring wide-eyed into the
darkness.CHAPTER XXI

ELEANOR HEARS THE NEWS


"Dear Uncle Jimmie:

"I said I would write you, but now that I have taken this hour in
which to do it, I find it is a very, very hard letter that I have got
to write.In the first place I can't believe that the things you said
to me that night were real, or that you were awake and in the world of
realities when you said them.I felt as if we were both dreaming; that
you were talking as a man does sometimes in delirium when he believes
the woman he loves to be by his side, and I was listening the same
way.It made me very happy, as dreams sometimes do.I can't help
feeling that your idea of me is a dream idea, and the pain that you
said this kind of a letter would give you will be merely dream pain.It is a shock to wake up in the morning and find that all the lovely
ways we felt, and delicately beautiful things we had, were only dream
things that we wouldn't even understand if we were thoroughly awake."In the second place, you can't want to marry your little niecelet,
the funny little 'kiddo,' that used to burn her fingers and the
beefsteak over that old studio gas stove.We had such lovely kinds of
make-believe together.That's what our association always ought to
mean to us,--just chumship, and wonderful and preposterous _pretends_.I couldn't think of myself being married to you any more than I could
Jack the giant killer, or Robinson Crusoe.You're my truly best and
dearest childhood's playmate, and that is a great deal to be, Uncle
Jimmie.I don't think a little girl ever grows up quite _whole_ unless
she has somewhere, somehow, what I had in you.You wouldn't want to
marry Alice in Wonderland, now would you?There are some kinds of
playmates that can't marry each other.I think that you and I are that
kind, Uncle Jimmie."My dear, my dear, don't let this hurt you.How can it hurt you, when
I am only your little adopted foster child that you have helped
support and comfort and make a beautiful, glad life for?I love you so
much,--you are so precious to me that you _must_ wake up out of this
distorted, though lovely dream that I was present at!Nobody can break our hearts if we are strong
enough to withhold them.Nobody can hurt us too much if we can find
the way to be our bravest all the time.I know that what you are
feeling now is not real.I can't tell you how I know, but I do know
the difference.They could be pulled up
without too terrible a havoc."Uncle Jimmie, dear, believe me, believe me.I said this would be a
hard letter to write, and it has been.If you could see my poor
inkstained, weeping face, you would realize that I am only your funny
little Eleanor after all, and not to be taken seriously at all.I hope
you will come up for my graduation.When you see me with all the other
lumps and frumps that are here, you will know that I am not worth
considering except as a kind of human joke."Good-by, dear, my dear, and God bless you.*       *       *       *       *

It was less than a week after this letter to Jimmie that Margaret
spending a week-end in a town in Connecticut adjoining that in which
Eleanor's school was located, telephoned Eleanor to join her
overnight at the inn where she was staying.She had really planned the
entire expedition for the purpose of seeing Eleanor and preparing her
for the revelations that were in store for her, though she was
ostensibly meeting a motoring party, with which she was going on into
the Berkshires.She started in abruptly, as was her way, over the salad and cheese in
the low studded Arts and Crafts dining-room of the fashionable road
house, contrived to look as self-conscious as a pretty woman in new
sporting clothes."Your Uncle David and your Uncle Jimmie are going to be married," she
told her."No, I didn't," Eleanor said faintly, but she grew suddenly very
white.David gave a dinner party one night last
week in his studio, and announced his intentions, but we don't know
the name of the lady yet, and we can't guess it.He says it is not a
society girl.""Who do you think it is, Eleanor?""I--I can't think, Aunt Margaret.""We don't know who Jimmie is marrying either.The facts were merely
insinuated, but he said we should have the shock of our lives when we
knew.""Perhaps he has changed his mind by now," Eleanor said.Don't you think it might be that they both just
thought they were going to marry somebody--that really doesn't want to
marry them?It might be all a mistake, you know.""I don't think it's a mistake.Margaret found the rest of her story harder to tell than she had
anticipated.Eleanor, wrapped in the formidable aloofness of the
sensitive young, was already suffering from the tale she had come to
tell,--why, it was not so easy to determine.It might be merely from
the pang of being shut out from confidences that she felt should have
been shared with her at once.She waited until they were both ready for bed (their rooms were
connecting)--Eleanor in the straight folds of her white dimity
nightgown, and her two golden braids making a picture that lingered in
Margaret's memory for many years."It would have been easier to tell
her in her street clothes," she thought."I wish her profile were not
so perfect, or her eyes were shallower.How can I hurt such a lovely
thing?""Are the ten Hutchinsons all right?""The ten Hutchinsons are very much all right.They like me better now
that I have grown a nice hard Hutchinson shell that doesn't show my
feelings through.Haven't you noticed how much more like other people
I've grown, Eleanor?""You've grown nicer, and dearer and sweeter, but I don't think you're
very much like anybody else, Aunt Margaret.""I have though,--every one notices it.You haven't asked me anything
about Peter yet," she added suddenly.The lovely color glowed in Eleanor's cheeks for an instant."I haven't heard from him for a
long time.""Yes, he's well," Margaret said."He's looking better than he was for
a while.He had some news to tell us too, Eleanor."He
said that he hadn't the consent of the lady to mention her name yet.We're as much puzzled about him as we are about the other two.""It's Aunt Beulah," Eleanor said.She sat upright on the edge of the bed and stared straight ahead of
her.Margaret watched the light and life and youth die out of the face
and a pitiful ashen pallor overspread it."I don't think it's Beulah," Margaret said."Beulah knows who it is,
but I never thought of it's being Beulah herself.""If she knows--then she's the one.He wouldn't have told her first if
she hadn't been.""Don't let it hurt you too much, dear.Gertrude--and me, too, Eleanor.It's--it's pain to us all.""Do you mean--Uncle David, Aunt Margaret?""Yes, dear," Margaret smiled at her bravely."And does Aunt Gertrude care about Uncle Jimmie?""She has for a good many years, I think.""I didn't know that," she said.She
pushed Margaret's arm away from her gently, but her breath came hard."Don't touch me," she cried, "I can't bear it.You might not want
to--if you knew.As Margaret closed the door gently between them, she saw Eleanor throw
her head back, and push the back of her hand hard against her mouth,
as if to stifle the rising cry of her anguish.*       *       *       *       *

The next morning Eleanor was gone.Margaret had listened for hours in
the night but had heard not so much as the rustle of a garment from
the room beyond.Toward morning she had fallen into the sleep of
exhaustion.It was then that the stricken child had made her escape."Miss Hamlin had found that she must take the early train," the clerk
said, "and left this note for Miss Hutchinson."It was like Eleanor to
do things decently and in order.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Aunt Margaret," her letter ran."My grandmother used to say that
some people were trouble breeders.On thinking it over I am afraid
that is just about what I am,--a trouble breeder."I've been a worry and bother and care to you all since the beginning,
and I have repaid all your kindness by bringing trouble upon you.I don't think I have any right to
tell you exactly in this letter.I can only pray that it will be found
to be all a mistake, and come out right in the end.Surely such
beautiful people as you and Uncle David can find the way to each
other, and can help Uncle Jimmie and Aunt Gertrude, who are a little
blinder about life.Surely, when the stumbling block is out of the
way, you four will walk together beautifully.Please try, Aunt
Margaret, to make things as right as if I had never helped them to go
wrong.I was so young, I didn't know how to manage.I shall never be
that kind of young again."You know the other reason why I am going.Please do not let any one
else know.If the others could think I had met with some accident,
don't you think that would be the wisest way?I would like to arrange
it so they wouldn't try to find me at all, but would just mourn for me
naturally for a little while.I thought of sticking my old cap in the
river, but I was afraid that would be too hard for you.There won't be
any use in trying to find me.I couldn't
ever bear seeing one of your faces again.Don't let Uncle Peter _know_, please, Aunt Margaret.I don't want him
to know,--I don't want to hurt him, and I don't want him to know.Good-by, my dears, my dearests.I
have taken all of my allowance money.CHAPTER XXII

THE SEARCH


Eleanor had not bought a ticket at the station, Margaret ascertained,
but the ticket agent had tried to persuade her to.She had thanked him
and told him that she preferred to buy it of the conductor.He was a
lank, saturnine individual and had been seriously smitten with
Eleanor's charms, it appeared, and the extreme solicitousness of his
attitude at the suggestion of any mystery connected with her departure
made Margaret realize the caution with which it would be politic to
proceed.She had very little hope of finding Eleanor back at the
school, but it was still rather a shock when she telephoned the school
office and found that there was no news of her there.She concocted a
somewhat lame story to account for Eleanor's absence and promised the
authorities that she would be sent back to them within the week,--a
promise she was subsequently obliged to acknowledge that she could not
keep.Then she fled to New York to break the disastrous news to the
others.She told Gertrude the truth and showed her the pitiful letter Eleanor
had left behind her, and together they wept over it.Also together,
they faced David and Jimmie."She went away," Margaret told them, "both because she felt she was
hurting those that she loved and because she herself was hurt.""I mean--that she belonged body and soul to Peter and to nobody else,"
Margaret answered deliberately."If that is true," he said, "then I am largely responsible for her
going.""It is I who am responsible," Jimmie groaned aloud."I asked her to
marry me and she refused me.""I asked her to marry me and didn't give her the chance to refuse,"
David said; "it is that she is running away from.""It was Peter's engagement that was the last straw," Margaret said."The poor baby withered and shrank like a flower in the blast when I
told her that.""The damned hound--" Jimmie said feelingly and without apology."Eleanor says it's Beulah, and the more I think of it the more I think
that she's probably right.""That would be a nice mess, wouldn't it?""Remember how frank we were with her about his probable lack of
judgment, Margaret?I don't covet the sweet job of breaking it to
either one of them."Nevertheless she assisted Margaret to break it to them both late that
same afternoon at Beulah's apartment."I'll find her," Peter said briefly.And in response to the halting
explanation of her disappearance that Margaret and Gertrude had done
their best to try to make plausible, despite its elliptical nature, he
only said, "I don't see that it makes any difference why she's gone.She's gone, that's the thing that's important.No matter how hard we
try we can't really figure out her reason till we find her.""Are you sure it's going to be so easy?"She's a pretty determined little person when she
makes up her mind.Eleanor's threats are to be taken seriously."I'll find her if she's anywhere in the world," Peter said."I'll find
her and bring her back.""I believe that you will," she said."Find out the reason that she
went away, too, Peter."Beulah pulled Gertrude aside."She had some one else
on her mind, hadn't she?""She had something else on her mind," Gertrude answered gravely, "but
she had Peter on her mind, too.""She didn't--she couldn't have known about us--Peter and me.We--we
haven't told any one."It's
just one of God's most satirical mix-ups.""I was to blame," Beulah said slowly."I don't believe in shifting
responsibility.I got her here in the first place and I've been
instrumental in guiding her life ever since.Now, I've sacrificed her
to my own happiness.""It isn't so simple as that," Gertrude said; "the things we start
going soon pass out of our hands.Somebody a good deal higher up has
been directing Eleanor's affairs for a long time,--and ours too, for
that matter.""Don't worry, Beulah," Peter said, making his way to her side from the
other corner of the room where he had been talking to Margaret."You
mustn't let this worry you.We've all got to be--soldiers now,--but
we'll soon have her back again, I promise you.""And I promise you," Beulah said chokingly, "that if you'll get her
back again, I--I will be a soldier."*       *       *       *       *

Peter began by visiting the business schools in New York and finding
out the names of the pupils registered there.Eleanor had clung firmly
to her idea of becoming an editorial stenographer in some magazine
office, no matter how hard he had worked to dissuade her.He felt
almost certain she would follow out that purpose now.There was a fund
in her name started some years before for the defraying of her college
expenses.She would use that, he argued, to get herself started, even
though she felt constrained to pay it back later on.He worked on this
theory for some time, even making a trip to Boston in search for her
in the stenography classes there, but nothing came of it.Among Eleanor's effects sent on from the school was a little red
address book containing the names and addresses of many of her former
schoolmates at Harmon.Peter wrote all the girls he remembered hearing
her speak affectionately of, but not one of them was able to give him
any news of her.He wrote to Colhassett to Albertina's aunt, who had
served in the capacity of housekeeper to Eleanor's grandfather in his
last days, and got in reply a pious letter from Albertina herself, who
intimated that she had always suspected that Eleanor would come to
some bad end, and that now she was highly soothed and gratified by the
apparent fulfillment of her sinister prognostications.Later he tried private detectives, and, not content with their
efforts, he followed them over the ground that they covered, searching
through boarding houses, and public classes of all kinds; canvassing
the editorial offices of the various magazines Eleanor had admired in
the hope of discovering that she had applied for some small position
there; following every clue that his imagination, and the acumen of
the professionals in his service, could supply;--but his patient
search was unrewarded.Eleanor had apparently vanished from the
surface of the earth.The quest which had seemed to him so simple a
matter when he first undertook it, now began to assume terrible and
abortive proportions.It was unthinkable that one little slip of a
girl untraveled and inexperienced should be able permanently to elude
six determined and worldly adult New Yorkers, who were prepared to tax
their resources to the utmost in the effort to find her,--but the fact
remained that she was missing and continued to be missing, and the
cruel month went by and brought them no news of her.Apart from the emotions
that had been precipitated by her developing charms, they loved her
dearly as the child they had taken to their hearts and bestowed all
their young enthusiasm and energy and tenderness upon.She was the
living clay, as Gertrude had said so many years before, that they had
molded as nearly as possible to their hearts' desire.They loved her
for herself, but one and all they loved her for what they had made of
her--an exquisite, lovely young creature, at ease in a world that
might so easily have crushed her utterly if they had not intervened
for her.They kept up the search unremittingly, following false leads and
meeting with heartbreaking discouragements and disappointments.Only
Margaret had any sense of peace about her."I'm sure she's all right," she said; "I feel it.It's hard having her
gone, but I'm not afraid for her.She'll work it out better than we
could help her to.It's a beautiful thing to be young and strong and
free, and she'll get the beauty out of it.""I think perhaps you're right, Margaret," David said.It's the bread and butter end of the problem that worries
me.""He'll provide for our ewe lamb, I'm
sure.""You speak as if you had it on direct authority.""I think perhaps I have," she said gravely.Jimmie and Gertrude grew closer together as the weeks passed, and the
strain of their fruitless quest continued.One day Jimmie showed her
the letter that Eleanor had written him.he said, as Gertrude returned it to him, smiling
through her tears."She's a darling," Gertrude said fervently."Did she hurt you so much,
Jimmie dear?""I wanted her," Jimmie answered slowly, "but I think it was because I
thought she was mine,--that I could make her mine.When I found she
was Peter's,--had been Peter's all the time, the thought somehow cured
me.I made it up out of the stuff that
dreams are made of.God knows I love her, but--but that personal thing
has gone out of it.She's my little lost child,--or my sister.A man
wants his own to be his own, Gertrude.""My--my real trouble is that I'm at sea again.I thought that I
cared,--that I was anchored for good.It's the drifting that plays the
deuce with me.If the thought of that sweet child and the grief at her
loss can't hold me, what can?"I don't know," Gertrude laughed.You've always been on to me, Gertrude, too much so
to have any respect for me, I guess.You've got your work," he waved
his arm at the huge cast under the shadow of which they were sitting,
"and all this.You can put all your human longings into it.I'm a poor
rudderless creature without any hope or direction.""You don't know it," he said, with an effort to conceal
the fact that his shoulders were shaking, "but you see before you a
human soul in the actual process of dissolution."Gertrude crossed her studio floor to kneel down beside him.She drew
the boyish head, rumpled into an irresistible state of curliness, to
her breast."Put it here where it belongs," she said softly."I snitched him," Gertrude confided to Margaret some days later,--her
whole being radiant and transfigured with happiness.CHAPTER XXIII

THE YOUNG NURSE


The local hospital of the village of Harmonville, which was ten miles
from Harmon proper, where the famous boarding-school for young ladies
was located, presented an aspect so far from institutional that but
for the sign board tacked modestly to an elm tree just beyond the
break in the hedge that constituted the main entrance, the gracious,
old colonial structure might have been taken for the private residence
for which it had served so many years.It was a crisp day in late September, and a pale yellow sun was spread
thin over the carpet of yellow leaves with which the wide lawn was
covered.In the upper corridor of the west wing, grouped about the
window-seat with their embroidery or knitting, the young nurses were
talking together in low tones during the hour of the patients'
siestas.The two graduates, dark-eyed efficient girls, with skilled
delicate fingers taking precise stitches in the needlework before
them, were in full uniform, but the younger girls clustered about
them, beginners for the most part, but a few months in training, were
dressed in the simple blue print, and little white caps and aprons, of
the probationary period.A light breeze blew in at
the window and stirred a straying lock or two that escaped the
starched band of a confining cap.Outside the stinging whistle of the
insect world was interrupted now and then by the cough of a passing
motor.From the doors opening on the corridor an occasional restless
moan indicated the inability of some sufferer to take his dose of
oblivion according to schedule.Presently a bell tinkled a summons to
the patient in the first room on the right--a gentle little old lady
who had just had her appendix removed."Will you take that, Miss Hamlin?"the nurse in charge of the case
asked the tallest and fairest of the young assistants.Eleanor, demure in cap and kerchief as the most ravishing
of young Priscillas, rose obediently at the request."May I read to
her a little if she wants me to?""Yes, if you keep the door closed.I think most of the others are
sleeping."The little old lady who had just had her appendix out, smiled weakly
up at Eleanor."I hoped 'twould be you," she said, "and then after I'd rung I lay in
fear and trembling lest one o' them young flipperti-gibbets should
come, and get me all worked up while she was trying to shift me.I
want to be turned the least little mite on my left side."Eleanor asked, as she made the adjustment."I dunno whether that's better, or whether it just seems better to me,
because 'twas you that fixed me," the little old lady said."You
certainly have got a soothin' and comfortin' way with you.""I used to take care of my grandmother years ago, and the more
hospital work I do, the more it comes back to me,--and the better I
remember the things that she liked to have done for her.""There's nobody like your own kith and kin," the little old lady
sighed.That other nurse--that black
haired one--she said you was an orphan, alone in the world.Well, I
pity a young girl alone in the world.""It's all right to be alone in the world--if you just keep busy
enough," Eleanor said."But you mustn't talk any more.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.I'm going to
give you your medicine and then sit here and read to you."*       *       *       *       *

On the morning of her flight from the inn, after a night spent staring
motionless into the darkness, Eleanor took the train to the town some
dozen miles beyond Harmonville, where her old friend Bertha Stephens
lived.To "Stevie," to whom the duplicity of Maggie Lou had served to
draw her very close in the ensuing year, she told a part of her story.Stephens, whose husband was on
the board of directors of the Harmonville hospital, that Eleanor had
been admitted there.She had resolutely put all her old life behind
her.The plan to take up a course in stenography and enter an
editorial office was to have been, as a matter of course, a part of
her life closely associated with Peter.Losing him, there was nothing
left of her dream of high adventure and conquest.There was merely the
hurt desire to hide herself where she need never trouble him again,
and where she could be independent and useful.Having no idea of her
own value to her guardians, or the integral tenderness in which she
was held, she sincerely believed that her disappearance must have
relieved them of much chagrin and embarrassment.She had the
temperament that finds a virtue in the day's work, and a balm in its
mere iterative quality.Her sympathy and intelligence made her a good
nurse and her adaptability, combined with her loveliness, a general
favorite.She spent her days off at the Stephens' home.Bertha Stephens had been
the one girl that Peter had failed to write to, when he began to
circulate his letters of inquiry.Her name had been set down in the
little red book, but he remembered the trouble that Maggie Lou had
precipitated, and arrived at the conclusion that the intimacy existing
between Eleanor and Bertha had not survived it.Except that Carlo
Stephens persisted in trying to make love to her, and Mrs.Stephens
covertly encouraged his doing so, Eleanor found the Stephens' home a
very comforting haven.Bertha had developed into a full breasted,
motherly looking girl, passionately interested in all vicarious
love-affairs, though quickly intimidated at the thought of having any
of her own.She was devoted to Eleanor, and mothered her clumsily.It was still to her diary that Eleanor turned for the relief and
solace of self-expression.*       *       *       *       *

"It is five months to-day," she wrote, "since I came to the hospital.I like it, but I feel like the little old
woman on the King's Highway.I doubt more every minute if this can be
I. Sometimes I wonder what 'being I' consists of, anyway.I used to
feel as if I were divided up into six parts as separate as
protoplasmic cells, and that each one was looked out for by a
different cooperative parent.I thought that I would truly be I when I
got them all together, and looked out for them myself, but I find I am
no more of an entity than I ever was.The puzzling question of 'what
am I?'still persists, and I am farther away from the right answer
than ever.Would a sound be a sound if there were no one to hear it?If the waves of vibration struck no human ear, would the sound be in
existence at all?This is the problem propounded by one of the nurses
yesterday."How much of us lives when we are entirely shut out of the
consciousness of those whom we love?If there is no one to _realize_
us day by day,--if all that love has made of us is taken away, what is
left?I look in the glass, and see
the same face,--Eleanor Hamlin, almost nineteen, with the same bow
shaped eyebrows, and the same double ridge leading up from her nose to
her mouth, making her look still very babyish.I pinch myself, and
find that it hurts just the same as it used to six months ago, but
there the resemblance to what I used to be, stops.I'm a young nurse
now in hospital training, and very good at it, too, if I do say it as
shouldn't; but that's all I am.Otherwise, I'm not anybody _to_
anybody,--except a figure of romance to good old Stevie, who doesn't
count in this kind of reckoning.I take naturally to nursing they tell
me.A nurse is a kind of maternal automaton.I'm glad I'm that, but
there used to be a lot more of me than that.There ought to be some
heart and brain and soul left over, but there doesn't seem to be.Perhaps I am like the Princess in the fairy story whose heart was an
auk's egg.Nobody had power to make her feel unless they reached it
and squeezed it."I feel sometimes as if I were dead.I wish I could know whether Uncle
Peter and Aunt Beulah were married yet.There is a woman in this hospital whose suitor married some one else,
and she has nervous prostration, and melancholia.All she does all day
is to moan and wring her hands and call out his name.They seem to think that it is disgraceful to
love a man so much that your whole life stops as soon as he goes out
of it.What of Juliet and Ophelia and Francesca de Rimini?They loved
so they could not tear their love out of their hearts without
lacerating them forever.There is that kind of love in the
world,--bigger than life itself.All the big tragedies of literature
were made from it,--why haven't people more sympathy for it?Why isn't
there more dignity about it in the eyes of the world?"It is very unlucky to love, and to lose that which you cherish, but
it is unluckier still never to know the meaning of love, or to find
'Him whom your soul loveth.'I try to be kind to that poor forsaken
woman.I am sorry for his sake that she calls out his name, but she
seems to be in such torture of mind and body that she is unable to
help it."They are trying to cut down expenses here, so they have no regular
cook, the housekeeper and her helper are supposed to do it all.I said
I would make the desserts, so now I have got to go down-stairs and
make some fruit gelatin.It is best that I should not write any more
to-day, anyway."*       *       *       *       *

Later, after the Thanksgiving holiday, she wrote:

                  *       *       *       *       *

"I saw a little boy butchered to-day, and I shall never forget it.It
is wicked to speak of Doctor Blake's clean cut work as butchery, but
when you actually see a child's leg severed from its body, what else
can you call it?"The reason that I am able to go through operations without fainting
or crying is just this: _other people do_.The first time I stood by
the operating table to pass the sterilized instruments to the
assisting nurse, and saw the half naked doctors hung in rubber
standing there preparing to carve their way through the naked flesh of
the unconscious creature before them, I felt the kind of pang pass
through my heart that seems to kill as it comes.I thought I died, or
was dying,--and then I looked up and saw that every one else was ready
for their work.So I drew a deep breath and became ready too.I don't
think there is anything in the world too hard to do if you look at it
that way."The little boy loved me and I loved him.We had hoped against hope
that we would be able to save his poor little leg, but it had to go.I
held his hand while they gave him the chloroform.At his head sat
Doctor Hathaway with his Christlike face, draped in the robe of the
anesthetist.'Take long breaths, Benny,' I said, and he breathed in
bravely.To-morrow, when he is really out of the
ether, I have got to tell him what was done to him.Something happened
to me while that operation was going on.I think
the spirit of the one who was his mother passed into me, and I knew
what it would be like to be the mother of a son.Benny was not without
what his mother would have felt for him if she had been at his side.I can't explain it, but that is what I felt."To-night it is as black as ink outside.I feel as
if there should be no stars.If there were, there might be some
strange little bit of comfort in them that I could cling to.I do not
want any comfort from outside to shine upon me to-night.I have got to
draw all my strength from a source within, and I feel it welling up
within me even now."I wonder if I have been selfish to leave the people I love so long
without any word of me.I think Aunt Gertrude and Aunt Beulah and Aunt
Margaret all had a mother feeling for me.I am remembering to-night
how anxious they used to be for me to have warm clothing, and to keep
my feet dry, and not to work too hard at school.All those things that
I took as a matter of course, I realize now were very significant and
beautiful.If I had a child and did not know to-night where it would
lie down to sleep, or on what pillow it would put its head, I know my
own rest would be troubled.I wonder if I have caused any one of my
dear mothers to feel like that.If I have, it has been very wicked and
cruel of me."CHAPTER XXIV

CHRISTMAS AGAIN


The ten Hutchinsons having left the library entirely alone in the hour
before dinner, David and Margaret had appropriated it and were sitting
companionably together on the big couch drawn up before the fireplace,
where a log was trying to consume itself unscientifically head first."I would stay to dinner if urged," David suggested."You stay," Margaret agreed laconically.She moved away from him, relaxing rather limply in the corner of the
couch, with a hand dangling over the farther edge of it."You're an inconsistent being," David said."You buoy all the rest of
us up with your faith in the well-being of our child, and then you
pine yourself sick over her absence."We always had such a beautiful time on
Christmas.It isn't like
Christmas at all with her gone from us.""Do you remember how crazy she was over the ivory set?"David's eyes kindled at the
reminiscence.Margaret drew her feet up on the couch suddenly, and clasped her hands
about her knees."I haven't seen you do that for years," he said."I was just wondering--" but she stopped
herself suddenly.David was watching her narrowly, and perceiving it,
she flushed."This is not my idea of an interesting conversation," she said; "it's
getting too personal.""I can remember the time when you told me that you didn't find things
interesting unless they were personal.'I like things very personal,'
you said--in those words.""The chill wind of the world, I guess; the most personal part of me is
frozen stiff.""I never saw a warmer creature in my life," David protested."On that
same occasion you said that being a woman was about like being a field
of clover in an insectless world.You don't feel that way nowadays,
surely,--at the rate the insects have been buzzing around you this
winter.I've counted at least seven, three bees, one or two beetles, a
butterfly and a worm.""I didn't know you paid that much attention to my poor affairs."If you hadn't put your foot down firmly on the worm, I
had every intention of doing so.""On that occasion to which you refer I remember I also said that I had
a queer hunch about Eleanor.""Margaret, are you deliberately changing the subject?""Then I shall bring the butterfly up later.""I said," Margaret ignored his interruption, "that I had the feeling
that she was going to be a storm center and bring some kind of queer
trouble upon us.""I'm not so sure that's the way to put it," David said gravely."We
brought queer trouble on her.""She gave my vanity the worst blow it has ever had in its life," David
corrected her."Look here, Margaret, I want you to know the truth
about that.I--I stumbled into that, you know.She was so sweet, and
before I knew it I had--I found myself in the attitude of making love
to her.Well, there was nothing to do but go through with it.I felt like Pygmalion--but it was all potential,
unrealized--and ass that I was, I assumed that she would have no other
idea in the matter.I was going to marry her because I--I had started
things going, you know.I had no choice even if I had wanted one.It
never occurred to me that she might have a choice, and so I went on
trying to make things easy for her, and getting them more tangled at
every turn."With characteristic idiocy I was
keeping out of the picture until the time was ripe.She really ran
away to get away from the situation I created and she was quite right
too.If I weren't haunted by these continual pictures of our offspring
in the bread line, I should be rather glad than otherwise that she's
shaken us all till we get our breath back.Poor Peter is the one who
is smashed, though."You wouldn't smile if you were engaged to Beulah.""Beulah has her ring, but I notice she doesn't wear it often.""Jimmie and Gertrude seem happy.""That leaves only us two," David suggested."Margaret, dear, do you
think the time will ever come when I shall get you back again?"Margaret turned a little pale, but she met his look steadily."The answer to that is 'yes,' as you very well know.Time was when we
were very close--you and I, then somehow we lost the way to each
other.I'm beginning to realize that it hasn't been the same world
since and isn't likely to be unless you come back to me.""It was I; but it was you who put the bars up and have kept them
there.""Was I to let the bars down and wait at the gate?"It should be that way between us, Margaret, shouldn't
it?""I don't know," Margaret said, "I don't know."She flashed a sudden
odd look at him."If--when I put the bars down, I shall run for my
life."Warning is all I want," David said contentedly.He could barely reach
her hand across the intervening expanse of leather couch, but he
accomplished it,--he was too wise to move closer to her."You're a
lovely, lovely being," he said reverently."God grant I may reach you
and hold you.""To tell you the truth, she spoke of it the other day.I told her the
Eleanor story, and that rather brought her to her senses.She wouldn't
have liked that, you know; but now all the eligible buds are plucked,
and she wants me to settle down.""Does she think I'm a settling kind of person?""She wouldn't if she knew the way you go to my head," David murmured."Oh, she thinks that you'll do."Maybe I'd like them better considered as connections of yours,"
Margaret said abstractedly.David lifted the warm little finger to his lips and kissed it
swiftly.he asked, as she slipped away from him and
stood poised in the doorway."I'm going to put on something appropriate to the occasion," she
answered.When she came back to him she was wearing the most delicate and
cobwebby of muslins with a design of pale purple passion flowers
trellised all over it, and she gave him no chance for a moment alone
with her all the rest of the evening.Sometime later she showed him Eleanor's parting letter, and he was
profoundly touched by the pathetic little document.As the holidays approached Eleanor's absence became an almost
unendurable distress to them all.The annual Christmas dinner party, a
function that had never been omitted since the acquisition of David's
studio, was decided on conditionally, given up, and again decided on."We do want to see one another on Christmas day,--we've got presents
for one another, and Eleanor would hate it if she thought that her
going away had settled that big a cloud on us.She slipped out of our
lives in order to bring us closer together.We'll get closer together
for her sake," Margaret decided.But the ordeal of the dinner itself was almost more than they had
reckoned on.Every detail of traditional ceremony was observed even to
the mound of presents marked with each name piled on the same spot on
the couch, to be opened with the serving of the coffee."I got something for Eleanor," Jimmie remarked shamefacedly as he
added his contributions to the collection."Thought we could keep it
for her, or throw it into the waste-basket or something."I guess everybody else got her something, too," Margaret said."Of
course we will keep them for her.I got her a little French party
coat.It will be just as good next year as this.Anyhow as Jimmie
says, I had to get it.""I got her slipper buckles," Gertrude admitted."I got her the Temple _Shakespeare_," Beulah added."She was always
carrying around those big volumes.""You're looking better, Beulah," Margaret said."Jimmie says I'm looking more human.I guess perhaps that's it,--I'm
feeling more--human.I needed humanizing--even at the expense of
some--some heartbreak," she said bravely.Margaret crossed the room to take a seat on Beulah's chair-arm, and
slipped an arm around her."You're all right if you know that," she whispered softly."I thought I was going to bring you Eleanor herself," Peter said."I
got on the trail of a girl working in a candy shop out in Yonkers.My
faithful sleuth was sure it was Eleanor and I was ass enough to
believe he knew what he was talking about.When I got out there I
found a strawberry blonde with gold teeth.""Gosh, you don't think she's doing anything like that," Jimmie
exclaimed."I don't know," Peter said miserably.He was looking ill and unlike
himself.His deep set gray eyes were sunken far in his head, his brow
was too white, and the skin drawn too tightly over his jaws."As a
de-tec-i-tive, I'm afraid I'm a failure.""We're all failures for that matter," David said.Eleanor's empty place, set with the liqueur glass she always drank her
thimbleful of champagne in, and the throne chair from the drawing-room
in which she presided over the feasts given in her honor, was almost
too much for them.Peter shaded
his eyes with his hand, and Gertrude and Jimmie groped for each
other's hands under the shelter of the table-cloth."This--this won't do," David said.He turned to Beulah on his left,
sitting immovable, with her eyes staring unseeingly into the
centerpiece of holly and mistletoe arranged by Alphonse so lovingly."We must either turn this into a kind of a wake, and kneel as we
feast, or we must try to rise above it somehow.""I don't see why," Jimmie argued."I'm in favor of each man howling
informally as he listeth.""Let's drink her health anyhow," David insisted."I cut out the
Sauterne and the claret, so we could begin on the wine at once in this
contingency.Here's to our beloved and dear absent daughter.""Long may she wave," Jimmie cried, stumbling to his feet an instant
after the others.While they were still standing with their glasses uplifted, the bell
rang."Don't let anybody in, Alphonse," David admonished him.They all turned in the direction of the hall, but there was no sound
of parley at the front door.Eleanor had put a warning finger to her
lips, as Alphonse opened it to find her standing there.She stripped
off her hat and her coat as she passed through the drawing-room, and
stood in her little blue cloth traveling dress between the portieres
that separated it from the dining-room.The six stood transfixed at
the sight of her, not believing the vision of their eyes."You're drinking my health," she cried, as she stretched out her arms
to them.my dears, and my dearests, will you forgive me for
running away from you?"CHAPTER XXV

THE LOVER


They left her alone with Peter in the drawing room in the interval
before the coffee, seeing that he had barely spoken to her though his
eyes had not left her face since the moment of her spectacular
appearance between the portieres."I'm not going to marry you, Peter," Beulah whispered, as she slipped
by him to the door, "don't think of me.But Peter was almost past coherent thought or speech as they stood
facing each other on the hearth-rug,--Eleanor's little head up and her
breath coming lightly between her sweet, parted lips."How could you, dear--how could
you,--how could you?""I'm back all safe, now, Uncle Peter."I'm sorry I made you all that trouble," Eleanor said, "but I thought
it would be the best thing to do.""Tell me why," Peter said, "tell me why, I've suffered so
much--wondering--wondering.""I thought it was only I who did the
suffering."She moved a step nearer to him, and Peter gripped her hard by the
shoulders.Then his lips met hers dumbly,
beseechingly.*       *       *       *       *

"It was all a mistake,--my going away," she wrote some days after."I
ought to have stayed at the school, and graduated, and then come down
to New York, and faced things.I have my lesson now about facing
things.If any other crisis comes into my life, I hope I shall be as
strong as Dante was, when he'showed himself more furnished with
breath than he was,' and said, 'Go on, for I am strong and resolute.'I think we always have more strength than we understand ourselves to
have."I am so wonderfully happy about Uncle David and Aunt Margaret, and I
know Uncle Jimmie needs Aunt Gertrude and has always needed her.Did
my going away help those things to their fruition?"I can not bear to think of Aunt Beulah, but I know that I must bear
to think of her, and face the pain of having hurt her as I must face
every other thing that comes into my life from this hour.I would give
her back Peter, if I could,--but I can not.He is mine, and I am his,
and we have been that way from the beginning.I have thought of him
always as stronger and wiser than any one in the world, but I don't
think he is.He has suffered and stumbled along, trying blindly to do
right, hurting Aunt Beulah and mixing up his life like any man, just
the way Uncle Jimmie and Uncle David did."Don't men know who it is they love?They seem so often to be
struggling hungrily after the wrong thing, trying to get, or to make
themselves take, some woman that they do not really want.When women
love it is not like that with them.I think I have loved Peter from the first minute I
saw him, so beautiful and dear and sweet, with that _anxious_ look in
his eyes,--that look of consideration for the other person that is
always so much a part of him.He had it the first night I saw him,
when Uncle David brought me to show me to my foster parents for the
first time.It was the thing I grew up by, and measured men and their
attitude to women by--just that look in his eyes, that tender warm
look of consideration."It means a good many things, I think,--a gentle generous nature, and
a tender chivalrous heart.It means being a
good man, and one who _protects_ by sheer unselfish instinct.I don't
know how I shall ever heal him of the hurt he has done Aunt Beulah.Aunt Margaret tells me that Aunt Beulah's experience with him has been
the thing that has made her whole, that she needed to live through the
human cycle of emotion--of love and possession and renunciation before
she could be quite real and sound.This may be true, but it is not the
kind of reasoning for Peter and me to comfort ourselves with.If a
surgeon makes a mistake in cutting that afterwards does more good than
harm, he must not let that result absolve him from his mistake.Nothing can efface the mistake itself, and Peter and I must go on
feeling that way about it."I want to write something down about my love before I close this book
to-night.Something that I can turn to some day and read, or show to
my children when love comes to them.'This is the way I felt,' I want
to say to them, 'the first week of my love--this is what it meant to
me.'"It means being a greater, graver, and more beautiful person than you
ever thought you could be.It means knowing what you are, and what you
were meant to be all at once, and I think it means your chance to be
purified for the life you are to live, and the things you are to do in
it.Experience teaches, but I think love forecasts and points the way,
and shows you what you can be.Even if the light it sheds should grow
dim after a while, the path it has shown you should be clear to your
inner eye forever and ever.Having been in a great temple is a thing
to be better for all your life."It means that the soul and the things of the soul are
everlasting,--that they have got to be everlasting if love is like
this.Love between two people is more than the simple fact of their
being drawn together and standing hand in hand.It is the holy truth
about the universe.It is the rainbow of God's promise set over the
land.There comes with it the soul's certainty of living on and on
through time and space."Just my loving Peter and Peter's loving me isn't the important
thing,--the important thing is the way it has started the truth going;
my knowing and understanding mysterious laws that were sealed to me
before; Peter taking my life in his hands and making it consecrated
and true,--so true that I will not falter or suffer from any
misunderstandings or mistaken pain."It means warmth and light and tenderness, our love does, and all the
poetry in the world, and all the motherliness, (I feel so much like
his mother).When I say that he is not stronger or
wiser than any one in the world I mean--in living.I mean in the way
he behaves like a little bewildered boy sometimes.In loving he is
stronger and wiser than any living being.He takes my two hands in his
and gives me all the strength and all the wisdom and virtue there is
in the world."I haven't written down anything, after all, that any one could read.My children can't look over my shoulder on to this page, for they
would not understand it.It means nothing to any one in the world but
me.I shall have to translate for them or I shall have to say to them,
'Children, on looking into this book, I find I can't tell you what
love meant to me, because the words I have put down would mean nothing
to you.They were only meant to inform me, whenever I should turn back
to them, of the great glory and holiness that fell upon me like a
garment when love came.'"And if there should be any doubt in my heart as to the reality of the
feeling that has come to them in their turn, I should only have to
turn their faces up to the light, and look into their eyes and
_know_."I shall not die as my own mother did.I know that Peter
will be by my side until we both are old.These facts are established
in my consciousness I hardly know how, and I know that they are
there,--but if such a thing could be that I should die and leave my
little children, I would not be afraid to leave them alone in a world
that has been so good to me, under the protection of a Power that
provided me with the best and kindest guardians that a little orphan
ever had.God bless and keep them all, and make them happy."And even
had the fellow warned me--which is a lie, could I, a business man,
take the word of a drunkard who can no longer get a job because he
is unable to handle tools?I--I told you and him and her--that a floating

cause the absorbing liquid to pass into the burette, the water in the
graduated cylinder is made to flow by connecting the rubber tube, s, of
the bottle, S, with the point of the burette.The cock is opened, and
suction is effected with the mouth of the tube, r. When the water has
flowed out to nearly the last drop, _b_ is closed and the suction bottle
is removed.The absorbing liquid (caustic potassa or pyrogallate of
potassa) is poured into a porcelain capsule, P, and the point of the
burette is dipped into the liquid.If the cock, _b_, be opened, the
absorbing liquid will be sucked into the burette.In order to hasten
the absorption, the cock, _b_, is closed, and the burette is shaken
horizontally, the aperture of the funnel being closed by the hand during
the operation.If not enough absorbing liquid has entered, there may be sucked into the
burette, by the process described above, a new quantity of liquid.The
reaction finished, the graduated cylinder is put in communication with
the funnel by turning the cock, _a_.The water is allowed to run from
the funnel, and the latter is filled again with water up to the mark.The gas is then again under the same pressure as at the beginning.After the level has become constant, the quantity of gas remaining is
measured.The contraction that has taken place gives, in hundredths of
the total volume, the volume of the gas absorbed.When it is desired to make an analysis of smoke due to combustion,
caustic potassa is first sucked into the burette.After complete
absorption, and after putting the gas at the same pressure, the
diminution gives the volume of carbonic acid.To determine the oxygen in the remaining gas, a portion of the caustic
potash is allowed to flow out, and an aqueous solution of pyrogallic
acid and potash is allowed to enter.The presence of oxygen is revealed
by the color of the liquid, which becomes darker.The gas is then agitated with the absorbing liquid until, upon opening
the cock, _a_, the liquid remains in the capillary tube, that is to say,
until no more water runs from the funnel into the burette.To make a
quantitative analysis of the carbon contained in gas, the pyrogallate of
potash must be entirely removed from the burette.To do this, the liquid
is sucked out by means of the flask, S, until there remain only a few
drops; then the cock, _a_, is opened and water is allowed to flow from
the funnel along the sides of the burette.Then _a_ is closed, and
the washing water is sucked in the same manner.By repeating this
manipulation several times, the absorbing liquid is completely removed.The acid solution of chloride of copper is then allowed to enter.As the absorbing liquids adhere to the glass, it is better, before
noting the level, to replace these liquids by water.The cocks, _a_ and
_b_, are opened, and water is allowed to enter from the funnel, the
absorbing liquid being made to flow at the same time through the cock,
_b_.When an acid solution of chloride of copper is employed, dilute
hydrochloric acid is used instead of water.2 shows the arrangement of the apparatus for the quantitative
analysis of oxide of carbon and hydrogen by combustion.The gas in the
burette is first mixed with atmospheric air, by allowing the liquid to
flow through _b_, and causing air to enter through the axial aperture of
the three way cock, _a_, after cutting off communication at v. Then, as
shown in the figure, the burette is connected with the tube, B, which is
filled with water up to the narrow curved part, and the interior of the
burette is made to communicate with the combustion tube, v, by turning
the cock, a. The combustion tube is heated by means of a Bunsen burner
or alcohol lamp, L. It is necessary to proceed, so that all the water
shall be driven from the cock and the capillary tube, and that it shall
be sent into the burette.The combustion is effected by causing the
mixture of gas to pass from the burette into the tube, B, through the
tube, v, heated to redness, into which there passes a palladium wire.Water is allowed to flow through the point of the tube, B, while from
the flask, F, it enters through the bottom into the burette, so as to
drive out the gas.The water is allowed to rise into the burette as far
as the cock, and the cocks, _b_ and _b1_, are afterward closed.BUeNTE'S GAS BURETTE]

By a contrary operation, the gas is made to pass from B into the
burette.It is then allowed to cool, and, after the pressure has been
established again, the contraction is measured.If the gas burned is
hydrogen, the contraction multiplied by two-thirds gives the original
volume of the hydrogen gas burned.If the gas burned is oxide of carbon,
there forms an equal volume of carbonic acid, and the contraction is the
half of CO.Thus, to analyze CO, a portion of the liquid is removed from
the burette, then caustic potash is allowed to enter, and the process
goes on as explained above.The total contraction resulting from combustion and absorption,
multiplied by two-thirds, gives the volume of the oxide of carbon.The hydrogen and oxide carbon may thus be quantitatively analyzed
together or separately.--_Revue Industrielle_.*       *       *       *       *




THE "UNIVERSAL" GAS ENGINE.The accompanying engravings illustrate a new and very simple form of gas
engine, the invention of J. A. Ewins and H. Newman, and made by Mr.T.
B. Barker, of Scholefield-street, Bloomsbury, Birmingham.It is known as
the "Universal" engine, and is at present constructed in sizes varying
from one-eighth horse-power--one man power--to one horse-power, though
larger sizes are being made.The essentially new feature of the engine
is, says the _Engineer_, the simple rotary ignition valve consisting of
a ratchet plate or flat disk with a number of small radial slots which
successively pass a small slot in the end of the cylinder, and through
which the flame is drawn to ignite the charge.4
is a sectional view of the chamber in which the gas and air are mixed,
with the valves appertaining thereto; Fig.5 is a detail view of the
ratchet plate, with pawl and levers and valve gear shaft; Fig.6 is
a sectional view of a pump employed in some cases to circulate water
through the jacket; Fig.7 is a sectional view of arrangement for
lighting, and ratchet plate, j, with central spindle and igniting
apertures, and the spiral spring, k, and fly nut, showing the attachment
to the end of the working cylinder, f1; b5, b5, bevel wheels driving
the valve gear shaft; e, the valve gear driving shaft; e2, eccentric to
drive pump; e cubed, eccentric or cam to drive exhaust valve; e4, crank to
drive ratchet plate; e5, connecting rod to ratchet pawl; f, cylinder
jacket; f1, internal or working cylinder; f2, back cylinder cover; g,
igniting chamber; h, mixing chamber; h1, flap valve; h2, gas inlet
valve, the motion of which is regulated by a governor; h3, gas inlet
valve seat; h4, cover, also forming stop for gas inlet valve; h5, gas
inlet pipe; h6, an inlet valve; h8, cover, also forming stop for air
inlet valve; h9, inlet pipe for air with grating; i, exhaust chamber;
i2, exhaust valve spindle; i7, exhaust pipe; j6, lighting aperture
through cylinder end; l, igniting gas jet; m, regulating and stop valve
for gas.[Illustration: IMPROVED GAS ENGINE]

The engine, it will be seen, is single-acting, and no compression of the
explosive charge is employed.An explosive mixture of combustible gas
and air is drawn through the valves, h2 and h6, and exploded behind
the piston once in a revolution; but by a duplication of the valve and
igniting apparatus, placed also at the front end of the cylinder, the
engine may be constructed double-acting.At the proper time, when the
piston has proceeded far enough to draw in through the mixing chamber,
h, into the igniting chamber, g, the requisite amount of gas and air,
the ratchet plate, j, is pushed into such a position by the pawl, j3,
that the flame from the igniting jet, l, passes through one of the slots
or holes, j1, and explodes the charge when opposite j6, which is the
only aperture in the end of the working cylinder (see Fig.2), thus driving the piston on to the end of its forward stroke.9, though not exactly of the form shown, is kept
open during the whole of this return stroke by means of the eccentric,
e3, on the shaft working the ratchet, and thus allowing the products of
combustion to escape through the exhaust pipe, i7, in the direction of
the arrow.Between the ratchet disk and the igniting flame a small plate
not shown is affixed to the pipe, its edge being just above the burner
top.The flame is thus not blown out by the inrushing air when the slots
in ratchet plate and valve face are opposite.This ratchet plate or
ignition valve, the most important in any engine, has so very small a
range of motion per revolution of the engine that it cannot get out of
order, and it appears to require no lubrication or attention whatever.The engines are working very successfully, and their simplicity enables
them to be made at low cost.They cost for gas from 1/2d.*       *       *       *       *




GAS FURNACE FOR BAKING REFRACTORY PRODUCTS.In order that small establishments may put to profit the advantages
derived from the use of annular furnaces heated with gas, smaller
dimensions have been given the baking chambers of such furnaces.The
accompanying figure gives a section of a furnace of this kind, set into
the ground, and the height of whose baking chamber is only one and a
half meters.The chamber is not vaulted, but is covered by slabs of
refractory clay, D, that may be displaced by the aid of a small car
running on a movable track.This car is drawn over the compartment that
is to be emptied, and the slab or cover, D, is taken off and carried
over the newly filled compartment and deposited thereon.The gas passes from the channel through the pipe, a, into the vertical
conduits, b, and is afterward disengaged through the tuyeres into the
chamber.In order that the gas may be equally applied for preliminary
heating or smoking, a small smoking furnace, S, has been added to
the apparatus.The upper part of this consists of a wide cylinder
of refractory clay, in the center of whose cover there is placed an
internal tube of refractory clay, which communicates with the channel,
G, through a pipe, d. This latter leads the gas into the tube, t, of the
smoking furnace, which is perforated with a large number of small holes.The air requisite for combustion enters through the apertures, o, in the
cover of the furnace, and brings about in the latter a high temperature.The very hot gases descend into the lower iron portion of this small
furnace and pass through a tube, e, into the smoking chamber by the aid
of vertical conduits, b', which serve at the same time as gas tuyeres
for the extremity of the furnace that is exposed to the fire.[Illustration: GAS FURNACE FOR BAKING REFRACTORY PRODUCTS.]In the lower part of the smoking furnace, which is made of boiler plate
and can be put in communication with the tube, e, there are large
apertures that may be wholly or partially closed by means of registers
so as to carry to the hot gas derived from combustion any quantity
whatever of cold and dry air, and thus cause a variation at will of the
temperature of the gases which are disengaged from the tube, e.

The use of these smoking apparatus heated by gas does away also with the
inconveniences of the ordinary system, in which the products are soiled
by cinders or dust, and which render the gradual heating of objects to
be baked difficult.At the beginning, there is allowed to enter the
lower part of the small furnace, S, through the apertures, a very
considerable quantity of cold air, so as to lower the temperature of the
smoke gas that escapes from the tube, e, to 30 or 50 degrees.Afterward,
these secondary air entrances are gradually closed so as to increase the
temperature of the gases at will.*       *       *       *       *




THE EFFICIENCY OF FANS.Air, like every other gas or combination of gases, possesses weight;
some persons who have been taught that the air exerts a pressure of 14.7
lb.per square inch, cannot, however, be got to realize the fact that a
cubit foot of air at the same pressure and at a temperature of 62 deg.weighs the thirteenth part of a pound, or over one ounce; 13.141 cubic
feet of air weigh one pound.In round numbers 30,000 cubic feet of air
weigh one ton; this is a useful figure to remember, and it is easily
carried in the mind.A hall 61 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 17 feet high
will contain one ton of air.1]

The work to be done by a fan consists in putting a weight--that of the
air--in motion.The resistances incurred are due to the inertia of the
air and various frictional influences; the nature and amount of these
last vary with the construction of the fan.As the air enters at the
center of the fan and escapes at the circumference, it will be seen that
its motion is changed while in the fan through a right angle.It may
also be taken for granted that within certain limits the air has no
motion in a radial direction when it first comes in contact with a fan
blade.It is well understood that, unless power is to be wasted, motion
should be gradually imparted to any body to be moved.Consequently, the
shape of the blades ought to be such as will impart motion at first
slowly and afterward in a rapidly increasing ratio to the air.It is
also clear that the change of motion should be effected as gradually as
possible.1 shows how a fan should not be constructed; Fig.2 will
serve to give an idea of how it should be made.1 it will be seen that the air, as indicated by the bent arrows,
is violently deflected on entering the fan.2 it will be seen
that it follows gentle curves, and so is put gradually in motion.The
curved form of the blades shown in Fig.2 does not appear to add much to
the efficiency of a fan; but it adds something and keeps down noise.The
idea is that the fan blades when of this form push the air radially from
the center to the circumference.The fact is, however, that the air
flies outward under the influence of centrifugal force, and always tends
to move at a tangent to the fan blades, as in Fig.3, where the circle
is the path of the tips of the fan blades, and the arrow is a tangent to
that path; and to impart this notion a radial blade, as at C, is perhaps
as good as any other, as far as efficiency is concerned.Concerning the
shape to be imparted to the blades, looked at back or front, opinions
widely differ; but it is certain that if a fan is to be silent the
blades must be narrower at the tips than at the center.Various forms
are adopted by different makers, the straight side and the curved sides,
as shown in Fig.The proportions as regards
length to breadth are also varied continually.In fact, no two makers of
fans use the same shapes.3]

As the work done by a fan consists in imparting motion at a stated
velocity to a given weight of air, it is very easy to calculate the
power which must be expended to do a certain amount of work.The
velocity at which the air leaves the fan cannot be greater than that of
the fan tips.In a good fan it may be about two-thirds of that speed.The resistance to be overcome will be found by multiplying the area of
the fan blades by the pressure of the air and by the velocity of the
center of effort, which must be determined for every fan according to
the shape of its blades.The velocity imparted to the air by the fan
will be just the same as though the air fell in a mass from a given
height.This height can be found by the formula h = v squared / 64; that is to
say, if the velocity be multiplied by itself and divided by 64 we have
the height.Thus, let the velocity be 88 per second, then 88 x 88 =
7,744, and 7,744 / 64 = 121.A stone or other body falling from a height
of 121 feet would have a velocity of 88 per second at the earth.The
pressure against the fan blades will be equal to that of a column of air
of the height due to the velocity, or, in this case, 121 feet.We
have seen that in round numbers 13 cubic feet of air weigh one pound,
consequently a column of air one square foot in section and 121 feet
high, will weigh as many pounds as 13 will go times into 121.Now, 121
/ 13 = 9.3, and this will be the resistance in pounds per _square foot_
overcome by the fan.Let the aggregate area of all the blades be 2
square feet, and the velocity of the center of effort 90 feet per
second, then the power expended will bve (90 x 60 x 2 x 9.3) / 33,000
= 3.04 horse power.The quantity of air delivered ought to be equal in
volume to that of a column with a sectional area equal that of one fan
blade moving at 88 feet per second, or a mile a minute.The blade having
an area of 1 square foot, the delivery ought to be 5,280 feet per
minute, weighing 5,280 / 13 = 406.1 lb.In practice we need hardly say
that such an efficiency is never attained.4]

The number of recorded experiments with fans is very small, and a great
deal of ignorance exists as to their true efficiency.Buckle is one
of the very few authorities on the subject.He gives the accompanying
table of proportions as the best for pressures of from 3 to 6 ounces per
square inch:

--------------------------------------------------------------
                  |         Vanes.| Diameter of inlet
Diameter of fans.|
--------------------------------------------------------------
     ft.3  0        |   0   9    |  0   9    |        1   6
      3  6        |   0  101/2   |  0  101/2   |        1   9
      4  0        |   1   0    |  1   0    |        2   0
      4  6        |   1   11/2   |  1   11/2   |        2   3
      5  0        |   1   3    |  1   3    |        2   6
      6  0        |   1   6    |  1   6    |        3   0
                  |            |           |
--------------------------------------------------------------

For higher pressures the blades should be longer and narrower, and
the inlet openings smaller.The case is to be made in the form of an
arithmetical spiral widening, the space between the case and the blades
radially from the origin to the opening for discharge, and the upper
edge of the opening should be level with the lower side of the sweep of
the fan blade, somewhat as shown in Fig.5]

A considerable number of patents has been taken out for improvements
in the construction of fans, but they all, or nearly all, relate to
modifications in the form of the case and of the blades.So far,
however, as is known, it appears that, while these things do exert a
marked influence on the noise made by a fan, and modify in some degree
the efficiency of the machine, that this last depends very much more on
the proportions adopted than on the shapes--so long as easy curves
are used and sharp angles avoided.In the case of fans running at low
speeds, it matters very little whether the curves are present or not;
but at high speeds the case is different.--_The Engineer_.*       *       *       *       *




MACHINE FOR COMPRESSING COAL REFUSE INTO FUEL.The problem as to how the refuse of coal shall be utilized has been
solved in the manufacture from it of an agglomerated artificial
fuel, which is coming more and more into general use on railways and
steamboats, in the industries, and even in domestic heating.The qualities that a good agglomerating machine should present are as
follows:

1.Very great simplicity, inasmuch as it is called upon to operate in
an atmosphere charged with coal dust, pitch, and steam; and, under such
conditions, it is important that it may be easily got at for cleaning,
and that the changing of its parts (which wear rapidly) may be effected
without, so to speak, interrupting its running.The compression must be powerful, and, that the product may be
homogeneous, must operate progressively and not by shocks.It must
especially act as much as possible upon the entire surface of the
conglomerate, and this is something that most machines fail to do.The removal from the mould must be effected easily, and not depend
upon a play of pistons or springs, which soon become foul, and the
operation of which is very irregular.The operations embraced in the manufacture of this kind of fuel are as
follows:

The refuse is sifted in order to separate the dust from the grains of
coal.The grains are classed
into two sizes, after removing the nut size, which is sold separately.The washed grains are
either drained or dried by a hydro-extractor in order to free them from
the greater part of the water, the presence of this being an obstacle to
their perfect agglomeration.The water, however, should not be entirely
extracted because the combustibles being poor conductors of heat, a
certain amount of dampness must be preserved to obtain an equal division
of heat in the paste when the mixture is warmed.After being dried the grains are mixed with the coal dust, and broken
coal pitch is added in the proportion of eight to ten per cent.The mixture is then thrown into a crushing machine, where it is
reduced to powder and intimately mixed.It then passes into a pug-mill
into which superheated steam is admitted, and by this means is converted
into a plastic paste.This paste is then led into an agitator for the
double purpose of freeing it from the steam that it contains, and of
distributing it in the moulds of the compressing machine.[Illustration: IMPROVED MACHINE FOR COMPRESSING REFUSE COAL INTO FUEL.]Bilan's machine, shown in the accompanying cut, is designed for
manufacturing spherical conglomerates for domestic purposes.It consists
of a cast iron frame supporting four vertical moulding wheels placed at
right angles to each other and tangent to the line of the centers.These
wheels carry on their periphery cavities that have the form of a quarter
of a sphere.They thus form at the point of contact a complete sphere
in which the material is inclosed.The paste is thrown by shovel, or
emptied by buckets and chain, into the hopper fixed at the upper part
of the frame.From here it is taken up by two helices, mounted on a
vertical shaft traversing the hopper, and forced toward the point where
the four moulding wheels meet.The driving pulley of the machine is
keyed upon a horizontal shaft which is provided with two endless screws
that actuate two gear-wheels, and these latter set in motion the four
moulding wheels by means of beveled pinions.The four moulding wheels
being accurately adjusted so that their cavities meet each other at
every revolution, carry along the paste furnished them by the hopper,
compress it powerfully on the four quarters, and, separating by a
further revolution, allow the finished ball to drop out.The external crown of the wheels carrying the moulds consists of four
segments, which may be taken apart at will to be replaced by others when
worn.This machine produces about 40 tons per day of this globular artificial
fuel.--_Annales Industrielles_.*       *       *       *       *




HANK SIZING AND WRINGING MACHINE.We give a view of a hank sizing machine by Messrs.Heywood & Spencer,
of Radcliffe, near Manchester.The machine is also suitable for fancy
dyeing.It is well known, says the _Textile Manufacturer_, that when
hanks are wrung by hand, not only is the labor very severe, but in
dyeing it is scarcely possible to obtain even colors, and, furthermore,
the production is limited by the capabilities of the man.The machine
we illustrate is intended to perform the heavy part of the work with
greater expedition and with more certainty than could be relied upon
with hand labor.The illustration represents the machine that we
inspected.It consists
of two vats, between which is placed the gearing for driving the hooks.The large wheel in this gear, although it always runs in one direction,
contains internal segments, which fall into gear alternately with
pinions on the shanks of the hooks.The motion is a simple one, and it
appeared to us to be perfectly reliable, and not liable to get out of
order.The action is as follows: The attendant lifts the hank out of the
vat and places it on the hooks.The hook connected to the gearing then
commences to turn; it puts in two, two and a half, three, or more twists
into the hank and remains stationary for a few seconds to allow an
interval for the sizer to "wipe off" the excess of size, that is, to
run his hand along the twisted hank.This done, the hook commences to
revolve the reverse way, until the twists are taken out of the hank.It is then removed, either by lifting off by hand or by the apparatus
shown, attached to the right hand side.This arrangement consists of a
lattice, carrying two arms that, at the proper moment, lift the hank off
the hooks on to the lattice proper, by which it is carried away, and
dropped upon a barrow to be taken to the drying stove.In sizing, a
double operation is customary; the first is called running, and the
second, finishing.In the machine shown, running is carried on one side
simultaneously with finishing in the other, or, if required, running
may be carried on on both sides.If desired, the lifting off motion is
attached to both running and finishing sides, and also the roller partly
seen on the left hand for running the hanks through the size.The
machine we saw was doing about 600 bundles per day at running and at
finishing, but the makers claim the production with a double machine to
be at the rate of about 36 10 lb.bundles per hour (at finishing), wrung
in 11/2 lb.wringers (or I1/2 lb.of yarn at a time), or at running at the
rate of 45 bundles in 2 lb.The distance between the hooks
is easily adjusted to the length or size of hanks, and altogether the
machine seems one that is worth the attention of the trade.[Illustration: IMPROVED HANK SIZING MACHINE.]*       *       *       *       *




IMPROVED COKE BREAKER.The working parts of the breaker now in use by the South Metropolitan
Gas Company consist essentially of a drum provided with cutting edges
projecting from it, which break up the coke against a fixed grid.The
drum is cast in rings, to facilitate repairs when necessary, and the
capacity of the machine can therefore be increased or diminished by
varying the number of these rings.The degree of fineness of the coke
when broken is determined by the regulated distance of the grid from the
drum.Thus there is only one revolving member, no toothed gearing being
required.Consequently the machine works with little power; the one at
the Old Kent Road, which is of the full size for large works, being
actually driven by a one horse power "Otto" gas-engine.Under these
conditions, at a recent trial, two tons of coke were broken in half an
hour, and the material delivered screened into the three classes of
coke, clean breeze (worth as much as the larger coke), and dust, which
at these works is used to mix with lime in the purifiers.The special
advantage of the machine, besides the low power required to drive it and
its simple action, lies in the small quantity of waste.On the occasion
of the trial in question, the dust obtained from two tons of coke
measured only 31/2 bushels, or just over a half hundredweight per ton.The following statement, prepared from the actual working of the first
machine constructed, shows the practical results of its use.It should
be premised that the machine is assumed to be regularly employed and
driven by the full power for which it is designed, when it will easily
break 8 tons of coke per hour, or 80 tons per working day:

        Cost of breaking, per ton.0  91/2

As coke, when broken, will usually fetch from 2s.per ton
more than large, the result of using these machines is a net gain of
from 1s.It is not so much the actual
gain, however, that operates in favor of providing a supply of broken
coke, as the certainty that by so doing a market is obtained that would
not otherwise be available.[Illustration: IMPROVED COKE BREAKER.]It will not be overstating the case to say that this coke breaker is by
far the simplest, strongest, and most economical appliance of its kind
now manufactured.That it does its work well is proved by experience;
and the advantages of its construction are immediately apparent upon
comparison of its simple drum and single spindle with the flying hammers
or rocking jaws, or double drums with toothed gearing which characterize
some other patterns of the same class of plant.It should be remarked,
as already indicated, lest exception should be taken to the size of the
machine chosen here for illustration, that it can be made of any size
down to hand power.On the whole, however, as a few tons of broken coke
might be required at short notice even in a moderate sized works, it
would scarcely be advisable to depend upon too small a machine; since
the regular supply of the fuel thus improved may be trusted in a short
time to increase the demand.[Illustration: IMPROVED COKE BREAKER.]*       *       *       *       *




IMPROVEMENT IN PRINTING MACHINERY.This is the design of Alfred Godfrey, of Clapton.According to this
improvement, as represented at Figs.1 and 2, a rack, A, is employed
vibrating on the pivot a, and a pinion, a1, so arranged that instead of
the pinion moving on a universal joint, or the rack moving in a parallel
line from side to side of the pinion at the time the motion of the table
is reversed, there is employed, for example, the radial arm, a2, mounted
on the shaft, a3, supporting the driving wheel, a4.The opposite or
vibrating end of the radial arm, a2, supports in suitable bearings the
pinion, a1, and wheel, a5, driving the rack through the medium of the
driving wheel, a4, the effect of which is that through the mechanical
action of the vibrating arm, a2, and pinion, a1 in conjunction with the
vibrating movement of the rack, A, an easy, uniform, and silent motion
is transmitted to the rack and table.[Illustration: IMPROVEMENTS IN PRINTING MACHINERY.1]

A CHARACTERISTIC MINING "RUSH."--THE PROSPECTIVE MINING CENTER OF
SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO.A correspondent of the _Tribune_ describes at length the mining camps
about Lake Valley, New Mexico, hitherto thought likely to be the central
camp of that region, and then graphically tells the story of the recent
"rush" to the Perche district.Within a month of the first strike of
silver ore the country was swarming with prospectors, and a thousand or
more prospects had been located.The Perche district is on the eastern flanks of the Mimbres Mountains,
a range which is a part of the Rocky Mountain range, and runs north and
south generally parallel with the Rio Grande, from which it lies about
forty miles to the westward.The northern half of these mountains is
known as the Black Range, and was the center of considerable mining
excitement a year and a half ago.It is there that the Ivanhoe is
located, of which Colonel Gillette was manager, and in which Robert
Ingersoll and Senator Plumb, of Kansas, were interested, much to the
disadvantage of the former.A new company has been organized, however,
with Colonel Ingersoll as president, and the reopening of work on the
Ivanhoe will probably prove a stimulus to the whole Black Range.From
this region the Perche district is from forty to sixty miles south.It
is about twenty-five miles northwest of Lake Valley, and ten miles west
of Hillsboro, a promising little mining town, with some mills and about
300 people.The Perche River has three forks coming down from the
mountains and uniting at Hillsboro, and it is in the region between
these forks that the recent strikes have been made.On August 15 "Jack" Shedd, the original discoverer of the Robinson mine
in Colorado, was prospecting on the south branch of the north fork of
the Perche River, when he made the first great strike in the district.On the summit of a heavily timbered ridge he found some small pieces of
native silver, and then a lump of ore containing very pure silver in the
form of sulphides, weighing 150 pounds, and afterward proved to be worth
on the average $11 a pound.All this was mere float, simply lying on the
surface of the ground.Afterward another block was found, weighing 87
pounds, of horn silver, with specimens nearly 75 per cent.The
strike was kept a secret for a few days.Said a mining man: "I went up
to help bring the big lump down.We took it by a camp of prospectors who
were lying about entirely ignorant of any find.When they saw it they
instantly saddled their horses, galloped off, and I believe they
prospected all night."A like excitement was created when the news of
this and one or two similar finds reached Lake Valley.Next morning
every waiter was gone from the little hotel, and a dozen men had left
the Sierra mines, to try their fortunes at prospecting.As the news spread men poured into the Perche district from no one knows
where, some armed with only a piece of salt pork, a little meal, and a
prospecting pick; some mounted on mules, others on foot; old men and men
half-crippled were among the number, but all bitten by the monomania
which possesses every prospector.Now there are probably 2,000 men in
the Perche district, and the number of prospects located must far exceed
1,000.Three miners from there with whom I was talking recently owned
forty-seven mines among them, and while one acknowledged that hardly one
prospect in a hundred turns out a prize, the other millionaire in embryo
remarked that he wouldn't take $50,000 for one of his mines.So it goes,
and the victims of the mining fever here seem as deaf to reason as the
buyers of mining stock in New York.Fuel was added to the flame by
the report that Shedd had sold his location, named the Solitaire, to
ex-Governor Tabor and Mr.Wurtzbach on August 25 for $100,000.I met Governor Tabor's representative, who came down recently
to examine the properties, and learned that the Governor had not up to
that date bought the mine.He undoubtedly bonded it, however, and his
representative's opinion of the properties seemed highly favorable.The Solitaire showed what appeared to be a contact vein, with walls of
porphyry and limestone in a ledge thirty feet wide in places, containing
a high assay of horned silver.The vein was composed of quartz, bearing
sulphides, with horn silver plainly visible, giving an average assay of
from $350 to $500.These were the results shown
simply by surface explorations, which were certainly exceedingly
promising.Recently it has been stated that a little development shows
the vein to be only a blind lead, but the statement lacks confirmation.In any case the effect of so sensational a discovery is the same in
creating an intense excitement and attracting swarms of prospectors.But the Perche district does not rest on the Solitaire, for there has
been abundance of mineral wealth discovered throughout its extent.Four
miles south of this prospect, on the middle fork of the Perche, is an
actual mine--the Bullion--which was purchased by four or five Western
mining men for $10,000, and yielded $11,000 in twenty days.The ore
contains horn and native silver.On the same fork are the Iron King and
Andy Johnson, both recently discovered and promising properties, and
there is a valuable mine now in litigation on the south fork of the
Perche, with scores of prospects over the entire district.Now that one
or two sensational strikes have attracted attention, and capital is
developing paying mines, the future of the Perche District seems
assured.*       *       *       *       *




THE SOY BEAN.The _British Medical Journal_ says that Prof.E. Kinch, writing in the
_Agricultural Students' Gazette_, says that the Soy bean approaches more
nearly to animal food than any other known vegetable production, being
singularly rich in fat and in albuminoids.It is largely used as
an article of food in China and Japan.Efforts have been made to
acclimatize it in various parts of the continent of Europe, and fair
success has been achieved in Italy and France; many foods are made from
it and its straw is a useful fodder.*       *       *       *       *




ON A NEW ARC ELECTRIC LAMP.[Footnote: Paper read at the British Association, Southampton.Revised
by the Author.--_Nature_.]Electric lamps on the arc principle are almost as numerous as the trees
in the forest, and it is somewhat fresh to come upon something that is
novel.In these lamps the carbons are consumed as the current flows, and
it is the variation in their consumption which occasions the flickering
and irregularity of the light that is so irritating to the eyes.Special
mechanical contrivances or regulators have to be used to compensate for
this destruction of the carbons, as in the Siemens and Brush type, or
else refractory materials have to be combined with the carbons, as in
the Jablochkoff candle and in the lamp Soleil.The steadiness of the
light depends upon the regularity with which the carbons are moved
toward each other as they are consumed, so as to maintain the electric
resistance between them a constant quantity.Each lamp must have a
certain elasticity of regulation of its own, to prevent irregularities
from the variable material of carbon used, and from variations in the
current itself and in the machinery.In all electric lamps, except the Brockie, the regulator is in the lamp
itself.In the Brockie system the regulation is automatic, and is made
at certain rapid intervals by the motor engine.This causes a periodic
blinking that is detrimental to this lamp for internal illumination.M. Abdank, the inventor of the system which I have the pleasure of
bringing before the Section, separates his regulator from his lamp.The regulator may be fixed anywhere, within easy inspection and
manipulation, and away from any disturbing influence in the lamp.The
lamp can be fixed in any inaccessible place.--The bottom or negative carbon is fixed,
but the top or positive carbon is movable, in a vertical line.It is
screwed at the point, C, to a brass rod, T (Fig.2), which moves freely
inside the tubular iron core of an electromagnet, K. This rod is
clutched and lifted by the soft iron armature, A B, when a current
passes through the coil, M M. The mass of the iron in the armature is
distributed so that the greater portion is at one end, B, much nearer
the pole than the other end.Hence this portion is attracted first, the
armature assumes an inclined position, maintained by a brass button, t,
which prevents any adhesion between the armature and the core of the
electromagnet.The electric connection between the carbon and the coil
of the electromagnet is maintained by the flexible wire, S.1), is fixed to a long and heavy rack, C,
which falls by its own weight and by the weight of the electromagnet and
the carbon fixed to it.The length of the rack is equal to the length of
the two carbons.The fall of the rack is controlled by a friction break,
B (Fig.3), which acts upon the last of a train of three wheels put
in motion by the above weight.The break, B, is fixed at one end of
a lever, B A, the other end carrying a soft iron armature, F,
easily adjusted by three screws.This armature is attracted by the
electromagnet, E E (whose resistance is 1,200 ohms), whenever a current
circulates through it.The length of the play is regulated by the screw,
V. The spring, L, applies tension to the break._The Regulator_.--This consists of a balance and a cut-off.4 and 5) is made with two solenoids.S and S',
whose relative resistances is adjustable.S conveys the main current,
and is wound with thick wire having practically no resistance, and S'
is traversed by a shunt current, and is wound with fine wire having a
resistance of 600 ohms.In the axes of these two coils a small and light
iron tube (2 mm.length) freely moves in a vertical
line between two guides.When magnetized it has one pole in the middle
and the other at each end.The upward motion is controlled by the
spring, N T. The spring rests upon the screw, H, with which it makes
contact by platinum electrodes.This contact is broken whenever the
little iron rod strikes the spring, N T.

The positive lead from the dynamo is attached to the terminal, B, then
passes through the coil, S, to the terminal, B', whence it proceeds to
the lamp.The negative lead is attached to terminal, A, passing directly
to the other terminal, A', and thence to the lamp.4]

The shunt which passes through the fine coil, S', commences at the
point, P. The other end is fixed to the screw, H, whence it has two
paths, the one offering no resistance through the spring, T N, to the
upper negative terminal, A'; the other through the terminal, J, to the
electromagnet of the break, M, and thence to the negative terminal of
the lamp, L'._The Cut-off_.--The last part of the apparatus (Fig.4) to be described
is the cut-off, which is used when there are several lamps in series.It
is brought into play by the switch, C D, which can be placed at E or D.
When it is at E, the negative terminal, A, is in communication with
the positive terminal, B, through the resistance, R, which equals the
resistance of the lamp, which is, therefore, out of circuit.When it is
at D the cut-off acts automatically to do the same thing when required.This is done by a solenoid, V, which has two coils, the one of thick
wire offering no resistance, and the other of 2,000 ohms resistance.The
fine wire connects the terminals, A' and B. The solenoid has a movable
soft iron core suspended by the spring, U. It has a cross-piece of iron
which can dip into two mercury cups, G and K, when the core is sucked
into the solenoid.When this is the case, which happens when any
accident occurs to the lamp, the terminal, A, is placed in connection
with the terminal, B, through the thick wire of V and the resistance, R,
in the same way as it was done by the switch, C D._Electrical Arrangement_.--The mode in which several lamps are connected
up in series is shown by Fig.The + lead is
connected to B1 of the balance it then passes to the lamp, L, returning
to the balance, and then proceeds to each other lamp, returning finally
to the negative pole of the machine.When the current enters the balance
it passes through the coil, S, magnetizing the iron core and drawing
it downward (Fig.It then passes to the lamp, L L', through the
carbons, then returns to the balance, and proceeds back to the negative
terminal of the machine.A small portion of the current is shunted off
at the point, P, passing through the coil, S', through the contact
spring, T N, to the terminal, A', and drawing the iron core in
opposition to S. The carbons are in contact, but in passing through
the lamp the current magnetizes the electromagnet, M (Fig.2), which
attracts the armature, A B, that bites and lifts up the rod, T, with the
upper carbon, a definite and fixed distance that is easily regulated
by the screws, Y Y. The arc then is formed, and will continue to burn
steadily as long as the current remains constant.But the moment the
current falls, due to the increased resistance of the arc, a greater
proportion passes through the shunt, S' (Fig.4), increasing its
magnetic moment on the iron core, while that of S is diminishing.The
result is that a moment arrives when equilibrium is destroyed, the iron
rod strikes smartly and sharply upon the spring, N T. Contact between T
and H is broken, and the current passes through the electromagnet of the
break in the lamp.The break is released for an instant, the carbons
approach each other.But the same rupture of contact introduces in the
shunt a new resistance of considerable magnitude (viz., 1,200 ohms),
that of the electromagnets of the break.Then the strength of the shunt
current diminishes considerably, and the solenoid, S, recovers briskly
its drawing power upon the rod, and contact is restored.The carbons
approach during these periods only about 0.01 to 0.02 millimeter.If this is not sufficient to restore equilibrium it is repeated
continually, until equilibrium is obtained.The result is that the
carbon is continually falling by a motion invisible to the eye, but
sufficient to provide for the consumption of the carbons.6]

The contact between N T and H is never completely broken, the sparks are
very feeble, and the contacts do not oxidize.The resistances inserted
are so considerable that heating cannot occur, while the portion of the
current abstracted for the control is so small that it may be neglected.The balance acts precisely like the key of a Morse machine, and the
break precisely like the sounder-receiver so well known in telegraphy.It emits the same kind of sounds, and acts automatically like a skilled
and faithful telegraphist.This regulation, by very small and short successive steps, offers
several advantages: (1) it is imperceptible to the eye; (2) it does not
affect the main current; (3) any sudden instantaneous variation of the
main current does not allow a too near approach of the carbon points.Let, now, an accident occur; for instance, a carbon is broken.At once
the automatic cut-off acts, the current passes through the resistance,
R, instead of passing through the lamp.The current through the fine
coil is suddenly increased, the rod is drawn in, contact is made at G
and K, and the current is sent through the coil, R. As soon as contact
is again made by the carbons, the current in the coil, S, is increased,
that of the thick wire in V diminished, and the antagonistic spring,
U, breaks the contact at G and K. The rupture of the light is almost
invisible, because the relighting is so brisk and sharp.I have seen this lamp in action, and its constant steadiness leaves
nothing to be desired.*       *       *       *       *




APPARATUS FOR OBTAINING PURE WATER FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC USE.Our readers are well aware that water as found naturally is never
absolutely free from dissolved impurities; and in ordinary cases it
contains solid impurities derived both from the inorganic and organic
kingdoms, together with gaseous substances; these latter being generally
derived from the atmosphere.By far the purest water which occurs in nature is rain-water, and if
this be collected in a secluded district, and after the air has been
well washed by previous rain, its purity is remarkable; the extraneous
matter consisting of little else than a trace of carbonic acid and other
gases dissolved from the air.In fact, such water is far purer than any
distilled water to be obtained in commerce.The case is very different
when the rain-water is collected in a town or densely populated
district, more especially if the water has been allowed to flow over
dirty roofs.The black and foully-smelling liquid popularly known as
soft water is so rich in carbonaceous and organic constituents as to be
of very limited use to the photographer; but by taking the precaution of
fitting up a simple automatic shunt for diverting the stream until the
roofs have been thoroughly washed, it becomes possible to insure a good
supply of clean and serviceable soft water, even in London.Several
forms of shunt have been devised, some of these being so complex as
to offer every prospect of speedy disorganization; but a simple and
efficient apparatus is figured in _Engineering_ by a correspondent who
signs himself "Millwright," and as we have thoroughly proved the value
of an apparatus which is practically identical, we reproduce the
substance of his communication.A gentleman of Newcastle, a retired banker, having tried various filters
to purify the rain-water collected on the roof of his house, at length
had the idea to allow no water to run into the cistern until the roof
had been well washed.After first putting up a hard-worked valve, the
arrangement as sketched below has been hit upon.Now Newcastle is a very
smoky place, and yet my friend gets water as pure as gin, and almost
absolutely free from any smack of soot.[Illustration]

The sketch explains itself.The weight, W, and the angle of the lever,
L, are such, that when the valve, V, is once opened it goes full open.A
small hole in the can C, acts like a cataract, and brings matters to a
normal state very soon after the rain ceases.The proper action of the apparatus can only be insured by a careful
adjustment of the weight, W, the angle through which the valve opens,
and the magnitude of the vessel, C. It is an advantage to make
the vessel, C, somewhat broader in proportion to its height than
represented, and to provide it with a movable strainer placed about half
way down.This tends to protect the cataract hole, and any accumulation
of leaves and dirt can be removed once in six months or so.Clean soft
water is valuable to the photographer in very many cases.Iron developer
(wet plate) free from chlorides will ordinarily remain effective on the
plate much longer than when chlorides are present, and the pyrogallic
solution for dry-plate work will keep good for along time if made with
soft water, while the lime which is present in hard water causes the
pyrogallic acid to oxidize with considerable rapidity.Negatives that
have been developed with oxalate developer often become covered with a
very unsightly veil of calcium oxalate when rinsed with hard water, and
something of a similar character occasionally occurs in the case of
silver prints which are transferred directly from the exposure frame to
impure water.To the carbon printer clean rain-water is of considerable value, as he
can develop much more rapidly with soft water than with hard water;
or, what comes to the same thing, he can dissolve away his superfluous
gelatine at a lower temperature than would otherwise be necessary.The cleanest rain-water which can ordinarily be collected in a town is
not sufficiently pure to be used with advantage in the preparation of
the nitrate bath, it being advisable to use the purest distilled water
for this purpose; and in many cases it is well to carefully distill
water for the bath in a glass apparatus of the kind figured below.[Illustration]

A, thin glass flask serving as a retort.The tube, T, is fitted
air-tight to the flask by a cork, C.

B, receiver into which the tube, T, fits quite loosely.D, water vessel intended to keep the spiral of lamp wick, which is shown
as surrounding T, in a moist condition.This wick acts as a siphon, and
water is gradually drawn over into the lower receptacle, E.

L, spirit lamp, which may, in many cases, be advantageously replaced by
a Bunsen burner.A small metal still, provided with a tin condensing worm, is, however, a
more generally serviceable arrangement, and if ordinary precautions are
taken to make sure that the worm tube is clean, the resulting distilled
water will be nearly as pure as that distilled in glass vessels.Such a still as that figured below can be heated conveniently over an
ordinary kitchen fire, and should find a place among the appliances
of every photographer.Distilled water should always be used in the
preparation of emulsion, as the impurities of ordinary water may often
introduce disturbing conditions.--_Photographic News_.[Illustration]

BLACK PHOSPHORUS.The author refers to the customary view that black phosphorus is
merely a mixture of the ordinary phosphorus with traces of a metallic
phosphide, and contends that this explanation is not in all cases
admissible.A specimen of black or rather dark gray phosphorus, which
the author submitted to the Academy, became white if melted and remained
white if suddenly cooled, but if allowed to enter into a state of
superfusion it became again black on contact with either white or black
phosphorus.A portion of the black specimen being dissolved in carbon
disulphide there remained undissolved merely a trace of a very pale
yellow matter which seemed to be amorphous phosphorus.--_Comptes

SCHREIBER'S APPARATUS FOR REVIVIFYING BONE-BLACK.We give opposite illustrations of Schreiber's apparatus for revivifying
bone-black or animal charcoal.The object of revivification is to render
the black fit to be used again after it has lost its decolorizing
properties through service--that is to say, to free its pores from the
absorbed salts and insoluble compounds that have formed therein
during the operation of sugar refining.There are two methods
employed--fermentation and washing.At present the tendency is to
abandon the former in order to proceed with as small a stock of black as
possible, and to adopt the method of washing with water and acid in a
rotary washer.1 and 2 represent a plan and elevation of a bone-black room,
containing light filters, A, arranged in a circle around wells, B. These
latter have the form of a prism with trapezoidal base, whose small sides
end at the same point, d, and the large ones at the filter.The funnel,
E, of the washer, F, is placed in the space left by the small ends of
the wells, so that the black may be taken from these latter and thrown
directly into the washer.The washer is arranged so that the black may
flow out near the steam fitter, G, beneath the floor.The discharge of
this filter is toward the side of the elevator, H, which takes in the
wet black below, and carries it up and pours it into the drier situated
at the upper part of the furnace.3 and 4, is
formed of two vertical wooden uprights, A, ten centimeters in thickness,
to which are fixed two round-iron bars the same as guides.The lift,
properly so-called, consists of an iron frame, C, provided at the four
angles with rollers, D, and supporting a swinging bucket, E, which, on
its arrival at the upper part of the furnace, allows the black to fall
to an inclined plane that leads it to the upper part of the drier.The
left is raised and lowered by means of a pitch-chain, F, fixed to the
middle of the frame, C, and passing over two pulleys, G, at the upper
part of the frame and descending to the mechanism that actuates it.This latter comprises a nut, I, acting directly on the chain; a toothed
wheel, K, and a pinion, J, gearing with the latter and keyed upon the
shaft of the pulleys, L and M. The diameter of the toothed wheel, K, is
0.295 of a meter, and it makes 53.4 revolutions per minute.The diameter
of the pinion is 0.197 of a meter, and it makes 80 revolutions per
minute.The pulleys, M and L, are 0.31 of a meter in diameter, and
make 80 revolutions per minute.Motion is transmitted to them by other
pulleys, N, keyed upon a shaft placed at the lower part, which receives
its motion from the engine of the establishment through the intermedium
of the pulley, O. The diameter of the latter is 0.385 of a meter, and
that of N is 0.58.1.--ELEVATION OF BONE-BLACK REVIVIFYING PLANT
(SCHREIBER'S SYSTEM.)3.--LATERAL VIEW OF ELEVATOR.4.--FRONT VIEW OF ELEVATOR.5.--CONTINUOUS FURNACE FOR REVIVIFYING BONE-BLACK.]The elevator is set in motion by the simple maneuver of the gearing
lever, P, and when this has been done all the other motions are effected
automatically._The Animal Black Furnace_.--This consists of a masonry casing of
rectangular form, in which are arranged on each side of the same
fire-place two rows of cast-iron retorts, D, of undulating form, each
composed of three parts, set one within the other.These retorts, which
serve for the revivification of the black, are incased in superposed
blocks of refractory clay, P, Q, S, designed to regularize the
transmission of heat and to prevent burning.These pieces are kept in
their respective places by crosspieces, R. The space between the retorts
occupied by the fire-place, Y, is covered with a cylindrical dome, O, of
refractory tiles, forming a fire-chamber with the inner surface of the
blocks, P, Q, and S. The front of the surface consists of a cast-iron
plate, containing the doors to the fire-place and ash pan, and a larger
one to allow of entrance to the interior to make repairs.One of the principal disadvantages of furnaces for revivifying animal
charcoal has been that they possessed no automatic drier for drying the
black on its exit from the washer.It was for the purpose of remedying
this that Mr.Schreiber was led to invent the automatic system of drying
shown at the upper part of the furnace, and which is formed of two
pipes, B, of undulating form, like the retorts, with openings throughout
their length for the escape of steam.Between these pipes there is a
closed space into which enters the waste heat and products of combustion
from the furnace.These latter afterward escape through the chimney at
the upper part.In order that the black may be put in bags on issuing from the furnace,
it must be cooled as much as possible.For this purpose there are
arranged on each side of the furnace two pieces of cast iron tubes, F,
of rectangular section, forming a prolongation of the retorts and making
with them an angle of about 45 degrees.The extremities of these tubes
terminate in hollow rotary cylinders, G, which permit of regulating the
flow of the black into a car, J (Fig.From what precedes, it will be readily understood how a furnace is run
on this plan.The bone-black in the hopper, A, descends into the drier, B, enters the
retorts, D, and, after revivification, passes into the cooling pipes, F,
from whence it issues cold and ready to be bagged.A coke fire having
been built in the fire-place, Y, the flames spread throughout the fire
chamber, direct themselves toward the bottom, divide into two parts to
the right and left, and heat the back of the retorts in passing.Then
the two currents mount through the lateral flues, V, and unite so as to
form but one in the drier.Within the latter there are arranged plates
designed to break the current from the flames, and allow it to heat all
the inner parts of the pipes, while the apertures in the drier allow of
the escape of the steam.By turning one of the cylinders, G, so as to present its aperture
opposite that of the cooler, it instantly fills up with black.At this
moment the whole column, from top to bottom, is set in motion.The
bone-black, in passing through the undulations, is thrown alternately to
the right and left until it finally reaches the coolers.This operation
is repeated as many times as the cylinder is filled during the descent
of one whole column, that is to say, about forty times.With an apparatus of the dimensions here described, 120 hectoliters
of bone-black may be revivified in twenty four hours, with 360 to 400
kilogrammes of coke.--_Annales Industrielles_.*       *       *       *       *

[Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No.SOAP AND ITS MANUFACTURE, FROM A CONSUMER'S POINT OF VIEW.In our last article, under the above heading, the advantages to be
gained by the use of potash soap as compared with soda soap were pointed
out, and the reasons of this superiority, especially in the case of
washing wool or woolen fabrics, were pretty fully gone into.It was also
further explained why the potash soaps generally sold to the public were
unfit for general use, owing to their not being neutral--that is to say,
containing a considerable excess of free or unsaponified alkali, which
acts injuriously on the fiber of any textile material, and causes sore
hands if used for household or laundry purposes.It was shown that the
cause of this defect was owing to the old-fashioned method of making
potash or soft soap, by boiling with wood ashes or other impure form of
potash; but that a perfectly pure and neutral potash soap could readily
be made with pure caustic potash, which within the last few years has
become a commercial article, manufactured on a large scale; just in
the same manner as the powdered 98 per cent.caustic soda, which was
recommended in our previous articles on making hard soap without
boiling.The process of making pure neutral potash soap is very simple, and
almost identical with that for making hard soap with pure powdered
caustic soda.The following directions, if carefully and exactly
followed, will produce a first-class potash soap, suitable either for
the woolen manufacturer for washing his wool, and the cloth afterward
made from it, or for household and laundry purposes, for which uses it
will be found far superior to any soda soap, no matter how pure or well
made it may be.Dissolve twenty pounds of pure caustic potash in two gallons of water.Pure caustic potash is very soluble, and dissolves almost immediately,
heating the water.Let the lye thus made cool until warm to the
hand--say about 90 F. Melt eighty pounds of tallow or grease, which must
be free from salt, and let it cool until fairly hot to the hand--say
130 F.; or eighty pounds of any vegetable or animal oil may be taken
instead.Now pour the caustic potash lye into the melted tallow or oil,
stirring with a flat wooden stirrer about three inches broad, until both
are thoroughly mixed and smooth in appearance.This mixing may be done
in the boiler used to melt the tallow, or in a tub, or half an oil
barrel makes a good mixing vessel.Wrap the tub or barrel well up in
blankets or sheepskins, and put away for a week in some warm dry place,
during which the mixture slowly turns into soap, giving a produce of
about 120 pounds of excellent potash soap.If this soap is made with
tallow or grease it will be nearly as hard as soda soap.When made by
farmers or householders tallow or grease will generally be taken, as it
is the cheapest, and ready to hand on the spot.For manufacturers, or
for making laundry soap, nothing could be better than cotton seed oil.A
magnificent soap can be made with this article, lathering very freely.When made with oil it is better to remelt in a kettle the potash soap,
made according to the above directions, with half its weight of water,
using very little heat, stirring constantly, and removing the fire as
soon as the water is mixed with and taken up by the soap.A beautifully
bright soap is obtained in this way, and curiously the soap is actually
made much harder and stiffer by this addition of water than when it is
in a more concentrated state previously to the water being added.With reference to the caustic potash for making the soap, it can be
obtained in all sizes of drums, but small packages just sufficient for
a batch of soap are generally more economical than larger packages, as
pure caustic potash melts and deteriorates very quickly when exposed
to the air.The Greenbank Alkali Co., of St.Helens, seems to have
appreciated this, and put upon the market pure caustic potash in twenty
pound canisters, which are very convenient for potash soft soap making
by consumers for their own use.While on this subject of caustic potash, it cannot be too often repeated
that _caustic potash_ is a totally different article to _caustic soda_,
though just like it in appearance, and therefore often sold as such.One of the most barefaced instances of this is the so-called "crystal
potash," "ball potash," or "rock potash," of the lye packers, sold in
one pound packages, which absolutely, without exception, do not contain
a single grain of potash, but simply consist of caustic soda more or
less adulterated--as a rule very much "more" than "less!"It is much
to be regretted that this fraud on the public has been so extensively
practiced, as potash has been greatly discredited by this procedure.The subject of fleece scouring or washing the wool while growing on
the sheep, with a potash soap made on the spot with the waste tallow
generally to be had on every sheep farm, seems recently to have been
attracting attention in some quarters, and certainly would be a source
of profit to sheep owners by putting their wool on the market in the
best condition, and at the same time cleaning the skin of the sheep.It
therefore appears to be a move in the right direction.In concluding this series of articles on practical soap making from a
consumer's point of view, the writer hopes that, although the subject
has been somewhat imperfectly handled, owing to necessarily limited
space and with many unavoidable interruptions, yet that they may have
been found of some interest and assistance to consumers of soap who
desire easily and readily to make a pure and unadulterated article for
their own use.*       *       *       *       *




COTTON SEED OIL.Having had occasion during the last six years to manufacture lead
plaster in considerable quantities, it occurred to me that cotton seed
oil might be used instead of olive oil, at less expense, and with as
good results.The making of this plaster with cotton seed oil has been
questioned, as, according to some authorities, the product is not of
good consistence, and is apt to be soft, sticky, and dark colored;
but in my experience such is not the case.If the U. S. P. process is
followed in making this plaster, substituting for the olive oil cotton
seed oil, and instead of one half-pint of boiling water one and one-half
pint are added, the product obtained will be equally as good as that
from olive oil.My results with this oil in making lead plaster led me
to try it in making the different liniments of the Pharmacopoeia, with
the following results:

_Linimentum Ammoniae_.--This liniment, made with cotton seed oil, is of
much better consistency than when made with olive oil.It is not so
thick, will pour easily out of the bottle, and if the ammonia used is of
proper strength, will make a perfect liniment._Linimentum Calcis_.--Cotton seed oil is not at all adapted to making
this liniment.It does not readily saponify, separates quickly, and it
is almost impossible to unite when separated._Linimentum Camphorae_.--Cotton seed oil is far superior to olive oil in
making this liniment, it being a much better solvent of camphor.It has
not that disagreeable odor so commonly found in the liniment._Linimentum Chloroformi_.--Cotton seed oil being very soluble in
chloroform, the liniment made with it leaves nothing to be desired._Linimentum Plumbi Subacetatis_.--When liq.is mixed
with cotton seed oil and allowed to stand for some time the oil assumes
a reddish color similar to that of freshly made tincture of myrrh.When
the liquor is mixed with olive oil, if the oil be pure, no such change
takes place.Noticing this change, it occurred to me that this would be
a simple and easy way to detect cotton seed oil when mixed with olive
oil.This change usually takes place after standing from twelve to
twenty-four hours.It is easily detected in mixtures containing five
per cent., or even less, of the oils, and I am convinced, after making
numerous experiments with different oils, that it is peculiar to cotton
seed oil.--_American Journal of Pharmacy_.*       *       *       *       *




THE FOOD AND ENERGY OF MAN.[Footnote: From a lecture delivered at the Sanitary Congress, at
Newcastle-on-Tyne, September 28, 1882.]DE CHAUMONT, F.R.S.Although eating cannot be said to be in any way a new fashion, it has
nevertheless been reserved for modern times, and indeed we may say the
present generation, to get a fairly clear idea of the way in which
food is really utilized for the work of our bodily frame.We must not,
however, plume ourselves too much upon our superior knowledge, for
inklings of the truth, more or less dim, have been had through all ages,
and we are now stepping into the inheritance of times gone by, using the
long and painful experience of our predecessors as the stepping-stone
to our more accurate knowledge of the present time.In this, as in many
other things, we are to some extent in the position of a dwarf on the
shoulders of a giant; the dwarf may, indeed, see further than the giant;
but he remains a dwarf, and the giant a giant.The question has been much discussed as to what the original food of man
was, and some people have made it a subject of excited contention.The
most reasonable conclusion is that man is naturally a frugivorous or
fruit-eating animal, like his cousins the monkeys, whom he still so
much resembles.This forms a further argument in favor of his being
originated in warm regions, where fruits of all kinds were plentiful.It
is pretty clear that the resort to animal food, whether the result of
the pressure of want from failure of vegetable products, or a mere taste
and a desire for change and more appetizing food, is one that took place
many ages ago, probably in the earliest anthropoid, if not in the latest
pithecoid stage.No doubt some advantage was recognized in the more
rapid digestion and the comparative ease with which the hunter or fisher
could obtain food, instead of waiting for the ripening of fruits in
countries which had more or less prolonged periods of cold and inclement
weather.Some anatomical changes have doubtless resulted from the
practice, but they are not of sufficiently marked character to found
much argument upon; all that we can say being that the digestive
apparatus in man seems well adapted for digesting any food that is
capable of yielding nutriment, and that even when an entire change is
made in the mode of feeding, the adaptability of the human system
shows itself in a more or less rapid accommodation to the altered
circumstances.Food, then, is any substance which can be taken into the body and
applied to use, either in building up or repairing the tissues and
framework of the body itself, or in providing energy and producing
animal heat, or any substance which, without performing those functions
directly, controls, directs, or assists their performance.With this
wide definition it is evident that we include all the ordinary articles
recognized commonly as food, and that we reject all substances
recognized commonly as poisons.But it will also include such substances
as water and air, both of which are essential for nutrition, but are not
usually recognized as belonging to the list of food substances in the
ordinary sense.When we carry our investigation further, we find that
the organic substances may be again divided into two distinct classes,
namely, that which contains nitrogen (the casein), and those that do not
(the butter and sugar).On ascertaining this, we are immediately struck with the remarkable fact
that all the tissues and fluids of the body, muscles (or flesh),
bone, blood--all, in short, except the fat--contain nitrogen, and,
consequently, for their building up in the young, and for their repair
and renewal in the adult, nitrogen is absolutely required.We therefore
reasonably infer that the nitrogenous substance is necessary for this
purpose.Experiment has borne this out, for men who have been compelled
to live without nitrogenous food by dire necessity, and criminals on
whom the experiment has been tried, have all perished sooner or later in
consequence.When nitrogenous substances are used in the body, they
are, of course, broken up and oxidized, or perhaps we ought to say more
accurately, they take the place of the tissues of the body which wear
away and are carried off by oxidation and other chemical changes.Now, modern science tell us that such changes are accompanied with
manifestations of energy in some form or other, most frequently in
that of heat, and we must look, therefore, upon nitrogenous food
as contributing to the energy of the body in addition to its other
functions.What are the substances which we may class as nitrogenous.In the first
place, we have the typical example of the purest form in _albumin_,
or white of egg; and from this the name is now given to the class of
_albuminates_.The animal albuminates are: Albumin from eggs, fibrin
from muscles, or flesh, myosin, or synronin, also from animals, casein
(or cheesy matter) from milk, and the nitrogenous substances from blood.In the vegetable kingdom, we have glutin, or vegetable fibrin, which is
the nourishing constituent of wheat, barley, oats, etc.; and legumin,
or vegetable casein, which is the peculiar substance found in peas and
beans.The other organic constituents--viz., the fats and the starches
and sugars--contain no nitrogen, and were at one time thought to be
concerned in producing animal heat.We now know--thanks to the labors of Joule, Lyon Playfair, Clausius,
Tyndall, Helmholtz, etc.--that heat itself is a mode of motion, a form
of convertible energy, which can be made to do useful or productive
work, and be expressed in terms of actual work done.Modern experiment
shows that all our energy is derived from that of food, and, in
particular from the non-nitrogenous part of it, that is, the fat,
starch, and sugar.The nutrition of man is best maintained when he is
provided with a due admixture of all the four classes of aliment which
we have mentioned, and not only that, but he is also better off if he
has a variety of each class.Thus he may and ought to have albumen,
fibrine, gluten, and casein among the albuminates, or at least two of
them; butter and lard, or suet, or oil among the fats; starch of wheat,
potato, rice, peas, etc., and cane-sugar, and milk-sugar among the
carbo-hydrates.The salts cannot be replaced, so far as we know.Life
may be maintained in fair vigor for some time on albuminates only, but
this is done at the expense of the tissues, especially the fat of the
body, and the end must soon come; with fat and carbo hydrates alone
vigor may also be maintained for some time, at the expense of the
tissues also, but the limit is a near one, In either of these cases we
suppose sufficient water and salts to be provided.We must now inquire into the quantities of food necessary; and this
necessitates a little consideration of the way in which the work of
the body is carried on.We must look upon the human body exactly as a
machine; like an engine with which we are all so familiar.A certain
amount of work requires to be done, say, a certain number of miles of
distance to be traversed; we know that to do this a certain number of
pounds, or hundredweights, or tons of coal must be put into the fire of
the boiler in order to furnish the requisite amount of energy through
the medium of steam.This amount of fuel must bear a certain proportion
to the work, and also to the velocity with which it is done, so both
quantity and time have to be accounted for.No lecture on diet would be complete without a reference to the vexed
question of alcohol.I am no teetotal advocate, and I repudiate the
rubbish too often spouted from teetotal platforms, talk that is,
perhaps, inseparable from the advocacy of a cause that imports a good
deal of enthusiasm.I am at one, however, in recognizing the evils of
excess, and would gladly hail their diminution.But I believe that
alcohol properly used may be a comfort and a blessing, just as I know
that improperly used it becomes a bane and a curse.But we are now
concerned with it as an article of diet in relation to useful work, and
it may be well to call attention markedly to the fact that its use in
this way is very limited.Parkes, made
in our laboratory, at Netley, were conclusive on the point, that beyond
an amount that would be represented by about one and a half to two pints
of beer, alcohol no longer provided any convertible energy, and that,
therefore, to take it in the belief that it did do so is an error.It may give a momentary stimulus in considerable doses, but this is
invariably followed by a corresponding depression, and it is a maxim now
generally followed, especially on service, never to give it before or
during work.There are, of course, some persons who are better without
it altogether, and so all moderation ought to be commended, if not
enjoyed.There are other beverages which are more useful than the alcoholic,
as restoratives, and for support in fatigue.Another excellent restorative is a weak solution
of Liebig's extract of meat, which has a remarkable power of removing
fatigue.Perhaps one of the most useful and most easily obtainable is
weak oatmeal gruel, either hot or cold.With regard to tobacco, it also
has some value in lessening fatigue in those who are able to take it,
but it may easily be carried to excess.Of it we may say, as of alcohol,
that in moderation it seems harmless, and even useful to some extent,
but, in excess, it is rank poison.There is one other point which I must refer to, and which is especially
interesting to a great seaport like this.This is the question of
scurvy--a question of vital importance to a maritime nation.Thomas Gray, of the Board of Trade, discloses the
regrettable fact that since 1873 there has been a serious falling off,
the outbreaks of scurvy having again increased until they reached
ninety-nine in 1881.Gray seems to think, is due to a neglect
of varied food scales; but it may also very probably have arisen from
the neglect of the regulation about lime-juice, either as to issue or
quality, or both.But it is also a fact of very great importance that
mere monotony of diet has a most serious effect upon health; variety
of food is not merely a pandering to gourmandism or greed, but a real
sanitary benefit, aiding digestion and assimilation.Our Board of Trade
has nothing to do with the food scales of ships, but Mr.Gray hints that
the Legislature will have to interfere unless shipowners look to it
themselves.The ease with which preserved foods of all kinds can be
obtained and carried now removes the last shadow of an excuse for
backwardness in this matter, and in particular the provision of a large
supply of potatoes, both fresh and dried, ought to be an unceasing care;
this is done on board American ships, and to this is doubtless owing in
a great part the healthiness of their crews.Scurvy in the present
day is a disgrace to shipowners and masters; and if public opinion is
insufficient to protect the seamen, the legislature will undoubtedly
step in and do so.And now let me close by pointing out that the study of this commonplace
matter of eating and drinking opens out to us the conception of the
grand unity of nature; since we see that the body of man differs in no
way essentially from other natural combinations, but is subject to
the same universal physical laws, in which there is no blindness, no
variableness, no mere chance, and disobedience of which is followed as
surely by retribution as even the keenest eschatologist might desire.*       *       *       *       *




RATTLESNAKE POISON.By HENRY H. CROFT.Some time since, in a paper to which I am unfortunately unable to refer,
a French chemist affirmed that the poisonous principle in snakes, or
eliminated by snakes, was of the nature of an alkaloid, and gave a name
to this class of bodies.Pedler has shown that snake poison is destroyed or neutralized
by means of platinic chloride, owing probably to the formation of an
insoluble double platinic chloride, such as is formed with almost if not
all alkaloids.In this country (Texas) where rattlesnakes are very common, and persons
camping out much exposed to their bites, a very favorite anecdote, or
_remedia_ as the Mexicans cull it, is a strong solution of iodine in
potassium iodide.[1]

[Footnote 1: The solution is applied as soon as possible to the wound,
preferably enlarged, and a few drops taken internally.The common
Mexican _remedia_ is the root of the _Agave virginica_ mashed or chewed
and applied to the wound, while part is swallowed.Great faith is placed in this root by all residents here, who are seldom
I without it, but, I have had no experience of it myself; and the
internal administration is no doubt useless.Even the wild birds know of this root; the queer paisano (?ground
woodpecker) which eats snakes, when wounded by a _vibora de cascabel_,
runs into woods, digs up and eats a root of the agave, just like the
mongoose; but more than that, goes back, polishes off his enemy, and
eats him.This has been told me by Mexicans who, it may be remarked, are
not _always_ reliable.]I have had occasion to prove the efficacy of this mixture in two cases
of _cascabel_ bites, one on a buck, the other on a dog; and it occurred
to me that the same explanation of its action might be given as above
for the platinum salt, viz., the formation of an insoluble iodo compound
as with ordinary alkaloids if the snake poison really belongs to this
class.Having last evening killed a moderate sized rattlesnake--_Crotalus
horridus_--which had not bitten anything, I found the gland fully
charged with the white opaque poison; on adding iodine solution to a
drop of this a dense light-brown precipitate was immediately formed,
quite similar to that obtained with most alkaloids, exhibiting under the
microscope no crystalline structure.In the absence of iodine a good extemporaneous solution for testing
alkaloids, and perhaps a snake poison antidote, may be made by adding a
few drops of ferric chloride to solution of potassium of iodide; this
is a very convenient test agent which I used in my laboratory for many
years.Although rattlesnake poison could be obtained here in very considerable
quantity, it is out of my power to make such experiments as I could
desire, being without any chemical appliances and living a hundred miles
or more from any laboratory.The same may be said with regard to books,
and possibly the above iodine reaction has been already described.Richards states that the cobra poison is destroyed by potassium
permanganate; but this is no argument in favor of that salt as an
antidote.Pedler also refers to it, but allows that it would not be
probably of any use after the poison had been absorbed.Of this I
think there can be no doubt, remembering the easy decomposition of
permanganate by most organic substances, and I cannot but think that the
medicinal or therapeutic advantages of that salt, taken internally, are
equally problematical, unless the action is supposed to take place in
the stomach.In the bladder of the same rattlesnake I found a considerable
quantity of light-brown amorphous ammonium urate, the urine pale
yellow.--_Chemical News_.*       *       *       *       *




THE CHINESE SIGN MANUAL.D. J. Macgowan, in Medical Reports of China.Two writers in _Nature_, both having for their theme "Skin-furrows on
the Hand," solicit information on the subject from China.[1] As the
subject is considered to have a bearing on medical jurisprudence and
ethnology as well, this report is a suitable vehicle for responding to
the demand.[Footnote 1: Henry Faulds, Tzukiyi Hospital, Tokio, Japan.W. J.
Herschel, Oxford, England.--_Nature_, 28th October and 25th November,
1880.]Faulds' observations on the finger-tips of the Japanese have an
ethnic bearing and relate to the subject of heredity.Herschel
considers the subject as an agent of Government, he having charge for
twenty years of registration offices in India, where he employed finger
marks as sign manuals, the object being to prevent personation and
repudiation.Doolittle, in his "Social Life of the Chinese," describes
the custom.I cannot now refer to native works where the practice of
employing digital rugae as a sign manual is alluded to.I doubt if its
employment in the courts is of ancient date.Well-informed natives think
that it came into vogue subsequent to the Han period; if so, it is in
Egypt that earliest evidence of the practice is to be found.Just as the
Chinese courts now require criminals to sign confessions by impressing
thereto the whorls of their thumb-tips--the right thumb in the case of
women, the left in the case of men--so the ancient Egyptians, it
is represented, required confessions to be sealed with their
thumbnails--most likely the tip of the digit, as in China.Great
importance is attached in the courts to this digital form of signature,
"finger form."Without a confession no criminal can be legally executed,
and the confession to be valid must be attested by the thumb-print
of the prisoner.No direct coercion is employed to secure this; a
contumacious culprit may, however, be tortured until he performs the
act which is a prerequisite to his execution.Digital signatures are
sometimes required in the army to prevent personation; the general
in command at Wenchow enforces it on all his troops.A document thus
attested can no more be forged or repudiated than a photograph--not so
easily, for while the period of half a lifetime effects great changes
in the physiognomy, the rugae of the fingers present the same appearance
from the cradle to the grave; time writes no wrinkles there.In the
army everywhere, when the description of a person is written down, the
relative number of volutes and coniferous finger-tips is noted.It
is called taking the "whelk striae," the fusiform being called "rice
baskets," and the volutes "peck measures."A person unable to write, the
form of signature which defies personation or repudiation is required in
certain domestic cases, as in the sale of children or women.Often when
a child is sold the parents affix their finger marks to the bill of
sale; when a husband puts away his wife, giving her a bill of divorce,
he marks the document with his entire palm; and when a wife is sold, the
purchaser requires the seller to stamp the paper with hands and feet,
the four organs duly smeared with ink.Professional fortune tellers in
China take into account almost the entire system of the person whose
future they attempt to forecast, and of course they include palmistry,
but the rugae of the finger-ends do not receive much attention.Amateur
fortune-tellers, however, discourse as glibly on them as phrenologists
do of "bumps"--it is so easy.In children the relative number of volute
and conical striae indicate their future."If there are nine volutes,"
says a proverb, "to one conical, the boy will attain distinction without
toil."Regarded from an ethnological point of view, I can discover merely that
the rugae of Chinamen's fingers differ from Europeans', but there is so
little uniformity observable that they form no basis for distinction,
and while the striae may be noteworthy points in certain medico-legal
questions, heredity is not one of them.*       *       *       *       *




LUCIDITY.At the close of an interesting address lately delivered at the reopening
of the Liverpool University College and School of Medicine, Mr.Matthew
Arnold said if there was one word which he should like to plant in the
memories of his audience, and to leave sticking there after he had gone,
it was the word _lucidity_.If he had to fix upon the three great wants
at this moment of the three principal nations of Europe, he should say
that the great want of the French was morality, that the great want of
the Germans was civil courage, and that our own great want was lucidity.Our own want was, of course, what concerned us the most.People were apt
to remark the defects which accompanied certain qualities, and to think
that the qualities could not be desirable because of the defects which
they saw accompanying them.There was no greater and salutary lesson for
men to learn than that a quality may be accompanied, naturally perhaps,
by grave dangers; that it may actually present itself accompanied by
terrible defects, and yet that it might itself be indispensable.Let him
illustrate what he meant by an example, the force of which they would
all readily feel.Seriousness was a quality of our nation.Perhaps
seriousness was always accompanied by certain dangers.But, at any rate,
many of our French neighbors would say that they found our seriousness
accompanied by so many false ideas, so much prejudice, so much that was
disagreeable, that it could not have the value which we attributed to
it.Let them follow the same
mode of reasoning as to the quality of lucidity.The French had a
national turn for lucidity as we had a national turn for seriousness.Perhaps a national turn for lucidity carried with it always certain
dangers.Be this as it might, it was certain that we saw in the French,
along with their lucidity, a want of seriousness, a want of reverence,
and other faults, which greatly displeased us.Many of us were inclined
in consequence to undervalue their lucidity, or to deny that they
had it.We were wrong: it existed as our seriousness existed; it was
valuable as our seriousness was valuable.Both the one and the other
were valuable, and in the end indispensable.It was negatively that the French have it, and he
would therefore deal with its negative character merely.Negatively,
lucidity was the perception of the want of truth and validness in
notions long current, the perception that they are no longer possible,
that their time is finished, and they can serve us no more.All through
the last century a prodigious travail for lucidity was going forward
in France.Its principal agent was a man whose name excited generally
repulsion in England, Voltaire.Voltaire did a great deal of harm in
France.But it was not by his lucidity that he did harm; he did it by
his want of seriousness, his want of reverence, his want of sense for
much that is deepest in human nature.Conduct was three-fourths of life, and a man who
worked for conduct, therefore, worked for more than a man who worked for
intelligence.But having promised this, it might be said that the Luther
of the eighteenth century and of the cultivated classes was Voltaire.As Luther had an antipathy to what was immoral, so Voltaire had an
antipathy to what was absurd, and both of them made war upon the object
of their antipathy with such masterly power, with so much conviction,
so much energy, so much genius, that they carried their world with
them--Luther his Protestant world, and Voltaire his French world--and
the cultivated classes throughout the continent of Europe generally.Voltaire had more than negative lucidity; he had the large and true
conception that a number and equilibrium of activities were necessary
for man."_Il faut douner a notre ame toutes les formes possibles_"
was a maxim which Voltaire really and truly applied in practice,
"advancing," as Michelet finely said of him, in every direction with
a marvelous vigor and with that conquering ambition which Vico called
_mens heroica_.Voltaire's signal characteristic was his
lucidity, his negative lucidity.There was a great and free intellectual movement in England in the
eighteenth century--indeed, it was from England that it passed into
France; but the English had not that strong natural bent for lucidity
which the French had.Our leading thinkers had not the genius and passion for lucidity which
distinguished Voltaire.In their free inquiry they soon found themselves
coming into collision with a number of established facts, beliefs,
conventions.Thereupon all sorts of practical considerations began to
sway them.The danger signal went up, they often stopped short, turned
their eyes another way, or drew down a curtain between themselves and
the light."It seems highly probable," said Voltaire, "that nature has
made thinking a portion of the brain, as vegetation is a function of
trees; that we think by the brain just as we walk by the feet."So our
reason, at least, would lead us to conclude, if the theologians did not
assure us of the contrary; such, too, was the opinion of Locke, but he
did not venture to announce it.The French Revolution came, England grew
to abhor France, and was cut off from the Continent, did great things,
gained much, but not in lucidity.The Continent was reopened, the
century advanced, time and experience brought their lessons, lovers of
free and clear thought, such as the late John Stuart Mill, arose among
us.But we could not say that they had by any means founded among us the
reign of lucidity.Let them consider that movement of which we were hearing so much just
now: let them look at the Salvation Army and its operations.They would
see numbers, funds, energy, devotedness, excitement, conversions, and
a total absence of lucidity.A little lucidity would make the whole
movement impossible.That movement took for granted as its basis what
was no longer possible or receivable; its adherents proceeded in all
they did on the assumption that that basis was perfectly solid, and
neither saw that it was not solid, nor ever even thought of asking
themselves whether it was solid or not.Taking a very different movement, and one of far higher dignity and
import, they had all had before their minds lately the long-devoted,
laborious, influential, pure, pathetic life of Dr.Pusey, which had just
ended.Many of them had also been reading in the lively volumes of that
acute, but not always good-natured rattle, Mr.Mozley, an account of
that great movement which took from Dr.Of its
later stage of Ritualism they had had in this country a now celebrated
experience.It had produced men to
be respected, men to be admired, men to be beloved, men of learning,
goodness, genius, and charm.But could they resist the truth that
lucidity would have been fatal to it?The movers of all those questions
about apostolical succession, church patristic authority, primitive
usage, postures, vestments--questions so passionately debated, and on
which he would not seek to cast ridicule--did not they all begin by
taking for granted something no longer possible or receivable, build on
this basis as if it were indubitably solid, and fail to see that their
basis not being solid, all they built upon it was fantastic?He would not say that negative lucidity was in itself a satisfactory
possession, but he said that it was inevitable and indispensable, and
that it was the condition of all serious construction for the future.Without it at present a man or a nation was intellectually and
spiritually all abroad.If they saw it accompanied in France by much
that they shrank from, they should reflect that in England it would
have influences joined with it which it had not in France--the natural
seriousness of the people, their sense of reverence and respect, their
love for the past.Come it must; and here where it had been so late in
coming, it would probably be for the first time seen to come without
danger.Capitals were natural centers of mental movement, and it was natural for
the classes with most leisure, most freedom, most means of cultivation,
and most conversance with the wide world to have lucidity though often
they had it not.To generate a spirit of lucidity in provincial towns,
and among the middle classes bound to a life of much routine and plunged
in business, was more difficult.Schools and universities, with serious
and disinterested studies, and connecting those studies the one with the
other and continuing them into years of manhood, were in this case the
best agency they could use.It might be slow, but it was sure.Such
an agency they were now going to employ.Might it fulfill all their
expectations!Might their students, in the words quoted just now,
advance in every direction with a marvelous vigor, and with that
conquering ambition which Vico called _mens heroica_!And among the many
good results of this, might one result be the acquisition in their midst
of that indispensable spirit--the spirit of lucidity!*       *       *       *       *




ON SOME APPARATUS THAT PERMIT OF ENTERING FLAMES.[Footnote: A. de Rochas in the _Revue Scientifique_.]In the following notes I shall recall a few experiments that indicate
under what conditions the human organism is permitted to remain unharmed
amid flames.These experiments were published in England in 1882, in the
twelfth letter from Brewster to Walter Scott on natural magic.They are,
I believe, not much known in France, and possess a practical interest
for those who are engaged in the art of combating fires.At the end of the last century Humphry Davy observed that, on placing a
very fine wire gauze over a flame, the latter was cooled to such a
point that it could not traverse the meshes.This phenomenon, which he
attributed to the conductivity and radiating power of the metal, he soon
utilized in the construction of a lamp for miners.Some years afterward Chevalier Aldini, of Milan, conceived the idea of
making a new application of Davy's discovery in the manufacture of an
envelope that should permit a man to enter into the midst of flames.This envelope, which was made of metallic gauze with 1-25th of an inch
meshes, was composed of five pieces, as follows: (1) a helmet, with
mask, large enough, to allow a certain space between it and the internal
bonnet of which I shall speak; (2) a cuirass with armlets; (3) a skirt
for the lower part of the belly and the thighs; (4) a pair of boots
formed of a double wire gauze; and (5) a shield five feet long by one
and a half wide, formed of metallic gauze stretched over a light iron
frame.Beneath this armor the experimenter was clad in breeches and a
close coat of coarse cloth that had previously been soaked in a solution
of alum.The head, hands, and feet were covered by envelopes of asbestos
cloth whose fibers were about a half millimeter in diameter.The bonnet
contained apertures for the eyes, nose, and ears, and consisted of a
single thickness of fabric, as did the stockings, but the gloves were of
double thickness, so that the wearer could seize burning objects with
the hands.Aldini, convinced of the services that his apparatus might render to
humanity, traveled over Europe and gave gratuitous representations with
it.The exercises generally took place in the following order: Aldini
began by first wrapping his finger in asbestos and then with a double
layer of wire gauze.He then held it for some instants in the flame of
a candle or alcohol lamp.One of his assistants afterward put on the
asbestos glove of which I have spoken, and, protecting the palm of his
hand with another piece of asbestos cloth, seized a piece of red-hot
iron from a furnace and slowly carried it to a distance of forty or
fifty meters, lighted some straw with it, and then carried it back to
the furnace.On other occasions, the experimenters, holding firebrands
in their hands, walked for five minutes over a large grating under which
fagots were burning.In order to show how the head, eyes, and lungs were protected by the
wire gauze apparatus, one of the experimenters put on the asbestos
bonnet, helmet, and cuirass, and fixed the shield in front of his
breast.Then, in a chafing dish placed on a level with his shoulder, a
great fire of shavings was lighted, and care was taken to keep it up.Into the midst of these flames the experimenter then plunged his head
and remained thus five or six minutes with his face turned toward them.In an exhibition given at Paris before a committee from the Academic
des Sciences, there were set up two parallel fences formed of straw,
connected by iron wire to light wicker work, and arranged so as to leave
between them a passage 3 feet wide by 30 long.The heat was so intense,
when the fences were set on fire, that no one could approach nearer than
20 or 25 feet; and the flames seemed to fill the whole space between
them, and rose to a height of 9 or 10 feet.Six men clad in the Aldini
suit went in, one behind the other, between the blazing fences, and
walked slowly backward and forward in the narrow passage, while the fire
was being fed with fresh combustibles from the exterior.One of these
men carried on his back, in an ozier basket covered with wire gauze, a
child eight years of age, who had on no other clothing than an asbestos
bonnet.This same man, having the child with him, entered on another
occasion a clear fire whose flames reached a height of 18 feet, and
whose intensity was such that it could not be looked at.He remained
therein so long that the spectators began to fear that he had succumbed;
but he finally came out safe and sound.One of the conclusions to be drawn from the facts just stated is that
man can breathe in the midst of flames.This marvelous property cannot
be attributed exclusively to the cooling of the air by its passage
through the gauze before reaching the lungs; it shows also a very great
resistance of our organs to the action of heat.The following, moreover,
are direct proofs of such resistance.In England, in their first
experiment, Messrs.Joseph Banks, Charles Blagden, and Dr.Solander
remained for ten minutes in a hot-house whose temperature was 211 deg.Fahr., and their bodies preserved therein very nearly the usual heat.On
breathing against a thermometer they caused the mercury to fall several
degrees.Each expiration, especially when it was somewhat strong,
produced in their nostrils an agreeable impression of coolness, and the
same impression was also produced on their fingers when breathed upon.When they touched themselves their skin seemed to be as cold as that of
a corpse; but contact with their watch chains caused them to experience
a sensation like that of a burn.A thermometer placed under the tongue
of one of the experimenters marked 98 deg.Fahr., which is the normal
temperature of the human species.Emboldened by these first results, Blagden entered a hot-house in which
the thermometer in certain parts reached 262 deg.He remained therein
eight minutes, walked about in all directions, and stopped in the
coolest part, which was at 240 deg.During all this time he
experienced no painful sensations; but, at the end of seven minutes, he
felt an oppression of the lungs that inquieted him and caused him to
leave the place.His pulse at that moment showed 144 beats to the
minute, that is to say, double what it usually did.To ascertain whether
there was any error in the indications of the thermometer, and to find
out what effect would take place on inert substances exposed to the hot
air that he had breathed, Blogden placed some eggs in a zinc plate in
the hot-house, alongside the thermometer, and found that in twenty
minutes they were baked hard.A case is reported where workmen entered a furnace for drying moulds, in
England, the temperature of which was 177 deg., and whose iron sole plate
was so hot that it carbonized their wooden shoes.In the immediate
vicinity of this furnace the temperature rose to 160 deg.Persons not of
the trade who approached anywhere near the furnace experienced pain in
the eyes, nose, and ears.A baker is cited in Angoumois, France, who spent ten minutes in a
furnace at 132 deg.C.

The resistance of the human organism to so high temperatures can be
attributed to several causes.First, it has been found that the quantity
of carbonic acid exhaled by the lungs, and consequently the chemical
phenomena of internal combustion that are a source of animal heat,
diminish in measure as the external temperature rises.Hence, a conflict
which has for result the retardation of the moment at which a living
being will tend, without obstacle, to take the temperature of the
surrounding medium.On another hand, it has been observed that man
resists heat so much the less in proportion as the air is saturated
with vapors.Berger, who supported for seven minutes a temperature
varying from 109 deg.C. in dry air, could remain only twelve
minutes in a bagnio whose temperature rose from 41 deg.At the
Hammam of Paris the highest temperature obtained is 87 deg., and Dr.E.
Martin has not been able to remain therein more than five minutes.This
physician reports that in 1743, the thermometer having exceeded 40 deg.at
Pekin, 14,000 persons perished.These facts are explained by the cooling
that the evaporation of perspiration produces on the surface of the
body.Edwards has calculated that such evaporation is ten times greater
in dry air in motion than in calm and humid air.The observations become
still more striking when the skin is put in contact with a liquid or a
solid which suppresses perspiration.Lemoine endured a bath of Bareges
water of 37 deg.for half an hour; but at 45 deg.he could not remain in it more
than seven minutes, and the perspiration began to flow at the end of six
minutes.According to Brewster, persons who experience no malaise near
a fire which communicates a temperature of 100 deg.C. to them, can hardly
bear contact with alcohol and oil at 55 deg.The facts adduced permit us to understand how it was possible to bear
one of the proofs to which it is said those were submitted who wished
to be initiated into the Egyptian mysteries.In a vast vaulted chamber
nearly a hundred feet long, there were erected two fences formed of
posts, around which were wound branches of Arabian balm, Egyptian thorn,
and tamarind--all very flexible and inflammable woods.When this was set
on fire the flames arose as far as the vault, licked it, and gave the
chamber the appearance of a hot furnace, the smoke escaping through
pipes made for the purpose.Then the door was suddenly opened before the
neophyte, and he was ordered to traverse this burning place, whose floor
was composed of an incandescent grating.The Abbe Terrason recounts all these details in his historic romance
"Sethos," printed at the end of last century.Unfortunately literary
frauds were in fashion then, and the book, published as a translation of
an old Greek manuscript, gives no indication of sources.I have sought
in special works for the data which the abbe must have had as a basis,
but I have not been able to find them.I suppose, however, that
this description, which is so precise, is not merely a work of the
imagination.The author goes so far as to give the dimensions of the
grating (30 feet by 8), and, greatly embarrassed to explain how his hero
was enabled to traverse it without being burned, is obliged to suppose
it to have been formed of very thick bars, between which Sethos had care
to place his feet.He who had the
courage to rush, head bowed, into the midst of the flames, certainly
would not have amused himself by choosing the place to put his feet.Braving the fire that surrounded his entire body, he must have had no
other thought than that of reaching the end of his dangerous voyage as
soon as possible.We cannot see very well, moreover, how this immense
grate, lying on the ground, was raised to a red heat and kept at such a
temperature.It is infinitely more simple to suppose that between the
two fences there was a ditch sufficiently deep in which a fire had
also been lighted, and which was covered by a grating as in the Aldini
experiments.It is even probable that this grating was of copper,
which, illuminated by the fireplace, must have presented a terrifying
brilliancy, while in reality it served only to prevent the flames from
the fireplace reaching him who dared to brave them.*       *       *       *       *




THE BUILDING STONE SUPPLY.The use of stone as a building material was not resorted to, except to
a trifling extent, in this country until long after the need of such a
solid substance was felt.The early settler contented himself with the
log cabin, the corduroy road, and the wooden bridge, and loose stone
enough for foundation purposes could readily be gathered from the
surface of the earth.Even after the desirability of more handsome and
durable building material for public edifices in the colonial cities
than wood became apparent, the ample resources which nature had afforded
in this country were overlooked, and brick and stone were imported by
the Dutch and English settlers from the Old World.Thus we find the
colonists of the New Netherlands putting yellow brick on their list
of non-dutiable imports in 1648; and such buildings in Boston as are
described as being "fairly set forth with brick, tile, slate, and
stone," were thus provided only with foreign products.Isolated
instances of quarrying stone are known to have occurred in the last
century; but they are rare.The edifice known as "King's Chapel,"
Boston, erected in 1752, is the first one on record as being built from
American stone; this was granite, brought from Braintree, Mass.Granite is a rock particularly abundant in New England, though also
found in lesser quantities elsewhere in this country.The first granite
quarries that were extensively developed were those at Quincy, Mass.,
and work began at that point early in the present century.The fame of
the stone became widespread, and it was sent to distant markets--even to
New Orleans.The old Merchants' Exchange in New York (afterward used as
a custom house) the Astor House in that city, and the Custom House in
New Orleans, all nearly or quite fifty years old, were constructed of
Quincy granite, as were many other fine buildings along the Atlantic
coast.In later years, not only isolated public edifices, but also whole
blocks of stores, have been constructed of this material.It was from
the Quincy quarries that the first railroad in this country was built;
this was a horse-railroad, three miles long, extending to Neponset
River, built in 1827.Other points in Massachusetts have been famed for their excellent
granite.After Maine was set off as a distinct State, Fox Island
acquired repute for its granite, and built up an extensive traffic
therein.Westerly, R.I., has also been engaged in quarrying this
valuable rock for many years, most of its choicer specimens having been
wrought for monumental purposes.Statues and other elaborate monumental
designs are now extensively made therefrom.Smaller pieces and a coarser
quality of the stone are here and elsewhere along the coast obtained in
large quantities for the construction of massive breakwaters to protect
harbors.Another point famous for its granite is Staten Island, New
York.This stone weighs 180 pounds to the cubic foot, while the Quincy
granite weighs but 165.The Staten Island product is used not only for
building purposes, but is also especially esteemed for paving after both
the Russ and Belgian patents.New York and other cities derive large
supplies from this source.The granite of Weehawken, N.J., is of the
same character, and greatly in demand.Port Deposit, Md., and Richmond,
Va, are also centers of granite production.Near Abbeville, S.C., and
in Georgia, granite is found quite like that of Quincy.Much southern
granite, however, decomposes readily, and is almost as soft as clay.This variety of stone is found in great abundance in the Rocky
Mountains; but, except to a slight extent in California, it is not yet
quarried there.Granite, having little grain, can be cut into blocks of almost any size
and shape.Specimens as much as eighty feet long have been taken out and
transported great distances.The quarrying is done by drilling a series
of small holes, six inches or more deep and almost the same distance
apart, inserting steel wedges along the whole line and then tapping each
gently with a hammer in succession, in order that the strain may be
evenly distributed.A building material that came into use earlier than granite is known as
freestone or sandstone; although its first employment does not date back
further than the erection of King's Chapel, Boston, already referred to
as the earliest well-known occasion where granite was used in building.Altogether the most famous American sandstone quarries are those at
Portland, on the Connecticut River, opposite Middletown.These were
worked before the Revolution; and their product has been shipped to many
distant points in the country.The long rows of "brownstone fronts" in
New York city are mostly of Portland stone, though in many cases the
walls are chiefly of brick covered with thin layers of the stone.The
old red sandstone of the Connecticut valley is distinguished in geology
for the discovery of gigantic fossil footprints of birds, first noticed
in the Portland quarries in 1802.Some of these footprints measured
ten to sixteen inches, and they were from four to six feet apart.The
sandstone of Belleville, N.J., has also extensive use and reputation.Trinity Church in New York city and the Boston Atheneum are built of the
product of these quarries; St.Lawrence County, New York, is noted also
for a fine bed of sandstone.At Potsdam it is exposed to a depth of
seventy feet.There are places though, in New England, New York, and
Eastern Pennsylvania, where a depth of three hundred feet has been
reached.The Potsdam sandstone is often split to the thinness of an
inch.It hardens by exposure, and is often used for smelting furnace
hearth-stones.Shawangunk Mountain, in Ulster County, yields a sandstone
of inferior quality, which has been unsuccessfully tried for paving;
as it wears very unevenly.From Ulster, Greene, and Albany Counties
sandstone slabs for sidewalks are extensively quarried for city use;
the principal outlets of these sections being Kingston, Saugerties,
Coxsackie, Bristol, and New Baltimore, on the Hudson.In this region
quantities amounting to millions of square feet are taken out in large
sheets, which are often sawed into the sizes desired.The vicinity of
Medina, in Western New York, yields a sandstone extensively used in that
section for paving and curbing, and a little for building.A rather poor
quality of this stone has been found along the Potomac, and some of it
was used in the erection of the old Capitol building at Washington.Ohio yields a sandstone that is of a light gray color; Berea, Amherst,
Vermilion, and Massillon are the chief points of production.Genevieve, Mo., yields a stone of fine grain of a light straw color,
which is quite equal to the famous Caen stone of France.The Lake
Superior sandstones are dark and coarse grained, but strong.In some parts of the country, where neither granite nor sandstone
is easily procured, blue and gray limestone are sometimes used for
building, and, when hammer dressed, often look like granite.A serious
objection to their use, however, is the occasional presence of iron,
which rusts on exposure, and defaces the building.In Western New York
they are widely used.Topeka stone, like the coquine of Florida and
Bermuda, is soft like wood when first quarried, and easily wrought,
but it hardens on exposure.The limestones of Canton, Mo., Joliet and
Athens, Ill., Dayton, Sandusky, Marblehead, and other points in Ohio,
Ellittsville, Ind., and Louisville and Bowling Green, Ky., are great
favorites west.In many of these regions limestone is extensively used
for macadamizing roads, for which it is excellently adapted.It also
yields excellent slabs or flags for sidewalks.One of the principal uses of this variety of stone is its conversion, by
burning, into lime for building purposes.All limestones are by no
means equally excellent in this regard.Thomaston lime, burned with
Pennsylvania coal, near the Penobscot River, has had a wide reputation
for nearly half a century.It has been shipped thence to all points
along the Atlantic coast, invading Virginia as far as Lynchburg, and
going even to New Orleans, Smithfield, R.I., and Westchester County,
N.Y., near the lower end of the Highlands, also make a particularly
excellent quality of lime.Kingston, in Ulster County, makes an inferior
sort for agricultural purposes.The Ohio and other western stones yield
a poor lime, and that section is almost entirely dependent on the east
for supplies.Marbles, like limestones, with which they are closely related, are very
abundant in this country, and are also to be found in a great variety of
colors.As early as 1804 American marble was used for statuary purposes.Early in the century it also obtained extensive employment for
gravestones.Its use for building purposes has been more recent than
granite and sandstone in this country; and it is coming to supersede the
latter to a great degree.For mantels, fire-places, porch pillars, and
like ornamental purposes, however, our variegated, rich colored and
veined or brecciated marbles were in use some time before exterior walls
were made from them.Among the earliest marble buildings were Girard
College in Philadelphia and the old City Hall in New York, and the
Custom House in the latter city, afterward used for a sub-treasury.The
new Capitol building at Washington is among the more recent structures
composed of this material.Our exports of marble to Cuba and elsewhere
amount to over $300,000 annually, although we import nearly the same
amount from Italy.And yet an article can be found in the United States
fully as fine as the famous Carrara marble.We refer to that which comes
from Rutland, Vt.This state yields the largest variety and choicest
specimens.The marble belt runs both ways from Rutland County, where
the only quality fit for statuary is obtained.Toward the north it
deteriorates by growing less sound, though finer in grain; while to
the south it becomes coarser.A beautiful black marble is obtained at
Shoreham, Vt.There are also handsome brecciated marbles in the same
state; and in the extreme northern part, near Lake Champlain, they
become more variegated and rich in hue.Such other marble as is found
in New England is of an inferior quality.The pillars of Girard
College came from Berkshire, Mass., which ranks next after Vermont in
reputation.The marble belt extends from New England through New York, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia, Tennessee, and the
Carolinas, to Georgia and Alabama.Some of the variegated and high
colored varieties obtained near Knoxville, Tenn., nearly equal that of
Vermont.The Rocky Mountains contain a vast abundance and variety.Slate was known to exist in this country to a slight extent in colonial
days.It was then used for gravestones, and to some extent for roofing
and school purposes.It is
stated that a slate quarry was operated in Northampton County, Pa., as
early as 1805.In 1826 James M. Porter and Samuel Taylor engaged in the
business, obtaining their supplies from the Kittanninny Mountains.From
this time the business developed rapidly, the village of Slateford being
an outgrowth of it, and large rafts being employed to float the product
down the Schuylkill to Philadelphia.By 1860 the industry had reached
the capacity of 20,000 cases of slate, valued at $10 a case, annually.In 1839 quarries were opened in the Piscataquis River, forty miles
north of Bangor, Me., but poor transportation facilities retarded the
business.Vermont began to yield in 1852.New York's quarries are
confined to Washington County, near the Vermont line.Maryland has
a limited supply from Harford County.The Huron Mountains, north of
Marquette, Mich., contain slate, which is also said to exist in Pike
County, Ga.Grindstones, millstones, and whetstones are quarried in New York, Ohio,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and other States.Mica is found at Acworth and
Grafton, N. H., and near Salt Lake, but our chief supply comes from
Haywood, Yancey, Mitchell, and Macon counties, in North Carolina, and
our product is so large that we can afford to export it.Other stones,
such as silex, for making glass, etc., are found in profusion in various
parts of the country, but we have no space to enter into a detailed
account of them at present.--_Pottery and Glassware Reporter_.*       *       *       *       *




AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.The most interesting change of which the Census gives account is the
increase in the number of farms.The number has virtually doubled within
twenty years.The population of the country has not increased in like
proportion.A large part of the increase in number of farms has been due
to the division of great estates.Nor has this occurred, as some may
imagine, exclusively in the Southern States and the States to which
immigration and migration have recently been directed.It is an
important fact that the multiplication of farms has continued even in
the older Northern States, though the change has not been as great in
these as in States of the far West or the South.In New York there has
been an increase of 25,000, or 11.5 per cent, in the number of farms
since 1870; in New Jersey the increase has been 12.2 per cent., and in
Pennsylvania 22.7 per cent., though the increase in population, and
doubtless in the number of persons engaged in farming, has been much
smaller.Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois also, have been considered fully
settled States for years, at least in an agricultural point of view, and
yet the number of farms has increased 26.1 per cent, in ten years in
Ohio, 20.3 percent, in Indiana, and 26.1 per cent, in Illinois.The
obvious explanation is that the growth of many cities and towns has
created a market for a far greater supply of those products which may be
most advantageously grown upon farms of moderate size; but even if this
fully accounts for the phenomenon, the change must be recognized as one
of the highest importance industrially, socially, and politically.The
man who owns or rents and cultivates a farm stands on a very different
footing from the laborer who works for wages.It is not a small matter
that, in these six States alone, there are 205,000 more owners or
managers of farms than there were only a decade ago.As we go further toward the border, west or north, the influence of the
settlement of new land is more distinctly felt.Even in Michigan, where
new railroads have opened new regions to settlement, the increase in
number of farms has been over 55 per cent.In Wisconsin, though the
increase in railroad mileage has been about the same as in Michigan, the
reported increase in number of farms has been only 28 per cent., but in
Iowa it rises to 60 per cent., and in Minnesota to nearly 100 per cent.In Kansas the number of farms is 138,561, against 38,202 in 1870; in
Nebraska 63,387, against 12,301; and in Dakota 17,435, against 1,720.In
these regions the process is one of creation of new States rather than a
change in the social and industrial condition of the population.Some Southern States have gained largely, but the increase in these,
though very great, is less surprising than the new States of the
Northwest.The prevailing tendency of Southern agriculture to large
farms and the employment of many hands is especially felt in States
where land is still abundant.The greatest increase is in Texas, where
174,184 farms are reported, against 61,125 in 1870; in Florida, with
23,438 farms, against 10,241 in 1870; and in Arkansas, with 94,433
farms, against 49,424 in 1870.In Missouri 215,575 farms are reported,
against 148,228 in 1870.In these States, though social changes have
been great, the increase in number of farms has been largely due to new
settlements, as in the States of the far Northwest.But the change in
the older Southern States is of a different character.Virginia, for example, has long been settled, and had 77,000 farms
thirty years ago.But the increase in number within the past ten years
has been 44,668, or 60.5 per cent.Contrasting this with the increase in
New York, a remarkable difference appears.West Virginia had few more
farms ten years ago than New Jersey; now it has nearly twice as many,
and has gained in number nearly 60 per cent.North Carolina, too, has
increased 78 per cent.in number of farms since 1870, and South Carolina
80 per cent.In Georgia the increase has been still greater--from 69,956
to 138,626, or nearly 100 per cent.In Alabama there are 135,864
farms, against 67,382 in 1870, an increase of over 100 per cent.These
proportions, contrasted with those for the older Northern States, reveal
a change that is nothing less than an industrial revolution.But the
force of this tendency to division of estates has been greatest in the
States named.Whereas the ratio of increase in number of farms becomes
greater in Northern States as we go from the East toward the Mississippi
River, at the South it is much smaller in Kentucky, Tennessee,
Mississippi, and Louisiana than in the older States on the Atlantic
coast.Thus in Louisiana the increase has been from 28,481 to 48,292
farms, or 70 per cent., and in Mississippi from 68,023 to 101,772 farms,
or less than 50 per cent., against 100 in Alabama and Georgia.In
Kentucky the increase has been from 118,422 to 166,453 farms, or 40 per
cent., and in Tennessee from 118,141 to 165,650 farms, or 40 per cent.,
against 60 in Virginia and West Virginia, and 78 in North Carolina.Thus, while the tendency to division is far greater than in the Northern
States of corresponding age, it is found in full force only in six of
the older Southern States, Alabama, West Virginia, and four on the
Atlantic coast.In these, the revolution already effected foreshadows
and will almost certainly bring about important political changes within
a few years.In these six States there 310,795 more farm owners or
occupants than there were ten years ago.--_N.Y.*       *       *       *       *




A FARMER'S LIME KILN.For information about burning lime we republish the following article
furnished by a correspondent of the _Country Gentleman_ several years
ago:

[Illustration: Fig.1), Railway Track--B B B,
Iron Rods running through Kiln--C, Capstone over Arch--D, Arch--E, Well
without brick or ash lining.]I send you a description and sketch of a lime-kiln put up on my premises
about five years ago.The dimensions of this kiln are 13 feet square by
25 feet high from foundation, and its capacity 100 bushels in 24 hours.It was constructed of the limestone quarried on the spot.It has round
iron rods (shown in sketch) passing through, with iron plates fastened
to the ends as clamps to make it more firm; the pair nearest the top
should be not less than 2 feet from that point, the others interspersed
about 2 feet apart--the greatest strain being near the top.The arch
should be 7 feet high by 51/2 wide in front, with a gather on the top
and sides of about 1 foot, with plank floor; and if this has a little
incline it will facilitate shoveling the lime when drawn.The arch
should have a strong capstone; also one immediately under the well of
the kiln, with a hole 2 feet in diameter to draw the lime through; or
two may be used with semicircle cut in each.Iron bars 2 inches wide by
1/8 inch thick are used in this kiln for closing it, working in slots
fastened to capstone.These slots must be put in before the caps
are laid.When it is desired to draw lime, these bars may be
pushed laterally in the slots, or drawn out entirely, according to
circumstances; 3 bars will be enough.The slots are made of iron bars
11/2 inches wide, with ends rounded and turned up, and inserted in holes
drilled through capstone and keyed above.The well of the kiln is lined with fire-brick one course thick, with a
stratum of coal ashes three inches thick tamped in between the brick
and wall, which proves a great protection to the wall.About 2,000
fire-bricks were used.The proprietors of this kiln say about one-half
the lower part of the well might have been lined with a first quality of
common brick and saved some expense and been just as good.The form of
the well shown in Fig.3 is 7 feet in diameter in the bilge, exclusive
of the lining of brick and ashes.Experiments in this vicinity have
proved this to be the best, this contraction toward the top being
absolutely necessary, the expansion of the stone by the heat is so
great that the lime cannot be drawn from perpendicular walls, as was
demonstrated in one instance near here, where a kiln was built on that
principle.The kiln, of course, is for coal, and our stone requires
about three-quarters of a ton per 100 bushels of lime, but this, I am
told, varies according to quality, some requiring more than others; the
quantity can best be determined by experimenting; also the regulation of
the heat--if too great it will cause the stones to melt or run together
as it were, or, if too little, they will not be properly burned.The
business requires skill and judgment to run it successfully.This kiln is located at the foot of a steep bluff, the top about level
with the top of the kiln, with railway track built of wooden sleepers,
with light iron bars, running from the bluff to the top of the kiln, and
a hand-car makes it very convenient filling the kiln.Such a location
should be had if possible.Your inquirer may perhaps get some ideas
of the principles of a kiln for using _coal_.The dimensions may be
reduced, if desired.If for _wood_, the arch would have to be formed for
that, and the height of kiln reduced.*       *       *       *       *




THE MANUFACTURE OF APPLE JELLY.[Footnote: From the report of the New York Agricultural Society.]Within the county of Oswego, New York, Dewitt C. Peck reports there are
five apple jelly factories in operation.The failure of the apple crop,
for some singular and unexplained reason, does not extend in great
degree to the natural or ungrafted fruit.Though not so many as common,
even of these apples, there are yet enough to keep these five mills and
the numerous cider mills pretty well employed.The largest jelly factory
is located near the village of Mexico, and as there are some features in
regard to this manufacture peculiar to this establishment which may be
new and interesting, we will undertake a brief description.The factory
is located on the Salmon Creek, which affords the necessary power.A
portion of the main floor, first story, is occupied as a saw mill,
the slabs furnishing fuel for the boiler furnace connected with the
evaporating department.Just above the mill, along the bank of the pond,
and with one end projecting over the water, are arranged eight large
bins, holding from five hundred to one thousand bushels each, into which
the apples are delivered from the teams.The floor in each of these has
a sharp pitch or inclination toward the water and at the lower end is a
grate through which the fruit is discharged, when wanted, into a trough
half submerged in the pond.The preparation of the fruit and extraction of the juice proceeds
as follows: Upon hoisting a gate in the lower end of this trough,
considerable current is caused, and the water carries the fruit a
distance of from thirty to one hundred feet, and passes into the
basement of the mill, where, tumbling down a four-foot perpendicular
fall, into a tank, tight in its lower half and slatted so as to permit
the escape of water and impurities in the upper half, the apples are
thoroughly cleansed from all earthy or extraneous matter.Such is the
friction caused by the concussion of the fall, the rolling and rubbing
of the apples together, and the pouring of the water, that decayed
sections of the fruit are ground off and the rotten pulp passes away
with other impurities.From this tank the apples are hoisted upon an
endless chain elevator, with buckets in the form of a rake-head with
iron teeth, permitting drainage and escape of water, to an upper story
of the mill, whence by gravity they descend to the grater.The press
is wholly of iron, all its motions, even to the turning of the screws,
being actuated by the water power.The cheese is built up with layers
inclosed in strong cotton cloth, which displaces the straw used in olden
time, and serves also to strain the cider.As it is expressed from
the press tank, the cider passes to a storage tank, and thence to the
defecator.This defecator is a copper pan, eleven feet long and about three feet
wide.At each end of this pan is placed a copper tube three inches in
diameter and closed at both ends.Lying between and connecting
these two, are twelve tubes, also of copper, 11/2 inches in diameter,
penetrating the larger tubes at equal distances from their upper and
under surfaces, the smaller being parallel with each other, and 11/2
inches apart.When placed in position, the larger tubes, which act as
manifolds, supplying the smaller with steam, rest upon the bottom of the
pan, and thus the smaller pipes have a space of three-fourths of an inch
underneath their outer surfaces.The cider comes from the storage tank in a continuous stream about
three-eighths of an inch in diameter.Steam is introduced to the large
or manifold tubes, and from them distributed through the smaller ones at
a pressure of from twenty-five to thirty pounds per inch.Trap valves
are provided for the escape of water formed by condensation within the
pipes.The primary object of the defecator is to remove all impurities
and perfectly clarify the liquid passing through it.All portions of
pomace and other minute particles of foreign matter, when heated,
expand and float in the form of scum upon the surface of the cider.An
ingeniously contrived floating rake drags off this scum and delivers it
over the side of the pan.To facilitate this removal, one side of the
pan, commencing at a point just below the surface of the cider, is
curved gently outward and upward, terminating in a slightly inclined
plane, over the edge of which the scum is pushed by the rake into a
trough and carried away.A secondary purpose served by the defecator
is that of reducing the cider by evaporation to a partial sirup of the
specific gravity of about 20 deg.Daniel moved to the hallway.When of this consistency the liquid
is drawn from the bottom and less agitated portion of the defecator by a
siphon, and thence carried to the evaporator, which is located upon the
same framework and just below the defecator.The evaporator consists of a separate system of six copper tubes, each
twelve feet long and three inches in diameter.These are each jacketed
or inclosed in an iron pipe of four inches internal diameter, fitted
with steam-tight collars so as to leave half an inch steam space
surrounding the copper tubes.The latter are open at both ends
permitting the admission and egress of the sirup and the escape of the
steam caused by evaporation therefrom, and are arranged upon the frame
so as to have a very slight inclination downward in the direction of
the current, and each nearly underneath its predecessor in regular
succession.Each is connected by an iron supply pipe, having a steam
gauge or indicator attached, with a large manifold, and that by other
pipes with a steam boiler of thirty horse power capacity.Steam being
let on at from twenty five to thirty pounds pressure, the stream of
sirup is received from the defecator through a strainer, which removes
any impurities possibly remaining into the upper evaporator tube;
passing in a gentle flow through that, it is delivered into a funnel
connected with the next tube below, and so, back and forth, through the
whole system.The sirup enters the evaporator at a consistency of from
20 deg.Baume, and emerges from the last tube some three minutes
later at a consistency of from 30 deg.Baume, which is found on
cooling to be the proper point for perfect jelly.This point is found to
vary one or two degrees, according to the fermentation consequent upon
bruises in handling the fruit, decay of the same, or any little delay in
expressing the juice from the cheese.The least fermentation occasions
the necessity for a lower reduction.To guard against this, no cheese
is allowed to stand over night, no pomace left in the grater or vat, no
cider in the tank; and further to provide against fermentation, a large
water tank is located upon the roof and filled by a force pump, and by
means of hose connected with this, each grater, press, vat, tank, pipe,
trough, or other article of machinery used, can be thoroughly washed and
cleansed.Hot water, instead of cider, is sometimes sent through the
defecator, evaporator, etc., until all are thoroughly scalded and
purified.If the saccharometer shows too great or too little reduction,
the matter is easily regulated by varying the steam pressure in the
evaporator by means of a valve in the supply pipe.If boiled cider
instead of jelly is wanted for making pies, sauces, etc., it is drawn
off from one of the upper evaporator tubes according to the consistency
desired; or can be produced at the end of the process by simply reducing
the steam pressure.As the jelly emerges from the evaporator it is transferred to a tub
holding some fifty gallons, and by mixing a little therein, any little
variations in reduction or in the sweetness or sourness of the fruit
used are equalized.From this it is drawn through faucets, while hot,
into the various packages in which it is shipped to market.A favorite
form of package for family use is a nicely turned little wooden
bucket with cover and bail, two sizes, holding five and ten pounds
respectively.The smaller packages are shipped in cases for convenience
in handling.The present product of this manufactory is from 1,500 to
1,800 pounds of jelly each day of ten hours.It is calculated that
improvements now in progress will increase this to something more than a
ton per day.Each bushel of fruit will produce from four to five pounds
of jelly, fruit ripening late in the season being more productive than
earlier varieties.Crab apples produce the finest jelly; sour, crabbed,
natural fruit makes the best looking article, and a mixture of all
varieties gives most satisfactory results as to flavor and general
quality.As the pomace is shoveled from the finished cheese, it is again ground
under a toothed cylinder, and thence drops into large troughs, through a
succession of which a considerable stream of water is flowing.Here it
is occasionally agitated by raking from the lower to the upper end of
the trough as the current carries it downward, and the apple seeds
becoming disengaged drop to the bottom into still water, while the pulp
floats away upon the stream.A succession of troughs serves to remove
nearly all the seeds.The value of the apple seeds thus saved is
sufficient to pay the daily wages of all the hands employed in the whole
establishment.The apples are measured in the wagon box, one and a half
cubic feet being accounted a bushel.This mill ordinarily employs about six men: One general superintendent,
who buys and measures the apples, keeps time books, attends to all the
accounts and the working details of the mill, and acts as cashier; one
sawyer, who manufactures lumber for the local market and saws the slabs
into short lengths suitable for the furnace; one cider maker, who grinds
the apples and attends the presses; one jelly maker, who attends the
defecator, evaporator, and mixing tub, besides acting as his own fireman
and engineer; one who attends the apple seed troughs and acts as general
helper, and one man-of-all-work to pack, ship and assist whenever
needed.The establishment was erected late in the season of 1880,
and manufactured that year about forty-five tons of jelly, besides
considerable cider exchanged to the farmers for apples, and some boiled
cider.The price paid for apples in 1880, when the crop was superabundant, was
six to eight cents per bushel; in 1881, fifteen cents.The proprietor
hopes next year to consume 100,000 bushels.These institutions are
important to the farmer in that they use much fruit not otherwise
valuable and very perishable.Fruit so crabbed and gnarled as to have no
market value, and even frozen apples, if delivered while yet solid, can
be used.(Such apples are placed in the water while frozen, the water
draws the frost sufficiently to be grated, and passing through the press
and evaporator before there is time for chemical change, they are found
to make very good jelly.They are valuable to the consumer by converting
the perishable, cheap, almost worthless crop of the bearing and abundant
years into such enduring form that its consumption may be carried over
to years of scarcity and furnish healthful food in cheap and pleasant
form to many who would otherwise be deprived; and lastly, they are of
great interest to society, in that they give to cider twice the value
for purposes of food that it has or can have, even to the manufacturer,
for use as a beverage and intoxicant.*       *       *       *       *




IMPROVED GRAPE BAGS.It stands to reason that were our summers warmer we should be able to
grow grapes successfully on open walls; it is therefore probable that
a new grape bag, the invention of M. Pelletier, 20 Rue de la Banque,
Paris, intended to serve a double purpose, viz., protecting the fruit
and hastening its maturity, will, when it becomes known, be welcomed in
this country.It consists of a square of curved glass so fixed to
the bag that the sun's rays are concentrated upon the fruit, thereby
rendering its ripening more certain in addition to improving its quality
generally.The glass is affixed to the bag by means of a light iron wire
support.It covers that portion of it next the sun, so that it increases
the amount of light and warms the grapes without scorching them, a
result due to the convexity of the glass and the layer of air between it
and the bag.M. Pelletier had the idea of rendering these bags cheaper
by employing plain squares instead of curved ones, but the advantage
thus obtained was more than counterbalanced by their comparative
inefficacy.In practice it was found that the curved squares gave an
average of 7 deg.more than the straight ones, while there was a difference
of 10 deg.when the bags alone were used, thus plainly demonstrating the
practical value of the invention.Whether these glass-fronted bags would have much value in the case of
grapes grown under glass in the ordinary way is a question that can only
be determined by actual experiment; but where the vines are on walls,
either under glass screens or in the open air, so that the bunches feel
the full force of the sun's rays, there can be no doubt as to their
utility, and it is probable that by their aid many of the continental
varieties which we do not now attempt to grow in the open, and which are
scarcely worthy of a place under glass, might be well ripened.At
any rate we ought to give anything a fair trial which may serve to
neutralize, if only in a slight degree, the uncertainty of our summers.As it is, we have only about two varieties of grapes, and these not the
best of the hardy kinds, as regards flavor and appearance, that ripen
out of doors, and even these do not always succeed.We know next to
nothing of the many really well-flavored kinds which are so much
appreciated in many parts of the Continent.The fact is, our outdoor
culture of grapes offers a striking contrast to that practiced under
glass, and although our comparatively sunless and moist climate affords
some excuse for our shortcomings in this respect, there is no valid
reason for the utter want of good culture which is to be observed in a
general way.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--OPEN.]Given intelligent training, constant care in stopping the laterals, and
checking mildew as well as thinning the berries, allowing each bunch to
get the full benefit of sun and air, and I believe good eatable grapes
would often be obtained even in summers marked by a low average
temperature.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--CLOSED.]If, moreover, to a good system of culture we add some such mechanical
contrivance as that under notice whereby the bunches enjoy an average
warmth some 10 deg.higher than they otherwise would do, we not only insure
the grapes coming to perfection in favored districts, but outdoor
culture might probably be practiced in higher latitudes than is now
practicable.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FOR FRONT OF BAG.]The improved grape bag would also offer great facilities for destroying
mildew or guarantee the grapes against its attacks, as a light dusting
administered as soon as the berries were fairly formed would suffice for
the season, as owing to the glass protecting the berries from driving
rains, which often accompany south or south-west winds in summer and
autumn, the sulphur would not be washed off.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FIXED ON BAG.]The inventor claims, and we should say with just reason, that these
glass fronted bags would be found equally serviceable for the ripening
of pears and other choice fruits, and with a view to their being
employed for such a purpose, he has had them made of varying sizes and
shapes.In conclusion, it may be observed that, in addition to advancing
the maturity of the fruits to which they are applied, they also serve to
preserve them from falling to the ground when ripe.--J.COBNHILL, _in

UTILIZATION OF SOLAR HEAT.At a popular fete in the Tuileries Gardens I was struck with an
experiment which seems deserving of the immediate attention of the
English public and military authorities.Among the attractions of the fete was an apparatus for the concentration
and utilization of solar heat, and, though the sun was not very
brilliant, I saw this apparatus set in motion a printing machine which
printed several thousand copies of a specimen newspaper entitled the
_Soleil Journal_.The sun's rays are concentrated in a reflector, which moves at the
same rate as the sun and heats a vertical boiler, setting the motive
steam-engine at work.As may be supposed, the only object was to
demonstrate the possibility of utilizing the concentrated heat of the
solar rays; but I closely examined it, because the apparatus seems
capable of great utility in existing circumstances.Here in France,
indeed, there is a radical drawback--the sun is often overclouded.Thousands of years ago the idea of utilizing the solar rays must have
suggested itself, and there are still savage tribes who know no other
mode of combustion; but the scientific application has hitherto been
lacking.About fifteen years ago
Professor Mouchon, of Tours, began constructing such an apparatus, and
his experiments have been continued by M. Pifre, who has devoted much
labor and expense to realizing M. Mouchou's idea.A company has now come
to his aid, and has constructed a number of apparatus of different sizes
at a factory which might speedily turn out a large number of them.It is
evident that in a country of uninterrupted sunshine the boiler might be
heated in thirty or forty minutes.A portable apparatus could boil two
and one-half quarts an hour, or, say, four gallons a day, thus supplying
by distillation or ebullition six or eight men.The apparatus can be
easily carried on a man's back, and on condition of water, even of the
worst quality, being obtainable, good drinking and cooking water is
insured.M. De Rougaumond, a young scientific writer, has just published
an interesting volume on the invention.I was able yesterday to verify
his statements, for I saw cider made, a pump set in motion, and coffee
made--in short, the calorific action of the sun superseding that of
fuel.The apparatus, no doubt, has not yet reached perfection, but as it
is it would enable the soldier in India or Egypt to procure in the field
good water and to cook his food rapidly.The invention is of especial
importance to England just now, but even when the Egyptian question is
settled the Indian troops might find it of inestimable value.Red tape should for once be disregarded, and a competent commission
forthwith sent to 30 Rue d'Assas, with instructions to report
immediately, for every minute saved may avoid suffering for Englishmen
fighting abroad for their country.I may, of course, be mistaken, but
a commission would decide, and if the apparatus is good the slightest
delay in its adoption would be deplorable.--_Paris Correspondence London

HOW TO ESTABLISH A TRUE MERIDIAN.[Footnote: A paper read before the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia.]By PROFESSOR L. M. HAUPT.The discovery of the magnetic needle was a boon to mankind, and has been
of inestimable service in guiding the mariner through trackless waters,
and the explorer over desert wastes.In these, its legitimate uses, the
needle has not a rival, but all efforts to apply it to the accurate
determination of permanent boundary lines have proven very
unsatisfactory, and have given rise to much litigation, acerbity, and
even death.For these and other cogent reasons, strenuous efforts are being made to
dispense, so far as practicable, with the use of the magnetic needle
in surveying, and to substitute therefor the more accurate method of
traversing from a true meridian.This method, however, involves a
greater degree of preparation and higher qualifications than are
generally possessed, and unless the matter can be so simplified as to be
readily understood, it is unreasonable to expect its general application
in practice.Much has been written upon the various methods of determining, the
true meridian, but it is so intimately related to the determination of
latitude and time, and these latter in turn upon the fixing of a true
meridian, that the novice can find neither beginning nor end.When to
these difficulties are added the corrections for parallax, refraction,
instrumental errors, personal equation, and the determination of the
probable error, he is hopelessly confused, and when he learns that time
may be sidereal, mean solar, local, Greenwich, or Washington, and he is
referred to an ephemeris and table of logarithms for data, he becomes
lost in "confusion worse confounded," and gives up in despair, settling
down to the conviction that the simple method of compass surveying is
the best after all, even if not the most accurate.Daniel went to the bathroom.Having received numerous requests for information upon the subject, I
have thought it expedient to endeavor to prepare a description of the
method of determining the true meridian which should be sufficiently
clear and practical to be generally understood by those desiring to make
use of such information.This will involve an elementary treatment of the subject, beginning with
the


DEFINITIONS.The _celestial sphere_ is that imaginary surface upon which all
celestial objects are projected.The _earth's axis_ is the imaginary line about which it revolves.The _poles_ are the points in which the axis pierces the surface of the
earth, or of the celestial sphere.A _meridian_ is a great circle of the earth cut out by a plane passing
through the axis.All meridians are therefore north and south lines
passing through the poles.From these definitions it follows that if there were a star exactly at
the pole it would only be necessary to set up an instrument and take a
bearing to it for the meridian.Such not being the case, however, we are
obliged to take some one of the near circumpolar stars as our object,
and correct the observation according to its angular distance from the
meridian at the time of observation.For convenience, the bright star known as Ursae Minoris or Polaris, is
generally selected.This star apparently revolves about the north pole,
in an orbit whose mean radius is 1 deg.19' 13",[1] making the revolution in
23 hours 56 minutes.[Footnote 1: This is the codeclination as given in the Nautical Almanac.The mean value decreases by about 20 seconds each year.]During this time it must therefore cross the meridian twice, once above
the pole and once below; the former is called the _upper_, and the
latter the _lower meridian transit or culmination_.It must also pass
through the points farthest east and west from the meridian.The former
is called the _eastern elongation_, the latter the _western_.An observation may he made upon Polaris at any of these four points,
or at any other point of its orbit, but this latter case becomes too
complicated for ordinary practice, and is therefore not considered.If the observation were made upon the star at the time of its upper or
lower culmination, it would give the true meridian at once, but this
involves a knowledge of the true local time of transit, or the longitude
of the place of observation, which is generally an unknown quantity; and
moreover, as the star is then moving east or west, or at right angles to
the place of the meridian, at the rate of 15 deg.of arc in about one hour,
an error of so slight a quantity as only four seconds of time would
introduce an error of one minute of arc.If the observation be made,
however, upon either elongation, when the star is moving up or down,
that is, in the direction of the vertical wire of the instrument, the
error of observation in the angle between it and the pole will be
inappreciable.This is, therefore, the best position upon which to make
the observation, as the precise time of the elongation need not be
given.It can be determined with sufficient accuracy by a glance at the
relative positions of the star Alioth, in the handle of the Dipper,
and Polaris (see Fig.When the line joining these two stars is
horizontal or nearly so, and Alioth is to the _west_ of Polaris, the
latter is at its _eastern_ elongation, and _vice versa_, thus:

[Illustration]

But since the star at either elongation is off the meridian, it will
be necessary to determine the angle at the place of observation to be
turned off on the instrument to bring it into the meridian.This angle,
called the azimuth of the pole star, varies with the latitude of the
observer, as will appear from Fig 2, and hence its value must be
computed for different latitudes, and the surveyor must know his
_latitude_ before he can apply it.Let N be the north pole of the
celestial sphere; S, the position of Polaris at its eastern elongation;
then N S=1 deg.The azimuth of Polaris at the
latitude 40 deg.north is represented by the angle N O S, and that at 60 deg.north, by the angle N O' S, which is greater, being an exterior angle
of the triangle, O S O. From this we see that the azimuth varies at the
latitude.We have first, then, to _find the latitude of the place of observation_.Of the several methods for doing this, we shall select the simplest,
preceding it by a few definitions.A _normal_ line is the one joining the point directly overhead, called
the _zenith_, with the one under foot called the _nadir_.The _celestial horizon_ is the intersection of the celestial sphere by a
plane passing through the center of the earth and perpendicular to the
normal.A _vertical circle_ is one whose plane is perpendicular to the horizon,
hence all such circles must pass through the normal and have the zenith
and nadir points for their poles.The _altitude_ of a celestial object
is its distance above the horizon measured on the arc of a vertical
circle.As the distance from the horizon to the zenith is 90 deg., the
difference, or _complement_ of the altitude, is called the _zenith
distance_, or _co-altitude_.The _azimuth_ of an object is the angle between the vertical plane
through the object and the plane of the meridian, measured on the
horizon, and usually read from the south point, as 0 deg., through west, at
90, north 180 deg., etc., closing on south at 0 deg.These two co-ordinates, the altitude and azimuth, will determine the
position of any object with reference to the observer's place.The
latter's position is usually given by his latitude and longitude
referred to the equator and some standard meridian as co-ordinates.The _latitude_ being the angular distance north or south of the equator,
and the _longitude_ east or west of the assumed meridian.We are now prepared to prove that _the altitude of the pole is equal to
the latitude of the place of observation_.Let H P Z Q1, etc., Fig.2, represent a meridian section of the sphere,
in which P is the north pole and Z the place of observation, then H H1
will be the horizon, Q Q1 the equator, H P will be the altitude of P,
and Q1 Z the latitude of Z. These two arcs are equal, for H C Z = P C
Q1 = 90 deg., and if from these equal quadrants the common angle P C Z be
subtracted, the remainders H C P and Z C Q1, will be equal.To _determine the altitude of the pole_, or, in other words, _the
latitude of the place_.Observe the altitude of the pole star _when on the meridian_, either
above or below the pole, and from this observed altitude corrected for
refraction, subtract the distance of the star from the pole, or its
_polar distance_, if it was an upper transit, or add it if a lower.The result will be the required latitude with sufficient accuracy for
ordinary purposes.The time of the star's being on the meridian can be determined with
sufficient accuracy by a mere inspection of the heavens.The refraction
is _always negative_, and may be taken from the table appended by
looking up the amount set opposite the observed altitude.Thus, if the
observer's altitude should be 40 deg.39' the nearest refraction 01' 07",
should be subtracted from 40 deg.37' 53" for the
latitude.TO FIND THE AZIMUTH OF POLARIS.As we have shown the azimuth of Polaris to be a function of the
latitude, and as the latitude is now known, we may proceed to find the
required azimuth.For this purpose we have a right-angled spherical
triangle, Z S P, Fig.4, in which Z is the place of observation, P the
north pole, and S is Polaris.In this triangle we have given the polar
distance, P S = 10 deg.19' 13"; the angle at S = 90 deg.; and the distance Z
P, being the complement of the latitude as found above, or 90 deg.--L.Substituting these in the formula for the azimuth, we will have sin.of co-latitude, from
which, by assuming different values for the co-latitude, we compute the
following table:

An analysis of this table shows that the azimuth this year (1882)
increases with the latitude from 1 deg.It also shows that the azimuth of Polaris at
any one point of observation decreases slightly from year to year.This
is due to the increase in declination, or decrease in the star's polar
distance.north latitude, this annual decrease in the azimuth
is about 22", while at 50 deg.As the variation in
azimuth for each degree of latitude is small, the table is only computed
for the even numbered degrees; the intermediate values being readily
obtained by interpolation.We see also that an error of a few minutes of
latitude will not affect the result in finding the meridian, e.g., the
azimuth at 40 deg.44'
56", the difference (01' 35") being the correction for one degree of
latitude between 40 deg.Or, in other words, an error of one degree
in finding one's latitude would only introduce an error in the azimuth
of one and a half minutes.With ordinary care the probable error of the
latitude as determined from the method already described need not exceed
a few minutes, making the error in azimuth as laid off on the arc of an
ordinary transit graduated to single minutes, practically zero.REFRACTION TABLE FOR ANY ALTITUDE WITHIN THE LATITUDE OF THE UNITED

APPLICATIONS.In practice to find the true meridian, two observations must be made at
intervals of six hours, or they may be made upon different nights.The
first is for latitude, the second for azimuth at elongation.To make either, the surveyor should provide himself with a good transit
with vertical arc, a bull's eye, or hand lantern, plumb bobs, stakes,
etc.[1] Having "set up" over the point through which it is proposed to
establish the meridian, at a time when the line joining Polaris and
Alioth is nearly vertical, level the telescope by means of the attached
level, which should be in adjustment, set the vernier of the vertical
arc at zero, and take the reading.If the pole star is about making its
_upper_ transit, it will rise gradually until reaching the meridian as
it moves westward, and then as gradually descend.When near the highest
part of its orbit point the telescope at the star, having an assistant
to hold the "bull's eye" so as to reflect enough light down the tube
from the object end to illumine the cross wires but not to obscure the
star, or better, use a perforated silvered reflector, clamp the tube in
this position, and as the star continues to rise keep the _horizontal_
wire upon it by means of the tangent screw until it "rides" along this
wire and finally begins to fall below it.Take the reading of the
vertical arc and the result will be the observed altitude.[Footnote 1: A sextant and artificial horizon may be used to find the
_altitude_ of a star.In this case the observed angle must be divided by
2.]It is a little more accurate to find the altitude by taking the
complement of the observed zenith distance, if the vertical arc has
sufficient range.This is done by pointing first to Polaris when at
its highest (or lowest) point, reading the vertical arc, turning the
horizontal limb half way around, and the telescope over to get another
reading on the star, when the difference of the two readings will be the
_double_ zenith distance, and _half_ of this subtracted from 90 deg.The less the time intervening between these two
pointings, the more accurate the result will be.Having now found the altitude, correct it for refraction by subtracting
from it the amount opposite the observed altitude, as given in the
refraction table, and the result will be the latitude.The observer must
now wait about six hours until the star is at its western elongation,
or may postpone further operations for some subsequent night.In the
meantime he will take from the azimuth table the amount given for his
date and latitude, now determined, and if his observation is to be made
on the western elongation, he may turn it off on his instrument, so
that when moved to zero, _after_ the observation, the telescope will be
brought into the meridian or turned to the right, and a stake set by
means of a lantern or plummet lamp.[Illustration]

It is, of course, unnecessary to make this correction at the time of
observation, for the angle between any terrestrial object and the star
may be read and the correction for the azimuth of the star applied at
the surveyor's convenience.It is always well to check the accuracy of
the work by an observation upon the other elongation before putting in
permanent meridian marks, and care should be taken that they are not
placed near any local attractions.The meridian having been established,
the magnetic variation or declination may readily be found by setting
an instrument on the meridian and noting its bearing as given by the
needle.If, for example, it should be north 5 deg._east_, the variation is
west, because the north end of the needle is _west_ of the meridian, and
_vice versa_._Local time_ may also be readily found by observing the instant when the
sun's center[1] crosses the line, and correcting it for the equation of
time as given above--the result is the true or mean solar time.This,
compared with the clock, will show the error of the latter, and by
taking the difference between the local lime of this and any other
place, the difference of longitude is determined in hours, which can
readily be reduced to degrees by multiplying by fifteen, as 1 h.[Footnote 1: To obtain this time by observation, note the instant of
first contact of the sun's limb, and also of last contact of same, and
take the mean.]APPROXIMATE EQUATION OF TIME._______________________

THE OCELLATED PHEASANT.The collections of the Museum of Natural History of Paris have just been
enriched with a magnificent, perfectly adult specimen of a species of
bird that all the scientific establishments had put down among their
desiderata, and which, for twenty years past, has excited the curiosity
of naturalists.This species, in fact, was known only by a few caudal
feathers, of which even the origin was unknown, and which figured in the
galleries of the Jardin des Plantes under the name of _Argus ocellatus_.This name was given by J. Verreaux, who was then assistant naturalist at
the museum.L. Bonaparte, in his Tableaux
Paralleliques de l'Ordre des Gallinaces, as _Argus giganteus_, and a
few years later it was reproduced by Slater in his Catalogue of the
Phasianidae, and by Gray is his List of the Gallinaceae.But it was not
till 1871 and 1872 that Elliot, in the Annals and Magazine of Natural
History, and in a splendid monograph of the Phasianidae, pointed out
the peculiarities that were presented by the feathers preserved at the
Museum of Paris, and published a figure of them of the natural size.The discovery of an individual whose state of preservation leaves
nothing to be desired now comes to demonstrate the correctness of
Verreaux's, Bonaparte's, and Elliot's suppositions.This bird, whose
tail is furnished with feathers absolutely identical with those that
the museum possessed, is not a peacock, as some have asserted, nor an
ordinary Argus of Malacca, nor an argus of the race that Elliot named
_Argus grayi_, and which inhabits Borneo, but the type of a new genus of
the family Phasianidae.This Gallinacean, in fact, which Mr.Maingonnat
has given up to the Museum of Natural History, has not, like the common
Argus of Borneo, excessively elongated secondaries; and its tail is not
formed of normal rectrices, from the middle of which spring two very
long feathers, a little curved and arranged like a roof; but it consists
of twelve wide plane feathers, regularly tapering, and ornamented with
ocellated spots, arranged along the shaft.Its head is not bare, but is
adorned behind with a tuft of thread-like feathers; and, finally, its
system of coloration and the proportions of the different parts of its
body are not the same as in the common argus of Borneo.There is reason,
then, for placing the bird, under the name of _Rheinardius ocellatus_,
in the family Phasianidae, after the genus _Argus_ which it connects,
after a manner, with the pheasants properly so-called.The specific name
_ocellatus_ has belonged to it since 1871, and must be substituted for
that of _Rheinardi_.The bird measures more than two meters in length, three-fourths of which
belong to the tail.The head, which is relatively small, appears to be
larger than it really is, owing to the development of the piliform tuft
on the occiput, this being capable of erection so as to form a crest
0.05 to 0.06 of a meter in height.The feathers of this crest are
brown and white.The back and sides of the head are covered with downy
feathers of a silky brown and silvery gray, and the front of the neck
with piliform feathers of a ruddy brown.The upper part of the body is
of a blackish tint and the under part of a reddish brown, the whole
dotted with small white or _cafe-au-lait_ spots.Analogous spots are
found on the wings and tail, but on the secondaries these become
elongated, and tear-like in form.On the remiges the markings are quite
regularly hexagonal in shape; and on the upper coverts of the tail
and on the rectrices they are accompanied with numerous ferruginous
blotches, some of which are irregularly scattered over the whole surface
of the vane, while others, marked in the center with a blackish spot,
are disposed in series along the shaft and resemble ocelli.This
similitude of marking between the rectrices and subcaudals renders the
distinction between these two kinds of feathers less sharp than in many
other Gallinaceans, and the more so in that two median rectrices are
considerably elongated and assume exactly the aspect of tail feathers.[Illustration: THE OCELLATED PHEASANT (_Rheinardius ocellatus_).]They are all absolutely plane,
all spread out horizontally, and they go on increasing in length
from the exterior to the middle.They are quite wide at the point of
insertion, increase in diameter at the middle, and afterward taper to
a sharp point.Altogether they form a tail of extraordinary length and
width which the bird holds slightly elevated, so as to cause it to
describe a graceful curve, and the point of which touches the soil.The
beak, whose upper mandible is less arched than that of the pheasants,
exactly resembles that of the arguses.It is slightly inflated at the
base, above the nostrils, and these latter are of an elongated-oval
form.In the bird that I have before me the beak, as well as the feet
and legs, is of a dark rose-color.The legs are quite long and are
destitute of spurs.They terminate in front in three quite delicate
toes, connected at the base by membranes, and behind in a thumb that is
inserted so high that it scarcely touches the ground in walking.This
magnificent bird was captured in a portion of Tonkin as yet unexplored
by Europeans, in a locality named Buih-Dinh, 400 kilometers to the south
of Hue.--_La Nature_.*       *       *       *       *




THE MAIDENHAIR TREE.The Maidenhair tree--Gingkgo biloba--of which we give an illustration,
is not only one of our most ornamental deciduous trees, but one of the
most interesting.Few persons would at first sight take it to be a
Conifer, more especially as it is destitute of resin; nevertheless,
to that group it belongs, being closely allied to the Yew, but
distinguishable by its long-stalked, fan-shaped leaves, with numerous
radiating veins, as in an Adiantum.These leaves, like those of the
larch but unlike most Conifers, are deciduous, turning of a pale yellow
color before they fall.The tree is found in Japan and in China, but
generally in the neighborhood of temples or other buildings, and is, we
believe, unknown in a truly wild state.As in the case of several other
trees planted in like situations, such as Cupressus funebris, Abies
fortunei, A. kaempferi, Cryptomeria japonica, Sciadopitys verticillata,
it is probable that the trees have been introduced from Thibet, or
other unexplored districts, into China and Japan.Though now a solitary
representative of its genus, the Gingkgo was well represented in the
coal period, and also existed through the secondary and tertiary epochs,
Professor Heer having identified kindred specimens belonging to sixty
species and eight genera in fossil remains generally distributed through
the northern hemisphere.Whatever inference we may draw, it is at least
certain that the tree was well represented in former times, if now it
be the last of its race.It was first known to Kaempfer in 1690, and
described by him in 1712, and was introduced into this country in the
middle of the eighteenth century.Loudon relates a curious tale as
to the manner in which a French amateur became possessed of it.The
Frenchman, it appears, came to England, and paid a visit to an English
nurseryman, who was the possessor of five plants, raised from Japanese
seeds.The hospitable Englishman entertained the Frenchman only too
well.He allowed his commercial instincts to be blunted by wine, and
sold to his guest the five plants for the sum of 25 guineas.Next
morning, when time for reflection came, the Englishman attempted to
regain one only of the plants for the same sum that the Frenchman had
given for all five, but without avail.The plants were conveyed to
France, where as each plant had cost about 40 crowns, _ecus_, the tree
got the name of _arbre a quarante ecus_.This is the story as given by
Loudon, who tells us that Andre Thouin used to relate the fact in his
lectures at the Jardin des Plantes, whether as an illustration of the
perfidy of Albion is not stated.The tree is dioecious, bearing male catkins on one plant, female on
another.All the female trees in Europe are believed to have originated
from a tree near Geneva, of which Auguste Pyramus de Candolle secured
grafts, and distributed them throughout the Continent.Nevertheless, the
female tree is rarely met with, as compared with the male; but it is
quite possible that a tree which generally produces male flowers only
may sometimes bear female flowers only.We have no certain evidence of
this in the case of the Gingkgo, but it is a common enough occurrence in
other dioecious plants, and the occurrence of a fruiting specimen near
Philadelphia, as recently recorded by Mr.Meehan, may possibly be
attributed to this cause.The tree of which we give a figure is growing at Broadlands, Hants, and
is about 40 feet in height, with a trunk that measures 7 feet in girth
at 3 feet from the ground, with a spread of branches measuring 45 feet.These dimensions have been considerably exceeded in other cases.In 1837
a tree at Purser's Cross measured 60 feet and more in height.Loudon
himself had a small tree in his garden at Bayswater on which a female
branch was grafted.It is to be feared that this specimen has long since
perished.We have already alluded to its deciduous character, in which it is
allied to the larch.It presents another point of resemblance both to
the larch and the cedar in the short spurs upon which both leaves and
male catkins are borne, but these contracted branches are mingled with
long extension shoots; there seems, however, no regular alternation
between the short and the long shoots, at any rate the _rationale_ of
their production is not understood, though in all probability a little
observation of the growing plant would soon clear the matter up.The fruit is drupaceous, with a soft outer coat and a hard woody shell,
greatly resembling that of a Cycad, both externally and internally.Whether the albumen contains the peculiar "corpuscles" common to Cycads
and Conifers, we do not for certain know, though from the presence of 2
to 3 embryos in one seed, as noted by Endlicher, we presume this is the
case.The interest of these corpuscles, it may be added, lies in the
proof of affinity they offer between Conifers and the higher Cryptogams,
such as ferns and lycopods--an affinity shown also in the peculiar
venation of the Gingkgo.Conifers are in some degree links between
ordinary flowering plants and the higher Cryptogams, and serve to
connect in genealogical sequence groups once considered quite distinct.In germination the two fleshy cotyledons of the Gingkgo remain within
the shell, leaving the three-sided plumule to pass upward; the young
stem bears its leaves in threes.We have no desire to enter further upon the botanical peculiarities of
this tree; enough if we have indicated in what its peculiar interest
consists.We have only to add that in gardens varieties exist some with
leaves more deeply cut than usual, others with leaves nearly entire, and
others with leaves of a golden-yellow color.--_Gardeners' Chronicle_.[Illustration: THE MAIDENHAIR TREE IN THE GARDENS AT BROADLANDS.]*       *       *       *       *




THE WOODS OF AMERICA.A collection of woods without a parallel in the world is now being
prepared for exhibition by the Directors of the American Museum of
Natural History.Scattered about the third floor of the Arsenal, in
Central Park, lie 394 logs, some carefully wrapped in bagging,
some inclosed in rough wooden cases, and others partially sawn
longitudinally, horizontally, and diagonally.These logs represent all
but 26 of the varieties of trees indigenous to this country, and
nearly all have a greater or less economic or commercial value.The 26
varieties needed to complete the collection will arrive before winter
sets in, a number of specimens being now on their way to this city from
the groves of California.S. D. Dill and a number of assistants are
engaged in preparing the specimens for exhibition.The logs as they
reach the workroom are wrapped in bagging and inclosed in cases, this
method being used so that the bark, with its growth of lichens and
delicate exfoliations, shall not be injured while the logs are in
process of transportation from various parts of the country to this
city.The logs are each 6 feet in length, and each is the most perfect
specimen of its class that could be found by the experts employed in
making the collection.With the specimens of the trees come to the
museum also specimens of the foliage and the fruits and flowers of the
tree.These come from all parts of the Union--from Alaska on the north
to Texas on the south, from Maine on the east to California on the
west--and there is not a State or Territory in the Union which has not a
representative in this collection of logs.On arrival here the logs are
green, and the first thing in the way of treatment after their arrival
is to season them, a work requiring great care to prevent them from
"checking," as it is technically called, or "season cracking," as the
unscientific term the splitting of the wood in radiating lines during
the seasoning process.As is well known, the sap-wood of a tree seasons
much more quickly than does the heart of the wood.The prevention of
this splitting is very necessary in preparing these specimens for
exhibition, for when once the wood has split its value for dressing for
exhibition is gone.A new plan to prevent this destruction of specimens
is now being tried with some success under the direction of Prof.Into the base of the log and
alongside the heart a deep hole is bored with an auger.As the wood
seasons this hole permits of a pressure inward and so has in many
instances doubtless saved valuable specimens.One of the finest in the
collection, a specimen of the persimmon tree, some two feet in diameter,
has been ruined by the seasoning process.On one side there is a huge
crack, extending from the top to the bottom of the log, which looks as
though some amateur woodman had attempted to split it with an ax and
had made a poor job of it.The great shrinking of the sap-wood of the
persimmon tree makes the wood of but trifling value commercially.It also has a discouraging effect upon collectors, as it is next to
impossible to cure a specimen, so that all but this one characteristic
of the wood can be shown to the public in a perfect form.Before the logs become thoroughly seasoned, or their lines of growth at
all obliterated, a diagram of each is made, showing in accordance with
a regular scale the thickness of the bark, the sap-wood, and the heart.There is also in this diagram a scale showing the growth of the tree
during each year of its life, these yearly growths being regularly
marked about the heart of the tree by move or less regular concentric
circles, the width of which grows smaller and smaller as the tree grows
older.In this connection attention may be called to a specimen in the
collection which is considered one of the most remarkable in the world.It is not a native wood, but an importation, and the tree from which
this wonderful slab is cut is commonly known as the "Pride of India."The heart of this particular tree was on the port side, and between it
and the bark there is very little sap-wood, not more than an inch.On the starbord side, so to speak, the sap-wood has grown out in an
abnormal manner, and one of the lines indicative of a year's growth is
one and seven-eighths inches in width, the widest growth, many experts
who have seen the specimen say, that was ever recorded.The diagrams
referred to are to be kept for scientific uses, and the scheme of
exhibition includes these diagrams as a part of the whole.After a log has become seasoned it is carefully sawed through the center
down about one-third of its length.A transverse cut is then made and
the semi-cylindrical section thus severed from the log is removed.The
upper end is then beveled.When a log is thus treated the inspector can
see the lower two-thirds presenting exactly the same appearance it did
when growing in the forest.The horizontal cut, through the sap-wood
and to the center of the heart, shows the life lines of the tree, and
carefully planed as are this portion, the perpendicular and the beveled
sections, the grain of the wood can thus be plainly seen.That these may
be made even more valuable to the architect and artisan, the right half
of this planed surface will be carefully polished, and the left half
left in the natural state.This portion of the scheme of treatment is
entirely in the interests of architects and artisans, and it is expected
by Prof.Bickmore that it will be the means of securing for some kinds
of trees, essentially of American growth, and which have been virtually
neglected, an important place in architecture and in ornamental
wood-work, and so give a commercial value to woods that are now of
comparatively little value.Among the many curious specimens in the collection now being prepared
for exhibition, one which will excite the greatest curiosity is a
specimen of the honey locust, which was brought here from Missouri.The bark is covered with a growth of thorns from one to four inches
in length, sharp as needles, and growing at irregular intervals.The
specimen arrived here in perfect condition, but, in order that it might
be transported without injury, it had to be suspended from the roof of
a box car, and thus make its trip from Southern Missouri to this city
without change.Another strange specimen in the novel collection is a
portion of the Yucca tree, an abnormal growth of the lily family.The
trunk, about 2 feet in diameter, is a spongy mass, not susceptible of
treatment to which the other specimens are subjected.Its bark is an
irregular stringy, knotted mass, with porcupine-quill-like leaves
springing out in place of the limbs that grow from all well-regulated
trees.One specimen of the yucca was sent to the museum two years ago,
and though the roots and top of the tree were sawn off, shoots sprang
out, and a number of the handsome flowers appeared.The tree was
supposed to be dead and thoroughly seasoned by this Fall, but now, when
the workmen are ready to prepare it for exhibition, it has shown new
life, new shoots have appeared, and two tufts of green now decorate the
otherwise dry and withered log, and the yucca promises to bloom again
before the winter is over.One of the most perfect specimens of the
Douglass spruce ever seen is in the collection, and is a decided
curiosity.It is a recent arrival from the Rocky Mountains.Its bark,
two inches or more in thickness, is perforated with holes reaching to
the-sap-wood.Many of these contain acorns, or the remains of acorns,
which have been stored there by provident woodpeckers, who dug the holes
in the bark and there stored their winter supply of food.The oldest
specimen in the collection is a section of the _Picea engelmanni_, a
species of spruce growing in the Rocky Mountains at a considerable
elevation above the sea.The specimen is 24 inches in diameter, and the
concentric circles show its age to be 410 years.The wood much resembles
the black spruce, and is the most valuable of the Rocky Mountain
growths.A specimen of the nut pine, whose nuts are used for food by the
Indians, is only 15 inches in diameter, and yet its life lines show its
age to be 369 years.The largest specimen yet received is a section of
the white ash, which is 46 inches in diameter and 182 years old.The
next largest specimen is a section of the _Platanus occidentalis_,
variously known in commerce as the sycamore, button-wood, or plane tree,
which is 42 inches in diameter and only 171 years of age.Specimens of
the redwood tree of California are now on their way to this city from
the Yosemite Valley.One specimen, though a small one, measures 5 feet
in diameter and shows the character of the wood.A specimen of
the enormous growths of this tree was not secured because of the
impossibility of transportation and the fact that there would be no room
in the museum for the storage of such a specimen, for the diameter of
the largest tree of the class is 45 feet and 8 inches, which represents
a circumference of about 110 feet.Then, too, the Californians object to
have the giant trees cut down for commercial, scientific, or any other
purposes.To accompany these specimens of the woods of America, Mr.Morris K.
Jesup, who has paid all the expense incurred in the collection of
specimens, is having prepared as an accompanying portion of the
exhibition water color drawings representing the actual size, color,
and appearance of the fruit, foliage, and flowers of the various trees.Their commercial products, as far as they can be obtained, will also be
exhibited, as, for instance, in the case of the long-leaved pine, the
tar, resin, and pitch, for which it is especially valued.Then, too, in
an herbarium the fruits, leaves, and flowers are preserved as nearly as
possible in their natural state.When the collection is ready for public
view next spring it will be not only the largest, but the only complete
one of its kind in the country.There is nothing like it in the world,
as far as is known; certainly not in the royal museums of England,
France, or Germany.Aside from the value of the collection, in a scientific way, it is
proposed to make it an adjunct to our educational system, which requires
that teachers shall instruct pupils as to the materials used for food
and clothing.The completeness of the exhibition will be of great
assistance also to landscape gardeners, as it will enable them to lay
out private and public parks so that the most striking effects of
foliage may be secured.The beauty of these effects can best be seen in
this country in our own Central Park, where there are more different
varieties and more combinations for foliage effects than in any other
area in the United States.To ascertain how these effects are obtained
one now has to go to much trouble to learn the names of the trees.With
this exhibition such information can be had merely by observation, for
the botanical and common names of each specimen will be attached to
it.It will also be of practical use in teaching the forester how to
cultivate trees as he would other crops.The rapid disappearance of
many valuable forest trees, with the increase in demand and decrease in
supply, will tend to make the collection valuable as a curiosity in
the not far distant future as representing the extinct trees of the
country.--_N.Y.*       *       *       *       *

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Scientific American Supplement No.But I see how it is with
you; your mind is on the world, and you think more of that, than you do
of the convent.But I shall punish you until you do your duty better."He concluded this choice speech by telling me to "march down stairs."Of
course, I obeyed, and he followed me, striking me on the head at every
step, with a book he held in his hand.I thought to escape some of the
blows, and hastened along, but all in vain; he kept near me and drove
me before him into the priests sitting-room.He then sent for three more
priests, to decide upon my punishment.A long consultation they held
upon "this serious business," as I sneeringly thought it, but the result
was serious in good earnest, I assure you.For the heinous offence of
making a slight noise I was to have dry peas bound upon my knees, and
then be made to crawl to St.Patrick's church, through an underground
passage, and back again.This church was situated on a hill, a little
more than a quarter of a mile from the convent.Between the two
buildings, an under-ground passage had been constructed, just large
enough to allow a person to crawl through it on the hands and knees.It
was so low, and narrow, that it was impossible either to rise, or turn
around; once within that passage there was no escape, but to go on to
the end.They allowed me five hours to go and return; and to prove that
I had really been there, I was to make a cross, and two straight lines,
with a bit of chalk, upon a black-board that I should find at the end.O, the intolerable agonies I endured on that terrible pathway!Any
description that I can give, will fail to convey the least idea of the
misery of those long five hours.It may, perchance, seem a very simple
mode of punishment, but let any one just try it, and they will be
convinced that it was no trifling thing.At the end, I found myself in
a cellar under the church, where there was light enough to enable me to
find the board and the chalk.I made the mark according to orders, and
then looked around for some means of escape.Strong iron bars firmly secured the only door, and a very slight
examination convinced me that my case was utterly hopeless.I then tried
to remove the peas from my swollen, bleeding limbs, but this, too, I
found impossible.They were evidently fastened by a practised hand; and
I was, at length, compelled to believe that I must return as I came.I
did return; but O, how, many times I gave up in despair, and thought
I could go no further!How many times did I stretch myself on the cold
stones, in such bitter agony, that I could have welcomed death as a
friend and deliverer!What would I not have given for one glass of cold
water, or even for a breath of fresh air!My limbs seemed on fire,
and while great drops of perspiration fell from my face, my throat and
tongue were literally parched with thirst.But the end came at last, and
I found the priest waiting for me at the entrance.He seemed very angry,
and said, "You have been gone over your time.There was no need of it;
you could have returned sooner if you had chosen to do so, and now,
I shall punish you again, for being gone so long."At first, his
reproaches grieved me, for I had done my best to please him, and I did
so long for one word of sympathy, it seemed for a moment, as though my
heart would break.Had he then spoken one kind word to me, or manifested
the least compassion for my sufferings, I could have forgiven the past,
and obeyed him with feelings of love and gratitude for the future.Yes,
I would have done anything for that man, if I could have felt that he
had the least pity for me; but when he said he should punish me again,
my heart turned to stone.Every tender emotion vanished, and a fierce
hatred, a burning indignation, and thirst for revenge, took possession
of my soul.The priest removed the peas from my limbs, and led me to a tomb under
the chapel, where he left me, with the consoling assurance that "THE
DEAD WOULD RISE AND EAT ME!"This tomb was a large rectangular room,
