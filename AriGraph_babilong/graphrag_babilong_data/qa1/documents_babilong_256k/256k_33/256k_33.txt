The water bailiff's clerk said--said--Ach, dear God----[Off.]after that storm--all things
are possible.No, I wouldn't give a cent for it.If they had run into an English harbor, we would have
had tidings.[Laying her sketch book on Kaps's desk.]That's the way he was three months ago,
hale and jolly.No, Miss, I haven't the time.Daantje's death was a blow to him--you always saw them together,
always discussing.Now he hasn't a friend in the "Home"; that makes
a big difference.Well, that's Kneir, that's Barend with the basket on his back,
and that's--[The telephone bell rings.How long
will he be, Kaps?A hatch marked
47--and--[Trembling.][Screams and lets the
receiver fall.]I don't dare listen--Oh, oh!Barend?----Barend?----

CLEMENTINE.A telegram from Nieuwediep.A hatch--and a corpse----

[Enter Bos.]The water bailiff is on the 'phone.The water bailiff?--Step aside--Go along, you!I--I--[Goes timidly off.]A
telegram from Nieuwediep?47?--Well,
that's damned--miserable--that!the corpse--advanced stage of
decomposition!Barend--mustered in as oldest boy!by--oh!--The Expectation has come into Nieuwediep disabled?And
did Skipper Maatsuiker recognize him?So it isn't necessary to send any
one from here for the identification?Yes, damned sad--yes--yes--we
are in God's hand--Yes--yes--I no longer had any doubts--thank
you--yes--I'd like to get the official report as soon as possible.I
will inform the underwriters, bejour!I
never expected to hear of the ship again.Yes--yes--yes--yes--[To Clementine.]What stupidity to repeat what you heard in that woman's
presence.It won't be five minutes now till half the village is
here!You sit there, God save me, and take
on as if your lover was aboard----

CLEMENTINE.When Simon, the shipbuilder's assistant----

BOS.And if he hadn't been, what right have you to stick
your nose into matters you don't understand?Dear God, now I am also guilty----

BOS.Have the novels you read gone to
your head?Are you possessed, to use those words after such
an accident?He said that the ship was a floating coffin.Then I heard
you say that in any case it would be the last voyage for the Hope.That damned boarding school; those damned
boarding school fads!Walk if you like through the village like a fool,
sketching the first rascal or beggar you meet!But don't blab out
things you can be held to account for.Say, rather,
a drunken authority--The North, of Pieterse, and the Surprise and the
Willem III and the Young John.Half of the
fishing fleet and half the merchant fleet are floating coffins.No, Meneer, I don't hear anything.If you had asked me: "Father, how is this?"But you conceited young people meddle with everything and
more, too!What stronger proof is there than the yearly inspection of
the ships by the underwriters?Do you suppose that when I presently
ring up the underwriter and say to him, "Meneer, you can plank down
fourteen hundred guilders"--that he does that on loose grounds?You
ought to have a face as red as a buoy in shame for the way you flapped
out your nonsense!Nonsense; that might take away
my good name, if I wasn't so well known.If I were a ship owner--and I heard----

BOS.God preserve the fishery from an owner who makes drawings and
cries over pretty vases!I stand as a father at the head of a hundred
homes.When you get sensitive you go head over
heels.[Kaps makes a motion that he cannot hear.]The Burgomaster's wife is making a call.Willem Hengst, aged
thirty-seven, married, four children----

BOS.Wait a moment till my daughter----

CLEMENTINE.Jacob Zwart, aged thirty-five years, married,
three children.Gerrit Plas, aged twenty-five years, married, one
child.Geert Vermeer, unmarried, aged twenty-six years.Nellis Boom,
aged thirty-five years, married, seven children.Klaas Steen, aged
twenty-four years, married.Solomon Bergen, aged twenty-five years,
married, one child.Mari Stad, aged forty-five years, married.Barend Vermeer,
aged nineteen years.Pietje Stappers, aged twelve years.Ach, God; don't make me unhappy, Meneer!----

BOS.Stappers----

MARIETJE.You lie!--It isn't
possible!----

BOS.The Burgomaster at Nieuwediep has telegraphed the water
bailiff.Barend Vermeer was washed ashore.You know what that means,
and a hatch of the 47----

TRUUS.Oh, Mother Mary, must I lose that child, too?Oh,
oh, oh, oh!--Pietje--Pietje----

MARIETJE.Then--Then--[Bursts into a hysterical
laugh.]Hahaha!--Hahaha!----

BOS.[Striking the glass from Clementine's hand.][Falling on her knees, her hands catching hold of the railing
gate.]Let me die!--Let me die, please, dear God, dear God!Come Marietje, be calm; get up.And so brave; as he stood there, waving,
when the ship--[Sobs loudly.]There hasn't
been a storm like that in years.Think of Hengst with four children,
and Jacob and Gerrit--And, although it's no consolation, I will hand
you your boy's wages today, if you like.Both of you go home now and
resign yourselves to the inevitable--take her with you--she seems----

MARIETJE.I want to
die, die----

CLEMENTINE.Cry, Marietje, cry, poor lamb----

[They go off.]Are
you too lazy to put pen to paper today?Have you
the Widows' and Orphans' fund at hand?[Bos
throws him the keys.][Opens the safe, shuffles back
to Bos's desk with the book.]Ninety-five widows, fourteen old sailors and fishermen.Yes, the fund fell short some time ago.We will have to put in
another appeal.The Burgomaster's
wife asks if you will come in for a moment.Kaps, here is the copy for the circular.Talk to her about making a public appeal for the unfortunates.Yes, but, Clemens, isn't that overdoing it, two begging
parties?I will do it myself, then--[Both exit.][Goes to his desk
and sits down opposite to him.]I feel so miserable----

KAPS.The statement of
Veritas for October--October alone; lost, 105 sailing vessels and
30 steamships--that's a low estimate; fifteen hundred dead in one
month.Yes, when you see it as it appears
today, so smooth, with the floating gulls, you wouldn't believe that
it murders so many people.[To Jo and Cobus, who sit alone in a dazed way.]We have just run from home--for Saart just as I
said--just as I said----

[Enter Bos.]You stay
where you are, Cobus.You have no doubt heard?----

JO.It happens so often that
they get off in row boats.Not only was there a hatch,
but the corpse was in an extreme state of dissolution.Skipper Maatsuiker of the Expectation identified him, and the
earrings.And if--he should be mistaken----I've
come to ask you for money, Meneer, so I can go to the Helder myself.The Burgomaster of Nieuwediep will take care of that----

[Enter Simon.]I--I--heard----[Makes a strong gesture towards Bos.]I--I--have no evil
intentions----

BOS.Must that drunken
fellow----

SIMON.[Steadying himself by holding to the gate.]No--stay where
you are--I'm going--I--I--only wanted to say how nicely it came
out--with--with--The Good Hope.Don't come so close to me--never come so close to a man with
a knife----No-o-o-o--I have no bad intentions.I only wanted to say,
that I warned you--when--she lay in the docks.Now just for the joke of it--you ask--ask--ask your bookkeeper
and your daughter--who were there----

BOS.You're not worth an answer, you sot!My employer--doesn't do the caulking himself.[To Kaps, who
has advanced to the gate.]Didn't I warn him?--wasn't you there?No, I wasn't there, and even if I
was, I didn't hear anything.Did that drunken sot----

CLEMENTINE.As my daughter do you permit----[Grimly.]I don't remember----

SIMON.That's low--that's low--damned low!I said, the ship was
rotten--rotten----

BOS.You're trying to drag in my bookkeeper
and daughter, and you hear----

COB.Yes, but--yes, but--now I remember also----

BOS.But your daughter--your daughter
says now that she hadn't heard the ship was rotten.And on the second
night of the storm, when she was alone with me at my sister Kneirtje's,
she did say that--that----

CLEMENTINE.Did I--say----

COB.These are my own words
to you: "Now you are fibbing, Miss; for if your father knew the Good
Hope was rotten"----

JO.[Springing up wildly, speaking with piercing distinctness.]I
was there, and Truus was there, and----Oh, you adders!Who
gives you your feed, year in, year out?Haven't you decency enough to
believe us instead of that drunken beggar who reels as he stands there?You had Barend dragged on board by the police; Geert was too
proud to be taken!No,
no, you needn't point to your door!If I staid here
any longer I would spit in your face--spit in your face!For your Aunt's sake I will consider that you
are overwrought; otherwise--otherwise----The Good Hope was seaworthy,
was seaworthy!And even
had the fellow warned me--which is a lie, could I, a business man,
take the word of a drunkard who can no longer get a job because he
is unable to handle tools?I--I told you and him and her--that a floating
coffin like that.Geert and Barend and Mees and the
others![Sinks on the chair
sobbing.]Give me the money to go to Nieuwediep myself, then I won't
speak of it any more.A girl that talks to me as
rudely as you did----

JO.I don't know what I said--and--and--I don't
believe that you--that you--that you would be worse than the devil.The water-bailiff says that it isn't necessary to send any one
to Nieuwediep.What will
become of me now?----

[Cobus and Simon follow her out.]And you--don't you ever dare to set foot again
in my office.Father, I ask myself [Bursts into sobs.]She would be capable of ruining my good name--with
her boarding-school whims.Who ever comes now you send away,
understand?[Sound of Jelle's fiddle
outside.][Falls into his chair, takes
up Clementine's sketch book; spitefully turns the leaves; throws
it on the floor; stoops, jerks out a couple of leaves, tears them
up.Sits in thought a moment, then rings the telephone.]with
Dirksen--Dirksen, I say, the underwriter![Waits, looking
sombre.]It's all up with the
Good Hope.A hatch with my mark washed ashore and the body of a
sailor.I shall wait for you here at my office.[Rings off;
at the last words Kneirtje has entered.]I----[She sinks on the bench, patiently weeping.]Have you mislaid the
policies?You never put a damn thing in its place.The policies are higher, behind
the stocks.[Turning around
with the policies in his hand.]That hussy that
lives with you has been in here kicking up such a scandal that I came
near telephoning for the police.Is it true--is it true
that----The priest said----[Bos nods with a sombre expression.]Oh,
oh----[She stares helplessly, her arms hang limp.]I know you as a respectable woman--and
your husband too.I'm sorry to have to say it to you
now after such a blow, your children and that niece of yours have never
been any good.[Kneirtje's head sinks down.]How many years haven't
we had you around, until your son Geert threatened me with his fists,
mocked my grey hairs, and all but threw me out of your house--and your
other son----[Frightened.]Shall I call Mevrouw or your daughter?with long drawn out sobs,
sits looking before her with a dazed stare.][In an agonized voice, broken with sobs.]And with my own hands I loosened his
fingers from the door post.You have no cause to reproach yourself----

KNEIRTJE.Before he went I hung his
father's rings in his ears.Like--like a lamb to the slaughter----

BOS.Come----

KNEIRTJE.And my oldest boy that I didn't bid good
bye----"If you're too late"--these were his words--"I'll never look
at you again."in God's name, stop!----

KNEIRTJE.Twelve years ago--when the Clementine--I sat here as I am
now.[Sobs with her face between her trembling old hands.]Ach, poor, dear Kneir, I am so sorry for you.My husband and four sons----

MATHILDE.John went back to the office.We have written an
appeal, the Burgomaster's wife and I, and it's going to be in all
the papers tomorrow.Here, Kaps----[Hands Kaps a sheet of paper which
he places on desk--Bos motions to her to go.]Let her wait a while,
Clemens.I have a couple of cold chops--that will brace
her up--and--and--let's make up with her.You have no objections
to her coming again to do the cleaning?We won't forget you, do you
hear?Now, my only hope is--my niece's child.She is with child by my
son----[Softly smiling.]No, that isn't a misfortune
now----

BOS.This immorality under your own
roof?Don't you know the rules of the fund, that no aid can be
extended to anyone leading an immoral life, or whose conduct does
not meet with our approval?I leave it to the gentlemen
themselves--to do for me--the gentlemen----

BOS.It will be a tussle with the Committee--the committee of the
fund--your son had been in prison and sang revolutionary songs.And
your niece who----However, I will do my best.I shall recommend
you, but I can't promise anything.There are seven new families,
awaiting aid, sixteen new orphans.My wife wants to give you something to take home
with you.[The bookkeeper rises, disappears
for a moment, and returns with a dish and an enamelled pan.]If you will return the dish when it's convenient,
and if you'll come again Saturday, to do the cleaning.He closes her nerveless hands about the dish and pan;
shuffles back to his stool.Kneirtje sits motionless,
in dazed agony; mumbles--moves her lips--rises with difficulty,
stumbles out of the office.]Appeal, for the
newspapers![Smiling sardonically, he comes to the foreground; leaning
on Bos's desk, he reads.]"Benevolent Fellow Countrymen: Again we
urge upon your generosity an appeal in behalf of a number of destitute
widows and orphans.The lugger Good Hope----[As he continues reading.]End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Good Hope, by Herman Heijermans, Jr.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band.""I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place.'Henry thinks,' said Lord Everingham, 'that the people are to be fed by
dancing round a May-pole.''But will the people be more fed because they do not dance round a
May-pole?''And why should dancing round a May-pole be more obsolete than holding a
Chapter of the Garter?'The Duke, who was a blue ribbon, felt this a home thrust.'I must say,'
said his Grace, 'that I for one deeply regret that our popular customs
have been permitted to fall so into desuetude.''The Spirit of the Age is against such things,' said Lord Everingham.'And what is the Spirit of the Age?''The Spirit of Utility,' said Lord Everingham.'And you think then that ceremony is not useful?'urged Coningsby,
mildly.'It depends upon circumstances,' said Lord Everingham.'There are some
ceremonies, no doubt, that are very proper, and of course very useful.But the best thing we can do for the labouring classes is to provide
them with work.''But what do you mean by the labouring classes, Everingham?''Lawyers are a labouring class, for instance, and by the bye
sufficiently provided with work.But would you approve of Westminster
Hall being denuded of all its ceremonies?''Theresa brings me terrible accounts of the sufferings of the poor about
us,' said the Duke, shaking his head.'How do you find them about you, Mr.'I have revived the monastic customs at St.Genevieve,' said the young
man, blushing.'There is an almsgiving twice a-week.''I am sure I wish I could see the labouring classes happy,' said the
Duke.pray do not use, my dear father, that phrase, the labouring
classes!''What do you think, Coningsby, the other day
we had a meeting in this neighbourhood to vote an agricultural petition
that was to comprise all classes.I went with my father, and I was
made chairman of the committee to draw up the petition.Of course, I
described it as the petition of the nobility, clergy, gentry, yeomanry,
and peasantry of the county of ----; and, could you believe it,
they struck out _peasantry_ as a word no longer used, and inserted
_labourers_.''What can it signify,' said Lord Everingham, 'whether a man be called a
labourer or a peasant?''And what can it signify,' said his brother-in-law, 'whether a man be
called Mr.They were the most affectionate family under this roof of Beaumanoir,
and of all members of it, Lord Henry the sweetest tempered, and yet it
was astonishing what sharp skirmishes every day arose between him and
his brother-in-law, during that 'little half-hour' that forms so happily
the political character of the nation.The Duke, who from experience
felt that a guerilla movement was impending, asked his guests whether
they would take any more claret; and on their signifying their dissent,
moved an adjournment to the ladies.They joined the ladies in the music-room.Coningsby, not experienced
in feminine society, and who found a little difficulty from want
of practice in maintaining conversation, though he was desirous
of succeeding, was delighted with Lady Everingham, who, instead of
requiring to be amused, amused him; and suggested so many subjects,
and glanced at so many topics, that there never was that cold, awkward
pause, so common with sullen spirits and barren brains.Lady Everingham
thoroughly understood the art of conversation, which, indeed, consists
of the exercise of two fine qualities.You must originate, and you must
sympathise; you must possess at the same time the habit of communicating
and the habit of listening.Lady Everingham was not a celebrated beauty, but she was something
infinitely more delightful, a captivating woman.There were combined,
in her, qualities not commonly met together, great vivacity of mind with
great grace of manner.Her words sparkled and her movements charmed.There was, indeed, in all she said and did, that congruity that
indicates a complete and harmonious organisation.It was the same just
proportion which characterised her form: a shape slight and undulating
with grace; the most beautifully shaped ear; a small, soft hand; a foot
that would have fitted the glass slipper; and which, by the bye, she
lost no opportunity of displaying; and she was right, for it was a
model.Lady Theresa sang like a seraph: a rich voice, a
grand style.And her sister could support her with grace and sweetness.The Duke took up a review, and looked
at Rigby's last slashing article.The country seemed ruined, but it
appeared that the Whigs were still worse off than the Tories.Lord
Everingham, lounging in an easy chair, perused with great satisfaction
his _Morning Chronicle_, which contained a cutting reply to Mr.Rigby's
article, not quite so'slashing' as the Right Honourable scribe's
manifesto, but with some searching mockery, that became the subject and
the subject-monger.Lyle seated himself by the Duchess, and encouraged by her amenity,
and speaking in whispers, became animated and agreeable, occasionally
patting the lap-dog.Coningsby stood by the singers, or talked with
them when the music had ceased: and Henry Sydney looked over a volume
of Strutt's _Sports and Pastimes_, occasionally, without taking his eyes
off the volume, calling the attention of his friends to his discoveries.Lyle rose to depart, for he had some miles to return; he came
forward with some hesitation, to hope that Coningsby would visit his
bloodhounds, which Lord Henry had told him Coningsby had expressed
a wish to do.Lady Everingham remarked that she had not been at St.Genevieve since she was a girl, and it appeared Lady Theresa had never
visited it.Lady Everingham proposed that they should all ride over
on the morrow, and she appealed to her husband for his approbation,
instantly given, for though she loved admiration, and he apparently was
an iceberg, they were really devoted to each other.Then there was a
consultation as to their arrangements.The Duchess would drive over in
her pony chair with Theresa.The Duke, as usual, had affairs that
would occupy him.It was a happy suggestion, all
anticipated pleasure; and the evening terminated with the prospect of
what Lady Everingham called an adventure.The ladies themselves soon withdrew; the gentlemen lingered for a
while; the Duke took up his candle, and bid his guests good night; Lord
Everingham drank a glass of Seltzer water, nodded, and vanished.Lord
Henry and his friend sat up talking over the past.They were too young
to call them old times; and yet what a life seemed to have elapsed since
they had quitted Eton, dear old Eton!Their boyish feelings, and still
latent boyish character, developed with their reminiscences.The eldest: I saw him the
other day at Nottingham; he is in the Rifles.Do you remember that day
at Sirly Hall, that Paulet had that row with Dickinson?I tell you who was a good
fellow, Paulet's little cousin.I had a letter from him
the other day.We shall find him at
Cambridge in October.I suppose you know Millbank has gone to Oriel.I wonder who will have our room at Cookesley's?How well he behaved when there was that
row about our going out with the hounds?It
makes me laugh now when I think of it.I tell you who was a good fellow,
Kangaroo Gray; I liked him.I don't know any fellow who sang a better
song!''By the bye,' said Coningsby, 'what sort of fellow is Eustace Lyle?I will tell you all about him,' said Lord Henry.'He is a great
ally of mine, and I think you will like him very much.It is a Roman
Catholic family, about the oldest we have in the county, and the
wealthiest.You see, Lyle's father was the most violent ultra Whig,
and so were all Eustace's guardians; but the moment he came of age, he
announced that he should not mix himself up with either of the parties
in the county, and that his tenantry might act exactly as they thought
fit.My father thinks, of course, that Lyle is a Conservative, and that
he only waits the occasion to come forward; but he is quite wrong.I
know Lyle well, and he speaks to me without disguise.You see 'tis an
old Cavalier family, and Lyle has all the opinions and feelings of his
race.He will not ally himself with anti-monarchists, and democrats,
and infidels, and sectarians; at the same time, why should he support a
party who pretend to oppose these, but who never lose an opportunity
of insulting his religion, and would deprive him, if possible, of
the advantages of the very institutions which his family assisted in
establishing?'I am glad to have made his acquaintance,' said Coningsby.'He is the most shy fellow, especially
among women, that I ever knew, but he is very popular in the county.He
does an amazing deal of good, and is one of the best riders we have.My
father says, the very best; bold, but so very certain.''My senior by a year: he is just of age.'A year younger than Gaston de Foix when he won
Ravenna, and four years younger than John of Austria when he won
Lepanto,' observed Coningsby, musingly.'I vote we go to bed, old
fellow!'In a valley, not far from the margin of a beautiful river, raised on a
lofty and artificial terrace at the base of a range of wooded heights,
was a pile of modern building in the finest style of Christian
architecture.It was of great extent and richly decorated.Built of
a white and glittering stone, it sparkled with its pinnacles in the
sunshine as it rose in strong relief against its verdant background.The winding valley, which was studded, but not too closely studded, with
clumps of old trees, formed for a great extent on either side of the
mansion a grassy demesne, which was called the Lower Park; but it was
a region bearing the name of the Upper Park, that was the peculiar and
most picturesque feature of this splendid residence.The wooded heights
that formed the valley were not, as they appeared, a range of hills.Their crest was only the abrupt termination of a vast and enclosed
tableland, abounding in all the qualities of the ancient chase: turf and
trees, a wilderness of underwood, and a vast spread of gorse and fern.The deer, that abounded, lived here in a world as savage as themselves:
trooping down in the evening to the river.Some of them, indeed, were
ever in sight of those who were in the valley, and you might often
observe various groups clustered on the green heights above the mansion,
the effect of which was most inspiriting and graceful.Sometimes in the
twilight, a solitary form, magnified by the illusive hour, might be seen
standing on the brink of the steep, large and black against the clear
sky.Genevieve as it appeared to
our friends from Beaumanoir, winding into the valley the day after
Mr.The valley opened for about half-a-mile
opposite the mansion, which gave to the dwellers in it a view over an
extensive and richly-cultivated country.It was through this district
that the party from Beaumanoir had pursued their way.The first glance
at the building, its striking situation, its beautiful form, its
brilliant colour, its great extent, a gathering as it seemed of
galleries, halls, and chapels, mullioned windows, portals of clustered
columns, and groups of airy pinnacles and fretwork spires, called forth
a general cry of wonder and of praise.The ride from Beaumanoir had been delightful; the breath of summer in
every breeze, the light of summer on every tree.The gay laugh of
Lady Everingham rang frequently in the air; often were her sunny eyes
directed to Coningsby, as she called his attention to some fair object
or some pretty effect.She played the hostess of Nature, and introduced
him to all the beauties.He cantered forward with greetings on a
fat little fawn- pony, with a long white mane and white flowing
tail, and the wickedest eye in the world.He rode by the side of the
Duchess, and indicated their gently-descending route.They arrived, and the peacocks, who were sunning themselves on the
turrets, expanded their plumage to welcome them.'I can remember the old house,' said the Duchess, as she took Mr.Lyle's
arm; 'and I am happy to see the new one.The Duke had prepared me for
much beauty, but the reality exceeds his report.'They entered by a short corridor into a large hall.They would have
stopped to admire its rich roof, its gallery and screen; but their host
suggested that they should refresh themselves after their ride, and they
followed him through several apartments into a spacious chamber, its
oaken panels covered with a series of interesting pictures, representing
the siege of St.Genevieve by the Parliament forces in 1643: the various
assaults and sallies, and the final discomfiture of the rebels.In all
these figured a brave and graceful Sir Eustace Lyle, in cuirass and
buff jerkin, with gleaming sword and flowing plume.The sight of these
pictures was ever a source of great excitement to Henry Sydney, who
always lamented his ill-luck in not living in such days; nay, would
insist that all others must equally deplore their evil destiny.'See, Coningsby, this battery on the Upper Park,' said Lord Henry.'This did the business: how it rakes up the valley; Sir Eustace works it
himself.Mother, what a pity Beaumanoir was not besieged!''It may be,' said Coningsby.'I always fancy a siege must be so interesting,' said Lady Everingham.'I hope the next siege may be at Beaumanoir, instead of St.Genevieve,' said Lyle, laughing; 'as Henry Sydney has such a military
predisposition.Duchess, you said the other day that you liked
Malvoisie, and here is some.'Now broach me a cask of Malvoisie,
  Bring pasty from the doe;'

said the Duchess.'A poetic repast,' said Lady Theresa.'Their breeds of sheep must have been very inferior in old days,' said
Lord Everingham, 'as they made such a noise about their venison.For my
part I consider it a thing as much gone by as tilts and tournaments.''I am sorry that they have gone by,' said Lady Theresa.'Everything has gone by that is beautiful,' said Lord Henry.'Life is much easier,' said Lord Everingham.'Life appears to me to be a fierce
struggle.''Manners are easy,' said Coningsby, 'and life is hard.''And I wish to see things exactly the reverse,' said Lord Henry.'The
means and modes of subsistence less difficult; the conduct of life more
ceremonious.''Civilisation has no time for ceremony,' said Lord Everingham.'I want to see the
hall and many other things.'There were indeed many other things to see: a long gallery, rich in
ancestral portraits, specimens of art and costume from Holbein to
Lawrence; courtiers of the Tudors, and cavaliers of the Stuarts,
terminating in red-coated squires fresh from the field, and gentlemen
buttoned up in black coats, and sitting in library chairs, with their
backs to a crimson curtain.Woman, however, is always charming; and the
present generation may view their mothers painted by Lawrence, as if
they were patronesses of Almack's; or their grandmothers by Reynolds,
as Robinettas caressing birds, with as much delight as they gaze on
the dewy-eyed matrons of Lely, and the proud bearing of the heroines
of Vandyke.But what interested them more than the gallery, or the rich
saloons, or even the baronial hall, was the chapel, in which art had
exhausted all its invention, and wealth offered all its resources.The walls and vaulted roofs entirely painted in encaustic by the first
artists of Germany, and representing the principal events of the second
Testament, the splendour of the mosaic pavement, the richness of
the painted windows, the sumptuousness of the altar, crowned by a
masterpiece of Carlo Dolce and surrounded by a silver rail, the tone
of rich and solemn light that pervaded all, and blended all the various
sources of beauty into one absorbing and harmonious whole: all combined
to produce an effect which stilled them into a silence that lasted for
some minutes, until the ladies breathed their feelings in an almost
inarticulate murmur of reverence and admiration; while a tear stole to
the eye of the enthusiastic Henry Sydney.Leaving the chapel, they sauntered through the gardens, until, arriving
at their limit, they were met by the prettiest sight in the world; a
group of little pony chairs, each drawn by a little fat fawn-
pony, like the one that Mr.Lord Henry drove his
mother; Lord Everingham, Lady Theresa; Lady Everingham was attended by
Coningsby.Their host cantered by the Duchess's side, and along winding
roads of easy ascent, leading through beautiful woods, and offering
charming landscapes, they reached in due time the Upper Park.'One sees our host to great advantage in his own house,' said Lady
Everingham.It is a pity that he is not
more graceful.'That chapel,' said Coningsby, 'was a fine thing.''Did you observe the picture over the
altar, the Virgin with blue eyes?I never observed blue eyes before in
such a picture.Coningsby felt embarrassed: he said something rather pointless about
admiring everything that was beautiful.'But every one has a favourite style; I want to know yours.Regular
features, do you like regular features?Or is it expression that pleases
you?''Expression; I think I like expression.Expression must be always
delightful.''I don't fence,' said Lady Everingham, with a smile.'But I think you
are right not to dance.'I was not aware of it; everybody is ambitious.''You see I know something of your character.Henry has spoken of you to
me a great deal; long before we met,--met again, I should say, for we
are old friends, remember.There is something fascinating in the first idea that your career
interests a charming woman.Coningsby felt that he was perhaps driving
a Madame de Longueville.A woman who likes ambitious men must be no
ordinary character; clearly a sort of heroine.At this moment they
reached the Upper Park, and the novel landscape changed the current of
their remarks.Far as the eye could reach there spread before them a savage sylvan
scene.It wanted, perhaps, undulation of surface, but that deficiency
was greatly compensated for by the multitude and prodigious size of the
trees; they were the largest, indeed, that could well be met with in
England; and there is no part of Europe where the timber is so huge.The broad interminable glades, the vast avenues, the quantity of deer
browsing or bounding in all directions, the thickets of yellow gorse and
green fern, and the breeze that even in the stillness of summer was ever
playing over this table-land, all produced an animated and renovating
scene.It was like suddenly visiting another country, living among other
manners, and breathing another air.They stopped for a few minutes at
a pavilion built for the purposes of the chase, and then returned, all
gratified by this visit to what appeared to be the higher regions of the
earth.As they approached the brow of the hill that hung over St.Genevieve,
they heard the great bell sound.'It is almsgiving day,' replied Mr.Lyle, looking a little embarrassed,
and for the first time blushing.'The people of the parishes with which
I am connected come to St.Genevieve twice a-week at this hour.'inquired Lord Everingham, who had stopped,
interested by the scene.'The rectors of the different parishes grant certificates to those
who in their belief merit bounty according to the rules which I have
established.These are again visited by my almoner, who countersigns
the certificate, and then they present it at the postern-gate.The
certificate explains the nature of their necessities, and my steward
acts on his discretion.'Perhaps your Grace may think that they might be relieved without all
this ceremony,' said Mr.'But I agree with
Henry and Mr.Coningsby, that Ceremony is not, as too commonly supposed,
an idle form.I wish the people constantly and visibly to comprehend
that Property is their protector and their friend.'Lyle,' said the Duchess, 'as well as my
heart.'They came along the valley, a procession of Nature, whose groups an
artist might have studied.The old man, who loved the pilgrimage too
much to avail himself of the privilege of a substitute accorded to his
grey hairs, came in person with his grandchild and his staff.There also
came the widow with her child at the breast, and others clinging to her
form; some sorrowful faces, and some pale; many a serious one, and
now and then a frolic glance; many a dame in her red cloak, and many a
maiden with her light basket; curly-headed urchins with demure looks,
and sometimes a stalwart form baffled for a time of the labour which he
desired.But not a heart there that did not bless the bell that sounded
from the tower of St.'My fathers perilled their blood and fortunes for the cause of the
Sovereignty and Church of England,' said Lyle to Coningsby, as they were
lying stretched out on the sunny turf in the park of Beaumanoir,' and
I inherit their passionate convictions.They were Catholics, as their
descendant.No doubt they would have been glad to see their ancient
faith predominant in their ancient land; but they bowed, as I bow, to an
adverse and apparently irrevocable decree.But if we could not have the
Church of our fathers, we honoured and respected the Church of their
children.It was at least a Church; a 'Catholic and Apostolic Church,'
as it daily declares itself.When we were
persecuted by Puritanic Parliaments, it was the Sovereign and the Church
of England that interposed, with the certainty of creating against
themselves odium and mistrust, to shield us from the dark and relentless
bigotry of Calvinism.''I believe,' said Coningsby, 'that if Charles I. had hanged all the
Catholic priests that Parliament petitioned him to execute, he would
never have lost his crown.''You were mentioning my father,' continued Lyle.Galled by political exclusion, he connected himself with that
party in the State which began to intimate emancipation.After all, they
did not emancipate us.It was the fall of the Papacy in England that
founded the Whig aristocracy; a fact that must always lie at the bottom
of their hearts, as, I assure you, it does of mine.'I gathered at an early age,' continued Lyle, 'that I was expected to
inherit my father's political connections with the family estates.Under
ordinary circumstances this would probably have occurred.In times that
did not force one to ponder, it is not likely I should have recoiled
from uniting myself with a party formed of the best families in England,
and ever famous for accomplished men and charming women.But I enter
life in the midst of a convulsion in which the very principles of our
political and social systems are called in question.I cannot unite
myself with the party of destruction.It is an operative cause alien
to my being.The Duke talks to me of
Conservative principles; but he does not inform me what they are.I
observe indeed a party in the State whose rule it is to consent to no
change, until it is clamorously called for, and then instantly to yield;
but those are Concessionary, not Conservative principles.This party
treats institutions as we do our pheasants, they preserve only to
destroy them.But is there a statesman among these Conservatives who
offers us a dogma for a guide, or defines any great political truth
which we should aspire to establish?It seems to me a, barren thing,
this Conservatism, an unhappy cross-breed; the mule of politics that
engenders nothing.What do you think of all this, Coningsby?I assure
you I feel confused, perplexed, harassed.I know I have public duties to
perform; I am, in fact, every day of my life solicited by all parties
to throw the weight of my influence in one scale or another; but I am
paralysed.I often wish I had no position in the country.The sense
of its responsibility depresses me; makes me miserable.I speak to you
without reserve; with a frankness which our short acquaintance scarcely
authorises; but Henry Sydney has so often talked to me of you, and
I have so long wished to know you, that I open my heart without
restraint.''My dear fellow,' said Coningsby, 'you have but described my feelings
when you depicted your own.My mind on these subjects has long been
a chaos.I float in a sea of troubles, and should long ago have
been wrecked had I not been sustained by a profound, however vague,
conviction, that there are still great truths, if we could but work them
out; that Government, for instance, should be loved and not hated, and
that Religion should be a faith and not a form.'The moral influence of residence furnishes some of the most interesting
traits of our national manners.The presence of this power was very
apparent throughout the district that surrounded Beaumanoir.The ladies
of that house were deeply sensible of the responsibility of their
position; thoroughly comprehending their duties, they fulfilled them
without affectation, with earnestness, and with that effect which
springs from a knowledge of the subject.The consequences were visible
in the tone of the peasantry being superior to that which we too often
witness.The ancient feudal feeling that lingers in these sequestered
haunts is an instrument which, when skilfully wielded, may be productive
of vast social benefit.The Duke understood this well; and his family
had imbibed all his views, and seconded them.Lady Everingham, once more
in the scene of her past life, resumed the exercise of gentle offices,
as if she had never ceased to be a daughter of the house, and as if
another domain had not its claims upon her solicitude.Coningsby was
often the companion of herself and her sister in their pilgrimages
of charity and kindness.He admired the graceful energy, and thorough
acquaintance with details, with which Lady Everingham superintended
schools, organised societies of relief, and the discrimination which she
brought to bear upon individual cases of suffering or misfortune.He was
deeply interested as he watched the magic of her manner, as she melted
the obdurate, inspired the slothful, consoled the afflicted, and
animated with her smiles and ready phrase the energetic and the dutiful.Nor on these occasions was Lady Theresa seen under less favourable
auspices.Without the vivacity of her sister, there was in her demeanour
a sweet seriousness of purpose that was most winning; and sometimes a
burst of energy, a trait of decision, which strikingly contrasted with
the somewhat over-controlled character of her life in drawing-rooms.In the society of these engaging companions, time for Coningsby glided
away in a course which he sometimes wished nothing might disturb.Apart
from them, he frequently felt himself pensive and vaguely disquieted.Even the society of Henry Sydney or Eustace Lyle, much as under
ordinary circumstances they would have been adapted to his mood, did not
compensate for the absence of that indefinite, that novel, that strange,
yet sweet excitement, which he felt, he knew not exactly how or why,
stealing over his senses.Sometimes the countenance of Theresa Sydney
flitted over his musing vision; sometimes the merry voice of Lady
Everingham haunted his ear.But to be their companion in ride or ramble;
to avoid any arrangement which for many hours should deprive him of
their presence; was every day with Coningsby a principal object.One day he had been out shooting rabbits with Lyle and Henry Sydney, and
returned with them late to Beaumanoir to dinner.He had not enjoyed his
sport, and he had not shot at all well.He had been dreamy, silent, had
deeply felt the want of Lady Everingham's conversation, that was ever so
poignant and so interestingly personal to himself; one of the secrets of
her sway, though Coningsby was not then quite conscious of it.Talk to a
man about himself, and he is generally captivated.That is the real way
to win him.The only difference between men and women in this respect
is, that most women are vain, and some men are not.There are some men
who have no self-love; but if they have, female vanity is but a trifling
and airy passion compared with the vast voracity of appetite which in
the sterner sex can swallow anything, and always crave for more.When Coningsby entered the drawing-room, there seemed a somewhat unusual
bustle in the room, but as the twilight had descended, it was at first
rather difficult to distinguish who was present.A gentleman of pleasing appearance was near a sofa
on which the Duchess and Lady Everingham were seated, and discoursing
with some volubility.His phrases seemed to command attention; his
audience had an animated glance, eyes sparkling with intelligence and
interest; not a word was disregarded.Coningsby did not advance as was
his custom; he had a sort of instinct, that the stranger was discoursing
of matters of which he knew nothing.He turned to a table, he took up a
book, which he began to read upside downwards.A hand was lightly placed
on his shoulder.He looked round, it was another stranger; who said,
however, in a tone of familiar friendliness,

'How do you do, Coningsby?'It was a young man about four-and-twenty years of age, tall,
good-looking.Old recollections, his intimate greeting, a strong family
likeness, helped Coningsby to conjecture correctly who was the person
who addressed him.It was, indeed, the eldest son of the Duke, the
Marquis of Beaumanoir, who had arrived at his father's unexpectedly with
his friend, Mr.Melton, on their way to the north.Melton was a gentleman of the highest fashion, and a great favourite
in society.He was about thirty, good-looking, with an air that
commanded attention, and manners, though facile, sufficiently finished.He was communicative, though calm, and without being witty, had at his
service a turn of phrase, acquired by practice and success, which was,
or which always seemed to be, poignant.The ladies seemed especially to
be delighted at his arrival.He knew everything of everybody they cared
about; and Coningsby listened in silence to names which for the first
time reached his ears, but which seemed to excite great interest.Melton frequently addressed his most lively observations and his most
sparkling anecdotes to Lady Everingham, who evidently relished all that
he said, and returned him in kind.Melton maintained what
appeared a most entertaining conversation, principally about things and
persons which did not in any way interest our hero; who, however, had
the satisfaction of hearing Lady Everingham, in the drawing-room, say in
a careless tone to the Duchess.'I am so glad, mamma, that Mr.Melton has come; we wanted some
amusement.'What a revelation to Coningsby of his infinite
insignificance!Coningsby entertained a great aversion for Mr.Melton,
but felt his spirit unequal to the social contest.The genius of
the untutored, inexperienced youth quailed before that of the
long-practised, skilful man of the world.What was the secret of this ease, that nothing could disturb, and
yet was not deficient in deference and good taste?And then his dress,
it seemed fashioned by some unearthly artist; yet it was impossible
to detect the unobtrusive causes of the general effect that was
irresistible.Coningsby's coat was made by Stultz; almost every fellow
in the sixth form had his coats made by Stultz; yet Coningsby fancied
that his own garment looked as if it had been furnished by some rustic
slopseller.Melton got his boots from, and
glanced at his own, which, though made in St.James's Street, seemed to
him to have a cloddish air.Melton should see Beaumanoir to
the greatest advantage.Melton had never been there before, except
at Christmas, with the house full of visitors and factitious gaiety.Accordingly, there were long rides every day,
which Lady Everingham called expeditions, and which generally produced
some slight incident which she styled an adventure.She was kind to
Coningsby, but had no time to indulge in the lengthened conversations
which he had previously found so magical.Melton was always on
the scene, the monopolising hero, it would seem, of every thought, and
phrase, and plan.Coningsby began to think that Beaumanoir was not so
delightful a place as he had imagined.He began to think that he had
stayed there perhaps too long.Rigby,
to inform him that he was expected at Coningsby Castle at the beginning
of September, to meet Lord Monmouth, who had returned to England, and
for grave and special reasons was about to reside at his chief seat,
which he had not visited for many years.Coningsby had intended to have
remained at Beaumanoir until that time; but suddenly it occurred to
him, that the Age of Ruins was past, and that he ought to seize the
opportunity of visiting Manchester, which was in the same county as the
castle of his grandfather.So difficult is it to speculate upon
events!Muse as we may, we are the creatures of circumstances; and the
unexpected arrival of a London dandy at the country-seat of an English
nobleman sent this representative of the New Generation, fresh from
Eton, nursed in prejudices, yet with a mind predisposed to inquiry
and prone to meditation, to a scene apt to stimulate both intellectual
processes; which demanded investigation and induced thought, the great
METROPOLIS OF LABOUR.BOOK IV


CHAPTER I.


A great city, whose image dwells in the memory of man, is the type of
some great idea.Rome represents conquest; Faith hovers over the towers
of Jerusalem; and Athens embodies the pre-eminent quality of the antique
world, Art.In modern ages, Commerce has created London; while Manners, in the most
comprehensive sense of the word, have long found a supreme capital in
the airy and bright-minded city of the Seine.Art was to the ancient world, Science is to the modern: the distinctive
faculty.In the minds of men the useful has succeeded to the beautiful.Instead of the city of the Violet Crown, a Lancashire village has
expanded into a mighty region of factories and warehouses.Yet, rightly
understood, Manchester is as great a human exploit as Athens.The inhabitants, indeed, are not so impressed with their idiosyncrasy as
the countrymen of Pericles and Phidias.They do not fully comprehend the
position which they occupy.It is the philosopher alone who can conceive
the grandeur of Manchester, and the immensity of its future.There are
yet great truths to tell, if we had either the courage to announce or
the temper to receive them.A feeling of melancholy, even of uneasiness, attends our first entrance
into a great town, especially at night.Is it that the sense of all this
vast existence with which we have no connexion, where we are utterly
unknown, oppresses us with our insignificance?Is it that it is terrible
to feel friendless where all have friends?Behold a community where you are unknown, but
where you will be known, perhaps honoured.A place where you have no
friends, but where, also, you have no enemies.A spot that has hitherto
been a blank in your thoughts, as you have been a cipher in its
sensations, and yet a spot, perhaps, pregnant with your destiny!There is, perhaps, no act of memory so profoundly interesting as to
recall the careless mood and moment in which we have entered a town,
a house, a chamber, on the eve of an acquaintance or an event that has
given colour and an impulse to our future life.Unquestionably it is a power that acts mainly by female agents.Women
are the Priestesses of Predestination.Man conceives Fortune, but Woman conducts it.It is the Spirit of Man that says, 'I will be great;' but it is the
Sympathy of Woman that usually makes him so.It was not the comely and courteous hostess of the Adelphi Hotel,
Manchester, that gave occasion to these remarks, though she may deserve
them, and though she was most kind to our Coningsby as he came in late
at night very tired, and not in very good humour.He had travelled the whole day through the great district of labour,
his mind excited by strange sights, and at length wearied by their
multiplication.He had passed over the plains where iron and coal
supersede turf and corn, dingy as the entrance of Hades, and flaming
with furnaces; and now he was among illumined factories with more
windows than Italian palaces, and smoking chimneys taller than Egyptian
obelisks.Alone in the great metropolis of machinery itself, sitting
down in a solitary coffee-room glaring with gas, with no appetite, a
whirling head, and not a plan or purpose for the morrow, why was he
there?Because a being, whose name even was unknown to him, had met him
in a hedge alehouse during a thunderstorm, and told him that the Age of
Ruins was past.Remarkable instance of the influence of an individual; some evidence of
the extreme susceptibility of our hero.That, however, could be
got rid of.The summer air was sweet, even in this
land of smoke and toil.He feels a sensation such as in Lisbon or Lima
precedes an earthquake.It is a sympathetic
affection occasioned by a steam-engine in a neighbouring factory.Notwithstanding, however, all these novel incidents, Coningsby slept the
deep sleep of youth and health, of a brain which, however occasionally
perplexed by thought, had never been harassed by anxiety.He rose early,
freshened, and in fine spirits.And by the time the deviled chicken and
the buttered toast, that mysterious and incomparable luxury, which can
only be obtained at an inn, had disappeared, he felt all the delightful
excitement of travel.Not a letter had Coningsby; not an individual in
that vast city was known to him.He went to consult his kind hostess,
who smiled confidence.He was to mention her name at one place, his
own at another.All would be right; she seemed to have reliance in the
destiny of such a nice young man.He saw all; they were kind and hospitable to the young stranger,
whose thought, and earnestness, and gentle manners attracted them.One
recommended him to another; all tried to aid and assist him.He entered
chambers vaster than are told of in Arabian fable, and peopled with
habitants more wondrous than Afrite or Peri.For there he beheld, in
long-continued ranks, those mysterious forms full of existence without
life, that perform with facility, and in an instant, what man can fulfil
only with difficulty and in days.A machine is a slave that neither
brings nor bears degradation; it is a being endowed with the greatest
degree of energy, and acting under the greatest degree of excitement,
yet free at the same time from all passion and emotion.It is,
therefore, not only a slave, but a supernatural slave.And why should
one say that the machine does not live?It breathes, for its breath
forms the atmosphere of some towns.It moves with more regularity than
man.Does not the spindle sing like a merry girl
at her work, and the steam-engine roar in jolly chorus, like a strong
artisan handling his lusty tools, and gaining a fair day's wages for a
fair day's toil?Nor should the weaving-room be forgotten, where a thousand or fifteen
hundred girls may be observed in their coral necklaces, working like
Penelope in the daytime; some pretty, some pert, some graceful and
jocund, some absorbed in their occupation; a little serious some, few
sad.And the cotton you have observed in its rude state, that you have
seen the silent spinner change into thread, and the bustling weaver
convert into cloth, you may now watch as in a moment it is tinted
with beautiful colours, or printed with fanciful patterns.And yet the
mystery of mysteries is to view machines making machines; a spectacle
that fills the mind with curious, and even awful, speculation.From early morn to the late twilight, our Coningsby for several days
devoted himself to the comprehension of Manchester.It was to him a new
world, pregnant with new ideas, and suggestive of new trains of thought
and feeling.In this unprecedented partnership between capital and
science, working on a spot which Nature had indicated as the fitting
theatre of their exploits, he beheld a great source of the wealth of
nations which had been reserved for these times, and he perceived that
this wealth was rapidly developing classes whose power was imperfectly
recognised in the constitutional scheme, and whose duties in the social
system seemed altogether omitted.Young as he was, the bent of his mind,
and the inquisitive spirit of the times, had sufficiently prepared him,
not indeed to grapple with these questions, but to be sensible of their
existence, and to ponder.One evening, in the coffee-room of the hotel, having just finished his
well-earned dinner, and relaxing his mind for the moment in a fresh
research into the Manchester Guide, an individual, who had also been
dining in the same apartment, rose from his table, and, after lolling
over the empty fireplace, reading the framed announcements, looking
at the directions of several letters waiting there for their owners,
picking his teeth, turned round to Coningsby, and, with an air of uneasy
familiarity, said,--

'First visit to Manchester, sir?''And pray, sir, how did you find business as you came along?And yet there is a something, a sort of a something; didn't
it strike you, sir, there was a something?A deal of queer paper about,
sir!''I fear you are speaking on a subject of which I know nothing,' said
Coningsby, smiling;' I do not understand business at all; though I am
not surprised that, being at Manchester, you should suppose so.''No,' said Coningsby, 'I am nothing.'Pleased
with Manchester, I dare say?''And astonished,' said Coningsby; 'I think, in the whole course of my
life, I never saw so much to admire.''Seen all the lions, have no doubt?''I think I have seen everything,' said Coningsby, rather eager and with
some pride.'Very well, very well,' exclaimed the stranger, in a patronising tone.Birley's weaving-room, I dare say?'said the stranger, with a rather supercilious
smile.'But after all,' said Coningsby, with animation, 'it is the machinery
without any interposition of manual power that overwhelms me.It haunts
me in my dreams,' continued Coningsby; 'I see cities peopled with
machines.Certainly Manchester is the most wonderful city of modern
times!'The stranger stared a little at the enthusiasm of his companion, and
then picked his teeth.'Of all the remarkable things here,' said Coningsby, 'what on the whole,
sir, do you look upon as the most so?''Why, in the way of machinery, you know,' said the stranger, very
quietly, 'Manchester is a dead letter.''Dead and buried,' said the stranger, accompanying his words with
that peculiar application of his thumb to his nose that signifies so
eloquently that all is up.'It's a booked place though,' said the stranger, 'and no mistake.We
have all of us a very great respect for Manchester, of course; look upon
her as a sort of mother, and all that sort of thing.But she is behind
the times, sir, and that won't do in this age.The long and short of it
is, Manchester is gone by.''I thought her only fault might be she was too much in advance of the
rest of the country,' said Coningsby, innocently.'If you want to see life,' said the stranger, 'go to Staleybridge or
Bolton.'But the population of Manchester is increasing,' said Coningsby.You see we have all of us a great respect for
the town.It is a sort of metropolis of this district, and there is
a good deal of capital in the place.And it has some firstrate
institutions.That's a noble institution,
full of commercial enterprise; understands the age, sir; high-pressure
to the backbone.I came up to town to see the manager to-day.I am
building a new mill now myself at Staleybridge, and mean to open it by
January, and when I do, I'll give you leave to pay another visit to Mr.Birley's weaving-room, with my compliments.''I am very sorry,' said Coningsby, 'that I have only another day left;
but pray tell me, what would you recommend me most to see within a
reasonable distance of Manchester?''My mill is not finished,' said the stranger musingly, 'and though there
is still a great deal worth seeing at Staleybridge, still you had
better wait to see my new mill.And Bolton, let me see; Bolton, there is
nothing at Bolton that can hold up its head for a moment against my new
mill; but then it is not finished.What a pity
this is not the 1st of January, and then my new mill would be at work!And the Oxford Road Works, where they are always making a little change,
bit by bit reform, eh!not a very particular fine appetite, I suspect,
for dinner, at the Oxford Road Works, the day they hear of my new mill
being at work.But you want to see something tip-top.Well, there's
Millbank; that's regular slap-up, quite a sight, regular lion; if I were
you I would see Millbank.'said Coningsby; 'what Millbank?''Millbank of Millbank, made the place, made it himself.About three
miles from Bolton; train to-morrow morning at 7.25, get a fly at the
station, and you will be at Millbank by 8.40.''Unfortunately I am engaged to-morrow morning,' said Coningsby, 'and yet
I am most anxious, particularly anxious, to see Millbank.''Well, there's a late train,' said the stranger, '3.15; you will be
there by 4.30.''I think I could manage that,' said Coningsby.'Do,' said the stranger; 'and if you ever find yourself at Staleybridge,
I shall be very happy to be of service.And he presented Coningsby with his card as he wished him good
night.G. O. A. HEAD, STALEYBRIDGE.In a green valley of Lancaster, contiguous to that district of factories
on which we have already touched, a clear and powerful stream flows
through a broad meadow land.Upon its margin, adorned, rather than
shadowed, by some old elm-trees, for they are too distant to serve
except for ornament, rises a vast deep red brick pile, which though
formal and monotonous in its general character, is not without a
certain beauty of proportion and an artist-like finish in its occasional
masonry.The front, which is of great extent, and covered with many
tiers of small windows, is flanked by two projecting wings in the same
style, which form a large court, completed by a dwarf wall crowned
with a light, and rather elegant railing; in the centre, the principal
entrance, a lofty portal of bold and beautiful design, surmounted by a
statue of Commerce.This building, not without a degree of dignity, is what is technically,
and not very felicitously, called a mill; always translated by the
French in their accounts of our manufacturing riots,'moulin;' and which
really was the principal factory of Oswald Millbank, the father of that
youth whom, we trust, our readers have not quite forgotten.At some little distance, and rather withdrawn from the principal stream,
were two other smaller structures of the same style.About a quarter of
a mile further on, appeared a village of not inconsiderable size, and
remarkable from the neatness and even picturesque character of its
architecture, and the gay gardens that surrounded it.On a sunny
knoll in the background rose a church, in the best style of Christian
architecture, and near it was a clerical residence and a school-house
of similar design.The village, too, could boast of another public
building; an Institute where there were a library and a lecture-room;
and a reading-hall, which any one might frequent at certain hours, and
under reasonable regulations.On the other side of the principal factory, but more remote, about
half-a-mile up the valley, surrounded by beautiful meadows, and built
on an agreeable and well-wooded elevation, was the mansion of
the mill-owner; apparently a commodious and not inconsiderable
dwelling-house, built in what is called a villa style, with a variety
of gardens and conservatories.The atmosphere of this somewhat striking
settlement was not disturbed and polluted by the dark vapour, which,
to the shame of Manchester, still infests that great town, for Mr.Millbank, who liked nothing so much as an invention, unless it were an
experiment, took care to consume his own smoke.The sun was declining when Coningsby arrived at Millbank, and the
gratification which he experienced on first beholding it, was not a
little diminished, when, on enquiring at the village, he was informed
that the hour was past for seeing the works.Determined not to
relinquish his purpose without a struggle, he repaired to the principal
mill, and entered the counting-house, which was situated in one of the
wings of the building.said one of three individuals sitting on high
stools behind a high desk.'I wish, if possible, to see the works.''Quite impossible, sir;' and the clerk, withdrawing his glance,
continued his writing.'No admission without an order, and no admission
with an order after two o'clock.''I am very unfortunate,' said Coningsby.Give me ledger K. X., will you, Mr.Millbank would grant me permission,' said Coningsby.'Very likely, sir; to-morrow.Millbank is there, sir, but very much
engaged.'He pointed to an inner counting-house, and the glass doors
permitted Coningsby to observe several individuals in close converse.Oswald is in Belgium,' said the clerk.Millbank, and say a friend of his son's
at Eton is here, and here only for a day, and wishes very much to see
his works?'Millbank now, sir; but, if you like to sit
down, you can wait and see him yourself.'Coningsby was content to sit down, though he grew very impatient at the
end of a quarter of an hour.The ticking of the clock, the scratching
of the pens of the three silent clerks, irritated him.At length, voices
were heard, doors opened, and the clerk said, 'Mr.Millbank is coming,
sir,' but nobody came; voices became hushed, doors were shut; again
nothing was heard, save the ticking of the clock and the scratching of
the pen.At length there was a general stir, and they all did come forth, Mr.Millbank among them, a well-proportioned, comely man, with a fair face
inclining to ruddiness, a quick, glancing, hazel eye, the whitest teeth,
and short, curly, chestnut hair, here and there slightly tinged with
grey.It was a visage of energy and decision.He was about to pass through the counting-house with his companions,
with whom his affairs were not concluded, when he observed Coningsby,
who had risen.he inquired of his clerk, who bowed
assent.'I shall be at your service, sir, the moment I have finished with these
gentlemen.''The gentleman wishes to see the works, sir,' said the clerk.'He can see the works at proper times,' said Mr.Millbank, somewhat
pettishly; 'tell him the regulations;' and he was about to go.'I beg your pardon, sir,' said Coningsby, coming forward, and with an
air of earnestness and grace that arrested the step of the manufacturer.'I am aware of the regulations, but would beg to be permitted to
infringe them.''It cannot be, sir,' said Mr.'I thought, sir, being here only for a day, and as a friend of your
son--'

Mr.Millbank stopped and said,

'Oh!'Yes, sir, at Eton; and I had hoped perhaps to have found him here.''I am very much engaged, sir, at this moment,' said Mr.Millbank; 'I am
sorry I cannot pay you any personal attention, but my clerk will show
you everything.Benson, let this gentleman see everything;' and he
withdrew.'Be pleased to write your name here, sir,' said Mr.Benson, opening
a book, and our friend wrote his name and the date of his visit to
Millbank:

  'HARRY CONINGSBY, Sept.Coningsby beheld in this great factory the last and the most refined
inventions of mechanical genius.The building had been fitted up by a
capitalist as anxious to raise a monument of the skill and power of his
order, as to obtain a return for the great investment.'It is the glory of Lancashire!'The clerk spoke freely of his master, whom he evidently idolised, and
his great achievements, and Coningsby encouraged him.He detailed to
Coningsby the plans which Mr.Millbank had pursued, both for the moral
and physical well-being of his people; how he had built churches,
and schools, and institutes; houses and cottages on a new system of
ventilation; how he had allotted gardens; established singing classes.Millbank,' continued the clerk, as he and Coningsby,
quitting the factory, re-entered the court.Millbank was approaching the factory, and the moment that he
observed them, he quickened his pace.His countenance was
rather disturbed, and his voice a little trembled, and he looked on our
friend with a glance scrutinising and serious.'I am sorry that you should have been received at this place with
so little ceremony, sir,' said Mr.Millbank; 'but had your name been
mentioned, you would have found it cherished here.'He nodded to the
clerk, who disappeared.Coningsby began to talk about the wonders of the factory, but Mr.Millbank recurred to other thoughts that were passing in his mind.He
spoke of his son: he expressed a kind reproach that Coningsby should
have thought of visiting this part of the world without giving them
some notice of his intention, that he might have been their guest, that
Oswald might have been there to receive him, that they might have made
arrangements that he should see everything, and in the best manner; in
short, that they might all have shown, however slightly, the deep sense
of their obligations to him.'My visit to Manchester, which led to this, was quite accidental,' said
Coningsby.'I am bound for the other division of the county, to pay a
visit to my grandfather, Lord Monmouth; but an irresistible desire came
over me during my journey to view this famous district of industry.It
is some days since I ought to have found myself at Coningsby, and this
is the reason why I am so pressed.'A cloud passed over the countenance of Millbank as the name of Lord
Monmouth was mentioned, but he said nothing.Turning towards Coningsby,
with an air of kindness:

'At least,' said he, 'let not Oswald hear that you did not taste our
salt.Pray dine with me to-day; there is yet an hour to dinner; and
as you have seen the factory, suppose we stroll together through the
village.'Millbank and his guest entered the
gardens of his mansion.Coningsby lingered a moment to admire the beauty
and gay profusion of the flowers.'Your situation,' said Coningsby, looking up the green and silent
valley, 'is absolutely poetic.''I try sometimes to fancy,' said Mr.Millbank, with a rather fierce
smile, 'that I am in the New World.'They entered the house; a capacious and classic hall, at the end a
staircase in the Italian fashion.As they approached it, the sweetest
and the clearest voice exclaimed from above, 'Papa!and instantly
a young girl came bounding down the stairs, but suddenly seeing a
stranger with her father she stopped upon the landing-place, and was
evidently on the point of as rapidly retreating as she had advanced,
when Mr.Millbank waved his hand to her and begged her to descend.She
came down slowly; as she approached them her father said, 'A friend you
have often heard of, Edith: this is Mr.She started; blushed very much; and then, with a trembling and uncertain
gait, advanced, put forth her hand with a wild unstudied grace, and said
in a tone of sensibility, 'How often have we all wished to see and to
thank you!'This daughter of his host was of tender years; apparently she could
scarcely have counted sixteen summers.She was delicate and fragile, but
as she raised her still blushing visage to her father's guest, Coningsby
felt that he had never beheld a countenance of such striking and such
peculiar beauty.Coningsby, Edith; a Saxon name, for she is the
daughter of a Saxon.'But the beauty of the countenance was not the beauty of the Saxons.It
was a radiant face, one of those that seem to have been touched in
their cradle by a sunbeam, and to have retained all their brilliancy and
suffused and mantling lustre.One marks sometimes such faces, diaphanous
with delicate splendour, in the southern regions of France.Her eye,
too, was the rare eye of Aquitaine; soft and long, with lashes drooping
over the cheek, dark as her clustering ringlets.Coningsby,' said Millbank to his daughter, 'is in this part of the
world only for a few hours, or I am sure he would become our guest.He
has, however, promised to stay with us now and dine.''If Miss Millbank will pardon this dress,' said Coningsby, bowing an
apology for his inevitable frock and boots; the maiden raised her eyes
and bent her head.Millbank offered to show Coningsby to
his dressing-room.When he returned he
found Miss Millbank alone.She
was playing with her dog, but ceased the moment she observed Coningsby.Coningsby, who since his practice with Lady Everingham, flattered
himself that he had advanced in small talk, and was not sorry that
he had now an opportunity of proving his prowess, made some lively
observations about pets and the breeds of lapdogs, but he was not
fortunate in extracting a response or exciting a repartee.He began then
on the beauty of Millbank, which he would on no account have avoided
seeing, and inquired when she had last heard of her brother.The young
lady, apparently much distressed, was murmuring something about Antwerp,
when the entrance of her father relieved her from her embarrassment.Dinner being announced, Coningsby offered his arm to his fair companion,
who took it with her eyes fixed on the ground.'You are very fond, I see, of flowers,' said Coningsby, as they moved
along; and the young lady said 'Yes.'The dinner was plain, but perfect of its kind.The young hostess seemed
to perform her office with a certain degree of desperate determination.She looked at a chicken and then at Coningsby, and murmured something
which he understood.Sometimes she informed herself of his tastes
or necessities in more detail, by the medium of her father, whom she
treated as a sort of dragoman; in this way: 'Would not Mr.Coningsby,
papa, take this or that, or do so and so?'Coningsby was always careful
to reply in a direct manner, without the agency of the interpreter; but
he did not advance.Even a petition for the great honour of taking a
glass of sherry with her only induced the beautiful face to bow.And yet
when she had first seen him, she had addressed him even with emotion.He felt less confidence in his increased power of
conversation.Mary moved to the bathroom.Why, Theresa Sydney was scarcely a year older than
Miss Millbank, and though she did not certainly originate like Lady
Everingham, he got on with her perfectly well.Millbank did not seem to be conscious of his daughter's silence:
at any rate, he attempted to compensate for it.He talked fluently
and well; on all subjects his opinions seemed to be decided, and his
language was precise.He was really interested in what Coningsby had
seen, and what he had felt; and this sympathy divested his manner of the
disagreeable effect that accompanies a tone inclined to be dictatorial.More than once Coningsby observed the silent daughter listening with
extreme attention to the conversation of himself and her father.A bland
expression of self-complacency spread over his features as he surveyed
his grapes, his peaches, his figs.'These grapes have gained a medal,' he told Coningsby.'Those too are
prize peaches.I have not yet been so successful with my figs.These
however promise, and perhaps this year I may be more fortunate.''What would your brother and myself have given for such a dessert at
Eton!'said Coningsby to Miss Millbank, wishing to say something, and
something too that might interest her.She seemed infinitely distressed, and yet this time would speak.'Let me give you some,' He caught by chance her glance immediately
withdrawn; yet it was a glance not only of beauty, but of feeling
and thought.She added, in a hushed and hurried tone, dividing very
nervously some grapes, 'I hardly know whether Oswald will be most
pleased or grieved when he hears that you have been here.''That he should not have been here to welcome you, and that your stay is
for so brief a time.It seems so strange that after having talked of you
for years, we should see you only for hours.''I hope I may return,' said Coningsby, 'and that Millbank may be here to
welcome me; but I hope I may be permitted to return even if he be not.'But there was no reply; and soon after, Mr.Millbank talking of the
American market, and Coningsby helping himself to a glass of claret, the
daughter of the Saxon, looking at her father, rose and left the room, so
suddenly and so quickly that Coningsby could scarcely gain the door.'Yes,' said Millbank, filling his glass, and pursuing some previous
observations, 'all that we want in this country is to be masters of our
own industry; but Saxon industry and Norman manners never will agree;
and some day, Mr.Coningsby, you will find that out.''But what do you mean by Norman manners?''Did you ever hear of the Forest of Rossendale?''If
you were staying here, you should visit the district.It is an area of
twenty-four square miles.It was disforested in the early part of the
sixteenth century, possessing at that time eighty inhabitants.Its rental in James the First's time was 120_l._ When the woollen
manufacture was introduced into the north, the shuttle competed with the
plough in Rossendale, and about forty years ago we sent them the Jenny.The eighty souls are now increased to upwards of eighty thousand, and
the rental of the forest, by the last county assessment, amounts to more
than 50,000_l._, 41,000 per cent, on the value in the reign of James
I. Now I call that an instance of Saxon industry competing successfully
with Norman manners.''Exactly,' said Coningsby, 'but those manners are gone.''From Rossendale,'said Millbank, with a grim smile; 'but not from
England.'In every place, at every hour; and feel them, too, in every
transaction of life.''I know, sir, from your son,' said Coningsby, inquiringly, 'that you are
opposed to an aristocracy.'I am for an aristocracy; but a real one, a natural one.''But, sir, is not the aristocracy of England,' said Coningsby, 'a real
one?You do not confound our peerage, for example, with the degraded
patricians of the Continent.''I do not understand how an aristocracy can exist,
unless it be distinguished by some quality which no other class of the
community possesses.If you
permit only one class of the population, for example, to bear arms, they
are an aristocracy; not one much to my taste; but still a great fact.That, however, is not the characteristic of the English peerage.I have
yet to learn they are richer than we are, better informed, wiser, or
more distinguished for public or private virtue.Is it not monstrous,
then, that a small number of men, several of whom take the titles of
Duke and Earl from towns in this very neighbourhood, towns which they
never saw, which never heard of them, which they did not form, or
build, or establish, I say, is it not monstrous, that individuals
so circumstanced, should be invested with the highest of conceivable
privileges, the privilege of making laws?I say
there is nothing in a masquerade more ridiculous.''But do you not argue from an exception, sir?''The
question is, whether a preponderance of the aristocratic principle in a
political constitution be, as I believe, conducive to the stability and
permanent power of a State; and whether the peerage, as established
in England, generally tends to that end?We must not forget in such an
estimate the influence which, in this country, is exercised over opinion
by ancient lineage.'Millbank; 'I never heard of a peer with an
ancient lineage.The real old families of this country are to be found
among the peasantry; the gentry, too, may lay some claim to old blood.I can point you out Saxon families in this county who can trace their
pedigrees beyond the Conquest; I know of some Norman gentlemen whose
fathers undoubtedly came over with the Conqueror.But a peer with an
ancient lineage is to me quite a novelty.No, no; the thirty years of
the wars of the Roses freed us from those gentlemen.I take it, after
the battle of Tewkesbury, a Norman baron was almost as rare a being in
England as a wolf is now.''I have always understood,' said Coningsby, 'that our peerage was the
finest in Europe.''From themselves,' said Millbank, 'and the heralds they pay to paint
their carriages.called his first
Parliament, there were only twenty-nine temporal peers to be found,
and even some of them took their seats illegally, for they had been
attainted.Of those twenty-nine not five remain, and they, as the
Howards for instance, are not Norman nobility.We owe the English
peerage to three sources: the spoliation of the Church; the open
and flagrant sale of its honours by the elder Stuarts; and the
boroughmongering of our own times.Those are the three main sources of
the existing peerage of England, and in my opinion disgraceful ones.But
I must apologise for my frankness in thus speaking to an aristocrat.''Oh, by no means, sir, I like discussion.Your son and myself at Eton
have had some encounters of this kind before.But if your view of the
case be correct,' added Coningsby, smiling, 'you cannot at any rate
accuse our present peers of Norman manners.''Yes, I do: they adopted Norman manners while they usurped Norman
titles.They have neither the right of the Normans, nor do they fulfil
the duty of the Normans: they did not conquer the land, and they do not
defend it.''And where will you find your natural aristocracy?''Among those men whom a nation recognises as the most eminent for
virtue, talents, and property, and, if you please, birth and standing
in the land.They guide opinion; and, therefore, they govern.I am no
leveller; I look upon an artificial equality as equally pernicious with
a factitious aristocracy; both depressing the energies, and checking the
enterprise of a nation.I like man to be free, really free: free in his
industry as well as his body.What is the use of Habeas Corpus, if a man
may not use his hands when he is out of prison?''But it appears to me you have, in a great measure, this natural
aristocracy in England.'If we had not, where should we be?It is the
counteracting power that saves us, the disturbing cause in the
calculations of short-sighted selfishness.I say it now, and I have said
it a hundred times, the House of Commons is a more aristocratic body
than the House of Lords.The fact is, a great peer would be a greater
man now in the House of Commons than in the House of Lords.Nobody
wants a second chamber, except a few disreputable individuals.It is
a valuable institution for any member of it who has no distinction,
neither character, talents, nor estate.But a peer who possesses all or
any of these great qualifications, would find himself an immeasurably
more important personage in what, by way of jest, they call the Lower
House.''Is not the revising wisdom of a senate a salutary check on the
precipitation of a popular assembly?''Why should a popular assembly, elected by the flower of a nation,
be precipitate?If precipitate, what senate could stay an assembly so
chosen?the thing has been tried over and over again;
the idea of restraining the powerful by the weak is an absurdity; the
question is settled.If we wanted a fresh illustration, we need only
look to the present state of our own House of Lords.It originates
nothing; it has, in fact, announced itself as a mere Court of
Registration of the decrees of your House of Commons; and if by any
chance it ventures to alter some miserable detail in a clause of a bill
that excites public interest, what a clatter through the country, at
Conservative banquets got up by the rural attorneys, about the power,
authority, and independence of the House of Lords; nine times nine, and
one cheer more!No, sir, you may make aristocracies by laws; you can
only maintain them by manners.The manners of England preserve it
from its laws.And they have substituted for our formal aristocracy an
essential aristocracy; the government of those who are distinguished by
their fellow-citizens.''But then it would appear,' said Coningsby, 'that the remedial action of
our manners has removed all the political and social evils of which you
complain?''They have created a power that may remove them; a power that has the
capacity to remove them.But in a great measure they still exist, and
must exist yet, I fear, for a long time.The growth of our civilisation
has ever been as slow as our oaks; but this tardy development is
preferable to the temporary expansion of the gourd.''The future seems to me sometimes a dark cloud.''I am sanguine; I am the Disciple of
Progress.My
father has often told me that in his early days the displeasure of
a peer of England was like a sentence of death to a man.Why it was
esteemed a great concession to public opinion, so late as the reign of
George II., that Lord Ferrars should be executed for murder.The king of
a new dynasty, who wished to be popular with the people, insisted on
it, and even then he was hanged with a silken cord.At any rate we
may defend ourselves now,' continued Mr.Millbank, 'and, perhaps, do
something more.I defy any peer to crush me, though there is one who
would be very glad to do it.No more of that; I am very happy to see you
at Millbank, very happy to make your acquaintance,' he continued, with
some emotion, 'and not merely because you are my son's friend and more
than friend.'The walls of the dining-room were covered with pictures of great merit,
all of the modern English school.Millbank understood no other, he
was wont to say!and he found that many of his friends who did, bought
a great many pleasing pictures that were copies, and many originals that
were very displeasing.He loved a fine free landscape by Lee, that gave
him the broad plains, the green lanes, and running streams of his own
land; a group of animals by Landseer, as full of speech and sentiment as
if they were designed by Aesop; above all, he delighted in the household
humour and homely pathos of Wilkie.And if a higher tone of imagination
pleased him, he could gratify it without difficulty among his favourite
masters.He possessed some specimens of Etty worthy of Venice when
it was alive; he could muse amid the twilight ruins of ancient cities
raised by the magic pencil of Danby, or accompany a group of fair
Neapolitans to a festival by the genial aid of Uwins.Opposite Coningsby was a portrait, which had greatly attracted his
attention during the whole dinner.It represented a woman, young and of
a rare beauty.The costume was of that classical character prevalent in
this country before the general peace; a blue ribbon bound together as
a fillet her clustering chestnut curls.The face was looking out of the
canvas, and Coningsby never raised his eyes without catching its glance
of blended vivacity and tenderness.There are moments when our sensibility is affected by circumstances of
a trivial character.It seems a fantastic emotion, but the gaze of this
picture disturbed the serenity of Coningsby.He endeavoured sometimes to
avoid looking at it, but it irresistibly attracted him.More than once
during dinner he longed to inquire whom it represented; but it is a
delicate subject to ask questions about portraits, and he refrained.Still, when he was rising to leave the room, the impulse was
irresistible.Millbank, 'By whom is that portrait, sir?'The countenance of Millbank became disturbed; it was not an expression
of tender reminiscence that fell upon his features.On the contrary, the
expression was agitated, almost angry.that is by a country artist,' he said,' of whom you never heard,'
and moved away.They found Miss Millbank in the drawing-room; she was sitting at a round
table covered with working materials, apparently dressing a doll.'Nay,' thought Coningsby,'she must be too old for that.'He addressed her, and seated himself by her side.There were several
dolls on the table, but he discovered, on examination, that they were
pincushions; and elicited, with some difficulty, that they were making
for a fancy fair about to be held in aid of that excellent institution,
the Manchester Athenaeum.Then the father came up and said,

'My child, let us have some tea;' and she rose and seated herself at the
tea-table.Coningsby also quitted his seat, and surveyed the apartment.There were several musical instruments; among others, he observed a
guitar; not such an instrument as one buys in a music shop, but such an
one as tinkles at Seville, a genuine Spanish guitar.Coningsby repaired
to the tea-table.'I am glad that you are fond of music, Miss Millbank.''I hope after tea you will be so kind as to touch the guitar.'The tea-tray was removed; Coningsby was conversing with Mr.Millbank,
who was asking him questions about his son; what he thought of Oxford;
what he thought of Oriel; should himself have preferred Cambridge; but
had consulted a friend, an Oriel man, who had a great opinion of Oriel;
and Oswald's name had been entered some years back.He rather regretted
it now; but the thing was done.Coningsby, remembering the promise of
the guitar, turned round to claim its fulfilment, but the singer
had made her escape.Time elapsed, and no Miss Millbank reappeared.Coningsby looked at his watch; he had to go three miles to the train,
which started, as his friend of the previous night would phrase it, at
9.45.'I should be happy if you remained with us,' said Mr.Millbank; 'but as
you say it is out of your power, in this age of punctual travelling
a host is bound to speed the parting guest.You must make my adieux to Miss Millbank, and
accept my thanks for your great kindness.'Coningsby,' said his host, taking his hand, which he
retained for a moment, as if he would say more.John journeyed to the hallway.Then leaving it, he
repeated with a somewhat wandering air, and in a voice of emotion,
'Farewell, farewell, Mr.CHAPTER V.


Towards the end of the session of 1836, the hopes of the Conservative
party were again in the ascendant.The Tadpoles and the Tapers had
infused such enthusiasm into all the country attorneys, who, in their
turn, had so bedeviled the registration, that it was whispered in the
utmost confidence, but as a flagrant truth, that Reaction was at length
'a great fact.'All that was required was the opportunity; but as the
existing parliament was not two years old, and the government had an
excellent working majority, it seemed that the occasion could scarcely
be furnished.Under these circumstances, the backstairs politicians,
not content with having by their premature movements already seriously
damaged the career of their leader, to whom in public they pretended to
be devoted, began weaving again their old intrigues about the court, and
not without effect.It was said that the royal ear lent itself with no marked repugnance to
suggestions which might rid the sovereign of ministers, who, after all,
were the ministers not of his choice, but of his necessity.But William
IV., after two failures in a similar attempt, after his respective
embarrassing interviews with Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne, on their
return to office in 1832 and 1835, was resolved never to make another
move unless it were a checkmate.The king, therefore, listened and
smiled, and loved to talk to his favourites of his private feelings and
secret hopes; the first outraged, the second cherished; and a little of
these revelations of royalty was distilled to great personages, who
in their turn spoke hypothetically to their hangers-on of royal
dispositions, and possible contingencies, while the hangers-on and
go-betweens, in their turn, looked more than they expressed; took
county members by the button into a corner, and advised, as friends, the
representatives of boroughs to look sharply after the next registration.Lord Monmouth, who was never greater than in adversity, and whose
favourite excitement was to aim at the impossible, had never been more
resolved on a Dukedom than when the Reform Act deprived him of the
twelve votes which he had accumulated to attain that object.While
all his companions in discomfiture were bewailing their irretrievable
overthrow, Lord Monmouth became almost a convert to the measure, which
had furnished his devising and daring mind, palled with prosperity, and
satiated with a life of success, with an object, and the stimulating
enjoyment of a difficulty.He had early resolved to appropriate to himself a division of the county
in which his chief seat was situate; but what most interested him,
because it was most difficult, was the acquisition of one of the
new boroughs that was in his vicinity, and in which he possessed
considerable property.The borough, however, was a manufacturing town,
and returning only one member, it had hitherto sent up to Westminster a
radical shopkeeper, one Mr.Jawster Sharp, who had taken what is called
'a leading part' in the town on every 'crisis' that had occurred since
1830; one of those zealous patriots who had got up penny subscriptions
for gold cups to Lord Grey; cries for the bill, the whole bill, and
nothing but the bill; and public dinners where the victual was devoured
before grace was said; a worthy who makes speeches, passes resolutions,
votes addresses, goes up with deputations, has at all times the
necessary quantity of confidence in the necessary individual; confidence
in Lord Grey; confidence in Lord Durham; confidence in Lord Melbourne:
and can also, if necessary, give three cheers for the King, or three
groans for the Queen.But the days of the genus Jawster Sharp were over in this borough as
well as in many others.He had contrived in his lustre of agitation
to feather his nest pretty successfully; by which he had lost public
confidence and gained his private end.Three hungry Jawster Sharps,
his hopeful sons, had all become commissioners of one thing or another;
temporary appointments with interminable duties; a low-church son-in-law
found himself comfortably seated in a chancellor's living; and several
cousins and nephews were busy in the Excise.But Jawster Sharp himself
was as pure as Cato.He had always said he would never touch the public
money, and he had kept his word.It was an understood thing that Jawster
Sharp was never to show his face again on the hustings of Darlford; the
Liberal party was determined to be represented in future by a man of
station, substance, character, a true Reformer, but one who wanted
nothing for himself, and therefore might, if needful, get something for
them.They were looking out for such a man, but were in no hurry.The
seat was looked upon as a good thing; a contest certainly, every place
is contested now, but as certainly a large majority.Notwithstanding
all this confidence, however, Reaction or Registration, or some other
mystification, had produced effects even in this creature of the Reform
Bill, the good Borough of Darlford.The borough that out of gratitude
to Lord Grey returned a jobbing shopkeeper twice to Parliament as its
representative without a contest, had now a Conservative Association,
with a banker for its chairman, and a brewer for its vice-president, and
four sharp lawyers nibbing their pens, noting their memorandum-books,
and assuring their neighbours, with a consoling and complacent air, that
'Property must tell in the long run.'Whispers also were about, that
when the proper time arrived, a Conservative candidate would certainly
have the honour of addressing the electors.No name mentioned, but it
was not concealed that he was to be of no ordinary calibre; a tried man,
a distinguished individual, who had already fought the battle of the
constitution, and served his country in eminent posts; honoured by
the nation, favoured by his sovereign.These important and encouraging
intimations were ably diffused in the columns of the Conservative
journal, and in a style which, from its high tone, evidently
indicated no ordinary source and no common pen.Indeed, there appeared
occasionally in this paper, articles written with such unusual vigour,
that the proprietors of the Liberal journal almost felt the necessity
of getting some eminent hand down from town to compete with them.It was
impossible that they could emanate from the rival Editor.They knew well
the length of their brother's tether.Had they been more versant in the
periodical literature of the day, they might in this'slashing' style
have caught perhaps a glimpse of the future candidate for their borough,
the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby.Lord Monmouth, though he had been absent from England since 1832, had
obtained from his vigilant correspondent a current knowledge of all that
had occurred in the interval: all the hopes, fears, plans, prospects,
manoeuvres, and machinations; their rise and fall; how some had bloomed,
others were blighted; not a shade of reaction that was not represented
to him; not the possibility of an adhesion that was not duly reported;
he could calculate at Naples at any time, within ten, the result of a
dissolution.The season of the year had prevented him crossing the Alps
in 1834, and after the general election he was too shrewd a practiser
in the political world to be deceived as to the ultimate result.Lord
Eskdale, in whose judgment he had more confidence than in that of any
individual, had told him from the first that the pear was not ripe;
Rigby, who always hedged against his interest by the fulfilment of his
prophecy of irremediable discomfiture, was never very sanguine.Indeed,
the whole affair was always considered premature by the good judges;
and a long time elapsed before Tadpole and Taper recovered their secret
influence, or resumed their ostentatious loquacity, or their silent
insolence.Even Lord Eskdale wrote that after
the forthcoming registration a bet was safe, and Lord Monmouth had the
satisfaction of drawing the Whig Minister at Naples into a cool thousand
on the event.Soon after this he returned to England, and determined
to pay a visit to Coningsby Castle, feast the county, patronise the
borough, diffuse that confidence in the party which his presence never
failed to do; so great and so just was the reliance in his unerring
powers of calculation and his intrepid pluck.Notwithstanding Schedule
A, the prestige of his power had not sensibly diminished, for his
essential resources were vast, and his intellect always made the most of
his influence.True, however, to his organisation, Lord Monmouth, even to save his
party and gain his dukedom, must not be bored.He, therefore, filled his
castle with the most agreeable people from London, and even secured for
their diversion a little troop of French comedians.Thus supported, he
received his neighbours with all the splendour befitting his immense
wealth and great position, and with one charm which even immense wealth
and great position cannot command, the most perfect manner in the world.Indeed, Lord Monmouth was one of the most finished gentlemen that
ever lived; and as he was good-natured, and for a selfish man even
good-humoured, there was rarely a cloud of caprice or ill-temper to
prevent his fine manners having their fair play.The country neighbours
were all fascinated; they were received with so much dignity and
dismissed with so much grace.Nobody would believe a word of the stories
against him.Had he lived all his life at Coningsby, fulfilled every
duty of a great English nobleman, benefited the county, loaded the
inhabitants with favours, he would not have been half so popular as he
found himself within a fortnight of his arrival with the worst county
reputation conceivable, and every little squire vowing that he would not
even leave his name at the Castle to show his respect.Lord Monmouth, whose contempt for mankind was absolute; not a
fluctuating sentiment, not a mournful conviction, ebbing and flowing
with circumstances, but a fixed, profound, unalterable instinct; who
never loved any one, and never hated any one except his own children;
was diverted by his popularity, but he was also gratified by it.At
this moment it was a great element of power; he was proud that, with a
vicious character, after having treated these people with unprecedented
neglect and contumely, he should have won back their golden opinions
in a moment by the magic of manner and the splendour of wealth.His
experience proved the soundness of his philosophy.Lord Monmouth worshipped gold, though, if necessary, he could squander
it like a caliph.He had even a respect for very rich men; it was his
only weakness, the only exception to his general scorn for his species.Wit, power, particular friendships, general popularity, public opinion,
beauty, genius, virtue, all these are to be purchased; but it does not
follow that you can buy a rich man: you may not be able or willing to
spare enough.A person or a thing that you perhaps could not buy, became
invested, in the eyes of Lord Monmouth, with a kind of halo amounting
almost to sanctity.As the prey rose to the bait, Lord Monmouth resolved they should be
gorged.His banquets were doubled; a ball was announced; a public
day fixed; not only the county, but the principal inhabitants of the
neighbouring borough, were encouraged to attend; Lord Monmouth wished
it, if possible, to be without distinction of party.He had come to
reside among his old friends, to live and die where he was born.The Chairman of the Conservative Association and the Vice President
exchanged glances, which would have become Tadpole and Taper; the
four attorneys nibbed their pens with increased energy, and vowed that
nothing could withstand the influence of the aristocracy 'in the long
run.'All went and dined at the Castle; all returned home overpowered
by the condescension of the host, the beauty of the ladies, several real
Princesses, the splendour of his liveries, the variety of his viands,
and the flavour of his wines.It was agreed that at future meetings of
the Conservative Association, they should always give 'Lord Monmouth
and the House of Lords!'superseding the Duke of Wellington, who was to
figure in an after-toast with the Battle of Waterloo.It was not without emotion that Coningsby beheld for the first time the
castle that bore his name.It was visible for several miles before he
even entered the park, so proud and prominent was its position, on the
richly-wooded steep of a considerable eminence.It was a castellated
building, immense and magnificent, in a faulty and incongruous style
of architecture, indeed, but compensating in some degree for these
deficiencies of external taste and beauty by the splendour and
accommodation of its exterior, and which a Gothic castle, raised
according to the strict rules of art, could scarcely have afforded.The
declining sun threw over the pile a rich colour as Coningsby approached
it, and lit up with fleeting and fanciful tints the delicate foliage of
the rare shrubs and tall thin trees that clothed the acclivity on which
it stood.Our young friend felt a little embarrassed when, without a
servant and in a hack chaise, he drew up to the grand portal, and
a crowd of retainers came forth to receive him.A superior servant
inquired his name with a stately composure that disdained to be
supercilious.It was not without some degree of pride and satisfaction
that the guest replied, 'Mr.It seemed to Coningsby that he was borne on the shoulders
of the people to his apartment; each tried to carry some part of his
luggage; and he only hoped his welcome from their superiors might be as
hearty.It appeared to Coningsby in his way to his room, that the Castle was in
a state of great excitement; everywhere bustle, preparation, moving to
and fro, ascending and descending of stairs, servants in every
corner; orders boundlessly given, rapidly obeyed; many desires, equal
gratification.It was quite unlike
Beaumanoir.That also was a palace, but it was a home.This, though it
should be one to him, seemed to have nothing of that character.Of
all mysteries the social mysteries are the most appalling.Going to
an assembly for the first time is more alarming than the first battle.Coningsby had never before been in a great house full of company.The sight of the servants bewildered him;
how then was he to encounter their masters?That, however, he must do in a moment.A groom of the chambers indicates
the way to him, as he proceeds with a hesitating yet hurried step
through several ante-chambers and drawing-rooms; then doors are suddenly
thrown open, and he is ushered into the largest and most sumptuous
saloon that he had ever entered.Coningsby for the first time in his life was at a great party.His
immediate emotion was to sink into the earth; but perceiving that no
one even noticed him, and that not an eye had been attracted to his
entrance, he regained his breath and in some degree his composure, and
standing aside, endeavoured to make himself, as well as he could, master
of the land.Not a human being that he had ever seen before!The circumstance of not
being noticed, which a few minutes since he had felt as a relief, became
now a cause of annoyance.It seemed that he was the only person standing
alone whom no one was addressing.He felt renewed and aggravated
embarrassment, and fancied, perhaps was conscious, that he was blushing.At length his ear caught the voice of Mr.The speaker was not
visible; he was at a distance surrounded by a wondering group, whom he
was severally and collectively contradicting, but Coningsby could not
mistake those harsh, arrogant tones.Coningsby never loved him particularly, which
was rather ungrateful, for he was a person who had been kind, and, on
the whole, serviceable to him; but Coningsby writhed, especially as he
grew older, under Mr.Rigby's patronising air and paternal tone.Even in
old days, though attentive, Coningsby had never found him affectionate.Rigby would tell him what to do and see, but never asked him what
he wished to do and see.It seemed to Coningsby that it was always
contrived that he should appear the _protege_, or poor relation, of a
dependent of his family.Rigby
had revived, caused our young friend, by an inevitable association of
ideas, to remember that, unknown and unnoticed as he might be, he was
the only Coningsby in that proud Castle, except the Lord of the Castle
himself; and he began to be rather ashamed of permitting a sense of his
inexperience in the mere forms and fashions of society so to oppress
him, and deprive him, as it were, of the spirit and carriage which
became alike his character and his position.Emboldened and greatly
restored to himself, Coningsby advanced into the body of the saloon.On his legs, wearing his blue ribbon and bending his head frequently
to a lady who was seated on a sofa, and continually addressed him,
Coningsby recognised his grandfather.Lord Monmouth was somewhat balder
than four years ago, when he had come down to Montem, and a little
more portly perhaps; but otherwise unchanged.Lord Monmouth
never condescended to the artifices of the toilet, and, indeed,
notwithstanding his life of excess, had little need of them.Nature had
done much for him, and the slow progress of decay was carried off by his
consummate bearing.He looked, indeed, the chieftain of a house of whom
a cadet might be proud.For Coningsby, not only the chief of his house, but his host too.In
either capacity he ought to address Lord Monmouth.To sit down to dinner
without having previously paid his respects to his grandfather, to whom
he was so much indebted, and whom he had not seen for so many years,
struck him not only as uncourtly, but as unkind and ungrateful, and,
indeed, in the highest degree absurd.Lord
Monmouth seemed deeply engaged, and apparently with some very great
lady.And if Coningsby advanced and bowed, in all probability he would
only get a bow in return.It had made a lasting impression on his mind.For it was more than
likely Lord Monmouth would not recognise him.Four years had not
sensibly altered Lord Monmouth, but four years had changed Harry
Coningsby from a schoolboy into a man.Then how was he to make himself
known to his grandfather?To announce himself as Coningsby, as his
Lordship's grandson, seemed somewhat ridiculous: to address his
grandfather as Lord Monmouth would serve no purpose: to style Lord
Monmouth 'grandfather' would make every one laugh, and seem stiff and
unnatural.To fall into an attitude and exclaim,
'Behold your grandchild!'Even to catch Lord Monmouth's glance was not an easy affair; he was
much occupied on one side by the great lady, on the other were several
gentlemen who occasionally joined in the conversation.There ran through Coningsby's character, as we have before mentioned, a
vein of simplicity which was not its least charm.It resulted, no doubt,
in a great degree from the earnestness of his nature.There never was a
boy so totally devoid of affectation, which was remarkable, for he had a
brilliant imagination, a quality that, from its fantasies, and the
vague and indefinite desires it engenders, generally makes those whose
characters are not formed, affected.The Duchess, who was a fine judge
of character, and who greatly regarded Coningsby, often mentioned this
trait as one which, combined with his great abilities and acquirements
so unusual at his age, rendered him very interesting.In the present
instance it happened that, while Coningsby was watching his grandfather,
he observed a gentleman advance, make his bow, say and receive a few
words and retire.This little incident, however, made a momentary
diversion in the immediate circle of Lord Monmouth, and before they
could all resume their former talk and fall into their previous
positions, an impulse sent forth Coningsby, who walked up to Lord
Monmouth, and standing before him, said,

'How do you do, grandpapa?'His comprehensive and penetrating
glance took in every point with a flash.There stood before him one of
the handsomest youths he had ever seen, with a mien as graceful as his
countenance was captivating; and his whole air breathing that freshness
and ingenuousness which none so much appreciates as the used man of the
world.And this was his child; the only one of his blood to whom he had
been kind.It would be exaggeration to say that Lord Monmouth's heart
was touched; but his goodnature effervesced, and his fine taste was
deeply gratified.He perceived in an instant such a relation might be
a valuable adherent; an irresistible candidate for future elections: a
brilliant tool to work out the Dukedom.All these impressions and ideas,
and many more, passed through the quick brain of Lord Monmouth ere the
sound of Coningsby's words had seemed to cease, and long before the
surrounding guests had recovered from the surprise which they had
occasioned them, and which did not diminish, when Lord Monmouth,
advancing, placed his arms round Coningsby with a dignity of affection
that would have become Louis XIV., and then, in the high manner of the
old Court, kissed him on each cheek.'Welcome to your home,' said Lord Monmouth.Then Lord Monmouth led the agitated Coningsby to the great lady, who was
a Princess and an Ambassadress, and then, placing his arm gracefully in
that of his grandson, he led him across the room, and presented him
in due form to some royal blood that was his guest, in the shape of
a Russian Grand-duke.His Imperial Highness received our hero as
graciously as the grandson of Lord Monmouth might expect; but no
greeting can be imagined warmer than the one he received from the lady
with whom the Grand-duke was conversing.She was a dame whose beauty was
mature, but still radiant.Her figure was superb; her dark hair crowned
with a tiara of curious workmanship.Her rounded arm was covered with
costly bracelets, but not a jewel on her finely formed bust, and the
least possible rouge on her still oval cheek.The party, though so considerable, principally consisted of the guests
at the Castle.The suite of the Grand-duke included several counts and
generals; then there were the Russian Ambassador and his lady; and a
Russian Prince and Princess, their relations.The Prince and Princess
Colonna and the Princess Lucretia were also paying a visit to the
Marquess; and the frequency of these visits made some straight-laced
magnificoes mysteriously declare it was impossible to go to Coningsby;
but as they were not asked, it did not much signify.The Marquess knew
a great many very agreeable people of the highest _ton_, who took a more
liberal view of human conduct, and always made it a rule to presume the
best motives instead of imputing the worst.Julians,
for example, whose position was of the highest; no one more sought; she
made it a rule to go everywhere and visit everybody, provided they had
power, wealth, and fashion.She knew no crime except a woman not
living with her husband; that was past pardon.So long as his presence
sanctioned her conduct, however shameless, it did not signify; but if
the husband were a brute, neglected his wife first, and then deserted
her; then, if a breath but sullies her name she must be crushed; unless,
indeed, her own family were very powerful, which makes a difference, and
sometimes softens immorality into indiscretion.Lord and Lady Gaverstock were also there, who never said an unkind thing
of anybody; her ladyship was pure as snow; but her mother having been
divorced, she ever fancied she was paying a kind of homage to her
parent, by visiting those who might some day be in the same predicament.There were other lords and ladies of high degree; and some who, though
neither lords nor ladies, were charming people, which Lord Monmouth
chiefly cared about; troops of fine gentlemen who came and went; and
some who were neither fine nor gentlemen, but who were very amusing
or very obliging, as circumstances required, and made life easy and
pleasant to others and themselves.A new scene this for Coningsby, who watched with interest all that
passed before him.The dinner was announced as served; an affectionate
arm guides him at a moment of some perplexity.Rigby, who spoke as if he had seen Coningsby for the first
time; but who indeed had, with that eye which nothing could escape,
observed his reception by his grandfather, marked it well, and inwardly
digested it.There was to be a first appearance on the stage of Lord Monmouth's
theatre to-night, the expectation of which created considerable interest
in the party, and was one of the principal subjects of conversation at
dinner.Villebecque, the manager of the troop, had married the actress
Stella, once celebrated for her genius and her beauty; a woman who had
none of the vices of her craft, for, though she was a fallen angel,
there were what her countrymen style extenuating circumstances in
her declension.With the whole world at her feet, she had remained
unsullied.Wealth and its enjoyments could not tempt her, although
she was unable to refuse her heart to one whom she deemed worthy of
possessing it.She found her fate in an Englishman, who was the father
of her only child, a daughter.She thought she had met in him a hero, a
demi-god, a being of deep passion and original and creative mind; but
he was only a voluptuary, full of violence instead of feeling, and
eccentric, because he had great means with which he could gratify
extravagant whims.Stella found she had made the great and irretrievable
mistake.She had exchanged devotion for a passionate and evanescent
fancy, prompted at first by vanity, and daily dissipating under the
influence of custom and new objects.Though not stainless in conduct,
Stella was pure in spirit.She required that devotion which she had
yielded; and she separated herself from the being to whom she had made
the most precious sacrifice.He offered her the consoling compensation
of a settlement, which she refused; and she returned with a broken
spirit to that profession of which she was still the ornament and the
pride.The animating principle of her career was her daughter, whom she
educated with a solicitude which the most virtuous mother could not
surpass.To preserve her from the stage, and to secure for her an
independence, were the objects of her mother's life; but nature
whispered to her, that the days of that life were already numbered.The exertions of her profession had alarmingly developed an inherent
tendency to pulmonary disease.Anxious that her child should not be left
without some protector, Stella yielded to the repeated solicitations
of one who from the first had been her silent admirer, and she married
Villebecque, a clever actor, and an enterprising man who meant to be
something more.Their union was not of long duration, though it was
happy on the side of Villebecque, and serene on that of his wife.Stella
was recalled from this world, where she had known much triumph and more
suffering; and where she had exercised many virtues, which elsewhere,
though not here, may perhaps be accepted as some palliation of one great
error.Villebecque acted becomingly to the young charge which Stella had
bequeathed to him.He was himself, as we have intimated, a man of
enterprise, a restless spirit, not content to move for ever in the
sphere in which he was born.Vicissitudes are the lot of such aspirants.Villebecque became manager of a small theatre, and made money.If
Villebecque without a sou had been a schemer, Villebecque with a small
capital was the very Chevalier Law of theatrical managers.He took a
larger theatre, and even that succeeded.Soon he was recognised as the
lessee of more than one, and still he prospered.Villebecque began to
dabble in opera-houses.He enthroned himself at Paris; his envoys
were heard of at Milan and Naples, at Berlin and St.His
controversies with the Conservatoire at Paris ranked among state papers.Villebecque rolled in chariots and drove cabriolets; Villebecque gave
refined suppers to great nobles, who were honoured by the invitation;
Villebecque wore a red ribbon in the button-hole of his frock, and more
than one cross in his gala dress.All this time the daughter of Stella increased in years and stature,
and we must add in goodness: a mild, soft-hearted girl, as yet with no
decided character, but one who loved calmness and seemed little fitted
for the circle in which she found herself.In that circle, however,
she ever experienced kindness and consideration.No enterprise however
hazardous, no management however complicated, no schemes however vast,
ever for a moment induced Villebecque to forget 'La Petite.'If only for
one breathless instant, hardly a day elapsed but he saw her; she was his
companion in all his rapid movements, and he studied every comfort and
convenience that could relieve her delicate frame in some degree from
the inconvenience and exhaustion of travel.He was proud to surround
her with luxury and refinement; to supply her with the most celebrated
masters; to gratify every wish that she could express.But all this time Villebecque was dancing on a volcano.The catastrophe
which inevitably occurs in the career of all great speculators, and
especially theatrical ones, arrived to him.Flushed with his prosperity,
and confident in his constant success, nothing would satisfy him
but universal empire.He had established his despotism at Paris, his
dynasties at Naples and at Milan; but the North was not to him, and
he was determined to appropriate it.Berlin fell before a successful
campaign, though a costly one; but St.Petersburg and London still
remained.Resolute and reckless, nothing deterred Villebecque.One
season all the opera-houses in Europe obeyed his nod, and at the end
of it he was ruined.The crash was utter, universal, overwhelming; and
under ordinary circumstances a French bed and a brasier of charcoal
alone remained for Villebecque, who was equal to the occasion.But
the thought of La Petite and the remembrance of his promise to Stella
deterred him from the deed.He reviewed his position in a spirit
becoming a practical philosopher.Was he worse off than before he
commenced his career?Yes, because he was older; though to be sure he
had his compensating reminiscences.At forty-five the game was not altogether up; and in a large theatre,
not too much lighted, and with the artifices of a dramatic toilet,
he might still be able successfully to reassume those characters of
coxcombs and muscadins, in which he was once so celebrated.Luxury had
perhaps a little too much enlarged his waist, but diet and rehearsals
would set all right.Villebecque in their adversity broke to La Petite, that the time had
unfortunately arrived when it would be wise for her to consider the most
effectual means for turning her talents and accomplishments to account.He himself suggested the stage, to which otherwise there were
doubtless objections, because her occupation in any other pursuit would
necessarily separate them; but he impartially placed before her the
relative advantages and disadvantages of every course which seemed to
lie open to them, and left the preferable one to her own decision.La
Petite, who had wept very much over Villebecque's misfortunes, and often
assured him that she cared for them only for his sake, decided for the
stage, solely because it would secure their not being parted; and yet,
as she often assured him, she feared she had no predisposition for the
career.Villebecque had now not only to fill his own parts at the theatre
at which he had obtained an engagement, but he had also to be the
instructor of his ward.It was a life of toil; an addition of labour
and effort that need scarcely have been made to the exciting exertion
of performance, and the dull exercise of rehearsal; but he bore it all
without a murmur; with a self-command and a gentle perseverance which
the finest temper in the world could hardly account for; certainly not
when we remember that its possessor, who had to make all these exertions
and endure all this wearisome toil, had just experienced the most
shattering vicissitudes of fortune, and been hurled from the possession
of absolute power and illimitable self-gratification.Lord Eskdale, who was always doing kind things to actors and actresses,
had a great regard for Villebecque, with whom he had often supped.He
had often been kind, too, to La Petite.Lord Eskdale had a plan for
putting Villebecque, as he termed it, 'on his legs again.'It was to
establish him with a French Company in London at some pretty theatre;
Lord Eskdale to take a private box and to make all his friends do the
same.Villebecque, who was as sanguine as he was good-tempered, was
ravished by this friendly scheme.He immediately believed that he should
recover his great fortunes as rapidly as he had lost them.He foresaw in
La Petite a genius as distinguished as that of her mother, although as
yet not developed, and he was boundless in his expressions of gratitude
to his patron.And indeed of all friends, a friend in need is the most
delightful.Lord Eskdale had the talent of being a friend in need.Perhaps it was because he knew so many worthless persons.But it often
happens that worthless persons are merely people who are worth nothing.Rigby of his intention to reside for
some months at Coningsby, and having mentioned that he wished a troop of
French comedians to be engaged for the summer, Mr.Rigby had immediately
consulted Lord Eskdale on the subject, as the best current authority.Thinking this a good opportunity of giving a turn to poor Villebecque,
and that it might serve as a capital introduction to their scheme of the
London company, Lord Eskdale obtained for him the engagement.Villebecque and his little troop had now been a month at Coningsby, and
had hitherto performed three times a-week.Lord Monmouth was content;
his guests much gratified; the company, on the whole, much approved
of.It was, indeed, considering its limited numbers, a capital company.There was a young lady who played the old woman's parts, nothing
could be more garrulous and venerable; and a lady of maturer years who
performed the heroines, gay and graceful as May.Villebecque himself was
a celebrity in characters of airy insolence and careless frolic.Their
old man, indeed, was rather hard, but handy; could take anything either
in the high serious, or the low droll.Their sentimental lover was
rather too much bewigged, and spoke too much to the audience, a fault
rare with the French; but this hero had a vague idea that he was
ultimately destined to run off with a princess.In this wise, affairs had gone on for a month; very well, but not too
well.The enterprising genius of Villebecque, once more a manager,
prompted him to action.He felt an itching desire to announce a novelty.He fancied Lord Monmouth had yawned once or twice when the heroine came
on.Villebecque wanted to make a _coup._ It was clear that La Petite
must sooner or later begin.Could she find a more favourable audience,
or a more fitting occasion, than were now offered?True it was she had
a great repugnance to come out; but it certainly seemed more to her
advantage that she should make her first appearance at a private theatre
than at a public one; supported by all the encouraging patronage of
Coningsby Castle, than subjected to all the cynical criticism of the
stalls of St.These views and various considerations were urged and represented by
Villebecque to La Petite, with all the practised powers of plausibility
of which so much experience as a manager had made him master.La Petite
looked infinitely distressed, but yielded, as she ever did.And the
night of Coningsby's arrival at the Castle was to witness in its private
theatre the first appearance of MADEMOISELLE FLORA.The guests re-assembled in the great saloon before they repaired to the
theatre.A lady on the arm of the Russian Prince bestowed on Coningsby
a haughty, but not ungracious bow; which he returned, unconscious of
the person to whom he bent.She was, however, a striking person; not
beautiful, her face, indeed, at the first glance was almost repulsive,
yet it ever attracted a second gaze.A remarkable pallor distinguished
her; her features had neither regularity nor expression; neither were
her eyes fine; but her brow impressed you with an idea of power of no
ordinary character or capacity.Her figure was as fine and commanding as
her face was void of charm.Juno, in the full bloom of her immortality,
could have presented nothing more majestic.Coningsby watched her as she
swept along like a resistless Fate.Servants now went round and presented to each of the guests a billet
of the performance.It announced in striking characters the _debut_ of
Mademoiselle Flora.A principal servant, bearing branch lights, came
forward and bowed to the Marquess.Lord Monmouth went immediately to the
Grand-duke, and notified to his Imperial Highness that the comedy was
ready.The Grand-duke offered his arm to the Ambassadress; the rest were
following; Coningsby was called; Madame Colonna wished him to be her
beau.It was a pretty theatre; had been rapidly rubbed up and renovated here
and there; the painting just touched; a little gilding on a cornice.There were no boxes, but the ground-floor, which gradually ascended, was
carpeted and covered with arm-chairs, and the back of the theatre with a
new and rich curtain of green velvet.They are all seated; a great artist performs on the violin, accompanied
by another great artist on the piano.The lights rise; somebody
evidently crosses the stage behind the curtain.'She is so
anxious to resume her acquaintance with you.'But before he could answer the bell rang, and the curtain rose.The old man, who had a droll part to-night, came forward and maintained
a conversation with his housekeeper; not bad.The young woman who played
the grave matron performed with great finish.She was a favourite,
and was ever applauded.The second scene came; a saloon tastefully
furnished; a table with flowers, arranged with grace; birds in cages, a
lap-dog on a cushion; some books.The audience were pleased; especially
the ladies; they like to recognise signs of _bon ton_ in the details of
the scene.A rather awful pause, and Mademoiselle Flora enters.She was
greeted with even vehement approbation.Her agitation is extreme;
she curtseys and bows her head, as if to hide her face.The face was
pleasing, and pretty enough, soft and engaging.Nothing could be more perfect than her costume; purely
white, but the fashion consummate; a single rose her only ornament.All
admitted that her hair was arranged to admiration.At length she spoke; her voice trembled, but she had a good elocution,
though her organ wanted force.The gentlemen looked at each other, and
nodded approbation.There was something so unobtrusive in her mien,
that she instantly became a favourite with the ladies.The scene was not
long, but it was successful.Flora did not appear in the next scene.In the fourth and final one
of the act, she had to make a grand display.It was a love-scene, and
rather of an impassioned character; Villebecque was her suitor.Never had he looked so well, or performed
with more spirit.You would not have given him five-and-twenty years; he
seemed redolent of youth.He had studied
the most distinguished of his audience for the occasion, and had
outdone them all.The fact is, he had been assisted a little by a great
connoisseur, a celebrated French nobleman, Count D'O----y, who had been
one of the guests.The thing was perfect; and Lord Monmouth took a pinch
of snuff, and tapped approbation on the top of his box.Flora now re-appeared, received with renewed approbation.It did not
seem, however, that in the interval she had gained courage; she looked
agitated.She spoke, she proceeded with her part; it became impassioned.She had to speak of her feelings; to tell the secrets of her heart; to
confess that she loved another; her emotion was exquisitely performed,
the mournful tenderness of her tones thrilling.There was, throughout
the audience, a dead silence; all were absorbed in their admiration of
the unrivalled artist; all felt a new genius had visited the stage; but
while they were fascinated by the actress, the woman was in torture.The
emotion was the disturbance of her own soul; the mournful tenderness of
her tones thrilled from the heart: suddenly she clasped her hands with
all the exhaustion of woe; an expression of agony flitted over her
countenance; and she burst into tears.Villebecque rushed forward, and
carried, rather than led, her from the stage; the audience looking at
each other, some of them suspecting that this movement was a part of the
scene.'She has talent,' said Lord Monmouth to the Russian Ambassadress,
'but wants practice.Villebecque should send her for a time to the
provinces.'At length M. Villebecque came forward to express his deep regret
that the sudden and severe indisposition of Mlle.Flora rendered it
impossible for the company to proceed with the piece; but that the
curtain would descend to rise again for the second and last piece
announced.The experienced performer who acted the
heroines now came forward and disported most jocundly.The failure of
Flora had given fresh animation to her perpetual liveliness.She seemed
the very soul of elegant frolic.In the last scene she figured in male
attire; and in air, fashion, and youth, beat Villebecque out of
the field.She looked younger than Coningsby when he went up to his
grandpapa.The comedy was over, the curtain fell; the audience, much amused,
chattered brilliant criticism, and quitted the theatre to repair to
the saloon, where they were to be diverted tonight with Russian dances.Nobody thought of the unhappy Flora; not a single message to console her
in her grief, to compliment her on what she had done, to encourage her
future.And yet it was a season for a word of kindness; so, at least,
thought one of the audience, as he lingered behind the hurrying crowd,
absorbed in their coming amusements.Coningsby had sat very near the stage; he had observed, with great
advantage and attention, the countenance and movements of Flora from the
beginning.He was fully persuaded that her woe was genuine and profound.He had felt his eyes moist when she wept.He recoiled from the cruelty
and the callousness that, without the slightest symptom of sympathy,
could leave a young girl who had been labouring for their amusement, and
who was suffering for her trial.He got on the stage, ran behind the scenes, and asked for Mlle.They pointed to a door; he requested permission to enter.Flora was
sitting at a table, with her face resting on her hands.Villebecque was
there, resting on the edge of the tall fender, and still in the dress in
which he had performed in the last piece.'I took the liberty,' said Coningsby, 'of inquiring after Mlle.Flora;'
and then advancing to her, who had raised her head, he added, 'I am sure
my grandfather must feel much indebted to you, Mademoiselle, for making
such exertions when you were suffering under so much indisposition.''This is very amiable of you, sir,' said the young lady, looking at him
with earnestness.'Mademoiselle has too much sensibility,' said Villebecque, making an
observation by way of diversion.'And yet that must be the soul of fine acting,' said Coningsby; 'I look
forward, all look forward, with great interest to the next occasion on
which you will favour us.'said La Petite, in a plaintive tone; 'oh, I hope, never!''Mademoiselle is not aware at this moment,' said Coningsby, 'how much
her talent is appreciated.I assure you, sir,' he added, turning
to Villebecque, 'I heard but one opinion, but one expression of
gratification at her feeling and her fine taste.''The talent is hereditary,' said Villebecque.'Indeed you have reason to say so,' said Coningsby.'Pardon; I was not thinking of myself.My child reminded me so much of
another this evening.I am glad you are here, sir,
to reassure Mademoiselle.''I came only to congratulate her, and to lament, for our sakes as well
as her own, her indisposition.''It is not indisposition,' said La Petite, in a low tone, with her eyes
cast down.'Mademoiselle cannot overcome the nervousness incidental to a first
appearance,' said Villebecque.'A last appearance,' said La Petite: 'yes, it must be the last.'She
rose gently, she approached Villebecque, she laid her head on his
breast, and placed her arms round his neck, 'My father, my best father,
yes, say it is the last.''You are the mistress of your lot, Flora,' said Villebecque; 'but with
such a distinguished talent--'

'No, no, no; no talent.I am
not of those to whom nature gives talents.The convent is more suited to
me than the stage.''But you hear what this gentleman says,' said Villebecque, returning
her embrace.'He tells you that his grandfather, my Lord Marquess, I
believe, sir, that every one, that--'

'Oh, no, no, no!''He comes here because
he is generous, because he is a gentleman; and he wished to soothe the
soul that he knew was suffering.Thank him, my father, thank him for
me and before me, and promise in his presence that the stage and your
daughter have parted for ever.''Nay, Mademoiselle,' said Coningsby, advancing and venturing to take her
hand, a soft hand,'make no such resolutions to-night.M. Villebecque
can have no other thought or object but your happiness; and, believe me,
'tis not I only, but all, who appreciate, and, if they were here, must
respect you.''I prefer respect to admiration,' said Flora; 'but I fear that respect
is not the appanage of such as I am.''All must respect those who respect themselves,' said Coningsby.'Adieu,
Mademoiselle; I trust to-morrow to hear that you are yourself.'He bowed
to Villebecque and retired.In the meantime affairs in the drawing-room assumed a very different
character from those behind the scenes.Coningsby returned to
brilliancy, groups apparently gushing with light-heartedness, universal
content, and Russian dances!'And you too, do you dance the Russian dances, Mr.'I cannot dance at all,' said Coningsby, beginning a little to lose his
pride in the want of an accomplishment which at Eton he had thought it
spirited to despise.Lucretia shall teach you,'
said the Princess; 'nothing will please her so much.'On the present occasion the ladies were not so experienced in the
entertainment as the gentlemen; but there was amusement in being
instructed.To be disciplined by a Grand-duke or a Russian Princess
was all very well; but what even good-tempered Lady Gaythorp could not
pardon was, that a certain Mrs.Guy Flouncey, whom they were all of them
trying to put down and to keep down, on this, as almost on every
other occasion, proved herself a more finished performer than even the
Russians themselves.Lord Monmouth had picked up the Guy Flounceys during a Roman winter.Guy Flouncey was a man
of good estate, a sportsman, proud of his pretty wife.Guy Flouncey
was even very pretty, dressed in a style of ultra fashion.However, she
could sing, dance, act, ride, and talk, and all well; and was mistress
of the art of flirtation.She had amused the Marquess abroad, and had
taken care to call at Monmouth House the instant the _Morning Post_
apprised her he had arrived in England; the consequence was an
invitation to Coningsby.She came with a wardrobe which, in point of
variety, fancy, and fashion, never was surpassed.Morning and evening,
every day a new dress equally striking; and a riding habit that was the
talk and wonder of the whole neighbourhood.Guy Flouncey created
far more sensation in the borough when she rode down the High Street,
than what the good people called the real Princesses.At first the fine ladies never noticed her, or only stared at her over
their shoulders; everywhere sounded, in suppressed whispers, the fatal
question, 'Who is she?'After dinner they formed always into polite
groups, from which Mrs.Guy Flouncey was invariably excluded; and if
ever the Princess Colonna, impelled partly by goodnature, and partly
from having known her on the Continent, did kindly sit by her, Lady St.Julians, or some dame equally benevolent, was sure, by an adroit appeal
to Her Highness on some point which could not be decided without moving,
to withdraw her from her pretty and persecuted companion.It was, indeed, rather difficult work the first few days for Mrs.Guy
Flouncey, especially immediately after dinner.It is not soothing to
one's self-love to find oneself sitting alone, pretending to look at
prints, in a fine drawing-room, full of fine people who don't speak
to you.Guy Flouncey, after having taken Coningsby Castle by
storm, was not to be driven out of its drawing-room by the tactics
even of a Lady St.Experience convinced her that all that was
required was a little patience.Guy had confidence in herself, her
quickness, her ever ready accomplishments, and her practised powers of
attraction.She was always sure of an ally the moment
the gentlemen appeared.The cavalier who had sat next to her at dinner
was only too happy to meet her again.More than once, too, she had
caught her noble host, though a whole garrison was ever on the watch to
prevent her, and he was greatly amused, and showed that he was greatly
amused by her society.Then she suggested plans to him to divert his
guests.In a country-house the suggestive mind is inestimable.Somehow
or other, before a week passed, Mrs.Guy Flouncey seemed the soul of
everything, was always surrounded by a cluster of admirers, and with
what are called 'the best men' ever ready to ride with her, dance
with her, act with her, or fall at her feet.The fine ladies found it
absolutely necessary to thaw: they began to ask her questions after
dinner.She was an adroit
flatterer, with a temper imperturbable, and gifted with a ceaseless
energy of conferring slight obligations.She lent them patterns for new
fashions, in all which mysteries she was very versant; and what with
some gentle glozing and some gay gossip, sugar for their tongues and
salt for their tails, she contrived pretty well to catch them all.Nothing could present a greater contrast than the respective interiors
of Coningsby and Beaumanoir.That air of habitual habitation, which so
pleasingly distinguished the Duke's family seat, was entirely wanting
at Coningsby.Everything, indeed, was vast and splendid; but it seemed
rather a gala-house than a dwelling; as if the grand furniture and
the grand servants had all come down express from town with the grand
company, and were to disappear and to be dispersed at the same time.And
truly there were manifold traces of hasty and temporary arrangement;
new carpets and old hangings; old paint, new gilding; battalions of odd
French chairs, squadrons of queer English tables; and large tasteless
lamps and tawdry chandeliers, evidently true cockneys, and only taking
the air by way of change.There was, too, throughout the drawing-rooms
an absence of all those minor articles of ornamental furniture that are
the offering of taste to the home we love.There were no books neither;
few flowers; no pet animals; no portfolios of fine drawings by our
English artists like the album of the Duchess, full of sketches by
Landseer and Stanfield, and their gifted brethren; not a print even,
except portfolios of H.The modes and manners of the
house were not rural; there was nothing of the sweet order of a country
life.Nobody came down to breakfast; the ladies were scarcely seen
until dinner-time; they rolled about in carriages together late in the
afternoon as if they were in London, or led a sort of factitious boudoir
life in their provincial dressing-rooms.The Marquess sent for Coningsby the morning after his arrival and asked
him to breakfast with him in his private rooms.Nothing could be
more kind or more agreeable than his grandfather.He appeared to be
interested in his grandson's progress, was glad to find Coningsby had
distinguished himself at Eton, solemnly adjured him not to neglect his
French.A classical education, he said, was a very admirable thing, and
one which all gentlemen should enjoy; but Coningsby would find some day
that there were two educations, one which his position required, and
another which was demanded by the world.'French, my dear Harry,' he
continued, 'is the key to this second education.In a couple of years
or so you will enter the world; it is a different thing to what you read
about.It is a masquerade; a motley, sparkling multitude, in which
you may mark all forms and colours, and listen to all sentiments and
opinions; but where all you see and hear has only one object, plunder.When you get into this crowd you will find that Greek and Latin are not
so much diffused as you imagine.I was glad to hear you speaking French
yesterday.There are a good many foreigners here with
whom you may try your wing a little; don't talk to any of them too
much.All the people here are good
acquaintance; at least pretty well.Now, here,' said the Marquess,
taking up a letter and then throwing it on the table again, 'now here is
a man whom I should like you to know, Sidonia.He will be here in a few
days.Lay yourself out for him if you have the opportunity.He is a
man of rare capacity, and enormously rich.No one knows the world like
Sidonia.I never met his equal; and 'tis so pleasant to talk with one
that can want nothing of you.'Lord Monmouth had invited Coningsby to take a drive with him in the
afternoon.The Marquess wished to show a part of his domain to the
Ambassadress.Only Lucretia, he said, would be with them, and there was
a place for him.This invitation was readily accepted by Coningsby, who
was not yet sufficiently established in the habits of the house exactly
to know how to pass his morning.Rigby, was
entirely taken up with the Grand-duke, whom he was accompanying all
over the neighbourhood, in visits to manufactures, many of which Rigby
himself saw for the first time, but all of which he fluently explained
to his Imperial Highness.In return for this, he extracted much
information from the Grand-duke on Russian plans and projects, materials
for a'slashing' article against the Russophobia that he was preparing,
and in which he was to prove that Muscovite aggression was an English
interest, and entirely to be explained by the want of sea-coast, which
drove the Czar, for the pure purposes of commerce, to the Baltic and the
Euxine.When the hour for the drive arrived, Coningsby found Lucretia, a young
girl when he had first seen her only four years back, and still his
junior, in that majestic dame who had conceded a superb recognition to
him the preceding eve.She really looked older than Madame Colonna; who,
very beautiful, very young-looking, and mistress of the real arts of
the toilet, those that cannot be detected, was not in the least altered
since she first so cordially saluted Coningsby as her dear young friend
at Monmouth House.The day was delightful, the park extensive and picturesque, the
Ambassadress sparkling with anecdote, and occasionally, in a low voice,
breathing a diplomatic hint to Lord Monmouth, who bowed his graceful
consciousness of her distinguished confidence.Coningsby occasionally
took advantage of one of those moments, when the conversation ceased to
be general, to address Lucretia, who replied in calm, fine smiles, and
in affable monosyllables.She indeed generally succeeded in conveying an
impression to those she addressed, that she had never seen them before,
did not care to see them now, and never wished to see them again.And
all this, too, with an air of great courtesy.They arrived at the brink of a wooded bank; at their feet flowed a
fine river, deep and rushing, though not broad; its opposite bank the
boundary of a richly-timbered park.'And is that yours,
Lord Monmouth?''That is Hellingsley; it is one of the
finest places in the county, with a splendid estate; not so considerable
as Coningsby, but very great.It belongs to an old, a very old man,
without a relative in the world.It is known that the estate will be
sold at his death, which may be almost daily expected.No one can offer for it what I can afford.For it gives me this division
of the county, Princess.To possess Hellingsley is one of my objects.'The Marquess spoke with an animation unusual with him, almost with a
degree of excitement.The wind met them as they returned, the breeze blew rather freshly.Lucretia all of a sudden seemed touched with unusual emotion.She was
alarmed lest Lord Monmouth should catch cold; she took a kerchief from
her own well-turned throat to tie round his neck.He feebly resisted,
evidently much pleased.In the evening, having
refused several distinguished guests, but instantly yielding to the
request of Lord Monmouth, she sang.It was impossible to conceive a
contralto of more thrilling power, or an execution more worthy of the
voice.Coningsby, who was not experienced in fine singing, listened as
if to a supernatural lay, but all agreed it was of the highest class of
nature and of art; and the Grand-duke was in raptures.Lucretia received
even his Highness' compliments with a graceful indifference.Indeed, to
those who watched her demeanour, it might be remarked that she seemed to
yield to none, although all bowed before her.Madame Colonna, who was always kind to Coningsby, expressed to him
her gratification from the party of the morning.It must have been
delightful, she assured Coningsby, for Lord Monmouth to have had both
Lucretia and his grandson with him; and Lucretia too, she added, must
have been so pleased.Coningsby could not make out why Madame Colonna was always intimating
to him that the Princess Lucretia took such great interest in his
existence, looked forward with such gratification to his society,
remembered with so much pleasure the past, anticipated so much happiness
from the future.It appeared to him that he was to Lucretia, if not an
object of repugnance, as he sometimes fancied, certainly one only of
absolute indifference; but he said nothing.He had already lived long
enough to know that it is unwise to wish everything explained.Every day, he found, added to
his acquaintance.He was never without a companion to ride or to shoot
with; and of riding Coningsby was very fond.His grandfather, too, was
continually giving him goodnatured turns, and making him of consequence
in the Castle: so that all the guests were fully impressed with the
importance of Lord Monmouth's grandson.Julians pronounced him
distinguished; the Ambassadress thought diplomacy should be his part,
as he had a fine person and a clear brain; Madame Colonna spoke of him
always as if she took intense interest in his career, and declared she
liked him almost as much as Lucretia did; the Russians persisted
in always styling him 'the young Marquess,' notwithstanding the
Ambassador's explanations; Mrs.Guy Flouncey made a dashing attack
on him; but Coningsby remembered a lesson which Lady Everingham had
graciously bestowed on him.Guy Flouncey laughed a little too much, and talked a
little too loud.As time flew on, there were changes of visitors, chiefly among the
single men.At the end of the first week after Coningsby's arrival, Lord
Eskdale appeared, bringing with him Lucian Gay; and soon after followed
the Marquess of Beaumanoir and Mr.These were all heroes who,
in their way, interested the ladies, and whose advent was hailed
with general satisfaction.Even Lucretia would relax a little to Lord
Eskdale.He was one of her oldest friends, and with a simplicity of
manner which amounted almost to plainness, and with rather a cynical
nonchalance in his carriage towards men, Lord Eskdale was invariably a
favourite with women.To be sure his station was eminent; he was noble,
and very rich, and very powerful, and these are qualities which tell as
much with the softer as the harsher sex; but there are individuals with
all these qualities who are nevertheless unpopular with women.Lord
Eskdale was easy, knew the world thoroughly, had no prejudices, and,
above all, had a reputation for success.A reputation for success has as
much influence with women as a reputation for wealth has with men.Both
reputations may be, and often are, unjust; but we see persons daily make
good fortunes by them all the same.Lord Eskdale was not an impostor;
and though he might not have been so successful a man had he not been
Lord Eskdale, still, thrown over by a revolution, he would have lighted
on his legs.The arrival of this nobleman was the occasion of giving a good turn to
poor Flora.He went immediately to see his friend Villebecque and his
troop.Indeed it was a sort of society which pleased Lord Eskdale more
than that which is deemed more refined.He was very sorry about 'La
Petite;' but thought that everything would come right in the long run;
and told Villebecque that he was glad to hear him well spoken of here,
especially by the Marquess, who seemed to take to him.As for Flora, he
was entirely against her attempting the stage again, at least for the
present, but as she was a good musician, he suggested to the Princess
Lucretia one night, that the subordinate aid of Flora might be of
service to her, and permit her to favour her friends with some pieces
which otherwise she must deny to them.This suggestion was successful;
Flora was introduced occasionally, soon often, to their parties in the
evening, and her performances were in every respect satisfactory.There
was nothing to excite the jealousy of Lucretia either in her style or
her person.And yet she sang well enough, and was a quiet, refined,
retiring, by no means disagreeable person.She was the companion of
Lucretia very often in the morning as well as in the illumined saloon;
for the Princess was devoted to the art in which she excelled.This
connexion on the whole contributed to the happiness of poor Flora.True
it was, in the evening she often found herself sitting or standing alone
and no one noticing her; she had no dazzling quality to attract men of
fashion, who themselves love to worship ever the fashionable.Even
their goddesses must be _a la mode_.But Coningsby never omitted an
opportunity to show Flora some kindness under these circumstances.He always came and talked to her, and praised her singing, and would
sometimes hand her refreshments and give her his arm if necessary.These
slight attentions coming from the grandson of Lord Monmouth were for
the world redoubled in their value, though Flora thought only of their
essential kindness; all in character with that first visit which dwelt
on the poor girl's memory, though it had long ago escaped that of her
visitor.For in truth Coningsby had no other impulse for his conduct but
kind-heartedness.Thus we have attempted to give some faint idea how life glided away at
the Castle the first fortnight that Coningsby passed there.Perhaps we
ought not to omit that Mrs.Guy Flouncey, to the infinite disgust of
Lady St.Julians, who had a daughter with her, successfully entrapped
the devoted attentions of the young Marquess of Beaumanoir, who was
never very backward if a lady would take trouble enough; while his
friend, Mr.Julians wished
her daughter ever particularly to shun, employed all his gaiety,
good-humour, frivolity, and fashion in amusing that young lady, and with
irresistible effect.For the rest, they continued, though they had only
partridges to shoot, to pass the morning without weariness.The weather
was fine; the stud numerous; all might be mounted.The Grand-duke and
his suite, guided by Mr.Rigby, had always some objects to visit, and
railroads returned them just in time for the banquet with an appetite
which they had earned, and during which Rigby recounted their
achievements, and his own opinions.The dinner was always firstrate; the evening never failed; music,
dancing, and the theatre offered great resources independently of the
soul-subduing sentiment harshly called flirtation, and which is the
spell of a country house.Lord Monmouth was satisfied, for he had
scarcely ever felt wearied.All that he required in life was to be
amused; perhaps that was not all he required, but it was indispensable.Nor was it wonderful that on the present occasion he obtained his
purpose, for there were half a hundred of the brightest eyes
and quickest brains ever on the watch or the whirl to secure him
distraction.The only circumstance that annoyed him was the non-arrival
of Sidonia.Lord Monmouth could not bear to be disappointed.He could
not refrain from saying, notwithstanding all the resources and all the
exertions of his guests,

'I cannot understand why Sidonia does not come.'So do I,' said Lord Eskdale; 'Sidonia is the only man who tells one
anything new.''We saw Sidonia at Lord Studcaster's,' said Lord Beaumanoir.'He told
Melton he was coming here.''You know he has bought all Studcaster's horses,' said Mr.'I wonder he does not buy Studcaster himself,' said Lord Monmouth; 'I
would if I were he; Sidonia can buy anything,' he turned to Mrs.'I wonder who Sidonia is,' thought Mrs.Guy Flouncey, but she was
determined no one should suppose she did not know.At length one day Coningsby met Madame Colonna in the vestibule before
dinner.'Milor is in such good temper, Mr.Coningsby,' she said; 'Monsieur de
Sidonia has arrived.'About ten minutes before dinner there was a stir in the chamber.He saw the Grand-duke advancing, and holding out
his hand in a manner the most gracious.A gentleman, of distinguished
air, but with his back turned to Coningsby, was bowing as he received
his Highness' greeting.Several
came forward: even the Marquess seemed a little moved.Coningsby could
not resist the impulse of curiosity to see this individual of whom he
had heard so much.He glided round the room, and caught the countenance
of his companion in the forest inn; he who announced to him, that 'the
Age of Ruins was past.'CHAPTER X.


Sidonia was descended from a very ancient and noble family of Arragon,
that, in the course of ages, had given to the state many distinguished
citizens.In the priesthood its members had been peculiarly eminent.Besides several prelates, they counted among their number an Archbishop
of Toledo; and a Sidonia, in a season of great danger and difficulty,
had exercised for a series of years the paramount office of Grand
Inquisitor.Yet, strange as it may sound, it is nevertheless a fact, of which there
is no lack of evidence, that this illustrious family during all this
period, in common with two-thirds of the Arragonese nobility, secretly
adhered to the ancient faith and ceremonies of their fathers; a belief
in the unity of the God of Sinai, and the rights and observances of the
laws of Moses.Whence came those Mosaic Arabs whose passages across the strait from
Africa to Europe long preceded the invasion of the Mohammedan Arabs, it
is now impossible to ascertain.Their traditions tell us that from time
immemorial they had sojourned in Africa; and it is not improbable that
they may have been the descendants of some of the earlier dispersions;
like those Hebrew colonies that we find in China, and who probably
emigrated from Persia in the days of the great monarchies.Whatever may
have been their origin in Africa, their fortunes in Southern Europe
are not difficult to trace, though the annals of no race in any age can
detail a history of such strange vicissitudes, or one rife with more
touching and romantic incident.Their unexampled prosperity in the
Spanish Peninsula, and especially in the south, where they had become
the principal cultivators of the soil, excited the jealousy of the
Goths; and the Councils of Toledo during the sixth and seventh
centuries attempted, by a series of decrees worthy of the barbarians who
promulgated them, to root the Jewish Arabs out of the land.There is no
doubt the Council of Toledo led, as directly as the lust of Roderick,
to the invasion of Spain by the Moslemin Arabs.The Jewish population,
suffering under the most sanguinary and atrocious persecution, looked to
their sympathising brethren of the Crescent, whose camps already gleamed
on the opposite shore.The overthrow of the Gothic kingdoms was as much
achieved by the superior information which the Saracens received from
their suffering kinsmen, as by the resistless valour of the Desert.The
Saracen kingdoms were established.That fair and unrivalled civilisation
arose which preserved for Europe arts and letters when Christendom was
plunged in darkness.The children of Ishmael rewarded the children of
Israel with equal rights and privileges with themselves.During these
halcyon centuries, it is difficult to distinguish the follower of Moses
from the votary of Mahomet.Both alike built palaces, gardens, and
fountains; filled equally the highest offices of the state, competed
in an extensive and enlightened commerce, and rivalled each other in
renowned universities.Even after the fall of the principal Moorish kingdoms, the Jews of
Spain were still treated by the conquering Goths with tenderness and
consideration.Their numbers, their wealth, the fact that, in Arragon
especially, they were the proprietors of the soil, and surrounded by
warlike and devoted followers, secured for them an usage which, for
a considerable period, made them little sensible of the change of
dynasties and religions.As the
Goths grew stronger, persecution became more bold.Where the Jewish
population was scanty they were deprived of their privileges, or obliged
to conform under the title of 'Nuevos Christianos.'At length the union
of the two crowns under Ferdinand and Isabella, and the fall of the
last Moorish kingdom, brought the crisis of their fate both to the New
Christian and the nonconforming Hebrew.The Inquisition appeared, the
Institution that had exterminated the Albigenses and had desolated
Languedoc, and which, it should ever be remembered, was established in
the Spanish kingdoms against the protests of the Cortes and amid the
terror of the populace.The Dominicans opened their first tribunal at
Seville, and it is curious that the first individuals they summoned
before them were the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the Marquess of Cadiz, and
the Count of Arcos; three of the most considerable personages in Spain.How many were burned alive at Seville during the first year, how many
imprisoned for life, what countless thousands were visited with severe
though lighter punishments, need not be recorded here.In nothing was
the Holy Office more happy than in multiform and subtle means by which
they tested the sincerity of the New Christians.At length the Inquisition was to be extended to Arragon.The
high-spirited nobles of that kingdom knew that its institution was for
them a matter of life or death.The Cortes of Arragon appealed to the
King and to the Pope; they organised an extensive conspiracy; the chief
Inquisitor was assassinated in the cathedral of Saragossa.it
was fated that in this, one of the many, and continual, and continuing
struggles between the rival organisations of the North and the South,
the children of the sun should fall.The fagot and the San Benito were
the doom of the nobles of Arragon.Those who were convicted of secret
Judaism, and this scarcely three centuries ago, were dragged to the
stake; the sons of the noblest houses, in whose veins the Hebrew taint
could be traced, had to walk in solemn procession, singing psalms, and
confessing their faith in the religion of the fell Torquemada.This triumph in Arragon, the almost simultaneous fall of the last
Moorish kingdom, raised the hopes of the pure Christians to the
highest pitch.Having purged the new Christians, they next turned their
attention to the old Hebrews.Ferdinand was resolved that the delicious
air of Spain should be breathed no longer by any one who did not profess
the Catholic faith.More than
six hundred thousand individuals, some authorities greatly increase
the amount, the most industrious, the most intelligent, and the most
enlightened of Spanish subjects, would not desert the religion of their
fathers.For this they gave up the delightful land wherein they
had lived for centuries, the beautiful cities they had raised, the
universities from which Christendom drew for ages its most precious
lore, the tombs of their ancestors, the temples where they had
worshipped the God for whom they had made this sacrifice.They had but
four months to prepare for eternal exile, after a residence of as many
centuries; during which brief period forced sales and glutted markets
virtually confiscated their property.It is a calamity that the
scattered nation still ranks with the desolations of Nebuchadnezzar
and of Titus.Who after this should say the Jews are by nature a sordid
people?But the Spanish Goth, then so cruel and so haughty, where is
he?A despised suppliant to the very race which he banished, for some
miserable portion of the treasure which their habits of industry have
again accumulated.Where is that tribunal that summoned Medina Sidonia
and Cadiz to its dark inquisition?Its fall, its
unparalleled and its irremediable fall, is mainly to be attributed
to the expulsion of that large portion of its subjects, the most
industrious and intelligent, who traced their origin to the Mosaic and
Mohammedan Arabs.John went to the bathroom.The Sidonias of Arragon were Nuevos Christianos.Some of them, no doubt,
were burned alive at the end of the fifteenth century, under the system
of Torquemada; many of them, doubtless, wore the San Benito; but they
kept their titles and estates, and in time reached those great offices
to which we have referred.During the long disorders of the Peninsular war, when so many openings
were offered to talent, and so many opportunities seized by the
adventurous, a cadet of a younger branch of this family made a large
fortune by military contracts, and supplying the commissariat of the
different armies.At the peace, prescient of the great financial future
of Europe, confident in the fertility of his own genius, in his original
views of fiscal subjects, and his knowledge of national resources, this
Sidonia, feeling that Madrid, or even Cadiz, could never be a base
on which the monetary transactions of the world could be regulated,
resolved to emigrate to England, with which he had, in the course of
years, formed considerable commercial connections.He arrived here after
the peace of Paris, with his large capital.He staked all he was
worth on the Waterloo loan; and the event made him one of the greatest
capitalists in Europe.No sooner was Sidonia established in England than he professed Judaism;
which Torquemada flattered himself, with the fagot and the San Benito,
he had drained out of the veins of his family more than three centuries
ago.He sent over, also, for several of his brothers, who were as
good Catholics in Spain as Ferdinand and Isabella could have possibly
desired, but who made an offering in the synagogue, in gratitude for
their safe voyage, on their arrival in England.Sidonia had foreseen in Spain that, after the exhaustion of a war of
twenty-five years, Europe must require capital to carry on peace.He
reaped the due reward of his sagacity.Europe did require money, and
Sidonia was ready to lend it to Europe.France wanted some; Austria
more; Prussia a little; Russia a few millions.The only country which he avoided was Spain; he was too well
acquainted with its resources.Nothing, too, would ever tempt him to
lend anything to the revolted colonies of Spain.Prudence saved him from
being a creditor of the mother-country; his Spanish pride recoiled from
the rebellion of her children.It is not difficult to conceive that, after having pursued the career we
have intimated for about ten years, Sidonia had become one of the most
considerable personages in Europe.He had established a brother, or
a near relative, in whom he could confide, in most of the principal
capitals.He was lord and master of the money-market of the world, and
of course virtually lord and master of everything else.He literally
held the revenues of Southern Italy in pawn; and monarchs and ministers
of all countries courted his advice and were guided by his suggestions.He was still in the vigour of life, and was not a mere money-making
machine.He had a general intelligence equal to his position, and looked
forward to the period when some relaxation from his vast enterprises and
exertions might enable him to direct his energies to great objects of
public benefit.But in the height of his vast prosperity he suddenly
died, leaving only one child, a youth still of tender years, and heir to
the greatest fortune in Europe, so great, indeed, that it could only be
calculated by millions.Shut out from universities and schools, those universities and schools
which were indebted for their first knowledge of ancient philosophy
to the learning and enterprise of his ancestors, the young Sidonia was
fortunate in the tutor whom his father had procured for him, and who
devoted to his charge all the resources of his trained intellect and
vast and varied erudition.A Jesuit before the revolution; since then an
exiled Liberal leader; now a member of the Spanish Cortes; Rebello
was always a Jew.He found in his pupil that precocity of intellectual
development which is characteristic of the Arabian organisation.The
young Sidonia penetrated the highest mysteries of mathematics with
a facility almost instinctive; while a memory, which never had any
twilight hours, but always reflected a noontide clearness, seemed to
magnify his acquisitions of ancient learning by the promptness with
which they could be reproduced and applied.The circumstances of his position, too, had early contributed to give
him an unusual command over the modern languages.An Englishman, and
taught from his cradle to be proud of being an Englishman, he first
evinced in speaking his native language those remarkable powers of
expression, and that clear and happy elocution, which ever afterwards
distinguished him.But the son of a Spaniard, the sonorous syllables
of that noble tongue constantly resounded in his ear; while the foreign
guests who thronged his father's mansion habituated him from an early
period of life to the tones of languages that were not long strange to
him.When he was nineteen, Sidonia, who had then resided some time
with his uncle at Naples, and had made a long visit to another of his
father's relatives at Frankfort, possessed a complete mastery over the
principal European languages.At seventeen he had parted with Rebello, who returned to Spain, and
Sidonia, under the control of his guardians, commenced his travels.He
resided, as we have mentioned, some time in Germany, and then, having
visited Italy, settled at Naples, at which city it may be said he
made his entrance into life.With an interesting person, and highly
accomplished, he availed himself of the gracious attentions of a
court of which he was principal creditor; and which, treating him as a
distinguished English traveller, were enabled perhaps to show him some
favours that the manners of the country might not have permitted them
to accord to his Neapolitan relatives.Sidonia thus obtained at an
early age that experience of refined and luxurious society, which is a
necessary part of a finished education.It gives the last polish to the
manners; it teaches us something of the power of the passions, early
developed in the hot-bed of self-indulgence; it instils into us that
indefinable tact seldom obtained in later life, which prevents us from
saying the wrong thing, and often impels us to do the right.Between Paris and Naples Sidonia passed two years, spent apparently in
the dissipation which was perhaps inseparable from his time of life.He
was admired by women, to whom he was magnificent, idolised by artists
whom he patronised, received in all circles with great distinction, and
appreciated for his intellect by the very few to whom he at all
opened himself.For, though affable and gracious, it was impossible
to penetrate him.Though unreserved in his manner, his frankness was
strictly limited to the surface.He observed everything, thought ever,
but avoided serious discussion.If you pressed him for an opinion, he
took refuge in raillery, or threw out some grave paradox with which it
was not easy to cope.The moment he came of age, Sidonia having previously, at a great family
congress held at Naples, made arrangements with the heads of the houses
that bore his name respecting the disposition and management of his vast
fortune, quitted Europe.Sidonia was absent from his connections for five years, during which
period he never communicated with them.They were aware of his existence
only by the orders which he drew on them for payment, and which arrived
from all quarters of the globe.It would appear from these documents
that he had dwelt a considerable time in the Mediterranean regions;
penetrated Nilotic Africa to Sennaar and Abyssinia; traversed the
Asiatic continent to Tartary, whence he had visited Hindostan, and the
isles of that Indian Sea which are so little known.Afterwards he was
heard of at Valparaiso, the Brazils, and Lima.He evidently remained
some time at Mexico, which he quitted for the United States.One
morning, without notice, he arrived in London.Sidonia had exhausted all the sources of human knowledge; he was master
of the learning of every nation, of all tongues dead or living, of every
literature, Western and Oriental.He had pursued the speculations
of science to their last term, and had himself illustrated them by
observation and experiment.He had lived in all orders of society, had
viewed every combination of Nature and of Art, and had observed man
under every phasis of civilisation.He had even studied him in the
wilderness.The influence of creeds and laws, manners, customs,
traditions, in all their diversities, had been subjected to his personal
scrutiny.He brought to the study of this vast aggregate of knowledge a
penetrative intellect that, matured by long meditation, and assisted
by that absolute freedom from prejudice, which, was the compensatory
possession of a man without a country, permitted Sidonia to fathom,
as it were by intuition, the depth of questions apparently the most
difficult and profound.He possessed the rare faculty of communicating
with precision ideas the most abstruse, and in general a power of
expression which arrests and satisfies attention.With all this knowledge, which no one knew more to prize, with boundless
wealth, and with an athletic frame, which sickness had never tried, and
which had avoided excess, Sidonia nevertheless looked upon life with
a glance rather of curiosity than content.His religion walled him
out from the pursuits of a citizen; his riches deprived him of the
stimulating anxieties of a man.He perceived himself a lone being, alike
without cares and without duties.To a man in his position there might yet seem one unfailing source
of felicity and joy; independent of creed, independent of country,
independent even of character.He might have discovered that perpetual
spring of happiness in the sensibility of the heart.But this was a
sealed fountain to Sidonia.In his organisation there was a peculiarity,
perhaps a great deficiency.It would be
harsh to say he had no heart, for he was susceptible of deep emotions,
but not for individuals.He was capable of rebuilding a town that was
burned down; of restoring a colony that had been destroyed by some awful
visitation of Nature; of redeeming to liberty a horde of captives; and
of doing these great acts in secret; for, void of all self-love, public
approbation was worthless to him; but the individual never touched him.Woman was to him a toy, man a machine.The lot the most precious to man, and which a beneficent Providence
has made not the least common; to find in another heart a perfect and
profound sympathy; to unite his existence with one who could share all
his joys, soften all his sorrows, aid him in all his projects, respond
to all his fancies, counsel him in his cares, and support him in
his perils; make life charming by her charms, interesting by her
intelligence, and sweet by the vigilant variety of her tenderness;
to find your life blessed by such an influence, and to feel that your
influence can bless such a life: this lot, the most divine of divine
gifts, that power and even fame can never rival in its delights, all
this Nature had denied to Sidonia.With an imagination as fiery as his native Desert, and an intellect as
luminous as his native sky, he wanted, like that land, those softening
dews without which the soil is barren, and the sunbeam as often a
messenger of pestilence as an angel of regenerative grace.Such a temperament, though rare, is peculiar to the East.It inspired
the founders of the great monarchies of antiquity, the prophets that the
Desert has sent forth, the Tartar chiefs who have overrun the world;
it might be observed in the great Corsican, who, like most of the
inhabitants of the Mediterranean isles, had probably Arab blood in his
veins.It is a temperament that befits conquerors and legislators, but,
in ordinary times and ordinary situations, entails on its possessor only
eccentric aberrations or profound melancholy.The only human quality that interested Sidonia was Intellect.He cared
not whence it came; where it was to be found: creed, country, class,
character, in this respect, were alike indifferent to him.The author,
the artist, the man of science, never appealed to him in vain.He encouraged their society; was as
frank in his conversation as he was generous in his contributions; but
the instant they ceased to be authors, artists, or philosophers, and
their communications arose from anything but the intellectual quality
which had originally interested him, the moment they were rash enough
to approach intimacy and appealed to the sympathising man instead of
the congenial intelligence, he saw them no more.It was not however
intellect merely in these unquestionable shapes that commanded his
notice.There was not an adventurer in Europe with whom he was not
familiar.No Minister of State had such communication with secret agents
and political spies as Sidonia.He held relations with all the clever
outcasts of the world.The catalogue of his acquaintance in the shape of
Greeks, Armenians, Moors, secret Jews, Tartars, Gipsies, wandering
Poles and Carbonari, would throw a curious light on those subterranean
agencies of which the world in general knows so little, but which
exercise so great an influence on public events.His extensive travels,
his knowledge of languages, his daring and adventurous disposition, and
his unlimited means, had given him opportunities of becoming acquainted
with these characters, in general so difficult to trace, and of gaining
their devotion.To these sources he owed that knowledge of strange and
hidden things which often startled those who listened to him.Nor was it
easy, scarcely possible, to deceive him.Information reached him from
so many, and such contrary quarters, that with his discrimination and
experience, he could almost instantly distinguish the truth.The secret
history of the world was his pastime.His great pleasure was to contrast
the hidden motive, with the public pretext, of transactions.One source of interest Sidonia found in his descent and in the
fortunes of his race.As firm in his adherence to the code of the great
Legislator as if the trumpet still sounded on Sinai, he might have
received in the conviction of divine favour an adequate compensation
for human persecution.But there were other and more terrestrial
considerations that made Sidonia proud of his origin, and confident
in the future of his kind.Sidonia was a great philosopher, who took
comprehensive views of human affairs, and surveyed every fact in its
relative position to other facts, the only mode of obtaining truth.Sidonia was well aware that in the five great varieties into which
Physiology has divided the human species; to wit, the Caucasian, the
Mongolian, the Malayan, the American, the Ethiopian; the Arabian tribes
rank in the first and superior class, together, among others, with the
Saxon and the Greek.This fact alone is a source of great pride and
satisfaction to the animal Man.But Sidonia and his brethren could
claim a distinction which the Saxon and the Greek, and the rest of
the Caucasian nations, have forfeited.Doubtless, among the tribes who inhabit the bosom of the Desert,
progenitors alike of the Mosaic and the Mohammedan Arabs, blood may be
found as pure as that of the descendants of the Scheik Abraham.But the
Mosaic Arabs are the most ancient, if not the only, unmixed blood that
dwells in cities.An unmixed race of a firstrate organisation are the aristocracy of
Nature.Such excellence is a positive fact; not an imagination, a
ceremony, coined by poets, blazoned by cozening heralds, but perceptible
in its physical advantages, and in the vigour of its unsullied
idiosyncrasy.In his comprehensive travels, Sidonia had visited and examined the
Hebrew communities of the world.He had found, in general, the lower
orders debased; the superior immersed in sordid pursuits; but he
perceived that the intellectual development was not impaired.He was persuaded that organisation would outlive persecution.When he reflected on what they had endured, it was only marvellous
that the race had not disappeared.They had defied exile, massacre,
spoliation, the degrading influence of the constant pursuit of gain;
they had defied Time.For nearly three thousand years, according to
Archbishop Usher, they have been dispersed over the globe.To the
unpolluted current of their Caucasian structure, and to the segregating
genius of their great Law-giver, Sidonia ascribed the fact that they
had not been long ago absorbed among those mixed races, who presume
to persecute them, but who periodically wear away and disappear, while
their victims still flourish in all the primeval vigour of the pure
Asian breed.Shortly after his arrival in England, Sidonia repaired to the principal
Courts of Europe, that he might become personally acquainted with
the monarchs and ministers of whom he had heard so much.His position
insured him a distinguished reception; his personal qualities
immediately made him cherished.He could please; he could do more, he
could astonish.He could throw out a careless observation which would
make the oldest diplomatist start; a winged word that gained him the
consideration, sometimes the confidence, of Sovereigns.When he had
fathomed the intelligence which governs Europe, and which can only be
done by personal acquaintance, he returned to this country.The somewhat hard and literal character of English life suited one who
shrank from sensibility, and often took refuge in sarcasm.Its masculine
vigour and active intelligence occupied and interested his mind.Sidonia, indeed, was exactly the character who would be welcomed in our
circles.His immense wealth, his unrivalled social knowledge, his clear
vigorous intellect, the severe simplicity of his manners, frank, but
neither claiming nor brooking familiarity, and his devotion to field
sports, which was the safety-valve of his energy, were all circumstances
and qualities which the English appreciate and admire; and it may be
fairly said of Sidonia that few men were more popular, and none less
understood.At dinner, Coningsby was seated on the same side as Sidonia, and distant
from him.There had been, therefore, no mutual recognition.Another
guest had also arrived, Mr.He came straight from London,
full of rumours, had seen Tadpole, who, hearing he was on the wing for
Coningsby Castle, had taken him into a dark corner of a club, and
shown him his book, a safe piece of confidence, as Mr.Ormsby was very
near-sighted.It was, however, to be received as an undoubted fact, that
all was right, and somehow or other, before very long, there would be
national demonstration of the same.Ormsby, and the
news that he bore, gave a political turn to the conversation after the
ladies had left the room.'Tadpole wants me to stand for Birmingham,' said Mr.exclaimed Lord Monmouth, and throwing himself back in his chair,
he broke into a real, hearty laugh.'Yes; the Conservatives mean to start two candidates; a manufacturer
they have got, and they have written up to Tadpole for a "West-end
man."''A West-end man, who will make the ladies patronise their fancy
articles.''The result of the Reform Bill, then,' said Lucian Gay, 'will be to give
Manchester a bishop, and Birmingham a dandy.''I begin to believe the result will be very different from what we
expected,' said Lord Monmouth.Rigby shook his head and was going to prophesy, when Lord Eskdale,
who liked talk to be short, and was of opinion that Rigby should keep
his amplifications for his slashing articles, put in a brief careless
observation, which balked his inspiration.Ormsby, 'when the guns were firing over Vyvyan's
last speech and confession, I never expected to be asked to stand for
Birmingham.''Perhaps you may be called up to the other house by the title,' said
Lucian Gay.'I agree with Tadpole,' said Mr.Ormsby, 'that if we only stick to the
Registration the country is saved.'said Sidonia, 'that can be saved by a good
registration!''I believe, after all, that with property and pluck,' said Lord
Monmouth, 'Parliamentary Reform is not such a very bad thing.'Here several gentlemen began talking at the same time, all agreeing
with their host, and proving in their different ways, the irresistible
influence of property and pluck; property in Lord Monmouth's mind
meaning vassals, and pluck a total disregard for public opinion.Guy
Flouncey, who wanted to get into parliament, but why nobody knew, who
had neither political abilities nor political opinions, but had some
floating idea that it would get himself and his wife to some more
balls and dinners, and who was duly ticketed for 'a good thing' in the
candidate list of the Tadpoles and the Tapers, was of opinion that an
immense deal might be done by properly patronising borough races.That
was his specific how to prevent revolution.Taking advantage of a pause, Lord Monmouth said, 'I should like to know
what you think of this question, Sidonia?''I am scarcely a competent judge,' he said, as if wishing to disclaim
any interference in the conversation, and then added, 'but I have been
ever of opinion that revolutions are not to be evaded.'Rigby, eagerly; 'I say it now, I have said
it a thousand times, you may doctor the registration as you like, but
you can never get rid of Schedule A.''Is there a person in this room who can now tell us the names of the
boroughs in Schedule A?''I am sure I cannot,'said Lord Monmouth, 'though six of them belong to
myself.'Rigby; 'they represented a principle.''Nothing else, certainly,' said Lucian Gay.'That is a practice, not a principle,' said Sidonia.'Is it a practice
that no longer exists?''You think then,' said Lord Eskdale, cutting in before Rigby, 'that the
Reform Bill has done us no harm?''It is not the Reform Bill that has shaken the aristocracy of this
country, but the means by which that Bill was carried,' replied Sidonia.Rigby, impatient at any one giving the tone in a
political discussion but himself, and chafing under the vigilance of
Lord Eskdale, which to him ever appeared only fortuitous, violently
assaulted the argument, and astonished several country gentlemen present
by its volubility.At the
end of a long appeal to Sidonia, that gentleman only bowed his head and
said, 'Perhaps;' and then, turning to his neighbour, inquired whether
birds were plentiful in Lancashire this season; so that Mr.Rigby was
reduced to the necessity of forming the political opinions of Mr.As the gentlemen left the dining-room, Coningsby, though at some
distance, was observed by Sidonia, who stopped instantly, then advanced
to Coningsby, and extending his hand said, 'I said we should meet again,
though I hardly expected so quickly.''And I hope we shall not separate so soon,' said Coningsby; 'I was much
struck with what you said just now about the Reform Bill.Do you know
that the more I think the more I am perplexed by what is meant by
Representation?''It is a principle of which a limited definition is only current in
this country,' said Sidonia, quitting the room with him.'People may be
represented without periodical elections of neighbours who are incapable
to maintain their interests, and strangers who are unwilling.'The entrance of the gentlemen produced the same effect on the saloon as
sunrise on the world; universal animation, a general though gentle stir.The Grand-duke, bowing to every one, devoted himself to the daughter
of Lady St.Julians, who herself pinned Lord Beaumanoir before he could
reach Mrs.Coningsby instead talked nonsense to that lady.Melton, addressed a band of beautiful
damsels grouped on a large ottoman.Everywhere sounded a delicious
murmur, broken occasionally by a silver-sounding laugh not too loud.Sidonia and Lord Eskdale did not join the ladies.They stood for a few
moments in conversation, and then threw themselves on a sofa.asked Sidonia of his companion rather earnestly, as
Coningsby quitted them.''Tis the grandson of Monmouth; young Coningsby.'I met him once before, by chance;
he interests me.''They tell me he is a lively lad.He is a prodigious favourite here, and
I should not be surprised if Monmouth made him his heir.''I hope he does not dream of inheritance,' said Sidonia.''Tis the most
enervating of visions.'Guy Flouncey to
Coningsby.'When should men be gallant, if not to the brilliant and the beautiful!'Coningsby, Lord Henry Sydney is a
very great friend of yours?''He does a great deal for the poor at Beaumanoir.A very fine place, is
it not?'Guy Flouncey at Coningsby, Beaumanoir would have
no chance.'Coningsby, what do you
think we shall do to-night?I look upon you, you know, as the real
arbiter of our destinies.''You shall decide,' said Coningsby.'Mon cher Harry,' said Madame Colonna, coming up, 'they wish Lucretia to
sing and she will not.You must ask her, she cannot refuse you.''I assure you she can,' said Coningsby.'Mon cher Harry, your grandpapa did desire me to beg you to ask her to
sing.'So Coningsby unwillingly approached Lucretia, who was talking with the
Russian Ambassador.'I am sent upon a fruitless mission,' said Coningsby, looking at her,
and catching her glance.'The mission is to entreat you to do us all a great favour; and the
cause of its failure will be that I am the envoy.''If the favour be one to yourself, it is granted; and if you be the
envoy, you need never fear failure with me.''I must presume then to lead you away,' said Coningsby, bending to the
Ambassador.'Remember,' said Lucretia, as they approached the instrument, 'that I am
singing to you.''It is impossible ever to forget it,' said Coningsby, leading her to the
piano with great politeness, but only with great politeness.'Where is Mademoiselle Flora?'Coningsby found La Petite crouching as it were behind some furniture,
and apparently looking over some music.She looked up as he approached,
and a smile stole over her countenance.'I am come to ask a favour,' he
said, and he named his request.'I will sing,' she replied; 'but only tell me what you like.'Coningsby felt the difference between the courtesy of the head and of
the heart, as he contrasted the manner of Lucretia and Flora.Nothing
could be more exquisitely gracious than the daughter of Colonna was
to-night; Flora, on the contrary, was rather agitated and embarrassed;
and did not express her readiness with half the facility and the grace
of Lucretia; but Flora's arm trembled as Coningsby led her to the piano.Meantime Lord Eskdale and Sidonia are in deep converse.Some new _protegee_ of Lord Monmouth?'''Tis the daughter of the Colonnas,' said Lord Eskdale, 'the Princess
Lucretia.''Why, she was not at dinner to-day.''My favourite voice; and of all, the rarest to be found.When I was a
boy, it made me almost in love even with Pisaroni.''Well, the Princess is scarcely more lovely.'Tis a pity the plumage is
not as beautiful as the note.'Well, I rather admire her myself,' said Lord Eskdale.The song ceased, Lord Eskdale advanced, made his compliments, and then
said, 'You were not at dinner to-day.''For our sakes, for mine, if not for your own,' said Lord Eskdale,
smiling.'Your absence has been remarked, and felt, I assure you, by
others as well as myself.There is my friend Sidonia so enraptured with
your thrilling tones, that he has abruptly closed a conversation which I
have been long counting on.And having obtained a consent, not often conceded, Lord Eskdale looked
round, and calling Sidonia, he presented his friend to the Princess.'You are fond of music, Lord Eskdale tells me?''When it is excellent,' said Sidonia.'But that is so rare,' said the Princess.'And precious as Paradise,' said Sidonia.'As for indifferent music,
'tis Purgatory; but when it is bad, for my part I feel myself--'

'Where?''In the last circle of the Inferno,' said Sidonia.'And in what circle do you place us who are here?''One too polished for his verse,' replied her companion.'You mean too insipid,' said the Princess.'I wish that life were a
little more Dantesque.''There is not less treasure in the world,' said Sidonia, 'because we use
paper currency; and there is not less passion than of old, though it is
_bon ton_ to be tranquil.'said the Princess, inquiringly, and then looking
round the apartment.'Have these automata, indeed, souls?''As many as would have had souls in the
fourteenth century.''I thought they were wound up every day,' said the Princess.'Some are self-impelling,' said Sidonia.'You are one of
those who can read human nature?''Lord Monmouth tells me you are a great traveller?''I would sooner recall the old than discover the new,' said the
Princess.'We have both of us cause,' said Sidonia.'Our names are the names of
the Past.''I do not love a world of Utility,' said the Princess.'You prefer to be celebrated to being comfortable,' said Sidonia.'It seems to me that the world is withering under routine.'''Tis the inevitable lot of humanity,' said Sidonia.'Man must ever
be the slave of routine: but in old days it was a routine of great
thoughts, and now it is a routine of little ones.'The evening glided on; the dance succeeded the song; the ladies were
fast vanishing; Coningsby himself was meditating a movement, when Lord
Beaumanoir, as he passed him, said, 'Come to Lucian Gay's room; we are
going to smoke a cigar.'This was a favourite haunt, towards midnight, of several of the younger
members of the party at the Castle, who loved to find relaxation from
the decorous gravities of polished life in the fumes of tobacco, the
inspiration of whiskey toddy, and the infinite amusement of Lucian Gay's
conversation and company.This was the genial hour when the good story
gladdened, the pun flashed, and the song sparkled with jolly mirth
or saucy mimicry.To-night, being Coningsby's initiation, there was a
special general meeting of the Grumpy Club, in which everybody was to
say the gayest things with the gravest face, and every laugh carried a
forfeit.He told a tale for which
he was famous, of 'the very respectable county family who had been
established in the shire for several generations, but who, it was
a fact, had been ever distinguished by the strange and humiliating
peculiarity of being born with sheep's tails.'The remarkable
circumstances under which Lucian Gay had become acquainted with this
fact; the traditionary mysteries by which the family in question had
succeeded for generations in keeping it secret; the decided measures to
which the chief of the family had recourse to stop for ever the rumour
when it first became prevalent; and finally the origin and result of the
legend; were details which Lucian Gay, with the most rueful countenance,
loved to expend upon the attentive and expanding intelligence of a new
member of the Grumpy Club.Familiar as all present were with the story
whose stimulus of agonising risibility they had all in turn experienced,
it was with extreme difficulty that any of them could resist the fatal
explosion which was to be attended with the dreaded penalty.Lord
Beaumanoir looked on the table with desperate seriousness, an ominous
pucker quivering round his lip; Mr.Melton crammed his handkerchief into
his mouth with one hand, while he lighted the wrong end of a cigar with
the other; one youth hung over the back of his chair pinching himself
like a faquir, while another hid his countenance on the table.'It was at the Hunt dinner,' continued Lucian Gay, in an almost solemn
tone, 'that an idea for a moment was prevalent, that Sir Mowbray
Cholmondeley Fetherstonehaugh, as the head of the family, had resolved
to terminate for ever these mysterious aspersions on his race, that had
circulated in the county for more than two centuries; I mean that the
highly respectable family of the Cholmondeley Fetherstonehaughs had the
misfortune to be graced with that appendage to which I have referred.His health being drunk, Sir Mowbray Cholmondeley Fetherstonehaugh
rose.He was a little unpopular at the moment, from an ugly story about
killing foxes, and the guests were not as quiet as orators generally
desire, so the Honourable Baronet prayed particular attention to a
matter personal to himself.Instantly there was a dead silence--' but
here Coningsby, who had moved for some time very restlessly on his
chair, suddenly started up, and struggling for a moment against the
inward convulsion, but in vain, stamped against the floor, and gave a
shout.Coningsby,' said the president of the Grumpy Club, amid
an universal, and now permissible roar of laughter.Coningsby could not sing; so he was to favour them as a substitute
with a speech or a sentiment.But Lucian Gay always let one off these
penalties easily, and, indeed, was ever ready to fulfil them for all.Song, speech, or sentiment, he poured them all forth; nor were pastimes
more active wanting.He could dance a Tarantella like a Lazzarone, and
execute a Cracovienne with all the mincing graces of a ballet heroine.His powers of mimicry, indeed, were great and versatile.But in nothing
was he so happy as in a Parliamentary debate.And it was remarkable
that, though himself a man who on ordinary occasions was quite incapable
without infinite perplexity of publicly expressing his sense of the
merest courtesy of society, he was not only a master of the style of
every speaker of distinction in either house, but he seemed in his
imitative play to appropriate their intellectual as well as their
physical peculiarities, and presented you with their mind as well as
their manner.There were several attempts to-night to induce Lucian to
indulge his guests with a debate, but he seemed to avoid the exertion,
which was great.As the night grew old, however, and every hour he
grew more lively, he suddenly broke without further pressure into the
promised diversion; and Coningsby listened really with admiration to a
discussion, of which the only fault was that it was more parliamentary
than the original, 'plus Arabe que l'Arabie.'The Duke was never more curt, nor Sir Robert more specious; he was as
fiery as Stanley, and as bitter as Graham.Nor did he do their opponents
less justice.Lord Palmerston himself never treated a profound subject
with a more pleasant volatility; and when Lucian rose at an early hour
of morn, in a full house alike exhausted and excited, and after having
endured for hours, in sarcastic silence, the menacing finger of Sir
Robert, shaking over the green table and appealing to his misdeeds in
the irrevocable records of Hansard, Lord John himself could not have
afforded a more perfect representative of pluck.But loud as was the laughter, and vehement the cheering, with which
Lucian's performances were received, all these ebullitions sank into
insignificance compared with the reception which greeted what he himself
announced was to be the speech of the night.Having quaffed full many
a quaigh of toddy, he insisted on delivering, it on the table, a
proposition with which his auditors immediately closed.The orator appeared, the great man of the night, who was to answer
everybody on both sides.that harsh voice, that arrogant style,
that saucy superficiality which decided on everything, that insolent
ignorance that contradicted everybody; it was impossible to mistake
them!And Coningsby had the pleasure of seeing reproduced before him the
guardian of his youth and the patron of the mimic, the Right Honourable
Nicholas Rigby!Madame Colonna, with that vivacious energy which characterises the
south, had no sooner seen Coningsby, and heard his praises celebrated
by his grandfather, than she resolved that an alliance should sooner
or later take place between him and her step-daughter.She imparted her
projects without delay to Lucretia, who received them in a different
spirit from that in which they were communicated.Lucretia bore as
little resemblance to her step-mother in character, as in person.If
she did not possess her beauty, she was born with an intellect of far
greater capacity and reach.A hasty alliance
with a youth, arranged by their mutual relatives, might suit very well
the clime and manners of Italy, but Lucretia was well aware that it was
altogether opposed to the habits and feelings of this country.She had
no conviction that either Coningsby would wish to marry her, or, if
willing, that his grandfather would sanction such a step in one as yet
only on the threshold of the world.Lucretia therefore received
the suggestions and proposals of Madarne Colonna with coldness and
indifference; one might even say contempt, for she neither felt respect
for this lady, nor was she sedulous to evince it.Although really
younger than Coningsby, Lucretia felt that a woman of eighteen is, in
all worldly considerations, ten years older than a youth of the same
age.She anticipated that a considerable time might elapse before
Coningsby would feel it necessary to seal his destiny by marriage,
while, on the other hand, she was not only anxious, but resolved, not
to delay on her part her emancipation from the galling position in which
she very frequently found herself.Lucretia felt rather than expressed these ideas and impressions.She
was not naturally communicative, and conversed with no one with less
frankness and facility than with her step-mother.Madame Colonna
therefore found no reasons in her conversation with Lucretia to change
her determination.As her mind was not ingenious she did not see
questions in those various lights which make us at the same time infirm
of purpose and tolerant.What she fancied ought to be done, she fancied
must be done; for she perceived no middle course or alternative.For
the rest, Lucretia's carriage towards her gave her little discomfort.Besides, she herself, though good-natured, was obstinate.Her feelings
were not very acute; nothing much vexed her.As long as she had fine
dresses, good dinners, and opera-boxes, she could bear her plans to be
crossed like a philosopher; and her consolation under her unaccomplished
devices was her admirable consistency, which always assured her that her
projects were wise, though unfulfilled.Rigby, that she might gain not only his
adhesion to her views, but his assistance in achieving them.Rigby's estimation, exercised more influence over Lord
Monmouth than any other individual, faithful to his policy or practice,
he agreed with all Madame Colonna's plans and wishes, and volunteered
instantly to further them.As for the Prince, his wife never consulted
him on any subject, nor did he wish to be consulted.On the contrary, he
had no opinion about anything.All that he required was that he should
be surrounded by what contributed to his personal enjoyment, that he
should never be troubled, and that he should have billiards.He was not
inexpert in field-sports, rode indeed very well for an Italian, but
he never cared to be out-of-doors; and there was only one room in the
interior which passionately interested him.It was where the echoing
balls denoted the sweeping hazard or the effective cannonade.That was
the chamber where the Prince Colonna literally existed.Half-an-hour
after breakfast he was in the billiard-room; he never quitted it until
he dressed for dinner; and he generally contrived, while the world were
amused or amusing themselves at the comedy or in the dance, to steal
down with some congenial sprites to the magical and illumined chamber,
and use his cue until bedtime.Faithful to her first impressions, Lucretia had made no difference
in her demeanour to Coningsby to that which she offered to the other
guests.Polite, but uncommunicative; ready to answer, but never
originating conversation; she charmed him as little by her manner as by
her person; and after some attempts, not very painstaking, to interest
her, Coningsby had ceased to address her.The day passed by with only a
faint recognition between them; even that sometimes omitted.When, however, Lucretia observed that Coningsby had become one of the
most notable persons in the Castle; when she heard everywhere of
his talents and accomplishments, his beauty and grace and great
acquirements, and perceived that he was courted by all; that Lord
Monmouth omitted no occasion publicly to evince towards him his regard
and consideration; that he seemed generally looked upon in the light of
his grandfather's heir; and that Lady St.Julians, more learned in that
respect than any lady in the kingdom, was heard more than once to regret
that she had not brought another daughter with her, Clara Isabella, as
well as Augustina; the Princess Lucretia began to imagine that Madame
Colonna, after all, might not be so extravagant in her purpose as she
had first supposed.She, therefore, surprised Coningsby with the almost
affectionate moroseness with which, while she hated to sing, she yet
found pleasure in singing for him alone.And it is impossible to say
what might not have been the next move in her tactics in this respect,
had not the very night on which she had resolved to commence the
enchantment of Coningsby introduced to her Sidonia.The Princess Lucretia encountered the dark still glance of the friend of
Lord Eskdale.He, too, beheld a woman unlike other women, and with his
fine experience, both as a man and as a physiologist, felt that he was
in the presence of no ordinary organisation.From the evening of his
introduction Sidonia sought the society of the Princess Lucretia.She threw out her mind in various and
highly-cultivated intelligence.He recognised in her a deep and subtile
spirit, considerable reading for a woman, habits of thought, and a soul
passionate and daring.She resolved to subdue one whose appreciation she
had gained, and who had subdued her.The profound meaning and the calm
manner of Sidonia combined to quell her spirit.She tried to rival his power; to cope with him, and with
the same weapons.But prompt as was her thought and bright as was
its expression, her heart beat in tumult; and, with all her apparent
serenity, her agitated soul was a prey of absorbing passion.She could
not contend with that intelligent, yet inscrutable, eye; with that
manner so full of interest and respect, and yet so tranquil.Besides,
they were not on equal terms.Here was a girl contending with a man
learned in the world's way.Between Sidonia and Coningsby there at once occurred companionship.The
morning after his arrival they went out shooting together.After a long
ramble they would stretch themselves on the turf under a shady tree,
often by the side of some brook where the cresses grow, that added
a luxury to their sporting-meal; and then Coningsby would lead their
conversation to some subject on which Sidonia would pour out his mind
with all that depth of reflection, variety of knowledge, and richness
of illustrative memory, which distinguished him; and which offered so
striking a contrast to the sharp talent, the shallow information, and
the worldly cunning, that make a Rigby.This fellowship between Sidonia and Coningsby elevated the latter still
more in the estimation of Lucretia, and rendered her still more desirous
of gaining his good will and opinion.A great friendship seemed to have
arisen between them, and the world began to believe that there must be
some foundation for Madame Colonna's innuendos.That lady herself
was not in the least alarmed by the attention which Sidonia paid her
step-daughter.It was, of course, well known that Sidonia was not a
marrying man.He was, however, a great friend of Mr.Coningsby, his
presence and society brought Coningsby and Lucretia more together; and
however flattered her daughter might be for the moment by Sidonia's
homage, still, as she would ultimately find out, if indeed she ever
cared so to do, that Sidonia could only be her admirer, Madame Colonna
had no kind of doubt that ultimately Coningsby would be Lucretia's
husband, as she had arranged from the first.The Princess Lucretia was a fine horse-woman, though she rarely joined
the various riding-parties that were daily formed at the Castle.Often,
indeed, attended only by her groom, she met the equestrians.Now she
would ride with Sidonia and Coningsby, and as a female companion was
indispensable, she insisted upon La Petite accompanying her.This was a
fearful trial for Flora, but she encountered it, encouraged by the kind
solicitude of Coningsby, who always seemed her friend.Very shortly after the arrival of Sidonia, the Grand-duke and his suite
quitted the Castle, which had been his Highness' head-quarters during
his visit to the manufacturing districts; but no other great change in
the assembled company occurred for some little time.'You will observe one curious trait,' said Sidonia to Coningsby, 'in the
history of this country: the depository of power is always unpopular;
all combine against it; it always falls.Power was deposited in the
great Barons; the Church, using the King for its instrument, crushed the
great Barons.Power was deposited in the Church; the King, bribing the
Parliament, plundered the Church.Power was deposited in the King; the
Parliament, using the People, beheaded the King, expelled the King,
changed the King, and, finally, for a King substituted an administrative
officer.For one hundred and fifty years Power has been deposited in the
Parliament, and for the last sixty or seventy years it has been becoming
more and more unpopular.In 1830 it was endeavoured by a reconstruction
to regain the popular affection; but, in truth, as the Parliament then
only made itself more powerful, it has only become more odious.As we
see that the Barons, the Church, the King, have in turn devoured each
other, and that the Parliament, the last devourer, remains, it is
impossible to resist the impression that this body also is doomed to be
destroyed; and he is a sagacious statesman who may detect in what form
and in what quarter the great consumer will arise.''You take, then, a dark view of our position?'I do not ascribe to political institutions that
paramount influence which it is the feeling of this age to attribute to
them.The Senate that confronted Brennus in the Forum was the same body
that registered in an after-age the ribald decrees of a Nero.Trial
by jury, for example, is looked upon by all as the Palladium of our
liberties; yet a jury, at a very recent period of our own history, the
reign of Charles II., was a tribunal as iniquitous as the Inquisition.'And a graver expression stole over the countenance of Sidonia as he
remembered what that Inquisition had operated on his own race and his
own destiny.'There are families in this country,' he continued, 'of
both the great historical parties, that in the persecution of their
houses, the murder and proscription of some of their most illustrious
members, found judges as unjust and relentless in an open jury of their
countrymen as we did in the conclaves of Madrid and Seville.''Where, then, would you look for hope?''In what is more powerful than laws and institutions, and without which
the best laws and the most skilful institutions may be a dead letter,
or the very means of tyranny in the national character.It is not in
the increased feebleness of its institutions that I see the peril of
England; it is in the decline of its character as a community.''And yet you could scarcely describe this as an age of corruption?'But it is an age of social
disorganisation, far more dangerous in its consequences, because far
more extensive.You may have a corrupt government and a pure community;
you may have a corrupt community and a pure administration.Neither,' said Coningsby; 'I wish to see a people full of faith, and a
government full of duty.''Rely upon it,' said Sidonia, 'that England should think more of the
community and less of the government.''But tell me, what do you understand by the term national character?''A character is an assemblage of qualities; the character of England
should be an assemblage of great qualities.''But we cannot deny that the English have great virtues.''The civilisation of a thousand years must produce great virtues; but we
are speaking of the decline of public virtue, not its existence.''In what, then, do you trace that decline?''In the fact that the various classes of this country are arrayed
against each other.''But to what do you attribute those reciprocal hostilities?''Not entirely, not even principally, to those economical causes of which
we hear so much.I look upon all such as secondary causes, which, in a
certain degree, must always exist, which obtrude themselves in troubled
times, and which at all times it is the business of wise statesmen to
watch, to regulate, to ameliorate, to modify.''I am speaking to elicit truth, not to maintain opinions,' said
Coningsby; 'for I have none,' he added, mournfully.'I think,' said Sidonia, 'that there is no error so vulgar as to believe
that revolutions are occasioned by economical causes.They come in,
doubtless, very often to precipitate a catastrophe; very rarely do they
occasion one.I know no period, for example, when physical comfort
was more diffused in England than in 1640.England had a moderate
population, a very improved agriculture, a rich commerce; yet she was
on the eve of the greatest and most violent changes that she has as yet
experienced.''Admit it; the cause, then, was not physical.The imagination of England
rose against the government.It proves, then, that when that faculty is
astir in a nation, it will sacrifice even physical comfort to follow its
impulses.''Do you think, then, there is a wild desire for extensive political
change in the country?''Hardly that: England is perplexed at the present moment, not inventive.That will be the next phasis in her moral state, and to that I wish
to draw your thoughts.For myself, while I ascribe little influence to
physical causes for the production of this perplexity, I am still less
of opinion that it can be removed by any new disposition of political
power.That would be recurring to
the old error of supposing you can necessarily find national content in
political institutions.A political institution is a machine; the motive
power is the national character.With that it rests whether the
machine will benefit society, or destroy it.Society in this country is
perplexed, almost paralysed; in time it will move, and it will devise.How are the elements of the nation to be again blended together?In what
spirit is that reorganisation to take place?''To know that would be to know everything.''At least let us free ourselves from the double ignorance of the
Platonists.Let us not be ignorant that we are ignorant.''I have emancipated myself from that darkness for a long time,'said
Coningsby.'Long has my mind been musing over these thoughts, but to me
all is still obscurity.''In this country,' said Sidonia,'since the peace, there has been an
attempt to advocate a reconstruction of society on a purely rational
basis.I speak
not with lightness of the labours of the disciples of that school.I bow
to intellect in every form: and we should be grateful to any school of
philosophers, even if we disagree with them; doubly grateful in this
country, where for so long a period our statesmen were in so pitiable an
arrear of public intelligence.There has been an attempt to reconstruct
society on a basis of material motives and calculations.It must ultimately have failed under any circumstances; its failure in
an ancient and densely-peopled kingdom was inevitable.How limited is
human reason, the profoundest inquirers are most conscious.We are not
indebted to the Reason of man for any of the great achievements which
are the landmarks of human action and human progress.It was not Reason
that besieged Troy; it was not Reason that sent forth the Saracen
from the Desert to conquer the world; that inspired the Crusades; that
instituted the Monastic orders; it was not Reason that produced
the Jesuits; above all, it was not Reason that created the French
Revolution.Man is only truly great when he acts from the passions;
never irresistible but when he appeals to the imagination.Even Mormon
counts more votaries than Bentham.''And you think, then, that as Imagination once subdued the State,
Imagination may now save it?''Man is made to adore and to obey: but if you will not command him, if
you give him nothing to worship, he will fashion his own divinities, and
find a chieftain in his own passions.''But where can we find faith in a nation of sectaries?Who can feel
loyalty to a sovereign of Downing Street?''I speak of the eternal principles of human nature, you answer me with
the passing accidents of the hour.Where
are the Fifth-Monarchy men?England is governed by Downing Street; once
it was governed by Alfred and Elizabeth.'About this time a steeple-chase in the West of England had attracted
considerable attention.This sport was then of recent introduction in
England, and is, in fact, an importation of Irish growth, although it
has flourished in our soil.A young guardsman, who was then a guest at
the Castle, and who had been in garrison in Ireland, had some experience
of this pastime in the Kildare country, and he proposed that they should
have a steeple-chase at Coningsby.This was a suggestion very agreeable
to the Marquess of Beaumanoir, celebrated for his feats of horsemanship,
and, indeed, to most of the guests.It was agreed that the race should
come off at once, before any of the present company, many of whom
gave symptoms of being on the wing, had quitted the Castle.Guy Flouncey had surveyed the country and had selected
a line which they esteemed very appropriate for the scene of action.From a hill of common land you looked down upon the valley of Coningsby,
richly cultivated, deeply ditched, and stiffly fenced; the valley was
bounded by another rising ground, and the scene was admirably calculated
to give an extensive view to a multitude.The distance along the valley was to be two miles out, and home again;
the starting-post being also the winning-post, and the flags, which were
placed on every fence which the horses were to pass, were to be passed
on the left hand of the rider both going and coming; so that although
the horses had to leap the same fences forward and backward, they
could not come over the same place twice.In the last field before they
turned, was a brook seventeen feet clear from side to side, with good
taking off both banks.Lord Monmouth highly approved the scheme, but mentioned that the stakes
must be moderate, and open to the whole county.The neighbourhood had
a week of preparation, and the entries for the Coningsby steeple-chase
were numerous.Lord Monmouth, after a reserve for his own account,
placed his stable at the service of his guests.For himself, he offered
to back his horse, Sir Robert, which was to be ridden by his grandson.Now, nothing was spoken or thought of at Coningsby Castle except the
coming sport.They embroidered
handkerchiefs, and scarfs, and gloves, with the respective colours of
the rivals, and tried to make jockey-caps.Julians postponed
her intended departure in consequence.Madame Colonna wished that some
means could be contrived by which they might all win.Sidonia, with the other competitors, had ridden over the ground and
glanced at the brook with the eye of a workman.On his return to the
Castle he sent a despatch for some of his stud.He was proud of the confidence of
his grandfather in backing him.He had a powerful horse and a firstrate
fencer, and he was resolved himself not to flinch.On the night before
the race, retiring somewhat earlier than usual to his chamber, he
observed on his dressing-table a small packet addressed to his name, and
in an unknown handwriting.Opening it, he found a pretty racing-jacket
embroidered with his colours of pink and white.This was a perplexing
circumstance, but he fancied it on the whole a happy omen.Certainly not the Princess Lucretia, for he had observed her
fashioning some maroon ribbons, which were the colours of Sidonia.Perhaps Madame Colonna to
please the Marquess?The morning before the race Sidonia's horses arrived.All went to
examine them at the stables.Coningsby
recognised the Daughter of the Star.She was greatly admired for her
points; but Guy Flouncey whispered to Mr.Melton that she never could do
the work.'But Lord Beaumanoir says he is all for speed against strength in these
affairs,' said Mr.The night before the race it rained rather heavily.'I take it the country will not be very like the Deserts of Arabia,'
said Mr.Guy Flouncey, with a knowing look to Mr.Melton, who was noting
a bet in his memorandum-book.The morning was fine, clear, and sunny, with a soft western breeze.The
starting-post was about three miles from the Castle; but, long before
the hour, the surrounding hills were covered with people; squire and
farmer; with no lack of their wives and daughters; many a hind in his
smock-frock, and many an 'operative' from the neighbouring factories.The 'gentlemen riders' gradually arrived.The entries were very
numerous, though it was understood that not more than a dozen would
come to the post, and half of these were the guests of Lord Monmouth.At half-past one the _cortege_ from the Castle arrived, and took up the
post which had been prepared for them on the summit of the hill.Lord
Monmouth was much cheered on his arrival.In the carriage with him
were Madame Colonna and Lady St.The Princess Lucretia, Lady
Gaythorp, Mrs.Guy Flouncey, accompanied by Lord Eskdale and other
cavaliers, formed a brilliant company.There was scarcely a domestic
in the Castle who was not there.The comedians, indeed, did not care to
come, but Villebecque prevailed upon Flora to drive with him to the race
in a buggy he borrowed of the steward.The start was to be at two o'clock.The 'gentlemen jockeys' are
mustered.Never were riders mounted and appointed in better style.The
stewards and the clerk of the course attend them to the starting-post.Guy Flouncey takes up his stirrup-leathers
a hole; Mr.In a few moments, the
irrevocable monosyllable will be uttered.The bugle sounds for them to face about; the clerk of the course sings
out, 'Gentlemen, are you all ready?'No objection made, the word given
to go, and fifteen riders start in excellent style.Prince Colonna, who rode like Prince Rupert, took the lead, followed
close by a stout yeoman on an old white horse of great provincial
celebrity, who made steady running, and, from his appearance and action,
an awkward customer.The rest, with two exceptions, followed in a
cluster at no great distance, and in this order they continued, with
very slight variation, for the first two miles, though there were
several ox-fences, and one or two of them remarkably stiff.Indeed, they
appeared more like horses running over a course than over a country.The
two exceptions were Lord Beaumanoir on his horse Sunbeam, and Sidonia on
the Arab.Almost in this wise they approached the dreaded brook.Indeed, with the
exception of the last two riders, who were about thirty yards behind, it
seemed that you might have covered the rest of the field with a sheet.They arrived at the brook at the same moment: seventeen feet of water
between strong sound banks is no holiday work; but they charged with
unfaltering intrepidity.But what a revolution in their spirited order
did that instant produce!A masked battery of canister and grape could
not have achieved more terrible execution.Coningsby alone clearly
lighted on the opposing bank; but, for the rest of them, it seemed for a
moment that they were all in the middle of the brook, one over another,
splashing, kicking, swearing; every one trying to get out and keep
others in.Melton and the stout yeoman regained their saddles and
were soon again in chase.The Prince lost his horse, and was not alone
in his misfortune.Guy Flouncey lay on his back with a horse across
his diaphragm; only his head above the water, and his mouth full of
chickweed and dockleaves.And if help had not been at hand, he and
several others might have remained struggling in their watery bed for
a considerable period.In the midst of this turmoil, the Marquess and
Sidonia at the same moment cleared the brook.Here Coningsby took up the running,
Sidonia and the Marquess lying close at his quarters.Melton had
gone the wrong side of a flag, and the stout yeoman, though close at
hand, was already trusting much to his spurs.In the extreme distance
might be detected three or four stragglers.Thus they continued until
within three fields of home.A ploughed field finished the old white
horse; the yeoman struck his spurs to the rowels, but the only effect
of the experiment was, that the horse stood stock-still.Coningsby,
Sidonia, and the Marquess were now all together.The winning-post is in
sight, and a high and strong gate leads to the last field.Coningsby,
looking like a winner, gallantly dashed forward and sent Sir Robert at
the gate, but he had over-estimated his horse's powers at this point of
the game, and a rattling fall was the consequence: however, horse and
rider were both on the right side, and Coningsby was in his saddle and
at work again in a moment.There was only one more fence; and that the foot people had made a
breach in by the side of a gate-post, and wide enough, as was said, for
a broad-wheeled waggon to travel by.Instead of passing straight over
this gap, Sunbeam swerved against the gate and threw his rider.The Daughter of the Star, who was still going beautifully,
pulling double, and her jockey sitting still, sprang over the gap
and went in first; Coningsby, on Sir Robert, being placed second.The
distance measured was about four miles; there were thirty-nine leaps;
and it was done under fifteen minutes.Lord Monmouth was well content with the prowess of his grandson, and
his extreme cordiality consoled Coningsby under a defeat which was very
vexatious.It was some alleviation that he was beaten by Sidonia.Madame Colonna even shed tears at her young friend's disappointment, and
mourned it especially for Lucretia, who had said nothing, though a flush
might be observed on her usually pale countenance.Villebecque, who had
betted, was so extremely excited by the whole affair, especially during
the last three minutes, that he quite forgot his quiet companion, and
when he looked round he found Flora fainting.'You rode well,' said Sidonia to Coningsby; 'but your horse was more
strong than swift.After all, this thing is a race; and, notwithstanding
Solomon, in a race speed must win.'Notwithstanding the fatigues of the morning, the evening was passed with
great gaiety at the Castle.The gentlemen all vowed that, far from being
inconvenienced by their mishaps, they felt, on the whole, rather better
for them.Guy Flouncey, indeed, did not seem quite so limber
and flexible as usual; and the young guardsman, who had previously
discoursed in an almost alarming style of the perils and feats of the
Kildare country, had subsided into a remarkable reserve.The Provincials
were delighted with Sidonia's riding, and even the Leicestershire
gentlemen admitted that he was a 'customer.'Lord Monmouth beckoned to Coningsby to sit by him on the sofa, and spoke
of his approaching University life.He gave his grandson a great deal of
good advice: told him to avoid drinking, especially if he ever chanced
to play cards, which he hoped he never would; urged the expediency of
never borrowing money, and of confining his loans to small sums, and
then only to friends of whom he wished to get rid; most particularly
impressed on him never to permit his feelings to be engaged by any
woman; nobody, he assured Coningsby, despised that weakness more than
women themselves.Indeed, feeling of any kind did not suit the present
age: it was not _bon ton_; and in some degree always made a man
ridiculous.Coningsby was always to have before him the possible
catastrophe of becoming ridiculous.It was the test of conduct, Lord
Monmouth said; a fear of becoming ridiculous is the best guide in life,
and will save a man from all sorts of scrapes.For the rest, Coningsby
was to appear at Cambridge as became Lord Monmouth's favourite grandson.His grandfather had opened an account for him with Drummonds', on whom
he was to draw for his considerable allowance; and if by any chance he
found himself in a scrape, no matter of what kind, he was to be sure to
write to his grandfather, who would certainly get him out of it.'Your departure is sudden,' said the Princess Lucretia, in a low deep
tone to Sidonia, who was sitting by her side and screened from general
observation by the waltzers who whirled by.'I do not like departures,' said the Princess.'Nor did the Queen of Sheba when she quitted Solomon.'She wept very much, and let one of the King's birds fly into the
garden."You are freed from your cage," she said; "but I am going back
to mine."''It at least resembles the Desert in one respect: it is useless.''Yet there have been heroines,' said Sidonia.'The Queen of Sheba,' said the Princess, smiling.'A favourite of mine,' said Sidonia.'And why was she a favourite of yours?''Because she thought deeply, talked finely, and moved gracefully.''And yet might be a very unfeeling dame at the same time,' said the
Princess.'I never thought of that,' said Sidonia.'The heart, apparently, does not reckon in your philosophy.''What we call the heart,' said Sidonia, 'is a nervous sensation, like
shyness, which gradually disappears in society.It is fervent in the
nursery, strong in the domestic circle, tumultuous at school.The
affections are the children of ignorance; when the horizon of
our experience expands, and models multiply, love and admiration
imperceptibly vanish.''I fear the horizon of your experience has very greatly expanded.With
your opinions, what charm can there be in life?''So Sidonia is off to-morrow, Monmouth,' said Lord Eskdale.'I must get him to breakfast with me before he
goes.'Coningsby, who had heard Lord Eskdale announce
Sidonia's departure, lingered to express his regret, and say farewell.'I cannot sleep,' said Sidonia, 'and I never smoke in Europe.If you are
not stiff with your wounds, come to my rooms.''I am going to Cambridge in a week,' said Coningsby.I was almost in
hopes you might have remained as long.''I also; but my letters of this morning demand me.If it had not been
for our chase, I should have quitted immediately.The minister
cannot pay the interest on the national debt; not an unprecedented
circumstance, and has applied to us.I never permit any business of
State to be transacted without my personal interposition; and so I must
go up to town immediately.''Suppose you don't pay it,' said Coningsby, smiling.'If I followed my own impulse, I would remain here,' said Sidonia.'Can
anything be more absurd than that a nation should apply to an individual
to maintain its credit, and, with its credit, its existence as an
empire, and its comfort as a people; and that individual one to whom its
laws deny the proudest rights of citizenship, the privilege of sitting
in its senate and of holding land?for though I have been rash enough
to buy several estates, my own opinion is, that, by the existing law of
England, an Englishman of Hebrew faith cannot possess the soil.''But surely it would be easy to repeal a law so illiberal--'

'Oh!as for illiberality, I have no objection to it if it be an element
of power.What I contend is, that if
you permit men to accumulate property, and they use that permission to a
great extent, power is inseparable from that property, and it is in the
last degree impolitic to make it the interest of any powerful class to
oppose the institutions under which they live.The Jews, for example,
independently of the capital qualities for citizenship which they
possess in their industry, temperance, and energy and vivacity of mind,
are a race essentially monarchical, deeply religious, and shrinking
themselves from converts as from a calamity, are ever anxious to see
the religious systems of the countries in which they live flourish;
yet, since your society has become agitated in England, and powerful
combinations menace your institutions, you find the once loyal
Hebrew invariably arrayed in the same ranks as the leveller, and the
latitudinarian, and prepared to support the policy which may even
endanger his life and property, rather than tamely continue under a
system which seeks to degrade him.The Tories lose an important election
at a critical moment; 'tis the Jews come forward to vote against them.The Church is alarmed at the scheme of a latitudinarian university, and
learns with relief that funds are not forthcoming for its establishment;
a Jew immediately advances and endows it.Yet the Jews, Coningsby,
are essentially Tories.Toryism, indeed, is but copied from the mighty
prototype which has fashioned Europe.And every generation they must
become more powerful and more dangerous to the society which is hostile
to them.Do you think that the quiet humdrum persecution of a decorous
representative of an English university can crush those who have
successively baffled the Pharaohs, Nebuchadnezzar, Rome, and the Feudal
ages?The fact is, you cannot destroy a pure race of the Caucasian
organisation.It is a physiological fact; a simple law of nature, which
has baffled Egyptian and Assyrian Kings, Roman Emperors, and Christian
Inquisitors.No penal laws, no physical tortures, can effect that a
superior race should be absorbed in an inferior, or be destroyed by it.The mixed persecuting races disappear; the pure persecuted race remains.And at this moment, in spite of centuries, of tens of centuries, of
degradation, the Jewish mind exercises a vast influence on the affairs
of Europe.I speak not of their laws, which you still obey; of their
literature, with which your minds are saturated; but of the living
Hebrew intellect.'You never observe a great intellectual movement in Europe in which
the Jews do not greatly participate.The first Jesuits were Jews; that
mysterious Russian Diplomacy which so alarms Western Europe is organised
and principally carried on by Jews; that mighty revolution which is at
this moment preparing in Germany, and which will be, in fact, a second
and greater Reformation, and of which so little is as yet known in
England, is entirely developing under the auspices of Jews, who almost
monopolise the professorial chairs of Germany.Neander, the founder of
Spiritual Christianity, and who is Regius Professor of Divinity in the
University of Berlin, is a Jew.Benary, equally famous, and in the same
University, is a Jew.Wehl, the Arabic Professor of Heidelberg, is a
Jew.Years ago, when I was In Palestine, I met a German student who was
accumulating materials for the History of Christianity, and studying
the genius of the place; a modest and learned man.It was Wehl; then
unknown, since become the first Arabic scholar of the day, and the
author of the life of Mahomet.But for the German professors of this
race, their name is Legion.I think there are more than ten at Berlin
alone.'I told you just now that I was going up to town tomorrow, because I
always made it a rule to interpose when affairs of State were on
the carpet.I hear of peace and war in
newspapers, but I am never alarmed, except when I am informed that the
Sovereigns want treasure; then I know that monarchs are serious.'A few years back we were applied, to by Russia.Now, there has been
no friendship between the Court of St.It
has Dutch connections, which have generally supplied it; and our
representations in favour of the Polish Hebrews, a numerous race, but
the most suffering and degraded of all the tribes, have not been very
agreeable to the Czar.However, circumstances drew to an approximation
between the Romanoffs and the Sidonias.I had, on my arrival, an interview with the Russian Minister
of Finance, Count Cancrin; I beheld the son of a Lithuanian Jew.The
loan was connected with the affairs of Spain; I resolved on repairing to
Spain from Russia.I had an audience
immediately on my arrival with the Spanish Minister, Senor Mendizabel; I
beheld one like myself, the son of a Nuevo Christiano, a Jew of Arragon.In consequence of what transpired at Madrid, I went straight to Paris
to consult the President of the French Council; I beheld the son of a
French Jew, a hero, an imperial marshal, and very properly so, for who
should be military heroes if not those who worship the Lord of Hosts?''Yes, and others of the French marshals, and the most famous; Massena,
for example; his real name was Manasseh: but to my anecdote.The
consequence of our consultations was, that some Northern power should
be applied to in a friendly and mediative capacity.We fixed on Prussia;
and the President of the Council made an application to the Prussian
Minister, who attended a few days after our conference.Count Arnim
entered the cabinet, and I beheld a Prussian Jew.So you see, my dear
Coningsby, that the world is governed by very different personages from
what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.''You startle, and deeply interest me.''You must study physiology, my dear child.Pure races of Caucasus may be
persecuted, but they cannot be despised, except by the brutal ignorance
of some mongrel breed, that brandishes fagots and howls extermination,
but is itself exterminated without persecution, by that irresistible law
of Nature which is fatal to curs.''But I come also from Caucasus,' said Coningsby.'Verily; and thank your Creator for such a destiny: and your race is
sufficiently pure.You come from the shores of the Northern Sea, land
of the blue eye, and the golden hair, and the frank brow: 'tis a
famous breed, with whom we Arabs have contended long; from whom we have
suffered much: but these Goths, and Saxons, and Normans were doubtless
great men.''But so favoured by Nature, why has not your race produced great poets,
great orators, great writers?''Favoured by Nature and by Nature's God, we produced the lyre of David;
we gave you Isaiah and Ezekiel; they are our Olynthians, our Philippics.Favoured by Nature we still remain: but in exact proportion as we have
been favoured by Nature we have been persecuted by Man.After a thousand
struggles; after acts of heroic courage that Rome has never equalled;
deeds of divine patriotism that Athens, and Sparta, and Carthage have
never excelled; we have endured fifteen hundred years of supernatural
slavery, during which, every device that can degrade or destroy man has
been the destiny that we have sustained and baffled.The Hebrew child
has entered adolescence only to learn that he was the Pariah of that
ungrateful Europe that owes to him the best part of its laws, a fine
portion of its literature, all its religion.Great poets require a
public; we have been content with the immortal melodies that we sung
more than two thousand years ago by the waters of Babylon and wept.They
record our triumphs; they solace our affliction.Great orators are the
creatures of popular assemblies; we were permitted only by stealth to
meet even in our temples.And as for great writers, the catalogue is not
blank.What are all the schoolmen, Aquinas himself, to Maimonides?And
as for modern philosophy, all springs from Spinoza.'But the passionate and creative genius, that is the nearest link to
Divinity, and which no human tyranny can destroy, though it can divert
it; that should have stirred the hearts of nations by its inspired
sympathy, or governed senates by its burning eloquence; has found a
medium for its expression, to which, in spite of your prejudices and
your evil passions, you have been obliged to bow.The ear, the voice,
the fancy teeming with combinations, the imagination fervent with
picture and emotion, that came from Caucasus, and which we have
preserved unpolluted, have endowed us with almost the exclusive
privilege of Music; that science of harmonious sounds, which the
ancients recognised as most divine, and deified in the person of their
most beautiful creation.I speak not of the past; though, were I to
enter into the history of the lords of melody, you would find it the
annals of Hebrew genius.But at this moment even, musical Europe is
ours.There is not a company of singers, not an orchestra in a single
capital, that is not crowded with our children under the feigned names
which they adopt to conciliate the dark aversion which your posterity
will some day disclaim with shame and disgust.Almost every great
composer, skilled musician, almost every voice that ravishes you with
its transporting strains, springs from our tribes.The catalogue is too
vast to enumerate; too illustrious to dwell for a moment on secondary
names, however eminent.Enough for us that the three great creative
minds to whose exquisite inventions all nations at this moment yield,
Rossini, Meyerbeer, Mendelssohn, are of Hebrew race; and little do your
men of fashion, your muscadins of Paris, and your dandies of London, as
they thrill into raptures at the notes of a Pasta or a Grisi, little do
they suspect that they are offering their homage to "the sweet singers
of Israel!"'It was the noon of the day on which Sidonia was to leave the Castle.The
wind was high; the vast white clouds scudded over the blue heaven; the
leaves yet green, and tender branches snapped like glass, were whirled
in eddies from the trees; the grassy sward undulated like the ocean with
a thousand tints and shadows.From the window of the music-room Lucretia
Colonna gazed on the turbulent sky.The heaven of her heart, too, was disturbed.She turned from the agitated external world to ponder over her inward
emotion.Slowly she moved towards her harp; wildly, almost unconsciously, she
touched with one hand its strings, while her eyes were fixed on the
ground.An imperfect melody resounded; yet plaintive and passionate.She raised her head, and then, touching
the strings with both her hands, she poured forth tones of deep, yet
thrilling power.'I am a stranger in the halls of a stranger!To the castle of my fathers in the green mountains; to the palace of my
    fathers in the ancient city?There is no flag on the castle of my fathers in the green mountains,
    silent is the palace of my fathers in the ancient city.thou fliest away, fleet cloud: he will leave us swifter than thee!cutting wind, thy breath is not so cold as his heart!I am a stranger in the halls of a stranger!The door of the music-room slowly opened.His hat was in
his hand; he was evidently on the point of departure.'Those sounds assured me,' he said calmly but kindly, as he advanced,
'that I might find you here, on which I scarcely counted at so early an
hour.''My carriage is at the door; the Marquess has delayed me; I must be in
London to-night.I conclude more abruptly than I could have wished one
of the most agreeable visits I ever made; and I hope you will permit
me to express to you how much I am indebted to you for a society which
those should deem themselves fortunate who can more frequently enjoy.'He held forth his hand; she extended hers, cold as marble, which he bent
over, but did not press to his lips.'Lord Monmouth talks of remaining here some time,' he observed; 'but I
suppose next year, if not this, we shall all meet in some city of the
earth?'Lucretia bowed; and Sidonia, with a graceful reverence, withdrew.The Princess Lucretia stood for some moments motionless; a sound
attracted her to the window; she perceived the equipage of Sidonia
whirling along the winding roads of the park.She watched it till it
disappeared; then quitting the window, she threw herself into a chair,
and buried her face in her shawl.BOOK V.


CHAPTER I.


An University life did not bring to Coningsby that feeling of
emancipation usually experienced by freshmen.The contrast between
school and college life is perhaps, under any circumstances, less
striking to the Etonian than to others: he has been prepared for
becoming his own master by the liberty wisely entrusted to him in his
boyhood, and which is, in general, discreetly exercised.But there were
also other reasons why Coningsby should have been less impressed with
the novelty of his life, and have encountered less temptations than
commonly are met with in the new existence which an University opens to
youth.In the interval which had elapsed between quitting Eton and going
to Cambridge, brief as the period may comparatively appear, Coningsby
had seen much of the world.Three or four months, indeed, may not seem,
at the first blush, a course of time which can very materially influence
the formation of character; but time must not be counted by calendars,
but by sensations, by thought.Coningsby had felt a good deal, reflected
more.He had encountered a great number of human beings, offering a vast
variety of character for his observation.It was not merely manners, but
even the intellectual and moral development of the human mind, which
in a great degree, unconsciously to himself, had been submitted to his
study and his scrutiny.New trains of ideas had been opened to him; his
mind was teeming with suggestions.The horizon of his intelligence had
insensibly expanded.He perceived that there were other opinions in the
world, besides those to which he had been habituated.The depths of his
intellect had been stirred.He distinguished three individuals whose acquaintance had greatly
influenced his mind; Eustace Lyle, the elder Millbank, above all,
Sidonia.He curiously meditated over the fact, that three English
subjects, one of them a principal landed proprietor, another one of the
most eminent manufacturers, and the third the greatest capitalist in the
kingdom, all of them men of great intelligence, and doubtless of a
high probity and conscience, were in their hearts disaffected with the
political constitution of the country.Yet, unquestionably, these were
the men among whom we ought to seek for some of our first citizens.What, then, was this repulsive quality in those institutions which we
persisted in calling national, and which once were so?There was another reason, also, why Coningsby should feel a little
fastidious among his new habits, and, without being aware of it, a
little depressed.For three or four months, and for the first time in
his life, he had passed his time in the continual society of refined and
charming women.It is an acquaintance which, when habitual, exercises a
great influence over the tone of the mind, even if it does not produce
any more violent effects.It refines the taste, quickens the perception,
and gives, as it were, a grace and flexibility to the intellect.Coningsby in his solitary rooms arranging his books, sighed when he
recalled the Lady Everinghams and the Lady Theresas; the gracious
Duchess; the frank, good-natured Madame Colonna; that deeply interesting
enigma the Princess Lucretia; and the gentle Flora.He thought with
disgust of the impending dissipation of an University, which could only
be an exaggeration of their coarse frolics at school.It seemed rather
vapid this mighty Cambridge, over which they had so often talked in
the playing fields of Eton, with such anticipations of its vast and
absorbing interest.And those University honours that once were the
great object of his aspirations, they did not figure in that grandeur
with which they once haunted his imagination.What Coningsby determined to conquer was knowledge.He had watched the
influence of Sidonia in society with an eye of unceasing vigilance.Coningsby perceived that all yielded to him; that Lord Monmouth even,
who seemed to respect none, gave place to his intelligence; appealed
to him, listened to him, was guided by him.What was the secret of this
influence?On all subjects, his views were prompt and clear,
and this not more from his native sagacity and reach of view, than from
the aggregate of facts which rose to guide his judgment and illustrate
his meaning, from all countries and all ages, instantly at his command.The friends of Coningsby were now hourly arriving.It seemed when he
met them again, that they had all suddenly become men since they had
separated; Buckhurst especially.He had been at Paris, and returned with
his mind very much opened, and trousers made quite in a new style.All
his thoughts were, how soon he could contrive to get back again; and
he told them endless stories of actresses, and dinners at fashionable
_cafes_.Vere enjoyed Cambridge most, because he had been staying
with his family since he quitted Eton.Henry Sydney was full of
church architecture, national sports, restoration of the order of the
Peasantry, and was to maintain a constant correspondence on these and
similar subjects with Eustace Lyle.Finally, however, they all fell into
a very fair, regular, routine life.They all read a little, but not
with the enthusiasm which they had once projected.Buckhurst drove
four-in-hand, and they all of them sometimes assisted him; but not
immoderately.Their suppers were sometimes gay, but never outrageous;
and, among all of them, the school friendship was maintained unbroken,
and even undisturbed.The fame of Coningsby preceded him at Cambridge.No man ever went up
from whom more was expected in every way.The dons awaited a sucking
member for the University, the undergraduates were prepared to welcome
a new Alcibiades.He was neither: neither a prig nor a profligate; but
a quiet, gentlemanlike, yet spirited young man, gracious to all, but
intimate only with his old friends, and giving always an impression in
his general tone that his soul was not absorbed in his University.And yet, perhaps, he might have been coddled into a prig, or flattered
into a profligate, had it not been for the intervening experience which
he had gained between his school and college life.That had visibly
impressed upon him, what before he had only faintly acquired from books,
that there was a greater and more real world awaiting him, than to be
found in those bowers of Academus to which youth is apt at first to
attribute an exaggerated importance.A world of action and passion,
of power and peril; a world for which a great preparation was indeed
necessary, severe and profound, but not altogether such an one as was
now offered to him.Yet this want must be supplied, and by himself.Coningsby had already acquirements sufficiently considerable, with some
formal application, to ensure him at all times his degree.He was no
longer engrossed by the intention he once proudly entertained of trying
for honours, and he chalked out for himself that range of reading,
which, digested by his thought, should furnish him in some degree with
that various knowledge of the history of man to which he aspired.No, we
must not for a moment believe that accident could have long diverted
the course of a character so strong.The same desire that prevented the
Castle of his grandfather from proving a Castle of Indolence to
him, that saved him from a too early initiation into the seductive
distractions of a refined and luxurious society, would have preserved
Coningsby from the puerile profligacy of a college life, or from being
that idol of private tutors, a young pedant.It was that noble ambition,
the highest and the best, that must be born in the heart and organised
in the brain, which will not let a man be content, unless his
intellectual power is recognised by his race, and desires that it should
contribute to their welfare.It is the heroic feeling; the feeling that
in old days produced demigods; without which no State is safe; without
which political institutions are meat without salt; the Crown a
bauble, the Church an establishment, Parliaments debating-clubs, and
Civilisation itself but a fitful and transient dream.Less than a year after the arrival of Coningsby at Cambridge, and which
he had only once quitted in the interval, and that to pass a short
time in Berkshire with his friend Buckhurst, occurred the death of
King William IV.This event necessarily induced a dissolution of the
Parliament, elected under the auspices of Sir Robert Peel in 1834, and
after the publication of the Tamworth Manifesto.The death of the King was a great blow to what had now come to be
generally styled the 'Conservative Cause.'It was quite unexpected;
within a fortnight of his death, eminent persons still believed that
'it was only the hay-fever.'Had his Majesty lived until after the then
impending registration, the Whigs would have been again dismissed.Nor
is there any doubt that, under these circumstances, the Conservative
Cause would have secured for the new ministers a parliamentary majority.What would have been the consequences to the country, if the four years
of Whig rule, from 1837 to 1841, had not occurred?It is easier to
decide what would have been the consequences to the Whigs.Some of their
great friends might have lacked blue ribbons and lord-lieutenancies,
and some of their little friends comfortable places in the Customs and
Excise.They would have lost, undoubtedly, the distribution of four
years' patronage; we can hardly say the exercise of four years' power;
but they would have existed at this moment as the most powerful and
popular Opposition that ever flourished in this country, if, indeed, the
course of events had not long ere this carried them back to their old
posts in a proud and intelligible position.The Reform Bill did not
do more injury to the Tories, than the attempt to govern this country
without a decided Parliamentary majority did the Whigs.The greatest of
all evils is a weak government.They cannot carry good measures, they
are forced to carry bad ones.The death of the King was a great blow to the Conservative Cause; that
is to say, it darkened the brow of Tadpole, quailed the heart of Taper,
crushed all the rising hopes of those numerous statesmen who believe
the country must be saved if they receive twelve hundred a-year.It is a
peculiar class, that; 1,200_l._ per annum, paid quarterly, is their idea
of political science and human nature.To receive 1,200_l._ per annum is
government; to try to receive 1,200_l._ per annum is opposition; to wish
to receive 1,200_l._ per annum is ambition.If a man wants to get into
Parliament, and does not want to get 1,200_l._ per annum, they look upon
him as daft; as a benighted being.They stare in each other's face,
and ask, 'What can ***** want to get into Parliament for?'They have no
conception that public reputation is a motive power, and with many men
the greatest.They have as much idea of fame or celebrity, even of the
masculine impulse of an honourable pride, as eunuchs of manly joys.The twelve-hundred-a-yearers were in despair about the King's death.Their loyal souls were sorely grieved that his gracious Majesty had not
outlived the Registration.All their happy inventions about 'hay-fever,'
circulated in confidence, and sent by post to chairmen of Conservative
Associations, followed by a royal funeral!General election about to
take place with the old registration; government boroughs against them,
and the young Queen for a cry.What could they possibly get up to
countervail it?Even Church and Corn-laws together would not do; and
then Church was sulky, for the Conservative Cause had just made it a
present of a commission, and all that the country gentlemen knew of
Conservatism was, that it would not repeal the Malt Tax, and had made
them repeal their pledges.A dissolution
without a cry, in the Taper philosophy, would be a world without a sun.A rise might be got by 'Independence of the House of Lords;' and Lord
Lyndhurst's summaries might be well circulated at one penny per hundred,
large discount allowed to Conservative Associations, and endless credit.Tadpole, however, was never very fond of the House of Lords; besides, it
was too limited.Tadpole wanted the young Queen brought in; the rogue!At length, one morning, Taper came up to him with a slip of paper, and a
smile of complacent austerity on his dull visage, 'I think, Mr.Tadpole took the paper and read, 'OUR YOUNG QUEEN, AND OUR OLD
INSTITUTIONS.'The eyes of Tadpole sparkled as if they had met a gnomic sentence of
Periander or Thales; then turning to Taper, he said,

'What do you think of "ancient," instead of "old"?''You cannot have "Our modern Queen and our ancient Institutions,"' said
Mr.The dissolution was soon followed by an election for the borough of
Cambridge.The Conservative Cause candidate was an old Etonian.That was
a bond of sympathy which imparted zeal even to those who were a little
sceptical of the essential virtues of Conservatism.Every undergraduate
especially who remembered 'the distant spires,' became enthusiastic.He cheered, he canvassed, he brought
men to the poll whom none could move; he influenced his friends and
his companions.Even Coningsby caught the contagion, and Vere, who had
imbibed much of Coningsby's political sentiment, prevailed on himself to
be neutral.The Conservative Cause triumphed in the person of its Eton
champion.The day the member was chaired, several men in Coningsby's
rooms were talking over their triumph.said the panting Buckhurst, throwing himself on the sofa, 'it
was well done; never was any thing better done.The
greatest triumph the Conservative Cause has had.And yet,' he added,
laughing, 'if any fellow were to ask me what the Conservative Cause is,
I am sure I should not know what to say.''Why, it is the cause of our glorious institutions,' said Coningsby.'A
Crown robbed of its prerogatives; a Church controlled by a commission;
and an Aristocracy that does not lead.''Under whose genial influence the order of the Peasantry, "a country's
pride," has vanished from the face of the land,' said Henry Sydney, 'and
is succeeded by a race of serfs, who are called labourers, and who burn
ricks.''Under which,' continued Coningsby, 'the Crown has become a cipher; the
Church a sect; the Nobility drones; and the People drudges.''It is the great constitutional cause,' said Lord Vere, 'that refuses
everything to opposition; yields everything to agitation; conservative
in Parliament, destructive out-of-doors; that has no objection to any
change provided only it be effected by unauthorised means.''The first public association of men,' said Coningsby, 'who have worked
for an avowed end without enunciating a single principle.''And who have established political infidelity throughout the land,'
said Lord Henry.said Buckhurst, 'what infernal fools we have made ourselves
this last week!''Nay,' said Coningsby, smiling, 'it was our last schoolboy weakness.Floreat Etona, under all circumstances.''I certainly, Coningsby,' said Lord Vere,'shall not assume the
Conservative Cause, instead of the cause for which Hampden died in the
field, and Sydney on the scaffold.''The cause for which Hampden died in the field and Sydney on the
scaffold,' said Coningsby, 'was the cause of the Venetian Republic.''I repeat it,' said Coningsby.'The great object of the Whig leaders
in England from the first movement under Hampden to the last most
successful one in 1688, was to establish in England a high aristocratic
republic on the model of the Venetian, then the study and admiration of
all speculative politicians.Read Harrington; turn over Algernon
Sydney; then you will see how the minds of the English leaders in the
seventeenth century were saturated with the Venetian type.He told the Whig leaders,
"I will not be a Doge."He balanced parties; he baffled them as the
Puritans baffled them fifty years before.The reign of Anne was a
struggle between the Venetian and the English systems.Two great Whig
nobles, Argyle and Somerset, worthy of seats in the Council of Ten,
forced their Sovereign on her deathbed to change the ministry.They brought in a new family on their own
terms.George I. was a Doge; George II.was a Doge; they were what
William III., a great man, would not be.tried not to be
a Doge, but it was impossible materially to resist the deeply-laid
combination.He might get rid of the Whig magnificoes, but he could not
rid himself of the Venetian constitution.And a Venetian constitution
did govern England from the accession of the House of Hanover until
1832.Now I do not ask you, Vere, to relinquish the political tenets
which in ordinary times would have been your inheritance.All I say is,
the constitution introduced by your ancestors having been subverted by
their descendants your contemporaries, beware of still holding Venetian
principles of government when you have not a Venetian constitution to
govern with.Do what I am doing, what Henry Sydney and Buckhurst are
doing, what other men that I could mention are doing, hold yourself
aloof from political parties which, from the necessity of things, have
ceased to have distinctive principles, and are therefore practically
only factions; and wait and see, whether with patience, energy, honour,
and Christian faith, and a desire to look to the national welfare and
not to sectional and limited interests; whether, I say, we may not
discover some great principles to guide us, to which we may adhere, and
which then, if true, will ultimately guide and control others.''The Whigs are worn out,' said Vere, 'Conservatism is a sham, and
Radicalism is pollution.''I certainly,' said Buckhurst, 'when I get into the House of Commons,
shall speak my mind without reference to any party whatever; and all
I hope is, we may all come in at the same time, and then we may make a
party of our own.''I have always heard my father say,' said Vere, 'that there was nothing
so difficult as to organise an independent party in the House of
Commons.'but that was in the Venetian period, Vere,' said Henry Sydney,
smiling.'I dare say,' said Buckhurst, 'the only way to make a party in the
House of Commons is just the one that succeeds anywhere else.When you are living in the same set, dining together
every day, and quizzing the Dons, it is astonishing how well men
agree.As for me, I never would enter into a conspiracy, unless the
conspirators were fellows who had been at Eton with me; and then there
would be no treachery.''Let us think of principles, and not of parties,' said Coningsby.'For my part,' said Buckhurst, 'whenever a political system is breaking
up, as in this country at present, I think the very best thing is to
brush all the old Dons off the stage.They never take to the new road
kindly.They are always hampered by their exploded prejudices and
obsolete traditions.I don't think a single man, Vere, that sat in the
Venetian Senate ought to be allowed to sit in the present English House
of Commons.''Well, no one does in our family except my uncle Philip,' said Lord
Henry; 'and the moment I want it, he will resign; for he detests
Parliament.'Well, we all have fair parliamentary prospects,' said Buckhurst.'I tremble at the responsibility of a
seat at any time.With my present unsettled and perplexed views, there
is nothing from which I should recoil so much as the House of Commons.''I quite agree with you,' said Henry Sydney.'The best thing we can do
is to keep as clear of political party as we possibly can.How many
men waste the best part of their lives in painfully apologising for
conscientious deviation from a parliamentary course which they adopted
when they were boys, without thought, or prompted by some local
connection, or interest, to secure a seat.'It was the midnight following the morning when this conversation
took place, that Coningsby, alone, and having just quitted a rather
boisterous party of wassailers who had been celebrating at Buckhurst's
rooms the triumph of 'Eton Statesmen,' if not of Conservative
principles, stopped in the precincts of that Royal College that reminded
him of his schooldays, to cool his brow in the summer air, that even
at that hour was soft, and to calm his mind in the contemplation of the
still, the sacred, and the beauteous scene that surrounded him.There rose that fane, the pride and boast of Cambridge, not unworthy
to rank among the chief temples of Christendom.Its vast form was
exaggerated in the uncertain hour; part shrouded in the deepest
darkness, while a flood of silver light suffused its southern side,
distinguished with revealing beam the huge ribs of its buttresses, and
bathed with mild lustre its airy pinnacles.'Where is the spirit that raised these walls?'Is then this civilisation, so much vaunted, inseparable
from moderate feelings and little thoughts?If so, give me back
barbarism!Man that is made in the image of the
Creator, is made for God-like deeds.Come what come may, I will cling to
the heroic principle.We must now revert to the family, or rather the household, of Lord
Monmouth, in which considerable changes and events had occurred since
the visit of Coningsby to the Castle in the preceding autumn.In the first place, the earliest frost of the winter had carried off
the aged proprietor of Hellingsley, that contiguous estate which Lord
Monmouth so much coveted, the possession of which was indeed one of the
few objects of his life, and to secure which he was prepared to pay
far beyond its intrinsic value, great as that undoubtedly was.Yet Lord
Monmouth did not become its possessor.Long as his mind had been intent
upon the subject, skilful as had been his combinations to secure his
prey, and unlimited the means which were to achieve his purpose, another
stepped in, and without his privity, without even the consolation of a
struggle, stole away the prize; and this too a man whom he hated, almost
the only individual out of his own family that he did hate; a man who
had crossed him before in similar enterprises; who was his avowed foe;
had lavished treasure to oppose him in elections; raised associations
against his interest; established journals to assail him; denounced him
in public; agitated against him in private; had declared more than
once that he would make 'the county too hot for him;' his personal,
inveterate, indomitable foe, Mr.The loss of Hellingsley was a bitter disappointment to Lord Monmouth;
but the loss of it to such an adversary touched him to the quick.He did
not seek to control his anger; he could not succeed even in concealing
his agitation.He threw upon Rigby that glance so rare with him, but
under which men always quailed; that play of the eye which Lord Monmouth
shared in common with Henry VIII., that struck awe into the trembling
Commons when they had given an obnoxious vote, as the King entered the
gallery of his palace, and looked around him.It was a look which implied that dreadful question, 'Why have I bought
you that such things should happen?Why have I unlimited means and
unscrupulous agents?'It made Rigby even feel; even his brazen tones
were hushed.To fly from everything disagreeable was the practical philosophy of Lord
Monmouth; but he was as brave as he was sensual.He would not shrink
before the new proprietor of Hellingsley.He therefore remained at
the Castle with an aching heart, and redoubled his hospitalities.An
ordinary mind might have been soothed by the unceasing consideration and
the skilful and delicate flattery that ever surrounded Lord Monmouth;
but his sagacious intelligence was never for a moment the dupe of his
vanity.He had no self-love, and as he valued no one, there were really
no feelings to play upon.He saw through everybody and everything; and
when he had detected their purpose, discovered their weakness or their
vileness, he calculated whether they could contribute to his pleasure
or his convenience in a degree that counterbalanced the objections which
might be urged against their intentions, or their less pleasing and
profitable qualities.To be pleased was always a principal object with
Lord Monmouth; but when a man wants vengeance, gay amusement is not
exactly a satisfactory substitute.Lord Monmouth with a serene or smiling visage to his
guests, but in private taciturn and morose, scarcely ever gave a word
to Mr.Rigby, but continually bestowed on him glances which painfully
affected the appetite of that gentleman.In a hundred ways it was
intimated to Mr.Rigby that he was not a welcome guest, and yet
something was continually given him to do which rendered it impossible
for him to take his departure.In this state of affairs, another event
occurred which changed the current of feeling, and by its possible
consequences distracted the Marquess from his brooding meditations over
his discomfiture in the matter of Hellingsley.The Prince Colonna, who,
since the steeple-chase, had imbibed a morbid predilection for such
amusements, and indeed for every species of rough-riding, was thrown
from his horse and killed on the spot.This calamity broke up the party at Coningsby, which was not at the
moment very numerous.Rigby, by command, instantly seized the
opportunity of preventing the arrival of other guests who were expected.Rigby resuming in a great measure
his old position in the Castle.There were a great many things to
be done, and all disagreeable; he achieved them all, and studied
everybody's convenience.Coroners' inquests, funerals especially,
weeping women, these were all spectacles which Lord Monmouth could not
endure, but he was so high-bred, that he would not for the world
that there should be in manner or degree the slightest deficiency in
propriety or even sympathy.But he wanted somebody to do everything that
was proper; to be considerate and consoling and sympathetic.Rigby
did it all; gave evidence at the inquest, was chief mourner at the
funeral, and arranged everything so well that not a single emblem of
death crossed the sight of Lord Monmouth; while Madame Colonna found
submission in his exhortations, and the Princess Lucretia, a little more
pale and pensive than usual, listened with tranquillity to his discourse
on the vanity of all sublunary things.When the tumult had subsided, and habits and feelings had fallen into
their old routine and relapsed into their ancient channels, the
Marquess proposed that they should all return to London, and with great
formality, though with warmth, begged that Madame Colonna would ever
consider his roof as her own.All were glad to quit the Castle, which
now presented a scene so different from its former animation, and Madame
Colonna, weeping, accepted the hospitality of her friend, until the
impending expansion of the spring would permit her to return to Italy.This notice of her return to her own country seemed to occasion the
Marquess great disquietude.After they had remained about a month in London, Madame Colonna sent
for Mr.Rigby one morning to tell him how very painful it was to her
feelings to remain under the roof of Monmouth House without the sanction
of a husband; that the circumstance of being a foreigner, under such
unusual affliction, might have excused, though not authorised, the step
at first, and for a moment; but that the continuance of such a course
was quite out of the question; that she owed it to herself, to her
step-child, no longer to trespass on this friendly hospitality, which,
if persisted in, might be liable to misconstruction.Rigby
listened with great attention to this statement, and never in the least
interrupted Madame Colonna; and then offered to do that which he was
convinced the lady desired, namely, to make the Marquess acquainted with
the painful state of her feelings.This he did according to his fashion,
and with sufficient dexterity.Rigby himself was anxious to
know which way the wind blew, and the mission with which he had been
entrusted, fell in precisely with his inclinations and necessities.The
Marquess listened to the communication and sighed, then turned gently
round and surveyed himself in the mirror and sighed again, then said to
Rigby,

'You understand exactly what I mean, Rigby.It is quite ridiculous their
going, and infinitely distressing to me.Rigby repaired to the Princess full of mysterious bustle, and with a
face beaming with importance and satisfaction.He made much of the
two sighs; fully justified the confidence of the Marquess in his
comprehension of unexplained intentions; prevailed on Madame Colonna to
have some regard for the feelings of one so devoted; expatiated on the
insignificance of worldly misconstructions, when replied to by such
honourable intentions; and fully succeeded in his mission.Month after month rolled on, and still they stayed; every
month all the family becoming more resigned or more content, and more
cheerful.Rigby never remembered him
more serene and even joyous.His Lordship scarcely ever entered general
society.The Colonna family remained in strict seclusion; and he
preferred the company of these accomplished and congenial friends to the
mob of the great world.Rigby there had always subsisted
considerable confidence.Now, that gentleman seemed to have achieved
fresh and greater claims to her regard.In the pleasure with which he
looked forward to her approaching alliance with his patron, he reminded
her of the readiness with which he had embraced her suggestions for the
marriage of her daughter with Coningsby.Always obliging, she was never
wearied of chanting his praises to her noble admirer, who was apparently
much gratified she should have bestowed her esteem on one of whom she
would necessarily in after-life see so much.It is seldom the lot of
husbands that their confidential friends gain the regards of their
brides.'I am glad you all like Rigby,' said Lord Monmouth, 'as you will see so
much of him.'The remembrance of the Hellingsley failure seemed to be erased from the
memory of the Marquess.Rigby never recollected him more cordial and
confidential, and more equable in his manner.He told Rigby one day,
that he wished that Monmouth House should possess the most sumptuous
and the most fanciful boudoir in London or Paris.That gentleman consulted the first artists, and gave them some hints in
return; his researches on domestic decoration ranged through all
ages; he even meditated a rapid tour to mature his inventions; but his
confidence in his native taste and genius ultimately convinced him that
this movement was unnecessary.The summer advanced; the death of the King occurred; the dissolution
summoned Rigby to Coningsby and the borough of Darlford.His success was
marked certain in the secret books of Tadpole and Taper.A manufacturing
town, enfranchised under the Reform Act, already gained by the
Conservative cause!Influence of character, too; for no one was so popular as Lord Monmouth;
a most distinguished nobleman of strict Conservative principles, who,
if he carried the county and the manufacturing borough also, merited the
strawberry-leaf.'There will be no holding Rigby,' said Taper; 'I'm afraid he will be
looking for something very high.''The higher the better,' rejoined Tadpole, 'and then he will not
interfere with us.I like your high-flyers; it is your plodders I
detest, wearing old hats and high-lows, speaking in committee, and
thinking they are men of business: d----n them!'Rigby went down, and made some impressive speeches; at least they read
very well in some of his second-rate journals, where all the uproar
figured as loud cheering, and the interruption of a cabbage-stalk was
represented as a question from some intelligent individual in the crowd.The fact is, Rigby bored his audience too much with history, especially
with the French Revolution, which he fancied was his 'forte,' so that
the people at last, whenever he made any allusion to the subject, were
almost as much terrified as if they had seen the guillotine.Rigby had as yet one great advantage; he had no opponent; and without
personal opposition, no contest can be very bitter.It was for some days
Rigby _versus_ Liberal principles; and Rigby had much the best of it;
for he abused Liberal principles roundly in his harangues, who, not
being represented on the occasion, made no reply; while plenty of ale,
and some capital songs by Lucian Gay, who went down express, gave the
right cue to the mob, who declared in chorus, beneath the windows of
Rigby's hotel, that he was 'a fine old English gentleman!'But there was to be a contest; no question about that, and a sharp
one, although Rigby was to win, and well.The Liberal party had been so
fastidious about their new candidate, that they had none ready though
several biting.Jawster Sharp thought at one time that sheer necessity
would give him another chance still; but even Rigby was preferable to
Jawster Sharp, who, finding it would not do, published his long-prepared
valedictory address, in which he told his constituents, that having long
sacrificed his health to their interests, he was now obliged to retire
into the bosom of his family.And a very well-provided-for family, too.All this time the Liberal deputation from Darlford, two aldermen, three
town-councillors, and the Secretary of the Reform Association, were
walking about London like mad things, eating luncheons and looking for
a candidate.They called at the Reform Club twenty times in the morning,
badgered whips and red-tapers; were introduced to candidates, badgered
candidates; examined would-be members as if they were at a cattle-show,
listened to political pedigrees, dictated political pledges, referred
to Hansard to see how men had voted, inquired whether men had spoken,
finally discussed terms.If
the principles were right, there was no money; and if money were ready,
money would not take pledges.In fact, they wanted a Phoenix: a very
rich man, who would do exactly as they liked, with extremely low
opinions and with very high connections.'If he would go for the ballot and had a handle to his name, it would
have the best effect,' said the secretary of the Reform Association,
'because you see we are fighting against a Right Honourable, and you
have no idea how that takes with the mob.'The deputation had been three days in town, and urged by despatches
by every train to bring affairs to a conclusion; jaded, perplexed,
confused, they were ready to fall into the hands of the first jobber
or bold adventurer.They discussed over their dinner at a Strand
coffee-house the claims of the various candidates who had presented
themselves.Donald Macpherson Macfarlane, who would only pay the
legal expenses; he was soon despatched.Gingerly Browne, of Jermyn
Street, the younger son of a baronet, who would go as far as 1000_l._
provided the seat was secured.Juggins, a distiller, 2000_l._ man;
but would not agree to any annual subscriptions.Sir Baptist Placid,
vague about expenditure, but repeatedly declaring that 'there could
be no difficulty on that head.'He however had a moral objection to
subscribing to the races, and that was a great point at Darlford.Sir
Baptist would subscribe a guinea per annum to the infirmary, and the
same to all religious societies without any distinction of sects; but
races, it was not the sum, 100_l._ per annum, but the principle.In short, the deputation began to suspect, what was the truth, that they
were a day after the fair, and that all the electioneering rips that
swarm in the purlieus of political clubs during an impending dissolution
of Parliament, men who become political characters in their small circle
because they have been talked of as once having an intention to stand
for places for which they never offered themselves, or for having stood
for places where they never could by any circumstance have succeeded,
were in fact nibbling at their dainty morsel.At this moment of despair, a ray of hope was imparted to them by a
confidential note from a secretary of the Treasury, who wished to
see them at the Reform Club on the morrow.You may be sure they were
punctual to their appointment.The secretary received them with great
consideration.He had got them a candidate, and one of high mark, the
son of a Peer, and connected with the highest Whig houses.If they liked he would introduce them
immediately to the Honourable Alberic de Crecy.He had only to introduce
them, as there was no difficulty either as to means or opinions,
expenses or pledges.The secretary returned with a young gentleman, whose diminutive stature
would seem, from his smooth and singularly puerile countenance, to be
merely the consequence of his very tender years; but Mr.De Crecy was
really of age, or at least would be by nomination-day.He did not say
a word, but looked like the rosebud which dangled in the button-hole of
his frock-coat.The aldermen and town-councillors were what is
sometimes emphatically styled flabbergasted; they were speechless from
bewilderment.De Crecy will go for the ballot,' said the secretary
of the Treasury, with an audacious eye and a demure look, 'and for Total
and Immediate, if you press him hard; but don't, if you can help it,
because he has an uncle, an old county member, who has prejudices, and
might disinherit him.And I am very happy
that I have been the means of bringing about an arrangement which,
I feel, will be mutually advantageous.'And so saying, the secretary
effected his escape.Circumstances, however, retarded for a season the political career of
the Honourable Alberic de Crecy.While the Liberal party at Darlford
were suffering under the daily inflictions of Mr.Rigby's slashing
style, and the post brought them very unsatisfactory prospects of a
champion, one offered himself, and in an address which intimated that he
was no man of straw, likely to recede from any contest in which he
chose to embark.The town was suddenly placarded with a letter to
the Independent Electors from Mr.Millbank, the new proprietor of
Hellingsley.He expressed himself as one not anxious to obtrude himself on their
attention, and founding no claim to their confidence on his recent
acquisition; but at the same time as one resolved that the free and
enlightened community, with which he must necessarily hereafter be much
connected, should not become the nomination borough of any Peer of the
realm without a struggle, if they chose to make one.And so he offered
himself if they could not find a better candidate, without waiting for
the ceremony of a requisition.He was exactly the man they wanted; and
though he had 'no handle to his name,' and was somewhat impracticable
about pledges, his fortune was so great, and his character so high, that
it might be hoped that the people would be almost as content as if
they were appealed to by some obscure scion of factitious nobility,
subscribing to political engagements which he could not comprehend,
and which, in general, are vomited with as much facility as they are
swallowed.The people of Darlford, who, as long as the contest for their
representation remained between Mr.Rigby and the abstraction called
Liberal Principles, appeared to be very indifferent about the result,
the moment they learned that for the phrase had been substituted a
substance, and that, too, in the form of a gentleman who was soon
to figure as their resident neighbour, became excited, speedily
enthusiastic.All the bells of all the churches rang when Mr.Millbank
commenced his canvass; the Conservatives, on the alert, if not alarmed,
insisted on their champion also showing himself in all directions; and
in the course of four-and-twenty hours, such is the contagion of popular
feeling, the town was divided into two parties, the vast majority of
which were firmly convinced that the country could only be saved by the
return of Mr.Rigby, or preserved from inevitable destruction by the
election of Mr.The results of the two canvasses were such as had been anticipated from
the previous reports of the respective agents and supporters.In these
days the personal canvass of a candidate is a mere form.The whole
country that is to be invaded has been surveyed and mapped out before
entry; every position reconnoitred; the chain of communications
complete.In the present case, as was not unusual, both candidates were
really supported by numerous and reputable adherents; and both had good
grounds for believing that they would be ultimately successful.But
there was a body of the electors sufficiently numerous to turn the
election, who would not promise their votes: conscientious men who felt
the responsibility of the duty that the constitution had entrusted to
their discharge, and who would not make up their minds without duly
weighing the respective merits of the two rivals.This class of deeply
meditative individuals are distinguished not only by their pensive turn
of mind, but by a charitable vein that seems to pervade their being.Not
only will they think of your request, but for their parts they wish both
sides equally well.Decision, indeed, as it must dash the hopes of one
of their solicitors, seems infinitely painful to them; they have always
a good reason for postponing it.If you seek their suffrage during the
canvass, they reply, that the writ not having come down, the day of
election is not yet fixed.If you call again to inform them that the
writ has arrived, they rejoin, that perhaps after all there may not be a
contest.If you call a third time, half dead with fatigue, to give them
friendly notice that both you and your rival have pledged yourselves to
go to the poll, they twitch their trousers, rub their hands, and with a
dull grin observe,

'Well, sir, we shall see.'Jobson,' says one of the committee, with an insinuating
smile, 'give Mr.'Jobson, I think you and I know each other,' says a most influential
supporter, with a knowing nod.'Well, I have not made up my mind yet, gentlemen.'says a solemn voice, 'didn't you tell me the other night you
wished well to this gentleman?''So I do; I wish well to everybody,' replies the imperturbable Jobson.'Well, Jobson,' exclaims another member of the committee, with a sigh,
'who could have supposed that you would have been an enemy?''I don't wish to be no enemy to no man, Mr.'Come, Jobson,' says a jolly tanner, 'if I wanted to be a Parliament
man, I don't think you could refuse me one!''I don't think I could, Mr.'Well, then, give it to my friend.''Well, sir, I'll think about it.''Leave him to me,' says another member of the committee, with a
significant look.'Yes, leave him to Hayfield, Mr.Millbank; he knows how to manage him.'But all the same, Jobson continues to look as little tractable and
lamb-like as can be well fancied.And here, in a work which, in an unpretending shape, aspires to take
neither an uninformed nor a partial view of the political history of the
ten eventful years of the Reform struggle, we should pause for a
moment to observe the strangeness, that only five years after the
reconstruction of the electoral body by the Whig party, in a borough
called into political existence by their policy, a manufacturing
town, too, the candidate comprising in his person every quality and
circumstance which could recommend him to the constituency, and
his opponent the worst specimen of the Old Generation, a political
adventurer, who owed the least disreputable part of his notoriety to
his opposition to the Reform Bill; that in such a borough, under such
circumstances, there should be a contest, and that, too, one of a very
doubtful issue.Are we to seek it in the 'Reaction' of the
Tadpoles and the Tapers?Reaction, to a certain extent, is the law of human existence.In the
particular state of affairs before us, England after the Reform Act, it
never could be doubtful that Time would gradually, and in some instances
rapidly, counteract the national impulse of 1832.There never could
have been a question, for example, that the English counties would
have reverted to their natural allegiance to their proprietors; but the
results of the appeals to the third Estate in 1835 and 1837 are not to
be accounted for by a mere readjustment of legitimate influences.The truth is, that, considerable as are the abilities of the Whig
leaders, highly accomplished as many of them unquestionably must be
acknowledged in parliamentary debate, experienced in council, sedulous
in office, eminent as scholars, powerful from their position, the
absence of individual influence, and of the pervading authority of a
commanding mind, have been the cause of the fall of the Whig party.Such a supremacy was generally acknowledged in Lord Grey on the
accession of this party to power: but it was the supremacy of a
tradition rather than of a fact.Almost at the outset of his authority
his successor was indicated.When the crisis arrived, the intended
successor was not in the Whig ranks.It is in this virtual absence of
a real and recognised leader, almost from the moment that they passed
their great measure, that we must seek a chief cause of all that
insubordination, all those distempered ambitions, and all those dark
intrigues, that finally broke up, not only the Whig government, but the
Whig party; demoralised their ranks, and sent them to the country, both
in 1835 and 1837, with every illusion, which had operated so happily in
their favour in 1832, scattered to the winds.In all things we trace the
irresistible influence of the individual.And yet the interval that elapsed between 1835 and 1837 proved, that
there was all this time in the Whig array one entirely competent to the
office of leading a great party, though his capacity for that fulfilment
was too tardily recognised.LORD JOHN RUSSELL has that degree of imagination, which, though evinced
rather in sentiment than expression, still enables him to generalise
from the details of his reading and experience; and to take those
comprehensive views, which, however easily depreciated by ordinary
men in an age of routine, are indispensable to a statesman in the
conjunctures in which we live.He understands, therefore, his position;
and he has the moral intrepidity which prompts him ever to dare that
which his intellect assures him is politic.He is consequently, at the
same time, sagacious and bold in council.As an administrator he is
prompt and indefatigable.He is not a natural orator, and labours under
physical deficiencies which even a Demosthenic impulse could scarcely
overcome.But he is experienced in debate, quick in reply, fertile in
resource, takes large views, and frequently compensates for a dry and
hesitating manner by the expression of those noble truths that flash
across the fancy, and rise spontaneously to the lip, of men of poetic
temperament when addressing popular assemblies.If we add to this, a
private life of dignified repute, the accidents of his birth and rank,
which never can be severed from the man, the scion of a great historic
family, and born, as it were, to the hereditary service of the State, it
is difficult to ascertain at what period, or under what circumstances,
the Whig party have ever possessed, or could obtain, a more efficient
leader.But we must return to the Darlford election.The class of thoughtful
voters was sufficiently numerous in that borough to render the result
of the contest doubtful to the last; and on the eve of the day of
nomination both parties were equally sanguine.Nomination-day altogether is an unsatisfactory affair.There is little
to be done, and that little mere form.The tedious hours remain, and no
one can settle his mind to anything.It is not a holiday, for every one
is serious; it is not business, for no one can attend to it; it is not
a contest, for there is no canvassing; nor an election, for there is no
poll.It is a day of lounging without an object, and luncheons without
an appetite; of hopes and fears; confidence and dejection; bravado bets
and secret hedging; and, about midnight, of furious suppers of grilled
bones, brandy-and-water, and recklessness.The president and vice-president of the Conservative Association, the
secretary and the four solicitors who were agents, had impressed upon
Mr.Rigby that it was of the utmost importance, and must produce a
great moral effect, if he obtain the show of hands.With his powers of
eloquence and their secret organisation, they flattered themselves it
might be done.With this view, Rigby inflicted a speech of more than
two hours' duration on the electors, who bore it very kindly, as the mob
likes, above all things, that the ceremonies of nomination-day should
not be cut short: moreover, there is nothing that the mob likes so much
as a speech.Rigby therefore had, on the whole, a far from unfavourable
audience, and he availed himself of their forbearance.He brought in
his crack theme, the guillotine, and dilated so elaborately upon its
qualities, that one of the gentlemen below could not refrain from
exclaiming, 'I wish you may get it.'Rigby
what is called a great opening, which, like a practised speaker, he
immediately seized.He denounced the sentiment as 'un-English,' and got
much cheered.Excited by this success, Rigby began to call everything
else 'un-English' with which he did not agree, until menacing murmurs
began to rise, when he shifted the subject, and rose into a grand
peroration, in which he assured them that the eyes of the whole empire
were on this particular election; cries of 'That's true,' from all
sides; and that England expected every man to do his duty.'And who do you expect to do yours?'inquired a gentleman below,' about
that 'ere pension?''Rigby,' screeched a hoarse voice, 'don't you mind; you guv it them
well.''Rigby, keep up your spirits, old chap: we will have you.'said a stentorian voice; and a man as tall as Saul looked round
him.This was the engaged leader of the Conservative mob; the eye of
every one of his minions was instantly on him.Our young Queen and
our Old Institutions!This was a signal for the instant appearance of the leader of the
Liberal mob.Magog Wrath, not so tall as Bully Bluck, his rival, had
a voice almost as powerful, a back much broader, and a countenance far
more forbidding.'Now, my boys, the Queen and Millbank for ever!'These rival cries were the signals for a fight between the two bands of
gladiators in the face of the hustings, the body of the people little
interfering.Bully Bluck seized Magog Wrath's colours; they wrestled,
they seized each other; their supporters were engaged in mutual contest;
it appeared to be a most alarming and perilous fray; several ladies from
the windows screamed, one fainted; a band of special constables pushed
their way through the mob; you heard their staves resounded on the
skulls of all who opposed them, especially the little boys: order was at
length restored; and, to tell the truth, the only hurts inflicted were
those which came from the special constables.Bully Bluck and Magog
Wrath, with all their fierce looks, flaunting colours, loud cheers, and
desperate assaults, were, after all, only a couple of Condottieri, who
were cautious never to wound each other.They were, in fact, a peaceful
police, who kept the town in awe, and prevented others from being
mischievous who were more inclined to do harm.Their hired gangs were
the safety-valves for all the scamps of the borough, who, receiving a
few shillings per head for their nominal service, and as much drink as
they liked after the contest, were bribed and organised into peace
and sobriety on the days in which their excesses were most to be
apprehended.Millbank came forward: he was brief compared with Mr.Rigby; but
clear and terse.He did not favour his
hearers with any history, but gave them his views about taxes, free
trade, placemen, and pensioners, whoever and wherever they might be.'Hilloa, Rigby, about that 'ere pension?''Never mind, Rigby, you'll come in next time.'Millbank was energetic about resident representatives, but did not
understand that a resident representative meant the nominee of a great
Lord, who lived in a great castle; great cheering.There was a Lord
once who declared that, if he liked, he would return his <DW64> valet to
Parliament; but Mr.It remained
for the people of Darlford to determine whether he was mistaken.No
<DW65>s, no walets!''His language ain't as purty as the Lunnun chap's,' said a critic below;
'but he speaks from his 'art: and give me the man who 'as got a 'art.''That's your time of day, Mr.'Now, the Queen and Millbank
for ever!The show of hands was entirely in favour of Mr.Scarcely a
hand was held up for Mr.Rigby below, except by Bully Bluck and his
praetorians.The Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Conservative
Association, the Secretary, and the four agents, severally and
respectively went up to Mr.Rigby and congratulated him on the result,
as it was a known fact, 'that the show of hands never won.'The eve of polling-day was now at hand.This is the most critical period
of an election.All night parties in disguise were perambulating the
different wards, watching each other's tactics; masks, wigs, false
noses, gentles in livery coats, men in female attire, a silent carnival
of manoeuvre, vigilance, anxiety, and trepidation.The thoughtful voters
about this time make up their minds; the enthusiasts who have told you
twenty times a-day for the last fortnight, that they would get up in the
middle of the night to serve you, require the most watchful cooping; all
the individuals who have assured you that 'their word is their bond,'
change sides.Two of the Rigbyites met in the market-place about an hour after
midnight.The blunt's going like the ward-pump.I saw
a man come out of Moffatt's house, muffled up with a mask on.'You don't mean that, do you?D----e, I'll answer for Moffatt.''I never thought he was a true man.''I could not see him; but I met young Gunning and told him.''I thought he was as right as the town clock.'The enemy, Franklin and Sampson
Potts.'Well, I hope the best man will win.''You must go for Moffatt early, to breakfast at the White Lion; that's
your sort.Don't leave him, and poll him your-self.I am going off to
Solomon Lacey's.He has got four Millbankites cooped up very drunk, and
I want to get them quietly into the country before daybreak.'The candidates are roused from their slumbers at an
early hour by the music of their own bands perambulating the town, and
each playing the 'conquering hero' to sustain the courage of their jaded
employers, by depriving them of that rest which can alone tranquillise
the nervous system.There is something in that matin burst of music,
followed by a shrill cheer from the boys of the borough, the only
inhabitants yet up, that is very depressing.The committee-rooms of each candidate are soon rife with black reports;
each side has received fearful bulletins of the preceding night
campaign; and its consequences as exemplified in the morning,
unprecedented tergiversations, mysterious absences; men who breakfast
with one side and vote with the other; men who won't come to breakfast;
men who won't leave breakfast.Rigby was in a majority of twenty-eight.The polling was brisk and equal until the middle of the day, when it
became slack.Rigby kept a majority, but an inconsiderable one.Millbank's friends were not disheartened, as it was known that
the leading members of Mr.Rigby's committee had polled; whereas his
opponent's were principally reserved.At a quarter-past two there was
great cheering and uproar.The four voters in favour of Millbank, whom
Solomon Lacey had cooped up, made drunk, and carried into the country,
had recovered iheir senses, made their escape, and voted as they
originally intended.Millbank was declared by his
committee to be in a majority of one, but the committee of Mr.Rigby
instantly posted a placard, in large letters, to announce that, on the
contrary, their man was in a majority of nine.'If we could only have got another registration,' whispered the
principal agent to Mr.Rigby, at a quarter-past four.'You think it's all over, then?''Why, I do not see now how we can win.We have polled all our dead men,
and Millbank is seven ahead.''I have no doubt we shall be able to have a good petition,' said the
consoling chairman of the Conservative Association.CHAPTER V.


It was not with feelings of extreme satisfaction that Mr.The loss of Hellingsley, followed by the loss of the borough
to Hellingsley's successful master, were not precisely the incidents
which would be adduced as evidence of Mr.Rigby's good management or
good fortune.Hitherto that gentleman had persuaded the world that he
was not only very clever, but that he was also always in luck; a quality
which many appreciate more even than capacity.His reputation was
unquestionably damaged, both with his patron and his party.But what
the Tapers and the Tadpoles thought or said, what even might be the
injurious effect on his own career of the loss of this election, assumed
an insignificant character when compared with its influence on the
temper and disposition of the Marquess of Monmouth.And yet his carriage is now entering the courtyard of Monmouth House,
and, in all probability, a few minutes would introduce him to that
presence before which he had, ere this, trembled.The Marquess was at
home, and anxious to see Mr.In a few minutes that gentleman was
ascending the private staircase, entering the antechamber, and waiting
to be received in the little saloon, exactly as our Coningsby did more
than five years ago, scarcely less agitated, but by feelings of a very
different character.'Well, you made a good fight of it,' exclaimed the Marquess, in a
cheerful and cordial tone, as Mr.This reception instantly reassured the defeated candidate, though its
contrast to that which he expected rather perplexed him.He entered into
the details of the election, talked rapidly of the next registration,
the propriety of petitioning; accustomed himself to hearing his voice
with its habitual volubility in a chamber where he had feared it might
not sound for some time.'These fellows are in for this
Parliament, and I am really weary of the whole affair.I begin to think
the Duke was right, and it would have been best to have left them to
themselves.I am glad you have come up at once, for I want you.The fact
is, I am going to be married.'Rigby; he was prepared for
it, though scarcely could have hoped that he would have been favoured
with it on the present occasion, instead of a morose comment on his
misfortunes.Marriage, then, was the predominant idea of Lord Monmouth
at the present moment, in whose absorbing interest all vexations were
forgotten.Disgusted by the failure of his political
combinations, his disappointments in not dictating to the county and not
carrying the borough, and the slight prospect at present of obtaining
the great object of his ambition, Lord Monmouth had resolved to
precipitate his fate, was about to marry immediately, and quit England.'You will be wanted, Rigby,' continued the Marquess.'We must have a
couple of trustees, and I have thought of you as one.You know you are
my executor; and it is better not to bring in unnecessarily new names
into the management of my affairs.Rigby then, after all, was a lucky man.After such a succession of
failures, he had returned only to receive fresh and the most delicate
marks of his patron's good feeling and consideration.Lord Monmouth's
trustee and executor!It
ought to be blazoned in letters of gold in the most conspicuous part of
Rigby's library, to remind him perpetually of his great and impending
destiny.Lord Monmouth's executor, and very probably one of his
residuary legatees!A legatee of some sort he knew he was.What a
splendid _memento mori_!What cared Rigby for the borough of Darlford?And as for his political friends, he wished them joy of their barren
benches.Nothing was lost by not being in this Parliament.It was then with sincerity that Rigby offered his congratulations to
his patron.He praised the judicious alliance, accompanied by every
circumstance conducive to worldly happiness; distinguished beauty,
perfect temper, princely rank.Rigby, who had hardly got out of his
hustings' vein, was most eloquent in his praises of Madame Colonna.'An amiable woman,' said Lord Monmouth, 'and very handsome.I always
admired her; and an agreeable person too; I dare say a very good temper,
but I am not going to marry her.''Might I then ask who is--'

'Her step-daughter, the Princess Lucretia,' replied the Marquess,
quietly, and looking at his ring.He had been
working all this time for the wrong woman!The consciousness of being a
trustee alone sustained him.The Marquess
would not speak however, and Rigby must.He babbled rather incoherently
about the Princess Lucretia being admired by everybody; also that she
was the most fortunate of women, as well as the most accomplished; he
was just beginning to say he had known her from a child, when discretion
stopped his tongue, which had a habit of running on somewhat rashly;
but Rigby, though he often blundered in his talk, had the talent of
extricating himself from the consequence of his mistakes.'And Madame must be highly gratified by all this?'Rigby,
with an enquiring accent.He was dying to learn how she had first
received the intelligence, and congratulated himself that his absence at
his contest had preserved him from the storm.'Madame Colonna knows nothing of our intentions,' said Lord Monmouth.'And by the bye, that is the very business on which I wish to see you,
Rigby.We are to be married,
and immediately.It would gratify me that the wife of Lucretia's father
should attend our wedding.You understand exactly what I mean, Rigby; I
must have no scenes.Always happy to see the Princess Colonna under my
roof; but then I like to live quietly, particularly at present;
harassed as I have been by the loss of these elections, by all this bad
management, and by all these disappointments on subjects in which I was
led to believe success was certain.Madame Colonna is at home;' and the
Marquess bowed Mr.The departure of Sidonia from Coningsby Castle, in the autumn,
determined the Princess Lucretia on a step which had for some time
before his arrival occupied her brooding imagination.Nature had
bestowed on this lady an ambitious soul and a subtle spirit; she could
dare much and could execute finely.Above all things she coveted power;
and though not free from the characteristic susceptibility of her sex,
the qualities that could engage her passions or fascinate her fancy must
partake of that intellectual eminence which distinguished her.Though
the Princess Lucretia in a short space of time had seen much of the
world, she had as yet encountered no hero.In the admirers whom her
rank, and sometimes her intelligence, assembled around her, her master
had not yet appeared.Her heart had not trembled before any of those
brilliant forms whom she was told her sex admired; nor did she envy any
one the homage which she did not appreciate.There was, therefore, no
disturbing element in the worldly calculations which she applied to that
question which is, to woman, what a career is to man, the question of
marriage.She would marry to gain power, and therefore she wished to
marry the powerful.Lord Eskdale hovered around her, and she liked
him.She admired his incomparable shrewdness; his freedom from ordinary
prejudices; his selfishness which was always good-natured, and the
imperturbability that was not callous.But Lord Eskdale had hovered
round many; it was his easy habit.He liked clever women, young, but who
had seen something of the world.The Princess Lucretia pleased him much;
with the form and mind of a woman even in the nursery.He had watched
her development with interest; and had witnessed her launch in that
world where she floated at once with as much dignity and consciousness
of superior power, as if she had braved for seasons its waves and its
tempests.Musing over Lord Eskdale, the mind of Lucretia was drawn to the image
of his friend; her friend; the friend of her parents.There was something great in the
conception; difficult and strange.The result, if achieved, would give
her all that she desired.She concentrated her intellect on one point,
and that was to fascinate the grandfather of Coningsby, while her
step-mother was plotting that she should marry his grandson.The
volition of Lucretia Colonna was, if not supreme, of a power most
difficult to resist.There was something charm-like and alluring in the
conversation of one who was silent to all others; something in the tones
of her low rich voice which acted singularly on the nervous system.It
was the voice of the serpent; indeed, there was an undulating movement
in Lucretia, when she approached you, which irresistibly reminded you of
that mysterious animal.Lord Monmouth was not insensible to the spell, though totally
unconscious of its purpose.He found the society of Lucretia very
agreeable to him; she was animated, intelligent, original; her inquiries
were stimulating; her comments on what she saw, and heard, and read,
racy and often indicating a fine humour.But all this was reserved for
his ear.Before her parents, as before all others, Lucretia was silent,
a little scornful, never communicating, neither giving nor seeking
amusement, shut up in herself.Lord Monmouth fell therefore into the habit of riding and driving with
Lucretia alone.It was an arrangement which he found made his life more
pleasant.Nor was it displeasing to Madame Colonna.She looked upon
Lord Monmouth's fancy for Lucretia as a fresh tie for them all.Even the
Prince, when his wife called his attention to the circumstance, observed
it with satisfaction.It was a circumstance which represented in his
mind a continuance of good eating and good drinking, fine horses,
luxurious baths, unceasing billiards.In this state of affairs appeared Sidonia, known before to her
step-mother, but seen by Lucretia for the first time.Truly, he came,
saw, and conquered.Those eyes that rarely met another's were fixed upon
his searching yet unimpassioned glance.She listened to that voice,
full of music yet void of tenderness; and the spirit of Lucretia Colonna
bowed before an intelligence that commanded sympathy, yet offered none.Lucretia naturally possessed great qualities as well as great talents.Under a genial influence, her education might have formed a being
capable of imparting and receiving happiness.Her father offered her no love; her step-mother gained
from her no respect.Her literary education was the result of her
own strong mind and inquisitive spirit.She valued knowledge, and she
therefore acquired it.But not a single moral principle or a single
religious truth had ever been instilled into her being.Frequent
absence from her own country had by degrees broken off even an habitual
observance of the forms of her creed; while a life of undisturbed
indulgence, void of all anxiety and care, while it preserved her from
many of the temptations to vice, deprived her of that wisdom'more
precious than rubies,' which adversity and affliction, the struggles and
the sorrows of existence, can alone impart.Lucretia had passed her life in a refined, but rather dissolute society.Not indeed that a word that could call forth a maiden blush, conduct
that could pain the purest feelings, could be heard or witnessed in
those polished and luxurious circles.The most exquisite taste pervaded
their atmosphere; and the uninitiated who found themselves in those
perfumed chambers and those golden saloons, might believe, from all that
passed before them, that their inhabitants were as pure, as orderly, and
as irreproachable as their furniture.But among the habitual dwellers
in these delicate halls there was a tacit understanding, a
prevalent doctrine that required no formal exposition, no proofs and
illustrations, no comment and no gloss; which was indeed rather a
traditional conviction than an imparted dogma; that the exoteric public
were, on many subjects, the victims of very vulgar prejudices, which
these enlightened personages wished neither to disturb nor to adopt.A being of such a temper, bred in such a manner; a woman full
of intellect and ambition, daring and lawless, and satiated with
prosperity, is not made for equable fortunes and an uniform existence.She would have sacrificed the world for Sidonia, for he had touched
the fervent imagination that none before could approach; but that
inscrutable man would not read the secret of her heart; and prompted
alike by pique, the love of power, and a weariness of her present life,
Lucretia resolved on that great result which Mr.Rigby is now about to
communicate to the Princess Colonna.Rigby had entered that lady's apartments
it seemed that all the bells of Monmouth House were ringing at the same
time.The sound even reached the Marquess in his luxurious recess; who
immediately took a pinch of snuff, and ordered his valet to lock the
door of the ante-chamber.The Princess Lucretia, too, heard the sounds;
she was lying on a sofa, in her boudoir, reading the _Inferno_, and
immediately mustered her garrison in the form of a French maid, and gave
directions that no one should be admitted.Both the Marquess and
his intended bride felt that a crisis was at hand, and resolved to
participate in no scenes.Then there was another
ring; a short, hasty, and violent pull; followed by some slamming of
doors.The servants, who were all on the alert, and had advantages
of hearing and observation denied to their secluded master, caught a
glimpse of Mr.Rigby endeavouring gently to draw back into her apartment
Madame Colonna, furious amid his deprecatory exclamations.'For heaven's sake, my dear Madame; for your own sake; now really; now
I assure you; you are quite wrong; you are indeed; it is a complete
misapprehension; I will explain everything.I entreat, I implore,
whatever you like, just what you please; only listen.'Then the lady, with a mantling visage and flashing eye, violently
closing the door, was again lost to their sight.A few minutes after
there was a moderate ring, and Mr.Rigby, coming out of the apartments,
with his cravat a little out of order, as if he had had a violent
shaking, met the servant who would have entered.'Order Madame Colonna's travelling carriage,' he exclaimed in a loud
voice, 'and send Mademoiselle Conrad here directly.I don't think the
fellow hears me,' added Mr.Rigby, and following the servant, he added
in a low tone and with a significant glance, 'no travelling carriage; no
Mademoiselle Conrad; order the britska round as usual.'Nearly another hour passed; there was another ring; very moderate
indeed.The servant was informed that Madame Colonna was coming down,
and she appeared as usual.In a beautiful morning dress, and leaning on
the arm of Mr.Rigby, she descended the stairs, and was handed into her
carriage by that gentleman, who, seating himself by her side, ordered
them to drive to Richmond.Lord Monmouth having been informed that all was calm, and that Madame
Colonna, attended by Mr.Rigby, had gone to Richmond, ordered his
carriage, and accompanied by Lucretia and Lucian Gay, departed
immediately for Blackwall, where, in whitebait, a quiet bottle of
claret, the society of his agreeable friends, and the contemplation of
the passing steamers, he found a mild distraction and an amusing repose.Rigby reported that evening to the Marquess on his return, that all
was arranged and tranquil.Perhaps he exaggerated the difficulties,
to increase the service; but according to his account they were
considerable.It required some time to make Madame Colonna comprehend
the nature of his communication.All Rigby's diplomatic skill was
expended in the gradual development.When it was once fairly put before
her, the effect was appalling.That was the first great ringing of
bells.Rigby softened a little what he had personally endured; but
he confessed she sprang at him like a tigress balked of her prey, and
poured forth on him a volume of epithets, many of which Rigby
really deserved.But after all, in the present instance, he was not
treacherous, only base, which he always was.Then she fell into a
passion of tears, and vowed frequently that she was not weeping for
herself, but only for that dear Mr.Coningsby, who had been treated so
infamously and robbed of Lucretia, and whose heart she knew must break.It seemed that Rigby stemmed the first violence of her emotion by
mysterious intimations of an important communication that he had to
make; and piquing her curiosity, he calmed her passion.But really
having nothing to say, he was nearly involved in fresh dangers.He took
refuge in the affectation of great agitation which prevented exposition.The lady then insisted on her travelling carriage being ordered and
packed, as she was determined to set out for Rome that afternoon.This
little occurrence gave Rigby some few minutes to collect himself, at
the end of which he made the Princess several announcements of intended
arrangements, all of which pleased her mightily, though they were so
inconsistent with each other, that if she had not been a woman in a
passion, she must have detected that Rigby was lying.He assured her
almost in the same breath, that she was never to be separated from them,
and that she was to have any establishment in any country she liked.He
talked wildly of equipages, diamonds, shawls, opera-boxes; and while
her mind was bewildered with these dazzling objects, he, with intrepid
gravity, consulted her as to the exact amount she would like to have
apportioned, independent of her general revenue, for the purposes of
charity.At the end of two hours, exhausted by her rage and soothed by these
visions, Madame Colonna having grown calm and reasonable, sighed and
murmured a complaint, that Lord Monmouth ought to have communicated this
important intelligence in person.Upon this Rigby instantly assured
her, that Lord Monmouth had been for some time waiting to do so, but
in consequence of her lengthened interview with Rigby, his Lordship had
departed for Richmond with Lucretia, where he hoped that Madame Colonna
and Mr.So it ended, with a morning drive and
suburban dinner; Rigby, after what he had gone through, finding no
difficulty in accounting for the other guests not being present, and
bringing home Madame Colonna in the evening, at times almost as gay and
good-tempered as usual, and almost oblivious of her disappointment.When the Marquess met Madame Colonna he embraced her with great
courtliness, and from that time consulted her on every arrangement.He
took a very early occasion of presenting her with a diamond necklace of
great value.The Marquess was fond of making presents to persons to whom
he thought he had not behaved very well, and who yet spared him scenes.The marriage speedily followed, by special license, at the villa of the
Right Hon.Nicholas Rigby, who gave away the bride.The wedding was very
select, but brilliant as the diamond necklace: a royal Duke and Duchess,
Lady St.Ormsby presented the bride with
a bouquet of precious stones, and Lord Eskdale with a French fan in
a diamond frame.It was a fine day; Lord Monmouth, calm as if he were
winning the St.Leger; Lucretia, universally recognised as a beauty; all
the guests gay, the Princess Colonna especially.The travelling carriage is at the door which is to bear away the happy
pair.Madame Colonna embraces Lucretia; the Marquess gives a grand bow:
they are gone.A Prince of the blood will
propose a toast; there is another glass of champagne quaffed, another
ortolan devoured; and then they rise and disperse.Madame Colonna leaves
with Lady St.Julians, whose guest for a while she is to become.And in
a few minutes their host is alone.Rigby retired into his library: the repose of the chamber must
have been grateful to his feelings after all this distraction.It was
spacious, well-stored, classically adorned, and opened on a beautiful
lawn.Rigby threw himself into an ample chair, crossed his legs, and
resting his head on his arm, apparently fell into deep contemplation.He had some cause for reflection, and though we did once venture to
affirm that Rigby never either thought or felt, this perhaps may be the
exception that proves the rule.He could scarcely refrain from pondering over the strange event which he
had witnessed, and at which he had assisted.It was an incident that might exercise considerable influence over his
fortunes.His patron married, and married to one who certainly did
not offer to Mr.Rigby such a prospect of easy management as her
step-mother!Here were new influences arising; new characters, new
situations, new contingencies.He suddenly
jumps up, hurries to a shelf and takes down a volume.It is his
interleaved peerage, of which for twenty years he had been threatening
an edition.Turning to the Marquisate of Monmouth, he took up his pen
and thus made the necessary entry:

'_Married, second time, August 3rd, 1837, The Princess Lucretia Colonna,
daughter of Prince Paul Colonna, born at Rome, February 16th, 1819._'

That was what Mr.There was not a
peerage-compiler in England who had that date save himself.Before we close this slight narrative of the domestic incidents that
occurred in the family of his grandfather since Coningsby quitted the
Castle, we must not forget to mention what happened to Villebecque and
Flora.Lord Monmouth took a great liking to the manager.He found him
very clever in many things independently of his profession; he was
useful to Lord Monmouth, and did his work in an agreeable manner.And
the future Lady Monmouth was accustomed to Flora, and found her useful
too, and did not like to lose her.And so the Marquess, turning all the
circumstances in his mind, and being convinced that Villebecque could
never succeed to any extent in England in his profession, and probably
nowhere else, appointed him, to Villebecque's infinite satisfaction,
intendant of his household, with a considerable salary, while Flora
still lived with her kind step-father.Another year elapsed; not so fruitful in incidents to Coningsby as the
preceding ones, and yet not unprofitably passed.It had been spent in
the almost unremitting cultivation of his intelligence.He had read
deeply and extensively, digested his acquisitions, and had practised
himself in surveying them, free from those conventional conclusions
and those traditionary inferences that surrounded him.Although he had
renounced his once cherished purpose of trying for University honours,
an aim which he found discordant with the investigations on which his
mind was bent, he had rarely quitted Cambridge.The society of his
friends, the great convenience of public libraries, and the general
tone of studious life around, rendered an University for him a genial
residence.There is a moment in life, when the pride and thirst of
knowledge seem to absorb our being, and so it happened now to Coningsby,
who felt each day stronger in his intellectual resources, and each day
more anxious and avid to increase them.The habits of public
discussion fostered by the Debating Society were also for Coningsby no
Inconsiderable tie to the University.This was the arena in which he
felt himself at home.The promise of his Eton days was here fulfilled.And while his friends listened to his sustained argument or his
impassioned declamation, the prompt reply or the apt retort, they looked
forward with pride through the vista of years to the time when the hero
of the youthful Club should convince or dazzle in the senate.It is
probable then that he would have remained at Cambridge with slight
intervals until he had taken his degree, had not circumstances occurred
which gave altogether a new turn to his thoughts.When Lord Monmouth had fixed his wedding-day he had written himself
to Coningsby to announce his intended marriage, and to request his
grandson's presence at the ceremony.The letter was more than kind; it
was warm and generous.He assured his grandson that this alliance
should make no difference in the very ample provision which he had
long intended for him; that he should ever esteem Coningsby his
nearest relative; and that, while his death would bring to Coningsby as
considerable an independence as an English gentleman need desire, so
in his lifetime Coningsby should ever be supported as became his birth,
breeding, and future prospects.Lord Monmouth had mentioned to Lucretia,
that he was about to invite his grandson to their wedding, and the lady
had received the intimation with satisfaction.It so happened that a
few hours after, Lucretia, who now entered the private rooms of Lord
Monmouth without previously announcing her arrival, met Villebecque with
the letter to Coningsby in his hand.Lucretia took it away from him,
and said it should be posted with her own letters.Our friend learnt the marriage from the newspapers, which
somewhat astounded him; but Coningsby was fond of his grandfather, and
he wrote Lord Monmouth a letter of congratulation, full of feeling and
ingenuousness, and which, while it much pleased the person to whom it
was addressed, unintentionally convinced him that Coningsby had never
received his original communication.Lord Monmouth spoke to Villebecque,
who could throw sufficient light upon the subject, but it was never
mentioned to Lady Monmouth.The Marquess was a man who always found out
everything, and enjoyed the secret.Rather more than a year after the marriage, when Coningsby had completed
his twenty-first year, the year which he had passed so quietly at
Cambridge, he received a letter from his grandfather, informing him that
after a variety of movements Lady Monmouth and himself were established
in Paris for the season, and desiring that he would not fail to come
over as soon as practicable, and pay them as long a visit as the
regulations of the University would permit.So, at the close of the
December term, Coningsby quitted Cambridge for Paris.Passing through London, he made his first visit to his banker at Charing
Cross, on whom he had periodically drawn since he commenced his college
life.He was in the outer counting-house, making some inquiries about a
letter of credit, when one of the partners came out from an inner room,
and invited him to enter.This firm had been for generations the bankers
of the Coningsby family; and it appeared that there was a sealed box
in their possession, which had belonged to the father of Coningsby, and
they wished to take this opportunity of delivering it to his son.This
communication deeply interested him; and as he was alone in London, at
an hotel, and on the wing for a foreign country, he requested permission
at once to examine it, in order that he might again deposit it with
them: so he was shown into a private room for that purpose.The seal was
broken; the box was full of papers, chiefly correspondence: among them
was a packet described as letters from'my dear Helen,' the mother of
Coningsby.In the interior of this packet there was a miniature of that
mother.He looked at it; put it down; looked at it again and again.There was the same blue fillet in the bright
hair.It was an exact copy of that portrait which had so greatly excited
his attention when at Millbank!This was a mysterious and singularly
perplexing incident.He was alone in the room
when he made the discovery.When he had recovered himself, he sealed up
the contents of the box, with the exception of his mother's letters and
the miniature, which he took away with him, and then re-delivered it to
his banker for custody until his return.Coningsby found Lord and Lady Monmouth in a splendid hotel in the
Faubourg St.His grandfather looked at
him with marked attention, and received him with evident satisfaction.Indeed, Lord Monmouth was greatly pleased that Harry had come to Paris;
it was the University of the World, where everybody should graduate.Paris and London ought to be the great objects of all travellers; the
rest was mere landscape.It cannot be denied that between Lucretia and Coningsby there existed
from the first a certain antipathy; and though circumstances for a short
time had apparently removed or modified the aversion, the manner of the
lady when Coningsby was ushered into her boudoir, resplendent with all
that Parisian taste and luxury could devise, was characterised by that
frigid politeness which had preceded the days of their more genial
acquaintance.If the manner of Lucretia were the same as before her
marriage, a considerable change might however be observed in her
appearance.Her fine form had become more developed; while her dress,
that she once neglected, was elaborate and gorgeous, and of the last
mode.Lucretia was the fashion of Paris; a great lady, greatly admired.A guest under such a roof, however, Coningsby was at once launched
into the most brilliant circles of Parisian society, which he found
fascinating.The art of society is, without doubt, perfectly comprehended and
completely practised in the bright metropolis of France.An Englishman
cannot enter a saloon without instantly feeling he is among a race more
social than his compatriots.What, for example, is more consummate
than the manner in which a French lady receives her guests!She unites
graceful repose and unaffected dignity, with the most amiable regard for
others.She sees every one; she speaks to every one; she sees them at
the right moment; she says the right thing; it is utterly impossible
to detect any difference in the position of her guests by the spirit in
which she welcomes them.There is, indeed, throughout every circle of
Parisian society, from the chateau to the cabaret, a sincere homage to
intellect; and this without any maudlin sentiment.None sooner than
the Parisians can draw the line between factitious notoriety and honest
fame; or sooner distinguished between the counterfeit celebrity and
the standard reputation.In England, we too often alternate between a
supercilious neglect of genius and a rhapsodical pursuit of quacks.In
England when a new character appears in our circles, the first question
always is, 'Who is he?'In France it is, 'What is he?'In England, 'How
much a-year?'About a week after Coningsby's arrival in Paris, as he was sauntering on
the soft and sunny Boulevards, soft and sunny though Christmas, he met
Sidonia.'Turn now with me, for I see you are
only lounging, and tell me when you came, where you are, and what you
have done since we parted.I have been here myself but a few days.'And when Coningsby had rapidly related all that
had passed, they talked of Paris.Sidonia had offered him hospitality,
until he learned that Lord Monmouth was in Paris, and that Coningsby was
his guest.'I am sorry you cannot come to me,' he remarked; 'I would have shown you
everybody and everything.'I have already seen many remarkable things,' said Coningsby; 'and met
many celebrated persons.Nothing strikes me more in this brilliant
city than the tone of its society, so much higher than our own.How much conversation, and how little
gossip!Here all women are as
agreeable as is the remarkable privilege in London of some half-dozen.Men too, and great men, develop their minds.A great man in England,
on the contrary, is generally the dullest dog in company.And yet, how
piteous to think that so fair a civilisation should be in such imminent
peril!'that is a common opinion: and yet I am somewhat sceptical of
its truth,' replied Sidonia.'I am inclined to believe that the social
system of England is in infinitely greater danger than that of France.We must not be misled by the agitated surface of this country.The
foundations of its order are deep and sure.France is a kingdom with a Republic for its capital.It has been always
so, for centuries.From the days of the League to the days of the
Sections, to the days of 1830.It is still France, little changed; and
only more national, for it is less Frank and more Gallic; as England has
become less Norman and more Saxon.''And it is your opinion, then, that the present King may maintain
himself?''Every movement in this country, however apparently discordant, seems to
tend to that inevitable end.He would not be on the throne if the nature
of things had not demanded his presence.The Kingdom of France required
a Monarch; the Republic of Paris required a Dictator.He comprised in
his person both qualifications; lineage and intellect; blood for the
provinces, brains for the city.''Tell me,'
he added, eagerly, 'what is he?This Prince of whom one hears in all
countries at all hours; on whose existence we are told the tranquillity,
almost the civilisation, of Europe depends, yet of whom we receive
accounts so conflicting, so contradictory; tell me, you who can tell me,
tell me what he is.''I have a creed of mine own,' he
remarked, 'that the great characters of antiquity are at rare epochs
reproduced for our wonder, or our guidance.Nature, wearied
with mediocrity, pours the warm metal into an heroic mould.When
circumstances at length placed me in the presence of the King of France,
I recognised, ULYSSES!''But is there no danger,' resumed Coningsby, after the pause of a few
moments, 'that the Republic of Paris may absorb the Kingdom of France?''I suspect the reverse,' replied Sidonia.'The tendency of advanced
civilisation is in truth to pure Monarchy.Monarchy is indeed a
government which requires a high degree of civilisation for its full
development.It needs the support of free laws and manners, and of
a widely-diffused intelligence.Political compromises are not to be
tolerated except at periods of rude transition.An educated nation
recoils from the imperfect vicariate of what is called a representative
government.Your House of Commons, that has absorbed all other powers
in the State, will in all probability fall more rapidly than it rose.Public opinion has a more direct, a more comprehensive, a more efficient
organ for its utterance, than a body of men sectionally chosen.The
Printing-press is a political element unknown to classic or feudal
times.It absorbs in a great degree the duties of the Sovereign, the
Priest, the Parliament; it controls, it educates, it discusses.That
public opinion, when it acts, would appear in the form of one who has no
class interests.In an enlightened age the Monarch on the throne, free
from the vulgar prejudices and the corrupt interests of the subject,
becomes again divine!'At this moment they reached that part of the Boulevards which leads into
the Place of the Madeleine, whither Sidonia was bound; and Coningsby was
about to quit his companion, when Sidonia said:

'I am only going a step over to the Rue Tronchet to say a few words to a
friend of mine, M. P----s. I shall not detain you five minutes; and you
should know him, for he has some capital pictures, and a collection of
Limoges ware that is the despair of the dilettanti.'So saying they turned down by the Place of the Madeleine, and soon
entered the court of the hotel of M. P----s. That gentleman received
them in his gallery.After some general conversation, Coningsby turned
towards the pictures, and left Sidonia with their host.The collection
was rare, and interested Coningsby, though unacquainted with art.He
sauntered on from picture to picture until he reached the end of the
gallery, where an open door invited him into a suite of rooms also
full of pictures and objects of curiosity and art.As he was entering
a second chamber, he observed a lady leaning back in a cushioned
chair, and looking earnestly on a picture.His entrance was unheard and
unnoticed, for the lady's back was to the door; yet Coningsby, advancing
in an angular direction, obtained nearly a complete view of her
countenance.It was upraised, gazing on the picture with an expression
of delight; the bonnet thrown back, while the large sable cloak of the
gazer had fallen partly off.The countenance was more beautiful than the
beautiful picture.Those glowing shades of the gallery to which love,
and genius, and devotion had lent their inspiration, seemed without
life and lustre by the radiant expression and expressive presence which
Coningsby now beheld.The finely-arched brow was a little elevated, the soft dark eyes were
fully opened, the nostril of the delicate nose slightly dilated, the
small, yet rich, full lips just parted; and over the clear, transparent
visage, there played a vivid glance of gratified intelligence.The lady rose, advanced towards the picture, looked at it earnestly for
a few moments, and then, turning in a direction opposite to Coningsby,
walked away.She was somewhat above the middle stature, and yet could
scarcely be called tall; a quality so rare, that even skilful dancers
do not often possess it, was hers; that elastic gait that is so winning,
and so often denotes the gaiety and quickness of the spirit.The fair object of his observation had advanced into other chambers,
and as soon as it was becoming, Coningsby followed her.She had joined a
lady and gentleman, who were examining an ancient carving in ivory.The
gentleman was middle-aged and portly; the elder lady tall and elegant,
and with traces of interesting beauty.Coningsby heard her speak; the
words were English, but the accent not of a native.In the remotest part of the room, Coningsby, apparently engaged in
examining some of that famous Limoges ware of which Sidonia had spoken,
watched with interest and intentness the beautiful being whom he had
followed, and whom he concluded to be the child of her companions.After
some little time, they quitted the apartment on their return to the
gallery; Coningsby remained behind, caring for none of the rare and
fanciful objects that surrounded him, yet compelled, from the fear of
seeming obtrusive, for some minutes to remain.Then he too returned
to the gallery, and just as he had gained its end, he saw the portly
gentleman in the distance shaking hands with Sidonia, the ladies
apparently expressing their thanks and gratification to M. P----s, and
then all vanishing by the door through which Coningsby had originally
entered.said M. P----s, as Coningsby
approached him.I am glad to hear it; I have been admiring
her,' he replied.'Yes,' said M. P----s, 'it is Sir Wallinger: one of your deputies; don't
you know him?'said Coningsby, 'no, I have not that honour.''Sir Joseph Wallinger,' said Sidonia, 'one of the new Whig baronets,
and member for ----.That is not his
daughter, but his niece; the child of his wife's sister.It is not easy
to find any one more beautiful.'END OF BOOK V.




BOOK VI.CHAPTER I.


The knowledge that Sidonia was in Paris greatly agitated Lady Monmouth.She received the intimation indeed from Coningsby at dinner with
sufficient art to conceal her emotion.Lord Monmouth himself was quite
pleased at the announcement.Sidonia was his especial favourite; he knew
so much, had such an excellent judgment, and was so rich.He had always
something to tell you, was the best man in the world to bet on, and
never wanted anything.A perfect character according to the Monmouth
ethics.In the evening of the day that Coningsby met Sidonia, Lady Monmouth made
a little visit to the charming Duchess de G----t who was 'at home'
every other night in her pretty hotel, with its embroidered white satin
draperies, its fine old cabinets, and ancestral portraits of famous
name, brave marshals and bright princesses of the olden time, on its
walls.These receptions without form, yet full of elegance, are what
English 'at homes' were before the Continental war, though now, by a
curious perversion of terms, the easy domestic title distinguishes in
England a formally-prepared and elaborately-collected assembly, in which
everything and every person are careful to be as little 'homely' as
possible.In France, on the contrary, 'tis on these occasions, and in
this manner, that society carries on that degree and kind of intercourse
which in England we attempt awkwardly to maintain by the medium of
that unpopular species of visitation styled a morning call; which all
complain that they have either to make or to endure.Nowhere was this species of reception more happily conducted than at
the Duchess de G----t's.The rooms, though small, decorated with taste,
brightly illumined; a handsome and gracious hostess, the Duke the very
pearl of gentlemen, and sons and daughters worthy of such parents.Every
moment some one came in, and some one went away.In your way from a
dinner to a ball, you stopped to exchange agreeable _on dits_.It seemed
that every woman was pretty, every man a wit.Sure you were to find
yourself surrounded by celebrities, and men were welcomed there, if they
were clever, before they were famous, which showed it was a house that
regarded intellect, and did not seek merely to gratify its vanity by
being surrounded by the distinguished.Enveloped in a rich Indian shawl, and leaning back on a sofa, Lady
Monmouth was engaged in conversation with the courtly and classic Count
M----e, when, on casually turning her head, she observed entering the
saloon, Sidonia.She just caught his form bowing to the Duchess, and
instantly turned her head and replunged into her conversation with
increased interest.Sandra went to the garden.Lady Monmouth was a person who had the power of
seeing all about her, everything and everybody, without appearing to
look.She was conscious that Sidonia was approaching her neighbourhood.Her heart beat in tumult; she dreaded to catch the eye of that very
individual whom she was so anxious to meet.Instinctively, Lady Monmouth turned from the Count, and began
speaking earnestly to her other neighbour, a young daughter of the
house, innocent and beautiful, not yet quite fledged, trying her wings
in society under the maternal eye.She was surprised by the extreme
interest which her grand neighbour suddenly took in all her pursuits,
her studies, her daily walks in the Bois de Boulogne.Sidonia, as the
Marchioness had anticipated, had now reached the sofa.But no, it was to
the Count, and not to Lady Monmouth that he was advancing; and they were
immediately engaged in conversation.After some little time, when she
had become accustomed to his voice, and found her own heart throbbing
with less violence, Lucretia turned again, as if by accident, to the
Count, and met the glance of Sidonia.She meant to have received him
with haughtiness, but her self-command deserted her; and slightly rising
from the sofa, she welcomed him with a countenance of extreme pallor and
with some awkwardness.His manner was such as might have assisted her, even had she been more
troubled.It was marked by a degree of respectful friendliness.He
expressed without reserve his pleasure at meeting her again; inquired
much how she had passed her time since they last parted; asked more than
once after the Marquess.The Count moved away; Sidonia took his seat.She expressed to
him how kind her Lord would consider his society, for the Marquess had
suffered in health since Sidonia last saw him.His periodical gout had
left him, which made him ill and nervous.The Marquess received his
friends at dinner every day.Sidonia, particularly amiable, offered
himself as a guest for the following one.'And do you go to the great ball to-morrow?'inquired Lucretia,
delighted with all that had occurred.'I always go to their balls,' said Sidonia, 'I have promised.'There was a momentary pause; Lucretia happier than she had been for a
long time, her face a little flushed, and truly in a secret tumult of
sweet thoughts, remembered she had been long there, and offering her
hand to Sidonia, bade him adieu until to-morrow, while he, as was his
custom, soon repaired to the refined circle of the Countess de C-s-l-ne,
a lady whose manners he always mentioned as his fair ideal, and whose
house was his favourite haunt.Before to-morrow comes, a word or two respecting two other characters
of this history connected with the family of Lord Monmouth.La Petite was neither very well nor very happy.Her hereditary
disease developed itself; gradually, but in a manner alarming to those
who loved her.She was very delicate, and suffered so much from the
weakness of her chest, that she was obliged to relinquish singing.This
was really the only tie between her and the Marchioness, who, without
being a petty tyrant, treated her often with unfeeling haughtiness.She
was, therefore, now rarely seen in the chambers of the great.In her own
apartments she found, indeed, some distraction in music, for which she
had a natural predisposition, but this was a pursuit that only fed
the morbid passion of her tender soul.Alone, listening only to sweet
sounds, or indulging in soft dreams that never could be realised, her
existence glided away like a vision, and she seemed to become every day
more fair and fragile.hers was the sad and mystic destiny to love
one whom she never met, and by whom, if she met him, she would scarcely,
perhaps, be recognised.Yet in that passion, fanciful, almost ideal,
her life was absorbed; nor for her did the world contain an existence,
a thought, a sensation, beyond those that sprang from the image of
the noble youth who had sympathised with her in her sorrows, and had
softened the hard fortunes of dependence by his generous sensibility.Happy that, with many mortifications, it was still her lot to live under
the roof of one who bore his name, and in whose veins flowed the same
blood!She felt indeed for the Marquess, whom she so rarely saw, and
from whom she had never received much notice, prompted, it would seem,
by her fantastic passion, a degree of reverence, almost of affection,
which seemed occasionally, even to herself, as something inexplicable
and without reason.As for her fond step-father, M. Villebecque, the world fared very
differently with him.His lively and enterprising genius, his ready and
multiform talents, and his temper which defied disturbance, had made
their way.He had become the very right hand of Lord Monmouth; his only
counsellor, his only confidant; his secret agent; the minister of his
will.And well did Villebecque deserve this trust, and ably did he
maintain himself in the difficult position which he achieved.There was
nothing which Villebecque did not know, nothing which he could not do,
especially at Paris.He was master of his subject; in all things the
secret of success, and without which, however they may from accident
dazzle the world, the statesman, the orator, the author, all alike feel
the damning consciousness of being charlatans.Coningsby had made a visit to M. Villebecque and Flora the day after
his arrival.It was a recollection and a courtesy that evidently greatly
gratified them.Villebecque talked very much and amusingly; and Flora,
whom Coningsby frequently addressed, very little, though she listened
with great earnestness.Coningsby told her that he thought, from all he
heard, she was too much alone, and counselled her to gaiety.But nature,
that had made her mild, had denied her that constitutional liveliness of
being which is the graceful property of French women.She was a lily of
the valley, that loved seclusion and the tranquillity of virgin glades.Almost every day, as he passed their _entresol_, Coningsby would look
into Villebecque's apartments for a moment, to ask after Flora.Sidonia was to dine at Lord Monmouth's the day after he met Lucretia,
and afterwards they were all to meet at a ball much talked of, and
to which invitations were much sought; and which was to be given that
evening by the Baroness S. de R----d.

Lord Monmouth's dinners at Paris were celebrated.It was generally
agreed that they had no rivals; yet there were others who had as skilful
cooks, others who, for such a purpose, were equally profuse in their
expenditure.What, then, was the secret spell of his success?The
simplest in the world, though no one seemed aware of it.His Lordship's
plates were always hot: whereas at Paris, in the best appointed houses,
and at dinners which, for costly materials and admirable art in their
preparation, cannot be surpassed, the effect is always considerably
lessened, and by a mode the most mortifying: by the mere circumstance
that every one at a French dinner is served on a cold plate.The reason
of a custom, or rather a necessity, which one would think a nation so
celebrated for their gastronomical taste would recoil from, is really,
it is believed, that the ordinary French porcelain is so very inferior
that it cannot endure the preparatory heat for dinner.The common white
pottery, for example, which is in general use, and always found at the
cafes, will not bear vicinage to a brisk kitchen fire for half-an-hour.Now, if we only had that treaty of commerce with France which has been
so often on the point of completion, the fabrics of our unrivalled
potteries, in exchange for their capital wines, would be found
throughout France.The dinners of both nations would be improved: the
English would gain a delightful beverage, and the French, for the first
time in their lives, would dine off hot plates.An unanswerable instance
of the advantages of commercial reciprocity.The guests at Lord Monmouth's to-day were chiefly Carlists, individuals
bearing illustrious names, that animate the page of history, and are
indissolubly bound up with the glorious annals of their great country.They are the phantoms of a past, but real Aristocracy; an Aristocracy
that was founded on an intelligible principle; which claimed great
privileges for great purposes; whose hereditary duties were such, that
their possessors were perpetually in the eye of the nation, and
who maintained, and, in a certain point of view justified, their
pre-eminence by constant illustration.It pleased Lord Monmouth to show great courtesies to a fallen race with
whom he sympathised; whose fathers had been his friends in the days of
his hot youth; whose mothers he had made love to; whose palaces had been
his home; whose brilliant fetes he remembered; whose fanciful splendour
excited his early imagination; and whose magnificent and wanton luxury
had developed his own predisposition for boundless enjoyment.Soubise
and his suppers; his cutlets and his mistresses; the profuse and
embarrassed De Lauragais, who sighed for 'entire ruin,' as for a strange
luxury, which perpetually eluded his grasp; these were the heroes of the
olden time that Lord Monmouth worshipped; the wisdom of our ancestors
which he appreciated; and he turned to their recollection for relief
from the vulgar prudence of the degenerate days on which he had fallen:
days when nobles must be richer than other men, or they cease to have
any distinction.It was impossible not to be struck by the effective appearance of Lady
Monmouth as she received her guests in grand toilet preparatory to the
ball; white satin and minever, a brilliant tiara.Her fine form, her
costume of a fashion as perfect as its materials were sumptuous, and her
presence always commanding and distinguished, produced a general effect
to which few could be insensible.It was the triumph of mien over mere
beauty of countenance.The hotel of Madame S. de R----d is not more distinguished by its
profuse decoration, than by the fine taste which has guided the vast
expenditure.Its halls of arabesque are almost without a rival; there is
not the slightest embellishment in which the hand and feeling of art are
not recognised.The rooms were very crowded; everybody distinguished in
Paris was there: the lady of the Court, the duchess of the Faubourg, the
wife of the financier, the constitutional Throne, the old Monarchy, the
modern Bourse, were alike represented.Marshals of the Empire, Ministers
of the Crown, Dukes and Marquesses, whose ancestors lounged in the
Oeil de Boeuf; diplomatists of all countries, eminent foreigners of all
nations, deputies who led sections, members of learned and scientific
academies, occasionally a stray poet; a sea of sparkling tiaras,
brilliant bouquets, glittering stars, and glowing ribbons, many
beautiful faces, many famous ones: unquestionably the general air of a
firstrate Parisian saloon, on a great occasion, is not easily equalled.In London there is not the variety of guests; nor the same size and
splendour of saloons.Coningsby, who had stolen away from his grandfather's before the rest of
the guests, was delighted with the novelty of the splendid scene.He had
been in Paris long enough to make some acquaintances, and mostly with
celebrated personages.In his long fruitless endeavour to enter the
saloon in which they danced, he found himself hustled against the
illustrious Baron von H----t, whom he had sat next to at dinner a few
days before at Count M----e's.'It is more difficult than cutting through the Isthmus of Panama,
Baron,' said Coningsby, alluding to a past conversation.'Infinitely,' replied M. de H., smiling; 'for I would undertake to
cut through the Isthmus, and I cannot engage that I shall enter this
ball-room.'Time, however, brought Coningsby into that brilliant chamber.What a
blaze of light and loveliness!To sounds of stirring melody, beautiful beings move
with grace.Grace, indeed, is beauty in action.Here, where all are fair and everything is attractive, his eye is
suddenly arrested by one object, a form of surpassing grace among the
graceful, among the beauteous a countenance of unrivalled beauty.She was young among the youthful; a face of sunshine amid all that
artificial light; her head placed upon her finely-moulded shoulders with
a queen-like grace; a coronet of white roses on her dark brown hair; her
only ornament.It was the beauty of the picture-gallery.The eye of Coningsby never quitted her.When the dance ceased, he had an
opportunity of seeing her nearer.He met her walking with her cavalier,
and he was conscious that she observed him.Finally he remarked that she
resumed a seat next to the lady whom he had mistaken for her mother, but
had afterwards understood to be Lady Wallinger.Coningsby returned to the other saloons: he witnessed the entrance and
reception of Lady Monmouth, who moved on towards the ball-room.Soon
after this, Sidonia arrived; he came in with the still handsome and ever
courteous Duke D----s. Observing Coningsby, he stopped to present him to
the Duke.While thus conversing, the Duke, who is fond of the English,
observed, 'See, here is your beautiful countrywoman that all the world
are talking of.He brings to me letters from one of
your lords, whose name I cannot recollect.'And Sir Joseph and his lovely niece veritably approached.The Duke
addressed them: asked them in the name of his Duchess to a concert on
the next Thursday; and, after a thousand compliments, moved on.Sidonia
stopped; Coningsby could not refrain from lingering, but stood a little
apart, and was about to move away, when there was a whisper, of which,
without hearing a word, he could not resist the impression that he was
the subject.He felt a little embarrassed, and was retiring, when he
heard Sidonia reply to an inquiry of the lady, 'The same,' and then,
turning to Coningsby, said aloud, 'Coningsby, Miss Millbank says that
you have forgotten her.'Coningsby started, advanced,  a little, could not conceal
his surprise.The lady, too, though more prepared, was not without
confusion, and for an instant looked down.Coningsby recalled at that
moment the long dark eyelashes, and the beautiful, bashful countenance
that had so charmed him at Millbank; but two years had otherwise
effected a wonderful change in the sister of his school-day friend,
and transformed the silent, embarrassed girl into a woman of surpassing
beauty and of the most graceful and impressive mien.Coningsby should not recollect my niece,'
said Sir Joseph, addressing Sidonia, and wishing to cover their mutual
embarrassment; 'but it is impossible for her, or for anyone connected
with her, not to be anxious at all times to express to him our sense of
what we all owe him.'Coningsby and Miss Millbank were now in full routine conversation,
consisting of questions; how long she had been at Paris; when she had
heard last from Millbank; how her father was; also, how was her brother.Sidonia made an observation to Sir Joseph on a passer-by, and then
himself moved on; Coningsby accompanying his new friends, in a contrary
direction, to the refreshment-room, to which they were proceeding.'And you have passed a winter at Rome,' said Coningsby.I feel that I shall never be able to travel.''Life has become so stirring, that there is ever some great cause that
keeps one at home.''Life, on the contrary, so swift, that all may see now that of which
they once could only read.''The golden and silver sides of the shield,' said Coningsby, with a
smile.'And you, like a good knight, will maintain your own.''Oh, yes; I think there are no such faithful correspondents as we are; I
only wish we could meet.''You will soon; but he is such a devotee of Oxford; quite a monk; and
you, too, Mr.'Yes, and at the same time as Millbank.I was in hopes, when I once paid
you a visit, I might have found your brother.''But that was such a rapid visit,' said Miss Millbank.'I always remember it with delight,' said Coningsby.'You were willing to be pleased; but Millbank, notwithstanding Rome,
commands my affections, and in spite of this surrounding splendour, I
could have wished to have passed my Christmas in Lancashire.'Millbank has lately purchased a very beautiful place in the county.Sandra went back to the office.I became acquainted with Hellingsley when staying at my grandfather's.'I have never seen it; indeed, I was much surprised that papa became
its purchaser, because he never will live there; and Oswald, I am sure,
could never be tempted to quit Millbank.You know what enthusiastic
ideas he has of his order?''Like all his ideas, sound, and high, and pure.I always duly
appreciated your brother's great abilities, and, what is far more
important, his lofty mind.When I recollect our Eton days, I cannot
understand how more than two years have passed away without our being
together.I might now have been at Oxford
instead of Paris.And yet,' added Coningsby, 'that would have been a sad
mistake, since I should not have had the happiness of being here.'Oh, yes, that would have been a sad mistake,' said Miss Millbank.'Edith,' said Sir Joseph, rejoining his niece, from whom he had been
momentarily separated, 'Edith, that is Monsieur Thiers.'In the meantime Sidonia reached the ball-room, and sitting near the
entrance was Lady Monmouth, who immediately addressed him.He was, as
usual, intelligent and unimpassioned, and yet not without a delicate
deference which is flattering to women, especially if not altogether
unworthy of it.Sidonia always admired Lucretia, and preferred her
society to that of most persons.But the Lady was in error in supposing
that she had conquered or could vanquish his heart.Sidonia was one of
those men, not so rare as may be supposed, who shrink, above all things,
from an adventure of gallantry with a woman in a position.He had
neither time nor temper for sentimental circumvolutions.He detested the
diplomacy of passion: protocols, protracted negotiations, conferences,
correspondence, treaties projected, ratified, violated.He had no genius
for the tactics of intrigue; your reconnoiterings, and marchings, and
countermarchings, sappings, and minings, assaults, sometimes surrenders,
and sometimes repulses.All the solemn and studied hypocrisies were to
him infinitely wearisome; and if the movements were not merely formal,
they irritated him, distracted his feelings, disturbed the tenor of his
mind, deranged his nervous system.Something of the old Oriental vein
influenced him in his carriage towards women.He was oftener behind the
scenes of the Opera-house than in his box; he delighted, too, in the
society of _etairai_; Aspasia was his heroine.Obliged to appear much in
what is esteemed pure society, he cultivated the acquaintance of clever
women, because they interested him; but in such saloons his feminine
acquaintances were merely psychological.No lady could accuse him of
trifling with her feelings, however decided might be his predilection
for her conversation.He yielded at once to an admirer; never trespassed
by any chance into the domain of sentiment; never broke, by any accident
or blunder, into the irregular paces of flirtation; was a man who
notoriously would never diminish by marriage the purity of his race;
and one who always maintained that passion and polished life were quite
incompatible.He liked the drawing-room, and he liked the Desert, but he
would not consent that either should trench on their mutual privileges.The Princess Lucretia had yielded herself to the spell of Sidonia's
society at Coningsby Castle, when she knew that marriage was impossible.But she loved him; and with an Italian spirit.Now they met again,
and she was the Marchioness of Monmouth, a very great lady, very much
admired, and followed, and courted, and very powerful.It is our great
moralist who tells us, in the immortal page, that an affair of gallantry
with a great lady is more delightful than with ladies of a lower degree.In this he contradicts the good old ballad; but certain it is that
Dr.Johnson announced to Boswell, 'Sir, in the case of a Countess the
imagination is more excited.'But Sidonia was a man on whom the conventional superiorities of life
produced as little effect as a flake falling on the glaciers of the high
Alps.His comprehension of the world and human nature was too vast
and complete; he understood too well the relative value of things to
appreciate anything but essential excellence; and that not too much.A
charming woman was not more charming to him because she chanced to be
an empress in a particular district of one of the smallest planets; a
charming woman under any circumstances was not an unique animal.When
Sidonia felt a disposition to be spellbound, he used to review in his
memory all the charming women of whom he had read in the books of all
literatures, and whom he had known himself in every court and clime,
and the result of his reflections ever was, that the charming woman in
question was by no means the paragon, which some who had read, seen,
and thought less, might be inclined to esteem her.There was, indeed,
no subject on which Sidonia discoursed so felicitously as on woman, and
none on which Lord Eskdale more frequently endeavoured to attract him.He would tell you Talmudical stories about our mother Eve and the Queen
of Sheba, which would have astonished you.There was not a free lady of
Greece, Leontium and Phryne, Lais, Danae, and Lamia, the Egyptian girl
Thonis, respecting whom he could not tell you as many diverting tales as
if they were ladies of Loretto; not a nook of Athenseus, not an obscure
scholiast, not a passage in a Greek orator, that could throw light on
these personages, which was not at his command.What stories he would
tell you about Marc Antony and the actress Cytheris in their chariot
drawn by tigers!What a character would he paint of that Flora who gave
her gardens to the Roman people!No
man was ever so learned in the female manners of the last centuries of
polytheism as Sidonia.You would have supposed that he had devoted his
studies peculiarly to that period if you had not chanced to draw him
to the Italian middle ages.And even these startling revelations were
almost eclipsed by his anecdotes of the Court of Henry III.of France,
with every character of which he was as familiar as with the brilliant
groups that at this moment filled the saloons of Madame de R----d.




CHAPTER III.The image of Edith Millbank was the last thought of Coningsby, as he
sank into an agitated slumber.To him had hitherto in general been
accorded the precious boon of dreamless sleep.Homer tells us these
phantasms come from Jove; they are rather the children of a distracted
soul.Coningsby this night lived much in past years, varied by
painful perplexities of the present, which he could neither subdue
nor comprehend.The scene flitted from Eton to the castle of his
grandfather; and then he found himself among the pictures of the Rue de
Tronchet, but their owner bore the features of the senior Millbank.A
beautiful countenance that was alternately the face in the mysterious
picture, and then that of Edith, haunted him under all circumstances.He
woke little refreshed; restless, and yet sensible of some secret joy.He woke to think of her of whom he had dreamed.The light had dawned on
his soul.what is that ambition that haunts our youth, that thirst for power
or that lust of fame that forces us from obscurity into the sunblaze of
the world, what are these sentiments so high, so vehement, so ennobling?They vanish, and in an instant, before the glance of a woman!Coningsby had scarcely quitted her side the preceding eve.He hung
upon the accents of that clear sweet voice, and sought, with tremulous
fascination, the gleaming splendour of those soft dark eyes.And now
he sat in his chamber, with his eyes fixed on vacancy.All thoughts and
feelings, pursuits, desires, life, merge in one absorbing sentiment.It is impossible to exist without seeing her again, and instantly.He
had requested and gained permission to call on Lady Wallinger; he would
not lose a moment in availing himself of it.As early as was tolerably
decorous, and before, in all probability, they could quit their hotel,
Coningsby repaired to the Rue de Rivoli to pay his respects to his new
friends.As he walked along, he indulged in fanciful speculations which connected
Edith and the mysterious portrait of his mother.He felt himself, as
it were, near the fulfilment of some fate, and on the threshold of some
critical discovery.He recalled the impatient, even alarmed, expressions
of Rigby at Montem six years ago, when he proposed to invite young
Millbank to his grandfather's dinner; the vindictive feud that existed
between the two families, and for which political opinion, or even party
passion, could not satisfactorily account; and he reasoned himself into
a conviction, that the solution of many perplexities was at hand, and
that all would be consummated to the satisfaction of every one, by his
unexpected but inevitable agency.The worthy Baronet was at any rate
no participator in Mr.Millbank's vindictive feelings against Lord
Monmouth.On the contrary, he had a very high respect for a Marquess,
whatever might be his opinions, and no mean consideration for a
Marquess' grandson.Sir Joseph had inherited a large fortune made by commerce, and had
increased it by the same means.He was a middle-class Whig, had
faithfully supported that party in his native town during the days they
wandered in the wilderness, and had well earned his share of the milk
and honey when they had vanquished the promised land.In the springtide
of Liberalism, when the world was not analytical of free opinions, and
odious distinctions were not drawn between Finality men and progressive
Reformers, Mr.Wallinger had been the popular leader of a powerful
body of his fellow-citizens, who had returned him to the first Reformed
Parliament, and where, in spite of many a menacing registration, he
had contrived to remain.He had never given a Radical vote without
the permission of the Secretary of the Treasury, and was not afraid
of giving an unpopular one to serve his friends.He was not like that
distinguished Liberal, who, after dining with the late Whig Premier,
expressed his gratification and his gratitude, by assuring his Lordship
that he might count on his support on all popular questions.'I want men who will support the government on all unpopular questions,'
replied the witty statesman.His high character and strong purse
were always in the front rank in the hour of danger.His support in the
House was limited to his votes; but in other places equally important,
at a meeting at a political club, or in Downing Street, he could find
his tongue, take what is called a 'practical' view of a question, adopt
what is called an 'independent tone,' reanimate confidence in ministers,
check mutiny, and set a bright and bold example to the wavering.A man
of his property, and high character, and sound views, so practical and
so independent, this was evidently the block from which a Baronet should
be cut, and in due time he figured Sir Joseph.A Spanish gentleman of ample means, and of a good Catalan family, flying
during a political convulsion to England, arrived with his two
daughters at Liverpool, and bore letters of introduction to the house
of Wallinger.Some little time after this, by one of those stormy
vicissitudes of political fortune, of late years not unusual in the
Peninsula, he returned to his native country, and left his children, and
the management of that portion of his fortune that he had succeeded in
bringing with him, under the guardianship of the father of the present
Sir Joseph.This gentleman was about again to become an exile, when
he met with an untimely end in one of those terrible tumults of which
Barcelona is the frequent scene.The younger Wallinger was touched by the charms of one of his father's
wards.Her beauty of a character to which he was unaccustomed,
her accomplishments of society, and the refinement of her manners,
conspicuous in the circle in which he lived, captivated him; and though
they had no heir, the union had been one of great felicity.Sir Joseph
was proud of his wife; he secretly considered himself, though his 'tone'
was as liberal and independent as in old days, to be on the threshold of
aristocracy, and was conscious that Lady Wallinger played her part not
unworthily in the elevated circles in which they now frequently found
themselves.Sir Joseph was fond of great people, and not averse to
travel; because, bearing a title, and being a member of the British
Parliament, and always moving with the appendages of wealth, servants,
carriages, and couriers, and fortified with no lack of letters from
the Foreign Office, he was everywhere acknowledged, and received,
and treated as a personage; was invited to court-balls, dined with
ambassadors, and found himself and his lady at every festival of
distinction.The elder Millbank had been Joseph Wallinger's youthful friend.Different as were their dispositions and the rate of their abilities,
their political opinions were the same; and commerce habitually
connected their interests.During a visit to Liverpool, Millbank had
made the acquaintance of the sister of Lady Wallinger, and had been a
successful suitor for her hand.This lady was the mother of Edith and of
the schoolfellow of Coningsby.It was only within a very few years
that she had died; she had scarcely lived long enough to complete the
education of her daughter, to whom she was devoted, and on whom she
lavished the many accomplishments that she possessed.Lady Wallinger
having no children, and being very fond of her niece, had watched over
Edith with infinite solicitude, and finally had persuaded Mr.Millbank,
that it would be well that his daughter should accompany them in their
somewhat extensive travels.It was not, therefore, only that nature
had developed a beautiful woman out of a bashful girl since Coningsby's
visit to Millbank; but really, every means and every opportunity that
could contribute to render an individual capable of adorning the most
accomplished circles of life, had naturally, and without effort, fallen
to the fortunate lot of the manufacturer's daughter.Edith possessed
an intelligence equal to those occasions.Without losing the native
simplicity of her character, which sprang from the heart, and which
the strong and original bent of her father's mind had fostered, she had
imbibed all the refinement and facility of the polished circles in which
she moved.She had a clear head, a fine taste, and a generous spirit;
had received so much admiration, that, though by no means insensible to
homage, her heart was free; was strongly attached to her family; and,
notwithstanding all the splendour of Rome, and the brilliancy of Paris,
her thoughts were often in her Saxon valley, amid the green hills and
busy factories of Millbank.Sir Joseph, finding himself alone with the grandson of Lord Monmouth,
was not very anxious that the ladies should immediately appear.He
thought this a good opportunity of getting at what are called 'the
real feelings of the Tory party;' and he began to pump with a seductive
semblance of frankness.For his part, he had never doubted that a
Conservative government was ultimately inevitable; had told Lord John
so two years ago, and, between themselves, Lord John was of the same
opinion.The present position of the Whigs was the necessary fate of
all progressive parties; could not see exactly how it would end; thought
sometimes it must end in a fusion of parties; but could not well see how
that could be brought about, at least at present.For his part, should
be happy to witness an union of the best men of all parties, for the
preservation of peace and order, without any reference to any particular
opinions.And, in that sense of the word, it was not at all impossible
he might find it his duty some day to support a Conservative government.Sir Joseph was much astonished when Coningsby, who being somewhat
impatient for the entrance of the ladies was rather more abrupt than his
wont, told the worthy Baronet that he looked, upon a government without
distinct principles of policy as only a stop-gap to a wide-spread and
demoralising anarchy; that he for one could not comprehend how a free
government could endure without national opinions to uphold it; and that
governments for the preservation of peace and order, and nothing else,
had better be sought in China, or among the Austrians, the Chinese of
Europe.As for Conservative government, the natural question was, What
do you mean to conserve?Do you mean to conserve things or only names,
realities or merely appearances?Or, do you mean to continue the
system commenced in 1834, and, with a hypocritical reverence for the
principles, and a superstitious adhesion to the forms, of the old
exclusive constitution, carry on your policy by latitudinarian practice?Sir Joseph stared; it was the first time that any inkling of the
views of the New Generation had caught his ear.They were strange and
unaccustomed accents.He was extremely perplexed; could by no means make
out what his companion was driving at; at length, with a rather knowing
smile, expressive as much of compassion as comprehension, he remarked,

'Ah!I see; you are a regular Orangeman.''I look upon an Orangeman,' said Coningsby, 'as a pure Whig; the only
professor and practiser of unadulterated Whiggism.'This was too much for Sir Joseph, whose political knowledge did not
reach much further back than the ministry of the Mediocrities; hardly
touched the times of the Corresponding Society.But he was a cautious
man, and never replied in haste.He was about feeling his way, when
he experienced the golden advantage of gaining time, for the ladies
entered.The heart of Coningsby throbbed as Edith appeared.She extended to him
her hand; her face radiant with kind expression.Lady Wallinger seemed
gratified also by his visit.She had much elegance in her manner;
a calm, soft address; and she spoke English with a sweet Doric
irregularity.They all sat down, talked of the last night's ball, of a
thousand things.There was something animating in the frank, cheerful
spirit of Edith.She had a quick eye both for the beautiful and the
ridiculous, and threw out her observations in terse and vivid phrases.An hour, and more than an hour, passed away, and Coningsby still found
some excuse not to depart.It seemed that on this morning they were
about to make an expedition into the antique city of Paris, to visit
some old hotels which retained their character; especially they had
heard much of the hotel of the Archbishop of Sens, with its fortified
courtyard.Coningsby expressed great interest in the subject, and showed
some knowledge.Sir Joseph invited him to join the party, which of all
things in the world was what he most desired.Not a day elapsed without Coningsby being in the company of Edith.Time
was precious for him, for the spires and pinnacles of Cambridge
already began to loom in the distance, and he resolved to make the most
determined efforts not to lose a day of his liberty.And yet to call
every morning in the Rue de Rivoli was an exploit which surpassed even
the audacity of love!More than once, making the attempt, his courage
failed him, and he turned into the gardens of the Tuileries, and only
watched the windows of the house.Circumstances, however, favoured him:
he received a letter from Oswald Millbank; he was bound to communicate
in person this evidence of his friend's existence; and when he had to
reply to the letter, he must necessarily inquire whether his friend's
relatives had any message to transmit to him.These, however, were only
slight advantages.What assisted Coningsby in his plans and wishes was
the great pleasure which Sidonia, with whom he passed a great deal of
his time, took in the society of the Wallingers and their niece.Sidonia
presented Lady Wallinger with his opera-box during her stay at Paris;
invited them frequently to his agreeable dinner-parties; and announced
his determination to give a ball, which Lady Wallinger esteemed a
delicate attention to Edith; while Lady Monmouth flattered herself that
the festival sprang from the desire she had expressed of seeing the
celebrated hotel of Sidonia to advantage.His morning visits to the Rue de Rivoli seemed
always welcome, and seldom an evening elapsed in which he did not find
himself in the society of Edith.She seemed not to wish to conceal that
his presence gave her pleasure, and though she had many admirers, and
had an airy graciousness for all of them, Coningsby sometimes indulged
the exquisite suspicion that there was a flattering distinction in her
carriage to himself.Under the influence of these feelings, he began
daily to be more conscious that separation would be an intolerable
calamity; he began to meditate upon the feasibility of keeping a half
term, and of postponing his departure to Cambridge to a period nearer
the time when Edith would probably return to England.In the meanwhile, the Parisian world talked much of the grand fete which
was about to be given by Sidonia.Coningsby heard much of it one day
when dining at his grandfather's.Lady Monmouth seemed very intent on
the occasion.Even Lord Monmouth half talked of going, though, for his
part, he wished people would come to him, and never ask him to their
houses.He liked the world, but he liked
to find it under his own roof.He grudged them nothing, so that they
would not insist upon the reciprocity of cold-catching, and would eat
his good dinners instead of insisting on his eating their bad ones.'But Monsieur Sidonia's cook is a gem, they say,' observed an Attache of
an embassy.'I have no doubt of it; Sidonia is a man of sense, almost the only man
of sense I know.Sidonia is exactly the sort of man I like; you know you cannot
deceive him, and that he does not want to deceive you.I wish he liked a
rubber more.'They say he is going to be married,' said the Attache.'To your beautiful countrywoman, "la belle Anglaise," that all the world
talks of,' said the Attache.'I have so many beautiful
countrywomen.''Mademoiselle Millbank,' said the Attache.said the Marquess, with a lowering brow.Do you know what Millbank this is, Harry?'he inquired of his
grandson, who had listened to the conversation with a rather embarrassed
and even agitated spirit.'What, sir; yes, Millbank?''I say, do you know who this Millbank is?'Miss Millbank: yes, I believe, that is, I know a daughter of the
gentleman who purchased some property near you.''The most beautiful girl in Paris,' said the Attache.'Lady Monmouth, have you seen this beauty, that Sidonia is going to
marry?''I have seen the young lady,' said Lady Monmouth; 'but I had not heard
that Monsieur Sidonia was about to marry her.''Yes,' said Lady Monmouth, calm, but pale.'I assure you that it is a fact,' said the Attache, 'not at least an
_on-dit_.I have it from a quarter that could not well be mistaken.'Behold a little snatch of ordinary dinner gossip that left a very
painful impression on the minds of three individuals who were present.The name of Millbank revived in Lord Monmouth's mind a sense of defeat,
discomfiture, and disgust; Hellingsley, lost elections, and Mr.Rigby;
three subjects which Lord Monmouth had succeeded for a time in expelling
from his sensations.His lordship thought that, in all probability, this
beauty of whom they spoke so highly was not really the daughter of his
foe; that it was some confusion which had arisen from the similarity of
names: nor did he believe that Sidonia was going to marry her, whoever
she might be; but a variety of things had been said at dinner, and a
number of images had been raised in his mind that touched his spleen.He
took his wine freely, and, the usual consequence of that proceeding with
Lord Monmouth, became silent and sullen.As for Lady Monmouth, she
had learnt that Sidonia, whatever might be the result, was paying very
marked attention to another woman, for whom undoubtedly he was giving
that very ball which she had flattered herself was a homage to her
wishes, and for which she had projected a new dress of eclipsing
splendour.Coningsby felt quite sure that the story of Sidonia's marriage
with Edith was the most ridiculous idea that ever entered into the
imagination of man; at least he thought he felt quite sure.But the
idlest and wildest report that the woman you love is about to marry
another is not comfortable.Besides, he could not conceal from himself
that, between the Wallingers and Sidonia there existed a remarkable
intimacy, fully extended to their niece.He had seen her certainly on
more than one occasion in lengthened and apparently earnest conversation
with Sidonia, who, by-the-bye, spoke with her often in Spanish, and
never concealed his admiration of her charms or the interest he found
in her society.And Edith; what, after all, had passed between Edith
and himself which should at all gainsay this report, which he had been
particularly assured was not a mere report, but came from a quarter that
could not well be mistaken?And
how should she receive one who was the friend and preserver of her only
brother, and apparently the intimate and cherished acquaintance of
her future husband?Coningsby felt that sickness of the heart that
accompanies one's first misfortune.The illusions of life seemed to
dissipate and disappear.He was miserable; he had no confidence in
himself, in his future.A dependent on a man of
very resolute will and passions.Could he forget the glance with which
Lord Monmouth caught the name of Millbank, and received the intimation
of Hellingsley?It was a glance for a Spagnoletto or a Caravaggio to
catch and immortalise.Why, if Edith were not going to marry Sidonia,
how was he ever to marry her, even if she cared for him?what a
future of unbroken, continuous, interminable misery awaited him!Was
there ever yet born a being with a destiny so dark and dismal?He was
the most forlorn of men, utterly wretched!He had no energy, no abilities, not a single eminent
quality.CHAPTER V.


It was fated that Lady Monmouth should not be present at that ball,
the anticipation of which had occasioned her so much pleasure and some
pangs.On the morning after that slight conversation, which had so disturbed
the souls, though unconsciously to each other, of herself and Coningsby,
the Marquess was driving Lucretia up the avenue Marigny in his phaeton.About the centre of the avenue the horses took fright, and started off
at a wild pace.The Marquess was an experienced whip, calm, and with
exertion still very powerful.He would have soon mastered the horses,
had not one of the reins unhappily broken.The horses swerved; the
Marquess kept his seat; Lucretia, alarmed, sprang up, the carriage was
dashed against the trunk of a tree, and she was thrown out of it, at
the very instant that one of the outriders had succeeded in heading the
equipage and checking the horses.Lord Monmouth had descended from the
phaeton; several passengers had assembled; the door of a contiguous
house was opened; there were offers of service, sympathy, inquiries, a
babble of tongues, great confusion.'Get surgeons and send for her maid,' said Lord Monmouth to one of his
servants.In the midst of this distressing tumult, Sidonia, on horseback, followed
by a groom, came up the avenue from the Champs Elysees.The empty
phaeton, reins broken, horses held by strangers, all the appearances of
a misadventure, attracted him.Moving aside the crowd, he perceived Lady Monmouth senseless
and prostrate, and her husband, without assistance, restraining the
injudicious efforts of the bystanders.'Let us carry her in, Lord Monmouth,' said Sidonia, exchanging a
recognition as he took Lucretia in his arms, and bore her into the
dwelling that was at hand.Those who were standing at the door assisted
him.The woman of the house and Lord Monmouth only were present.'I would hope there is no fracture,' said Sidonia, placing her on a
sofa, 'nor does it appear to me that the percussion of the head, though
considerable, could have been fatally violent.Keep her in a horizontal position, and she will soon come to herself.'The Marquess seated himself in a chair by the side of the sofa, which
Sidonia had advanced to the middle of the room.Lord Monmouth was silent
and very serious.Sidonia opened the window, and touched the brow of
Lucretia with water.At this moment M. Villebecque and a surgeon entered
the chamber.'The brain cannot be affected, with that pulse,' said the surgeon;
'there is no fracture.'said Lord Monmouth, as if he were examining a
picture.'The colour seems to me to return,' said Sidonia.The surgeon applied some restoratives which he had brought with him.The
face of the Marchioness showed signs of life; she stirred.The Marchioness breathed with some force; again; then half-opened her
eyes, and then instantly closed them.'If I could but get her to take this draught,' said the surgeon.moisten her lips first,' said Sidonia.They placed the draught to her mouth; in a moment she put forth her hand
as if to repress them, then opened her eyes again, and sighed.Lord Monmouth looked round to invite his friend to come forward.She started, rose a little on the sofa, stared around her.'With me,' said the Marquess; and he bent forward to her, and took her
hand.she again exclaimed, in a voice of inquiry.The Marquess took a pinch of snuff.'I think now,' said Sidonia to the surgeon, 'that Lady Monmouth would
take the draught.''Try you, Sidonia,' said the Marquess, rather dryly.said the Marchioness, with an air of stupor.'She wanders a little,' said Sidonia.The Marquess took another pinch of snuff.'I could have borne even repulsion,' said Lady Monmouth, in a voice of
desolation, 'but not for another!'Lord Monmouth looked at him with that irresistible scrutiny which would
daunt a galley-slave; and then, after a short pause, said, 'The carriage
should have arrived by this time.After the conversation at dinner which we have noticed, the restless
and disquieted Coningsby wandered about Paris, vainly seeking in the
distraction of a great city some relief from the excitement of his mind.His first resolution was immediately to depart for England; but when, on
reflection, he was mindful that, after all, the assertion which had
so agitated him might really be without foundation, in spite of many
circumstances that to his regardful fancy seemed to accredit it, his
firm resolution began to waver.These were the first pangs of jealousy that Coningsby had ever
experienced, and they revealed to him the immensity of the stake which
he was hazarding on a most uncertain die.The next morning he called in the Rue Rivoli, and was informed that the
family were not at home.He was returning under the arcades, towards the
Rue St.Florentin, when Sidonia passed him in an opposite direction, on
horseback, and at a rapid rate.Coningsby, who was not observed by
him, could not resist a strange temptation to watch for a moment his
progress.He saw him enter the court of the hotel where the Wallinger
family were staying.Coningsby flattered
himself that Sidonia was only speaking to the porter.Then he would
fain believe Sidonia was writing a note.Then, crossing the street, he
mounted by some steps the terrace of the Tuileries, nearly opposite the
Hotel of the Minister of Finance, and watched the house.A quarter of an
hour elapsed; Sidonia did not come forth.They were at home to him; only
to him.Sick at heart, infinitely wretched, scarcely able to guide his
steps, dreading even to meet an acquaintance, and almost feeling that
his tongue would refuse the office of conversation, he contrived to
reach his grandfather's hotel, and was about to bury himself in his
chamber, when on the staircase he met Flora.Coningsby had not seen her for the last fortnight.Seeing her now, his
heart smote him for his neglect, excusable as it really was.Any one
else at this time he would have hurried by without a recognition, but
the gentle and suffering Flora was too meek to be rudely treated by so
kind a heart as Coningsby's.He looked at her; she was pale and agitated.Her step trembled, while
she still hastened on.'My Lord, the Marchioness, are in danger, thrown from their carriage.'Briefly she detailed to Coningsby all that had occurred; that M.
Villebecque had already repaired to them; that she herself only this
moment had learned the intelligence that seemed to agitate her to the
centre.Coningsby instantly turned with her; but they had scarcely
emerged from the courtyard when the carriage approached that brought
Lord and Lady Monmouth home.'All is right, Harry,' said the Marquess, calm and grave.Then he assisted Lucretia to
alight.'I am quite well,' she said, 'now.''But you must lean on me, dearest Lady Monmouth,' Coningsby said in a
tone of tenderness, as he felt Lucretia almost sinking from him.And he
supported her into the hall of the hotel.Flora crept up to him, and with
unwonted boldness offered her arm to the Marquess.He looked at her with
a glance of surprise, and then a softer expression, one indeed of an
almost winning sweetness, which, though rare, was not a stranger to
his countenance, melted his features, and taking the arm so humbly
presented, he said,

'Ma Petite, you look more frightened than any of us.He had reached the top of the flight of steps; he withdrew his arm from
Flora, and thanked her with all his courtesy.'You are not hurt, then, sir?'she ventured to ask with a look that
expressed the infinite solicitude which her tongue did not venture to
convey.'By no means, my good little girl;' and he extended his hand to her,
which she reverently bent over and embraced.When Coningsby had returned to his grandfather's hotel that morning, it
was with a determination to leave Paris the next day for England;
but the accident to Lady Monmouth, though, as it ultimately appeared,
accompanied by no very serious consequences, quite dissipated this
intention.It was impossible to quit them so crudely at such a moment.So he remained another day, and that was the day preceding Sidonia's
fete, which he particularly resolved not to attend.He felt it quite
impossible that he could again endure the sight of either Sidonia or
Edith.He looked upon them as persons who had deeply injured him;
though they really were individuals who had treated him with invariable
kindness.But he felt their existence was a source of mortification and
misery to him.With these feelings, sauntering away the last hours at
Paris, disquieted, uneasy; no present, no future; no enjoyment, no hope;
really, positively, undeniably unhappy; unhappy too for the first time
in his life; the first unhappiness; what a companion piece for the
first love!Coningsby, of all places in the world, in the gardens of the
Luxembourg, encountered Sir Joseph Wallinger and Edith.To avoid them was impossible; they met face to face; and Sir Joseph
stopped, and immediately reminded him that it was three days since they
had seen him, as if to reproach him for so unprecedented a neglect.And
it seemed that Edith, though she said not as much, felt the same.And
Coningsby turned round and walked with them.He told them he was going
to leave Paris on the morrow.'And miss Monsieur de Sidonia's fete, of which we have all talked
so much!'said Edith, with unaffected surprise, and an expression of
disappointment which she in vain attempted to conceal.'The festival will not be less gay for my absence,' said Coningsby, with
that plaintive moroseness not unusual to despairing lovers.'If we were all to argue from the same premises, and act accordingly,'
said Edith, 'the saloons would be empty.But if any person's absence
would be remarked, I should really have thought it would be yours.I
thought you were one of Monsieur de Sidonia's great friends?''He has no friends,' said Coningsby.And then she said,

'I am sure you have not quarrelled with Monsieur de Sidonia, for we have
just parted with him.''I have no doubt you have,' thought Coningsby.'And it is impossible to speak of another in higher terms than he spoke
of you.'Sir Joseph observed how unusual it was for Monsieur de Sidonia
to express himself so warmly.'Sidonia is a great man, and carries everything before him,' said
Coningsby.'I am nothing; I cannot cope with him; I retire from the
field.'inquired Sir Joseph, who did not clearly catch the drift
of these observations.'It appears to me that a field for action is
exactly what Sidonia wants.There is no vent for his abilities and
intelligence.He wastes his energy in travelling from capital to capital
like a King's messenger.The morning after his fete he is going to
Madrid.'Edith spoke of
her return to Lancashire, of her hope that Mr.Coningsby would soon see
Oswald; but Mr.Coningsby informed her that though he was going to leave
Paris, he had no intention of returning to England; that he had not yet
quite made up his mind whither he should go; but thought that he
should travel direct to St.He wished to travel overland to
Astrachan.That was the place he was particularly anxious to visit.After this incomprehensible announcement, they walked on for some
minutes in silence, broken only by occasional monosyllables, with which
Coningsby responded at hazard to the sound remarks of Sir Joseph.As
they approached the Palace a party of English who were visiting the
Chamber of Peers, and who were acquainted with the companions of
Coningsby, encountered them.Amid the mutual recognitions, Coningsby,
was about to take his leave somewhat ceremoniously, but Edith held forth
her hand, and said,

'Is this indeed farewell?'His heart was agitated, his countenance changed; he retained her hand
amid the chattering tourists, too full of their criticisms and their
egotistical commonplaces to notice what was passing.A sentimental
ebullition seemed to be on the point of taking place.The look of Edith was mournful and inquiring.'We will say farewell at the ball,' said Coningsby, and she rewarded him
with a radiant smile.Sidonia lived in the Faubourg St.Germain, in a large hotel that, in
old days, had belonged to the Crillons; but it had received at his hands
such extensive alterations, that nothing of the original decoration, and
little of its arrangement, remained.A flight of marble steps, ascending from a vast court, led into a
hall of great dimensions, which was at the same time an orangery and
a gallery of sculpture.It was illumined by a distinct, yet soft
and subdued light, which harmonised with the beautiful repose of the
surrounding forms, and with the exotic perfume that was wafted about.A gallery led from this hall to an inner hall of quite a different
character; fantastic, glittering, variegated; full of strange shapes and
dazzling objects.The roof was carved and gilt in that honeycomb style prevalent in the
Saracenic buildings; the walls were hung with leather stamped in rich
and vivid patterns; the floor was a flood of mosaic; about were statues
of <DW64>s of human size with faces of wild expression, and holding
in their outstretched hands silver torches that blazed with an almost
painful brilliancy.From this inner hall a double staircase of white marble led to the grand
suite of apartments.These saloons, lofty, spacious, and numerous, had been decorated
principally in encaustic by the most celebrated artists of Munich.The
three principal rooms were only separated from each other by columns,
covered with rich hangings, on this night drawn aside.The decoration
of each chamber was appropriate to its purpose.On the walls of the
ball-room nymphs and heroes moved in measure in Sicilian landscapes,
or on the azure shores of Aegean waters.From the ceiling beautiful
divinities threw garlands on the guests, who seemed surprised that
the roses, unwilling to quit Olympus, would not descend on earth.The general effect of this fair chamber was heightened, too, by
that regulation of the house which did not permit any benches in the
ball-room.That dignified assemblage who are always found ranged in
precise discipline against the wall, did not here mar the flowing grace
of the festivity.The chaperons had no cause to complain.A large saloon
abounded in ottomans and easy chairs at their service, where their
delicate charges might rest when weary, or find distraction when not
engaged.All the world were at this fete of Sidonia.It exceeded in splendour and
luxury every entertainment that had yet been given.The highest rank,
even Princes of the blood, beauty, fashion, fame, all assembled in a
magnificent and illuminated palace, resounding with exquisite melody.Coningsby, though somewhat depressed, was not insensible to the magic
of the scene.Since the passage in the gardens of the Luxembourg, that
tone, that glance, he had certainly felt much relieved, happier.And yet
if all were, with regard to Sidonia, as unfounded as he could possibly
desire, where was he then?Had he forgotten his grandfather, that fell
look, that voice of intense detestation?The Spanish
parentage of Edith had only more perplexed Coningsby.There could be no connection between a Catalan family and his
mother, the daughter of a clergyman in a midland county.That there
was any relationship between the Millbank family and his mother was
contradicted by the conviction in which he had been brought up, that
his mother had no relations; that she returned to England utterly
friendless; without a relative, a connection, an acquaintance to whom
she could appeal.Her complete forlornness was stamped upon his brain.Tender as were his years when he was separated from her, he could yet
recall the very phrases in which she deplored her isolation; and there
were numerous passages in her letters which alluded to it.Coningsby
had taken occasion to sound the Wallingers on this subject; but he felt
assured, from the manner in which his advances were met, that they knew
nothing of his mother, and attributed the hostility of Mr.Millbank
to his grandfather, solely to political emulation and local rivalries.That was a fact; a clue
which ultimately, he was persuaded, must lead to some solution.Coningsby had met with great social success at Paris.He was at once a
favourite.The Parisian dames decided in his favour.He was a specimen
of the highest style of English beauty, which is popular in France.The men also liked him; he
had not quite arrived at that age when you make enemies.The moment,
therefore, that he found himself in the saloons of Sidonia, he was
accosted by many whose notice was flattering; but his eye wandered,
while he tried to be courteous and attempted to be sprightly.He had nearly reached the ball-room when he met her.She was on
the arm of Lord Beaumanoir, who had made her acquaintance at Rome, and
originally claimed it as the member of a family who, as the reader may
perhaps not forget, had experienced some kindnesses from the Millbanks.There were mutual and hearty recognitions between the young men; great
explanations where they had been, what they were doing, where they were
going.Lord Beaumanoir told Coningsby he had introduced steeple-chases
at Rome, and had parted with Sunbeam to the nephew of a Cardinal.Coningsby securing Edith's hand for the next dance, they all moved on
together to her aunt.Lady Wallinger was indulging in some Roman reminiscences with the
Marquess.'And you are not going to Astrachan to-morrow?''Not to-morrow,' said Coningsby.'You know that you said once that life was too stirring in these days to
permit travel to a man?''I wish nothing was stirring,' said Coningsby.All that I wish is, that this fete should never end.''Is it possible that you can be capricious?'Am I capricious because I dislike change?''It was the air of the Luxembourg that reminded me of the Desert,' said
Coningsby.Soon after this Coningsby led Edith to the dance.It was at a ball that
he had first met her at Paris, and this led to other reminiscences;
all most interesting.All mysteries, all
difficulties, were driven from his recollection; he lived only in the
exciting and enjoyable present.Some time after this, Coningsby, who was inevitably separated from
Edith, met his host.'Where have you been, child,' said Sidonia, 'that I have not seen you
for some days?'And I must think, I suppose, of Cambridge.''Well, you have seen something; you will find it more profitable when
you have digested it: and you will have opportunity.That's the true
spring of wisdom: meditate over the past.Adventure and Contemplation
share our being like day and night.'The resolute departure for England on the morrow had already changed
into a supposed necessity of thinking of returning to Cambridge.In
fact, Coningsby felt that to quit Paris and Edith was an impossibility.He silenced the remonstrance of his conscience by the expedient of
keeping a half-term, and had no difficulty in persuading himself that
a short delay in taking his degree could not really be of the slightest
consequence.The guests at a French ball are not seen to
advantage at this period.The custom of separating the sexes for this
refreshment, and arranging that the ladies should partake of it by
themselves, though originally founded in a feeling of consideration
and gallantry, and with the determination to secure, under all
circumstances, the convenience and comfort of the fair sex, is really,
in its appearance and its consequences, anything but European, and
produces a scene which rather reminds one of the harem of a sultan than
a hall of chivalry.To judge from the countenances of the favoured fair,
they are not themselves particularly pleased; and when their repast is
over they necessarily return to empty halls, and are deprived of the
dance at the very moment when they may feel most inclined to participate
in its graceful excitement.These somewhat ungracious circumstances, however, were not attendant on
the festival of this night.There was opened in the Hotel of Sidonia for
the first time a banqueting-room which could contain with convenience
all the guests.It was a vast chamber of white marble, the golden panels
of the walls containing festive sculptures by Schwanthaler, relieved by
encaustic tinting.In its centre was a fountain, a group of Bacchantes
encircling Dionysos; and from this fountain, as from a star, diverged
the various tables from which sprang orange-trees in fruit and flower.The banquet had but one fault; Coningsby was separated from Edith.The
Duchess of Grand Cairo, the beautiful wife of the heir of one of the
Imperial illustrations, had determined to appropriate Coningsby as
her cavalier for the moment.Distracted, he made his escape; but his
wandering eye could not find the object of its search; and he fell
prisoner to the charming Princess de Petitpoix, a Carlist chieftain,
whose witty words avenged the cause of fallen dynasties and a cashiered
nobility.Behold a scene brilliant in fancy, magnificent in splendour!All the
circumstances of his life at this moment were such as acted forcibly
on the imagination of Coningsby.Separated from Edith, he had still the
delight of seeing her the paragon of that bright company, the consummate
being whom he adored!and who had spoken to him in a voice sweeter than
a serenade, and had bestowed on him a glance softer than moonlight!The
lord of the palace, more distinguished even for his capacity than his
boundless treasure, was his chosen friend; gained under circumstances
of romantic interest, when the reciprocal influence of their personal
qualities was affected by no accessory knowledge of their worldly
positions.He himself was in the very bloom of youth and health; the
child of a noble house, rich for his present wants, and with a future of
considerable fortunes.Entrancing love and dazzling friendship, a
high ambition and the pride of knowledge, the consciousness of a great
prosperity, the vague, daring energies of the high pulse of twenty-one,
all combined to stimulate his sense of existence, which, as he looked
around him at the beautiful objects and listened to the delicious
sounds, seemed to him a dispensation of almost supernatural ecstasy.About an hour after this, the ball-room still full, but the other
saloons gradually emptying, Coningsby entered a chamber which seemed
deserted.Yet he heard sounds, as it were, of earnest conversation.It
was the voice that invited his progress; he advanced another step, then
suddenly stopped.There were two individuals in the room, by whom he was
unnoticed.They were sitting on a
sofa, Sidonia holding her hand and endeavouring, as it seemed, to soothe
her.Her tones were tremulous; but the expression of her face was fond
and confiding.Coningsby instantly
withdrew, yet could not escape hearing an earnest request from Edith to
her companion that he would write to her.In a few seconds Coningsby had quitted the hotel of Sidonia, and the
next day found him on his road to England.CHAPTER I.


It was one of those gorgeous and enduring sunsets that seemed to linger
as if they wished to celebrate the mid-period of the year.Perhaps the
beautiful hour of impending twilight never exercises a more effective
influence on the soul than when it descends on the aspect of some
distant and splendid city.What a contrast between the serenity and
repose of our own bosoms and the fierce passions and destructive cares
girt in the walls of that multitude whose domes and towers rise in
purple lustre against the resplendent horizon!And yet the disturbing emotions of existence and the bitter inheritance
of humanity should exercise but a modified sway, and entail but a light
burden, within the circle of the city into which the next scene of our
history leads us.For it is the sacred city of study, of learning,
and of faith; and the declining beam is resting on the dome of the
Radcliffe, lingering on the towers of Christchurch and Magdalen,
sanctifying the spires and pinnacles of holy St.A young Oxonian, who had for some time been watching the city in the
sunset, from a rising ground in its vicinity, lost, as it would seem, in
meditation, suddenly rose, and looking at his watch, as if remindful
of some engagement, hastened his return at a rapid pace.He reached
the High Street as the Blenheim light post coach dashed up to the Star
Hotel, with that brilliant precision which even the New Generation can
remember, and yet which already ranks among the traditions of English
manners.A peculiar and most animating spectacle used to be the arrival
of a firstrate light coach in a country town!The small machine,
crowded with so many passengers, the foaming and curvetting leaders, the
wheelers more steady and glossy, as if they had not done their ten miles
in the hour, the triumphant bugle of the guard, and the haughty routine
with which the driver, as he reached his goal, threw his whip to the
obedient ostlers in attendance; and, not least, the staring crowd, a
little awestruck, and looking for the moment at the lowest official of
the stable with considerable respect, altogether made a picture which
one recollects with cheerfulness, and misses now in many a dreary
market-town.Our Oxonian was a young man about the middle height, and naturally of a
thoughtful expression and rather reserved mien.The general character of
his countenance was, indeed, a little stern, but it broke into an almost
bewitching smile, and a blush suffused his face, as he sprang forward
and welcomed an individual about the same age, who had jumped off the
Blenheim.my dear Millbank, we have met at last,' said his friend.And here we must for a moment revert to what had occurred to Coningsby
since he so suddenly quitted Paris at the beginning of the year.The
wound he had received was deep to one unused to wounds.Yet, after all,
none had outraged his feelings, no one had betrayed his hopes.He had
loved one who had loved another.And
yet 'tis a bitter pang under any circumstances to find another preferred
to yourself.It is about the same blow as one would probably feel if
falling from a balloon.Your Icarian flight melts into a grovelling
existence, scarcely superior to that of a sponge or a coral, or redeemed
only from utter insensibility by your frank detestation of your rival.It is quite impossible to conceal that Coningsby had imbibed for Sidonia
a certain degree of aversion, which, in these days of exaggerated
phrase, might even be described as hatred.And there had seemed between them a sympathy so native and spontaneous,
creating at once the charm of intimacy without any of the disenchanting
attributes that are occasionally its consequence.He would recall the
tones of her voice, the expression of her soft dark eye, the airy spirit
and frank graciousness, sometimes even the flattering blush, with which
she had ever welcomed one of whom she had heard so long and so kindly.It seemed, to use a sweet and homely phrase, that they were made for
each other; the circumstances of their mutual destinies might have
combined into one enchanting fate.And yet, had she accorded him that peerless boon, her heart, with what
aspect was he to communicate this consummation of all his hopes to his
grandfather, ask Lord Monmouth for his blessing, and the gracious favour
of an establishment for the daughter of his foe, of a man whose name was
never mentioned except to cloud his visage?what was that mystery
that connected the haughty house of Coningsby with the humble blood of
the Lancashire manufacturer?Why was the portrait of his mother beneath
the roof of Millbank?Coningsby had delicately touched upon the subject
both with Edith and the Wallingers, but the result of his inquiries
only involved the question in deeper gloom.Edith had none but maternal
relatives: more than once she had mentioned this, and the Wallingers, on
other occasions, had confirmed the remark.Coningsby had sometimes drawn
the conversation to pictures, and he would remind her with playfulness
of their first unconscious meeting in the gallery of the Rue Tronchet;
then he remembered that Mr.Millbank was fond of pictures; then he
recollected some specimens of Mr.Millbank's collection, and after
touching on several which could not excite suspicion, he came to
'a portrait, a portrait of a lady; was it a portrait or an ideal
countenance?'Edith thought she had heard it was a portrait, but she was by no means
certain, and most assuredly was quite unacquainted with the name of the
original, if there were an original.Coningsby addressed himself to the point with Sir Joseph.He inquired of
the uncle explicitly whether he knew anything on the subject.Sir Joseph
was of opinion that it was something that Millbank had somewhere 'picked
up.'Millbank used often to 'pick up' pictures.Disappointed in his love, Coningsby sought refuge in the excitement
of study, and in the brooding imagination of an aspiring spirit.The
softness of his heart seemed to have quitted him for ever.He recurred
to his habitual reveries of political greatness and public distinction.And as it ever seemed to him that no preparation could be complete
for the career which he planned for himself, he devoted himself with
increased ardour to that digestion of knowledge which converts it into
wisdom.His life at Cambridge was now a life of seclusion.With the
exception of a few Eton friends, he avoided all society.And, indeed,
his acquisitions during this term were such as few have equalled, and
could only have been mastered by a mental discipline of a severe and
exalted character.At the end of the term Coningsby took his degree, and
in a few days was about to quit that university where, on the whole,
he had passed three serene and happy years in the society of fond and
faithful friends, and in ennobling pursuits.He had many plans for his
impending movements, yet none of them very mature ones.Lord Vere wished
Coningsby to visit his family in the north, and afterwards to go to
Scotland together: Coningsby was more inclined to travel for a year.Amid this hesitation a circumstance occurred which decided him to adopt
neither of these courses.It was Commencement, and coming out of the quadrangle of St.John's,
Coningsby came suddenly upon Sir Joseph and Lady Wallinger, who were
visiting the marvels and rarities of the university.Coningsby was a little embarrassed, for he could not forget the abrupt
manner in which he had parted from them; but they greeted him with
so much cordiality that he instantly recovered himself, and, turning,
became their companion.He hardly ventured to ask after Edith: at
length, in a depressed tone and a hesitating manner, he inquired whether
they had lately seen Miss Millbank.He was himself surprised at the
extreme light-heartedness which came over him the moment he heard she
was in England, at Millbank, with her family.He always very much liked
Lady Wallinger, but this morning he hung over her like a lover, lavished
on her unceasing and the most delicate attentions, seemed to exist only
in the idea of making the Wallingers enjoy and understand Cambridge;
and no one else was to be their guide at any place or under any
circumstances.He told them exactly what they were to see; how they were
to see it; when they were to see it.He told them of things which nobody
did see, but which they should.He insisted that Sir Joseph should dine
with him in hall; Sir Joseph could not think of leaving Lady Wallinger;
Lady Wallinger could not think of Sir Joseph missing an opportunity that
might never offer again.Besides, they might both join her after dinner.Except to give her husband a dinner, Coningsby evidently intended never
to leave her side.And the next morning, the occasion favourable, being alone with the
lady, Sir Joseph bustling about a carriage, Coningsby said suddenly,
with a countenance a little disturbed, and in a low voice, 'I was
pleased, I mean surprised, to hear that there was still a Miss Millbank;
I thought by this time she might have borne another name?'Lady Wallinger looked at him with an expression of some perplexity, and
then said, 'Yes, Edith was much admired; but she need not be precipitate
in marrying.Marriage is for a woman _the_ event.Edith is too precious
to be carelessly bestowed.''But I understood,' said Coningsby, 'when I left Paris,' and here, he
became very confused, 'that Miss Millbank was engaged, on the point of
marriage.''I am sure that Edith would never marry Monsieur de Sidonia, nor
Monsieur de Sidonia, Edith.'Possibly,' said Lady Wallinger; 'but he never even intimated his
admiration.''But he was very attentive to Miss Millbank?''Not more than our intimate friendship authorised, and might expect.''You have known Sidonia a long time?''It was Monsieur de Sidonia's father who introduced us to the care
of Mr.Wallinger,' said Lady Wallinger, 'and therefore I have ever
entertained for his son a sincere regard.Besides, I look upon him as
a compatriot.Recently he has been even more than usually kind to us,
especially to Edith.While we were at Paris he recovered for her a great
number of jewels which had been left to her by her uncle in Spain;
and, what she prized infinitely more, the whole of her mother's
correspondence which she maintained with this relative since her
marriage.Nothing but the influence of Sidonia could have effected this.Therefore, of course, Edith is attached to him almost as much as I am.In short, he is our dearest friend; our counsellor in all our cares.But
as for marrying him, the idea is ridiculous to those who know Monsieur
Sidonia.No earthly consideration would ever induce him to impair that
purity of race on which he prides himself.Besides, there are other
obvious objections which would render an alliance between him and my
niece utterly impossible: Edith is quite as devoted to her religion as
Monsieur Sidonia can be to his race.'A ray of light flashed on the brain of Coningsby as Lady Wallinger said
these words.The agitated interview, which never could be explained
away, already appeared in quite a different point of view.He became
pensive, remained silent, was relieved when Sir Joseph, whose return he
had hitherto deprecated, reappeared.Coningsby learnt in the course of
the day that the Wallingers were about to make, and immediately, a visit
to Hellingsley; their first visit; indeed, this was the first year that
Mr.Millbank had taken up his abode there.He did not much like the
change of life, Sir Joseph told Coningsby, but Edith was delighted with
Hellingsley, which Sir Joseph understood was a very distinguished place,
with fine gardens, of which his niece was particularly fond.When Coningsby returned to his rooms, those rooms which he was soon
about to quit for ever, in arranging some papers preparatory to his
removal, his eye lighted on a too-long unanswered letter of Oswald
Millbank.Coningsby had often projected a visit to Oxford, which he much
desired to make, but hitherto it had been impossible for him to effect
it, except in the absence of Millbank; and he had frequently postponed
it that he might combine his first visit to that famous seat of learning
with one to his old schoolfellow and friend.And immediately Coningsby wrote to apprise Millbank that he had
taken his degree, was free, and prepared to pay him immediately the
long-projected visit.Three years and more had elapsed since they had
quitted Eton.What new ideas, new
feelings, vast and novel knowledge!Though they had not met, they were
nevertheless familiar with the progress and improvement of each other's
minds.Their suggestive correspondence was too valuable to both of them
to have been otherwise than cherished.And now they were to meet on
the eve of entering that world for which they had made so sedulous a
preparation.There are few things in life more interesting than an unrestrained
interchange of ideas with a congenial spirit, and there are few things
more rare.How very seldom do you encounter in the world a man of great
abilities, acquirements, experience, who will unmask his mind, unbutton
his brains, and pour forth in careless and picturesque phrase all the
results of his studies and observation; his knowledge of men, books, and
nature.On the contrary, if a man has by any chance what he conceives
an original idea, he hoards it as if it were old gold; and rather avoids
the subject with which he is most conversant, from fear that you may
appropriate his best thoughts.One of the principal causes of our
renowned dulness in conversation is our extreme intellectual jealousy.It must be admitted that in this respect authors, but especially poets,
bear the palm.They never think they are sufficiently appreciated, and
live in tremor lest a brother should distinguish himself.Artists have
the repute of being nearly as bad.And as for a small rising politician,
a clever speech by a supposed rival or suspected candidate for office
destroys his appetite and disturbs his slumbers.One of the chief delights and benefits of travel is, that one is
perpetually meeting men of great abilities, of original mind, and rare
acquirements, who will converse without reserve.In these discourses
the intellect makes daring leaps and marvellous advances.The tone that
colours our afterlife is often caught in these chance colloquies, and
the bent given that shapes a career.And yet perhaps there is no occasion when the heart is more open, the
brain more quick, the memory more rich and happy, or the tongue more
prompt and eloquent, than when two school-day friends, knit by every
sympathy of intelligence and affection, meet at the close of their
college careers, after a long separation, hesitating, as it were, on
the verge of active life, and compare together their conclusions of the
interval; impart to each other all their thoughts and secret plans
and projects; high fancies and noble aspirations; glorious visions of
personal fame and national regeneration.Man is never so manly as when he feels deeply, acts boldly, and
expresses himself with frankness and with fervour.Most assuredly there never was a congress of friendship wherein more was
said and felt than in this meeting, so long projected, and yet perhaps
on the whole so happily procrastinated, between Coningsby and Millbank.In a moment they seemed as if they had never parted.Their faithful
correspondence indeed had maintained the chain of sentiment unbroken.Not an author that had influenced their taste or judgment
but was canvassed and criticised; not a theory they had framed or a
principle they had adopted that was not confessed.Often, with boyish
glee still lingering with their earnest purpose, they shouted as they
discovered that they had formed the same opinion or adopted the same
conclusion.They talked all day and late into the night.They condensed
into a week the poignant conclusions of three years of almost unbroken
study.And one night, as they sat together in Millbank's rooms at
Oriel, their conversation having for some time taken a political colour,
Millbank said,

'Now tell me, Coningsby, exactly what you conceive to be the state of
parties in this country; for it seems to me that if we penetrate the
surface, the classification must be more simple than their many names
would intimate.''The principle of the exclusive constitution of England having been
conceded by the Acts of 1827-8-32,' said Coningsby, 'a party has arisen
in the State who demand that the principle of political liberalism
shall consequently be carried to its extent; which it appears to them is
impossible without getting rid of the fragments of the old constitution
that remain.This is the destructive party; a party with distinct and
intelligible principles.They seek a specific for the evils of our
social system in the general suffrage of the population.'They are resisted by another party, who, having given up exclusion,
would only embrace as much liberalism as is necessary for the moment;
who, without any embarrassing promulgation of principles, wish to keep
things as they find them as long as they can, and then will manage them
as they find them as well as they can; but as a party must have the
semblance of principles, they take the names of the things that they
have destroyed.Thus they are devoted to the prerogatives of the Crown,
although in truth the Crown has been stripped of every one of its
prerogatives; they affect a great veneration for the constitution in
Church and State, though every one knows that the constitution in Church
and State no longer exists; they are ready to stand or fall with the
"independence of the Upper House of Parliament", though, in practice,
they are perfectly aware that, with their sanction, "the Upper House"
has abdicated its initiatory functions, and now serves only as a court
of review of the legislation of the House of Commons.Whenever public
opinion, which this party never attempts to form, to educate, or to
lead, falls into some violent perplexity, passion, or caprice, this
party yields without a struggle to the impulse, and, when the storm has
passed, attempts to obstruct and obviate the logical and, ultimately,
the inevitable results of the very measures they have themselves
originated, or to which they have consented.'I care not whether men are called Whigs or Tories, Radicals or
Chartists, or by what nickname a bustling and thoughtless race may
designate themselves; but these two divisions comprehend at present the
English nation.'With regard to the first school, I for one have no faith in the
remedial qualities of a government carried on by a neglected democracy,
who, for three centuries, have received no education.What prospect does
it offer us of those high principles of conduct with which we have
fed our imaginations and strengthened our will?I perceive none of the
elements of government that should secure the happiness of a people and
the greatness of a realm.'But in my opinion, if Democracy be combated only by Conservatism,
Democracy must triumph, and at no distant date.The man who enters public life at this epoch has to choose
between Political Infidelity and a Destructive Creed.''This, then,' said Millbank, 'is the dilemma to which we are brought
by nearly two centuries of Parliamentary Monarchy and Parliamentary
Church.'''Tis true,' said Coningsby.'We cannot conceal it from ourselves,
that the first has made Government detested, and the second Religion
disbelieved.''Many men in this country,' said Millbank, 'and especially in the class
to which I belong, are reconciled to the contemplation of democracy;
because they have accustomed themselves to believe, that it is the
only power by which we can sweep away those sectional privileges and
interests that impede the intelligence and industry of the community.''And yet,' said Coningsby, 'the only way to terminate what, in the
language of the present day, is called Class Legislation, is not to
entrust power to classes.You would find a Locofoco majority as much
addicted to Class Legislation as a factitious aristocracy.The only
power that has no class sympathy is the Sovereign.''But suppose the case of an arbitrary Sovereign, what would be your
check against him?''Suppose it was to vote itself perpetual?''And is public opinion of less influence on an individual than on a
body?'A nation may be misled, may be
corrupt.''If the nation that elects the Parliament be corrupt, the elected body
will resemble it.But this
only shows that there is something to be considered beyond forms of
government, national character.And herein mainly should we repose our
hopes.If a nation be led to aim at the good and the great, depend upon
it, whatever be its form, the government will respond to its convictions
and its sentiments.''Far from it: I look upon political change as the greatest of evils,
for it comprehends all.But if we have no faith in the permanence of
the existing settlement, if the very individuals who established it are,
year after year, proposing their modifications or their reconstructions;
so also, while we uphold what exists, ought we to prepare ourselves for
the change we deem impending?'Now I would not that either ourselves, or our fellow-citizens, should
be taken unawares as in 1832, when the very men who opposed the Reform
Bill offered contrary objections to it which destroyed each other, so
ignorant were they of its real character, its historical causes, its
political consequences.We should now so act that, when the occasions
arrives, we should clearly comprehend what we want, and have formed an
opinion as to the best means by which that want can be supplied.'For this purpose I would accustom the public mind to the contemplation
of an existing though torpid power in the constitution, capable
of removing our social grievances, were we to transfer to it those
prerogatives which the Parliament has gradually usurped, and used in
a manner which has produced the present material and moral
disorganisation.The House of Commons is the house of a few; the
Sovereign is the sovereign of all.The proper leader of the people is
the individual who sits upon the throne.''Then you abjure the Representative principle?'Representation is not necessarily, or even in a principal
sense, Parliamentary.Parliament is not sitting at this moment, and yet
the nation is represented in its highest as well as in its most minute
interests.I see in the
newspaper this morning that a pedagogue has brutally chastised his
pupil.We must not forget that a
principle of government is reserved for our days that we shall not find
in our Aristotles, or even in the forests of Tacitus, nor in our Saxon
Wittenagemotes, nor in our Plantagenet parliaments.Opinion is now
supreme, and Opinion speaks in print.The representation of the Press is
far more complete than the representation of Parliament.Parliamentary
representation was the happy device of a ruder age, to which it was
admirably adapted: an age of semi-civilisation, when there was a leading
class in the community; but it exhibits many symptoms of desuetude.It is controlled by a system of representation more vigorous and
comprehensive; which absorbs its duties and fulfils them more
efficiently, and in which discussion is pursued on fairer terms, and
often with more depth and information.''And to what power would you entrust the function of Taxation?''To some power that would employ it more discreetly than in creating
our present amount of debt, and in establishing our present system of
imposts.'In a word, true wisdom lies in the policy that would effect its ends
by the influence of opinion, and yet by the means of existing forms.Nevertheless, if we are forced to revolutions, let us propose to our
consideration the idea of a free monarchy, established on fundamental
laws, itself the apex of a vast pile of municipal and local government,
ruling an educated people, represented by a free and intellectual press.Before such a royal authority, supported by such a national opinion, the
sectional anomalies of our country would disappear.Under such a system,
where qualification would not be parliamentary, but personal, even
statesmen would be educated; we should have no more diplomatists who
could not speak French, no more bishops ignorant of theology, no more
generals-in-chief who never saw a field.'Now there is a polity adapted to our laws, our institutions, our
feelings, our manners, our traditions; a polity capable of great ends
and appealing to high sentiments; a polity which, in my opinion, would
render government an object of national affection, which would terminate
sectional anomalies, assuage religious heats, and extinguish Chartism.''You said to me yesterday,' said Millbank after a pause, 'quoting the
words of another, which you adopted, that Man was made to adore and to
obey.Now you have shown to me the means by which you deem it possible
that government might become no longer odious to the subject; you have
shown how man may be induced to obey.But there are duties and interests
for man beyond political obedience, and social comfort, and national
greatness, higher interests and greater duties.How would you deal
with their spiritual necessities?You think you can combat political
infidelity in a nation by the principle of enlightened loyalty; how
would you encounter religious infidelity in a state?By what means is
the principle of profound reverence to be revived?How, in short, is man
to be led to adore?'that is a subject which I have not forgotten,' replied Coningsby.'I know from your letters how deeply it has engaged your thoughts.I confess to you that it has often filled mine with perplexity and
depression.When we were at Eton, and both of us impregnated with the
contrary prejudices in which we had been brought up, there was still
between us one common ground of sympathy and trust; we reposed with
confidence and affection in the bosom of our Church.Time and thought,
with both of us, have only matured the spontaneous veneration of our
boyhood.But time and thought have also shown me that the Church of our
heart is not in a position, as regards the community, consonant with its
original and essential character, or with the welfare of the nation.''The character of a Church is universality,' replied Millbank.'Once
the Church in this country was universal in principle and practice; when
wedded to the State, it continued at least universal in principle, if
not in practice.All ties between the State and
the Church are abolished, except those which tend to its danger and
degradation.'What can be more anomalous than the present connection between State
and Church?Every condition on which it was originally consented to
has been cancelled.That original alliance was, in my view, an equal
calamity for the nation and the Church; but, at least, it was an
intelligible compact.Parliament, then consisting only of members of
the Established Church, was, on ecclesiastical matters, a lay synod, and
might, in some points of view, be esteemed a necessary portion of Church
government.But you have effaced this exclusive character of Parliament;
you have determined that a communion with the Established Church shall
no longer be part of the qualification for sitting in the House of
Commons.There is no reason, so far as the constitution avails, why
every member of the House of Commons should not be a dissenter.But the
whole power of the country is concentrated in the House of Commons.The House of Lords, even the Monarch himself, has openly announced and
confessed, within these ten years, that the will of the House of Commons
is supreme.A single vote of the House of Commons, in 1832, made the
Duke of Wellington declare, in the House of Lords, that he was obliged
to abandon his sovereign in "the most difficult and distressing
circumstances.""L'Etat c'est moi."The House of Commons virtually appoints the bishops.A sectarian assembly appoints the bishops of the Established Church.James II was expelled the throne
because he appointed a Roman Catholic to an Anglican see.A Parliament
might do this to-morrow with impunity.And this is the constitution in
Church and State which Conservative dinners toast!The only consequences
of the present union of Church and State are, that, on the side of the
State, there is perpetual interference in ecclesiastical government, and
on the side of the Church a sedulous avoidance of all those principles
on which alone Church government can be established, and by the
influence of which alone can the Church of England again become
universal.''But it is urged that the State protects its revenues?''No ecclesiastical revenues should be safe that require protection.Modern history is a history of Church spoliation.Not by
the people; not by the democracy.No; it is the emperor, the king, the
feudal baron, the court minion.The estate of the Church is the estate
of the people, so long as the Church is governed on its real principles.The Church is the medium by which the despised and degraded classes
assert the native equality of man, and vindicate the rights and power
of intellect.It made, in the darkest hour of Norman rule, the son of
a Saxon pedlar Primate of England, and placed Nicholas Breakspear, a
Hertfordshire peasant, on the throne of the Caesars.It would do as
great things now, if it were divorced from the degrading and tyrannical
connection that enchains it.You would have other sons of peasants
Bishops of England, instead of men appointed to that sacred office
solely because they were the needy scions of a factitious aristocracy;
men of gross ignorance, profligate habits, and grinding extortion, who
have disgraced the episcopal throne, and profaned the altar.''But surely you cannot justly extend such a description to the present
bench?''Surely not: I speak of the past, of the past that has produced so much
present evil.We live in decent times; frigid, latitudinarian, alarmed,
decorous.A priest is scarcely deemed in our days a fit successor to the
authors of the gospels, if he be not the editor of a Greek play; and he
who follows St.Paul must now at least have been private tutor of
some young nobleman who has taken a good degree!And then you are
all astonished that the Church is not universal!nothing but the
indestructibleness of its principles, however feebly pursued, could have
maintained even the disorganised body that still survives.'And yet, my dear Coningsby, with all its past errors and all its
present deficiencies, it is by the Church; I would have said until I
listened to you to-night; by the Church alone that I see any chance of
regenerating the national character.The parochial system, though
shaken by the fatal poor-law, is still the most ancient, the most
comprehensive, and the most popular institution of the country; the
younger priests are, in general, men whose souls are awake to the high
mission which they have to fulfil, and which their predecessors so
neglected; there is, I think, a rising feeling in the community, that
parliamentary intercourse in matters ecclesiastical has not tended
either to the spiritual or the material elevation of the humbler
orders.Divorce the Church from the State, and the spiritual power that
struggled against the brute force of the dark ages, against tyrannical
monarchs and barbarous barons, will struggle again in opposition to
influences of a different form, but of a similar tendency; equally
selfish, equally insensible, equally barbarising.The priests of God are
the tribunes of the people.that with such a mission they
should ever have cringed in the antechambers of ministers, or bowed
before parliamentary committees!''The Utilitarian system is dead,' said Coningsby.'It has passed through
the heaven of philosophy like a hailstorm, cold, noisy, sharp, and
peppering, and it has melted away.And yet can we wonder that it found
some success, when we consider the political ignorance and social torpor
which it assailed?Anointed kings turned into chief magistrates, and
therefore much overpaid; estates of the realm changed into parliaments
of virtual representation, and therefore requiring real reform; holy
Church transformed into national establishment, and therefore grumbled
at by all the nation for whom it was not supported.What an inevitable
harvest of sedition, radicalism, infidelity!I really think there is no
society, however great its resources, that could long resist the united
influences of chief magistrate, virtual representation, and Church
establishment!''I have immense faith in the new generation,' said Millbank, eagerly.'It is a holy thing to see a state saved by its youth,' said Coningsby;
and then he added, in a tone of humility, if not of depression,
'But what a task!What a variety of qualities, what a combination
of circumstances is requisite!What bright abilities and what noble
patience!What confidence from the people, what favour from the Most
High!''But He will favour us,' said Millbank.'And I say to you as Nathan said
unto David, "Thou art the man!"You were our leader at Eton; the friends
of your heart and boyhood still cling and cluster round you!they are
all men whose position forces them into public life.It is a nucleus of
honour, faith, and power.It is our privilege to live in an age when the career of the highest
ambition is identified with the performance of the greatest good.Of the
present epoch it may be truly said, "Who dares to be good, dares to be
great."''Heaven is above all,' said Coningsby.'The curtain of our fate is
still undrawn.We are happy in our friends, dear Millbank, and whatever
lights, we will stand together.For myself, I prefer fame to life;
and yet, the consciousness of heroic deeds to the most wide-spread
celebrity.'The beautiful light of summer had never shone on a scene and surrounding
landscape which recalled happier images of English nature, and better
recollections of English manners, than that to which we would now
introduce our readers.One of those true old English Halls, now
unhappily so rare, built in the time of the Tudors, and in its elaborate
timber-framing and decorative woodwork indicating, perhaps, the scarcity
of brick and stone at the period of its structure, as much as the
grotesque genius of its fabricator, rose on a terrace surrounded
by ancient and very formal gardens.The hall itself, during many
generations, had been vigilantly and tastefully preserved by its
proprietors.There was not a point which was not as fresh as if it had
been renovated but yesterday.It stood a huge and strange blending
of Grecian, Gothic, and Italian architecture, with a wild dash of the
fantastic in addition.The lantern watch-towers of a baronial castle
were placed in juxtaposition with Doric columns employed for chimneys,
while under oriel windows might be observed Italian doorways with
Grecian pediments.Beyond the extensive gardens an avenue of Spanish
chestnuts at each point of the compass approached the mansion, or led
into a small park which was table-land, its limits opening on all sides
to beautiful and extensive valleys, sparkling with cultivation, except
at one point, where the river Darl formed the boundary of the domain,
and then spread in many a winding through the rich country beyond.Such was Hellingsley, the new home that Oswald Millbank was about to
visit for the first time.Coningsby and himself had travelled together
as far as Darlford, where their roads diverged, and they had separated
with an engagement on the part of Coningsby to visit Hellingsley on the
morrow.As they had travelled along, Coningsby had frequently led the
conversation to domestic topics; gradually he had talked, and
talked much of Edith.Without an obtrusive curiosity, he extracted,
unconsciously to his companion, traits of her character and early days,
which filled him with a wild and secret interest.The thought that in a
few hours he was to meet her again, infused into his being a degree of
transport, which the very necessity of repressing before his companion
rendered more magical and thrilling.How often it happens in life that
we have with a grave face to discourse of ordinary topics, while all the
time our heart and memory are engrossed with some enchanting secret!The castle of his grandfather presented a far different scene on the
arrival of Coningsby from that which it had offered on his first visit.The Marquess had given him a formal permission to repair to it at
his pleasure, and had instructed the steward accordingly.But he came
without notice, at a season of the year when the absence of all sports
made his arrival unexpected.The scattered and sauntering household
roused themselves into action, and contemplated the conviction that it
might be necessary to do some service for their wages.There was a stir
in that vast, sleepy castle.At last the steward was found, and came
forward to welcome their young master, whose simple wants were limited
to the rooms he had formerly occupied.Coningsby reached the castle a little before sunset, almost the same
hour that he had arrived there more than three years ago.How much had
happened in the interval!Coningsby had already lived long enough to
find interest in pondering over the past.That past too must inevitably
exercise a great influence over his present.He recalled his morning
drive with his grandfather, to the brink of that river which was
the boundary between his own domain and Hellingsley.Who dwelt at
Hellingsley now?Restless, excited, not insensible to the difficulties, perhaps the
dangers of his position, yet full of an entrancing emotion in which all
thoughts and feelings seemed to merge, Coningsby went forth into the
fair gardens to muse over his love amid objects as beautiful.A rosy
light hung over the rare shrubs and tall fantastic trees; while a rich
yet darker tint suffused the distant woods.This euthanasia of the day
exercises a strange influence on the hearts of those who love.But as for Coningsby, the mitigating hour that softens the heart made
his spirit brave.Amid the ennobling sympathies of nature, the pursuits
and purposes of worldly prudence and conventional advantage subsided
into their essential nothingness.He willed to blend his life and fate
with a being beautiful as that nature that subdued him, and he felt in
his own breast the intrinsic energies that in spite of all obstacles
should mould such an imagination into reality.He descended the <DW72>s, now growing dimmer in the fleeting light, into
the park.The stillness was almost supernatural; the jocund sounds of
day had died, and the voices of the night had not commenced.A sacred calm had succeeded to that distraction of
emotion which had agitated him the whole day, while he had mused over
his love and the infinite and insurmountable barriers that seemed to
oppose his will.Now he felt one of those strong groundless convictions
that are the inspirations of passion, that all would yield to him as to
one holding an enchanted wand.Onward he strolled; it seemed without purpose, yet always proceeding.A
pale and then gleaming tint stole over the masses of mighty timber; and
soon a glittering light flooded the lawns and glades.The moon was high
in her summer heaven, and still Coningsby strolled on.He crossed the
broad lawns, he traversed the bright glades: amid the gleaming and
shadowy woods, he traced his prescient way.He came to the bank of a rushing river, foaming in the moonlight, and
wafting on its blue breast the shadow of a thousand stars.he said, 'that rollest to my mistress, bear her, bear her my
heart!'Lady Wallinger and Edith were together in the morning room of
Hellingsley, the morrow after the arrival of Oswald.Edith was arranging
flowers in a vase, while her aunt was embroidering a Spanish peasant in
correct costume.The daughter of Millbank looked as bright and fragrant
as the fair creations that surrounded her.Beautiful to watch her as she
arranged their forms and composed their groups; to mark her eye glance
with gratification at some happy combination of colour, or to listen to
her delight as they wafted to her in gratitude their perfume.Oswald and
Sir Joseph were surveying the stables; Mr.Millbank, who had been daily
expected for the last week from the factories, had not yet arrived.'I must say he gained my heart from the first,' said Lady Wallinger.'I wish the gardener would send us more roses,' said Edith.'He is so very superior to any young man I ever met,' continued Lady
Wallinger.'I think we must have this vase entirely of roses; don't you think so,
aunt?''I am fond of roses,' said Lady Wallinger.Coningsby gave us at Paris, Edith!''I must say, I was very happy when I met Mr.Coningsby again at
Cambridge,' said Lady Wallinger.'It gave me much greater pleasure than
seeing any of the colleges.''And very naturally,' said Lady Wallinger.'Oswald ought to deem
himself fortunate in having such a friend.Coningsby when we met him at Cambridge is what I never shall forget.But
he always was my favourite from the first time I saw him at Paris.Do
you know, Edith, I liked him best of all your admirers.'no, aunt,' said Edith, smiling, 'not more than Lord Beaumanoir; you
forget your great favourite, Lord Beaumanoir.'Coningsby at Rome,' said Lady Wallinger; 'I
cannot agree that anybody is equal to Mr.I cannot tell you
how pleased I am that he is our neighbour!'As Lady Wallinger gave a finishing stroke to the jacket of her
Andalusian, Edith, vividly blushing, yet speaking in a voice of affected
calmness, said,

'Here is Mr.And, truly, at this moment our hero might be discerned, approaching the
hall by one of the avenues; and in a few minutes there was a ringing at
the hall bell, and then, after a short pause, the servants announced Mr.Coningsby, and ushered him into the morning room.Edith was embarrassed; the frankness and the gaiety of her manner had
deserted her; Coningsby was rather earnest than self-possessed.Each
felt at first that the presence of Lady Wallinger was a relief.The
ordinary topics of conversation were in sufficient plenty; reminiscences
of Paris, impressions of Hellingsley, his visit to Oxford, Lady
Wallinger's visit to Cambridge.In ten minutes their voices seemed to
sound to each other as they did in the Rue de Rivoli, and their mutual
perplexity had in a great degree subsided.Oswald and Sir Joseph now entered the room, and the conversation became
general.Hellingsley was the subject on which Coningsby dwelt; he was
charmed with all that he had seen!Sir Joseph was
quite prepared to accompany him; but Lady Wallinger, who seemed to read
Coningsby's wishes in his eyes, proposed that the inspection should be
general; and in the course of half an hour Coningsby was walking by the
side of Edith, and sympathising with all the natural charms to which her
quick taste and lively expression called his notice and appreciation.Few things more delightful than a country ramble with a sweet companion!Exploring woods, wandering over green commons, loitering in shady lanes,
resting on rural stiles; the air full of perfume, the heart full of
bliss!It seemed to Coningsby that he had never been happy before.His heart was as
sunny as the summer scene.Past and Future were absorbed in the flowing
hour; not an allusion to Paris, not a speculation on what might arrive;
but infinite expressions of agreement, sympathy; a multitude of slight
phrases, that, however couched, had but one meaning, congeniality.He
felt each moment his voice becoming more tender; his heart gushing
in soft expressions; each moment he was more fascinated; her step was
grace, her glance was beauty.Now she touched him by some phrase of
sweet simplicity; or carried him spell-bound by her airy merriment.Oswald assumed that Coningsby remained to dine with them.There was not
even the ceremony of invitation.Coningsby could not but remember his
dinner at Millbank, and the timid hostess whom he then addressed so
often in vain, as he gazed upon the bewitching and accomplished woman
whom he now passionately loved.Oswald,
happy in his friend being his guest, under his own roof, indulged in
unwonted gaiety.The ladies withdrew; Sir Joseph began to talk politics, although the
young men had threatened their fair companions immediately to follow
them.This was the period of the Bed-Chamber Plot, when Sir Robert Peel
accepted and resigned power in the course of three days.Sir Joseph,
who had originally made up his mind to support a Conservative government
when he deemed it inevitable, had for the last month endeavoured to
compensate for this trifling error by vindicating the conduct of his
friends, and reprobating the behaviour of those who would deprive her
Majesty of the 'friends-of-her-youth.'Sir Joseph was a most chivalrous
champion of the 'friends-of-her-youth' principle.Sir Joseph, who was
always moderate and conciliatory in his talk, though he would go, at any
time, any lengths for his party, expressed himself to-day with
extreme sobriety, as he was determined not to hurt the feelings of
Mr.Coningsby, and he principally confined himself to urging temperate
questions, somewhat in the following fashion:--

'I admit that, on the whole, under ordinary circumstances, it would
perhaps have been more convenient that these appointments should have
remained with Sir Robert; but don't you think that, under the peculiar
circumstances, being friends of her Majesty's youth?'&c.

Sir Joseph was extremely astonished when Coningsby replied that he
thought, under no circumstances, should any appointment in the Royal
Household be dependent on the voice of the House of Commons, though he
was far from admiring the 'friends-of-her-youth' principle, which he
looked upon as impertinent.'But surely,' said Sir Joseph, 'the Minister being responsible to
Parliament, it must follow that all great offices of State should be
filled at his discretion.''But where do you find this principle of Ministerial responsibility?''And is not a Minister responsible to his Sovereign?'He had always heard that Ministers
were responsible to Parliament; and he had a vague conviction,
notwithstanding the reanimating loyalty of the Bed-Chamber Plot, that
the Sovereign of England was a nonentity.He took refuge in indefinite
expressions, and observed, 'The Responsibility of Ministers is surely a
constitutional doctrine.''The Ministers of the Crown are responsible to their master; they are
not the Ministers of Parliament.''But then you know virtually,' said Sir Joseph, 'the Parliament, that
is, the House of Commons, governs the country.''It did before 1832,' said Coningsby; 'but that is all past now.We got
rid of that with the Venetian Constitution.''We were governed in this country by the
Venetian Constitution from the accession of the House of Hanover.And now I hope we are in a state of transition from
the Italian Dogeship to the English Monarchy.''King, Lords, and Commons, the Venetian Constitution!''But they were phrases,' said Coningsby, 'not facts.The King was a
Doge; the Cabinet the Council of Ten.Your Parliament, that you call
Lords and Commons, was nothing more than the Great Council of Nobles.''The resemblance was complete,' said Millbank, 'and no wonder, for it
was not accidental; the Venetian Constitution was intentionally copied.''We should have had the Venetian Republic in 1640,' said Coningsby, 'had
it not been for the Puritans.'I am sure these ideas are not very generally known,' said Sir Joseph,
bewildered.'Because you have had your history written by the Venetian party,' said
Coningsby, 'and it has been their interest to conceal them.''I will venture to say that there are very few men on our side in the
House of Commons,' said Sir Joseph, 'who are aware that they were born
under a Venetian Constitution.''Let us go to the ladies,' said Millbank, smiling.Edith was reading a letter as they entered.'A letter from papa,' she exclaimed, looking up at her brother with
great animation.'We may expect him every day; and yet, alas!They now all spoke of Millbank, and Coningsby was happy that he was
familiar with the scene.At length he ventured to say to Edith, 'You
once made me a promise which you never fulfilled.'The song that you promised me at Millbank more than three years ago.'Then they spoke for a while of other recollections, and then Coningsby
appealing to Lady Wallinger for her influence, Edith rose and took up
her guitar.Her voice was rich and sweet; the air she sang gay, even
fantastically frolic, such as the girls of Granada chaunt trooping home
from some country festival; her soft, dark eye brightened with joyous
sympathy; and ever and anon, with an arch grace, she beat the guitar, in
chorus, with her pretty hand.The moon wanes; and Coningsby must leave these enchanted halls.Oswald
walked homeward with him until he reached the domain of his grandfather.Then mounting his horse, Coningsby bade his friend farewell till the
morrow, and made his best way to the Castle.CHAPTER V.


There is a romance in every life.The emblazoned page of Coningsby's
existence was now open.It had been prosperous before, with some moments
of excitement, some of delight; but they had all found, as it were,
their origin in worldly considerations, or been inevitably mixed up with
them.At Paris, for example, he loved, or thought he loved.But there
not an hour could elapse without his meeting some person, or hearing
something, which disturbed the beauty of his emotions, or broke his
spell-bound thoughts.There was his grandfather hating the Millbanks,
or Sidonia loving them; and common people, in the common world, making
common observations on them; asking who they were, or telling who they
were; and brushing the bloom off all life's fresh delicious fancies with
their coarse handling.He loved passionately, and he loved
in a scene and in a society as sweet, as pure, and as refined as his
imagination and his heart.There was no malicious gossip, no callous
chatter to profane his ear and desecrate his sentiment.All that he
heard or saw was worthy of the summer sky, the still green woods, the
gushing river, the gardens and terraces, the stately and fantastic
dwellings, among which his life now glided as in some dainty and
gorgeous masque.All the soft, social, domestic sympathies of his nature, which, however
abundant, had never been cultivated, were developed by the life he was
now leading.It was not merely that he lived in the constant presence,
and under the constant influence of one whom he adored, that made him so
happy.He was surrounded by beings who found felicity in the interchange
of kind feelings and kind words, in the cultivation of happy talents and
refined tastes, and the enjoyment of a life which their own good sense
and their own good hearts made them both comprehend and appreciate.Ambition lost much of its splendour, even his lofty aspirations
something of their hallowing impulse of paramount duty, when Coningsby
felt how much ennobling delight was consistent with the seclusion of a
private station; and mused over an existence to be passed amid woods and
waterfalls with a fair hand locked in his, or surrounded by his friends
in some ancestral hall.The morning after his first visit to Hellingsley Coningsby rejoined his
friends, as he had promised Oswald at their breakfast-table; and day
after day he came with the early sun, and left them only when the late
moon silvered the keep of Coningsby Castle.Millbank, who wrote
daily, and was daily to be expected, did not arrive.A week, a week
of unbroken bliss, had vanished away, passed in long rides and longer
walks, sunset saunterings, and sometimes moonlit strolls; talking of
flowers, and thinking of things even sweeter; listening to delicious
songs, and sometimes reading aloud some bright romance or some inspiring
lay.One day Coningsby, who arrived at the hall unexpectedly late; indeed it
was some hours past noon, for he had been detained by despatches
which arrived at the Castle from Mr.Rigby, and which required his
interposition; found the ladies alone, and was told that Sir Joseph and
Oswald were at the fishing-cottage where they wished him to join them.He was in no haste to do this; and Lady Wallinger proposed that
when they felt inclined to ramble they should all walk down to the
fishing-cottage together.So, seating himself by the side of Edith, who
was tinting a sketch which she had made of a rich oriel of Hellingsley,
the morning passed away in that slight and yet subtle talk in which a
lover delights, and in which, while asking a thousand questions, that
seem at the first glance sufficiently trifling, he is indeed often
conveying a meaning that is not expressed, or attempting to discover a
feeling that is hidden.And these are occasions when glances meet
and glances are withdrawn: the tongue may speak idly, the eye is more
eloquent, and often more true.Coningsby looked up; Lady Wallinger, who had more than once announced
that she was going to put on her bonnet, was gone.Yet still he
continued to talk trifles; and still Edith listened.'Of all that you have told me,' said Edith, 'nothing pleases me so much
as your description of St.How much I should like to catch
the deer at sunset on the heights!'You would like Eustace Lyle,' said Coningsby.'He is so shy and yet so
ardent.'Oswald was saying this morning there
was no one who had so many devoted friends.'It is the only bond of friendship; and
yet friendship--'

'Edith,' said Lady Wallinger, looking into the room from the garden,
with her bonnet on, 'you will find me roaming on the terrace.'There were yet a few pencil touches to be
given to the tinted sketch; Coningsby would cut the pencils.'Would you give me,' he said,'some slight memorial of Hellingsley and
your art?I would not venture to hope for anything half so beautiful as
this; but the slightest sketch.It would make me so happy when away to
have it hanging in my room.'A blush suffused the cheek of Edith; she turned her head a little aside,
as if she were arranging some drawings.And then she said, in a somewhat
hushed and hesitating voice,

'I am sure I will do so; and with pleasure.A view of the Hall itself;
I think that would be the best memorial.and she rose, and promised immediately to
return, left the room.Coningsby leant over the mantel-piece in deep abstraction, gazing
vacantly on a miniature of the father of Edith.A light step roused
him; she had returned.Unconsciously he greeted her with a glance of
ineffable tenderness.They went forth; it was a grey, sultry day.Indeed it was the covered
sky which had led to the fishing scheme of the morning.Sir Joseph was
an expert and accomplished angler, and the Darl was renowned for its
sport.They lingered before they reached the terrace where they were to
find Lady Wallinger, observing the different points of view which
the Hall presented, and debating which was to form the subject of
Coningsby's drawing; for already it was to be not merely a sketch, but a
drawing, the most finished that the bright and effective pencil of Edith
could achieve.If it really were to be placed in his room, and were
to be a memorial of Hellingsley, her artistic reputation demanded a
masterpiece.They reached the terrace: Lady Wallinger was not there, nor could they
observe her in the vicinity.Coningsby was quite certain that she had
gone onward to the fishing-cottage, and expected them to follow her;
and he convinced Edith of the justness of his opinion.To the
fishing-cottage, therefore, they bent their steps.They emerged from the
gardens into the park, sauntering over the table-land, and seeking as
much as possible the shade, in the soft but oppressive atmosphere.At
the limit of the table-land their course lay by a wild but winding path
through a gradual and wooded declivity.While they were yet in this
craggy and romantic woodland, the big fervent drops began to fall.Coningsby urged Edith to seek at once a natural shelter; but she, who
knew the country, assured him that the fishing-cottage was close by, and
that they might reach it before the rain could do them any harm.And truly, at this moment emerging from the wood, they found themselves
in the valley of the Darl.The river here was narrow and winding, but
full of life; rushing, and clear but for the dark sky it reflected; with
high banks of turf and tall trees; the silver birch, above all others,
in clustering groups; infinitely picturesque.At the turn of the river,
about two hundred yards distant, Coningsby observed the low, dark roof
of the fishing-cottage on its banks.They descended from the woods to
the margin of the stream by a flight of turfen steps, Coningsby holding
Edith's hand as he guided her progress.They reached, at a rapid pace, the cottage.The absent boat indicated that Sir Joseph and Oswald were on the river.The cottage was an old building of rustic logs, with a shelving roof,
so that you might obtain sufficient shelter without entering its walls.Coningsby found a rough garden seat for Edith.Nature, like man, sometimes weeps from gladness.It is the joy and
tenderness of her heart that seek relief; and these are summer showers.In this instance the vehemence of her emotion was transient, though the
tears kept stealing down her cheek for a long time, and gentle sighs and
sobs might for some period be distinguished.The oppressive atmosphere
had evaporated; the grey, sullen tint had disappeared; a soft breeze
came dancing up the stream; a glowing light fell upon the woods and
waters; the perfume of trees and flowers and herbs floated around.There
was a carolling of birds; a hum of happy insects in the air; freshness
and stir, and a sense of joyous life, pervaded all things; it seemed
that the heart of all creation opened.Coningsby, after repeatedly watching the shower with Edith, and
speculating on its progress, which did not much annoy them, had seated
himself on a log almost at her feet.And assuredly a maiden and a youth
more beautiful and engaging had seldom met before in a scene more fresh
and fair.Edith on her rustic seat watched the now blue and foaming
river, and the birch-trees with a livelier tint, and quivering in the
sunset air; an expression of tranquil bliss suffused her beautiful brow,
and spoke from the thrilling tenderness of her soft dark eye.Coningsby
gazed on that countenance with a glance of entranced rapture.His cheek
was flushed, his eye gleamed with dazzling lustre.She turned her head;
she met that glance, and, troubled, she withdrew her own.he said in a tone of tremulous passion, 'Let me call you Edith!Yes,' he continued, gently taking her hand, let me call you my Edith!She did not withdraw her hand; but turned away a face flushed as the
impending twilight.It was past the dinner hour when Edith and Coningsby reached the Hall;
an embarrassing circumstance, but mitigated by the conviction that they
had not to encounter a very critical inspection.What, then, were their
feelings when the first servant that they met informed them that Mr.Edith never could have believed that the return of
her beloved father to his home could ever have been to her other than
a cause of delight.And yet now she trembled when she heard the
announcement.The mysteries of love were fast involving her existence.Her heart was still agitated
by the tremulous admission that she responded to that fervent and
adoring love whose eloquent music still sounded in her ear, and the
pictures of whose fanciful devotion flitted over her agitated vision.Unconsciously she pressed the arm of Coningsby as the servant spoke,
and then, without looking into his face, whispering him to be quick, she
sprang away.As for Coningsby, notwithstanding the elation of his heart, and the
ethereal joy which flowed in all his veins, the name of Mr.Millbank
sounded, something like a knell.However, this was not the time to
reflect.He obeyed the hint of Edith; made the most rapid toilet that
ever was consummated by a happy lover, and in a few minutes entered the
drawing-room of Hellingsley, to encounter the gentleman whom he hoped by
some means or other, quite inconceivable, might some day be transformed
into his father-in-law, and the fulfilment of his consequent duties
towards whom he had commenced by keeping him waiting for dinner.'How do you do, sir,' said Mr.Millbank, extending his hand to
Coningsby.'You seem to have taken a long walk.'Coningsby looked round to the kind Lady Wallinger, and half addressed
his murmured answer to her, explaining how they had lost her, and their
way, and were caught in a storm or a shower, which, as it terminated
about three hours back, and the fishing-cottage was little more than a
mile from the Hall, very satisfactorily accounted for their not being in
time for dinner.Lady Wallinger then said something about the lowering clouds having
frightened her from the terrace, and Sir Joseph and Oswald talked a
little of their sport, and of their having seen an otter; but there was,
or at least there seemed to Coningsby, a tone of general embarrassment
which distressed him.The fact is, keeping people from dinner under
any circumstances is distressing.They are obliged to talk at the very
moment when they wish to use their powers of expression for a very
different purpose.They are faint, and conversation makes them more
exhausted.A gentleman, too, fond of his family, who in turn are devoted
to him, making a great and inconvenient effort to reach them by dinner
time, to please and surprise them; and finding them all dispersed,
dinner so late that he might have reached home in good time without any
great inconvenient effort; his daughter, whom he had wished a thousand
times to embrace, taking a singularly long ramble with no other
companion than a young gentleman, whom he did not exactly expect to
see; all these are circumstances, individually perhaps slight, and yet,
encountered collectively, it may be doubted they would not a little
ruffle even the sweetest temper.Millbank, too, had not the sweetest temper, though not a bad one;
a little quick and fiery.And when Edith,
who had providentially sent down a message to order dinner, entered and
embraced him at the very moment that dinner was announced, her father
forgot everything in his joy in seeing her, and his pleasure in being
surrounded by his friends.He gave his hand to Lady Wallinger, and Sir
Joseph led away his niece.Coningsby put his arm around the astonished
neck of Oswald, as if they were once more in the playing fields of Eton.my dear fellow,' he exclaimed, 'I am so sorry we kept your
father from dinner.'As Edith headed her father's table, according to his rigid rule,
Coningsby was on one side of her.They never spoke so little; Coningsby
would have never unclosed his lips, had he followed his humour.He was
in a stupor of happiness; the dining room took the appearance of
the fishing-cottage; and he saw nothing but the flowing river.Lady
Wallinger was however next to him, and that was a relief; for he felt
always she was his friend.Sir Joseph, a good-hearted man, and
on subjects with which he was acquainted full of sound sense, was
invaluable to-day, for he entirely kept up the conversation, speaking
of things which greatly interested Mr.And so their host soon
recovered his good temper; he addressed several times his observations
to Coningsby, and was careful to take wine with him.On the whole,
affairs went on flowingly enough.The gentlemen, indeed, stayed much
longer over their wine than on the preceding days, and Coningsby did not
venture on the liberty of quitting the room before his host.She tried to seek it on the bosom of her
aunt, as she breathed to her the delicious secret of her life.When the
gentlemen returned to the drawing-room the ladies were not there.Millbank again; he had not seen enough of his
daughter; he wished to hear her sing.But Edith managed to reappear; and
even to sing.Then Coningsby went up to her and asked her to sing the
song of the Girls of Granada.She said in a low voice, and with a fond
yet serious look,

'I am not in the mood for such a song, but if you wish me--'

She sang it, and with inexpressible grace, and with an arch vivacity,
that to a fine observer would have singularly contrasted with the
almost solemn and even troubled expression of her countenance a moment
afterwards.The day was about to die; the day the most important, the most precious
in the lives of Harry Coningsby and Edith Millbank.Words had been
spoken, vows breathed, which were to influence their careers for ever.For them hereafter there was to be but one life, one destiny, one world.Each of them was still in such a state of tremulous excitement, that
neither had found time or occasion to ponder over the mighty result.They both required solitude; they both longed to be alone.He pressed the soft hand of Edith, and his glance spoke
his soul.'We shall see you at breakfast to-morrow, Coningsby!'said Oswald,
very loud, knowing that the presence of his father would make Coningsby
hesitate about coming.Edith's heart fluttered; but she said nothing.It
was with delight she heard her father, after a moment's pause, say,

'Oh!'Not quite at so early an hour,' said Coningsby; 'but if you will permit
me, I hope to have the pleasure of hearing from you to-morrow, sir, that
your journey has not fatigued you.'To be alone; to have no need of feigning a tranquillity he could not
feel; of coining common-place courtesy when his heart was gushing
with rapture; this was a great relief to Coningsby, though gained by a
separation from Edith.The deed was done; he had breathed his long-brooding passion, he
had received the sweet expression of her sympathy, he had gained
the long-coveted heart.Youth, beauty, love, the innocence of
unsophisticated breasts, and the inspiration of an exquisite nature,
combined to fashion the spell that now entranced his life.He turned to
gaze upon the moonlit towers and peaked roofs of Hellingsley.Silent and
dreamlike, the picturesque pile rested on its broad terrace flooded with
the silver light and surrounded by the quaint bowers of its fantastic
gardens tipped with the glittering beam.Half hid in deep shadow, half
sparkling in the midnight blaze, he recognised the oriel window that had
been the subject of the morning's sketch.Almost he wished there should
be some sound to assure him of his reality.But nothing broke the
all-pervading stillness.Was his life to be as bright and as tranquil?Whither was he to bear the beautiful bride he had gained?Were the
portals of Coningsby the proud and hospitable gates that were to greet
her?How long would they greet him after the achievement of the last
four-and-twenty hours was known to their lord?Was this the return for
the confiding kindness of his grandsire?That he should pledge his troth
to the daughter of that grandsire's foe?Away with such dark and scaring visions!Is it not the noon of a summer
night fragrant with the breath of gardens, bright with the beam that
lovers love, and soft with the breath of Ausonian breezes?Within that
sweet and stately residence, dwells there not a maiden fair enough to
revive chivalry; who is even now thinking of him as she leans on her
pensive hand, or, if perchance she dream, recalls him in her visions?And himself, is he one who would cry craven with such a lot?What avail
his golden youth, his high blood, his daring and devising spirit, and
all his stores of wisdom, if they help not now?Does not he feel the
energy divine that can confront Fate and carve out fortunes?Besides it
is nigh Midsummer Eve, and what should fairies reign for but to aid such
a bright pair as this?He recalls a thousand times the scene, the moment, in which but a few
hours past he dared to tell her that he loved; he recalls a thousand
times the still, small voice, that murmured her agitated felicity: more
than a thousand times, for his heart clenched the idea as a diver grasps
a gem, he recalls the enraptured yet gentle embrace, that had sealed
upon her blushing cheek his mystical and delicious sovereignty.CHAPTER VIII


The morning broke lowering and thunderous; small white clouds, dull and
immovable, studded the leaden sky; the waters of the rushing Darl seemed
to have become black and almost stagnant; the terraces of Hellingsley
looked like the hard lines of a model; and the mansion itself had a
harsh and metallic character.Before the chief portal of his Hall, the
elder Millbank, with an air of some anxiety, surveyed the landscape and
the heavens, as if he were speculating on the destiny of the day.Often his eye wandered over the park; often with an uneasy and restless
step he paced the raised walk before him.The clock of Hellingsley
church had given the chimes of noon.His son and Coningsby appeared
at the end of one of the avenues.His eye lightened; his lip became
compressed; he advanced to meet them.'Are you going to fish to-day, Oswald?''We had some thoughts of it, sir.''A fine day for sport, I should think,' he observed, as he turned
towards the Hall with them.Coningsby remarked the fanciful beauty of the portal; its twisted
columns, and Caryatides carved in dark oak.'Yes, it's very well,' said Millbank; 'but I really do not know why I
came here; my presence is an effort.Oswald does not care for the place;
none of us do, I believe.'I like it now, father; and Edith doats on it.''She was very happy at Millbank,' said the father, rather sharply.'We are all of us happy at Millbank,' said Oswald.'I was much struck with the valley and the whole settlement when I first
saw it,' said Coningsby.'Suppose you go and see about the tackle, Oswald,' said Mr.Coningsby and I will take a stroll on the terrace in the
meantime.'The habit of obedience, which was supreme in this family, instantly
carried Oswald away, though he was rather puzzled why his father should
be so anxious about the preparation of the fishing-tackle, as he rarely
used it.Millbank turned to
Coningsby, and said very abruptly,

'You have never seen my own room here, Mr.Coningsby; step in, for I
wish to say a word to you.'And thus speaking, he advanced before the
astonished, and rather agitated Coningsby, and led the way through a
door and long passage to a room of moderate dimensions, partly furnished
as a library, and full of parliamentary papers and blue-books.Shutting
the door with some earnestness and pointing to a chair, he begged his
guest to be seated.Millbank, clearing his
throat, said without preface, 'I have reason to believe, Mr.Coningsby,
that you are attached to my daughter?''I have been attached to her for a long time most ardently,' replied
Coningsby, in a calm and rather measured tone, but looking very pale.'And I have reason to believe that she returns your attachment?''I believe she deigns not to disregard it,' said Coningsby, his white
cheek becoming scarlet.'It is then a mutual attachment, which, if cherished, must produce
mutual unhappiness,' said Mr.'I would fain believe the reverse,' said Coningsby.'Because I believe she possesses every charm, quality, and virtue, that
can bless man; and because, though I can make her no equivalent return,
I have a heart, if I know myself, that would struggle to deserve her.''I know you to be a man of sense; I believe you to be a man of honour,'
replied Mr.'As the first, you must feel that an union between
you and my daughter is impossible; what then should be your duty as a
man of correct principle is obvious.''I could conceive that our union might be attended with difficulties,'
said Coningsby, in a somewhat deprecating tone.'Sir, it is impossible,' repeated Mr.Millbank, interrupting him, though
not with harshness; 'that is to say, there is no conceivable marriage
which could be effected at greater sacrifices, and which would occasion
greater misery.''The sacrifices are more apparent to me than the misery,' said
Coningsby, 'and even they may be imaginary.''The sacrifices and the misery are certain and inseparable,' said Mr.I speak without reserve, for this
is a subject which cannot permit misconception, but with no feelings
towards you, sir, but fair and friendly ones.You are the grandson of
my Lord Monmouth; at present enjoying his favour, but dependent on his
bounty.You may be the heir of his wealth to-morrow, and to-morrow you
may be the object of his hatred and persecution.Your grandfather and
myself are foes; bitter, irreclaimable, to the death.It is idle to
mince phrases; I do not vindicate our mutual feelings, I may regret that
they have ever arisen; I may regret it especially at this exigency.They
are not the feelings of good Christians; they may be altogether to be
deplored and unjustifiable; but they exist, mutually exist; and have not
been confined to words.Lord Monmouth would crush me, had he the power,
like a worm; and I have curbed his proud fortunes often.Were it not
for this feeling I should not be here; I purchased this estate merely
to annoy him, as I have done a thousand other acts merely for his
discomfiture and mortification.In our long encounter I have done him
infinitely more injury than he could do me; I have been on the spot,
I am active, vigilant, the maker of my fortunes.He is an epicurean,
continually in foreign parts, obliged to leave the fulfilment of his
will to others.But, for these very reasons, his hate is more intense.I can afford to hate him less than he hates me; I have injured him more.But they do exist;
and now you are to go to this man, and ask his sanction to marry my
daughter!''But I would appease these hatreds; I would allay these dark passions,
the origin of which I know not, but which never could justify the end,
and which lead to so much misery.I would appeal to my grandfather; I
would show him Edith.''He has looked upon as fair even as Edith,' said Mr.Millbank, rising
suddenly from his seat, and pacing the room, 'and did that melt his
heart?The experience of your own lot should have guarded you from the
perils that you have so rashly meditated encountering, and the misery
which you have been preparing for others besides yourself.Is my
daughter to be treated like your mother?Your
mother's family were not Lord Monmouth's foes.They were simple and
innocent people, free from all the bad passions of our nature, and
ignorant of the world's ways.But because they were not noble, because
they could trace no mystified descent from a foreign invader, or the
sacrilegious minion of some spoliating despot, their daughter was hunted
from the family which should have exulted to receive her, and the land
of which she was the native ornament.Why should a happier lot await you
than fell to your parents?You are in the same position as your father;
you meditate the same act.The only difference being aggravating
circumstances in your case, which, even if I were a member of the same
order as my Lord Monmouth, would prevent the possibility of a prosperous
union.Marry Edith, and you blast all the prospects of your life, and
entail on her a sense of unceasing humiliation.Coningsby, with his head resting on his arm, his face a little shaded,
his eyes fixed on the ground, listened in silence.There was a pause;
broken by Coningsby, as in a low voice, without changing his posture or
raising his glance, he said, 'It seems, sir, that you were acquainted
with my mother!''I knew sufficient of her,' replied Mr.Millbank, with a kindling cheek,
'to learn the misery that a woman may entail on herself by marrying out
of her condition.I have bred my children in a respect for their class.I believe they have imbibed my feeling; though it is strange how in
the commerce of the world, chance, in their friendships, has apparently
baffled my designs.'do not say it is chance, sir,' said Coningsby, looking up, and
speaking with much fervour.'The feelings that animate me towards
your family are not the feelings of chance: they are the creation of
sympathy; tried by time, tested by thought.They were inevitable; they are indestructible.Yes, sir, it
is in vain to speak of the enmities that are fostered between you and
my grandfather; the love that exists between your daughter and myself is
stronger than all your hatreds.''You speak like a young man, and a young man that is in love,' said Mr.'This is mere rhapsody; it will vanish in an instant
before the reality of life.And you have arrived at that reality,' he
continued, speaking with emphasis, leaning over the back of his chair,
and looking steadily at Coningsby with his grey, sagacious eye;'my
daughter and yourself can meet no more.''It is impossible you can be so cruel!''So kind; kind to you both; for I wish to be kind to you as well as to
her.You are entitled to kindness from us all; though I will tell you
now, that, years ago, when the news arrived that my son's life had been
saved, and had been saved by one who bore the name of Coningsby, I had
a presentiment, great as was the blessing, that it might lead to
unhappiness.''I can answer for the misery of one,' said Coningsby, in a tone of great
despondency.'I feel as if my sun were set.why should there be such
wretchedness?Why are there family hatreds and party feuds?Why am I the
most wretched of men?''My good young friend, you will live, I doubt not, to be a happy one.Happiness is not, as we are apt to fancy, entirely dependent on these
contingencies.It is the lot of most men to endure what you are now
suffering, and they can look back to such conjunctures through the vista
of years with calmness.''Frankly, I should say, no.My daughter is in her room; I have had some
conversation with her.To
see her again will only aggravate woe.You leave under this roof, sir,
some sad memories, but no unkind ones.It is not likely that I can
serve you, or that you may want my aid; but whatever may be in my power,
remember you may command it; without reserve and without restraint.If I
control myself now, it is not because I do not respect your affliction,
but because, in the course of my life, I have felt too much not to be
able to command my feelings.''You never could have felt what I feel now,' said Coningsby, in a tone
of anguish.'You touch on delicate ground,' said Millbank; 'yet from me you may
learn to suffer.There was a being once, not less fair than the peerless
girl that you would fain call your own, and her heart was my proud
possession.There were no family feuds to baffle our union, nor was
I dependent on anything, but the energies which had already made me
flourishing.It was the first dream of my life,
and it was the last; my solitary passion, the memory of which softens my
heart.you dreaming scholars, and fine gentlemen who saunter through
life, you think there is no romance in the loves of a man who lives in
the toil and turmoil of business.Amid my career
of travail, there was ever a bright form which animated exertion,
inspired my invention, nerved my energy, and to gain whose heart and
life I first made many of those discoveries, and entered into many
of those speculations, that have since been the foundation of my wide
prosperity.'Her faith was pledged to me; I lived upon her image; the day was even
talked of when I should bear her to the home that I had proudly prepared
for her.'There came a young noble, a warrior who had never seen war, glittering
with gewgaws.He was quartered in the town where the mistress of my
heart, who was soon to share my life and my fortunes, resided.The tale
is too bitter not to be brief.He saw her, he sighed; I will hope that
he loved her; she gave him with rapture the heart which perhaps she
found she had never given to me; and instead of bearing the name I had
once hoped to have called her by, she pledged her faith at the altar to
one who, like you, was called, CONINGSBY.''You see, I too have had my griefs.''Dear sir,' said Coningsby, rising and taking Mr.Millbank's hand, 'I am
most wretched; and yet I wish to part from you even with affection.You
have explained circumstances that have long perplexed me.A curse, I
fear, is on our families.I have not mind enough at this moment even
to ponder on my situation.I go; yes, I quit this
Hellingsley, where I came to be so happy, where I have been so happy.Nay, let me go, dear sir!I must be alone, I must try to think.And tell
her, no, tell her nothing.Proceeding down the avenue with a rapid and distempered step, his
countenance lost, as it were, in a wild abstraction, Coningsby
encountered Oswald Millbank.He stopped, collected his turbulent
thoughts, and throwing on Oswald one look that seemed at the same time
to communicate woe and to demand sympathy, flung himself into his arms.he exclaimed, and then added, in a broken voice, 'I need a
friend.'Then in a hurried, impassioned, and somewhat incoherent strain, leaning
on Oswald's arm, as they walked on together, he poured forth all that
had occurred, all of which he had dreamed; his baffled bliss, his
actual despair.there was little room for solace, and yet all
that earnest affection could inspire, and a sagacious brain and a brave
spirit, were offered for his support, if not his consolation, by the
friend who was devoted to him.In the midst of this deep communion, teeming with every thought and
sentiment that could enchain and absorb the spirit of man, they came to
one of the park-gates of Coningsby.The command of
his father was peremptory, that no member of his family, under any
circumstances, or for any consideration, should set his foot on that
domain.Lady Wallinger had once wished to have seen the Castle, and
Coningsby was only too happy in the prospect of escorting her and Edith
over the place; but Oswald had then at once put his veto on the project,
as a thing forbidden; and which, if put in practice, his father would
never pardon.So it passed off, and now Oswald himself was at the gates
of that very domain with his friend who was about to enter them, his
friend whom he might never see again; that Coningsby who, from their
boyish days, had been the idol of his life; whom he had lived to see
appeal to his affections and his sympathy, and whom Oswald was now going
to desert in the midst of his lonely and unsolaced woe.'I ought not to enter here,' said Oswald, holding the hand of Coningsby
as he hesitated to advance; 'and yet there are duties more sacred even
than obedience to a father.I cannot leave you thus, friend of my best
heart!'The morning passed away in unceasing yet fruitless speculation on the
future.One moment something was to happen, the next nothing could
occur.Sometimes a beam of hope flashed over the fancy of Coningsby,
and jumping up from the turf, on which they were reclining, he seemed
to exult in his renovated energies; and then this sanguine paroxysm was
succeeded by a fit of depression so dark and dejected that nothing but
the presence of Oswald seemed to prevent Coningsby from flinging himself
into the waters of the Darl.The day was fast declining, and the inevitable moment of separation was
at hand.Oswald wished to appear at the dinner-table of Hellingsley,
that no suspicion might arise in the mind of his father of his having
accompanied Coningsby home.But just as he was beginning to mention the
necessity of his departure, a flash of lightning seemed to transfix the
heavens.The sky was very dark; though studded here and there with dingy
spots.The young men sprang up at the same time.'We had better get out of these trees,' said Oswald.'We had better get to the Castle,' said Coningsby.A clap of thunder that seemed to make the park quake broke over their
heads, followed by some thick drops.The Castle was close at hand;
Oswald had avoided entering it; but the impending storm was so menacing
that, hurried on by Coningsby, he could make no resistance; and, in a
few minutes, the companions were watching the tempest from the windows
of a room in Coningsby Castle.The fork-lightning flashed and scintillated from every quarter of the
horizon: the thunder broke over the Castle, as if the keep were rocking
with artillery: amid the momentary pauses of the explosion, the rain was
heard descending like dissolving water-spouts.Nor was this one of those transient tempests that often agitate
the summer.Time advanced, and its fierceness was little mitigated.Sometimes there was a lull, though the violence of the rain never
appeared to diminish; but then, as in some pitched fight between
contending hosts, when the fervour of the field seems for a moment to
allay, fresh squadrons arrive and renew the hottest strife, so a low
moaning wind that was now at intervals faintly heard bore up a great
reserve of electric vapour, that formed, as it were, into field in
the space between the Castle and Hellingsley, and then discharged its
violence on that fated district.'You must not think of going home
at present, my dear fellow,' said the first.'I am sure your father
would not be displeased.There is not a being here who even knows you,
and if they did, what then?'The servant entered the room, and inquired whether the gentlemen were
ready for dinner.'By all means; come, my dear Millbank, I feel reckless as the tempest;
let us drown our cares in wine!'Coningsby, in fact, was exhausted by all the agitation of the day, and
all the harassing spectres of the future.He found wine a momentary
solace.He ordered the servants away, and for a moment felt a degree of
wild satisfaction in the company of the brother of Edith.Thus they sat for a long time, talking only of one subject, and
repeating almost the same things, yet both felt happier in being
together.Oswald had risen, and opening the window, examined the
approaching night.The storm had lulled, though the rain still fell; in
the west was a streak of light.In a quarter of an hour, he calculated
on departing.As he was watching the wind he thought he heard the sound
of wheels, which reminded him of Coningsby's promise to lend him a light
carriage for his return.They sat down once more; they had filled their glasses for the last
time; to pledge to their faithful friendship, and the happiness of
Coningsby and Edith; when the door of the room opened, and there
appeared, MR.CHAPTER I.


It was the heart of the London season, nearly four years ago, twelve
months having almost elapsed since the occurrence of those painful
passages at Hellingsley which closed the last book of this history, and
long lines of carriages an hour before midnight, up the classic mount of
St.James and along Piccadilly, intimated that the world were received
at some grand entertainment in Arlington Street.It was the town mansion of the noble family beneath whose roof at
Beaumanoir we have more than once introduced the reader, to gain whose
courtyard was at this moment the object of emulous coachmen, and to
enter whose saloons was to reward the martyr-like patience of their
lords and ladies.Among the fortunate who had already succeeded in bowing to their hostess
were two gentlemen, who, ensconced in a good position, surveyed the
scene, and made their observations on the passing guests.They
were gentlemen who, to judge from their general air and the great
consideration with which they were treated by those who were
occasionally in their vicinity, were personages whose criticism bore
authority.'I say, Jemmy,' said the eldest, a dandy who had dined with the Regent,
but who was still a dandy, and who enjoyed life almost as much as in the
days when Carlton House occupied the terrace which still bears its name.'I say, Jemmy, what a load of young fellows there are!Begin to think fellows are younger than they used to be.At this moment an individual who came under the fortunate designation
of a young fellow, but whose assured carriage hardly intimated that
this was his first season in London, came up to the junior of the two
critics, and said, 'A pretty turn you played us yesterday at White's,
Melton.'My dear fellow, I am infinitely sorry; but I was obliged to go down to
Windsor, and I missed the return train.'A capital party, only you were wanted.We had Beaumanoir and Vere, and
Jack Tufton and Spraggs.'He told us a story about the
little Biron who was over here last year; I knew her at Paris; and an
Indian screen.Melton's companion, as the young man
moved away.A young fellow now of two or three and twenty
knows the world as men used to do after as many years of scrapes.I
wonder where there is such a thing as a greenhorn.Effie Crabbs says
the reason he gives up his house is, that he has cleaned out the old
generation, and that the new generation would clean him.''Buckhurst is not in that sort of way: he swears by Henry Sydney, a
younger son of the Duke, whom you don't know; and young Coningsby; a
sort of new set; new ideas and all that sort of thing.Beau tells me
a good deal about it; and when I was staying with the Everinghams,
at Easter, they were full of it.Coningsby had just returned from his
travels, and they were quite on the _qui vive_.Lady Everingham is one
of their set.I don't know what it is exactly; but I think we shall hear
more of it.''A sort of animal magnetism, or unknown tongues, I take it from your
description,' said his companion.'Well, I don't know what it is,' said Mr.Melton; 'but it has got hold
of all the young fellows who have just come out.Beau is a little bit
himself.I had some idea of giving my mind to it, they made such a fuss
about it at Everingham; but it requires a devilish deal of history, I
believe, and all that sort of thing.''It is difficult to turn to
with a new thing when you are not in the habit of it.'They told me you had the gout,
Cassilis?''So I had; but I have found out a fellow who cures the gout instanter.Pumicestone pills; sort
of a charm, I believe, and all that kind of thing: they say it rubs the
gout out of you.I sent him to Luxborough, who was very bad; cured him
directly.'Luxborough believes in the Millennium,' said Mr.'But here's a new thing that Melton has been telling me of, that all the
world is going to believe in,' said Mr.Cassilis,'something patronised
by Lady Everingham.''A very good patroness,' said Mr.'Young
Coningsby brought it from abroad; didn't you you say so, Jemmy?''No, no, my dear fellow; it is not at all that sort of thing.''But they say it requires a deuced deal of history,' continued Mr.'One must brush up one's Goldsmith.Canterton used to be the
fellow for history at White's.He was always boring one with William the
Conqueror, Julius Caesar, and all that sort of thing.'Ormsby, looking both sly and solemn, 'I
should not be surprised if, some day or another, we have a history about
Lady Everingham and young Coningsby.'Melton; 'he is engaged to be married to her sister, Lady
Theresa.'Ormsby; 'well, you are a friend of the family, and
I suppose you know.''He is a devilish good-looking fellow, that young Coningsby,' said Mr.'All the women are in love with him, they say.Lady Eleanor
Ducie quite raves about him.''By-the-bye, his grandfather has been very unwell,' said Mr.'I saw Lady Monmouth here just now,' said Mr.'Got an odd story at White's that Lord Monmouth was going to separate
from her,' said Mr.'They are not going to separate, I believe,' said Mr.Melton; 'but I
rather think there was a foundation for the rumour.'Melton, 'all I know is, that it was looked upon
last winter at Paris as a settled thing.''There was some story about some Hungarian,' said Mr.'No, that blew over,' said Mr.Melton; 'it was Trautsmansdorff the row
was about.'Ormsby, as the friend of Lord and Lady Monmouth,
remained shaking his head; but as a member of society, and therefore
delighting in small scandal, appropriating the gossip with the greatest
avidity.'I should think old Monmouth was not the sort of fellow to blow up a
woman,' said Mr.'Provided she would leave him quietly,' said Mr.'Yes, Lord Monmouth never could live with a woman more than two years,'
said Mr.'And that I thought at the time rather an
objection to his marriage.'We must now briefly revert to what befell our hero after those unhappy
occurrences in the midst of whose first woe we left him.Rigby at the Castle, Coningsby quitted
it for London, and before a week had elapsed had embarked for Cadiz.He
felt a romantic interest in visiting the land to which Edith owed some
blood, and in acquiring the language which he had often admired as she
spoke it.A favourable opportunity permitted him in the autumn to visit
Athens and the AEgean, which he much desired.In the pensive beauties
of that delicate land, where perpetual autumn seems to reign, Coningsby
found solace.There is something in the character of Grecian scenery
which blends with the humour of the melancholy and the feelings of
the sorrowful.The wish of his
grandfather had rendered it necessary for him to return to England
somewhat abruptly.Lord Monmouth had not visited his native country
since his marriage; but the period that had elapsed since that event had
considerably improved the prospects of his party.The majority of the
Whig Cabinet in the House of Commons by 1840 had become little more than
nominal; and though it was circulated among their friends, as if from
the highest authority, that 'one was enough,' there seemed daily a
better chance of their being deprived even of that magical unit.For the
first time in the history of this country since the introduction of the
system of parliamentary sovereignty, the Government of England depended
on the fate of single elections; and indeed, by a single vote, it is
remarkable to observe, the fate of the Whig Government was ultimately
decided.This critical state of affairs, duly reported to Lord Monmouth, revived
his political passions, and offered him that excitement which he was
ever seeking, and yet for which he had often sighed.The Marquess, too,
was weary of Paris.Every day he found it more difficult to be amused.He, from whom nothing could be concealed,
perceived that often, while she elaborately attempted to divert him, her
mind was wandering elsewhere.Lord Monmouth was quite superior to all
petty jealousy and the vulgar feelings of inferior mortals, but his
sublime selfishness required devotion.He had calculated that a wife
or a mistress who might be in love with another man, however powerfully
their interests might prompt them, could not be so agreeable or amusing
to their friends and husbands as if they had no such distracting hold
upon their hearts or their fancy.Latterly at Paris, while Lucretia
became each day more involved in the vortex of society, where all
admired and some adored her, Lord Monmouth fell into the easy habit of
dining in his private rooms, sometimes tete-a-tete with Villebecque,
whose inexhaustible tales and adventures about a kind of society which
Lord Monmouth had always preferred infinitely to the polished and
somewhat insipid circles in which he was born, had rendered him the
prime favourite of his great patron.Sometimes Villebecque, too, brought
a friend, male or otherwise, whom he thought invested with the rare
faculty of distraction: Lord Monmouth cared not who or what they were,
provided they were diverting.Villebecque had written to Coningsby at Rome, by his grandfather's
desire, to beg him to return to England and meet Lord Monmouth there.The letter was couched with all the respect and good feeling which
Villebecque really entertained for him whom he addressed; still a letter
on such a subject from such a person was not agreeable to Coningsby, and
his reply to it was direct to his grandfather; Lord Monmouth, however,
had entirely given over writing letters.Coningsby had met at Paris, on his way to England, Lord and Lady
Everingham, and he had returned with them.This revival of an old
acquaintance was both agreeable and fortunate for our hero.The vivacity
of a clever and charming woman pleasantly disturbed the brooding memory
of Coningsby.There is no mortification however keen, no misery however
desperate, which the spirit of woman cannot in some degree lighten or
alleviate.About, too, to make his formal entrance into the great
world, he could not have secured a more valuable and accomplished
female friend.She gave him every instruction, every intimation that
was necessary; cleared the social difficulties which in some degree are
experienced on their entrance into the world even by the most highly
connected, unless they have this benign assistance; planted him
immediately in the position which was expedient; took care that he was
invited at once to the right houses; and, with the aid of her husband,
that he should become a member of the right clubs.'And who is to have the blue ribbon, Lord Eskdale?'said the Duchess to
that nobleman, as he entered and approached to pay his respects.'If I were Melbourne, I would keep it open,' replied his Lordship.'It
is a mistake to give away too quickly.''But suppose they go out,' said her Grace.there is always a last day to clear the House.The cliff will not be sapped before then.We made a
mistake last year about the ladies.''Quarrels about women are always a mistake.One should make it a rule to
give up to them, and then they are sure to give up to us.''You have no great faith in our firmness?''Male firmness is very often obstinacy: women have always something
better, worth all qualities; they have tact.''A compliment to the sex from so finished a critic as Lord Eskdale is
appreciated.'But at this moment the arrival of some guests terminated the
conversation, and Lord Eskdale moved away, and approached a group which
Lady Everingham was enlightening.'My dear Lord Fitz-booby,' her Ladyship observed, 'in politics we
require faith as well as in all other things.'Lord Fitz-booby looked rather perplexed; but, possessed of considerable
official experience, having held high posts, some in the cabinet, for
nearly a quarter of a century, he was too versed to acknowledge that he
had not understood a single word that had been addressed to him for the
last ten minutes.He looked on with the same grave, attentive stolidity,
occasionally nodding his head, as he was wont of yore when he received
a deputation on sugar duties or joint-stock banks, and when he made,
as was his custom when particularly perplexed, an occasional note on a
sheet of foolscap paper.'An Opposition in an age of revolution,' continued Lady Everingham,
'must be founded on principles.It cannot depend on mere personal
ability and party address taking advantage of circumstances.You have
not enunciated a principle for the last ten years; and when you seemed
on the point of acceding to power, it was not on a great question of
national interest, but a technical dispute respecting the constitution
of an exhausted sugar colony.''If you are a Conservative party, we wish to know what you want to
conserve,' said Lord Vere.'If it had not been for the Whig abolition of slavery,' said Lord
Fitz-booby, goaded into repartee, 'Jamaica would not have been an
exhausted sugar colony.''Then what you do want to conserve is slavery?''No,' said Lord Fitz-booby, 'I am never for retracing our steps.''But will you advance, will you move?And where will you advance, and
how will you move?''I think we have had quite enough of advancing,' said his Lordship.'I
had no idea your Ladyship was a member of the Movement party,' he added,
with a sarcastic grin.'But if it were bad, Lord Fitz-booby, to move where we are, as you
and your friends have always maintained, how can you reconcile it to
principle to remain there?''I would make the best of a bad bargain,' said Lord Fitz-booby.'With
a Conservative government, a reformed Constitution would be less
dangerous.''What are your distinctive principles that
render the peril less?''I appeal to Lord Eskdale,' said Lord Fitz-booby; 'there is Lady
Everingham turned quite a Radical, I declare.Is not your Lordship of
opinion that the country must be safer with a Conservative government
than with a Liberal?''I think the country is always tolerably secure,' said Lord Eskdale.Lady Theresa, leaning on the arm of Mr.Lyle, came up at this moment,
and unconsciously made a diversion in favour of Lord Fitz-booby.'Pray, Theresa,' said Lady Everingham, 'where is Mr.It so happened that on this day Coningsby
and Henry Sydney dined at Grillion's, at an university club, where,
among many friends whom Coningsby had not met for a long time, and among
delightful reminiscences, the unconscious hours stole on.It was late
when they quitted Grillion's, and Coningsby's brougham was detained for
a considerable time before its driver could insinuate himself into the
line, which indeed he would never have succeeded in doing had not he
fortunately come across the coachman of the Duke of Agincourt, who being
of the same politics as himself, belonging to the same club, and always
black-balling the same men, let him in from a legitimate party feeling;
so they arrived in Arlington Street at a very late hour.Coningsby was springing up the staircase, now not so crowded as it had
been, and met a retiring party; he was about to say a passing word to a
gentleman as he went by, when, suddenly, Coningsby turned deadly pale.The gentleman could hardly be the cause, for it was the gracious and
handsome presence of Lord Beaumanoir: the lady resting on his arm was
Edith.They moved on while he was motionless; yet Edith and himself
had exchanged glances.His was one of astonishment; but what was the
expression of hers?She must have recognised him before he had observed
her.She was collected, and she expressed the purpose of her mind in
a distant and haughty recognition.Coningsby remained for a moment
stupefied; then suddenly turning back, he bounded downstairs and hurried
into the cloak-room.He met Lady Wallinger; he spoke rapidly, he held
her hand, did not listen to her answers, his eyes wandered about.There
were many persons present, at length he recognised Edith enveloped in
her mantle.He went forward, he looked at her, as if he would have read
her soul; he said something.She changed colour as he addressed her,
but seemed instantly by an effort to rally and regain her equanimity;
replied to his inquiries with extreme brevity, and Lady Wallinger's
carriage being announced, moved away with the same slight haughty salute
as before, on the arm of Lord Beaumanoir.Sadness fell over the once happy family of Millbank after the departure
of Coningsby from Hellingsley.When the first pang was over, Edith
had found some solace in the sympathy of her aunt, who had always
appreciated and admired Coningsby; but it was a sympathy which aspired
only to soften sorrow, and not to create hope.But Lady Wallinger,
though she lengthened her visit for the sake of her niece, in time
quitted them; and then the name of Coningsby was never heard by Edith.Her brother, shortly after the sorrowful and abrupt departure of his
friend, had gone to the factories, where he remained, and of which, in
future, it was intended that he should assume the principal direction.Millbank himself, sustained at first by the society of his friend
Sir Joseph, to whom he was attached, and occupied with daily reports
from his establishment and the transaction of the affairs with his
numerous and busy constituents, was for a while scarcely conscious of
the alteration which had taken place in the demeanour of his daughter.But when they were once more alone together, it was impossible any
longer to be blind to the great change.That happy and equable gaiety of
spirit, which seemed to spring from an innocent enjoyment of existence,
and which had ever distinguished Edith, was wanting.She was not indeed always moody and dispirited, but she was
fitful, unequal in her tone.That temper whose sweetness had been a
domestic proverb had become a little uncertain.Not that her affection
for her father was diminished, but there were snatches of unusual
irritability which momentarily escaped her, followed by bursts of
tenderness that were the creatures of compunction.And often, after some
hasty word, she would throw her arms round her father's neck with the
fondness of remorse.She pursued her usual avocations, for she had
really too well-regulated a mind, she was in truth a person of
too strong an intellect, to neglect any source of occupation and
distraction.Her flowers, her pencil, and her books supplied her with
these; and music soothed, and at times beguiled, her agitated thoughts.But there was no joy in the house, and in time Mr.Millbank was vexed, irritated, grieved.Edith, his Edith, the pride
and delight of his existence, who had been to him only a source of
exultation and felicity, was no longer happy, was perhaps pining away;
and there was the appearance, the unjust appearance that he, her fond
father, was the cause and occasion of all this wretchedness.It would
appear that the name of Coningsby, to which he now owed a great debt of
gratitude, was still doomed to bear him mortification and misery.Truly
had the young man said that there was a curse upon their two families.And yet, on reflection, it still seemed to Mr.Millbank that he had
acted with as much wisdom and real kindness as decision.The union was impossible; the speedier their
separation, therefore, clearly the better.Unfortunate, indeed, had been
his absence from Hellingsley; unquestionably his presence might have
prevented the catastrophe.Millbank could not shut his eyes to the devotion of his son to
Coningsby.He felt he could count on no assistance in this respect from
that quarter.Yet how hard upon him that he should seem to figure as
a despot or a tyrant to his own children, whom he loved, when he had
absolutely acted in an inevitable manner!Edith seemed sad, Oswald
sullen; all was changed.All the objects for which this clear-headed,
strong-minded, kind-hearted man had been working all his life, seemed
to be frustrated.Because a young man had made love to his
daughter, who was really in no manner entitled to do so.Millbank found Hellingsley, under existing
circumstances, extremely wearisome; and he proposed to his daughter that
they should pay a visit to their earlier home.Edith assented without
difficulty, but without interest.Millbank immediately
perceived, the change was a judicious one; for certainly the spirits
of Edith seemed to improve after her return to their valley.There were
more objects of interest: change, too, is always beneficial.Millbank had been aware that Oswald had received a letter from
Coningsby, written before he quitted Spain, perhaps he might have
recognised a more satisfactory reason for the transient liveliness of
his daughter which had so greatly gratified him.About a month after Christmas, the meeting of Parliament summoned Mr.Millbank up to London; and he had wished Edith to accompany him.But
London in February to Edith, without friends or connections, her father
always occupied and absent from her day and night, seemed to them
all, on reflection, to be a life not very conducive to health or
cheerfulness, and therefore she remained with her brother.Oswald had
heard from Coningsby again from Rome; but at the period he wrote he did
not anticipate his return to England.His tone was affectionate, but
dispirited.Lady Wallinger went up to London after Easter for the season, and Mr.Millbank, now that there was a constant companion for his daughter, took
a house and carried Edith back with him to London.Lady Wallinger,
who had great wealth and great tact, had obtained by degrees a
not inconsiderable position in society.She had a fine house in a
fashionable situation, and gave profuse entertainments.The Whigs
were under obligations to her husband, and the great Whig ladies were
gratified to find in his wife a polished and pleasing person, to whom
they could be courteous without any annoyance.So that Edith, under the
auspices of her aunt, found herself at once in circles which otherwise
she might not easily have entered, but which her beauty, grace, and
experience of the most refined society of the Continent, qualified
her to shine in.One evening they met the Marquis of Beaumanoir, their
friend of Rome and Paris, and admirer of Edith, who from that time was
seldom from their side.His mother, the Duchess, immediately called both
on the Millbanks and the Wallingers; glad, not only to please her son,
but to express that consideration for Mr.Millbank which the Duke always
wished to show.It was, however, of no use; nothing would induce Mr.Millbank ever to enter what he called aristocratic society.He liked the
House of Commons; never paired off; never missed a moment of it; worked
at committees all the morning, listened attentively to debates all the
night; always dined at Bellamy's when there was a house; and when there
was not, liked dining at the Fishmongers' Company, the Russia Company,
great Emigration banquets, and other joint-stock festivities.That was
his idea of rational society; business and pleasure combined; a good
dinner, and good speeches afterwards.Edith was aware that Coningsby had returned to England, for her brother
had heard from him on his arrival; but Oswald had not heard since.A season in London only represented in the mind of Edith the chance,
perhaps the certainty, of meeting Coningsby again; of communing together
over the catastrophe of last summer; of soothing and solacing each
other's unhappiness, and perhaps, with the sanguine imagination of
youth, foreseeing a more felicitous future.She had been nearly a
fortnight in town, and though moving frequently in the same circles as
Coningsby, they had not yet met.It was one of those results which
could rarely occur; but even chance enters too frequently in the
league against lovers.The invitation to the assembly at ---- House was
therefore peculiarly gratifying to Edith, since she could scarcely
doubt that if Coningsby were in town, which her casual inquiries of Lord
Beaumanoir induced her to believe was the case, he would be present.Never, therefore, had she repaired to an assembly with such a flattering
spirit; and yet there was a fascinating anxiety about it that bewilders
the young heart.In vain Edith surveyed the rooms to catch the form of that being, whom
for a moment she had never ceased to cherish and muse over.He was not
there; and at the very moment when, disappointed and mortified, she most
required solace, she learned from Mr.Melton that Lady Theresa Sydney,
whom she chanced to admire, was going to be married, and to Mr.His silence, perhaps his shunning of her were no
longer inexplicable.What a return for all her romantic devotion in her
sad solitude at Hellingsley.Was this the end of their twilight rambles,
and the sweet pathos of their mutual loves?There seemed to be no truth
in man, no joy in life!All the feelings that she had so generously
lavished, all returned upon herself.She could have burst into a passion
of tears and buried herself in a cloister.Instead of that, civilisation made her listen with a serene though
tortured countenance; but as soon as it was in her power, pleading a
headache to Lady Wallinger, she effected, or thought she had effected,
her escape from a scene which harrowed her heart.As for Coningsby, he passed a sleepless night, agitated by the
unexpected presence of Edith and distracted by the manner in which
she had received him.To say that her appearance had revived all his
passionate affection for her would convey an unjust impression of the
nature of his feelings.His affection had never for a moment swerved; it
was profound and firm.But unquestionably this sudden vision had brought
before him, in startling and more vivid colours, the relations that
subsisted between them.There was the being whom he loved and who loved
him; and whatever were the barriers which the circumstances of life
placed against their union, they were partakers of the solemn sacrament
of an unpolluted heart.Coningsby, as we have mentioned, had signified to Oswald his return to
England: he had hitherto omitted to write again; not because his spirit
faltered, but he was wearied of whispering hope without foundation, and
mourning over his chagrined fortunes.Once more in England, once more
placed in communication with his grandfather, he felt with increased
conviction the difficulties which surrounded him.The society of Lady
Everingham and her sister, who had been at the same time her visitor,
had been a relaxation, and a beneficial one, to a mind suffering
too much from the tension of one idea.But Coningsby had treated the
matrimonial project of his gay-minded hostess with the courteous levity
in which he believed it had first half originated.He admired and liked
Lady Theresa; but there was a reason why he should not marry her, even
had his own heart not been absorbed by one of those passions from which
men of deep and earnest character never emancipate themselves.After musing and meditating again and again over everything that had
occurred, Coningsby fell asleep when the morning had far advanced,
resolved to rise when a little refreshed and find out Lady Wallinger,
who, he felt sure, would receive him with kindness.Yet it was fated that this step should not be taken, for while he was
at breakfast, his servant brought him a letter from Monmouth House,
apprising him that his grandfather wished to see him as soon as possible
on urgent business.Lord Monmouth was sitting in the same dressing-room in which he was
first introduced to the reader; on the table were several packets of
papers that were open and in course of reference; and he dictated his
observations to Monsieur Villebecque, who was writing at his left hand.Thus were they occupied when Coningsby was ushered into the room.'You see, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, 'that I am much occupied to-day,
yet the business on which I wish to communicate with you is so pressing
that it could not be postponed.'He made a sign to Villebecque, and his
secretary instantly retired.'I was right in pressing your return to England,' continued Lord
Monmouth to his grandson, who was a little anxious as to the impending
communication, which he could not in any way anticipate.'These are not
times when young men should be out of sight.You may be astonished, but
it is a fact.They are going to dissolve their own House of Commons.Notwithstanding this and the Queen's name, we can beat them; but the
race requires the finest jockeying.Tadpole has
been here to me about Darlford; he came specially with a message, I may
say an appeal, from one to whom I can refuse nothing; the Government
count on the seat, though with the new Registration 'tis nearly a tie.If we had a good candidate we could win.He is too
much of the old clique; used up; a hack; besides, a beaten horse.We are
assured the name of Coningsby would be a host; there is a considerable
section who support the present fellow who will not vote against a
Coningsby.They have thought of you as a fit person, and I have approved
of the suggestion.You will, therefore, be the candidate for Darlford
with my entire sanction and support, and I have no doubt you will be
successful.You may be sure I shall spare nothing: and it will be very
gratifying to me, after being robbed of all our boroughs, that the only
Coningsby who cares to enter Parliament, should nevertheless be able to
do so as early as I could fairly desire.'Millbank on the hustings of Darlford!The fierce passions,
the gross insults, the hot blood and the cool lies, the ruffianism and
the ribaldry, perhaps the domestic discomfiture and mortification, which
he was about to be the means of bringing on the roof he loved best
in the world, occurred to him with anguish.The countenance of
Edith, haughty and mournful last night, rose to him again.He saw her
canvassing for her father, and against him.And for what was
he to make this terrible and costly sacrifice For his ambition?Not even
for that Divinity or Daemon for which we all immolate so much!Mighty
ambition, forsooth, to succeed to the Rigbys!To enter the House of
Commons a slave and a tool; to move according to instructions, and
to labour for the low designs of petty spirits, without even the
consolation of being a dupe.What sympathy could there exist between
Coningsby and the 'great Conservative party,' that for ten years in
an age of revolution had never promulgated a principle; whose only
intelligible and consistent policy seemed to be an attempt, very
grateful of course to the feelings of an English Royalist, to revive
Irish Puritanism; who when in power in 1835 had used that power only to
evince their utter ignorance of Church principles; and who were at this
moment, when Coningsby was formally solicited to join their ranks, in
open insurrection against the prerogatives of the English Monarchy?'Do you anticipate then an immediate dissolution, sir?'inquired
Coningsby after a moment's pause.'We must anticipate it; though I think it doubtful.It may be next
month; it may be in the autumn; they may tide over another year, as Lord
Eskdale thinks, and his opinion always weighs with me.Tadpole believes they will dissolve at once.But whether they dissolve
now, or in a month's time, or in the autumn, or next year, our course
is clear.Monday next, there is a great Conservative dinner at Darlford.You
must attend it; that will be the finest opportunity in the world for you
to announce yourself.''Don't you think, sir,' said Coningsby, 'that such an announcement would
be rather premature?It is, in fact, embarking in a contest which may
last a year; perhaps more.''What you say is very true,' said Lord Monmouth; 'no doubt it is very
troublesome; very disgusting; any canvassing is.But we must take things
as we find them.You cannot get into Parliament now in the good old
gentlemanlike way; and we ought to be thankful that this interest has
been fostered for our purpose.'Coningsby looked on the carpet, cleared his throat as if about to speak,
and then gave something like a sigh.'I think you had better be off the day after to-morrow,' said Lord
Monmouth.'I have sent instructions to the steward to do all he can in
so short a time, for I wish you to entertain the principal people.''You are most kind, you are always most kind to me, dear sir,' said
Coningsby, in a hesitating tone, and with an air of great embarrassment,
'but, in truth, I have no wish to enter Parliament.''I feel that I am not sufficiently prepared for so great a
responsibility as a seat in the House of Commons,' said Coningsby.How can any one have a more agreeable seat?The only person to
whom you are responsible is your own relation, who brings you in.And I
don't suppose there can be any difference on any point between us.You
are certainly still young; but I was younger by nearly two years when
I first went in; and I found no difficulty.All you have got to do is to vote with your party.As for speaking, if
you have a talent that way, take my advice; don't be in a hurry.Learn
to know the House; learn the House to know you.If a man be discreet, he
cannot enter Parliament too soon.''It is not exactly that, sir,' said Coningsby.'Then what is it, my dear Harry?You see to-day I have much to do; yet
as your business is pressing, I would not postpone seeing you an hour.I
thought you would have been very much gratified.''You mentioned that I had nothing to do but to vote with my party, sir,'
replied Coningsby.'You mean, of course, by that term what is understood
by the Conservative party.''I am sorry,' said Coningsby, rather pale, but speaking with firmness,
'I am sorry that I could not support the Conservative party.'exclaimed Lord Monmouth, starting in his seat,'some woman
has got hold of him, and made him a Whig!''No, my dear grandfather,' said Coningsby, scarcely able to repress a
smile, serious as the interview was becoming, 'nothing of the kind, I
assure you.No person can be more anti-Whig.''I don't know what you are driving at, sir,' said Lord Monmouth, in a
hard, dry tone.'I wish to be frank, sir,' said Coningsby, 'and am very sensible of your
goodness in permitting me to speak to you on the subject.What I mean to
say is, that I have for a long time looked upon the Conservative party
as a body who have betrayed their trust; more from ignorance, I admit,
than from design; yet clearly a body of individuals totally unequal
to the exigencies of the epoch, and indeed unconscious of its real
character.''Well, between ourselves, I am quite of the same opinion.But we must
mount higher; we must go to '28 for the real mischief.But what is the
use of lamenting the past?Peel is the only man; suited to the times and
all that; at least we must say so, and try to believe so; we can't go
back.And it is our own fault that we have let the chief power out of
the hands of our own order.It was never thought of in the time of your
great-grandfather, sir.And if a commoner were for a season permitted
to be the nominal Premier to do the detail, there was always a secret
committee of great 1688 nobles to give him his instructions.''I should be very sorry to see secret committees of great 1688 nobles
again,' said Coningsby.'Then what the devil do you want to see?''Political faith,' said Coningsby, 'instead of political infidelity.''Before I support Conservative principles,' continued Coningsby, 'I
merely wish to be informed what those principles aim to conserve.It
would not appear to be the prerogative of the Crown, since the principal
portion of a Conservative oration now is an invective against a late
royal act which they describe as a Bed-chamber plot.Is it the Church
which they wish to conserve?What is a threatened Appropriation Clause
against an actual Church Commission in the hands of Parliamentary
Laymen?Well, then, if it
is neither the Crown nor the Church, whose rights and privileges this
Conservative party propose to vindicate, is it your House, the House
of Lords, whose powers they are prepared to uphold?Is it not notorious
that the very man whom you have elected as your leader in that House,
declares among his Conservative adherents, that henceforth the assembly
that used to furnish those very Committees of great revolution nobles
that you mention, is to initiate nothing; and, without a struggle, is
to subside into that undisturbed repose which resembles the Imperial
tranquillity that secured the frontiers by paying tribute?''All this is vastly fine,' said Lord Monmouth; 'but I see no means by
which I can attain my object but by supporting Peel.After all, what is
the end of all parties and all politics?I want to
turn our coronet into a ducal one, and to get your grandmother's barony
called out of abeyance in your favour.It is impossible that Peel can
refuse me.I have already purchased an ample estate with the view
of entailing it on you and your issue.You will make a considerable
alliance; you may marry, if you please, Lady Theresa Sydney.Count on my at once entering into any arrangement
conducive to your happiness.''My dear grandfather, you have ever been to me only too kind and
generous.''To whom should I be kind but to you, my own blood, that has never
crossed me, and of whom I have reason to be proud?Yes, Harry, it
gratifies me to hear you admired and to learn your success.All I want
now is to see you in Parliament.There is a sort of stiffness about every man, no matter what may be his
talents, who enters Parliament late in life; and now, fortunately, the
occasion offers.You will go down on Friday; feed the notabilities
well; speak out; praise Peel; abuse O'Connell and the ladies of the
Bed-chamber; anathematise all waverers; say a good deal about Ireland;
stick to the Irish Registration Bill, that's a good card; and, above
all, my dear Harry, don't spare that fellow Millbank.Remember, in
turning him out you not only gain a vote for the Conservative cause
and our coronet, but you crush my foe.Spare nothing for that object; I
count on you, boy.''I should grieve to be backward in anything that concerned your
interest or your honour, sir,' said Coningsby, with an air of great
embarrassment.'I am sure you would, I am sure you would,' said Lord Monmouth, in a
tone of some kindness.'And I feel at this moment,' continued Coningsby, 'that there is no
personal sacrifice which I am not prepared to make for them, except one.My interests, my affections, they should not be placed in the balance,
if yours, sir, were at stake, though there are circumstances which might
involve me in a position of as much mental distress as a man could well
endure; but I claim for my convictions, my dear grandfather, a generous
tolerance.''I can't follow you, sir,' said Lord Monmouth, again in his hard tone.'Our interests are inseparable, and therefore there can never be
any sacrifice of conduct on your part.What you mean by sacrifice of
affections, I don't comprehend; but as for your opinions, you have no
business to have any other than those I uphold.'I am sure I wish to express them with no unbecoming confidence,'
replied Coningsby; 'I have never intruded them on your ear before;
but this being an occasion when you yourself said, sir, I was about
to commence my public career, I confess I thought it was my duty to be
frank; I would not entail on myself long years of mortification by one
of those ill-considered entrances into political life which so many
public men have cause to deplore.''You go with your family, sir, like a gentleman; you are not to consider
your opinions, like a philosopher or a political adventurer.''Yes, sir,' said Coningsby, with animation, 'but men going with their
families like gentlemen, and losing sight of every principle on which
the society of this country ought to be established, produced the Reform
Bill.'said Lord Monmouth; 'if the Duke had not
quarrelled with Lord Grey on a Coal Committee, we should never have had
the Reform Bill.'You are in as great peril now as you were in 1830,' said Coningsby.'No, no, no,' said Lord Monmouth; 'the Tory party is organised now; they
will not catch us napping again: these Conservative Associations have
done the business.''At the best to turn
out the Whigs.And when you have turned out the Whigs, what then?You
may get your ducal coronet, sir.But a duke now is not so great a man
as a baron was but a century back.We cannot struggle against the
irresistible stream of circumstances.Power has left our order; this is
not an age for factitious aristocracy.As for my grandmother's barony, I
should look upon the termination of its abeyance in my favour as the
act of my political extinction.What we want, sir, is not to fashion
new dukes and furbish up old baronies, but to establish great principles
which may maintain the realm and secure the happiness of the people.Let
me see authority once more honoured; a solemn reverence again the habit
of our lives; let me see property acknowledging, as in the old days
of faith, that labour is his twin brother, and that the essence of all
tenure is the performance of duty; let results such as these be brought
about, and let me participate, however feebly, in the great fulfilment,
and public life then indeed becomes a noble career, and a seat in
Parliament an enviable distinction.''I tell you what it is, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, very drily,'members
of this family may think as they like, but they must act as I please.You must go down on Friday to Darlford and declare yourself a candidate
for the town, or I shall reconsider our mutual positions.I would say,
you must go to-morrow; but it is only courteous to Rigby to give him a
previous intimation of your movement.I
sent for Rigby this morning on other business which now occupies me, and
find he is out of town.He will return to-morrow; and will be here at
three o'clock, when you can meet him.You will meet him, I doubt not,
like a man of sense,' added Lord Monmouth, looking at Coningsby with a
glance such as he had never before encountered, 'who is not prepared to
sacrifice all the objects of life for the pursuit of some fantastical
puerilities.'His Lordship rang a bell on his table for Villebecque; and to prevent
any further conversation, resumed his papers.It would have been difficult for any person, unconscious of crime,
to have felt more dejected than Coningsby when he rode out of the
court-yard of Monmouth House.The love of Edith would have consoled
him for the destruction of his prosperity; the proud fulfilment of his
ambition might in time have proved some compensation for his crushed
affections; but his present position seemed to offer no single source
of solace.There came over him that irresistible conviction that is at
times the dark doom of all of us, that the bright period of our life is
past; that a future awaits us only of anxiety, failure, mortification,
despair; that none of our resplendent visions can ever be realised:
and that we add but one more victim to the long and dreary catalogue of
baffled aspirations.Nor could he indeed by any combination see the means to extricate
himself from the perils that were encompassing him.There was something
about his grandfather that defied persuasion.Prone as eloquent
youth generally is to believe in the resistless power of its appeals,
Coningsby despaired at once of ever moving Lord Monmouth.There had been
a callous dryness in his manner, an unswerving purpose in his spirit,
that at once baffled all attempts at influence.Nor could Coningsby
forget the look he received when he quitted the room.There was no
possibility of mistaking it; it said at once, without periphrasis,
'Cross my purpose, and I will crush you!'This was the moment when the sympathy, if not the counsels, of
friendship might have been grateful.A clever woman might have afforded
even more than sympathy; some happy device that might have even released
him from the mesh in which he was involved.And once Coningsby had
turned his horse's head to Park Lane to call on Lady Everingham.But
surely if there were a sacred secret in the world, it was the one which
subsisted between himself and Edith.Then there was Lady Wallinger; he could at least speak with freedom to
her.He looked in for a moment at a club
to take up the 'Court Guide' and find her direction.A few men were
standing in a bow window.Cassilis say,

'So Beau, they say, is booked at last; the new beauty, have you heard?''I saw him very sweet on her last night,' rejoined his companion.'Deuced deal, they say,' replied Mr.The father is a cotton
lord, and they all have loads of tin, you know.'He is in Parliament, is not he?'''Gad, I believe he is,' said Mr.Cassilis; 'I never know who is in
Parliament in these days.I remember when there were only ten men in the
House of Commons who were not either members of Brookes' or this place.'I hear 'tis an old affair of Beau,' said another gentleman.'It was all
done a year ago at Rome or Paris.''They say she refused him then,' said Mr.'Well, that is tolerably cool for a manufacturer's daughter,' said his
friend.'The Duke will be deuced glad to see Beau settled, I take it,' said Mr.'A good deal depends on the tin,' said his friend.Coningsby threw down the 'Court Guide' with a sinking heart.In spite
of every insuperable difficulty, hitherto the end and object of all his
aspirations and all his exploits, sometimes even almost unconsciously
to himself, was Edith.The strange manner of last night was
fatally explained.The heart that once had been his was now another's.To the man who still loves there is in that conviction the most profound
and desolate sorrow of which our nature is capable.All the recollection
of the past, all the once-cherished prospects of the future, blend into
one bewildering anguish.Coningsby quitted the club, and mounting his
horse, rode rapidly out of town, almost unconscious of his direction.He found himself at length in a green lane near Willesden, silent and
undisturbed; he pulled up his horse, and summoned all his mind to the
contemplation of his prospects.Now, should he return to his grandfather, accept his
mission, and go down to Darlford on Friday?Favour and fortune, power,
prosperity, rank, distinction would be the consequence of this step;
might not he add even vengeance?Was there to be no term to his
endurance?Might not he teach this proud, prejudiced manufacturer, with
all his virulence and despotic caprices, a memorable lesson?And his
daughter, too, this betrothed, after all, of a young noble, with her
flush futurity of splendour and enjoyment, was she to hear of him only,
if indeed she heard of him at all, as of one toiling or trifling in the
humbler positions of existence; and wonder, with a blush, that he ever
could have been the hero of her romantic girlhood?His cheek burnt at the possibility of such ignominy!It was a conjuncture in his life that required decision.He thought of
his companions who looked up to him with such ardent anticipations of
his fame, of delight in his career, and confidence in his leading; were
all these high and fond fancies to be balked?On the very threshold of
life was he to blunder?'Tis the first step that leads to all, and
his was to be a wilful error.He remembered his first visit to his
grandfather, and the delight of his friends at Eton at his report on his
return.After eight years of initiation was he to lose that favour then
so highly prized, when the results which they had so long counted on
were on the very eve of accomplishment?Parliament and riches, and rank
and power; these were facts, realities, substances, that none could
mistake.Was he to sacrifice them for speculations, theories, shadows,
perhaps the vapours of a green and conceited brain?He was like Caesar by the starry river's side, watching the image of the
planets on its fatal waters.The sun set; the twilight spell fell upon his soul; the exaltation
of his spirit died away.Beautiful thoughts, full of sweetness and
tranquillity and consolation, came clustering round his heart like
seraphs.He thought of Edith in her hours of fondness; he thought of
the pure and solemn moments when to mingle his name with the heroes of
humanity was his aspiration, and to achieve immortal fame the inspiring
purpose of his life.What were the tawdry accidents of vulgar ambition
to him?No domestic despot could deprive him of his intellect, his
knowledge, the sustaining power of an unpolluted conscience.If he
possessed the intelligence in which he had confidence, the world
would recognise his voice even if not placed upon a pedestal.If the
principles of his philosophy were true, the great heart of the nation
would respond to their expression.Coningsby felt at this moment a
profound conviction which never again deserted him, that the conduct
which would violate the affections of the heart, or the dictates of the
conscience, however it may lead to immediate success, is a fatal error.Conscious that he was perhaps verging on some painful vicissitude of his
life, he devoted himself to a love that seemed hopeless, and to a fame
that was perhaps a dream.It was under the influence of these solemn resolutions that he wrote,
on his return home, a letter to Lord Monmouth, in which he expressed
all that affection which he really felt for his grandfather, and all
the pangs which it cost him to adhere to the conclusions he had already
announced.In terms of tenderness, and even humility, he declined to
become a candidate for Darlford, or even to enter Parliament, except as
the master of his own conduct.CHAPTER V.


Lady Monmouth was reclining on a sofa in that beautiful boudoir which
had been fitted up under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, but as he
then believed for the Princess Colonna.The walls were hung with amber
satin, painted by Delaroche with such subjects as might be expected from
his brilliant and picturesque pencil.Fair forms, heroes and heroines
in dazzling costume, the offspring of chivalry merging into what is
commonly styled civilisation, moved in graceful or fantastic groups amid
palaces and gardens.The ceiling, carved in the deep honeycomb fashion
of the Saracens, was richly gilt and picked out in violet.Upon a violet
carpet of velvet was represented the marriage of Cupid and Psyche.It was about two hours after Coningsby had quitted Monmouth House, and
Flora came in, sent for by Lady Monmouth as was her custom, to read to
her as she was employed with some light work.''Tis a new book of Sue,' said Lucretia.Flora, seated by her side, began to read.Reading was an accomplishment
which distinguished Flora; but to-day her voice faltered, her expression
was uncertain; she seemed but imperfectly to comprehend her page.More
than once Lady Monmouth looked round at her with an inquisitive glance.madam,' she at last exclaimed, 'if you would but speak to Mr.said Lady Monmouth, turning quickly on the sofa; then,
collecting herself in an instant, she continued with less abruptness,
and more suavity than usual, 'Tell me, Flora, what is it; what is the
matter?''My Lord,' sobbed Flora, 'has quarrelled with Mr.An expression of eager interest came over the countenance of Lucretia.'I do not know they have quarrelled; it is not, perhaps, a right term;
but my Lord is very angry with Mr.'Not very angry, I should think, Flora; and about what?'very angry, madam,' said Flora, shaking her head mournfully.'My
Lord told M. Villebecque that perhaps Mr.Coningsby would never enter
the house again.'Coningsby has only left this hour or two.He will not
do what my Lord wishes, about some seat in the Chamber.I do not know
exactly what it is; but my Lord is in one of his moods of terror: my
father is frightened even to go into his room when he is so.'Coningsby came, and he found that Mr.Lady Monmouth rose from her sofa, and walked once or twice up and down
the room.Then turning to Flora, she said, 'Go away now: the book is
stupid; it does not amuse me.Stop: find out all you can for me about
the quarrel before I speak to Mr.Lucretia remained for some time in meditation;
then she wrote a few lines, which she despatched at once to Mr.What a great man was the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby!Here was one
of the first peers of England, and one of the finest ladies in London,
both waiting with equal anxiety his return to town; and unable to
transact two affairs of vast importance, yet wholly unconnected, without
his interposition!What was the secret of the influence of this man,
confided in by everybody, trusted by none?His counsels were not deep,
his expedients were not felicitous; he had no feeling, and he could
create no sympathy.It is that, in most of the transactions of life,
there is some portion which no one cares to accomplish, and which
everybody wishes to be achieved.In the eye of the world he had constantly the appearance of being
mixed up with high dealings, and negotiations and arrangements of fine
management, whereas in truth, notwithstanding his splendid livery and
the airs he gave himself in the servants' hall, his real business in
life had ever been, to do the dirty work.Rigby had been shut up much at his villa of late.He was concocting,
you could not term it composing, an article, a'very slashing article,'
which was to prove that the penny postage must be the destruction of the
aristocracy.It was a grand subject, treated in his highest style.His
parallel portraits of Rowland Hill the conqueror of Almarez and Rowland
Hill the deviser of the cheap postage were enormously fine.It was full
of passages in italics, little words in great capitals, and almost drew
tears.The statistical details also were highly interesting and novel.Several of the old postmen, both twopenny and general, who had been in
office with himself, and who were inspired with an equal zeal against
that spirit of reform of which they had alike been victims, supplied him
with information which nothing but a breach of ministerial duty could
have furnished.The prophetic peroration as to the irresistible progress
of democracy was almost as powerful as one of Rigby's speeches on
Aldborough or Amersham.There never was a fellow for giving a good
hearty kick to the people like Rigby.Himself sprung from the dregs of
the populace, this was disinterested.What could be more patriotic and
magnanimous than his Jeremiads over the fall of the Montmorencis and the
Crillons, or the possible catastrophe of the Percys and the Manners!The
truth of all this hullabaloo was that Rigby had a sly pension which,
by an inevitable association of ideas, he always connected with the
maintenance of an aristocracy.All his rigmarole dissertations on the
French revolution were impelled by this secret influence; and when he
wailed over 'la guerre aux chateaux,' and moaned like a mandrake over
Nottingham Castle in flames, the rogue had an eye all the while to
quarter-day!Arriving in town the day after Coningsby's interview with his
grandfather, Mr.Rigby found a summons to Monmouth House waiting him,
and an urgent note from Lucretia begging that he would permit nothing
to prevent him seeing her for a few minutes before he called on the
Marquess.Lucretia, acting on the unconscious intimation of Flora, had in the
course of four-and-twenty hours obtained pretty ample and accurate
details of the cause of contention between Coningsby and her husband.Rigby not only that Lord Monmouth was
highly incensed against his grandson, but that the cause of their
misunderstanding arose about a seat in the House of Commons, and that
seat too the one which Mr.Rigby had long appropriated to himself,
and over whose registration he had watched with such affectionate
solicitude.Lady Monmouth arranged this information like a firstrate artist, and
gave it a grouping and a colour which produced the liveliest effect
upon her confederate.The countenance of Rigby was almost ghastly as
he received the intelligence; a grin, half of malice, half of terror,
played over his features.'I told you to beware of him long ago,' said Lady Monmouth.'He is, he
has ever been, in the way of both of us.''He is in my power,' said Rigby.'He is in love with the daughter of Millbank, the man who bought
Hellingsley.'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, in a prolonged tone.'He was at Coningsby all last summer, hanging about her.I found the
younger Millbank quite domiciliated at the Castle; a fact which, of
itself, if known to Lord Monmouth, would ensure the lad's annihilation.''And you kept this fine news for a winter campaign, my good Mr.Rigby,'
said Lady Monmouth, with a subtle smile.'The time is not always ripe,' said Mr.Let us not conceal it from ourselves that,
since his first visit to Coningsby, we have neither of us really been in
the same position which we then occupied, or believed we should occupy.My Lord, though you would scarcely believe it, has a weakness for this
boy; and though I by my marriage, and you by your zealous ability,
have apparently secured a permanent hold upon his habits, I have never
doubted that when the crisis comes we shall find that the golden fruit
is plucked by one who has not watched the garden.There is
no reason why we two should clash together: we can both of us find what
we want, and more securely if we work in company.''I trust my devotion to you has never been doubted, dear madam.'Rid
me of this Coningsby, and I will secure you all that you want.'It shall be done,' said Rigby; 'it must be done.If once the notion
gets wind that one of the Castle family may perchance stand for
Darlford, all the present combinations will be disorganised.'So I hear for certain,' said Lucretia.'Be sure there is no time to
lose.What does he want with you to-day?''I know not: there are so many things.''To be sure; and yet I cannot doubt he will speak of this quarrel.Whatever his mood, the subject may be
introduced.If good, you will guide him more easily; if dark, the love
for the Hellingsley girl, the fact of the brother being in his castle,
drinking his wine, riding his horses, ordering about his servants; you
will omit no details: a Millbank quite at home at Coningsby will lash
him to madness!Go,
go, or he may hear that you have arrived.I shall be at home all the
morning.It will be but gallant that you should pay me a little visit
when you have transacted your business._Au revoir!_'

Lady Monmouth took up again her French novel; but her eyes soon glanced
over the page, unattached by its contents.Her own existence was too
interesting to find any excitement in fiction.It was nearly three years
since her marriage; that great step which she ever had a conviction was
to lead to results still greater.Of late she had often been filled with
a presentiment that they were near at hand; never more so than on
this day.Irresistible was the current of associations that led her to
meditate on freedom, wealth, power; on a career which should at the same
time dazzle the imagination and gratify her heart.Notwithstanding the
gossip of Paris, founded on no authentic knowledge of her husband's
character or information, based on the haphazard observations of the
floating multitude, Lucretia herself had no reason to fear that her
influence over Lord Monmouth, if exerted, was materially diminished.But
satisfied that he had formed no other tie, with her ever the test of
her position, she had not thought it expedient, and certainly would have
found it irksome, to maintain that influence by any ostentatious means.She knew that Lord Monmouth was capricious, easily wearied, soon palled;
and that on men who have no affections, affection has no hold.Their
passions or their fancies, on the contrary, as it seemed to her, are
rather stimulated by neglect or indifference, provided that they are not
systematic; and the circumstance of a wife being admired by one who is
not her husband sometimes wonderfully revives the passion or renovates
the respect of him who should be devoted to her.The health of Lord Monmouth was the subject which never was long absent
from the vigilance or meditation of Lucretia.She was well assured that
his life was no longer secure.She knew that after their marriage he had
made a will, which secured to her a large portion of his great wealth in
case of their having no issue, and after the accident at Paris all
hope in that respect was over.Recently the extreme anxiety which Lord
Monmouth had evinced about terminating the abeyance of the barony to
which his first wife was a co-heiress in favour of his grandson, had
alarmed Lucretia.To establish in the land another branch of the house
of Coningsby was evidently the last excitement of Lord Monmouth, and
perhaps a permanent one.If the idea were once accepted, notwithstanding
the limit to its endowment which Lord Monmouth might at the first start
contemplate, Lucretia had sufficiently studied his temperament to be
convinced that all his energies and all his resources would ultimately
be devoted to its practical fulfilment.Her original prejudice against
Coningsby and jealousy of his influence had therefore of late been
considerably aggravated; and the intelligence that for the first time
there was a misunderstanding between Coningsby and her husband filled
her with excitement and hope.She knew her Lord well enough to feel
assured that the cause for displeasure in the present instance could not
be a light one; she resolved instantly to labour that it should not
be transient; and it so happened that she had applied for aid in this
endeavour to the very individual in whose power it rested to accomplish
all her desire, while in doing so he felt at the same time he was
defending his own position and advancing his own interests.Lady Monmouth was now waiting with some excitement the return of Mr.His interview with his patron was of unusual length.An hour, and
more than an hour, had elapsed.Lady Monmouth again threw aside the book
which more than once she had discarded.She paced the room, restless
rather than disquieted.She had complete confidence in Rigby's ability
for the occasion; and with her knowledge of Lord Monmouth's character,
she could not contemplate the possibility of failure, if the
circumstances were adroitly introduced to his consideration.Still time
stole on: the harassing and exhausting process of suspense was acting
on her nervous system.She began to think that Rigby had not found
the occasion favourable for the catastrophe; that Lord Monmouth, from
apprehension of disturbing Rigby and entailing explanations on himself,
had avoided the necessary communication; that her skilful combination
for the moment had missed.Two hours had now elapsed, and Lucretia, in a
state of considerable irritation, was about to inquire whether Mr.Rigby
were with his Lordship when the door of her boudoir opened, and that
gentleman appeared.'Now sit down and
tell me what has passed.'Lady Monmouth pointed to the seat which Flora had occupied.'I thank your Ladyship,' said Mr.Rigby, with a somewhat grave and yet
perplexed expression of countenance, and seating himself at some little
distance from his companion, 'but I am very well here.'Instead of responding to the invitation of Lady
Monmouth to communicate with his usual readiness and volubility, Mr.Rigby was silent, and, if it were possible to use such an expression
with regard to such a gentleman, apparently embarrassed.'Well,' said Lady Monmouth, 'does he know about the Millbanks?''His Lordship was greatly shocked,' replied Mr.Rigby, with a pious
expression of features.As his Lordship
very justly observed, "It is impossible to say what is going on under my
own roof, or to what I can trust."''But he made an exception in your favour, I dare say, my dear Mr.'Lord Monmouth was pleased to say that I possessed his entire
confidence,' said Mr.Rigby, 'and that he looked to me in his
difficulties.''The steps which his Lordship is about to take with reference to the
establishment generally,' said Mr.Rigby, 'will allow the connection
that at present subsists between that gentleman and his noble relative,
now that Lord Monmouth's eyes are open to his real character, to
terminate naturally, without the necessity of any formal explanation.''But what do you mean by the steps he is going to take in his
establishment generally?''Lord Monmouth thinks he requires change of scene.'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, with
great impatience.'I hope he is not going again to that dreadful castle in Lancashire.''Lord Monmouth was thinking that, as you were tired of Paris, you might
find some of the German Baths agreeable.''Why, there is nothing that Lord Monmouth dislikes so much as a German
bathing-place!''Then how capricious in him wanting to go to them?''He does not want to go to them!'said Lady Monmouth, in a lower voice, and
looking him full in the face with a glance seldom bestowed.There was a churlish and unusual look about Rigby.It was as if
malignant, and yet at the same time a little frightened, he had screwed
himself into doggedness.He suggests that if your Ladyship were
to pass the summer at Kissengen, for example, and a paragraph in the
_Morning Post_ were to announce that his Lordship was about to join you
there, all awkwardness would be removed; and no one could for a moment
take the liberty of supposing, even if his Lordship did not ultimately
reach you, that anything like a separation had occurred.''I would never have consented to
interfere in the affair, but to secure that most desirable point.''I will see Lord Monmouth at once,' said Lucretia, rising, her natural
pallor aggravated into a ghoul-like tint.'His Lordship has gone out,' said Mr.'Our conversation, sir, then finishes; I wait his return.''His Lordship will never return to Monmouth House again.'And
he really thinks that I am to be crushed by such an instrument as this!He may leave Monmouth House, but I shall not.'Still anxious to secure an amicable separation,' said Mr.Rigby, 'your
Ladyship must allow me to place the circumstances of the case fairly
before your excellent judgment.Lord Monmouth has decided upon a course:
you know as well as I that he never swerves from his resolutions.He has
left peremptory instructions, and he will listen to no appeal.He has
empowered me to represent to your Ladyship that he wishes in every way
to consider your convenience.He suggests that everything, in short,
should be arranged as if his Lordship were himself unhappily no more;
that your Ladyship should at once enter into your jointure, which
shall be made payable quarterly to your order, provided you can find
it convenient to live upon the Continent,' added Mr.Rigby, with some
hesitation.'Why, then, we will leave your Ladyship to the assertion of your
rights.''I beg your Ladyship's pardon.I speak as the friend of the family, the
trustee of your marriage settlement, well known also as Lord Monmouth's
executor,' said Mr.Rigby, his countenance gradually regaining its
usual callous confidence, and some degree of self-complacency, as he
remembered the good things which he enumerated.'I have decided,' said Lady Monmouth.Your
master has mistaken my character and his own position.He shall rue the
day that he assailed me.''I should be sorry if there were any violence,' said Mr.Rigby,
'especially as everything is left to my management and control.An
office, indeed, which I only accepted for your mutual advantage.I think, upon reflection, I might put before your Ladyship some
considerations which might induce you, on the whole, to be of opinion
that it will be better for us to draw together in this business, as we
have hitherto, indeed, throughout an acquaintance now of some years.'Rigby was assuming all his usual tone of brazen familiarity.'Your self-confidence exceeds even Lord Monmouth's estimate of it,' said
Lucretia.'Now, now, you are unkind.I am
interfering in this business for your sake.It would have fallen to another, who would have fulfilled
it without any delicacy and consideration for your feelings.View my
interposition in that light, my dear Lady Monmouth, and circumstances
will assume altogether a new colour.''I beg that you will quit the house, sir.''I would with pleasure, to oblige you, were
it in my power; but Lord Monmouth has particularly desired that I should
take up my residence here permanently.For your Ladyship's sake, I wish
everything to be accomplished with tranquillity, and, if possible,
friendliness and good feeling.You can have even a week for the
preparations for your departure, if necessary.Any carriages, too, that you desire; your jewels, at least all
those that are not at the bankers'.The arrangement about your jointure,
your letters of credit, even your passport, I will attend to myself;
only too happy if, by this painful interference, I have in any way
contributed to soften the annoyance which, at the first blush, you may
naturally experience, but which, like everything else, take my word,
will wear off.''I shall send for Lord Eskdale,' said Lady Monmouth.Rigby, 'that Lord Eskdale will give you the
same advice as myself, if he only reads your Ladyship's letters,' he
added slowly, 'to Prince Trautsmansdorff.''Pardon me,' said Rigby, putting his hand in his pocket, as if to guard
some treasure, 'I have no wish to revive painful associations; but I
have them, and I must act upon them, if you persist in treating me as
a foe, who am in reality your best friend; which indeed I ought to be,
having the honour of acting as trustee under your marriage settlement,
and having known you so many years.''Leave me for the present alone,' said Lady Monmouth.'Send me my
servant, if I have one.I shall not remain here the week which you
mention, but quit at once this house, which I wish I had never entered.Rigby, you are now lord of Monmouth House, and yet I cannot
help feeling you too will be discharged before he dies.'Rigby made Lady Monmouth a bow such as became the master of the
house, and then withdrew.A paragraph in the _Morning Post_, a few days after his interview with
his grandfather, announcing that Lord and Lady Monmouth had quitted town
for the baths of Kissengen, startled Coningsby, who called the same day
at Monmouth House in consequence.There he learnt more authentic details
of their unexpected movements.It appeared that Lady Monmouth had
certainly departed; and the porter, with a rather sceptical visage,
informed Coningsby that Lord Monmouth was to follow; but when, he could
not tell.At present his Lordship was at Brighton, and in a few days was
about to take possession of a villa at Richmond, which had for some time
been fitting up for him under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, who, as
Coningsby also learnt, now permanently resided at Monmouth House.All
this intelligence made Coningsby ponder.He was sufficiently acquainted
with the parties concerned to feel assured that he had not learnt the
whole truth.What had really taken place, and what was the real cause of
the occurrences, were equally mystical to him: all he was convinced of
was, that some great domestic revolution had been suddenly effected.Coningsby entertained for his grandfather a sincere affection.With the
exception of their last unfortunate interview, he had experienced from
Lord Monmouth nothing but kindness both in phrase and deed.There was
also something in Lord Monmouth, when he pleased it, rather fascinating
to young men; and as Coningsby had never occasioned him any feelings but
pleasurable ones, he was always disposed to make himself delightful to
his grandson.The experience of a consummate man of the world, advanced
in life, detailed without rigidity to youth, with frankness and
facility, is bewitching.Lord Monmouth was never garrulous: he was
always pithy, and could be picturesque.He revealed a character in a
sentence, and detected the ruling passion with the hand of a master.Besides, he had seen everybody and had done everything; and though, on
the whole, too indolent for conversation, and loving to be talked to,
these were circumstances which made his too rare communications the more
precious.With these feelings, Coningsby resolved, the moment that he learned that
his grandfather was established at Richmond, to pay him a visit.He
was informed that Lord Monmouth was at home, and he was shown into a
drawing-room, where he found two French ladies in their bonnets, whom he
soon discovered to be actresses.They also had come down to pay a visit
to his grandfather, and were by no means displeased to pass the interval
that must elapse before they had that pleasure in chatting with his
grandson.Coningsby found them extremely amusing; with the finest
spirits in the world, imperturbable good temper, and an unconscious
practical philosophy that defied the devil Care and all his works.And
well it was that he found such agreeable companions, for time flowed on,
and no summons arrived to call him to his grandfather's presence, and
no herald to announce his grandfather's advent.The ladies and Coningsby
had exhausted badinage; they had examined and criticised all the
furniture, had rifled the vases of their prettiest flowers; and
Clotilde, who had already sung several times, was proposing a duet to
Ermengarde, when a servant entered, and told the ladies that a carriage
was in attendance to give them an airing, and after that Lord Monmouth
hoped they would return and dine with him; then turning to Coningsby, he
informed him, with his lord's compliments, that Lord Monmouth was sorry
he was too much engaged to see him.Nothing was to be done but to put a tolerably good face upon it.'Embrace Lord Monmouth for me,' said Coningsby to his fair friends, 'and
tell him I think it very unkind that he did not ask me to dinner with
you.'Coningsby said this with a gay air, but really with a depressed spirit.He felt convinced that his grandfather was deeply displeased with him;
and as he rode away from the villa, he could not resist the strong
impression that he was destined never to re-enter it.It so happened that the idle message which Coningsby had left
for his grandfather, and which he never seriously supposed for a moment
that his late companions would have given their host, operated entirely
in his favour.Whatever were the feelings with respect to Coningsby at
the bottom of Lord Monmouth's heart, he was actuated in his refusal to
see him not more from displeasure than from an anticipatory horror of
something like a scene.Even a surrender from Coningsby without terms,
and an offer to declare himself a candidate for Darlford, or to do
anything else that his grandfather wished, would have been disagreeable
to Lord Monmouth in his present mood.As in politics a revolution is
often followed by a season of torpor, so in the case of Lord Monmouth
the separation from his wife, which had for a long period occupied his
meditation, was succeeded by a vein of mental dissipation.He did not
wish to be reminded by anything or any person that he had still in
some degree the misfortune of being a responsible member of society.He wanted to be surrounded by individuals who were above or below the
conventional interests of what is called 'the World.'He wanted to hear
nothing of those painful and embarrassing influences which from our
contracted experience and want of enlightenment we magnify into such
undue importance.For this purpose he wished to have about him persons
whose knowledge of the cares of life concerned only the means of
existence, and whose sense of its objects referred only to the sources
of enjoyment; persons who had not been educated in the idolatry of
Respectability; that is to say, of realising such an amount of what is
termed character by a hypocritical deference to the prejudices of the
community as may enable them, at suitable times, and under convenient
circumstances and disguises, to plunder the public.With these feelings, Lord Monmouth recoiled at this moment from
grandsons and relations and ties of all kinds.He did not wish to be
reminded of his identity, but to swim unmolested and undisturbed in
his Epicurean dream.When, therefore, his fair visitors; Clotilde, who
opened her mouth only to breathe roses and diamonds, and Ermengarde, who
was so good-natured that she sacrificed even her lovers to her friends;
saw him merely to exclaim at the same moment, and with the same voices
of thrilling joyousness,--

'Why did not you ask him to dinner?'And then, without waiting for his reply, entered with that rapidity of
elocution which Frenchwomen can alone command into the catalogue of his
charms and accomplishments, Lord Monmouth began to regret that he really
had not seen Coningsby, who, it appeared, might have greatly contributed
to the pleasure of the day.The message, which was duly given,
however, settled the business.Lord Monmouth felt that any chance of
explanations, or even allusions to the past, was out of the question;
and to defend himself from the accusations of his animated guests, he
said,

'Well, he shall come to dine with you next time.'There is no end to the influence of woman on our life.It is at the
bottom of everything that happens to us.And so it was, that, in spite
of all the combinations of Lucretia and Mr.Rigby, and the mortification
and resentment of Lord Monmouth, the favourable impression he casually
made on a couple of French actresses occasioned Coningsby, before a
month had elapsed since his memorable interview at Monmouth House, to
receive an invitation again to dine with his grandfather.Clotilde and Ermengarde had wits as sparkling
as their eyes.There was a manager of the Opera, a great friend of
Villebecque, and his wife, a splendid lady, who had been a prima donna
of celebrity, and still had a commanding voice for a chamber; a Carlist
nobleman who lived upon his traditions, and who, though without a sou,
could tell of a festival given by his family, before the revolution,
which had cost a million of francs; and a Neapolitan physician, in whom
Lord Monmouth had great confidence, and who himself believed in the
elixir vitae, made up the party, with Lucian Gay, Coningsby, and Mr.Our hero remarked that Villebecque on this occasion sat at the
bottom of the table, but Flora did not appear.In the meantime, the month which brought about this satisfactory and
at one time unexpected result was fruitful also in other circumstances
still more interesting.Coningsby and Edith met frequently, if to
breathe the same atmosphere in the same crowded saloons can be described
as meeting; ever watching each other's movements, and yet studious never
to encounter each other's glance.The charms of Miss Millbank had
become an universal topic, they were celebrated in ball-rooms, they were
discussed at clubs: Edith was the beauty of the season.All admired her,
many sighed even to express their admiration; but the devotion of Lord
Beaumanoir, who always hovered about her, deterred them from a rivalry
which might have made the boldest despair.As for Coningsby, he passed
his life principally with the various members of the Sydney family, and
was almost daily riding with Lady Everingham and her sister, generally
accompanied by Lord Henry and his friend Eustace Lyle, between whom,
indeed, and Coningsby there were relations of intimacy scarcely less
inseparable.Coningsby had spoken to Lady Everingham of the rumoured
marriage of her elder brother, and found, although the family had not
yet been formally apprised of it, she entertained little doubt of
its ultimate occurrence.She admired Miss Millbank, with whom her
acquaintance continued slight; and she wished, of course, that her
brother should marry and be happy.'But Percy is often in love,' she
would add, 'and never likes us to be very intimate with his inamoratas.He thinks it destroys the romance; and that domestic familiarity may
compromise his heroic character.However,' she added, 'I really believe
that will be a match.'On the whole, though he bore a serene aspect to the world, Coningsby
passed this month in a state of restless misery.His soul was brooding
on one subject, and he had no confidant: he could not resist the spell
that impelled him to the society where Edith might at least be seen, and
the circle in which he lived was one in which her name was frequently
mentioned.Alone, in his solitary rooms in the Albany, he felt all his
desolation; and often a few minutes before he figured in the world,
apparently followed and courted by all, he had been plunged in the
darkest fits of irremediable wretchedness.He had, of course, frequently met Lady Wallinger, but their salutations,
though never omitted, and on each side cordial, were brief.There seemed
to be a tacit understanding between them not to refer to a subject
fruitful in painful reminiscences.In the fulfilment of a project originally formed
in the playing-fields of Eton, often recurred to at Cambridge, and
cherished with the fondness with which men cling to a scheme of early
youth, Coningsby, Henry Sydney, Vere, and Buckhurst had engaged some
moors together this year; and in a few days they were about to quit town
for Scotland.They had pressed Eustace Lyle to accompany them, but he,
who in general seemed to have no pleasure greater than their society,
had surprised them by declining their invitation, with some vague
mention that he rather thought he should go abroad.It was the last day of July, and all the world were at a breakfast
given, at a fanciful cottage situate in beautiful gardens on the banks
of the Thames, by Lady Everingham.The weather was as bright as the
romances of Boccaccio; there were pyramids of strawberries, in bowls
colossal enough to hold orange-trees; and the choicest band filled the
air with enchanting strains, while a brilliant multitude sauntered on
turf like velvet, or roamed in desultory existence amid the quivering
shades of winding walks.'My fete was prophetic,' said Lady Everingham, when she saw Coningsby.'I am glad it is connected with an incident.Tell me what we are to
celebrate.''Then I, too, will prophesy, and name the hero of the romance, Eustace
Lyle.''You have been more prescient than I,' said Lady Everingham, 'perhaps
because I was thinking too much of some one else.''It seems to me an union which all must acknowledge perfect.I have had my suspicions a long time; and when
Eustace refused to go to the moors with us, though I said nothing, I was
convinced.''At any rate,' said Lady Everingham, sighing, with a rather smiling
face, 'we are kinsfolk, Mr.Coningsby; though I would gladly have wished
to have been more.'Happiness,' he
added, in a mournful tone, 'I fear can never be mine.''tis a tale too strange and sorrowful for a day when, like Seged,
we must all determine to be happy.''Here comes a group that will make you gay,' said Coningsby as he
moved on.Edith and the Wallingers, accompanied by Lord Beaumanoir, Mr.Melton, and Sir Charles Buckhurst, formed the party.They seemed profuse
in their congratulations to Lady Everingham, having already learnt the
intelligence from her brother.Coningsby stopped to speak to Lady St.Julians, who had still a daughter
to marry.Both Augustina, who was at Coningsby Castle, and Clara
Isabella, who ought to have been there, had each secured the right man.But Adelaide Victoria had now appeared, and Lady St.Julians had a great
regard for the favourite grandson of Lord Monmouth, and also for the
influential friend of Lord Vere and Sir Charles Buckhurst.In case
Coningsby did not determine to become her son-in-law himself, he might
counsel either of his friends to a judicious decision on an inevitable
act.Ormsby, who seemed
occupied with some delicacies.no, no, no; those days are passed.I think there is a little
easterly wind with all this fine appearance.''I am for in-door nature myself,' said Lord Eskdale.'Do you know, I do
not half like the way Monmouth is going on?He never gets out of that
villa of his.'I had a letter from her to-day: she writes in good spirits.I am sorry
it broke up, and yet I never thought it would last so long.''I gave them two years,' said Mr.'Lord Monmouth lived with his
first wife two years.And afterwards with the Mirandola at Milan, at
least nearly two years; it was a year and ten months.I must know,
for he called me in to settle affairs.I took the lady to the baths at
Lucca, on the pretence that Monmouth would meet us there.I remember I wanted
to bet Cassilis, at White's, on it when he married; but I thought, being
his intimate friend; the oldest friend he has, indeed, and one of his
trustees; it was perhaps as well not to do it.''You should have made the bet with himself,' said Lord Eskdale, 'and
then there never would have been a separation.''Hah, hah, hah!About an hour after this, Coningsby, who had just quitted the Duchess,
met, on a terrace by the river, Lady Wallinger, walking with Mrs.Guy
Flouncey and a Russian Prince, whom that lady was enchanting.Coningsby
was about to pass with some slight courtesy, but Lady Wallinger stopped
and would speak to him, on slight subjects, the weather and the fete,
but yet adroitly enough managed to make him turn and join her.Guy Flouncey walked on a little before with her Russian admirer.Lady
Wallinger followed with Coningsby.'The match that has been proclaimed to-day has greatly surprised me,'
said Lady Wallinger.said Coningsby: 'I confess I was long prepared for it.And it
seems to me the most natural alliance conceivable, and one that every
one must approve.''Lady Everingham seems much surprised at it.'Lady Everingham is a brilliant personage, and cannot deign to
observe obvious circumstances.'Coningsby, that I always thought you were engaged to
Lady Theresa?''Indeed, we were informed more than a month ago that you were positively
going to be married to her.''I am not one of those who can shift their affections with such
rapidity, Lady Wallinger.''You remember our meeting you on the
stairs at ---- House, Mr.'Edith had just been informed that you were going to be married to Lady
Theresa.''Not surely by him to whom she is herself going to be married?''I am not aware that she is going to be married to any one.Lord
Beaumanoir admires her, has always admired her.But Edith has given
him no encouragement, at least gave him no encouragement as long as she
believed; but why dwell on such an unhappy subject, Mr.I
am to blame; I have been to blame perhaps before, but indeed I think it
cruel, very cruel, that Edith and you are kept asunder.''You have always been my best, my dearest friend, and are the most
amiable and admirable of women.But tell me, is it indeed true that
Edith is not going to be married?'Guy Flouncey turned round, and assuring Lady
Wallinger that the Prince and herself had agreed to refer some point
to her about the most transcendental ethics of flirtation, this deeply
interesting conversation was arrested, and Lady Wallinger, with
becoming suavity, was obliged to listen to the lady's lively appeal of
exaggerated nonsense and the Prince's affected protests, while Coningsby
walked by her side, pale and agitated, and then offered his arm to Lady
Wallinger, which she accepted with an affectionate pressure.At the end
of the terrace they met some other guests, and soon were immersed in the
multitude that thronged the lawn.'There is Sir Joseph,' said Lady Wallinger, and Coningsby looked up,
and saw Edith on his arm.Lord
Beaumanoir was there, but he seemed to shrink into nothing to-day before
Buckhurst, who was captivated for the moment by Edith, and hearing
that no knight was resolute enough to try a fall with the Marquess, was
impelled by his talent for action to enter the lists.He had talked down
everybody, unhorsed every cavalier.Nobody had a chance against him:
he answered all your questions before you asked them; contradicted
everybody with the intrepidity of a Rigby; annihilated your anecdotes by
historiettes infinitely more piquant; and if anybody chanced to make a
joke which he could not excel, declared immediately that it was a Joe
Miller.He was absurd, extravagant, grotesque, noisy; but he was young,
rattling, and interesting, from his health and spirits.Edith was
extremely amused by him, and was encouraging by her smile his spiritual
excesses, when they all suddenly met Lady Wallinger and Coningsby.The eyes of Edith and Coningsby met for the first time since they so
cruelly encountered on the staircase of ---- House.A deep, quick blush
suffused her face, her eyes gleamed with a sudden coruscation; suddenly
and quickly she put forth her hand.he presses once more that hand which permanently to retain is the
passion of his life, yet which may never be his!It seemed that for the
ravishing delight of that moment he could have borne with cheerfulness
all the dark and harrowing misery of the year that had passed away since
he embraced her in the woods of Hellingsley, and pledged his faith by
the waters of the rushing Darl.He seized the occasion which offered itself, a moment to walk by her
side, and to snatch some brief instants of unreserved communion.'And now we are to each other as before?''And will be, come what come may.'CHAPTER I.


It was merry Christmas at St.There was a yule log blazing
on every hearth in that wide domain, from the hall of the squire to the
peasant's roof.The Buttery Hatch was open for the whole week from noon
to sunset; all comers might take their fill, and each carry away as much
bold beef, white bread, and jolly ale as a strong man could bear in
a basket with one hand.For every woman a red cloak, and a coat of
broadcloth for every man.All day long, carts laden with fuel and warm
raiment were traversing the various districts, distributing comfort and
dispensing cheer.For a Christian gentleman of high degree was Eustace
Lyle.Within his hall, too, he holds his revel, and his beauteous bride
welcomes their guests, from her noble parents to the faithful tenants of
the house.All classes are mingled in the joyous equality that becomes
the season, at once sacred and merry.There are carols for the eventful
eve, and mummers for the festive day.The Duke and Duchess, and every member of the family, had consented this
year to keep their Christmas with the newly-married couple.Coningsby,
too, was there, and all his friends.The party was numerous, gay,
hearty, and happy; for they were all united by sympathy.They were planning that Henry Sydney should be appointed Lord of
Misrule, or ordained Abbot of Unreason at the least, so successful had
been his revival of the Mummers, the Hobby-horse not forgotten.Their host had entrusted to Lord Henry the restoration of many old
observances; and the joyous feeling which this celebration of Christmas
had diffused throughout an extensive district was a fresh argument in
favour of Lord Henry's principle, that a mere mechanical mitigation of
the material necessities of the humbler classes, a mitigation which must
inevitably be limited, can never alone avail sufficiently to ameliorate
their condition; that their condition is not merely 'a knife and fork
question,' to use the coarse and shallow phrase of the Utilitarian
school; that a simple satisfaction of the grosser necessities of our
nature will not make a happy people; that you must cultivate the heart
as well as seek to content the belly; and that the surest means to
elevate the character of the people is to appeal to their affections.There is nothing more interesting than to trace predisposition.An
indefinite, yet strong sympathy with the peasantry of the realm had been
one of the characteristic sensibilities of Lord Henry at Eton.Yet a
schoolboy, he had busied himself with their pastimes and the details of
their cottage economy.As he advanced in life the horizon of his views
expanded with his intelligence and his experience; and the son of one of
the noblest of our houses, to whom the delights of life are offered with
fatal facility, on the very threshold of his career he devoted his
time and thought, labour and life, to one vast and noble purpose, the
elevation of the condition of the great body of the people.'I vote for Buckhurst being Lord of Misrule,' said Lord Henry: 'I will
be content with being his gentleman usher.''It shall be put to the vote,' said Lord Vere.'No one has a chance against Buckhurst,' said Coningsby.'Now, Sir Charles,' said Lady Everingham, 'your absolute sway is about
to commence.'The first thing must be my formal installation,' said Buckhurst.'I
vote the Boar's head be carried in procession thrice round the hall, and
Beau shall be the champion to challenge all who may question my right.Duke, you shall be my chief butler, the Duchess my herb-woman.She is to
walk before me, and scatter rosemary.Coningsby shall carry the Boar's
head; Lady Theresa and Lady Everingham shall sing the canticle; Lord
Everingham shall be marshal of the lists, and put all in the stocks who
are found sober and decorous; Lyle shall be the palmer from the Holy
Land, and Vere shall ride the Hobby-horse.Some must carry cups of
Hippocras, some lighted tapers; all must join in chorus.'He ceased his instructions, and all hurried away to carry them into
effect.Some hastily arrayed themselves in fanciful dresses, the ladies
in robes of white, with garlands of flowers; some drew pieces of armour
from the wall, and decked themselves with helm and hauberk; others waved
ancient banners.They brought in the Boar's head on a large silver dish,
and Coningsby raised it aloft.They formed into procession, the Duchess
distributing rosemary; Buckhurst swaggering with all the majesty of
Tamerlane, his mock court irresistibly humorous with their servility;
and the sweet voice of Lady Everingham chanting the first verse of the
canticle, followed in the second by the rich tones of Lady Theresa:

  I.
        Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade in hande bring I,
  With garlandes gay and rosemary:
  I pray you all singe merrily,
        Qui estis in convivio.Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade I understande
  Is the chief servyce in this lande
  Loke whereever it be fande,
        Servite cum cantico.Then they stopped; and the Lord
of Misrule ascended his throne, and his courtiers formed round him
in circle.Behind him they held the ancient banners and waved their
glittering arms, and placed on a lofty and illuminated pedestal the
Boar's head covered with garlands.It was a good picture, and the Lord
of Misrule sustained his part with untiring energy.He was addressing
his court in a pompous rhapsody of merry nonsense, when a servant
approached Coningsby, and told him that he was wanted without.A despatch had arrived for him from
London.Without any prescience of its purpose, he nevertheless broke
the seal with a trembling hand.His presence was immediately desired in
town: Lord Monmouth was dead.This was a crisis in the life of Coningsby; yet, like many critical
epochs, the person most interested in it was not sufficiently aware
of its character.The first feeling which he experienced at the
intelligence was sincere affliction.He was fond of his grandfather; had
received great kindness from him, and at a period of life when it was
most welcome.The neglect and hardships of his early years, instead of
leaving a prejudice against one who, by some, might be esteemed their
author, had by their contrast only rendered Coningsby more keenly
sensible of the solicitude and enjoyment which had been lavished on his
happy youth.The next impression on his mind was undoubtedly a natural and reasonable
speculation on the effect of this bereavement on his fortunes.Lord
Monmouth had more than once assured Coningsby that he had provided for
him as became a near relative to whom he was attached, and in a manner
which ought to satisfy the wants and wishes of an English gentleman.The
allowance which Lord Monmouth had made him, as considerable as usually
accorded to the eldest sons of wealthy peers, might justify him in
estimating his future patrimony as extremely ample.He was aware,
indeed, that at a subsequent period his grandfather had projected for
him fortunes of a still more elevated character.He looked to Coningsby
as the future representative of an ancient barony, and had been
purchasing territory with the view of supporting the title.But
Coningsby did not by any means firmly reckon on these views being
realised.He had a suspicion that in thwarting the wishes of his
grandfather in not becoming a candidate for Darlford, he had at the
moment arrested arrangements which, from the tone of Lord Monmouth's
communication, he believed were then in progress for that purpose;
and he thought it improbable, with his knowledge of his grandfather's
habits, that Lord Monmouth had found either time or inclination to
resume before his decease the completion of these plans.Indeed there
was a period when, in adopting the course which he pursued with respect
to Darlford, Coningsby was well aware that he perilled more than the
large fortune which was to accompany the barony.Had not a separation
between Lord Monmouth and his wife taken place simultaneously with
Coningsby's difference with his grandfather, he was conscious that the
consequences might have been even altogether fatal to his prospects; but
the absence of her evil influence at such a conjuncture, its permanent
removal, indeed, from the scene, coupled with his fortunate though not
formal reconciliation with Lord Monmouth, had long ago banished from his
memory all those apprehensions to which he had felt it impossible at the
time to shut his eyes.Before he left town for Scotland he had made a
farewell visit to his grandfather, who, though not as cordial as in
old days, had been gracious; and Coningsby, during his excursion to the
moors, and his various visits to the country, had continued at intervals
to write to his grandfather, as had been for some years his custom.On
the whole, with an indefinite feeling which, in spite of many a rational
effort, did nevertheless haunt his mind, that this great and sudden
event might exercise a vast and beneficial influence on his worldly
position, Coningsby could not but feel some consolation in the
affliction which he sincerely experienced, in the hope that he might at
all events now offer to Edith a home worthy of her charms, her virtues,
and her love.Although he had not seen her since their hurried yet sweet
reconciliation in the gardens of Lady Everingham, Coningsby was never
long without indirect intelligence of the incidents of her life; and the
correspondence between Lady Everingham and Henry Sydney, while they
were at the moors, had apprised him that Lord Beaumanoir's suit had
terminated unsuccessfully almost immediately after his brother had
quitted London.It was late in the evening when Coningsby arrived in town: he called at
once on Lord Eskdale, who was one of Lord Monmouth's executors; and he
persuaded Coningsby, whom he saw depressed, to dine with him alone.'You should not be seen at a club,' said the good-natured peer; 'and I
remember myself in old days what was the wealth of an Albanian larder.'Lord Eskdale, at dinner, talked frankly of the disposition of Lord
Monmouth's property.He spoke as a matter of course that Coningsby was
his grandfather's principal heir.'I don't know whether you will be happier with a large fortune?''It is a troublesome thing: nobody is satisfied with
what you do with it; very often not yourself.To maintain an equable
expenditure; not to spend too much on one thing, too little on another,
is an art.There must be a harmony, a keeping, in disbursement, which
very few men have.The thing to have is about ten
thousand a year, and the world to think you have only five.There is
some enjoyment then; one is let alone.But the instant you have a large
fortune, duties commence.And then impudent fellows borrow your money;
and if you ask them for it again, they go about town saying you are a
screw.'Lord Monmouth had died suddenly at his Richmond villa, which latterly
he never quitted, at a little supper, with no persons near him but those
who were amusing.He suddenly found he could not lift his glass to his
lips, and being extremely polite, waited a few minutes before he asked
Clotilde, who was singing a sparkling drinking-song, to do him that
service.When, in accordance with his request, she reached him, it was
too late.The ladies shrieked, being frightened: at first they were
in despair, but, after reflection, they evinced some intention of
plundering the house.Villebecque, who was absent at the moment, arrived
in time; and everybody became orderly and broken-hearted.The body had been removed to Monmouth House, where it had been embalmed
and laid in state.There was
nobody in town; some distinguished connections, however, came up from
the country, though it was a period inconvenient for such movements.After the funeral, the will was to be read in the principal saloon of
Monmouth House, one of those gorgeous apartments that had excited the
boyish wonder of Coningsby on his first visit to that paternal roof, and
now hung in black, adorned with the escutcheon of the deceased peer.The testamentary dispositions of the late lord were still unknown,
though the names of his executors had been announced by his family
solicitor, in whose custody the will and codicils had always remained.The executors under the will were Lord Eskdale, Mr.By a subsequent appointment Sidonia had been added.Coningsby, who had been chief mourner,
stood on the right hand of the solicitor, who sat at the end of a long
table, round which, in groups, were ranged all who had attended the
funeral, including several of the superior members of the household,
among them M. Villebecque.The solicitor rose and explained that though Lord Monmouth had been in
the habit of very frequently adding codicils to his will, the original
will, however changed or modified, had never been revoked; it was
therefore necessary to commence by reading that instrument.So saying,
he sat down, and breaking the seals of a large packet, he produced the
will of Philip Augustus, Marquess of Monmouth, which had been retained
in his custody since its execution.By this will, of the date of 1829, the sum of 10,000_l._ was left to
Coningsby, then unknown to his grandfather; the same sum to Mr.There was a great number of legacies, none of superior amount, most of
them of less: these were chiefly left to old male companions, and women
in various countries.There was an almost inconceivable number of small
annuities to faithful servants, decayed actors, and obscure foreigners.The residue of his personal estate was left to four gentlemen, three of
whom had quitted this world before the legator; the bequests, therefore,
had lapsed.The fourth residuary legatee, in whom, according to the
terms of the will, all would have consequently centred, was Mr.There followed several codicils which did not materially affect the
previous disposition; one of them leaving a legacy of 20,000_l._ to
the Princess Colonna; until they arrived at the latter part of the year
1832, when a codicil increased the 10,000_l._ left under the will to
Coningsby to 50,000_l._.After Coningsby's visit to the Castle in 1836 a very important change
occurred in the disposition of Lord Monmouth's estate.The legacy of
50,000_l._ in his favour was revoked, and the same sum left to the
Princess Lucretia.A similar amount was bequeathed to Mr.Rigby; and
Coningsby was left sole residuary legatee.An estate of about
nine thousand a year, which Lord Monmouth had himself purchased, and was
therefore in his own disposition, was left to Coningsby.Rigby was reduced to 20,000_l._, and the whole of his residue left
to his issue by Lady Monmouth.In case he died without issue, the estate
bequeathed to Coningsby to be taken into account, and the residue then
to be divided equally between Lady Monmouth and his grandson.It was
under this instrument that Sidonia had been appointed an executor and
to whom Lord Monmouth left, among others, the celebrated picture of
the Holy Family by Murillo, as his friend had often admired it.To Lord
Eskdale he left all his female miniatures, and to Mr.Ormsby his rare
and splendid collection of French novels, and all his wines, except his
Tokay, which he left, with his library, to Sir Robert Peel; though this
legacy was afterwards revoked, in consequence of Sir Robert's conduct
about the Irish corporations.The solicitor paused and begged permission to send for a glass of water.While this was arranging there was a murmur at the lower part of the
room, but little disposition to conversation among those in the vicinity
of the lawyer.Coningsby was silent, his brow a little knit.Rigby
was pale and restless, but said nothing.Ormsby took a pinch of
snuff, and offered his box to Lord Eskdale, who was next to him.They
exchanged glances, and made some observation about the weather.Sidonia
stood apart, with his arms folded.He had not, of course attended the
funeral, nor had he as yet exchanged any recognition with Coningsby.'Now, gentlemen,' said the solicitor, 'if you please, I will proceed.'They came to the year 1839, the year Coningsby was at Hellingsley.This
appeared to be a critical period in the fortunes of Lady Monmouth; while
Coningsby's reached to the culminating point.Rigby was reduced to
his original legacy under the will of 10,000_l._; a sum of equal amount
was bequeathed to Armand Villebecque, in acknowledgment of faithful
services; all the dispositions in favour of Lady Monmouth were revoked,
and she was limited to her moderate jointure of 3,000_l._ per annum,
under the marriage settlement; while everything, without reserve, was
left absolutely to Coningsby.A subsequent codicil determined that the 10,000_l._ left to Mr.Rigby
should be equally divided between him and Lucian Gay; but as some
compensation Lord Monmouth left to the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby
the bust of that gentleman, which he had himself presented to his
Lordship, and which, at his desire, had been placed in the vestibule
at Coningsby Castle, from the amiable motive that after Lord Monmouth's
decease Mr.Rigby might wish, perhaps, to present it to some other
friend.Ormsby took care not to catch the eye of Mr.As for Coningsby, he saw nobody.He maintained, during the extraordinary
situation in which he was placed, a firm demeanour; but serene and
regulated as he appeared to the spectators, his nerves were really
strung to a high pitch.It bore the date of June 1840, and was
made at Brighton, immediately after the separation with Lady Monmouth.It was the sight of this instrument that sustained Rigby at this great
emergency.He had a wild conviction that, after all, it must set all
right.He felt assured that, as Lady Monmouth had already been disposed
of, it must principally refer to the disinheritance of Coningsby,
secured by Rigby's well-timed and malignant misrepresentations of what
had occurred in Lancashire during the preceding summer.And then to whom
could Lord Monmouth leave his money?However he might cut and carve up
his fortunes, Rigby, and especially at a moment when he had so served
him, must come in for a considerable slice.All the dispositions in favour of'my
grandson Harry Coningsby' were revoked; and he inherited from his
grandfather only the interest of the sum of 10,000_l._ which had been
originally bequeathed to him in his orphan boyhood.The executors had
the power of investing the principal in any way they thought proper
for his advancement in life, provided always it was not placed in 'the
capital stock of any manufactory.'Coningsby turned pale; he lost his abstracted look; he caught the eye
of Rigby; he read the latent malice of that nevertheless anxious
countenance.What passed through the mind and being of Coningsby was
thought and sensation enough for a year; but it was as the flash that
reveals a whole country, yet ceases to be ere one can say it lightens.There was a revelation to him of an inward power that should baffle
these conventional calamities, a natural and sacred confidence in his
youth and health, and knowledge and convictions.Even the recollection
of Edith was not unaccompanied with some sustaining associations.At
least the mightiest foe to their union was departed.All this was the impression of an instant, simultaneous with the reading
of the words of form with which the last testamentary disposition of the
Marquess of Monmouth left the sum of 30,000_l._ to Armand Villebecque;
and all the rest, residue, and remainder of his unentailed property,
wheresoever and whatsoever it might be, amounting in value to nearly a
million sterling, was given, devised, and bequeathed to Flora, commonly
called Flora Villebecque, the step-child of the said Armand Villebecque,
'but who is my natural daughter by Marie Estelle Matteau, an actress at
the Theatre Francais in the years 1811-15, by the name of Stella.'said Coningsby, with a grave rather than agitated
countenance, to Sidonia, as his friend came up to greet him, without,
however, any expression of condolence.'This time next year you will not think so,' said Sidonia.'The principal annoyance of this sort of miscarriage,' said Sidonia,
'is the condolence of the gentle world.For the present we
will not speak of it.'So saying, Sidonia good-naturedly got Coningsby
out of the room.They walked together to Sidonia's house in Carlton Gardens, neither of
them making the slightest allusion to the catastrophe; Sidonia inquiring
where he had been, what he had been doing, since they last met, and
himself conversing in his usual vein, though with a little more feeling
in his manner than was his custom.When they had arrived there, Sidonia
ordered their dinner instantly, and during the interval between the
command and its appearance, he called Coningsby's attention to an old
German painting he had just received, its brilliant colouring and quaint
costumes.'Eat, and an appetite will come,' said Sidonia, when he observed
Coningsby somewhat reluctant.'Take some of that Chablis: it will put
you right; you will find it delicious.'In this way some twenty minutes passed; their meal was over, and they
were alone together.'I have been thinking all this time of your position,' said Sidonia.'A sorry one, I fear,' said Coningsby.'I really cannot see that,' said his friend.'You have experienced this
morning a disappointment, but not a calamity.If you had lost your eye
it would have been a calamity: no combination of circumstances could
have given you another.There are really no miseries except natural
miseries; conventional misfortunes are mere illusions.What seems
conventionally, in a limited view, a great misfortune, if subsequently
viewed in its results, is often the happiest incident in one's life.''I hope the day may come when I may feel this.''Now is the moment when philosophy is of use; that is to say, now is
the moment when you should clearly comprehend the circumstances which
surround you.You think, for
example, that you have just experienced a great calamity, because you
have lost the fortune on which you counted?''I ask you again, which would you have rather lost, your grandfather's
inheritance or your right leg?''Most certainly my inheritance,'

'Or your left arm?''Would you have received the inheritance on condition that your front
teeth should be knocked out?''Would you have given up a year of your life for that fortune trebled?''Even at twenty-three I would have refused the terms.''Come, come, Coningsby, the calamity cannot be very great.''Why, you have put it in an ingenious point of view; and yet it is
not so easy to convince a man, that he should be content who has lost
everything.''You have a great many things at this moment that you separately prefer
to the fortune that you have forfeited.How then can you be said to have
lost everything?''You have health, youth, good looks, great abilities, considerable
knowledge, a fine courage, a lofty spirit, and no contemptible
experience.With each of these qualities one might make a fortune; the
combination ought to command the highest.''You console me,' said Coningsby, with a faint blush and a fainter
smile.I think you are a most
fortunate young man; I should not have thought you more fortunate if
you had been your grandfather's heir; perhaps less so.But I wish you
to comprehend your position: if you understand it you will cease to
lament.''Bring your intelligence to bear on the right object.I make you no
offers of fortune, because I know you would not accept them, and indeed
I have no wish to see you a lounger in life.If you had inherited a
great patrimony, it is possible your natural character and previous
culture might have saved you from its paralysing influence; but it is a
question, even with you.Now you are free; that is to say, you are free,
if you are not in debt.A man who has not seen the world, whose fancy is
harassed with glittering images of pleasures he has never experienced,
cannot live on 300_l._ per annum; but you can.You have nothing to haunt
your thoughts, or disturb the abstraction of your studies.You have seen
the most beautiful women; you have banqueted in palaces; you know what
heroes, and wits, and statesmen are made of: and you can draw on
your memory instead of your imagination for all those dazzling and
interesting objects that make the inexperienced restless, and are the
cause of what are called scrapes.But you can do nothing if you be in
debt.Before, therefore, we proceed, I must beg you
to be frank on this head.If you have any absolute or contingent
incumbrances, tell me of them without reserve, and permit me to clear
them at once to any amount.You will sensibly oblige me in so doing:
because I am interested in watching your career, and if the racer start
with a clog my psychological observations will be imperfect.''You are, indeed, a friend; and had I debts I would ask you to pay
them.My grandfather was so lavish in his
allowance to me that I never got into difficulties.Besides, there
are horses and things without end which I must sell, and money at
Drummonds'.''That will produce your outfit, whatever the course you adopt.I
conceive there are two careers which deserve your consideration.In the
first place there is Diplomacy.If you decide upon that, I can assist
you.There exist between me and the Minister such relations that I can
at once secure you that first step which is so difficult to obtain.After that, much, if not all, depends on yourself.But I could advance
you, provided you were capable.You should, at least, not languish for
want of preferment.In an important post, I could throw in your way
advantages which would soon permit you to control cabinets.I doubt not your success, and for such a career,
speedy.Suppose
yourself in a dozen years a Plenipotentiary at a chief court, or at
a critical post, with a red ribbon and the Privy Council in immediate
perspective; and, after a lengthened career, a pension and a peerage.A Diplomatist is, after all,
a phantom.There is a want of nationality about his being.I always look
upon Diplomatists as the Hebrews of politics; without country, political
creeds, popular convictions, that strong reality of existence which
pervades the career of an eminent citizen in a free and great country.''You read my thoughts,' said Coningsby.'I should be sorry to sever
myself from England.''There remains then the other, the greater, the nobler career,' said
Sidonia, 'which in England may give you all, the Bar.I am absolutely
persuaded that with the requisite qualifications, and with perseverance,
success at the Bar is certain.It may be retarded or precipitated by
circumstances, but cannot be ultimately affected.You have a right to
count with your friends on no lack of opportunities when you are ripe
for them.You appear to me to have all the qualities necessary for the
Bar; and you may count on that perseverance which is indispensable, for
the reason I have before mentioned, because it will be sustained by your
experience.''I have resolved,' said Coningsby; 'I will try for the Great Seal.'Alone in his chambers, no longer under the sustaining influence of
Sidonia's converse and counsel, the shades of night descending
and bearing gloom to the gloomy, all the excitement of his spirit
evaporated, the heart of Coningsby sank.All now depended on himself,
and in that self he had no trust.And even success
could only be conducted to him by the course of many years.His career,
even if prosperous, was now to commence by the greatest sacrifice which
the heart of man could be called upon to sustain.Upon the stern altar
of his fortunes he must immolate his first and enduring love.Before,
he had a perilous position to offer Edith; now he had none.The future
might then have aided them; there was no combination which could improve
his present.Under any circumstances he must, after all his thoughts and
studies, commence a new novitiate, and before he could enter the arena
must pass years of silent and obscure preparation.He looked up, his eye caught that drawing of the towers of Hellingsley
which she had given him in the days of their happy hearts.That was all
that was to remain of their loves.He was to bear it to the future
scene of his labours, to remind him through revolving years of toil and
routine, that he too had had his romance, had roamed in fair gardens,
and whispered in willing ears the secrets of his passion.That drawing
was to become the altar-piece of his life.Coningsby passed an agitated night of broken sleep, waking often with a
consciousness of having experienced some great misfortune, yet with an
indefinite conception of its nature.It was a gloomy day, a raw north-easter blowing up the cloisters of
the Albany, in which the fog was lingering, the newspaper on his
breakfast-table, full of rumoured particulars of his grandfather's
will, which had of course been duly digested by all who knew him.To the bright, bracing morn of that merry
Christmas!That radiant and cheerful scene, and those gracious and
beaming personages, seemed another world and order of beings to the
one he now inhabited, and the people with whom he must now commune.It was the wild excitement of despair, the frenzied
hope that blends inevitably with absolute ruin, that could alone have
inspired such a hallucination!His
energies could rally no more.He gave orders that he was at home to no
one; and in his morning gown and slippers, with his feet resting on the
fireplace, the once high-souled and noble-hearted Coningsby delivered
himself up to despair.The day passed in a dark trance rather than a reverie.He was like a particle of chaos; at the best,
a glimmering entity of some shadowy Hades.Towards evening the wind
changed, the fog dispersed, there came a clear starry night, brisk and
bright.Coningsby roused himself, dressed, and wrapping his cloak around
him, sallied forth.Once more in the mighty streets, surrounded by
millions, his petty griefs and personal fortunes assumed their proper
position.Well had Sidonia taught him, view everything in its relation
to the rest.Here was the mightiest of
modern cities; the rival even of the most celebrated of the ancient.Whether he inherited or forfeited fortunes, what was it to the passing
throng?They would not share his splendour, or his luxury, or his
comfort.But a word from his lip, a thought from his brain, expressed
at the right time, at the right place, might turn their hearts, might
influence their passions, might change their opinions, might affect
their destiny.As civilisation
advances, the accidents of life become each day less important.The power of man, his greatness and his glory, depend on essential
qualities.Brains every day become more precious than blood.You must
give men new ideas, you must teach them new words, you must modify
their manners, you must change their laws, you must root out prejudices,
subvert convictions, if you wish to be great.Greatness no longer
depends on rentals, the world is too rich; nor on pedigrees, the world
is too knowing.'The greatness of this city destroys my misery,' said Coningsby, 'and my
genius shall conquer its greatness.'This conviction of power in the midst of despair was a revelation of
intrinsic strength.It is indeed the test of a creative spirit.From
that moment all petty fears for an ordinary future quitted him.He felt
that he must be prepared for great sacrifices, for infinite suffering;
that there must devolve on him a bitter inheritance of obscurity,
struggle, envy, and hatred, vulgar prejudice, base criticism, petty
hostilities, but the dawn would break, and the hour arrive, when the
welcome morning hymn of his success and his fame would sound and be
re-echoed.He returned to his rooms; calm, resolute.He slept the deep sleep of
a man void of anxiety, that has neither hope nor fear to haunt his
visions, but is prepared to rise on the morrow collected for the great
human struggle.Fresh, vigorous, not rash or precipitate, yet
determined to lose no time in idle meditation, Coningsby already
resolved at once to quit his present residence, was projecting a visit
to some legal quarter, where he intended in future to reside, when his
servant brought him a note.Coningsby, with
great earnestness, to do her the honour and the kindness of calling on
her at his earliest convenience, at the hotel in Brook Street where she
now resided.It was an interview which Coningsby would rather have avoided; yet it
seemed to him, after a moment's reflection, neither just, nor kind, nor
manly, to refuse her request.She was, after
all, his kin.Was it for a moment to be supposed that he was envious of
her lot?He replied, therefore, that in an hour he would wait upon her.In an hour, then, two individuals are to be brought together whose first
meeting was held under circumstances most strangely different.Then
Coningsby was the patron, a generous and spontaneous one, of a being
obscure, almost friendless, and sinking under bitter mortification.His favour could not be the less appreciated because he was the
chosen relative of a powerful noble.That noble was no more; his vast
inheritance had devolved on the disregarded, even despised actress,
whose suffering emotions Coningsby had then soothed, and whose fortune
had risen on the destruction of all his prospects, and the balk of all
his aspirations.Flora was alone when Coningsby was ushered into the room.The extreme
delicacy of her appearance was increased by her deep mourning; and
seated in a cushioned chair, from which she seemed to rise with an
effort, she certainly presented little of the character of a fortunate
and prosperous heiress.'You are very good to come to me,' she said, faintly smiling.Coningsby extended his hand to her affectionately, in which she placed
her own, looking down much embarrassed.'You have an agreeable situation here,' said Coningsby, trying to break
the first awkwardness of their meeting.'Yes; but I hope not to stop here long?''No; I hope never to leave England!'There was a slight pause; and then Flora sighed and said,

'I wish to speak to you on a subject that gives me pain; yet of which I
must speak.'I am sure,' said Coningsby, in a tone of great kindness, 'that you
could injure no one.''It was not mine by any right, legal or moral.There were others who
might have urged an equal claim to it; and there are many who will now
think that you might have preferred a superior one.''You had enemies; I was not one.They sought to benefit themselves by
injuring you.They have not benefited themselves; let them not say that
they have at least injured you.''We will not care what they say,' said Coningsby; 'I can sustain my
lot.'She sighed again with a downcast
glance.Then looking up embarrassed and blushing deeply, she added, 'I
wish to restore to you that fortune of which I have unconsciously and
unwillingly deprived you.''The fortune is yours, dear Flora, by every right,' said Coningsby,
much moved; 'and there is no one who wishes more fervently that it may
contribute to your happiness than I do.''It is killing me,' said Flora, mournfully; then speaking with unusual
animation, with a degree of excitement, she continued, 'I must tell what
I feel.I am happy in the inheritance, if you
generously receive it from me, because Providence has made me the means
of baffling your enemies.I never thought to be so happy as I shall be
if you will generously accept this fortune, always intended for you.I
have lived then for a purpose; I have not lived in vain; I have returned
to you some service, however humble, for all your goodness to me in my
unhappiness.''You are, as I have ever thought you, the kindest and most
tender-hearted of beings.But you misconceive our mutual positions,
my gentle Flora.The custom of the world does not permit such acts to
either of us as you contemplate.It is left you by
one on whose affections you had the highest claim.I will not say
that so large an inheritance does not bring with it an alarming
responsibility; but you are not unequal to it.You have a good heart; you have good sense; you have a
well-principled being.Your spirit will mount with your fortunes, and
blend with them.'I shall soon learn to find content, if not happiness, from other
sources,' said Coningsby; 'and mere riches, however vast, could at no
time have secured my felicity.''But they may secure that which brings felicity,' said Flora, speaking
in a choking voice, and not meeting the glance of Coningsby.'You had
some views in life which displeased him who has done all this; they may
be, they must be, affected by this fatal caprice.Speak to me, for I
cannot speak, dear Mr.Coningsby; do not let me believe that I, who
would sacrifice my life for your happiness, am the cause of such
calamities!''Whatever be my lot, I repeat I can sustain it,' said Coningsby, with a
cheek of scarlet.he is angry with me,' exclaimed Flora; 'he is angry with me!'and
the tears stole down her pale cheek.dear Flora; I have no other feelings to you than those of
affection and respect,' and Coningsby, much agitated, drew his chair
nearer to her, and took her hand.'I am gratified by these kind wishes,
though they are utterly impracticable; but they are the witnesses of
your sweet disposition and your noble spirit.There never shall exist
between us, under any circumstances, other feelings than those of kin
and kindness.'When she saw that, she started, and seemed to
summon all her energies.'You are going,' she exclaimed, 'and I have said nothing, I have said
nothing; and I shall never see you again.This fortune is yours; it must be yours.Do
not think I am speaking from a momentary impulse.I have
lived so much alone, I have had so little to deceive or to delude me,
that I know myself.If you will not let me do justice you declare my
doom.I cannot live if my existence is the cause of all your prospects
being blasted, and the sweetest dreams of your life being defeated.When
I die, these riches will be yours; that you cannot prevent.Refuse my
present offer, and you seal the fate of that unhappy Flora whose fragile
life has hung for years on the memory of your kindness.''You must not say these words, dear Flora; you must not indulge in these
gloomy feelings.You must live, and you must live happily.You have
every charm and virtue which should secure happiness.The duties and
the affections of existence will fall to your lot.It is one that will
always interest me, for I shall ever be your friend.You have conferred
on me one of the most delightful of feelings, gratitude, and for that I
bless you.CHAPTER V.


About a week after this interview with Flora, as Coningsby one morning
was about to sally forth from the Albany to visit some chambers in the
Temple, to which his notice had been attracted, there was a loud ring, a
bustle in the hall, and Henry Sydney and Buckhurst were ushered in.There never was such a cordial meeting; and yet the faces of his
friends were serious.The truth is, the paragraphs in the newspapers had
circulated in the country, they had written to Coningsby, and after a
brief delay he had confirmed their worst apprehensions.Immediately they
came up to town.Henry Sydney, a younger son, could offer little but
sympathy, but he declared it was his intention also to study for the
bar, so that they should not be divided.Buckhurst, after many embraces
and some ordinary talk, took Coningsby aside, and said, 'My dear fellow,
I have no objection to Henry Sydney hearing everything I say, but still
these are subjects which men like to be discussed in private.Of course
I expect you to share my fortune.There was something in Buckhurst's fervent resolution very lovable and a
little humorous, just enough to put one in good temper with human nature
and life.If there were any fellow's fortune in the world that Coningsby
would share, Buckhurst's would have had the preference; but while he
pressed his hand, and with a glance in which a tear and a smile seemed
to contend for mastery, he gently indicated why such arrangements were,
with our present manners, impossible.'I see,' said Buckhurst, after a moment's thought, 'I quite agree with
you.The thing cannot be done; and, to tell you the truth, a fortune
is a bore.What I vote that we three do at once is, to take plenty of
ready-money, and enter the Austrian service.'There is something in that,' said Coningsby.'In the meantime, suppose
you two fellows walk with me to the Temple, for I have an appointment to
look at some chambers.'It was a fine day, and it was by no means a gloomy walk.Though the
two friends had arrived full of indignation against Lord Monmouth, and
miserable about their companion, once more in his society, and finding
little difference in his carriage, they assumed unconsciously their
habitual tone.As for Buckhurst, he was delighted with the Temple, which
he visited for the first time.The tombs in the
church convinced him that the Crusades were the only career.He would
have himself become a law student if he might have prosecuted his
studies in chain armour.The calmer Henry Sydney was consoled for the
misfortunes of Coningsby by a fanciful project himself to pass a portion
of his life amid these halls and courts, gardens and terraces, that
maintain in the heart of a great city in the nineteenth century, so much
of the grave romance and picturesque decorum of our past manners.Henry Sydney was sanguine; he was reconciled to the disinheritance of
Coningsby by the conviction that it was a providential dispensation to
make him a Lord Chancellor.These faithful friends remained in town with Coningsby until he was
established in Paper Buildings, and had become a pupil of a celebrated
special pleader.They would have remained longer had not he himself
suggested that it was better that they should part.It seemed a terrible
catastrophe after all the visions of their boyish days, their college
dreams, and their dazzling adventures in the world.'And this is the end of Coningsby, the brilliant Coningsby, that we all
loved, that was to be our leader!'said Buckhurst to Lord Henry as
they quitted him.'Well, come what may, life has lost something of its
bloom.''The great thing now,' said Lord Henry, 'is to keep up the chain of
our friendship.We must write to him very often, and contrive to be
frequently together.It is dreadful to think that in the ways of life
our hearts may become estranged.I never felt more wretched than I do at
this moment, and yet I have faith that we shall not lose him.'said Buckhurst; 'but I feel my plan about the Austrian service
was, after all, the only thing.He might
have been prime minister; several strangers have been; and as for war,
look at Brown and Laudohn, and half a hundred others.I had a much
better chance of being a field-marshal than he has of being a Lord
Chancellor.''I feel quite convinced that Coningsby will be Lord Chancellor,' said
Henry Sydney, gravely.This change of life for Coningsby was a great social revolution.Within a month after the death of his grandfather
his name had been erased from all his fashionable clubs, and his horses
and carriages sold, and he had become a student of the Temple.He
entirely devoted himself to his new pursuit.His being was completely
absorbed in it.There was nothing to haunt his mind; no unexperienced
scene or sensation of life to distract his intelligence.One sacred
thought alone indeed there remained, shrined in the innermost sanctuary
of his heart and consciousness.But it was a tradition, no longer a
hope.The moment that he had fairly recovered from the first shock of
his grandfather's will; had clearly ascertained the consequences to
himself, and had resolved on the course to pursue; he had communicated
unreservedly with Oswald Millbank, and had renounced those pretensions
to the hand of his sister which it ill became the destitute to prefer.Millbank met Henry Sydney and
Buckhurst at the chambers of Coningsby.Once more they were all
four together; but under what different circumstances, and with what
different prospects from those which attended their separation at Eton!Alone with Coningsby, Millbank spoke to him things which letters could
not convey.He bore to him all the sympathy and devotion of Edith; but
they would not conceal from themselves that, at this moment, and in the
present state of affairs, all was hopeless.In no way did Coningsby ever
permit himself to intimate to Oswald the cause of his disinheritance.He
was, of course, silent on it to his other friends; as any communication
of the kind must have touched on a subject that was consecrated in his
inmost soul.The state of political parties in England in the spring of 1841 offered
a most remarkable contrast to their condition at the period commemorated
in the first chapter of this work.The banners of the Conservative camp
at this moment lowered on the Whig forces, as the gathering host of the
Norman invader frowned on the coast of Sussex.The Whigs were not
yet conquered, but they were doomed; and they themselves knew it.The
mistake which was made by the Conservative leaders in not retaining
office in 1839; and, whether we consider their conduct in a national
and constitutional light, or as a mere question of political tactics and
party prudence, it was unquestionably a great mistake; had infused into
the corps of Whig authority a kind of galvanic action, which only the
superficial could mistake for vitality.Even to form a basis for their
future operations, after the conjuncture of '39, the Whigs were obliged
to make a fresh inroad on the revenue, the daily increasing debility
of which was now arresting attention and exciting public alarm.It was
clear that the catastrophe of the government would be financial.Under all the circumstances of the case, the conduct of the Whig
Cabinet, in their final propositions, cannot be described as deficient
either in boldness or prudence.The policy which they recommended was
in itself a sagacious and spirited policy; but they erred in supposing
that, at the period it was brought forward, any measure promoted by the
Whigs could have obtained general favour in the country.The Whigs were
known to be feeble; they were looked upon as tricksters.The country
knew they were opposed by a powerful party; and though there certainly
never was any authority for the belief, the country did believe that
that powerful party were influenced by great principles; had in their
view a definite and national policy; and would secure to England,
instead of a feeble administration and fluctuating opinions, energy and
a creed.The future effect of the Whig propositions of '41 will not be
detrimental to that party, even if in the interval they be appropriated
piecemeal, as will probably be the case, by their Conservative
successors.But for the moment, and in the plight in which the Whig
party found themselves, it was impossible to have devised measures more
conducive to their precipitate fall.Great interests were menaced by a
weak government.Tadpole and Taper
saw it in a moment.They snuffed the factious air, and felt the coming
storm.Notwithstanding the extreme congeniality of these worthies,
there was a little latent jealousy between them.Tadpole worshipped
Registration: Taper, adored a Cry.Tadpole always maintained that it
was the winnowing of the electoral lists that could alone gain the day;
Taper, on the contrary, faithful to ancient traditions, was ever of
opinion that the game must ultimately be won by popular clamour.It
always seemed so impossible that the Conservative party could ever be
popular; the extreme graciousness and personal popularity of the leaders
not being sufficiently apparent to be esteemed an adequate set-off
against the inveterate odium that attached to their opinions; that the
Tadpole philosophy was the favoured tenet in high places; and Taper had
had his knuckles well rapped more than once for manoeuvring too actively
against the New Poor-law, and for hiring several link-boys to bawl
a much-wronged lady's name in the Park when the Court prorogued
Parliament.And now, after all, in 1841, it seemed that Taper was right.There was
a great clamour in every quarter, and the clamour was against the Whigs
and in favour of Conservative principles.What Canadian timber-merchants
meant by Conservative principles, it is not difficult to conjecture;
or West Indian planters.It was tolerably clear on the hustings
what squires and farmers, and their followers, meant by Conservative
principles.What they mean by Conservative principles now is another
question: and whether Conservative principles mean something higher than
a perpetuation of fiscal arrangements, some of them impolitic, none of
them important.But no matter what different bodies of men understood by
the cry in which they all joined, the Cry existed.Taper beat Tadpole;
and the great Conservative party beat the shattered and exhausted Whigs.Notwithstanding the abstraction of his legal studies, Coningsby could
not be altogether insensible to the political crisis.In the political
world of course he never mixed, but the friends of his boyhood were
deeply interested in affairs, and they lost no opportunity which
he would permit them, of cultivating his society.Their occasional
fellowship, a visit now and then to Sidonia, and a call sometimes
on Flora, who lived at Richmond, comprised his social relations.His
general acquaintance did not desert him, but he was out of sight, and
did not wish to be remembered.Ormsby asked him to dinner, and
occasionally mourned over his fate in the bow window of White's; while
Lord Eskdale even went to see him in the Temple, was interested in his
progress, and said, with an encouraging look, that, when he was called
to the bar, all his friends must join and get up the steam.Rigby, who was walking with the Duke of Agincourt,
which was probably the reason he could not notice a lawyer.Lord Eskdale had obtained from Villebecque accurate details as to the
cause of Coningsby being disinherited.Our hero, if one in such fallen
fortunes may still be described as a hero, had mentioned to Lord Eskdale
his sorrow that his grandfather had died in anger with him; but Lord
Eskdale, without dwelling on the subject, had assured him that he had
reason to believe that if Lord Monmouth had lived, affairs would have
been different.He had altered the disposition of his property at a
moment of great and general irritation and excitement; and had been too
indolent, perhaps really too indisposed, which he was unwilling ever to
acknowledge, to recur to a calmer and more equitable settlement.Lord
Eskdale had been more frank with Sidonia, and had told him all about
the refusal to become a candidate for Darlford against Mr.Millbank; the
communication of Rigby to Lord Monmouth, as to the presence of Oswald
Millbank at the castle, and the love of Coningsby for his sister; all
these details, furnished by Villebecque to Lord Eskdale, had been truly
transferred by that nobleman to his co-executor; and Sidonia, when he
had sufficiently digested them, had made Lady Wallinger acquainted with
the whole history.The dissolution of the Whig Parliament by the Whigs, the project of
which had reached Lord Monmouth a year before, and yet in which nobody
believed to the last moment, at length took place.All the world was
dispersed in the heart of the season, and our solitary student of the
Temple, in his lonely chambers, notwithstanding all his efforts, found
his eye rather wander over the pages of Tidd and Chitty as he remembered
that the great event to which he had so looked forward was now
occurring, and he, after all, was no actor in the mighty drama.It was
to have been the epoch of his life; when he was to have found himself
in that proud position for which all the studies, and meditations, and
higher impulses of his nature had been preparing him.It was a keen
trial of a man.Every one of his friends and old companions were
candidates, and with sanguine prospects.Lord Henry was certain for a
division of his county; Buckhurst harangued a large agricultural
borough in his vicinity; Eustace Lyle and Vere stood in coalition for
a Yorkshire town; and Oswald Millbank solicited the suffrages of an
important manufacturing constituency.They sent their addresses to
Coningsby.He was deeply interested as he traced in them the influence
of his own mind; often recognised the very expressions to which he
had habituated them.Amid the confusion of a general election, no
unimpassioned critic had time to canvass the language of an address to
an isolated constituency; yet an intelligent speculator on the movements
of political parties might have detected in these public declarations
some intimation of new views, and of a tone of political feeling that
has unfortunately been too long absent from the public life of this
country.It was the end of a sultry July day, the last ray of the sun shooting
down Pall Mall sweltering with dust; there was a crowd round the doors
of the Carlton and the Reform Clubs, and every now and then an express
arrived with the agitating bulletin of a fresh defeat or a new triumph.He was going to dine at the Oxford
and Cambridge Club, the only club on whose list he had retained his
name, that he might occasionally have the pleasure of meeting an Eton or
Cambridge friend without the annoyance of encountering any of his former
fashionable acquaintances.The latter did not notice him, but Mr.Tadpole, more good-natured, bestowed on him a rough nod, not unmarked by
a slight expression of coarse pity.Coningsby ordered his dinner, and then took up the evening papers, where
he learnt the return of Vere and Lyle; and read a speech of Buckhurst
denouncing the Venetian Constitution, to the amazement of several
thousand persons, apparently not a little terrified by this unknown
danger, now first introduced to their notice.Being true Englishmen,
they were all against Buckhurst's opponent, who was of the Venetian
party, and who ended by calling out Buckhurst for his personalities.Coningsby had dined, and was reading in the library, when a waiter
brought up a third edition of the _Sun_, with electioneering bulletins
from the manufacturing districts to the very latest hour.Some large
letters which expressed the name of Darlford caught his eye.There
seemed great excitement in that borough; strange proceedings had
happened.The column was headed, 'Extraordinary Affair!His eye glanced over an animated speech of Mr.Millbank, his
countenance changed, his heart palpitated.Millbank had resigned
the representation of the town, but not from weakness; his avocations
demanded his presence; he had been requested to let his son supply his
place, but his son was otherwise provided for; he should always take a
deep interest in the town and trade of Darlford; he hoped that the
link between the borough and Hellingsley would be ever cherished; loud
cheering; he wished in parting from them to take a step which should
conciliate all parties, put an end to local heats and factious
contentions, and secure the town an able and worthy representative.For
these reasons he begged to propose to them a gentleman who bore a
name which many of them greatly honoured; for himself, he knew the
individual, and it was his firm opinion that whether they considered his
talents, his character, or the ancient connection of his family with
the district, he could not propose a candidate more worthy of their
confidence than HARRY CONINGSBY, ESQ.This proposition was received with that wild enthusiasm which
occasionally bursts out in the most civilised communities.The contest
between Millbank and Rigby was equally balanced, neither party was
over-confident.The Conservatives were not particularly zealous in
behalf of their champion; there was no Marquess of Monmouth and no
Coningsby Castle now to back him; he was fighting on his own resources,
and he was a beaten horse.The Liberals did not like the prospect of a
defeat, and dreaded the mortification of Rigby's triumph.The Moderate
men, who thought more of local than political circumstances, liked the
name of Coningsby.Millbank had dexterously prepared his leading
supporters for the substitution.Some traits of the character and
conduct of Coningsby had been cleverly circulated.Thus there was a
combination of many favourable causes in his favour.In half an hour's
time his image was stamped on the brain of every inhabitant of the
borough as an interesting and accomplished youth, who had been wronged,
and who deserved to be rewarded.It was whispered that Rigby was his
enemy.Rigby into the river, or to burn down his hotel, in case he was
prudent enough not to show.Rigby determined to fight to the last.All his hopes were now staked on the successful result of this contest.It were impossible if he were returned that his friends could refuse him
high office.The whole of Lord Monmouth's reduced legacy was devoted
to this end.The third edition of the _Sun_ left Mr.Rigby in vain
attempting to address an infuriated populace.Here was a revolution in the fortunes of our forlorn Coningsby!When his
grandfather first sent for him to Monmouth House, his destiny was
not verging on greater vicissitudes.He rose from his seat, and was
surprised that all the silent gentlemen who were about him did not mark
his agitation.It was now an hour
to midnight, and to-morrow the almost unconscious candidate was to go to
the poll.In a tumult of suppressed emotion, Coningsby returned to his
chambers.He found a letter in his box from Oswald Millbank, who had
been twice at the Temple.Oswald had been returned without a contest,
and had reached Darlford in time to hear Coningsby nominated.He set off
instantly to London, and left at his friend's chambers a rapid narrative
of what had happened, with information that he should call on him
again on the morrow at nine o'clock, when they were to repair together
immediately to Darlford in time for Coningsby to be chaired, for no one
entertained a doubt of his triumph.Coningsby did not sleep a wink that night, and yet when he rose early
felt fresh enough for any exploit, however difficult or hazardous.He
felt as an Egyptian does when the Nile rises after its elevation had
been despaired of.At the very lowest ebb of his fortunes, an event
had occurred which seemed to restore all.He dared not contemplate the
ultimate result of all these wonderful changes.Enough for him, that
when all seemed dark, he was about to be returned to Parliament by
the father of Edith, and his vanquished rival who was to bite the dust
before him was the author of all his misfortunes.Love, Vengeance,
Justice, the glorious pride of having acted rightly, the triumphant
sense of complete and absolute success, here were chaotic materials from
which order was at length evolved; and all subsided in an overwhelming
feeling of gratitude to that Providence that had so signally protected
him.It seemed
that Oswald was as excited as Coningsby.His eye sparkled, his manner
was energetic.'We must talk it all over during our journey.We have not a minute to
spare.'During that journey Coningsby learned something of the course of affairs
which gradually had brought about so singular a revolution in his
favour.We mentioned that Sidonia had acquired a thorough knowledge of
the circumstances which had occasioned and attended the disinheritance
of Coningsby.These he had told to Lady Wallinger, first by letter,
afterwards in more detail on her arrival in London.Lady Wallinger had
conferred with her husband.She was not surprised at the goodness of
Coningsby, and she sympathised with all his calamities.He had ever been
the favourite of her judgment, and her romance had always consisted in
blending his destinies with those of her beloved Edith.Sir Joseph was a
judicious man, who never cared to commit himself; a little selfish, but
good, just, and honourable, with some impulses, only a little afraid
of them; but then his wife stepped in like an angel, and gave them the
right direction.They were both absolutely impressed with Coningsby's
admirable conduct, and Lady Wallinger was determined that her husband
should express to others the convictions which he acknowledged in unison
with herself.Millbank, who stared; but Sir
Joseph spoke feebly.Lady Wallinger conveyed all this intelligence, and
all her impressions, to Oswald and Edith.The younger Millbank talked
with his father, who, making no admissions, listened with interest,
inveighed against Lord Monmouth, and condemned his will.Millbank made inquiries about Coningsby, took an
interest in his career, and, like Lord Eskdale, declared that when he
was called to the bar, his friends would have an opportunity to evince
their sincerity.Affairs remained in this state, until Oswald thought
that circumstances were sufficiently ripe to urge his father on
the subject.The position which Oswald had assumed at Millbank had
necessarily made him acquainted with the affairs and fortune of his
father.When he computed the vast wealth which he knew was at his
parent's command, and recalled Coningsby in his humble chambers, toiling
after all his noble efforts without any results, and his sister pining
in a provincial solitude, Oswald began to curse wealth, and to
ask himself what was the use of all their marvellous industry and
supernatural skill?He addressed his father with that irresistible
frankness which a strong faith can alone inspire.What are the objects
of wealth, if not to bless those who possess our hearts?The only
daughter, the friend to whom the only son was indebted for his life,
here are two beings surely whom one would care to bless, and both are
unhappy.Millbank listened without prejudice, for he was already
convinced.But he felt some interest in the present conduct of
Coningsby.A Coningsby working for his bread was a novel incident for
him.He was resolved to
convince himself of the fact.And perhaps he would have gone on yet
for a little time, and watched the progress of the experiment,
already interested and delighted by what had reached him, had not the
dissolution brought affairs to a crisis.The misery of Oswald at the
position of Coningsby, the silent sadness of Edith, his own conviction,
which assured him that he could do nothing wiser or better than take
this young man to his heart, so ordained it that Mr.Millbank, who
was after all the creature of impulse, decided suddenly, and decided
rightly.Never making a single admission to all the representations of
his son, Mr.Millbank in a moment did all that his son could have dared
to desire.This is a very imperfect and crude intimation of what had occurred
at Millbank and Hellingsley; yet it conveys a faint sketch of the
enchanting intelligence that Oswald conveyed to Coningsby during their
rapid travel.When they arrived at Birmingham, they found a messenger
and a despatch, informing Coningsby, that at mid-day, at Darlford, he
was at the head of the poll by an overwhelming majority, and that Mr.He was, however, requested to remain at Birmingham,
as they did not wish him to enter Darlford, except to be chaired, so
he was to arrive there in the morning.At Birmingham, therefore, they
remained.There was Oswald's election to talk of as well as Coningsby's.They had
hardly had time for this.Men must have been at school together, to enjoy the real fun of meeting
thus, and realising boyish dreams.Often, years ago, they had talked
of these things, and assumed these results; but those were words and
dreams, these were positive facts; after some doubts and struggles, in
the freshness of their youth, Oswald Millbank and Harry Coningsby
were members of the British Parliament; public characters, responsible
agents, with a career.This afternoon, at Birmingham, was as happy an afternoon as usually
falls to the lot of man.Both of these companions were labouring under
that degree of excitement which is necessary to felicity.Edith was no longer a forbidden or a sorrowful
subject.There was rapture in their again meeting under such
circumstances.Then there were their friends; that dear Buckhurst, who
had just been called out for styling his opponent a Venetian, and all
their companions of early days.What a sudden and marvellous change in
all their destinies!Life was a pantomime; the wand was waved, and it
seemed that the schoolfellows had of a sudden become elements of power,
springs of the great machine.A train arrived; restless they sallied forth, to seek diversion in the
dispersion of the passengers.Coningsby and Millbank, with that glance,
a little inquisitive, even impertinent, if we must confess it, with
which one greets a stranger when he emerges from a public conveyance,
were lounging on the platform.The train arrived; stopped; the doors
were thrown open, and from one of them emerged Mr.Coningsby, who
had dined, was greatly tempted to take off his hat and make him a bow,
but he refrained.He was evidently
used up; a man without a resource; the sight of Coningsby his last blow;
he had met his fate.'My dear fellow,' said Coningsby, 'I remember I wanted you to dine with
my grandfather at Montem, and that fellow would not ask you.About eleven o'clock the next morning they arrived at the Darlford
station.Here they were met by an anxious deputation, who received
Coningsby as if he were a prophet, and ushered him into a car covered
with satin and blue ribbons, and drawn by six beautiful grey horses,
caparisoned in his colours, and riden by postilions, whose very whips
were blue and white.Triumphant music sounded; banners waved; the
multitude were marshalled; the Freemasons, at the first opportunity,
fell into the procession; the Odd Fellows joined it at the nearest
corner.Preceded and followed by thousands, with colours flying,
trumpets sounding, and endless huzzas, flags and handkerchiefs waving
from every window, and every balcony filled with dames and maidens
bedecked with his colours, Coningsby was borne through enthusiastic
Darlford like Paulus Emilius returning from Macedon.Uncovered, still
in deep mourning, his fine figure, and graceful bearing, and his
intelligent brow, at once won every female heart.The singularity was, that all were of the same opinion: everybody
cheered him, every house was adorned with his colours.His triumphal
return was no party question.Magog Wrath and Bully Bluck walked
together like lambs at the head of his procession.The car stopped before the principal hotel in the High Street.The broad street was so crowded, that, as
every one declared, you might have walked on the heads of the people.Every window was full; the very roofs were peopled.The car stopped,
and the populace gave three cheers for Mr.Their late member,
surrounded by his friends, stood in the balcony, which was fitted up
with Coningsby's colours, and bore his name on the hangings in gigantic
letters formed of dahlias.The flashing and inquiring eye of Coningsby
caught the form of Edith, who was leaning on her father's arm.The hustings were opposite the hotel, and here, after a while, Coningsby
was carried, and, stepping from his car, took up his post to address,
for the first time, a public assembly.Anxious as the people were
to hear him, it was long before their enthusiasm could subside into
silence.He spoke; his
powerful and rich tones reached every ear.In five minutes' time every
one looked at his neighbour, and without speaking they agreed that there
never was anything like this heard in Darlford before.He addressed them for a considerable time, for he had a great deal to
say; not only to express his gratitude for the unprecedented manner in
which he had become their representative, and for the spirit in which
they had greeted him, but he had to offer them no niggard exposition
of the views and opinions of the member whom they had so confidingly
chosen, without even a formal declaration of his sentiments.He did this with so much clearness, and in a manner so pointed and
popular, that the deep attention of the multitude never wavered.His
lively illustrations kept them often in continued merriment.But when,
towards his close, he drew some picture of what he hoped might be the
character of his future and lasting connection with the town, the vast
throng was singularly affected.There were a great many present at that
moment who, though they had never seen Coningsby before, would willingly
have then died for him.Coningsby had touched their hearts, for he had
spoken from his own.Darlford
believed in Coningsby: and a very good creed.And now Coningsby was conducted to the opposite hotel.The progress was slow, as every one wished to shake hands
with him.His friends, however, at last safely landed him.He sprang
up the stairs; he was met by Mr.Millbank, who welcomed him with the
greatest warmth, and offered his hearty congratulations.'It is to you, dear sir, that I am indebted for all this,' said
Coningsby.Millbank, 'it is to your own high principles, great
talents, and good heart.'After he had been presented by the late member to the principal
personages in the borough, Mr.Millbank said,

'I think we must now give Mr.Come with me,' he
added, 'here is some one who will be very glad to see you.'Speaking thus, he led our hero a little away, and placing his arm in
Coningsby's with great affection opened the door of an apartment.There
was Edith, radiant with loveliness and beaming with love.Their agitated
hearts told at a glance the tumult of their joy.The father joined their
hands, and blessed them with words of tenderness.The marriage of Coningsby and Edith took place early in the autumn.It was solemnised at Millbank, and they passed their first moon at
Hellingsley, which place was in future to be the residence of the member
for Darlford.The estate was to devolve to Coningsby after the death of
Mr.Millbank, who in the meantime made arrangements which permitted
the newly-married couple to reside at the Hall in a manner becoming its
occupants.Millbank assured Coningsby,
were effected not only with the sanction, but at the express instance,
of his son.An event, however, occurred not very long after the marriage of
Coningsby, which rendered this generous conduct of his father-in-law no
longer necessary to his fortunes, though he never forgot its exercise.The gentle and unhappy daughter of Lord Monmouth quitted a scene with
which her spirit had never greatly sympathised.Perhaps she might have
lingered in life for yet a little while, had it not been for that fatal
inheritance which disturbed her peace and embittered her days, haunting
her heart with the recollection that she had been the unconscious
instrument of injuring the only being whom she loved, and embarrassing
and encumbering her with duties foreign to her experience and her
nature.The marriage of Coningsby had greatly affected her, and from
that day she seemed gradually to decline.She died towards the end
of the autumn, and, subject to an ample annuity to Villebecque, she
bequeathed the whole of her fortune to the husband of Edith.Gratifying
as it was to him to present such an inheritance to his wife, it was not
without a pang that he received the intelligence of the death of Flora.Edith sympathised in his affectionate feelings, and they raised a
monument to her memory in the gardens of Hellingsley.Coningsby passed his next Christmas in his own hall with his beautiful
and gifted wife by his side, and surrounded by the friends of his heart
and his youth.They stand now on the threshold of public life.They are in the leash,
but in a moment they will be slipped.Will they
maintain in august assemblies and high places the great truths which, in
study and in solitude, they have embraced?Or will their courage exhaust
itself in the struggle, their enthusiasm evaporate before hollow-hearted
ridicule, their generous impulses yield with a vulgar catastrophe to the
tawdry temptations of a low ambition?Will their skilled intelligence
subside into being the adroit tool of a corrupt party?Will Vanity
confound their fortunes, or Jealousy wither their sympathies?Or will
they remain brave, single, and true; refuse to bow before shadows and
worship phrases; sensible of the greatness of their position, recognise
the greatness of their duties; denounce to a perplexed and disheartened
world the frigid theories of a generalising age that have destroyed
the individuality of man, and restore the happiness of their country by
believing in their own energies, and daring to be great?[1]  "Because some things
essential to this Sacrament may happen to be omitted (and thus
invalidate the Sacrament),... I demand," says the priest, {64} "with
what matter was this child baptized?"and "with what words was this
child baptized?"And because the omission of right matter or right
words would invalidate the Sacrament, further inquiry is made, and the
god-parents are asked: "by whom was this child baptized?": "who was
present when this child was baptized?"Additional security is taken,
if there is the slightest reason to question the evidence given.The
child is then given "Conditional Baptism," and Baptism is administered
with the conditional words: "If thou art not already baptized,"--for
Baptism cannot be repeated--"I baptize thee in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.So careful is the
Church both in administering and guarding the essentials of the
Sacrament.And notice: nothing but the water and the words are _essential_.Other
things may, or may not, be edifying; they are not essential; they are
matters of ecclesiastical regulation, not of Divine appointment.Thus,
a _Priest_ is not essential to a valid Baptism, as he is for a valid
Eucharist.A Priest is the normal, but not the necessary, instrument
of Baptism."In the absence of a {65} Priest"[2] a Deacon may baptize,
and if the child is _in extremis_, any one, of either sex, may baptize.Again, _Sponsors_ are not essential to the validity of the Sacrament.They are only a part--an
invaluable part--of ecclesiastical regulation.When, in times of
persecution, parents might be put to death, other parents were chosen
as parents-in-God (God-parents)[3] to safeguard the child's Christian
career.Sponsors are "sureties" of the Church, not parts of the
Sacraments.They stand at the font, as fully admitted Church members,
to welcome a new member into the Brotherhood.But a private Baptism
without Sponsors would be a valid Baptism.So, too, in regard to _Ceremonial_.The mode of administering the
Sacrament may vary: it is not (apart from the matter and words) of the
essence of the Sacrament.There are, in fact, three ways in which
Baptism may be validly administered.It may be administered by
_Immersion_, _Aspersion_, or _Affusion_.Immersion (_in-mergere_, to dip into) is the original and primitive
form of administration.{66} As the word suggests, it consists of
dipping the candidate into the water--river, bath, or font.Aspersion (_ad spargere_, to sprinkle upon) is not a primitive form of
administration.It consists in sprinkling water upon the candidate's
forehead.Affusion (_ad fundere_, to pour upon) is the allowed alternative to
Immersion.Immersion was the Apostolic method, and
explains most vividly the Apostolic teaching (in which the Candidate is
"buried with Christ" by immersion, and rises again by emersion)[4] no
less than the meaning of the word--from the Greek _baptizo_, to dip.Provision for Immersion has been made by a Fontgrave, in Lambeth Parish
Church, erected in memory of Archbishop Benson, and constantly made use
of.But, even in Apostolic times, Baptism by "Affusion" was allowed to
the sick and was equally valid.In the Prayer Book, affusion is either
permitted (as in the Public Baptism of infants), or ordered (as in the
Private Baptism of infants), or, again, allowed (as in the Baptism of
those of riper years).It will be {67} noted that the Church of
England makes no allusion to "Aspersion," or the "sprinkling" form of
administration.The child or adult is always either to be dipped into
the water, or to have water poured upon it.[5]  Other ceremonies there
are--ancient and mediaeval.Some are full of beauty, but none are
essential.Thus, in the first Prayer Book of 1549, a white vesture,
called the _Chrisome_[6] or _Chrism_, was put upon the candidate, the
Priest saying: "Take this white vesture for a token of innocency which,
by God's grace, in the Holy Sacrament of Baptism, is given unto thee".It typified the white life to which the one anointed with the Chrisma,
or symbolical oil, was dedicated.[7]

{68}

Another ancient custom was to give the newly baptized _milk and honey_.Clement of Alexandria writes: "As soon as we are born again, we
become entitled to the hope of rest, the promise of Jerusalem which is
above, where it is said to rain milk and honey"._Consignation_, again, or the "signing with the sign of the cross,"
dates from a very early period.[8]  It marks the child as belonging to
the Good Shepherd, even as a lamb is marked with the owner's mark or
sign.Giving salt as a symbol of wisdom (_sal sapientiae_); placing a lighted
taper in the child's hand, typifying the illuminating Spirit; turning
to the west to renounce the enemy of the Faith, and then to the east to
recite our belief in that Faith; striking three blows with the hand,
symbolical of fighting against the world, the flesh, and the devil: all
such ceremonies, and many more, have their due place, and mystic
meaning: but they are not part of the Sacrament.They are, {69} as it
were, scenery, beautiful scenery, round the Sacrament; frescoes on the
walls; the "beauty of holiness"; "lily-work upon the top of the
pillars";[9] the handmaids of the Sacrament, but not essential to the
Sacrament.To deny that the Church of England rightly and duly
administers the Sacrament because she omits any one of these
ceremonies, is to confuse the picture with the frame, the jewel with
its setting, the beautiful with the essential.[10]

We may deplore the loss of this or that Ceremony, but a National Church
exercises her undoubted right in saying at any particular period of her
history how the Sacrament is to be administered, provided the
essentials of the Sacrament are left untouched.The Church Universal
decides, once for all, what is essential: {70} the National Church
decides how best to secure and safeguard these essentials for her own
_Use_.According to the Scriptures, "_Baptism doth now save us_".[11]  As God
did "save Noah and his family in the Ark from perishing by water," so
does God save the human family from perishing by sin.As Noah and his
family could, by an act of free will, have opened a window in the Ark,
and have leapt into the waters, and frustrated God's purpose after they
had been saved, so can any member of the human family, after it has
been taken into the "Ark of Christ's Church," frustrate God's "good
will towards" it, and wilfully leap out of its saving shelter.Baptism
is "a beginning," not an end.[12]  It puts us into a state of
Salvation.Cyprian says
that in Baptism "we start crowned," and St.John says: "Hold fast that
which thou hast that no man take thy crown".[13] Baptism is the
Sacrament of initiation, not of finality.Directly the child is
baptized, we pray that he "may lead the rest of his life according {71}
to _this beginning_," and we heartily thank God for having, in Baptism,
called us into a state of Salvation.In this sense, "Baptism doth save
us".In the Nicene Creed we say: "I
believe in one Baptism for the remission of _sins_".Baptism saves us
from our sins.In the case of infants, Baptism saves from original, or inherited,
sin--the sin whose origin can be traced to the Fall.In the case of
adults, Baptism saves from both original and actual sin, both birth sin
and life sin.The Prayer Book is as explicit as the Bible on this point.In the case
of infants, we pray:

"We call upon Thee for this infant, that he, _coming to Thy Holy
Baptism_, may receive remission of his sins"--before, i.e., the child
has, by free will choice, committed actual sin.In the case of adults,
we read: "Well-beloved, who are come hither desiring _to receive Holy
Baptism_, ye have heard how the congregation hath prayed, that our Lord
Jesus Christ would vouchsafe to... _release you of your sins_".And,
again, dealing with infants, the Rubric at the end of the "Public
Baptism of Infants" declares that "It is certain, by God's Word, that
children _who are {72} baptized_, dying before they commit _actual
sin_, are undoubtedly saved".In affirming this, the Church does not condemn all the unbaptized,
infants or adults, to everlasting perdition, as the teaching of some
is.Every affirmation does not necessarily involve its opposite
negation.It was thousands of years before any souls at all were
baptized on earth, and even now, few[14] in comparison with the total
population of the civilized and uncivilized world, have been baptized.The Church nowhere assumes the self-imposed burden of legislation for
these, or limits their chance of salvation to the Church Militant.What she does do, is to proclaim her unswerving belief in "one Baptism
for the remission of sins"; and her unfailing faith in God's promises
to those who _are_ baptized--"which promise, He, for His part, will
most surely keep and perform".On this point, she speaks with nothing
short of "undoubted certainty"; on the other point, she is silent.She
does not condemn an infant because no responsible person has brought it
to Baptism, though she does condemn the person for not bringing it.She does not limit {73} the power of grace to souls in this life only,
but she does offer grace in this world, which may land the soul safely
in the world to come.Making the child a member of Christ, it
gives it a "Christ-ian" name.This Christian, or fore-name as it was called, is the real name.It
antedates the surname by many centuries, surnames being unknown in
England before the Norman invasion.The Christian name is the
Christ-name.It cannot, by any known legal method, be changed.Surnames may be changed in various legal ways: not so the Christian
name.[15]  This was more apparent when the baptized were given only one
Christian name, for it was not until the eighteenth century that a
second or third name was added, and then only on grounds of convenience.Again, according to the law of England, the only legal way in which a
Christian name can be given, is by Baptism.Thus, if a child has been
registered in one name, and is afterwards baptized {74} in another, the
Baptismal, and not the registered, name is its legal name, even if the
registered name was given first.It is strange that, in view of all this, peers should drop their
Christian names, i.e.their real names, their Baptismal names.The
custom, apparently, dates only from the Stuart period, and is not easy
to account for.The same
loss, if it be a loss, is incurred by the Town Clerk of London, who
omits his Christian name in signing official documents.[16]  The King,
more happily, retains his Baptismal or Christian name, and has no
surname.[17]  Bishops sign themselves by both their {75} Christian and
official name, as "Randall Cantuar; Cosmo Ebor.; A. F. London; H. E.
Winton; F.We may consider three words, both helps and puzzles, used in connexion
with Holy Baptism: _Regeneration, Adoption, Election_.Each has its
own separate teaching, though there are points at which their meanings
run into each other."We yield Thee hearty thanks that it hath pleased Thee to regenerate
this infant."So runs the Prayer-Book thanksgiving after baptism.The word regeneration comes from two Latin words,
_re_, again, _generare_, to generate, and means exactly what it says.In Prayer-Book language, it means being "_born again_".And, notice,
it refers to infants as well {76} as to adults.The new birth is as
independent of the child's choice as the natural birth.And this is just what we should expect from a God of love.The child
is not consulted about his first birth, neither is he consulted about
his second birth.He does not wait (as the Baptists teach) until he is
old enough to make a free choice of second birth, but as soon as he is
born into the world ("within seven or fourteen days," the Prayer Book
orders) he is reborn into the Church.Grace does not let nature get
ten to twenty years' start, but gives the soul a fair chance from the
very first: and so, and only so, is a God of love "justified in His
saying, and clear when He is judged".The Baptismal Thanksgiving calls the
Baptized "God's own child by Adoption".A simple illustration will
best explain the word.When a man is "naturalized," he speaks of his
new country as the land of his _adoption_.If a Frenchman becomes a
naturalized Englishman, he ceases legally to be a Frenchman; ceases to
be under French law; ceases to serve in the French army.He {77}
becomes legally an Englishman; he is under English law; serves in the
English army; has all the privileges and obligations of a "new-born"
Englishman.He may turn out to be a bad Englishman, a traitor to his
adopted country; he may even hanker after his old life as a
Frenchman--but he has left one kingdom for another, and, good, bad, or
indifferent, he is a subject of his new King; he is a son of his
adopted country.He cannot belong to two kingdoms, serve under two
kings, live under two sets of laws, at the same time.He has been "adopted" into a new kingdom.He is a subject of "the Kingdom of Heaven".But he cannot belong to
two kingdoms at the same time.His "death unto sin" involves a "new
birth (regeneration) unto righteousness".He ceases to be a member of
the old kingdom, to serve under the sway of the old king, to be a
"child of wrath".He renounces all allegiance to Satan; he becomes
God's own child by "adoption".He may be a good, bad, or indifferent
child; he may be a lost child, but he does not cease to be God's child.Rather, it is just because he is still God's child that there is hope
for him.It is because he is {78} the child of God by adoption that
the "spirit of adoption" within him can still cry, "Abba, Father," that
he can still claim the privilege of his adopted country, and "pardon
through the Precious Blood".True, he has obligations and
responsibilities, as well as privileges, and these we shall see under
the next word, Election.The Catechism calls the Baptized "the elect people of God," and the
Baptismal Service asks that the child may by Baptism be "taken into the
number of God's elect children".The word itself
comes from two Latin words, _e_, or _ex_, out; and _lego_, to choose.The "elect," then, are those chosen out from others.It sounds like
favouritism; it reads like "privileged classes"--and so it is.But the
privilege of election is the privilege of service.It is like the
privilege of a Member of Parliament, the favoured candidate--the
privilege of being elected to serve others.Every election is for the
sake of somebody else.The Member of Parliament is elected for the
sake of his constituents; the Town Councillor is elected for the sake
of his fellow-townsmen; the Governor is elected for the sake of the
{79} governed.The Jews were
"elect"; but it was for the sake of the Gentiles--"that the Gentiles,
through them, might be brought in".The Blessed Virgin was "elect";
but it was that "all generations might call her blessed".The Church
is "elect," but it is for the sake of the world,--that it, too, might
be "brought in".The Baptized are
"elect," but not for their own sakes; not to be a privileged class,
save to enjoy the privilege of bringing others in.They are "chosen
out" of the world for the sake of those left in the world.This is
their obligation; it is the law of their adopted country, the kingdom
into which they have, "by spiritual regeneration," been "born again".All this, and much more, Baptism does.How Baptism
causes all that it effects, is as yet unrevealed.The Holy Ghost moves
upon the face of the waters, but His operation is overshadowed.Here,
we are in the realm of faith.Faith is belief in that which is out of
{80} sight.It is belief in the unseen, not in the non-existent.We
hope for that we see not.[18]  The _mode_ of the operation of the Holy
Ghost in Baptism is hidden: the result alone is revealed.In this, as
in many another mystery, "We wait for light".[19]



[1] See Service for the "Private Baptism of Children".[2] Service for the Ordination of Deacons.[3] From an old word, Gossip or _Godsib_, i.e.[5] _Trine_ Immersion, i.e.dipping the candidate thrice, or thrice
pouring water upon him, dates from the earliest ages, but exceptional
cases have occurred where a single immersion has been held valid.[6] From _Chrisma_, sacred oil--first the oil with which a child was
anointed at Baptism, and then the robe with which the child was covered
after Baptism and Unction, and hence the child itself was called a
_Chrisome-child_, i.e.[7] In the 1549 Prayer Book, the Prayer at the Anointing in the
Baptismal Service ran: "Almighty God, Who hath regenerated thee by
water and the Holy Ghost, and hath given unto thee the remission of all
thy sins, He vouchsafe to anoint thee with the Unction of His Holy
Spirit, and bring thee to the inheritance of everlasting life.Jerome, writing in the second century, says of the Baptized,
that he "bore on his forehead the banner of the Cross".[10] It is a real loss to use the Service for the Public Baptism of
Infants as a private office, as is generally done now.The doctrinal
teaching; the naming of the child; the signing with the cross; the
response of, and the address to, the God-parents--all these would be
helpful reminders to a congregation, if the service sometimes came, as
the Rubric orders, after the second lesson, and might rekindle the
Baptismal and Confirmation fire once lighted, but so often allowed to
die down, or flicker out.[14] Not more, it is estimated, than two or three out of every eight
have been baptized.[15] I may take an _additional_ Christian name at my Confirmation, but
I cannot change the old one.[16] The present Town Clerk of London has kindly informed me that the
earliest example he has found dates from 1418, when the name of John
Carpenter, Town Clerk, the well-known executor of Whittington, is
appended to a document, the Christian name being omitted.Ambrose Lee of the Heralds' College
may interest some."... Surname, in the ordinary sense of the word,
the King has none.He--as was his grandmother, Queen Victoria, as well
as her husband, Prince Albert--is descended from Witikind, who was the
last of a long line of continental Saxon kings or rulers.Witikind was
defeated by Charlemagne, became a Christian, and was created Duke of
Saxony.He had a second son, who was Count of Wettin, but clear and
well-defined and authenticated genealogies do not exist from which may
be formulated any theory establishing, by right or custom, _any_
surname, in the ordinary accepted sense of the word, for the various
families who are descended in the male line from this Count of
Wettin....  And, by-the-by, it must not be forgotten that the earliest
Guelphs were merely princes whose baptismal name was Guelph, as the
baptismal name of our Hanoverian Kings was George."The Blessed Sacrament!--or, as the Prayer Book calls it, "The Holy
Sacrament".This title seems to sum up all the other titles by which
the chief service in the Church is known.For
instance:--

_The Liturgy_, from the Greek _Leitourgia_,[1] a public service._The Mass_, from the Latin _Missa_, dismissal--the word used in the
Latin Liturgy when the people are dismissed,[2] and afterwards applied
to the service itself from which they are dismissed._The Eucharist_, from the Greek _Eucharistia_, thanksgiving--the word
used in all the narratives {82} of Institution,[3] and, technically,
the third part of the Eucharistic Service._The Breaking of the Bread_, one of the earliest names for the
Sacrament (Acts ii._The Holy Sacrifice_, which Christ once offered, and is ever offering._The Lord's Supper_ (1 Cor.10), a name perhaps originally used
for the _Agape_, or love feast, which preceded the Eucharist, and then
given to the Eucharist itself.It is an old English name, used in the
story of St.Anselm's last days, where it is said: "He passed away as
morning was breaking on the Wednesday before _the day of our Lord's
Supper_"._The Holy Communion_ (1 Cor.16), in which our baptismal union with
Christ is consummated, and which forms a means of union between souls
in the Church Triumphant, at Rest, and on Earth.In it, Christ, God
and Man, is the bond of oneness.All these, and other aspects of the Sacrament, are comprehended and
gathered up in the name which marks its supremacy,--The Blessed
Sacrament.{83}

Consider: What it is;
          What it does;
          How it does it.It is the supernatural conjunction of matter and spirit, of Bread and
Wine and of the Holy Ghost.Here, as in Baptism, the "inward and
spiritual" expresses itself through the "outward and visible".This conjunction is not a
_physical_ conjunction, according to physical laws; nor is it a
spiritual conjunction, according to spiritual laws; it is a Sacramental
conjunction, according to Sacramental laws.As in Baptism, so in the
Blessed Sacrament: the "outward and visible" is, and remains, subject
to natural laws, and the inward and spiritual to spiritual laws; but
the Sacrament itself is under neither natural nor spiritual but
Sacramental laws.For a perfect Sacrament requires both matter and spirit.[4]  If either
is absent, the Sacrament is incomplete.Thus, the Council of Trent's definition of {84} _Transubstantiation_[5]
seems, as it stands, to spoil the very nature of a Sacrament.It is
the "change of the whole substance of the bread into the Body, of the
whole substance of the wine into the blood of Christ, _only the
appearance_ of bread and wine remaining".Again, the Lutheran doctrine of Consubstantiation destroys the nature
of the Sacrament.The Lutheran _Formula Concordiae_, e.g., teaches
that "_outside the use the Body of Christ is not present_".Thus it
limits the Presence to the reception, whether by good or bad.The _Figurative_ view of the Blessed Sacrament {85} destroys the nature
of a Sacrament, making the matter symbolize something which is not
there.It is safer to take the words of consecration as they stand,
corresponding as they do so literally with the words of Institution,
and simply to say: "This (bread: it is still bread) is My Body" (it is
far more than bread); "this (wine: it is still wine) is My Blood" (it
is far more than wine).Can we get beyond this, in terms and
definitions?Can we say more than that it is a "Sacrament"--The
Blessed Sacrament?And after all, do we wish to do so?Briefly, the Blessed Sacrament does two things; It pleads, and It
feeds.It is the pleading _of_ the one Sacrifice; It is the feeding
_on_ the one Sacrifice.These two aspects of the one Sacrament are suggested in the two names,
_Altar_ and _Table_.In Western
Liturgies, _Altar_ is the rule, and _Table_ the exception; in Eastern
Liturgies, _Table_ is the rule, and _Altar_ {86} the exception.Both
are, perhaps, embodied in the old name, _God's Board_, of Thomas
Aquinas.This, for over 300 years, was the common name for what St.Irenaeus
calls "the Abode of the Holy Body and Blood of Christ".Convocation,
in 1640, decreed: "It is, and may be called, an Altar in that sense in
which the Primitive Church called it an Altar, and in no other".This
sense referred to the offering of what the Liturgy of St.James calls
"the tremendous and unbloody Sacrifice," the Liturgy of St.Chrysostom
"the reasonable and unbloody Sacrifice,"[7] and the Ancient English
Liturgy "a pure offering, an holy offering, an undefiled offering, even
the holy Bread of eternal Life, and the Cup of everlasting Salvation ".The word Altar, then, tells of the pleading of the Sacrifice of Jesus
Christ.In the words of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to Leo
XIII: "We plead and represent before the Father the Sacrifice of the
Cross"; or in the words of Charles Wesley: "To God it is an {87} Altar
whereon men mystically present unto Him the same Sacrifice, as still
suing for mercy"; or, in the words of Isaac Barrow: "Our Lord hath
offered a well-pleasing Sacrifice for our sins, and doth, at God's
right hand, continually renew it by presenting it unto God, and
interceding with Him for the effect thereof".The Sacrifice does not, of course, consist in the re-slaying of the
Lamb, but in the offering of the Lamb as it had been slain.It is not
the repetition of the Atonement, but the representation of the
Atonement.[8]  We offer on the earthly Altar the same Sacrifice that is
being perpetually offered on the Heavenly Altar.There is only one
Altar, only one Sacrifice, one Eucharist--"one offering, single and
complete".All the combined earthly Altars are but one Altar--the
earthly or visible part of the Heavenly Altar on which He, both Priest
and Victim, offers Himself as the Lamb "as it had been slain".The
Heavenly Altar is, as it were, the centre, and all the earthly Altars
the circumference.We gaze at the Heavenly Altar through the Earthly
Altars.We plead what He pleads; we offer what He offers.{88}

  Thus the Church, with exultation,
  Till her Lord returns again,
  Shows His Death; His mediation
  Validates her worship then,
  Pleading the Divine Oblation
  Offered on the Cross for men.And we must remember that in this offering the whole Three Persons in
the Blessed Trinity are at work.We must not in our worship so
concentrate our attention upon the Second Person, as to exclude the
other Persons from our thoughts.Indeed, if one Person is more
prominent than another, it is God the Father.It is to God the Father
that the Sacrifice ascends; it is with Him that we plead on earth that
which God the Son is pleading in Heaven; it is God the Holy Ghost Who
makes our pleadings possible, Who turns the many Jewish Altars into the
one Christian Altar.The _Gloria in Excelsis_ bids us render worship
to all three Persons engaged in this single act.The second aspect under consideration is suggested by the word
_Table_--the "Holy Table," as St.Athanasius
call it; "the tremendous Table," or the "Mystic {89} Table," as St.Chrysostom calls it; "the Lord's Table," or "this Thy Table," as,
following the Easterns, our Prayer Book calls it.This term emphasizes the Feast-aspect, as "Altar" underlines the
Sacrificial aspect, of the Sacrament.In the "Lord's Supper" we feast
upon the Sacrifice which has already been offered upon the Altar."This Thy Table," tells of the Banquet of the Lamb.Thomas puts
it:--

  He gave Himself in either kind,
  His precious Flesh, His precious Blood:
  In Love's own fullness thus designed
  Of the whole man to be the Food.Doddridge puts it, in his Sacramental Ave:--

  Hail!Thrice happy he, who here partakes
    That Sacred Stream, that Heavenly Food.This is the Prayer-Book aspect, which deals with the "_Administration_
of the Lord's Supper"; which bids us "feed upon Him (not it) in our
hearts by faith," and not by sight; which speaks of the elements as
God's "creatures of Bread and Wine"; which prays, in language of awful
solemnity, that we may worthily "eat His Flesh {90} and drink His
Blood".This is the aspect which speaks of the "means whereby" Christ
communicates Himself to us, implants within us His character, His
virtues, His will;--makes us one with Him, and Himself one with us.By
Sacramental Communion, we "dwell in Him, and He in us"; and this, not
merely as a lovely sentiment, or by means of some beautiful meditation,
but by the real communion of Christ--present without us, and
communicated to us, through the ordained channels.Hence, in the Blessed Sacrament, Jesus is for ever counteracting within
us the effects of the Fall.If the first Adam ruined us through food,
the second Adam will reinstate us through food--and that food nothing
less than Himself.The Holy Ghost is the operative power, but
the operation is overshadowed as by the wings of the Dove.It is
enough for us to know what is done, without questioning as to how it is
done.It is enough for us to worship Him in what He does, without {91}
straining to know how He does it--being fully persuaded that, what He
has promised, He is able also to perform.[9]  Here, again, we are in
the region of faith, not sight; and reason tells us that faith must be
supreme in its own province.For us, it is enough to say with Queen
Elizabeth:--

  _He was the Word that spake it;_
  _He took the bread and break it;_
  _And what that Word did make it,_
  _I do believe and take it._[10]



[1] _Leitos_, public, _ergon_, work.[2] Either when the service is over, or when those not admissible to
Communion are dismissed.The "Masses" condemned in the thirty-first
Article involved the heresy that Christ was therein offered again by
the Mass Priest to buy souls out of Purgatory at so much per Mass."He took the cup, and eucharized," i.e.[4] _Accedit verium ad elementum, et fit Sacramentum_ (St.[5] This definition is really given up now by the best Roman Catholic
theologians.The theory on which Transubstantiation alone is based
(viz.that "substance" is something which exists apart from the
totality of the accidents whereby it is known to us), has now been
generally abandoned.Now, it is universally allowed that "substance is
only a collective name for the sum of all the qualities of matter,
size, colour, weight, taste, and so forth".But, as all these
qualities of bread and wine admittedly remain after consecration, the
substance of the bread and wine must remain too.The doctrine of Transubstantiation condemned in Article 22, was that of
a material Transubstantiation which taught (and was taught _ex
Cathedra_ by Pope Nicholas II) that Christ's Body was sensibly touched
and broken by the teeth.[6] "The Altar has respect unto the oblation, the Table to the
participation" (Bishop Cosin).[10] "These lines," says Malcolm MacColl in his book on "The
Reformation Settlement" (p.34), "have sometimes been attributed to
Donne; but the balance of evidence is in favour of their Elizabethan
authorship when the Queen was in confinement as Princess Elizabeth.They are not in the first edition of Donne, and were published for the
first time as his in 1634, thirteen years after his death."These are "those five" which the Article says are "commonly called
Sacraments":[1] Confirmation, Matrimony, Orders, Penance, Unction.They are called "Lesser" Sacraments to distinguish them from the two
pre-eminent or "Greater Sacraments," Baptism and the Supper of the
Lord.[2]  These, though they have not all a "like nature" with the
Greater Sacraments, are selected by the Church as meeting the main
needs of her children between Baptism and Burial.They may, for our purpose, be classified in three groups:--

(I) _The Sacrament of Completion_ (Confirmation, which completes the
Sacrament of Baptism).{93}

(II) The Sacraments of Perpetuation (Holy Matrimony, which perpetuates
the human race; and Holy Order, which perpetuates the Christian
Ministry).(III) The Sacraments of Recovery (Penance, which recovers the sick soul
together with the body; and Unction, which recovers the sick body
together with the soul).And, first, The Sacrament of Completion: Confirmation.[2] The Homily on the Sacraments calls them the "other
Sacraments"--i.e.in addition to Baptism and the Eucharist.The renewal of vows is the
final part of the _preparation_ for Confirmation.It is that part of
the preparation which takes place in public, as the previous
preparation has taken place in private.Before Confirmation, the
Baptismal vows are renewed "openly before the Church".Their renewal
is the last word of preparation.The Bishop, or Chief Shepherd,
assures himself by question, and answer, that the Candidate openly
responds to the preparation he has received in {95} private from the
Parish Priest, or under-Shepherd.Before the last revision of the
Prayer Book, the Bishop asked the Candidates in public many questions
from the Catechism before confirming them; now he only asks one--and
the "I do," by which the Candidate renews his Baptismal vows, is the
answer to that preparatory question.It is still quite a common idea, even among Church people, that
Confirmation is something which the Candidate does for himself, instead
of something which God does to him.This is often due to the
unfortunate use of the word "confirm"[1] in the Bishop's question.At
the time it was inserted, the word "confirm" meant "confess,"[2] and
referred, not to the Gift of Confirmation, but to the Candidate's
public Confession of faith, before receiving the Sacrament of
Confirmation.It had nothing whatever to do with Confirmation itself.We must not, then, confuse the preparation for Confirmation with the
Gift of Confirmation.The Sacrament itself is God's gift to the child
bestowed through the Bishop in accordance with the teaching given to
{96} the God-parents at the child's Baptism: "Ye are to take care that
this child be brought to the Bishop _to be_ confirmed _by him_".[3]

And this leads us to our second point: What Confirmation is.In the words of our Confirmation Service, it "increases and
multiplies"--i.e.strengthens or confirms Baptismal grace.It is the
ordained channel which conveys to the Baptized the "sevenfold" (i.e.complete) gift of the Holy Ghost, which was initially received in
Baptism.And this will help us to answer a question frequently asked: "If I have
been confirmed, but not Baptized, must I be Baptized?"Surely, Baptism
must _precede_ Confirmation.If {97} Confirmation increases the grace
given in Baptism, that grace must have been received before it can be
increased."And must I be 'confirmed again,' as it is said, after
Baptism?"If I had not been Baptized _before_ I presented
myself for Confirmation, I have not confirmed at all.My Baptism will
now allow me to "be presented to the Bishop once again to be confirmed
by him"--and this time in reality."Did I, then, receive no grace when
I was presented to the Bishop to be confirmed by him before?"Much
grace, surely, but not the special grace attached to the special
Sacrament of Confirmation, and guaranteed to the Confirmed.God's love overflows its channels; what
God gives, or withholds, outside those channels, it would be an
impertinence for us to say.Again, Confirmation is, in a secondary sense, a Sacrament of
Admittance.It admits the Baptized to Holy Communion."It is expedient," says the rubric after an adult Baptism,
"that every person thus Baptized should be confirmed by the Bishop so
soon after his Baptism as conveniently may be; that _so he may be
admitted to the Holy Communion_.""And {98} there shall none _be
admitted to Holy Communion_," adds the rubric after Confirmation,
"until such time as he be confirmed, or be ready and desirous to be
confirmed."For "Confirmation, or the laying on of hands," fully
admits the Baptized to that "Royal Priesthood" of the Laity,[4] of
which the specially ordained Priest is ordained to be the
representative.The Holy Sacrifice is the offering of the _whole_
Church, the universal Priesthood, not merely of the individual Priest
who is the offerer.Thus, the Confirmed can take their part in the
offering, and can assist at it, in union with the ordained Priest who
is actually celebrating.They can say their _Amen_ at the Eucharist,
or "giving of thanks," and give their responding assent to what he is
doing in their name, and on their behalf."If I am a Communicant, but have
not been confirmed, ought I to present myself for Confirmation?"First, it
legislates for the normal case, then for the abnormal.First it says:
"None shall be admitted to Holy Communion until such time as they have
been Confirmed".Then it deals with {99} exceptional cases, and adds,
"or be willing and desirous to be confirmed".Such exceptional cases
may, and do, occur; but even these may not be Communicated unless they
are both "ready" and "desirous" to be confirmed, as soon as
Confirmation can be received.So does the Church safeguard her
Sacraments, and her children."But would you," it is asked, "exclude a Dissenter from Communion,
however good and holy he may be, merely because he has not been
Confirmed?"He certainly would have very little respect for me if I
did not.If, for instance, he belonged to the Methodist Society, he
would assuredly not admit me to be a "Communicant" in that Society."No person," says his rule, "shall be suffered on any pretence to
partake of the Lord's Supper _unless he be a member of the Society_, or
receive a note of admission from the Superintendent, which note must be
renewed quarterly."And, again: "That the Table of the Lord should be
open to all comers, is surely a great discredit, and a serious peril to
any Church".[5]  And yet the Church, the Divine Society, established by
Jesus Christ Himself, is blamed, and called narrow and {100} bigoted,
if she asserts her own rule, and refuses to admit "all comers" to the
Altar.To give way on such a point would be to forfeit, and rightly to
forfeit, the respect of any law-abiding people, and would be--in many
cases, is--"a great discredit, and a serious peril" to the Church.We
have few enough rules as it is, and if those that we have are
meaningless, we may well be held up to derision.The Prayer Book makes
no provision whatever for those who are not Confirmed, and who, if able
to receive Confirmation, are neither "ready nor desirous to be
Confirmed".Confirmation is for the Baptized, and none other.The Prayer-Book
Title to the service is plain.It calls Confirmation the "laying on of
Hands upon _those that are baptized_," and, it adds, "are come to years
of discretion".First, then, Confirmation is for the Baptized, and never for the
unbaptized.Secondly, it is (as now administered[6]) for {101} "those who have come
to years of discretion," i.e.As we pray
in the Ember Collect that the Bishop may select "fit persons for the
Sacred Ministry" of the special Priesthood, and may "lay hands suddenly
on no man," so it is with Confirmation or the "laying on of hands" for
the Royal Priesthood.The Bishop must be assured by the Priest who
presents them (and who acts as his examining Chaplain), that they are
"fit persons" to be confirmed.And this fitness must be of two kinds: moral and intellectual.The candidate must "have come to years of discretion,"
i.e.he must "know to refuse the evil and choose the good".[7]  This
"age of discretion," or _competent age_, as the Catechism Rubric calls
it, is not a question of years, but of character.Our present Prayer
Book makes no allusion to any definite span of years whatever, and to
make the magic age of fifteen the minimum universal age for Candidates
is wholly illegal.At the Reformation, the English Church fixed seven
as the age for Confirmation, but our 1662 Prayer Book is more
primitive, and, taking a common-sense view, {102} leaves each case of
moral fitness to be decided on its own merits.The moral standard must
be an individual standard, and must be left, first, to the parent, who
presents the child to the Priest to be prepared; then, to the Priest
who prepares the child for Confirmation, and presents him to the
Bishop; and, lastly, to the Bishop, who must finally decide, upon the
combined testimony of the Priest and parent--and, if in doubt, upon his
own personal examination.The _intellectual_ standard is laid down in the Service for the "Public
Baptism of Infants": "So soon as he can say the Creed, the Lord's
Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, in the vulgar (i.e.his native)
tongue, and be further instructed, etc."Here, the words "can say"
obviously mean can say _intelligently_.The mere saying of the words
by rote is comparatively unimportant, though it has its use; but if
this were all, it would degrade the Candidate's intellectual status to
the capacities of a parrot.But, "as soon as" he can intelligently
comply with the Church's requirements, as soon as he has reached "a
competent age," any child may "be presented to the Bishop to be
confirmed by him".{103}

And, in the majority of cases, in these days, "the sooner, the better".It is, speaking generally, far safer to have the "child" prepared at
home--if it is a Christian home--and confirmed from home, than to risk
the preparation to the chance teaching of a Public School.With
splendid exceptions, School Confirmation is apt to get confused with
the school curriculum and school lessons.It is a sort of "extra
tuition," which, not infrequently, interferes with games or work,
without any compensating advantages in Church teaching.(IV) WHAT IS ESSENTIAL."The Laying on of Hands"--and nothing else.This act of ritual (so
familiar to the Early Church, from Christ's act in blessing little
children) was used by the Apostles,[8] and is still used by their
successors, the Bishops.It is the only act essential to a valid
Confirmation.Other, and suggestive, ceremonies have been in use in different ages,
and in different parts of the Church: but they are supplementary, not
essential.Thus, in the sub-apostolic age, ritual {104} acts expressed
very beautifully the early names for Confirmation, just as "the laying
on of Hands" still expresses the name which in the English Church
proclaims the essence of the Sacrament.For instance, Confirmation is called _The Anointing_,[9] and _The
Sealing_, and in some parts of the Church, the Priest dips his finger
in oil blessed by the Bishop, and signs or seals the child upon the
forehead with the sign of the Cross, thus symbolizing the meaning of
such names.But neither the sealing, nor the anointing, is necessary
for a valid Sacrament.Confirmation, then, "rightly and duly" administered, completes the
grace given to a child at the outset of its Christian career.It
admits the child to full membership and to full privileges in the
Christian Church.It is the ordained Channel by which the Bishop is
commissioned to convey and guarantee the special grace attached {105}
to, and only to, the Lesser Sacrament of Confirmation.[10]



[1] "Ratifying and _confirming_ the same in your own persons."[2] The word was "confess" in 1549.[3] The Greek Catechism of Plato, Metropolitan of Moscow, puts it very
clearly: "Through this holy Ordinance _the Holy Ghost descendeth upon
the person Baptized_, and confirmeth him in the grace which he received
in his Baptism according to the example of His descending upon the
disciples of Jesus Christ, and in imitation of the disciples
themselves, who after Baptism laid their hands upon the believers; by
which laying on of hands the Holy Ghost was conferred".[5] Minutes of Wesleyan Conference, 1889, p.[6] In the first ages, and, indeed, until the fifteenth century,
Confirmation followed immediately after Baptism, both in East and West,
as it still does in the East.[9] In an old seventh century Service, used in the Church of England
down to the Reformation, the Priest is directed: "Here he is to put the
Chrism (oil) on the forehead of the man, and say, 'Receive the sign of
the Holy Cross, by the Chrism of Salvation in Jesus Christ unto Eternal
Life.[10] The teaching of our Church of England, passing on the teaching of
the Church Universal, is very happily summed up in an ancient Homily of
the Church of England.It runs thus: "In Baptism the Christian was
born again spiritually, to live; in Confirmation he is made bold to
fight.There he received remission of sin; here he receiveth increase
of grace....  In Baptism he was chosen to be God's son; in Confirmation
God shall give him His Holy Spirit to... perfect him.In Baptism he
was called and chosen to be one of God's soldiers, and had his white
coat of innocency given him, and also his badge, which was the red
cross set upon his forehead...; in Confirmation he is encouraged to
fight, and to take the armour of God put upon him, which be able to
bear off the fiery darts of the devil."We have called Holy Matrimony the "_Sacrament of Perpetuation_," for it
is the ordained way in which the human race is to be perpetuated.Matrimony is the legal union between two persons,--a union which is
created by mutual consent: Holy Matrimony is that union sanctioned and
sanctified by the Church.There are three familiar names given to this union: Matrimony,
Marriage, Wedlock.Matrimony, derived from _mater_, a mother, tells of the woman's (i.e.wife-man's) "joy that a man is born into the world".Marriage, derived
from _maritus_, a husband (or house-dweller[1]), tells of the man's
place in the "hus" or house.Wedlock, derived from _weddian_, a
pledge, reminds both man and woman of the life-long pledge which each
has made "either to other".{107}

It is this Sacrament of Matrimony, Marriage, or Wedlock, that we are
now to consider.We will think of it under four headings:--

  (I) What is it for?Marriage is, as we have seen, God's method of propagating the human
race.It does this in two ways--by expansion, and by limitation.This
is seen in the New Testament ordinance, "one man for one woman".It
expands the race, but within due and disciplined limitations.Expansion, without limitation, would produce quantity without quality,
and would wreck the human race; limitation without expansion might
produce quality without quantity, but would extinguish the human race.Like every other gift of God, marriage is to be treated "soberly,
wisely, discretely," and, like every other gift, it must be used with a
due combination of freedom and restraint.Hence, among other reasons, the marriage union between one man and one
woman is {108} indissoluble.For marriage is not a mere union of
sentiment; it is not a mere terminable contract between two persons,
who have agreed to live together as long as they suit each other.It
is an _organic_ not an emotional union; "They twain shall be one
flesh," which nothing but death can divide.No law in Church or State
can unmarry the legally married.A State may _declare_ the
non-existence of the marriage union, just as it may _declare_ the
non-existence of God: but such a declaration does not affect the fact,
either in one case or the other.In England the State does, in certain cases, declare that the life-long
union is a temporary contract, and does permit "this man" or "this
woman" to live with another man, or with another woman, and, if they
choose, even to exchange husbands or wives.This is allowed by the
Divorce Act of 1857,[2] "when," writes Bishop Stubbs, "the calamitous
legislation of 1857 inflicted on English Society and English morals
{109} the most cruel blow that any conjunction of unrighteous influence
could possibly have contrived".[3]

The Church has made no such declaration.It rigidly forbids a husband
or wife to marry again during the lifetime of either party.The Law of
the Church remains the Law of the Church, overridden--but not repealed.This has led to a conflict between Church and State in a country where
they are, in theory though not in fact, united.But this is the fault
of the State, not of the Church.It is a case in which a junior
partner has acted without the consent of, or rather in direct
opposition to, the senior partner.Historically and chronologically
speaking, the Church (the senior partner) took the State (the junior
partner) into partnership, and the State, in spite of all the benefits
it has received from the Church, has taken all it could get, and has
thrown the Church over to legalize sin.It has ignored its senior
partner, and loosened the old historical bond between the two.This
the Church cannot help, and this the State fully admits, legally
absolving the Church from taking any part in its mock re-marriages.{110}

(II) WHAT IS ITS ESSENCE?The essence of matrimony is "mutual consent".The essential part of
the Sacrament consists in the words: "I, M., take thee, N.," etc.Nothing else is essential, though much else is desirable.Thus,
marriage in a church, however historical and desirable, is not
_essential_ to the validity of a marriage.Marriage at a Registry
Office (i.e.mutual consent in the presence of the Registrar) is every
bit as legally indissoluble as marriage in a church.The not uncommon
argument: "I was only married in a Registry Office, and can therefore
take advantage of the Divorce Act," is fallacious _ab initio_.[4]

Why, then, be married in, and by the Church?Apart from the history
and sentiment, for this reason.The Church is the ordained channel
through which grace to keep the marriage vow is bestowed.A special
and _guaranteed_ grace is {111} attached to a marriage sanctioned and
blest by the Church.The Church, in the name of God, "consecrates
matrimony," and from the earliest times has given its sanction and
blessing to the mutual consent.We are reminded of this in the
question: "Who _giveth_ this woman to be married to this man?"In
answer to the question, the Parent, or Guardian, presents the Bride to
the Priest (the Church's representative), who, in turn, presents her to
the Bridegroom, and blesses their union.In the Primitive Church,
notice of marriage had to be given to the Bishop of the Diocese, or his
representative,[5] in order that due inquiries might be made as to the
fitness of the persons, and the Church's sanction given or withheld.After this notice, a special service of _Betrothal_ (as well as the
actual marriage service) was solemnized.These two separate services are still marked off from each other in
(though both forming a part of) our present marriage service.The
first part of the service is held outside the chancel gates, and
corresponds to the old service of _Betrothal_.Here, too, the actual
ceremony of "mutual consent" now takes place--that part of {112} the
ceremony which would be equally valid in a Registry Office.Then
follows the second part of the service, in which the Church gives her
blessing upon the marriage.And because this part is, properly
speaking, part of the Eucharistic Office, the Bride and Bridegroom now
go to the Altar with the Priest, and there receive the Church's
Benediction, and--ideally--their first Communion after marriage.So
does the Church provide grace for her children that they may "perform
the vows they have made unto the King".The late hour for modern
weddings, and the consequent postponement[6] of Communion, has obscured
much of the meaning of the service; but a nine o'clock wedding, in
which the married couple receive the Holy Communion, followed by the
wedding breakfast, is, happily, becoming more common, and is restoring
to us one of the best of old English customs.It is easy enough to
slight old religious forms and ceremonies; but is anyone one atom
better, or happier for having neglected them?{113}

(III) WHOM IS IT FOR?Marriage is for three classes:--

(1) The unmarried--i.e.those who have never been married, or whose
marriage is (legally) dissolved by death.(2) The non-related--i.e.either by consanguinity (by blood), or
affinity (by marriage).But, is not this very
hard upon those whose marriage has been a mistake, and who have been
divorced by the State?And, above all, is it not very hard upon the
innocent party, who has been granted a divorce?It is very hard, so
hard, so terribly hard, that only those who have to deal personally,
and practically, with concrete cases, can guess how hard--hard enough
often on the guilty party, and harder still on the innocent."God
knows" it is hard, and will make it as easy as God Himself can make it,
if only self-surrender is placed before self-indulgence.We sometimes forget that legislation for
the individual may bear even harder {114} on the masses, than
legislation for the masses may bear upon the individual.And, after
all, this is not a question of "hard _versus_ easy," but of "right
_versus_ wrong".Moreover, as we are finding out, that which seems
easiest at the moment, often turns out hardest in the long run.It is
no longer contended that re-marriage after a State-divorce is that
universal Elysium which it has always been confidently assumed to be.There is, too, a positively absurd side to the present conflict between
Church and State.Some time ago, a young
girl married a man about whom she knew next to nothing, the man telling
her that marriage was only a temporary affair, and that, if it did not
answer, the State would divorce them.Wrong-doing
ensued, and a divorce was obtained.Then the girl entered into a
State-marriage with another man.A
divorce was again applied for, but this time was refused.Eventually,
the girl left her State-made husband, and ran away with her real
husband.In other words, she eloped with her own husband.But what is
her position to-day?In the eyes of the State, she is now living with
a man who is not {115} her husband.Her State-husband is still alive,
and can apply, at any moment, for an order for the restitution of
conjugal rights--however unlikely he is to get it.Further, if in the
future she has any children by her real husband (unless she has been
married again to him, after divorce from her State-husband) these
children will be illegitimate.This is the sort of muddle the Divorce
Act has got us into.One course, and only one course, is open to the
Church--to disentangle itself from all question of extending the powers
of the Act on grounds of inequality, or any other real (and sometimes
very real) or fancied hardship, and to consistently fight for the
repeal of the Act.This, it will be said, is _Utopian_.It
is the business of the Church to aim at the Utopian.Her whole history
shows that she is safest, as well as most successful, when aiming at
what the world derides.One question remains: Is not the present Divorce Law "one law for the
rich and another for the poor"?This is its sole
merit, if merit it can have.It does, at least, partially protect the
poor from sin-made-easy--a condition which money has bought for the
rich.If the State abrogated the Sixth {116} Commandment for the rich,
and made it lawful for a rich man to commit murder, it would at least
be no demerit if it refused to extend the permit to the poor.But, secondly, marriage is for the non-related--non-related, that is,
in two ways, by Consanguinity, and Affinity.(_a_) By _Consanguinity_.Consanguinity is of two kinds, lineal and
collateral._Lineal_ Consanguinity[7] is blood relationship "in a
_direct_ line," i.e._Collateral_
Consanguinity is blood relationship from a common ancestor, but not in
a direct line.The law of Consanguinity has not, at the present moment, been attacked,
and is still the law of the land.Affinity[8] is near relationship by marriage.It
is of three kinds: (1) _Direct_, i.e.between a husband and his wife's
blood relations, and between a wife and her husband's blood relations;
(2) _Secondary_, i.e.between a husband {117} and his wife's relations
by marriage; (3) _Collateral_, i.e.between a husband and the relations
of his wife's relations.In case of Affinity, the State has broken
faith with the Church without scruple, and the _Deceased Wife's Sister
Bill_[9] is the result.So has it

  brought confusion to the Table round.The question is sometimes asked, whether the State can alter the
Church's law without her consent.An affirmative answer would reduce
whatever union still remains between them to its lowest possible term,
and would place the Church in a position which no Nonconformist body
would tolerate for a day.The further question, as to whether the
State can order the Church to Communicate persons who have openly and
deliberately broken her laws, needs no discussion.No thinking person
seriously contends that it can.(3) _For the Full-Aged_.No boy under 14, and no girl under 12, can contract a legal marriage
either with, or without the consent of Parents or Guardians.No man
{118} or woman under 21 can do so against the consent of Parents or
Guardians.(IV) WHAT ARE ITS SAFEGUARDS?These are, mainly, two: _Banns_ and _Licences_--both intended to secure
the best safeguard of all, _publicity_.This publicity is secured,
first, by Banns.The word is the plural form of _Ban_, "a proclamation".The object of
this proclamation is to "ban" an improper marriage.In the case of marriage after Banns, in order to secure publicity:--

(1) Each party must reside[10] for twenty-one days in the parish where
the Banns are being published.(2) The marriage must be celebrated in one of the two parishes in which
the Banns have been published.{119}

(3) Seven days' previous notice of publication must be given to the
clergy by whom the Banns are to be published--though the clergy may
remit this length of notice if they choose.(4) The Banns must be published on three separate (though not
necessarily successive) Sundays.(5) Before the marriage, a certificate of publication must be presented
to the officiating clergyman, from the clergyman of the other parish in
which the Banns were published.(6) Banns only hold good for three months.After this period, they
must be again published three times before the marriage can take place.(7) Banns may be forbidden on four grounds: If either party is married
already; or is related by consanguinity or affinity; or is under age;
or is insane.(8) Banns published in false names invalidate a marriage, if both
parties are cognisant of the fact before the marriage takes place, i.e.if they wilfully intend to defeat the law, but not otherwise.There are two kinds of Marriage Licence, an Ordinary, or Common
Licence, and a Special Licence.{120}

An _Ordinary Licence_, costing about L2, is granted by the Bishop, or
Ordinary, in lieu of Banns, either through his Chancellor, or a
"Surrogate," i.e.In marriage by Licence, three points may
be noticed:--

(1) One (though only one) of the parties must reside in the parish
where the marriage is to be celebrated, for fifteen days previous to
the marriage.(2) One of the parties must apply for the Licence in person, not in
writing.(3) A licence only holds good for three months.A _Special Licence_, costing about L30, can only be obtained from the
Archbishop of Canterbury,[11] and is only granted after special and
minute inquiry.The points here to notice are:--

(1) Neither party need reside in the parish where the marriage is to be
solemnized.(2) The marriage may be celebrated in any Church, whether licensed or
unlicensed[12] for marriages.(3) It may be celebrated at any time of the day.It may be added that
if any clergyman {121} celebrates a marriage without either Banns or
Licence (or upon a Registrar's Certificate), he commits a felony, and
is liable to fourteen years' penal servitude.[13]

Other safeguards there are, such as:--

_The Time for Marriages_.--Marriages must not be celebrated before 8
A.M., or after 3 P.M., so as to provide a reasonable chance of
publicity._The Witnesses to a Marriage_.--Two witnesses, at least, must be
present, in addition to the officiating clergyman._The Marriage Registers_.--The officiating clergyman must enter the
marriage in two Registers provided by the State._The Signing of the Registers_.--The bride and bridegroom must sign
their names in the said Registers immediately after the ceremony, as
well as the two witnesses and the officiating clergyman.If either
party wilfully makes any false statement with regard to age, condition,
etc., he or she is guilty of perjury.Such are some of the wise safeguards provided by both Church and State
for the Sacrament of Marriage.Their object is to prevent the {122}
marriage state being entered into "lightly, unadvisedly, or wantonly,"
to secure such publicity as will prevent clandestine marriages,[14] and
will give parents, and others with legal status, an opportunity to
lodge legal objections.Great is the solemnity of the Sacrament in which is "signified and
represented the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and His Church".[1] Husband--from _hus_, a house, and _buan_, to dwell.[2] Until fifty-three years ago an Act of Parliament was necessary for
a divorce.In 1857 _The Matrimonial Causes Act_ established the
Divorce Court.In 1873 the _Indicature Act_ transferred it to a
division of the High Court--the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty
Division.[3] "Visitation Charges," p.[4] It is a common legal error that seven years effective separation
between husband and wife entitles either to remarry, and hundreds of
women who have lost sight of their husbands for seven years innocently
commit bigamy.Probably the mistake comes from the fact that
_prosecution_ for bigamy does not hold good in such a case.But this
does not legalize the bigamous marriage or legitimize the children.[5] The origin of Banns.[6] The Rubric says: "It is convenient that the new-married persons
receive the Holy Communion _at the time of their marriage_, or at the
first opportunity after their marriage," thus retaining, though
releasing, the old rule.[7] Consanguinity--from _cum_, together, and _sanguineus_, relating to
blood.[8] Affinity--from _ad_, near, and _finis_, a boundary.[9] See a most helpful paper read by Father Puller at the E.C.U.Anniversary Meeting, and reported in "The Church Times" of 17 June,
1910.[10] There seems to be no legal definition of the word "reside".The
law would probably require more than leaving a bag in a room, hired for
twenty-one days, as is often done.It must be remembered that the
object of the law is _publicity_--that is, the avoidance of a
clandestine marriage, which marriage at a Registry Office now
frequently makes so fatally easy.[12] Such as, for example, Royal Chapels, St.Paul's Cathedral, Eton
College Chapel, etc.[14] It will be remembered that runaway marriages were, in former days,
frequently celebrated at Gretna Green, a Scotch village in
Dumfriesshire, near the English border.{123}

CHAPTER X.

HOLY ORDER.The Second Sacrament of Perpetuation is Holy Order.As the Sacrament
of Marriage perpetuates the human race, so the Sacrament of Order
perpetuates the Priesthood.Holy Order, indeed, perpetuates the
Sacraments themselves.It is the ordained channel through which the
Sacramental life of the Church is continued.Holy Order, then, was instituted for the perpetuation of those
Sacraments which depend upon Apostolic Succession.It makes it
possible for the Christian laity to be Confirmed, Communicated,
Absolved.Thus, the Christian Ministry is a great deal more than a
body of men, chosen as officers might be chosen in the army or navy.It is the Church's media for the administration of the Sacraments of
Salvation.To say this does not assert that God cannot, and does not,
save and sanctify souls in any other way; but it does assert, as
Scripture does, that the {124} Christian Ministry is the authorized and
ordained way.In this Ministry, there are three orders, or degrees: Bishops, Priests,
and Deacons.In the words of the Prayer Book: "It is evident unto all
men, diligently reading Holy Scripture and ancient Authors, that, from
the Apostles' time, there have been these Orders of Ministers in
Christ's Church; Bishops, Priests, and Deacons".[1]



(I) BISHOPS.Jesus Christ, "the Shepherd and Bishop of
our souls".When, and where, was the first Ordination?In the Upper
Chamber, when He, the Universal Bishop, Himself ordained the first
Apostles.When was {125} the second Ordination?When these Apostles
ordained Matthias to succeed Judas.This was the first link in the
chain of Apostolic Succession.In apostolic days,
Timothy was ordained, with episcopal jurisdiction over Ephesus; Titus,
over Crete; Polycarp (the friend of St.John), over Smyrna; and then,
later on, Linus, over Rome.And so the great College of Bishops
expands until, in the second century, we read in a well-known writer,
St.Irenaeus: "We can reckon up lists of Bishops ordained in the
Churches from the Apostles to our time".Link after link, the chain of
succession lengthens "throughout all the world," until it reaches the
Early British Church, and then, in 597, the English Church, through the
consecration of Augustine,[2] first Archbishop of Canterbury, and in
1903 of Randall Davidson his ninety-fourth successor.And this is the history of every ordination in the Church to-day."It
is through the Apostolic Succession," said the late Bishop Stubbs to
his ordination Candidates, "that I am empowered, through the long line
of mission and Commission {126} from the Upper Chamber at Jerusalem, to
lay my hands upon you and send you."[3]

How does a Priest become a Bishop?In the Church of England he goes
through four stages:--

  (1) He is _nominated_ by the Crown.(2) He is _elected_ by the Church.(3) His election is _confirmed_ by the Archbishop.(4) He is _consecrated_ by the Episcopate.(1) He is _nominated_ by the Crown.This is in accordance with the
immemorial custom of this realm.In these days, the Prime Minister
(representing the people) proposes the name of a Priest to the King,
who accepts or rejects the recommendation.If he accepts it, the King
nominates the selected Priest to the Church for election, and
authorizes the issue of legal documents for such election.This is
called _Conge d'elire_, "leave to elect".(2) He is _elected_ by the Church.The King's {127} nominee now comes
before the Dean and Chapter (representing the Church), and the Church
either elects or rejects him.If the
nominee is elected, what is called his "Confirmation" follows--that
is:--

(3) His election is _confirmed_ by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
according to a right reserved to him by _Magna Charta_.Before
confirming the election, the Archbishop, or his representative, sits in
public, generally at Bow Church, Cheapside, to hear legal objections
from qualified laity against the election.Objections were of late, it
will be remembered, made, and overruled, in the cases of Dr.Then, if duly nominated, elected, and confirmed,--

(4) He is _consecrated_ by the Episcopate.To safeguard the
Succession, three Bishops, at least, are required for the Consecration
of another Bishop, though one would secure a valid Consecration.No
Priest can be Consecrated Bishop under the age of thirty.Very
carefully does the Church safeguard admission to the Episcopate.{128}

_Homage._

After Consecration, the Bishop "does homage,"[4] i.e.he says that he,
like any other subject (ecclesiastic or layman), is the King's
"_homo_".He does homage, not for any
spiritual gift, but for "all the possessions, and profette spirituall
and temporall belongyng to the said...[5]  The
_temporal_ possessions include such things as his house, revenue, etc.But what is meant by doing homage for _spiritual_ possessions?Does
not this admit the claim that the King can, as Queen Elizabeth is
reported to have said, make or unmake a Bishop?Spiritual
_possessions_ do not here mean spiritual _powers_,--powers which can be
conferred by the Episcopate alone.{129} The "spiritual possessions"
for which a Bishop "does homage" refer to fees connected with spiritual
things, such as Episcopal Licences, Institutions to Benefices, Trials
in the Ecclesiastical Court, Visitations--fees, by the way, which, with
very rare exceptions, do not go into the Bishop's own pocket!_Jurisdiction._

What is meant by Episcopal Jurisdiction?Jurisdiction is of two kinds,
_Habitual_ and _Actual_.Habitual Jurisdiction is the Jurisdiction given to a Bishop to exercise
his office in the Church at large.It is conveyed with Consecration,
and is given to the Bishop as a Bishop of the Catholic Church.Thus an
Episcopal act, duly performed, would be valid, however irregular,
outside the Bishop's own Diocese, and in any part of the Church._Actual Jurisdiction_ is this universal Jurisdiction limited to a
particular area, called a Diocese.To this area, a Bishop's right to
exercise his Habitual Jurisdiction is, for purposes of order and
business, confined.The next order in the Ministry is the Priesthood.{130}

(II) PRIESTS.No one can read the Prayer-Book Office for the _Ordering of Priests_
without being struck by its contrast to the ordinary conception of
Priesthood by the average Englishman.The Bishop's words in the
Ordination Service: "Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of
a Priest in the Church of God," must surely mean more than that a
Priest should try to be a good organizer, a good financier, a good
preacher, or good at games--though the better he is at all these, the
better it may be.But the gift of the Holy Ghost for "the Office and
Work of a Priest" must mean more than this.We may consider it in connexion with four familiar English clerical
titles: _Priest, Minister, Parson, Clergyman_._Priest._

According to the Prayer Book, a Priest, or Presbyter, is ordained to do
three things, which he, and he alone, can do: to Absolve, to
Consecrate, to Bless.He, and he alone, can _Absolve_.It is the day of his
Ordination to the Priesthood.He is saying Matins as a Deacon just
_before_ his {131} Ordination, and he is forbidden to pronounce the
Absolution: he is saying Evensong just _after_ his Ordination, and he
is ordered to pronounce the Absolution.He, and he alone, can _Consecrate_.If a Deacon pretends to Consecrate
the Elements at the Blessed Sacrament, not only is his act sacrilege
and invalid, but even by the law of the land he is liable to a penalty
of L100.[6]

He, and he alone, can give the _Blessing_--i.e.The right of Benediction belongs to him as part of his
Ministerial Office.The Blessing pronounced by a Deacon might be the
personal blessing of a good and holy man, just as the blessing of a
layman--a father blessing his child--might be of value as such.In
each case it would be a personal act.But a Priest does not bless in
his own name, but in the name of the Whole Church.It is an official,
not a personal act: he conveys, not his own, but the Church's blessing
to the people.Hence, the valid Ordination of a Priest is of essential importance to
the laity.{132}

But there is another aspect of "the Office and Work of a Priest in the
Church of God".This we see in the word



_Minister._

The Priest not only ministers before God on behalf of his people, but
he ministers to his people on behalf of God.In this aspect of the
Priesthood, he ministers God's gifts to the laity.If, as a Priest, he
pleads the One Sacrifice on behalf of the people, as a Minister he
feeds the people upon the one Sacrifice.His chief ministerial duty is
to minister to the people--to give them Baptism, Absolution, Holy
Communion; to minister to all their spiritual needs whenever, and
wherever, he is needed.It is, surely, a sad necessity that this ministerial "office and work"
should be so often confused with finance, doles, charities, begging
sermons, committees, etc.In all such things he is, indeed, truly
serving and ministering; but he is often obliged to place them in the
wrong order of importance, and so dim the sight of the laity to his
real position, and not infrequently make his spiritual ministrations
unacceptable.A well-known and London-wide respected Priest said {133}
shortly before he died, that he had almost scattered his congregation
by the constant "begging sermons" which he hated, but which necessity
made imperative.The laity are claiming (and rightly claiming) the
privilege of being Church workers, and are preaching (and rightly
preaching) that "the Clergy are not the Church".If only they would
practise what they preach, and relieve the Clergy of all Church
finance, they need never listen to another "begging sermon" again.So
doing, they would rejoice the heart of the Clergy, and fulfil one of
their true functions as laity.This is one of the most beautiful of all the clerical names, only it
has become smirched by common use.The word Parson is derived from _Persona_, a _person_.The Parson is
_the_ Person--the Person who represents God in the Parish.It is not
his own person, or position, that he stands for, but the position and
Person of his Master.Paul, he can say, "I magnify mine
office," and probably the best way to magnify his office will be to
minimize himself.The outward marks of {134} respect still shown to
"the Parson" in some places, are not necessarily shown to the person
himself (though often, thank God, they may be), but are meant, however
unconsciously, to honour the Person he represents--just as the lifting
of the hat to a woman is not, of necessity, a mark of respect to the
individual woman, but a tribute to the Womanhood she represents.The Parson, then, is, or should be, the official person, the standing
element in the parish, who reminds men of God._Clergyman._

The word is derived from the Greek _kleros_,[7] "a lot," and conveys
its own meaning.According to some, it takes us back in thought to the
first Apostolic Ordination, when "they cast _lots_, and the _lot_ fell
upon Matthias".It reminds us that, as Matthias "was numbered with the
eleven," so a "Clergyman" is, at his Ordination, numbered with that
long list of "Clergy" who trace their spiritual pedigree to Apostolic
days.{135}

_Ordination Safeguards._

"Seeing then," run the words of the Ordination Service, "into how high
a dignity, and how weighty an Office and Charge" a Priest is called,
certain safeguards surround his Ordination, both for his own sake, and
for the sake of his people._Age._

No Deacon can, save under very exceptional circumstances, be ordained
Priest before he is 24, and has served at least a year in the Diaconate._Fitness._

This fitness, as in Confirmation, will be intellectual and moral.His
_intellectual_ fitness is tested by the Bishop's Examining Chaplain
some time before the Ordination to the Priesthood, and, in doubtful
cases, by the Bishop himself.His _moral_ fitness is tested by the Publication during Service, in the
Church where he is Deacon, of his intention to offer himself as a
Candidate for the Priesthood.To certify that this has been done, this
Publication must be signed by the Churchwarden, representing the {136}
laity, and by the Incumbent, representing the Clergy and responsible to
the Bishop.Further safeguard is secured by letters of Testimony from three
Beneficed Clergy, who have known the Candidate well either for the past
three years, or during the term of his Diaconate.Finally, at the very last moment, in the Ordination Service itself, the
Bishop invites the laity, if they know "any impediment or notable
crime" disqualifying the Candidate from being ordained Priest, to "come
forth in the Name of God, and show what the crime or impediment is".For many obvious reasons, but specially for
one._The Indelibility of Orders._

Once a Priest, always a Priest.When once the Bishop has ordained a
Deacon to the Priesthood, there is no going back.The law,
ecclesiastical or civil, may deprive him of the right to _exercise_ his
Office, but no power can deprive him of the Office itself.For instance, to safeguard the Church, and for {137} the sake of the
laity, a Priest may, for various offences, be what is commonly called
"unfrocked".He may be degraded, temporarily suspended, or permanently
forbidden to _officiate_ in any part of the Church; but he does not
cease to be a Priest.Any Priestly act, rightly and duly performed,
would be valid, though irregular.It would be for the people's good,
though it would be to his own hurt.Again: by _The Clerical Disabilities Act_ of 1870, a Priest may, by the
law of the land, execute a "Deed of Relinquishment," and, as far as the
law is concerned, return to lay life.This would enable him legally to
undertake lay work which the law forbids to the Clergy.[8]

He may, in consequence, regain his legal rights as a layman, and lose
his legal rights as a Priest; but he does not cease to be a Priest.The law can only touch his civil status, and cannot touch his priestly
"character".Hence, no securities can be superfluous to safeguard the irrevocable.{138}

_Jurisdiction._

As in the case of the Bishops, a Priest's jurisdiction is
twofold--_habitual_ and _actual_.Ordination confers on him _habitual_
jurisdiction, i.e.the power to exercise his office, to Absolve, to
Consecrate, to Bless, in the "Holy Church throughout the world".And,
as in the case of Bishops, for purposes of ecclesiastical order and
discipline, this Habitual Jurisdiction is limited to the sphere in
which the Bishop licenses him."Take thou authority," says the Bishop,
"to preach the word of God, and to minister the Sacraments _in the
congregation where thou shalt be lawfully appointed thereunto_."This
is called _Actual_ Jurisdiction._The Essence of the Sacrament._

The absolutely essential part of Ordination is the Laying on of Hands
(1 Tim.Various other and beautiful
ceremonies have, at different times, and in different places,
accompanied the essential Rite.Sometimes, and in some parts of the
Church, Unction, or anointing the Candidate with oil, has been used:
sometimes Ordination has been accompanied with the delivery of a Ring,
the Paten {139} and Chalice, the Bible, or the Gospels, the Pastoral
Staff (to a Bishop),--all edifying ceremonies, but not essentials.The word comes from the Greek _diakonos_, a
servant, and exactly describes the Office.Originally, a permanent
Order in the Church, the Diaconate is now, in the Church of England,
generally regarded as a step to the Priesthood.But
it is as this step, or preparatory stage, that we have to consider it.Considering the importance of this first step in the Ministry, both to
the man himself, and to the people, it is well that the laity should
know what safeguards are taken by the Bishop to secure "fit persons to
serve in the sacred ministry of the Church"[9]--and should realize
their own great responsibility in the matter.(1) _The Age._

No layman can be made a Deacon under 23.{140}

(2) The Preliminaries.The chief preliminary is the selection of the Candidate.The burden of
selection is shared by the Bishop, Clergy and Laity.The Bishop must,
of course, be the final judge of the Candidate's fitness, but _the
evidence upon which he bases his judgment_ must very largely be
supplied by the Laity.We pray in the Ember Collect that he "may lay hands suddenly on no man,
but make choice of _fit persons_".It is well that the Laity should
remember that they share with the Bishop and Clergy in the
responsibility of choice.For this fitness will, as in the case of the Priest, be moral and
intellectual.It will be _moral_--and it is here that the responsibility of the laity
begins.For, in addition to private inquiries made by the Bishop, the
laity are publicly asked, in the church of the parish where the
Candidate resides, to bear testimony to the integrity of his character.This publication is called the _Si quis_, from the Latin of the first
two words of publication ("if any..."), and it is repeated by the
Bishop in open church in the Ordination Service.The {141} absence of
any legal objection by the laity is the testimony of the people to the
Candidate's fitness.This throws upon the laity a full share of
responsibility in the choice of the Candidate.Their responsibility in
giving evidence is only second to that of the Bishop, whose decision
rests upon the evidence they give.Then, there is the testimony of the Clergy.No layman is accepted by
the Bishop for Ordination without _Letters Testimonial_--i.e.the
testimony of three beneficed Clergymen, to whom he is well known.These Clergy must certify that "we have had opportunity of observing
his conduct, and we do believe him, in our consciences, and as to his
moral conduct, a fit person to be admitted to the Sacred Ministry".Each signature must be countersigned by the signatory's own Bishop, who
thus guarantees the Clergyman's moral fitness to certify.Lastly, comes the Bishop himself, who, from first to last, is in close
touch with the Candidate, and who almost invariably helps to prepare
him personally in his own house during the week before his Ordination.In addition to University testimony,
evidence of the Candidate's {142} intellectual fitness is given to the
Bishop, as in the case of Priests, by his Examining Chaplains.Some
months before the Ordination, the Candidate is examined, and the
Examiner's Report sent in to the Bishop.The standard of intellectual
fitness has differed at various ages, in different parts of the Church,
and no one standard can be laid down.Assuming that the average
proportion of people in a parish will be (on a generous calculation) as
twelve Jurymen to one Judge, the layman called to the Diaconate should,
at least, be equal in intellectual attainment to "the layman" called to
the Bar.It does sometimes happen that evidence is given by Clergy, or laity,
which leads the Bishop to reject the Candidate on moral grounds.It
does sometimes happen that the Candidate is rejected or postponed on
intellectual grounds.It does, it must, sometimes happen that mistakes
are made: God alone is infallible.But, if due care is taken, publicly
and privately, and if the laity, as well as the Clergy, do their duty,
the Bishop's risk of a wrong judgment is reduced to a very small
minimum.A "fit" Clergy is so much the concern of the laity, that they may well
be reminded of their {143} parts and duties in the Ordination of a
Deacon.Liddon says, "the strength of the Church does not
consist in the number of pages in its 'Clerical Directory,' but in the
sum total of the moral and spiritual force which she has at her
command".[1] "The Threefold Ministry," writes Bishop Lightfoot, "can be traced
to Apostolic direction; and, short of an express statement, we can
possess no better assurance of a Divine appointment, or, at least, a
Divine Sanction."And he adds, speaking of his hearty desire for union
with the Dissenters, "we cannot surrender for any immediate advantages
the threefold Ministry which we have inherited from Apostolic times,
and which is the historic backbone of the Church" ("Ep.[2] The Welsh Bishops did not transmit Episcopacy to us, but rather
came into us.[3] In a book called _Registrum Sacrum Anglicanum_, Bishop Stubbs has
traced the name, date of Consecration, names of Consecrators, and in
most cases place of Consecration, of every Bishop in the Church of
England from the Consecration of Augustine.[4] The Bishops are one of the three Estates of the Realm--Lords
Spiritual, Lords Temporal, and Commons (not, as is so often said, King,
Lords, and Commons).The Archbishop of Canterbury is the first Peer of
the Realm, and has precedency immediately after the blood royal.The
Archbishop of York has precedency over all Dukes, not being of royal
blood, and over all the great officers of State, except the Lord
Chancellor.He has the privilege of crowning the Queen Consort."Encyclopedia of the Laws of England," vol.See Phillimore's "Ecclesiastical Law,"
vol.[7] But see Skeat, whose references are to [Greek: kleros], "a lot," in
late Greek, and the Clergy whose portion is the Lord (Deut.The [Greek: kleros] is thus the portion
rather than the circumstance by which it is obtained, i.e.[8] For example: farming more than a certain number of acres, or going
into Parliament.We deal now with the two last Sacraments under consideration--Penance
and Unction.Penance is for the
healing of the soul, and indirectly of the body: Unction is for the
healing of the body, and indirectly of the soul.Thomas Aquinas, "has been instituted to
produce one special effect, although it may produce, as consequences,
other effects besides."It is so with these two Sacraments.Body and
Soul are so involved, that what directly affects the one must
indirectly affect the other.Thus, the direct effect of Penance on the
soul must indirectly affect the body, and the direct effect of Unction
on the body must indirectly affect the soul.{145}

_Penance._

The word is derived from the Latin _penitentia_, penitence, and its
root-meaning (_poena_, punishment) suggests a punitive element in all
real repentance.It is used as a comprehensive term for confession of
sin, punishment for sin, and the Absolution, or Remission of Sins.As
Baptism was designed to recover the soul from original or inherited
sin, so Penance was designed to recover the soul from actual or wilful
sin....[1]  It is not, as in the case of infant Baptism, administered
wholly irrespective of free will: it must be freely sought ("if he
humbly and heartily desire it"[2]) before it can be freely bestowed.Thus, Confession must precede Absolution, and Penitence must precede
and accompany Confession._Confession._

Here we all start on common ground.the necessity of Confession (1) _to God_ ("If we confess our sins, He
is faithful and just to forgive us our sins") {146} and (2) _to man_
("Confess your faults one to another").Further, we all agree that
confession to man is in reality confession to God ("Against Thee, _Thee
only_, have I sinned").Our only ground of difference is, not
_whether_ we ought to confess, but _how_ we ought to confess.It is a
difference of method rather than of principle.There are two ways of confessing sins (whether to God, or to man), the
informal, and the formal.Most of us use one way; some the other; many
both._Informal Confession_.--Thank God, I can use this way at any, and at
every, moment of my life.If I have sinned, I need wait for no formal
act of Confession; but, as I am, and where I am, I can make my
Confession.Then, and there, I can claim the Divine response to the
soul's three-fold _Kyrie_: "Lord, have mercy upon me; Christ, have
mercy upon me; Lord, have mercy upon me".But do I never want--does
God never want--anything more than this?The soul is not always
satisfied with such an easy method of going to Confession.It needs at
times something more impressive, something perhaps less superficial,
less easy going.It demands more time for {147} deepening thought, and
greater knowledge of what it has done, before sin's deadly hurt cuts
deep enough to produce real repentance, and to prevent repetition.At
such times, it cries for something more formal, more solemn, than
instantaneous confession.It needs, what the Prayer Book calls, "a
special Confession of sins"._Formal Confession_.--Hence our Prayer Book provides two formal Acts of
Confession, and suggests a third.Two of these are for public use, the
third for private.In Matins and Evensong, and in the Eucharistic Office, a form of
"_general_ confession" is provided.Both forms are in the first person
plural throughout.Clearly, their primary intention is, not to make us
merely think of, or confess, our own personal sins, but the sins of the
Church,--and our own sins, as members of the Church.It is "we" have
sinned, rather than "I" have sinned.Such formal language might,
otherwise, at times be distressingly unreal,--when, e.g., not honestly
feeling that the "burden" of our own personal sin "is intolerable," or
when making a public Confession in church directly after a personal
Confession in private.In the Visitation of the Sick, the third mode of {148} formal
Confession is suggested, though the actual words are naturally left to
the individual penitent.The Prayer Book no longer speaks in the
plural, or of "a _general_ Confession," but it closes, as it were, with
the soul, and gets into private, personal touch with it: "Here shall
the sick man be moved to make a _special_ Confession of his sins, if he
feel his conscience troubled with any weighty matter; after which
Confession, the Priest shall absolve him (if he humbly and heartily
desire it) after this sort".This Confession is to be both free and
formal: formal, for it is to be made before the Priest in his
"_ministerial_" capacity; free, for the penitent is to be "moved" (not
"compelled") to confess.Notice, he _is_ to be moved; but then (though
not till then) he is free to accept, or reject, the preferred means of
grace.Sacraments are open to all;
they are forced on none.They are love-tokens of the Sacred Heart;
free-will offerings of His Royal Bounty.These, then, are the two methods of Confession at our disposal.God is
"the Father of an infinite Majesty".In _informal_ Confession, the
sinner goes to God as his _Father_,--as the Prodigal, after doing
penance in the far country, went {149} to his father with "_Father_, I
have sinned".In _formal_ Confession, the sinner goes to God as to the
Father of an _infinite Majesty_,--as David went to God through Nathan,
God's ambassador.It is a fearful responsibility to hinder any soul from using either
method; it is a daring risk to say: "Because one method alone appeals
to me, therefore no other method shall be used by you".God multiplies
His methods, as He expands His love: and if any "David" is drawn to say
"I have sinned" before the appointed "Nathan," and, through prejudice
or ignorance, such an one is hindered from so laying his sins on Jesus,
God will require that soul at the hinderer's hands._Absolution._

It is the same with Absolution as with Confession.Here, too, we start
on common ground.All agree that "_God only_ can forgive sins," and
half our differences come because this is not recognized.Whatever
form Confession takes, the penitent exclaims: "_To Thee only it
appertaineth to forgive sins_".Pardon through the Precious Blood is
the one, and only, source of {150} forgiveness.Our only difference,
then, is as to God's _methods_ of forgiveness.Some seem to limit His love, to tie forgiveness down to one, and
only one, method of absolution--direct, personal, instantaneous,
without any ordained Channel such as Christ left.Direct, God's pardon
certainly is; personal and instantaneous, it certainly can be; without
any sacramental _media_, it certainly may be.But we dare not limit
what God has not limited; we dare not deny the existence of ordained
channels, because God can, and does, act without such channels.He has
opened an ordained fountain for sin and uncleanness as a superadded
gift of love, and in the Ministry of reconciliation He conveys pardon
through this channel.At the most solemn moment of his life, when a Deacon is ordained
Priest, the formal terms of his Commission to the Priesthood run thus:
"Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of a Priest in the
Church of God, now committed unto thee by the Imposition of our hands.Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins thou
dost retain, they are retained."No
Priest dare hide his commission, play with {151} the plain meaning of
the words, or conceal from others a "means of grace" which they have a
blessed right to know of, and to use.But what is the good of this Absolution, if God can forgive without it?There must, therefore, be some
superadded grace attached to this particular ordinance.It is not left merely to comfort the penitent (though that it
does), nor to let him hear from a fellow-sinner that his sins are
forgiven him (though that he does); but it is left, like any other
Sacrament, as a special means of grace.It is the ordained Channel
whereby God's pardon is conveyed to (and only to) the penitent sinner."No penitence, no pardon," is the law of Sacramental Absolution.The Prayer Book, therefore, preaches the power of formal, as well as
informal, Absolution.There are in it three forms of Absolution,
varying in words but the same in power.The appropriating power of the
penitent may, and does, vary, according to the sincerity of his
confession: Absolution is in each case the same.It is man's capacity
to receive it, not God's power in giving it, that varies.Thus, all
three Absolutions in the {152} Prayer Book are of the same force,
though our appropriating capacity in receiving them may differ.This
capacity will probably be less marked at Matins and Evensong than at
Holy Communion, and at Holy Communion than in private Confession,
because it will be less personal, less thorough.The words of
Absolution seem to suggest this.The first two forms are in the plural
("pardon and deliver _you_"), and are thrown, as it were, broadcast
over the Church: the third is special ("forgive _thee_ thine offences")
and is administered to the individual.But the formal act is the same
in each case; and to stroll late into church, as if the Absolution in
Matins and Evensong does not matter, may be to incur a very distinct
loss.When, and how often, formal "special Confession" is to be used, and
formal Absolution to be sought, is left to each soul to decide.The
two special occasions which the Church of England emphasizes (without
limiting) are before receiving the Holy Communion, and when sick.Before Communion, the Prayer Book counsels its use for any disquieted
conscience; and the {153} Rubric which directs intending Communicants
to send in their names to the Parish Priest the day before making their
Communion, still bears witness to its framers' intention--that known
sinners might not be communicated without first being brought to a
state of repentance.The sick, also, after being directed to make their wills,[3] and
arrange their temporal affairs, are further urged to examine their
spiritual state; to make a special confession; and to obtain the
special grace, in the special way provided for them.And, adds the
Rubric, "men should often be put in remembrance to take order for the
settling of their temporal estates, while they are in health"--and if
of the temporal, how much more of their spiritual estate._Direction._

But, say some, is not all this very weakening to the soul?They are,
probably, mixing up two things,--the Divine Sacrament of forgiveness
which (rightly used) must be strengthening, and the human appeal for
direction which (wrongly used) may be weakening.{154}

But "direction" is not necessarily part of Penance.The Prayer Book
lays great stress upon it, and calls it "ghostly counsel and advice,"
but it is neither Confession nor Absolution.It has its own place in
the Prayer Book;[4] but it has not, necessarily, anything whatever to
do with the administration of the Sacrament.Direction may, or may
not, be good for the soul.It largely depends upon the character of
the penitent, and the wisdom of the Director.It is quite possible for
the priest to over-direct, and it is fatally possible for the penitent
to think more of direction than of Absolution.It is quite possible to
obscure the Sacramental side of Penance with a human craving for
"ghostly counsel and advice".Satan would not be Satan if it were not
so.But this "ghostly," or spiritual, "counsel and advice" has saved
many a lad, and many a man, from many a fall; and when rightly sought,
and wisely given is, as the Prayer Book teaches, a most helpful adjunct
to Absolution.Only, it is not, necessarily, a part of "going to
Confession".{155}

_Indulgences._

The abuse of the Sacrament is another, and not unnatural objection to
its use; and it often gets mixed up with Mediaeval teaching about
Indulgences.An _Indulgence_ is exactly what the word suggests--the act of
indulging, or granting a favour.In Roman theology, an Indulgence is
the remission of temporal punishment due to sin after Absolution.It
is either "plenary," i.e.when the whole punishment is remitted, or
"partial," when some of it is remitted.At corrupt periods of Church
history, these Indulgences have been bought for money,[5] thus making
one law for the rich, and another for the poor.Very naturally, the
scandals connected with such buying and selling raised suspicions
against the Sacrament with which Indulgences were associated.[6]  But
Indulgences have nothing in the world to do with the right use of the
lesser Sacrament of Penance.{156}

_Amendment._

The promise of Amendment is an essential part of Penance.It is a
necessary element in all true contrition.Thus, the penitent promises
"true amendment" before he receives Absolution.If he allowed a priest
to give him Absolution without firmly purposing to amend, he would not
only invalidate the Absolution, but would commit an additional sin.The promise to amend may, like any other promise, be made and broken;
but the deliberate purpose must be there.No better description of true repentance can be found than in
Tennyson's "Guinevere":--

  _For what is true repentance but in thought--_
  _Not ev'n in inmost thought to think again_
  _The sins that made the past so pleasant to us._


Such has been the teaching of the Catholic Church always, everywhere,
and at all times: such is the teaching of the Church of England, as
part of that Church, and as authoritatively laid down in the Book of
Common Prayer.Absolution is the conveyance of God's
pardon to the penitent sinner by God's ordained Minister, through the
ordained Ministry of Reconciliation.{157}

  Lamb of God, the world's transgression
    Thou alone canst take away;
  Hear!hear our heart's confession,
    And Thy pardoning grace convey.Thine availing intercession
    We but echo when we pray.[2] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[3] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[4] See the First Exhortation in the Order of the Administration of the
Holy Communion.Peter's at Rome was largely built out of funds gained by the
sale of indulgences.[6] The Council of Trent orders that Indulgences must be granted by
Pope and Prelate _gratis_.The second Sacrament of Recovery is _Unction_, or, in more familiar
language, "the Anointing of the Sick".It is called by Origen "the
complement of Penance".The meaning of the Sacrament is found in St.let him call for the elders of the Church; and let them
pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the
prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up;
and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."Here the Bible states that the "Prayer of Faith" with Unction is more
effective than the "Prayer of Faith" without Unction.It can (1) recover the body, and (2) restore the
soul.Its primary {159} object seems to be to recover the body; but it
also, according to the teaching of St.First, he says, Anointing with the Prayer of Faith heals the body; and
then, because of the inseparable union between body and soul, it
cleanses the soul.Thus, as the object of Penance is primarily to heal the soul, and
indirectly to heal the body; so the object of Unction is primarily to
heal the body, and indirectly to heal the soul.The story of Unction may be summarized very shortly.It was instituted
in Apostolic days, when the Apostles "anointed with oil many that were
sick and healed them" (St.It was continued in the Early
Church, and perpetuated during the Middle Ages, when its use (by a
"_corrupt_[1] following of the Apostles") was practically limited to
the preparation of the dying instead of (by a _correct_ "following of
the Apostles") being used for the recovery of the living.In our 1549
Prayer Book an authorized Office was appointed for its use, but this,
lest it should be misused, was omitted in 1552.And although, as
Bishop Forbes says, "everything of that earlier Liturgy was praised by
those who {160} removed it," it has not yet been restored.It is "one
of the lost Pleiads" of our present Prayer Book.But, as Bishop Forbes
adds, "there is nothing to hinder the revival of the Apostolic and
Scriptural Custom of Anointing the Sick whenever any devout person
desires it".[2]



_Extreme Unction._

An unhistoric use of the name partly explains the unhistoric use of the
Sacrament._Extreme_, or last (_extrema_) Unction has been taken to
mean the anointing of the sick when _in extremis_.This, as we have
seen, is a "corrupt," and not a correct, "following of the Apostles".The phrase _Extreme_ Unction means the extreme, or last, of a series of
ritual Unctions, or anointings, once used in the Church.The first
Unction was in Holy Baptism, when the Baptized were anointed with Holy
Oil: then came the anointing in Confirmation: then in Ordination; and,
last of all, the anointing of the sick.Of this last anointing, it is
written: "All Christian men should account, and repute the said manner
of anointing among the other Sacraments, forasmuch as it is a visible
sign of an invisible grace".[3]

{161}

_Its Administration._

It must be administered under the Scriptural conditions laid down in
St.The first condition refers to:--

(1) _The Minister_.--The Minister is _the Church_, in her corporate
capacity.Scripture says to the sick: "Let him call for the Elders,"
or Presbyters, "of the Church".The word is in the plural; it is to be
the united act of the whole Church.And, further, there must be
nothing secret about it, as if it were either a charm, or something to
be ashamed of, or apologized for.It may have to be done in a private
house, but it is to be done by no private person.[4]  "Let him call for
the elders."(2) _The Manner_.--The Elders are to administer Sacrament not in their
own name (any more than the Priest gives Absolution in his own name),
but "in the Name of the Lord".(3) _The Method_.--The sick man is to be anointed (either on the
afflicted part, or in other ways), _with prayer_: "Let them pray over
him".{162}

(4) _The Matter_.--Oil--"anointing him with oil".As in Baptism,
sanctified water is the ordained matter by which "Jesus Christ
cleanseth us from all sin"; so in Unction, consecrated oil is the
ordained matter used by the Holy Ghost to cleanse us from all
sickness--bodily, and (adds St."And if he have
committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."For this latter purpose, there are two Scriptural requirements:
_Confession_ and _Intercession_.For it follows: "Confess your faults
one to another, and pray for one another that ye may be healed".Thus
it is with Unction as with other Sacraments; with the "last" as with
the first--special grace is attached to special means.The Bible says
that, under certain conditions, oil and prayer together will effect
more than either oil or prayer apart; that oil without prayer cannot,
and prayer without oil will not, win the special grace of healing
guaranteed to the use of oil and prayer together.In our days, the use of anointing with prayer is (in alliance with, and
in addition to, Medical Science) being more fully recognized."The
Prayer of Faith" is coming into its own, and is being placed once more
in proper position in the {163} sphere of healing; _anointing_ is being
more and more used "according to the Scriptures".Both are being used
together in a simple belief in revealed truth.It often happens that
"the elders of the Church" are sent for by the sick; a simple service
is used; the sick man is anointed; the united "Prayer of Faith" (it
_must_ be "of Faith") is offered; and, if it be good for his spiritual
health, the sick man is "made whole of whatsoever disease he had".God give us in this, as in every other Sacrament, a braver, quieter,
more loving faith in His promises.The need still exists: the grace is
still to be had._If our love were but more simple,_
    _We should take Him at His word;_
  _And our lives would be all sunshine_
    _In the sweetness of our Lord._

Lady CULVERIN _surrenders it_.)My dear, you're _not_ going to inflict
that mincing little PILLINER boy on poor MAISIE!At least let her have somebody she's used to.He's an old friend, and she's not seen him for months.I
must alter that, if you've no objection.(_She does._) And then you've
given my poor Poet to that SPELWANE girl!_Lady Culverin._ I thought she wouldn't mind putting up with him just
for one evening._Lady Cant._ Wouldn't _mind_!And is that how you
speak of a celebrity when you are so fortunate as to have one to
entertain?_Lady Culv._ But, my dear ROHESIA, you must allow that, whatever his
talents may be, he is not--well, not _quite_ one of Us._Lady Cant._ (_blandly_).My dear, I never heard he had any connection
with the manufacture of chemical manures, in which your worthy Papa so
greatly distinguished himself--if _that_ is what you mean._Lady Culv._ (_with some increase of colour_).That is _not_ what I
meant, ROHESIA--as you know perfectly well.SPURRELL'S manner is most objectionable; when he's not obsequious, he's
horribly familiar!_Lady Cant._ (_sharply_).He strikes me as well
enough--for that class of person.And it is intellect, soul, all that
kind of thing that _I_ value.I look _below_ the surface, and I find a
great deal that is very original and charming in this young man.And
surely, my dear, if I find myself able to associate with him, _you_ need
not be so fastidious!I consider him my _protege_, and I won't have him
slighted.He is far too good for VIVIEN SPELWANE!_Lady Culv._ (_with just a suspicion of malice_).Perhaps, ROHESIA, you
would like him to take _you_ in?_Lady Cant._ That, of course, is quite out of the question.I see you
have given me the Bishop--he's a poor, dry stick of a man--never forgets
he was the Headmaster of Swisham--but he's always glad to meet _me_._Lady Culv._ I really don't know whom I _can_ give Mr.There's

woman--she'll amuse him._Now_ you can give RUPERT the list.[Sir RUPERT _and various members of the house-party appear one by
    one;_ Lord _and_ Lady LULLINGTON, _the_ Bishop of BIRCHESTER _and_

the failure of the Church to reach the Working Man?_The Bishop_ (_who has a holy horror of the_ Countess).I--ah--fear
I cannot charge my memory so precisely, my dear Lady CANTIRE.We--ah--differ unfortunately on so many subjects.I trust, however, we
may--ah--agree to suspend hostilities on this occasion?_Lady Cant._ (_with even more bonhomie_).Don't be too sure of _that_,
Bishop.I've several crows to pluck with you, and we are to go in to
dinner together, you know!I had no conception that such a pleasure was in
store for me!(_To himself._) This must be the penance for breaking my
rule of never dining out on Saturday!_Lady Cant._ I wonder, Bishop, if you have seen this wonderful volume of
poetry that everyone is talking about--_Andromeda_?_The Bishop_ (_conscientiously_).I chanced only this morning, by way of
momentary relaxation, to take up a journal containing a notice of that
work, with copious extracts.The impression left on my mind
was--ah--unfavourable; a certain talent, no doubt, some felicity of
expression, but a noticeable lack of the--ah--reticence, the discipline,
the--the scholarly touch which a training at one of our great Public
Schools (I forbear to particularise), and at a University, can alone
impart.I was also pained to observe a crude discontent with the
existing Social System--a system which, if not absolutely perfect,
cannot be upset or even modified without the gravest danger.But I was
still more distressed to note in several passages a decided taint of the
morbid sensuousness which renders so much of our modern literature
sickly and unwholesome._Lady Cant._ All prejudice, my dear Bishop; why, you haven't even _read_
the book!However, the author is staying here now, and I feel convinced
that if you only knew him, you'd alter your opinion.Such an unassuming,
inoffensive creature!I'll call him over
here.... Goodness, why does he shuffle along in that way!_Spurrell_ (_meeting_ Sir RUPERT).Hope I've kept nobody waiting for
_me_, Sir RUPERT.(_Confidentially._) I'd rather a job to get these
things on; but they're really a wonderful fit, considering![_He passes on, leaving his host speechless._

_Lady Cant._ That's right, Mr.Come here, and let me present
you to the Bishop of BIRCHESTER.The Bishop has just been telling me he
considers your _Andromeda_ sickly, or unhealthy, or something.I'm sure
you'll be able to convince him it's nothing of the sort.[_She leaves him with the_ Bishop, _who is visibly annoyed._

_Spurr._ (_to himself, overawed_).Wish I knew the right way to
talk to a Bishop.Can't call _him_ nothing--so doosid familiar.(_Aloud._) _Andromeda_ sickly, your--(_tentatively_)--your Right
Reverence?Not a bit of it--sound as a roach!_The Bishop._ If I had thought my--ah--criticisms were to be repeated--I
might say misrepresented, as the Countess has thought proper to do, Mr.SPURRELL, I should not have ventured to make them.At the same time, you
must be conscious yourself, I think, of certain blemishes which would
justify the terms I employed._Spurr._ I never saw any in _Andromeda_ myself, your--your Holiness.You're the first to find a fault in her.I don't say there mayn't be
something dicky about the setting and the turn of the tail, but that's a
trifle._The Bishop._ I did not refer to the setting of the tale, and the
portions I object to are scarcely trifles.But pardon me if I prefer to
end a discussion that is somewhat unprofitable.(_To himself, as he
turns on his heel._) A most arrogant, self-satisfied, and conceited
young man--a truly lamentable product of this half-educated age!_Spurr._ (_to himself_).Well, he may be a dab at dogmas--he don't know
much about dogs._Drummy_'s got a constitution worth a dozen of _his_!_Lady Culv._ (_approaching him_).SPURRELL, Lord LULLINGTON
wishes to know you.(_To herself, as she leads
him up to_ Lord L.)I do _wish_ ROHESIA wouldn't force me to do this
sort of thing![_She presents him._

_Lord Lullington_ (_to himself_).I suppose I _ought_ to know all
about his novel, or whatever it is he's done.(_Aloud, with
courtliness._) Very pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr.SPURRELL;
you've--ah--delighted the world by your _Andromeda_.When are we to look
for your next production?_Spurr._ (_to himself_).Never met such a doggy
lot in my life!(_Aloud._) Er--well, my lord, I've promised so many as
it is, that I hardly see my way to----

_Lord Lull._ (_paternally_).Take my advice, my dear young man, leave
yourself as free as possible.Expect you to give us your best, you know.[_He turns to continue a conversation._

_Spurr._ (_to himself_).He won't get it under a five-pound
note, I can tell him.(_He makes his way to_ Miss SPELWANE.)I say, what
do you think the old Bishop's been up to?Pitching into _Andromeda_ like
the very dooce--says she's _sickly_!_Miss Spelwane_ (_to herself_).He brings his literary disappointments
to _me_, not MAISIE!(_Aloud, with the sweetest sympathy._) How
dreadfully unjust!Oh, I've dropped my fan--no, pray don't trouble; I
can pick it up.My arms are so long, you know--like a kangaroo's--no,
what _is_ that animal which has such long arms?You're so clever, you
_ought_ to know!_Spurr._ I suppose you mean a gorilla?_Miss Spelw._ How crushing of you!But you must go away now, or else
you'll find nothing to say to me at dinner--you take me in, you know.I feel----But if I told you, I might make you
too conceited!_Spurr._ Oh, no, you wouldn't.[Sir RUPERT _approaches with_ Mr._Sir Rupert._ VIVIEN, my dear, let me introduce Mr.SHORTHORN--Miss
SPELWANE.Let me see--ha--yes, you take in Mrs.Come this way, and I'll find her for you.[_He marches_ SPURRELL _off._

_Mr.Shorthorn_ (_to_ Miss SPELWANE).Good thing getting this rain at
last; a little more of this dry weather and we should have had no grass
to speak of!_Miss Spelw._ (_who has not quite recovered from her disappointment_).And now you _will_ have some grass to speak of?_Spurr._ (_as dinner is announced, to_ Lady MAISIE).I say, Lady MAISIE,
I've just been told I've got to take in a married lady.I don't know
what to talk to her about.I should feel a lot more at home with you._Lady Maisie_ (_to herself_).What a fearful suggestion--but I simply
_daren't_ snub him!(_Aloud._) I'm afraid, Mr.SPURRELL, we must both
put up with the partners we have; most distressing, isn't it--_but_![_She gives a little shrug._

_Captain Thicknesse_ (_immediately behind her, to himself_).Gad,
_that_'s pleasant!I knew I'd better have gone to Aldershot!(_Aloud._)
I've been told off to take you in, Lady MAISIE, not _my_ fault, don't
you know._Lady Maisie._ There's no need to be so apologetic about it.(_To
herself._) Oh, I _hope_ he didn't hear what I said to that wretch.Thick._ Well, I rather thought there _might_ be, perhaps._Lady Maisie_ (_to herself_).If he's going to be so
stupid as to misunderstand, I'm sure _I_ shan't explain.[_They take their place in the procession to the Dining Hall._

IN THREE VOLUMES.VOLUME I.--_Awakening._

AND so the work was done.BELINDA, after a year's hard writing, had
completed her self-appointed task._Douglas the Doomed One_ had grown by
degrees into its present proportions.First the initial volume was
completed; then the second was finished; and now the third was ready for
the printer's hands.BELINDA knew no publishers and had no influence.How could she get
anyone to take the novel up?And yet, if she was to believe the
_Author_, there was plenty of room for untried talent.According to that
interesting periodical publishers were constantly on the lookout for
undiscovered genius.Why should she not try the firm of Messrs.She set her face hard, and muttered,
"Yes, they _shall_ do it!_Douglas the Doomed One_ shall appear with the
assistance of Messrs.And when BELINDA made up her
mind to do anything, not wild omnibus-horses would turn her from her
purpose.[Illustration]

VOLUME II.--_Wide Awake._

Messrs.BINDING AND PRINT had received their visitor with courtesy.They
did not require to read _Douglas the Doomed One_.They had discovered
that it was sufficiently long to make the regulation three volumes.They would be happy to
publish it."When we have paid for the outlay we shall divide the residue," cried
Mr."And do you think I shall soon get a cheque?""Well, that is a question not easy to answer.You see, we usually spend
any money we make in advertising.It does the work good in the long run,
although at first it rather checks the profits."BELINDA was satisfied, and took her departure."We must advertise _Douglas the Doomed One_ in the _Skatemaker's
Quarterly Magazine_," said Mr."And in the _Crossing Sweeper's Annual_," replied Mr.Then the
two partners smiled at one another knowingly.They laughed as they
remembered that of both the periodicals they had mentioned they were the
proprietors.VOLUME III.--_Fast Asleep._

The poor patient at Slocum-on-Slush moaned.He had been practically
awake for a month, and nothing could send him to sleep.The Doctor held
his wrist, and as he felt the rapid beats of his pulse became graver and
graver."And you have no friends, no relatives?"My only visitor was the man who brought that box of books from a
metropolitan library.""There may yet be time to save
his life!"The man of science rose abruptly, and approaching the casket containing
the current literature of the day, roughly forced it open.He turned over the volumes impatiently until he
reached a set."If I can but get him to read this he
will be saved."Then turning to his patient he continued, "You should
peruse this novel.It is one that I recommend in cases such as yours.""I am afraid I am past reading," returned the invalid."However, I will
do my best."An hour later the Doctor (who had had to make some calls) returned and
found that his patient was sleeping peacefully.The first volume of
_Douglas the Doomed One_ had the desired result."Excellent, excellent," murmured the medico."It had the same effect
upon another of my patients.Insomnia has been conquered for the second time by
_Douglas the Doomed One_, and who now shall say that the three-volume
novel of the amateur is not a means of spreading civilisation?It must
be a mine of wealth to somebody."BINDING AND PRINT, had they heard the Doctor's remark,
would have agreed with him!*       *       *       *       *

  There was a little urchin, and he had an old horse-pistol,
    Which he rammed with powder damp and shots of lead, lead, lead;
  And he cried "I know not fear!For this little cove was slightly off his head, head, head.This ambitious little lad was a Paddy and a Rad,
    And himself he rather fancied as a shot, shot, shot;
  And he held the rules of sport, and close season, and, in short,
    The "regulation rubbish" was all rot, rot, rot.He held a "bird" a thing to be potted on the wing,
    Or perched upon a hedge, or up a tree, tree, tree;
  And, says he, "If a foine stag I can add to my small bag,
    A pistol _or_ a Maxim will suit me, me, me!"And so upon all fours he would crawl about the moors,
    To the detriment of elbows, knees, and slack, slack, slack;
  And he says, "What use a-talking?If I choose to call this'stalking,'
    And _I bag my game_, who's going to hould me back, back, back?"Says he, "I scoff at raisons, and stale talk of toimes and saisons;
    I'm game to shoot a fox, or spear a stag, stag, stag;
  Nay, I'd net, or club, a salmon; your old rules of sport are gammon,
    For wid me it's just a question of the bag, bag, bag!"There are omadhauns, I know, who would let a foine buck go
    Just bekase 'twas out of toime, or they'd no gun, gun, gun;
  But if oi can hit, and hurt, wid a pistol--or a squirt--
    By jabers, it is all the betther fun, fun, fun!"So he scurryfunged around with his stomach on the ground
    (For stalking seems of crawling a mere branch, branch, branch).And he spied "a stag of ten," and he cried, "Hurroo!Now then,
    I fancy I can hit _him_--in the haunch, haunch haunch!I'll bag that foine Stag Royal, or at any rate oi'll troy all
    The devoices of a sportshman from the Oisle, Oisle, Oisle.One who's used to shoot asprawl from behoind a hedge or wall,
    At the risks of rock and heather well may smoile, smoile, smoile!"But our sportsman bold, though silly, by a stalwart Highland gillie,
    Was right suddenly arrested ere he fired, fired, fired.--
  "Hoots!If you'll excuse the hint, that old thing, with lock of flint,
    As a weapon for _this_ sport can't be admired, mired, mired!"It will not bring down _that_ quarry, your horse-pistol!Don't _you_
        worry!That Royal Stag _we_'ll stalk, boy, in good time, time, time;
  But to pop at it just now, and kick up an awful row,
    Scare, and _miss_ it were a folly, nay a crime, crime, crime!"Be you sure 'Our Party' will this fine quarry track and kill;
    Our guns need not your poor toy blunderbuss, buss, buss.This is not the time or place for a-following up this chase;
    So just clear out and leave this game to us, us, us!"*       *       *       *       *

"You really must join the Army," said the stern old Puritan to the Lord
Protector."The fate of this fair realm of England depends upon the
promptness with which you assume command."He had laid aside his buff doublet, and had
donned a coat of a thinner material.His sword also was gone, and
hanging by his side was a pair of double spy-glasses--new in those
days--new in very deed."I cannot go," cried the Lord Protector at last, "it would be too great
a sacrifice.""You said not that," pursued IRETON--for it was he--"when you called
upon CHARLES to lose his head.""But in this case, good sooth, I would wish a head to be won, or the
victory to be by a head;" and then the Uncrowned King laughed long and
heartily, as was his wont when some jest tickled him."This is no matter for merriment," exclaimed IRETON sternly."OLIVER,
you are playing the fool.You are sacrificing for pleasure, business,
duty.""Well, I cannot help it," was the response."But mind you, IRETON, it
shall be the last time.""What is it that attracts you so strongly?What is the pleasure that
lures you away from the path of duty?""I will tell you, and then you will pity, perchance forgive me.To-day

SITTING ON OUR SENATE.SIR,--It struck me that the best and simplest way of finding out what
were the intentions of the Government with regard to the veto of the
Peers was to write and ask each individual Member his opinion on the
subject.Accordingly I have done so, and it seems to me that there is a
vast amount of significance in the nature of the replies I have
received, to anyone capable of reading between the lines; or, as most of
the communications only extended to a single line, let us say to anyone
capable of reading beyond the full-stop.Lord ROSEBERY'S Secretary, for
example, writes that "the Prime Minister is at present out of town"--_at
present_, you see, but obviously on the point of coming back, in order
to grapple with my letter and the question generally.Sir WILLIAM
HARCOURT, his Secretary, writes, "is at Wiesbaden, but upon his return
your communication will no doubt receive his attention"--_receive his
attention_, an ominous phrase for the Peers, who seem hardly to realise
that between them and ruin there is only the distance from Wiesbaden to
Downing Street.MORLEY "sees no reason to alter his published
opinion on the subject"--_alter_, how readily, by the prefixing of a
single letter, that word becomes _halter_!I was unable to effect
personal service of my letter on the ATTORNEY-GENERAL, possibly because
I called at his chambers during the Long Vacation; but the fact that a
card should have been attached to his door bearing the words "Back at 2
P.M."surely indicates that Sir JOHN RIGBY will _back up_ his leaders in
any approaching attack on the fortress of feudalism!Then surely the
circumstance that the other Ministers to whom my letters were addressed
_have not as yet sent any answer_ shows how seriously they regard the
situation, and how disinclined they are to commit themselves to a too
hasty reply!In fact, the outlook for the House of Lords, judging from
these Ministerial communications, is decidedly gloomy, and I am inclined
to think that an Autumn Session devoted to abolishing it is a most
probable eventuality.Yours,

  FUSSY-CUSS EXSPECTANS.SIR,--The real way of dealing with the Lords is as follows.The next
time that they want to meet, cut off their gas and water!Tell the
butcher and baker _not_ to call at the House for orders, and dismiss the
charwomen who dust their bloated benches.If _this_ doesn't bring them
to reason, nothing will.HIGH-MINDED DEMOCRAT.*       *       *       *       *

  An earthquake or a rooting pig!No, young or old, or small or big,
  A boy's a pest, a plague, a scourge,
  A dread domestic demiurge
  Who brings the home to chaos' verge.The _only_ reason I can see
  For praising him is--well, that he,
  As WORDSWORTH--so his dictum ran--
  Declared, is "father to the man."And even then the better plan
  Would be that he, calm, sober, sage,

public.I am surprised that a nobleman like Lord RAYLEIGH should even
attempt to make such a thoroughly useless, and, indeed, revolutionary
discovery.It is enough to turn anyone into a democrat at once.And what
was Lord SALISBURY, as a Conservative, doing, in allowing such a subject
to be mooted at Oxford?Why did he not at once turn the new gas off at

a book which is the beautiful and artistic result of very many days of
patient and careful observation.By the way, there is an illustration of
a Blackcock Tournament, which is, for knock-about primitive humour, as
good as a pantomime rally.Are we in future to

WET-WILLOW.A SONG OF A SLOPPY SEASON.(_By a Washed-Out Willow-Wielder._)

AIR--"_Titwillow._"

  In the dull, damp pavilion a popular "Bat"
    Sang "Willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"great slogger, pray what are you at,
    Singing 'Willow, wet-willow, wet-willow'?Is it lowness of average, batsman," I cried;
  "Or a bad 'brace of ducks' that has lowered your pride?"With a low-muttered swear-word or two he replied,
    "Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"He said "In the mud one can't score, anyhow,
    Singing willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!The people are raising a deuce of a row,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!I've been waiting all day in these flannels--they're damp!--
  The spectators impatiently shout, shriek, and stamp,
  But a batsman, you see, cannot play with a Gamp,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"Now I feel just as sure as I am that my name
    Isn't willow, wet-willow, wet-willow,
  The people will swear that I don't play the game,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!My spirits are low and my scores are not high,
  But day after day we've soaked turf and grey sky,
  And I shan't have a chance till the wickets get dry,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!!!"*       *       *       *       *

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P._House of Commons, Monday, August 20._--ASHMEAD-BARTLETT (Knight) is the
CASABIANCA of Front Opposition Bench.Now his
opportunity; will show jealous colleagues, watchful House, and
interested country, how a party should be led.Had an innings on
Saturday, when, in favourite character of Dompter of British and other
Lions, he worried Under Secretaries for Foreign Affairs and the
Colonies.In fact what happened seems to
confirm quaint theory SARK advances.Says he believes those two astute young men, EDWARD GREY and SYDNEY
BUXTON, "control" the Sheffield Knight.Moreover, things are managed so well both at
Foreign Office and Colonial Office that they have no opportunity of
distinguishing themselves.The regular representatives on the Front
Opposition Bench of Foreign Affairs and Colonies say nothing;
patriotically acquiescent in management of concerns in respect of which
it is the high tradition of English statesmanship that the political
game shall not be played.In such circumstances no opening for able
young men.But, suppose they could induce some blatant, irresponsible
person, persistently to put groundless questions, and make insinuations
derogatory to the character of British statesmen at home and British
officials abroad?Then they step in, and, amid applause on both sides of
House, knock over the intruder.Sort of game of House of Commons
nine-pins.Nine-pin doesn't care so that it's noticed; admirable
practice for young Parliamentary Hands._Invaluable to Budding Statesmen._]

This is SARK'S suggestion of explanation of phenomenon.Fancy much
simpler one might be found.To-night BARTLETT-ELLIS in better luck.Turns upon ATTORNEY-GENERAL; darkly hints that escape of JABEZ was a
put-up job, of which Law Officers of the Crown might, an' they would,
disclose some interesting particulars.RIGBY, who, when he bends his
step towards House of Commons, seems to leave all his shrewdness and
knowledge of the world in his chambers, rose to the fly; played
BASHMEAD-ARTLETT'S obvious game by getting angry, and delivering long
speech whilst progress of votes, hitherto going on swimmingly, was
arrested for fully an hour._Business done._--Supply voted with both hands._Tuesday._--A precious sight, one worthy of the painter's or sculptor's
art, to see majestic figure of SQUIRE OF MALWOOD standing between House
of Lords and imminent destruction.Irish members and Radicals opposite
have sworn to have blood of the Peers.SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE is
taking the waters elsewhere.Sat up
all last night, the Radicals trying to get at the Lords by the kitchen
entrance; SQUIRE withstanding them till four o'clock in the morning.Education Vote on, involving expenditure of six
millions and welfare of innumerable children.Afterwards the Post Office
Vote, upon which the Postmaster-General, ST.ARNOLD-LE-GRAND, endeavours
to reply to HENNIKER-HEATON without betraying consciousness of bodily
existence of such a person.These matters of great and abiding interest;
but only few members present to discuss them.The rest waiting outside
till the lists are cleared and battle rages once more round citadel of
the Lords sullenly sentineled by detachment from the Treasury Bench.When engagement reopened SQUIRE gone for his holiday trip, postponed by
the all-night sitting, JOHN MORLEY on guard.Breaks force of assault by
protest that the time is inopportune.By-and-by the Lords shall be
handed over to tender mercies of gentlemen below gangway.Not just now,
and not in this particular way.CHIEF SECRETARY remembers famous case of
absentee landlord not to be intimidated by the shooting of his agent.So
Lords, he urges, not to be properly punished for throwing out Evicted
Tenants Bill by having the salaries of the charwomen docked, and BLACK
ROD turned out to beg his bread.Radicals at least not to be denied satisfaction of division.Salaries
of House of Lords staff secured for another year by narrow majority
of 31._Wednesday._--The SQUIRE OF MALWOOD at last got off for his well-earned
holiday.Carries with him consciousness of having done supremely well
amid difficulties of peculiar complication.As JOSEPH in flush of
unexpected and still unexplained frankness testified, the Session will
in its accomplished work beat the record of any in modern times.The
SQUIRE been admirably backed by a rare team of colleagues; but in House
of Commons everything depends on the Leader.Had the Session been a
failure, upon his head would have fallen obloquy.As it has been a
success, his be the praise."Well, good bye," said JOHN MORLEY, tears standing in his tender eyes as
he wrung the hand of the almost Lost Leader."But you know it's not all
over yet.What shall we do if WEIR comes
up on Second Reading?""Oh, dam WEIR," said the SQUIRE.For a moment thought a usually
equable temper had been ruffled by the almost continuous work of twenty
months, culminating in an all-night sitting.On reflection he saw that
the SQUIRE was merely adapting an engineering phrase, describing a
proceeding common enough on river courses.The only point on which
remark open to criticism is that it is tautological._Business done._--Appropriation Bill brought in._Thursday._--GEORGE NEWNES looked in just now; much the same as ever;
the same preoccupied, almost pensive look; a mind weighed down by
ever-multiplying circulation.Troubled with consideration of proposal
made to him to publish special edition of _Strand Magazine_ in tongue
understanded of the majority of the peoples of India.Has conquered
the English-speaking race from Chatham to Chattanooga, from Southampton
to Sydney.The poor Indian brings his annas, and begs a boon.Meanwhile one of the candidates for vacant Poet Laureateship has broken
out into elegiac verse."NEWNES," he exclaims,

  "NEWNES, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;
  Though not of royal, yet of hallowed line."That sort of thing would make some men vain.There is no couplet to
parallel it since the famous one written by POPE on a place frequented
by a Sovereign whose death is notorious, a place where

  Great ANNA, whom three realms obey,
  Did sometimes counsel take and sometimes tea.The poet, whose volume bears the proudly humble pseudonym "A Village
Peasant," should look in at the House of Commons and continue his
studies.There are a good many of us here worth a poet's attention.SARK
says the thing is easy enough."Toss 'em off in no time," says he."There's the SQUIRE now, who has not lately referred to his Plantagenet
parentage.Apostrophising him in Committee on Evicted Tenants Bill one
might have said:--

  SQUIRE, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;
  Though not of hallowed yet of royal line."_Business done._--Appropriation Bill read second time.Sir WILFRID LAWSON and others said "Dam."_Saturday._--Appropriation Bill read third time this morning.Prorogation served with five o'clock tea.said one of the House of Commons waiters loitering at the
gateway of Palace Yard and replying to inquiring visitor from the
country.[Illustration: THE IMPERIAL SHEFFIELD NINE-PIN.*       *       *       *       *

TO DOROTHY.(_My Four-year-old Sweetheart._)

  To make sweet hay I was amazed to find
    You absolutely did not know the way,
  Though when you did, it seemed much to your mind
                  To make sweet hay.You were kind
  Enough to answer, "Why, _of course_, you may."I kissed your pretty face with hay entwined,
  We made sweet hay.But what will Mother say
    If in a dozen years we're still inclined
                  To make sweet hay?*       *       *       *       *

Alternative spellings retained.David's [Watson]
deprived for simony.[88] The city of Moscow burnt by the throwing of
squibs.[Footnote 88: _Ante_, p.There was in this week an eclipse of the sun, at
which many were frightened by the predictions of the astrologers.I
remember fifty years ago that many were so terrified by Lilly, that they
dared not go out of their houses.A strange earthquake at New Batavia,
in the East Indies.My worthy brother died at Wotton, in the 83d year of
his age, of perfect memory and understanding.He was religious, sober,
and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house
the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free
entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was
never free.There were sometimes twenty persons more than his family,
and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by
this he gained the universal love of the county.He was born at Wotton,
went from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford,
thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but
without intention to study the law as a profession.He married the
daughter of Colwall, of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire,
by whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George her son an
infant, who being educated liberally, after traveling abroad, returned
and married one Mrs.Gore, by whom he had several children, but only
three daughters survived.He was a young man of good understanding, but,
over-indulging his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary
to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.My brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady, relict of Sir
John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy and ancient Staffordshire
family, by whom he had several children of both sexes.This lady died,
leaving only two daughters and a son.The younger daughter died before
marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and
learned gentleman (son of Sir ---- Wych), who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland.Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of
---- Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable family, but left a widow
without any child living; he died about 1691, and his wife not many
years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me.His
sister, Wych, had a portion of L6,000, to which was added L300 more; the
three other daughters, with what I added, had about L5,000 each.My
brother died on the 5th of October, in a good old age and great
reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, etc.She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than
as a private gentleman.There were, as I computed, above 2,000 persons
at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last
honors.I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and
family.After an unusual warm and pleasant season, we were
surprised with a very sharp frost.I presented my "_Acetaria_,"
dedicated to my Lord Chancellor, who returned me thanks in an
extraordinarily civil letter.There happened this week so thick a mist and fog,
that people lost their way in the streets, it being so intense that no
light of candles, or torches, yielded any (or but very little)
direction.Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and Kensington on both
sides, and while coaches and travelers were passing.It began about four
in the afternoon, and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it.At the Thames, they beat drums to direct the watermen to
make the shore.At our chapel in the evening there was a sermon
preached by young Mr.Horneck, chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's
funeral had been celebrated magnificently the Thursday before.A
panegyric was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary piety and
excellently employed life of this amiable young lady.She died in
childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who
ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his
life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the
mode of this dissolute age.Her devotion, early piety, charity,
fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying,
recollections in her own handwriting of what she heard and read, and her
conversation were most exemplary.Blackwell's election to be the next
year's Boyles Lecturer.Such horrible robberies and murders were committed, as had not been
known in this nation; atheism, profaneness, blasphemy, among all sorts,
portended some judgment if not amended; on which a society was set on
foot, who obliged themselves to endeavor the reforming of it, in London
and other places, and began to punish offenders and put the laws in more
strict execution; which God Almighty prosper!A gentle, calm, dry,
temperate weather all this season of the year, but now came sharp, hard
frost, and mist, but calm.Calm, bright, and warm as in the middle of April.So
continued on 21st of January.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of the Irish
forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart for discharging the
vast national debt.They called some great persons in the highest
offices in question for setting the Great Seal to the pardon of an
arch-pirate,[89] who had turned pirate again, and brought prizes into
the West Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey; but
the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers, out-voted the
complaints, not by being more in number, but by the country party being
negligent in attendance.[Footnote 89: Captain Kidd; he was hanged about two years afterward
    with some of his accomplices.This was one of the charges brought by
    the Commons against Lord Somers.]14th January, 1699-1700.Stringfellow, who had been made the first preacher at our chapel by
the Bishop of Lincoln [Dr.Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St.Martin's by dispensation, and put in one Mr.Sandys, much against the
inclination of those who frequented the chapel.The Scotch book about
Darien was burned by the hangman by vote of Parliament.[90]

    [Footnote 90: The volume alluded to was "An Enquiry into the Causes
    of the Miscarriage of the Scots Colony at Darien: Or an Answer to a
    Libel," entitled "A Defense of the Scots abdicating Darien."See
    Votes of the House of Commons, 15th January, 1699-1700.]Died the Duke of Beaufort, a person of great honor,
prudence, and estate.I went to Wotton, the first time after my brother's
funeral, to furnish the house with necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew
Glanville, the executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's.The weather was now altering into sharp and hard
frost.[Sidenote: LONDON]

One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons on King Charles's
Martyrdom, told them that the observation of that day was not intended
out of any detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other Kings
and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves toward their subjects,
lest they should come to the same end.This was so resented that, though
it was usual to desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one should preach
before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.The Parliament voted against the Scots settling in
Darien as being prejudicial to our trade with Spain.They also voted
that the exorbitant number of attorneys be lessened (now indeed
swarming, and evidently causing lawsuits and disturbance, eating out the
estates of the people, provoking them to go to law).Mild and calm season, with gentle frost, and little
mizzling rain.Martin's frequently preached at Trinity
chapel in the afternoon.The season was like April for warmth and
mildness.--11th.On Wednesday, was a sermon at our chapel, to be
continued during Lent.I was at the funeral of my Lady Temple, who was buried
at Islington, brought from Addiscombe, near Croydon.She left my
son-in-law Draper (her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very
nobly and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with plate and
jewels, to the value in all of about L20,000.She was a very prudent
lady, gave many great legacies, with L500 to the poor of Islington,
where her husband, Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without
issue.The season warm, gentle, and exceedingly pleasant.Divers persons of quality entered into the Society for Reformation[91]
of Manners; and some lectures were set up, particularly in the city of
London.The most eminent of the clergy preached at Bow Church, after
reading a declaration set forth by the King to suppress the growing
wickedness; this began already to take some effect as to common
swearing, and oaths in the mouths of people of all ranks.[Footnote 91: _Ante_, p.Burnet preached to-day before the Lord Mayor and a
very great congregation, on Proverbs xxvii.5, 6, "Open rebuke is better
than secret love; the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of
an enemy."He made a very pathetic discourse concerning the necessity
and advantage of friendly correction.The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in obtaining a divorce
from his wife by the Parliament for adultery with Sir John Germaine, a
Dutch gamester, of mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the Duke
had leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the
Dukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, <DW7>s indeed,
but very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father.The now
Duke their uncle is a Protestant.The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as
commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment
of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great
measure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably.That this might be done without
suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member
of either House should be in the commission.The great contest between
the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and
rejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King
Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.This was
carried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the
Court, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph
of the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and
those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland.Pity it is,
that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this
nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side
heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too
far.Among the rest, there passed a law as to <DW7>s' estates, that if
one turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass
to his next Protestant heir.This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only
the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the
indiscreet insolence of the <DW7>s here, going in triumphant and public
processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers
places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their
party.This week there was a great change of State officers.The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of
Jersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat.Vernon,
Secretary of State, was put out.The Seal was taken from the Lord
Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of
votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons.This
being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in
this fluctuating conjuncture.It is certain that this Chancellor was a
most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior
pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in
place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their
jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which
protected the people from tyranny.A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,
and a propitious year.The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on
which depended an estate of L1,500 a year; the verdict was given for Sir
Walter, 19th.Serjeant Wright at last accepted the Great Seal.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

24th May, 1700.I went from Dover street to Wotton, for the rest of the
summer, and removed thither the rest of my goods from Sayes Court.A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing showers.In the afternoon, our clergyman had a catechism,
which was continued for some time.I was visited with illness, but it pleased God that I
recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him by me, and that he has
again so graciously advertised me of my duty to prepare for my latter
end, which at my great age, cannot be far off.The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, died of the
smallpox.I went to Harden, which was originally a barren warren
bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who built there a pretty house, and made
such alteration by planting not only an infinite store of the best
fruit; but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and
solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign
country, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,
holly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so
that I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren
condition, was in admiration of it.The land was bought of Sir John
Evelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement
by the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen.He and his lady
received us with great civility.The tombs in the church at Croydon of
Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and
venerable; but none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance and
carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge could not cost less than
L700 or L800.I went to Beddington, the ancient seat of the
Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure, capacious, and in form
of the buildings of the age of Henry VIII.and Queen Elizabeth, and
proper for the old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the first orange
trees[92] that had been seen in England, planted in the open ground, and
secured in winter only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees, and laden with
fruit, were now in decay, as well as the grotto, fountains, cabinets,
and other curiosities in the house and abroad, it being now fallen to a
child under age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation.The estate and park about it also in decay.[Footnote 92: Oranges were eaten in this kingdom much earlier than
    the time of King James I.]Pepys at Clapham, where he has
a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with
Indian and Chinese curiosities.The offices and gardens well
accommodated for pleasure and retirement.My birthday now completed the 80th year of my age.I
with my soul render thanks to God, who, of his infinite mercy, not only
brought me out of many troubles, but this year restored me to health,
after an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my sight,
hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable, which I implore him
to continue, with the pardon of my sins past, and grace to acknowledge
by my improvement of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his
pleasure to protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for my
last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed Savior, the Lord
Jesus, Amen!Came the news of my dear grandson (the only male of
my family now remaining) being fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford,
which after the dire effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted
me; but so it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at his
first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr.Mander (Head of
the college and now Vice Chancellor), who caused him to be brought and
lodged in his own bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his recovery, to our
infinite comfort.We had a letter every day either from the Vice
Chancellor himself, or his tutor.Assurance of his recovery by a letter from himself.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was a change of great officers at Court.Lord Godolphin returned
to his former station of first Commissioner of the Treasury; Sir Charles
Hedges, Secretary of State.At the Royal Society, Lord Somers, the late
Chancellor, was continued President.Great alterations of officers at Court, and
elsewhere,--Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he was a learned man in his
profession, of which we have now few, never fewer; the Chancery
requiring so little skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can
talk eloquently in that Court; so that probably few care to study the
law to any purpose.Lord Marlborough Master of the Ordnance, in place of
Lord Romney made Groom of the Stole.The Earl of Rochester goes Lord
Lieutenant to Ireland.I finished the sale of North Stoake in Sussex to
Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother to be sold for payment of
portions to my nieces, and other incumbrances on the estate.An exceeding deep snow, and melted away as suddenly.Severe frost, and such a tempest as threw down many
chimneys, and did great spoil at sea, and blew down above twenty trees
of mine at Wotton.Harley, an able
gentleman, chosen.Our countryman, Sir Richard Onslow, had a party for
him.By an order of the House of Commons, I laid before
the Speaker the state of what had been received and paid toward the
building of Greenwich Hospital.Wye, Rector of Wotton, died, a very worthy good man.Bohun, a learned person and excellent preacher, who had been my
son's tutor, and lived long in my family.I let Sayes Court to Lord Carmarthen, son to the Duke
of Leeds.I went to the funeral of my sister Draper, who was
buried at Edmonton in great state.Davenant displeased the clergy
now met in Convocation by a passage in his book, p.A Dutch boy of about eight or nine years old was carried
about by his parents to show, who had about the iris of one eye the
letters of _Deus meus_, and of the other _Elohim_, in the Hebrew
character.How this was done by artifice none could imagine; his parents
affirming that he was so born.It did not prejudice his sight, and he
seemed to be a lively playing boy.Everybody went to see him; physicians
and philosophers examined it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.The Duke of Norfolk died of an apoplexy, and Mr.Thomas
Howard of complicated disease since his being cut for the stone; he was
one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.Some Kentish men, delivering a petition to the House of
Commons, were imprisoned.[93]

    [Footnote 93: Justinian Champneys, Thomas Culpepper, William
    Culpepper, William Hamilton, and David Polhill, gentlemen of
    considerable property and family in the county.There is a very good
    print of them in five ovals on one plate, engraved by R. White, in
    1701.They desired the Parliament to mind the public more, and their
    private heats less.They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited.A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of
calling the assembly and dissolving.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th June, 1701.The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness.He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary L500 per annum.My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer.There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs.Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.Wise, who was there to receive
me.The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth L10,000 to the lawyers.His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear.He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire.It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices.He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week.Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor.I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr.Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02.At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr.Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters.Our relation and friendship had been long and
great.He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after.This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea.He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune.He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to L1,900.The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction.Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed L10 per annum
toward the carrying it on.We agreed that every missioner, besides the
L20 to set him forth, should have L50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him L100 per annum.We
sent a young divine to New York.I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr.Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty.Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party.The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me.I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age.I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul.My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox.He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St.Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire L5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above L30,000 a year in places and employments, with L50,000 at
interest.He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater.He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future.[Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo.fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the
House.Oglethorpe was disarmed.The Bill against occasional
conformity was lost by one vote.Corn and provisions so cheap that the
farmers are unable to pay their rents.[Sidenote: LONDON]

February, 1703.A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr.Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate.The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox.A great
earthquake at Rome, etc.A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her L500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices.She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above L1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity.went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr.Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity.He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation.His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially.Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir.Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr.Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished.I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer.From August 1696, there had been
expended in building L89,364 14s.This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics.55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state.I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703.The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal.As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age.I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment.After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.[Footnote 95: Charles III., afterward Emperor of Germany, by the
    title of Charles VI.]The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a year.The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world.He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning.This is a serious
alarm to me.He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb.He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr.Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.[Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.][Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1704.This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc.The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned.Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner.The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels.Music and
trumpets at every city company.The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St.After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St.The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night.Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.[Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr.Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature.He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain.I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.Agues and smallpox much in
every place.Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant.A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton.The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age.She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members.I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr.I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr.King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations.He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St.John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705.Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless L2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice.His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got L100,000 and made
themselves Barons.Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in.An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen.There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom.Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

     his voyage to France for supplies with Col.20, 1782) to Robert Morris, Paine
     mentions that when Col.Laurens proposed that he should
     accompany him, as secretary, he was on the point of
     establishing a newspaper.He had purchased twenty reams of
     paper, and Mr.Eustatia for seventy
     more.This scheme, which could hardly fail of success, was
     relinquished for the voyage.It was undertaken at the urgent
     solicitation of Laurens, and Paine certainly regarded it as
     official.He had ninety dollars when he started, in bills of
     exchange; when Col.Laurens left him, after their return,
     he had but two louis d'or.The Memorial sent by Paine to
     Congress (Jan.21, 1808) recapitulated facts known to my
     reader.George Clinton, Jr.,
     February 4, and referred to the Committee of Claims.On
     February 14th Paine wroth a statement concerning the $3,000
     given him (1785) by Congress, which he maintained was an
     indemnity for injustice done him in the Deane case.The Committee consulted the
     President, whose reply I know not.Vice-President Clinton
     wrote (Mardi 23, 1808) that  from the information I received
     at the time I have reason to believe that Mr.Paine
     accompanied Col.Laurens on his mission to France in the
     course of our revolutionary war, for the purpose of
     negotiating a loan, and that he acted as his secretary on
     that occasion; but although I have no doubt of the truth of
     this fact, I cannot assert it from my own actual knowledge."There was nothing found on the journals of Congress to show
     Paine's connection with the mission.The old author was
     completely upset by his longing to hear the fate of his
     memorial, and he Wrote two complaints of the delay, showing
     that his nerves were shattered.he says, March 7th,
     "my memorial was referred to the Committee of Claims for the
     purpose of losing it, it is unmanly policy.After so many
     years of service my heart grows cold towards America."The letters are those of a broken-hearted man, and it seems marvellous
that Jefferson, Madison, and the Clintons did not intervene and see that
some recognition of Paine's former services, by those who should not
have forgotten them, was made without the ill-judged memorial.While
they were enjoying their grandeur the man who, as Jefferson wrote,
"steadily laboured, and with as much effect as any man living," to
secure America freedom, was living--or rather dying--in a miserable
lodging-house, 63 Partition Street.He had gone there for economy; for
he was exhibiting that morbid apprehension about his means which is
a well-known symptom of decline in those who have suffered poverty in
early life.Washington, with 40,000 acres, wrote in his last year as if
facing ruin.Paine had only a little farm at New Rochelle.He had for
some time suffered from want of income, and at last had to sell the farm
he meant for the Bonnevilles for $10,000; but the purchaser died, and at
his widow's appeal the contract was cancelled.It was at this time that
he appealed to Congress.It appears, however, that Paine was not anxious
for himself, but for the family of Madame Bonneville, whose statement on
this point is important.The last letter that I can find of Paine's was: written to Jefferson,
July 8, 1808:

"The british Ministry have out-schemed themselves.It is not difficult
to see what the motive and object of that Ministry: were in issuing
the orders of Council.They expected those orders would force all the
commerce of the United States to England, and then, by giving permission
to such cargoes as they did not want for themselves to depart for the
Continent of Europe, to raise a revenue out of those countries and
America.'But instead of this they have lost revenue; that is, they
have-lost the revenue they used to receive from American imports, and
instead of gaining all the commerce they have lost it all."This being the case with the british Ministry it is natural to suppose
they would be glad to tread back their steps, if they could do it
without too much exposing their ignorance and obstinacy.The Embargo
law empowers the President to suspend its operation whenever he shall be
satisfied that our ships can pass in safety.It therefore includes the
idea of empowering him to use means for arriving at that event.Suppose
the President were to authorise Mr.Pinckney to propose to the british
Ministry that the United States would negociate with France for
rescinding the Milan Decree, on condition the English Ministry would
rescind their orders of Council; and in that case the United States
would recall their Embargo.France and England stand now at such a
distance that neither can propose any thing to the other, neither are
there any neutral powers to act as mediators.The U. S. is the only
power that can act."Perhaps the british Ministry if they listen to the proposal will want
to add to it the Berlin decree, which excludes english commerce from the
continent of Europe; but this we have nothing to do with, neither has it
any thing to do with the Embargo.The british Orders of Council and the
Milan decree are parallel cases, and the cause of the Embargo.Paines last letters to the President are characteristic.One pleads for
American intervention to stay the hand of French oppression among the
<DW64>s in St.Domingo; for the colonization of Louisiana with free
<DW64> laborers; and his very last letter is an appeal for mediation
between France and England for the sake of peace.Nothing came of these pleadings of Paine; but perhaps on his last stroll
along the Hudson, with his friend Fulton, to watch the little steamer,
he may have recognized the real mediator beginning its labors for the
federation of the world.Early in July, 1808, Paine removed to a comfortable abode, that of Mrs.Ryder, near which Madame Bonneville and her two sons resided.The house
was on Herring Street (afterwards 293 Bleecker), and not far, he might
be pleased to find, from "Reason Street."Here he made one more attempt
to wield his pen,--the result being a brief letter "To the Federal
Faction," which he warns that they are endangering American commerce by
abusing France and Bonaparte, provoking them to establish a navigation
act that will exclude American ships from Europe."The United States
have flourished, unrivalled in commerce, fifteen or sixteen years.But
it is not a permanent state of things.It arose from the circumstances
of the war, and most probably will change at the close of the present
war.The Federalists give provocation enough to promote it."Apparently this is the last letter Paine ever sent to the printer.The
year passed peacefully away; indeed there is reason to believe that
from the middle of July, 1808, to the end of January, 1809, he fairly
enjoyed existence.During this time he made acquaintance with the worthy
Willett Hicks, watchmaker, who was a Quaker preacher.His conversations
with Willett Hicks--whose cousin, Elias Hicks, became such an
important figure in the Quaker Society twenty years later--were
fruitful.Towards the latter part of
January, 1809, Paine was very feeble.On the 18th he wrote and signed
his Will, in which he reaffirms his theistic faith.On February 1st
the Committee of Claims reported unfavorably on his memorial, while
recording, "That Mr.Paine rendered great and eminent services to the
United States during their struggle for liberty and independence cannot
be doubted by any person acquainted with his labours in the cause, and
attached to the principles of the contest."On February 25th he had some
fever, and a doctor was sent for.Ryder attributed the attack
to Paine's having stopped taking stimulants, and their resumption was
prescribed.About a fortnight later symptoms of dropsy appeared.Towards
the end of April Paine was removed to a house on the spot now occupied
by No.59 Grove Street, Madame Bonneville taking up her abode under
the same roof.The owner was William A. Thompson, once a law partner
of Aaron Burr, whose wife, _nee_ Maria Holdron, was a niece of Elihu
Palmer.The whole of the back part of the house (which was in a lot, no
street being then cut) was given up to Paine.*

     * The topographical facts were investigated by John Randel,
     Jr., Civil Engineer, at the request of David C. Valentine,
     Clerk of the Common Council, New York, his report being
     rendered April 6, 1864.Reports of neglect of Paine by Madame Bonneville have been credited by
some, but are unfounded She gave all the time she could to the sufferer,
and did her best for him.Willett Hicks sometimes called, and his
daughter (afterwards Mrs.Cheese-man) used to take Paine delicacies.The
only procurable nurse was a woman named Hedden, who combined piety and
artfulness.Paine's physician was the most distinguished in New York,
Dr.Romaine, but nurse Hedden managed to get into the house one
Dr.Manly, who turned out to be Cheetham's spy.Manly afterwards
contributed to Cheetham's book a lying letter, in which he claimed
to have been Paine's physician.It will be seen, however, by Madame
Bonneville's narrative to Cobbett, that Paine was under the care of
his friend.As Manly, assuming that he called as many did,
never saw Paine alone, he was unable to assert that Paine recanted, but
he converted the exclamations of the sufferer into prayers to Christ.*

     * Another claimant to have been Paine's physician has been
     cited.In 1876 (N. Y, Observer) Feb.Wickham
     reported from a late Dr.Matson Smith, of New Rochelle, that
     he had been Paine's physician, and witnessed his
     drunkenness.Unfortunately for Wickham he makes Smith say it
     was on his farm where Paine "spent his latter days."Paine
     was not on his farm for two years before his death.Smith
     could never have attended Paine unless in 1803, when he had
     a slight trouble with his hands,--the only illness he ever
     had at New Rochelle,--while the guest of a neighbor, who
     attests his sobriety.Smith is
     living, Mr.Albert Willcox, who writes me his recollection
     of what Smith told him of Paine.Neither drunkenness, nor
     any item of Wickham's report is mentioned.He said Paine
     was afraid of death, but could only have heard it.The god of wrath who ruled in New York a hundred years, through the
ministerial prerogatives, was guarded by a Cerberean legend.The
three alternatives of the heretic were, recantation, special judgment,
terrible death.Before Paine's arrival in America, the excitement on
his approach had tempted a canny Scot, Donald Fraser, to write an
anticipated "Recantation" for him, the title-page being cunningly
devised so as to imply that there had been an actual recantation.On his
arrival in New York, Paine found it necessary to call Fraser to account,
The Scotchman pleaded that he had vainly tried to earn a living as
fencing-master, preacher, and school-teacher, but had got eighty dollars
for writing the "Recantation."Paine said: "I am glad you found the
expedient a successful shift for your needy family; but write no more
concerning Thomas Paine.I am satisfied with your acknowledgment--try
something more worthy of a man."*

     * Dr.Francis' "Old New York," p.The second mouth of Cerberus was noisy throughout the land; revivalists
were describing in New Jersey how some "infidel" had been struck blind
in Virginia, and in Virginia how one was struck dumb in New Jersey.But here was the very head and front of what they called "infidelity,"
Thomas Paine, who ought to have gathered in his side a sheaf of
thunderbolts, preserved by more marvellous "providences" than any
sectarian saint.Out of one hundred and sixty carried to the guillotine
from his prison, he alone was saved, by the accident of a chalk mark
affixed to the wrong side of his cell door.On two ships he prepared
to return to America, but was prevented; one sank at sea, the other was
searched by the British for him particularly.And at the very moment
when New Rochelle disciples were calling down fire on his head,
Christopher Dederick tried vainly to answer the imprecation; within a
few feet of Paine, his gun only shattered the window at which the author
sat."Providence must be as bad as Thomas Paine," wrote the old deist.This amounted to a sort of contest like that of old between the
prophets of Baal and those of Jehovah.The deists were crying to their
antagonists: "Perchance he sleepeth."If Paine
was spared, what heretic need tremble?But he reached his threescore
years and ten in comfort; and the placard of Satan flying off with him
represented a last hope.Skepticism and rationalism were not understood by pious people a hundred
years ago.Renan thinks
he will have his legend in France modelled after Judas.But no educated
Christian conceives of a recantation or extraordinary death-bed for a
Darwin, a Parker, an Emerson.Brad-laugh had some fear that
he might be a posthumous victim of the "infidel's legend."In 1875, when
he was ill in St Luke's Hospital, New York, he desired me to question
the physicians and nurses, that I might, if necessary, testify to his
fearlessness and fidelity to his views in the presence of death.But he
has died without the "legend," whose decline dates from Paine's case;
that was its crucial challenge.The whole nation had recently been thrown into a wild excitement by
the fall of Alexander Hamilton in a duel with Aaron Burr.Hamilton's
world-liness had been notorious, but the clergymen (Bishop Moore and the
Presbyterian John Mason) reported his dying words of unctuous piety and
orthodoxy.John Mason, Paine said:

"Between you and your rival in communion ceremonies, Dr.Moore of the
Episcopal church, you have, in order to make yourselves appear of
some importance, reduced General Hamilton's character to that of a
feeble-minded man, who in going out of the world wanted a passport from
a priest.Which of you was first applied to for this purpose is a matter
of no consequence.The man, sir, who puts his trust and confidence in
God, that leads a just and moral life, and endeavors to do good, does
not trouble himself about priests when his hour of departure comes, nor
permit priests to trouble themselves about him."The words were widely commented on, and both sides looked forward,
almost as if to a prize-fight, to the hour when the man who had unmade
thrones, whether in earth or heaven, must face the King of Terrors.Since Michael and Satan had their legendary combat for the body of
Moses, there was nothing like it.In view of the pious raids on Paine's
death-bed, freethinkers have not been quite fair.To my own mind, some
respect is due to those humble fanatics, who really believed that Paine
was approaching eternal fires, and had a frantic desire to save him.*

     * Nor should it be forgotten that several liberal
     Christians, like Hicks, were friendly towards Paine at the
     close of his life, whereas his most malignant enemies were
     of his own "Painite" household, Carver and Cheetham.William Erving tells me that he remembers an English
     clergyman in New York, named Cunningham, who used to visit
     his (Erving's) father.He heard him say that Paine and he
     were friends; and that "the whole fault was that people
     hectored Paine, and made him say things he would never say
     to those who treated him as a gentleman."Paine had no fear of death; Madame Bonneville's narrative shows that his
fear was rather of living too long.But he had some such fear as that of
Voltaire when entering his house at Fernay after it began to lighten.He was not afraid of the lightning, he said, but of what the neighboring
priest would make of it should he be struck.Paine had some reason to
fear that the zealots who had placarded the devil flying away with him
might fulfil their prediction by body-snatching.His unwillingness to be
left alone, ascribed to superstitious terror, was due to efforts to
get a recantation from him, so determined that he dare not be without
witnesses.While living with Jarvis, two years
before, he desired him to bear witness that he maintained his theistic
convictions to the last.Jarvis merrily proposed that he should make a
sensation by a mock recantation, but the author said, "Tom Paine never
told a lie."When he knew that his illness was mortal he solemnly
reaffirmed these opinions in the presence of Madame Bonneville, Dr.Haskin, Captain Pelton, and Thomas Nixon.* The nurse
Hedden, if the Catholic Bishop of Boston (Fenwick) remembered accurately
thirty-seven years later, must have conspired to get him into the
patient's room, from which, of course, he was stormily expelled.But the
Bishop's story is so like a pious novelette that, in the absence of
any mention of his visit by Madame Bonneville, herself a Catholic, one
cannot be sure that the interview he waited so long to report did not
take place in some slumberous episcopal chamber in Boston.**

     * Sec the certificate of Nixon and Pelton to Cobbett (Vale,
     p.** Bishop Fenwick's narrative (U. S. Catholic Magazine,
     1846) is quoted in the N. Y. Observer\ September 27, 1877.(Extremes become friends when a freethinker is to be
     crucified.)It was rumored that Paine's adherents were keeping him under the
influence of liquor in order that he might not recant,--so convinced,
at heart, or enamoured of Calvinism was this martyr of Theism, who
had published his "Age of Reason" from the prison where he awaited the
guillotine.*

     * Engineer Randel (orthodox), in his topographical report to
     the Clerk of the City Council (1864), mentions that the
     "very worthy mechanic," Amasa Wordsworth, who saw Paine
     daily, told him "there was no truth in such report, and that
     Thomas Paine had declined saying anything on that subject
     [religion]."Francis, "clung to his
     infidelity to the last moment of his natural life."Francis (orthodox) heard that Paine yielded to King Alcohol,
     but says Cheetham wrote with "settled malignity," and
     suspects "sinister motives" in his "strictures on the fruits
     of unbelief in the degradation of the wretched Paine."Of what his principles had cost him Paine had near his end a reminder
that cut him to the heart.Albert Gallatin had remained his friend, but
his connections, the Fews and Nicholsons, had ignored the author they
once idolized.The woman for whom he had the deepest affection, in
America, had been Kitty Nicholson, now Mrs.Henry Adams, in his
biography of Gallatin, says: "When confined to his bed with his last
illness he [Paine] sent for Mrs.Few, who came to see him, and when they
parted she spoke some words of comfort and religious hope.Poor Paine
only turned his face to the wall, and kept silence."According to Rick-man, Sherwin, and Vale, Mr.Few came of their own accord, and "Mrs.Few expressed a wish to
renew their former friendship."Paine said to her, "very impressively,
'You have neglected me, and I beg that you will leave the room.'Few went into the garden and wept bitterly."I doubt this tradition
also, but it was cruelly tantalizing for his early friend, after
ignoring him six years, to return with Death.If, amid tortures of this kind, the annoyance of fanatics and the
"Painites" who came to watch them, and the paroxysms of pain, the
sufferer found relief in stimulants, the present writer can only reflect
with satisfaction that such resource existed.For some time no food
would stay on his stomach.In such weakness and helplessness he was for
a week or so almost as miserable as the Christian spies could desire,
and his truest friends were not sorrowful when the peace of death
approached.After the years in which the stories of Paine's wretched
end have been accumulating, now appears the testimony of the Catholic
lady,--persons who remember Madame Bonneville assure me that she was a
perfect lady,--that Paine's mind was active to the last, that shortly
before death he made a humorous retort to Dr.Romaine, that he died
after a tranquil night.Paine died at eight o'clock on the morning of June 8, 1809.Shortly
before, two clergymen had invaded his room, and so soon as they spoke
about his opinions Paine said: "Let me alone; good morning!"Madame
Bonneville asked if he was satisfied with the treatment he had received
in her house, and he said "Oh yes."These were the last words of Thomas
Paine.On June 10th Paine's friends assembled to look on his face for the last
time.Madame Bonneville took a rose from her breast and laid it on that
of her dead benefactor.His adherents were busy men, and mostly poor;
they could not undertake the then difficult journey (nearly twenty-five
miles) to the grave beyond New Rochelle.Of the _cortege_ that followed
Paine a contemptuous account was printed (Aug.7th) in the London
Packet:

"Extract of a letter dated June 20th, Philadelphia, written by a
gentleman lately returned from a tour: 'On my return from my journey,
when I arrived near Harlem, on York island, I met the funeral of Tom
Paine on the road.The followers were
two <DW64>s, the next a carriage with six drunken Irishmen, then a
riding chair with two men in it, one of whom was asleep, and then an
Irish Quaker on horseback.I stopped my sulkey to ask the Quaker what
funeral it was; he said it was Paine, and that his friends as well as
his enemies were all glad that he was gone, for he had tired his friends
out by his intemperance and frailties.I told him that Paine had done
a great deal of mischief in the world, and that, if there was any
purgatory, he certainly would have a good share of it before the devil
would let him go.The Quaker replied, he would sooner take his chance
with Paine than any man in New York, on that score.He then put his
horse on a trot, and left me.'"The funeral was going to West Chester; one of the vehicles contained
Madame Bonneville and her children; and the Quaker was not an Irishman.I have ascertained that a Quaker did follow Paine, and that it was
Willett Hicks.Hicks, who has left us his testimony that Paine was "a
good man, and an honest man," may have said that Paine's friends were
glad that he was gone, for it was only humane to so feel, but all
said about "intemperance and frailties" is doubtless a gloss of the
correspondent, like the "drunken Irishmen" substituted for Madame
Bonneville and her family.Could the gentleman of the sulky have appreciated the historic dignity
of that little _cortege_ he would have turned his horse's head and
followed it.Those two <DW64>s, travelling twenty-five miles on foot,
represented the homage of a race for whose deliverance Paine had pleaded
from his first essay written in America to his recent entreaty for
the President's intervention in behalf of the slaughtered <DW64>s of
Domingo.* One of those vehicles bore the wife of an oppressed French
author, and her sons, one of whom was to do gallant service to this
country in the War of 1812, the other to explore the unknown West.Behind the Quaker preacher, who would rather take his chance in the next
world with Paine than with any man in New York, was following invisibly
another of his family and name, who presently built up Hicksite
Quakerism, the real monument of Paine, to whom unfriendly Friends
refused a grave.* "On the last day men shall wear On their heads the dust,
     As ensign and as ornament Of their lowly trust."--Hafis.The grand people of America were not there, the clergy were not there;
but beside the <DW64>s stood the Quaker preacher and the French Catholic
woman.Madame Bonneville placed her son Benjamin--afterwards General in
the United States army--at one end of the grave, and standing herself at
the other end, cried, as the earth fell on the coffin: "Oh, Mr.Paine,
my son stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I for
France!"No sooner was Paine dead than the ghoul sat gloating upon him.I found
in the Rush papers a letter from Cheetham (July 31st) to Benjamin Rush:
"Since Mr.Paine's arrival in this city from Washington, when on his way
you very properly avoided him, his life, keeping the lowest company,
has been an uninterrupted scene of filth, vulgarity, and drunkenness.As
to the reports, that on his deathbed he had something like compunctious
visitings of conscience with regard to his deistical writings and
opinions, they are altogether groundless.He resisted very angrily, and
with a sort of triumphant and obstinate pride, all attempts to draw him
from those doctrines.Much as you must have seen in the course of your
professional practice of everything that is offensive in the poorest
and most depraved of the species, perhaps you have met with nothing
excelling the miserable condition of Mr.It may indeed be said that he was totally neglected and
forgotten.Bournville (sic) a woman, I cannot say a Lady, whom
he brought with him from Paris, the wife of a Parisian of that name,
seemed desirous of hastening his death.He died at Greenwich, in a small
room he had hired in a very obscure house.He was hurried to his grave
with hardly an attending person.An ill-natured epitaph, written on him
in 1796, when it was supposed he was dead, incorrectly describes the
latter end of his life.He

     "Blasphemes the Almighty, lives in filth like a hog,
     Is abandoned in death and interr'd like a dog."The object of this letter was to obtain from Rush, for publication, some
abuse of Paine; but the answer honored Paine, save for his heresy, and
is quoted by freethinkers as a tribute.Within a year the grave opened for Cheetham also, and he sank into it
branded by the law as the slanderer of a woman's honor, and scourged by
the community as a traitor in public life.The day of Paine's death was a day of judgment.He had not been struck
blind or dumb; Satan had not carried him off; he had lived beyond
his threescore years and ten and died peacefully in his bed.The
self-appointed messengers of Zeus had managed to vex this Prometheus who
brought fire to men, but could not persuade him to whine for mercy,
nor did the predicted thunderbolts come.This immunity of Thomas Paine
brought the deity of dogma into a dilemma.It could be explained only
on the the theory of an apology made and accepted by the said deity.Plainly there had to be a recantation somewhere.Either Paine had to
recant or Dogma had to recant.The excitement was particularly strong among the Quakers, who regarded
Paine as an apostate Quaker, and perhaps felt compromised by his desire
to be buried among them.Willett Hicks told Gilbert Vale that he had
been beset by pleading questions."Did thee never hear him call on
Christ?""As for money," said Hicks, "I could have had any sum."There
was found, later on, a Quakeress, formerly a servant in the family of
Willett Hicks, not proof against such temptations.She pretended that
she was sent to carry some delicacy to Paine, and heard him cry "Lord
Jesus have mercy upon me"; she also heard him declare "if the Devil has
ever had any agency in any work he has had it in my writing that book
[the 'Age of Reason']."* Few souls are now so belated as to credit such
stories; but my readers may form some conception of the mental condition
of the community in which Paine died from the fact that such absurdities
were printed, believed, spread through the world.The Quaker servant
became a heroine, as the one divinely appointed witness of Tom Paine's
recantation.* "Life and Gospel Labors of Stephen Grellet."This
     "valuable young Friend," as Stephen Grellet calls her, had
     married a Quaker named Hinsdale.Grellet, a native of
     France, convert from Voltaire, led the anti-Hicksites, and
     was led by his partisanship to declare that Elias promised
     him to suppress his opinions!The cant of the time was that
     "deism might do to live by but not to die by."But it had
     been announced in Paine's obituaries that "some days
     previous to his demise he had an interview with some Quaker
     gentlemen on the subject [of burial in their graveyard] but
     as he declined a renunciation of his deistical opinions his
     anxious wishes were not complied with."But ten years later,
     when Hicks's deism was spreading, death-bed terrors seemed
     desirable, and Mary (Roscoe) Hinsdale, formerly Grellet's
     servant also, came forward to testify that the recantation
     refused by Paine to the "Quaker gentlemen," even for a much
     desired end, had been previously confided to her for no
     object at all!The story was published by one Charles
     Collins, a Quaker, who afterwards admitted to Gilbert Vale
     his doubts of its truth, adding "some of our friends believe
     she indulges in opiates."But in the end it was that same Mary that hastened the resurrection
of Thomas Paine.The controversy as to whether Mary was or was not a
calumniator; whether orthodoxy was so irresistible that Paine must needs
surrender at last to a servant-girl who told him she had thrown his book
into the fire; whether she was to be believed against her employer, who
declared she never saw Paine at all; all this kept Paine alive.Such boiling up from the abysses, of vulgar credulity, grotesque
superstition, such commanding illustrations of the Age of Unreason,
disgusted thoughtful Christians.*

     * The excitement of the time was well illustrated in a
     notable caricature by the brilliant artist John Wesley
     Jarvis.Paine is seen dead, his pillow "Common Sense," his
     hand holding a manuscript, "A rap on the knuckles for John
     Mason."On his arm is the label, "Answer to Bishop Watson."Under him is written: "A man who devoted his whole life to
     the attainment of two objects--rights of man and freedom of
     conscience--had his vote denied when living, and was denied
     a grave when dead!"The Catholic Father O'Brian (a
     notorious drunkard), with very red nose, kneels over Paine,
     exclaiming, "Oh you ugly drunken beast!"John
     Mason (Presbyterian) stamps on Paine, exclaiming, "Ah, Tom!thou 't get thy frying in hell; they 'll roast thee
     like a herring."They 'll put thee in the furnace hot,
     And on thee bar the door:
     How the devils all will laugh
     To hear thee burst and roar!"Livingston kicks at Paine's head, exclaiming,

     "How are the mighty fallen,
     Right fol-de-riddle-lol!"Bishop Hobart kicks the feet, tinging:
     "Right fol-de-rol, let's dance and sing,
     Tom is dead, God save the king--
     The infidel now low doth lie--
     Sing Hallelujah--hallelujah!"A Quaker turns away with a shovel, saying,
     "I 'll not bury thee."Such was the religion which was supposed by some to have won Paine's
heart at last, but which, when mirrored in the controversy over his
death, led to a tremendous reaction.The division in the Quaker Society
swiftly developed.In December, 1826, there was an afternoon meeting of
Quakers of a critical kind, some results of which led directly to the
separation.The chief speaker was Elias Hicks, but it is also recorded
that "Willet Hicks was there, and had a short testimony, which seemed to
be impressive on the meeting."He had stood in silence beside the grave
of the man whose chances in the next world he had rather take than those
of any man in New York; but now the silence is broken.*

     * Curiously enough, Mary (Roscoe) Hinsdale turned up again.She had broken down under the cross-examination of William
     Cobbett, but he had long been out of the country when the
     Quaker separation took place.Mary now reported that a
     distinguished member of the Hicksite Society, Mary Lock
     wood, had recanted in the same way as Paine.This being
     proved false, the hysterical Mary sank and remained in
     oblivion, from which she is recalled only by the Rev.Rip
     Van Winkle.It was the unique sentence on Paine to recant
     and yet be damned.This honor belies the indifference
     expressed in the rune taught children sixty years ago:

     "Poor Tom Paine!there he lies:
     Nobody laughs and nobody cries:
     Where he has gone or how he fares,
     Nobody knows and nobody cares!"I told Walt Whitman, himself partly a product of Hicksite Quakerism,
of the conclusion to which I had been steadily drawn, that Thomas Paine
rose again in Elias Hicks, and was in some sort the origin of our one
American religion.I said my visit was mainly to get his "testimony" on
the subject for my book, as he was born in Hicks' region, and mentions
in "Specimen Days" his acquaintance with Paine's friend, Colonel
Fellows.Walt said, for I took down his words at the time:

"In my childhood a great deal was said of Paine in our neighborhood, in
Long Island.My father, Walter Whitman, was rather favorable to Paine.I remember hearing Elias Hicks preach; and his look, slender figure,
earnestness, made an impression on me, though I was only about eleven.He is well represented in the bust there, one of my
treasures.I was a young man when I enjoyed the friendship of Col.Fellows,--then a constable of the courts; tall, with ruddy face,
blue eyes, snowy hair, and a fine voice; neat in dress, an old-school
gentleman, with a military air, who used to awe the crowd by his looks;
they used to call him 'Aristides.'I used to chat with him in Tammany
Hall.It was a time when, in religion, there was as yet no philosophical
middle-ground; people were very strong on one side or the other; there
was a good deal of lying, and the liars were often well paid for
their work.Paine and his principles made the great issue.Paine was
double-damnably lied about.Fellows was a man of perfect truth
and exactness; he assured me that the stories disparaging to Paine
personally were quite false.Paine was neither drunken nor filthy; he
drank as other people did, and was a high-minded gentleman.I incline to
think you right in supposing a connection between the Paine excitement
and the Hicksite movement.Paine left a deep, clear-cut impression on
the public mind.Fellows told me that while Paine was in New York
he had a much larger following than was generally supposed.After his
death a reaction in his favor appeared among many who had opposed him,
and this reaction became exceedingly strong between 1820 and 1830, when
the division among the Quakers developed.Probably William Cobbett's
conversion to Paine had something to do with it.Cobbett lived in the
neighborhood of Elias Hicks, in Long Island, and probably knew him.Hicks was a fair-minded man, and no doubt read Paine's books carefully
and honestly.I am very glad you are writing the Life of Paine.Paine was among the best and truest of men."Paine's risen soul went marching on in England also.The pretended
recantation proclaimed there was exploded by William Cobbett, and the
whole controversy over Paine's works renewed.One after another deist
was sent to prison for publishing Paine's works, the last being Richard
Carlile and his wife.In 1819, the year in which William Cobbett
carried Paine's bones to England, Richard Carlile and his wife, solely
for this offence, were sent to prison,--he for three years, with fine of
L1,500, she for two years, with fine of L500,* This was a suicidal
victory for bigotry.When these two came out of prison they found that
wealthy gentlemen had provided for them an establishment in Fleet
Street, where these books were thenceforth sold unmolested.Carlile's petition to the House of Commons awakened that body and the
whole country.When Richard Carlile entered prison it was as a captive
deist; when he came out the freethinkers of England were generally
atheists.* I have before me an old fly-leaf picture, issued by
     Carlile in the same year.It shows Paine in his chariot
     advancing against Superstition.Superstition is a snaky-
     haired demoness, with poison-cup in one hand and dagger in
     the other, surrounded by instruments of torture, and
     treading on a youth.Behind her are priests, with mask,
     crucifix, and dagger.Burning <DW19>s surround them with a
     cloud, behind which are worshippers around an idol, with a
     priest near by, upholding a crucifix before a man burning at
     the stake.Attended by fair genii, who uphold a banner
     inscribed, "Moral Rectitude."Paine advances, uplifting in
     one hand the mirror of Truth, in the other his "Age of
     Reason."There are ten stanzas describing the conflict,
     Superstition being described as holding

     "in vassalage a doating World,
     Till Paine and Reason burst upon the mind,
     And Truth and Deism their flag unfurled."Common sense and common justice were entering into religion as they were
entering into government.Such epithets as "atheism," "infidelity,"
were but labels of outlawry which the priesthood of all denominations
pronounced upon men who threatened their throne, precisely as "sedition"
was the label of outlawry fixed by Pitt on all hostility to George III.In England, atheism was an insurrection of justice against any deity
diabolical enough to establish the reign of terror in that country
or any deity worshipped by a church which imprisoned men for their
opinions.Paine was a theist, but he arose legitimately in his admirer
Shelley, who was punished for atheism.Knightly service was done by
Shelley in the struggle for the Englishman's right to read Paine.If
any enlightened religious man of to-day had to choose between the
godlessness of Shelley and the godliness that imprisoned good men for
their opinions, he would hardly select the latter.The genius of Paine
was in every word of Shelley's letter to Lord Ellenborough on the
punishment of Eaton for publishing the "Age of Reason."*

     to your religion by embittering his existence?You might
     force him by torture to profess your tenets, but he could
     not believe them except you should make them credible, which
     perhaps exceeds your power.Do you think to please the God
     you worship by this exhibition of your zeal?If so the
     demon to whom some nations offer human hecatombs is less
     barbarous than the Deity of civilized society.... Does
     the Christian God, whom his followers eulogize as the deity
     of humility and peace--he, the regenerator of the world, the
     meek reformer--authorise one man to rise against another,
     and, because lictors are at his beck, to chain and torture
     him as an infidel?When the Apostles went abroad to convert
     the nations, were they enjoined to stab and poison all who
     disbelieved the divinity of Christ's mission?...The
     time is rapidly approaching--I hope that you, my Lord, may
     live to behold its arrival--when the Mahometan, the Jew, the
     Christian, the Deist, and the Atheist will live together in
     one community, equally sharing the benefits which arrive
     from its association, and united in the bonds of charity and
     brotherly love."In America "atheism" was never anything but the besom which again and
again has cleared the human mind of phantasms represented in outrages on
honest thinkers.In Paine's time the phantasm which was called Jehovah
represented a grossly ignorant interpretation of the Bible; the
revelation of its monstrous character, represented in the hatred,
slander, falsehood, meanness, and superstition, which Jarvis represented
as crows and vultures hovering near the preachers kicking Paine's dead
body, necessarily destroyed the phantasm, whose pretended power was
proved nothing more than that of certain men to injure a man who
out-reasoned them.Paine's fidelity to his unanswered argument was
fatal to the consecrated phantasm.It was confessed to be ruling without
reason, right, or humanity, like the King from whom "Common Sense,"
mainly, had freed America, and not by any "Grace of God" at all, but
through certain reverend Lord Norths and Lord Howes.Paine's peaceful
death, the benevolent distribution of his property by a will affirming
his Theism, represented a posthumous and potent conclusion to the "Age
of Reason."Paine had aimed to form in New York a Society for Religious Inquiry,
also a Society of Theophilan-thropy.The latter was formed, and his
posthumous works first began to appear, shortly after his death, in an
organ called _The Theophilanthropist_.But his movement was too cosmopolitan to be contained in any local
organization."Thomas Paine," said President Andrew Jackson to Judge
Hertell, "Thomas Paine needs no monument made by hands; he has erected
a monument in the hearts of all lovers of liberty."The like may be
said of his religion: Theophilanthropy, under a hundred translations and
forms, is now the fruitful branch of every religion and every sect.The
real cultivators of skepticism,--those who ascribe to deity biblical
barbarism, and the savagery of nature,--have had their day.The removal and mystery of Paine's bones appear like some page of Mosaic
mythology.* An English caricature pictured Cobbett seated on Paine's
coffin, in a boat named Rights of Man, rowed by <DW64> Slaves.* The bones of Thomas Paine were landed in Liverpool
     November 21, 1819.The monument contemplated by Cobbett was
     never raised.There was much parliamentary and municipal
     excitement.A Bolton town-crier was imprisoned nine weeks
     for proclaiming the arrival.In 1836 the bones passed with
     Cobbett's effects into the hands of a Receiver (West).The
     Lord Chancellor refusing to regard them as an asset, they
     were kept by an old day-laborer until 1844, when they passed
     to B. Tilley, 13 Bedford Square, London, a furniture dealer.In 1849 the empty coffin was in possession of J. Chennell,
     Guildford.The silver plate bore the inscription "Thomas
     Paine, died June 8, 1809, aged 72."R. Ainslie
     (Unitarian) told E. Truelove that he owned "the skull and
     the right hand of Thomas Paine," but evaded subsequent
     inquiries.Of
     Paine's gravestone the last fragment was preserved by his
     friends of the Bayeaux family, and framed on their wall.In
     November, 1839, the present marble monument at New Rochelle
     was erected.Francis] led me to pay a visit to
Cobbett at his country seat, within a couple of miles of the city, on
the island, on the very day that he had exhumed the bones of Paine, and
shipped them for England.I will here repeat the words which Cobbett
gave utterance to at the friendly interview our party had with him.'I
have just performed a duty, gentlemen, which has been too long delayed:
you have neglected too long the remains of Thomas Paine.I have done
myself the honor to disinter his bones.I have removed them from New
Rochelle.I have dug them up; they are now on their way to England.When
I myself return, I shall cause them to speak the common sense of
the great man; I shall gather together the people of Liverpool and
Manchester in one assembly with those of London, and those bones will
effect the reformation of England in Church and State.'"Badeau, of New Rochelle, remembers standing near Cobbett's workmen
while they were digging up the bones, about dawn.There is a legend that
Paine's little finger was left in America, a fable, perhaps, of his once
small movement, now stronger than the loins of the bigotry that refused
him a vote or a grave in the land he so greatly served.As to his bones,
no man knows the place of their rest to this day.His thoughts, untraceable like his dust, are blown about the world
which he held in his heart.For a hundred years no human being has been
born in the civilized world without some spiritual tincture from that
heart whose every pulse was for humanity, whose last beat broke a fetter
of fear, and fell on the throne of thrones.APPENDIX A. THE COBBETT PAPERS.In the autumn of 1792 William Cobbett arrived in America.Among the
papers preserved by the family of Thomas Jefferson is a letter from
Cobbett, enclosing an introduction from Mr.Short, U. S. Secretary
of Legation at Paris.In this letter, dated at Wilmington, Delaware,
November 2, 1792, the young Englishman writes: "Ambitious to become
the citizen of a free state I have left my native country, England, for
America.I bring with me youth, a small family, a few useful literary
talents, and that is all."Cobbett had been married in the same year, on February 5th, and visited
Paris, perhaps with an intention of remaining, but becoming disgusted
with the revolution he left for America.He had conceived a dislike of
the French revolutionary leaders, among whom he included Paine.He
thus became an easy victim of the libellous Life of Paine, by George
Chalmers, which had not been reprinted in America, and reproduced the
statements of that work in a brief biographical sketch published in
Philadelphia, 1796.In later life Cobbett became convinced that he had
been deceived into giving fresh currency to a tissue of slanders.In the very year of this publication, afterwards much lamented, Paine
published in Europe a work that filled Cobbett with admiration.This was
"The Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance," which predicted
the suspension of gold payments by the Bank of England that followed the
next year.The pamphlet became Cobbett's text-book, and his _Register_
was eloquent in Paine's praise, the more earnestly, he confessed,
because he had "been one of his most violent assailants.""Old age
having laid his hand upon this truly great man, this truly philosophical
politician, at his expiring flambeau I lighted my taper."A sketch of Thomas Paine and some related papers of Cobbett are
generously confided to me by his daughter, Eleanor Cobbett, through her
nephew, William Cobbett, Jr., of Woodlands, near Manchester, England.The public announcement (1818) by Cobbett, then in America, of his
intention to write a Life-of Paine, led to his negotiation with
Madame Bonneville, who, with her husband, resided in New York.Madame
Bonneville had been disposing of some of Paine's manuscripts, such as
that on "Freemasonry," and the reply to Bishop Watson, printed in
_The Theophilanthropist_ (1810).She had also been preparing, with her
husband's assistance, notes for a biography of Paine, because of the
"unjust efforts to tarnish the memory of Mr.Paine"; adding, "_Et
l'indignation ma fait prendre la plume_."Cobbett agreed to give her
a thousand dollars for the manuscript, which was to contain important
letters from and to eminent men.She stated (September 30, 1819)
her conditions, that it should be published in England, without any
addition, and separate from any other writings.I suppose it was one or
all of these conditions that caused the non-completion of the bargain.Cobbett re-wrote the whole thing, and it is now all in his writing
except a few passages by Madame Bonneville, which I indicate by
brackets, and two or three by his son, J. P. Cobbett.Although Madame
Bonneville gave some revision to Cobbett's manuscript, most of the
letters to be supplied are merely indicated.No trace of them exists
among the Cobbett papers.Soon afterward the Bonnevilles went to Paris,
where they kept a small book shop.His biography
in Michaud's Dictionary is annotated by the widow, and states that
in 1829 she had begun to edit for publication the Life and posthumous
papers of Thomas Paine.From this it would appear that she had retained
the manuscript, and the original letters.In 1833 Madame Bonneville
emigrated to St.Louis, where her son, the late General Bonneville,
lived.Her Catholicism became, I believe, devout with advancing years,
and to that cause, probably also to a fear of reviving the old scandal
Cheetham had raised, may be due the suppression of the papers, with
the result mentioned in the introduction to this work.Louis, October 30, 1846, at the age of 79.Probably William Cobbett
did not feel entitled to publish the manuscript obtained under such
conditions, or he might have waited for the important documents that
were never sent.The recollections are those of both M.
and Madame Bonneville.The reader will find no difficulty in making out
the parts that represent Madame's personal knowledge and reminiscences,
as Cobbett has preserved her speech in the first person, and, with
characteristic literary acumen, her expressions in such important
points.His manuscript is perfect, and I have little editing to do
beyond occasional correction of a date, supplying one or two letters
indicated, which I have found, and omitting a few letters, extracts,
etc., already printed in the body of this work, where unaccompanied by
any comment or addition from either Cobbett or the Bonnevilles.At the time when this Cobbett-Bonneville sketch was written New York was
still a provincial place.Nicolas Bonneville, as Irving describes him,
seated under trees at the Battery, absorbed in his classics, might have
been regarded with suspicion had it been known that his long separation
from his family was due to detention by the police.Madame Bonneville is
reserved on that point.The following incident, besides illustrating the
characters of Paine and Bonneville, may suggest a cause for the rigor
of Bonneville's surveillance.In 1797, while Paine and Bonneville were
editing the _Bien Informe_, a "suspect" sought asylum with them.This
was Count Barruel-Beauvert, an author whose writings alone had caused
his denunciation as a royalist.He had escaped from the Terror, and now
wandered back in disguise, a pauper Count, who knew well the magnanimity
of the two men whose protection he asked.He remained, as proof-reader,
in the Bonneville house for some time, safely; but when the conspiracy
of 18 Fructidor (September 4, 1797) exasperated the Republic against
royalists, the Count feared that he might be the means of compromising
his benefactors, and disappeared.When the royalist conspiracy against
Bonaparte was discovered, Barruel-Beauvert was again hunted, and
arrested (1802).His trial probably brought to the knowledge of the
police his former sojourn with Paine and Bonneville.Bonaparte sent by
Fouche a warning to Paine that the eye of the police was upon him,
and that "on the first complaint he would be sent to his own country,
America."Whether this, and the closer surveillance on Bonneville, were
connected with the Count, who also suffered for a time, or whether due
to their anti-slavery writings on Domingo, remains conjectural.Towards
the close of life Bonneville received a pension, which was continued to
his widow.So much even a monarchy with an established church could do
for a republican author, and a freethinker; for Bonneville had published
heresies like those of Paine.THOMAS PAINE, A SKETCH OF HIS LIFE AND CHARACTER.[More exactly than any other author Thomas Paine delineates every
Circumstantial Events, private or Public in his Writings; nevertheless,
since many pretended Histories of the Life of T. P. have been published,
tracing him back to the day of his]* birth, we shall shortly observe,
that, as was never denied by himself, he was born at Thetford, in the
County of Norfolk, England on the 29.January, in the year 1737; that
his father Joseph Paine was a stay-maker, and by religion a Quaker; that
his mother was the daughter of a country attorney, and that she belonged
to the Church of England; but, it appears, that she also afterwards
became a Quaker; for these parents both belonged to the Meeting in 1787,
as appears from a letter of the father to the son.* The bracketed words, Madame Bonneville's, are on a
     separate slip.An opening paragraph by Cobbett is crossed
     out by her pen: "The early years of the life of a Great Man
     are of little consequence to the world.Whether Paine made
     stays or gauged barrels before he became a public character,
     is of no more importance to us than whether he was swaddled
     with woollen or with linen.It is the man, in conjunction
     with those labours which have produced so much effect in the
     world, whom we are to follow and contemplate.Nevertheless,
     since many pretended histories of the life of Paine have
     been published, etc."The above-mentioned histories relate (and the correctness of the
statement has not been denied by him), that Paine was educated at the
free-school of Thetford; that he left it in 1752, when he was fifteen
years of age, and then worked for some time with his father: that in a
year afterwards, he went to London: that from London he went to Dover:
that about this time he was on the eve of becoming a sailor: that he
afterwards did embark on board a privateer: that, between the years 1759
and 1774 he was a stay maker, an excise officer, a grocer, and an usher
to a school; and that, during the period he was twice married, and
separated by mutual consent, from his second wife.*

     * The dates given by Cobbett from contemporary histories
     require revision by the light of the careful researches made
     by myself and others, as given at the beginning of this
     biography.In this year 1774 and in the month of September, Paine sailed from
England for Philadelphia, where he arrived safe; and now we begin his
history; for here we have him in connection with his literary labours.It being an essential part of our plan to let Thomas Paine speak in his
own words, and explain himself the reason for his actions, whenever
we find written papers in his own hand, though in incomplete notes or
fragments, we shall insert such, in order to enable the reader to judge
for himself, and to estimate the slightest circumstances._Sauvent d'un
grand dessin un mot nous fait juger_."A word often enables us to judge
of a great design.""I happened to come to America a few months before the breaking out of
hostilities.I found the disposition of the people such that they might
have been led by a thread and governed by a reed.Their suspicion was
quick and penetrating, but their attachment to Britain was obstinate,
and it was at that time a kind of treason to speak against it.They
disliked the Ministry, but they esteemed the Nation.Their idea of
grievance operated without resentment, and their single object was
reconciliation.Bad as I believed the Ministry to be, I never conceived
them capable of a measure so rash and wicked as the commencing of
hostilities; much less did I imagine the Nation would encourage it.I viewed the dispute as a kind of law-suit, in which I supposed the
parties would find a way either to decide or settle it.I had no
thoughts of independence or of arms.The world could not then have
persuaded me that I should be either a soldier or an author.If I had
any talents for either they were buried in me, and might ever have
continued so had not the necessity of the times dragged and driven them
into action.I had formed my plan of life, and conceiving myself happy
wished everybody else so.But when the country, into which I had just
set my foot, was set on fire about my ears, it was time to stir.It was
time for every man to stir."*

     * From Crisis vii., dated Philadelphia, November 21, 1778.His first intention at Philadelphia was to establish an Academy for
young ladies, who were to be taught many branches of learning then
little known in the education of young American ladies.But, in 1775, he
undertook the management of the Pennsylvania Magazine.About this time he published, in Bradford's journal, an essay on the
slavery, of the <DW64>s, which was universally well received; and also
stanzas on the death of General Wolfe.In 1776, January 10, he published Common Sense.In the same year he
joined the army as aid-de-camp to General Greene.Gordon, in his history
of the Independence of the United States (vol.78), says:
[Wanting]--Ramsay (Lond.Franklin preserved by Thomas Paine: [Wanting, but no doubt one
else-where given, in the Hall manuscripts]

When Washington had made his retreat from New York Thomas Paine
published the first number of the Crisis, which was read to every
corporal's guard in the camp.It revived the army, reunited the members
of the [New York] Convention, when despair had reduced them to nine in
number, while the militia were abandoning their standards and flying in
all directions.The success of the army at Trenton was, in some degree,
owing to this first number of the Crisis.In 1778 he discovered the
robberies of Silas Deane, an agent of the United States in France.He gave in his resignation as Secretary, which was accepted by the
Congress.In 1779 he was appointed-Clerk to the General Assembly of
Pennsylvania, which office he retained until 1780.In 1780 he departed
for France with Col.John Laurens, commissioned especially by the
Congress to the Court at Versailles to obtain the aid that was wanted.After his return from France he
received the following letter from Col.Laurens:

"Carolina, April 18, 1782.--I received the letter wherein you mention
my horse and trunk, (the latter of which was left at Providence).The misery which the former has suffered at different times, by
mismanagement, has greatly distressed me.He was wounded in service, and
I am much attached to him.If he can be of any service to you, I entreat
your acceptance of him, more especially if you will make use of him in
bringing you to a country (Carolina) where you will be received with
open arms, and all that affection and respect which our citizens are
anxious to testify to the author of Common Sense, and the Crisis.I wish you to regard this part of America (Carolina) as your
particular home--and everything that I can command in it to be in common
between us."On the 10th of April, 1783, the definitive treaty of peace was received
and published.Nathaniel Greene:

"Ashley-Rives (Carolina), Nov.18, 1782.--Many people wish to get you
into this country."I see you are determined to follow your genius and not your fortune.I have always been in hopes that Congress would have made some handsome
acknowledgement to you for past services.I must confess that I think
you have been shamefully neglected; and that America is indebted to few
characters more than to you.But as your passion leads to fame, and
not to wealth, your mortification will be the less.Your fame for
your writings, will be immortal.At present my expenses are great;
nevertheless, if you are not conveniently situated, I shall take a pride
and pleasure in contributing all in my power to render your situation
happy."'Then letter from his father.--"Dear Son, &c."The following letter from William Livingston (Trenton, 4 November, 1784)
will show that Thomas Paine was not only honored with the esteem of the
most famous persons, but that they were all convinced that he had been
useful to the country.**

At this time Thomas Paine was living with Colonel Kirk-bride,
Bordentown, where he remained till his departure for France.He had
bought a house [in], and five acres of marshy land over against,
Bordentown, near the Delaware, which overflowed it frequently.Congress gave an order for three thousand dollars, which Thomas Paine
received in the same month.He carried with him the model of
a bridge of his own invention and construction, which he submitted, in
a drawing, to the French Academy, by whom it was approved.From Paris he
went to London on the 3 September 1787; and in the same month he went
to Thetford, where he found his father was dead, from the small-pox; and
where he settled an allowance on his mother of 9 shillings a week.* This and the preceding letter supplied by the author.A part of 1788 he passed in Rotherham, in Yorkshire, where his bridge
was cast and erected, chiefly at the expense of the ingenious Mr.The experiment, however, cost Thomas Paine a considerable sum.When Burke published his _Reflexions on the French Revolution_, Thomas
Paine answered him in his First Part of the Rights of Man.In January,
1792, appeared the Second Part of the Rights of Man.The sale of the
Rights of Man was prodigious, amounting in the course of one year to
about a hundred thousand copies.In 1792 he was prosecuted for his Rights of Man by the Attorney General,
McDonald, and was defended by Mr.Erskine, and found guilty of libel.But he was now in France, and could not be brought up for judgment.Each district of France sent electors to the principal seat of the
Department, where the Deputies to the National Assembly were chosen.Two
Departments appointed Thomas Paine their Deputy, those of Oise and
of Pas de Calais, of which he accepted the latter.He received the
following letter from the President of the National Assembly, Herault de
Sechelles:

"To Thomas Paine:

"France calls you, Sir, to its bosom, to perform one of the most useful
and most honorable functions, that of contributing, by wise legislation,
to the happiness of a people, whose destinies interest all who think and
are united with the welfare of all who suffer in the world."It becomes the nation that has proclaimed the Rights of Many to desire
among her legislators him who first dared to estimate the consequences
of those Rights, and who has developed their principles with that
Common Senset which is the only genius inwardly felt by all men, and the
conception of which springs forth from nature and truth."The National Assembly gave you the title of Citizen, and had seen
with pleasure that its decree was sanctioned by the only legitimate
authority, that of the people, who had already claimed you, even before
you were nominated."Come, Sir, and enjoy in France the most interesting of scenes for an
observer and a philosopher,--that of a confiding and generous people
who, infamously betrayed for three years, and wishing at last to end the
struggle between slavery and liberty, between sincerity and perfidy, at
length arises in its resolute and gigantic force, gives up to the sword
of the law those guilty crowned things who betrayed them, resists the
barbarians whom they raised up to destroy the nation.Her citizens
turned soldiers, her territory into camp and fortress, she yet calls and
collects in congress the lights scattered through the universe.Men of
genius, the most capable for their wisdom and virtue, she now calls to
give to her people a government the most proper to insure their liberty
and happiness."The Electoral Assembly of the Department of Oise, anxious to be the
first to elect you, has been so fortunate as to insure to itself that
honour; and when many of my fellow citizens desired me to inform you of
your election, I remembered, with infinite pleasure, having seen you at
Mr.Jefferson's, and I congratulated myself on having had the pleasure
of knowing you."Herault,

"President of the National Assembly."before the National Convention Thomas Paine
at the Tribune, with the deputy Bancal for translator and interpreter,
gave his opinion, written, on the capital sentence on Louis:--That,
though a Deputy of the National Convention of France, he could not
forget, that, previous to his being that, he was a citizen of the United
States of America, which owed their liberty to Louis, and that gratitude
would not allow him to vote for the death of the benefactor of America.On the 21st of January, 1793, Louis XVI was beheaded in the Square of
Louis XV.Thomas Paine was named by the Assembly as one of the Committee of
Legislation, and, as he could not discuss article by article without the
aid of an interpreter, he drew out a plan of a constitution.**

     * Both missing.Possibly the second should be to Danton.The reign of terror began on the night of the 10th of March!793, when
the greatest number and the best part of the real friends to freedom had
retired [from the Convention].But, as the intention of the conspiracy
against the Assembly had been suspected, as the greatest part of the
Deputies they wished to sacrifice had been informed of the threatening
danger, as, moreover, a mutual fear [existed] of the cunning tyranny of
some usurper, the conspirators, alarmed, could not this night consummate
their horrible machinations.They therefore, for this time, confined
themselves to single degrees of accusation and arrestation against the
most valuable part of the National Convention.Robespiere had placed
himself at the head of a conspiring Common-Hall, which dared to dictate
_laws of blood_ and proscription to the Convention.All those whom he
could not make bend under a Dictatorship, which a certain number of
anti-revolutionists feigned to grant him, as a tool which they could
destroy at pleasure, were guilty of being suspected, and secretly
destined to disappear from among the living.Thomas Paine, as his marked
enemy and rival, by favour of the decree on the suspected was classed
among the suspected, and, as a foreigner, was imprisoned in the
Luxembourg in December 1793.|

From this document it will be seen, that, while in the prison, he was,
for a month, afflicted with an illness that deprived him of his memory.It was during this illness of Thomas Paine that the fall of Robespierre
took place.Monroe, who arrived at Paris some days afterwards, wrote
to Mr.Paine, assuring him of his friendship, as appears from the letter
to Washington.Fifteen days afterwards Thomas Paine received a letter
from Peter Whiteside.** In consequence of this letter Thomas Paine wrote
a memorial to Mr.Monroe now claimed Thomas Paine, and he
_came out of the prison on the 6th of November, 1794, after ten months
of imprisonment_.Monroe, who had cordially
offered him his house.In a short time after, the Convention called
him to take his seat in that Assembly; which he did, for the reasons he
alleges in his letter to Washington.The following two pieces Thomas Paine wrote while in Prison: "Essay on
Aristocracy.""Essay on the character of Robespierre."* This is the bitter letter of which when it appeared
     Cobbett had written such a scathing review.** The letter telling him of the allegations made by some
     against his American citizenship.Thomas Paine received the following letter from Madame Lafayette, whose
husband was then a prisoner of war in Austria:

"19 Brumaire, Paris.--I was this morning so much agitated by the kind
visit from Mr.Monroe, that I could hardly find words to speak; but,
however, I was, my dear Sir, desirous to tell you, that the news of your
being set at liberty, which I this morning learnt from General Kilmaine,
who arrived here at the same time with me, has given me a moment's
consolation in the midst of this abyss of misery, where I shall all my
life remain plunged.Kilmaine has told me that you recollected
me, and have taken great interest in my situation; for which I am
exceedingly grateful.Monroe, my congratulations upon your being
restored to each other, and the assurances of these sentiments from
her who is proud to proclaim them, and who well deserved the title of
citizen of that second country, though I have assuredly never failed,
nor shall ever fail, to the former."With all sincerity of my heart,

"N.On the 27 January, 1794, Thomas Paine published in Paris, the First Part
of the "Age of Reason."Seeing the state of things in America, Thomas Paine wrote a letter to
Gen.Monroe entreated him not to
send it, and, accordingly it was not sent to Washington; but it was
afterwards published.A few months after his going out of prison, he had a violent fever.Monroe showed him all possible kindness and attention.She provided him
with an excellent nurse, who had for him all the anxiety and assiduity
of a sister.She neglected nothing to afford him ease and comfort, when
he was totally unable to help himself.He was in the state of a helpless
child who has its face and hands washed by its mother.The surgeon was
the famous Dessault, who cured him of an abscess which he had in his
side.After the horrible 13 Brumaire, a friend of Thomas Paine being
very sick, he, who was in the house, went to bring his own excellent
nurse to take care of his sick friend: a fact of little account
in itself, but a sure evidence of ardent and active friendship and
kindness.The Convention being occupied with a discussion of the question of what
Constitution ought to be adopted, that of 1791 or that of 1793, Thomas
Paine made a speech (July 7, 1795) as a member of the [original]
Committee [on the Constitution] and Lanthenas translated it and read
it in the Tribune.This speech has been translated into English, and
published in London; but, the language of the author has been changed
by the two translations.It is now given as written by the author.In April, 1796, he wrote his _Decline and Fail of the British System of
Finance _; and, on the 30th of July of that year he sent his letter to
Washington off for America by Mr.-------- who sent it to Mr.Bache, a
newspaper printer of Philadelphia, to be published, and it was published
the same year.The name of the gentleman who conveyed the letter, and
who wrote the following to Thomas Paine, is not essential and therefore
we suppress it.We here insert a letter from Talleyrand, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, to show that Thomas Paine was always active and attentive in
doing every thing which would be useful to America.Thomas Paine after he came out of prison and had reentered the
Convention wrote the following letter.The following is essentially connected with the foregoing: "Paris,
October 4, 1796."In October, 1796, Thomas Paine published the Second Fart of the Age of
Reason.Monroe departed from France, and soon after Thomas Paine
went to Havre de Grace, to embark for the United States.But, he did
not, upon inquiry, think it prudent to go, on account of the great
number of English vessels then cruizing in the Channel.He therefore
came back to Paris; but, while at Havre, wrote the following letter, 13
April 1797, to a friend at Paris.The following letter will not, we hope, seem indifferent to the reader:
"Dear Sir, I wrote to you etc."At this time it was that Thomas Paine took up his abode at Mr.Bonneville's, who had known him at the Minister Roland's, and as Mr.B.
spoke English, Thomas Paine addressed himself to him in a more familiar
and friendly manner than to any other persons of the society.It was a
reception of Hospitality which was here given to Thomas Paine for a
week or a fortnight; but, the visit lasted till 1802, when he and Mr.Bonneville parted,--alas never to meet again!All the first floor was
occupied as a printing office.The whole house was pretty well filled;
and Mr.Bonneville gave up his study, which was not a large one, and a
bed-chamber to Thomas Paine.He was always in his apartments excepting
at meal times.He then used to read the newspapers, from
which, though he understood but little of the French language when
spoken, he did not fail to collect all the material information relating
to politics, in which subject he took most delight.When he had his
morning's reading, he used to carry back the journals to Mr.Bonneville,
and they had a chat upon the topicks of the day.If he had a short jaunt to take, as for instance, to Puteaux just by
the bridge of Neuilly, where Mr.Skipwith lived, he always went on
foot, after suitable preparations for the journey in that way.I do not
believe he ever hired a coach to go out on pleasure during the whole of
his stay in Paris.He laughed at those who, depriving themselves of a
wholesome exercise, could make no other excuse for the want of it than
that they were able to take it whenever they pleased.If not writing he was busily employed on some mechanical
invention, or else entertaining his visitors.Not a day escaped without
his receiving many visits.Smith [Sir
Robert] came very often to see him.Many travellers also called on him;
and, often, having no other affair, talked to him only of his great
reputation and their admiration of his works.He treated such visitors
with civility, but with little ceremony, and, when their conversation
was mere chit-chat, and he found they had nothing particular to say to
him, he used to retire to his own pursuits, leaving them to entertain
themselves with their own ideas.Smith's [Sir Robert], and sometimes at an Irish Coffee-house
in Conde Street, where Irish, English, and American people met.He here
learnt the state of politics in England and America.He never went out
after dinner without first taking a nap, which was always of two or
three hours length.And, when he went out to a dinner of _parade_, he
often came home for the purpose of taking his accustomed sleep.It was
seldom he went into the society of French people; except when, by
seeing some one in office or power, he could obtain some favour for his
countrymen who might be in need of his good offices.These he always
performed with pleasure, and he never failed to adopt the most likely
means to secure success.He wrote as
follows to Lord Cornwallis; but, he did not save Napper Tandy.C. Jourdan made a report to the Convention on the re-establishment
of Bells, which had been suppressed, and, in great part melted.Paine
published, on this occasion, a letter to C.*

     concerning Jourdan.He had brought with him from America, as we have seen, a model of a
bridge of his own construction and invention, which model had been
adopted in England for building bridges under his own direction.He
employed part of his time, while at our house, in bringing this model to
high perfection, and this accomplished to his wishes.He afterwards,
and according the model, made a bridge of lead, which he accomplished b/
moulding different blocks of lead, which, when joined together, made the
form that he required.Though
he fully relied on the strength of his new bridge, and would produce
arguments enough in proof of its infallible strength, he often
demonstrated the proof by blows of the sledge-hammer, not leaving anyone
in doubt on the subject.One night he took off the scaffold of his
bridge and seeing that it stood firm under the repeated strokes of
hammer, he was so ravished that an enjoyment so great was not to be
sufficiently felt if confined to his own bosom.He was not satisfied
without admirers of his success.One night we had just gone to bed, and
were surprised at hearing repeated strokes of the hammer.Bonneville's room and besought him to go and see his bridge:
come and look, said he, it bears all my blows and stands like a rock.Bonneville arose, as well to please himself by seeing a happy man as
to please him by looking at his bridge.Nothing would do, unless I saw
the sight as well as Mr.After much exultation: "nothing, in
the world," said he, "is so fine as my bridge"; and, seeing me standing
by without uttering a word, he added, "except a woman!"which happy
compliment to the sex he seemed to think, a full compensation for the
trouble caused by this nocturnal visit to the bridge.A machine for planing boards was his next invention, which machine he
had executed partly by one blacksmith and partly by another.The machine
being put together by him, he placed it on the floor, and with it planed
boards to any number that he required, to make some models of wheels.Bonneville has two of these wheels now.There is a specification
of the wheels, given by Mr.This specification, together
with a drawing of the model, made by Mr.Fulton, were deposited at
Washington, in February 1811; and the other documents necessary to
obtain a patent as an invention of Thomas Paine, for the benefit of
Madam Bonneville.To be presented to the Directory of France, a memorial
on the progress and construction of iron bridges.On this subject the
two pieces here subjoined will throw sufficient light.(Memoir upon

and Construction &c.)Preparations were made, real or simulated, for a Descent upon England.8. who was then in the house of
Talma, and he wrote the following notes and instructions.Letter at

     pieces by Paine mentioned are missing; also that addressed
     "To the Directory," for the answer to which see p.296 of
     this volume.Chancellor Livingston, after his arrival in France, came a few times to
see Paine.One morning we had him at breakfast, Dupuis, the author of
the Origin of Worship, being of the party; and Mr.Livingston, when he
got up to go away, said to Mr.Paine smiling, "Make your Will; leave
the mechanics, the iron bridge, the wheels, etc.to America, and your
religion to France."Thomas Paine, while at our house, published in Mr.Bonneville's journal
(the _Bien Informe_) several articles on passing events.*

     * The following words are here crossed out: "Also several
     pieces of poetry, which will be published hereafter, with
     his miscellaneous prose."A few days before his departure for America, he said, at Mr.Smith's
[Sir Robert] that he had nothing to detain him in France; for that he
was neither in love, debt, nor difficulty.Some lady observed, that it
was not, in the company of ladies, gallant to say he was not in love.Upon this occasion he wrote the New Covenant, from the Castle in the Air
to the Little Corner of the World, in three stanzas, and sent it with
the following words: "As the ladies are better judges of gallantry
than the men are, I will thank you to tell me, whether the enclosed be
gallantry.If it be, it is truly original; and the merit of it belongs
to the person who inspired it.""If the usual style of gallantry was as clever as your new
covenant, many a fair ladies heart would be in danger, but the Little
Corner of the World receives it from the Castle in the Air; it is
agreeable to her as being the elegant fancy of a friend.--C.At this time, 1802, public spirit was at end in France.The real
republicans were harrassed by eternal prosecutions.Paine was a truly
grateful man: his friendship was active and warm, and steady.During the
six years that he lived in our house, he frequently pressed us to go to
America, offering us all that he should be able to do for us, and saying
that he would bequeath his property to our children.Some affairs of
great consequence made it impracticable for Mr.Bonneville to quit
France; but, foreseeing a new revolution, that would strike, personally,
many of the Republicans, it was resolved, soon after the departure
of Mr.Paine for America, that I should go thither with my children,
relying fully on the good offices of Mr.Paine, whose conduct in America
justified that reliance.In 1802 Paine left France, regretted by all who knew him.He embarked
at Havre de Grace on board a stout ship, belonging to Mr.Patterson, of
Baltimore, he being the only passenger.After a very stormy passage, he
landed at Baltimore on the 30th of October, 1812.He remained there but
a few days, and then went to Washington, where he published his Letters
to the Americans.A few months afterwards, he went to Bordentown, to his friend Col.Kirkbride, who had invited him, on his return, by the following letter
of 12 November, 1802.He staid at Bordentown about two months, and then went to New York,
where a great number of patriots gave him a splendid dinner at the City
Hotel.In June, 1803, he went to Stonington, New England, to see some
friends; and in the autumn he went to his farm at New Rochelle.(The
letter of Thomas Paine to Mr.Bonneville, 20 Nov., 1803.)An inhabitant of this village offered him an apartment, of which he
accepted, and while here he was taken ill.His complaint was a sort of
paralytic affection, which took away the use of his hands.He had had
the same while at Mr.Monroe's in Paris, after he was released from
prison.Being better, he went to his farm, where he remained a part of
the winter, and he came to New York to spend the rest of it; but in the
spring (1804) he went back to his farm.The farmer who had had his farm
for 17 or 18 years, instead of paying his rent, brought Mr.Paine a bill
for fencing, which made Paine his debtor!They had a law-suit by which
Paine got nothing but the right of paying the law-expenses!This and
other necessary expenses compelled him to sell sixty acres of his land.He then gave the honest farmer notice to quit the next April (1805).Upon taking possession of the farm himself, he hired Christopher Derrick
to cultivate it for him.He soon found that Derrick was not fit for his
place, and he, therefore, discharged him.This was in the summer; and,
on Christmas Eve ensuing, about six o'clock, Mr.Paine being in his
room, on the ground floor, reading, a gun was fired a few yards from the
window.The contents of the gun struck the bottom part of the window,
and all the charge, which was of small shot, lodged, as was next day
discovered, in the window sill and wall.The shooter, in firing the gun,
fell; and the barrel of the gun had entered the ground where he fell,
and left an impression, which Thomas Paine observed the next morning.Thomas Paine went immediately to the house of a neighboring farmer, and
there (seeing a gun, he took hold of it, and perceived that the
muzzle of the gun was filled with fresh earth.)And then he heard that
Christopher Derick had borrowed the gun about five o'clock the evening
before, and had returned it again before six o'clock the same evening.Derick was arrested, and Purdy, his brother farmer, became immediately
and voluntarily his bail.The cause was brought forward at New Rochelle;
and Derick was acquitted.*

     * See p.Several paragraphs here are in
     the writing of J. P. Cobbett, then with his father in New
     York.In 1806 Thomas Paine offered to vote at New Rochelle for the election.But his vote was not admitted; on the pretence only of his not being
a citizen of America; whereon he wrote the following letters.[_The
letters are here missing, but no doubt the same as those on pp.379-80
of this volume_..]

This case was pleaded before the Supreme Court of New York by Mr.Riker, then Attorney General, and, though Paine lost his cause, I as
his legatee, did not lose the having to pay for it.It is however, an
undoubted fact, that Mr.He remained at New Rochelle till June 1807; till disgust of every kind,
occasioned by the gross and brutal conduct of some of the people there,
made him resolve to go and live at New York.On the 4th of April, 1807, he wrote the following letter to Mr.Bonneville [in Paris]:

"My dear Bonneville: Why don't you come to America Your wife and two
boys, Benjamin and Thomas, are here, and in good health.They all speak
English very well; but Thomas has forgot his French.I intend to provide
for the boys, but, I wish to see you here.We heard of you by letters by
Madget and Captain Hailey.Thomas, an English
woman, keep an academy for young ladies."I send this by a friend, Mrs.Champlin, who will call on Mercier at the
Institute, to know where you are.And some time after the following letter:

"My dear Bonneville: I received your letter by Mrs.Champlin, and also
the letter for Mrs.Bonneville, and one from her sister.I have written
to the American Minister in Paris, Mr.Armstrong, desiring him to
interest himself to have your surveillance taken off on condition of
your coming to join your family in the United States.Bonneville's, come to you under cover to the
American Minister from Mr.As soon as you
receive it I advise you to call on General Armstrong and inform him of
the proper method to have your surveillance taken off.Champagny,
who succeeds Talleyrand, is, I suppose, the same who was Minister of the
Interior, from whom I received a handsome friendly letter, respecting
the iron bridge.I think you once went with me to see him."Call on Mr Skipwith with my compliments.He will inform you what
vessels will sail for New York and where from.Bordeaux will be the best
place to sail from.Lee is American Consul at Bordeaux.When you arrive there, call on him, with my compliments.You may
contrive to arrive at New York in April or May.The passages, in the
Spring, are generally short; seldom more than five weeks, and often
less."Present my respects to Mercier, Bernardin St.Pierre, Dupuis,
Gregoire.--When you come, I intend publishing all my works, and those I
have yet in manuscript, by subscription."*

     * This letter is entirely in the writing of Madame
     Bonneville.Beneath it is written: "The above is a true
     copy of the original; I have compared the two together.The allusion to Champagny is either a
     slip of Madame's pen or Paine's memory.The minister who
     wrote him about his bridge was Chaptal.The
     names in the last paragraph show what an attractive literary
     circle Paine had left in France, for a country unable to
     appreciate him.While Paine was one day taking his usual after-dinner nap, an old woman
called, and, asking for Mr.Paine, said she had something of great
importance to communicate to him.She was shown into his bed-chamber;
and Paine, raising himself on his elbow, and turning towards the woman,
said: "What do you want with me?""I came," said she, "from God, to
tell you, that if you don't repent, and believe in Christ, you 'll be
dammed.""Poh, poh, it's not true," said Paine; "you are not sent with
such an impertinent message.God would not send
such a foolish ugly old woman as you.Get away;
be off: shut the door."After his arrival Paine published several articles in the newspapers of
New York and Philadelphia.Subsequent to a short illness which he had
in 1807, he could not walk without pain, and the difficulty of walking
increased every day.On the 21st of January, 1808, he addressed a
memorial to the Congress of the United States, asking remuneration for
his services; and, on the 14th of February, the same year, another on
the same subject.These documents and his letter to the Speaker are as
follows.*

     * "Are as follows" in Madame B.'s writing, after striking
     oat Cobbett's words, "will be found in the Appendix."The
     documents and letters are not given, but they are well
     known.The Committee of Claims, to which the memorial had been submitted,
passed the following resolution: "Resolved, that Thomas Paine has leave
to withdraw his memorial and the papers accompanying the same."He
was deeply grieved at this refusal; some have blamed him for exposing
himself to it.But, it should be recollected, that his expenses were
greatly augmented by his illness, and he saw his means daily diminish,
while he feared a total palsy; and while he expected to live to a
very great age, as his ancestors had before him.His money yielded no
interest, always having been unwilling to place money out in that way.He had made his will in 1807, during the short illness already noticed.But three months later, he assembled his friends, and read to them
another will; saying that he had believed such and such one to be his
friend, and that now having altered his belief in them, he had also
altered his will.From motives of the same kind, he, three months before
his death, made another will, which he sealed up and directed to me, and
gave it me to keep, observing to me, that I was more interested in it
than any body else.He wished to be buried in the Quaker burying ground, and sent for a
member of the committee [Willett Hicks] who lived in the neighborhood.The interview took place on the 19th of March, 1809.Paine said, when we
were looking out for another lodging, we had to put in order the affairs
of our present abode.This was precisely the case with him; all his
affairs were settled, and he had only to provide his burying-ground;
his father had been a Quaker, and he hoped they would not refuse him a
grave; "I will," added he, "pay for the digging of it."The committee of the Quakers refused to receive his body, at which
he seemed deeply moved, and observed to me, who was present at the
interview, that their refusal was foolish."You will," said I, "be
buried on your farm" "I have no objection to that," said he "but the
farm will be sold, and they will dig my bones up before they be half
rotten."Paine," I replied, "have confidence in your friends.I
assure you, that the place where you will be buried, shall never be
sold."He seemed satisfied; and never spoke upon this subject again.I
have been as good as my word.Last December (1818) the land of the farm having been divided between
my children, I gave fifty dollars to keep apart and to myself, the place
whereon the grave was.Paine, doubtless, considered me and my children as strangers in America.His affection for us was, at any rate, great and sincere.He anxiously
recommended us to the protection of Mr.Emmet, saying to him, "when I
am dead, Madam Bonneville will have no friend here."And a little time
after, obliged to draw money from the Bank, he said, with an air of
sorrow, "you will have nothing left."*

     * Paine's Will appoints Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton
     (with $200 each), and Madame Bonneville executors; gives a
     small bequest to the widow of Elihu Palmer, and a
     considerable one to Rickman of London, who was to divide
     with Nicholas Bonneville proceeds of the sale of the North
     part of his farm.To Madame Bonneville went his manuscripts,
     movable effects, stock in the N. Y. Phoenix Insurance
     Company estimated at $1500, and money in hand.The South
     part of the New Rochelle farm, over 100 acres, were given
     Madame Bonneville in trust for her children, Benjamin and
     Thomas, "their education and maintenance, until they come to
     the age of twenty-one years, in order that she may bring them
     well up, give them good and useful learning, and instruct
     them in their duty to God, and the practice of morality."At
     majority they were to share and share alike in fee simple.He desires to be buried in the Quaker ground,--"my father
     belonged to that profession, and I was partly brought up in
     it,"--but if this is not permitted, to be buried on his
     farm."The place where I am to be buried to be a square of
     twelve feet, to be enclosed with rows of trees, and a stone
     or post and railed fence, with a head-stone with my name and
     age engraved upon it, author of "Common Sense."He confides
     Mrs.Bonneville and her children to the care of Emmet and
     Morton."Thus placing confidence in their friendship, I
     herewith take my final leave of them and of the world.I
     have lived an honest and useful life to mankind; my time
     has been spent in doing good; and I die in perfect
     composure and resignation to the will of my Creator God."The Will, dated January 18, opens with the words,
     "The last Will and Testament of me, the subscriber, Thomas
     Paine, reposing confidence in my Creator God, and in no
     other being, for I know of no other, and I believe in no
     other."Paine had died July 27th, 1808.William Fayel, to whom I am indebted for much
     information concerning the Bonnevilles in St.Louis, writes
     me that so little is known of Paine's benefactions, that
     "an ex-senator of the United States recently asserted that
     Gen.Bonneville was brought over by Jefferson and a French
     lady; and a French lady, who was intimate with the
     Bonnevilles, assured me that General Bonneville was sent to
     West Point by Lafayette."His strength and appetite daily
departed from him; and in the day-time only he was able, when not in
bed, to sit up in his arm-chair to read the newspapers, and sometimes
write.When he could no longer quit his bed, he made some one read the
newspapers to him.He wrote nothing for the
press after writing his last will, but he would converse, and took
great interest in politics.The vigour of his mind, which had always
so strongly characterized him, did not leave him to the last moment.He
never complained of his bodily sufferings, though they became excessive.The want of exercise alone was the cause of
his sufferings.Notwithstanding the great inconveniences he was obliged
to sustain during his illness, in a carman's house [Ryder's] in a small
village [Greenwich], without any bosom friend in whom he could repose
confidence, without any society he liked, he still did not complain of
his sufferings.I indeed, went regularly to see him twice a week;
but, he said to me one day: "I am here alone, for all these people are
nothing to me, day after day, week after week, month after month, and
you don't come to see me."[Albert] Gallatin, about this
time, I recollect his using these words: "_I am very sorry that I ever
returned to this country_."As he was thus situated and paying a high
price for his lodgings he expressed a wish to come to my house.This
must be a great inconvenience to me from the frequent visits to Mr.Thomas Paine; but, I, at last, consented; and hired a house in the
neighborhood, in May 1809, to which he was carried in an arm-chair,
after which he seemed calm and satisfied, and gave himself no trouble
about anything.He had no disease that required a Doctor, though
Dr.Romaine came to visit him twice a week.The swelling, which had
commenced at his feet, had now reached his body, and some one had been
so officious as to tell him that he ought to be tapped.I told him, that I did not know; but, that, unless
he was likely to derive great good from it, it should not be done.The
next [day] Doctor Romaine came and brought a physician with him, and
they resolved that the tapping need not take place.A very few days before his
death, Dr.Romame said to me, "I don't think he can live till night."Paine, hearing some one speak, opens his eyes, and said: "'T is
you Doctor: what news?"such an one is gone to France on such
business.""He will do nothing there," said Paine."Your belly
diminishes," said the Doctor."And yours augments," said Paine.* The sentence thus far is struck out by Madame Bonno he had
     not seen for a long while.He was overjoyed at seeing him;
     but, this person began to speak upon religion, and Paine
     turned his head on the other side, and remained silent, even
     to the adieu of the person.When he was near his end, two American clergymen came to see him, and
to talk with him on religious matters."Let me alone," said he; "good
morning."One of his friends
came to New York; a person for whom he had a great esteem, and whom
seeing his end fast approaching, I asked him, in presence of a friend,
if he felt satisfied with the treatment he had received at our house,
upon which he could only exclaim, O!He added other words, but
they were incoherent It was impossible for me not to exert myself to
the utmost in taking care of a person to whom I and my children owed
so much.He now appeared to have lost all kind of feeling.He spent
the night in tranquillity, and expired in the morning at eight o'clock,
after a short oppression, at my house in Greenwich, about two miles from
the city of New York.Jarvis, a Painter, who had formerly made a
portrait of him, moulded his head in plaster, from which a bust was
executed.He was, according to the American custom, deposited in a mahogany
coffin, with his name and age engraved on a silver-plate, put on the
coffin.His corpse was dressed in a shirt, a muslin gown tied at neck
and wrists with black ribbon, stockings, drawers; and a cap was put
under his head as a pillow.(He never slept in a night-cap.)Before the
coffin was placed on the carriage, I went to see him; and having a rose
in my bosom, I took it out, and placed on his breast.Death had not
disfigured him.Though very thin, his bones were not protuberant.He was
not wrinkled, and had lost very little hair.His voice was very strong even to his last moments.He often exclaimed,
oh, lord help me!He
groaned deeply, and when a question was put to him, calling him by his
name, he opened his eyes, as if waking from a dream.He never answered
the question, but asked one himself; as, what is it o'clock, &c.

On the ninth of June my son and I, and a few of Thomas Paine's friends,
set off with the corpse to New Rochelle, a place 22 miles from New York.It was my intention to have him buried in the Orchard of his own farm;
but the farmer who lived there at that time said, that Thomas Paine,
walking with him one day, said, pointing to another part of the land, he
was desirous of being buried there."Then," said I, "that shall be
the place of his burial."And, my instructions were accordingly put in
execution.The head-stone was put up about a week afterwards with the
following inscription: "Thomas Paine, Author of "Common Sense," died
the eighth of June, 1809, aged 72 years."According to his will, a wall
twelve feet square was erected round his tomb.Four trees have been
planted outside the wall, two weeping willows and two cypresses.Many
persons have taken away pieces of the tombstone and of the trees, in
memory of the deceased; foreigners especially have been eager to obtain
these memorials, some of which have been sent to England.* They have
been put in frames and preserved.Verses in honor of Paine have been
written on the head stone.The grave is situated at the angle of the
farm, by the entrance to it.This interment was a scene to affect and to wound any sensible heart.Contemplating who it was, what man it was, that we were committing to an
obscure grave on an open and disregarded bit of land, I could not help
feeling most acutely.Before the earth was thrown down upon the coffin,
I, placing myself at the east end of the grave, said to my son Benjamin,
"stand you there, at the other end, as a witness for grateful America."Looking round me, and beholding the small group of spectators, I
exclaimed, as the earth was tumbled into the grave, "Oh!My
son stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I, for
France!"This was the funeral ceremony of this great politician and
philosopher!**

     * The breaking of the original gravestone has been
     traditionally ascribed to pious hatred.A fragment of it,
     now in New York, is sometimes shown at celebrations of
     Paine's birthday as a witness of the ferocity vented on
     Paine's grave.It is satisfactory to find another
     interpretation.** Paine's friends, as we have said, were too poor to leave
     their work in the city, which had refused Paine a grave.Robert Bolton, in his History of Westchester County,
     introduces Cheetham's slanders of Paine with the words: "as
     his own biographer remarks."But even Cheetham
     does not lie enough for Bolton, who says: "His [Paine's]
     body was brought up from New York in a hearse used for
     carrying the dead, to Potter's Field; a white man drove the
     vehicle, accompanied by a <DW64> to dig the grave."The whole
     Judas legend is in that allusion to Potter's Field.Such
     is history, where Paine is concerned!The eighty-eight acres of the north part were sold at 25 dollars an
acre.The half of the south (the share of Thomas de Bonneville) has been
sold for the total sum of 1425 dollars.The other part of the south,
which was left to Benjamin de Bonneville, has just (1819) been sold in
lots, reserving the spot in which Thomas Paine was buried, being a piece
of land 45 feet square._Thomas Paine's posthumous works_.He left the manuscript of his answer
to Bishop Watson; the Third Part of his Age of Reason; several pieces
on Religious subjects, prose and verse.The great part of his posthumous
political works will be found in the Appendix.Some correspondences
cannot be, as yet, published.*

In _Mechanics_ he has left two models of wheels for carriages, and of
a machine to plane boards.Of the two models of bridges, left at the
Philadelphia Museum, only one has been preserved, and that in great
disorder, one side being taken entirely off.But, I must say here, that
it was then out of the hands of Mr.Though it is difficult, at present, to make some people believe that,
instead of being looked on as a deist and a drunkard, Paine ought to be
viewed as a philosopher and a truly benevolent man, future generations
will make amends for the errors of their forefathers, by regarding
him as a most worthy man, and by estimating his talents and character
according to their real worth.Thomas Paine was about five feet nine inches high, English measure, and
about five feet six French measure.His bust was well proportioned;
and his face oblong.Reflexion was the great expression of his face;
in which was always seen the calm proceeding from a conscience void of
reproach.His eye, which was black, was lively and piercing, and told
us that he saw into the very heart of hearts [of any one who wished to
deceive him].***

     * All except the first two MSS., of which fragments exist,
     and some poems, were no doubt consumed at St.Louis, as
     stated in the Introduction to this work.** I have vainly searched in Philadelphia for some relic of
     Paine's bridges.In this paragraph and some
     that follow the hand of Nicolas Bonneville is, I think,
     discernible.A most benignant smile expressed what he felt upon receiving an
affectionate salutation, or praise delicately conveyed.His leg and
foot were elegant, and he stood and walked upright, without stiffness or
affectation.[He never wore a sword nor cane], but often walked with
his hat in one hand and with his other hand behind his back.His
countenance, when walking, was generally thoughtful.In receiving
salutations he bowed very gracefully, and, if from an acquaintance, he
did not begin with "how d' ye do?"If they had
none, he gave them his.His beard, his lips, his head, the motion of his
eye-brow, all aided in developing his mind.Was he where he got at the English or American newspapers, he hastened
to over-run them all, like those who read to make extracts for their
paper.His first glance was for the funds, which, in spite of
jobbing and the tricks of government, he always looked on as the
sure thermometer of public affairs.Parliamentary Debates, the Bills,
concealing a true or sham opposition of such or such orators, the secret
pay and violent theatrical declamation, or the revelations of public or
private meetings at the taverns; these interested him so much that he
longed for an ear and a heart to pour forth all his soul.When he
added that he knew the Republican or the hypocrite, he would affirm,
beforehand, that such or such a bill, such or such a measure, would
take place; and very seldom, in such a case, the cunning politic or the
clear-sighted observer was mistaken in his assertions; for they were not
for him mere conjectures.He spoke of a future event as of a thing past
and consummated.In a country where the slightest steps are expanded to
open day, where the feeblest connexions are known from their beginning,
and with all the views of ambition, of interest or rivalship, it is
almost impossible to escape the eye of such an observer as Thomas Paine,
whom no private interest could blind or bewitch, as was said by the
clear-sighted Michael Montaigne.His writings are generally perspicuous and full of light, and often they
discover the sardonic and sharp smile of Voltaire.One may see that he
wishes to wound to the quick; and that he hugs himself in his success.But Voltaire all at once overruns an immense space and resumes his
vehement and dramatic step: Paine stops you, and points to the place
where you ought to smile with him at the ingenious traits; a gift to
envy and stupidity.Thomas Paine did not like to be questioned.He used to say, that he
thought nothing more impertinent, than to say to any body: "What do
you think of that?"On his arrival at New York, he went to see General
Gates.After the usual words of salutation, the General said: "I have
always had it in mind, if I ever saw you again, to ask you whether you
were married, as people have said."Paine not answering, the General
went on: "Tell me how it is.""I never," said Paine, "answer impertinent
questions."Seemingly insensible and hard to himself, he was not so to the just
wailings of the unhappy.Without any vehement expression of his sorrow,
you might see him calling up all his powers, walking silently, thinking
of the best means of consoling the unfortunate applicant; and never did
they go from him without some rays of hope.And as his will was firm and
settled, his efforts were always successful.The man hardened in vice
and in courts [of law], yields more easily than one imagines to the
manly entreaties of a disinterested benefactor.* At this point are the words: "Barlow's letter [i. e. to
     Cheetham] we agreed to suppress."Thomas Paine loved his friends with sincere and tender affection.His simplicity of heart and that happy kind of openness, or rather,
carelessness, which charms our hearts in reading the fables of the good
Lafontaine, made him extremely amiable.If little children were near him
he patted them, searched his pockets for the store of cakes, biscuits,
sugarplums, pieces of sugar, of which he used to take possession as of
a treasure belonging to them, and the distribution of which belonged to
him.* His conversation was unaffectedly simple and frank; his language
natural; always abounding in curious anecdotes.He justly and fully
seized the characters of all those of whom he related any singular
traits.For his conversation was satyrick, instructive, full of
witticisms.If he related an anecdote a second time, it was always in
the same words and the same tone, like a comic actor who knows the place
where he is to be applauded.He neither cut the tale short nor told it
too circumstantially.It was real conversation, enlivened by digressions
well brought in.The vivacity of his mind, and the numerous scenes
of which he had been a spectator, or in which he had been an actor,
rendered his narrations the more animated, his conversation more
endearing.Politics were his favorite subject
He never spoke on religious subjects, unless pressed to it, and never
disputed about such matters.He could not speak French: he could
understand it tolerably well when spoken to him, and he understood it
when on paper perfectly well.He never went to the theatre: never spoke
on dramatic subjects.He did
not like it: he said it was not a serious thing, but a sport of the
mind, which often had not common sense.His common reading was the
affairs of the day; not a single newspaper escaped him; not a political
discussion: he knew how to strike while the iron was hot; and, as he
was always on the watch, he was always ready to write.Hence all his
pamphlets have been popular and powerful.He wrote with composure and
steadiness, as if under the guidance of a tutelary genius.If, for an
instant, he stopped, it was always in the attitude of a man who
listens.The Saint Jerome of Raphael would give a perfect idea of his
contemplative recollection, to listen to the voice from on high which
makes itself heard in the heart.[It will be proper, I believe, to say here, that shortly after the Death
of Thomas Paine a book appeared, under the Title of: The Life of Thomas
Paine, by Cheethatn.In this libel my character was calumniated.I cited
the Author before the Criminal Court of New York, He was tried and in
spite of all his manoeuvres, he was found guilty.--M.This last paragraph, in brackets, is in the writing of Madame
Bonneville.Robert Waters, of Jersey City, a biographer
of Cobbett, for the suggestion, made through a friend, and so amply
justified, that information concerning Paine might be derived from the
Cobbett papers.APPENDIX B. THE HALL MANUSCRIPTS

In 1785, John Hall, an able mechanician and admirable man, emigrated
from Leicester, England, to Philadelphia, He carried letters to Paine,
who found him a man after his own heart I am indebted to his relatives,
Dr.Dutton Steele of Philadelphia and the Misses Steele, for Hall's
journals, which extend over many years.It will be seen that the papers
are of historical importance apart from their records concerning Paine.Hall's entries of his daily intercourse with Paine, which he never
dreamed would see the light, represent a portraiture such as has rarely
been secured of any character in history.The extent already reached by
this work compels me to omit much that would impress the reader with the
excellent work of John Hall himself, who largely advanced ironwork in
New Jersey, and whose grave at Flemmington, surrounded by those of the
relatives that followed him, and near the library and workshop he left,
merits a noble monument."I went a day or two past with the Captain and his lady to see the
exhibition of patriotic paintings.Paine the author of Common Sense is
amongst them.He went from England (had been usher to a school) on board
the same vessel that our Captain [Coltman] went in last time; their
acquaintance then commenced and has continued ever since.He resides
now in Bordentown in the Jerseys, and it is probable that I may see him
before it be long as when he comes to town the Captain says he is
sure to call on him.It is supposed the various States have made his
circumstances easy--General Washington, said if they did not provide for
him he would himself.I think his services were as useful as the sword."Pain by his Boy, informing us
of his coming this day.Kerbright
[Kirkbride], and another gentleman came to our door in a waggon.Pain told us a tale of the Indians, he being at a
meeting of them with others to settle some affairs in 1776.Pain's--not to give a deciding opinion between
two persons you are in friendship with, lest you lose one by it; whilst
doing that between two persons, your supposed enemies, may make one your
friend.With much pain drawd the Board in at Hanna's chamber window to
work Mr.I pinned 6 more arches together which makes
the whole 9.Pain gives me some wine and water as I
was very dry.[The December journal is mainly occupied with mention of Paine's
visitors Franklin, Gouverneur Morris, Dr.Rush, Tench Francis, Robert
Morris, Rittenhouse, Redman.A rubber of whist in which Paine won is
mentioned.]Franklin today;
staid till after tea in the evening.They tried the burning of our
candles by blowing a gentle current through them.The draught of air is prevented by passing through a cold
tube of tallow.The tin of the new lamp by internal reflections is
heated and causes a constant current This is the Doctor's conjecture.[Concerning Paine's candle see i., p.We sent to all the places we could
suppose him to be at and no tidings of him.We became very unhappy
fearing his political enemies should have shown him foul play.Went to
bed at 10 o.c, and about 2 o.c.Before 7 o'c a brother saint-maker came with a model of
machine to drive boats against stream.* He had communicated his scheme
to H. who had made alterations and a company had taken it and refused
saint-maker partnership.He would fain have given it to Mr.Paine or me,
but I a stranger refused and Mr.Paine had enough hobbys of his own.Paine pointed out a mode to simplify his apparatus greatly.This saint-maker is John
     Fitch, the "H."This entry is of
     much interest.The first steamer seems
     to have gone begging!Paine asked me to go and see Indian Chiefs of Sennaka
Nation, I gladly assented.Paine wished
to see him and made himself known to him by past remembrance as Common
Sense, and was introduced into the room, addressed them as "brothers"
and shook hands cordially Mr.Colonel Kirkbride is the gentleman in whose
family I am.My patron [Paine] is likewise a boarder and makes his home
here I am diligently employed in Saint making, now in Iron that I had
before finished in wood, with some improvements, but you may come and
see what it is.Skepticism and Credulity are as general here as
elsewhere, for what I see.In this town is a Quaker meeting and one of
another class--I suppose of the Baptist cast--And a person in town a
Tailor by trade that goes about a-soulmending on Sundays to various
places, as most necessary, or I suppose advantageous, to himself; for by
one trade or the other he has built himself a very elegant frame house
in this town.This man's way to Heaven is somewhat different to the
other.I am informed he makes publick dippings &c. My Employer has
_Common Sense enough_ to disbelieve most of the Common Systematic
Theories of Divinity but does not seem to establish any for himself.The
Colonel [Kirkbride] is as Free as John Coltman.[Under date of New York, July 31st, Hall writes an account of a journey
with Paine to Morrisania, to visit Gen.Morris, and afterwards to the
farm at New Rochelle, of which he gives particulars already known to my
reader.]Letter of Paine to John Hall, at Capt.Coltman's, in Letitia Court,
Market St, between Front and Second St.Philadelphia:

"Bordentown, Sep.22, 1786.--Old Friend: In the first place I have
settled with Mr.Gordon for the time he has been in the house--in the
second I have put Mrs.Read who, you know has part of our house Col.Kirkbride's but is at this time at Lancaster, in possession by putting
part of her goods into it.* By this means we shall have room at our
house (Col.Kirkbride) for carrying on our operations.As Philadelphia
is so injurious to your health and as apartments at Wm.Foulke's would
not be convenient to you, we can now conveniently make room for you
here.Kirkbride mentioned this to me herself and it is by the
choice of both her and Col.I wish you could
come up to-morrow (Sunday) and bring the iron with you.I shall be
backward and forward between here and Philadelphia pretty often until
the elections are over, but we can make a beginning here and what more
iron we may want we can get at the Delaware Works, and if you should
want to go to Mount hope you can more conveniently go from here than
from Philadelphia--thus you see I have done your business since I
have been up.Henry who is member for
Lancaster County.I do not know where he lodges, but if William will
be so good as to give it to the door keeper or Clerk of the Assembly it
will be safe.Read was thus transferred to Paine's own house.Her
     husband died next year and Paine declined to receive any
     rent.Your coming here will give an opportunity to Joseph to get acquainted
with Col.K. who will very freely give any information in his power.servt"

Undated letter of Paine to John Hall, in Philadelphia:

"Fryday Noon.--Old Friend: Inclosed (as the man said by the horse) I
send you the battau, as I wish to present it as neat and clean as can be
done; I commit it to your care.The sooner it is got on Board the vessel
the better.I shall set off from here on Monday and expect to be in New
York on Tuesday.I shall take all the tools that are here with me and
wish you would take some with you, that if we should get on a working
fit we may have some to work with.Let me hear from you by the Sunday's
boat and send me the name of the vessel and Captain you go with and what
owners they belong to at New York, or what merchants they go to.I wrote
to you by the last boat, and Peter tells me he gave the letter to Capt.Haines, but Joe says that he enquired for letters and was told there was
none--wishing you an agreeable voyage and meeting at New York, I am your
friend, and humble servant.Kirkbride's and Polly's compt."3 (1786) "Dashwood Park, of Captain Roberts: On
Thursday morning early Sept.28th I took the stage wagon for Trenton.Jo
had gone up by water the day before to a sale of land and a very capital
iron works and nailing with a large corn mill.It was a fair sale there
was a forge and rolling and slitting mill upon an extensive scale the
man has failed--The works with about 60 or 70 acres of land were sold
for L9000 currency.Then was put up about 400 acres of land and sold for
L2700 currency and I believe a good bargain; and bought by a friend of
mine called Common Sense--Who I believe had no idea of purchasing it
when he came there.He took Jo to Bordentown with him that night and
they came to look at it the next day; then Jo went into the Jerseys
to find a countryman named Burges but was disappointed Came back to
Bordentown and on Saturday looked all over Mr.Paine's purchase along
with him and believes it bought well worth money.Paine told us an anecdote of a French noble's applying to
Dr.Franklin, as the Americans had put away their King, and that nation
having formerly chosen a King from Normandy, he offered his service and
wished him to lay his letter before Congress.Paine observed that
Britain is the most expensive government in the world.She gives a King
a million a year and falls down and worships him.Last night he brought me in my room a pair of warm cloth
overshoes as feel very comfortable this morning Had a wooden pot stove
stand betwixt my feet by Mr.Paine's desire and found it kept my feet
warm.As soon as breakfast was over mounted Button [Paine's
horse] and set off for Philadelphia.Paine $120 in gold
and silver.Day was devoted to rivetting the bars, and
punching the upper bar for the bannisters [of the bridge].Kirkbride
and Polly went to hear a David Jones preach a rhodomontade sermon about
the Devil, Mary Magdalen, and against deists, etc.This day employed in raising and putting on the abutments
again and fitting them.The smith made the nuts of screws to go easier.Then set the ribs at proper distance, and after dinner I and Jackaway [?
]put on some temporary pieces on the frame of wood to hold it straight,
and when Mr.Pain came they then tied it on its wooden frame with strong
cords.I then saw that it had bulged full on one side and hollow on the
other.I told him of it, and he said it was done by me--I denied that
and words rose high.I at length swore by God that it was straight when
I left it, he replied as positively the contrary, and I think myself ill
used in this affair.We arrived
in town about 5 o.clock took our bags to Capt Coltmans, and then went
down to Dr.Franklin's, and helped unload the bridge.Paine called
on me; gave us an anecdote of Dr.Paine asking him of
the value of any new European publication; he had not been informed of
any of importance.There were some religious posthumous anecdotes of
Doctor Johnson, of resolves he had made and broken though he had prayed
for power and strength to keep them; which showed the Doctor said that
he had not much interest there.And such things had better be suppressed
as nobody had anything to do betwixt God and man.Went with Glentworth to see the Bridge at Dr.Rittenhouse; returned with them
and helped move it for all three to stand upon, and then turned it to
examine.Rittenhouse has no doubt of its strength and sufficiency
for the Schuylkill, but wished to know what quantity of iron [it would
require,] as he seemed to think it too expensive.The Bank bill called but postponed
until tomorrow.Pain's letter read, and leave given to exhibit the
Bridge at the State House to be viewed by the members.Pain, who told me Donnalson had been to see and [stand]
upon his Bridge, and admitted its strength and powers.Then took a walk
beyond Vine street, and passed by the shop where the steamboat apparatus
is.Pain at our house, and talking on the Bank affair brought on a
dispute between Mr.Pain and the Captain [Coltman] in which words were
very high.A reflection from Captain C. on publications in favour of the
Bank having lost them considerable, he [Paine] instantly took that as a
reflection on himself, and swore by G--d, let who would, it was a lie.I then left the room and went up stairs.They quarrelled a considerable
time, but at length parted tolerably coolly.Dinner being ready I went
down; but the Captain continued talking about politics and the Bank, and
what he thought the misconduct of Mr.Pain in his being out and in with
the several parties.Pain in some things
relating thereto, by saying it was good sense in changing his ground
when any party was going wrong,--and that he seemed to delight in
difficulties, in Mechanics particularly, and was pleased in them.The
Captain grew warm, and said he knew now he could not eat his dinner.[Here followed a sharp personal quarrel between Hall and Coltman.]Paine came in and wished me to be assisting in carrying
the model to the State House.Franklin's and fetched the
Bridge to the Committee Room.Our Saint I have assisted in moving to the State House and
there placed in their Committee room, as by a letter addressed to this
Speaker they admitted.And by the desire of my patron (who is not an
early riser) I attended to give any information to inquiries until
he came.And then I was present when the Assembly with their Speaker
inspected it and many other persons as philosophers, Mechanics Statesmen
and even Tailors.I observed their sentiments and opinions of it were as
different as their features.The philosopher said it would add new
light to the great utility.And the tailor (for it is an absolute truth)
remarked it cut a pretty figure.It is yet to be laid (or by the by
stand) before the Council of State.Then the Philosophical Society and
all the other Learned Bodies in this city.And then to be canonised by
an Act of State which is solicited to incorporate a body of men to adopt
and realise or Brobdinag this our Lilliputian handywork, that is now 13
feet long on a Scale of one to 24.And then will be added another to the
world's present Wonders.Pain called in and left me the intended Act of Assembly
for a Bridge Company, who are to subscribe $33,330 50/99 then are to
be put in possession of the present Bridge and premises to answer the
interest of their money until they erect a new one; and after they have
erected a new one, and the money arising from it amounts to more
than pays interest, it is to become a fund to pay off the principal
stockholders, and then the Bridge to become free.Pain called in;
I gave him my Bill--told him I had charged one day's work and a pair of
gloves.Paine's boy called on time to [inquire] of the money
spent.Paine called this evening; told me of his being with Dr.Franklin and about the chess player, or Automaton, and that the Dr.Paine has had several
visitors, as Mr.Logan, &c.

Sunday April 16th Prepared to attend Mr.Paine's horse and chair came, mounted and drove through a barren sandy
country arrived at Bordentown at half past one-o'clock for dinner.This
is the pleasantest situation I have seen in this country.Sitting in the house saw a chair pass down the street
with a red coat on, and going out after it believed it to be Mr.Paine,
so followed him up to Collins's, where he was enquiring where I boarded.I just then called to him, and went with him to Whight's Tavern, and
there he paid me the money I had laid down for him.He is now going
for England by way of France in the French packet which sails the 25th
instant.He asked me to take a ride, and as the stage was not come in
and he going the road I gladly took the opportunity, as I could return
on meeting the stage.On the journey he told me of the Committee's
proceedings on Bridges and Sewers; anecdotes of Dr.Franklin, who had
sent a letter by him to the president, or some person, to communicate to
the Society of Civil Architects, who superintend solely over bridges in
France.The model is packed up to go with him.The Doctor, though full
of employ from the Vice President being ill, and the numerous visitors
on State business, and others that his fame justly procures him,
could hardly be supposed to pay great attention to trifles; but as he
considers Mr.Paine his adopted political Son he would endeavor to
write by him to his friends, though Mr.Paine did not press, for reasons
above.In 2 or 3 days he sent him up to Bordentown no less than a dozen
letters to his acquaintance in France.--He told me many anecdotes of the
Doctor, relating to national and political concerns, and observations of
many aged and sensible men of his acquaintance in that country.And the
treaty that he the Doctor made with the late King of Prussia by adding
an article that, should war ever break out, (though never a probability
of it) Commerce should be left free.The Doctor said he showed it to the
French minister, Vergennes, who said it met his idea, and was such as he
would make even with England, though he knew they would not,--they were
so fond of robbing and plundering.And the Doctor had gathered a hint
from a Du Quesney that no nation could properly expect to gain by
endeavoring to suppress his neighbor, for riches were to be gained from
amongst the rich and not from poor neighbors; and a National reciprocity
was as much necessary as a domestic one, or [inter] national trade as
necessary to be free as amongst the people of a country.Such and many
more hints passed in riding 2 or 3 miles, until we met the stage.I then
shook hands and wished him a good voyage and parted.Letter from Flemmington, N. J., May 16, 1788, to John Coltman,
Leicester, England:

"Friend John: Tell that disbelieving sceptical Infidel thy Father that
he has wounded my honor, What!Bought the Coat at a rag shop--does he
think I would palm such a falsity both upon Gray and Green heads!did
not I send you word it was General Washington's.And does he think I
shall slanderously brook such a slanderous indignity--No!I tell him
the first Ink that meanders from my pen, which shall be instantly on my
setting foot on Brittains Isle, shall be to call him to account.I 'll
haul out his Callous Leaden soul with its brother!"In the late revolution the provincial army lying near Princeton New
Jersey one Sunday General Washington and Common Sense each in their
chairs rode down there to Meeting Common Sense put up his at a friend's
one Mrs.Morgan's and pulling off his great coat put it in the care of
a servant man, and as I remember he was of the pure Irish Extraction;
he walked then to meeting and then slipped off with said great coat and
some plate of Mr.On their return they found what had been done
in their absence and relating it to the General his answer was it was
necessary to watch as well as pray--but told him he had two and would
lend or give him one--and that is the Coat I sent and the fact as
related to me and others in public by said [Common Sense.]Nor do I
believe that Rome or the whole Romish Church has a better attested
miracle in her whole Catalogue than the above--though I dont wish to
deem it a miracle, nor do I believe there is any miracle upon record for
these 18 hundred years so true as that being General Washington's great
coat.--I, labouring hard for said Common Sense at Bordentown, the said
coat was hung up to keep snow out of the room.I often told him I should
expect that for my pains, but he never would say I should; but having
a chest there I took care and locked it up when I had finished my work,
and sent it to you.So far are these historical facts--Maybe sometime
hence I may collect dates and periods to them--But why should they be
disputed?has not the world adopted as true a-many affairs without date
and of less moment than this, and even pay what is called a holy regard
to them?"If you communicate this to your Father and he feels a compunction for
the above crime and will signify the same by letter, he will find I
strictly adhere to the precepts of Christianity and shall forgive.--If
not------

"My best wishes to you all,

"John Hall."John
Coltman's, Shambles Lane, Leicester, England.""My old Friend: I am very happy to see a letter from you, and to hear
that our Friends on the other side the water are well.The Bridge has
been put up, but being on wood butments they yielded, and it is now
taken down.The first rib as an experiment was erected between two steel
furnaces which supported it firmly; it contained not quite three tons of
iron, was ninety feet span, height of the arch five feet; it was loaded
with six tons of iron, which remained upon it a twelve month.At present
I am engaged on my political Bridge.I shall bring out a new work
(Second part of the Rights of Man) soon after New Year.It will produce
something one way or other.I see the tide is yet the wrong way, but
there is a change of sentiment beginning.I have so far got the ear of
John Bull that he will read what I write--which is more than ever was
done before to the same extent.Rights of Man has had the greatest
run of anything ever published in this country, at least of late
years--almost sixteen thousand has gone off--and in Ireland above forty
thousand--besides the above numbers one thousand printed cheap are now
gone to Scotland by desire from some of the [friends] there.I have been
applied to from Birmingham for leave to print ten thousand copies, but
I intend, after the next work has had its run among those who will have
handsome printed books and fine paper, to print an hundred thousand
copies of each work and distribute them at sixpence a-piece; but this I
do not at present talk of, because it will alarm the wise mad folks at
St.Jefferson who mentioned
the great run it has had there.It has been attacked by John Adams, who
has brought an host about his ears from all parts of the Continent.Jefferson has sent me twenty five different answers to Adams who wrote
under the signature of Publicola.A letter is somewhere in the city for
me from Mr.I hope to receive it in a few days.I shall be glad at all times to see, or hear from you.Write to me
(under cover) to Gordon, Booksellers N: 166 Fleet Street, before
you leave Leicester.How far is it from thence to Rotherham?"P. S. I have done you the compliment of answering your favor the inst.it which is more than I have done by any other--were I to ans.all the letters I receive--I should require half a dozen clerks."Extracts from John Hall's letters from London, England: London, January
1792 Burke's publication has produced one way or other near 50 different
answers and publications.Nothing of late ever has been so read as
Paine's answer.Sometime shortly he will publish a second part of the
Rights of Man.His first part was scrutinized by the Privy Council
held on purpose and through fear of making him more popular deemed too
contemptible for Government notice.The sale of it for a day or two was
rather retarded or not publickly disposed of until it was known by the
printers that it would not be noticed by Government.John Hall to a friend in England:

"London, Nov.I dined yesterday with the Revolution Society at
the London Tavern.A very large company assembled and after dinner
many truly noble and patriotic toasts were drank.The most prominent
were--The Rights of Man--with 3 times &c.--The Revolution of France--The
Revolution of the World--May all the armies of tyrants learn the
Brunswick March--May the tree of Liberty be planted in every tyrant
city, and may it be an evergreen.The utmost unanimity prevailed through
the company, and several very excellent songs in favor of Liberty
were sung.Every bosom felt the divine glow of patriotism and love
of universal freedom.For my part I was
transported at the scene.It happened that a company of Aristocratic
french and Spanish merchants were met in the very room under, and
Horne Tooke got up and sarcastically requested the company not to wound
the tender feelings of the gentlemen by too much festivity.This sarcasm
was followed by such a burst of applause as I never before heard."From J. Redman, London, Tuesday Dec.18, 5 p. m. to John Hall,
Leicester, England: "Mr.Erskine
shone like the morning-Star.The instant Erskine
closed his speech the venal jury interrupted the Attorney General, who
was about to make a reply, and without waiting for any answer, or any
summing up by the Judge, pronounced him guilty.Such an instance of
infernal corruption is scarcely upon record.I have not time to express
my indignant feelings on this occasion.At this moment, while I write,
the mob is drawing Erskine's carriage home, he riding in triumph--his
horses led by another party.Riots at Cambridge, Manchester, Bridport
Dorset &c.&c. O England, how art thou fallen!I am just now told that
press warrants are issued today.[John Hall's London Journal (1792) records frequent meetings there with
Paine.Paine going to dress on an invitation to dine
with the Athenians.He leaves town for a few days to see his aunt."Paine goes out of town tomorrow to compose what I call
Burke's Funeral Sermon."Paine looking well and in high
spirits."Does not seem to
talk much, rather on a reserve, of the prospect of political affairs.He had a letter from G. Washington and Jefferson by the ambassador
[Pinckney]."The majority of entries merely mention meeting Paine, whose
name, by the way, after the prosecution was instituted, Hall prudently
writes "P------n."He also tells the story of Burke's pension.]Had a ride to Bordentown to see Mr.He was well and appeared jollyer than I had ever known him.He is full of whims and schemes and mechanical inventions, and is to
build a place or shop to carry them into execution, and wants my help."APPENDIX C. PORTRAITS OF PAINE

At the age of thirty Paine was somewhat stout, and very athletic; but
after his arrival in America (1774) he was rather slender.His height
was five feet, nine inches.He had a prominent nose, somewhat like that
of Ralph Waldo Emerson.It may have impressed Bonaparte, who insisted,
it is said, that a marshal must have a large nose.Paine's mouth was
delicate, his chin also; he wore no whiskers or beard until too feeble
with age to shave.His forehead was lofty and unfurrowed; his head
long, the occiput feeble.His complexion was ruddy,--thoroughly English.Charles Lee, during the American revolution, described him as "the man
who has genius in his eyes;" Carlyle quotes from Foster an observation
on the brilliancy of Paine's eyes, as he sat in the French Convention.His figure, as given in an early French portrait, is shapely; its
elegance was often remarked.A year or so after his return to America he
is shown in a contemporary picture as somewhat stout again, if one may
judge by the face.This was probably a result of insufficient exercise,
on which he much depended.He was an expert horseman, and, in health, an
unwearied walker.He loved music, and could join well in a chorus.There are eleven original portraits of Thomas Paine, besides a
death-mask, a bust, and the profile copied in this work from a seal used
on the release at Lewes, elsewhere cited (i., p.That gives some
idea of the head and face at the age of thirty-five.I have a picture
said to be that of Paine in his youth, but the dress is an anachronism.The earliest portrait of Paine was painted by Charles Willson Peale, in
Philadelphia, probably in some early year of the American Revolution,
for Thomas Brand Hollis, of London,--the benefactor of Harvard
University, one of whose halls bears his name.The same artist painted
another portrait of Paine, now badly placed in Independence Hall.There
must have been an early engraving from one of Peale's pictures, for John
Hall writes October 31, 1786: "A print of Common Sense, if any of my
friends want one, may be had by sending to the printshops in London,
but they have put a wrong name to it, his being Thomas."* The Hollis
portrait was engraved in London, 1791, underlined "by Peel [sic] of
Philadelphia," and published, July 25th, by J. Ridgway, York Street, St.Paine holds an open book bearing the words, "Rights of
Man," where Peale probably had "Common Sense."On a table with inkstand
and pens rests Paine's right elbow, the hand supporting his chin.The
full face appears--young, handsome, gay; the wig is frizzed, a bit of
the queue visible.In all of the original portraits of Paine his dress
is neat and in accordance with fashion, but in this Hollis picture it
is rather fine: the loose sleeves are ornamentally corded, and large
wristbands of white lace fall on the cuffs.The only engraving I have found with
     "Toia" was published in London in 1800.Can there be a
     portrait lost under some other name?While Paine and Jefferson were together in Paris (1787) Paine wrote him
a note, August 18th, in which he says: "The second part of your letter,
concerning taking my picture, I must feel as an honor done to me, not
as a favor asked of me--but in this, as in other matters, I am at the
disposal of your friendship."As Jefferson does not appear to have
possessed such a portrait, the request was probably made through him.I
incline to identify this portrait with an extremely interesting one, now
in this country, by an unknown artist.It is one of twelve symmetrical
portraits of revolutionary leaders,--the others being Marat,
Robespierre, Lafayette, Mirabeau, Danton, Brissot, Petion, Camille
Desmoulins, Billaud de Varennes, Gensonne, Clermont Tonnere.These
pictures were reproduced in cheap woodcuts and distributed about France
during the Revolution.Lowry, of
South Carolina, and brought to Charleston during the Revolution.At
the beginning of the civil war they were buried in leaden cases at
Williamstown, South Carolina.At the end of the war they were conveyed
to Charleston, where they remained, in the possession of a Mrs.Cole,
until purchased by their present owner, Mr.Alfred Ames Howlett, of
Syracuse, New York.As Mirabeau is included, the series must have been
begun at an early phase of the revolutionary agitation.The face of
Paine here strongly resembles that in Independence Hall.The picture
is about two feet high; the whole figure is given, and is dressed in an
elegant statesmanlike fashion, with fine cravat and silk stockings from
the knee.The table and room indicate official position, but it is the
same room as in nine of the other portraits.It is to be hoped that
further light may be obtained concerning these portraits.Well-dressed also, but notably unlike the preceding, is the "Bonneville
Paine," one of a celebrated series of two hundred engraved portraits,
the publication of which in quarto volumes was begun in Paris in
1796.et sculpsit" is its whole history.Paine is
described in it as "Ex Depute a la Convention Nationale," which would
mean strictly some time between his expulsion from that assembly
in December, 1793, and his recall to it a year later.It could not,
however, have been then taken, on account of Paine's imprisonment and
illness.It was probably made by F. Bonneville when Paine had gone to
reside with Nicolas Bonneville in the spring of 1797.It is an admirable
picture in every way, but especially in bringing out the large and
expressive eyes.The hair is here free and flowing; the dress identical
with that of the portrait by Jarvis in this work.The best-known picture of Paine is that painted by his friend George
Romney, in 1792.I have inquired through London _Notes and Queries_
after the original, which long ago disappeared, and a claimant turned up
in Birmingham, England; but in this the hand holds a book, and Sharp's
engraving shows no hand.The large engraving by W. Sharp was published April 20, 1793, and the
smaller in 1794.A reproduction by Illman were a fit frontispiece for
Cheetham (what satirical things names are sometimes), but ought not
to have got into Gilbert Vale's popular biography of Paine.That and
a reproduction by Wright in the Mendum edition of Paine's works, have
spread through this country something little better than a caricature;
and one Sweden has subjected Truelove's edition, in England, to a
like misfortune.Paine's friends, Rickman, Constable, and others, were
satisfied by the Romney picture, and I have seen in G. J. Holyoake's
library a proof of the large engraving, with an inscription on the back
by Paine, who presented it to Rickman.It is the English Paine, in all
his vigor, and in the thick of his conflict with Burke, but, noble as
it is, has not the gentler and more poetic expression which Bonneville
found in the liberated prisoner surrounded by affectionate friends.Romney and Sharp were both well acquainted with Paine.A picturesque Paine is one engraved for Baxter's "History of England,"
and published by Symonds, July 2, 1796.Dressed with great elegance,
Paine stands pointing to a scroll in his left hand, inscribed "Rights
of Man."Above his head, on a frame design, a pen lies on a roll marked
"Equality."The face is handsome and the likeness good

A miniature by H. Richards is known to me only as engraved by K.
Mackenzie, and published March 31, 1800, by G. Gawthorne, British
Library, Strand, London.It is the only portrait that has beneath it
"Tom Paine."It represents Paine as rather stout, and the face broad.It is powerful, but the least pleasing of the portraits.The picture in
Vale resembles this more than the Romney it professes to copy.I have in my possession a wood engraving of Paine, which gives no trace
of its source or period.It is a vigorous profile, which might have
been made in London during the excitement over the "Rights of Man," for
popular distribution.It has no wig, and shows the head extraordinarily
long, and without much occiput It is pre-eminently the English radical
leader.Before speaking of Jarvis' great portrait of Paine, I mention a later
one by him which Mr.William Erving, of New York, has added to my
collection.It would appear to have been circulated at the time of his
death.The lettering beneath, following a facsimile autograph, is: "J.
W. Jarvis, pinx.J- R. Ames, del.--L'Homme des Deux Mondes.Born
at Thetford, England, Jan.Died at Greenwich, New
York, June 8, 1809."Above the cheap wood-cut is: "A tribute to Paine."On the right, at the top, is a globe, showing the outlines of the
Americas, France, England, and Africa.It is supported by the wing of a
dove with large olive-branch.On the left upper corner is an open book
inscribed: "Rights of Man.Crisis": supported by a scroll
with "Doing justice, loving mercy.From this book rays
break out and illumine the globe opposite.A lower corner shows the
balances, and the liberty-cap on a pole, the left being occupied by the
United States flag and that of France.Beneath are the broken chain,
crown, sword, and other emblems of oppression.A frame rises showing a
plumb line, at the top of which the key of the Bastille is crossed by
a pen, on Paine's breast.The portrait is surrounded by a "Freedom's
Wreath" in which are traceable the floral emblems of all nations.The
wreath is bound with a fascia, on which appear, by twos, the following
names: "Washington, Monroe; Jefferson, Franklin; J. Stewart, E. Palmer;
Barlow, Rush; M. Wollstone-craft, M. B. Bonneville; Clio Rickman, J.
Home Tooke; Lafayette, Brissot."The portrait of Paine represents him with an unusually full face,
as compared with earlier pictures, and a most noble and benevolent
expression.The white cravat and dress are elegant.What has become of
the original of this second picture by the elder Jarvis?It might easily
have fallen to some person who might not recognize it as meant for
Paine, though to one who has studied his countenance it conveys the
impression of what he probably would have been at sixty-eight.About two
years later a drawing was made of Paine by William Constable, which I
saw at the house of his nephew, Dr.Clair J. Grece, Redhill, England.It
reveals the ravages of age, but conveys a vivid impression of the man's
power.After Paine's death Jarvis took a cast of his face.Laurence
Hutton has had for many years this death-mask which was formerly in the
establishment of Fowler and Wells, the phrenologists, and probably used
by George Combe in his lectures.This mask has not the large nose of the
bust; but that is known to have been added afterwards.The bust is in
the New York Historical Society's rooms.In an article on Paine in the
_Atlantic Monthly_ (1856) it was stated that this bust had to be hidden
by the Historical Society to prevent its injury by haters of Paine.Robertson, of London, in his "Thomas Paine, an
Investigation."Kelby, of that Society, that the
statement is unfounded.The Society has not room to exhibit its entire
collection, and the bust of Paine was for some time out of sight, but
from no such reason as that stated, still less from any prejudice.The
face is that of Paine in extreme dilapidation, and would be a dismal
misrepresentation if shown in a public place.Before me are examples of all the portraits I have mentioned (except
that in Birmingham), and I have observed contemporary representations of
Paine in caricatures or in apotheosis of fly-leaves.Comparative studies
convince me that the truest portrait of Paine is that painted by John
Wesley Jarvis in 1803, and now in possession of Mr.J. H. Johnston, of
New York.The picture from which our frontispiece is taken appeared to
be a replica, of somewhat later date, the colors being fresher, but an
inscription on the back says "Charles W. Jarvis, pinxit, July, 1857."From this perfect duplicate Clark Mills made his portrait-bust of Paine
now in the National Museum at Washington, but it has not hitherto been
engraved.Alas, that no art can send out to the world what colors only
can convey,--the sensibility, the candor, the spirituality, transfusing
the strong features of Thomas Paine.As I have sat at my long task, now
drawn to a close, the face there on the wall has seemed to be alive, now
flushed with hope, now shadowed with care, the eyes greeting me daily,
the firm mouth assigning some password--Truth, Justice.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Life Of Thomas Paine, Vol.He said you had been taken into a drug store,
and wanted me to come right over.""It's a mean trick he played on you, mother," said Dan, indignantly."I
don't see what made him do it.""He must have meant it as a joke.""I don't mind it now, Dan, since I have you safe.He didn't know how much he was distressing me."You may forgive him if you want to; I
sha'n't."I feel a good deal happier than I did when I
was hurrying over here."I have sold my papers, and sha'n't work any
more this afternoon.I hope I can come across
him soon.""I left him at the door of our room.""Did you lock the door when you came away, mother?""There isn't much to take, Dan," said Mrs."We shall be in a pretty pickle if that is lost.""You don't think Mike would take it do you, Dan?""I think he would if he knew where to find it.""I wish I had brought it with me," said Mrs.Mordaunt, in a tone of
anxiety."Don't fret, mother; I guess it's all right.""Perhaps you had better go home at once without waiting for me, Dan."In my pocket-book, in the drawer of the work-table."Well, I'll be off, and will meet
you at the room."Dan was not long in reaching his humble home.The more he thought of it,
the more he distrusted Mike, and feared that he might have had a
sinister design in the deception he had practiced upon his mother.To
lose the rent money would be a serious matter.Grab hated him, he
knew full well, and would show no mercy, while in the short time
remaining it would be quite impossible to make up the necessary sum.Dan sprang up the stairs, several at a bound, and made his way at once
to the little work-table.He pulled the drawer open without ceremony,
and in feverish haste rummaged about until, to his great joy, he found
the pocket-book."It's all right, after all," he said."Mike isn't so bad as I thought
him."He opened the pocket-book, and his countenance fell.There was a
twenty-five cent scrip in one of the compartments, and that was all."He's stolen the money, after all," he said, his heart sinking."What
are we going to do now?""That is all that is left," answered Dan, holding up the scrip."Mike could not be wicked enough to take it."You don't know him as I do, mother.He's a mean
thief, and he sent you off to have a clear field."I couldn't think of that, or anything else, Dan, when I thought you
were hurt."Grab will be angry when he finds we can't pay
him.""I will try to find Mike; and if I do, I will get the money if I can.Dan went up stairs at once, and knocked at Mrs.She came to the door, her arms dripping with suds, for she had been
washing."And how is your mother to-day?"asked Dan, abruptly, too impatient to answer the question."No; he went out quarter of an hour ago.""Did he tell you where he was going, Mrs.He said he was going over to Brooklyn to see if he could
get a job, shure.I'm sorry to tell you that Mike has played a
bad trick on my mother.""Oh, whirra, whirra, what a bye he is!""He's
always up to something bad.Sorra bit of worruk he does, and I at the
wash-tub all day long.""He's a bad son to you, Mrs.And what kind of trick has
he played on your good mother?""He told her that I had been run over and broken my leg.Of course she
went out to find me, thinking it was all true, and while she was away he
took the money from her pocket-book."Some mothers would have questioned this statement, but Mrs.Rafferty
knew to her cost that Mike was capable of stealing, having been
implicated in thefts on several occasions.I don't know what to do wid him, shure.""It was the money we were to pay our rent with to-morrow," continued
Dan."I wish I could make it up to you, Dan, dear.Rafferty, but you ought not to make it
up.Do you think he has really gone to
Brooklyn.""He might have done it as a blind, just to put me on the wrong scent."Rafferty, I can't stop any longer.He went down stairs and told his mother what he had discovered or failed
to discover."Don't wait supper for me, mother," he said."I'm going in search of
Mike.""You won't fight with him, Dan?"I am not
going to submit to the loss without trying to get the money back, you
may be sure of that."So Dan went down stairs, considerably perplexed in mind.Mike was sure
to keep out of the way for a time at least, anticipating that Dan would
be upon his track.While our hero was searching for him, he would have
plenty of opportunities of spending the money of which he had obtained
unlawful possession.To punish him without regaining the contents of the
lost pocket-book would be an empty triumph.In the street below Dan
espied Terence Quinn, an acquaintance of Mike."I saw him only a few minutes ago.""I'll tell you where he'll be this evening.""He's going to the Old Bowery, and I'm goin' wid him.""He didn't tell me," said Terence.I'm sure of it now," said Dan to himself."I
wish I knew where to find him."CHAPTER X.

DAN AS A DETECTIVE.Dan quickly decided that if Mike had been going to Brooklyn, he would
not have announced it under the circumstances."He meant to send me there on a wild-goose chase," he reflected."I am
not quite so green as he takes me to be."Dan could not decide as easily where Mike had gone.Hood says in his
poem of "The Lost Heir,"


     "A boy as is lost in London streets is like a needle in a bundle
       of hay."A hunt for a boy in the streets of New York is about equally hopeless."I'll just stroll round a little," he said to himself.Dan bent his steps toward the Courtlandt-street Ferry."Perhaps Mike has gone to Jersey City," he said to himself."Anyway,
I'll go over there."Six cents would defray Dan's expenses
both ways, and he was willing to incur this expense.He meant to look
about him, as something might turn up by which he could turn an honest
penny.Near him in the cabin of the ferry-boat sat a gentleman of middle age,
who seemed overloaded with baggage.He had two heavy carpet-bags, a
satchel, and a bundle, at which he looked from time to time with a
nervous and uncomfortable glance.When the boat touched shore he tried
to gather his various pieces of luggage, but with indifferent success.Noticing his look of perplexity, Dan approached him, and said,
respectfully:

"Can't I assist you, sir?""I wish you would, my boy," said the gentleman, relieved.I'll take one of the carpet-bags and the satchel, if
you like.""Do you know the wharf of the Cunard steamers?""Not more than five or six minutes' walk," answered Dan."Can you help me as far as that with my luggage?""I will make it worth your while, and you will be doing me a great favor
besides.I was brought down to the ferry, but the rascally hackman
demanded five dollars more to carry me across and land me at the Cunard
pier.He thought I would have to submit to this imposition, but I was so
indignant that I tried to handle all my luggage myself.I don't know how
I should have managed without you.""I won't charge you so much, sir," said Dan, smiling."It isn't for the money I cared so much as for the imposition.I would
rather pay you ten dollars than the hackman five.""Be careful, sir," said Dan, smiling, "or I may take advantage of your
liberal offer.""You don't look like a boy that would take advantage of a traveler.""You can't judge from appearances, sir.I have been robbed of six
dollars to-day, and I might try to make it up that way.""Was it all the money your mother had?""How did you happen to be coming across the ferry?"By this time they were in sight of the Cunard wharf."Were you ever on a Cunard steamer?""Help me on board with my luggage, and I will show you about.""I thought the steamers generally left in the morning," said Dan."So they do; but to-day the tide did not serve till later."Stevens down below with his luggage, and assisted him in
storing them in his stateroom.He surveyed with interest the cabin, the
deck, the dining-saloon, and the various arrangements."Well," said the gentleman, smiling, "how do you like it?""Do you think you would like to be going with me?""Yes, sir, but for my mother.""Of course, it won't do to desert her; otherwise I might be tempted to
make you an offer.I am sure you would be very useful to me.""I should like it very much, if mother did not need me."Stevens, and remained till visitors were
warned that it was time to go ashore."I must go, sir," he said.Stevens drew a five-dollar bill from his vest pocket and handed it
to Dan."I haven't any change, sir," said Dan."None is required," said the gentleman, smiling."Do you really mean to give me five dollars, sir?""That is what the hackman wanted to charge me.""It was too much for him; it is not too much for you, if I am willing to
give it to you.""You are very kind, sir," said Dan, almost doubting the reality of his
good fortune."It will prove that I spoke truly when I said I didn't care for the
amount of money, only for the imposition.I am really very glad to give
it to you.Dan shook it heartily, and, wishing him a pleasant
voyage, descended the gangplank."That is almost as much as Mike robbed me of," he said to himself."How
lucky I came over to Jersey City!Now, if I could only get back part of
the money Mike robbed me of, I should be the better off for his mean
trick."He had been so fortunate
that he decided to spend the rest of the afternoon as he liked.He walked on for ten minutes, Mike being temporarily out of his mind,
when his attention was suddenly drawn to him.Just in front of him he
saw Mike himself swaggering along, with a ten-cent cigar in his mouth,
and both hands thrust deep in his trousers pockets.He was strolling
along in fancied security, not dreaming of the near presence of the boy
whom he had so meanly robbed.Dan's eyes sparkled when he recognized his enemy, and hastening his
pace, he put his hand on Mike's shoulder.Mike turned quickly, and his countenance changed when he saw Dan."Anyway, he
can't prove anything."What brings _you_ over here, Mike?""I'm looking for a job," said Mike."You look like it," retorted Dan, "with both hands in your pockets and
a cigar in your mouth!"I don't know," answered Mike, with unblushing falsehood."A man gave it
to me for holdin' his hoss."Mike was never at a loss for a plausible lie."Did they let you over the ferry free, then?""Oh, I had money enough for that.""Then how are you going to take Terence Quinn to the theater to-night?"Even Mike's brazen effrontery was hardly prepared to meet this
unexpected question."Terence told me you had invited him."said Mike, his self-assurance returning."Look here, Mike Rafferty," said Dan, out of patience; "that won't go
down!I know where you got the money you were
going to treat him with.""It's the truth, and if you don't hand over what's left without making
any more trouble, I'll have you arrested."We're in Jersey----"

"I shall have you arrested as soon as you get home.""I didn't take the money," said Mike, sullenly."You did, and you know it," said Dan, firmly."Give me what you have
left, and I'll make no trouble about it.If you don't, you're booked for
another term at the island."Mike tried to save his ill-gotten gains, but Dan was persistent, and
finally extracted from him four dollars and a half.The rest Mike
pretended he had spent.He was sly enough, however, to have saved enough
to take him to the Old Bowery.On the whole, Dan was satisfied, considering the five dollars he had
received on the Cunard steamer, but he could not forbear giving Mike a
farewell shot."How did it happen, Mike, that you took the Jersey Ferry to Brooklyn?""That is my first appearance as a detective," thought Dan.It was only five o'clock when Dan, returning from Jersey City, found
himself again in front of the Astor House.I've
made enough to satisfy me for one day."Dan stood at the corner of Vesey street, glancing at the hurrying
crowds.He rather enjoyed his temporary freedom from business cares.He had made a good day's work, the morrow's rent was provided for, and
he felt like a gentleman of leisure.All at once his attention was drawn to a low sob.It proceeded from a
little flower-girl of ten years, who usually stood near the hotel.asked Dan, calling her by her name, for the
little flower-girl was one of his acquaintances."Haven't you sold as
many bouquets as usual?""Yes," said Fanny, pausing in her sobs, "I've sold more.""No, but a young man passed a bad half-dollar on me."He did not need to ring it, for it was dull in
appearance and unmistakably bad.A young man came up and bought a five-cent bouquet, and gave
me this to change.""Didn't you see that it was bad?""I didn't look at it till afterward."So you gave him forty-five cents in good money, Fanny?""Yes," said the little girl, again beginning to sob."How many bouquets had you sold?""Then you have less money than when you began?""Do you think the fellow knew the piece was bad?""No, I saw him turn down Fulton street.""Give me the bad piece, and I'll go after him.Dan seized the money, and proceeded toward Fulton Ferry at a half run."I hope he won't have taken the boat," he said to himself."If he has I
shall lose him."Dan nearly overthrew an apple woman's stand not far from the ferry, but
did not stop to apologize.He ran into a fat gentleman who looked
daggers at him, but kept on.Breathless he paid his ferriage, and just succeeded in catching a boat
as it was leaving the New York pier.Thus far he had not seen the young man of whom he was in search.I'll go forward," said Dan to himself.He walked through the ladies' cabin, and stepped out on the forward
deck.The boat was crowded, for it was at the time when men who live in
Brooklyn, but are employed in New York, are returning to their homes.Dan looked about him for a time without success, but all at once his
eyes lighted up.Just across the deck, near the door of the gentlemen's
cabin, stood a young man with red hair, holding a small bouquet in his
hand.His face was freckled, his eyes small, and he looked capable of
meanness.Of course appearances are often deceptive, but not unfrequently a man's
character can be read upon his face."That's the fellow that cheated poor Fanny, I'll bet a hat," Dan decided
within himself.He immediately crossed to the other side of the deck.The red-headed young man was talking to another young man of about the
same age."Where did you get that bouquet, Sanderson?""Bought it of a little girl in front of the Astor House," answered
Sanderson."I suppose it is meant for some young lady," suggested the other."Maybe it is," answered Sanderson, with a grin.Dan thought it was about time to come to business.He touched the red-haired young man on the arm."You bought that bouquet of a girl near the Astor House," said Dan.asked Sanderson, uneasily, for he had a suspicion of
what was coming."You gave her a bogus half-dollar in payment," continued Dan."I am sorry I cannot accommodate you," said Dan, "but I want you to give
me a good piece for this first.""I never saw that half-dollar before," said Sanderson."Perhaps you can prove that before the court," said Dan."I mean that you have passed counterfeit money, and unless you give me a
good piece for it I will give you in charge as soon as we reach the
pier," said Dan, firmly.Sanderson looked about him, and saw that the boy's charge was believed."Fanny is a poor girl," he said."I found her crying over her loss, for
it was more than all the money she had taken to-day.""Yes, I am," said Dan, stoutly."This is a put-up job between you two," said Sanderson."Gentlemen," said Dan, turning and appealing to the passengers near him,
"this young man has passed a bad fifty-cent piece on a poor flower-girl.exclaimed half a dozen, and several cried "shame!"with
looks of scorn and disgust directed toward the young man with red hair."I don't believe a word of it," he ejaculated, in a rage."But I'll give you the money to get rid of you," and he threw a
half-dollar at Dan with a look very far from amiable."Thank you, sir; here's your money," said Dan.Though Sanderson had disclaimed all knowledge of the bogus half-dollar,
he took it and put it carefully in his pocket."Keep it to pay your washerwoman with," said a jeering voice.It was a young fellow in the garb of a workman who spoke.The boat touched the pier, and Sanderson was only too glad to hurry away
from the unfriendly crowd.cried a keen-looking businessman, addressing Dan."How did you discover that this fellow was the one that passed the
coin."He placed in Dan's hands a card bearing the firm's name


     BARTON & ROGERS,
     Commission Merchants,
               No.Dan was so pleased at having recovered Fanny's money that he gave
little thought to this last incident, though it was destined to exert an
important influence on his fortunes.He took the same boat back to New
York, and hurried to the Astor House.Little Fanny, the flower-girl, with a sad look upon her face, was still
standing in her wonted place."I've got your money back, Fanny," said Dan."Yes; I made the fellow give it up.""Oh, how kind you are, Dan!"There was a listener to what passed between the two children.A tall
lady, standing at the corner of the street, regarded them attentively.She was evidently revolving some plan in her head.As Dan was about
turning away, she placed her hand on his arm."Young man," she said, "I want to speak to you.""All right, ma'am," said Dan, surprised.Dan thought it probable that the lady who accosted him might wish to
send him on an errand, and his surprise vanished.She was tall, slender,
and grave in appearance."Are you an only child, or have you brothers and sisters?""There is only one of me," answered Dan, humorously."If I were not, I would not sell papers for a living.""Yes," answered Dan, beginning to be tired of satisfying what might be
only curiosity on the part of the lady.She noticed at once the change
in his manner."I am not making these inquiries out of curiosity," she said, quickly."I have an object in what I ask.""All right, ma'am," he said; "I am ready to answer.""Are you at leisure for an hour or two?""I suppose mother will be worried if I don't come home to supper," he
said, hesitating."Can't you send her a message not to expect you?Does this little girl
know where you live?""Little girl," she said, "go at once and tell this boy's mother that he
will not be home till nine o'clock.The little girl's eyes sparkled with joy as the lady placed fifty cents
in her hand.As for Dan, he was puzzled to conjecture what the lady could want of
him.What would justify such a handsome compensation to Fanny merely to
explain his absence to his mother?"Now," said the lady, "if you will hail the next stage we will go up
town."Soon they were rattling over the pavements
through thronged Broadway.It was two years since Dan had been in a
Broadway stage.He could not afford to pay ten cents for a ride, but
when it was absolutely necessary rode in a horse-car for half price.Dan looked about him to see if he knew any one in the stage.Nearly
opposite sat his former schoolmate, Tom Carver, with a young lady at his
side.Their glances met, and Dan saw Tom's lip curl with scorn.Of
course he did not betray any mark of recognition."I like riding in a Broadway stage," he heard the young lady say."There
is more to see as you go along."Not always," said Tom, with a significant glance at Dan.Dan felt indignant, but was too proud to show it."The price excludes the lower classes from using the stage," said the
young lady."It ought to, but I have seen a newsboy in a stage.""How can they afford to pay ten cents for riding?""I give it up," said Tom, shrugging his shoulders.The lady who was with Dan noticed the direction of Tom Carver's look."Yes," answered Dan, "I used to know him.""I don't," said Dan, promptly, returning Tom Carver's stare.Tom could not help hearing this conversation, and learned for the first
time that Dan and the handsomely dressed lady beside him were in
company."What can they have to do with each other?""She can't be a relation--she is too handsomely dressed."At this moment the young lady beside him dropped her handkerchief.Before Tom could stoop to pick it up Dan had handed it to her with a
polite bow."Thank you," said the young lady, with a pleasant smile."You needn't have troubled yourself," said Tom Carver, irritated."This
young lady is under _my_ charge.""It is no trouble, I assure you," answered Dan."He is very polite," said the young lady, in a low voice, "and very
good-looking, too," she added, with a second look at Dan."He is only a common newsboy," said Tom, not relishing Julia Grey's
tribute to a boy he disliked."I can't help what he is," said the young lady, independently; "he looks
like a gentleman."Dan could not help catching the drift of their conversation, and his
face flushed with pleasure, for Julia was a very pretty girl, but not
being addressed to him, he could not take notice of it otherwise."He lives at the Five Points somewhere," muttered Tom.The young lady seemed rather amused at Tom's discomposure, and only
smiled in reply.The stage kept on till it reached Madison square."Will you pull the strap opposite the Fifth Avenue Hotel?"He got out first, and helped his companion out."Follow me into the hotel," she said.asked the lady, as they ascended the stairs."I needn't ask if you have a good mother?""One of the best," said Dan, promptly."You look like a well-bred boy, and I infer that your mother is a lady.Dan followed her, wondering, and she signed to him to take a seat on the
sofa beside her."You have already told me that you have no sister," she began."Do you think your mother would enjoy the society of a little girl?""I have a little girl under my charge--my niece--from whom, for reasons
unnecessary to state, I am obliged to part for a time.Do you think your
mother would be willing to take charge of her?Of course I would make it
worth her while.""I am sure she would like it," said Dan, for he saw at a glance that
this would be a very desirable arrangement for them."Then you feel authorized to accept the charge in your mother's name?"Your mother would be willing to
teach her until such time as she may be old enough to go to school?""I think little girls are best off at home until the age of seven or
eight.""We live in a poor room and a poor neighborhood."I shall pay you enough to enable you to
take better rooms.""I may as well be explicit," said the lady."I propose to pay fifty
dollars a month for my ward's board, including, of course, your mothers
care.""I am afraid it won't be worth it," said Dan, frankly."If Althea is well cared for, as I am sure she will be, I shall have no
fear of that.Let me add that I shall allow your mother ten dollars per
month extra for the child's clothing--say sixty dollars in all.For the
present that will probably be enough.""Oh, yes, I should think so," said Dan."When do you want her to come to
us?"I must leave New York early to-morrow.In fact, I leave
the city by an early train.""She would have to come to our poor lodgings," said Dan, hesitatingly.To-morrow you can secure rooms up town.""Yes, ma'am, I will."Now," said the lady, rising, "since the matter is settled, come up
stairs with me, and I will show you the child."Dan followed the lady up stairs, feeling as if he were in a dream, but a
very pleasant one.As the lady entered the room a little girl, with an expression of joy,
ran from the window from which she had been looking, and took her hand."I'm so glad you've got home, auntie," she said."I staid away longer than I intended, Althea," said the lady."I was
afraid you would feel lonely."I wanted to go out into the hall and play with a
little girl that lives in the next room, but I thought you wouldn't find
me."I have brought you a playfellow, Althea."This drew the little girl's attention to Dan.Unlike most girls of her
age, she was not bashful.Are you going to live with us, Dan?""You are coming to live with me," said Dan, smiling.You are nice-looking," said Althea, in a
matter-of-fact tone.He found the compliment agreeable, though it came from a
little girl."So are you, Althea," he said."I don't think I am," said Althea."I've black hair, and my skin is
dark.You have nice brown hair, and are whiter than I am.""Some like dark people best," suggested Dan.I asked auntie to buy me a big cake of soap to wash the brown
off, but it wouldn't come."He thought the bright, vivacious little face, with the
brilliant dark eyes, pretty, though Althea did not."You will like to live with Dan, my dear?""I have got to go away--on business.""I don't want you to go away, auntie," she said."Dan and I can't live
alone.""Dan has a mother, who will be very good to you."asked Althea, brightening up."And you will come to see me some time, auntie?""Then I will go with Dan;" and the little girl placed her hand
confidingly in that of our hero.Dan thought it would be pleasant for him to have a little sister, and he
knew that it would brighten his mother's existence."Shall we go now, madam?"She drew from her pocket a wallet
containing a considerable sum of money."I will hand you two months' payment in advance," she said, "and
afterward I will remit you monthly, or direct you where to call for
money.Two months at fifty dollars will amount to one hundred, and
twenty more for Althea's dress will make it up to a hundred and twenty."Whenever I have any to be careful about," answered Dan."I hope you will be comfortably provided from this time.There is a
little trunk of Althea's clothes in the trunk-room below.I will write
you an order for it, but you may as well wait till you have moved before
carrying it away."Then you shall go into supper with Althea and myself.""I'm afraid I don't look fit."At any rate, it's nobody's business.There was nothing to say, so Dan followed the mysterious lady into the
supper-room, Althea clinging to his hand.He felt awkward as he took his
seat.Suppose some one should recognize him as the newsboy who usually
stood in front of the Astor House!The young lady whom Tom Carver was escorting boarded at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel, and had alighted at the same time with our hero, though he did
not observe it.Tom had been invited to supper, and, with Julia and her father, was
seated at a neighboring table when Dan entered.Tom could hardly credit his eyes when he saw Dan entering the
supper-room, with the little girl clinging to his hand.he ejaculated, forgetting his manners in his
surprise."I beg your pardon, but I was so astonished.There is that newsboy
coming into supper!""What a pretty little girl is with him!""You must be mistaken about your friend being a newsboy.""Your acquaintance, then; though he is nice enough looking to be a
friend.I saw him selling papers yesterday in front of the Astor
House.""His business must be good, or he would not board at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel.""Of that boy at the next table, pa."Why, that's my young friend of the ferry-boat.Tom, have the
kindness to ask him to come here a moment and speak to me."Much surprised, and considerably against his will, Tom rose and walked
over to where Dan was sitting."Look here," said he; "come over to the next table, will you?""There's a gentleman wants to speak to you."Rogers, of the firm of Barton &
Rogers, who had asked him to call at his place of business on Pearl
street."Not as a rule," answered Dan, smiling."Then, Dan, let me make you acquainted with my daughter, Julia.""I think you were sitting opposite me in the stage, Mr."You were polite enough to hand me my handkerchief when I awkwardly
dropped it.""Dan, this young gentleman is Thomas Carver.Carver a long time," said Dan, smiling."You didn't tell me that, Tom," said Julia Rogers, turning to Tom."No," said Tom, embarrassed; "it is a good while ago.""I won't detain you any longer from your friends," said Mr."I shall see you at the office in the morning.""Where did you meet him, papa?"Her father told the story of Dan's exploit on the ferry-boat."He is a very smart boy," he said."I shall probably take him into my
employ."All this was very disagreeable to Tom Carver, but he did not venture to
say all that he felt, being somewhat in awe of Mr."They are making a great fuss over a common newsboy," he muttered to
himself.After supper, Dan prepared to take Althea home with him.She felt so
well acquainted already that she made no objection, but, hand-in-hand,
left the hotel with Dan.He halted a Broadway stage, and they got in."Are you carrying me to where you live, Dan?""Will your mother be glad to see me?"She wants a little girl to keep her
company."Mordaunt was apprised by Fanny that Dan had gone up town with a
lady, and therefore was not alarmed when he did not return home at the
usual time.She hoped he would clear fifty cents, but had no idea to
what extent their fortunes would be advanced by Dan's evening's work."I will save Dan some supper," she said to herself.So, mother-like, she supped economically herself, on a cup of tea and
some dry bread, and bought a bit of steak for Dan's supper, for she
thought he would be very hungry at so late an hour.It was nearly half-past eight when she heard Dan's well known step on
the stairs.She opened the door to welcome him, but the cheerful welcome upon her
lips died away in surprise when she saw his companion."She is going to be my little sister, mother," said Dan, gayly.said Althea, releasing Dan's hand, and putting
her own confidingly in that of Mrs."Yes, my dear," said the widow, her heart quite won by the little girl's
innocent confidence, and she bent over and kissed her."It means that Althea is to board with us, and be company for you.I
have agreed with her aunt that you will take her.""But does her aunt know that we live in such a poor place?"asked his
mother in a tone of hesitation."Yes, mother, but that makes no difference, as we shall move up town
to-morrow.""I am sure you have acted for the best, Dan, but it seems so strange.""Will it seem strange to receive fifty dollars a month for Althea's
board?"I didn't suppose we ought to charge more."Are you a great eater,
Althea?""Sometimes I am," said the little girl, naively."Never mind, I guess there will be enough."I didn't know there
would be two, but I will go cut and buy some more meat, if you can
wait.""I have had supper, mother, or dinner rather.I dined with Althea and
her aunt at the Fifth Avenue Hotel.""Has Althea been stopping there, Dan?""Then how can she stay even one night in this poor place?"Althea, do you mind stopping here just one night?We
will go to a better place to-morrow.""No, Dan, I don't care.""There, mother, I told you so, Althea is a brick.""What a funny boy you are, Dan!A brick is red and
ugly, and I am not.""No, Althea, you are not ugly, but your cheeks are red.""They don't look like a brick, Dan.""I had got your supper all ready, Dan," said his mother, regretfully."You didn't have any meat, I'll warrant.Now, like a good mother, sit
down and eat the steak."Assured that Dan had supped well, Mrs.Mordaunt didn't resist his
advice.Dan looked on, and saw with pleasure that his mother relished the meat."We will be able to live better hereafter, mother," he said."There
won't be any stinting.Fifty dollars will go a good ways, and then,
besides, there will be my earnings.I forgot to tell you, mother, that I
have probably got a place.""Our good fortune is coming all at once, Dan," said Mrs.I think it has come to stay, too.""I feel so tired," said Althea, at this point.In twenty minutes the little girl was in a sound sleep.Dan was not
sorry, for he wanted to tell his mother about the days adventures, and
he could do so more freely without any one to listen."So, mother," he concluded, "we are going to turn over a new leaf.We
can't go back to our old style of living just yet, but we can get out of
this tenement-house, and live in a respectable neighborhood.""God has been good to us, Dan."I know it, mother, but somehow I don't think of that as quick as you.Who do you think I saw in the supper-room at the Fifth Avenue?He was wonderfully puzzled to know how I happened to be
there.He told the party he was with that I was a common newsboy.""He is a very mean boy," said Mrs."After being
so intimate with you too."He can't do me any harm, and I don't care for his
friendship.The time may come when I can meet him on even terms."I shall work along, and if I get rich I
sha'n't be the first rich man that has risen from the ranks."Early the next morning Dan started out in search of a new home.He and his mother decided that they would like to live somewhere near
Union Square, as that would be a pleasant afternoon resort for their
young boarder."No, Dan, I have not time this morning."Very well, mother; I will do my best."Dan crossed Broadway, and took a horse-car up town.In West Sixteenth street his attention was drawn to the notice,
"Furnished Rooms to Let," upon a good-looking brick house.He rang the bell, and asked to see the lady of the house.A stout, matronly looking woman, with a pleasant face, answered the
servant's call."I called to inquire for rooms," said Dan."For my mother, and sister, and myself.""I have a large back room on the third floor, and a small room on the
fourth floor."It was neatly carpeted and furnished, and had a cheerful outlook."This will do for mother and Althea
