She changed colour as he addressed her,
but seemed instantly by an effort to rally and regain her equanimity;
replied to his inquiries with extreme brevity, and Lady Wallinger's
carriage being announced, moved away with the same slight haughty salute
as before, on the arm of Lord Beaumanoir.Sadness fell over the once happy family of Millbank after the departure
of Coningsby from Hellingsley.When the first pang was over, Edith
had found some solace in the sympathy of her aunt, who had always
appreciated and admired Coningsby; but it was a sympathy which aspired
only to soften sorrow, and not to create hope.But Lady Wallinger,
though she lengthened her visit for the sake of her niece, in time
quitted them; and then the name of Coningsby was never heard by Edith.Her brother, shortly after the sorrowful and abrupt departure of his
friend, had gone to the factories, where he remained, and of which, in
future, it was intended that he should assume the principal direction.Millbank himself, sustained at first by the society of his friend
Sir Joseph, to whom he was attached, and occupied with daily reports
from his establishment and the transaction of the affairs with his
numerous and busy constituents, was for a while scarcely conscious of
the alteration which had taken place in the demeanour of his daughter.But when they were once more alone together, it was impossible any
longer to be blind to the great change.That happy and equable gaiety of
spirit, which seemed to spring from an innocent enjoyment of existence,
and which had ever distinguished Edith, was wanting.She was not indeed always moody and dispirited, but she was
fitful, unequal in her tone.That temper whose sweetness had been a
domestic proverb had become a little uncertain.Not that her affection
for her father was diminished, but there were snatches of unusual
irritability which momentarily escaped her, followed by bursts of
tenderness that were the creatures of compunction.And often, after some
hasty word, she would throw her arms round her father's neck with the
fondness of remorse.She pursued her usual avocations, for she had
really too well-regulated a mind, she was in truth a person of
too strong an intellect, to neglect any source of occupation and
distraction.Her flowers, her pencil, and her books supplied her with
these; and music soothed, and at times beguiled, her agitated thoughts.But there was no joy in the house, and in time Mr.Millbank was vexed, irritated, grieved.Edith, his Edith, the pride
and delight of his existence, who had been to him only a source of
exultation and felicity, was no longer happy, was perhaps pining away;
and there was the appearance, the unjust appearance that he, her fond
father, was the cause and occasion of all this wretchedness.It would
appear that the name of Coningsby, to which he now owed a great debt of
gratitude, was still doomed to bear him mortification and misery.Truly
had the young man said that there was a curse upon their two families.And yet, on reflection, it still seemed to Mr.Millbank that he had
acted with as much wisdom and real kindness as decision.The union was impossible; the speedier their
separation, therefore, clearly the better.Unfortunate, indeed, had been
his absence from Hellingsley; unquestionably his presence might have
prevented the catastrophe.Millbank could not shut his eyes to the devotion of his son to
Coningsby.He felt he could count on no assistance in this respect from
that quarter.Yet how hard upon him that he should seem to figure as
a despot or a tyrant to his own children, whom he loved, when he had
absolutely acted in an inevitable manner!Edith seemed sad, Oswald
sullen; all was changed.All the objects for which this clear-headed,
strong-minded, kind-hearted man had been working all his life, seemed
to be frustrated.Because a young man had made love to his
daughter, who was really in no manner entitled to do so.Millbank found Hellingsley, under existing
circumstances, extremely wearisome; and he proposed to his daughter that
they should pay a visit to their earlier home.Edith assented without
difficulty, but without interest.Millbank immediately
perceived, the change was a judicious one; for certainly the spirits
of Edith seemed to improve after her return to their valley.There were
more objects of interest: change, too, is always beneficial.Millbank had been aware that Oswald had received a letter from
Coningsby, written before he quitted Spain, perhaps he might have
recognised a more satisfactory reason for the transient liveliness of
his daughter which had so greatly gratified him.About a month after Christmas, the meeting of Parliament summoned Mr.Millbank up to London; and he had wished Edith to accompany him.But
London in February to Edith, without friends or connections, her father
always occupied and absent from her day and night, seemed to them
all, on reflection, to be a life not very conducive to health or
cheerfulness, and therefore she remained with her brother.Oswald had
heard from Coningsby again from Rome; but at the period he wrote he did
not anticipate his return to England.His tone was affectionate, but
dispirited.Lady Wallinger went up to London after Easter for the season, and Mr.Millbank, now that there was a constant companion for his daughter, took
a house and carried Edith back with him to London.Lady Wallinger,
who had great wealth and great tact, had obtained by degrees a
not inconsiderable position in society.She had a fine house in a
fashionable situation, and gave profuse entertainments.The Whigs
were under obligations to her husband, and the great Whig ladies were
gratified to find in his wife a polished and pleasing person, to whom
they could be courteous without any annoyance.So that Edith, under the
auspices of her aunt, found herself at once in circles which otherwise
she might not easily have entered, but which her beauty, grace, and
experience of the most refined society of the Continent, qualified
her to shine in.One evening they met the Marquis of Beaumanoir, their
friend of Rome and Paris, and admirer of Edith, who from that time was
seldom from their side.His mother, the Duchess, immediately called both
on the Millbanks and the Wallingers; glad, not only to please her son,
but to express that consideration for Mr.Millbank which the Duke always
wished to show.It was, however, of no use; nothing would induce Mr.Millbank ever to enter what he called aristocratic society.He liked the
House of Commons; never paired off; never missed a moment of it; worked
at committees all the morning, listened attentively to debates all the
night; always dined at Bellamy's when there was a house; and when there
was not, liked dining at the Fishmongers' Company, the Russia Company,
great Emigration banquets, and other joint-stock festivities.That was
his idea of rational society; business and pleasure combined; a good
dinner, and good speeches afterwards.Edith was aware that Coningsby had returned to England, for her brother
had heard from him on his arrival; but Oswald had not heard since.A season in London only represented in the mind of Edith the chance,
perhaps the certainty, of meeting Coningsby again; of communing together
over the catastrophe of last summer; of soothing and solacing each
other's unhappiness, and perhaps, with the sanguine imagination of
youth, foreseeing a more felicitous future.She had been nearly a
fortnight in town, and though moving frequently in the same circles as
Coningsby, they had not yet met.It was one of those results which
could rarely occur; but even chance enters too frequently in the
league against lovers.The invitation to the assembly at ---- House was
therefore peculiarly gratifying to Edith, since she could scarcely
doubt that if Coningsby were in town, which her casual inquiries of Lord
Beaumanoir induced her to believe was the case, he would be present.Never, therefore, had she repaired to an assembly with such a flattering
spirit; and yet there was a fascinating anxiety about it that bewilders
the young heart.In vain Edith surveyed the rooms to catch the form of that being, whom
for a moment she had never ceased to cherish and muse over.He was not
there; and at the very moment when, disappointed and mortified, she most
required solace, she learned from Mr.Melton that Lady Theresa Sydney,
whom she chanced to admire, was going to be married, and to Mr.His silence, perhaps his shunning of her were no
longer inexplicable.What a return for all her romantic devotion in her
sad solitude at Hellingsley.Was this the end of their twilight rambles,
and the sweet pathos of their mutual loves?There seemed to be no truth
in man, no joy in life!All the feelings that she had so generously
lavished, all returned upon herself.She could have burst into a passion
of tears and buried herself in a cloister.Instead of that, civilisation made her listen with a serene though
tortured countenance; but as soon as it was in her power, pleading a
headache to Lady Wallinger, she effected, or thought she had effected,
her escape from a scene which harrowed her heart.As for Coningsby, he passed a sleepless night, agitated by the
unexpected presence of Edith and distracted by the manner in which
she had received him.To say that her appearance had revived all his
passionate affection for her would convey an unjust impression of the
nature of his feelings.His affection had never for a moment swerved; it
was profound and firm.But unquestionably this sudden vision had brought
before him, in startling and more vivid colours, the relations that
subsisted between them.There was the being whom he loved and who loved
him; and whatever were the barriers which the circumstances of life
placed against their union, they were partakers of the solemn sacrament
of an unpolluted heart.Coningsby, as we have mentioned, had signified to Oswald his return to
England: he had hitherto omitted to write again; not because his spirit
faltered, but he was wearied of whispering hope without foundation, and
mourning over his chagrined fortunes.Once more in England, once more
placed in communication with his grandfather, he felt with increased
conviction the difficulties which surrounded him.The society of Lady
Everingham and her sister, who had been at the same time her visitor,
had been a relaxation, and a beneficial one, to a mind suffering
too much from the tension of one idea.But Coningsby had treated the
matrimonial project of his gay-minded hostess with the courteous levity
in which he believed it had first half originated.He admired and liked
Lady Theresa; but there was a reason why he should not marry her, even
had his own heart not been absorbed by one of those passions from which
men of deep and earnest character never emancipate themselves.After musing and meditating again and again over everything that had
occurred, Coningsby fell asleep when the morning had far advanced,
resolved to rise when a little refreshed and find out Lady Wallinger,
who, he felt sure, would receive him with kindness.Yet it was fated that this step should not be taken, for while he was
at breakfast, his servant brought him a letter from Monmouth House,
apprising him that his grandfather wished to see him as soon as possible
on urgent business.Lord Monmouth was sitting in the same dressing-room in which he was
first introduced to the reader; on the table were several packets of
papers that were open and in course of reference; and he dictated his
observations to Monsieur Villebecque, who was writing at his left hand.Thus were they occupied when Coningsby was ushered into the room.'You see, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, 'that I am much occupied to-day,
yet the business on which I wish to communicate with you is so pressing
that it could not be postponed.'He made a sign to Villebecque, and his
secretary instantly retired.'I was right in pressing your return to England,' continued Lord
Monmouth to his grandson, who was a little anxious as to the impending
communication, which he could not in any way anticipate.'These are not
times when young men should be out of sight.You may be astonished, but
it is a fact.They are going to dissolve their own House of Commons.Notwithstanding this and the Queen's name, we can beat them; but the
race requires the finest jockeying.Tadpole has
been here to me about Darlford; he came specially with a message, I may
say an appeal, from one to whom I can refuse nothing; the Government
count on the seat, though with the new Registration 'tis nearly a tie.If we had a good candidate we could win.He is too
much of the old clique; used up; a hack; besides, a beaten horse.We are
assured the name of Coningsby would be a host; there is a considerable
section who support the present fellow who will not vote against a
Coningsby.They have thought of you as a fit person, and I have approved
of the suggestion.You will, therefore, be the candidate for Darlford
with my entire sanction and support, and I have no doubt you will be
successful.You may be sure I shall spare nothing: and it will be very
gratifying to me, after being robbed of all our boroughs, that the only
Coningsby who cares to enter Parliament, should nevertheless be able to
do so as early as I could fairly desire.'Millbank on the hustings of Darlford!The fierce passions,
the gross insults, the hot blood and the cool lies, the ruffianism and
the ribaldry, perhaps the domestic discomfiture and mortification, which
he was about to be the means of bringing on the roof he loved best
in the world, occurred to him with anguish.The countenance of
Edith, haughty and mournful last night, rose to him again.He saw her
canvassing for her father, and against him.And for what was
he to make this terrible and costly sacrifice For his ambition?Not even
for that Divinity or Daemon for which we all immolate so much!Mighty
ambition, forsooth, to succeed to the Rigbys!To enter the House of
Commons a slave and a tool; to move according to instructions, and
to labour for the low designs of petty spirits, without even the
consolation of being a dupe.What sympathy could there exist between
Coningsby and the 'great Conservative party,' that for ten years in
an age of revolution had never promulgated a principle; whose only
intelligible and consistent policy seemed to be an attempt, very
grateful of course to the feelings of an English Royalist, to revive
Irish Puritanism; who when in power in 1835 had used that power only to
evince their utter ignorance of Church principles; and who were at this
moment, when Coningsby was formally solicited to join their ranks, in
open insurrection against the prerogatives of the English Monarchy?'Do you anticipate then an immediate dissolution, sir?'inquired
Coningsby after a moment's pause.'We must anticipate it; though I think it doubtful.It may be next
month; it may be in the autumn; they may tide over another year, as Lord
Eskdale thinks, and his opinion always weighs with me.Tadpole believes they will dissolve at once.But whether they dissolve
now, or in a month's time, or in the autumn, or next year, our course
is clear.Monday next, there is a great Conservative dinner at Darlford.You
must attend it; that will be the finest opportunity in the world for you
to announce yourself.''Don't you think, sir,' said Coningsby, 'that such an announcement would
be rather premature?It is, in fact, embarking in a contest which may
last a year; perhaps more.''What you say is very true,' said Lord Monmouth; 'no doubt it is very
troublesome; very disgusting; any canvassing is.But we must take things
as we find them.You cannot get into Parliament now in the good old
gentlemanlike way; and we ought to be thankful that this interest has
been fostered for our purpose.'Coningsby looked on the carpet, cleared his throat as if about to speak,
and then gave something like a sigh.'I think you had better be off the day after to-morrow,' said Lord
Monmouth.'I have sent instructions to the steward to do all he can in
so short a time, for I wish you to entertain the principal people.''You are most kind, you are always most kind to me, dear sir,' said
Coningsby, in a hesitating tone, and with an air of great embarrassment,
'but, in truth, I have no wish to enter Parliament.''I feel that I am not sufficiently prepared for so great a
responsibility as a seat in the House of Commons,' said Coningsby.How can any one have a more agreeable seat?The only person to
whom you are responsible is your own relation, who brings you in.And I
don't suppose there can be any difference on any point between us.You
are certainly still young; but I was younger by nearly two years when
I first went in; and I found no difficulty.All you have got to do is to vote with your party.As for speaking, if
you have a talent that way, take my advice; don't be in a hurry.Learn
to know the House; learn the House to know you.If a man be discreet, he
cannot enter Parliament too soon.''It is not exactly that, sir,' said Coningsby.'Then what is it, my dear Harry?You see to-day I have much to do; yet
as your business is pressing, I would not postpone seeing you an hour.I
thought you would have been very much gratified.''You mentioned that I had nothing to do but to vote with my party, sir,'
replied Coningsby.'You mean, of course, by that term what is understood
by the Conservative party.''I am sorry,' said Coningsby, rather pale, but speaking with firmness,
'I am sorry that I could not support the Conservative party.'exclaimed Lord Monmouth, starting in his seat,'some woman
has got hold of him, and made him a Whig!''No, my dear grandfather,' said Coningsby, scarcely able to repress a
smile, serious as the interview was becoming, 'nothing of the kind, I
assure you.No person can be more anti-Whig.''I don't know what you are driving at, sir,' said Lord Monmouth, in a
hard, dry tone.'I wish to be frank, sir,' said Coningsby, 'and am very sensible of your
goodness in permitting me to speak to you on the subject.What I mean to
say is, that I have for a long time looked upon the Conservative party
as a body who have betrayed their trust; more from ignorance, I admit,
than from design; yet clearly a body of individuals totally unequal
to the exigencies of the epoch, and indeed unconscious of its real
character.''Well, between ourselves, I am quite of the same opinion.But we must
mount higher; we must go to '28 for the real mischief.But what is the
use of lamenting the past?Peel is the only man; suited to the times and
all that; at least we must say so, and try to believe so; we can't go
back.And it is our own fault that we have let the chief power out of
the hands of our own order.It was never thought of in the time of your
great-grandfather, sir.And if a commoner were for a season permitted
to be the nominal Premier to do the detail, there was always a secret
committee of great 1688 nobles to give him his instructions.''I should be very sorry to see secret committees of great 1688 nobles
again,' said Coningsby.'Then what the devil do you want to see?''Political faith,' said Coningsby, 'instead of political infidelity.''Before I support Conservative principles,' continued Coningsby, 'I
merely wish to be informed what those principles aim to conserve.It
would not appear to be the prerogative of the Crown, since the principal
portion of a Conservative oration now is an invective against a late
royal act which they describe as a Bed-chamber plot.Is it the Church
which they wish to conserve?What is a threatened Appropriation Clause
against an actual Church Commission in the hands of Parliamentary
Laymen?Well, then, if it
is neither the Crown nor the Church, whose rights and privileges this
Conservative party propose to vindicate, is it your House, the House
of Lords, whose powers they are prepared to uphold?Is it not notorious
that the very man whom you have elected as your leader in that House,
declares among his Conservative adherents, that henceforth the assembly
that used to furnish those very Committees of great revolution nobles
that you mention, is to initiate nothing; and, without a struggle, is
to subside into that undisturbed repose which resembles the Imperial
tranquillity that secured the frontiers by paying tribute?''All this is vastly fine,' said Lord Monmouth; 'but I see no means by
which I can attain my object but by supporting Peel.After all, what is
the end of all parties and all politics?I want to
turn our coronet into a ducal one, and to get your grandmother's barony
called out of abeyance in your favour.It is impossible that Peel can
refuse me.I have already purchased an ample estate with the view
of entailing it on you and your issue.You will make a considerable
alliance; you may marry, if you please, Lady Theresa Sydney.Count on my at once entering into any arrangement
conducive to your happiness.''My dear grandfather, you have ever been to me only too kind and
generous.''To whom should I be kind but to you, my own blood, that has never
crossed me, and of whom I have reason to be proud?Yes, Harry, it
gratifies me to hear you admired and to learn your success.All I want
now is to see you in Parliament.There is a sort of stiffness about every man, no matter what may be his
talents, who enters Parliament late in life; and now, fortunately, the
occasion offers.You will go down on Friday; feed the notabilities
well; speak out; praise Peel; abuse O'Connell and the ladies of the
Bed-chamber; anathematise all waverers; say a good deal about Ireland;
stick to the Irish Registration Bill, that's a good card; and, above
all, my dear Harry, don't spare that fellow Millbank.Remember, in
turning him out you not only gain a vote for the Conservative cause
and our coronet, but you crush my foe.Spare nothing for that object; I
count on you, boy.''I should grieve to be backward in anything that concerned your
interest or your honour, sir,' said Coningsby, with an air of great
embarrassment.'I am sure you would, I am sure you would,' said Lord Monmouth, in a
tone of some kindness.'And I feel at this moment,' continued Coningsby, 'that there is no
personal sacrifice which I am not prepared to make for them, except one.My interests, my affections, they should not be placed in the balance,
if yours, sir, were at stake, though there are circumstances which might
involve me in a position of as much mental distress as a man could well
endure; but I claim for my convictions, my dear grandfather, a generous
tolerance.''I can't follow you, sir,' said Lord Monmouth, again in his hard tone.'Our interests are inseparable, and therefore there can never be
any sacrifice of conduct on your part.What you mean by sacrifice of
affections, I don't comprehend; but as for your opinions, you have no
business to have any other than those I uphold.'I am sure I wish to express them with no unbecoming confidence,'
replied Coningsby; 'I have never intruded them on your ear before;
but this being an occasion when you yourself said, sir, I was about
to commence my public career, I confess I thought it was my duty to be
frank; I would not entail on myself long years of mortification by one
of those ill-considered entrances into political life which so many
public men have cause to deplore.''You go with your family, sir, like a gentleman; you are not to consider
your opinions, like a philosopher or a political adventurer.''Yes, sir,' said Coningsby, with animation, 'but men going with their
families like gentlemen, and losing sight of every principle on which
the society of this country ought to be established, produced the Reform
Bill.'said Lord Monmouth; 'if the Duke had not
quarrelled with Lord Grey on a Coal Committee, we should never have had
the Reform Bill.'You are in as great peril now as you were in 1830,' said Coningsby.'No, no, no,' said Lord Monmouth; 'the Tory party is organised now; they
will not catch us napping again: these Conservative Associations have
done the business.''At the best to turn
out the Whigs.And when you have turned out the Whigs, what then?You
may get your ducal coronet, sir.But a duke now is not so great a man
as a baron was but a century back.We cannot struggle against the
irresistible stream of circumstances.Power has left our order; this is
not an age for factitious aristocracy.As for my grandmother's barony, I
should look upon the termination of its abeyance in my favour as the
act of my political extinction.What we want, sir, is not to fashion
new dukes and furbish up old baronies, but to establish great principles
which may maintain the realm and secure the happiness of the people.Let
me see authority once more honoured; a solemn reverence again the habit
of our lives; let me see property acknowledging, as in the old days
of faith, that labour is his twin brother, and that the essence of all
tenure is the performance of duty; let results such as these be brought
about, and let me participate, however feebly, in the great fulfilment,
and public life then indeed becomes a noble career, and a seat in
Parliament an enviable distinction.''I tell you what it is, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, very drily,'members
of this family may think as they like, but they must act as I please.You must go down on Friday to Darlford and declare yourself a candidate
for the town, or I shall reconsider our mutual positions.I would say,
you must go to-morrow; but it is only courteous to Rigby to give him a
previous intimation of your movement.I
sent for Rigby this morning on other business which now occupies me, and
find he is out of town.He will return to-morrow; and will be here at
three o'clock, when you can meet him.You will meet him, I doubt not,
like a man of sense,' added Lord Monmouth, looking at Coningsby with a
glance such as he had never before encountered, 'who is not prepared to
sacrifice all the objects of life for the pursuit of some fantastical
puerilities.'His Lordship rang a bell on his table for Villebecque; and to prevent
any further conversation, resumed his papers.It would have been difficult for any person, unconscious of crime,
to have felt more dejected than Coningsby when he rode out of the
court-yard of Monmouth House.The love of Edith would have consoled
him for the destruction of his prosperity; the proud fulfilment of his
ambition might in time have proved some compensation for his crushed
affections; but his present position seemed to offer no single source
of solace.There came over him that irresistible conviction that is at
times the dark doom of all of us, that the bright period of our life is
past; that a future awaits us only of anxiety, failure, mortification,
despair; that none of our resplendent visions can ever be realised:
and that we add but one more victim to the long and dreary catalogue of
baffled aspirations.Nor could he indeed by any combination see the means to extricate
himself from the perils that were encompassing him.There was something
about his grandfather that defied persuasion.Prone as eloquent
youth generally is to believe in the resistless power of its appeals,
Coningsby despaired at once of ever moving Lord Monmouth.There had been
a callous dryness in his manner, an unswerving purpose in his spirit,
that at once baffled all attempts at influence.Nor could Coningsby
forget the look he received when he quitted the room.There was no
possibility of mistaking it; it said at once, without periphrasis,
'Cross my purpose, and I will crush you!'This was the moment when the sympathy, if not the counsels, of
friendship might have been grateful.A clever woman might have afforded
even more than sympathy; some happy device that might have even released
him from the mesh in which he was involved.And once Coningsby had
turned his horse's head to Park Lane to call on Lady Everingham.But
surely if there were a sacred secret in the world, it was the one which
subsisted between himself and Edith.Then there was Lady Wallinger; he could at least speak with freedom to
her.He looked in for a moment at a club
to take up the 'Court Guide' and find her direction.A few men were
standing in a bow window.Cassilis say,

'So Beau, they say, is booked at last; the new beauty, have you heard?''I saw him very sweet on her last night,' rejoined his companion.'Deuced deal, they say,' replied Mr.The father is a cotton
lord, and they all have loads of tin, you know.'He is in Parliament, is not he?'''Gad, I believe he is,' said Mr.Cassilis; 'I never know who is in
Parliament in these days.I remember when there were only ten men in the
House of Commons who were not either members of Brookes' or this place.'I hear 'tis an old affair of Beau,' said another gentleman.'It was all
done a year ago at Rome or Paris.''They say she refused him then,' said Mr.'Well, that is tolerably cool for a manufacturer's daughter,' said his
friend.'The Duke will be deuced glad to see Beau settled, I take it,' said Mr.'A good deal depends on the tin,' said his friend.Coningsby threw down the 'Court Guide' with a sinking heart.In spite
of every insuperable difficulty, hitherto the end and object of all his
aspirations and all his exploits, sometimes even almost unconsciously
to himself, was Edith.The strange manner of last night was
fatally explained.The heart that once had been his was now another's.To the man who still loves there is in that conviction the most profound
and desolate sorrow of which our nature is capable.All the recollection
of the past, all the once-cherished prospects of the future, blend into
one bewildering anguish.Coningsby quitted the club, and mounting his
horse, rode rapidly out of town, almost unconscious of his direction.He found himself at length in a green lane near Willesden, silent and
undisturbed; he pulled up his horse, and summoned all his mind to the
contemplation of his prospects.Now, should he return to his grandfather, accept his
mission, and go down to Darlford on Friday?Favour and fortune, power,
prosperity, rank, distinction would be the consequence of this step;
might not he add even vengeance?Was there to be no term to his
endurance?Might not he teach this proud, prejudiced manufacturer, with
all his virulence and despotic caprices, a memorable lesson?And his
daughter, too, this betrothed, after all, of a young noble, with her
flush futurity of splendour and enjoyment, was she to hear of him only,
if indeed she heard of him at all, as of one toiling or trifling in the
humbler positions of existence; and wonder, with a blush, that he ever
could have been the hero of her romantic girlhood?His cheek burnt at the possibility of such ignominy!It was a conjuncture in his life that required decision.He thought of
his companions who looked up to him with such ardent anticipations of
his fame, of delight in his career, and confidence in his leading; were
all these high and fond fancies to be balked?On the very threshold of
life was he to blunder?'Tis the first step that leads to all, and
his was to be a wilful error.He remembered his first visit to his
grandfather, and the delight of his friends at Eton at his report on his
return.After eight years of initiation was he to lose that favour then
so highly prized, when the results which they had so long counted on
were on the very eve of accomplishment?Parliament and riches, and rank
and power; these were facts, realities, substances, that none could
mistake.Was he to sacrifice them for speculations, theories, shadows,
perhaps the vapours of a green and conceited brain?He was like Caesar by the starry river's side, watching the image of the
planets on its fatal waters.The sun set; the twilight spell fell upon his soul; the exaltation
of his spirit died away.Beautiful thoughts, full of sweetness and
tranquillity and consolation, came clustering round his heart like
seraphs.He thought of Edith in her hours of fondness; he thought of
the pure and solemn moments when to mingle his name with the heroes of
humanity was his aspiration, and to achieve immortal fame the inspiring
purpose of his life.What were the tawdry accidents of vulgar ambition
to him?No domestic despot could deprive him of his intellect, his
knowledge, the sustaining power of an unpolluted conscience.If he
possessed the intelligence in which he had confidence, the world
would recognise his voice even if not placed upon a pedestal.If the
principles of his philosophy were true, the great heart of the nation
would respond to their expression.Coningsby felt at this moment a
profound conviction which never again deserted him, that the conduct
which would violate the affections of the heart, or the dictates of the
conscience, however it may lead to immediate success, is a fatal error.Conscious that he was perhaps verging on some painful vicissitude of his
life, he devoted himself to a love that seemed hopeless, and to a fame
that was perhaps a dream.It was under the influence of these solemn resolutions that he wrote,
on his return home, a letter to Lord Monmouth, in which he expressed
all that affection which he really felt for his grandfather, and all
the pangs which it cost him to adhere to the conclusions he had already
announced.In terms of tenderness, and even humility, he declined to
become a candidate for Darlford, or even to enter Parliament, except as
the master of his own conduct.CHAPTER V.


Lady Monmouth was reclining on a sofa in that beautiful boudoir which
had been fitted up under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, but as he
then believed for the Princess Colonna.The walls were hung with amber
satin, painted by Delaroche with such subjects as might be expected from
his brilliant and picturesque pencil.Fair forms, heroes and heroines
in dazzling costume, the offspring of chivalry merging into what is
commonly styled civilisation, moved in graceful or fantastic groups amid
palaces and gardens.The ceiling, carved in the deep honeycomb fashion
of the Saracens, was richly gilt and picked out in violet.Upon a violet
carpet of velvet was represented the marriage of Cupid and Psyche.It was about two hours after Coningsby had quitted Monmouth House, and
Flora came in, sent for by Lady Monmouth as was her custom, to read to
her as she was employed with some light work.''Tis a new book of Sue,' said Lucretia.Flora, seated by her side, began to read.Reading was an accomplishment
which distinguished Flora; but to-day her voice faltered, her expression
was uncertain; she seemed but imperfectly to comprehend her page.More
than once Lady Monmouth looked round at her with an inquisitive glance.madam,' she at last exclaimed, 'if you would but speak to Mr.said Lady Monmouth, turning quickly on the sofa; then,
collecting herself in an instant, she continued with less abruptness,
and more suavity than usual, 'Tell me, Flora, what is it; what is the
matter?''My Lord,' sobbed Flora, 'has quarrelled with Mr.An expression of eager interest came over the countenance of Lucretia.'I do not know they have quarrelled; it is not, perhaps, a right term;
but my Lord is very angry with Mr.'Not very angry, I should think, Flora; and about what?'very angry, madam,' said Flora, shaking her head mournfully.'My
Lord told M. Villebecque that perhaps Mr.Coningsby would never enter
the house again.'Coningsby has only left this hour or two.He will not
do what my Lord wishes, about some seat in the Chamber.I do not know
exactly what it is; but my Lord is in one of his moods of terror: my
father is frightened even to go into his room when he is so.'Coningsby came, and he found that Mr.Lady Monmouth rose from her sofa, and walked once or twice up and down
the room.Then turning to Flora, she said, 'Go away now: the book is
stupid; it does not amuse me.Stop: find out all you can for me about
the quarrel before I speak to Mr.Lucretia remained for some time in meditation;
then she wrote a few lines, which she despatched at once to Mr.What a great man was the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby!Here was one
of the first peers of England, and one of the finest ladies in London,
both waiting with equal anxiety his return to town; and unable to
transact two affairs of vast importance, yet wholly unconnected, without
his interposition!What was the secret of the influence of this man,
confided in by everybody, trusted by none?His counsels were not deep,
his expedients were not felicitous; he had no feeling, and he could
create no sympathy.It is that, in most of the transactions of life,
there is some portion which no one cares to accomplish, and which
everybody wishes to be achieved.In the eye of the world he had constantly the appearance of being
mixed up with high dealings, and negotiations and arrangements of fine
management, whereas in truth, notwithstanding his splendid livery and
the airs he gave himself in the servants' hall, his real business in
life had ever been, to do the dirty work.Rigby had been shut up much at his villa of late.He was concocting,
you could not term it composing, an article, a'very slashing article,'
which was to prove that the penny postage must be the destruction of the
aristocracy.It was a grand subject, treated in his highest style.His
parallel portraits of Rowland Hill the conqueror of Almarez and Rowland
Hill the deviser of the cheap postage were enormously fine.It was full
of passages in italics, little words in great capitals, and almost drew
tears.The statistical details also were highly interesting and novel.Several of the old postmen, both twopenny and general, who had been in
office with himself, and who were inspired with an equal zeal against
that spirit of reform of which they had alike been victims, supplied him
with information which nothing but a breach of ministerial duty could
have furnished.The prophetic peroration as to the irresistible progress
of democracy was almost as powerful as one of Rigby's speeches on
Aldborough or Amersham.There never was a fellow for giving a good
hearty kick to the people like Rigby.Himself sprung from the dregs of
the populace, this was disinterested.What could be more patriotic and
magnanimous than his Jeremiads over the fall of the Montmorencis and the
Crillons, or the possible catastrophe of the Percys and the Manners!The
truth of all this hullabaloo was that Rigby had a sly pension which,
by an inevitable association of ideas, he always connected with the
maintenance of an aristocracy.All his rigmarole dissertations on the
French revolution were impelled by this secret influence; and when he
wailed over 'la guerre aux chateaux,' and moaned like a mandrake over
Nottingham Castle in flames, the rogue had an eye all the while to
quarter-day!Arriving in town the day after Coningsby's interview with his
grandfather, Mr.Rigby found a summons to Monmouth House waiting him,
and an urgent note from Lucretia begging that he would permit nothing
to prevent him seeing her for a few minutes before he called on the
Marquess.Lucretia, acting on the unconscious intimation of Flora, had in the
course of four-and-twenty hours obtained pretty ample and accurate
details of the cause of contention between Coningsby and her husband.Rigby not only that Lord Monmouth was
highly incensed against his grandson, but that the cause of their
misunderstanding arose about a seat in the House of Commons, and that
seat too the one which Mr.Rigby had long appropriated to himself,
and over whose registration he had watched with such affectionate
solicitude.Lady Monmouth arranged this information like a firstrate artist, and
gave it a grouping and a colour which produced the liveliest effect
upon her confederate.The countenance of Rigby was almost ghastly as
he received the intelligence; a grin, half of malice, half of terror,
played over his features.'I told you to beware of him long ago,' said Lady Monmouth.'He is, he
has ever been, in the way of both of us.''He is in my power,' said Rigby.'He is in love with the daughter of Millbank, the man who bought
Hellingsley.'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, in a prolonged tone.'He was at Coningsby all last summer, hanging about her.I found the
younger Millbank quite domiciliated at the Castle; a fact which, of
itself, if known to Lord Monmouth, would ensure the lad's annihilation.''And you kept this fine news for a winter campaign, my good Mr.Rigby,'
said Lady Monmouth, with a subtle smile.'The time is not always ripe,' said Mr.Let us not conceal it from ourselves that,
since his first visit to Coningsby, we have neither of us really been in
the same position which we then occupied, or believed we should occupy.My Lord, though you would scarcely believe it, has a weakness for this
boy; and though I by my marriage, and you by your zealous ability,
have apparently secured a permanent hold upon his habits, I have never
doubted that when the crisis comes we shall find that the golden fruit
is plucked by one who has not watched the garden.There is
no reason why we two should clash together: we can both of us find what
we want, and more securely if we work in company.''I trust my devotion to you has never been doubted, dear madam.'Rid
me of this Coningsby, and I will secure you all that you want.'It shall be done,' said Rigby; 'it must be done.If once the notion
gets wind that one of the Castle family may perchance stand for
Darlford, all the present combinations will be disorganised.'So I hear for certain,' said Lucretia.'Be sure there is no time to
lose.What does he want with you to-day?''I know not: there are so many things.''To be sure; and yet I cannot doubt he will speak of this quarrel.Whatever his mood, the subject may be
introduced.If good, you will guide him more easily; if dark, the love
for the Hellingsley girl, the fact of the brother being in his castle,
drinking his wine, riding his horses, ordering about his servants; you
will omit no details: a Millbank quite at home at Coningsby will lash
him to madness!Go,
go, or he may hear that you have arrived.I shall be at home all the
morning.It will be but gallant that you should pay me a little visit
when you have transacted your business._Au revoir!_'

Lady Monmouth took up again her French novel; but her eyes soon glanced
over the page, unattached by its contents.Her own existence was too
interesting to find any excitement in fiction.It was nearly three years
since her marriage; that great step which she ever had a conviction was
to lead to results still greater.Of late she had often been filled with
a presentiment that they were near at hand; never more so than on
this day.Irresistible was the current of associations that led her to
meditate on freedom, wealth, power; on a career which should at the same
time dazzle the imagination and gratify her heart.Notwithstanding the
gossip of Paris, founded on no authentic knowledge of her husband's
character or information, based on the haphazard observations of the
floating multitude, Lucretia herself had no reason to fear that her
influence over Lord Monmouth, if exerted, was materially diminished.But
satisfied that he had formed no other tie, with her ever the test of
her position, she had not thought it expedient, and certainly would have
found it irksome, to maintain that influence by any ostentatious means.She knew that Lord Monmouth was capricious, easily wearied, soon palled;
and that on men who have no affections, affection has no hold.Their
passions or their fancies, on the contrary, as it seemed to her, are
rather stimulated by neglect or indifference, provided that they are not
systematic; and the circumstance of a wife being admired by one who is
not her husband sometimes wonderfully revives the passion or renovates
the respect of him who should be devoted to her.The health of Lord Monmouth was the subject which never was long absent
from the vigilance or meditation of Lucretia.She was well assured that
his life was no longer secure.She knew that after their marriage he had
made a will, which secured to her a large portion of his great wealth in
case of their having no issue, and after the accident at Paris all
hope in that respect was over.Recently the extreme anxiety which Lord
Monmouth had evinced about terminating the abeyance of the barony to
which his first wife was a co-heiress in favour of his grandson, had
alarmed Lucretia.To establish in the land another branch of the house
of Coningsby was evidently the last excitement of Lord Monmouth, and
perhaps a permanent one.If the idea were once accepted, notwithstanding
the limit to its endowment which Lord Monmouth might at the first start
contemplate, Lucretia had sufficiently studied his temperament to be
convinced that all his energies and all his resources would ultimately
be devoted to its practical fulfilment.Her original prejudice against
Coningsby and jealousy of his influence had therefore of late been
considerably aggravated; and the intelligence that for the first time
there was a misunderstanding between Coningsby and her husband filled
her with excitement and hope.She knew her Lord well enough to feel
assured that the cause for displeasure in the present instance could not
be a light one; she resolved instantly to labour that it should not
be transient; and it so happened that she had applied for aid in this
endeavour to the very individual in whose power it rested to accomplish
all her desire, while in doing so he felt at the same time he was
defending his own position and advancing his own interests.Lady Monmouth was now waiting with some excitement the return of Mr.His interview with his patron was of unusual length.An hour, and
more than an hour, had elapsed.Lady Monmouth again threw aside the book
which more than once she had discarded.She paced the room, restless
rather than disquieted.She had complete confidence in Rigby's ability
for the occasion; and with her knowledge of Lord Monmouth's character,
she could not contemplate the possibility of failure, if the
circumstances were adroitly introduced to his consideration.Still time
stole on: the harassing and exhausting process of suspense was acting
on her nervous system.She began to think that Rigby had not found
the occasion favourable for the catastrophe; that Lord Monmouth, from
apprehension of disturbing Rigby and entailing explanations on himself,
had avoided the necessary communication; that her skilful combination
for the moment had missed.Two hours had now elapsed, and Lucretia, in a
state of considerable irritation, was about to inquire whether Mr.Rigby
were with his Lordship when the door of her boudoir opened, and that
gentleman appeared.'Now sit down and
tell me what has passed.'Lady Monmouth pointed to the seat which Flora had occupied.'I thank your Ladyship,' said Mr.Rigby, with a somewhat grave and yet
perplexed expression of countenance, and seating himself at some little
distance from his companion, 'but I am very well here.'Instead of responding to the invitation of Lady
Monmouth to communicate with his usual readiness and volubility, Mr.Rigby was silent, and, if it were possible to use such an expression
with regard to such a gentleman, apparently embarrassed.'Well,' said Lady Monmouth, 'does he know about the Millbanks?''His Lordship was greatly shocked,' replied Mr.Rigby, with a pious
expression of features.As his Lordship
very justly observed, "It is impossible to say what is going on under my
own roof, or to what I can trust."''But he made an exception in your favour, I dare say, my dear Mr.'Lord Monmouth was pleased to say that I possessed his entire
confidence,' said Mr.Rigby, 'and that he looked to me in his
difficulties.''The steps which his Lordship is about to take with reference to the
establishment generally,' said Mr.Rigby, 'will allow the connection
that at present subsists between that gentleman and his noble relative,
now that Lord Monmouth's eyes are open to his real character, to
terminate naturally, without the necessity of any formal explanation.''But what do you mean by the steps he is going to take in his
establishment generally?''Lord Monmouth thinks he requires change of scene.'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, with
great impatience.'I hope he is not going again to that dreadful castle in Lancashire.''Lord Monmouth was thinking that, as you were tired of Paris, you might
find some of the German Baths agreeable.''Why, there is nothing that Lord Monmouth dislikes so much as a German
bathing-place!''Then how capricious in him wanting to go to them?''He does not want to go to them!'said Lady Monmouth, in a lower voice, and
looking him full in the face with a glance seldom bestowed.There was a churlish and unusual look about Rigby.It was as if
malignant, and yet at the same time a little frightened, he had screwed
himself into doggedness.He suggests that if your Ladyship were
to pass the summer at Kissengen, for example, and a paragraph in the
_Morning Post_ were to announce that his Lordship was about to join you
there, all awkwardness would be removed; and no one could for a moment
take the liberty of supposing, even if his Lordship did not ultimately
reach you, that anything like a separation had occurred.''I would never have consented to
interfere in the affair, but to secure that most desirable point.''I will see Lord Monmouth at once,' said Lucretia, rising, her natural
pallor aggravated into a ghoul-like tint.'His Lordship has gone out,' said Mr.'Our conversation, sir, then finishes; I wait his return.''His Lordship will never return to Monmouth House again.'And
he really thinks that I am to be crushed by such an instrument as this!He may leave Monmouth House, but I shall not.'Still anxious to secure an amicable separation,' said Mr.Rigby, 'your
Ladyship must allow me to place the circumstances of the case fairly
before your excellent judgment.Lord Monmouth has decided upon a course:
you know as well as I that he never swerves from his resolutions.He has
left peremptory instructions, and he will listen to no appeal.He has
empowered me to represent to your Ladyship that he wishes in every way
to consider your convenience.He suggests that everything, in short,
should be arranged as if his Lordship were himself unhappily no more;
that your Ladyship should at once enter into your jointure, which
shall be made payable quarterly to your order, provided you can find
it convenient to live upon the Continent,' added Mr.Rigby, with some
hesitation.'Why, then, we will leave your Ladyship to the assertion of your
rights.''I beg your Ladyship's pardon.I speak as the friend of the family, the
trustee of your marriage settlement, well known also as Lord Monmouth's
executor,' said Mr.Rigby, his countenance gradually regaining its
usual callous confidence, and some degree of self-complacency, as he
remembered the good things which he enumerated.'I have decided,' said Lady Monmouth.Your
master has mistaken my character and his own position.He shall rue the
day that he assailed me.''I should be sorry if there were any violence,' said Mr.Rigby,
'especially as everything is left to my management and control.An
office, indeed, which I only accepted for your mutual advantage.I think, upon reflection, I might put before your Ladyship some
considerations which might induce you, on the whole, to be of opinion
that it will be better for us to draw together in this business, as we
have hitherto, indeed, throughout an acquaintance now of some years.'Rigby was assuming all his usual tone of brazen familiarity.'Your self-confidence exceeds even Lord Monmouth's estimate of it,' said
Lucretia.'Now, now, you are unkind.I am
interfering in this business for your sake.It would have fallen to another, who would have fulfilled
it without any delicacy and consideration for your feelings.View my
interposition in that light, my dear Lady Monmouth, and circumstances
will assume altogether a new colour.''I beg that you will quit the house, sir.''I would with pleasure, to oblige you, were
it in my power; but Lord Monmouth has particularly desired that I should
take up my residence here permanently.For your Ladyship's sake, I wish
everything to be accomplished with tranquillity, and, if possible,
friendliness and good feeling.You can have even a week for the
preparations for your departure, if necessary.Any carriages, too, that you desire; your jewels, at least all
those that are not at the bankers'.The arrangement about your jointure,
your letters of credit, even your passport, I will attend to myself;
only too happy if, by this painful interference, I have in any way
contributed to soften the annoyance which, at the first blush, you may
naturally experience, but which, like everything else, take my word,
will wear off.''I shall send for Lord Eskdale,' said Lady Monmouth.Rigby, 'that Lord Eskdale will give you the
same advice as myself, if he only reads your Ladyship's letters,' he
added slowly, 'to Prince Trautsmansdorff.''Pardon me,' said Rigby, putting his hand in his pocket, as if to guard
some treasure, 'I have no wish to revive painful associations; but I
have them, and I must act upon them, if you persist in treating me as
a foe, who am in reality your best friend; which indeed I ought to be,
having the honour of acting as trustee under your marriage settlement,
and having known you so many years.''Leave me for the present alone,' said Lady Monmouth.'Send me my
servant, if I have one.I shall not remain here the week which you
mention, but quit at once this house, which I wish I had never entered.Rigby, you are now lord of Monmouth House, and yet I cannot
help feeling you too will be discharged before he dies.'Rigby made Lady Monmouth a bow such as became the master of the
house, and then withdrew.A paragraph in the _Morning Post_, a few days after his interview with
his grandfather, announcing that Lord and Lady Monmouth had quitted town
for the baths of Kissengen, startled Coningsby, who called the same day
at Monmouth House in consequence.There he learnt more authentic details
of their unexpected movements.It appeared that Lady Monmouth had
certainly departed; and the porter, with a rather sceptical visage,
informed Coningsby that Lord Monmouth was to follow; but when, he could
not tell.At present his Lordship was at Brighton, and in a few days was
about to take possession of a villa at Richmond, which had for some time
been fitting up for him under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, who, as
Coningsby also learnt, now permanently resided at Monmouth House.All
this intelligence made Coningsby ponder.He was sufficiently acquainted
with the parties concerned to feel assured that he had not learnt the
whole truth.What had really taken place, and what was the real cause of
the occurrences, were equally mystical to him: all he was convinced of
was, that some great domestic revolution had been suddenly effected.Coningsby entertained for his grandfather a sincere affection.With the
exception of their last unfortunate interview, he had experienced from
Lord Monmouth nothing but kindness both in phrase and deed.There was
also something in Lord Monmouth, when he pleased it, rather fascinating
to young men; and as Coningsby had never occasioned him any feelings but
pleasurable ones, he was always disposed to make himself delightful to
his grandson.The experience of a consummate man of the world, advanced
in life, detailed without rigidity to youth, with frankness and
facility, is bewitching.Lord Monmouth was never garrulous: he was
always pithy, and could be picturesque.He revealed a character in a
sentence, and detected the ruling passion with the hand of a master.Besides, he had seen everybody and had done everything; and though, on
the whole, too indolent for conversation, and loving to be talked to,
these were circumstances which made his too rare communications the more
precious.With these feelings, Coningsby resolved, the moment that he learned that
his grandfather was established at Richmond, to pay him a visit.He
was informed that Lord Monmouth was at home, and he was shown into a
drawing-room, where he found two French ladies in their bonnets, whom he
soon discovered to be actresses.They also had come down to pay a visit
to his grandfather, and were by no means displeased to pass the interval
that must elapse before they had that pleasure in chatting with his
grandson.Coningsby found them extremely amusing; with the finest
spirits in the world, imperturbable good temper, and an unconscious
practical philosophy that defied the devil Care and all his works.And
well it was that he found such agreeable companions, for time flowed on,
and no summons arrived to call him to his grandfather's presence, and
no herald to announce his grandfather's advent.The ladies and Coningsby
had exhausted badinage; they had examined and criticised all the
furniture, had rifled the vases of their prettiest flowers; and
Clotilde, who had already sung several times, was proposing a duet to
Ermengarde, when a servant entered, and told the ladies that a carriage
was in attendance to give them an airing, and after that Lord Monmouth
hoped they would return and dine with him; then turning to Coningsby, he
informed him, with his lord's compliments, that Lord Monmouth was sorry
he was too much engaged to see him.Nothing was to be done but to put a tolerably good face upon it.'Embrace Lord Monmouth for me,' said Coningsby to his fair friends, 'and
tell him I think it very unkind that he did not ask me to dinner with
you.'Coningsby said this with a gay air, but really with a depressed spirit.He felt convinced that his grandfather was deeply displeased with him;
and as he rode away from the villa, he could not resist the strong
impression that he was destined never to re-enter it.It so happened that the idle message which Coningsby had left
for his grandfather, and which he never seriously supposed for a moment
that his late companions would have given their host, operated entirely
in his favour.Whatever were the feelings with respect to Coningsby at
the bottom of Lord Monmouth's heart, he was actuated in his refusal to
see him not more from displeasure than from an anticipatory horror of
something like a scene.Even a surrender from Coningsby without terms,
and an offer to declare himself a candidate for Darlford, or to do
anything else that his grandfather wished, would have been disagreeable
to Lord Monmouth in his present mood.As in politics a revolution is
often followed by a season of torpor, so in the case of Lord Monmouth
the separation from his wife, which had for a long period occupied his
meditation, was succeeded by a vein of mental dissipation.He did not
wish to be reminded by anything or any person that he had still in
some degree the misfortune of being a responsible member of society.He wanted to be surrounded by individuals who were above or below the
conventional interests of what is called 'the World.'He wanted to hear
nothing of those painful and embarrassing influences which from our
contracted experience and want of enlightenment we magnify into such
undue importance.For this purpose he wished to have about him persons
whose knowledge of the cares of life concerned only the means of
existence, and whose sense of its objects referred only to the sources
of enjoyment; persons who had not been educated in the idolatry of
Respectability; that is to say, of realising such an amount of what is
termed character by a hypocritical deference to the prejudices of the
community as may enable them, at suitable times, and under convenient
circumstances and disguises, to plunder the public.With these feelings, Lord Monmouth recoiled at this moment from
grandsons and relations and ties of all kinds.He did not wish to be
reminded of his identity, but to swim unmolested and undisturbed in
his Epicurean dream.When, therefore, his fair visitors; Clotilde, who
opened her mouth only to breathe roses and diamonds, and Ermengarde, who
was so good-natured that she sacrificed even her lovers to her friends;
saw him merely to exclaim at the same moment, and with the same voices
of thrilling joyousness,--

'Why did not you ask him to dinner?'And then, without waiting for his reply, entered with that rapidity of
elocution which Frenchwomen can alone command into the catalogue of his
charms and accomplishments, Lord Monmouth began to regret that he really
had not seen Coningsby, who, it appeared, might have greatly contributed
to the pleasure of the day.The message, which was duly given,
however, settled the business.Lord Monmouth felt that any chance of
explanations, or even allusions to the past, was out of the question;
and to defend himself from the accusations of his animated guests, he
said,

'Well, he shall come to dine with you next time.'There is no end to the influence of woman on our life.It is at the
bottom of everything that happens to us.And so it was, that, in spite
of all the combinations of Lucretia and Mr.Rigby, and the mortification
and resentment of Lord Monmouth, the favourable impression he casually
made on a couple of French actresses occasioned Coningsby, before a
month had elapsed since his memorable interview at Monmouth House, to
receive an invitation again to dine with his grandfather.Clotilde and Ermengarde had wits as sparkling
as their eyes.There was a manager of the Opera, a great friend of
Villebecque, and his wife, a splendid lady, who had been a prima donna
of celebrity, and still had a commanding voice for a chamber; a Carlist
nobleman who lived upon his traditions, and who, though without a sou,
could tell of a festival given by his family, before the revolution,
which had cost a million of francs; and a Neapolitan physician, in whom
Lord Monmouth had great confidence, and who himself believed in the
elixir vitae, made up the party, with Lucian Gay, Coningsby, and Mr.Our hero remarked that Villebecque on this occasion sat at the
bottom of the table, but Flora did not appear.In the meantime, the month which brought about this satisfactory and
at one time unexpected result was fruitful also in other circumstances
still more interesting.Coningsby and Edith met frequently, if to
breathe the same atmosphere in the same crowded saloons can be described
as meeting; ever watching each other's movements, and yet studious never
to encounter each other's glance.The charms of Miss Millbank had
become an universal topic, they were celebrated in ball-rooms, they were
discussed at clubs: Edith was the beauty of the season.All admired her,
many sighed even to express their admiration; but the devotion of Lord
Beaumanoir, who always hovered about her, deterred them from a rivalry
which might have made the boldest despair.As for Coningsby, he passed
his life principally with the various members of the Sydney family, and
was almost daily riding with Lady Everingham and her sister, generally
accompanied by Lord Henry and his friend Eustace Lyle, between whom,
indeed, and Coningsby there were relations of intimacy scarcely less
inseparable.Coningsby had spoken to Lady Everingham of the rumoured
marriage of her elder brother, and found, although the family had not
yet been formally apprised of it, she entertained little doubt of
its ultimate occurrence.She admired Miss Millbank, with whom her
acquaintance continued slight; and she wished, of course, that her
brother should marry and be happy.'But Percy is often in love,' she
would add, 'and never likes us to be very intimate with his inamoratas.He thinks it destroys the romance; and that domestic familiarity may
compromise his heroic character.However,' she added, 'I really believe
that will be a match.'On the whole, though he bore a serene aspect to the world, Coningsby
passed this month in a state of restless misery.His soul was brooding
on one subject, and he had no confidant: he could not resist the spell
that impelled him to the society where Edith might at least be seen, and
the circle in which he lived was one in which her name was frequently
mentioned.Alone, in his solitary rooms in the Albany, he felt all his
desolation; and often a few minutes before he figured in the world,
apparently followed and courted by all, he had been plunged in the
darkest fits of irremediable wretchedness.He had, of course, frequently met Lady Wallinger, but their salutations,
though never omitted, and on each side cordial, were brief.There seemed
to be a tacit understanding between them not to refer to a subject
fruitful in painful reminiscences.In the fulfilment of a project originally formed
in the playing-fields of Eton, often recurred to at Cambridge, and
cherished with the fondness with which men cling to a scheme of early
youth, Coningsby, Henry Sydney, Vere, and Buckhurst had engaged some
moors together this year; and in a few days they were about to quit town
for Scotland.They had pressed Eustace Lyle to accompany them, but he,
who in general seemed to have no pleasure greater than their society,
had surprised them by declining their invitation, with some vague
mention that he rather thought he should go abroad.It was the last day of July, and all the world were at a breakfast
given, at a fanciful cottage situate in beautiful gardens on the banks
of the Thames, by Lady Everingham.The weather was as bright as the
romances of Boccaccio; there were pyramids of strawberries, in bowls
colossal enough to hold orange-trees; and the choicest band filled the
air with enchanting strains, while a brilliant multitude sauntered on
turf like velvet, or roamed in desultory existence amid the quivering
shades of winding walks.'My fete was prophetic,' said Lady Everingham, when she saw Coningsby.'I am glad it is connected with an incident.Tell me what we are to
celebrate.''Then I, too, will prophesy, and name the hero of the romance, Eustace
Lyle.''You have been more prescient than I,' said Lady Everingham, 'perhaps
because I was thinking too much of some one else.''It seems to me an union which all must acknowledge perfect.I have had my suspicions a long time; and when
Eustace refused to go to the moors with us, though I said nothing, I was
convinced.''At any rate,' said Lady Everingham, sighing, with a rather smiling
face, 'we are kinsfolk, Mr.Coningsby; though I would gladly have wished
to have been more.'Happiness,' he
added, in a mournful tone, 'I fear can never be mine.''tis a tale too strange and sorrowful for a day when, like Seged,
we must all determine to be happy.''Here comes a group that will make you gay,' said Coningsby as he
moved on.Edith and the Wallingers, accompanied by Lord Beaumanoir, Mr.Melton, and Sir Charles Buckhurst, formed the party.They seemed profuse
in their congratulations to Lady Everingham, having already learnt the
intelligence from her brother.Coningsby stopped to speak to Lady St.Julians, who had still a daughter
to marry.Both Augustina, who was at Coningsby Castle, and Clara
Isabella, who ought to have been there, had each secured the right man.But Adelaide Victoria had now appeared, and Lady St.Julians had a great
regard for the favourite grandson of Lord Monmouth, and also for the
influential friend of Lord Vere and Sir Charles Buckhurst.In case
Coningsby did not determine to become her son-in-law himself, he might
counsel either of his friends to a judicious decision on an inevitable
act.Ormsby, who seemed
occupied with some delicacies.no, no, no; those days are passed.I think there is a little
easterly wind with all this fine appearance.''I am for in-door nature myself,' said Lord Eskdale.'Do you know, I do
not half like the way Monmouth is going on?He never gets out of that
villa of his.'I had a letter from her to-day: she writes in good spirits.I am sorry
it broke up, and yet I never thought it would last so long.''I gave them two years,' said Mr.'Lord Monmouth lived with his
first wife two years.And afterwards with the Mirandola at Milan, at
least nearly two years; it was a year and ten months.I must know,
for he called me in to settle affairs.I took the lady to the baths at
Lucca, on the pretence that Monmouth would meet us there.I remember I wanted
to bet Cassilis, at White's, on it when he married; but I thought, being
his intimate friend; the oldest friend he has, indeed, and one of his
trustees; it was perhaps as well not to do it.''You should have made the bet with himself,' said Lord Eskdale, 'and
then there never would have been a separation.''Hah, hah, hah!About an hour after this, Coningsby, who had just quitted the Duchess,
met, on a terrace by the river, Lady Wallinger, walking with Mrs.Guy
Flouncey and a Russian Prince, whom that lady was enchanting.Coningsby
was about to pass with some slight courtesy, but Lady Wallinger stopped
and would speak to him, on slight subjects, the weather and the fete,
but yet adroitly enough managed to make him turn and join her.Guy Flouncey walked on a little before with her Russian admirer.Lady
Wallinger followed with Coningsby.'The match that has been proclaimed to-day has greatly surprised me,'
said Lady Wallinger.said Coningsby: 'I confess I was long prepared for it.And it
seems to me the most natural alliance conceivable, and one that every
one must approve.''Lady Everingham seems much surprised at it.'Lady Everingham is a brilliant personage, and cannot deign to
observe obvious circumstances.'Coningsby, that I always thought you were engaged to
Lady Theresa?''Indeed, we were informed more than a month ago that you were positively
going to be married to her.''I am not one of those who can shift their affections with such
rapidity, Lady Wallinger.''You remember our meeting you on the
stairs at ---- House, Mr.'Edith had just been informed that you were going to be married to Lady
Theresa.''Not surely by him to whom she is herself going to be married?''I am not aware that she is going to be married to any one.Lord
Beaumanoir admires her, has always admired her.But Edith has given
him no encouragement, at least gave him no encouragement as long as she
believed; but why dwell on such an unhappy subject, Mr.I
am to blame; I have been to blame perhaps before, but indeed I think it
cruel, very cruel, that Edith and you are kept asunder.''You have always been my best, my dearest friend, and are the most
amiable and admirable of women.But tell me, is it indeed true that
Edith is not going to be married?'Guy Flouncey turned round, and assuring Lady
Wallinger that the Prince and herself had agreed to refer some point
to her about the most transcendental ethics of flirtation, this deeply
interesting conversation was arrested, and Lady Wallinger, with
becoming suavity, was obliged to listen to the lady's lively appeal of
exaggerated nonsense and the Prince's affected protests, while Coningsby
walked by her side, pale and agitated, and then offered his arm to Lady
Wallinger, which she accepted with an affectionate pressure.At the end
of the terrace they met some other guests, and soon were immersed in the
multitude that thronged the lawn.'There is Sir Joseph,' said Lady Wallinger, and Coningsby looked up,
and saw Edith on his arm.Lord
Beaumanoir was there, but he seemed to shrink into nothing to-day before
Buckhurst, who was captivated for the moment by Edith, and hearing
that no knight was resolute enough to try a fall with the Marquess, was
impelled by his talent for action to enter the lists.He had talked down
everybody, unhorsed every cavalier.Nobody had a chance against him:
he answered all your questions before you asked them; contradicted
everybody with the intrepidity of a Rigby; annihilated your anecdotes by
historiettes infinitely more piquant; and if anybody chanced to make a
joke which he could not excel, declared immediately that it was a Joe
Miller.He was absurd, extravagant, grotesque, noisy; but he was young,
rattling, and interesting, from his health and spirits.Edith was
extremely amused by him, and was encouraging by her smile his spiritual
excesses, when they all suddenly met Lady Wallinger and Coningsby.The eyes of Edith and Coningsby met for the first time since they so
cruelly encountered on the staircase of ---- House.A deep, quick blush
suffused her face, her eyes gleamed with a sudden coruscation; suddenly
and quickly she put forth her hand.he presses once more that hand which permanently to retain is the
passion of his life, yet which may never be his!It seemed that for the
ravishing delight of that moment he could have borne with cheerfulness
all the dark and harrowing misery of the year that had passed away since
he embraced her in the woods of Hellingsley, and pledged his faith by
the waters of the rushing Darl.He seized the occasion which offered itself, a moment to walk by her
side, and to snatch some brief instants of unreserved communion.'And now we are to each other as before?''And will be, come what come may.'CHAPTER I.


It was merry Christmas at St.There was a yule log blazing
on every hearth in that wide domain, from the hall of the squire to the
peasant's roof.The Buttery Hatch was open for the whole week from noon
to sunset; all comers might take their fill, and each carry away as much
bold beef, white bread, and jolly ale as a strong man could bear in
a basket with one hand.For every woman a red cloak, and a coat of
broadcloth for every man.All day long, carts laden with fuel and warm
raiment were traversing the various districts, distributing comfort and
dispensing cheer.For a Christian gentleman of high degree was Eustace
Lyle.Within his hall, too, he holds his revel, and his beauteous bride
welcomes their guests, from her noble parents to the faithful tenants of
the house.All classes are mingled in the joyous equality that becomes
the season, at once sacred and merry.There are carols for the eventful
eve, and mummers for the festive day.The Duke and Duchess, and every member of the family, had consented this
year to keep their Christmas with the newly-married couple.Coningsby,
too, was there, and all his friends.The party was numerous, gay,
hearty, and happy; for they were all united by sympathy.They were planning that Henry Sydney should be appointed Lord of
Misrule, or ordained Abbot of Unreason at the least, so successful had
been his revival of the Mummers, the Hobby-horse not forgotten.Their host had entrusted to Lord Henry the restoration of many old
observances; and the joyous feeling which this celebration of Christmas
had diffused throughout an extensive district was a fresh argument in
favour of Lord Henry's principle, that a mere mechanical mitigation of
the material necessities of the humbler classes, a mitigation which must
inevitably be limited, can never alone avail sufficiently to ameliorate
their condition; that their condition is not merely 'a knife and fork
question,' to use the coarse and shallow phrase of the Utilitarian
school; that a simple satisfaction of the grosser necessities of our
nature will not make a happy people; that you must cultivate the heart
as well as seek to content the belly; and that the surest means to
elevate the character of the people is to appeal to their affections.There is nothing more interesting than to trace predisposition.An
indefinite, yet strong sympathy with the peasantry of the realm had been
one of the characteristic sensibilities of Lord Henry at Eton.Yet a
schoolboy, he had busied himself with their pastimes and the details of
their cottage economy.As he advanced in life the horizon of his views
expanded with his intelligence and his experience; and the son of one of
the noblest of our houses, to whom the delights of life are offered with
fatal facility, on the very threshold of his career he devoted his
time and thought, labour and life, to one vast and noble purpose, the
elevation of the condition of the great body of the people.'I vote for Buckhurst being Lord of Misrule,' said Lord Henry: 'I will
be content with being his gentleman usher.''It shall be put to the vote,' said Lord Vere.'No one has a chance against Buckhurst,' said Coningsby.'Now, Sir Charles,' said Lady Everingham, 'your absolute sway is about
to commence.'The first thing must be my formal installation,' said Buckhurst.'I
vote the Boar's head be carried in procession thrice round the hall, and
Beau shall be the champion to challenge all who may question my right.Duke, you shall be my chief butler, the Duchess my herb-woman.She is to
walk before me, and scatter rosemary.Coningsby shall carry the Boar's
head; Lady Theresa and Lady Everingham shall sing the canticle; Lord
Everingham shall be marshal of the lists, and put all in the stocks who
are found sober and decorous; Lyle shall be the palmer from the Holy
Land, and Vere shall ride the Hobby-horse.Some must carry cups of
Hippocras, some lighted tapers; all must join in chorus.'He ceased his instructions, and all hurried away to carry them into
effect.Some hastily arrayed themselves in fanciful dresses, the ladies
in robes of white, with garlands of flowers; some drew pieces of armour
from the wall, and decked themselves with helm and hauberk; others waved
ancient banners.They brought in the Boar's head on a large silver dish,
and Coningsby raised it aloft.They formed into procession, the Duchess
distributing rosemary; Buckhurst swaggering with all the majesty of
Tamerlane, his mock court irresistibly humorous with their servility;
and the sweet voice of Lady Everingham chanting the first verse of the
canticle, followed in the second by the rich tones of Lady Theresa:

  I.
        Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade in hande bring I,
  With garlandes gay and rosemary:
  I pray you all singe merrily,
        Qui estis in convivio.Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade I understande
  Is the chief servyce in this lande
  Loke whereever it be fande,
        Servite cum cantico.Then they stopped; and the Lord
of Misrule ascended his throne, and his courtiers formed round him
in circle.Behind him they held the ancient banners and waved their
glittering arms, and placed on a lofty and illuminated pedestal the
Boar's head covered with garlands.It was a good picture, and the Lord
of Misrule sustained his part with untiring energy.He was addressing
his court in a pompous rhapsody of merry nonsense, when a servant
approached Coningsby, and told him that he was wanted without.A despatch had arrived for him from
London.Without any prescience of its purpose, he nevertheless broke
the seal with a trembling hand.His presence was immediately desired in
town: Lord Monmouth was dead.This was a crisis in the life of Coningsby; yet, like many critical
epochs, the person most interested in it was not sufficiently aware
of its character.The first feeling which he experienced at the
intelligence was sincere affliction.He was fond of his grandfather; had
received great kindness from him, and at a period of life when it was
most welcome.The neglect and hardships of his early years, instead of
leaving a prejudice against one who, by some, might be esteemed their
author, had by their contrast only rendered Coningsby more keenly
sensible of the solicitude and enjoyment which had been lavished on his
happy youth.The next impression on his mind was undoubtedly a natural and reasonable
speculation on the effect of this bereavement on his fortunes.Lord
Monmouth had more than once assured Coningsby that he had provided for
him as became a near relative to whom he was attached, and in a manner
which ought to satisfy the wants and wishes of an English gentleman.The
allowance which Lord Monmouth had made him, as considerable as usually
accorded to the eldest sons of wealthy peers, might justify him in
estimating his future patrimony as extremely ample.He was aware,
indeed, that at a subsequent period his grandfather had projected for
him fortunes of a still more elevated character.He looked to Coningsby
as the future representative of an ancient barony, and had been
purchasing territory with the view of supporting the title.But
Coningsby did not by any means firmly reckon on these views being
realised.He had a suspicion that in thwarting the wishes of his
grandfather in not becoming a candidate for Darlford, he had at the
moment arrested arrangements which, from the tone of Lord Monmouth's
communication, he believed were then in progress for that purpose;
and he thought it improbable, with his knowledge of his grandfather's
habits, that Lord Monmouth had found either time or inclination to
resume before his decease the completion of these plans.Indeed there
was a period when, in adopting the course which he pursued with respect
to Darlford, Coningsby was well aware that he perilled more than the
large fortune which was to accompany the barony.Had not a separation
between Lord Monmouth and his wife taken place simultaneously with
Coningsby's difference with his grandfather, he was conscious that the
consequences might have been even altogether fatal to his prospects; but
the absence of her evil influence at such a conjuncture, its permanent
removal, indeed, from the scene, coupled with his fortunate though not
formal reconciliation with Lord Monmouth, had long ago banished from his
memory all those apprehensions to which he had felt it impossible at the
time to shut his eyes.Before he left town for Scotland he had made a
farewell visit to his grandfather, who, though not as cordial as in
old days, had been gracious; and Coningsby, during his excursion to the
moors, and his various visits to the country, had continued at intervals
to write to his grandfather, as had been for some years his custom.On
the whole, with an indefinite feeling which, in spite of many a rational
effort, did nevertheless haunt his mind, that this great and sudden
event might exercise a vast and beneficial influence on his worldly
position, Coningsby could not but feel some consolation in the
affliction which he sincerely experienced, in the hope that he might at
all events now offer to Edith a home worthy of her charms, her virtues,
and her love.Although he had not seen her since their hurried yet sweet
reconciliation in the gardens of Lady Everingham, Coningsby was never
long without indirect intelligence of the incidents of her life; and the
correspondence between Lady Everingham and Henry Sydney, while they
were at the moors, had apprised him that Lord Beaumanoir's suit had
terminated unsuccessfully almost immediately after his brother had
quitted London.It was late in the evening when Coningsby arrived in town: he called at
once on Lord Eskdale, who was one of Lord Monmouth's executors; and he
persuaded Coningsby, whom he saw depressed, to dine with him alone.'You should not be seen at a club,' said the good-natured peer; 'and I
remember myself in old days what was the wealth of an Albanian larder.'Lord Eskdale, at dinner, talked frankly of the disposition of Lord
Monmouth's property.He spoke as a matter of course that Coningsby was
his grandfather's principal heir.'I don't know whether you will be happier with a large fortune?''It is a troublesome thing: nobody is satisfied with
what you do with it; very often not yourself.To maintain an equable
expenditure; not to spend too much on one thing, too little on another,
is an art.There must be a harmony, a keeping, in disbursement, which
very few men have.The thing to have is about ten
thousand a year, and the world to think you have only five.There is
some enjoyment then; one is let alone.But the instant you have a large
fortune, duties commence.And then impudent fellows borrow your money;
and if you ask them for it again, they go about town saying you are a
screw.'Lord Monmouth had died suddenly at his Richmond villa, which latterly
he never quitted, at a little supper, with no persons near him but those
who were amusing.He suddenly found he could not lift his glass to his
lips, and being extremely polite, waited a few minutes before he asked
Clotilde, who was singing a sparkling drinking-song, to do him that
service.When, in accordance with his request, she reached him, it was
too late.The ladies shrieked, being frightened: at first they were
in despair, but, after reflection, they evinced some intention of
plundering the house.Villebecque, who was absent at the moment, arrived
in time; and everybody became orderly and broken-hearted.The body had been removed to Monmouth House, where it had been embalmed
and laid in state.There was
nobody in town; some distinguished connections, however, came up from
the country, though it was a period inconvenient for such movements.After the funeral, the will was to be read in the principal saloon of
Monmouth House, one of those gorgeous apartments that had excited the
boyish wonder of Coningsby on his first visit to that paternal roof, and
now hung in black, adorned with the escutcheon of the deceased peer.The testamentary dispositions of the late lord were still unknown,
though the names of his executors had been announced by his family
solicitor, in whose custody the will and codicils had always remained.The executors under the will were Lord Eskdale, Mr.By a subsequent appointment Sidonia had been added.Coningsby, who had been chief mourner,
stood on the right hand of the solicitor, who sat at the end of a long
table, round which, in groups, were ranged all who had attended the
funeral, including several of the superior members of the household,
among them M. Villebecque.The solicitor rose and explained that though Lord Monmouth had been in
the habit of very frequently adding codicils to his will, the original
will, however changed or modified, had never been revoked; it was
therefore necessary to commence by reading that instrument.So saying,
he sat down, and breaking the seals of a large packet, he produced the
will of Philip Augustus, Marquess of Monmouth, which had been retained
in his custody since its execution.By this will, of the date of 1829, the sum of 10,000_l._ was left to
Coningsby, then unknown to his grandfather; the same sum to Mr.There was a great number of legacies, none of superior amount, most of
them of less: these were chiefly left to old male companions, and women
in various countries.There was an almost inconceivable number of small
annuities to faithful servants, decayed actors, and obscure foreigners.The residue of his personal estate was left to four gentlemen, three of
whom had quitted this world before the legator; the bequests, therefore,
had lapsed.The fourth residuary legatee, in whom, according to the
terms of the will, all would have consequently centred, was Mr.There followed several codicils which did not materially affect the
previous disposition; one of them leaving a legacy of 20,000_l._ to
the Princess Colonna; until they arrived at the latter part of the year
1832, when a codicil increased the 10,000_l._ left under the will to
Coningsby to 50,000_l._.After Coningsby's visit to the Castle in 1836 a very important change
occurred in the disposition of Lord Monmouth's estate.The legacy of
50,000_l._ in his favour was revoked, and the same sum left to the
Princess Lucretia.A similar amount was bequeathed to Mr.Rigby; and
Coningsby was left sole residuary legatee.An estate of about
nine thousand a year, which Lord Monmouth had himself purchased, and was
therefore in his own disposition, was left to Coningsby.Rigby was reduced to 20,000_l._, and the whole of his residue left
to his issue by Lady Monmouth.In case he died without issue, the estate
bequeathed to Coningsby to be taken into account, and the residue then
to be divided equally between Lady Monmouth and his grandson.It was
under this instrument that Sidonia had been appointed an executor and
to whom Lord Monmouth left, among others, the celebrated picture of
the Holy Family by Murillo, as his friend had often admired it.To Lord
Eskdale he left all his female miniatures, and to Mr.Ormsby his rare
and splendid collection of French novels, and all his wines, except his
Tokay, which he left, with his library, to Sir Robert Peel; though this
legacy was afterwards revoked, in consequence of Sir Robert's conduct
about the Irish corporations.The solicitor paused and begged permission to send for a glass of water.While this was arranging there was a murmur at the lower part of the
room, but little disposition to conversation among those in the vicinity
of the lawyer.Coningsby was silent, his brow a little knit.Rigby
was pale and restless, but said nothing.Ormsby took a pinch of
snuff, and offered his box to Lord Eskdale, who was next to him.They
exchanged glances, and made some observation about the weather.Sidonia
stood apart, with his arms folded.He had not, of course attended the
funeral, nor had he as yet exchanged any recognition with Coningsby.'Now, gentlemen,' said the solicitor, 'if you please, I will proceed.'They came to the year 1839, the year Coningsby was at Hellingsley.This
appeared to be a critical period in the fortunes of Lady Monmouth; while
Coningsby's reached to the culminating point.Rigby was reduced to
his original legacy under the will of 10,000_l._; a sum of equal amount
was bequeathed to Armand Villebecque, in acknowledgment of faithful
services; all the dispositions in favour of Lady Monmouth were revoked,
and she was limited to her moderate jointure of 3,000_l._ per annum,
under the marriage settlement; while everything, without reserve, was
left absolutely to Coningsby.A subsequent codicil determined that the 10,000_l._ left to Mr.Rigby
should be equally divided between him and Lucian Gay; but as some
compensation Lord Monmouth left to the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby
the bust of that gentleman, which he had himself presented to his
Lordship, and which, at his desire, had been placed in the vestibule
at Coningsby Castle, from the amiable motive that after Lord Monmouth's
decease Mr.Rigby might wish, perhaps, to present it to some other
friend.Ormsby took care not to catch the eye of Mr.As for Coningsby, he saw nobody.He maintained, during the extraordinary
situation in which he was placed, a firm demeanour; but serene and
regulated as he appeared to the spectators, his nerves were really
strung to a high pitch.It bore the date of June 1840, and was
made at Brighton, immediately after the separation with Lady Monmouth.It was the sight of this instrument that sustained Rigby at this great
emergency.He had a wild conviction that, after all, it must set all
right.He felt assured that, as Lady Monmouth had already been disposed
of, it must principally refer to the disinheritance of Coningsby,
secured by Rigby's well-timed and malignant misrepresentations of what
had occurred in Lancashire during the preceding summer.And then to whom
could Lord Monmouth leave his money?However he might cut and carve up
his fortunes, Rigby, and especially at a moment when he had so served
him, must come in for a considerable slice.All the dispositions in favour of'my
grandson Harry Coningsby' were revoked; and he inherited from his
grandfather only the interest of the sum of 10,000_l._ which had been
originally bequeathed to him in his orphan boyhood.The executors had
the power of investing the principal in any way they thought proper
for his advancement in life, provided always it was not placed in 'the
capital stock of any manufactory.'Coningsby turned pale; he lost his abstracted look; he caught the eye
of Rigby; he read the latent malice of that nevertheless anxious
countenance.What passed through the mind and being of Coningsby was
thought and sensation enough for a year; but it was as the flash that
reveals a whole country, yet ceases to be ere one can say it lightens.There was a revelation to him of an inward power that should baffle
these conventional calamities, a natural and sacred confidence in his
youth and health, and knowledge and convictions.Even the recollection
of Edith was not unaccompanied with some sustaining associations.At
least the mightiest foe to their union was departed.All this was the impression of an instant, simultaneous with the reading
of the words of form with which the last testamentary disposition of the
Marquess of Monmouth left the sum of 30,000_l._ to Armand Villebecque;
and all the rest, residue, and remainder of his unentailed property,
wheresoever and whatsoever it might be, amounting in value to nearly a
million sterling, was given, devised, and bequeathed to Flora, commonly
called Flora Villebecque, the step-child of the said Armand Villebecque,
'but who is my natural daughter by Marie Estelle Matteau, an actress at
the Theatre Francais in the years 1811-15, by the name of Stella.'said Coningsby, with a grave rather than agitated
countenance, to Sidonia, as his friend came up to greet him, without,
however, any expression of condolence.'This time next year you will not think so,' said Sidonia.'The principal annoyance of this sort of miscarriage,' said Sidonia,
'is the condolence of the gentle world.For the present we
will not speak of it.'So saying, Sidonia good-naturedly got Coningsby
out of the room.They walked together to Sidonia's house in Carlton Gardens, neither of
them making the slightest allusion to the catastrophe; Sidonia inquiring
where he had been, what he had been doing, since they last met, and
himself conversing in his usual vein, though with a little more feeling
in his manner than was his custom.When they had arrived there, Sidonia
ordered their dinner instantly, and during the interval between the
command and its appearance, he called Coningsby's attention to an old
German painting he had just received, its brilliant colouring and quaint
costumes.'Eat, and an appetite will come,' said Sidonia, when he observed
Coningsby somewhat reluctant.'Take some of that Chablis: it will put
you right; you will find it delicious.'In this way some twenty minutes passed; their meal was over, and they
were alone together.'I have been thinking all this time of your position,' said Sidonia.'A sorry one, I fear,' said Coningsby.'I really cannot see that,' said his friend.'You have experienced this
morning a disappointment, but not a calamity.If you had lost your eye
it would have been a calamity: no combination of circumstances could
have given you another.There are really no miseries except natural
miseries; conventional misfortunes are mere illusions.What seems
conventionally, in a limited view, a great misfortune, if subsequently
viewed in its results, is often the happiest incident in one's life.''I hope the day may come when I may feel this.''Now is the moment when philosophy is of use; that is to say, now is
the moment when you should clearly comprehend the circumstances which
surround you.You think, for
example, that you have just experienced a great calamity, because you
have lost the fortune on which you counted?''I ask you again, which would you have rather lost, your grandfather's
inheritance or your right leg?''Most certainly my inheritance,'

'Or your left arm?''Would you have received the inheritance on condition that your front
teeth should be knocked out?''Would you have given up a year of your life for that fortune trebled?''Even at twenty-three I would have refused the terms.''Come, come, Coningsby, the calamity cannot be very great.''Why, you have put it in an ingenious point of view; and yet it is
not so easy to convince a man, that he should be content who has lost
everything.''You have a great many things at this moment that you separately prefer
to the fortune that you have forfeited.How then can you be said to have
lost everything?''You have health, youth, good looks, great abilities, considerable
knowledge, a fine courage, a lofty spirit, and no contemptible
experience.With each of these qualities one might make a fortune; the
combination ought to command the highest.''You console me,' said Coningsby, with a faint blush and a fainter
smile.I think you are a most
fortunate young man; I should not have thought you more fortunate if
you had been your grandfather's heir; perhaps less so.But I wish you
to comprehend your position: if you understand it you will cease to
lament.''Bring your intelligence to bear on the right object.I make you no
offers of fortune, because I know you would not accept them, and indeed
I have no wish to see you a lounger in life.If you had inherited a
great patrimony, it is possible your natural character and previous
culture might have saved you from its paralysing influence; but it is a
question, even with you.Now you are free; that is to say, you are free,
if you are not in debt.A man who has not seen the world, whose fancy is
harassed with glittering images of pleasures he has never experienced,
cannot live on 300_l._ per annum; but you can.You have nothing to haunt
your thoughts, or disturb the abstraction of your studies.You have seen
the most beautiful women; you have banqueted in palaces; you know what
heroes, and wits, and statesmen are made of: and you can draw on
your memory instead of your imagination for all those dazzling and
interesting objects that make the inexperienced restless, and are the
cause of what are called scrapes.But you can do nothing if you be in
debt.Before, therefore, we proceed, I must beg you
to be frank on this head.If you have any absolute or contingent
incumbrances, tell me of them without reserve, and permit me to clear
them at once to any amount.You will sensibly oblige me in so doing:
because I am interested in watching your career, and if the racer start
with a clog my psychological observations will be imperfect.''You are, indeed, a friend; and had I debts I would ask you to pay
them.My grandfather was so lavish in his
allowance to me that I never got into difficulties.Besides, there
are horses and things without end which I must sell, and money at
Drummonds'.''That will produce your outfit, whatever the course you adopt.I
conceive there are two careers which deserve your consideration.In the
first place there is Diplomacy.If you decide upon that, I can assist
you.There exist between me and the Minister such relations that I can
at once secure you that first step which is so difficult to obtain.After that, much, if not all, depends on yourself.But I could advance
you, provided you were capable.You should, at least, not languish for
want of preferment.In an important post, I could throw in your way
advantages which would soon permit you to control cabinets.I doubt not your success, and for such a career,
speedy.Suppose
yourself in a dozen years a Plenipotentiary at a chief court, or at
a critical post, with a red ribbon and the Privy Council in immediate
perspective; and, after a lengthened career, a pension and a peerage.A Diplomatist is, after all,
a phantom.There is a want of nationality about his being.I always look
upon Diplomatists as the Hebrews of politics; without country, political
creeds, popular convictions, that strong reality of existence which
pervades the career of an eminent citizen in a free and great country.''You read my thoughts,' said Coningsby.'I should be sorry to sever
myself from England.''There remains then the other, the greater, the nobler career,' said
Sidonia, 'which in England may give you all, the Bar.I am absolutely
persuaded that with the requisite qualifications, and with perseverance,
success at the Bar is certain.It may be retarded or precipitated by
circumstances, but cannot be ultimately affected.You have a right to
count with your friends on no lack of opportunities when you are ripe
for them.You appear to me to have all the qualities necessary for the
Bar; and you may count on that perseverance which is indispensable, for
the reason I have before mentioned, because it will be sustained by your
experience.''I have resolved,' said Coningsby; 'I will try for the Great Seal.'Alone in his chambers, no longer under the sustaining influence of
Sidonia's converse and counsel, the shades of night descending
and bearing gloom to the gloomy, all the excitement of his spirit
evaporated, the heart of Coningsby sank.All now depended on himself,
and in that self he had no trust.And even success
could only be conducted to him by the course of many years.His career,
even if prosperous, was now to commence by the greatest sacrifice which
the heart of man could be called upon to sustain.Upon the stern altar
of his fortunes he must immolate his first and enduring love.Before,
he had a perilous position to offer Edith; now he had none.The future
might then have aided them; there was no combination which could improve
his present.Under any circumstances he must, after all his thoughts and
studies, commence a new novitiate, and before he could enter the arena
must pass years of silent and obscure preparation.He looked up, his eye caught that drawing of the towers of Hellingsley
which she had given him in the days of their happy hearts.That was all
that was to remain of their loves.He was to bear it to the future
scene of his labours, to remind him through revolving years of toil and
routine, that he too had had his romance, had roamed in fair gardens,
and whispered in willing ears the secrets of his passion.That drawing
was to become the altar-piece of his life.Coningsby passed an agitated night of broken sleep, waking often with a
consciousness of having experienced some great misfortune, yet with an
indefinite conception of its nature.It was a gloomy day, a raw north-easter blowing up the cloisters of
the Albany, in which the fog was lingering, the newspaper on his
breakfast-table, full of rumoured particulars of his grandfather's
will, which had of course been duly digested by all who knew him.To the bright, bracing morn of that merry
Christmas!That radiant and cheerful scene, and those gracious and
beaming personages, seemed another world and order of beings to the
one he now inhabited, and the people with whom he must now commune.It was the wild excitement of despair, the frenzied
hope that blends inevitably with absolute ruin, that could alone have
inspired such a hallucination!His
energies could rally no more.He gave orders that he was at home to no
one; and in his morning gown and slippers, with his feet resting on the
fireplace, the once high-souled and noble-hearted Coningsby delivered
himself up to despair.The day passed in a dark trance rather than a reverie.He was like a particle of chaos; at the best,
a glimmering entity of some shadowy Hades.Towards evening the wind
changed, the fog dispersed, there came a clear starry night, brisk and
bright.Coningsby roused himself, dressed, and wrapping his cloak around
him, sallied forth.Once more in the mighty streets, surrounded by
millions, his petty griefs and personal fortunes assumed their proper
position.Well had Sidonia taught him, view everything in its relation
to the rest.Here was the mightiest of
modern cities; the rival even of the most celebrated of the ancient.Whether he inherited or forfeited fortunes, what was it to the passing
throng?They would not share his splendour, or his luxury, or his
comfort.But a word from his lip, a thought from his brain, expressed
at the right time, at the right place, might turn their hearts, might
influence their passions, might change their opinions, might affect
their destiny.As civilisation
advances, the accidents of life become each day less important.The power of man, his greatness and his glory, depend on essential
qualities.Brains every day become more precious than blood.You must
give men new ideas, you must teach them new words, you must modify
their manners, you must change their laws, you must root out prejudices,
subvert convictions, if you wish to be great.Greatness no longer
depends on rentals, the world is too rich; nor on pedigrees, the world
is too knowing.'The greatness of this city destroys my misery,' said Coningsby, 'and my
genius shall conquer its greatness.'This conviction of power in the midst of despair was a revelation of
intrinsic strength.It is indeed the test of a creative spirit.From
that moment all petty fears for an ordinary future quitted him.He felt
that he must be prepared for great sacrifices, for infinite suffering;
that there must devolve on him a bitter inheritance of obscurity,
struggle, envy, and hatred, vulgar prejudice, base criticism, petty
hostilities, but the dawn would break, and the hour arrive, when the
welcome morning hymn of his success and his fame would sound and be
re-echoed.He returned to his rooms; calm, resolute.He slept the deep sleep of
a man void of anxiety, that has neither hope nor fear to haunt his
visions, but is prepared to rise on the morrow collected for the great
human struggle.Fresh, vigorous, not rash or precipitate, yet
determined to lose no time in idle meditation, Coningsby already
resolved at once to quit his present residence, was projecting a visit
to some legal quarter, where he intended in future to reside, when his
servant brought him a note.Coningsby, with
great earnestness, to do her the honour and the kindness of calling on
her at his earliest convenience, at the hotel in Brook Street where she
now resided.It was an interview which Coningsby would rather have avoided; yet it
seemed to him, after a moment's reflection, neither just, nor kind, nor
manly, to refuse her request.She was, after
all, his kin.Was it for a moment to be supposed that he was envious of
her lot?He replied, therefore, that in an hour he would wait upon her.In an hour, then, two individuals are to be brought together whose first
meeting was held under circumstances most strangely different.Then
Coningsby was the patron, a generous and spontaneous one, of a being
obscure, almost friendless, and sinking under bitter mortification.His favour could not be the less appreciated because he was the
chosen relative of a powerful noble.That noble was no more; his vast
inheritance had devolved on the disregarded, even despised actress,
whose suffering emotions Coningsby had then soothed, and whose fortune
had risen on the destruction of all his prospects, and the balk of all
his aspirations.Flora was alone when Coningsby was ushered into the room.The extreme
delicacy of her appearance was increased by her deep mourning; and
seated in a cushioned chair, from which she seemed to rise with an
effort, she certainly presented little of the character of a fortunate
and prosperous heiress.'You are very good to come to me,' she said, faintly smiling.Coningsby extended his hand to her affectionately, in which she placed
her own, looking down much embarrassed.'You have an agreeable situation here,' said Coningsby, trying to break
the first awkwardness of their meeting.'Yes; but I hope not to stop here long?''No; I hope never to leave England!'There was a slight pause; and then Flora sighed and said,

'I wish to speak to you on a subject that gives me pain; yet of which I
must speak.'I am sure,' said Coningsby, in a tone of great kindness, 'that you
could injure no one.''It was not mine by any right, legal or moral.There were others who
might have urged an equal claim to it; and there are many who will now
think that you might have preferred a superior one.''You had enemies; I was not one.They sought to benefit themselves by
injuring you.They have not benefited themselves; let them not say that
they have at least injured you.''We will not care what they say,' said Coningsby; 'I can sustain my
lot.'She sighed again with a downcast
glance.Then looking up embarrassed and blushing deeply, she added, 'I
wish to restore to you that fortune of which I have unconsciously and
unwillingly deprived you.''The fortune is yours, dear Flora, by every right,' said Coningsby,
much moved; 'and there is no one who wishes more fervently that it may
contribute to your happiness than I do.''It is killing me,' said Flora, mournfully; then speaking with unusual
animation, with a degree of excitement, she continued, 'I must tell what
I feel.I am happy in the inheritance, if you
generously receive it from me, because Providence has made me the means
of baffling your enemies.I never thought to be so happy as I shall be
if you will generously accept this fortune, always intended for you.I
have lived then for a purpose; I have not lived in vain; I have returned
to you some service, however humble, for all your goodness to me in my
unhappiness.''You are, as I have ever thought you, the kindest and most
tender-hearted of beings.But you misconceive our mutual positions,
my gentle Flora.The custom of the world does not permit such acts to
either of us as you contemplate.It is left you by
one on whose affections you had the highest claim.I will not say
that so large an inheritance does not bring with it an alarming
responsibility; but you are not unequal to it.You have a good heart; you have good sense; you have a
well-principled being.Your spirit will mount with your fortunes, and
blend with them.'I shall soon learn to find content, if not happiness, from other
sources,' said Coningsby; 'and mere riches, however vast, could at no
time have secured my felicity.''But they may secure that which brings felicity,' said Flora, speaking
in a choking voice, and not meeting the glance of Coningsby.'You had
some views in life which displeased him who has done all this; they may
be, they must be, affected by this fatal caprice.Speak to me, for I
cannot speak, dear Mr.Coningsby; do not let me believe that I, who
would sacrifice my life for your happiness, am the cause of such
calamities!''Whatever be my lot, I repeat I can sustain it,' said Coningsby, with a
cheek of scarlet.he is angry with me,' exclaimed Flora; 'he is angry with me!'and
the tears stole down her pale cheek.dear Flora; I have no other feelings to you than those of
affection and respect,' and Coningsby, much agitated, drew his chair
nearer to her, and took her hand.'I am gratified by these kind wishes,
though they are utterly impracticable; but they are the witnesses of
your sweet disposition and your noble spirit.There never shall exist
between us, under any circumstances, other feelings than those of kin
and kindness.'When she saw that, she started, and seemed to
summon all her energies.'You are going,' she exclaimed, 'and I have said nothing, I have said
nothing; and I shall never see you again.This fortune is yours; it must be yours.Do
not think I am speaking from a momentary impulse.I have
lived so much alone, I have had so little to deceive or to delude me,
that I know myself.If you will not let me do justice you declare my
doom.I cannot live if my existence is the cause of all your prospects
being blasted, and the sweetest dreams of your life being defeated.When
I die, these riches will be yours; that you cannot prevent.Refuse my
present offer, and you seal the fate of that unhappy Flora whose fragile
life has hung for years on the memory of your kindness.''You must not say these words, dear Flora; you must not indulge in these
gloomy feelings.You must live, and you must live happily.You have
every charm and virtue which should secure happiness.The duties and
the affections of existence will fall to your lot.It is one that will
always interest me, for I shall ever be your friend.You have conferred
on me one of the most delightful of feelings, gratitude, and for that I
bless you.CHAPTER V.


About a week after this interview with Flora, as Coningsby one morning
was about to sally forth from the Albany to visit some chambers in the
Temple, to which his notice had been attracted, there was a loud ring, a
bustle in the hall, and Henry Sydney and Buckhurst were ushered in.There never was such a cordial meeting; and yet the faces of his
friends were serious.The truth is, the paragraphs in the newspapers had
circulated in the country, they had written to Coningsby, and after a
brief delay he had confirmed their worst apprehensions.Immediately they
came up to town.Henry Sydney, a younger son, could offer little but
sympathy, but he declared it was his intention also to study for the
bar, so that they should not be divided.Buckhurst, after many embraces
and some ordinary talk, took Coningsby aside, and said, 'My dear fellow,
I have no objection to Henry Sydney hearing everything I say, but still
these are subjects which men like to be discussed in private.Of course
I expect you to share my fortune.There was something in Buckhurst's fervent resolution very lovable and a
little humorous, just enough to put one in good temper with human nature
and life.If there were any fellow's fortune in the world that Coningsby
would share, Buckhurst's would have had the preference; but while he
pressed his hand, and with a glance in which a tear and a smile seemed
to contend for mastery, he gently indicated why such arrangements were,
with our present manners, impossible.'I see,' said Buckhurst, after a moment's thought, 'I quite agree with
you.The thing cannot be done; and, to tell you the truth, a fortune
is a bore.What I vote that we three do at once is, to take plenty of
ready-money, and enter the Austrian service.'There is something in that,' said Coningsby.'In the meantime, suppose
you two fellows walk with me to the Temple, for I have an appointment to
look at some chambers.'It was a fine day, and it was by no means a gloomy walk.Though the
two friends had arrived full of indignation against Lord Monmouth, and
miserable about their companion, once more in his society, and finding
little difference in his carriage, they assumed unconsciously their
habitual tone.As for Buckhurst, he was delighted with the Temple, which
he visited for the first time.The tombs in the
church convinced him that the Crusades were the only career.He would
have himself become a law student if he might have prosecuted his
studies in chain armour.The calmer Henry Sydney was consoled for the
misfortunes of Coningsby by a fanciful project himself to pass a portion
of his life amid these halls and courts, gardens and terraces, that
maintain in the heart of a great city in the nineteenth century, so much
of the grave romance and picturesque decorum of our past manners.Henry Sydney was sanguine; he was reconciled to the disinheritance of
Coningsby by the conviction that it was a providential dispensation to
make him a Lord Chancellor.These faithful friends remained in town with Coningsby until he was
established in Paper Buildings, and had become a pupil of a celebrated
special pleader.They would have remained longer had not he himself
suggested that it was better that they should part.It seemed a terrible
catastrophe after all the visions of their boyish days, their college
dreams, and their dazzling adventures in the world.'And this is the end of Coningsby, the brilliant Coningsby, that we all
loved, that was to be our leader!'said Buckhurst to Lord Henry as
they quitted him.'Well, come what may, life has lost something of its
bloom.''The great thing now,' said Lord Henry, 'is to keep up the chain of
our friendship.Sandra went to the hallway.We must write to him very often, and contrive to be
frequently together.It is dreadful to think that in the ways of life
our hearts may become estranged.I never felt more wretched than I do at
this moment, and yet I have faith that we shall not lose him.'said Buckhurst; 'but I feel my plan about the Austrian service
was, after all, the only thing.He might
have been prime minister; several strangers have been; and as for war,
look at Brown and Laudohn, and half a hundred others.I had a much
better chance of being a field-marshal than he has of being a Lord
Chancellor.''I feel quite convinced that Coningsby will be Lord Chancellor,' said
Henry Sydney, gravely.This change of life for Coningsby was a great social revolution.Within a month after the death of his grandfather
his name had been erased from all his fashionable clubs, and his horses
and carriages sold, and he had become a student of the Temple.He
entirely devoted himself to his new pursuit.His being was completely
absorbed in it.There was nothing to haunt his mind; no unexperienced
scene or sensation of life to distract his intelligence.One sacred
thought alone indeed there remained, shrined in the innermost sanctuary
of his heart and consciousness.But it was a tradition, no longer a
hope.The moment that he had fairly recovered from the first shock of
his grandfather's will; had clearly ascertained the consequences to
himself, and had resolved on the course to pursue; he had communicated
unreservedly with Oswald Millbank, and had renounced those pretensions
to the hand of his sister which it ill became the destitute to prefer.Millbank met Henry Sydney and
Buckhurst at the chambers of Coningsby.Once more they were all
four together; but under what different circumstances, and with what
different prospects from those which attended their separation at Eton!Alone with Coningsby, Millbank spoke to him things which letters could
not convey.He bore to him all the sympathy and devotion of Edith; but
they would not conceal from themselves that, at this moment, and in the
present state of affairs, all was hopeless.In no way did Coningsby ever
permit himself to intimate to Oswald the cause of his disinheritance.He
was, of course, silent on it to his other friends; as any communication
of the kind must have touched on a subject that was consecrated in his
inmost soul.The state of political parties in England in the spring of 1841 offered
a most remarkable contrast to their condition at the period commemorated
in the first chapter of this work.The banners of the Conservative camp
at this moment lowered on the Whig forces, as the gathering host of the
Norman invader frowned on the coast of Sussex.The Whigs were not
yet conquered, but they were doomed; and they themselves knew it.The
mistake which was made by the Conservative leaders in not retaining
office in 1839; and, whether we consider their conduct in a national
and constitutional light, or as a mere question of political tactics and
party prudence, it was unquestionably a great mistake; had infused into
the corps of Whig authority a kind of galvanic action, which only the
superficial could mistake for vitality.Even to form a basis for their
future operations, after the conjuncture of '39, the Whigs were obliged
to make a fresh inroad on the revenue, the daily increasing debility
of which was now arresting attention and exciting public alarm.It was
clear that the catastrophe of the government would be financial.Under all the circumstances of the case, the conduct of the Whig
Cabinet, in their final propositions, cannot be described as deficient
either in boldness or prudence.The policy which they recommended was
in itself a sagacious and spirited policy; but they erred in supposing
that, at the period it was brought forward, any measure promoted by the
Whigs could have obtained general favour in the country.The Whigs were
known to be feeble; they were looked upon as tricksters.The country
knew they were opposed by a powerful party; and though there certainly
never was any authority for the belief, the country did believe that
that powerful party were influenced by great principles; had in their
view a definite and national policy; and would secure to England,
instead of a feeble administration and fluctuating opinions, energy and
a creed.The future effect of the Whig propositions of '41 will not be
detrimental to that party, even if in the interval they be appropriated
piecemeal, as will probably be the case, by their Conservative
successors.But for the moment, and in the plight in which the Whig
party found themselves, it was impossible to have devised measures more
conducive to their precipitate fall.Great interests were menaced by a
weak government.Tadpole and Taper
saw it in a moment.They snuffed the factious air, and felt the coming
storm.Notwithstanding the extreme congeniality of these worthies,
there was a little latent jealousy between them.Tadpole worshipped
Registration: Taper, adored a Cry.Tadpole always maintained that it
was the winnowing of the electoral lists that could alone gain the day;
Taper, on the contrary, faithful to ancient traditions, was ever of
opinion that the game must ultimately be won by popular clamour.It
always seemed so impossible that the Conservative party could ever be
popular; the extreme graciousness and personal popularity of the leaders
not being sufficiently apparent to be esteemed an adequate set-off
against the inveterate odium that attached to their opinions; that the
Tadpole philosophy was the favoured tenet in high places; and Taper had
had his knuckles well rapped more than once for manoeuvring too actively
against the New Poor-law, and for hiring several link-boys to bawl
a much-wronged lady's name in the Park when the Court prorogued
Parliament.And now, after all, in 1841, it seemed that Taper was right.There was
a great clamour in every quarter, and the clamour was against the Whigs
and in favour of Conservative principles.What Canadian timber-merchants
meant by Conservative principles, it is not difficult to conjecture;
or West Indian planters.It was tolerably clear on the hustings
what squires and farmers, and their followers, meant by Conservative
principles.What they mean by Conservative principles now is another
question: and whether Conservative principles mean something higher than
a perpetuation of fiscal arrangements, some of them impolitic, none of
them important.But no matter what different bodies of men understood by
the cry in which they all joined, the Cry existed.Taper beat Tadpole;
and the great Conservative party beat the shattered and exhausted Whigs.Notwithstanding the abstraction of his legal studies, Coningsby could
not be altogether insensible to the political crisis.In the political
world of course he never mixed, but the friends of his boyhood were
deeply interested in affairs, and they lost no opportunity which
he would permit them, of cultivating his society.Their occasional
fellowship, a visit now and then to Sidonia, and a call sometimes
on Flora, who lived at Richmond, comprised his social relations.His
general acquaintance did not desert him, but he was out of sight, and
did not wish to be remembered.Ormsby asked him to dinner, and
occasionally mourned over his fate in the bow window of White's; while
Lord Eskdale even went to see him in the Temple, was interested in his
progress, and said, with an encouraging look, that, when he was called
to the bar, all his friends must join and get up the steam.Rigby, who was walking with the Duke of Agincourt,
which was probably the reason he could not notice a lawyer.Lord Eskdale had obtained from Villebecque accurate details as to the
cause of Coningsby being disinherited.Our hero, if one in such fallen
fortunes may still be described as a hero, had mentioned to Lord Eskdale
his sorrow that his grandfather had died in anger with him; but Lord
Eskdale, without dwelling on the subject, had assured him that he had
reason to believe that if Lord Monmouth had lived, affairs would have
been different.He had altered the disposition of his property at a
moment of great and general irritation and excitement; and had been too
indolent, perhaps really too indisposed, which he was unwilling ever to
acknowledge, to recur to a calmer and more equitable settlement.Lord
Eskdale had been more frank with Sidonia, and had told him all about
the refusal to become a candidate for Darlford against Mr.Millbank; the
communication of Rigby to Lord Monmouth, as to the presence of Oswald
Millbank at the castle, and the love of Coningsby for his sister; all
these details, furnished by Villebecque to Lord Eskdale, had been truly
transferred by that nobleman to his co-executor; and Sidonia, when he
had sufficiently digested them, had made Lady Wallinger acquainted with
the whole history.The dissolution of the Whig Parliament by the Whigs, the project of
which had reached Lord Monmouth a year before, and yet in which nobody
believed to the last moment, at length took place.All the world was
dispersed in the heart of the season, and our solitary student of the
Temple, in his lonely chambers, notwithstanding all his efforts, found
his eye rather wander over the pages of Tidd and Chitty as he remembered
that the great event to which he had so looked forward was now
occurring, and he, after all, was no actor in the mighty drama.It was
to have been the epoch of his life; when he was to have found himself
in that proud position for which all the studies, and meditations, and
higher impulses of his nature had been preparing him.It was a keen
trial of a man.Every one of his friends and old companions were
candidates, and with sanguine prospects.Lord Henry was certain for a
division of his county; Buckhurst harangued a large agricultural
borough in his vicinity; Eustace Lyle and Vere stood in coalition for
a Yorkshire town; and Oswald Millbank solicited the suffrages of an
important manufacturing constituency.They sent their addresses to
Coningsby.He was deeply interested as he traced in them the influence
of his own mind; often recognised the very expressions to which he
had habituated them.Amid the confusion of a general election, no
unimpassioned critic had time to canvass the language of an address to
an isolated constituency; yet an intelligent speculator on the movements
of political parties might have detected in these public declarations
some intimation of new views, and of a tone of political feeling that
has unfortunately been too long absent from the public life of this
country.It was the end of a sultry July day, the last ray of the sun shooting
down Pall Mall sweltering with dust; there was a crowd round the doors
of the Carlton and the Reform Clubs, and every now and then an express
arrived with the agitating bulletin of a fresh defeat or a new triumph.He was going to dine at the Oxford
and Cambridge Club, the only club on whose list he had retained his
name, that he might occasionally have the pleasure of meeting an Eton or
Cambridge friend without the annoyance of encountering any of his former
fashionable acquaintances.The latter did not notice him, but Mr.Tadpole, more good-natured, bestowed on him a rough nod, not unmarked by
a slight expression of coarse pity.Coningsby ordered his dinner, and then took up the evening papers, where
he learnt the return of Vere and Lyle; and read a speech of Buckhurst
denouncing the Venetian Constitution, to the amazement of several
thousand persons, apparently not a little terrified by this unknown
danger, now first introduced to their notice.Being true Englishmen,
they were all against Buckhurst's opponent, who was of the Venetian
party, and who ended by calling out Buckhurst for his personalities.Coningsby had dined, and was reading in the library, when a waiter
brought up a third edition of the _Sun_, with electioneering bulletins
from the manufacturing districts to the very latest hour.Some large
letters which expressed the name of Darlford caught his eye.There
seemed great excitement in that borough; strange proceedings had
happened.The column was headed, 'Extraordinary Affair!His eye glanced over an animated speech of Mr.Millbank, his
countenance changed, his heart palpitated.Millbank had resigned
the representation of the town, but not from weakness; his avocations
demanded his presence; he had been requested to let his son supply his
place, but his son was otherwise provided for; he should always take a
deep interest in the town and trade of Darlford; he hoped that the
link between the borough and Hellingsley would be ever cherished; loud
cheering; he wished in parting from them to take a step which should
conciliate all parties, put an end to local heats and factious
contentions, and secure the town an able and worthy representative.For
these reasons he begged to propose to them a gentleman who bore a
name which many of them greatly honoured; for himself, he knew the
individual, and it was his firm opinion that whether they considered his
talents, his character, or the ancient connection of his family with
the district, he could not propose a candidate more worthy of their
confidence than HARRY CONINGSBY, ESQ.This proposition was received with that wild enthusiasm which
occasionally bursts out in the most civilised communities.The contest
between Millbank and Rigby was equally balanced, neither party was
over-confident.The Conservatives were not particularly zealous in
behalf of their champion; there was no Marquess of Monmouth and no
Coningsby Castle now to back him; he was fighting on his own resources,
and he was a beaten horse.The Liberals did not like the prospect of a
defeat, and dreaded the mortification of Rigby's triumph.The Moderate
men, who thought more of local than political circumstances, liked the
name of Coningsby.Millbank had dexterously prepared his leading
supporters for the substitution.Some traits of the character and
conduct of Coningsby had been cleverly circulated.Thus there was a
combination of many favourable causes in his favour.In half an hour's
time his image was stamped on the brain of every inhabitant of the
borough as an interesting and accomplished youth, who had been wronged,
and who deserved to be rewarded.It was whispered that Rigby was his
enemy.Rigby into the river, or to burn down his hotel, in case he was
prudent enough not to show.Rigby determined to fight to the last.All his hopes were now staked on the successful result of this contest.It were impossible if he were returned that his friends could refuse him
high office.The whole of Lord Monmouth's reduced legacy was devoted
to this end.The third edition of the _Sun_ left Mr.Rigby in vain
attempting to address an infuriated populace.Here was a revolution in the fortunes of our forlorn Coningsby!When his
grandfather first sent for him to Monmouth House, his destiny was
not verging on greater vicissitudes.He rose from his seat, and was
surprised that all the silent gentlemen who were about him did not mark
his agitation.It was now an hour
to midnight, and to-morrow the almost unconscious candidate was to go to
the poll.In a tumult of suppressed emotion, Coningsby returned to his
chambers.He found a letter in his box from Oswald Millbank, who had
been twice at the Temple.Oswald had been returned without a contest,
and had reached Darlford in time to hear Coningsby nominated.He set off
instantly to London, and left at his friend's chambers a rapid narrative
of what had happened, with information that he should call on him
again on the morrow at nine o'clock, when they were to repair together
immediately to Darlford in time for Coningsby to be chaired, for no one
entertained a doubt of his triumph.Coningsby did not sleep a wink that night, and yet when he rose early
felt fresh enough for any exploit, however difficult or hazardous.He
felt as an Egyptian does when the Nile rises after its elevation had
been despaired of.At the very lowest ebb of his fortunes, an event
had occurred which seemed to restore all.He dared not contemplate the
ultimate result of all these wonderful changes.Enough for him, that
when all seemed dark, he was about to be returned to Parliament by
the father of Edith, and his vanquished rival who was to bite the dust
before him was the author of all his misfortunes.Love, Vengeance,
Justice, the glorious pride of having acted rightly, the triumphant
sense of complete and absolute success, here were chaotic materials from
which order was at length evolved; and all subsided in an overwhelming
feeling of gratitude to that Providence that had so signally protected
him.It seemed
that Oswald was as excited as Coningsby.His eye sparkled, his manner
was energetic.'We must talk it all over during our journey.We have not a minute to
spare.'During that journey Coningsby learned something of the course of affairs
which gradually had brought about so singular a revolution in his
favour.We mentioned that Sidonia had acquired a thorough knowledge of
the circumstances which had occasioned and attended the disinheritance
of Coningsby.These he had told to Lady Wallinger, first by letter,
afterwards in more detail on her arrival in London.Lady Wallinger had
conferred with her husband.She was not surprised at the goodness of
Coningsby, and she sympathised with all his calamities.He had ever been
the favourite of her judgment, and her romance had always consisted in
blending his destinies with those of her beloved Edith.Sir Joseph was a
judicious man, who never cared to commit himself; a little selfish, but
good, just, and honourable, with some impulses, only a little afraid
of them; but then his wife stepped in like an angel, and gave them the
right direction.They were both absolutely impressed with Coningsby's
admirable conduct, and Lady Wallinger was determined that her husband
should express to others the convictions which he acknowledged in unison
with herself.Millbank, who stared; but Sir
Joseph spoke feebly.Lady Wallinger conveyed all this intelligence, and
all her impressions, to Oswald and Edith.The younger Millbank talked
with his father, who, making no admissions, listened with interest,
inveighed against Lord Monmouth, and condemned his will.Millbank made inquiries about Coningsby, took an
interest in his career, and, like Lord Eskdale, declared that when he
was called to the bar, his friends would have an opportunity to evince
their sincerity.Affairs remained in this state, until Oswald thought
that circumstances were sufficiently ripe to urge his father on
the subject.The position which Oswald had assumed at Millbank had
necessarily made him acquainted with the affairs and fortune of his
father.When he computed the vast wealth which he knew was at his
parent's command, and recalled Coningsby in his humble chambers, toiling
after all his noble efforts without any results, and his sister pining
in a provincial solitude, Oswald began to curse wealth, and to
ask himself what was the use of all their marvellous industry and
supernatural skill?He addressed his father with that irresistible
frankness which a strong faith can alone inspire.What are the objects
of wealth, if not to bless those who possess our hearts?The only
daughter, the friend to whom the only son was indebted for his life,
here are two beings surely whom one would care to bless, and both are
unhappy.Millbank listened without prejudice, for he was already
convinced.But he felt some interest in the present conduct of
Coningsby.A Coningsby working for his bread was a novel incident for
him.He was resolved to
convince himself of the fact.And perhaps he would have gone on yet
for a little time, and watched the progress of the experiment,
already interested and delighted by what had reached him, had not the
dissolution brought affairs to a crisis.The misery of Oswald at the
position of Coningsby, the silent sadness of Edith, his own conviction,
which assured him that he could do nothing wiser or better than take
this young man to his heart, so ordained it that Mr.Millbank, who
was after all the creature of impulse, decided suddenly, and decided
rightly.Never making a single admission to all the representations of
his son, Mr.Millbank in a moment did all that his son could have dared
to desire.This is a very imperfect and crude intimation of what had occurred
at Millbank and Hellingsley; yet it conveys a faint sketch of the
enchanting intelligence that Oswald conveyed to Coningsby during their
rapid travel.When they arrived at Birmingham, they found a messenger
and a despatch, informing Coningsby, that at mid-day, at Darlford, he
was at the head of the poll by an overwhelming majority, and that Mr.He was, however, requested to remain at Birmingham,
as they did not wish him to enter Darlford, except to be chaired, so
he was to arrive there in the morning.At Birmingham, therefore, they
remained.There was Oswald's election to talk of as well as Coningsby's.They had
hardly had time for this.Men must have been at school together, to enjoy the real fun of meeting
thus, and realising boyish dreams.Often, years ago, they had talked
of these things, and assumed these results; but those were words and
dreams, these were positive facts; after some doubts and struggles, in
the freshness of their youth, Oswald Millbank and Harry Coningsby
were members of the British Parliament; public characters, responsible
agents, with a career.This afternoon, at Birmingham, was as happy an afternoon as usually
falls to the lot of man.Both of these companions were labouring under
that degree of excitement which is necessary to felicity.Edith was no longer a forbidden or a sorrowful
subject.There was rapture in their again meeting under such
circumstances.Then there were their friends; that dear Buckhurst, who
had just been called out for styling his opponent a Venetian, and all
their companions of early days.What a sudden and marvellous change in
all their destinies!Life was a pantomime; the wand was waved, and it
seemed that the schoolfellows had of a sudden become elements of power,
springs of the great machine.A train arrived; restless they sallied forth, to seek diversion in the
dispersion of the passengers.Coningsby and Millbank, with that glance,
a little inquisitive, even impertinent, if we must confess it, with
which one greets a stranger when he emerges from a public conveyance,
were lounging on the platform.The train arrived; stopped; the doors
were thrown open, and from one of them emerged Mr.Coningsby, who
had dined, was greatly tempted to take off his hat and make him a bow,
but he refrained.He was evidently
used up; a man without a resource; the sight of Coningsby his last blow;
he had met his fate.'My dear fellow,' said Coningsby, 'I remember I wanted you to dine with
my grandfather at Montem, and that fellow would not ask you.About eleven o'clock the next morning they arrived at the Darlford
station.Here they were met by an anxious deputation, who received
Coningsby as if he were a prophet, and ushered him into a car covered
with satin and blue ribbons, and drawn by six beautiful grey horses,
caparisoned in his colours, and riden by postilions, whose very whips
were blue and white.Triumphant music sounded; banners waved; the
multitude were marshalled; the Freemasons, at the first opportunity,
fell into the procession; the Odd Fellows joined it at the nearest
corner.Preceded and followed by thousands, with colours flying,
trumpets sounding, and endless huzzas, flags and handkerchiefs waving
from every window, and every balcony filled with dames and maidens
bedecked with his colours, Coningsby was borne through enthusiastic
Darlford like Paulus Emilius returning from Macedon.Uncovered, still
in deep mourning, his fine figure, and graceful bearing, and his
intelligent brow, at once won every female heart.The singularity was, that all were of the same opinion: everybody
cheered him, every house was adorned with his colours.His triumphal
return was no party question.Magog Wrath and Bully Bluck walked
together like lambs at the head of his procession.The car stopped before the principal hotel in the High Street.The broad street was so crowded, that, as
every one declared, you might have walked on the heads of the people.Every window was full; the very roofs were peopled.The car stopped,
and the populace gave three cheers for Mr.Their late member,
surrounded by his friends, stood in the balcony, which was fitted up
with Coningsby's colours, and bore his name on the hangings in gigantic
letters formed of dahlias.The flashing and inquiring eye of Coningsby
caught the form of Edith, who was leaning on her father's arm.The hustings were opposite the hotel, and here, after a while, Coningsby
was carried, and, stepping from his car, took up his post to address,
for the first time, a public assembly.Anxious as the people were
to hear him, it was long before their enthusiasm could subside into
silence.He spoke; his
powerful and rich tones reached every ear.In five minutes' time every
one looked at his neighbour, and without speaking they agreed that there
never was anything like this heard in Darlford before.He addressed them for a considerable time, for he had a great deal to
say; not only to express his gratitude for the unprecedented manner in
which he had become their representative, and for the spirit in which
they had greeted him, but he had to offer them no niggard exposition
of the views and opinions of the member whom they had so confidingly
chosen, without even a formal declaration of his sentiments.He did this with so much clearness, and in a manner so pointed and
popular, that the deep attention of the multitude never wavered.His
lively illustrations kept them often in continued merriment.But when,
towards his close, he drew some picture of what he hoped might be the
character of his future and lasting connection with the town, the vast
throng was singularly affected.There were a great many present at that
moment who, though they had never seen Coningsby before, would willingly
have then died for him.Coningsby had touched their hearts, for he had
spoken from his own.Darlford
believed in Coningsby: and a very good creed.And now Coningsby was conducted to the opposite hotel.The progress was slow, as every one wished to shake hands
with him.His friends, however, at last safely landed him.He sprang
up the stairs; he was met by Mr.Millbank, who welcomed him with the
greatest warmth, and offered his hearty congratulations.'It is to you, dear sir, that I am indebted for all this,' said
Coningsby.Millbank, 'it is to your own high principles, great
talents, and good heart.'After he had been presented by the late member to the principal
personages in the borough, Mr.Millbank said,

'I think we must now give Mr.Come with me,' he
added, 'here is some one who will be very glad to see you.'Speaking thus, he led our hero a little away, and placing his arm in
Coningsby's with great affection opened the door of an apartment.There
was Edith, radiant with loveliness and beaming with love.Their agitated
hearts told at a glance the tumult of their joy.The father joined their
hands, and blessed them with words of tenderness.The marriage of Coningsby and Edith took place early in the autumn.It was solemnised at Millbank, and they passed their first moon at
Hellingsley, which place was in future to be the residence of the member
for Darlford.The estate was to devolve to Coningsby after the death of
Mr.Millbank, who in the meantime made arrangements which permitted
the newly-married couple to reside at the Hall in a manner becoming its
occupants.Millbank assured Coningsby,
were effected not only with the sanction, but at the express instance,
of his son.An event, however, occurred not very long after the marriage of
Coningsby, which rendered this generous conduct of his father-in-law no
longer necessary to his fortunes, though he never forgot its exercise.The gentle and unhappy daughter of Lord Monmouth quitted a scene with
which her spirit had never greatly sympathised.Perhaps she might have
lingered in life for yet a little while, had it not been for that fatal
inheritance which disturbed her peace and embittered her days, haunting
her heart with the recollection that she had been the unconscious
instrument of injuring the only being whom she loved, and embarrassing
and encumbering her with duties foreign to her experience and her
nature.The marriage of Coningsby had greatly affected her, and from
that day she seemed gradually to decline.She died towards the end
of the autumn, and, subject to an ample annuity to Villebecque, she
bequeathed the whole of her fortune to the husband of Edith.Gratifying
as it was to him to present such an inheritance to his wife, it was not
without a pang that he received the intelligence of the death of Flora.Edith sympathised in his affectionate feelings, and they raised a
monument to her memory in the gardens of Hellingsley.Coningsby passed his next Christmas in his own hall with his beautiful
and gifted wife by his side, and surrounded by the friends of his heart
and his youth.They stand now on the threshold of public life.They are in the leash,
but in a moment they will be slipped.Will they
maintain in august assemblies and high places the great truths which, in
study and in solitude, they have embraced?Or will their courage exhaust
itself in the struggle, their enthusiasm evaporate before hollow-hearted
ridicule, their generous impulses yield with a vulgar catastrophe to the
tawdry temptations of a low ambition?Will their skilled intelligence
subside into being the adroit tool of a corrupt party?Will Vanity
confound their fortunes, or Jealousy wither their sympathies?Or will
they remain brave, single, and true; refuse to bow before shadows and
worship phrases; sensible of the greatness of their position, recognise
the greatness of their duties; denounce to a perplexed and disheartened
world the frigid theories of a generalising age that have destroyed
the individuality of man, and restore the happiness of their country by
believing in their own energies, and daring to be great?He'll vanish in a flame of
fire, I warrant ye!WHITWELL (_gives paper to JANE_).JANE (_to CODDLE_).Grant, as you
say, of course.A Heaven-sent son-in-law!I must have a little confidential talk
with him, Jane.must I have a pair on 'em on
my hands!(_WHITWELL takes no
notice._) Delicious!Never again disbelieve in
special providences.(_Signs to WHITWELL to sit down._)

WHITWELL (_points to easy-chair_).(_Both sit._)

JANE.A pair of posts, like, and nary a trumpet
between 'em, except me.CODDLE (_looks at WHITWELL_).Young man, you look surprised at the
interest I take in you.(_Jumps up._) Jane, who knows but he's
already married!(_Sits, shouts._) Have you a wife?he's single, and marries Eglantine for sartain.(_Shouts._) Are you a bachelor?(_Projects his ear._)

WHITWELL.By Jove, _he's_ deaf, and no mistake.(_Roars._) Will you dine with us?I'll
take no refusal.--Jane, dinner at five.(_Courtesies._) Yah, old crosspatch!with your
providential son-in-laws, and your bachelors, and your dine-at-fives.No, thank you, Jane; not fish-balls.with your fish-balls and your curries.Oh, if it wasn't for
that trumpery legacy!(_Exit L., snarling._)

CODDLE.WHITWELL (_loudly_).My dear sir, is it possible you suffer such
insolence?Yes, a perfect treasure, my
young friend.Well, after that, deaf isn't the word for it.CODDLE (_rises, shuts doors and window, sets gun in corner, then sits
near WHITWELL.Shouts._) Now, my _dear_ friend, let us have a little
talk; a confidential talk, eh!Confidential, in a bellow like that!I asked you to dinner,
not that you might eat.What for, then, I'd like to know?Had you been a married man, I would have sent you
to jail with pleasure; but you're a bachelor.Now, I'm a father, with
a dear daughter as happy as the day is long.Possibly in every respect
you may not suit her.WHITWELL (_picks up hat_).Does the old dolt mean to insult me!But you suit _me_, my friend, to a T; and I offer
you her hand, plump, no more words about it.Sir; (_Aside._) She's humpbacked, I'll stake my life, a
dromedary!Between ourselves, sir,--in the strictest
confidence, mind,--she will bring you a nest-egg of fifty thousand
dollars.A double hump, then, beyond all doubt.Not a
dromedary,--a camel!(_Bows._) (_Shouts._) Sir, I
appreciate the honor, but I--(_Going._)

CODDLE.Not so fast; you can't go to her yet.If you could have heard a
word she said, you shouldn't have my daughter.Perhaps you may not have noticed that I'm a trifle
deaf.(_Shouts._) I think I
did notice it.A little hard of hearing, so to speak.You
see, young man, I live here entirely alone with my daughter.She talks
with nobody but _me_, and is as happy as a bird the livelong day.She must have a sweet old time of it.Now, suppose I were to take for a son-in-law one of the dozen
who have already teased my life out for her,--a fellow with his ears
entirely normal: of course they'd talk together in their natural
voice, and force me to be incessantly calling out, "What's that you're
saying?""I can't hear; say that again."The thing's preposterous, of course.Now, with
a son-in-law like yourself,--deaf as a door-post,--this annoyance
couldn't happen.You'd shout at your wife, she'd shout back, of course,
and I'd hear the whole conversation.(_Aside._) The old
scoundrel looks out for number one, don't he?(_Enter JANE, door in F., with visiting-card._)

CODDLE (_shouts_).I
get an audible son-in-law, you, a charming wife.she with a double hump on her
back, and he has the face to say she's charming.we're in for another deefy in the family.(_Shouts._) A
gentleman to see you, sir.(_Shouts._) Now, my
boy, before you see your future bride, you'll want to fix up a little,
eh?(_Points to door, R._) Step in there, my dear friend, and arrange
your dress.WHITWELL (_shakes his head_).(_Aside._) This scrape I'm in begins to look
alarming.(_Pushes him out._) Be
off, lad, be off.(_Motions to brush his
hair, &c._) Brushes, combs, collars, and a razor.(_Exit WHITWELL, R._)
I felt certain a merciful Providence would send me the right husband
for Eglantine at last.Dear, faithful, affectionate
Jane, wish me joy!1 E._)

            (_EGLANTINE enters R. as her father runs out._)

EGLANTINE.Jane, is any thing the matter with papa?He's found that son-in-law of
his'n,--that angel!In that there room, a-cleaning hisself.You've heared of the sacrifice of Abraham, Miss
Eglantine?Well, 'tain't a circumstance to the sacrifice of
Coddle!Maybe you know, miss, that, in the matter of hearing, your pa is
deficient?Alongside of the feller he's picked out for your beau,
your pa can hear the grass grow on the mounting-top, easy!Not deef, miss; deef ain't a touch to it.A hundred thousand times I refuse such a husband.Your pa can't marry
you without your consent: don't give it.(_Weeps._)

JANE.So it be, Miss Eglantine; so it be.Better give him the mitten out of hand, miss.I say!--He's
furrin, miss.--Mr.(_Knocks furiously._)

           (_WHITWELL comes out of chamber; sees EGLANTINE._)

WHITWELL (_aside_).Why, this is the gentleman I danced with at Sir
Edward's!Jane, this
gentleman hears as well as I do myself.How annoying I can't give a hint to Miss Coddle!If
that troublesome minx were only out of the way, now!Coddle, and I
des'say you does, but you don't suit _here_.Miss Eglantine, he can't hear nary a sound._You_ couldn't, if my finger and thumb were to meet
on your ear, you vixen!(_To EGLANTINE._) Miss Coddle is excessively
kind to receive me with such condescending politeness.I told you so, Miss Eglantine.He thinks I paid him a
compliment, sartain as yeast.When I met this poor gentleman at Lady
Thornton's, he was not afflicted in this way.Well, he's paying for all his sins now.It's
providential, I've no doubt.A dreadful misfortune has
befallen me since I had the pleasure of meeting you at the Thorntons'.My horse fell with me, and in falling I struck on my head.I have been
totally deaf ever since.Ordinary conversation I am incapable of hearing; but you,
Miss Coddle, whose loveliness has never been absent from my memory
since that happy day, you I am certain I could understand with ease.My
eyes will help me to interpret the movements of your lips.Speak to me,
and the poor sufferer whose sorrows awake your healing pity will surely
hear.(_Aside._) I hope old
Coddle won't never get that 'ere accomplishment.(_Exit slowly, I. U., much distressed._)

WHITWELL (_follows to door_).Stay, oh, stay, Miss Coddle!She's not for
you, jolterhead!WHITWELL (_shakes JANE violently_).I'm a jolterhead, am I?Lord forgive me, I do believe he can hear!(_Drops into chair._)

WHITWELL (_pulls her up_).For
your master, it suits me to be deaf.And, if you dare to betray me,
I'll let him know your treachery.I heard your impudent speeches, every
one of them.My hair
would turn snow in a single night!Silence for silence, then, you wretched woman.Besides, now you ain't deaf
no longer, I like you first-rate.If he
finds you out, all the fat'll be in the fire.To win Eglantine I'll be a horse-post, a
tomb-stone.Fire a thousand-pounder at my ear, and I'll not wink.Whittermat; and when I ring the
dinner-bell, don't you take no notice.But ain't I hungry, though, by Jove!JANE (_pushing him out C._).(_Exeunt L._)

                          (_Enter CODDLE, R._)

CODDLE.Wonderful electro-acoustico-
galvanism!(_Enter EGLANTINE._)

EGLANTINE (_screams_).CODDLE (_claps hands to his ears_).I have a surprise for you, sweet one.(_Sadly._)

CODDLE.Yes, cured miraculously by that wonderful aurist, with his
electro-magnetico--no, no; electro-galvanico--no, no; pshaw!CODDLE (_covering his ears_).My hearing is now abnormal;
actually abnormal, it is so acute.Perhaps _he_ can be cured, then.(_Shouts._)
Dearest papa, you cannot conceive how delighted I am.Whisper, Eglantine, for Heaven's sake!Forgive me, papa, it's habit.O papa, I've seen
him!(_Aside._) I really am
cured!Darling, you mustn't cry any more.No, papa, I won't, for I like him extremely now.He's so
handsome, and so amiable!Why, papa, you _asked_ him to marry me, Jane says.marry my darling to a
deaf man?O papa, you are cured: perhaps he can be cured in the same
way.Not another word, my love, about that horrible deaf fellow!I
asked him to dine here to-day, like an old ass; but I'll pack him off
immediately after.Papa, you will kill
me with your cruelty.(_Weeps._)

CODDLE.Pooh, darling, I've another, much better offer on hand.I got a letter this morning from my friend Pottle.His favorite
nephew--charming fellow.EGLANTINE (_sobbing_).Eglantine, a capital offer, I tell you.(_Stamps._)

CODDLE.But, Eglantine--

EGLANTINE.No, no, no, no, no!I'll kill
myself if I can't marry the man I love.(_Exit, weeping._)

CODDLE.(_Solus._) The image of her mother!And to think I've asked him to dinner!A scamp I don't know, and
never heard of, and who came into my house like a murderer, smashing
all my hot-houses!Confound him, I'll insult him till he can't see
out of his eyes!And I'll hand him
over to the police afterwards for malicious mischief--the horrid deaf
ruffian!The audacity of daring to demand my daughter's hand!Stop, stop, stop that
devilish tocsin!(_Looks down into garden._) There sits the miscreant,
reading a paper, and hearing nothing of a bell loud enough to wake the
dead.I long to witness the joy which irradiates her face, dear soul, when I
tell her I can hear.(_Calls._) Jane!--A
servant of an extinct species.(_Enter JANE with soup-tureen._) I've news for you, my faithful Jane.(_Looks round in bewilderment._)

JANE (_sets table, puts soup, &c., on it_).There's your soup, old
Coddle.Mollycoddle, I calls you!If it war'n't for that tuppenny legacy, old Cod, I'd do my best
to pop you into an asylum for idiots.(_Exit, C., meets WHITWELL._)

CODDLE.So this is her boasted fidelity, her undying
affection!Why, the faithless, abominable, ungrateful, treacherous
vixen!But her face is enough to show the vile blackness of her heart!And
the money I've bequeathed her.She sha'n't stay another twenty-four
hours in my house.(_Sees WHITWELL._) Nor you either, you swindling
vagabond.Hallo, the wind's shifted with a vengeance!(_Shouts._) Thank
you, you're very kind.(_Bows._) Very sorry I invited you,
you scamp!Hope you'll find my dinner uneatable.(_Shouts._) Very
true; a lovely prospect indeed.A man as deaf as this fellow (_bows, and points
to table_) should be hanged as a warning.(_Politely._) This is your
last visit here, I assure you.If it were only lawful to kick one's father-in-law, I'd do it
on the spot.(_Shouts._) Your unvarying kindness to a mere stranger,
sir, is an honor to human nature.(_Pulls away best chair, and goes
for another._) No, no: shot if he shall have the best chair in the
house!If he don't like it, he can lump it.CODDLE (_returns with a stool_).Here's the proper seat for you, you
pig!(_Shouts._) I offer you this with the greatest pleasure.(_Drops voice._) You intolerable
old brute!WHITWELL (_bowing politely_).If you're ever my father-in-law, I'll
show you how to treat a gentleman.I'll give Eglantine to a coal-heaver
first,--the animal!(_Shouts._) Pray be seated, (_drops voice_) and
choke yourself.One gets a very fine appetite after a hard day's
sport.(_Drops voice._) Atrocious old ruffian!(_They sit._)

WHITWELL (_shouts_).Will not Miss Coddle dine with us to-day?(_Shouts._) She's not well.This
soup is cold, I fear.(_Offers some._)

WHITWELL.(_Bows courteously a refusal._)

CODDLE.(_Shouts._) Nay, I insist.(_Drops voice._)
It's smoked,--just fit for you.(_Drops voice._) Old
savage, lucky for you I adore your lovely daughter!Shall I pitch this tureen at his head?--Jane!(_Enter JANE with
a dish._) Take off the soup, Jane.(_Puts dish on table._)

WHITWELL (_shouts_).(_Puts partridge on his own plate._) Jane can't
boil spinach.(_Helps WHITWELL to the spinach._)

WHITWELL (_rises_).(_Drops voice._) Get rid of you
all the sooner.--Jane, cigars.(_Crosses to R._)

WHITWELL (_aside, furious_).JANE (_aside to WHITWELL_).Don't
upset your fish-kittle.We'll have a little fun with the old
sheep.JANE (_takes box from console, and offers it; shouts_).I hope they'll turn your
stomick.CODDLE (_seizes her ear_).(_Pulls her round._) I'm a sheep, am I?I'm a
mollycoddle, am I?You'll have a little fun out of the old sheep, will you?You
tell me to shut up, eh?Clap me into an asylum, will you?(_Lets go her
ear._)

JANE.(_Crosses to L., screaming._)

                          (_Enter EGLANTINE._)

EGLANTINE.For heaven's sake, what _is_ the matter?WHITWELL (_stupefied_).Perfectly well, sir; and so it seems can you.I
will repeat, if you wish it, every one of those delectable compliments
you paid me five minutes since.WHITWELL (_to EGLANTINE_).Miss Coddle, has he
been shamming deafness, then, all this time?A doctor cured his deafness only half
an hour ago.Dear old master, was it kind to deceive me in this fashion?now ye can hear, I love you tenderer than
ever.Tell you, you pig, you minx!I tell you to walk out of my house.CODDLE (_loud to WHITWELL_).You are an impostor,
sir.EGLANTINE (_shrieks_).(_Hides her
face in her hands._)

WHITWELL.or I should have lost the rapture of
that sweet avowal.Coddle, I love--I adore your daughter.You heard
a moment since the confession that escaped her innocent lips.Surely
you cannot turn a deaf ear to the voice of nature, and see us both
miserable for life.Remember, sir, you have now no deaf ear to turn.Give you my daughter after all your frightful
insults?Remember how you treated me, sir; and reflect, too, that you
began it.Insults are not insults unless intended to be heard.For
every thing I said, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.CODDLE (_after a pause_)._Eglantine._ Papa, of course he does.Whittermat, I can't give my daughter to
a man I never heard of in my life,--and with such a preposterous name
too!My name is Whitwell, my dear sir,--not Whittermat: nephew of
your old friend Benjamin Pottle.What did you tell me your name was Whittermat for?Some singular mistake, sir: I never did.Can't imagine how
the mistake could have occurred.Well, since you heard
all _I_ said--Ha, ha, ha!For every Roland of mine you
gave me two Olivers at least.Diamond cut diamond,--ha, ha, ha!All laugh heartily._)

JANE.I never thought I'd live to see this happy day,
master.Hold your tongue, you impudent cat!Mollycoddle,
indeed!Coddle, you won't go for to turn off a faithful servant in
this way.(_Aside to WHITWELL._) That legacy's lost.(_To CODDLE._) Ah,
master dear!you won't find nobody else as'll work their fingers to the
bone, and their voice to a thread-paper, as I have: up early and down
late, and yelling and screeching from morning till night.Well, the
house will go to rack and ruin when I'm gone,--that's one comfort.WHITWELL (_aside to JANE_).The money's yours, cash down, the day of my
wedding.Well, well, Jane, I'll forgive you, for luck.But I wish you knew how to boil spinach.Harrold for a week
from to-day, and invite all our friends (_to the audience_) to witness
the wedding.All who mean to come will please signify it by clapping their hands,
and the harder the better.(_Curtain falls._)

BAKER, Hamilton Place, Boston, Mass.Transcriber's Note:

    Every effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as
    possible.Italic text has been marked with _underscores_.On leaving me, he gave me twenty-five cents, and said,
"you'll be caught if you go with the other passengers."The captain said
he could hide me and no one know that I was on board, but himself.He
led me to the end of the boat, and put me upon a board over the horses.He fixed a strong cord for me to hold on by, and said, "you must be
careful and not fall down, for the horses would certainly kill you
before you could be taken out."The captain was very kind to me and when
I left him, gave me twenty-five cents, and some good advice.He said
I must hurry along as fast as possible, for it was Jubilee, and the
priests would all be in church at four o'clock.He also advised me not
to stop in any place where a Romish priest resided, "for," said he,
"the convent people have, undoubtedly, telegraphed all over the country
giving a minute description of your person, and the priests will all be
looking for you."Two days I travelled as fast as my strength would allow, when I came
to Sorel, which was on the other side of the river.Here I saw several
priests on the road coming directly towards me.That they were after me,
I had not a doubt.To escape by running, was out
of the question, but just at that moment my eye fell upon a boat near
the shore.I ran to the captain, and asked him to take me across the
river.He consented, and, as I expected, the priests took another boat
and followed us.Once more I gave myself up for lost, and prepared
to spring into the water, if they were likely to overtake me.The man
understood my feelings, and exerted all his strength to urge forward
the boat.At last it reached the shore, and as he helped me out he
whispered, "Now run."I did run, but though my own liberty was at
stake I could not help thinking about the consequences to that man if
I escaped, for I knew they would make him pay a heavy fine for his
benevolent act.A large house stood in my way, and throwing open the
door I exclaimed, "Are there any protestants here?""O, yes," replied
a man who sat there, "come with me."He led me to the kitchen, where a
large company of Irish men were rolling little balls on a table.I saw
the men were Irish and my first thought was, "I am betrayed."But my fears were soon relieved, for the man exclaimed, "Here is a
nun, inquiring for protestants.""Well," replied one who seemed to be
a leader, "this is the right place to find them.And then they all began to shout, "Down with the Catholics!I was frightened at their
violence, but their leader came to me, and with the kindness of a
brother, said, "Do not fear us.If you are a run-away, we will protect
you."He bade the men be still and asked if any one was after me.I told
him about the priests, and he replied, "you have come to the right place
for protection, for they dare not show themselves here.I am the leader
of a band of Anti-Catholics, and this is their lodge.You have heard of
us, I presume; we are called Orange men.Our object is, to overthrow the
Roman Catholic religion, and we are bound by the most fearful oaths to
stand by each other, and protect all who seek our aid.The priests dread
our influence, for we have many members, and I hope ere long, the power
of the Pope in this country will be at an end.I am sure people must see
what a cruel, hypocritical set they are."Before he had done speaking, a man came to the door and said, "The
carriage is ready."Another of the men, on hearing this, said, "Come
with me, and I'll take you out of the reach of the priests."He
conducted me to a carriage, which was covered and the curtains all
fastened down.He helped me into it, directing me to sit upon the back
seat, where I could not be seen by any one unless they took particular
pains.Oars that night, and, if I remember right,
he said the distance was twelve miles.When, he left me he gave me
twenty-five cents.I travelled all night, and about midnight passed
through St.Dennis, But I did not stop until the next morning, when I
called at a house and asked for something to eat.The lady gave me some
bread and milk, and I again pursued my way.Once more I had the good fortune to obtain a passage across the river in
a ferry-boat, and was soon pressing onward upon the other side.John's, I followed the
railroad to a village which I was informed was called Stotsville,
[Footnote: I beg leave once more to remind the reader that it is by
no means certain that I give these names correctly.Hearing them
pronounced, with no idea of ever referring to them again, it is not
strange that mistakes of this kind should occur.]a great part of the
property being owned by a Mr.Stots, to whom I was at once directed.Here I stopped, and was kindly received by the gentleman and his wife.They offered me refreshments, gave me some articles of clothing, and
then he carried me twelve miles, and left me at Rouse's Point, to take
the cars for Albany.He gave me six dollars to pay my expenses, and a
letter of introduction to a gentleman by the name of Williams, in which
he stated all the facts he knew concerning me, and commended me to his
care for protection.Williams lived on North
Pearl street, but I may be mistaken in this and also in some other
particulars.As I had no thought of relating these facts at the time of
their occurrence, I did not fix them in my mind as I otherwise should
have done.Stots said that if I could not find the gentleman to whom the letter
was directed, I was to take it to the city authorities, and they would
protect me.As he assisted me from the carriage he said, "You will stop
here until the cars come along, and you must get your own ticket.I
shall not notice you again, and I do not wish you to speak to me."I
entered the depot intending to follow his directions; but when I found
the cars would not come along for three hours, I did not dare to stay.There was quite a large collection of people there, and I feared that
some one would suspect and stop me.I therefore resolved to follow the
railroad, and walk on to the next station.On my way I passed over a
railroad bridge, which I should think was two miles long.The wind blew
very hard at the time, and I found it exceedingly difficult to walk
upon the narrow timbers.More than once I came near losing my precarious
footing, and I was in constant fear that the train would overtake me
before I got over.In that case I had resolved to step outside the track
where I thought I could stand upon the edge of the bridge and hold on
by the telegraph poles, and thus let them pass without doing me injury.Happily, however, I was not compelled to resort to this perilous
expedient, but passed the bridge in safety.At the end I found another
nearly as long, connected with it by a drawbridge.When I drew near it
was up for a boat to pass; but a man called to me, and asked if I
wish to go over.I told him I did, and he let down the bridge.As I
approached him he asked, "Are you mad?I told
him I had walked from the depot at Rouse's Point.He appeared greatly
surprised, and said, "You are the first person who ever walked over
that bridge.Will you come to my house and rest awhile?You must be very
weary, and my wife will be glad to see you.She is rather lonely
here, and is pleased to see any one.'Tis only a short
distance, just down under the bridge."I
thanked him, but firmly refused to go one step out of my way.I thought
that he wished to deceive me, perhaps take me to some out-of-the-way
place, and give me up to my pursuers.At all events, it was wise not to
trust him, for I was sure there was no house near the bridge, certainly
not under it.I have since learned that such is the fact.As I turned to
leave him, he again urged me to stop, and said, "The cars will soon be
along, and they will run over you.How do you expect to get out of their
way?"I told him I would risk it, and left him.I passed on in safety,
and soon came to the depot, where I took the evening train for Albany.At eight the same evening I left the cars, and walked on towards Troy,
which I think was four miles distant.Here I met a lad, of whom I
inquired the way to Albany."You cannot get there to-night," said he,
"and I advise you not to try."When he saw that I was determined to go
on, he said I would pass a tavern called the half-way house, and if I
was tired I could stop there.It was about eleven o'clock when I passed
this house, There were several persons on the piazza, laughing, talking,
and singing, who called me as I passed, shouted after me, and bade me
stop.Exceedingly frightened, I ran with all possible speed, but they
continued to call after me till I was out of hearing.Seeing a light
at a house near by, I ventured to rap on the door.It was opened by a
woman, who asked me to walk in.She
informed me, but said, "You can't go there to-night."I told her I must,
"Well," said she, "if you will go, the watch will take care of you when
you get there."She then asked, "Were those men calling after you?"I
told her I supposed they were, when she replied, with a peculiar smile,
"I guess you can't be a very nice kind of girl, or you wouldn't be on
the street this time of night."My feelings were so deeply wounded I
could hardly restrain my tears at this cruel insinuation; but pride came
to my aid, and, choking down the rising emotion, I replied as carelessly
as possible, "I must do as I can, and not as I would."It was about one o'clock at night when I entered the principal street in
Albany, and, as the lady predicted, a watchman came to me and asked why
I was out that time of night.He stood
beside a lamp-post and read it, when he seemed satisfied, and said, "I
know the man; come with me and I'll take you to his house."I followed
him a long way, till at last he stopped before a large house, and rang
the bell.Williams came to the door, and asked what was wanted.He read it, and invited me to stop.His
wife got up, received me very kindly, and gave me some supper, for
which I was truly grateful.Nor was I less thankful for the delicate
consideration with which they avoided any allusion to my convent life,
or my subsequent flight and suffering.Williams saw that I was sad
and weary, and as she conducted me to a comfortable bed, she remarked,
"You are safe at last, and I am glad of it.You can now retire without
the apprehension of danger, and sleep in perfect security.You are with
friends who will protect you as long as you choose to remain with us."Notwithstanding the good lady's assurance of safety, I found it
impossible to close my eyes.I was among strangers, in a strange place,
and, having been so often deceived, might I not be again?Perhaps, after
all their pretended kindness, they were plotting to betray me.A few
days, however, convinced me that I had at last found real friends, who
would protect me in the hour of danger to the utmost of their ability.I remained here some four weeks, and should have remained longer, but an
incident transpired that awakened all my fears, and again sent me forth
into the wide world, a fugitive, and a wanderer.I went to my chamber
one night, when I heard a sound like the full, heavy respiration of a
man in deep sleep.The sound appeared to come from under the bed, but
stopped as I entered the room.I was very much alarmed, but I controlled
my feelings, and instead of running shrieking from the room, I
deliberately closed the blinds, shut the windows, adjusted the curtain,
all the time carelessly humming a tune, and taking up my lamp I
slowly left the room.Once outside the door, I ran in all haste to Mr.Williams, and told him what I had heard.He laughed at me, said it was
all imagination, but, to quiet my fears, he went to my room resolved
to convince me that no one was there.I followed, and stood at the door
while he lifted the bed valance, when a large, tall man sprang forth,
and caught him with one hand while with the other he drew a pistol
from beneath his coat saying, "Let me go, and I'll depart in peace; but
attempt to detain me, and I'll blow your brains out."Williams came in great terror and consternation, to see what was
the matter.But she could render no assistance, and Mr.Williams, being
unarmed, was obliged to let him go.The watch were immediately called,
and they sought for the intruder in every direction.No effort was
spared to find him, that we might, at least, learn the object of
this untimely visit.No trace of his
whereabouts could be discovered.Williams said he did not believe it was me he sought.He thought the
object was robbery, and perhaps arson and murder, but he would not
think that I was in the least danger."The man," he said, "in hastily
concealing himself had taken the first hiding place he could find."Indeed, so sure was I that he was an agent of the
priests, sent forth for the express purpose of arresting me, no earthly
consideration would have induced me to remain there another day.The
rest of that night I spent in a state of anxiety I cannot describe.I dared not even undress and go to bed, but I
sat in my chair, or walked the room every moment expecting the return
of the mysterious visitor.I shuddered at every sound, whether real or
imaginary.Once in particular, I remember, the distant roll of carriage
wheels fell upon my ear.I listened; it came near, and still nearer,
till at last it stopped, as I thought, at the gate.For a moment I stood
literally stupified with terror, and then I hastily prepared to use the
means for self destruction I had already provided in anticipation of
such an emergency.I was still resolved never to be taken alive."Give
me liberty or give me death," was now the language of my soul.If I
could not enjoy the one, I would cordially embrace the other.But it was
a sad alternative after all I had suffered that I might be free, after
all my buoyant hopes, all my ardent aspirations for a better life.O, it
was a bitter thing, thus to stand in the darkness of night, and with my
own hand carefully adjust the cord that was to cut me off from the land
of the living, and in a moment launch my trembling soul into the vast,
unknown, untried, and fearful future, that men call eternity!Was this
to be the only use I was to make of liberty?Was it for this I had so
long struggled, toiled, wept and prayed?"God of mercy," I cried, "save,
O save me from this last great sin!From the sad and dire necessity
which thus urges me to cut short a life which thou alone canst give!"My prayer was heard; but how slowly passed the hours of that weary night
while I waited for the day that I might "hasten my escape from the windy
storm and tempest."Truly, at that time I could say with one of old,
"Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed
me.My heart is sore pained within me, and the terrors of death are
fallen upon me.Oh that I had the wings of a dove, for then would I flee
away, and be at rest."I had not the wings of a dove, and whither should I flee from
the furious grasp of my relentless persecutors?Again I must go forth
into the "busy haunts of men," I must mingle with the multitude, and
what chance had I for ultimate escape?If I left these kind friends, and
leave them I must, who would take me in?Who
would have the power to rescue me in my hour of need?In God alone could
I trust, yet why is he so far from helping me?And why does he thus allow the wicked to triumph; to
lay snares for the feet of the innocent, and wrongfully persecute those
whom their wanton cruelty hath caused to sit in darkness and in the
shadow of death?Why does he not at once "break the bands of iron, and
let the oppressed go free?"Williams in the
morning, I told him I could no longer remain with him, for I was sure
if I did, I should be suddenly arrested in some unguarded moment, and
carried back to Montreal.He urged me to stay, assured me he would never
allow them to take me, said that he thought some of going south, and I
could go with him, and thus be removed far from all whom I feared.Williams, also, strove to persuade me to stay.But, though sorry to
appear ungrateful, I dared not remain another night where I felt that my
danger was so great.When they found that I was determined to go, Mr.Williams said I
had better go to Worcester, Mass., and try to get employment in some
farmer's family, a little out of the city.He gave me money to bear my
expenses, until I found a place where I could earn my living.It was
with a sad heart that I left this hospitable roof, and as I turned away
I said in my heart, "Shall I always be hunted through the world in this
manner, obliged to flee like a guilty thing, and shall I never find
a home of happiness and peace?Must sorrow and despair forever be the
portion of my cup?"But no words of mine can describe what I felt at
that moment.I longed for the power to sound a warning through the
length and breadth of the land, to cry in the ears of all the people,
"Beware of Romanism!"Like the patient man of Uz, with whose history
I have since become familiar, I was ready to exclaim, "O that my words
were now written!Graven with an
iron pen," that the whole world might know what a fearful and bitter
thing it is to be a nun!To be subject to the control of those ruthless
tyrants, the Romish Priests.Once more I entered the depot, and mingled with the crowd around the
ticket office.But no pen can describe my terror when I found myself the
object of particular attention.I heard people remark about my strange
and unnatural appearance, and I feared I might be taken up for a crazy
person, if not for a nun.Thinking that I saw an enemy in every face,
and a pursuer in every one who came near me, I hastened to take refuge
in the cars.There I waited with the greatest impatience for the
starting of the train.Slowly the cars were filled; very leisurely the
passengers sought their seats, while I sat trembling in every limb, and
the cold perspiration starting from every pore.how eagerly I watched for some indication of the priest or
the spy!So intense was my anxiety, those few moments seemed to me an
age of agony.At length the shrill whistle announced that all was ready,
and like sweetest music the sound fell upon my ears.The train dashed
off at lightning speed, but to me it seemed like the movement of a
snail.Once under way, I ventured to breathe freely, and hope again revived.But even as the thought passed my mind, a
man entered the cars and seated himself directly, before me.I thought
he regarded me with too much interest, and thinking to shun him, I
quietly left my seat and retired to the other end of the car.He soon
followed, and again my fears revived.He at first tried to converse with
me, but finding I would not reply, he began to question me in the most
direct and impertinent manner.Again I changed my seat, and again he
followed.I then sought the conductor, and revealed to him enough of my
history to enlist his sympathy and ensure his protection.To his honor
be it spoken, I did not appeal to him in vain.He severely reproved the
man for his impertinence; and for the rest of the journey I was shielded
from insult or injury.Nothing further of interest transpired until I reached Worcester, when
the first face that met my eye as I was about to leave the cars was that
of a Romish priest.I could not be mistaken, for I had often seen him
at Montreal.He might not have been looking for me, but he watched every
passenger as they left the cars in a way that convinced me he had some
special reason for doing it.As I, too, had special reasons for avoiding
him just at that time, I stepped back out of sight until the passengers
were all out of the cars and the priest had turned away.I then sprang
out upon the opposite side, and, turning my back upon the depot,
hastened away amid the wilderness of houses, not knowing whither I went.For a long time I wandered around, until at length, being faint and
weary, I began to look for some place where I could obtain refreshment.But when I found a restaurant I did not dare to enter.A number of
Irishmen were standing around who were in all probability Catholics.I
would not venture among them; but as I turned aside I remembered that
Mr.Williams had directed me to seek employment a little out of the
city.I then inquired the way to Main street, and having found it, I
turned to the north and walked on till I found myself out of the thickly
settled part of the city.Then I began to seek for employment, and after
several fruitless applications I chanced to call upon a man whose name
was Handy.He received me in the kindest manner, and when I asked for
work, he said his wife did not need to hire me, but I was welcome to
stop with them and work for my board until I found employment elsewhere.This offer I joyfully accepted; and, as I became acquainted in the
place, many kind hands were extended to aid me in my efforts to obtain
an honest living.In this neighborhood I still reside, truly thankful
for past deliverance, grateful for present mercies, and confidently
trusting God for the future.Here closes the history of Sarah J. Richardson, as related by herself.The remaining particulars have been obtained from her employers in
Worcester.She arrived in this city August, 1854, and, as she has already stated,
at once commenced seeking for employment.She called at many houses
before she found any one who wished for help; and her first question
at each place was, "Are you a Catholic?"If the answer was in the
affirmative, she passed on, but if the family were Protestants, she
inquired for some kind of employment.She did not care what it was; she
would cook, wash, sew, or do chamber-work--anything to earn her bread.Handy was the first person who took her in, and gave her a home.In his family she worked for her board a few weeks, going out to wash
occasionally as she had opportunity.She then went to Holden Mass., but
for some reason remained only one week, and again returned to Worcester.Ezra Goddard then took her into his own family, and found her
capable, industrious, and trustworthy.Had anything been wanting to
prove her truthfulness and sincerity, the deep gratitude of her fervent
"I thank you," when told that she had found a permanent home, would
have done it effectually.But though her whole appearance indicated
contentment and earnestness of purpose, though her various duties
were faithfully and zealously performed, yet the deep sadness of her
countenance, and the evident anxiety of her mind at first awakened a
suspicion of mental derangement.She seemed restless, suspicious,
and morbidly apprehensive of approaching danger.The appearance of a
stranger, or a sudden ringing of the bell, would cause her to start,
tremble, and exhibit the greatest perturbation of spirit.In fact, she
seemed so constantly on the qui vive, the lady of the house one day said
to her, "Sarah, what is the matter with you?"The
Roman Catholic priests," she replied.I ran away
from the Grey Nunnery at Montreal, and twice I have been caught, carried
back, and punished in the most cruel manner.O, if you knew what I have
suffered, you would not wonder that I live in constant fear lest they
again seek out my retreat; and I will die before I go back again."Further questioning drew from her the foregoing narrative, which she
repeated once and again to various persons, and at different times,
without the least alteration or contradiction.Goddard some weeks, when she was taken into the employ of Mr.This gentleman informs us that he found her a faithful, industrious,
honest servant, and he has not the least doubt of the truthfulness of
her statements respecting her former life in the Convent.A few weeks after this, she was married to Frederick S. Richardson
with whom she became acquainted soon after her arrival in the city of
Worcester.The marriage ceremony was performed by Charles Chaffin, Esq.,
of Holden, Mass.After their marriage, her husband hired a room in the
house occupied by Mr.After a
few weeks, however, they removed to a place called the Drury farm.It is
owned by the heirs, but left in the care of Mr.Richardson had often been advised
to allow her history to be placed before the public.But she always
replied, "For my life I would not do it.Not because I do not wish the
world to know it, for I would gladly proclaim it wherever a Romanist is
known, but it would be impossible for me to escape their hands should
I make myself so public.After
her marriage, however, her principal objection was removed.She thought
they would not wish to take her back into the nunnery, and her husband
would protect her from violence.She therefore related the story of her
life while in the convent, which, in accordance with her own request,
was written down from her lips as she related it.Lucy Ann Hood, wife of Edward P. Hood, and daughter of Ezra Goddard.It
is now given to the public without addition or alteration, and with
but a slight abridgment.A strange and startling story it certainly
is.Perhaps the reader will cast it aside at once as a worthless
fiction,--the idle vagary of an excited brain.The compiler, of course,
cannot vouch for its truth, but would respectfully invite the attention
of the reader to the following testimonials presented by those who have
known the narrator.The first is from Edward P. Hood, with whom Mrs.Richardson resided when her narrative was written.(TESTIMONY OF EDWARD P.I hereby certify that I was personally
acquainted with Sarah J. Richards, now Sarah J. Richardson, at the time
she resided in Worcester, Mass.I first saw her at the house of Mr.Ezra
Goddard, where she came seeking employment.She appeared anxious to get
some kind of work, was willing to do anything to earn an honest living.She had the appearance of a person who had seen much suffering and
hardship.Goddard a short time, when she obtained
another place.She then left, but called very often; and during her stay
in Worcester, she worked there several times.So far as I was able to
judge of her character, I do not hesitate to say that she was a woman
of truth and honesty.I heard her relate the account of her life and
sufferings in the Grey Nunnery, and her final escape.I knew when the
story was written, and can testify to its being done according to her
own dictation.I have examined the manuscript, and can say that it a
written out truly and faithfully as related by the nun herself.Worcester, May 5, 1856.(TESTIMONY OF EZRA GODDARD.)I first became acquainted with Sarah J. Richardson in August 1854.She
came to my house to work for my wife.She was at my house a great many
times after that until March 1855, when she left Worcester.At one time
she was there four or five weeks in succession.She was industrious,
willing to do anything to get an honest living.She was kind in her
disposition, and honest in her dealings.I have no hesitation in saying
that I think her statements can be relied upon.(TESTIMONY OF LUCY GODDARD.)I am acquainted with the above named Sarah J. Richardson, and can fully
testify to the truth of the above statements as to her kindness and
industrious habits, honesty and truthfulness.(TESTIMONY OF JOSIAH GODDARD.)To whom it may concern: This is to testify that I am acquainted with
Sarah J. Richardson, formerly Sarah J. Richards.I became acquainted
with her in the fall of 1854.She worked at my father's at the time.I
heard her tell her story, and from what I saw of her while she was in
Worcester, I have no hesitation in saying that she was a woman of truth
and honesty.Worcester, March 1, 1856.(TESTIMONY OF EBEN JEWETT.)I became acquainted with Sarah J. Richardson last winter, at the house
of Mr.Ezra Goddard; saw her a number of times after that, at the place
where I boarded.She did some work for my wife, and I heard her speak
of being at the Grey Nunnery.I have no doubt of her being honest and truthful, and I believe
she is so considered by all who became acquainted with her.(TESTIMONY OF CHARLES CHAFFIN.)Worcester, ss.--Holden, Nov.This certifies that I this day united in marriage, Frederick S.
Richardson and Sarah J. Richards, both of Worcester.CHARLES CHAFFIN, Justice of the Peace.I, Sarah J. Richardson, wife of Frederick S. Richardson, of the city
of Worcester, County of Worcester, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
formerly Sarah J. Richards before marriage, do solemnly swear, declare
and say, that the foregoing pages contain a true and faithful history of
my life before my marriage to the said Frederick S. Richardson, and
that every statement made herein by me is true.In witness whereof, I do
hereunto set my hand and seal, this 13th day of March, A.D.SARAH J. RICHARDSON (X her mark.)Sworn to before me, the 13th day of March, AD.(TESTIMONY OF Z. K.When it was known that the Narrative of Sarah J. Richardson was about to
be published, Mr.Z. K. Pangborn, at that time editor of the Worcester
Daily Transcript, voluntarily offered the following testimony which we
copy from one of his editorials."We have no doubt that the nun here spoken of as one who escaped from
the Grey Nunnery at Montreal, is the same person who spent some weeks in
our family in the fall of 1853, after her first escape from the Nunnery.She came in search of employment to our house in St.Albans, Vt.,
stating that she had traveled on foot from Montreal, and her appearance
indicated that she was poor, and had seen hardship.She obtained work
at sewing, her health not being sufficient for more arduous task.She
appeared to be suffering under some severe mental trial, and though
industrious and lady-like in her deportment, still appeared absent
minded, and occasionally singular in her manner.After awhile she
revealed the fact to the lady of the house, that she had escaped from
the Grey Nunnery at Montreal, but begged her not to inform any one
of the fact, as she feared, if it should be known, that she would be
retaken, and carried back.A few days after making this disclosure,
she suddenly disappeared.Having gone out one evening, and failing to
return, much inquiry was made, but no trace of her was obtained for some
months.called on us to
make inquiries in regard to this same person and gave us the following
account of her as given by herself.She states that on the evening when
she so mysteriously disappeared from our house, she called upon an Irish
family whose acquaintance she had formed, and when she was coming away,
was suddenly seized, gagged, and thrust into a close carriage, or box,
as she thought, and on the evening of the next day found herself once
more consigned to the tender mercies of the Grey Nunnery in Montreal.Her capture was effected by a priest who tracked her to St.Albans,
and watched his opportunity to seize her.She was subjected to the most
rigorous and cruel treatment, to punish her for running away, and kept
in close confinement till she feigned penitence and submission, when she
was treated less cruelly, and allowed more liberty."But the difficulties in the way of an escape, only stimulated her the
more to make the attempt, and she finally succeeded a second time in
getting out of that place which she described as a den of cruelty and
misery.She was successful also in eluding her pursuers, and in reaching
this city, (Worcester,) where she remained some time, seeking to avoid
notoriety, as she feared she might be again betrayed and captured.She
is now, however, in a position where she does not fear the priests, and
proposes to give to the world a history of her life in the Nunnery.The
disclosures she makes are of the most startling character, but of her
veracity and good character we have the most satisfactory evidence."Pangborn, a sister of the late Mrs
Branard, the lady with whom Sarah J. Richardson stopped in St.Albans,
and by whom she was employed as a seamstress.Being an inmate of the
family at the time, Mrs Pangborn states that she had every opportunity
to become acquainted with the girl and learn her true character.The
family, she says, were all interested in her, although they knew nothing
of her secret, until a few days before she left.She speaks of her as
being "quiet and thoughtful, diligent, faithful and anxious to please,
but manifesting an eager desire for learning, that she might be able to
acquaint herself more perfectly with the Holy Scriptures.She could,
at that time, read a little, and her mind was well stored with select
passages from the sacred volume, which she seemed to take great delight
in repeating.She was able to converse intelligently upon almost
any subject, and never seemed at a loss for language to express her
thoughts.No one could doubt that nature had given her a mind capable of
a high degree of religious and intellectual culture, and that, with
the opportunity for improvement, she would become a useful member of
society.Of book knowledge she was certainly quite ignorant, but she had
evidently studied human nature to some good purpose."Mrs Pangborn also
corroborates many of the statements in her narrative.She often visited
the Grey Nunnery, and says that the description given of the building,
the Academy, the Orphan's Home, and young ladies school, are all
correct.The young Smalley mentioned in the narrative was well known to
her, and also his sister "little Sissy Smalley," as they used to call
her.Inquiries have been made of those acquainted with the route along
which the fugitive passed in her hasty flight, and we are told that the
description is in general correct; that even the mistakes serve to prove
the truthfulness of the narrator, being such as a person would be likely
to make when describing from memory scenes and places they had seen but
once; whereas, if they were getting up a fiction which they designed to
represent as truth, such mistakes would be carefully avoided.APPENDIX I.

ABSURDITIES OF ROMANISTS.It may perchance be thought by some persons that the foregoing narrative
contains many things too absurd and childish for belief."What rational
man," it may be said, "would ever think of dressing up a figure to
represent the devil, for the purpose of frightening young girls into
obedience?Surely no sane man, and certainly
no Christian teacher, would ever stoop to such senseless mummery!"Incredible it may seem--foolish, false, inconsistent with reason, or the
plain dictates of common sense, it certainly is--but we have before us
well-authenticated accounts of transactions in which the Romish priests
claimed powers quite as extraordinary, and palmed off upon a credulous,
superstitious people stories quite as silly and ridiculous as anything
recorded in these pages.Indeed, so barefaced and shameless were their
pretensions in some instances, that even their better-informed brethren
were ashamed of their folly, and their own archbishop publicly rebuked
their dishonesty, cupidity and chicanery.In proof of this we place
before our readers the following facts which we find in a letter from
Professor Similien, of the college of Angers, addressed to the Union de
l'Ouest:

"Some years ago a pretended miracle was reported as having occurred upon
a mountain called La Salette, in the southeastern part of France,
where the Virgin Mary appeared in a very miraculous manner to two young
shepherds.The story, however, was soon proved to be a despicable trick
of the priest, and as such was publicly exposed.But the Bishop of
Lucon, within whose diocese the sacred mountain stands, appears to have
been unwilling to relinquish the advantage which he expected to result
from a wide-spread belief in this infamous fable.Accordingly, in
July, 1852, it was again reported that no less than three miracles were
wrought there by the Holy Virgin.The details were as follows:

"A young pupil at the religious establishment of the visitation of
Valence, who had been for three months completely blind from an attack
of gutta-serena, arrived at La Salette on the first of July, in company
with some sisters of the community.The extreme fatigue which she had
undergone in order to reach the summit of the mountain, at the place of
the apparition, caused some anxiety to be felt that she could not remain
fasting until the conclusion of the mass, which had not yet commenced,
and the Abbe Sibilla, one of the missionaries of La Salette, was
requested to administer the sacrament to her before the service began.She had scarcely received the sacred wafer, when, impelled by a sudden
inspiration, she raised her head and exclaimed,'ma bonne mere, je vous
vois.'She had, in fact, her eyes fixed on the statue of the Virgin,
which she saw as clearly as any one present For more than an hour she
remained plunged in an ecstasy of gratitude and love, and afterward
retired from the place without requiring the assistance of those who
accompanied her.At the same moment a woman from Gap, nearly sixty years
of age, who for the last nineteen years had not had the use of her right
arm, in consequence of a dislocation, suddenly felt it restored to
its original state, and swinging round the once paralyzed limb, she
exclaimed, in a transport of joy and gratitude, 'And I also am cured!'A third cure, although not instantaneous, is not the less striking.Another woman, known in the country for years as being paralytic, could
not ascend the mountain but with the greatest difficulty, and with the
aid of crutches.On the first day of the neuvane, that of her arrival,
she felt a sensation as if life was coming into her legs, which had been
for so long time dead.This feeling went on increasing, and the last day
of the neuvane, after having received the communion, she went, without
any assistance, to the cross of the assumption, where she hung up her
crutches."Bishop Lucon must have known that this was mere imposition; yet, so far
from exposing a fraud so base, he not only permits his people to believe
it, but he lends his whole influence to support and circulate the
falsehood.a church was to be erected; and it was necessary
to get up a little enthusiasm among the people in order to induce them
to fill his exhausted coffers, and build the church.In proof of this,
we have only to quote a few extracts from the 'Pastoral' which he issued
on this occasion."'And now," he says, "Mary has deigned to appear on the summit of a
lofty mountain to two young shepherds, revealing to them the secrets
of heaven.But who attests the truth of the narrative of these Alpine
pastors?No other than the men themselves, and they are believed.They
declare what they have seen, they repeat what they have heard, they
retain what they have received commandment to keep secret."A few words of the incomparable Mother of God have transformed them
into new men.Incapable of concerting aught between themselves, or of
imagining anything similar to what they relate, each is the witness to a
vision which has not found him unbelieving; each is its historian.These
two shepherds, dull as they were, have at once understood and received
the lesson which was vouchsafed to them, and it is ineffaceably engraven
on their hearts.They add nothing to it, they take nothing from it, they
modify it in nowise, they deliver the oracle of Heaven just as they have
received it."An admirable constancy enabled them to guard the secret, a singular
sagacity made them discern all the snares laid for them, a rare prudence
suggested to them a thousand responses, not one of which betrayed their
secret; and when at length the time came when it was their duty to make
it known to the common Father of the Faithful, they wrote correctly, as
if reading a book placed under their eyes.Their recital drew to this
blessed mountain thousands of pilgrims."They proclaimed that 'on Saturday, the 19th of September, 1846, Mary
manifested herself to them; and the anniversary of this glorious day is
henceforth and forever dear to Christian piety.Will not every pilgrim
who repairs to this holy mountain add his testimony to the truthfulness
of these young shepherds?Mary halted near a fountain; she communicated
to it a celestial virtue, a divine efficacy.From being intermittent,
this spring, today so celebrated, became perennial."'Every where is recounted the prodigies which she works.When the
afflicted are in despair, the infirm without remedy, they resort to the
waters of La Salette, and cures are wrought by this remedy, whose power
makes itself felt against every evil.Our diocess, so devoted to Mary,
has been no stranger to the bounty of this tender Mother.We are
about to celebrate shortly the sixth anniversary of this miraculous
apparition.NOW THAT A SANCTUARY IS TO BE RAISED on this holy mountain
to the glory of God, we have thought it right to inform you thereof."'We cannot doubt that many of you have been heard by our Lady of
La Salette; you desire to witness your gratitude to this mother of
compassion; you would gladly BRING YOUR STONE to the beautiful edifice
that is to be constructed.WE DESIRE TO FURTHER YOUR FILIAL TENDERNESS
WITH THE MEANS OF TRANSMITTING THE ALMS OF FAITH AND PIETY.For these
reasons, invoking the holy name of God, we have ordained and do ordain
as follows, viz.:

"'First, we permit the appearance of our Lady of La Salette to be
preached throughout our diocess; secondly, on Sunday, the 19th of
September next ensuing, the litanies of the Holy Virgin shall be chanted
in all the chapels and churches of the diocess, and be followed by the
benediction of the Holy Sacrament.Thirdly, THE FAITHFUL WHO MAY DESIRE
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ERECTION OF THE NEW SANCTUARY, MAY DEPOSIT THEIR
OFFERINGS IN THE HANDS OF THE CURE, WHO WILL TRANSMIT THEM TO US FOR THE
BISHOP OF GRENOBLE."'Our present pastoral letter shall be read and published after mass in
every parish on the Sunday after its reception."'Given at Lucon, in our Episcopal palace, under our sign-manual and the
seal of our arms, and the official counter-signature of our secretary,
the 30th of June, of the year of Grace, 1852."'X Jac-Mar Jos, "'Bishop of Lucon.'""It is not a little remarkable," says the editor of the American
Christian Union, "that whilst the Bishop of Lucon was engaged in
extolling the miracles of La Salette, the Cardinal Archbishop of Lyons,
Dr.Bonald, 'Primate of all the Gauls,' addressed a circular to all the
priests in his diocese, in which he cautions them against apocryphal
miracles!There is indubitable evidence that his grace refers to the
scandalous delusions of La Salette.He attributes the miracles in question to pecuniary speculation, which
now-a-days, he says, mingles with everything, seizes upon imaginary
facts, and profits by it at the expense of the credulous!He charges the
authors of these things with being GREEDY MEN, who aim at procuring for
themselves DISHONEST GAINS by this traffic in superstitious objects!And
he forbids the publishing from the pulpit, without leave, of any account
of a miracle, even though its authenticity should be attested by another
Bishop!His grace deserves credit for setting his face
against this miserable business, of palming off false miracles upon the
people."[Footnote: Since the above was written, we have met with the following
explanation of this modern miracle:

"A few years ago there was a great stir among 'the simple faithful' in
France, occasioned by a well-credited apparition of the Holy Virgin at
La Salette.She required the erection of a chapel in her honor at that
place, and made such promises of special indulgences to all who paid
their devotions there, that it became 'all the rage' as a place of
pilgrimage.The consequence was, that other shops for the same sort of
wares in that region lost most of their customers, and the good priests
who tended the tills were sorely impoverished.In self-defence, they,
WELL KNOWING HOW SUCH THINGS WERE GOT UP, exposed the trick.A prelate
publicly denounced the imposture, and an Abbe Deleon, priest in the
diocess of Grenoble, printed a work called 'La Salette a Valley of
Lies.'In this publication it was maintained, with proofs, that the hoax
was gotten up by a Mademoiselle de Lamerliere, a sort of half-crazy nun,
who impersonated the character of the Virgin.For the injury done to her
character by this book she sued the priest for damages to the tone of
twenty thousand francs, demanding also the infliction of the utmost
penalty of the law.The court, after a long and careful investigation,
for two days, as we learn by the Catholic Herald, disposed of the case
by declaring the miracle-working damsel non-suited, and condemning her
to pay the expenses of the prosecution."Another of Rome's marvellous stories we copy from the New York Daily
Times of July 3d, 1854.It is from the pen of a correspondent at Rome,
who, after giving an account of the ceremony performed in the church
of St.Peters at the canonization of a NEW SAINT, under the name of
Germana, relates the following particulars of her history.He says, "I
take the facts as they are related in a pamphlet account of her 'life,
virtues, and miracles,' published by authority at Rome:

"Germana Consin was born near the village of Pibrac, in the diocess
of Toulouse, in France.Maimed in one hand, and of a scrofulous
constitution, she excited the hatred of her step-mother, in whose power
her father's second marriage placed her while yet a child.This cruel
woman gave the little Germana no other bed than some vine twigs, lying
under a flight of stairs, which galled her limbs, wearied with the day's
labor.She also persuaded her husband to send the little girl to tend
sheep in the plains, exposed to all extremes of weather.Injuries and
abuse were her only welcome when she returned from her day's task to
her home.To these injuries she submitted with Christian meekness and
patience, and she derived her happiness and consolation from religious
faith.She went every day to church to hear mass, disregarding the
distance, the difficulty of the journey, and the danger in which she
left her flock.The neighboring forest was full of wolves, who devoured
great numbers from other flocks, but never touched a sheep in that of
Germana.To go to the church she was obliged to cross a little river,
which was often flooded, but she passed with dry feet; the waters
flowing away from her on either side: howbeit no one else dared to
attempt the passage.Whenever the signal sounded for the Ave Marie,
wherever she might be in conducting her sheep, even if in a ditch, or in
mud or mire, she kneeled down and offered her devotions to the Queen of
Heaven, nor were her garments wet or soiled.The little children whom
she met in the fields she instructed in the truths of religion.For the
poor she felt the tenderest charity, and robbed herself of her scanty
pittance of bread to feed them.One day her step-mother, suspecting
that she was carrying away from the house morsels of bread to be thus
distributed, incited her husband to look in her apron; he did so, BUT
FOUND IT FULL OF FLOWERS, BEAUTIFUL BUT OUT OF SEASON, INSTEAD OF BREAD.This miraculous conversion of bread into flowers formed the subject
of one of the paintings exhibited in St.Industrious, charitable, patient and forgiving, Germana lived a
memorable example of piety till she passed from earth in the twenty
second year of her age.The night of her death two holy monks were
passing, on a journey, in the neighborhood of her house.Late at night
they saw two celestial virgins robed in white on the road that led to
her habitation; a few minutes afterwards they returned leading between
them another virgin clad in pure white, and with a crown of flowers on
her head."Wonders did not cease with her death.Forty years after this event her
body was uncovered, in digging a grave for another person, and found
entirely uncorrupted--nay, the blood flowed from a wound accidentally
made in her face.Great crowds assembled to see the body so miraculously
preserved, and it was carefully re-interred within the church.There it
lay in place until the French Revolution, when it was pulled up and cast
into a ditch and covered with quick lime and water.But even this
failed to injure the body of the blessed saint.It was found two years
afterward entirely unhurt, and even the grave clothes which surrounded
it were entire, as on the day of sepulture, two hundred years before."And now in the middle of the nineteenth century, these facts are
published for the edification of believers, and his Holiness has set his
seal to their authenticity.Four miracles performed by this saint after
her death are attested by the bull of beatification, and also by Latin
inscriptions in great letters displayed at St.Peter's on the day
of this great celebration.Mary travelled to the office.The monks of the monastery at Bourges, in
France, prayed her to intercede on one occasion, that their store of
bread might be multiplied; on another their store of meal; on both
occasions THEIR PRAYER WAS GRANTED.The other two miracles were cures
of desperate maladies, the diseased persons having been brought to pray
over her tomb."On the splendid scarlet hangings, bearing the arms of Pius IX.and
suspended at the corners of the nave and transept, were two Latin
inscriptions, of similar purport, of one of which I give a translation:
'O Germana, raised to-day to celestial honors by Pius IX.Pontifex
Maximus, since thou knowest that Pius has wept over thy nation wandering
from God, and has exultingly rejoiced at its reconciling itself with God
little by little, he prays thee intimately united with God, do thou, for
thou canst do it, make known his wishes to God, and strengthen them, for
thou art able, with the virtue of thy prayers.'"I have been thus minute in my account of this Beatification, deeming
the facts I state of no little importance and interest, as casting light
upon the character of the Catholicism of the present day, and showing
with what matters the Spiritual and Temporal ruler of Rome is busying
himself in this year of our Lord eighteen hundred and fifty-four."Many other examples similar to the above might be given from the history
of Catholicism as it exists at the present time in the old world.But
let us turn to our own country.We need not look to France or Rome for
examples of priestly intrigue of the basest kind; and absurdities that
almost surpass belief.The following account which we copy from The
American and Foreign Christian Union of August, 1852, will serve to show
that the priests in these United States are quite as willing to impose
upon the ignorant and credulous as, their brethren in other countries.The article is from the pen of an Irish Missionary in the employ of The
American and Foreign Christian Union and is entitled,

   "A LYING WONDER.""It would seem almost incredible," says the editor of this valuable
Magazine, "that any men could be found in this country who are capable
of practising such wretched deceptions.But the account given in the
subjoined statement is too well authenticated to permit us to reject the
story as untrue, however improbable it may, at first sight, seem to be.Editor,--I give you, herein, some information respecting a lying
wonder wrought in Troy, New York, last winter, and respecting the female
who was the 'MEDIUM' of it.I have come to the conclusion that this
female is a Jesuit, after as good an examination as I have been able to
give the matter.I have been fed with these lying wonders in early life,
and in Ireland as well as in this country there are many who, for want
of knowing any better, will feed upon them in their hearts by faith and
thanksgiving.About the time this lying wonder of which I am about to
write happened, I had been talking of it in the office of Mr.Luther, of
Albany, (coal merchant), where were a number of Irish waiting for a job.One of these men declared, with many curses on his soul if what he told
was not true, that he had seen a devil cast out of a woman in his own
parish, in Ireland, by the priest.I told him it would be better for his
character's sake for him to say he heard of it, than to say he SAW it.J. W. Lockwood, a respectable merchant in Troy, New York, and son of
the late mayor, kept two or three young women as 'helps' for his lady,
last winter.The name of one is Eliza Mead, and the name of another is
Catharine Dillon, a native of the county of Limerick, Ireland.Eliza
was an upper servant, who took care of her mistress and her children.Eliza appeared to her mistress to be
a very well educated, and a very intellectual woman of 35, though she
would try to make believe she could not write, and that she was subject
to fits of insanity.There was then presumptive evidence that she wrote
a good deal, and there is now positive evidence that she could write.She used often, in the presence of Mrs.L., to take the Bible and other
books and read them, and would often say she thought the Protestants
had a better religion than the Catholics, and were a better people.L. that she had doubts about the Catholic
religion, and was inclined toward the Protestant: but now she is
sure, quite sure, that the Catholic alone is the right one, FOR IT WAS
REVEALED TO HER.On the evening of the 23d of December, 1851, Eliza and Catharine were
missing;--but I will give you Catharine's affidavit about their business
from home."I, Catharine Dillon, say, that on Tuesday, 23d December inst, about
five o'clock in the afternoon, I went with Eliza Mead to see the priest,
Mr.Eliza remained there till about six
o'clock P. M. At that time I returned home, leaving her at the priest's.At half past eight o'clock the same evening I returned to the priest's
house for Eliza, and waited there for her till about ten o'clock of the
same evening, expecting that Eliza's conference with the priest would be
ended, and that she would come home with me."During the evening there had been another besides Mr.About ten o'clock this other priest retired, as I understood.McDonnel called me, with others, into the room where Eliza was,
when he said that she (Eliza) was POSSESSED OF THE DEVIL Mr.McDonnel
then commenced interrogating the devil, asking the devil if he possessed
her.and the
answer was, "Six months and nine days."The priest then asked, "Who sent
you into her?""When she was asleep," was the answer.Lockwood had ever tempted Catharine, meaning me, and the reply
was, "Yes."Then the question was, "How many times?"And the answer was,
"Three times, by offering her drink when she was asleep?""I came home about five o'clock in the morning, greatly shocked at
what I had seen and heard, and impressed with the belief that Eliza was
possessed with the devil.I went again to the priest's on Wednesday to
find Eliza, when the priest told me that he, Mr.McDonnel, exorcised the
devil at high mass that morning in the church, and drove the devil out
of Eliza.That he, the devil, came out of Eliza, and spat at the Holy
Cross of Jesus Christ, and departed.He then told me that, as Eliza got
the devil from Mr.Lockwood, in the house where I lived, I must leave
the house immediately, and made me promise him that I would.During the
appalling scenes of Tuesday night, Mr.McDonnel went to the other priest
and called him up, but the other priest did not come to his assistance.These answers to the priest when he was asking questions of the devil,
were given in a very loud voice and sometimes with a loud scream.""Subscribed and sworn to, this 31st day of December, 1851, before me,
JOB S. OLIN, Recorder of Troy, New York."J. W. Lockwood and the Rev.McDonnel,
officiating priest at St.James
M. Warren, T. W. Blatchford, M. D., and C. N. Lockwood, on the part of
Mr.McDonnel, on the evening of the 31st December, 1851.McDonnel at first declined answering any questions, questioning Mr.Lockwood's right to ask them: He would only say that Eliza Mead came to
his house possessed, as she thought, with an evil spirit; that at first
he declined having anything to do with her, first, because he believed
her to be crazy; second, because he was at that moment otherwise
engaged; and thirdly, because she was not in his parish; but, by her
urgent appeals in the name of God to pray over her, he was at last
induced to admit her.He became satisfied that she was possessed of the
devil, or an evil spirit, by saying the appointed prayers of the church
over her; for the spirit manifested uneasiness when this was done; and
furthermore, as she was entering the church the following morning, she
was thrown into convulsions by Father Kenny's making the sign of the
cross behind her back.At high mass in the morning he exorcised the
devil, and he left her, spitting at the cross of Christ before taking
his final departure.McDonnel's repeatedly telling Catharine that she must leave
Mr.L's house immediately, for if she remained there Mr.L. would put
the devil in her, Mr.McDonnel denied saying or doing anything whatever
that was detrimental to the character of Mr.McDonnel repeatedly refused to answer the questions put to him by
Mr.L. should visit his house on
such business, as no power on earth but that of the POPE had authority
to question him on such matters.But being reminded that slanderous
reports had emanated from that very house against Mr.McDonnel, said it was all to see what kind of a man he was that brought
Mr.L. there, and if reports were exaggerated, it was nothing to him.McDonnel said that he cleared the church before casting out the
devil, and there was but one person besides himself there.That,
every word spoken in the church was in Latin, and nobody in the church
understood a word of it.L. had said the pretended answers of the devil ware made
through the medium of ventriloquism.Father Kenny, in the progress of
the interview, made two or three attempts to speak, but was prevented by
Mr.'s brother, who was present,
immediately after the interview.It was all Latin in the church, we
see; but the low Irish will not believe that the devil could understand
Latin.However, it was not all Latin at the priest's house, where
Catharine Dillon heard what she declared on oath.How slow the priest
was to admit her (Eliza Mead) in the beginning, and to believe that she
had his sable majesty in her, until it manifested uneasiness under the
cannonade of church prayers!"But you will ask, how could an educated priest, or an intelligent
woman, condescend to such diabolical impositions?I think it is
something after the way that a man gets to be a drunkard; he may not
like the taste thereof at first, but afterwards he will smack his lips
and say, 'there is nothing like whiskey,' and as their food becomes part
of their bodily substance, so are these 'lying wonders' converted into
their spiritual substance.So I think; I am, however, but a very humble
philosopher, and therefore I will use the diction of the Holy Spirit on
the matter: 'For this cause God shall send them strong delusions, that
they should believe a lie,' EVEN OF THEIR OWN MAKING, OR WHAT MAY EASILY
BE SEEN TO BE LIES OF OTHER'S GETTING, "that they all might be damned
who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.'""ALBANY, June 2nd, 1852."It was said by one "that the first temptation on reading such
monstrosities as the above, is to utter a laugh of derision."But it is
with no such feeling that we place them before our readers.Rather would
we exclaim with the inspired penman, "O that my head were waters and
mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night" for the
deluded followers of these willfully blind leaders!Surely, no pleasure
can be found in reading or recording scenes which a pure mind can regard
only with pity and disgust.Yet we desire to prove to our readers that
the absurd threats and foolish attempts to impose upon the weak and
ignorant recorded by Sarah J. Richardson are perfectly consistent
with the general character and conduct of the Romish priests.Read
for instance, the following ridiculous story translated from Le Semeur
Canadien for October 12th, 1855.In the district of Montreal lived a Canadian widow of French extraction
who had become a Protestant.Madam V--, such was the name of this lady,
lived with her daughter, the sole fruit of a union too soon dissolved
by unsparing death.Their life, full of good works, dispelled prejudices
that the inhabitants of the vicinity--all intolerant Catholics--had
always entertained against evangelical Christians; they gained their
respect, moreover, by presenting them the example of every virtue.Two
of the neighbors of the Protestant widow--who had often heard at her
house the word of God read and commented upon by one of those ministers
who visit the scattered members of their communion--talked lately of
embracing the reformed religion.In the mean while, Miss V-- died.The
young Christian rested her hope upon the promises of the Saviour who has
said, "Believe in Christ and thou shall be saved."Her spirit flew to its Creator with the confidence of an infant who
throws himself into the arms of his father.Her last moments were not
tormented by the fear of purgatory, where every Catholic believes he
will suffer for a longer or shorter time.This death strengthened the
neighbors in the resolution they had taken to leave the Catholic church.The widow buried the remains of her daughter upon her own land, a short
distance from her house: the nearest Protestant cemetery was so far off
that she was forced to give up burying it there.Some Catholic fanatics of the vicinity assembled secretly the day after
the funeral of Miss V-- to discuss the best means for arresting the
progress that the reformed religion was making in the parish.After long
deliberation they resolved to hire a poor man to go every evening for
a whole week and groan near the grave of Miss V---.Their object was to
make the widow and neighbors believe that the young girl was damned; and
that God permitted her to show her great unhappiness by lamentations,
so that they might avoid her fate by remaining faithful to the belief of
their fathers.In any other country than Lower Canada, those who might
have employed such means would not perhaps have had an opportunity
of seeing their enterprise crowned with success; but in our country
districts, where the people believe in ghosts and bugbears, it would
almost certainly produce the desired effect.This expedient, instead of
being ridiculous, was atrocious.The employment of it could not fail to
cause Mrs V-- to suffer the most painful agonies, and her neighbors the
torments of doubt.The credulity of the French-Canadian is the work of the clergy; they
invent and relate, in order to excite their piety, the most marvellous
things.For example: the priests say that souls in purgatory desiring
alleviation come and ask masses of their relatives, either by appearing
in the same form they had in life, or by displacing the furniture and
making a noise, as long as they have not terminated the expiation of
their sins.The Catholic clergy, by supporting these fabulous doctrines
and pious lies, lead their flock into the baleful habit of believing
things the most absurd and destitute of proof.The day after Miss V--'s funeral, everybody in the parish was talking of
the woeful cries which had been heard the night before near her grave.The inhabitants of the place, imbued with fantastic ideas that their
rector had kept alive, were dupes of the artifice employed by some of
their own number.They became convinced that there is no safety outside
of the church, of which they formed a part.Seized with horror they
determined never to pass a night near the grave of the cursed one, as
they already called the young Protestant.V-- by the instinctive
effect of prejudices inculcated when she was a Catholic, was at first a
prey to deadly anxiety; but recalling the holy life of her daughter,
she no longer doubted of her being among the number of the elect.She
guessed at the cause of the noise which was heard near the grave of her
child.In order to assure herself of the justness of her suspicions,
she besought the two neighbors of whom I have already spoken, to conceal
themselves there the following night.These persons were glad of an
occasion to test the accuracy of what a curate of their acquaintance had
told them; who had asserted that a spirit free from the body could yet
manifest itself substantially to the living, as speaking without tongue,
touching without hands.They discovered the man who was paid to play the ghost; they seized him,
and in order to punish him, tied him to a tree, at the foot of which
Miss V-- was buried.The poor creature the next morning no longer acted
the soul in torment, but shouted like a person who very much wanted his
breakfast.At noon one of his friends passed by who, hearing him implore
assistance, approached and set him free.Overwhelmed with questions and
derision, the false ghost confessed he had acted thus only to obtain
the reward which had been promised him.You may easily guess that
the ridicule and reprobation turned upon those who had made him their
instrument.I will not finish this narrative without telling the reader that the
curate of the place appeared much incensed at what his parishioners
had done.I am glad to be able to suppose that he condemns rather
than encourages such conduct.A Protestant friend of mine who does not
entertain the same respect for the Roman clergy that I do, advances the
opinion that the displeasure of the curate was not on account of the
culpable attempt of some of his flock but on account of its failure.However, I must add, on my reputation as a faithful narrator, that
nothing has yet happened to confirm his assertion.ERASTE D'ORSONNENS.CRUELTY OF ROMANISTS.To show that the Romish priests have in all ages, and do still, inflict
upon their victims cruelties quite as severe as anything described in
the foregoing pages, and that such cruelties are sanctioned by their
code of laws, we have only to turn to the authentic history of the past
and present transactions of the high functionaries of Rome.About the year 1356, Nicholas Eymeric, inquisitor-general of Arragon,
collected from the civil and canon laws all that related to the
punishment of heretics, and formed the "Directory of Inquisitors," the
first and indeed the fundamental code, which has been followed ever
since, without any essential variation."It exhibits the practice and
theory of the Inquisition at the time of its sanction by the approbation
of Gregory 13th, in 1587, which theory, under some necessary variations
of practice, still remains unchanged."From this "Directory," transcribed by the Rev.Rule of London, in
1852, we extract a few sentences in relation to torture."Torture is inflicted on one who confesses the principal fact, but
varies as to circumstances.Also on one who is reputed to be a heretic,
but against whom there is only one witness of the fact.In this case
common rumor is one indication of guilt, and the direct evidence is
another, making altogether but semi-plenar proof.Also, when there is no witness, but vehement suspicion.Also when there is no common report of heresy, but only one witness
who has heard or seen something in him contrary to the faith.Any two
indications of heresy will justify the use of torture.If you sentence
to torture, give him a written notice in the form prescribed; but other
means be tried first.Nor is this an infallible means for bringing out
the truth.Weak-hearted men, impatient at the first pain, will confess
crimes they never committed, and criminate others at the same time.Bold
and strong ones will bear the most severe torments.Those who have been
on the rack before bear it with more courage, for they know how to adapt
their limbs to it, and they resist powerfully.Others, by enchantments,
seem to be insensible, and would rather die than confess.These wretches
user for incantations, certain passages from the Psalms of David, or
other parts of Scripture, which they write on virgin parchment in an
extravagant way, mixing them with names of unknown angels, with circles
and strange letters, which they wear upon their person.'I know not,'
says Pena, 'how this witchcraft can be remedied, but it will be well to
strip the criminals naked, and search them narrowly, before laying them
upon the rack.'While the tormentor is getting ready, let the inquisitor
and other grave men make fresh attempts to obtain a confession of the
truth.Let the tormentors TERRIFY HIM BY ALL MEANS, TO FRIGHTEN HIM INTO
CONFESSION.And after he is stripped, let the inquisitor take him aside,
and make a last effort.When this has failed, let him be put to the
question by torture, beginning with interrogation on lesser points,
and advancing to greater.If he stands out, let them show him other
instruments of torture, and threaten that he shall suffer them also.If
he will not confess; the torture may be continued on the second or third
day; but as it is not to be repeated, those successive applications must
be called CONTINUATION.And if, after all, he does not confess, he may
be set at liberty."Rules are laid down for the punishment of those who do confess.commanded the secular judges to put heretics to torture; but that
gave occasion to scandalous publicity, and now inquisitors are empowered
to do it, and, in case of irregularity (THAT IS, IF THE PERSON DIES IN
THEIR HANDS), TO ABSOLVE EACH OTHER.And although nobles were exempt
from torture, and in some kingdoms, as Arragon, it was not used in civil
tribunals, the inquisitors were nevertheless authorized to torture,
without restriction, persons of all classes.And here we digress from Eymeric and Pena, in order to describe, from
additional authority, of what this torture consisted, and probably,
still consists, in Italy.Limborch collects this information from Juan
de Rojas, inquisitor at Valencia."There were five degrees of torment as some counted (Eymeric included),
or according to others, three.First, there was terror, including
the threatenings of the inquisitor, leading to the place of torture,
stripping, and binding; the stripping of their clothing, both men and
women, with the substitution of a single tight garment, to cover part
of the person--being an outrage of every feeling of decency--and the
binding, often as distressing as the torture itself.Secondly came the
stretching on the rack, and questions attendant.Thirdly a more severe
shock, by the tension and sodden relaxation of the cord, which is
sometimes given once, but often twice, thrice, or yet more frequently.""Isaac Orobio, a Jewish physician, related to Limborch the manner in
which he had himself been tortured, when thrown into the inquisition at
Seville, on the delation of a Moorish servant, whom he had punished for
theft, and of another person similarly offended."After having been in the prison of the inquisition for full three
years, examined a few times, but constantly refusing to confess the
things laid to his charge, he was at length brought out of the cell,
and led through tortuous passages to the place of torment.He found himself in a subterranean chamber, rather spacious,
arched over, and hung with black cloth.The whole conclave was lighted
by candles in sconces on the walls.At one end there was a separate
chamber, wherein were an inquisitor and his notary seated at a table.The place, gloomy, intent, and everywhere terrible, seemed to be the
very home of death.Hither he was brought, and the inquisitor again
exhorted him to tell the truth before the torture should begin.On his
answering that he had already told the truth, the inquisitor gravely
protested that he was bringing himself to the torture by his own
obstinacy; and that if he should suffer loss of blood, or even expire,
during the question, the holy office would be blameless.Having thus
spoken, the inquisitor left him in the hands of the tormentors, who
stripped him, and compressed his body so tightly in a pair of linen
drawers, that he could no longer draw breath, and must have died, had
they not suddenly relaxed the pressure; but with recovered breathing
came pain unutterably exquisite.The anguish being past, they repeated a
monition to confess the truth, before the torture, as they said, should
begin; and the same was afterwards repeated at each interval."As Orobio persisted in denial, they bound his thumbs so tightly with
small cords that the blood burst from under the nails, and they were
swelled excessively.Then they made him stand against the wall on
a small stool, passed cords around various parts of his body, but
principally around the arms and legs, and carried them over iron
pulleys in the ceiling.The tormentor then pulled the cords with all his
strength, applying his feet to the wall, and giving the weight of his
body to increase the purchase.With these ligatures his arms and legs,
fingers and toes, were so wrung and swollen that he felt as if fire were
devouring them.In the midst of this torment the man kicked down the
stool which had supported his feet, so that he hung upon the cords
with his whole weight, which suddenly increased their tension, and
gave indescribable aggravation to his pain.An instrument resembling a small ladder, consisting of two
parallel pieces of wood, and five transverse pieces, with the anterior
edges sharpened, was placed before him, so that when the tormentor
struck it heavily, he received the stroke five times multiplied on each
shin bone, producing pain that was absolutely intolerable, and under
which he fainted.But no sooner was he revived than they inflicted a new
torture.The tormentor tied other cords around his wrists, and having
his own shoulders covered with leather, that they might not be chafed,
passed round them the rope which was to draw the cords, set his feet
against the wall, threw himself back with all his force, and the cords
cut through to the bones.This he did thrice, each time changing the
position of the cords, leaving a small distance between the successive
wounds; but it happened that in pulling the second time they slipped
into the first wounds, and caused such a gush of blood that Orobio
seemed to be bleeding to death."A physician and surgeon, who were in waiting as usual, to give their
opinion as to the safety or danger of continuing those operations,
that the inquisitors might not commit an irregularity by murdering the
patient, were called in.Being friends of the sufferer, they gave their
opinion that he had strength enough remaining to bear more.By this
means they saved him from a SUSPENSION of the torture, which would have
been followed by a repetition, on his recovery, under the pretext of
CONTINUATION.The cords were therefore pulled a third time, and this
ended the torture.He was dressed in his own clothes, carried back to
prison, and, after about seventy days, when the wounds were healed,
condemned as one SUSPECTED of Judaism.They could not say CONVICTED,
because he had not confessed; but they sentenced him to wear the
sambenito [Footnote: This sambenito (Suco bendito or blessed sack,) is
a garment (or kind of scapulary according to some writers,) worn by
penitents of the least criminal class in the procession of an Auto de
Fe, (a solemn ceremony held by the Inquisition for the punishment of
heretics,) but sometimes worn as a punishment at other times, that the
condemned one might be marked by his neighbors, and ever bear a signal
that would affright and scare by the greatness of the punishment and
disgrace; a plan, salutary it may be, but very grievous to the offender.It was made of yellow cloth, with a St.Andrew's cross upon it, of
red.A rope was sometimes put around the neck as an additional mark of
infamy."Those who were condemned to be burnt were distinguished by a habit of
the same form, called Zamarra, but instead of the red cross were
painted flames and devils, and sometimes an ugly portrait of the heretic
himself,--a head, with flames under it.Those who had been sentenced to
the stake, but indulged with commutation of the penalty, had inverted
flames painted on the livery, and this was called fuego revuelto,
"inverted fire.""Upon the head of the condemned was also placed a conical paper cap,
about three feet high, slightly resembling a mitre, called corona or
crown.This was painted with flames and devils in like manner with the
dress.]or penitential habit for two years, and then be banished for
life from Seville."INQUISITION OF GOA--IMPRISONMENT OF M. DELLON, 1673."M. Dellon a French traveller, spending some time at Damaun, on the
north-western coast of Hindostan, incurred the jealousy of the governor
and a black priest, in regard to a lady, as he is pleased to call
her, whom they both admired.He had expressed himself rather freely
concerning some of the grosser superstitions of Romanism, and thus
afforded the priest, who was also secretary of the Inquisition, an
occasion of proceeding against him as a heretic.The priest and the
governor united in a representation to the chief inquisitor at Goa,
which procured an order for his arrest.Like all other persons whom it
pleased the inquisitors or their servants to arrest, in any part of the
Portuguese dominions beyond the Cape of Good Hope, he was thrown into
prison with a promiscuous crowd of delinquents, the place and treatment
being of the worst kind, even according to the colonial barbarism of
the seventeenth century.To describe his sufferings there, is not to our
purpose, inasmuch as all prisoners fared alike, many of them perishing
from starvation and disease.Many offenders against the Inquisition
were there at the same time,--some accused of Judaism, others, of
Paganism--in which sorcery and witchcraft were included--and others of
immorality.In a field so wide and so fruitful, the "scrutators" of the
faith could not fail to gather abundantly.After an incarceration of at
least four months, he and his fellow-sufferers were shipped off for
the ecclesiastical metropolis of India, all of them being in irons.The
vessel put into Bacaim, and the prisoners were transferred, for some
days, to the prison of that town, where a large number of persons were
kept in custody, under charge of the commissary of the holy office,
until a vessel should arrive to carry them to Goa."In due time they were again at sea, and a fair wind wafted their
fleet into that port after a voyage of seven days.Until they could
be deposited in the cells of the Inquisition with the accustomed
formalities, the Archbishop of Goa threw open HIS prison for their
reception, which prison, being ecclesiastical, may be deemed worthy of
description."The most filthy," says Dellon, "the most dark, and the most horrible
that I ever saw; and I doubt whether a more shocking and horrible prison
can be found anywhere.It is a kind of cave wherein there is no day seen
but by a very little hole; the most subtle rays of the sun cannot enter
into it, and there is never any true light in it.* * *

"On the 16th of January 1674, at eight o'clock in the morning, an
officer came with orders to take the prisoners to "the holy house."With
considerable difficulty M. Dellon dragged his iron-loaded limbs thither.They helped him to ascend the stairs at the great entrance, and in the
hall, smiths were waiting to take off the irons from all the prisoners.One by one, they were summoned to audience.Dellon, who was called the
first, crossed the hall, passed through an ante-chamber, and entered
a room, called by the Portuguese "board of the holy office," where the
grand inquisitor of the Indies sat at one end of a very large table, on
an elevated floor in the middle of the chamber.He was a secular priest
about forty years of age, in full vigor--a man who could do his work
with energy.At one end of the room was a large crucifix, reaching from
the floor almost to the ceiling, and near it, sat a notary on a folding
stool.At the opposite end, and near the inquisitor, Dellon was placed,
and, hoping to soften his judge, fell on his knees before him.But the
inquisitor commanded him to rise, asked whether he knew the reason of
his arrest, and advised him to declare it at large, as that was the only
way to obtain a speedy release.Dellon caught at the hope of release,
began to tell his tale, mixed with tears and protestations, again
fell at the feet of Don Francisco Delgado Ematos, the inquisitor, and
implored his favorable attention.Don Francisco told him, very coolly,
that he had other business on hand, and, nothing moved, rang a silver
bell.The alcayde entered, led the prisoner out into a gallery, opened,
and searched his trunk, stripped him of every valuable, wrote an
inventory, assured him that all should be safely kept, and then led him
to a cell about ten feet square, and left him there, shut up in utter
solitude.In the evening they brought him his first meal, which he ate
heartily, and slept a little during the night following.Next morning he
learnt that he could have no part of his property, not even a breviary
was, in that place, allowed to a priest, for they had no form of
religion there, and for that reason he could not have a book.His hair
was cropped close; and therefore "he did not need a comb.""Thus began his acquaintance with the holy house, which he describes
as "great and magnificent," on one side of the great space before the
church of St Catharine.There were three gates in front; and, it was
by the central, or largest, that the prisoners entered, and mounted a
stately flight of steps, leading into the great hall.The side gates
provided entrance to spacious ranges of apartments, belonging to the
inquisitors.Behind the principal building, was another, very spacious,
two stories high, and consisting of double rows of cells, opening into
galleries that ran from end to end.The cells on the ground-floor were
very small, without any aperture from without for light or air.Those of
the upper story were vaulted, white-washed, had a small strongly grated
window, without glass, and higher than the tallest man could reach.Towards the gallery every cell was shut with two doors, one on the
inside, the other one outside of the wall.The inner door folded, was
grated at the bottom, opened towards the top for the admission of food
and was made fast with very strong bolts.The outer door was not so
thick, had no window, but was left open from six o'clock every morning
until eleven--a necessary arrangement in that climate, unless it were
intended to destroy life by suffocation."To each prisoner was given as earthen pot with water wherewith to wash,
another full of water to drink, with a cup; a broom, a mat whereon
to lie, and a large basin with a cover, changed every fourth day.The
prisoners had three meals a day; and their health so far as food could
contribute to it in such a place, was cared for in the provision of
a wholesome, but spare diet.Physicians were at hand to render all
necessary assistance to the sick, as were confessors, ready to wait
upon the dying; but they gave no viaticum, performed no unction, said
no mass.The place was under an impenetrable interdict.If any died,
and that many did die is beyond question, his death was unknown to all
without; he was buried within the walls without any sacred ceremony;
and if, after death, he was found to have died in heresy, his bones were
taken up at the next Auto, to be burned.Unless there happened to be
an unusual number of prisoners, each one was alone in his own cell.He
might not speak, nor groan, nor sob aloud, nor sigh.[Footnote: Limborch
relates that on one occasion, a poor prisoner was heard to cough; the
jailer of the Inquisition instantly repaired to him, and warned him to
forbear, as the slightest noise was not tolerated in that house.The
poor man replied that it was not in his power to forbear; a second time
they admonished him to desist; and when again, unable to do otherwise,
he repeated the offence, they stripped him naked, and cruelly beat him.This increased his cough, for which they beat him so often, that at last
he died through pain and anguish of the stripes he had received.]His
breathing might be audible when the guard listened at the grating, but
nothing more.Four guards were stationed in each long gallery, open,
indeed, at each end, but awfully silent, as if it were the passage of
a catacomb.If, however, he wanted anything, he might tap at the inner
door, when a jailer would come to hear the request, and would report to
the alcayde, but was not permitted to answer.If one of the victims, in
despair, or pain, or delirium, attempted to pronounce a prayer, even to
God, or dared to utter a cry, the jailers would run to the cell, rush
in, and beat him cruelly, for terror to the rest.Once in two months the
inquisitor, with a secretary and an interpreter, visited the prisons,
and asked each prisoner if he wanted anything, if his meat was regularly
brought, and if he had any complaint against the jailers.His want after
all lay at the mercy of the merciless.His complaint, if uttered, would
bring down vengeance, rather than gain redress.But in this visitation
the holy office professed mercy with much formality, and the
inquisitorial secretary collected notes which aided in the crimination,
or in the murder of their victims."The officers of Goa were;--the inquisidor mor or grand inquisitor, who
was always a secular priest; the second inquisitor, Dominican friar;
several deputies, who came, when called for, to assist the inquisitors
at trials, but never entered without such a summons; qualifiers,
as usual, to examine books and writings, but never to witness an
examination of the living, or be present at any act of the kind; a
fiscal; a procurator; advocates, so called, for the accused; notaries
and familiars.The authority of this tribunal was absolute in Goa.There does not appear to have been anything peculiar in the manner of
examining and torturing at Goa where the practice coincided with that of
Portugal and Spain."The personal narrative of Dellon affords a distinct exemplification of
the sufferings of the prisoners.He had been told that, when he desired
an audience, he had only to call a jailer, and ask it, when it would be
allowed him.But, notwithstanding many tears and entreaties, he could
not obtain one until fifteen days had passed away.Then came the alcayde
and one of his guards.This alcayde walked first out of the cell; Dellon
uncovered and shorn, and with legs and feet bare, followed him; the
guard walked behind.The alcayde just entered the place of audience,
made a profound reverence, stepped back and allowed his charge to enter.The door closed, and Dellon remained alone with the inquisitor and
secretary.He knelt; but Don Fernando sternly bade him to sit on a
bench, placed there for the use of the culprits.Near him, on a table,
lay a missal, on which they made him lay his hand, and swear to keep
secrecy, and tell them the truth.They asked if he knew the cause of his
imprisonment, and whether he was resolved to confess it.He told
them all he could recollect of unguarded sayings at Damaun, either in
argument or conversation, without ever, that he knew, contradicting,
directly or indirectly, any article of faith.He had, at some time
dropped an offensive word concerning the Inquisition, but so light a
word, that it did not occur to his remembrance.Don Fernando told him he
had done well in ACCUSING HIMSELF so willingly, and exhorted him in the
name of Jesus Christ, to complete his self accusation fully, to the end
that he might experience the goodness and mercy which were used in
that tribunal towards those who showed true repentance by a sincere
and UNFORCED confession.The secretary read aloud the confession and
exhortation, Dellon signed it, Don Fernando rang a silver bell, the
alcayde walked in, and, in a few moments, the disappointed victim was
again in his dungeon."At the end of another fortnight, and without having asked for it, he
was again taken to audience.After a repetition of the former questions,
he was asked his name, surname, baptism, confirmation, place of abode,
in what parish?They made him kneel,
and make the sign of the cross, repeat the Pater Noster, Hail Mary,
creed, commandments of God, commandments of the church, and Salve
Begins.He did it all very cleverly, and even to their satisfaction;
but the grand inquisitor exhorted him, by the tender mercies of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to confess without delay, and sent him to the cell again.They required him to do what was impossible--to
confess more, after he had acknowledged ALL.In despair, he tried to
starve himself to death; 'but they compelled him to take food.'Day and
night he wept, and at length betook himself to prayer, imploring pity
of the 'blessed Virgin,' whom he imagined to be, of all beings, the most
merciful, and the most ready to give him help."At the end of a month, he succeeded in obtaining another audience, and
added to his former confessions what he had remembered, for the first
time, touching the Inquisition.But they told him that that was not what
they wanted, and sent him back again.In a frenzy
of despair he determined to commit suicide, if possible.Feigning
sickness, be obtained a physician who treated him for a fever, and
ordered him to be bled.Never calmed by any treatment of the physician,
blood-letting was repeated often, and each time he untied the bandage,
when left alone, hoping to die from loss of blood, but death fled from
him.A humane Franciscan came to confess him, and, hearing his tale of
misery, gave him kind words, asked permission to divulge his attempt
at self-destruction to the inquisitor, procured him a mitigation of
solitude by the presence of a fellow-prisoner, a <DW64>, accused of
magic; but, after five months, the <DW64> was removed, and his mind,
broken with suffering, could no longer bear up under the aggravated
load.By an effort of desperate ingenuity he almost succeeded in
committing suicide, and a jailer found him weltering in his blood and
insensible.Having restored him by cordials, and bound up his wounds,
they carried him into the presence of the inquisitor once more; where he
lay on the floor, being unable to sit, heard bitter reproaches, had his
limbs confined in irons, and was thus carried back to a punishment that
seemed more terrible than death.In fetters he became so furious, that
they found it necessary to take them off, and, from that time, his
examinations assumed another character, as he defended his positions
with citations from the Council of Trent, and with some passages of
scripture, which he explained in the most Romish sense, discovering
a depth of ignorance in Don Fernando that was truly surprising.That
'grand Inquisitor,' had never heard the passage which Dellon quoted to
prove the doctrine of baptismal regeneration, 'Except a man be born
of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.'Neither did he know anything of that famous passage in the twenty-fifth
session of the Council of Trent, which declares that images are only to
be reverenced on account of the persons whom they represent.He
called for a Bible, and for the acts of the council, and was evidently
surprised when he found them where Dellon told him they might be seen."The time for a general auto drew near.During the months of November
and December, 1675, he heard every morning the cries of persons under
torture, and afterwards saw many of them, both men and women, lame and
distorted by the rack.On Sunday January 11th, 1676, he was surprised
by the jailer refusing to receive his linen to be washed--Sunday being
washing-day in the 'holy house.'While perplexing himself to think
what that could mean, the cathedral bells rang for vespers, and then,
contrary to custom, rang again for matins.He could only account for
that second novelty by supposing that an auto would be celebrated the
next day.Sandra moved to the bathroom.They brought him supper, which he refused, and, contrary to
their wont at all other times, they did not insist on his taking it, but
carried it away.Assured that those were all portents of the horrible
catastrophe, and reflecting on often-repeated threats in the audience
chamber that he should be burnt, he gave himself up to death, and
overwhelmed with sorrow, fell asleep a little before midnight."Scarcely had he fallen asleep when the alcayde and guards entered the
cell, with great noise, bringing a lamp, for the first time since his
imprisonment that they had allowed a lamp to shine there.The alcayde,
laying down a suit of clothes, bade him put them on, and be ready to go
out when he came again.At two o'clock in the morning they returned, and
he issued from the cell, clad in a black vest and trowsers, striped with
white, and his feet bare.About two hundred prisoners, of whom he
was one, were made to sit on the floor, along the sides of a spacious
gallery, all in the same black livery, and just visible by the
gleaming of a few lamps.A large company of women were also ranged in a
neighboring gallery in like manner.But they were all motionless, and
no one knew his doom.Every eye was fixed, and each one seemed benumbed
with misery."A third company Dellon perceived in a room not far distant, but they
were walking about, and some appeared to have long habits.Those were
persons condemned to be delivered to the secular arm, and the long
habits distinguished confessors busily collecting confessions in order
to commute that penalty for some other scarcely less dreadful.At four
o'clock, servants of the house came, with guards, and gave bread and
figs to those who would accept the refreshment.One of the guards gave
Dellon some hope of life by advising him to take what was offered,
which he had refused to do.'Take your bread,' said the man, 'and if you
cannot eat it now, put it in your pocket; you will be certainly hungry
before you return.'This gave hope, that he should not end the day at
the stake, but come back to undergo penance."A little before sunrise, the great bell of the cathedral tolled, and
its sound soon aroused the city of Goa.The people ran into the streets,
lining the chief thoroughfares, and crowding every place whence a view
could be had of the procession.Day broke, and Dellon saw the faces
of his fellow-prisoners, most of whom were Indians.He could only
distinguish, by their complexion, about twelve Europeans.Every
countenance exhibited shame, fear, grief, or an appalling blackness of
apathy, AS IF DIRE SUFFERING IN THE LIGHTLESS DUNGEONS UNDERNEATH HAD
BEREFT THEM OF INTELLECT.The company soon began to move, but slowly,
as one by one the alcayde led them towards the door of the great hall,
where the grand inquisitor sat, and his secretary called the name of
each as he came, and the name of a sponsor, who also presented himself
from among a crowd of the bettermost inhabitants of Goa, assembled there
for that service.'The general of the Portuguese ships in the Indies'
had the honor of placing himself beside our Frenchman.As soon as the
procession was formed, it marched off in the usual order."First, the Dominicans, honored with everlasting precedence on all such
occasions, led the way.Singing-boys also preceded, chanting a litany.The banner of the Inquisition was intrusted to their hands.After the
banner walked the penitents--a penitent and a sponsor, two and two.A
cross bearer brought up the train, carrying a crucifix aloft, turned
towards them, in token of pity; and, on looking along the line, you
might have seen another priest going before the penitents with a
crucifix turned backwards, inviting their devotions.They to whom the
Inquisition no longer afforded mercy, walked behind the penitents, and
could only see an averted crucifix.These were condemned to be burnt
alive at the stake!On this occasion there were but two of this class,
but sometimes a large number were sentenced to this horrible death, and
presented to the spectator a most pitiable spectacle.Many of them
bore upon their persons the marks of starvation, torture, terror, and
heart-rending grief.Some faces were bathed in tears, while others
came forth with a smile of conquest on the countenance and words of
triumphant faith bursting from the lips.These, however, were known as
dogmatizers, and were generally gagged, the month being filled with a
piece of wood kept in by a strong leather band fastened behind the head,
and the arms tied together behind the back.Two armed familiars walked
or rode beside each of these, and two ecclesiastics, or some other
clerks or regulars, also attended.After these, the images of heretics
who had escaped were carried aloft, to be thrown into the flames; and
porters came last, tagging under the weight of boxes containing the
disinterred bodies on which the execution of the church had fallen, and
which were also to be burnt."Poor Dellon went barefoot, like the rest, through the streets of Goa,
rough with little flint stones scattered about, and sorely were his feet
wounded during an hour's march up and down the principal streets.Weary,
covered with shame and confusion, the long train of culprits entered
the church of St.Francis, where preparation was made for the auto, the
climate of India not permitting a celebration of that solemnity
under the burning sky.They sat with their sponsors, in the galleries
prepared, sambenitos, grey zamarras with painted flames and devils,
corozas, tapers, and all the other paraphernalia of an auto, made up a
woeful spectacle.The inquisitor and other personages having taken their
seats of state, the provincial of the Augustinians mounted the pulpit
and delivered the sermon.Dellon preserved but one note of it.The
preacher compared the Inquisition to Noah's ark, which received all
sorts of beasts WILD, but sent them out TAME.The appearance of hundreds
who had been inmates of that ark certainly justified the figure."After the sermon, two readers went up, one after the other, into the
same pulpit, and, between them, they read the processes and pronounced
the sentences, the person standing before them, with the alcayde, and
holding a lighted taper in his hand.Dellon, in turn, heard the cause
of his long-suffering.He had maintained the invalidity of baptismus
flaminis, or desire to be baptised, when there is no one to administer
the rite of baptism by water.He had said that images ought not to be
adored, and that an ivory crucifix was a piece of ivory.He had spoken
contemptuously of the Inquisition.And, above all, he had an ill
intention.His punishment was to be confiscation of his property,
banishment from India, and five years' service in the galleys in
Portugal, with penance, as the inquisitors might enjoin.As all the
prisoners were excommunicate, the inquisitor, after the sentence had
been pronounced, put on his alb and stole, walked into the middle of the
church, and absolved them all at once.Dellon's sponsor, who would not
even answer him before, when he spoke, now embraced him, called him
brother, and gave him a pinch of snuff, in token of reconciliation."But there were two persons, a man and a woman, for whom the church had
no more that they could do; and these, with four dead bodies, and the
effigies of the dead, were taken to be burnt on the Campo Santo Lazaro,
on the river side, the place appointed for that purpose, that the
viceroy might see justice done on the heretics, as he surveyed the
execution from his palace-windows."The remainder of Dellon's history adds nothing to what we have already
heard of the Inquisition.He was taken to Lisbon, and, after working in
a gang of convicts for some time, was released on the intercession of
some friends in France with the Portuguese government.With regard to
his despair, and attempts to commit suicide, when in the holy house,
we may observe that, as he states, suicide was very frequent there.The contrast of his disconsolate impatience with the resignation and
constancy of Christian confessors in similar circumstances, is obvious.As a striking illustration of the difference between those who suffer
without a consciousness of divine favor, and those who rejoice with joy
unspeakable and full of glory, we would refer the reader to that noble
band of martyrs who suffered death at the stake, at the Auto held in
Seville, on Sunday, September 24, 1559.At that time twenty-one
were burnt, followed by one effigy, and eighteen penitents, who were
released."One of the former was Don Juan Gonzales, Presbyter of Seville, an
eminent preacher.With admirable constancy he refused to make any
declaration, in spite of the severe torture, saying that he had not
followed any erroneous opinions, but that he had drawn his faith from
the holy Scriptures; and for this faith he pleaded to his tormentors in
the words of inspiration.He maintained that he was not a heretic, but
a Christian, and absolutely refused to divulge anything that would bring
his brethren into trouble.Two sisters of his were also brought out to
this Auto, and displayed equal faith.They would confess Christ, they
said, and suffer with their brother, whom they revered as a wise and
holy man.They were all tied to stakes on the quemadero, a piece of
pavement, without the walls of the city, devoted to the single use of
burning human victims.Sometimes this quemadero [Footnote: Llorente, the
historian of the Spanish Inquisition, says, "So many persons were to be
put to death by fire, the governor of Seville caused a permanent raised
platform of masonry to be constructed outside the city, which has
lasted to our time (until the French revolution) retaining its name of
Quemadero, or burning-place, and at the four corners four large hollow
stalutes of limestone, within which they used to place the impenitent
alive, that they might die by slow fires."]was a raised platform of
stone, adorned with pillows or surrounded with statues, to distinguish
and beautify the spot.Just as the fire was lit, the gag, which had
hitherto silenced Don Juan, was removed, and as the flames burst from
the fagots, he said to his sisters, 'Let us sing, Deus laudem meam ne
tacueris.'And they sang together, while burning, 'Hold not thy peace,
O God of my praise; for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the
deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a
lying tongue.'Thus they died in the faith of Christ, and of his holy
gospel."INQUISITION OF GOA, CONCLUDED.The Inquisition of Goa continued its Autos for a century after the
affair of Dellon.Claudius Buchanan visited
that city, and had been unexpectedly invited by Joseph a Doloribus,
second and most active inquisitor, to lodge with him during his
visit.Buchanan found himself, heretic,
schismatic, and rebel as he was, politely entertained by so dread a
personage.Regarding his English visitor merely as a literary man, or
professing to do so, Friar Joseph, himself well educated, seemed to
enjoy his company, and was unreservedly communicative on every subject
not pertaining to his own vocation.When that subject was first
introduced by an apparently incidental question, he did not hesitate
to return the desired information, telling Dr.Buchanan that the
establishment was nearly as extensive as in former times.In the library
of the chief inquisitor he saw a register containing the names of all
the officers, who still were numerous.On the second evening after his arrival, the doctor was surprised to see
his host come from his apartment, clothed in black robes from head to
foot, instead of white, the usual color of his order (Augustinian).He
said that he was going to sit on the tribunal of the holy office, and it
transpired that, so far from his "august office" not occupying much of
his time, he had to sit there three or four days every week.After his
return, in the evening, the doctor put Dellon's book into his hand,
asking him if he had ever seen it.He had never seen it before, and,
after reading aloud and slowly, "Relation de l'Inquisition de Goa,"
began to peruse it with eagerness.Buchanan employed himself in writing, Friar Joseph devoured
page after page; but as the narrative proceeded, betrayed evident
symptoms of uneasiness.He then turned to the middle, looked at the end,
skimmed over the table of contents, fixed on its principal passages,
and at one place exclaimed, in his broad Italian accent, "Mendacium!The doctor requested him to mark the passages that were
untrue, proposed to discuss them afterwards, and said he had other books
on the subject.The mention of other books startled him; he looked up
anxiously at some books on the table, and then gave himself up to the
perusal of Dellon's "Relation," until bedtime.Even then, he asked
permission to take it to his chamber.The doctor had fallen asleep under the roof of the inquisitor's convent,
confident, under God, in the protection at that time guaranteed to
a British subject, his servants sleeping in the gallery outside
the chamber-door.About midnight, he was waked by loud shrieks and
expressions of terror from some one in the gallery.In the first moment
of surprise, he concluded it must be the alguazils of the holy office
seizing his servants to carry them to the Inquisition.But, on going
out, he saw the servants standing at the door, and the person who
had caused the alarm, a boy of about fourteen, at a little distance,
surrounded by some of the priests, who had come out of their cells on
hearing the noise.The boy said he had seen a spectre; and it was a
considerable time before the agitations of his body and voice
subsided.Next morning at breakfast, the inquisitor apologized for
the disturbance, and said the boy's alarm proceeded from a phantasma
animi,--phantom of the imagination.Phantoms might well haunt such a place.As to
Dellon's book, the inquisitor acknowledged that the descriptions
were just; but complained that he had misjudged the motives of the
inquisitors, and written uncharitably of Holy Church.Their conversation
grew earnest, and the inquisitor was anxious to impress his visitor with
the idea that the Inquisition had undergone a change in some respects,
and that its terrors were mitigated.Buchanan plainly
requested to see the Inquisition, that he might judge for himself as to
the humanity shown to the inmates,--according to the inquisitor,--and
gave, as a reason why he should be satisfied, his interest in the
affairs of India, on which he had written, and his purpose to write on
them again, in which case he could scarcely be silent concerning the
Inquisition.The countenance of his host fell; but, after some further
observations, he reluctantly promised to comply.Next morning, after
breakfast, Joseph a Doloribus went to dress for the holy office, and
soon returned in his black robes.He said he would go half an hour
before the usual time, for the purpose of showing him the Inquisition.The doctor fancied he looked more severe than usual, and that his
attendants were not as civil as before.But the truth was, that the
midnight scene still haunted him.They had proceeded in their palanquins
to the holy house, distant about a quarter of a mile from the convent,
and the inquisitor said as they were ascending the steps of the great
entrance, that he hoped the doctor would be satisfied with a transient
view of the Inquisition, and would retire when he should desire him to
do so.The doctor followed with tolerable confidence, towards the
great hall aforementioned, where they were met by several well-dressed
persons, familiars, as it afterwards appeared, who bowed very low to the
inquisitor, and looked with surprise at the stranger.Buchanan paced
the hall slowly, and in thoughtful silence; the inquisitor thoughtful
too, silent and embarrassed.A multitude of victims seemed to haunt the
place, and the doctor could not refrain from breaking silence."Would
not the Holy Church wish, in her mercy, to have those souls back again,
that she might allow them a little further probation?"The inquisitor
answered nothing, but beckoned him to go with him to a door at one end
of the hall.By that door he conducted him to some small rooms, and
thence, to the spacious apartments of the chief inquisitor.Having
surveyed those, he brought him back again to the great hall, and seemed
anxious that the troublesome visitor should depart; but only the very
words of Dr.B. can adequately describe the close of this extraordinary
interview.""Now, father," said I, "lead me to the dungeons below: I want to see the
captives.""No," said he, "that cannot be."I now began to suspect that
it had been in the mind of the inquisitor, from the beginning, to show
me only a certain part of the Inquisition, in the hope of satisfying
my inquiries in a general way.I urged him with earnestness; but he
steadily resisted, and seemed offended, or, rather, agitated, by my
importunity.I intimated to him plainly, that the only way to do justice
to his own assertion and arguments regarding the present state of the
Inquisition, was to show me the prisons and the captives.I should
then describe only what I saw; but now the subject was left in awful
obscurity."Lead me down," said I, "to the inner building, and let me
pass through the two hundred dungeons, ten feet square, described by
your former captives.Let me count the number of your present captives,
and converse with them.I WANT, TO SEE IF THERE BE ANY SUBJECTS OF THE
BRITISH GOVERNMENT, TO WHOM WE OWE PROTECTION.I want to ask how long
they have been there, how long it is since they have seen the light
of the sun, and whether they ever expect to see it again.Show me the
chamber of torture, and declare what modes of execution or punishment
are now practiced inside the walls of the Inquisition, in lieu of the
public Auto de Fe.If, after all that has passed, father, you resist
this reasonable request, I should be justified in believing that you are
afraid of exposing the real state of the Inquisition in India."To these observations the inquisitor made no reply; but seemed impatient
that I should withdraw."My good father," said I; "I am about to take
my leave of you, and to thank you for your hospitable attentions; and I
wish to preserve on my mind a favorable sentiment of your kindness and
candor.You cannot, you say, show me the captives and the dungeons; be
pleased, then, merely to answer this question, for I shall believe
your word: how many prisoners are there now below in the cells of the
Inquisition?"He replied, "That is a question which I cannot answer."On his pronouncing these words, I retired hastily towards the door, and
wished him farewell.We shook hands with as much cordiality as we could,
at the moment, assume; and both of us, I believe, were sorry that our
parting took place with a clouded countenance.Buchanan, feeling as if he could
not refrain from endeavoring to get another and perhaps a nearer view,
returned to avail himself of the pretext afforded by a promise from
the chief inquisitor, of a letter to one of the British residents at
Travancore, in answer to one which he had brought him from that officer.The inquisitors he expected to find within, in the "board of the holy
office."The door-keepers surveyed him doubtfully, but allowed him to
pass.He entered the great hall, went up directly to the lofty crucifix
described by Dellon, sat down on a form, wrote some notes, and then
desired an attendant to carry in his name to the inquisitor.As he was
walking across the hall, he saw a poor woman sitting by the wall.She
clasped her hands, and looked at him imploringly.The sight chilled
his spirits; and as he was asking the attendants the cause of her
apprehension,--for she was awaiting trial,--Joseph a Doloribus came, in
answer to his message, and was about to complain of the intrusion,
when he parried the complaint by asking for the letter from the chief
inquisitor.He promised to send it after him, and conducted him to the
door.As they passed the poor woman, the doctor pointed to her, and said
with emphasis, "Behold, father, another victim of the Holy Inquisition."The other answered nothing; they bowed, and separated without a word.Buchanan published his "Christian Researches in Asia," in the
year 1812, the Inquisition still existed at Goa; but the establishment
of constitutional government in Portugal, put an end to it throughout
the whole Portuguese dominions.APPENDIX V.

INQUISITION AT MACERATA, ITALY.I never pretended that it was for the sake of religion alone, that I
left Italy, On the contrary, I have often declared, that, had I never
belonged to the Inquisition, I should have gone on, as most Roman
Catholics do, without ever questioning the truth of the religion I was
brought up in, or thinking of any other.But the unheard of cruelties
of that hellish tribunal shocked me beyond all expression, and rendered
me,--as I was obliged, by my office of Counsellor, to be accessary to
them,--one of the most unhappy men upon earth.I therefore began
to think of resigning my office; but as I had on several occasions,
betrayed some weakness as they termed it, that is, some compassion and
humanity, and had upon that account been reprimanded by the Inquisitor,
I was well apprized that my resignation would be ascribed by him to
my disapproving the proceedings of the holy tribunal.And indeed, to
nothing else could it be ascribed, as a place at that board was a
sure way to preferment, and attended with great privileges, and a
considerable salary.Being, therefore, sensible how dangerous a thing it
would be to give the least ground for any suspicions of that nature,
and no longer able to bear the sight of the many barbarities practised
almost daily within those walls, nor the reproaches of my conscience for
being accessary to them, I determined, after many restless nights, and
much deliberation, to withdraw at the same time from the Inquisition,
and from Italy.In this mind, and in the most unhappy and tormenting
situation that can possibly be imagined, I continued near a
twelve-month, not able to prevail on myself to execute the resolution
I had taken on account of the many dangers which I foresaw would
inevitably attend it, and the dreadful consequences of my failing in
the attempt.But, being in the mean time ordered by the Inquisitor, to
apprehend a person with whom I had lived in the greatest intimacy and
friendship, the part I was obliged to act on that occasion, left so deep
an impression on my mind as soon prevailed over all my fears, and made
me determine to put into execution, at all events, and without delay,
the design I had formed.Of that transaction I shall give a particular
account, as it will show in a very strong light the nature and
proceedings of that horrid court.The person whom the Inquisitor appointed me to apprehend was Count
Vicenzo della Torre, descended from an illustrious family in Germany,
and possessed of a very considerable estate in the territory of
Macerata.He was one of my very particular friends, and had lately
married the daughter of Signior Constantini, of Fermo, a lady no less
famous for her good sense than her beauty.With her family too, I had
contracted an intimate acquaintance, while Professor of Rhetoric in
Fermo, and had often attended the Count during his courtship, from
Macerata to Fermo, but fifteen miles distant.I therefore lived with
both in the greatest friendship and intimacy; and the Count was the
only person that lived with me, after I was made Counsellor of the
Inquisition, upon the same free footing as he had done till that time.My other friends had grown shy of me, and gave me plainly to understand
that they no longer cared for my company.As this unhappy young gentleman was one day walking with another, he met
two Capuchin friars, and turning to his companion, when they had passed,
"what fools," said he, "are these, to think they shall gain heaven by
wearing sackcloth and going barefoot!Fools indeed, if they think so,
or that there is any merit in tormenting one's self; they might as well
live as we do, and they would get to heaven quite as soon."Who informed
against him, whether the friars, his companion, or somebody else, I
know not; for the inquisitors never tell the names of informers to the
Counsellors, nor the names of the witnesses, lest they should except
against them.It is to be observed, that all who hear any proposition
that appears to them repugnant to, or inconsistent with the doctrines of
holy mother church, are bound to reveal it to the Inquisitor, and also
to discover the person by whom it was uttered; and, in this affair no
regard is to be had to any ties, however sacred.The brother being bound
to accuse the brother, the father the son, the son the father, the wife
her husband, and the husband his wife; and all bound on pain of eternal
damnation, and of being treated as accomplices if they do not denounce
in a certain time; and no confessor can absolve a person who has heard
anything said in jest or in earnest, against the belief or practice
of the church, till that person has informed the Inquisitor of it, and
given him all the intelligence he can concerning the person by whom it
was spoken.Whoever it was that informed against my unhappy friend, whether the
friars, his companion, or somebody else who might have overheard him,
the Inquisitor acquainted the board one night, (for to be less observed,
they commonly meet, out of Rome, in the night) that the above mentioned
propositions had been advanced, and advanced gravely, at the sight of
two poor Capuchins; that the evidence was unexceptionable; and that
they were therefore met to determine the quality of the proposition, and
proceed against the delinquent.There are in each Inquisition twelve Counsellors, viz: four Divines,
four Canonists, and four Civilians.It is chiefly the province of the
divines to determine the quality of the proposition, whether it is
heretical, or only savors of heresy; whether it is blasphemous and
injurious to God and His saints or only erroneous, rash, schismatical,
or offensive to pious ears.The part of the proposition, "Fools!if
they think there is any merit in tormenting one's self," was judged and
declared heretical, as openly contradicting the doctrine and practice of
holy mother church recommending austerities as highly meritorious.The
Inquisitor observed, on this occasion, that by the proposition, "Fools
indeed" &c., were taxing with folly, not only the holy fathers, who had
all to a man practised great austerities, but St.Paul himself as the
Inquisitor understood it, adding that the practice of whipping one's
self, so much recommended by all the founders of religious orders, was
borrowed of the great apostle of the gentiles.The proposition being declared heretical, it was unanimously agreed by
the board that the person who had uttered it should be apprehended, and
proceeded against agreeably to the laws of the Inquisition.And now the
person was named; for, till it is determined whether the accused person
should or should not be apprehended, his name is kept concealed from
the counsellors, lest they should be biased, says the directory, in
his favor, or against him.For, in many instances, they keep up an
appearance of justice and equity, at the same time that, in truth, they
act in direct opposition to all the known laws of justice and equity.No words can express the concern and astonishment it gave me to hear,
on such an occasion, the name of a friend for whom I had the greatest
esteem and regard.The Inquisitor was apprised of it; and to give me an
opportunity of practising what he had so often recommended to me, viz.conquering nature with the assistance of grace, he appointed me to
apprehend the criminal, as he styled him, and to lodge him safe, before
daylight, in the prison of the holy inquisition.I offered to excuse
myself, but with the greatest submission, from being in any way
concerned in the execution of that order; an order, I said, which I
entirely approved of, but only wished it might be put in execution by
some other person; for your lordship knows, I said, the connection.But
the Inquisitor shocked at the word, said with a stern look and angry
tone of voice, "What!There is your guard," (pointing to the Sbirri or bailiffs in waiting)
"let the criminal be secured in St.Luke's cell," (one of the worst,)
"before three in the morning."He then withdrew, and as he passed me
said, "Thus, nature is conquered."I had betrayed some weakness or sense
of humanity, not long before, in fainting away while I attended the
torture of one who was racked with the utmost barbarity, and I had on
that occasion been reprimanded by the Inquisitor for suffering nature
to get the better of grace; it being an inexcusable weakness, as he
observed, to be in any degree affected with the suffering of the body,
however great, when afflicted, as they ever are in the Holy Inquisition,
for the good of the soul.And it was, I presume, to make trial of the
effect of that reprimand, that the execution of this cruel order was
committed to me.As I could by no possible means decline it, I summoned
all my resolution, after passing an hour by myself, I may say in the
agonies of death, and set out a little after two in the morning for my
unhappy friend's house, attended by a notary of the Inquisition, and six
armed Sbirri.We arrived at the house by different ways and knocking
at the door, a maid-servant looked out of the window, and asked who
knocked."The Holy Inquisition," was the answer, and at the same time
she was ordered to awake nobody, but to come down directly and open the
door, on pain of excommunication.At these words, the servant hastened
down, half naked as she was, and having with much ado, in her great
fright, opened the door, she conducted us as she was ordered to her
master's chamber.She often looked very earnestly at me, as she knew me,
and showed a great desire to speak with me; but of her I durst take no
kind of notice.I entered the bed-chamber with the notary, followed by
the Sbirri, when the lady awakening at the noise, and seeing the bed
surrounded by armed men, screamed out aloud and continued screaming as
out of her senses, till one of the Sbirri, provoked at the noise gave
her a blow on the forehead that made the blood flow, and she swooned
away.I rebuked the fellow severely, and ordered him to be whipped as
soon as I returned to the Inquisition.In the mean time, the husband awakening, and seeing me with my
attendants, cried out, in the utmost surprise, "MR.He said no
more, nor could I for some time utter a single word; and it was with
much ado that, in the end I so far mastered my grief as to be able
to let my unfortunate friend know that he was a prisoner of the Holy
Inquisition."Alas I what have I
done?He said many affecting things;
but as I knew it was not in my power to befriend him, I had not the
courage to look him in the face, but turning my back to him, withdrew,
while he dressed, to a corner of the room, to give vent to my grief.The
notary stood by, quite unaffected.Indeed, to be void of all humanity,
to be able to behold one's fellow-creatures groaning under the most
exquisite torments cruelty can invent, without being in the least
affected with their sufferings, is one of the chief qualifications of
an inquisitor, and what all who belong to the Inquisition must strive to
attain to.It often happens, at that infernal tribunal, that while the
unhappy, and probably innocent, person is crying out in their presence
on the rack, and begging by all that is sacred for one moment's relief,
in a manner one would think no human heart could withstand, it often
happens, I say, that the inquisitor and the rest of his infamous crew,
quite unaffected with his complaints, and deaf to his groans, to his
tears and entreaties, are entertaining one another with the news of the
town; nay, sometimes they even insult, with unheard of barbarity, the
unhappy wretches in the height of their torment.He was no sooner dressed than I
ordered the Bargello, or head of the Sbirri, to tie his hands with
a cord behind his back, as is practised on such occasions without
distinction of persons; no more regard being paid to men of the first
rank, when charged with heresy, than to the meanest offender.Heresy
dissolves all friendship; so that I durst no longer look upon the man
with whom I had lived in the greatest friendship and intimacy as my
friend, or show him, on that account, the least regard or indulgence.As we left the chamber, the countess, who had been conveyed out of the
room, met us, and screaming out in the most pitiful manner upon seeing
her husband with his hands tied behind his back like a thief or robber,
flew to embrace him, and hanging on his neck, begged, with a flood of
tears, we would be so merciful as to put an end to her life, that she
might have the satisfaction--the only satisfaction she wished for in
this world, of dying in the bosom of the man from whom she had vowed
never to part.The count, overwhelmed with grief, did not utter a single
word.I could not find it in my heart, nor was I in a condition to
interpose; and indeed a scene of greater distress was never beheld by
human eyes.However, I gave a signal to the notary to part them, which
he did accordingly, quite unconcerned; but the countess fell into a
swoon, and the count was meantime carried down stairs, and out of the
house, amid the loud lamentations and sighs of his servants, on all
sides, for he was a man remarkable for the sweetness of his temper, and
his kindness to all around him.Being arrived at the Inquisition, I consigned my prisoner into the
hands of a gaoler, a lay brother of St.Dominic, who shut him up in the
dungeon above-mentioned, and delivered the key to me.I lay that night
at the palace of the Inquisition, where every counsellor has a room, and
returned next morning the key to the inquisitor, telling him that his
order had been punctually complied with.The inquisitor had been already
informed of my conduct by the notary, and therefore, upon my delivering
the key to him, he said, "You have acted like one who is at least
desirous to overcome, with the assistance of grace, the inclinations of
nature;" that is, like one who is desirous, by the assistance of grace,
to metamorphose himself from a human creature into a brute or a devil.In the Inquisition, every prisoner is kept the first week of his
imprisonment in a dark narrow dungeon, so low that he cannot stand
upright in it, without seeing anybody but the gaoler, who brings him,
EVERY OTHER DAY, his portion of bread and water, the only food allowed
him.This is done, they say, to tame him, and render him, thus weakened,
more sensible of the torture, and less able to endure it.At the end of
the week, he is brought in the night before the board to be examined;
and on that occasion my poor friend appeared so altered, in a week's
time, that, had it not been for his dress, I should not have known him.And indeed no wonder; a change of condition so sudden and unexpected;
the unworthy and barbarous treatment he had already met with; the
apprehension of what he might and probably should suffer; and perhaps,
more than anything else, the distressed and forlorn condition of his
once happy wife, whom he tenderly loved, whose company he had enjoyed
only six months, could be attended with no other effect.Being asked, according to custom, whether he had any enemies, and
desired to name them, he answered, that he bore enmity to no man, and he
hoped no man bore enmity to him.For, as in the Inquisition the person
accused is not told of the charge brought against him, nor of the person
by whom it is brought, the inquisitor asks him if he has any enemies,
and desires him to name them.If he names the informer, all further
proceedings are stopped until the informer is examined anew; and if the
information is found to proceed from ill-will and no collateral proof
can be produced, the prisoner is discharged.Of this piece of justice
they frequently boast, at the same time that they admit, both as
informers and witnesses, persons of the most infamous characters,
and such as are excluded by all other courts.In the next place, the
prisoner is ordered to swear that he will declare the truth, and conceal
nothing from the holy tribunal, concerning himself or others, that he
knows and the holy tribunal desires to know.He is then interrogated for
what crime he has been apprehended and imprisoned by the Holy Court of
the Inquisition, of all courts the most equitable, the most cautious,
the most merciful.To that interrogatory the count answered, with a
faint and trembling voice, that he was not conscious to himself of any
crime, cognizable by the Holy Court, nor indeed by any other; that he
believed and ever had believed whatever holy mother church believed or
required him to believe.He had, it seems quite forgotten what he
had unthinkingly said at the sight of the two friars.The inquisitor,
therefore, finding that he did not remember or would not own his crime,
after many deceitful interrogatories, and promises which he never
intended to fulfil, ordered him back to his dungeon, and allowing him
another week, as is customary in such cases, to recollect himself, told
him that if he could not in that time prevail upon himself to declare
the truth, agreeably to his oath, means would be found of forcing it
from him; and he must expect no mercy.At the end of the week he was brought again before the infernal
tribunal; and being asked the same questions, returned the same answers,
adding, that if he had done or said anything amiss, unwittingly or
ignorantly, he was ready to own it, provided the least hint of it were
given him by any there present, which he entreated them most earnestly
to do.He often looked at me, and seemed to expect--which gave me such
concern as no words can express--that I should say something in his
favor.But I was not allowed to speak on this occasion, nor were any of
the counsellors; and had I been allowed to speak, I durst not have said
anything in his favor; the advocate appointed by the Inquisition, and
commonly styled, "The Devil's Advocate," being the only person that
is suffered to speak for the prisoner.The advocate belongs to the
Inquisition, receives a salary from the Inquisition, and is bound by an
oath to abandon the defence of the prisoner, if he undertakes it, or not
to undertake it, if he finds it cannot be defended agreeably to the laws
of the Holy Inquisition; go that the whole is mere sham and imposition.I have heard this advocate, on other occasions, allege something in
favor of the person accused; but on this occasion he declared that he
had nothing to offer in defence of the criminal.In the Inquisition, the person accused is always supposed guilty, unless
he has named the accuser among his enemies.And he is put to the torture
if he does not plead guilty, and own the crime that is laid to his
charge, without being so much as told what it is; whereas, in all other
courts, where tortures are used, the charge is declared to the party
accused before he is tortured; nor are they ever inflicted without
a credible evidence of his guilt.But in the Inquisition, a man is
frequently tortured upon the deposition of a person whose evidence would
be admitted in no other court, and in all cases without hearing the
charge.As my unfortunate friend continued to maintain his innocence,
not recollecting what he had said, he was, agreeably to the laws of
the Inquisition, put to the torture.He had scarcely borne it twenty
minutes, crying out the whole time, "Jesus Maria!"when his voice failed
him at once, and he fainted away.He was then supported, as he hung
by his arms, by two of the Sbirri, whose province it is to manage the
torture, till he returned to himself.He still continued to declare that
he could not recollect his having said or done anything contrary to the
Catholic faith, and earnestly begged they would let him know with what
he was charged, being ready to own it if it was true.The Inquisitor was then so gracious as to put him in mind of what he had
said on seeing the two Capuchins.The reason why they so long conceal
from the party accused the crime he is charged with, is, that if he
should be conscious to himself of his having ever said or done anything
contrary to the faith, which he is not charged with, he may discover
that too, imagining it to be the very crime he is accused of.After a
short pause, the poor gentleman owned that he had said something to that
purpose; but, as he had said it with no evil intention, he had never
more thought of it, from that time to the present.He added, but with a
voice so faint, as scarce could be heard, that for his rashness he was
willing to undergo what punishment soever the holy tribunal should,
think fit to impose on him; and he again fainted away.Being eased for
a while of his torment, and returned to himself, he was interrogated by
the promoter fiscal (whose business it is to accuse and to prosecute, as
neither the informer nor the witnesses, are ever to appear,) concerning
his intention.For in the Inquisition, it is not enough for the party
accused to confess the fact, he must declare whether his intention was
heretical or not; and many, to redeem themselves from the torments
they, can no longer endure, own their intention was heretical, though
it really was not.My poor friend often told us, he was ready to say
whatever he pleased, but as he never directly acknowledged his intention
to have been heretical, as is required by the rules of the court, he
was kept on the torture still, quite overcome with the violence of the
anguish, he was ready to expire.Being taken down, he was carried quite
senseless, back to his dungeon, and there, on the third day, death put
an end to his sufferings.The Inquisitor wrote a note to his widow, to
desire her to pray for the soul of her late husband, and warn her not
to complain of the holy Inquisition, as capable of any injustice or
cruelty.The estate was confiscated to the Inquisition, and a small
jointure allowed out of it to the widow.As they had only been
married six months, and some part of the fortune was not yet paid, the
inquisitor sent an order to the Constantini family, at Ferno, to pay the
holy office, and without delay, what they owed to the late Count Della
Torre.The effects of heretics are all ipso facto confiscated to the
Inquisition from the very day, not of their conviction, but of their
crime, so that all donations made after that time are void; and whatever
they may have given, is claimed by the Inquisition, into whatsoever
hands it may have passed; even the fortunes they have given to their
daughters in marriage, have been declared to belong to, and are claimed
by the Inquisition; nor can it be doubted, that the desire of those
confiscations is one great cause of the injustice and cruelty of that
court.The death of the unhappy Count Della Torre was soon publicly known; but
no man cared to speak of it, not even his nearest relations, nor so much
as to mention his name, lest anything should inadvertently escape them
that might be construed into a disapprobation of the proceedings of the
most holy tribunal; so great is the awe all men live in of that jealous
and merciless court.The deep impression that the death of my unhappy friend, the barbarous
and inhuman treatment he had met with, and the part I had been obliged
to act in so affecting a tragedy, made on my mind, got at once the
better of my fears, so that, forgetting in a manner the dangers I had
till then so much apprehended, I resolved, without further delay to put
in execution the design I had formed, of quitting the Inquisition, and
bidding forever adieu to Italy.To execute that design with some safety,
I proposed to beg leave to visit the Virgin of Loretto, but thirteen
miles distant, and to pass a week there; but in the mean time, to make
the best of my way out of the reach of the Inquisition.Having, therefore, after many conflicts with myself, asked leave to
visit the neighboring sanctuary, and obtained it, I set out on horseback
the very next morning, leaving, as I proposed to keep the horse, his
full value with the owner.I took the road to Loretto, but turned out
of it a short distance from Recanati, after a most violent struggle with
myself, the attempt appearing to me at that juncture, quite desperate
and impracticable; and the dreadful doom reserved for me should I
miscarry, presented itself to my mind in the strongest light.But the
reflection that I had it in my power to avoid being taken alive, and
a persuasion that a man in my situation might lawfully avoid it, when
every other means failed him, at the expense of his life, revived my
staggered resolution; and all my fears ceasing at once, I steered my
course, leaving Loretto behind me, to Rocca Contrada, to Fossonbrone, to
Calvi in the dukedom of Urbino, and from thence through the Romagna into
Bolognese, keeping the by-roads, and at a good distance from the cities
through which the high road passed.Thus I advanced very slowly, travelling in very bad roads, and often in
places where there was no road at all, to avoid, not only the cities,
and towns, but also the villages.In the mean time I seldom had any
other support but some coarse provisions, and a very small quantity
even, of them, that the poor shepherds, the countrymen or wood cleavers
I met in those unfrequented by-places, could spare me.My horse fared
not much better than myself; but, in choosing my sleeping-place I
consulted his convenience as much as my own, passing the night where I
found most shelter for myself, and most grass for him.In Italy there
are very few solitary farm-houses or cottages, the country people all
living together in villages; and I thought it far safer to lie where I
could be in any way sheltered, than to venture into any of them.Thus I
spent seventeen days before I got out of the ecclesiastical state; and
I very narrowly escaped being taken or murdered, on the very borders of
that state; it happened thus.I had passed two whole days without any kind of subsistence whatever,
meeting with no one in the by-roads that could supply me with any, and
fearing to come near any house, as I was not far from the borders of the
dominions of the Pope.I thought I should be able to hold out till I
got into the Modanese, where I believed I should be in less danger than
while I remained in the papal dominions.But finding myself, about noon
of the third day, extremely weak and ready to faint away, I came into
the high road that leads from Bologna to Florence, a few miles distant
from the former city, and alighted at a post house, that stood quite
by itself.Having asked the woman of the house whether she had any
victuals, and being told that she had, I went to open the door of the
only room in the house, (that being a place where gentlemen only stop
to change horses,) and saw to my great surprise, a placard pasted on it,
with a minute description of my whole person, sad a promise of a reward
of 900 crowns (about 200 pounds English money) for delivering me up
alive to the Inquisition, being a fugitive from that holy tribunal,
and of 600 crowns for my head.By the same placard, all persons were
forbidden, on pain of the greater excommunication, to receive or
harbor, entertain, conceal, or screen me, or to be in any way aiding, or
assisting me to make my escape.This greatly alarmed me, as the reader
may well imagine; but I was still more frightened, when entering the
room, I saw two fellows drinking there, who, fixing their eyes on me as
soon as I went in, continued looking at me very steadfastly.I strove,
by wiping my face and blowing my nose, and by looking out of the window,
to prevent their having a full view of my features.But, one of
them saying, "The gentleman seems afraid to be seen," I put up my
handkerchief, and turning to the fellow, said boldly, "What do you mean
you rascal?Look at me; am I afraid to be seen?"He said nothing, but
looking again steadfastly at me, and nodding his head, went out, and
his companion immediately followed him.I watched them, and seeing them,
with two or three more, in close conference, and no doubt consulting
whether they should apprehend me or not, I walked that moment into
the stable, mounted my horse unobserved by them, and while they were
deliberating in an orchard behind the house, rode off at full speed, and
in a few hours got into the Modanese, where I refreshed both with food
and rest, as I was there in no immediate danger, my horse and myself.I
was indeed surprised to find that those fellows did not pursue me, nor
can I in any other way account for it, but by supposing, what is not
improbable, that, as they were strangers as well as myself, and had all
the appearance of banditti or ruffians flying out of the dominions of
the Pope, the woman of the house did not care to trust them with her
horses.From the Modanese I continued my journey, more leisurely through
the Parmesan, the Milanese, and part of the Venetian territory, to
Chiavenna, subject to the Grisons, who abhor the very name of the
Inquisition, and are ever ready to receive and protect all who, flying
from it, take refuge, as many Italians do, in their dominions.Still
I carefully concealed who I was, and whence I came, for, though no
Inquisition prevails among the Swiss, yet the Pope's nuncio who resides
at Lucerne, (a popish canton through which I was to pass,) might have
persuaded the magistrate to stop me as an apostate and deserter from the
order.Having rested a few days at Chiavenna, I resumed my journey quite
refreshed, continuing it through the country of the Grisons, and the two
small cantons of Ury and Underwald, to the canton of Lucerne.There
I missed my way, as I was quite unacquainted with the country, and
discovering a city at a distance, was advancing to it, but slowly, as I
knew not where I was, when a countryman whom I met, informed me that the
city before me was Lucerne.Upon that intelligence, I turned out of the
road as soon as the countryman was out of sight, and that night I
passed with a good natured shepherd in his cottage, who supplied me with
sheep's milk, and my horse with plenty of grass.I set out early next
morning, making my way westward, as I knew that Berne lay west of
Lucerne.But, after a few miles, the country proved very mountainous,
and having travelled the whole day over mountains I was overtaken among
them by night.As I was looking out for a place where I might shelter
myself during the night, against the snow and rain, (for it both snowed
and rained,) I perceived a light at a distance, and making towards it,
I got into a kind of foot-path, but so narrow and rugged that I was
obliged to lead my horse, and feel my way with one foot, (having no
light to direct me,) before I durst move the other.Thus, with much
difficulty I reached the place where the light was, a poor little
cottage, and knocking at the door, was asked by a man within who I was,
and what I wanted?I answered that I was a stranger and had lost my way.exclaimed the man, "There is no way here to lose."I
then asked him what canton I was in?and upon his answering that I was
in the canton of Berne, I cried out transported with joy, "I thank God
that I am."The good man answered, "And so do I."I then told him who I
was, and that I was going to Berne but had quite lost myself by keeping
out of all the high roads, to avoid falling into the hands of those
who sought my destruction.He thereupon opened the door, received and
entertained me with all the hospitality his poverty would admit of;
regaled me with sour crout and some new laid eggs, the only provision
he had, and clean straw with a kind of rug for a bed, he having no other
for himself and wife.The good woman expressed as much good nature as
her husband, and said many kind things in the Swiss language, which
her husband interpreted to me in the Italian; for that language he well
understood, having learned it in his youth, while servant in a public
home on the borders of Italy, where both languages are spoken.I never
passed a more comfortable night; and no sooner did I begin to stir in
the morning, than the good man and his wife both came to know how
I rested; and, wishing they had been able to accommodate me better,
obliged me to breakfast on two eggs, which providence, they said, had
sent them for that purpose.I took leave of the wife, who seemed most
sincerely to wish me a good journey.As for the husband, he would by all
means attend me to the high road leading to Berne; which road he said
was but two miles distant from that place.But he insisted on my first
going back with him, to see the way I had come the night before; the
only way, he said, I could have possibly come from the neighboring
canton of Lucerne.I saw it, and shuddered at the danger I had escaped;
for I found I had walked and led my horse a good way along a very narrow
path on the brink of a very dangerous precipice.The man made so
many pertinent and pious remarks on the occasion, as both charmed and
surprised me.I no less admired his disinterestedness than his piety;
for, upon our parting, after he had attended me till I was out of all
danger of losing my way, I could by no means prevail upon him to accept
of any reward for his trouble.He had the satisfaction, he said, of
having relieved me in the greatest distress, which was in itself a
sufficient reward, and he wished for no other.Having at length got safe into French Flanders, I there repaired to the
college of the Scotch Jesuits at Douay, and discovering myself to the
rector, I acquainted him with the cause of my sudden departure from
Italy, and begged him to give notice of my arrival, as well as the
motives of my flight to Michael Angelo Tambuvini, general of the order,
and my very particular friend.The rector wrote as I desired him, to the general, and he, taking no
notice of my flight, in his answer, (for he could not disapprove, and
did not think it safe to approve of it,) ordered me to continue where I
was till further notice.I arrived at Douay early in May, and continued
there till the beginning of July, when the rector received a second
letter from the general, acquainting him that he had been commanded by
the congregation of the Inquisition, to order me, wherever I was, back
into Italy; to promise me, in their name, full pardon and forgiveness if
I obeyed, but if I did not obey, to treat me as an apostate.He added,
that the same order had been transmitted, soon after my flight, to
the nuncios at the different Roman Catholic courts; and he, therefore,
advised me to consult my own safety without further delay.Upon the receipt of the general's kind letter, the rector was of opinion
that I should repair by all means, and without loss of time, to England,
not only as the safest asylum I could fly to, in my present situation,
but as a place where I should soon recover my native language, and be
usefully employed, either there or in Scotland.The place being thus
agreed on, and it being at the same time settled between the rector and
me, that I should set out the very next morning, I solemnly promised, at
his request and desire, to take no kind of notice, after my arrival
in England, of his having been in any way privy to my flight, or the
general's letter to him.This promise I have faithfully and honorably
observed; and should have thought myself guilty of the blackest
ingratitude if I had not observed it, being sensible that, had it been
known at Rome, that, either the rector or general had been accessary to
my flight, THE INQUISITION WOULD HAVE RESENTED IT SEVERELY IN BOTH.For
although a Jesuit in France, in Flanders, or in Germany, is out of the
reach of the Inquisition, the general is not; and the high tribunal not
only have it in their power to punish the general himself, who resides
constantly at Rome, but may oblige him to inflict what punishment they
please on any of the order obnoxious to them.The rector went that very night out of town, and in his absence, but not
without his privity, I took one of the horses of the college, early
next morning, as if I were going for a change of air, being somewhat
indisposed, to pass a few days at Lisle; but steering a different
course, I reached Aire that night and Calais the next day.I was there
in no danger of being stopped and seized at the prosecution of the
Inquisition, a tribunal no less abhorred in France than in England.But being informed that the nuncios at the different courts had been
ordered, soon after my flight, to cause me to be apprehended in Roman
Catholic countries through which I must pass, as an apostate and
deserter from the order, I was under no small apprehension of being
discovered and apprehended as such even at Calais.No sooner, therefore,
did I alight at the Inn, than I went down to the quay, and there as I
was very little acquainted with the sea, and thought the passage much
shorter than it is, I endeavored to engage some fishermen to carry me
that very night, in one of their small vessels, over to England.This
alarmed the guards of the harbor, and I should have been certainly
apprehended as a person guilty, or suspected of some great crime,
fleeing from justice, had not Lord Baltimore, whom I had the good luck
to meet in the Inn, informed me of my danger, and pitying my condition,
attended me that moment, with all his company, to the port, and conveyed
me immediately on board his yacht.There I lay that night, leaving every
thing I had but the clothes on my back, in the Inn; and the next day his
Lordship set me ashore at Dover, from whence I came in the common stage
to London.In the year 1706, the Inquisition at Arragon was broken up by the French
troops, under the command of the Duke of Orleans.The Holy Inquisitors
were driven from their beautiful house, and in answer to their indignant
remonstrance were told that the king wanted the house to quarter his
troops in, and they were therefore compelled to leave it immediately.The doors of the prisons were then thrown open, and among the four
hundred prisoners who were set at liberty were sixty young women, very
beautiful in person, and clad in the richest attire.Anthony Gavin, formerly one of the Roman Catholic priests of Saragossa,
Spain, relates (in a book published by him after his conversion) that
when travelling in France he met one of those women in the inn at
Rotchfort; the son of the inn-keeper, formerly an officer in the French
army, having married her for her great beauty and superior intelligence.In accordance with his request, she freely related to him the incidents
of her prison life, from which we take the following extract:

"Early the next morning, Mary got up, and told me that nobody was up
yet in the house; and that she would show me the DRY PAN and the GRADUAL
FIRE, on condition that I should keep it a secret for her sake as well
as my own.This I promised, and she took me along with her, and showed
me a dark room with a thick iron door, and within it an oven and a large
brass pan upon it, with a cover of the same and a lock to it.The oven
was burning at the time, and I asked Mary for what purpose the pan was
there.Without giving me any answer, she took me by the hand and led
me to a large room, where she showed me a thick wheel, covered on both
sides with thick boards, and opening a little window in the center of
it, desired me to look with a candle on the inside of it, and I saw all
the circumference of the wheel set with SHARP RAZORS.After that she
showed me a PIT FULL OF SERPENTS AND TOADS.Then she said to me, 'Now,
my good mistress, I'll tell you the use of these things.The dry pan and
gradual fire are for those who oppose the holy father's will, and for
heretics.They are put naked and alive into the pan, and the cover of it
being locked up, the executioner begins to put in the oven a small fire,
and by degrees he augmenteth it, till the body is burned to ashes.The
second is designed for those who speak against the Pope and the holy
fathers.They are put within the wheel, and the door being locked, the
executioner turns the wheel till the person is dead.The third is for
those who contemn the images, and refuse to give the due respect and
veneration to ecclesiastical persons; for they are thrown alive into the
pit, and there they become the food of serpents and toads.'Then Mary
said to me that another day she would show me the torments for public
sinners and transgressors of the commandments of holy mother church;
but I, in deep amazement, desired her to show me no more places; for the
very thought of those three which I had seen, was enough to terrify me
to the heart.So we went to my room, and she charged me again to be very
obedient to all commands, for if I was not, I was sure to undergo the
torment of the dry pan."Llorente, the Spanish historian and secretary-general of the
Inquisition, relates the following incident: "A physician, Juan de
Salas, was accused of having used a profane expression, twelve months
before, in the heat of debate.He denied the accusation, and produced
several witnesses to prove his innocence.But Moriz, the inquisitor at
Valladolid, where the charge was laid, caused de Salas to be brought
into his presence in the torture-chamber, stripped to his shirt, and
laid on a LADDER or DONKEY, an instrument resembling a wooden trough,
just large enough to receive the body, with no bottom, but having a
bar or bars to placed that the body bent, by its own weight, into an
exquisitely painful position.His head was lower than his heels, and the
breathing, in consequence, became exceedingly difficult.The poor man,
so laid, was bound around the arms and legs with hempen cords, each of
them encircling the limb eleven times."During this part of the operation they admonished him to confess the
blasphemy; but he only answered that he had never spoken a sentence
of such a kind, and then, resigning himself to suffer, repeated the
Athanasian creed, and prayed to God and our Lady many times.Being
still bound, they raised his head, covered his face with a piece of fine
linen, and, forcing open the mouth, caused water to drip into it from an
earthen jar, slightly perforated at the bottom, producing in addition
to his sufferings from distension, a horrid sensation of choking.But
again, when they removed the jar for a moment, he declared that he had
never uttered such a sentence; and this he often repeated.They then
pulled the cords on his right leg, cutting into the flesh, replaced the
linen on his face, dropped the water as before, and tightened the cords
on his right leg the second time; but still he maintained that he
had never spoken such a thing; and in answer to the questions of his
tormentors, constantly reiterated that he HAD NEVER SPOKEN THOSE WORDS.Moriz then pronounced that the said torture should be regarded as
begun, but not finished; and De Salas was released, to live, if he could
survive, in the incessant apprehension that if he gave the slightest
umbrage to a familiar, he would be carried again into the same chamber,
and be RACKED IN EVERY LIMB."Llorente also relates, from the original records, another case quite as
cruel and unjust as the above."On the 8th day of December, 1528, one
Catalina, a woman of BAD CHARACTER, informed the inquisitors that,
EIGHTEEN YEARS BEFORE she had lived in the house with a Morisco named
Juan, by trade a coppersmith, and a native of Segovia; that she had
observed that neither he nor his children ate pork or drank wine, and
that, on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings they used to wash their
feet, which custom, as well as abstinence from pork and wine, was
peculiar to the Moors.The old man was at that time an inhabitant of
Benevente, and seventy-one years of age.But the inquisitors at once
summoned him into their presence, and questioned him at three several
interviews.All that he could tell was, that he received baptism when he
was forty-five years of age; that having never eaten pork or drunk wine,
he had no taste for them; and that, being coppersmiths, they found it
necessary to wash themselves thoroughly once a week.After some other
examinations, they sent him back to Benevente, with prohibition to go
beyond three leagues' distance from the town.Two years afterwards the
inquisitor determined that he should be threatened with torture, IN
ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP THEM TO CRIMINATE OTHERS.He was accordingly taken to Valladolid, and in a subterranean chamber,
called the 'chamber, or dungeon, of torment,' stripped naked, and bound
to the 'ladder.'This might well have extorted something like confession
from an old man of seventy-one; but he told them that whatever he might
say when under torture would be merely extorted by the extreme anguish,
and therefore unworthy of belief; that he would not, through fear of
pain, confess what had never taken place.They kept him in close prison
until the next Auto de Fe, when he walked among the penitents, with a
lighted candle in his hand, and, after seeing others burnt to death,
paid the holy office a fee of four ducats, and went home, not acquitted,
but released.He was not summoned again, as he died soon afterwards."It sometimes happened that an individual was arrested by mistake, and
a person who was entirely innocent was tortured instead of the real or
supposed criminal.Bower found related at length
in the "Annals of the Inquisition at Macerata.""An order was sent from the high tribunal at Rome to all the inquisitors
throughout Italy, enjoining them to apprehend a clergyman minutely
described in that order.One Answering the description in many
particulars being discovered in the diocese of Osimo, at a small
distance from Macerata, and subject to that Inquisition, he was there
decoyed into the holy office, and by an order from Rome SO RACKED AS TO
LOSE HIS SENSES.In the mean time, the true person being apprehended,
the unhappy wretch was dismissed, by a second order from Rome, but he
never recovered the use of his senses, NOR WAS ANY CARE TAKEN OF HIM BY
THE INQUISITION."It would be easy to fill a volume with such narratives as the above, but
we forbear.We are not writing a history of the Inquisition.We simply
wish to exhibit the true spirit by which the Romanists are actuated in
their dealings with those over whom they have power.We therefore, in
closing this chapter of horrors, beg leave to place before our readers
one of the FATHERLY BENEDICTIONS with which, His Holiness, the Pope,
dismisses his refractory subjects.Does it not show most convincingly
what he would do here in America, if he had, among us, the power he
formerly possessed in the old world, when the least inadvertent word
might perchance seal the doom of the culprit?A POPISH BULL OK CURSE."Pronounced on all who leave the Church of Rome.By the authority of God
Almighty, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and the undefiled Virgin
Mary, mother and patroness of our Saviour, and of all celestial virtues,
Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Powers, Cherubim and Seraphim,
and of all the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, and of all the Apostles and
Evangelists, of the holy innocents, who in the sight of the holy Lamb
are found worthy to sing the new song of the Holy Martyrs and Holy
Confessors, and of all the Holy Virgins, and of all the Saints, together
with the Holy Elect of God,--MAY HE BE DAMNED.We excommunicate and
anathematize him, from the threshold of the holy church of God Almighty.We sequester him, that he may be tormented, disposed, and be delivered
over with Datham and Abiram, and with those who say unto the Lord,
'Depart from us, we desire none of thy ways;' as a fire is quenched with
water, so let the light of him be put out forevermore, unless it shall
repent him, and make satisfaction."May the Father who creates man, curse him.May the Son, who suffered
for us, curse him!May the Holy Ghost who is poured out in baptism,
curse him!May the Holy Cross, which Christ for our salvation,
triumphing over his enemies, ascended, curse him!"May the Holy Mary, ever Virgin and Mother of God, curse him!May all
the Angels, Principalities, and Powers, and all heavenly Armies curse
him!May the glorious band of the Patriarchs and Prophets curse him!John the Precursor, and St John the Baptist, and St.Andrew and all other of Christ's Apostles together
curse him and may the rest of the Disciples and Evangelists who by their
preaching converted the universe, and the Holy and wonderful company
of Martyrs and Confessors, who by their works are found pleasing to God
Almighty; may the holy choir of the Holy Virgins, who for the honor of
God have despised the things of the world, damn him.May all the Saints
from the beginning of the world to everlasting ages, who are found to be
beloved of God, damn him!"May he be damned wherever he be, whether in the house or in the alley,
in the woods or in the water, or in the church!May he be cursed in
living or dying!"May he be cursed in eating and drinking, in being hungry, in being
thirsty, in fasting and sleeping, in slumbering, and in sitting, in
living, in working, in resting, and in blood letting!May he be cursed
in all the faculties of his body!"May he be cursed inwardly and outwardly.May he be cursed in his hair;
cursed be he in his brains, and his vertex, in his temples, in his
eyebrows, in his cheeks, in his jaw-bones, in his nostrils, in his
teeth, and grinders, in his lips, in his shoulders, in his arms, and in
his fingers."May he be damned in his mouth, in his breast, in his heart, and
purtenances, down to the very stomach!"May he be cursed in his reins and groins, in his thighs and his hips,
and in his knees, his legs and his feet, and his toe-nails!"May he be cursed in all his joints, and articulation of the members;
from the crown of the head to the soles of his feet, may there be no
soundness!"May the Son of the living God, with all the glory of his majesty, CURSE
HIM!And may Heaven, with all the powers that move therein, rise
up against him, and curse and damn him; unless he repent and make
satisfaction!Such was the CURSE pronounced on the Rev.Hogan, (a converted Roman
Catholic priest) a few years since, in Philadelphia.As a further proof of the cruel, persecuting spirit of Catholicism, let
us glance at a few extracts from their own publications."Children," they say, "are obliged to denounce their parents or
relations who are guilty of heresy; ALTHOUGH THEY KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE
BURNT.They may refuse them all nourishment, and permit them to die
with hunger; or they may KILL THEM as enemies, who violate the rights of
humanity.--Escobar, Theolg."A man condemned by the Pope, may be killed wherever he is found.""Children may kill their parents, if they would turn their children
from the Popish faith.""If a judge decide contrary to law, the injured
person may defend himself by killing the judge."--Fangundez Precept
Decal, vol."To secretly kill your calumniator, to avoid scandal, is
justifiable.""You may kill before hand, any person who may put you to death,
not EXCEPTING THE JUDGE, AND WITNESSES, because it is
self-defence.""A priest may kill those who hinder him from taking possession of any
Ecclesiastical office.""You may charge your opponent with false crime to take away his credit,
as well as kill him."--Guimenius, prop, 8, p."Priests may kill the laity to preserve their goods.""You may kill any man to save a crown.""BY THE COMMAND OF GOD IT IS LAWFUL TO MURDER THE INNOCENT, TO ROB, AND
TO COMMIT ALL KIND OF WICKEDNESS, BECAUSE HE IS THE LORD OF LIFE
AND DEATH, AND ALL THINGS; AND THUS TO FULFILL HIS MANDATE IS OUR
DUTY."Again, in the Romish Creed found in the pocket of Priest Murphy, who was
killed in the battle of Arklow, 1798, we find the following articles."We acknowledge that the priests can make vice virtue, and virtue vice,
according to their pleasure."We are bound to believe that the holy massacre was lawful, and lawfully
put into execution, against Protestants, and likewise WE ARE TO CONTINUE
THE SAME, PROVIDED WITH SAFETY TO OUR LIVES!"We are bound not to keep our oaths with heretics, though bound by the
most sacred ties.We are bound not to believe their oaths; for their
principles are damnation.We are bound to drive heretics with fire,
sword, <DW19>, and confusion, out of the land; as our holy fathers say,
if their heresies prevail we will become their slaves.We are bound
to absolve without money or price, those who imbrue their hands in
the blood of a heretic!"Do not these extracts show very clearly that
Romanism can do things as bad as anything in the foregoing narrative?Whenever we refer to the relentless cruelties of the Romanists, we are
told, and that, too, by the influential, the intelligent, those who are
well-informed on other subjects, that "these horrid scenes transpired
only in the 'dark ages;'" that "the civilization and refinement of the
present age has so modified human society, so increased the milk of
human kindness, that even Rome would not dare, if indeed she had the
heart, to repeat the cruelties of by-gone days."For the honor of humanity we could hope that this opinion was correct;
but facts of recent date compel us to believe that it is as false as it
is ruinous to the best interests of our country and the souls of men.A few of these facts, gathered from unquestionable sources, and some of
them related by the actors and sufferers themselves, we place before the
reader.In November, 1854, Ubaldus Borzinski, a monk of the Brothers of Mercy,
addressed an earnest petition to the Pope, setting forth the shocking
immoralities practised in the convents of his order in Bohemia.He specifies nearly forty crimes, mostly perpetrated by priors and
subpriors, giving time, place, and other particulars, entreating the
Pope to interpose his power, and correct those horrible abuses.For sending this petition, he was thrown into a madhouse of the Brothers
of Mercy, at Prague, where he still languishes in dreary confinement,
though the only mark of insanity he ever showed was in imagining that
the Pope would interfere with the pleasures of the monks.This Ubaldus has a brother, like minded with himself, also a member of
the same misnamed order of monks, who has recently effected his escape
from durance vile.John Evangelist Borzinski was a physician in the convent of the Brothers
of Mercy at Prague.By the
study of the Psalms and Lessons from the New Testament, which make up
a considerable part of the Breviary used in cloisters, he was first
led into Protestant views.He had been for seventeen years resident in
different cloisters of his order, as sick-nurse, alms gatherer,
student, and physician, and knew the conventual life out and out.As he
testifies: "There was little of the fear of God, so far as I could
see, little of true piety; but abundance of hypocrisy, eye-service,
deception, abuse of the poor sick people in the hospitals, such love
and hatred as are common among the children of this world, and the most
shocking vices of every kind."He now felt disgust for the cloister life, and for the Romish religion,
and he sought, by the aid of divine grace, to attain to the new birth
through the Word of God.Speaking of his change of views to a Prussian
clergyman, he thus describes his conversion: "Look you, it was thus I
became a Protestant.I found a treasure in that dustheap, and went away
with it."He then thought
within himself, if these detached passages can give such light, what an
illumination he must receive if he could read and understand the whole
Bible.He did not, however, betray his dissatisfaction, but devoted himself
to his professional duties with greater diligence.He might still have
remained in the Order, his life hid with Christ in God, had not the
hierarchy, under pretence of making reforms and restoring the neglected
statutes of the Order, brought in such changes for the worse as led him
to resolve to leave the order, and the Romish church as well.Following
his convictions, and the advice of a faithful but very cautious
clergyman, he betook himself to the territories of Prussia, where, on
the 17th of January, 1855, he was received into the national church at
Petershain, by Dr.Nowotny, himself formerly a Bohemian priest.This was
not done till great efforts had been made to induce him to change his
purpose, and also to get his person into the power of his adversaries.As he had now left the church of Rome, become an openly acknowledged
member of another communion, he thought he might venture to return to
his own country.Taking leave of his Prussian friends, to whom he had
greatly endeared himself by his modesty and his lively faith, he went
back to Bohemia, with a heart full of peace and joy.He lived for some time amidst many perplexities, secluded in the house
of his parents at Prosnitz, till betrayed by some who dwelt in the same
habitation.On the 6th of March he was taken out of bed, at eight, by
the police, and conveyed first to the cloister in Prosnitz, where he
suffered much abuse, and from thence to the cloister in Prague.Here the
canon Dittrich, "Apostolical Convisitator of the Order of the Brothers
of Mercy," justified all the inhuman treatment he had suffered, and
threatened him with worse in case he refused to recant and repent.Dittrich not only deprived him of his medical books, but told him that
his going over to Protestantism was a greater crime than if he had
plundered the convent of two thousand florins.He was continually dinned
with the cry, "Retract, retract!"He was not allowed to see his brother,
confined in the same convent, nor other friends, and was so sequestered
in his cell as to make him feel that he was forgotten by all the world.He managed, through some monks who secretly sympathized with him, to get
a letter conveyed occasionally to Dr.These letters were filled
with painful details of the severities practised upon him.In one of
them he says, "My only converse is with God, and the gloomy walls around
me."He was transferred to a cell in the most unwholesome spot, and
infested with noisome smells not to be described.Close by him were
confined some poor maniacs, sunk below the irrational brutes.Under date of April 23d he writes: "Every hour, in this frightful
dungeon seems endless to me.For many weeks have I sat idle in this
durance, with no occupation but prayer and communion with God."His
appeals to civil authority and to the Primate of Hungary procured him no
redress, but only subjected him to additional annoyances and hardships.His aged father, a man of four-score years, wept to see him, though of
sound understanding, locked up among madmen; and when urged to make his
son recant, would have nothing to do with it, and returned the same
day to his sorrowful home.As he had been notified that he was to be
imprisoned for life, he prayed most earnestly to the Father of mercies
for deliverance; and he was heard, for his prayers and endeavors wrought
together.The sinking of his health increased his efforts to escape;
for, though he feared not to die, he could not bear the thought of dying
imprisoned in a mad-house, where he knew that his enemies would take
advantage of his mortal weakness to administer their sacraments to him,
and give out that he had returned to the bosom of the church, or at
least to shave his head, that he might be considered as an insane
person, and his renunciation of Romanism as the effect of derangement
of mind.Several plans of escape were projected, all beset with much
difficulty and danger.The one he decided upon proved to be successful.On Saturday, the 13th of October, at half-past nine in the evening, he
fastened a cord made of strips of linen to the grate of a window, which
grate did not extend to the top.Having climbed over this, he lowered
himself into a small court-yard.He had now left that part of the
establishment reserved for the insane, and was now in the cloistered
part where the brethren dwelt.He saw
at a distance a servant of the insane approaching with a light; and
with aching heart and trembling limbs, by a desperate effort, climbed
up again.He returned to his cell, concealing his cord, and laid himself
down to rest.On the following Monday, he renewed his efforts to escape.He lowered
himself, as before, into the little court-yard; but being weak in health
and much shaken in his nervous system by all he had suffered in body and
mind, he was seized with palpitation of the heart and trembled all over,
so that he could not walk a step.He laid down to rest and recover his
breath.He felt as if he could get no further."But," he says in his
affecting narrative, "My dear Saviour to whom I turned in this time of
need, helped me wonderfully.I felt now, more than ever in my life, His
gracious and comforting presence, and believed, in that dismal moment,
with my whole soul, His holy word;" "My grace is sufficient for thee;
for my strength is made perfect in weakness."Borzinski now arose, pulled off his boots, and though every step was
made with difficulty, he ascended the stairs leading to the first story.He went along the passage way until he came to a door leading into
corridors where the cloister brethren lodged.But the trembling fit came
over him again, with indescribable anguish, as he sought to open the
door with a key with which he had been furnished.He soon rallied again,
and, like a spectre, gliding by the doors of the brethren, who occupied
the second and third corridors, many of whom had lights still burning,
he came with his boots in one hand, and his bundle in the other, to
a fourth passage way, in which was an outside window he was trying to
reach.The cord was soon fastened to the window frame, yet still in
bitter apprehension; for this window was seldom opened, and opened
hard, and with some noise.It was also only two steps distant from the
apartment of the cloister physician, where there was a light, and it was
most likely that, on the first grating of the window, he would rush
out and apprehend the fugitive.However the window was opened without
raising any alarm, and now it was necessary to see that no one was
passing below; for though the spot is not very much frequented, yet
the streets cross there, and people approach it from four different
directions.During these critical moments, one person and another kept
passing, and poor Borzinski tarried shivering in the window for near a
quarter of an hour before he ventured to let himself down.While he
was waiting his opportunity he heard the clock strike the third quarter
after nine and knew that he had but fifteen minutes to reach the house
where he was to conceal himself, which would be closed at ten.When all
was still, he called most fervently on the Saviour, and grasping the
cord, slid down into the street.He could scarce believe his feet were
on the ground.Trembling now with joy and gratitude rather than fear, he
ran bareheaded to his place of refuge, where he received a glad welcome.Having changed his garb, and tarried till three o'clock in the morning,
he took leave of his friends and passing through the gloomy old capital
of Bohemia, he reached the Portzitscher Gate, in order to pass out
as early as possible.Just then a police corporal let in a wagon, and
Borzinski, passed out unchallenged.It is needless to follow him further
in his flight.We have given enough, of his history to prove that
conventual establishments are at this moment what they ever have
been--dangerous alike to liberty and life.AMERICAN AND FOREIGN
CHRISTIAN UNION.In place of labored arguments we give the following history of personal
suffering as strikingly illustrative of the spirit of Romanism at the
present day.APPENDIX VII

NARRATIVE OP SIGNORINA FLORIENCIA D' ROMANI, A NATIVE OF THE CITY OF
NAPLES.I was born in the year 1826, of noble and wealthy parents.Our mansion
contained a small chapel, with many images, sacred paintings, and a
neatly furnished mass altar.As he lived on the rents and income
of his estates, he had little to do, except to amuse himself with his
friends.My mother, who was of as mild and sweet disposition, loved my
father very dearly, but was very unhappy the most of the time because
my father spent so much of his time in drinking with his dissolute
companions, card playing, and in balls, parties, theatres, operas,
billiards, &c. Father did not intend to be unkind to my mother, for he
gave her many servants, and abundance of gold, horses, carriages and
grooms, and said frequently in my hearing, that his wife should be as
happy as a princess.Such was the state of society in Italy that men
thought their wives had no just reason to complain, so long as they were
furnished with plenty of food, raiment and shelter.One of my father's most intimate friends was the very Rev.Father
Salvator, a Priest of the order of St.Francis; he wore the habit of
the order, his head was about half shaved.The sleeves of his habit were
very large at the elbow; in these sleeves he had small pockets, in which
he usually carried his snuff box, handkerchief, and purse of gold.This
priest was merry, full of fun and frolic; he could dance, sing, play
cards, and tell admirably funny stories, such as would make even the
devils laugh in their chains.Such was the influence and power this Franciscan had over my father and
mother, that in our house, his word was law.He was our confessor, knew
the secrets and sins, and all the weak points of every mind in the whole
household.My own dear mother taught me to read before I was seven years
of age.As I was the only child, I was much petted and caressed, indeed,
such was my mother's affection for me that I was seldom a moment out of
her sight.There was a handsome mahogany confessional in our own chapel.When the priest wanted any member of the household to come to him to
confession, he wrote the name on a slate that hung outside the chapel
door, saying that he would hear confessions at such a time to-morrow.Thus, we would always have time for the full examination of our
consciences.Only one at a time was ever admitted into the chapel, for
confessional duty, and the priest always took care to lock the door
inside and place the key in his sleeve pocket.My mother and myself were
obliged to confess once a week; the household servants, generally once a
month.My father only once a year, during Lent, when all the inhabitants
of seven years, and upwards, are obliged to kneel down to the priests,
in the confessional, and receive the wafer God under the severest
penalties.Woe to the individual who resists the ecclesiastical mandate.When I was about fourteen years of age, I was sent to the Ursuline
Convent, to receive my education.My dear mother would have preferred
a governess or a competent teacher to teach me at home but her will was
but a mere straw in the hands of our confessor and priestly tyrant.It
was solely at the recommendation of the confessor, that I was imprisoned
four years in the Ursuline Convent.As my confessor was also the
confessor of the convent, he called himself my guardian and protector,
and recommended me to the special care of the Mother Abbess, and her
holy nuns, the teachers, who spent much of their time in the school
department.As my father paid a high price, quarterly, for my tuition
and board, I had a good room to myself, my living was of the best kind,
and I always had wine at dinner.The nuns, my teachers, took much more
pains to teach me the fear of the Pope, bishops and confessors, than
the fear of God, or the love of virtue.In fact, with the exception of a
little Latin and embroidery, which I learned in those four years, I came
out as ignorant as I was before, unless a little hypocrisy may be called
a useful accomplishment.For, of all human beings on earth, none can
teach hypocrisy so well as the Romish priests and nuns.In the school
department young ladies seldom have much to complain of, unless they are
charity scholars; in that case the poor girls have to put up with very
poor fare, and much hard work, hard usage and even heavy blows; how my
heart has ached for some of those unfortunate girls, who are treated
more like brutes, than human beings, because they are orphans, and poor.Yet they in justice are entitled to good treatment, for thousands of
scudi (dollars) are sent as donations to the convents for the support
of these orphans, every year, by benevolent individuals.So that as poor
and unfortunate as these girls are, they are a source of revenue to the
convents.For the first three years of my convent life, I passed the time in
the school department, without much anxiety of mind.I was gay and
thoughtless, my great trouble was to find something to amuse myself,
and kill time in some way.Though I treated all the school-mates with
kindness, and true Italian politeness, I became intimate with only one.She was a beautiful girl, from the dukedom of Tuscany.She made me her
confidant, and told me all her heart.Her parents were wealthy, and both
very strict members of the Romish Church.But she had an aunt in the
city of Geneva, who was a follower of John Calvin, or a member of the
Christian church of Switzerland.This aunt had been yearly a visitor at
her father's house.She being her father's only sister, an affectionate
intimacy was formed between the aunt and niece.The aunt, being a very
pious, amiable woman, felt it her duty to impress the mind of the niece,
with the superiority of the religion of the holy bible over popish
traditions; and the truth of the Scriptures soon found its way to the
heart of my young friend.But her confessor soon found out that some
change was going on in her mind, and told her father.There were
only two ways to save her soul from utter ruin; one was to give her
absolution and kill her before she got entirely out of the holy mother
church; the other, was to send her to the Ursuline convent at Naples,
where by the zeal and piety of those celebrated nuns, she might be
secured from further heresy.From this, the best friend of my school days, I learned more about God's
word, and virtue, and truth, and the value of the soul, than from all
other sources.There was a garden surrounded by a high wall, in which we
frequently walked, and whispered to each other, though we trembled all
the while for fear our confessor would by some means, find out that we
looked upon the Romish church as the Babylon destined to destruction,
plainly spoken of by St.My young friend stood in great fear of the priests; she trembled at the
very sight of one.Her aunt had read to her the history and sufferings of the persecuted
Protestants of Europe.She was a frail, and timid girl, yet such was the
depth of her piety and the fervor of her religious faith, that she often
declared to me that she would prefer death to the abandonment of those
heavenly principles she had embraced, which were the source of her
joy and hope.Her aunt gave her a pocket New Testament, in the Italian
language, which she prized above all the treasures of earth, and carried
with her carefully, wherever she went.I borrowed it and read it every
opportunity I had.I took much
pains to commit to memory all I could of the blessed book, for in
case of our separation, I knew not where I could obtain another.My
god-father who was a bishop, called to see me on my fifteenth birth day,
and presented me with a splendid gold watch and chain richly studded
with jewels, made in England, and valued at 200 scudi, saying that
he had it imported expressly for my use.I had also several diamond
articles of jewelry, presents I had received from my father from time to
time.I had also, in my purse, 100 scudi in gold, which I had saved from
my pin money.All the above property, I should have cheerfully given for
a copy of the Holy Bible, in my own beautiful Italian language.A few
months after I received the rich present from the Bishop, he called with
my father and my confessor to see me.My heart almost came into my mouth
when I saw them alight from my father's carriage, and enter the chapel
door of the convent.Very soon the lady porter came to me and said,
"Signorina, you are wanted in the parlor."As my Tuscan friend had taught me to pray, and ask the Lord Jesus for
grace and strength, I walked into my room, locked the door, and on my
knees, called upon the Lord to save me from becoming a nun--for I
knew then it was a determination on the part of the Abbess, bishop
and confessor, that I should take the veil.I was the only child, and
heiress of an immense fortune, of course, too good a prize to be lost.After a short and fervent prayer to my Lord and Saviour, I walked down
to see what was to be my doom.I kissed my father's cheek, and kissed
the hands of the Bishop and confessor--yet my very soul revolted
from the touch of these whited sepulchres.All received me with great
cordiality, yea, even more than usual affection.Soon after our meeting,
my father asked permission of the Bishop to speak to me privately and
taking me into a small room, said to me, "My dear daughter, you are not
aware of the great misfortune that has recently come upon your father.While I was excited with wine at the card-table last evening, betting
high and winning vast sums of money, I so far forgot myself and my duty
to the laws of the country, that I called for a toast, and induced
a number of my inebriated companions to drink the health of Italian
liberty, and we all drank and gave three cheers for liberty and a
liberal constitution.A Benedictine Friar being present, took all our
names to the Commissary General, and offered to be a witness against
us in the King's Court.As this is my first and only offence, the holy
Bishop your god-father offers on certain conditions, to visit Rome
immediately on my behalf, and secure the mediation of the holy Father
Pius IX.Your venerable god-father has great influence at Rome, being
a special favorite with his holiness, and his holiness can obtain any
favor he asks of King Ferdinand.So if you will only consent to take the
Black Veil, your father will be saved from the State prison."This was terrible news to my young and palpitating heart.It was the
first heavy blow that I had experienced in this vale of tears.I did not
speak for some minutes; I could not.My trembling bosom heaved like the
waves of the ocean before the blast.My veins were almost bursting; my
hands and feet became as cold as marble, and when I attempted to speak
my words seemed ready to choke me to death.I fell upon my knees and called upon God for mercy and help.My
father, thinking I had gone mad, was greatly alarmed.The Bishop
and confessor, who were anxiously waiting the result of my father's
proposition, hearing my father weep and sob aloud, came in to see what
the matter was.In the midst of my prayer, I fainted away, and became
entirely unconscious.When I came to myself, I found myself on the bed.As I opened my eyes, it all seemed like a dream.The abbess spoke to me
very kindly, and sprinkled my bed with holy water, and at the same time
laid a large bronze crucifix on my breast, saying that Satan must be
driven from my soul, for had it not been for the devil, I would have
leaped for joy, and not fainted when father mentioned the black veil."No," said the holy mother, "had it not been for the devil you would
rejoice to take the holy black veil blessed by the Holy Madonna and the
blessed saints Clara and Theresa.It is a holy privilege that very few
can enjoy on earth.Yea, my daughter, there can not be a greater sin
in the sight of the Madonna and the blessed saints, than to reject a
secluded life.Yea," said the crafty old nun, (who was thinking much
more about my gold, than my soul,) "I never knew a young lady who had
the offer of becoming a nun and rejected it, who ever came to a good
end.If they refuse, and marry, they generally die in child-bed with the
first child, or they will marry cruel husbands, who beat them and kill
them by inches.Therefore, dear daughter, let me most affectionately
warn you as you have had the honor of being selected by the holy Bishop
and our holy confessor to the high dignity and privilege of a professed
nun, of the order of St.Ursula, reject it not at your peril.Be
assured, heaven knows how to punish such rebellion."My head ached so violently at the time, and I was so feverish that I
begged the old woman to send for my mother, and to talk to me no more on
the subject of the black veil, but to drop it until some future time.In
my agony on account of the foul plot against my liberty, my virtue, and
my gold, I felt such a passion of rage come upon me, that had I absolute
power for the moment I would have cast every Abbess, Pope, Bishop and
Priest into the bottomless pit.May the Lord forgive me, but I would
have done it at that time with a good will.The greatest comfort I now
had was reading my Tuscan friend's New Testament, or hearing it read by
her when we had a chance to be by ourselves, which was not very often.In the evening of the same day of my illness, father and mother came to
see me, and Satan came also in the shape of the confessor; so that I
had not a moment alone with my dear parents.The confessor feared my
determined opposition to a convent's life, for he had previous to this,
several times in the confessional, dropped hints to me on the great
happiness, purity, serenity and joy of all holy nuns.But I always told
him I would not be a nun for the world.I should be so good, it would
kill me in a short time."No, no, father," said I, "I WILL NOT BE A
NUN."Father spoke to me again of his great misfortune--told me that his trial
would come on in a few days and that he was now at liberty on a
very heavy bail; that the Bishop was only waiting my answer to start
immediately for the holy city, and throw himself at the feet of the holy
Pope to procure father's unconditional pardon from the King.I said
"my dear father, how long will you be imprisoned if you do not get a
pardon?""From two to five years," he replied."My daughter, it is
my first offence, and I have witnesses to prove that the priest who
appeared against me, urged me to drink wine several times after I had
drank a large quantity, and was the direct cause of my saying what
I did."Now it all came to me, that the whole of it was a plot, a
Jesuitical trick, to get my father in the clutches of the law, and then
make a slave of me for life through my sympathy for my dear father.The vile priests knew that I loved my father most ardently; in fact, my
father and mother were the only two beings on earth that I did love.My
mother I loved most tenderly, but my affection for my father was of a
different kind.I loved him most violently, with all the ardor of my
soul.Mother seemed all the home to me; but father was to me all the
world beside.He would frequently
come home, and get me to go out into the garden and play with him,
just as though he was my brother.There we would swing, run, jump and
exercise in several healthy games, common in our climate.He never gave
me an unkind word or an unkind reproof.If I did say anything wrong, he
would take me to my mother and say, "Clara, here I bring you a prisoner,
let her be kept on bread and water till dinner time."Even when mother
had displeased him about some trifle, so that he had not a smile for
her, he always had a smile for his Flora.Even now, while I write, a
chill comes over my frame, while I think of that vile Popish plot.I
said to my father, "You shall not be imprisoned if I can prevent it; at
the same time I do not see any great gain, comfort or profit in having
your only daughter put in prison for life, without the hope of liberty
ever more, to save you from two years imprisonment."At these words, the eyes of the confessor flashed like lurid lightnings;
his very frame shook, as though he had the fever and ague.Truth seemed
so strange to the priest, that he found it hard of digestion.Father
and mother both wept, but made no reply.The idea of putting their only
child in a dungeon for life, though it might be done in the sacred name
of religion, did not seem to give them much comfort "Father," said I, "I
wish to see you at ten o'clock to-morrow morning, without fail--I wish
to see you alone; don't bring mother or any one else with you.You shall
not go to prison, all will yet be well."On account of this reasonable
request, to see my father alone, the confessor arose in a terrible rage
and left the apartment As quick as the mad priest left us to ourselves,
I told my father my plan, or what I would like to do with his
permission.My plan was, for my mother and myself to get into our
carriage and drive to the palace of King Ferdinand and make him
acquainted with all the truth; for I was aware from what I had heard,
that the King had heard only the priest's side of the story.My father
stood in such fear of the priests that he only consented to my plan with
great reluctance, saying that we ought first to make our plan known to
the confessor, lest he should be offended.To this my mother responded,
saying, "My daughter, it would be very wrong for us to go to the King,
or take any step without the advice of our spiritual guide."Here,
I felt it to be my duty to reveal to my deceived parents some of the
secrets of the confessional, though I might, in their estimation,
be guilty of an unpardonable sin by breaking the seal of iniquity.I
revealed to my parents the frequent efforts of the priest to obtain my
consent to take the veil, and that I had opposed from first to last,
every argument made use of to rob me of the society of my parents, of my
liberty, and of everything I held dear on earth.As to the happiness of
the nuns so much talked of by the priests, from what I had seen in their
daily walk and general deportment, I was fully convinced that there was
no reality in it; they were mere slaves to their superiors, and not half
so happy as the free slaves on a plantation who have a kind master.My
parents saw my determination to resist to the death every plan for my
imprisonment in the hateful nunnery.Therefore they promised that I
should have the opportunity to see the King on the morrow in company
with my mother.On the following day, at twelve o'clock, we left the convent in our
carriage for the palace.We were very politely received by the gentleman
usher, who conducted us to seats in the reception-room.After sending
our cards to the king, we waited nearly one hour before he made his
appearance.His majesty received us with much kindness, raised us
immediately from our knees, and demanded our business.I was greatly
embarrassed at first, but the frank and cordial manner of the sovereign
soon restored me to my equilibrium, and I spoke freely in behalf of my
dear father.The king heard me through very patiently, with apparent
interest, and said, "Signorina, I am inclined to believe you have spoken
the truth; and as your father has always been a good loyal subject, I
shall, for your sake, forgive him this offence; but let him beware that
henceforth, wine or no wine, he does not trespass against the laws
of the kingdom, for a second offence I will not pardon.Go in peace,
signoras, you have my royal word."We thanked his majesty, and returned to our home with the joyful
tidings.My father, who had been waiting the
result of our visit to the palace with great impatience, received us
with open arms, and pressed us to his heart again and again.I was so excited that, long before we got to him, I cried out, "All is
well, all is well, father.We drove
home, and father went immediately to spread the happy news amongst
his friends.All our faithful domestics, including my old affectionate
nurse, were so overjoyed at the news that they danced about like
maniacs.My father was always a very indulgent and liberal master,
furnished his servants with the best of Italian fare, plenty of
fresh beef, wine, and macaroni.We had scarcely got rested, when our
tormenter, the confessor, came into our room and said, "Signoras, what
is the meaning of all this fandango and folly amongst the servants?ARE
THE HERETICS ALL KILLED, that there should be such joy, or has the queen
been delivered of a son, an heir to the throne?"My dear mother was now as pale as death, and silent, for she saw that
the priest was awfully enraged; for, although he feigned to smile, his
smile was similar to that of the hyena when digging his prey out of
the grave.The priest's dark and villainous visage had the effect of
confirming in my mother's mind all the truth regarding the plot to
enslave me for life, and secure all my father's estate to the pockets
of the priests.The confessor was now terribly mad, for two obvious
reasons: one was because he was not received by us with our usual
cordiality and blind affection; the other, because, by the king's
pardon, I was not under the necessity to sacrifice my liberty and
happiness for life to save my father from prison; and what tormented him
the most was, that he believed that I, though young, could understand
and thwart his hellish plans.As my mother trembled and was silent,
fearing the priest was cursing her and her only daughter in his
heart,--for the priests tell such awful stories about the effects of a
priest's curse that the great mass of the Italian people fear it more
than the plague or any earthly misfortune.Peter is the doorkeeper of the great
city of God, the heavenly Jerusalem, that he has the keys of the kingdom
of heaven, and has received strict orders not to admit any soul, under
any circumstances, who has been cursed by a holy priest, unless that
curse has been removed by the same priest in the tribunal of penance.I
was obliged to speak to his reverence, and I felt so free, so happy in
Christ as my only hope, that I opened my mind to the priest very freely,
and told him what I thought of him and his plot."Sir priest," said I,
"I shall never return to the convent to stay long.As soon as the time
for my education ends, I shall return to liberty and domestic life.I
am not made of the proper material to make a nun of.I love the social
domestic circle; I love my father and mother, and all our domestics,
even the dogs and the cats, pigeons, and canaries, the fish-ponds,
play-grounds, gardens, rivers, and landscapes, mountain and ocean,--all
the works of God I love.I shall live out of the convent to enjoy these
things; therefore, reverend sir, if you value my peace and good-will,
never speak to me or my parents on the subject of my becoming a nun in
any convent.I shall prefer death to the loss of my personal liberty."I was so decided, and had received such strength and grace from heaven,
that the priest was dumbfounded,--my smooth stone out of the sling
had hit him in the right place.After much effort to appear bland and
good-natured, he drew near my chair, seized my hand, and said, "My dear
daughter, you mistake me.I love you as a daughter, I wish only your
happiness.Your god-father, the holy Bishop, does not intend that you
shall remain a common nun more than a year.After the first year you
shall be raised to the highest dignity in the convent.You shall be the
Lady Superior, and all the nuns shall bow at your feet, and implicitly
obey your commands.Clara is now very old, and his lordship wishes
soon to fill her place.For that purpose he has selected his adopted
daughter.Your talents, education, wealth, and high position in society,
eminently fit you for one of the highest dignities on earth.""A thousand thanks for the kindness of my lord Bishop," said I; "but
your reverence has not altered my mind in the least.I can never bow
down to the feet of any Lady Superior, neither will I ever consent to
see a single human being degraded at my feet.The holy Bible says, 'Thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.'"exclaimed the priest, "Where did you see that dangerous
book?Know you not that his holiness the Pope has placed it in the
Index Expurgatorius, because it has been the means of the damnation of
millions of souls?Not because it is in itself a bad book, but because
it is a theological work, prepared only for the priests and ministers of
our holy religion.Therefore, it is always a very dangerous book in
the hands of women or laymen, who wrest the Scriptures to their own
destruction.""Well, reverend sir," I replied, "you seem determined to differ from the
Lord Jesus and his apostles.I read in the New Testament that we should
search the Scriptures because they testify of Christ.And one of the
apostles, I don't remember which, said, 'all scripture is given by the
inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine and for instruction
in righteousness.'Now, reverend sir, if the people have souls, as well
as the priests, why should they not read the word of God which speaks of
Christ and is profitable for instruction?"exclaimed the priest, "and you talk very
much like one."His countenance changed to a pale sickly hue, as he
said, "My daughter, where did you get that dangerous book?If you have,
it in your possession, give it to me, and I will bless you, and pray for
you to the blessed Madonna that she may save you from the infernal pit
of heresy.""I do not own the blessed book," said I, "but I wish I did.I would give
one hundred scudi in gold for a copy of the New Testament.I borrowed a
copy from a friend, and returned it to the owner again.But I understand
that there are copies to be had in London, and when I have a good
opportunity I shall send for a copy, if I can do it unbeknown to any
one.""I shall be in the tribunal of
penance at six o'clock P.M.You need
pardon immediately, and spiritual advice.Should you die as you now are
without absolution, you would be lost and damned forever.I tremble for
you, my dear daughter, seeing that the devil has got such a powerful
hold of you.It may even be absolutely necessary to kill the body to
save your soul; for should you relapse again into heresy after due
penance for this crime has been performed, it would be impossible to
renew you again to repentance, seeing you crucify the Lord and the
Madonna afresh, and put them to an open shame."Here my mother fainted and shook like an aspen leaf.But God gave me
strength, and I said in a moment that as his reverence thought my sins
so great, I would not go to any man, no, not even to the Pope; I
would go to God alone, and leave my cause in his hands, life or death."Therefore, reverend sir, I shall save you from all further trouble in
attending the confessional any more on my account.From henceforth no
earthly power shall drag me alive and with my consent to the tribunal of
penance."exclaimed the priest furiously, "are you mad?There are ten
thousand devils in you, and we must drive them out by some means."After
this discharge of priestly venom, the priest left in a rage giving the
door a terrible slam, which awoke my mother from her sorrowful trance.During the whole conversation, such was the electrical power of the
priest over my mother's weak and nervous system, that if she attempted
to say a word in my behalf, the keen, snakish black eye of the priest
would at once make her tremble and quail before him, and the half
uttered word would remain silent on her lips.The priest went at once
in search of my father.He came home boiling over with rage, saying he
wished I had never been born.The
cause of all this paternal fury upon my poor devoted head was the foul
misrepresentations of my father confessor, who was now in league with
the Bishop, both determined to shut me up in a prison convent, or end my
mortal career.My poor mother remained mute and heart-broken.My sweet mother; never
did she utter one word of unkindness to me; her very look to the last
was one of gentleness and love.But my father loved honor and reputation
amongst men above all other things.The idea of being the father of an
accursed heretic, tormented his pride, and he being suspected of heresy
himself caused him to be forsaken by many of his proud friends and
acquaintances.He was even insulted in the streets by the numerous
Lazaroni, with the epithet of Maldito Corrobonari, so that I lost my
father's love.And when the confessor told him there was no other way
to save me from hell than an entire life of penance in a convent, he
heartily and freely gave his consent.Mother, my own sweet mother, my
only remaining friend, turned as pale as death, but was enabled to say a
word in my behalf.I saw that my earthly doom was sealed; there was not a single voice in
all Naples to save me from imprisonment for life.Not a tongue in four
hundred thousand that would dare speak one word in my behalf.Father
commanded me to get ready to leave his house forever that very night,
saying the carriage and confessor would be on hand to take me away at
eight o'clock P.M., by moonlight.I got on my knees and begged my father
as a last request that he would allow me to remain three days with my
mother, but he refused.Said he, "That is now beyond my power.Not an
hour can you remain after eight o'clock."As I knew not when I should see my Tuscan friend again, I begged the
privilege of seeing her for a few moments.I was anxious to ask her
prayers and sympathy, and to put her on her guard, for should the
priests discover her New Testament, they would punish her as they did
me, or as they intended to do to me.But this favor was denied me, and I
could not write to her, for all letters of the scholars in the
convents, are opened under the pretence to prevent them from receiving
love-letters.The Romish church keeps all her dark plans a secret, but
never allows any secret to be kept from the priests.I went into my room to bid farewell to my home forever.I fell on my
knees and prayed to God for his dear Son's sake to help me, to give me
patience, and to keep me from the sin of suicide.The more I thought
of my utterly unprotected situation and of the savage disposition of my
foes, the priests, the more I thought of the propriety of taking my own
life, rather than live in a dungeon all my days.Such was the power of
superstition over our domestics that they looked upon me as one accursed
of the church, a Protestant heretic, and not one of them would take my
hand or bid me good bye.At tea-time I was not allowed to sit at table
with father, mother, and the confessor, as formerly.But I had my supper
sent up to my room.A short time after the bell rang for vespers, the carriage being ready,
my father and the confessor with myself and one small trunk got into the
best seats inside, and rode off at a rapid rate.I kept my veil over my
face, and said not a word neither did I shed a single tear; my sorrow,
and indignation was too deep for utterance or even for tears.The priest
and my father uttered not a word.Perhaps my father's conscience
made him ashamed of such vile work--that of laying violent hands on a
defenceless girl of eighteen years of age, for no crime whatever, only
the love of liberty and pure Bible religion.But if the priest was
silent, his vile countenance indicated a degree of hellish pleasure and
satisfaction.Never did piratical captain glory more in seeing a rich
prize along side with all hands killed and out of the way, than my
reverend confessor; yet a short time before he said he loved me as a
daughter.Yes, he did love me, as the wolf loves the lamb, as the cat
loves the mouse and as the boa constrictor the beautiful gazelle.To
my momentary satisfaction we entered the big gate of St.Ursula, for
although I knew I should suffer there perhaps even death, there was some
satisfaction in seeing a few faces that I had seen in my gay and happy
days, now alas!I was somewhat grieved by the cold
reception I received.But none
of these things moved me; I looked to God for strength, for I felt that
He alone could nerve me for the conflict.The hardest blow of all was,
my dear father left me at the mercy of the priest without one kind look
or word.He did not even shake hands with me, nor did he say farewell.Oh Popery, what a mysterious power is thine!Thou canst in a few hours
destroy powerful love which it took long years to cement in loving
hearts.When my father had left and I heard the porter lock the heavy
iron gate I felt an exquisite wretchedness come over me.I would have
given worlds for death at that moment.In a few moments the priest rung
a bell, and the old Jezebel the mother Abbess made her appearance."Take
this heretic, Holy Mother, and place her in confinement in the lower
regions; GIVE HER BREAD AND WATER ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS, THE WATER
THAT YOU HAVE WASHED YOUR SACRED FEET IN, NO OTHER; give her straw
to sleep on, but no pillow.Take all her clothing away and give her a
coarse tunic; one single coarse garment to cover her nakedness, but no
shoes.She has grievously sinned against the holy mother church, and now
she mercifully imposes upon her years of severe penance, that her body
of sin may be destroyed and her soul saved after suffering one million
of years in holy purgatory.Our chief duty now, holy mother, in order
to save this lost soul from mortal sin will be to examine her carefully
every, day to ascertain if possible what she most dislikes, or what
is most revolting to her flesh, that whatever it may be, she, must be
compelled to perform it whatever it may cost.Let a holy wax candle burn
in her cell at night, until further orders.And let the Tuscan heretic
be treated in the same way.At
the word "Tuscan heretic," possessing the spirit of Christ that I knew
on earth.Yet how true it is that misery loves company; there was even
satisfaction in being near my unfortunate friend though our sufferings
might be unutterable.Still I was unhappy in the thought that she was
suffering on my account.Had I never said a word about borrowing a New
Testament, she would never have been suspected as being the direct
cause of my conversion to the truth, and of my renunciation of the vile
confessional.I was somewhat puzzled to know what kind of a place was meant by the
lower regions; I had never heard of these regions before.But soon two
women in black habits with their faces entirely covered excepting
two small holes for the eyes to peep through, came to me and without
speaking, made signs for me to follow them.I did so without resistance,
and soon found myself in an under-ground story of the infernal building."There is your cell," said the cowled inquisitors, "look all around, see
every thing, but speak not; no not for your life.The softest whisper
will immediately reach the ears of the Mother Abbess, and then you are
loaded with heavy chains until you die, for there must be no talking
or whispering in this holy retreat of penance.And," said my jailor
further, "take off your clothes, shoes and stockings, and put on this
holy coarse garment which will chafe thy flesh but will bless thy soul.Francis saved many souls by this holy garment."As resistance was worse than useless, I complied, and soon found my poor
feet aching with the cold on the bare stone floor.I was soon made to
feel the blessing of St.My sufferings were
indescribable.It seemed as though ten thousand bees had stung me in
every part.I laid on my
coarse straw and groaned and sighed for death to come and relieve me of
my anguish.As soon as the holy wax candle was left with me I took it
in my hand and went forth to survey my dungeon; but I did not enjoy
my ramble.In one of the cells, I found my Tuscan friend--that dear
Christian sister--in great agony, having had on the accursed garment for
several days.Her body was one entire blister, and very much inflamed.Her bones were racked with pain, as with the most excruciating
inflammatory rheumatism.We recognized each other; she pointed to heaven
as if to say 'trust in the Lord, my sister, our sufferings will soon
be over.'I kissed my hand to her and returned again to my cell.I
saw other victims half dead and emaciated that made my heart sick.I
refrained from speaking to any one for I feared my condition, wretched
as it was, might be rendered even worse, if possible by the fiends who
had entire power over me.said I to myself, "why was I born?O give my soul patience to suffer every pain."On the fourth day of my imprisonment the jailor brought me some water
and soap, a towel, brush and comb, and the same clothes I wore when I
entered the foul den.They told me to make haste and prepare myself to
appear before the holy Bishop.Hope revived in my soul, for I always
thought that my god-father had some regard for me, and had now come to
release me from the foul den I was in.Cold water seemed to afford much
relief to my tortured body.I made my toilet as quick as I could in such
a place.My feet were so numb and swollen that it was difficult for me
to get my shoes on.At last the Bishop arrived as I supposed, and I
was conducted--not into his presence as I expected, but into that of
my bitterest enemy, the confessor.At the very sight of the monster, I
trembled like a reed shaken by the wind.The priest walked to each of
the doors, locked them, put the keys into a small writing desk, locked
it, took out the key and placed it carefully in his sleeve pocket.This
he did to assure me that we were alone, that not one of the inmates
could by any means disturb for the present the holy meditations of the
priest.He bade me take a seat on the sofa by him.In kind soft words he
said to me, that if I was only docile and obedient, he would cause me
to be treated like a princess, and that in a short time I should have
my liberty if I preferred to return to the world.At the same time he
attempted to put his arm around my waist.While he was talking love to me, I was looking at two large alabaster
vases full of beautiful wax flowers; one of them was as much as I could
lift.Without one thought about consequences, I seized the nearest vase
and threw it with all the strength I had at the priest's head.He fell
like a log and uttered one or two groans.It
struck the priest on the right temple, close to the ear.For a moment I
listened to see if any one were coming.I then looked at the priest, and
saw the blood running out of his wound.I quaked with fear lest I had
killed the destroyer of my peace.I did not intend to kill him, I only
wished to stun him, that I might take the keys, open the door and run,
for the back door of the priest's room led right into a back path where
the gates were frequently opened daring the day time.This was about
twelve o'clock, and a most favorable moment for me to escape.In a
moment I had searched the sleeve pocket of the priest, found the key and
a heavy purse of gold which I secured in my dress pocket.I opened the
little writing desk and took out the key to the back door.I saw that
the priest was not dead, and I had not the least doubt from appearances,
but that he would soon come to.I trembled for fear he might wake before
I could get away.I thought of my dear Tuscan sister in her wretched
cell, but I could not get to her without being discovered.I opened the door with the greatest facility and gained
the opening into the back path.I locked the door after me, and brought
the key with me for a short distance, then placed all the keys tinder
a rock.I had no hat but only a black veil.I threw that over my head
after the fashion of Italy and gained the outer gate.There were masons
at work near the gate which was open and I passed through into the
street without being questioned by any one.As I had not a nun's dress on, no one supposed I belonged to the
Institution.I could speak a
few English words which I had learned from some English friends of my
father.Before I got to where the boats lay I saw a gentleman whom I
took to be an English or American gentleman.He had a pleasant face,
looked at me very kindly, saw my pale dejected face and at once felt a
deep sympathy for me.As I appeared to be in trouble and needed help,
he extended his hand to me and said in tolerable good Italian, "Como va'
le' signorina?"that is "How do you do young lady?""Me," said he, "Americano, Americano, capitano de
Bastimento.""Signor Capitano," said I,
"I wish to go on board your ship and see an American ship.""Well," said
he, "with a great deal of pleasure; my ship lies at anchor, my men are
waiting; you shall dine with me, Signorina."I praised God in my soul for this merciful providence of meeting a
friend, though a stranger, whose face seemed to me so honest and so
true.Any condition, even honest slavery, would have been preferred by
me at that time to a convent.The American ship was the most
beautiful thing I ever saw afloat; splendid and neat in all her cabin
arrangements.The mates were polite, and the sailors appeared neat and
happy.Even the black cook showed his beautiful white teeth, as though
he was glad to see one of the ladies of Italy.Little did
they know at that time what peril I was in should I be found out and
taken back to my dungeon again.I informed the captain of my situation,
of having just escaped from a convent into which I had been forced
against my will.I told him I would pay him my passage to America, if
he would hide me somewhere until the ship was well out to sea.He said
I had come just in time, for he was only waiting for a fair wind, and
hoped to be off that evening."I have," said he, "a large number of
bread-casks on board, and two are empty.I shall have you put into one
of these, in which I shall make augur-holes, so that you can have plenty
of fresh air.Down in the hold amongst the provisions you will be safe."I thanked my kind friend and requested him to buy me some needles, silk,
and cotton thread, and some stuff for a couple of dresses, and one-piece
of fine cotton, so that I might make myself comfortable during the
voyage.After I ate my dinner, the men called the captain and said there were
several boats full of soldiers coming to the ship, accompanied by the
priests."Lady," exclaimed the captain, "they are after you.There is
not a moment to be lost.Smith, tell
the men to be careful and not make known that there is a lady on board."I followed my friend quickly, and soon
found myself coiled in a large cask.The captain coopered the head,
which was missing, and made holes for me to get the air; but the
perspiration ran off my face in a stream.Lots of things were piled on
the cask, so that I had hard work to breathe; but such was my fear
of the priests that I would rather have perished in the cask than be
returned to die by inches.The captain had been gone but a short time when I heard steps on deck,
and much noise and confusion.As the hatches were open, I could hear
very distinctly.After the whole company were on deck, the captain
invited the priests and friars, about twenty in number, to walk down to
the cabin, and explain the cause of their visit.They talked through an
interpreter, and said that "a woman of bad character had robbed one of
the churches of a large amount of gold, had attempted to murder one
of the holy priests, but they were happy to say that the holy father,
though badly wounded, was in a fair way of recovery.This woman is
young, but very desperate, has awful raving fits, and has recently
escaped from a lunatic institution.When her fits of madness come on
they are obliged to put her into a straight jacket, for she is the most
dangerous person in Italy.A great reward is offered for her by her
father and the government--five thousand scudi.Is not this enough to
tempt one to help find her?She was seen coming towards the shipping,
and we want the privilege of searching your ship.""Gentlemen," said the captain, "I do not know that the Italian
authorities have any right to search an American ship, under the stars
and stripes of the United States, for we do not allow even the greatest
naval power on earth to do that thing.But if such a mad and dangerous
woman as you have described should by any means have smuggled herself
on board my ship, you are quite welcome to take her away as soon as
possible, for I should be afraid of my life if I was within one hundred
yards of such an unfortunate creature.If you can get her into your
lunatic asylum, the quicker the better; and the five thousand scudi will
come in good time, for I am thinking of building me a larger ship on my
return home.Now, gentlemen, come; I will assist you, for I should like
to see the gold in my pocket."The captain opened all his closets and
secret places, in the cabin and forecastle and in the hold; everything
was searched, all but the identical bread-cask in which I was snugly
coiled.After something like half an hour's search, the soldiers of King
Ferdinand and the priests of King Pope left the ship, satisfied that the
crazy nun was not on board; for, judging the captain by themselves, they
thought he certainly would have given up a mad woman for the sake of
five thousand scudi in gold, and for the safety of his own peace and
comfort.A few moments after the Pope's friends had left, the excellent
benevolent captain came down, and speedily and gently knocking off a
few hoops with a hammer, took the head out, and I was free once more
to breathe God's free air.I lifted my trembling heart in thanksgiving,
while tears of gratitude rolled down my cheeks.Yet, as we were still
within the reach of the guns of the papal forts, my heart was by no
means at rest.But the good captain assured me repeatedly that
all danger was past, for he had twenty-five men on board, all true
Protestants, and he declared that all the priests of Naples would walk
over their dead bodies before they should reach his vessel a second
time."And besides," said the captain, "there are two American
men-of-war in port, who will stand up for the rights of Americans.They
have not yet forgotten Captain Ingraham, of the United States ship
St.Louis, and his rescue from the Austrian <DW7>s of the Hungarian
patriot, Martin Kozsta."The captain wisely refused to purchase any
needles or thread for me on shore, or any articles of ladies' dress,
for fear of the Jesuitical spies, who might surmise something and cause
further trouble.But he kindly furnished me with some goods he had
purchased for his own wife, and there were needles and silk enough on
board, so that I soon cut and made a few articles that made me very
comfortable during our voyage of thirty-two days to London.Early the next morning we sailed out of the beautiful harbor of Naples,
with a fair wind.The beautiful ship seemed to fly over the blue sea.I staid on deck gazing at my native city as long as I could.I thought
then of my once happy home, of my poor, broken-hearted mother, of my
unhappy father.Although he had cast me off through the foul play of
Jesuitical intrigue, my love for my dear father remained the same."Farewell, my dear Italy," I said to myself."When, my poor native land,
wilt thou be happy?Never, never, so long as the Pope lives, and his
wicked, murderous priests, to curse thee by their power."After we got out into the open sea, the motion of the ship made me feel
very sick, and I was so starved out before I came on board, that what
good provisions I ate on board did not seem to agree with me.My stomach
was in a very bad state, for while I was in the lower regions of the
convent I ate only a small quantity of very stale hard bread once in
twenty-four hours, at the ringing of the vesper bells every evening, and
the water given me was that in which the holy Mother Abbess had washed
her sacred feet.But I must give the holy mother credit for one good
omission--she did not use any soap.The captain gave me a good state-room which I occupied with an English
lady passenger.This good lady was accustomed to the sea, therefore, she
did not suffer any inconvenience from sea-sickness; but I was very sick,
so that I kept my berth for five days.This good Protestant lady was
very kind and attentive during the whole passage, and kindly assisted me
in getting my garments made up on board.On our arrival in London, the
captain said that he would sail for America in two weeks time, and very
kindly offered me a free passage to his happy, native land; and I could
not persuade him to take any money for my passage from Naples, nor for
the clothing he had given me.My fellow passenger being wealthy, and well acquainted with people in
England, took me to her splendid home, a few miles from London.At her
residence I was introduced to a young French gentleman, a member of the
Evangelical protestant church in France, and a descendant of the pious
persecuted Huguenots.This gentleman speaks good English and Italian,
having enjoyed the privilege of a superior education.His fervent
prayers at the family altar morning and evening made a very deep
impression on my mind.He became deeply interested in my history, and
offered to take me to France, after I should become his lawful wife.Though I did not like the idea of choosing another popish country for my
residence, yet as my friend assured me that I should enjoy my protestant
religion unmolested, I gave him my hand and my heart.My lady fellow
passenger was my bridesmaid.We were married by a good protestant
minister.My husband is a wealthy merchant--gives me means and
opportunities for doing good.Our
home is one of piety and peace and happiness.The blessed Bible is read
by us every day.Morning and evening we sing God's praise, and call upon
the name of the Lord.Our prayer is that God may deliver beloved France
and Italy from the curse of popery.Another proof of the persecuting spirit of Rome is furnished by the
"Narrative of Raffaele Ciocci, formerly a Benedictine Monk, but who now
'comes forth from Inquisitorial search and torture, and tells us what
he has seen, heard and felt.'"We can make but a few extracts from
this interesting little volume, published by the American and Foreign
Christian Union, who,--to use their own language--"send it forth as a
voice of instruction and warning to the American people.They are not to be set aside by an apology for the
dark ages, nor an appeal to the refinement of the nineteenth century.Here is Rome, not as she WAS in the midnight of the world, but as she
IS at the present moment.There is the same opposition to private
judgment--the same coercive measures--the same cruel persecution--the
same efforts to crush the civil and religious liberties of her own
subjects, for which she has ever been characterized."Ciocci, compelled at an early age to enter the Catholic College--forced,
notwithstanding his deep disgust and earnest remonstrance, to become a
monk--imprisoned--deceived--the victim of priestly artifice and fraud,
at length becomes a Christian.He is of course thrown into a deeper
dungeon; and more exquisite anguish inflicted upon him that he may be
constrained to return to the Romish faith.Of his imprisonment he says,
"We traversed long corridors till we arrived at the door of an apartment
which they requested me to enter, and they themselves retired.On
opening the door I found myself in a close dark room, barely large
enough for the little furniture it contained, which consisted of a small
hard bed, hard as the conscience of an inquisitor, a little table cut
all over, and a dirty ill-used chair.The window which was shut and
barred with iron resisted all my efforts to open it My heart sunk within
me, and I began to cogitate on the destiny in store for me."The Jesuit
Giuliani entering his room, he asked that the window might be opened
for the admission of light and air.Before the words were finished he
exclaimed in a voice of thunder, "How!wretched youth, thou complainest
of the dark, whilst thou art living in the clouds of error?Dost thou
desire the light of heaven, while thou rejectest the light of the
Catholic faith?"Ciocci saw that remonstrance was useless, but he reminded his jailer
that he had been sent there for three days, to receive instruction, not
to be treated as a criminal."For three days," he resumed, counterfeiting my tone of voice, "for
three days!The dainty youth will not forsooth,
be roughly treated; it remains to be seen whether he desires to be
courteously entertained.Fortunate is it for thee that thou art come to this place.THOU WILT
NEVER quit it excepting with the real fruits of repentance!Among these
silent shades canst thou meditate at thy leisure upon the deplorable
state into which thou hast fallen.Woe unto thee, if thou refusest to
listen to the voice of God, who conducts souls into solitude that he
may speak with them.""So saying," he continues, "he abruptly left me.I
remained alone drooping under the weight of a misfortune, which was the
more severe, because totally unexpected.I stood, I know not how long,
in the same position, but on recovering from this lethargy, my first
idea was of flight.Without giving a minute account of the manner
in which I passed my wearisome days and nights in this prison, let it
suffice to say that they were spent in listening to sermons preached to
me four times a day by the fathers Giuliani and Rossini, and in the most
gloomy reflections."In the mean time the miseries I endured were aggravated by the heat of
the season, the wretchedness of the chamber, scantiness of food, and the
rough severity of those by whom I was occasionally visited.Uncertainty
as to when this imprisonment would be at an end, almost drove me wild,
and the first words I addressed to those who approached me were, 'Have
the kindness to tell me when I shall be permitted to leave this place?'One replied, 'My son, think of hell.'I interrogated another; the answer
was, 'Think my son, how terrible is the death of the sinner!'I spoke
to a third, to a fourth, and one said to me, 'My son, what will be your
feeling, if, on the day of judgment you find yourself on the left hand
of God?'the other, 'Paradise, my son, Paradise!'No one gave me a
direct answer; their object appeared to be to mistify and confound me.After the first few days, I began to feel most severely the want of
a change of clothing.Accustomed to cleanliness, I found myself
constrained to wear soiled apparel.* * * For the want of a comb, my
hair became rough and entangled.After the fourth day my portion of food
was diminished; a sign, that they were pressing the siege, that it was
their intention to adopt both assault and blockade--to conquer me by
arms, or induce me to capitulate through hunger.I had been shut up in
this wretched place for thirteen days, when, one day, about noon, the
Father Mislei, the author of all my misery, entered my cell."At the sight of this man, resentment overcame every other
consideration, and I advanced towards him fully prepared to indulge my
feelings, when he, with his usual smile, expressed in bland words
his deep regret at having been the cause of my long detention in this
retreat.'Never could I have supposed,' said he, 'that my anxiety
for the salvation of your soul would have brought you into so much
tribulation.But rest assured the fault is not entirely mine.You have
yourself, in a great degree, by your useless obstinacy, been the cause
of your sufferings.Ah, well, we will yet remedy all.'Not feeling any
confidence in his assurance, I burst out into bitter invectives and
fierce words.He then renewed his protestations, and clothed them with
such a semblance of honesty and truth, that when he ended with this
tender conclusion, 'Be assured, my son, that I love you,' my anger
vanished.* * * I lost sight of the Jesuit, and thought I was addressing
a man, a being capable of sympathising in the distresses of others.'Ah,
well, father,' said I, 'I need some one on whom I can rely, some one
towards whom I can feel kindly; I will therefore place confidence in
your words.'"After some further conversation, Ciocci was asked if
he wished to leave that place.he replied, "what a
strange question!You might as well ask a condemned soul whether he
desires to escape from hell!"At these words the Jesuit started like a
goaded animal, and, forgetting his mission of deceiver, with, knit brows
and compressed lips, he allowed his ferocious soul for one moment
to appear; but, having grown old in deceit, he immediately had the
circumspection to give this movement of rage the appearance of religious
zeal, and exclaimed, "What comparisons are these?Are you not ashamed to
assume the language of the Atheist?By speaking in this way you clearly
manifest how little you deserve to leave this place.But since I have
told you that I love you, I will give you a proof of it by thinking no
more of those irreligious expressions; they shall be forgotten as though
they had never been spoken.Well, the Cardinal proposes to you an easy
way of returning to your monastery.""Here is
the way," said he, presenting me with a paper: "copy this with your
own hand; nothing more will be required of you.""I took the paper with
convulsive eagerness.It was a recantation of my faith, there condemned
as erroneous.* * * Upon reading this, I shuddered, and, starting to my
feet, in a solemn attitude and with a firm voice, exclaimed, 'Kill me,
if you please; my life is in your power; but never will I subscribe
to that iniquitous formulary.'The Jesuit, after laboring in vain
to persuade me to his wishes, went away in anger.I now momentarily
expected to be conducted to the torture.Whenever I was taken from my
room to the chapel, I feared lest some trap-door should open beneath
my feet, and therefore took great care to tread in the footsteps of the
Jesuit who preceded me.No one acquainted with the Inquisition will say
that my precaution was needless.My imagination was so filled with the
horrors of this place, that even in my short, interrupted, and feverish
dreams I beheld daggers and axes glittering around me; I heard the noise
of wheels, saw burning piles and heated irons, and woke in convulsive
terror, only to give myself up to gloomy reflections, inspired by the
reality of my situation, and the impressions left by these nocturnal
visions.What tears did I shed in those dreary moments!How innumerable
were the bitter wounds that lacerated my heart!My prayers seemed to me
unworthy to be received by a God of charity, because, notwithstanding
all my efforts to banish from my soul every feeling of resentment
towards my persecutors, hatred returned with redoubled power.I often
repeated the words of Christ, 'Father, forgive them, they know not what
they do;' but immediately a voice would answer, 'This prayer is not
intended for the Jesuits; they resemble not the crucifiers, who were
blind instruments of the rage of the Jews; while these men are fully
conscious of what they are doing; they are the modern Pharisees.'The
reading of the Bible would have afforded me great consolation, but this
was denied me."* * *

The fourteenth day of his imprisonment he was taken to the council
to hear his sentence, when he was again urged to sign the form of
recantation.The Father Rossini then spoke: "You are
decided; let it be, then, as you deserve.Rebellious son of the church,
in the fullness of the power which she has received from Christ, you
shall feel the holy rigor of her laws.She cannot permit tares to grow
with the good seed.She cannot suffer you to remain among her sons and
become the stumbling-block for the ruin of many.Abandon, therefore,
all hope of leaving this place, and of returning to dwell among the
faithful.KNOW, ALL IS FINISHED FOR YOU!"For the conclusion of this narrative we refer the reader to the volume
itself.If any more evidence were needed to show that the spirit of Romanism is
the same to-day that it has ever been, we find it in the account of
a legal prosecution against ten Christians at Beldac, in France,
for holding and attending a public worship not licensed by the civil
authority.They had made repeated, respectful, and earnest applications
to the prefect of the department of Hante-Vienne for the authorization
required by law, and which, in their case, ought to have been given.They persisted in rendering to God that worship
which his own command and their consciences required.For this they were
arraigned as above stated, on the 10th of August, 1855.On the 26th of
January, 1856, the case was decided by the "tribunal," and the three
pastors and one lady, a schoolmistress, were condemned to pay a fine
of one thousand francs each, and some of the others five-hundred francs
each, the whole amount, together with legal expenditures, exceeding the
sum of nine thousand francs.Meantime, the converts continue to hold their worship-meetings in the
woods, barns, and secret places, in order not to be surprised by the
police commissioner, and to avoid new official reports."Thus, you see," says V. De Pressense, in a letter to the 'American and
foreign Christian Union,' "that we are brought back to the religious
meetings of the desert, when the Protestants of the Cevennes evinced
such persevering fidelity.The only difference is, that these Christians
belonged only a short time ago to that church which is now instigating
persecutions against them."DESTRUCTION OF THE INQUISITION IN SPAIN.Lehmanowsky was attached to the part of Napoleon's army
which was stationed in Madrid.L., "I
used to speak freely among the people what I thought of the Priests
and Jesuits, and of the Inquisition.It had been decreed by the Emperor
Napoleon that the Inquisition and the Monasteries should be suppressed,
but the decree, he said, like some of the laws enacted in this country,
was not executed."Months had passed away, and the prisons of the Inquisition had not been
opened.One night, about ten or eleven o'clock, as he was walking one of
the streets of Madrid, two armed men sprang upon him from an alley, and
made a furious attack.He instantly drew his sword, put himself in a
posture of defence, and while struggling with them, he saw at a distance
the lights of the patrols,--French soldiers mounted, who carried
lanterns, and who rode through the streets of the city at all hours of
the night, to preserve order.He called to them in French, and as they
hastened to his assistance, the assailants took to their heels and
escaped; not, however, before he saw by their dress that they belonged
to the guards of the Inquisition.He went immediately to Marshal Soult, then Governor of Madrid, told him
what had taken place, and reminded him of the decree to suppress this
institution.Marshal Soult told him that he might go and suppress it The
Colonel said that his regiment (the 9th.of the Polish Lancers,) was not
sufficient for such a service, but if he would give him two additional
regiments, the 117th, and another which he named, he would undertake the
work.The 117th regiment was under the command of Col.De Lile, who
is now, like Col.L., a minister of the gospel, and pastor of an
evangelical church in Marseilles, France."The troops required were
granted, and I proceeded," said Col.L., "to the Inquisition which was
situated about five miles from the city.It was surrounded by a wall of
great strength, and defended by a company of soldiers.When we arrived
at the walls, I addressed one of the sentinels, and summoned the holy
fathers to surrender to the Imperial army, and open the gates of the
Inquisition.The sentinel who was standing on the wall, appeared to
enter into conversation with some one within, at the close of which he
presented his musket, and shot one of my men.This was the signal of
attack, and I ordered my troops to fire upon those who appeared on the
walls."It was soon obvious that it was an unequal warfare.The soldiers of the
holy office were partially protected by a breast-work upon the walls
which were covered with soldiers, while our troops were in the open
plain, and exposed to a destructive fire.We had no cannon, nor could
we scale the walls, and the gates successfully resisted all attempts at
forcing them.I could not retire and send for cannon to break through
the walls without giving them time to lay a train for blowing us up.I saw that it was necessary to change the mode of attack, and directed
some trees to be cut down and trimmed, to be used as battering rams.Two
of these were taken up by detachments of men, as numerous as could work
to advantage, and brought to bear upon the walls with all the power they
could exert, while the troops kept up a fire to protect them from the
fire poured upon them from the walls.Presently the walls began to
tremble, a breach was made, and the Imperial troops rushed into the
Inquisition.Here we met with an incident, which nothing but Jesuitical
effrontery is equal to.The Inquisitor General, followed by the father
confessors in their priestly robes, all came out of their rooms, as we
were making our way into the interior of the Inquisition, and with long
faces, and arms crossed over their breasts, their fingers resting on
their shoulders, as though they had been deaf to all the noise of
the attack and defence, and had just learned what was going on, they
addressed themselves in the language of rebuke to their own soldiers,
saying, "WHY DO YOU FIGHT OUR FRIENDS, THE FRENCH?"Their intention, no doubt, was to make us think that this defence was
wholly unauthorized by them, hoping, if they could make us believe
that they were friendly, they should have a better opportunity, in the
confusion of the moment, to escape.Their artifice was too shallow, and
did not succeed.I caused them to be placed under guard, and all
the soldiers of the Inquisition to be secured as prisoners.We then
proceeded to examine all the rooms of the stately edifice.We passed
through room after room; found all perfectly in order, richly furnished,
with altars and crucifixes, and wax candles in abundance, but we could
discover no evidences of iniquity being practiced there, nothing of
those peculiar features which we expected to find in an Inquisition.We found splendid paintings, and a rich and extensive library.Here was
beauty and splendor, and the most perfect order on which my eyes
had ever rested.The
ceilings and floors of wood were scoured and highly polished.The marble
floors were arranged with a strict regard to order.There was everything
to please the eye and gratify a cultivated taste; but where were those
horrid instruments of torture, of which we had been told, and where
those dungeons in which human beings were said to be buried alive?The holy father assured us that they had been
belied; that we had seen all; and I was prepared to give up the search,
convinced that this Inquisition was different from others of which I had
heard.De Idle was not so ready as myself to give up the search, and
said to me, "Colonel, you are commander to-day, and as you say, so it
must be; but if you will be advised by me, let this marble floor be
examined.Let water be brought and poured upon it, and we will watch
and see if there is any place through which it passes more freely than
others."I replied to him, "Do as you please, Colonel," and ordered
water to be brought accordingly.The slabs of marble were large and
beautifully polished.When the water had been poured over the floor,
much to the dissatisfaction of the inquisitors, a careful examination
was made of every seam in the floor, to see if the water passed through.De Lile exclaimed that he had found it.By the side of
one of these marble slabs the water passed through fast, as though
there was an opening beneath.All hands were now at work for further
discovery; the officers with their swords and the soldiers with their
bayonets, seeking to clear out the seam, and pry up the slab; others
with the butts of their muskets striking the slab with all their might
to break it, while the priests remonstrated against our desecrating
their holy and beautiful house.While thus engaged, a soldier, who was
striking with the butt of his musket, struck a spring, and the marble
slab flew up.Then the faces of the inquisitors grew pale as Belshazzar
when the hand writing appeared on the wall; they trembled all over;
beneath the marble slab, now partly up, there was a stair-case.I
stepped to the altar, and took from the candlestick one of the candles
four feet in length, which was burning that I might explore the room
below.As I was doing this, I was arrested by one of the inquisitors,
who laid his hand gently on my arm, and with a very demure and holy look
said "My son, you must not take those lights with your bloody hands they
are holy.""Well," said I, "I will take a holy thing to shed light
on iniquity; I will bear the responsibility."I took the candle, and
proceeded down the stair-case.As we reached the foot of the stairs
we entered a large room which was called the hall of judgment.In the
centre of it was a large block, and a chain fastened to it.On this they
were accustomed to place the accused, chained to his seat.On one side
of the room was an elevated seat called the Throne of Judgment.This,
the Inquisitor General occupied, and on either side were seats less
elevated, for the holy fathers when engaged in the solemn business of
the Holy Inquisition.From this room we proceeded to the right, and obtained access to small
cells extending the entire length of the edifice; and here such sights
were presented as we hoped never to see again.Three cells were places
of solitary confinement, where the wretched objects of inquisitorial
hate were confined year after year, till death released them from their
sufferings, and their bodies were suffered to remain until they were
entirely decayed, and the rooms had become fit for others to occupy.To prevent this being offensive to those who occupied the Inquisition,
there were flues or tubes extending to the open air, sufficiently
capacious to carry off the odor.In these cells we found the remains
of some who had paid the debt of nature: some of them had been dead
apparently but a short time, while of others nothing remained but their
bones, still chained to the floor of their dungeon.In others we found living sufferers of both sexes and of every age, from
three score years and ten down to fourteen or fifteen years--all naked
as they were born into the world!Here were old men
and aged women, who had been shut up for many years.Here, too, were the
middle aged, and the young man and the maiden of fourteen years old.The soldiers immediately went to work to release the captives from
their chains, and took from their knapsacks their overcoats and
other clothing, which they gave to cover their nakedness.They were
exceedingly anxious to bring them out to the light of day; but Col.L., aware of the danger, had food given them, and then brought them
gradually to the light, as they were able to bear it.L., to explore another room on the left.Here we found the instruments of torture, of every kind which the
ingenuity of men or devils could invent.L., here described four
of these horrid instruments.The first was a machine by which the victim
was confined, and then, beginning with the fingers, every joint in the
hands, arms and body, were broken or drawn one after another, until the
victim died.The second was a box, in which the head and neck of the
victim were so closely confined by a screw that he could not move in any
way.Over the box was a vessel, from which one drop of water a second,
fell upon the head of the victim;--every successive drop falling upon
precisely the same place on the head, suspended the circulation in a few
moments, and put the sufferer in the most excruciating agony.The third
was an infernal machine, laid horizontally, to which the victim was
bound; the machine then being placed between two beams, in which were
scores of knives so fixed that, by turning the machine with a crank, the
flesh of the sufferer was torn from his limbs, all in small pieces.The
fourth surpassed the others in fiendish ingenuity.Its exterior was
a beautiful woman, or large doll, richly dressed, with arms extended,
ready, to embrace its victim.Around her feet a semi-circle was drawn.The victim who passed over this fatal mark, touched a spring which
caused the diabolical engine to open; its arms clasped him, and a
thousand knives cut him into as many pieces in the deadly embrace.L., said that the sight of these engines of infernal cruelty kindled the
rage of the soldiers to fury.They declared that every inquisitor and
soldier of the inquisition should be put to the torture.They might have turned their
arms against him if he had attempted to arrest their work.The first they put to death in the machine for
breaking joints.The torture of the inquisitor put to death by the
dropping of water on his head was most excruciating.The poor man cried
out in agony to be taken from the fatal machine.The inquisitor general
was brought before the infernal engine called "The Virgin.""No" said they, "you have caused others to kiss her, and
now you must do it."They interlocked their bayonets so as to form large
forks, and with these pushed him over the deadly circle.The beautiful
image instantly prepared for the embrace, clasped him in its arms,
and he was cut into innumerable pieces.L. said, he witnessed the
torture of four of them--his heart sickened at the awful scene--and he
left the soldiers to wreak their vengeance on the last guilty inmate of
that prison-house of hell.In the mean time it was reported through Madrid that the prisons of the
Inquisition were broken open, and multitudes hastened to the fatal spot.And, Oh, what a meeting was there!About a
hundred who had been buried for many years were now restored to life.There were fathers who had found their long lost daughters; wives were
restored to their husbands, sisters to their brothers, parents to their
children; and there were some who could recognize no friend among the
multitude.The scene was such as no tongue can describe.L. caused the library, paintings,
furniture, etc., to be removed, and having sent to the city for a wagon
load of powder, he deposited a large quantity in the vaults beneath
the building, and placed a slow match in connection with it.All had
withdrawn to a distance, and in a few moments there was a most joyful
sight to thousands.The walls and turrets of the massive structure rose
majestically towards the heavens, impelled by the tremendous explosion,
and fell back to the earth an immense heap of ruins.Lehmanowsky of the destruction of the
inquisition in Spain.Was it then finally destroyed, never again to be
revived?Giacinto Achilli, D. D.
Surely, his statements in this respect can be relied upon, for he is
himself a convert from Romanism, and was formerly the "Head Professor of
Theology, and Vicar of the Master of the Sacred Apostolic Palace."He certainly had every opportunity to obtain correct information on the
subject, and in a book published by him in 1851, entitled "Dealings
with the Inquisition," we find, (page 71) the following startling
announcement."We are now in the middle of the nineteenth century, and
still the Inquisition is actually and potentially in existence.This
disgrace to humanity, whose entire history is a mass of atrocious
crimes, committed by the priests of the Church of Rome, in the name of
God and of His Christ, whose vicar and representative, the pope, the
head of the Inquisition, declares himself to be,--this abominable
institution is still in existence in Rome and in the Roman States."Again, (page 89) he says, "And this most infamous Inquisition, a hundred
times destroyed and as often renewed, still exists in Rome as in the
barbarous ages; the only difference being that the same iniquities are
at present practiced there with a little more secrecy and caution than
formerly, and this for the sake of prudence, that the Holy See may not
be subjected to the animadversions of the world at large."On page 82 of the same work we find the following language."I do not
propose to myself to speak of the Inquisition of times past, but of what
exists in Rome at the present moment; I shall therefore assert that the
laws of this institution being in no respect changed, neither can the
institution itself be said to have undergone any alteration.The present
race of priests who are now in power are too much afraid of the popular
indignation to let loose all their inquisitorial fury, which might even
occasion a revolt if they were not to restrain it; the whole world,
moreover, would cry out against them, a crusade would be raised against
the Inquisition, and, for a little temporary gratification, much power
would be endangered.This is the true reason why the severity of its
penalties is in some degree relaxed at the present time, but they still
remain unaltered in its code."Again on page 102, he says, "Are the torments which are employed at the
present day at the Inquisition all a fiction?It requires the impudence
of an inquisitor, or of the Archbishop of Westminister to deny their
existence.I have myself heard these evil-minded persons lament and
complain that their victims were treated with too much lenity.I inquired of the inquisitor of Spoleto.Thomas Aquinas says," answered he; "DEATH TO ALL THE
HERETICS.""Hand over, then, to one of these people, a person, however respectable;
give him up to one of the inquisitors, (he who quoted St.Thomas Aquinas
to me was made an Archbishop)--give up, I say, the present Archbishop of
Canterbury, an amiable and pious man, to one of these rabid inquisitors;
he must either deny his faith or be burned alive.Is not this the spirit that invariably actuates the
inquisitors?and not the inquisitors only, but all those who in any
way defile themselves with the inquisition, such as bishops and their
vicars, and all those who defend it, as the <DW7>s do.Wiseman, the Archbishop of Westminster according to the
pope's creation, the same who has had the assurance to censure me from
his pulpit, and to publish an infamous article in the Dublin Review, in
which he has raked together, as on a dunghill, every species of filth
from the sons of Ignatius Loyola; and there is no lie or calumny that he
has not made use of against me.Well, then, suppose I were to be handed
over to the tender mercy of Dr.Wiseman, and he had the full power to
dispose of me as he chose, without fear of losing his character in
the eyes of the nation to which, by parentage more than by merit, he
belongs, what do you imagine he would do with me?Should I not have to
undergo some death more terrible than ordinary?Would not a council be
held with the reverend fathers of the company of Loyola, the same who
have suggested the abominable calumnies above alluded to, in order
to invent some refined method of putting me out of the world?I feel
persuaded that if I were condemned by the Inquisition to be burned
alive, my calumniator would have great pleasure in building my funeral
pile, and setting fire to it with his own hands; or should strangulation
be preferred, that he would, with equal readiness, arrange the cord
around my neck; and all for the honor and glory of the Inquisition, of
which, according to his oath, he is a true and faithful servant."Achilli is the spirit of Romanism!Can we
doubt that it would lead to results as frightful as anything described
in the foregoing story?But let us listen to his further remarks on the present state of the
Inquisition.On page 75 he says, "What, then, is the Inquisition of the
nineteenth century?The same system of intolerance which prevailed in
the barbarous ages.That which raised the Crusade and roused all Europe
to arms at the voice of a monk [Footnote: Bernard of Chiaravalle.]and
of a hermit, [Footnote: Peter the Hermit.]That which--in the name of
a God of peace, manifested on earth by Christ, who, through love
for sinners, gave himself to be crucified--brought slaughter on the
Albigenses and the Waldenses; filled France with desolation, under
Domenico di Guzman; raised in Spain the funeral pile and the scaffold,
devastating the fair kingdoms of Granada and Castile, through the
assistance of those detestable monks, Raimond de Pennefort, Peter
Arbues, and Cardinal Forquemorda.That, which, to its eternal infamy,
registers in the annals of France the fatal 24th of August, and the 5th
of November in those of England."That same system which at this moment flourishes at Rome, which has
never yet been either worn out or modified, and which at this present
time, in the jargon of the priests, is called a "the holy, Roman,
universal, apostolic Inquisition.Holy, as the place where Christ was
crucified is holy; apostolic, because Judas Iscariot was the first
inquisitor; Roman and universal, because FROM ROME IT EXTENDS OVER ALL
THE WORLD.It is denied by some that the Inquisition which exists in
Rome as its centre, is extended throughout the world by means of the
missionaries.The Roman Inquisition and the Roman Propaganda are in
close connection with each other.Every bishop who is sent in partibus
infidelium, is an inquisitor charged to discover, through the means of
his missionaries, whatever is said or done by others in reference to
Rome, with the obligation to make his report secretly.The Apostolic
nuncios are all inquisitors, as are also the Apostolic vicars.Here,
then, we see the Roman Inquisition extending to the most remote
countries."Again this same writer informs us, (page 112,) that "the
principal object of the Inquisition is to possess themselves, by
every means in their power, of the secrets of every class of society.Consequently its agents (Jesuits and Missionaries,) enter the domestic
circle, observe every motion, listen to every conversation, and would,
if possible, become acquainted with the most hidden thoughts.It is in
fact, the police, not only of Rome, but of all Italy; INDEED, IT MAY BE
SAID OF THE WHOLE WORLD."Achilli are fully corroborated by the Rev.In a book published by him in 1852, entitled
"The Brand of Dominic," we find the following remarks in relation to the
Inquisition of the present time.The Roman Inquisition is, therefore,
acknowledged to have an infinite multitude of affairs constantly on
hand, which necessitates its assemblage thrice every week.Still there
are criminals, and criminal processes.The body of officials are still
maintained on established revenues of the holy office.So far from any
mitigation of severity or judicial improvement in the spirit of its
administration, the criminal has now no choice of an advocate; but one
person, and he a servant of the Inquisition, performs an idle ceremony,
under the name of advocacy, for the conviction of all.And let the
reader mark, that as there are bishops in partibus, so, in like manner,
there are inquisitors of the same class appointed in every country, and
chiefly, in Great Britain and the colonies, who are sworn to secrecy,
and of course communicate intelligence to this sacred congregation of
all that can be conceived capable of comprehension within the infinitude
of its affairs.We must, therefore, either believe that the court
of Rome is not in earnest, and that this apparatus of universal
jurisdiction is but a shadow,--an assumption which is contrary to all
experience,--or we must understand that the spies and familiars of the
Inquisition are listening at our doors, and intruding themselves on our
hearths.How they proceed, and what their brethren at Rome are doing,
events may tell; BUT WE MAY BE SURE THEY ARE NOT IDLE.They were not idle in Rome in 1825, when they rebuilt the prisons of
the Inquisition.They were not idle in 1842, when they imprisoned Dr.Achilli for heresy, as he assures us; nor was the captain, or some other
of the subalterns, who, acting in their name, took his watch from him
as he came out.They were not idle in 1843, when they renewed the old
edicts against the Jews.And all the world knows that the inquisitors on
their stations throughout the pontifical states, and the inquisitorial
agents in Italy, Germany, and Eastern Europe, were never more active
than during the last four years, and even at this moment, when every
political misdemeanor that is deemed offensive to the Pope, is,
constructively, a sin against the Inquisition, and visited with
punishment accordingly.A deliberative body, holding formal session
thrice every week, cannot be idle, and although it may please them to
deny that Dr.Achilli saw and examined a black book, containing the
praxis now in use, the criminal code of inquisitors in force at this
day,--as Archibald Bower had an abstract of such a book given him for
his use about one hundred and thirty years ago,--they cannot convince
me that I have not seen and handled, and used in the preparation of this
volume, the compendium of an unpublished Roman code of inquisitorial
regulations, given to the vicars of the inquisitor-general of Modena.They may be pleased to say that the mordacchia, or gag, of which Dr.Achilli speaks, as mentioned in that BLACK BOOK, is no longer used;
but that it is mentioned there, and might be used again is more than
credible to myself, after having seen that the "sacred congregation" has
fixed a rate of fees for the ordering, witnessing, and administration of
TORTURE.There was indeed, a talk of abolishing torture at Rome; but
we have reason to believe that the congregation will not drop the
mordacchia, inasmuch, as, instead of notifying any such reformation to
the courts of Europe, this congregation has kept silence.For although a
continuation of the bullary has just been published at Rome, containing
several decrees of this congregation, there is not one that announces
a fulfilment of this illusory promise,--a promise imagined by a
correspondent to French newspapers, but never given by the inquisitors
themselves.And as there is no proof that they have yet abstained from
torture, there is a large amount of circumstantial evidence that they
have delighted themselves in death.When public burnings
became inexpedient--as at Goa--did they not make provision for private
executions?For a third time at least the Roman prisons--I am not speaking of those
of the provinces--were broken open, in 1849, after the desertion of Pius
IX., and two prisoners were found there, an aged bishop and a nun.Many persons in Rome reported the event; but instead of copying what is
already before the public, I translate a letter addressed to me by P.
Alessandro Gavazzi, late chaplain-general of the Roman army, in reply
to a few questions which I had put to him.All who have heard his
statements may judge whether his account of facts be not marked with
every note of accuracy.They will believe that his power of oratory DOES
NOT betray him into random declamation.Under date of March 20th, 1852,
he writes thus:

"MY DEAR SIR,--In answering your questions concerning the palace of
Inquisition at Rome, I should say that I can give only a few superficial
and imperfect notes.So short was the time that it remained open to the
public, So great the crowd of persons that pressed to catch a sight of
it, and so intense the horror inspired by that accursed place, that I
could not obtain a more exact and particular impression."I found no instruments of torture, [Footnote: "The gag, the
thumb-screw, and many other instruments of severe torture could be
easily destroyed and others as easily procured.The non-appearance of
instruments is not enough to sustain the current belief that the use of
them is discontinued.So long as there is a secret prison, and while
all the existing standards of inquisitorial practice make torture
an ordinary expedient for extorting information, not even a bull,
prohibiting torture, would be sufficient to convince the world that
it has been discontinued.The practice of falsehood is enjoined on
inquisitors.How, then, could we believe a bull, or decree, if it were
put forth to-morrow, to release them from suspicion, or to screen them
from obloquy?It would not be entitled to belief."--Rev.for they were destroyed at the time of the first French invasion,
and because such instruments were not used afterwards by the modern
Inquisition.I did, however, find, in one of the prisons of the second
court, a furnace, and the remains of a woman's dress.I shall never be
able to believe that that furnace was placed there for the use of the
living, it not being in such a place, or of such a kind, as to be of
service to them.Everything, on the contrary, combines to persuade me
that it was made use of for horrible deaths, and to consume the remains
of the victims of inquisitorial executions.Another object of horror I
found between the great hall of judgment and the luxurious apartment of
the chief jailer (primo custode), the Dominican friar who presides over
this diabolical establishment.This was a deep trap or shaft opening
into the vaults under the Inquisition.As soon as the so-called criminal
had confessed his offence; the second keeper, who is always a Dominican
friar, sent him to the father commissary to receive a relaxation
[Footnote: "In Spain, RELAXATION is delivery to death.In the
established style of the Inquisition it has the same meaning.But in the
common language of Rome it means RELEASE.In the lips of the inquisitor,
therefore, if he used the word, it has one meaning, and another to the
ear of the prisoner."--Rev.With the
hope of pardon, the confessed culprit would go towards the apartment of
the holy inquisitor; but in the act of setting foot at its entrance,
the trap opened, and the world of the living heard no more of him.I
examined some of the earth found in the pit below this trap; it was a
compost of common earth, rottenness, ashes, and human hair, fetid to the
smell, and horrible to the sight and to the thought of the beholder."But where popular fury reached its highest pitch was in the vaults of
St.Pius V. I am anxious that you should note well that this pope was
canonized by the Roman church especially for his zeal against heretics.I will now describe to you the manner how, and the place where, those
vicars of Jesus Christ handled the living members of Jesus Christ, and
show you how they proceeded for their healing.You descend into the
vaults by very narrow stairs.A narrow corridor leads you to the
several cells, which, for smallness and stench, are a hundred times more
horrible than the dens of lions and tigers in the Colosseum.Wandering
in this labyrinth of most fearful prisons, that may be called 'graves
for the living,' I came to a cell full of skeletons without skulls,
buried in lime, and the skulls, detached from the bodies, had been
collected in a hamper by the first visitors.and why were they buried in that place and in that manner?I have heard
some popish priests trying to defend the Inquisition from the charge of
having condemned its victims to a secret death, say that the palace of
the Inquisition was built on a burial-ground, belonging anciently to a
hospital for pilgrims, and that the skeletons found were none other
than those of pilgrims who had died in that hospital.But everything
contradicts this papistical defence.Suppose that there had been a
cemetery there, it could not have had subterranean galleries and
cells, laid out with so great regularity; and even if there had been
such--against all probability--the remains of bodies would have been
removed on laying the foundation of the palace, to leave the space free
for the subterranean part of the Inquisition.Besides, it is contrary to
the use of common tombs to bury the dead by carrying them through a door
at the side; for the mouth of the sepulchre is always at the top.And
again, it has never been the custom in Italy to bury the dead singly in
quick lime; but, in time of plague, the dead bodies have been usually
laid in a grave until it was sufficiently full, and then quick lime has
been laid over them, to prevent pestilential exhalations, by hastening
the decomposition of the infected corpses.This custom was continued,
some years ago, in the cemeteries of Naples, and especially in the daily
burial of the poor.Therefore, the skeletons found in the Inquisition
of Rome could not belong to persons who had died a natural death in
a hospital; nor could any one, under such a supposition, explain the
mystery of all the bodies being buried in lime except the head.It
remains, then, beyond a doubt, that that subterranean vault contained
the victims of one of the many secret martyrdoms of the butcherly
tribunal.The following is the most probable opinion, if it be not
rather the history of a fact:

"The condemned were immersed in a bath of slaked lime, gradually filled
up to their necks.The lime by little and little enclosed the sufferers,
or walled them up alive.As the lime
rose higher and higher, the respiration became more and more painful,
because more difficult.So that what with the suffocation of the smoke,
and the anguish of the compressed breathing, they died in a manner most
horrible and desperate.Some time after their death the heads would
naturally separate from the bodies, and roll away into the hollows made
by the shrinking of the lime.Any other explanation of the feet that may
be attempted will be found improbable and unnatural.You may make what
use you please of these notes of mine, since I can warrant their
truth.I wish that writers, speaking of this infamous tribunal of the
Inquisition, would derive their information from pure history, unmingled
with romance; for so great and so many the historical atrocities of the
Inquisition, that they would more than suffice to arouse the detestation
of a thousand worlds.I know that the popish impostor-priests go about
saying that the Inquisition was never an ecclesiastical tribunal, but
a laic.But you will have shown the contrary in your work, and may also
add, in order quite to unmask these lying preachers, that the palace
of the Inquisition at Rome is under the shadow of the palace of the
Vatican; that the keepers are to this day, Dominican friars; and that
the prefect of the Inquisition at Rome is the Pope in person."I have the honor to be your affectionate Servant,

"ALESSANDRA GAVAZZI.""The Roman parliament decreed the erection of a pillar opposite the
palace of the Inquisition, to perpetuate the memory of the destruction
of that nest of abominations; but before that or any other monument
could be raised, the French army besieged and took the city, restored
the Pope, and with him the tribunal of the faith.Achilli thrown into one of its old prisons, on the 29th of July 1849,
but the violence of the people having made the building less adequate
to the purpose of safe keeping, he was transferred to the castle of
St.Angelo, which had often been employed for the custody of similar
delinquents, and there he lay in close confinement until the 9th of
January, 1850, when the French authorities, yielding to influential
representations from this country assisted him to escape in disguise as
a soldier, thus removing an occasion of scandal, but carefully leaving
the authority of the congregation of cardinals undisputed.Indeed
they first obtained the verbal sanction of the commissary, who saw it
expedient to let his victim go, and hush an outcry."Yet some have the hardihood to affirm that there is no longer any
Inquisition; and as the Inquisitors were instructed to suppress the
truth, to deny their knowledge of cases actually passing through their
hands, and to fabricate falsehoods for the sake of preserving the
SECRET, because the secret was absolutely necessary to the preservation
of their office, so do the Inquisitors in partibus falsify and illude
without the least scruple of conscience, in order to put the people of
this country off their guard."That the Inquisition really exists, is placed beyond a doubt by its
daily action as a visible institution at Rome.But if any one should
fancy that it was abolished after the release of Dr.Achilli, let him
hear a sentence contradictory, from a bull of the Pope himself, Pius IX,
a document that was dated at Rome, August 22, 1851, where the pontiff,
condemning the works of Professor Nuytz, of Turin, says, "after having
taken the advice of the doctors in theology and canon law, AFTER HAVING
COLLECTED THE SUFFRAGES OF OUR VENERABLE BROTHERS THE CARDINALS OF THE
CONGREGATION OF THE SUPREME AND UNIVERSAL INQUISITION."And so recently
as March, 1852, by letters of the Secretariate of State, he appointed
four cardinals to be "members of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy
Roman and Universal Inquisition;" giving incontrovertible evidence that
provision is made for attending to communications of Inquisitors in
partibus from all parts of the world.As the old cardinals die off,
their vacant seats are filled by others.The 'immortal legion' is
punctually recruited."After all, have we in Great Britain, Ireland and the colonies, and our
brethren of the foreign mission stations, any reason to apprehend harm
to, ourselves from the Inquisition as it is?In reply to this question,
let it be observed;

"1.That there are Inquisitors in partibus is not to be denied.That
letters of these Inquisitors are laid before the Roman Inquisition is
equally certain.Even in the time of Leo XII, when the church of
Rome was far less active in the British empire than it is now, some
particular case was always decided on Thursday, when the Pope, in his
character of universal Inquisitor, presided in the congregation.It
cannot be thought that now, in the height of its exultation, daring and
aggression, this congregation has fewer emissaries, or that they are
less active, or less communicative than they were at that time.We
also see that the number is constantly replenished.The cardinals Della
Genga-Sermattei; De Azevedo; Fornari; and Lucciardi have just been added
to it.Besides a cardinal in England, and a delegate in Ireland, there is
both in England and Ireland, a body of bishops, 'natural Inquisitors,'
as they are always acknowledged, and have often claimed to be; and these
natural Inquisitors are all sworn to keep the secret--the soul of the
Inquisition.Since, then, there are Inquisitors in partibus, appointed
to supply the lack of an avowed and stationary Inquisition, and since
the bishops are the very persons whom the court of Rome can best
command, as pledged for such a service, it is reasonable to suppose they
act in that capacity.Some of the proceedings of these bishops confirm the assurance that
there is now an Inquisition in activity in England.* * * The vigilance
exercised over families, also the intermeddling of priests with
education, both in families and schools, and with the innumerable
relations of civil society, can only be traced back to the Inquisitors
in partibus, whose peculiar duty, whether by help of confessors or
familiars, is to worm out every secret of affairs, private or public,
and to organize and conduct measures of repression or of punishment.Where the secular arm cannot be borrowed, and where offenders lie beyond
the reach of excommunication, irregular methods must be resorted to,
not rejecting any as too crafty or too violent.Discontented mobs, or
individual zealots are to be found or bought.What part the Inquisitors
in partibus play in Irish assassinations, or in the general mass of
murderous assaults that is perpetrated in the lower haunts of crime,
it is impossible to say.Under cover of confessional and Inquisitorial
secrets, spreads a broad field of action--a region of mystery--only
visible to the eye of God, and to those'most reverend and most eminent'
guardians of the papacy, who sit thrice every week, in the Minerva
and Vatican, and there manage the hidden springs of Inquisition on the
heretics, schismatics, and rebels, no less than on 'the faithful'
of realms.Who can calculate the extent of their power over those
'religious houses,' where so many of the inmates are but neophytes,
unfitted by British education for the intellectual and moral abnegation,
the surrender of mind and conscience, which monastic discipline
exacts?Yet they must be coerced into submission, and kept under penal
discipline.Who can tell how many of their own clergy are withdrawn
to Rome, and there delated, imprisoned, and left to perish, if not
'relaxed' to death, in punishment of heretical opinions or liberal
practices?We have heard of laymen, too, taken to Rome by force, or
decoyed thither under false pretences there to be punished by the
universal Inquisition; and whatever of incredibility may appear in some
tales of Inquisitorial abduction, the general fact that such abductions
have taken place, seems to be incontrovertible.And now that the
Inquisitors in partibus are distributed over Christendom, and that they
provide the Roman Inquisition with daily work from year's end to year's
end, is among the things most certain,--even the most careless of
Englishmen must acknowledge that we have all reason to apprehend much
evil from the Inquisition as it is.And no Christian can be aware of
this fact, without feeling himself more than ever bound to uphold
the cause of christianity, both at home and abroad, as the only
counteractive of so dire a curse, and the only remedy of so vast an
evil."E. A. Lawrence, writing of "Romanism at Rome," gives us the
following vivid description of the present state of the Roman Church."Next is seen at Rome the PROPAGANDA, the great missionary heart of the
whole masterly system.Noiselessly, by the multiform orders of monks and
nuns, as through so many veins and arteries, it sends out and receives
back its vital fluid.In its halls, the whole world is distinctly
mapped out, and the chief points of influence minutely marked.A kind of
telegraphic communication is established with the remotest stations in
South Africa and Siberia, and with almost every nook in our own land,
to which the myrmidons of Papal power look with the most of fear.It
is through means of this moral galvanic battery, set up in the Vatican,
that the Church of Rome has gained its power of UBIQUITY--has so well
nigh made itself OMNIPOTENT, as well as omnipresent."It is no mean or puny antagonist that strides across the path of a
free, spiritual and advancing Protestantism.And yet, with a simple
shepherd's sling, and the smooth stones gathered from Siloa's brook, God
will give it the victory."Once more let us look, and we shall find at Rome, still working in its
dark, malignant efficiency, the INQUISITION.Men are still made to pass
through fires of this Moloch.This is the grand defensive expedient of
the Papacy, and is the chief tribunal of the States.Its processes are
all as secret as the grave.Its cells are full of dead men's bones.They
call it the Asylum for the poor--a retreat for doubting and distressed
pilgrims, where they may have experience of the parental kindness of
their father the Pope, and their mother the church.Achilli had a trial of this beneficient discipline, when thrown
into the deep dungeon of St.And how many other poor victims of
this diabolical institution are at this moment pining in agony, heaven
knows."In America, we talk about Rome as having ceased to persecute.She holds to the principle as tenaciously as ever.Of the evil spirit of Protestantism she says, "This
kind goeth not out, but by fire."Hence she must hold both the principle and the power of persecution, of
compelling men to believe, or, if they doubt, of putting them to death
for their own good.Take from her this power and she bites the dust."It may perchance be said that the remarks of the Rev.William Rule,
quoted above, refer exclusively to the existing state of things is
England, Ireland, and the colonies.But who will dare to say, after a
careful investigation of the subject, that they do not apply with equal
force to these United States?Has America nothing to fear from the inquisitors--from the Jesuits?Is
it true that the "Inquisition still exists in Rome--that its code is
unchanged--that its emissaries are sent over all the world--that every
nuncio and bishop is an Inquisitor," and is it improbable that, even
now, torture rooms like those described in the foregoing story, may be
found in Roman Catholic establishments in this country?Yes, even here,
in Protestant, enlightened America!Have WE then nothing to fear from
Romanism?But a few days since a gentleman of learning and intelligence
when speaking of this subject, exclaimed, "What have we to do with the
Jesuits?The idea that we have aught
to fear from Romanism, is simply ridiculous!"In reply to this, allow
me to quote the language of the Rev.Manuel J. Gonsalves, leader of the
Madeira Exiles."The time will come when the American people will arise as one man, and
not only abolish the confessional, but will follow the example of many
of the European nations, who had no peace, or rest, till they banished
the Jesuits.These are the men, who bask in the sunbeams of popery, to
whom the pope has entrusted the vast interests of the king of Rome, in
this great Republic.Nine tenths of the Romish priests, now working hard
for their Master the pope, in this country, are full blooded Jesuits.The man of sin who is the head of the mystery of iniquity--through
the advice of the popish bishops now in this country, has selected
the Jesuitical order of priests, to carry on his great and gigantic
operations in the United States of America.Those Jesuits who
distinguish themselves the most in the destruction of Protestant Bible
religion, and who gain the largest number of protestant scholars for
popish schools and seminaries; who win most American converts to their
sect are offered great rewards in the shape of high offices in the
church.John Hughes, the Jesuit Bishop of the New York Romanists, was
rewarded by Pope Pius 9th, with an Archbishop's mitre, for his great,
zeal and success, in removing God's Holy Bible from thirty-eight public
schools in New York, and for procuring a papal school committee, to
examine every book in the hands of American children in the public
schools, that every passage of truth, in those books of history
unpalatable to the pope might be blotted out."Has America then nothing
to do with Romanism?But another gentleman exclaims, "What if Romanism be on the increase in
the United States!Is not their religion as dear to them, as ours is
to us?"M. J. Gonsalves would reply as follows."The
American people have been deceived, in believing THAT POPERY WAS A
RELIGION, not a very good one to be sure, but some kind of one.We might as well call the Archbishop of the
fallen angels, and his crew, a religious body of intelligent beings,
because they believe in an Almighty God, and tremble, as to call the man
of sin and his Jesuits, a body of religious saints.The tree is known
by its fruit, such as 'love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness,
goodness, meekness, faith, temperance, brotherly kindness;' and where
the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, Christian liberty, giving
to God and man their due unasked.Now we ask, what kind of fruit does
the tree of Popery bear, in any country, that it should claim homage,
and respect, as a good religion?"Such is the language of one who knew so well what popery was, that he
fled from it as from a hell upon earth.In his further remarks upon the horrors of convent life in the United
States, he fully confirms the statements in the foregoing narrative.He
says, "It is time that American gentlemen, who are so much occupied
in business, should think of the dangers of the confessional, and the
miseries endured by innocent, duped, American, imprisoned females in
this free country; and remember that these American ladies who have been
duped and enticed by Jesuitical intrigue and craft, into their female
convents, have no means of deliverance; they cannot write a letter to a
friend without the consent and inspection of the Mother Abbess, who
is always and invariably a female tyrant, a creature in the pay of the
Bishop, and dependent upon the Bishop for her despotic office of power.The poor, unfortunate, imprisoned American female has no means of
redress in her power.She cannot communicate her story of wrong and
suffering to any living being beyond the walls of her prison.She may
have a father, a mother, a dear brother, or a sister, who, if they knew
one-sixteenth part of her wrongs and sufferings, would fly at once to
see her and sympathize with her in her anguish.But the Jesuit confessor
attached to the prison is ever on the alert.Those ladies who appear the
most unhappy, and unreconciled to their prison, are compelled to attend
the confessional every day; and thus the artful Jesuit, by a thousand
cross questions, is made to understand perfectly the state of their
minds.The Lady Porter, or door-keeper and jailor, is always a creature
of the priest's, and a great favorite with the Mother Abbess.Should any
friends call to see an unhappy nun who is utterly unreconciled to her
fate, the Lady Porter is instructed to inform those relatives that the
dear nun they want to see so much, is so perfectly happy, and given up
to heavenly meditations, that she cannot be persuaded to see an earthly
relative.At the same time the Mother Abbess dismisses the relatives
with a very sorrowful countenance, and regrets very much, in appearance,
their disappointment.But the unhappy nun is never informed that her
friends or relatives have called to inquire after her welfare.How
amazing, that government should allow such prisons in the name of
religion!"CONVENT OF THE CAPUCHINS IN SANTIAGO

In a late number of "The American and Foreign Christian Union," we find
the following account of conventual life from a report of a Missionary
in Chile, South America."Now, my brother, let me give you an account related to me by a most
worthy English family, most of the members of which have grown up in the
country, confirmed also by common report, of the Convent of Capuchins,
in Santiago."The number of inmates is limited to thirty-two young ladies.The
admittance fee is $2000.When the nun enters she is dressed like a
bride, in the most costly material that wealth can command.There,
beside the altar of consecration, she devotes herself in the most
solemn, manner to a life of celibacy and mortification of the flesh
and spirit, with the deluded hope that her works will merit a brighter
mansion in the realms above."The forms of consecration being completed, she begins to cast off
her rich veil, costly vestments, all her splendid diamonds and
brilliants--which, in many instances, have cost, perhaps, from ten to
fifteen, or even twenty thousand dollars.Then her beautiful locks are
submitted to the tonsure; and to signify her deadness forever to the
world, she is clothed in a dress of coarse grey cloth, called serge, in
which she is to pass the miserable remnant of her days.The dark sombre
walls of her prison she can sever pass, and its iron-bound doors are
shut forever upon their new, youthful, and sensitive occupant.Rarely,
if ever, is she permitted to speak, and NEVER, NEVER, to see her friends
or The loved ones of home--to enjoy the embraces of a fond mother, or
devoted father, or the smiles of fraternal or sisterly affection.If
ever allowed to speak at all, it is through iron bars where she cannot
be seen, and in the presence of the abbess, to see that no complaint
escapes her lips.However much her bosom may swell with anxiety at the
sound of voices which were once music to her soul, and she may long to
pour out her cries and tears to those who once soothed every sorrow of
her heart; yet not a murmur must be uttered.The soul must suffer
its own sorrows solitary and alone, with none to sympathize, or grant
relief, and none to listen to its moans but the cold gloomy walls of her
tomb.No, no, not even the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that great alleviator
of all the sorrows of the heart, is allowed an entrance there.Besides being condemned to a meagre, insufficient
and unwholesome diet which they themselves must cook, the nuns are
not allowed to speak much with each other, except to say, 'Que morir
tenemos, 'we are to die,' or 'we must die,' and to reply, 'Ya los
sabemos,' 'we know it,' or 'already we know it'

"They pass most of their time in small lonely cells, where they sleep in
a narrow place dug out in the ground, in the shape of a coffin, without
bed of any kind, except a piece of coarse serge spread down; and their
daily dress is their only covering.'Tired
nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep, no more with his downy pinions
lights on his unsullied with a tear:' FOR EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY-FOUR
they are aroused by the bell to perform their 'Ave Maria's,' count their
rosaries, and such other blind devotions as may be imposed.Thus they
drag out a miserable existence, and when death calls the spirit to its
last account, the other nuns dig the grave with their own hands, within
the walls of the convent, and so perform the obsequies of their departed
sister."Thus, I have briefly given you not fiction!but a faithful narrative
of facts in regard to conventual life, and an establishment marked by
almost every form of sin, and yet making pretence of 'perfecting the
saints,' by the free and gentle influences of the gospel of Christ.What is done with the rich vestments and jewels?Where do the priests get all their brilliants to perform high mass
and adorn their processions?Where does all the hair of the saints come from, which is sold in
lockets for high prices as sure preventives of evil?Whose grave has been plundered to obtain RELICS to sell to the
ignorant.Where does the Romish Church obtain her SURPLUS RIGHTEOUSNESS TO
SELL TO THE needy, and not give it like our blessed Lord, 'without money
and without price?'Who is responsible for the FANATICISM that induces a young female
to incarcerate herself?Where is the authority in reason, in revelation, for such a life?"A young lady lately cast herself from the tower, and was dashed in
pieces, being led to do it, doubtless, in desperation.The convents of
this city, of the same order, require the same entrance fee, $2000.Of
course, none but the comparatively rich can avail themselves of this
perfection of godliness."Who will say that this mode of life has not been invented in order to
cut short life as rapidly as possible, that the $2000, with all the rich
diamonds upon initiation, may be repeated as frequently as possible?how true it is, that Romanism is the same merciless, cruel,
diabolical organisation, wherever it can fully develop itself, in
all lands.How truly is it denominated by the pen of inspiration the
'MYSTERY OF INIQUITY,' especially that part of it relating to these
secret institutions, and the whole order of the Jesuits."The editor of the "Christian Union", in his remarks on the above, says,
"Already the fair face of our country is disfigured by the existence
here and there of conventual establishments.At present they do not
show the hideous features which they, at least in some cases, assume in
countries where papal influence and authority are supreme.The genius of
our government and institutions necessarily exerts a restraining power,
which holds them from excesses to which, otherwise, they might run.But
they constitute a part of a system which is strongly at variance with
the interests of humanity, and merely wait the occurrence of favorable
circumstances to visit upon our land all the horrors which they have
inflicted elsewhere."How many conventual establishments there are now in the nation, few
Protestants, it is believed, know.And how many young females, guilty of
no crime against society, and condemned by no law of the land, are shut
up in their walls and doomed to a life which they did not anticipate
when entering them, a life which is more dreadful to them than death,
very few of the millions of our citizens conceive.The majority of our
people have slept over the whole subject, and the indifference thus
manifested has emboldened the priests to posh forward the extension
of the system, and the workmen are now busy in various places in
the construction of additional establishments.But such facts as are
revealed in this article, from the pen of our missionary, in connection
with things that are occurring around us, show that no time should be
lost in examining this whole subject of convents and monasteries, and in
legislating rightly about them."Again, when speaking of papal convents in the United States, the same
talented writer observes, "The time has fully come when Protestants
should lay aside their apathy and too long-cherished indifference in
respect to the movements of Rome in this land.It is time for them to
call to mind the testimony of their fathers, their bitter experiences
from the papal See, and to take effective measures to protect the
inheritance bequeathed to them, that they may hand it down to their
children free from corruption, as pure and as valuable as when they
received it.They should remember that Rome claims never to change, that
what she was in Europe when in the zenith of her power, she will be here
when fairly installed, and has ability to enforce her commands."Her numbers now on our soil, her nearly two thousand priests moving
about everywhere, her colleges and printing-presses, her schools and
convents, and enormous amounts of property held by her bishops, have
served as an occasion to draw out something of her spirit, and to show
that she is ARROGANT AND ABUSIVE TO THE EXTENT OF HER POWER."Scarcely a newspaper issues from her press, but is loaded with abuse of
Protestants and of their religion, and at every available point assaults
are made upon their institutions and laws; and Rome and her institutions
and interests are crowded into notice, and special privileges are loudly
clamored for."All Protestants, therefore, of every name, and of every religious and
political creed, we repeat it, who do not desire to ignore the past, and
to renounce all care or concern for the future, as to their children and
children's children, should lose no time in informing themselves of
the state of things around them in regard to the papacy and its
institutions.They should without delay devote their efforts and
influence to the protection of the country against those Popish
establishments and their usages which have been set up among us without
the authority of law, and under whose crushing weight some of the
nations of Europe have staggered and reeled for centuries, and have now
but little of their former power and glory remaining, and under which
Mexico, just upon our borders, has sunk manifestly beyond the power of
recovery."Let each individual seek to awaken an interest in this matter in
the mind of his neighbor.And if there be papal establishments in
the neighborhood under the names of'schools,''retreats','religions
communities,' or any other designation, which are at variance with, or
are not conformed to, the laws of the commonwealth in which they are
situated, let memorials be prepared and signed by the citizens, and
forwarded immediately to the legislature, praying that they may be
subjected to examination, and required to conform to the laws by which
all Protestant institutions of a public nature are governed."Let us exclude from our national territory all irresponsible
institutions.Let us seek to maintain a government of law, and insist
upon the equality of all classes before it."In closing these extracts, we beg leave to express ourselves in the
words of the Rev.Sunderland, of Washington city, in a sermon
delivered before the American and Foreign Christian Union, at its
anniversary in May, 1856."But new it is asked, 'Why all this tirade against Roman Catholics?'It is not against the unhappy millions that are
ground down under the iron heel of that enormous despotism.They are of
the common humanity, our brethren and kinsmen, according to the flesh.They need the same light instruction and salvation that we need.Like
ourselves they need the one God, the one mediator between God and man,
the man Christ Jesus; and from the heart we love and pity them.We would
grant them all the privileges which we claim to ourselves.We can have
no animosity towards them as men and candidates with ourselves for the
coming judgment.But it is the system under which they are born, and
live, and die, I repeat, which we denounce, and when we shall cease to
oppose it, then let our right hand forget her cunning, and our tongue
cleave to the roof of our mouth.What is it but a dark and terrible
power on earth before which so many horrible memories start up?Why,
sir, look at it!We drag the bones of the grim behemoth out to view, for
we would not have the world forget his ugliness nor the terror he has
inspired.'A tirade against Romanism,' is it?O sir, we remember
the persecutions of Justinian; we remember the days of the Spanish
Inquisition; we remember the reign of 'the Bloody Mary;' we remember
the revocation of the Edict of Nantes; we remember St.Bartholomew;
we remember the murdered Covenanters, Huguenots, and Piedmontese; we
remember the noble martyrs dying for the testimony of the faith along
the ancient Rhine; we remember the later wrath which pursued the
islanders of Madeira, till some of them sought refuge upon these
shores; we remember the Madiai, and we know how the beast ever seeks to
propagate his power, by force where he can, by deception where he must.And when we remember these things, we must protest against the further
vigor and prosperity of this grand Babylon of all.Take it, then, tirade
and all, for so ye must, ye ministers of Rome, sodden with the fumes of
that great deep of abominations!The voice of the Protestant shall never
be hushed; the spirit of Reformation shall never sleep.O, lands of
Farel and of Calvin, of Zwingle and of Luther!O countries where the
trumpet first sounded, marshalling the people to this fearful contest!We have heard the blast rolling still louder down the path of three
hundred years, and in our solid muster-march we come, the children
of the tenth generation.We come a growing phalanx, not with carnal
weapons, but with the armor of the gospel, and wielding the sword of
truth on the right hand and on the left, we say that ANTICHRIST MUST
FALL.Hear it, ye witnesses, and mark the word; by the majesty of the
coming kingdom of Jesus, and by the eternal purpose of Jehovah, THIS
ANTICHRIST MUST FALL."Such an one of yours
I with Romagna's darkest spirit found,
As for his doings even now in soul
Is in Cocytus plung'd, and yet doth seem
In body still alive upon the earth.CANTO XXXIV

"THE banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth
Towards us; therefore look," so spake my guide,
"If thou discern him."As, when breathes a cloud
Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night
Fall on our hemisphere, seems view'd from far
A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,
Such was the fabric then methought I saw,

To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew
Behind my guide: no covert else was there.Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain
Record the marvel) where the souls were all
Whelm'd underneath, transparent, as through glass
Pellucid the frail stem.Some prone were laid,
Others stood upright, this upon the soles,
That on his head, a third with face to feet
Arch'd like a bow.When to the point we came,
Whereat my guide was pleas'd that I should see
The creature eminent in beauty once,
He from before me stepp'd and made me pause.and lo the place,
Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."How frozen and how faint I then became,
Ask me not, reader!for I write it not,
Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.Think thyself
If quick conception work in thee at all,
How I did feel.That emperor, who sways
The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice
Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
A giant, than the giants are in his arms.Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits
With such a part.If he were beautiful
As he is hideous now, and yet did dare
To scowl upon his Maker, well from him
May all our mis'ry flow.How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy
Upon his head three faces: one in front
Of hue vermilion, th' other two with this
Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;
The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left
To look on, such as come from whence old Nile
Stoops to the lowlands.Under each shot forth
Two mighty wings, enormous as became
A bird so vast.Sails never such I saw
Outstretch'd on the wide sea.No plumes had they,
But were in texture like a bat, and these
He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still
Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth
Was frozen.At six eyes he wept: the tears
Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd
Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that three
Were in this guise tormented.But far more
Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd
By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back
Was stript of all its skin."That upper spirit,
Who hath worse punishment," so spake my guide,
"Is Judas, he that hath his head within
And plies the feet without.Of th' other two,
Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw
Who hangs, is Brutus: lo!how he doth writhe
And speaks not!Th' other Cassius, that appears
So large of limb.But night now re-ascends,
And it is time for parting.I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;
And noting time and place, he, when the wings
Enough were op'd, caught fast the shaggy sides,
And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd
Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh
Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,
My leader there with pain and struggling hard
Turn'd round his head, where his feet stood before,
And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,
That into hell methought we turn'd again."Expect that by such stairs as these," thus spake
The teacher, panting like a man forespent,
"We must depart from evil so extreme."Then at a rocky opening issued forth,
And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next join'd
With wary step my side.I rais'd mine eyes,
Believing that I Lucifer should see
Where he was lately left, but saw him now
With legs held upward.Let the grosser sort,
Who see not what the point was I had pass'd,
Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then."Arise," my master cried, "upon thy feet.The way is long, and much uncouth the road;
And now within one hour and half of noon
The sun returns."It was no palace-hall
Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,
But natural dungeon where ill footing was
And scant supply of light."Ere from th' abyss
I sep'rate," thus when risen I began,
"My guide!vouchsafe few words to set me free
From error's thralldom.How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?And how from eve to morn in space so brief
Hath the sun made his transit?"He in few
Thus answering spake: "Thou deemest thou art still
On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd
Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I
Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass
That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd
All heavy substance.Thou art now arriv'd
Under the hemisphere opposed to that,
Which the great continent doth overspread,
And underneath whose canopy expir'd
The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd.Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,
Whose other aspect is Judecca.Morn
Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,
Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,
As at the first.On this part he fell down
From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,
And to our hemisphere retir'd.Perchance
To shun him was the vacant space left here
By what of firm land on this side appears,
That sprang aloof."There is a place beneath,
From Belzebub as distant, as extends
The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,
But by the sound of brooklet, that descends
This way along the hollow of a rock,
Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,
The wave hath eaten.By that hidden way
My guide and I did enter, to return
To the fair world: and heedless of repose
We climbed, he first, I following his steps,
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.It is the ordained Channel
whereby God's pardon is conveyed to (and only to) the penitent sinner."No penitence, no pardon," is the law of Sacramental Absolution.The Prayer Book, therefore, preaches the power of formal, as well as
informal, Absolution.There are in it three forms of Absolution,
varying in words but the same in power.The appropriating power of the
penitent may, and does, vary, according to the sincerity of his
confession: Absolution is in each case the same.It is man's capacity
to receive it, not God's power in giving it, that varies.Thus, all
three Absolutions in the {152} Prayer Book are of the same force,
though our appropriating capacity in receiving them may differ.This
capacity will probably be less marked at Matins and Evensong than at
Holy Communion, and at Holy Communion than in private Confession,
because it will be less personal, less thorough.The words of
Absolution seem to suggest this.The first two forms are in the plural
("pardon and deliver _you_"), and are thrown, as it were, broadcast
over the Church: the third is special ("forgive _thee_ thine offences")
and is administered to the individual.But the formal act is the same
in each case; and to stroll late into church, as if the Absolution in
Matins and Evensong does not matter, may be to incur a very distinct
loss.When, and how often, formal "special Confession" is to be used, and
formal Absolution to be sought, is left to each soul to decide.The
two special occasions which the Church of England emphasizes (without
limiting) are before receiving the Holy Communion, and when sick.Before Communion, the Prayer Book counsels its use for any disquieted
conscience; and the {153} Rubric which directs intending Communicants
to send in their names to the Parish Priest the day before making their
Communion, still bears witness to its framers' intention--that known
sinners might not be communicated without first being brought to a
state of repentance.The sick, also, after being directed to make their wills,[3] and
arrange their temporal affairs, are further urged to examine their
spiritual state; to make a special confession; and to obtain the
special grace, in the special way provided for them.And, adds the
Rubric, "men should often be put in remembrance to take order for the
settling of their temporal estates, while they are in health"--and if
of the temporal, how much more of their spiritual estate._Direction._

But, say some, is not all this very weakening to the soul?They are,
probably, mixing up two things,--the Divine Sacrament of forgiveness
which (rightly used) must be strengthening, and the human appeal for
direction which (wrongly used) may be weakening.{154}

But "direction" is not necessarily part of Penance.The Prayer Book
lays great stress upon it, and calls it "ghostly counsel and advice,"
but it is neither Confession nor Absolution.It has its own place in
the Prayer Book;[4] but it has not, necessarily, anything whatever to
do with the administration of the Sacrament.Direction may, or may
not, be good for the soul.It largely depends upon the character of
the penitent, and the wisdom of the Director.It is quite possible for
the priest to over-direct, and it is fatally possible for the penitent
to think more of direction than of Absolution.It is quite possible to
obscure the Sacramental side of Penance with a human craving for
"ghostly counsel and advice".Satan would not be Satan if it were not
so.But this "ghostly," or spiritual, "counsel and advice" has saved
many a lad, and many a man, from many a fall; and when rightly sought,
and wisely given is, as the Prayer Book teaches, a most helpful adjunct
to Absolution.Only, it is not, necessarily, a part of "going to
Confession".{155}

_Indulgences._

The abuse of the Sacrament is another, and not unnatural objection to
its use; and it often gets mixed up with Mediaeval teaching about
Indulgences.An _Indulgence_ is exactly what the word suggests--the act of
indulging, or granting a favour.In Roman theology, an Indulgence is
the remission of temporal punishment due to sin after Absolution.It
is either "plenary," i.e.when the whole punishment is remitted, or
"partial," when some of it is remitted.At corrupt periods of Church
history, these Indulgences have been bought for money,[5] thus making
one law for the rich, and another for the poor.Very naturally, the
scandals connected with such buying and selling raised suspicions
against the Sacrament with which Indulgences were associated.[6]  But
Indulgences have nothing in the world to do with the right use of the
lesser Sacrament of Penance.{156}

_Amendment._

The promise of Amendment is an essential part of Penance.It is a
necessary element in all true contrition.Thus, the penitent promises
"true amendment" before he receives Absolution.If he allowed a priest
to give him Absolution without firmly purposing to amend, he would not
only invalidate the Absolution, but would commit an additional sin.The promise to amend may, like any other promise, be made and broken;
but the deliberate purpose must be there.No better description of true repentance can be found than in
Tennyson's "Guinevere":--

  _For what is true repentance but in thought--_
  _Not ev'n in inmost thought to think again_
  _The sins that made the past so pleasant to us._


Such has been the teaching of the Catholic Church always, everywhere,
and at all times: such is the teaching of the Church of England, as
part of that Church, and as authoritatively laid down in the Book of
Common Prayer.Absolution is the conveyance of God's
pardon to the penitent sinner by God's ordained Minister, through the
ordained Ministry of Reconciliation.{157}

  Lamb of God, the world's transgression
    Thou alone canst take away;
  Hear!hear our heart's confession,
    And Thy pardoning grace convey.Thine availing intercession
    We but echo when we pray.[2] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[3] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[4] See the First Exhortation in the Order of the Administration of the
Holy Communion.Peter's at Rome was largely built out of funds gained by the
sale of indulgences.[6] The Council of Trent orders that Indulgences must be granted by
Pope and Prelate _gratis_.The second Sacrament of Recovery is _Unction_, or, in more familiar
language, "the Anointing of the Sick".It is called by Origen "the
complement of Penance".The meaning of the Sacrament is found in St.let him call for the elders of the Church; and let them
pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the
prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up;
and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."Here the Bible states that the "Prayer of Faith" with Unction is more
effective than the "Prayer of Faith" without Unction.It can (1) recover the body, and (2) restore the
soul.Its primary {159} object seems to be to recover the body; but it
also, according to the teaching of St.First, he says, Anointing with the Prayer of Faith heals the body; and
then, because of the inseparable union between body and soul, it
cleanses the soul.Thus, as the object of Penance is primarily to heal the soul, and
indirectly to heal the body; so the object of Unction is primarily to
heal the body, and indirectly to heal the soul.The story of Unction may be summarized very shortly.It was instituted
in Apostolic days, when the Apostles "anointed with oil many that were
sick and healed them" (St.It was continued in the Early
Church, and perpetuated during the Middle Ages, when its use (by a
"_corrupt_[1] following of the Apostles") was practically limited to
the preparation of the dying instead of (by a _correct_ "following of
the Apostles") being used for the recovery of the living.In our 1549
Prayer Book an authorized Office was appointed for its use, but this,
lest it should be misused, was omitted in 1552.And although, as
Bishop Forbes says, "everything of that earlier Liturgy was praised by
those who {160} removed it," it has not yet been restored.It is "one
of the lost Pleiads" of our present Prayer Book.But, as Bishop Forbes
adds, "there is nothing to hinder the revival of the Apostolic and
Scriptural Custom of Anointing the Sick whenever any devout person
desires it".[2]



_Extreme Unction._

An unhistoric use of the name partly explains the unhistoric use of the
Sacrament._Extreme_, or last (_extrema_) Unction has been taken to
mean the anointing of the sick when _in extremis_.This, as we have
seen, is a "corrupt," and not a correct, "following of the Apostles".The phrase _Extreme_ Unction means the extreme, or last, of a series of
ritual Unctions, or anointings, once used in the Church.The first
Unction was in Holy Baptism, when the Baptized were anointed with Holy
Oil: then came the anointing in Confirmation: then in Ordination; and,
last of all, the anointing of the sick.Of this last anointing, it is
written: "All Christian men should account, and repute the said manner
of anointing among the other Sacraments, forasmuch as it is a visible
sign of an invisible grace".[3]

{161}

_Its Administration._

It must be administered under the Scriptural conditions laid down in
St.The first condition refers to:--

(1) _The Minister_.--The Minister is _the Church_, in her corporate
capacity.Scripture says to the sick: "Let him call for the Elders,"
or Presbyters, "of the Church".The word is in the plural; it is to be
the united act of the whole Church.And, further, there must be
nothing secret about it, as if it were either a charm, or something to
be ashamed of, or apologized for.It may have to be done in a private
house, but it is to be done by no private person.[4]  "Let him call for
the elders."(2) _The Manner_.--The Elders are to administer Sacrament not in their
own name (any more than the Priest gives Absolution in his own name),
but "in the Name of the Lord".(3) _The Method_.--The sick man is to be anointed (either on the
afflicted part, or in other ways), _with prayer_: "Let them pray over
him".{162}

(4) _The Matter_.--Oil--"anointing him with oil".As in Baptism,
sanctified water is the ordained matter by which "Jesus Christ
cleanseth us from all sin"; so in Unction, consecrated oil is the
ordained matter used by the Holy Ghost to cleanse us from all
sickness--bodily, and (adds St."And if he have
committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."For this latter purpose, there are two Scriptural requirements:
_Confession_ and _Intercession_.For it follows: "Confess your faults
one to another, and pray for one another that ye may be healed".Thus
it is with Unction as with other Sacraments; with the "last" as with
the first--special grace is attached to special means.The Bible says
that, under certain conditions, oil and prayer together will effect
more than either oil or prayer apart; that oil without prayer cannot,
and prayer without oil will not, win the special grace of healing
guaranteed to the use of oil and prayer together.In our days, the use of anointing with prayer is (in alliance with, and
in addition to, Medical Science) being more fully recognized."The
Prayer of Faith" is coming into its own, and is being placed once more
in proper position in the {163} sphere of healing; _anointing_ is being
more and more used "according to the Scriptures".Both are being used
together in a simple belief in revealed truth.It often happens that
"the elders of the Church" are sent for by the sick; a simple service
is used; the sick man is anointed; the united "Prayer of Faith" (it
_must_ be "of Faith") is offered; and, if it be good for his spiritual
health, the sick man is "made whole of whatsoever disease he had".God give us in this, as in every other Sacrament, a braver, quieter,
more loving faith in His promises.The need still exists: the grace is
still to be had._If our love were but more simple,_
    _We should take Him at His word;_
  _And our lives would be all sunshine_
    _In the sweetness of our Lord._

  Word of God, 31.The eyes of fishes generally are so nearly round that they may be used
with good effect as simple microscopes and have considerable magnifying
power.Being continually washed with the element in which they move,
they have no need for winking and the lachrymal duct which supplies
tears to the eyes of most of the animal kingdom is entirely wanting.Whales have no tear glands in their eyes, and the whole order of
Cetacea are tearless.Among domestic animals there is considerable variety of structure in
the eye.The pupil is usually round, but in the small Cats it is long
vertically, and in the Sheep, in fact, in all the cud chewers and many
other grass eaters, the pupil is long horizontally.Insects present a wonderful array of eyes.These are not movable, but
the evident purpose is that there shall be an eye in readiness in
whatever direction the insect may have business.The common Ant has
fifty six-cornered jewels set advantageously in his little head and
so arranged as to take in everything that pertains to the pleasure of
the industrious little creature.As the Ant does not move about with
great rapidity he is less in need of many eyes than the House-fly which
calls into play four thousand brilliant facets, while the Butterfly
is supplied with about seventeen thousand.The most remarkable of all
is the blundering Beetle which bangs his head against the wall with
twenty-five thousand eyes wide open.Then as a nimble Squirrel from the wood
      Ranging the hedges for his filbert food
      Sits pertly on a bough, his brown nuts cracking
      And from the shell the sweet white kernel taking;
    Till with their crooks and bags a sort of boys
    To share with him come with so great a noise
    That he is forced to leave a nut nigh broke,
    And for his life leap to a neighbor oak,
    Thence to a beech, thence to a row of ashes;
    Whilst through the quagmires and red water plashes
    The boys run dabbing through thick and thin.One tears his hose, another breaks his shin;
    This, torn and tattered, hath with much ado
    Got by the briars; and that hath lost his shoe;
    This drops his band; that headlong falls for haste;
    Another cries behind for being last;
    With sticks and stones and many a sounding holloa
    The little fool with no small sport they follow,
    Whilst he from tree to tree, from spray to spray
    Gets to the woods and hides him in his dray.--WILLIAM BROWNE,

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Birds and all Nature, Vol.And I wouldn't 'ave waited to be asked neither."He stood there for a minute very sorrowful, and then 'e patted both their
'eads and went downstairs.Ginger and Peter lay listening for a bit, and
then they turned their pore bound-up faces to each other and tried to
talk with their eyes.Then Ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off, but 'e
might as well 'ave tried to wriggle out of 'is skin.The worst of it was
they couldn't make known their intentions to each other, and when Peter
Russet leaned over 'im and tried to work 'is gag off by rubbing it up
agin 'is nose, Ginger pretty near went crazy with temper.He banged
Peter with his 'ead, and Peter banged back, and they kept it up till
they'd both got splitting 'eadaches, and at last they gave up in despair
and lay in the darkness waiting for Sam.And all this time Sam was sitting in the Red Lion, waiting for them.He
sat there quite patient till twelve o'clock and then walked slowly 'ome,
wondering wot 'ad happened and whether Bill had gone.Ginger was the fust to 'ear 'is foot on the stairs, and as he came into
the room, in the darkness, him an' Peter Russet started shaking their bed
in a way that scared old Sam nearly to death.He thought it was Bill
carrying on agin, and 'e was out o' that door and 'arf-way downstairs
afore he stopped to take breath.He stood there trembling for about ten
minutes, and then, as nothing 'appened, he walked slowly upstairs agin on
tiptoe, and as soon as they heard the door creak Peter and Ginger made
that bed do everything but speak.ses old Sam, in a shaky voice, and standing ready
to dash downstairs agin.There was no answer except for the bed, and Sam didn't know whether Bill
was dying or whether 'e 'ad got delirium trimmings.All 'e did know was
that 'e wasn't going to sleep in that room.He shut the door gently and
went downstairs agin, feeling in 'is pocket for a match, and, not finding
one, 'e picked out the softest stair 'e could find and, leaning his 'ead
agin the banisters, went to sleep.[Illustration: "Picked out the softest stair 'e could find."]It was about six o'clock when 'e woke up, and broad daylight.He was
stiff and sore all over, and feeling braver in the light 'e stepped
softly upstairs and opened the door.Peter and Ginger was waiting for
'im, and as he peeped in 'e saw two things sitting up in bed with their
'air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with
bandages.He was that startled 'e nearly screamed, and then 'e stepped
into the room and stared at 'em as if he couldn't believe 'is eyes."Wot d'ye mean by making sights of
yourselves like that?'Ave you took leave of your senses?"Ginger and Peter shook their 'eads and rolled their eyes, and then Sam
see wot was the matter with 'em.Fust thing 'e did was to pull out 'is
knife and cut Ginger's gag off, and the fust thing Ginger did was to call
'im every name 'e could lay his tongue to."You wait a moment," he screams, 'arf crying with rage."You wait till I
get my 'ands loose and I'll pull you to pieces.The idea o' leaving us
like this all night, you old crocodile.He cut off Peter Russet's gag, and Peter Russet
called 'im 'arf a score o' names without taking breath."And when Ginger's finished I'll 'ave a go at you," he ses."Oh, you wait till I get my 'ands on
you."Sam didn't answer 'em; he shut up 'is knife with a click and then 'e sat
at the foot o' the bed on Ginger's feet and looked at 'em.It wasn't the
fust time they'd been rude to 'im, but as a rule he'd 'ad to put up with
it.He sat and listened while Ginger swore 'imself faint."That'll do," he ses, at last; "another word and I shall put the
bedclothes over your 'ead.Afore I do anything more I want to know wot
it's all about."Peter told 'im, arter fust calling 'im some more names, because Ginger
was past it, and when 'e'd finished old Sam said 'ow surprised he was
at them for letting Bill do it, and told 'em how they ought to 'ave
prevented it.He sat there talking as though 'e enjoyed the sound of 'is
own voice, and he told Peter and Ginger all their faults and said wot
sorrow it caused their friends.Twice he 'ad to throw the bedclothes
over their 'eads because o' the noise they was making.[Illustration: "Old Sam said 'ow surprised he was at them for letting
Bill do it."]"_Are you going--to undo--us?_"  ses Ginger, at last."No, Ginger," ses old Sam; "in justice to myself I couldn't do it.Arter
wot you've said--and arter wot I've said--my life wouldn't be safe.Besides which, you'd want to go shares in my money."He took up 'is chest and marched downstairs with it, and about 'arf an
hour arterward the landlady's 'usband came up and set 'em free.As soon
as they'd got the use of their legs back they started out to look for
Sam, but they didn't find 'im for nearly a year, and as for Bill, they
never set eyes on 'im again.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bill's Lapse, by W.W.All the
Christian reigns are longer than all the non-Christian reigns, ancient
and modern, and Catholic reigns have been longer than Protestant reigns.The reigns in England, which averaged more than twenty-three years
before the Reformation, have only been seventeen years since that, and
those of Sweden, which were twenty-two, have fallen to the same figure
of seventeen.Denmark, however, for some unknown cause does not appear
to have undergone this law of abbreviation; so, says De Maistre with
rather unwonted restraint, let us abstain from generalising.As a matter
of fact, however, the generalisation was complete in his own mind, and
there was nothing inconsistent with his view of the government of the
universe in the fact that a Catholic prince should live longer than a
Protestant; indeed such a fact was the natural condition of his view
being true.Many differences among the people who hold to the
theological interpretation of the circumstances of life arise from the
different degrees of activity which they variously attribute to the
intervention of God, from those who explain the fall of a sparrow to the
ground by a special and direct energy of the divine will, up to those
at the opposite end of the scale, who think that direct participation
ended when the universe was once fairly launched.De Maistre was of
those who see the divine hand on every side and at all times.If, then,
Protestantism was a pernicious rebellion against the faith which God had
provided for the comfort and salvation of men, why should not God be
likely to visit princes, as offenders with the least excuse for their
backslidings, with the curse of shortness of days?In a trenchant passage De Maistre has expounded the Protestant
confession of faith, and shown what astounding gaps it leaves as an
interpretation of the dealings of God with man.'By virtue of a terrible
anathema,' he supposes the Protestant to say, 'inexplicable no doubt,
but much less inexplicable than incontestable, the human race lost all
its rights.Plunged in mortal darkness, it was ignorant of all, since it
was ignorant of God; and, being ignorant of him, it could not pray to
him, so that it was spiritually dead without being able to ask for life.Arrived by rapid degradation at the last stage of debasement, it
outraged nature by its manners, its laws, even by its religions.It
consecrated all vices, it wallowed in filth, and its depravation was
such that the history of those times forms a dangerous picture, which it
is not good for all men so much as to look upon.God, however, _having
dissembled for forty centuries_, bethought him of his creation.At the
appointed moment announced from all time, he did not despise a virgin's
womb; he clothed himself in our unhappy nature, and appeared on the
earth; we saw him, we touched him, he spoke to us; he lived, he taught,
he suffered, he died for us.He arose from his tomb according to his
promise; he appeared again among us, solemnly to assure to his Church a
succour that would last as long as the world.'But, alas, this effort of almighty benevolence was a long way from
securing all the success that had been foretold.For lack of knowledge,
or of strength, or by distraction maybe, God missed his aim, and could
not keep his word.Less sage than a chemist who should undertake to shut
up ether in canvas or paper, he only confided to men the truth that he
had brought upon the earth; it escaped, then, as one might have
foreseen, by all human pores; soon, this holy religion revealed to man
by the Man-God, became no more than an infamous idolatry, which would
remain to this very moment if Christianity after sixteen centuries had
not been suddenly brought back to its original purity by a couple of
sorry creatures.'[23]

Perhaps it would be easier than he supposed to present his own system in
an equally irrational aspect.If you measure the proceedings of
omnipotence by the uses to which a wise and benevolent man would put
such superhuman power, if we can imagine a man of this kind endowed with
it, De Maistre's theory of the extent to which a supreme being
interferes in human things, is after all only a degree less ridiculous
and illogical, less inadequate and abundantly assailable, than that
Protestantism which he so heartily despised.Would it be difficult,
after borrowing the account, which we have just read, of the tremendous
efforts made by a benign creator to shed moral and spiritual light upon
the world, to perplex the Catholic as bitterly as the Protestant, by
confronting him both with the comparatively scanty results of those
efforts, and with the too visible tendencies of all the foremost
agencies in modern civilisation to leave them out of account as forces
practically spent?*       *       *       *       *

De Maistre has been surpassed by no thinker that we know of as a
defender of the old order.If anybody could rationalise the idea of
supernatural intervention in human affairs, the idea of a Papal
supremacy, the idea of a spiritual unity, De Maistre's acuteness and
intellectual vigour, and, above all, his keen sense of the urgent social
need of such a thing being done, would assuredly have enabled him to do
it.In 1817, when he wrote the work in which this task is attempted, the
hopelessness of such an achievement was less obvious than it is now.The Revolution lay in a deep slumber that
many persons excusably took for the quiescence of extinction.Legitimacy
and the spiritual system that was its ally in the face of the
Revolution, though mostly its rival or foe when they were left alone
together, seemed to be restored to the fulness of their power.Fifty
years have elapsed since then, and each year has seen a progressive
decay in the principles which then were triumphant.It was not,
therefore, without reason that De Maistre warned people against
believing '_que la colonne est replacee, parcequ'elle est relevee_.'The
solution which he so elaborately recommended to Europe has shown itself
desperate and impossible.Catholicism may long remain a vital creed to
millions of men, a deep source of spiritual consolation and refreshment,
and a bright lamp in perplexities of conduct and morals; but resting on
dogmas which cannot by any amount of compromise be incorporated with the
daily increasing mass of knowledge, assuming as the condition of its
existence forms of the theological hypothesis which all the
preponderating influences of contemporary thought concur directly or
indirectly in discrediting, upheld by an organisation which its history
for the last five centuries has exposed to the distrust and hatred of
men as the sworn enemy of mental freedom and growth, the pretensions of
Catholicism to renovate society are among the most pitiable and impotent
that ever devout, high-minded, and benevolent persons deluded themselves
into maintaining or accepting.Over the modern invader it is as
powerless as paganism was over the invaders of old.The barbarians of
industrialism, grasping chiefs and mutinous men, give no ear to priest
or pontiff, who speak only dead words, who confront modern issues with
blind eyes, and who stretch out a palsied hand to help.Christianity,
according to a well-known saying, has been tried and failed; the
religion of Christ remains to be tried.One would prefer to qualify the
first clause, by admitting how much Christianity has done for Europe
even with its old organisation, and to restrict the charge of failure
within the limits of the modern time.Whether in changed forms and with new supplements the teaching of its
founder is destined to be the chief inspirer of that social and human
sentiment which seems to be the only spiritual bond capable of uniting
men together again in a common and effective faith, is a question which
it is unnecessary to discuss here.'_They talk about the first centuries
of Christianity_,' said De Maistre, '_I would not be sure that they are
over yet_.'Perhaps not; only if the first centuries are not yet over,
it is certain that the Christianity of the future will have to be so
different from the Christianity of the past, as to demand or deserve
another name.Even if Christianity, itself renewed, could successfully encounter the
achievement of renewing society, De Maistre's ideal of a spiritual power
controlling the temporal power, and conciliating peoples with their
rulers by persuasion and a coercion only moral, appears to have little
chance of being realised.The separation of the two powers is sealed,
with a completeness that is increasingly visible.The principles on
which the process of the emancipation of politics is being so rapidly
carried on, demonstrate that the most marked tendencies of modern
civilisation are strongly hostile to a renewal in any imaginable shape,
or at any future time, of a connection whether of virtual subordination
or nominal equality, which has laid such enormous burdens on the
consciences and understandings of men.If the Church has the uppermost
hand, except in primitive times, it destroys freedom; if the State is
supreme, it destroys spirituality.The free Church in the free State is
an idea that every day more fully recommends itself to the public
opinion of Europe, and the sovereignty of the Pope, like that of all
other spiritual potentates, can only be exercised over those who choose
of their own accord to submit to it; a sovereignty of a kind which De
Maistre thought not much above anarchy.To conclude, De Maistre's mind was of the highest type of those who fill
the air with the arbitrary assumptions of theology, and the abstractions
of the metaphysical stage of thought.At every point you meet the
peremptorily declared volition of a divine being, or the ontological
property of a natural object.The French Revolution is explained by the
will of God; and the kings reign because they have the _esprit royal_.Every truth is absolute, not relative; every explanation is universal,
not historic.These differences in method and point of view amply
explain his arrival at conclusions that seem so monstrous to men who
look upon all knowledge as relative, and insist that the only possible
road to true opinion lies away from volitions and abstractions in the
positive generalisations of experience.There can be no more
satisfactory proof of the rapidity with which we are leaving these
ancient methods, and the social results which they produced, than the
willingness with which every rightly instructed mind now admits how
indispensable were the first, and how beneficial the second.Those can
best appreciate De Maistre and his school, what excellence lay in their
aspirations, what wisdom in their system, who know most clearly why
their aspirations were hopeless, and what makes their system an
anachronism.FOOTNOTES:

[10] De Maistre forgot or underestimated the services of Leo the
Isaurian whose repulse of the Caliph's forces at Constantinople (A.D.717) was perhaps as important for Europe as the more renowned victory of
Charles Martel.But then Leo was an Iconoclast and heretic.Finlay's
_Byzantine Empire_, pp.[11] _Du Pape_, bk.[12] _Du Pape_, bk.'The Greeks,' he
says, 'had at times only a secondary share in the ecclesiastical
controversies in the Eastern Church, though the circumstance of these
controversies having been carried on in the Greek language has made the
natives of Western Europe attribute them to a philosophic, speculative,
and polemic spirit, inherent in the Hellenic mind.A very slight
examination of history is sufficient to prove that several of the
heresies which disturbed the Eastern Church had their origin in the more
profound religious ideas of the oriental nations, and that many of the
opinions called heretical were in a great measure expressions of the
mental nationality of the Syrians, Armenians, Egyptians, and Persians,
and had no conception whatever with the Greek mind.'--_Byzantine Empire,
from 716 to 1057_, p.263) remarks very truly, that 'the religious or
theological portion of Popery, as a section of the Christian Church, is
really Greek; and it is only the ecclesiastical, political, and
theoretic peculiarities of the fabric which can be considered as the
work of the Latin Church.'[14] Sir J. Fitzjames Stephen in the _Saturday Review_, Sept.[15] _Du Pape_, bk.[16] _Ib._ bk.[17] _Ib._ bk.[18] '_Il n'y a point de souverainete qui pour le bonheur des hommes, et
pour le sien surtout, ne soit bornee de quelque maniere, mais dans
l'interieur de ces bornes, placees comme il plait a Dieu, elle est
toujours et partout absolue et tenue pour infaillible.Et quand je parle
de l'exercice legitime de la souverainete, je n'entends point ou je ne
dis point l'exercice_ juste, _ce qui produirait une amphibologie
dangereuse, a moins que par ce dernier mot on ne veuille dire que tout
ce qu'elle opine dans son cercle est_ juste ou tenu pour tel, _ce qui
est la verite.C'est ainsi qu'un tribunal supreme, tant qu'il ne sort
pas de ses attributions, est toujours juste_; car c'est la meme chose
DANS LA PRATIQUE, d'etre infaillible, ou de se tromper sans appel.'--Bk.[19] Thomassin, the eminent French theologian, flourished from the
middle to the end of the seventeenth century.The aim of his writings
generally was to reconcile conflicting opinions on discipline or
doctrine by exhibiting a true sense in all.In this spirit he wrote on
the Pope and the Councils, and on the never-ending question of Grace.Among other things, he insisted that all languages could be traced to
the Hebrew.He wrote a defence of the edict in which Lewis XIV.revoked
the Edict of Nantes, contending that it was less harsh than some of the
decrees of Theodosius and Justinian, which the holiest fathers of the
Church had not scrupled to approve--an argument which would now be
thought somewhat too dangerous for common use, as cutting both ways.Gibbon made use of his _Discipline de l'Eglise_ in the twentieth
chapter, and elsewhere.[20] _Du Pape_, bk.[22] Littre, _Auguste Comte et la Phil.[23] _Du Pape_, Conclusion, p.*       *       *       *       *

from the stomach, and loss of flesh and strength.It ends frequently in
recovery, but it may end in death by perforation of the stomach, by
hemorrhage, or by gradual exhaustion.SYNONYMS.--The following epithets have been employed to designate this
form of ulcer: simple, chronic, round, perforating, corrosive,
digestive, peptic; ulcus ventriculi simplex, s. chronicum, s. rotundum,
s. perforans, s. corrosivum, s. ex digestione, s. pepticum.HISTORY.--It is only since the description of gastric ulcer by
Cruveilhier in the year 1830 that especial attention has been paid to
this disease.In the writings of the ancients only vague and doubtful references to
ulcer of the stomach are found (Galen, Celsus).It is probable that
cases of this disease were described under such names as passio
cardiaca, gastrodynia, haematemesis, and melaena.After the revival of medicine in the sixteenth century, as post-mortem
examination of human bodies was made with greater frequency, the
existence of ulcers and of cicatrices in the stomach could not escape
attention.But only isolated and curious observations of gastric ulcer
are recorded up to near the end of the eighteenth century.One of the
earliest recorded unmistakable cases of perforating ulcer was observed
by John Bauhin, and is described in the _Sepulchretum_ of Bonetus,
published in 1679.Other cases belonging to this period were described
by Donatus, Courtial, Littre, Schenck, and Margagni.[1]

[Footnote 1: References to these and to other cases may be found in
Lebert's _Krankheiten des Magens_, Tubingen, 1878, p.180 _et seq._]

To Matthew Baillie unquestionably belongs the credit of having first
accurately described, in 1793, the anatomical peculiarities of simple
gastric ulcer.[2] At a later date he published three good engravings of
{481} this disease.[3] Baillie's concise and admirable description of
the morbid anatomy of gastric ulcer was unaccompanied by clinical data,
and seems to have had little or no influence in directing increased
attention to this disease.[Footnote 2: _The Morbid Anatomy of Some of the Most Important Parts of
the Human Body_, London, 1793, p.[Footnote 3: _A Series of Engravings, accompanied with Explanations,
etc._, London, 1799.]A valuable account of the symptoms of gastric ulcer was given by John
Abercrombie in 1824.[4] Nearly all of the symptoms now recognized as
belonging to this affection may be found in his article.He knew the
latent causes of the disease, the great diversity of symptoms in
different cases, and the modes of death by hemorrhage, by perforation,
and by asthenia.He regarded ulcer simply as a localized chronic
inflammation of the stomach, and did not distinguish carefully between
simple and cancerous ulceration.[Footnote 4: "Contributions to the Pathology of the Stomach, the
Pancreas, and the Spleen," _Edinburgh Med.See also, by the same author, _Pathological and
Practical Researches on Diseases of the Stomach, etc._--an excellent
work which passed through several editions.]Cruveilhier,[5] in the first volume of his great work on _Pathological
Anatomy_, published between the years 1829 and 1835, for the first time
clearly distinguished ulcer of the stomach from cancer of the stomach
and from ordinary gastritis.He gave an authoritative and full
description of gastric ulcer from the anatomical, the clinical, and the
therapeutical points of view.[Footnote 5: J. Cruveilhier, _Anatomie pathologique du Corps humain_,
tome i., Paris, 1829-35, livr.; and tome ii., Paris,
1835-42, livr.Next to Cruveilhier, Rokitansky has had the greatest influence upon the
modern conception of gastric ulcer.In 1839 this pathologist gave a
description of the disease based upon an analysis of 79 cases.[6] The
anatomical part of his description has served as the model for all
subsequent writers upon this subject.[Footnote 6: Rokitansky, _Oesterreich.Jahrb._, 1839, Bd.(abstract in _Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.Since the ushering in by Cruveilhier and by Rokitansky of the modern
era in the history of gastric ulcer, medical literature abounds in
articles upon this disease.But it cannot be said that the importance
of these works is at all commensurate with their number or that they
have added very materially to the classical descriptions given by
Cruveilhier and by Rokitansky.Perhaps most worthy of mention of the
works of this later era are the article by Jaksch relating to
symptomatology and diagnosis, that of Virchow pertaining to etiology,
the statistical analyses by Brinton, and the contributions to the
treatment of the disease by Ziemssen and by Leube.[7] In 1860, Ludwig
Muller published an extensive monograph upon gastric ulcer.[8]

frequency of simple gastric ulcer.The method usually adopted is to
observe the number of cases in which open ulcers and cicatrices are
found {482} in the stomach in a large number of autopsies.But this
method is open to two objections.The first objection is, that scars in
the stomach, particularly if they are small, are liable to be
overlooked or not to be noted in the record of the autopsy unless
special attention is directed to their search.The second objection is,
that it is not proven that all of the cicatrices found in the stomach
are the scars of healed simple ulcers, and that, in fact, it is
probable that many are not.In consequence of these defects (and others
might be mentioned) this method is of very limited value, although it
is perhaps the best which we have at our disposal.In 32,052 autopsies made in Prague, Berlin, Dresden, Erlangen, and
Kiel,[9] there were found 1522 cases of open ulcer or of cicatrix in
the stomach.If all the scars be reckoned as healed ulcers, according
to these statistics gastric ulcer, either cicatrized or open, is found
in about 5 per cent.[Footnote 9: The Prague statistics embrace 11,888 autopsies, compiled
from the following sources: 1, Jaksch, _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.; 2, Dittrich, _ibid._, vols.vii., viii., ix., x., xii., xiv.; 3,
Willigk, _ibid._, vol.; 4, Eppinger, _ibid._, vol.The Berlin statistics are to be found in dissertations by Plange
(abstract in _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.), by Steiner, and by
Wollmann (abstracts in _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1868), and
by Berthold (1883).The Dresden statistics are in a dissertation by Stachelhausen
(Wurzburg, 1874), referred to by Birch-Hirschfeld, _Lehrb.837, Leipzig, 1877.The Erlangen statistics are reported by Ziemssen in _Volkmann's Samml.The Kiel report is in an inaugural dissertation by Greiss (Kiel, 1879),
referred to in the _Deutsche med.So far as possible, duodenal ulcers have been excluded.Only those
reports have been admitted which include both open ulcers and
cicatrices.]It is important to note the relative frequency of open ulcers as
compared with that of cicatrices.In 11,888 bodies examined in Prague,
there were found 164, or 1.4 per cent., with open ulcers, and 373, or
3.1 per cent., with cicatrices.Here scars were found about two and
one-fourth times as frequently as open ulcers.The observations of
Grunfeld in Copenhagen show that when especial attention is given to
searching for cicatrices in the stomach, they are found much more
frequently than the figures here given would indicate.[10] It would be
a moderate estimate to place the ratio of cicatrices to open ulcers at
3 to 1.[Footnote 10: Grunfeld (abstract in _Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.141, 1883) in 1150 autopsies found 124 cicatrices in the stomach, or 11
per cent., but in only 450 of these cases was his attention especially
directed to their search, and in these he found 92 cases, or 20 per
cent., with scars.Grunfeld's statistics relate only to persons over
fifty years of age.Gastric ulcer, moreover, is extraordinarily common
in Copenhagen.The inexact nature of the ordinary statistics relating to cicatrices is
also evident from the fact that in the four collections of cases which
comprise the Prague statistics the percentage of open ulcers varies
only between 0.81 and 2.44, while the percentage of cicatrices varies
between 0.89 and 5.42.]The statistics concerning the average frequency of open ulcers are much
more exact and trustworthy than those relating to cicatrices.It may be
considered reasonably certain that, at least in Europe, open gastric
ulcers are found on the average in from 1 to 2 per cent.[11]

[Footnote 11: If in this estimate were included infants dying during
the first days of life, the percentage would be much smaller.]It is manifestly impossible to form an accurate estimate of the
frequency of gastric ulcer from the number of cases diagnosed as such
{483} during life, because the diagnosis is in many cases uncertain.Nevertheless, estimates upon this basis have practical clinical value.In 41,688 cases constituting the clinical material of Lebert[12] in
Zurich and in Breslau between the years 1853 and 1873, the diagnosis of
gastric ulcer was made in 252 cases, or about 2/3 per cent.[Footnote 12: Lebert, _op.Of 1699 cases of gastric ulcer collected from various hospital
statistics[13] and examined post-mortem, 692, or 40 per cent., were in
males, and 1007, or 60 per cent., were in females.The result of this
analysis makes the ratio 2 males to 3 females.[Footnote 13: These statistics include the previously-cited Prague,
Berlin, Dresden, and Erlangen cases so far as the sex is given, and in
addition the returns of Rokitansky, _op.cit._; Starcke (Jena),
_Deutsche Klinik_, 1870, Nos.26-29; Lebert, _op.cit._; Chambers,
_London Journ.of Med._, July, 1852; Habershon, _Dis.of the Abdomen_,
3d ed.Soc._, 1880; and the Munich
Hospital, _Annalen d. stadt.Only series of cases from the post-examinations of a number of years
have been admitted.It is an error to include isolated cases from
journals, as Brinton has done, because an undue number of these are
cases of perforation, which is a more common event in females than in
males.Thus, of 43 cases of gastric ulcer presented to the London
Pathological Society since its foundation up to 1882, 19, or 44 per
cent., were cases of perforation.In my cases are included a few
duodenal ulcers not easily separated from the gastric ulcers in the
compilation.]In order to determine from post-mortem records the age at which gastric
ulcer most frequently occurs, all cases in which only cicatrices are
found should be excluded, because a cicatrix gives no evidence as to
the age at which the ulcer existed.The following table gives the age in 607 cases of open ulcer collected
from hospital statistics[14] (post-mortem material):

    Age.----------+---------------+--------
   1-10.|        1      |
  10-20.|       32      |   33

  Over 100.|        1      |    7
  ----------+---------------+--------

From this table it is apparent that three-fourths of the cases are
found between the ages of twenty and sixty, and that the cases are
distributed with tolerable uniformity between these four decades.The
largest number of cases is found between twenty and thirty.The
frequency of gastric ulcer after sixty years diminishes, although it
remains quite considerable, especially in view of the comparatively
small number of those living after that period.[Footnote 14: The sources of these statistics are the same as those of
the statistics relating to sex in the preceding foot-note.The age in
the Erlangen cases of open ulcer is given by Hauser (_Das chronische
Magengeschwur_, p.It is evident that only about
two-fifths of the cases could be utilized, partly because in some the
age was not stated, but mainly on account of the necessity of excluding
scars--a self-evident precaution which Brinton did not take.]The probability that many cases of ulcer included in the above table
existed for several years before death makes it desirable that
estimates as to the occurrence of the disease at different ages should
be made also from cases carefully diagnosed during life, although the
diagnosis must necessarily be less certain than that in the post-mortem
records.The best {484} statistics of this character which we possess
are those of Lebert, from whose work the following table has been
compiled:

Lebert_.----------+---------------+---------+----------

Of these cases, nearly seven-tenths were between twenty and forty years
of age--a preponderance sufficiently great to be of diagnostic
value.[16]

[Footnote 15: _Op.Of these cases, 19 were fatal, and
the diagnosis was confirmed after death.All of the cases were studied
by Lebert in hospitals in Zurich and Breslau.][Footnote 16: In my opinion, clinical experience is more valuable than
are post-mortem records in determining the age at which gastric ulcer
most frequently develops.In support of this opinion are the following
facts: In many cases no positive conclusions as to the age of the ulcer
can be drawn from the post-mortem appearances, and sufficient clinical
history is often wanting; a considerable proportion of the cases of
gastric ulcer do not terminate fatally with the first attack, but are
subject to relapses which may prove fatal in advanced life; in most
general hospitals the number of patients in advanced life is relatively
in excess of those in youth and middle age.By his faulty method of
investigating this question, Brinton came to the erroneous conclusion
that the liability to gastric ulcer is greatest in old age--a
conclusion which is opposed to clinical experience.]The oldest case on record is the one mentioned by Eppinger,[17] of an
old beggar whose age is stated at one hundred and twenty years.[Footnote 17: _Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, Bd.The occurrence of simple ulcer of the stomach under ten years of age is
extremely rare.Rokitansky, with his enormous experience, said that he
had never seen a case under fourteen years.[18] There are recorded,
however, a number of cases of gastric ulcer in infancy and childhood,
but there is doubt as to how many of these are genuine examples of
simple ulcer.Rehn in 1874 analyzed a number, although by no means all,
of the reputed cases, and found only six, or at the most seven, which
would stand criticism.[19] The age in these seven cases varied between
seven days and thirteen years.In one case (Donne) a cicatrix was found
in the stomach of a child three years old.Since the publication of
Rehn's article at least four apparently genuine cases have been
reported--namely, one by Reimer in a child three and a half years old;
one by Goodhart in an infant thirty hours after birth; one by Eross in
a girl twelve years old suffering from acute miliary tuberculosis, in
whom the ulcer perforated into the omental sac; and one by Malinowski
in a girl ten years of age.[20]

{485} the male than in the female.This is apparent from the following

given:[21]

In males the largest number of cases is found between thirty and forty
years, and in females between twenty and thirty.In males 54-1/2 per
cent.of the cases occur after forty years of age, and in females 48.9
per cent.[Footnote 21: These cases are obtained from the same sources as those
of the first table (page 483).]The relation between age and perforation of gastric ulcer will be
discussed in connection with this symptom.The conclusions concerning the age of occurrence of gastric ulcer may
be recapitulated as follows: Simple ulcer of the stomach most
frequently develops in the female between twenty and thirty, and in the
male between thirty and forty.At the post-mortem table it is found
with almost equal frequency in the four decades between twenty and
sixty, but clinically it appears with greatly diminished frequency
after forty years of age.In infancy and early childhood simple ulcer
of the stomach is a curiosity.We have no positive information as to the influence of climate upon the
production of gastric ulcer.The disease seems to be somewhat unequal
in its geographical distribution, but the data bearing upon this point
are altogether insufficient.According to the returns of Dahlerup and of Grunfeld, gastric ulcer is
unusually common in Copenhagen.[22] According to Starcke's
report[23]--which, however, is not based upon a large number of
cases--the percentage is also unusually high in Jena.Sperk says that
gastric ulcer is very common in Eastern Siberia.[24] Palgrave gives a
high percentage of its occurrence in Arabia.[25] The disease is less
common in France than in England or in Germany,[26] and in general
appears to be more common in northern than in southern countries.The
statement of DaCosta[27] coincides with my own impression that gastric
ulcer is less common in this country than in England or in Germany.I
have found 6 cases of open ulcer of the stomach in about 800 autopsies
made by me in New York.[Footnote 22: Dahlerup in Copenhagen (abstract in _Canstatt's
Jahresbericht_, 1842) found 26 cases in 200 autopsies (13 per cent.)made in the course of a year and a half.cit._) found
124 cicatrices in 1150 autopsies (11 per cent.).]cit._) found 39 cases in 384 autopsies (10

expresses the same opinion in the _Proc.In 444,564 deaths in New York City from 1868 to 1882, inclusive, ulcer
of the stomach was assigned as the cause of death only in 410 cases.Little value can be assigned to these statistics as regards a disease
so difficult of diagnosis.]{486} Gastric ulcer is more common among the poor than among the rich.Anxiety, mental depression, scanty food, damp dwellings, insufficient
exercise, and exposure to extreme cold are among the depressing
influences which have been assigned as predisposing causes of gastric
ulcer, but without sufficient proof.The comparative frequency of gastric ulcer among needlewomen,
maidservants, and female cooks has attracted the attention of all who
have had large opportunity for clinical observation.Pressure upon the pit of the stomach, either by wearing tight belts or
in the pursuit of certain occupations, such as those of shoemaking, of
tailoring, and of weaving, is thought by Habershon and others to
predispose to ulcer of the stomach.[28]

[Footnote 28: Bernutz found gastric ulcer in a turner in porcelain, and
learned that other workmen in the same factory had vomited blood.He
thinks that in this and in similar occupations heavy particles of dust
collecting in the mouth and throat may be swallowed with the saliva,
and by their irritation cause gastric ulcer (_Gaz.des Hopitaux_, June
18, 1881).]Vomiting of blood has been known in several instances to affect a
number of members of the same family, but beyond this unsatisfactory
evidence there is nothing to show hereditary influence in the origin of
gastric ulcer.In a few cases injury of the region of the stomach, as by a fall or a
blow, has been assigned as the cause of ulcer.The efficacy of this
cause has been accepted by Gerhardt,[29] Lebert, Ziemssen, and others.In many of the cases in which this cause has been assigned the symptoms
of ulcer appeared so long after the injury that it is doubtful whether
there was any connection between the two.[Footnote 29: "Zur Aetiologie u. Therapie d. runden Magengeschwurz,"
_Wiener med.That loss of substance in the mucous membrane of the stomach may be the
result of injury directly or indirectly applied to this organ cannot
admit of question.But it is characteristic of these traumatic ulcers
that they rapidly heal unless the injury is so severe as to prove
speedily fatal.Thus, Duplay[30] relates three cases in which pain,
vomiting, repeated vomiting of blood, and dyspepsia followed contusions
of the region of the stomach.But these traumatic cases, which for a
time gave the symptoms of gastric ulcer, recovered in from two weeks to
two months, whereas the persistence of the symptoms is a characteristic
of simple ulcer.[31]

[Footnote 30: "Contusions de l'Estomac," _Arch.de Med._, Sept.,
1881.][Footnote 31: In a case reported by Potain, however, the symptoms of
ulcer appeared immediately after injury to the stomach, and continued
up to the time of death (_Gaz.In the same way, ulcers of the stomach produced by corrosive poisons as
a rule soon cicatrize, unless death follows after a short time the
action of the poison.That corrosive ulcers may, however, be closely
allied to simple ulcers is shown by an interesting case reported by
Wilson Fox,[32] in which the immediate effects of swallowing
hydrochloric acid were recovered from in about four days, but death
resulted from vomiting of blood two weeks after.At the autopsy the
source of the hemorrhage was found in an ulcer of the pyloric region of
the stomach.[33] A
boy who suffered severely for three or four days after drinking some
strong mineral acid recovered, so that he {487} ate and drank as usual.Two months afterward he died suddenly from perforation of a gastric
ulcer.[Footnote 33: _The Lancet_, April 9, 1842.]While, then, it would be a great error to identify traumatic and
corrosive ulcers of the stomach with simple ulcer, it is possible that
either may become chronic if associated with those conditions of the
stomach or of the constitution, for the most part unknown to us, which
prevent the ready healing of simple ulcer.Gastric ulcer is often associated with other diseases, but it occurs
also uncomplicated in a large number of cases.Most of the diseases
with which it has been found associated are to be regarded simply as
coincident or complicating affections; but as some of them have been
thought to cause the ulcer, they demand consideration in this
connection.The large share taken by pulmonary phthisis in deaths from all causes
renders this disease a frequent associate of gastric ulcer.It is
probable that the lowered vitality of phthisical patients increases
somewhat their liability to gastric ulcer.Moreover, it would not be
strange if gastric ulcer, as well as other exhausting diseases, such as
diabetes and cancer, diminished the power of resisting tuberculous
infection.Genuine tuberculous ulcers occur rarely in the stomach, but
they are not to be identified with simple ulcer.There is no proof that amenorrhoea or other disorders of menstruation
exert any direct influence in the production of gastric ulcer, although
Crisp went so far as to designate certain cases of gastric ulcer as the
menstrual ulcer.[34] Nevertheless, amenorrhoea is a very common symptom
or associated condition in the gastric ulcer of females between sixteen
and thirty years of age.[Footnote 34: _The Lancet_, Aug.Chlorosis and anaemia, especially in young women, favor the development
of gastric ulcer, but that there is no necessary relation between the
two is shown by the occurrence of ulcer in those previously robust.Moreover, it is probable that in some cases in which the anaemia has
been thought to precede the ulcer it has, in fact, been a result rather
than a cause of the ulcer.Especial interest attaches to the relation between gastric ulcer and
diseases of the heart and of the blood-vessels, because to disturbances
in the circulation in the stomach the largest share in the
pathenogenesis of ulcer has been assigned by Virchow.As might be
expected, valvular lesions of the heart and atheroma of the arteries
are not infrequently found in elderly people who are the subjects of
gastric ulcer.A small proportion of cases of ulcer has been associated
also with other diseases in which the arteries are often abnormal, such
as with chronic diffuse nephritis, syphilis, amyloid degeneration, and
endarteritis obliterans.But, after making the most generous allowance
for the influence of these diseases in the causation of ulcer of the
stomach, there remains a large number of cases of ulcer in which no
disease of the heart or of the arteries has been found.[35] Gastric
ulcer develops most frequently between fifteen and forty years of age,
a period when arterial diseases are not common.Changes in the {488}
blood-vessels of the stomach will be described in connection with the
morbid anatomy of gastric ulcer.[Footnote 35: From Berlin are reported the largest number of cases of
gastric ulcer associated with diseases of the circulatory apparatus;
thus, by Berthold 170 out of 294 cases, and by Steiner 71 out of 110
cases of ulcer.Endocarditis and arterial atheroma (present in
one-third of Berthold's cases of ulcer) form the largest proportion of
these diseases.]Chronic passive congestion of the stomach in cases of cirrhosis of the
liver, direct injury to the mucous membrane of the stomach by parasites
in trichinosis, hemorrhage into the coats of the stomach in scorbutus
and in dementia paralytica, persistent vomiting in pregnancy, and
anaemia induced by prolonged lactation, have each been assigned as
causes in a few cases of gastric ulcer, but they are not associated
with gastric ulcer in enough cases to make their causative influence at
all certain.Galliard assigns diabetes mellitus as the cause in one case of gastric
ulcer.[36]

[Footnote 36: _Clin.de la Pitie_, Paris, 1877, p.Rokitansky attributed some cases of gastric ulcer to intermittent
fever.Those who believe in the inflammatory origin of ulcer of the stomach
think that chronic gastritis is an important predisposing cause.The abuse of alcohol is admitted as an indirect cause of gastric ulcer
by the majority of writers.Lastly, burns of the skin, which are an important factor in the
etiology of duodenal ulcers, have been followed only in a very few
instances by ulcer of the stomach.The direct causes of ulcer of the stomach, concerning which our
positive knowledge is very limited, will be considered under the
pathenogenesis of the disease.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The following classes of cases of gastric ulcer may be
distinguished:

First: Gastric ulcer may give rise to no symptoms pointing to its
existence, and be found accidentally at the autopsy when death has
occurred from some other disease.This latent course is most frequent
with gastric ulcers complicating chronic wasting diseases, such as
tuberculosis, and with gastric ulcers in elderly people.Second: Gastric ulcer may give rise to no marked symptoms before
profuse hemorrhage from the stomach or perforation of the stomach,
resulting speedily in death, occurs.Acute ulcers in anaemic females
from fifteen to thirty years of age are those most liable to perforate
without previous symptoms.Third: Gastric ulcer may occasion only the symptoms of chronic
gastritis, or of functional dyspepsia, or of purely nervous gastralgia,
so that its diagnosis is impossible.In this class of cases after a
time characteristic symptoms may develop.Here, too, sudden death may
occur from hemorrhage or from perforation.Fourth: In typical cases characteristic symptoms are present, so that
the diagnosis can be made more or less positively.These symptoms are
pain, and hemorrhage from the stomach, associated usually with vomiting
and disturbances of digestion.The different symptoms of gastric ulcer will now be described.Of all the symptoms, pain is the most constant and is often the first
to attract attention.It is absent throughout the disease only in
exceptional cases.In different cases, and often in the same case at
different times, the pain varies in its quality, its intensity, its
situation, its duration, and in other characteristics.The kind of pain which is most characteristic of gastric ulcer is
severe {489} paroxysmal pain strictly localized in a circumscribed spot
in the epigastrium, coming on soon after eating, and disappearing as
soon as the stomach is relieved of its contents.More common, although less characteristic, than the strictly localized
pain are paroxysms of severe pain, usually called cardialgic[37] or
gastralgic, diffused over the epigastrium and often spreading into the
surrounding regions.This is like the neuralgic pain of nervous
gastralgia, which is not infrequent in chlorotic and hysterical
females.The pain may be so intense as to induce syncope, or even
convulsions, in very sensitive patients.[Footnote 37: There is much confusion as to the meaning of the term
cardialgia.With most English and American writers it signifies
heartburn, while continental writers understand by cardialgia the
severe paroxysms of epigastric pain which we more frequently call
gastralgia.]The strictly localized pain is probably caused by direct irritation
confined to the nerves in the floor of the ulcer.In the diffuse
gastralgic attacks the irritation radiates or is reflected to the
neighboring nerves, and sometimes to those at a distance.In most cases of gastric ulcer localized epigastric pain and diffuse
gastralgic paroxysms are combined.The painful sense of oppression and fulness in the epigastrium which is
felt in many cases of gastric ulcer after eating is simply a dyspeptic
symptom, and is probably referable to an associated chronic catarrhal
gastritis.This dyspeptic pain is of little value in diagnosis.Most subjects of gastric ulcer feel in the intervals between the
paroxysms a more or less constant dull pain, or it may be only a sense
of uneasiness, in the epigastrium.When sharp epigastric pain is felt
continuously, it is usually inferred that the ulcer has extended to the
peritoneum and has caused a circumscribed peritonitis, but this
inference is not altogether trustworthy.The quality of the pain caused by gastric ulcer is described variously
as burning, gnawing, boring, less frequently as lancinating.More important than the quality is the situation of the pain.The
situation of the localized pain is usually at or a little below the
ensiform cartilage.It may, however, be felt as low as the umbilicus or
it may deviate to the hypochondria.In addition to pain in the
epigastrium (point epigastrique), Cruveilhier called attention to the
frequent presence of pain in the dorsal region (point rachidien).The
dorsal pain, which may be more severe than the epigastric, is sometimes
interscapular, and sometimes corresponds to the lowest dorsal or to the
upper lumbar vertebrae.It is usually a little to the left of the
spine.The pain is often described as extending from the pit of the
stomach through to the back.According to Brinton, the situation of the localized pain gives a clue
to the situation of the ulcer, pain near the left border of the
ensiform cartilage indicating ulcer near the cardiac orifice, pain in
the median line and to the right of this indicating ulcer of the
pyloric region, and pain in the left hypochondrium indicating ulcer of
the fundus.It does not often happen that the pain remains so sharply
localized as to make possible this diagnosis, even if the situation of
the pain were a safe guide.Of the various circumstances which influence the severity of the pain
in gastric ulcer, the most important is the effect of food.Pain
usually {490} comes on within a few minutes to half an hour after
taking food, although it may appear immediately after ingestion or be
delayed for an hour or more.The pain continues until the stomach is
relieved of its contents by vomiting or by their passage into the
duodenum.It is unsafe to attempt to diagnose the position of the ulcer
merely from the length of time which elapses between the ingestion of
food and the onset of pain.It has sometimes been noticed that as
improvement progresses pain comes on later and later after eating.As
might naturally be expected, coarse, indigestible,
imperfectly-masticated food, sour and spirituous liquids, and hot
substances are more irritating than bland articles of diet.In some
exceptional cases the ingestion of even coarse food, instead of
aggravating, has had no effect upon the pain, or at least for the time
being has even relieved it.External pressure usually increases the intensity of the pain of
gastric ulcer; in rare instances pressure relieves the pain.Rest and the recumbent posture as a rule alleviate the pain of ulcer of
the stomach.The position of the patient may affect the severity of the
pain in a more striking way.It may naturally be supposed that that
posture is most agreeable which removes from the ulcer the weight of
the food during digestion.Hence it was claimed by Osborne[38] that the
site of the ulcer could often be inferred from the effect of posture on
the pain.Thus, relief in the prone position would indicate ulcer of
the posterior wall; relief in the supine position, ulcer of the
anterior wall; relief on the left or on the right side, ulcer of the
pyloric or of the cardiac region respectively.As ulcer of the
posterior wall is the most frequent, relief should be obtained oftener
by bending forward or by lying on the face than in the supine position.Experience has shown that the influence of posture on the pain is not a
safe guide in diagnosing the location of the ulcer.[Footnote 38: Jonathan Osborne, _Dublin Journal of Medical Science_,
vol.Mental emotions--particularly anxiety and anger--fatigue, even moderate
exercise, exposure to cold, and the menstrual molimen may each cause
exacerbations of pain in some cases of gastric ulcer.Tenderness on pressure is a common symptom of gastric ulcer.A
localized point of tenderness may be discovered even when the
subjective pain is not localized.Pain sometimes follows pressure not
immediately, but after a brief interval.A fixed point of tenderness
can often be determined when the stomach is empty more accurately than
when it is full.The tender spot can sometimes be covered by the
finger's end.In searching for a point of tenderness it should be
remembered that many persons are very sensitive to pressure in the
epigastrium, and also that pressure is not without danger to those who
are the subjects of gastric ulcer.Not only may pressure induce
paroxysms of pain, but it may cause even rupture of the ulcerated walls
of the stomach.[39] Hence pressure should be cautiously employed and
should not be often repeated.[Footnote 39: Dalton has reported a case in which perforation of a
gastric ulcer occurred while the patient was subjected in a water-cure
establishment to kneading of the abdomen to relieve his flatulence
(_Trans.In some cases of gastric ulcer pain is felt in regions at a distance
from the stomach.The most frequent of these so-called radiation
neuralgias are--neuralgia of the lower intercostal spaces, combined
sometimes with {491} hyperaesthesia or with analgesia of the affected
region, pain in the right shoulder (perhaps due to adhesions between
the stomach and the liver or the diaphragm), pain in the left shoulder,
and pain in the loins.In a case of ulcer reported by Traube
terminating in perforation the sole complaint, besides loss of appetite
and retching, had been difficulty in breathing and oppression in the
chest.These symptoms, which may be combined with gastralgic paroxysms,
are referred by Traube to transference of the irritation from the
gastric to the pulmonary filaments of the pneumogastric nerve.[40]

[Footnote 40: _Deutsche Klinik_, 1861, No.These symptoms evidently
correspond to the vagus neurosis described by Rosenbach, in which, as
the result of reflex irritation of the pneumogastric nerve in the
stomach, occur difficulty in breathing, oppression in the chest,
palpitation, arhythmical action of the heart, and epigastric pulsation
(_Deutsche med.Wochenschr._, 1879, Nos.Sometimes the pain of gastric ulcer intermits for days or even weeks.When the intermission is of considerable duration it is probable that
cicatrization has been in progress.It should, however, be remembered
that gastralgic attacks may continue even after cicatrization of the
ulcer is completed, probably in consequence of compression of
nerve-filaments by the cicatricial tissue.Once in a while the pain
exhibits a marked periodicity in its appearance.Thus in a case of
ulcer ending fatally from hemorrhage the pain came on but once a day,
and that with considerable regularity at the same hour.In this case
the pain was relieved by taking food.[41] The pain of gastric ulcer may
be temporarily relieved by hemorrhage from the stomach, and perhaps by
division of the irritated nerve by sloughing (Habershon).[Footnote 41: Case reported by Peacock, _Rep.The causes of the pain of gastric ulcer are not far to seek.Foremost
is the irritation of nerve-filaments exposed by the ulcerative process.The irritation may be by mechanical, chemical, or thermic agencies.With our present imperfect knowledge it is profitless to discuss
whether the pneumogastric or the sympathetic nerves are the chief
carriers of the abnormal sensations.[42] In the next place, we may have
radiation of the irritation from these nerves to neighboring and even
to remote nerves.Furthermore, the extension of the inflammation to the
peritoneum and the surrounding parts, and the formation of adhesions,
are additional factors in some cases in causing pain.Finally, the
great differences in susceptibility to pain manifested by different
individuals is to be borne in mind.[Footnote 42: Leven, without sufficient reason, distinguishes two kinds
of gastralgic attacks--the one having its point of departure in the
pneumogastric, the other in the sympathetic nerve; in the former the
pain is associated with dyspnoea and palpitation of the heart; in the
latter the pain is deeper, and is accompanied by vaso-motor (?)troubles on one side of the body.]Next to pain, vomiting is the most frequent symptom of gastric ulcer.There is, however, little which is characteristic of ulcer in this
symptom, unless the vomited material contains blood.In some cases of
gastric ulcer vomiting is the most marked and most distressing symptom
of the disease.It may, however, be absent during the whole course of
gastric ulcer.Vomiting occurs most frequently after taking food, and is greatly
aggravated by an unregulated diet.Sometimes nearly everything which is
taken into the stomach is vomited.The vomiting of mucus or of a {492}
thin fluid unmixed with food is indicative only of chronic catarrhal
gastritis.Alimentary vomiting, which is more indicative of gastric
ulcer, usually occurs not immediately after taking food, but at the
acme of a gastralgic attack caused by the food.Soon after the stomach
is emptied by one or more acts of vomiting the pain is relieved.The
act of vomiting is usually easy, and at times is hardly more than
regurgitation of the food.Sometimes the patient experiences an
excessively sour taste from the vomit.Vomiting exhausts the patient by withdrawing nutriment, and when
persistent may even cause death from inanition.But in some cases of
gastric ulcer, especially in women, the vomiting seems to be mainly a
nervous symptom, and even when long continued may be attended by little
or no loss of flesh.Evidently, more food is retained in these cases
than might be supposed.There are two evident causes of vomiting in gastric ulcer--namely,
chronic catarrhal gastritis, which is a frequent complication, and
direct irritation of the nerves in the ulcer.Vomiting due to
dilatation of the stomach is oftener a sequel than an immediate symptom
of gastric ulcer.For the diagnosis of gastric ulcer hemorrhage from the stomach is the
most important symptom.The frequency of only the larger hemorrhages can be determined with any
degree of exactness.If the blood be effused in small quantity or
slowly, it may be discharged solely with the stools and escape
detection.Such slight hemorrhages doubtless occur in most cases of
gastric ulcer.It is probable that easily-recognized hemorrhages from
the stomach occur in about one-third of the cases of gastric ulcer.[43]
Hemorrhage is absent as a rule in the acute perforating ulcer of the
stomach.[Footnote 43: In consequence of the uncertainty of the diagnosis in
cases of gastric ulcer which recover without hemorrhage, the estimates
of the frequency of this symptom have a very limited value, and will
vary with different observers according to their standard of diagnosis
of this disease.Lebert observed gastric hemorrhage in four-fifths of
his carefully-studied cases, and in three-fifths of his cases there was
profuse haematemesis.Brinton estimates that the larger hemorrhages
occur in about one-third of the cases.Muller found them in one-fourth
of the cases which he analyzed.]In most cases hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is preceded by pain,
vomiting, and disturbances of digestion.Antecedent symptoms may,
however, be absent, or may be so obscure that no suspicion of ulcer
exists until the hemorrhage occurs.The hemorrhage may be slight, moderate, or excessive in amount
(Cruveilhier).The larger hemorrhages are those which are most
distinctive of gastric ulcer.The blood may be vomited, or voided with the stools, or retained in the
stomach and the intestines.As has been remarked, when the hemorrhage is scanty all the blood may
escape by the bowel.Sometimes, although much less frequently, blood
effused in large quantity is entirely evacuated with the stools.After
haematemesis more or less blood is discharged by the bowel, sometimes
for several days after the vomiting of blood has ceased.Blood which
has traversed the whole length of the intestinal canal acquires a tarry
consistence and a black or brownish color in consequence of the
production of dark-brown haematin by the action of the digestive juices
{493} upon the haemoglobin, and in consequence of the formation of
black sulphide of iron by the union of hydrogen sulphide in the lower
part of the intestine with the iron of the haematin.The passage of
these black viscid stools is called melaena.Inasmuch as we cannot
presume gastric hemorrhage to be absent simply because no blood has
been vomited, it is evidently important to examine the stools for blood
when the diagnosis of gastric ulcer is obscure, and also in cases of
gastric ulcer where there are symptoms of internal hemorrhage not
accounted for by blood vomited.It should be remembered that certain
drugs, particularly iron and bismuth, may blacken the feces.In very exceptional cases of gastric ulcer the effusion of a large
volume of blood causes sudden death before any of the blood has been
vomited.The autopsy shows the stomach and more or less of the small
intestine distended with coagulated blood.Hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is usually made manifest by the vomiting
of blood.The quantity of the vomited blood varies from mere traces to
several pounds.The color and the consistence of the blood depend upon
the quantity effused and the length of time that the blood has remained
in the stomach.Blood which has been acted upon by the gastric juice is
coagulated, has a grumous consistence, and acquires by the formation of
haematin out of haemoglobin a dark-brown color, often compared to that
of coffee-grounds.Blood effused in small quantity is usually vomited
only with the food, and has usually the coffee-grounds appearance.The
patient's condition is not appreciably influenced by this slight loss
of blood.A little blood expelled after repeated acts of vomiting has
no diagnostic importance.Vomiting usually occurs soon after a large
gastric hemorrhage.It is the mechanical distension of the stomach
rather than any irritating quality of the blood which causes the
vomiting.Blood which is rejected immediately after a large gastric
hemorrhage is alkaline, fluid, and of an arterial (rarely of a venous)
hue.Often, however, even with large hemorrhages, the blood remains
sufficiently long in the stomach to be partly coagulated and to be
darkened in color.Ulcer more frequently than any other disease of the
stomach causes the vomiting of unaltered blood in large quantity.But
this kind of haematemesis is not peculiar to simple ulcer.It may occur
in other diseases, such as gastric cancer, and coffee-ground vomiting
may be associated with ulcer.Copious haematemesis in cases of gastric ulcer appears usually without
premonition, or it may be preceded for a day or two by increased pain.Its occurrence is somewhat more common during the digestion of food
than in the intervals, but there have been cases of ulcer where the
bleeding was favored by an empty stomach and was checked by the
distension of the organ with food.The free use of stimulants and
violent physical or mental exertion may excite hemorrhage.With the
onset of the hemorrhage the patient experiences a sense of warmth and
of oppression at the epigastrium, followed by faintness, nausea, and
the vomiting of a large quantity of blood.An attack of syncope often
causes, at least temporarily, cessation of the hemorrhage.But the
thrombus which closes the eroded vessel may easily be washed away, so
that the hemorrhage often recurs and continues at intervals for several
days, thereby greatly increasing the danger to the patient.Thus, the
tendency is for {494} the hemorrhage from gastric ulcer to appear in
phases or periods occupying several days.A single hemorrhage is rarely so profuse as to cause immediate death.More frequently the patient dies after successive hemorrhages.In the
majority of cases the hemorrhage is not immediately dangerous to life,
but is followed by symptoms of anaemia, more or less profound according
to the strength of the patient and the amount of blood lost.Prostration and pallor follow the larger hemorrhages.Dizziness,
ringing in the ears, and dimness of vision appear when the patient
attempts to leave the recumbent posture.Thirst is often a marked
symptom.The pulse is feeble and more frequent than normal.There is
often a moderate elevation of temperature (anaemic fever) after profuse
hemorrhage.The urine is pale, abundant, and sometimes contains albumen
(Quincke).After a few days anaemic cardiac murmurs can often be heard.Under favorable circumstances these symptoms of anaemia disappear in
the course of a few weeks.The other symptoms of ulcer, particularly the pain, are sometimes
notably relieved, and may even disappear, after an abundant hemorrhage.They usually, however, return sooner or later.After a variable
interval one attack of haematemesis is likely to be followed by others.There is much diversity in different cases as regards the frequency of
these attacks and the character of the symptoms in the intervals.In a
few cases recovery follows a single attack of gastric hemorrhage; in
other cases the hemorrhage recurs frequently after intervals of only a
few days, weeks, or months; in still other cases hemorrhage recurs only
after long intervals, perhaps of years, although other symptoms of
ulcer continue.Sometimes the disappearance of symptoms indicates only
an apparent cure, and later the patient dies suddenly while in apparent
health by a profuse gastric hemorrhage.In the rare cases of this last
variety Cruveilhier has found sometimes that the ulcer has cicatrized
except just over the eroded blood-vessel.The sources of the hemorrhage in gastric ulcer will be described in
connection with the morbid anatomy.The symptoms of gastric indigestion are commonly, although not
constantly, present in gastric ulcer.They may constitute the sole
symptoms, in which case the diagnosis of the lesion is impossible.The
most important local symptoms of gastric dyspepsia are diminution, less
frequently perversion or increase, of the appetite; increased thirst;
during digestion, and sometimes independent of digestion, a feeling of
discomfort merely or of painful oppression, or even of sharp pain, in
the epigastrium; nausea; vomiting of undigested food, of mucus, and of
bile; regurgitation of thin fluids; often acid, sometimes neutral or
alkaline, flatulence, with belching of gas, and constipation.In many
cases of gastric ulcer the appetite is not disturbed, but the patient
refrains from eating on account of the pain caused by taking food.Among the so-called sympathetic symptoms of dyspepsia are headache,
dizziness, depression of spirits, oppression in the chest, and
irregularity of the heart's action.Dyspepsia contributes its share to
the production of the anaemia and of the loss of flesh and strength
which are present in some degree in most cases of chronic gastric
ulcer.{495} In many cases of acute perforating ulcer, as well as in some
cases of chronic ulcer, the symptoms are either absent or they are but
slightly marked.It has been demonstrated that in many cases of gastric
ulcer the resorptive power of the mucous membrane of the stomach is
unimpaired.[44]

[Footnote 44: This is shown by the experiments of Pentzoldt and Faber,
who determined the length of time which elapsed between swallowing
gelatin capsules containing iodide of potassium and the appearance of
the iodide in the saliva (_Berl.Quetsch observed rapid absorption from the stomach in two cases of
gastric ulcer (_ibid._, 1884, No.It is believed that also the
duration of the digestive process in the stomach is often within normal
limits in cases of gastric ulcer, although exact experiments upon this
point, as they require the use of the stomach-pump, have not been made
in this disease (Leube).]The most common cause of dyspepsia in gastric ulcer is the chronic
catarrhal gastritis which usually accompanies this disease.It is
probable that the movements of the stomach may be seriously interfered
with by destruction of the muscular coat of the stomach when the ulcer
is of considerable size and is seated in the pyloric region.Adhesions
of the stomach to surrounding parts may likewise impair the normal
movements of the stomach.It is possible that ulcers, especially those
which are very painful, may cause reflex disturbance of the peristaltic
movements of the stomach and alterations in the quality or the quantity
of the gastric juice.The serious digestive disturbances which are
caused by distortions and dilatation of the stomach resulting from
cicatricial contraction of gastric ulcer are not considered in this
article.Although Niemeyer emphasized the frequency in gastric ulcer of a
strikingly red tongue with smooth or furrowed surface, it does not
appear that any especial importance is to be attached to this or to any
other condition of the tongue as a symptom of the disease.Increased flow of saliva is a rare symptom, which, when it occurs, is
usually associated with dyspepsia.Constipation is the rule in gastric ulcer.The most important of the
various circumstances which combine to produce this condition is the
small amount of solid food taken and retained by the patient.The
restraint caused by gastric ulcer and gastric catarrh in the normal
movements of the stomach may diminish by reflex action the peristalsis
of the intestines (Traube and Radziejewski).The passage of large
quantities of blood along the intestinal canal is often associated with
colicky pains and diarrhoea.Amenorrhoea is a symptom which was formerly thought to be
characteristic of gastric ulcer, although there was much discussion as
to whether it was the cause or the result of the ulcer.Amenorrhoea is
indeed common in the gastric ulcer of young women, but there is nothing
strange in this when one considers the frequency of amenorrhoea in
general, and its causation by various debilitating and depressing
influences such as are to be found in gastric ulcer.Notwithstanding a
few striking cases which have been recorded, it has not been
demonstrated that hemorrhages vicarious of menstruation take place from
gastric ulcer.Gastric ulcer is not a febrile disease.Temporary elevation of
temperature may follow profuse gastrorrhagia and may attend various
complications, of which the most important are gastritis and
peritonitis.It has been recently claimed by Peter that the
surface-temperature of the {496} epigastrium is elevated in gastric
ulcer, but the observations upon this point are as yet too few for any
positive conclusions.[45]

[Footnote 45: According to Peter, the normal surface-temperature of the
epigastrium is from 95-1/2 degrees to 96 degrees F.(35.3 degrees to
35.5 degrees C.), while in gastric ulcer the temperature may equal or
even exceed by one or two degrees the axillary temperature.It is said
to register the highest during attacks of pain and of vomiting and
after hemorrhages (_Gaz.des Hopitaux_, June 23 and 30, 1883).See also
Beaurieux (_Essai sur la Pseudo-gastralgie, etc._, These, Paris,
1879).]The general health of the patient remains sometimes surprisingly good,
even in cases of gastric ulcer with symptoms sufficiently marked to
establish the diagnosis.But in most cases of chronic gastric ulcer the
general nutrition sooner or later becomes impaired.This cannot well be
otherwise when dyspepsia, vomiting, paroxysms of severe pain, and
hemorrhage are present, separately or in combination, for any great
length of time.In proportion to the severity and the continuance of
these symptoms the patient becomes pale, weak, and emaciated.The face,
thin, anxious, of a grayish-white color, and marked with sharp lines of
suffering, presents the appearance which the older writers called
facies abdominalis, to which even so recent an author as Brinton
attaches exaggerated diagnostic importance.A little cachectic dropsy
may appear about the ankles.While it is true that the general
nutrition is less rapidly, less continuously, and, as a rule, less
deeply, impaired in gastric ulcer than in gastric cancer, nevertheless
sometimes a cachexia develops in the former which is not to be
distinguished from that of cancer.Litten[46] relates a case of gastric
ulcer which simulated for a time pernicious anaemia.In this case the
profound anaemia could not be explained by vomiting, hemorrhage, or
other symptoms of ulcer.[Footnote 46: _Berliner klin.Beyond determining the existence of a fixed point of epigastric
tenderness, physical examination of the region of the stomach is
usually only of negative value in the diagnosis of gastric ulcer.In
some cases of ulcer of the stomach epigastric pulsation is very marked,
and sometimes most marked during gastralgic attacks.In these cases
there may be dilatation of the aorta from paralysis of vaso-motor
nerves analogous to the dilatation of the carotid and temporal arteries
in certain forms of migraine (Rosenbach).When the diagnosis lies
between gastric ulcer and gastric cancer, the presence of epigastric
tumor is justly considered to weigh against ulcer; but it is important
to know that tumor may be associated with ulcer.Thickening of the
tissues around old ulcers and the presence of adhesions may give rise
to a tumor.A thickened portion of omentum which had become adherent
over an old gastric ulcer produced a tumor which led to a mistake in
the diagnosis.[47] Rosenbach[48] calls attention to the occasional
production of false tumors by spasm of the muscular coat of the stomach
around a gastric ulcer.These tumors disappear spontaneously or yield
to the artificial distension of the stomach by Seidlitz powders--a
procedure which one would not venture to adopt if he suspected gastric
ulcer.Fenwick thinks that in some cases of gastric ulcer fixation of
the stomach by adhesions can be made out by physical exploration.[Footnote 47: A. Beer, _Wiener med.Wochenschrift_, 1882, p.The gravest symptom which can occur in gastric ulcer is the perforation
of the ulcer into the general peritoneal cavity.{497} Only rough estimates can be made of the frequency of this
symptom.These estimates vary from 2 to 25 per cent.From the data
which I have collected I infer that perforation into the general
peritoneal cavity occurs in about 6-1/2 per cent.of all cases of
gastric ulcer.[49]

[Footnote 49: Miquel (_Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.65, 1864) reckons
the frequency of perforation at 2 per cent.Brinton's estimate of
13-1/2 per cent.He found 69 cases of
perforation in 257 open ulcers collected from various sources.He
doubles the number of open ulcers, as he considers cicatrized ulcers
twice as frequent as the open.The statistics of some of the authors to
whom he refers should not be used in this computation, either because
they do not give accurately the number of cases of perforation, or
because they include under perforation all cases of ulcer which have
penetrated all of the coats of the stomach, whereas of course only
perforation into the general peritoneal cavity should be here included.Valuable and laborious as are Brinton's researches, his statistics upon
this point, as upon many others, are inaccurate.In 249 fatal cases of open ulcer taken from the statistics of Jaksch,
Dittrich, Willigk, Wrany (_Prager Vierteljahr._, vols.),
Eppinger, Starcke, Chambers, Moore, and Lebert (_loc.cit._), I find 50
cases of perforation into the peritoneal cavity.This makes the
percentage of perforations 6-1/2 if the open ulcers be multiplied by 3,
the number of cicatrized ulcers being taken as three times that of open
ulcers (p.This method of computation, which is adopted by
Brinton, is defective on account of the uncertainty as to the proper
proportion between cicatrized and open ulcers.Lebert observed 9 cases of perforation with fatal peritonitis in his
252 cases studied clinically.He places the frequency of perforation
with peritonitis at 3 to 5 per cent., which corresponds to Engel's
estimate of 5-1/2 per cent.(_Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, 1853, ii.).]As regards sex, perforation occurs two to three times oftener in the
female than in the male.This increased liability is referable mainly
to the preponderance of the acute perforating ulcer in young women.[50]

[Footnote 50: The liability to perforation in females seems to be not
only absolutely, but also relatively, to the number of ulcers greater
than in males, although, on the contrary, Brinton holds that the excess
of perforations in females is not greater than that of ulcers.Berthold
found perforation in 3.1 per cent.of the cases of gastric ulcer in
males, and in 9.7 per cent.In the female the liability to perforation of gastric ulcer is greatest
between fourteen and thirty years of age.In the male there seems to be
no greater liability to perforation at one age than at another.[51]

[Footnote 51: Of 139 cases of perforated ulcer in females, Brinton
found that four-fifths occurred before the age of thirty-five.He
calculates the average age at which perforation occurs in the female as
twenty-seven, and in the male as forty-two.He thinks that the average
liability to perforation in both sexes decreases as life advances,
although he holds that the liability to ulcer itself constantly
increases with age.]As will be explained in considering the morbid anatomy, ulcers of the
anterior wall of the stomach perforate more frequently than those in
other situations.As regards the symptoms which may have preceded perforation three
groups of cases can be distinguished:

In the first there has been no complaint of gastric disturbance.In the
midst of apparent health perforation may occur and cause death within a
few hours.This is the ulcere foudroyante of French writers.It is met
with more commonly in chlorotic young women than in any other class.In the second group of cases, which are more frequent, gastric symptoms
have been present for a longer or shorter time, but have been so
ambiguous that the diagnosis of gastric ulcer is not clear until
perforation occurs.Then, unfortunately, the diagnosis is of little
more than retrospective interest.In the third group of cases perforation takes place in the course of
gastric ulcer, the existence of which has been made evident by
characteristic symptoms, such as localized pain and profuse hemorrhage.{498} The immediate cause of perforation of gastric ulcer is often some
agency which produces mechanical tension of the stomach, such as
distension of the organ with food or with gas, vomiting, straining at
stool, coughing, sneezing, pressure on the epigastrium, violent
exertion, and jolting of the body.With the escape of the solid, the fluid, and the gaseous contents of
the stomach into the peritoneal cavity at the moment of perforation, an
agonizing pain is felt, beginning in the epigastrium and extending
rapidly over the abdomen, which becomes very sensitive to pressure.The
pain sometimes radiates to the shoulders.Symptoms of collapse often
appear immediately or they may develop gradually.The pulse becomes
small, rapid, and feeble.The face is pale, anxious, and drawn (facies
hippocratica).The surface of the body, particularly of the
extremities, is cold and covered with clammy sweat.The internal
temperature may be subnormal, normal, or elevated; after the
development of peritonitis it is usually, but not always, elevated.Consciousness is usually retained to the last, although the patient is
apathetic.Vomiting is sometimes absent--a circumstance which may be of
value in diagnosis, and which Traube attributes to the readiness with
which the contents of the stomach can be discharged through the
abnormal opening into the peritoneal cavity.The respirations become more and more frequent and costal
in type.Suppression of urine is not an
uncommon symptom, although there may be frequent and painful attempts
at micturition.Albumen and casts may appear temporarily in the urine.Retraction of one testicle, like that in renal colic, has been observed
(Blomfield).The patient usually lies on his back with the knees drawn
up.The abdomen is often at first hard and retracted from spasmodic
contraction of the abdominal muscles, but later it usually becomes
tympanitic, sometimes to an extreme degree.The presence of tympanitic
resonance replacing hepatic dulness in front is usually considered the
most important physical sign of gas free in the peritoneal cavity, but
this sign is equivocal.On the one hand, the presence of adhesions over
the anterior surface of the liver may prevent the gas from getting
between the liver and the diaphragm;[52] and on the other hand, in
cases of meteorism coils of intestine may make their way between the
liver and the diaphragm, or the liver may be pushed upward and
backward, so that its anterior surface becomes superior and the hepatic
dulness in front disappears.Physical examination may reveal in the
dependent parts of the peritoneal cavity an accumulation of fluid
partly escaped from the stomach and partly an inflammatory exudate.[53]
For humane reasons one should not submit the patient to the pain of
movement in order to elicit a succussion sound or to determine change
in the position of the fluid upon changing the position of the
patient.[54] There is sometimes relief from pain for some hours before
death.[Footnote 52: Even without these adhesions liver dulness may persist
after perforation of the stomach, as in a case of Nothnagel's in which
for twenty-four hours after a large perforation from gastric ulcer the
abdomen was retracted and hepatic dulness was well marked (Garmise,
_Ulcus Ventriculi cum peritonitide perforativa_, Inaug.Diss., Jena,
1879).][Footnote 53: In a case of peritonitis resulting from perforation of a
latent ulcer of the duodenum, Concato found in the acid fluid withdrawn
by aspiration from the peritoneal cavity Sarcina ventriculi (_Giorn.delle Scienze Med._, 1879, No.[Footnote 54: Other symptoms which have been thought to be diagnostic
of pneumo-peritoneum in {499} distinction from meteorism, but the value
of which is doubtful, are these: In pneumo-peritoneum the respiratory
murmur can be heard by auscultation over the entire abdomen, while in
meteorism it does not extend beyond the region of the stomach
(Cantani); in the former amphoric sounds synchronous with respiration
can sometimes be heard over the abdomen (Larghi); borborygmi are heard,
if at all, distantly and feebly; the percussion note of gas free over
the liver is different from that of tympanitic intestine (Traube); the
percussion note is of the same character over the whole anterior wall
of the abdomen; the epigastric region is more elastic to the feel than
in tympanites; the distension of the abdomen is more uniform than in
tympanites; and coils of distended intestine, sometimes showing
peristaltic movement, cannot be seen or felt as in some cases of
meteorism (Howitz).]There are exceptional cases of perforation in which some of the most
important of the enumerated symptoms, such as pain, tenderness of the
abdomen on pressure, tympanites, and the symptoms of collapse, are
absent.Death sometimes occurs from shock within six or eight hours after
perforation.More frequently life is prolonged from eighteen to
thirty-six hours, it may be even for three or four days, and, very
rarely, even longer.[55] When life is prolonged more than twelve hours
an acute diffuse peritonitis is usually but not always developed.[Footnote 55: In the _Descriptive Catalogue of the Warren Anatomical
Museum_, by Dr.J. B. S. Jackson, p.448, Boston, 1870, is described a
case of gastric ulcer in which, so far as can be judged by the symptoms
and the post-mortem appearances, the patient lived nineteen days after
perforation.]The contents of the stomach, instead of being diffused throughout the
peritoneal cavity, may be confined by a rapidly-developed circumscribed
peritonitis to a space near the stomach, or perforation may occur into
a space previously shut off from the general peritoneal sac by
adhesions.In this way circumscribed peritoneal abscesses form in the
neighborhood of the stomach.Diffuse peritonitis may be caused either
by an extension of the inflammation or by the rupture of these
abscesses into the general peritoneal cavity.The cases of
circumscribed peritonitis following perforation of gastric ulcer, with
escape of the contents of the stomach, although more protracted than
those in which the whole peritoneal surface is at once involved,
generally terminate fatally sooner or later.The most interesting of these peritoneal abscesses is the variety to
which Leyden has given the name of pyo-pneumothorax subphrenicus (false
pneumothorax of Cossy), the diagnostic features of which first were
recognized by G. W. Barlow and Wilks in 1845.[56] Here there is a
cavity, circumscribed by adhesions, just beneath the diaphragm,
containing pus and gas and communicating with either the stomach or the
intestine.By the encroachment of this cavity upon the thoracic space
the symptoms and signs of pyo-pneumothorax are simulated.Barlow and
Leyden have diagnosed during life this affection when resulting from
perforated gastric ulcer.The points in diagnosis from genuine
pyo-pneumothorax are the presence of respiratory murmur from the
clavicle to the third rib, the extension of the respiratory murmur
downward by deep inspiration, history of preceding gastric disturbance
with circumscribed peritonitis, absence of preceding pulmonary
symptoms, rapid variations in the limits of dulness with changes in the
position of the body, absence or only slight evidence of increased
intrapleural pressure (such as bulging of the {500} thorax as a whole,
and of the intercostal spaces), displacement of the heart, displacement
of the liver downward, and, if necessary, the determination by means of
a manometer that the pressure in the abscess cavity rises during
inspiration and falls during expiration, the reverse being true in
genuine pneumothorax.[57]

[Footnote 56: Barlow and Wilks, _London Med.Gazette_, May, 1845;
Leyden, _Zeitschr.Med._, i. Heft 2; Cossy, _Arch.de
Med._, Nov., 1879; Tillmanns, _Arch.[Footnote 57: Schreiber has shown that this last diagnostic point,
which was given by Leyden, is not without exceptions, for the pressure
in the peritoneal cavity may sink during inspiration and rise during
expiration (as in the pleural cavity), especially when the diaphragm
takes little or no part in respiration ("Ueber Pleural- und
Peritonealdruck," _Deutsches Arch.Med._, July 31, 1883).]Through the medium of subphrenic abscess, or directly through adhesions
between the stomach and the diaphragm, gastric ulcer may perforate into
one of the pleural cavities (generally the left) and cause empyema or
pneumo-pyothorax.Adhesions may form between the diaphragm and the
pulmonary pleura, so that the ulcer perforates directly into the lung;
in which case pulmonary gangrene or pulmonary abscess is usually
developed.The diagnosis of the perforation into the lung has been made
by recognizing a sour odor and sour reaction of the expectoration, and
by finding in the sputum particles of food derived from the stomach.Sudden death from suffocation has followed perforation of the stomach
into the lung.[58]

[Footnote 58: Tillmanns (_loc.cit._) has collected 12 cases of
communication between the stomach and the thoracic cavity from
perforation of gastric ulcer; all proved fatal.In Sturges's case of
recovery from pneumothorax supposed to be produced by perforation of a
gastric ulcer the diagnosis of the cause of the pneumothorax was very
doubtful (_The Lancet_, Feb.Perforation of gastric ulcer into the transverse colon has been
followed by the vomiting of formed feces and by the passage of
undigested food by the bowel (Abercrombie).Enemata may be vomited, so
that, as suggested by Murchison, the introduction of  enemata
may aid in the diagnosis.Gastro-cutaneous fistulae are among the rare results of perforation of
gastric ulcer.In these cases food, sometimes only in liquid form,
escapes through the fistula.The opening of gastric ulcer into the pericardium is one of the rare
causes of pneumo-pericardium.Other varieties of perforation which are of pathological rather than of
clinical interest will be mentioned under the morbid anatomy of gastric
ulcer.COURSE.--Few diseases are more variable in their course and duration
than is simple gastric ulcer.It is customary to distinguish between
acute and chronic forms of gastric ulcer, but this is a distinction
which cannot be sharply drawn.Those cases are called acute in which,
with absence or short duration of antecedent gastric symptoms,
perforation or gastrorrhagia suddenly causes death.But in some of
these cases the thickened and indurated margins of the ulcer found at
the autopsy show that the disease has been of much longer duration than
the clinical history would indicate.Still, there is reason to believe
that within the course of a few days ulcers may form and perforate all
of the coats of the stomach.In the great majority of cases of gastric ulcer the tendency is to
assume a chronic course, so that the often-used term chronic gastric
ulcer is generally applicable.{501} The great diversity of the symptoms in different cases makes it
impossible to give a generally applicable description of the course of
gastric ulcer.It is, however, useful to designate the main clinical
forms of the disease.Latent ulcers, with entire absence of symptoms, and revealed as open
ulcers or as cicatrices at the autopsy.With or without a period of brief gastric
disturbance perforation occurs and causes speedy death.Acute hemorrhagic form of gastric ulcer.After a latent or a brief
course of the ulcer profuse gastrorrhagia occurs, which may terminate
fatally or may be followed by the symptoms of chronic ulcer.Gastralgic-dyspeptic form.In this, which is the most common form of
gastric ulcer gastralgia, dyspepsia and vomiting are the symptoms.Sometimes one of the symptoms predominates greatly over the others, so
that Lebert distinguishes separately a gastralgic, a dyspeptic, and a
vomitive variety.Gastralgia is the most frequent symptom.Gastrorrhagia is a marked symptom, and
occurs usually in combination with the symptoms just mentioned.This usually corresponds only to the final stage of
one of the preceding forms, but the cachexia may develop so rapidly and
become so marked that the course of the disease closely resembles that
of gastric cancer.In this the symptoms of gastric ulcer disappear, and
then follow intervals, often of considerable duration, in which there
is apparent cure, but the symptoms return, especially after some
indiscretion in the mode of living.This intermittent course may
continue for many years.In these cases it is probable either that
fresh ulcers form or that the cicatrix of an old ulcer becomes
ulcerated.By the formation of cicatricial tissue in and around
the ulcer the pyloric orifice becomes obstructed and the symptoms of
dilatation of the stomach develop.DURATION.--The average duration of gastric ulcer may be said to be from
three to five years, but this estimate is not of great value, on
account of the absence of any regularity in the course and duration of
the disease.In cases of very protracted duration, such as forty years
in a case of Habershon's and thirty-five in one of Brinton's, it is
uncertain whether the symptoms are referable to the persistence of one
ulcer or to the formation of new ulcers, or to sequels resulting from
cicatrization.In 110 cases (44 fatal) analyzed by Lebert[59] the course was latent
until the occurrence of perforation or of profuse hemorrhage in 15 per
cent., the duration was less than one year in 18 per cent., from one to
six years in 46-1/2 per cent., from six to twenty years in 18 per
cent., from twenty to thirty-five years in 2-1/2 per cent.TERMINATIONS.--In the majority of cases gastric ulcer terminates in
recovery.Various gastric disturbances
may, however, follow the cicatrization of gastric ulcer, especially if
the ulcer was large and of long duration.These sequential disturbances
are due to the contraction of the cicatrix, to adhesions between the
stomach and surrounding parts, to deformity of the stomach, and
especially to dilatation of the stomach by cicatricial stenosis of the
pylorus.Hence, {502} gastralgia, dyspepsia, and vomiting may continue
after the ulcer has healed, so that anatomical cure of the ulcer is not
always recovery in the clinical sense.Relapses may occur after
recovery, as those who have once had gastric ulcer are more prone to
the disease than are others.Not infrequently the patient recovers so
far as to be able to attend to the active duties of life, but to avoid
renewed attacks he is always obliged to be very careful as regards his
mode of living.How often gastric ulcer ends in death it is impossible to say.It is
certain that Brinton under-estimates the number of recoveries when he
computes that only one-half of the ulcers cicatrize.Lebert reckons the
mortality from gastric ulcer as 10 per cent., which appears to be too
low an estimate.would be a more correct estimate
of the mortality.The causes of death are perforation, hemorrhage, exhaustion, and
complicating diseases.of the cases of gastric ulcer terminate fatally
by perforation into the peritoneal cavity.Although this estimate can
be considered only approximative, there is little doubt but that the
much larger percentages given by most writers are excessive, and are
referable to the undue frequency with which cases of perforation of
gastric ulcer have been published.Such cases naturally make a strong
impression upon the observer, and are more likely to be published than
those which terminate in other ways.Death from hemorrhage occurs probably in from 3 to 5 per cent.of the
cases of gastric ulcer.[60] In many more cases hemorrhage is an
indirect cause of death by inducing anaemia.Unlike perforation, fatal
hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is more common in males than in
females--more common after than before forty years of age.The average
age at which fatal hemorrhage occurs is given by Brinton as forty-three
and a half years both for males and females.[Footnote 60: In 270 fatal cases of open ulcer from the statistics of
Jaksch, Dittrich, Eppinger, Starcke, Chambers, Habershon, Moore, and
Lebert, I find 27 deaths by hemorrhage.Reckoning three cicatrices to
one ulcer, this would give a percentage of 3-1/3.]In a considerable proportion of the fatal cases exhaustion is the cause
of death.According to Lebert, death from exhaustion occurs in about 4
per cent.The causes of exhaustion are
the pain, hemorrhage, dyspepsia, and vomiting which constitute the
leading symptoms of the disease.Finally, death may be due to some of the complications or sequels of
gastric ulcer.COMPLICATIONS.--Some of the complications of gastric ulcer are directly
referable to the ulcer, others are only remotely related to it, and
others are merely accidental.Pylephlebitis is among the most important of the complications directly
referable to the ulcer.This pylephlebitis is usually of the infectious
variety, and leads to abscesses in the liver, sometimes to abscesses in
the spleen and other organs.As has already been mentioned, chronic catarrhal gastritis stands in
close relationship to gastric ulcer.Chronic peritonitis is a rare
complication of gastric ulcer (Moore, Vierordt).Chronic interstitial
gastritis, with contraction of the stomach and thickening of its walls,
was {503} associated with ulcer in a case under my observation.In a
case of ulcer under the care of Owen Rees[61] this condition of the
stomach was associated with chronic deforming peritonitis (thickening,
induration, and contraction of the peritoneum) and ascites, so that the
symptoms during life and the gross appearances after death resembled
cancerous diseases of the peritoneum.Simple ulcer and cancer may occur
together in the same stomach, or cancer may develop in an ulcer or its
cicatrix.Glasser reports a case of phlegmonous gastritis with gastric
ulcer.[62] Extension of inflammation to the pleura without perforation
of the diaphragm sometimes occurs.Fatty degeneration of the heart may
be the result of profound anaemia induced by gastric ulcer.[63] Embolic
pneumonia and broncho-pneumonia are occasional complications.A
moderate degree of cachectic dropsy is not very infrequent in the late
stages of gastric ulcer.Times and Gaz._, April 24, 1869.]Wochenschrift_, 1883, No.[Footnote 63: Shattuck, _Boston Med.Journ._, June, 1880,
vol.Other complications, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, valvular disease
of the heart, general atheroma of the arteries, cirrhosis of the liver,
syphilis, chronic Bright's disease, waxy degenerations, and malaria,
have been considered under the Etiology, and some of them will be
referred to again in connection with the Pathology, of gastric ulcer.In most instances when ulcer is associated with these diseases the
ulcer is secondary.SEQUELAE.--The most important sequelae of gastric ulcer are changes in
the form of the stomach in consequence of adhesions and in consequence
of the formation and contraction of cicatrices.These lesions are most
conveniently described under the Morbid Anatomy.The symptoms of the
most important of these sequels--namely, stenosis of the pylorus with
dilatation of the stomach--will be described in another article.MORBID ANATOMY.--As regards number, simple ulcer of the stomach is
usually single, but occasionally two or more ulcers are present.It is
not uncommon to meet in the same stomach open ulcers and the scars of
healed ulcers.According to Brinton, multiple ulcers are found in about
one-fifth of the cases.In one case O'Rorke found six ulcers on the
anterior wall of the stomach.[64] Berthold mentions a case in which
thirty-four ulcers were found in the same stomach.[65]

[Footnote 64: _Trans.Wollmann mentions the occurrence of over eight simple ulcers in the
same stomach (_Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresb._, 1868, Bd.It is expressly stated that these were
not hemorrhagic erosions, but deep corrosive ulcers.]The usual position of simple gastric ulcer is the posterior wall of the
pyloric portion of the stomach on or near the lesser curvature.Ulcers
of the anterior wall are rare, but they carry a special danger from
their liability to perforate without protective adhesions.The least
frequent seats of ulcer are the greater curvature and the fundus.The table on page 504 gives the situation of 793 ulcers recorded in
hospital statistics:[66] {504}

  Lesser curvature   288 (36.3 per cent.)Posterior wall     235 (29.6    "     )
  Pylorus             95 (12      "     )
  Anterior wall       69 ( 8.7    "     )
  Cardia              50 ( 6.3    "     )
  Fundus              29 ( 3.7    "     )
  Greater curvature   27 ( 3.4    "     )

From this table it is apparent that ulcers occupy the lesser curvature,
the posterior wall, and the pyloric region three and a half times more
frequently than they do the remaining larger segment of the stomach.[Footnote 66: These statistics are collected from the previously-cited
works of Rokitansky, Jaksch, Wrany, Eppinger, Chambers, Habershon,
Steiner, Wollmann, Berthold, Starcke, Lebert, and Moore.So far as noted, most of the ulcers on the posterior wall
were nearer to the lesser curvature than to the greater; those on the
lesser curvature extended more frequently to the posterior than to the
anterior wall.Although not apparent from the table, most of the ulcers
of the lesser curvature and of the posterior wall were in the pyloric
region.So far as possible, cicatrices were excluded.Pylorus and
cardia in the table indicate on or near those parts.]Occasionally two ulcers are seated directly opposite to each other, the
one on the anterior, the other on the posterior, wall of the stomach.The most plausible explanation of this is that the ulcers are caused by
a simultaneous affection of corresponding branches which are given off
symmetrically from the same arterial trunk as it runs along one of the
curvatures of the stomach (Virchow).[67]

[Footnote 67: A. Beer, "Aus dem path.R.
Virchow, etc.," _Wiener med.The ordinary size of the ulcer varies from a half inch to two inches in
diameter.The ulcer may be very minute, as in two cases reported by
Murchison, in each of which a pore-like hole was found leading into a
perforated artery from which fatal hemorrhage had occurred.[68] On the
other hand, the ulcer may attain an enormous size, extending sometimes
from the cardiac to the pyloric orifice and measuring five or six
inches in diameter.[69]

[Footnote 68: Murchison, _Trans.[Footnote 69: In one of Cruveilhier's cases the ulcer was 6-1/2 inches
long and 3-1/3 inches wide.Law describes an ulcer measuring 6 inches
by 3 inches (_Dublin Hosp.The ulcer is usually round or oval in shape.The outline of the ulcer
may become irregular by unequal extension in the periphery, or by the
coalescence of two or more ulcers, or by partial cicatrization.Simple
ulcers, especially when seated near the lesser curvature, have a
tendency to extend transversely to the long axis of the stomach, thus
following the course of the blood-vessels.By this mode of extension,
or more frequently by the coalescence of several ulcers, are formed
girdle ulcers, which more or less completely surround the circumference
of the stomach, oftener in the pyloric region than elsewhere.As the ulcer extends in depth it often destroys each successive layer
of the stomach in less extent than the preceding one, so that the form
of the ulcer is conical or funnel-shaped, with a terrace-like
appearance in its sloping edges.The apex of the truncated cone, which
is directed toward the peritoneum, is often not directly opposite to
the centre of the base or superior surface which occupies the mucous
membrane, so that one side of the cone may be vertical and the other
sloping.In the half of the stomach nearer the lesser curvature the
cone <DW72>s upward, and in the lower half of the stomach it <DW72>s
downward.The usual explanation of its conical shape is that the ulcer
exactly corresponds to the territory supplied by an artery with its
branches.Virchow finds an explanation for the oblique direction of the
funnel in the arrangement of the arteries of the stomach.These, coming
from different sources, run along the curvatures of the stomach, and
there give off symmetrically branches which run obliquely toward the
mucous membrane, so that one of these {505} branches with its
distributive twigs (arterial tree) would supply a part shaped like an
oblique funnel.One of the chief supports of the theory which refers
the origin of simple gastric ulcer to an arrest of the circulation is
this correspondence in shape of the ulcer to the area of distribution
of the branches of the arteries supplying the stomach.All ulcers do not present the conical form and terraced edges which
have been described.These appearances are far from constant in fresh
ulcers, and they are usually absent in those of long duration.The most characteristic anatomical feature of simple ulcer of the
stomach is the appearance of the edges and of the floor of the ulcer.The edges of recently-formed ulcers (acute ulcers) are clean-cut,
smooth, and not swollen.To use Rokitansky's well-known comparison, the
hole in the mucous coat looks as if it had been punched out by an
instrument.The floor of the ulcer may be smooth and firm or soft and
pulpy.The floor and edges of fresh ulcers are often infiltrated with
blood, but they may be of a pale-grayish color.Usually no granulations
and no pus are to be seen on the surface of the ulcer.[70] In ulcers of
longer duration the margins become thickened, indurated, and abrupt;
the floor acquires a dense fibrous structure.[Footnote 70: In rare instances granulations may be present, as in a
case of W. Muller's, in which their presence rendered difficult the
diagnosis of simple ulcer from carcinoma (_Jenaische Zeitschrift_, v.,
1870).The microscope may also be required to distinguish the
irregularly thickened margins of old ulcers from scirrhous cancer.]The floor of the ulcer may be the submucous, the muscular, or the
serous coat, or, if the whole thickness of the stomach be perforated,
it may be some adjacent organ to which the stomach has become adherent,
this organ being usually the pancreas or the left lobe of the liver or
neighboring lymphatic glands.The microscopic examination of recently-formed ulcers shows that the
tissue immediately surrounding the ulcer is composed of granular
material, disintegrated red blood-corpuscles, pale and swollen
fragments of connective-tissue fibres, and cells unaffected by
nuclear-staining dyes.The red blood-corpuscles are sometimes broken
into fragments of various sizes in about the same way as by the action
of heat.The gastric tubules are separated from each other and
compressed by infiltrated blood, and contain cells which do not stain.Around this margin of molecular disintegration, which has evidently
been produced by the action of the gastric juice, there is often,
although not constantly, a zone of infiltration with small round cells,
probably emigrated white blood-corpuscles.These cells are most
abundant near the muscularis mucosae and in the submucosa.Extravasated
red blood-corpuscles extend a variable distance around the ulcer,
farthest as a rule in the submucous coat.Many of the blood-vessels in
the immediate neighborhood of the ulcer appear normal; others,
particularly the arterioles and the capillaries, may be filled with
hyaline thrombi.Clumps of hyaline material may also be seen in the
meshes of the tissue around the ulcer.Fine fatty granules may be seen
in the tissue near the ulcer.The interstices of the loose submucous
tissue and the lymphatic vessels are often filled with fibrillated
fibrin and scattered blood-corpuscles for a considerable distance
around the ulcer.In the margins of old gastric ulcers there is also a zone of molecular
necrosis.The induration and the thickening of the edges of these
ulcers {506} are caused by a new growth of fibrillated connective
tissue, which blends together all of the coats invaded by the ulcer.This new tissue is usually rich in lymphoid cells, which are often most
abundant in the lymphatic channels.In the fibrous edges and base of
old ulcers are arteries which are the seat of an obliterating
endarteritis, and which may be completely obliterated by this process.An interstitial neuritis may affect the nerve-trunks involved in the
fibrous growth.Blood-pigment may be present as an evidence of an old
hemorrhagic infiltration.[71]

[Footnote 71: The histological changes here described are based upon
the examination of typical specimens both of recent and of old gastric
ulcers which have come under my observation.]Cicatrization is accomplished by the development of fibrous tissue in
the floor and borders of the ulcer.By the contraction of this
new-formed tissue the edges of the mucous membrane are united to the
floor of the ulcer, and may be drawn together so as to close completely
the defect in the mucous membrane.The result is a white stellate
cicatrix, which is usually somewhat depressed and surrounded by
puckered mucous membrane.It is probable that small, superficial ulcers
may be closed so that the scar cannot be detected.The mucous membrane
which has been drawn over the cicatrix is intimately blended with the
fibrous substratum, and is usually itself invaded by fibrous tissue
which compresses and distorts the gastric tubules.Hauser[72] has shown
that the tubular glands grow down into the cicatricial tissue, where
they may branch in all directions.These new-formed tubules are lined
by clear cylindrical or cutical epithelial cells, and may undergo
cystic dilatation.Very irregular cicatrices may result from the
healing of large and irregular ulcers.When the ulcer is large and deep
and the stomach is adherent to surrounding parts, the edges of the
mucous membrane making the border of the ulcer cannot be united by the
contraction of the fibrous tissue in the floor of the ulcer.The
cicatrix of such ulcers consists of fibrous tissue uncovered by mucous
membrane.Such cicatrices are
liable to be the seat of renewed ulceration.[Footnote 72: _Das chronische Magengeschwur, etc._, Leipzig, 1883.In
the rare instances of carcinoma developing in the borders or in the
cicatrix of gastric ulcer, Hauser believes that the cancerous growth
starts from these glandular growths, which in general have only the
significance of Friedlander's atypical proliferation of epithelial
cells.]The formation and contraction of the cicatrix may cause various
deformities of the stomach.The character of these deformities depends
upon the situation, the size, and the depth of the ulcer which is
cicatrized.Among the most important of these distortions are stenosis
of the pyloric orifice, followed by dilatation of the stomach, more
rarely stenosis of the cardiac orifice, with contraction of the
stomach, approximation of the cardiac and of the pyloric orifices by
the healing of ulcers on the lesser curvature, and an hour-glass form
of the stomach, produced by the cicatrization of girdle ulcers or of a
series of ulcers extending around the stomach.These abnormalities in
form of the stomach, particularly the constriction of the orifices, may
be attended by more serious symptoms than the original ulcer.As the ulcer extends in depth a circumscribed peritonitis, resulting in
the formation of adhesions between the stomach and surrounding parts,
is usually excited before the serous coat is perforated, so that the
gravest of all possible accidents in the course of gastric
ulcer--namely, perforation {507} into the peritoneal sac--is
permanently or temporarily averted.It has been estimated that
adhesions form in about two-fifths of all cases of gastric ulcer
(Jaksch).On account of the usual position of the ulcer on the lesser
curvature or on the posterior wall of the stomach, the adhesions are
most frequently with the pancreas (in about one-half of all cases of
adhesion); next in frequency with the left lobe of the liver; rarely
with other parts, such as the lymphatic glands, the diaphragm, the
spleen, the kidney, the suprarenal capsule, the omentum, the colon, and
other parts of the intestine, the gall-bladder, the sternum, and the
anterior abdominal wall.Adhesions cannot readily form between the
anterior surface of the stomach and the anterior abdominal wall, on
account of the constant movement of these parts, so that ulcers of the
anterior gastric wall are those most liable to perforate into the
peritoneal cavity.It is difficult to include in any description all of the various and
complicated lesions which may result from perforation by gastric ulcer
of all of the coats of the stomach.The consequences of perforation may
be conveniently classified as follows:

1.Some solid organ, usually the pancreas, the liver, or the lymphatic
glands, may close the hole in the stomach.An intra-peritoneal sac shut in by adhesions may communicate through
the ulcer with the cavity of the stomach.A fistulous communication may form either between the stomach and
the exterior (external gastric fistula) or between the stomach and some
hollow viscus (internal gastric fistula).The ulcer may perforate into the general peritoneal cavity.These lesions may be variously combined with each other.It is to be
noted that in the first three varieties protective adhesions are
present, and that in the last these adhesions are either absent or
ruptured.When the pancreas, the liver, or the spleen form the floor of the
ulcer, they may be protected from extension of the ulcerative process
by a new growth of fibrous tissue extending from the floor of the ulcer
a variable depth into these organs.Sometimes, however, the ulcerative
process, aided doubtless by the corroding action of the gastric juice,
eats out large excavations in these organs.These excavations
communicate with the cavity of the stomach, and are usually filled with
ichorous pus.The pancreas, unlike the spleen and the liver, possesses
comparative immunity against this invasion by the ulcerative process.The situation, the form, and the extent of circumscribed peritoneal
abscesses resulting from perforation of gastric ulcer depend upon the
parts with which the stomach has contracted adhesions.Should an ulcer
on the posterior wall of the stomach perforate before the formation of
adhesions, the perforation would of course be directly into the lesser
peritoneal cavity.An interesting example of this rare occurrence has
been communicated by Chiari.[73] In this case, the foramen of Winslow
being closed by adhesions, the lesser peritoneal cavity which
communicated with a gastric ulcer was filled with ichorous pus, and in
this floated the pancreas, which had necrosed in mass and had separated
as a sequestrum.That form of intra-peritoneal abscess known as
subphrenic pneumo-pyothorax has been already described under
Symptomatology.Peritoneal abscesses communicating with the stomach may
open into various places, {508} as into the general peritoneal cavity,
into the pleural cavity, into the retro-peritoneal tissue, through the
abdominal or thoracic walls, etc.Wochenschr._, 1876, No.Gastro-cutaneous fistulae are a rare result of the perforation of
gastric ulcer.[74] The external opening is most frequently in the
umbilical region, but it may be in the epigastric or in the left
hypochondriac region or between the ribs.Fistulous communications
resulting from the perforation of gastric ulcer have been formed
between the stomach and one or more of the following hollow viscera or
cavities: the colon, the duodenum and other parts of the small
intestine, the gall-bladder, the common bile-duct, the pancreatic duct,
the pleura, the lung, the left bronchus, the pericardium, and the left
ventricle.Gastro-colic fistulae, in contrast to gastro-cutaneous
fistulae, are more frequently produced by cancer than by ulcer of the
stomach.[75] In rare instances the peritoneum over ulcers of the lesser
curvature has contracted adhesions with the pyloric portion of the
stomach or with the first part of the duodenum.To accomplish this it
is necessary that a sharp bend in the lesser curvature should take
place.By extension of the ulcerative process abnormal communication is
established between the left and the right half of the stomach or
between the stomach and the duodenum.In either case the right half of
the stomach is often converted into a large blind diverticulum, the
digested food passing through the abnormal opening.[76] Gastro-duodenal
fistulae are more frequently with the third than with the first part of

the colon and through the medium of a subphrenic abscess with the left
lung.[77]

[Footnote 74: Of the 25 cases of gastro-cutaneous fistula collected by
Murchison, 18 were the result of disease.In 12 of these cases the
probable cause was simple gastric ulcer (_Med.-Chir.Middeldorpf says that among the internal causes
of the 47 cases of external gastric fistula which he tabulated, simple
ulcer of the stomach played an important role (_Wiener med.Wochenschr._, 1860).][Footnote 75: Of 33 cases of gastro-colic fistula collected by

with the production of pneumo-pericardium, have been reported, and two
cases of perforation into the left ventricle.[79] Muller found
lumbricoid worms in a pleural cavity which had been perforated by
gastric ulcer.[80] Diaphragmatic hernia may result from perforation of
the pleural cavity by gastric ulcer.[81] In one instance the greater
part of the small intestines {509} passed through a hole in the
transverse meso-colon which had been caused by a gastric ulcer.[Footnote 78: Hallin, _Schmidt's Jahrb._, cxix.37; Saxinger,

Gunsburg's the hole in the diaphragm was as large as the hand, and the
left pleural cavity contained the upper half of the stomach and the
spleen (_Arch.The various fistulae which have been mentioned may be either direct or
through the medium of an abscess.While some of them are only
pathological curiosities, others, particularly the communications of
the stomach with the pleural cavity and with the lung, are sufficiently
frequent to be of practical clinical interest.As has already been explained, ulcers of the anterior wall are the ones
most liable to perforate into the general peritoneal cavity,[82] but on
account of their comparative infrequency perforation occurs oftener in
other situations, particularly in the lesser curvature and near the
pylorus.Except on the anterior wall the perforation is often brought
about by the rupture of adhesions which for a time had prevented this
accident.In a considerable number of cases, particularly of ulcers on
the anterior wall, the ulcer looks as if recently formed (acute
perforating ulcer); in other cases its thickened and indurated margins
indicate long duration.Chiari[83] describes a case in which rupture
into the peritoneal cavity took place through the cicatrix of an old
ulcer, probably in consequence of the distension of the stomach with
gas.The hole in the peritoneum is usually circular, smaller than the
inner surface of the ulcer, and has sharp, well-defined edges.Less
frequently the edges are ragged.Post-mortem digestion may, however, so
change the borders of the opening as to make it difficult or impossible
to tell from their post-mortem appearances alone whether perforation
has occurred before or after death.The peritoneal cavity after death
from perforation is found to contain gas and substances from the
stomach.Usually within a few hours after perforation septic
peritonitis is excited, but in exceptional cases no inflammation of the
peritoneum has occurred even when life has been prolonged twenty-four
hours after perforation.[Footnote 82: According to Brinton, "the proportion of perforations to
ulcers is such that of every 100 ulcers in each of the following
situations, the numbers which perforate are--on the posterior surface,
about 2; the pyloric sac, 10; the middle of the organ, 13; the lesser
curvature, 18; the anterior and posterior surface at once, 28; the
cardiac extremity, 40; and the anterior surface, 85."]Emphysema of the subcutaneous, subperitoneal, and other loose areolar
tissue of the body is a rare but remarkable result of the perforation
of gastric ulcer.The emphysema is sometimes observed shortly before
death, but it attains its maximum development after death, when it may
spread rapidly over the greater part of the body.The gas consists in
part of hydrogen, as it burns with a blue flame.It is generated, at
least in great part, by fermentation of the contents of the stomach.The gas may enter the subserous tissue at the edges of the ulcer and
thence spread, or, after perforation of the stomach, it may make its
way from the peritoneal cavity into the loose subserous connective
tissue through some place in the parietal peritoneum which has been
macerated, perhaps by the digestive action of the gastric juice.[84]

[Footnote 84: Roger (_Arch.de Med._, 1862) and Demarquay (_Essai
de Pneumatologie medicale_, Paris, 1866) deserve the credit of first
calling general attention to the occurrence of subcutaneous emphysema
after rupture of the digestive tract.The following writers have each
reported a case of emphysema following the perforation of gastric
ulcers: Cruveilhier, _Anat.Path._, t. i. livr.783; Thierfelder, _Deutsches Arch.Med._,
iv., 1868, p.33; Newman, _The Lancet_, 1868, vol.728;
Poensgen, _Das subcutane Emphysem nach continuitatstrennungen des
Digestionstractus, etc._, Inaug.Diss., Strassburg, 1879, p.40;
Korach, _Deutsche med.Wochenschr._, 1880 p.275; {510} Jurgensen,
_Deutsches Arch.Doubtful cases
are reported by Lefevre, W. Mayer, and Burggraeve.The fullest
consideration of the subject is to be found in the dissertation of
Poensgen.]In two cases of sudden death from gastric ulcer Jurgensen found gas in
the veins and arteries of various parts of the body.He believes that
this gas, which certainly was not the result of putrefaction after
death, was derived from the stomach, and that it entered during life
the circulation through vessels exposed in the borders of the ulcer,
thus causing death.In one of the cases a profuse hemorrhage preceded
death, and in the other the ulcer had perforated into the peritoneal
cavity.[85]

[Footnote 85: Jurgensen does not consider whether this gas may not have
made its way into the blood-vessels after death in a manner similar to
its extension through the cellular tissue of the body in the cases of
emphysema just mentioned.In the case which he has reported in full
interstitial and subserous emphysema could be traced from the ulcer
("Luft im Blute," _Deutsches Arch.The source of hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is from blood-vessels
either in the stomach itself or in the neighborhood of the stomach.Hemorrhages slight or of moderate severity occur from the capillaries
and small arteries and veins in the mucous and submucous coats.Sometimes profuse and even fatal hemorrhage comes from arteries or from
veins in the submucous coat, especially when these vessels are dilated.Quickly-fatal hemorrhages take place from the large vessels between the
muscular and the serous coats, particularly from the main trunks on the
curvatures.After the formation of adhesions, followed by the
perforation of all of the coats of the stomach, profuse bleeding may
proceed from the erosion of large vessels near the stomach, such as the
splenic, the hepatic, the pancreatico-duodenal arteries, the portal and
the splenic veins, and the mesenteric vessels.Bleeding may also occur
from vessels in the parenchyma of organs invaded by the ulcer.The most
common source of fatal hemorrhage is from the splenic artery, which
from its position is peculiarly exposed to invasion by ulcers of the
posterior wall of the stomach.The hemorrhage is usually arterial in
origin.It may come from miliary aneurisms of the gastric arteries or
from varicose veins in the wall of the stomach.As Cruveilhier has
pointed out, an ulcer may cicatrize except over one spot corresponding
to an artery from which fatal hemorrhage may occur.Ulcers which give
rise to large hemorrhages are usually chronic in their course.Those
seated on the middle of the anterior wall, although peculiarly liable
to perforate, are comparatively exempt from hemorrhage on account of
the small size of the blood-vessels there.Changes in the blood-vessels of the stomach have been seen in a
considerable number of cases of gastric ulcer.Instances have been
recorded of the association with gastric ulcer of most of the diseases
to which blood-vessels are subject.An example in all respects
convincing of embolism of the artery supplying the ulcerated region of
the stomach has not been published.Probably the best case belonging
here is one of perforating ulcer of the stomach with hemorrhagic
infiltration in its walls, presented by Janeway to the New York
Pathological Society in 1871.[86] In this case there was in the
gastro-epiploic artery an ante-mortem fibrinous plug which was
continued into the nutrient artery of the ulcerated piece of the
stomach.No source for an embolus could be found.In one case Merkel
found an embolus in a small artery leading to an ulcer {511} of the
duodenum.[87] The arch of the aorta was atheromatous and contained a
thrombus.Patches of hemorrhagic infiltration existed in the stomach.In many cases thrombosis of the arteries, and especially of the veins
involved in the diseased tissue around an ulcer, has been observed, and
in some the thrombus was prolonged in the vessels for a considerable
distance from the ulcer.It is probable that in most of these cases the
thrombus was secondary to the ulcer.Hyaline thrombosis of the
capillaries near the ulcer is also to be mentioned.In a certain, but not large, number of cases atheroma with
calcification or with fatty degeneration of the arteries of the stomach
has been found associated with gastric ulcer.[88] Reference has already
been made to the occurrence of obliterating endarteritis in the
thickened edges and floor of gastric ulcer, where it is doubtless
secondary.In one case of gastric ulcer I found a widespread
obliterating endarteritis affecting small and medium-sized arteries in
many parts of the body, including the stomach.[89]

[Footnote 88: For cases in point see Norman Moore, _Trans.[Footnote 89: On the posterior wall of the stomach, midway between the
greater and the lesser curvature and five inches to the right of the
cardiac orifice, was a round ulcer half an inch in diameter, with
smooth, sharp edges.In the floor of the ulcer, which extended to the
muscular coat, was a small perforated aneurism of a branch of the
coronary artery.In addition there were small, granular kidneys,
hypertrophied heart without valvular lesion, and chronic interstitial
splenitis.Small and medium-sized arteries in the kidneys, spleen,
heart, lymphatic glands, and stomach were the seat of a typical
endarteritis obliterans, resulting in some instances in complete
closure of the lumen of the vessel.The patient, who was attended by
Sassdorf, was seized during the night with vomiting of blood, which
continued at intervals for twenty-four hours until his death.The
patient was a man about fifty years of age, without previous history of
gastric ulcer or of syphilis.]In one case Powell[90] found a small aneurism of the coronary artery in
an ulcer of the lesser curvature of the stomach.Hauser[91] found an
aneurismal dilatation of an atheromatous and thrombosed arterial twig
in the floor of a recent ulcer.In my case of obliterating endarteritis
just referred to there was a small aneurism in the floor of the ulcer.These miliary aneurisms in the floor of gastric ulcers seem to be
analogous to those in the walls of phthisical cavities.Miliary
aneurisms occur in the stomach independently of gastric ulcer, and may
give rise to fatal haematemesis, as in four cases reported by
Galliard.[92]

[Footnote 90: _Trans.[Footnote 91: _Das chronische Magengeschwur, etc._, p.11, Leipzig,
1883.][Footnote 92: _L'Union med._, Feb.Curtis reported a case of
fatal haematemesis from an aneurism, not larger than a small pea,
seated in the cicatrix of an old ulcer (_Med.Annals of Albany_, Aug.,
1880).]Gastric ulcer is occasionally associated with waxy degeneration of the
arteries of the stomach.[93] In most of these cases there were multiple
shallow ulcers.Haematemesis is generally absent in gastric ulcer
resulting from waxy disease of the gastric blood-vessels.As is well
known, the amyloid material itself resists the action of the gastric
juice.cit._) alludes to a case in which, with waxy
degeneration of the stomach, over one hundred small ulcers were found
in different stages of development, from hemorrhagic infiltrations to
complete ulcers.Cases belonging here are reported by Fehr, _Ueber die
Amyloide Degeneration_, Inaug.Diss., Bern, 1866; Merkel, _Wiener med.Presse_, 1869; Edinger, _Deutsches Arch.568; Marchiafava, _Atti del Accad.114; and
Mattei, _Deutsche med.Zeitung_, July 5, 1883.]Finally, varicosities of the veins of the stomach have been once in a
{512} while found with gastric ulcer.In a large number, probably in
the majority, of cases of gastric ulcer no changes have been found in
the blood-vessels of the stomach except such as were manifestly
secondary to the ulcer.That gastric ulcer is frequently complicated with chronic catarrhal
gastritis has been repeatedly mentioned in the course of this article.PATHOGENESIS.--Without doubt, the most obscure chapter in the history
of gastric ulcer is that relating to its origin and to its persistence.Notwithstanding a vast amount of investigation and of discussion,
unanimity of opinion upon these subjects has not been reached.In view
of this uncertainty it is desirable in this article to do little more
than to summarize the leading theories as to the development of gastric
ulcer.Most observers are agreed that the digestive action of the gastric
juice has some share in the development and the progress of the ulcer,
but as to the first cause of the ulcer there are various hypotheses.The earliest theory refers the origin of simple ulcer of the stomach to
inflammation.Since its advocacy by Abercrombie and by Cruveilhier this
theory has always had its adherents, particularly among French writers.It is true that in stomachs which are the seat of simple ulcer
evidences of inflammation can often be found both in the neighborhood
of the ulcer and elsewhere.In recent times the supporters of the
inflammatory origin of gastric ulcer lay especial stress upon the
presence of foci of infiltration with small round cells in the mucous
and the submucous coats.[94] But it is difficult to explain by the
inflammatory theory the usually solitary occurrence and the funnel-like
shape of gastric ulcer.[Footnote 94: Laveran, _Arch.443;
Galliard, _Essai sur la Pathogenie de l'Ulcere simple de l'Estomac_,
These de Paris, 1882; Colombo, _Annali univ.The theory that gastric ulcer is of neurotic origin has also been
advocated.Some refer the origin to the secretion of an excessively
acid gastric juice under abnormal nervous influence (Gunsburg), others
to vaso-motor disturbances, and others to trophic disturbances.Wilks
and Moxon compare simple gastric ulcer to ulcers of the cornea
resulting from paralysis of the trigeminus.The neurotic theory of the
origin of gastric ulcer is altogether speculative and has never gained
wide acceptance.[95]

[Footnote 95: The first to attribute gastric ulcer to nervous influence
was Siebert (_Casper's Wochenschr.f. d. Heilk._, 1842, No.29, and
_Deutsche Klinik_, 1852).Heilk._,
xi., 1852; Wilks and Moxon, _Lect.Anat._, 2d ed., Philada.,
1875, p.Osborne in 1845 attributed gastric ulcer to the secretion
of an abnormally acid juice by a circular group of the gastric glands
(_Dublin Journ.The view which has met with the greatest favor is that which attributes
the origin of gastric ulcer to impairment or arrest of the circulation
in a circumscribed part of the wall of the stomach, and to a subsequent
solution by the gastric juice of the part thus affected.Rokitansky
first suggested this view by assigning hemorrhagic necrosis of the
mucous membrane as the first step in the formation of the ulcer; but it
is Virchow who has most fully developed this view and has given it its
main support.The first cause of gastric ulcer, according to Virchow,
is a hemorrhagic infiltration of the coats of the stomach induced by
local disturbances in the circulation.The part the nutrition of which
is thus impaired or destroyed is dissolved by the gastric juice.{513} The affections of the gastric blood-vessels to which importance
has been attached are (_a_) embolism and thrombosis; (_b_) diseases of
the coats of the vessels, as atheroma, obliterating endarteritis, fatty
degeneration, amyloid degeneration, and aneurismal and varicose
dilatations; (_c_) compression of the veins by spasm of the muscular
coats of the stomach in vomiting and in gastralgia; (_d_) passive
congestion of the stomach by obstruction in the portal circulation.In support of this view are urged the following facts: First, it has
been proven by the experiments of Pavy that parts of the gastric wall
from which the circulation has been shut off undergo digestion; second,
hemorrhagic infarctions have been observed in the stomach, both alone
(Von Recklinghausen, Hedenius) and associated with gastric ulcer (Key,
Rindfleisch); third, the hemorrhagic infiltration in the walls of
recently-formed ulcers indicates a hemorrhagic origin; fourth, the
funnel-like shape of the ulcer resembles the funnel-shaped area of
distribution of an artery; fifth, gastric ulcers have been
experimentally produced by injecting emboli into the gastric arteries
(Panum, Cohnheim).[96]

[Footnote 96: Pavy, _Philosoph.161; V.
Recklinghausen, _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.368; Axel Key, _Virchow
und Hirsch's Jahresb._, 1870, Bd.155; Rindfleisch, _Lehrb.Gewebelehre_, 5te Aufl., Leipzig, 1878; Panum, _Virchow's
Archiv_, Bd.491; Cohnheim, _Vorles.The main objections to this view are the infrequency with which the
assumed changes in the blood-vessels have been demonstrated, the common
occurrence of gastric ulcer at an age earlier than that at which
diseases of the blood-vessels are usually present, and the absence of
gastric ulcer in the vast majority of cases of heart disease, with
widespread embolism of different organs of the body.To meet some of
these objections, Klebs[97] presupposes in many cases a local spasmodic
contraction of the gastric arteries, causing temporary interruption of
the circulation; Rindfleisch and Axel Key, compression of the gastric
veins, with resulting hemorrhagic infiltration by spasm of the muscular
coat of the stomach in vomiting and in gastralgic attacks.What is actually known concerning diseases of the gastric blood-vessels
in ulcer of the stomach has already been stated under the morbid
anatomy.From this it may be inferred that the origin of gastric ulcer
in diseased conditions of the blood-vessels has been established only
for a comparatively small group of cases.Bottcher's[98] view that gastric ulcer is of mycotic origin, being
produced by micrococci, has thus far met with no confirmation.[Footnote 98: _Dorpater med.There are those who hold an eclectic view concerning the origin of
gastric ulcer.They believe that ulcer of the stomach may be produced
by a variety of causes, such as inflammation, circulatory disturbances,
irritating substances introduced into the stomach, traumatism, etc.The
peculiarities of the ulcer are due not to any specific cause, but to
the solvent action of the gastric juice, which keeps clean the floor
and the sides of the ulcer.These clean edges and floor, which are
incident to all ulcers of the stomach, justify no conclusion as to the
cause of the ulcer.Engel[99] over thirty years ago held that gastric
ulcer might {514} originate in various ways--that there was nothing
specific about it.[Footnote 99: _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, 1853, ii.]Gastric ulcers have been produced experimentally in animals in a
variety of ways, but these experiments have not materially elucidated
the pathenogenesis of ulcer in man.Schiff by lesions of various parts
of the brain, and later Ebstein by lesions of many parts of the central
and peripheral nervous system by injections of strychnine--in fact,
apparently by any means which greatly increased the
blood-pressure--produced in the stomachs of animals ecchymoses and
ulcers.Muller by ligation of the portal vein, Pavy by ligation of
arteries supplying the stomach, likewise produced hemorrhages and
ulcers.The results of Pavy could not be confirmed by Roth and others.Panum, and afterward Cohnheim, produced gastric ulcers by introducing
multiple emboli into the gastric arteries.Daettwyler under Quincke's
direction caused, in dogs with gastric fistulae, ulcers of the stomach
by various mechanical, chemical, and thermic irritants applied to the
inner surface of the stomach.Aufrecht observed hemorrhages and ulcers
in the stomachs of rabbits after subcutaneous injections of
cantharidin.[100]

_Centralbl.The most interesting of these experiments are those of Cohnheim and of
Daettwyler, who demonstrated that in one essential point all of these
experimental ulcers differ from simple gastric ulcer in man--namely, in
the readiness with which they heal.To this ready healing the gastric
juice, much as it has been accused of causing the spread of gastric
ulcers in man, seems to have offered no obstacle.We know that similar
losses of substance in the human stomach heal equally well.[101] Hence
it has been maintained throughout this article that it is unjustifiable
to regard all of the scars found in the human stomach as the result of
simple ulcer.[Footnote 101: Portions of the mucous membrane of the stomach,
sometimes with some of the submucous coat, have been in several
instances removed with the stomach-pump, but thus far no bad effects
have followed.]It appears from these experiments, as well as from observations on man,
that it is more difficult to explain why ulcers in the stomach do not
heal than it is to understand how they may be produced.From this point
of view the observation of Daettwyler is of interest, that in dogs
which had been rendered anaemic by repeated abstraction of blood not
only did slighter irritants suffice to produce ulcers of the stomach,
but the ulcers healed much more slowly.Practically, it is important to
learn what are the obstacles to the repair of gastric ulcers, but our
positive knowledge of these is slight.It is probable that such
obstacles are to be found in constitutional causes, such as anaemia and
chlorosis, in abnormal states of the blood-vessels around the ulcer, in
catarrhal affections of the stomach, in irritating articles of food, in
improper modes of living, and in increased acidity of the gastric
juice.DIAGNOSIS.--In many cases the diagnosis of gastric ulcer can be made
with reasonable certainty; in other cases the diagnosis amounts only to
a suspicion more or less strong, and in still other cases the diagnosis
is impossible.{515} The diagnostic symptoms are epigastric pain, vomiting, and
gastric hemorrhage.The characteristics of the pain which aid in the
diagnosis are its fixation in one spot in the epigastric region, its
onset soon after eating, its dependence upon the quantity and the
quality of the food, its relief upon the complete expulsion of the
contents of the stomach, its alleviation by changes in posture, and its
increase by pressure.That the pain of gastric ulcer has not always
these characteristics has been mentioned under the Symptomatology.Vomiting without haematemesis is the least characteristic of these
symptoms.It aids in the diagnosis when it occurs after eating at the
acme of a gastralgic attack and is followed by the relief of pain.Haematemesis is the most valuable symptom in diagnosis.The more
profuse the hemorrhage and the younger the individual in whom it
occurs, the greater is the probability of gastric ulcer.It should not
be forgotten that the blood is sometimes discharged solely by the
stools.The simultaneous occurrence of all these symptoms renders the diagnosis
of gastric ulcer easy.[102] In all cases in which gastrorrhagia is
absent the diagnosis is uncertain; but gastric ulcer should be
suspected whenever the ingestion of food is followed persistently by
severe epigastric pain and other causes of the pain have not been
positively determined.When the course of the ulcer is latent and when
the symptoms are only those of dyspepsia, the diagnosis is of course
impossible.In cases previously obscure a diagnosis in extremis is
sometimes made possible by the occurrence of perforation of the
stomach.[Footnote 102: That even under the most favorable circumstances
absolute certainty in the diagnosis of gastric ulcer is not reached is
illustrated by a case reported with great precision and fulness by
Banti: A female servant, twenty-one years old, had every symptom of
gastric ulcer, including repeated haematemesis and the characteristic
epigastric pain.She died from an
ulcerative proctitis four days after the last hemorrhage from the
stomach.Only a slight catarrhal inflammation of the stomach was found
at the autopsy, without trace of ulcer, cicatrix, or ecchymosis ("Di un
Caso d'Ematemesi," _La Sperimentale_, Feb., 1880, p.It would
seem as if there must have been an ulcer which had healed so completely
as to leave no recognizable scar.]In making a differential diagnosis of gastric ulcer, as well as of any
disease, reliance should be placed more upon the whole complexion of
the case than upon any fancied pathognomonic symptoms.The diseases which are most difficult to distinguish from gastric ulcer
are nervous affections of the stomach.Like gastric ulcer, most of
these are more common in women than in men, and especially in chlorotic
women with disordered menstruation and with hysterical manifestations.These nervous affections are manifold and their leading characteristics
are not yet well defined.The most important of these affections are
nervous dyspepsia, nervous vomiting, nervous gastralgia, and gastric
crises.The leading symptoms of nervous dyspepsia, as described by Leube,[103]
are the ordinary symptoms of dyspepsia without evidence of anatomical
alteration of the stomach, and with the proof by washing out the
stomach that the process of digestion is not delayed.Nervous dyspepsia
is often associated with other nervous affections, and is caused
especially by influences which depress the nervous system.Epigastric
pain, and especially tenderness on pressure over the stomach, are not
common symptoms in nervous dyspepsia.Only those rare cases of gastric
ulcer in which hemorrhage from the stomach is absent and epigastric
pain is not prominent {516} are likely to be confounded with nervous
dyspepsia.In such cases, although the diagnosis of nervous dyspepsia
is by far the most probable, the patient may be confined to bed and put
upon the strict regimen for gastric ulcer.If in the course of ten days
or two weeks essential relief is not obtained, ulcer may be excluded,
and the proper treatment for nervous dyspepsia with tonics and
electricity may be adopted (Leube).[Footnote 103: _Deutches Arch.In nervous vomiting, which occurs most frequently in hysterical women,
other nervous manifestations are present; there are usually less
epigastric pain and tenderness than in ulcer; the nutrition is better
preserved; the vomiting is less dependent upon the ingestion of food
and more dependent on mental states; and there are longer intervals of
relief than in ulcer.Still, it may be necessary to resort to the
therapeutical diagnosis as in the preceding instance.In this connection attention may be called to the importance of
searching for reflex causes of vomiting, such as beginning phthisis,
ovarian or uterine disease, cerebral disease, and pregnancy; also to
certain cases of chronic Bright's disease in which gastric disturbances
are the main symptoms.Of all the nervous affections of the stomach, nervous gastralgia is the
one which presents the greatest similarity to gastric ulcer.Its
diagnosis from gastric ulcer is often extremely difficult, and may be
impossible.The points of difference given in the following table may
aid in the diagnosis:

elevated in gastric ulcer, but not in nervous gastralgia.Probably not a single one of the points mentioned in the table is
without exception.Nervous gastralgia may be associated with gastric
ulcer, and if the ulcer is otherwise latent the diagnosis is manifestly
impossible.A diagnosis of purely functional gastralgia has been
repeatedly overthrown by the occurrence of profuse haematemesis.There
is no symptom {517} upon which it is more unsatisfactory to base a
diagnosis than upon pain.There is much difference among physicians as
regards the frequency with which they diagnose gastric ulcer in the
class of cases here described.It is probable that the error is
oftenest a too frequent diagnosis of gastric ulcer than the reverse.Nevertheless, when there is doubt it is well to submit the patient for
a time to the proper treatment for gastric ulcer.In several instances gastric crises have been mistaken for gastric
ulcer.These gastric or gastralgic crises, as they are called by
Charcot, by whom they have been best described,[105] are most
frequently associated with locomotor ataxia, but they may occur in
connection with other diseases of the spinal cord (subacute myelitis,
general spinal paralysis, and disseminated sclerosis), and an analogous
affection has been described by Leyden[106] as an independent disease
under the name of periodical vomiting with severe gastralgic attacks.Gastric crises have been most carefully studied as a symptom in the
prodromic stage of locomotor ataxia.The distinguishing features of
these crises are the sudden onset and the atrocious severity of the
gastric pain; the simultaneous occurrence of almost incessant vomiting;
the habitual continuance of the paroxysms, almost without remission,
for two or three days; the normal performance of the gastric functions
in the intervals between the paroxysms, which may be months apart; the
frequent association with other prodromic symptoms of locomotor ataxia,
such as ocular disorders and fulgurating pains in the extremities; and
the development after a time of ataxia.Leyden has observed during the
attacks retraction of the abdomen without tension of the abdominal
walls, obstinate constipation, scanty, dark- urine, even anuria
for twenty-four hours, and increased frequency of the pulse (also noted
by Charcot).Vulpian[107] mentions a case in which there was vomiting
of dark- blood, and in which naturally the diagnosis of gastric
ulcer had been made.In the autopsies of Leyden and of Charcot no
lesions of the stomach have been found.[Footnote 107: _Maladies du Syst.The differential diagnosis of gastric ulcer from gastric cancer will be
considered in the article on GASTRIC CANCER.It has already been said that a part of the symptoms of gastric ulcer
are due to an associated chronic catarrhal gastritis.Usually other
symptoms are present which render possible the diagnosis of the ulcer.There is usually some apparent external or internal cause of chronic
catarrhal gastritis, whereas the etiology of ulcer is obscure; in
chronic gastritis gastralgic paroxysms and the peculiar fixed
epigastric pain of gastric ulcer are usually absent; in chronic
gastritis profuse haematemesis is a rare occurrence; and in gastritis
the relief obtained by rest and proper regulation of the diet, although
manifest, is usually less immediate and striking than in most cases of
gastric ulcer.The passage of gall-stones is usually sufficiently distinguished from
gastric ulcer by the sudden onset and the sudden termination of the
pain, by the situation of the pain to the right of the median line, by
the complete relief in the intervals between the attacks, by the
occurrence of jaundice, by the recognition sometimes of enlargement of
the liver and of the gall-bladder, and by the detection of gall-stones
in the feces.{518} There is not much danger of confounding abdominal aneurism and
lead colic with gastric ulcer, and the points in their differential
diagnosis are sufficiently apparent to require no description here.The
diagnosis of duodenal ulcer from gastric ulcer will be discussed
elsewhere.The different causes of gastric hemorrhage, a knowledge of
which is essential to the diagnosis of gastric ulcer, will be
considered in the article on HEMORRHAGE FROM THE STOMACH.PROGNOSIS.--Although a decided majority of simple ulcers of the stomach
cicatrize, nevertheless, in view of the frequently insidious course of
the disease, the sudden perforations, the grave hemorrhages, the
relapses, and the sequels of the disease, the prognosis must be
pronounced serious.The earlier the ulcer comes under treatment the better the prognosis.Old ulcers with thickened indurated margins containing altered
blood-vessels naturally heal with greater difficulty than
recently-formed ulcers.Profuse hemorrhage adds to the gravity of the diagnosis.It usually
indicates that the ulcer has penetrated to the serous coat of the
stomach.A hemorrhage may exert a favorable influence, in so far as to
convince the patient of the necessity of submitting to the repose and
the strict dietetic regimen which the physician prescribes.The severity of the pain is of little value as a prognostic sign.Vomiting and dyspepsia, if uncontrolled by regulation of the diet, lead
to a cachectic state which often ends in death.Little basis as there is to hope for recovery after perforation into
the general peritoneal cavity, there nevertheless have been a very few
cases in which there is reason to believe that recovery has actually
taken place after this occurrence.[108]

[Footnote 108: The most convincing case of recovery after perforation
of gastric ulcer is one reported by Hughes, Ray, and Hilton in _Guy's
Hosp.A servant-girl was suddenly seized with all
of the symptoms of perforation.Fortunately, she had eaten nothing for
four hours before the attack, and then only gruel.She was placed at
once under the influence of opium, was kept in the recumbent posture,
and was fed by the rectum.She was discharged apparently cured after
fifty-two days.Two months afterward she was again suddenly seized with
the same symptoms, and she died in fourteen hours.Shortly before the
second perforation she had eaten cherries, strawberries, and
gooseberries, which were found in the peritoneal cavity.The autopsy
showed, in addition to a recent peritonitis, evidences of an old
peritonitis.There were adhesions of the coils of the intestines with
each other and between the stomach and adjacent viscera.In the stomach
were found a cicatrix and two open ulcers, one of which had perforated.Other cases in which recovery followed after all of the symptoms of
perforation of gastric ulcer were present, but in which no subsequent
autopsy proved the correctness of the diagnosis, have been reported by
Redwood (_Lancet_, May 7, 1870); Ross (_ibid._, Jan.21, 1871); Tinley
(_ibid._, April 15, 1871); Mancini (_La Sperimentale_, 1876, pp.551,
665); and G. Johnson (_Brit.Frazer's two cases, reported in the _Dublin Hosp.Gaz._, April 15,
1861, are not convincing.The case reported by Aufrecht (_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1870, No.21) and the one by Starcke (_Deutsche Klinik_,
1870, No.39), which are sometimes quoted as examples of recovery, were
cases of circumscribed peritonitis following perforation.In an interesting case from Nothnagel's clinic reported by Luderitz,
the patient lived sixteen days after perforation into the peritoneal
cavity, followed by all of the symptoms of diffuse perforative
peritonitis.Death resulted from pneumonia secondary to the
peritonitis.At the autopsy were found adhesions over the whole
peritoneal surface and streaks of thickened pus between the coils of
intestine.The perforation in the stomach was closed by the left lobe
of the liver (_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1879, No.In estimating the prognosis one should bear in mind the possibility of
relapses; of a continuance of gastric disorders, particularly of
gastralgia, after cicatrization; of the formation of cicatricial
stenosis of {519} the orifices of the stomach; and of the development
of dilatation of the stomach.After the worst has been said concerning the unfavorable issues of
gastric ulcer, it yet remains true that the essential tendency of the
ulcer when placed under favorable conditions is toward recovery, and
that in many cases the treatment of the disease affords most excellent
results, and is therefore a thankful undertaking for the physician.TREATMENT.--In the absence of any agent which exerts a direct curative
influence upon gastric ulcer the main indication for treatment is the
removal of all sources of irritation from the ulcer, so that the
process of repair may be impeded as little as possible.Theoretically, this is best accomplished by giving to the stomach
complete rest and by nourishing the patient by rectal alimentation.Practically, this method of administering food is attended with many
difficulties, and, moreover, the nutrition of the patient eventually
suffers by persistence in its employment.In most cases the patient can
be more satisfactorily nourished by the stomach, and by proper
selection of the diet, without causing injurious irritation of the
ulcer.At the beginning of the course of treatment it is often well to
withhold for two or three days all food from the stomach and to resort
to exclusive rectal feeding.In some cases with uncontrollable vomiting
and after-hemorrhage from the stomach it is necessary to feed the
patient exclusively by the rectum.The substances best adapted for nutritive enemata are
artificially-digested foods, such as Leube's pancreatic meat-emulsion,
his beef-solution, and peptonized milk-gruel as recommended by
Roberts.[109] Beef-tea and eggs, which are often used for this purpose,
are not to be recommended, as the former has very little nutritive
value, and egg albumen is absorbed in but slight amount from the
rectum.Expressed beef-juice may also be used for rectal alimentation.The peptones, although physiologically best adapted for nutritive
enemata, often irritate the mucous membrane of the rectum, so that they
cannot be retained.It has been proven that it is impossible to
completely nourish a human being by the rectum.[110] Rectal
alimentation can sometimes be advantageously combined with feeding by
the mouth.[Footnote 109: Leube's pancreatic meat-emulsion is prepared by adding
to 4-8 ounces of scraped and finely-chopped beef l-2-1/2 ounces of
fresh finely-chopped oxen's or pig's pancreas freed from fat.To the
mixture is added a little lukewarm water until the consistence after
stirring is that of thick gruel.The syringe used to inject this
mixture should have a wide opening in the nozzle; Leube has constructed
one for the purpose (Leube, _Deutsches Arch.The milk-gruel is prepared by adding a thick, well-boiled gruel made
from wheaten flour, arrowroot, or some other farinaceous article to an
equal quantity of milk.Just before administration a dessertspoonful of
liquor pancreaticus (Benger) or 5 grains of extractum pancreatis
(Fairchild Bros.), with 20 grains of bicarbonate of soda, are added to
the enema.This may be combined with peptonized beef-tea made according
to Roberts's formula (Roberts, _On the Digestive Ferments_, p.Preparatory to beginning the treatment the bowels should be emptied by
a clyster, and this should be occasionally repeated.About three to six
ounces of the tepid nutritive fluid should be slowly injected into the
rectum.The injections may be repeated at intervals of from three to
six hours.If necessary, a few drops of laudanum may be occasionally
added to the enema.][Footnote 110: Voit u. Bauer, _Zeitschrift f. Biologie_, Bd.There is universal agreement that the dietetic treatment of gastric
ulcer is of much greater importance than the medicinal treatment.There
is {520} hardly another disease in which the beneficial effects of
proper regulation of the diet are so apparent as in gastric ulcer.Those articles of food are most suitable which call into action least
vigorously the secretion of gastric juice and the peristaltic movements
of the stomach, which do not cause abnormal fermentations, which do not
remain a long time in the stomach, and which do not mechanically
irritate the surface of the ulcer.These requirements are met only by a
fluid diet, and are met most satisfactorily by milk and by Leube's
beef-solution.The efficacy of a milk diet in this disease has been attested by long
and manifold experience.By its adoption in many cases the pain and the
vomiting are relieved, and finally disappear, and the ulcer heals.In
general, fresh milk is well borne.If not, skimmed milk may be
employed.If the digestion of the milk causes acidity, then a small
quantity of bicarbonate of soda or some lime-water (one-fourth to
one-half in bulk) may be added to the milk.Large quantities should not
be taken at once.Four ounces of milk taken every two hours are
generally well borne.Sometimes not more than a tablespoonful can be
taken at a time without causing vomiting, and then of course the milk
should be given at shorter intervals.It is desirable that the patient
should receive at least a quart, and if possible two quarts, during the
twenty-four hours.The milk should be slightly warmed, but in some
cases cold milk may be better retained.In some instances buttermilk
agrees with the patient better than sweet milk.Although many suppose
that they have some idiosyncrasy as regards the digestion of milk, this
idiosyncrasy is more frequently imaginary than real.Still, there are
cases in which milk cannot be retained, even in small quantity.For such cases peptonized milk often proves serviceable.[111] The
artificial digestion of milk as well as of other articles of food is a
method generally applicable to the treatment of gastric ulcer.The main
objection to peptonized milk is the aversion to it that many patients
acquire on account of its bitter taste.The peptonization should not be
carried beyond a slightly bitter taste.The disagreeable taste may be
improved by the addition of a little Vichy or soda-water.Peptonized
milk has proved to be most valuable in the treatment of gastric ulcer.[Footnote 111: Milk may be peptonized by adding to a pint of fresh
milk, warmed to a temperature of 100 degrees F., 5 grs.of extract
pancreatis (Fairchild Bros.sodii
dissolved in 4 ounces of tepid water.The mixture is allowed to digest
for about an hour at a temperature of 100 degrees F., which may be
conveniently done by placing the milk in a bowl in a pan of water
maintained at this temperature.It is then boiled, strained, and placed
on ice, or when the milk is to be taken immediately it is better not to
boil it, in order that the partial digestion may continue for a while
under the influence of the pancreatic ferment in the stomach.The milk
without boiling may be kept on ice without further digestion; and this
procedure has the advantage that the pancreatic ferments, although
inactive at a temperature near that of ice, are not destroyed.The
degree of digestion aimed at is indicated by the production of a
slightly, but not unpleasantly, bitter taste.When the digestion is
carried to completion, milk has a very bitter and disagreeable flavor.Peptonized milk-gruel, mentioned on page 519, may also be employed.]Leube's beef-solution[112] is a nutritious, unirritating, and
easily-digested article of diet.It can often be taken when milk is not
easily or {521} completely digested, or when milk becomes tiresome and
disagreeable to the patient.It is relied upon mainly by Leube in his
very successful treatment of gastric ulcer.A pot of the beef-solution
(corresponding to a half pound of beef) is to be taken during the
twenty-four hours.A tablespoonful or more may be given at a time in
unsalted or but slightly salted bouillon, to which, if desired, a
little of Liebig's beef-extract may be added to improve the taste.The
bouillon should be absolutely free from fat.Unfortunately, not a few
patients acquire such a distaste for the beef-solution that they cannot
be persuaded to continue its use for any considerable length of time.[Footnote 112: By means of a high temperature and of hydrochloric acid
the meat enclosed in an air-tight vessel is converted into a fine
emulsion and is partly digested.Its soft consistence, highly
nutritious quality, and easy digestibility render this preparation of
the greatest value.The beef-solution is prepared in New York
satisfactorily by Mettenheimer, druggist, Sixth Avenue and Forty-fifth
street, and by Dr.Rudisch, whose preparation is sold by several
druggists.]Freshly-expressed beef-juice is also a fairly nutritious food, which
can sometimes be employed with advantage.The juice is rendered more
palatable if it is pressed from scraped or finely-chopped beef which
has been slightly broiled with a little fresh butter and salt.The meat
should, however, remain very rare, and the fat should be carefully
removed from the juice.To the articles of diet which have been mentioned can sometimes be
added raw or soft-boiled egg in small quantity, and as an addition to
the milk crumbled biscuit or wheaten bread which may be toasted, or
possibly powdered rice or arrowroot or some of the infant farinaceous
foods, such as Nestle's.Milk thickened with powdered cracker does not
coagulate in large masses in the stomach, and is therefore sometimes
better borne than ordinary milk.For the first two or three weeks at least the patient should be
confined strictly to the bill of fare here given.Nothing should be
left to the discretion of the patient or of his friends.It is not enough to direct the patient simply to
take easily-digested food, but precise directions should be given as to
what kind of food is to be taken, how much is to be taken at a time,
how often it is to be taken, and how it is to be prepared.In all cases of any severity the patient should be treated in bed in
the recumbent posture, and warm fomentations should be kept over the
region of the stomach.Usually, at the end of two or three weeks of this diet the patient's
condition is sufficiently improved to allow greater variety in his
food.Boiled white meat of a young fowl can
now usually be taken, and agreeable dishes can be prepared with milk,
beaten eggs, and farinaceous substances, such as arrowroot, rice,
corn-starch, tapioca, and sago.Boiled calf's brain and calf's feet are allowed by Leube at this stage
of the treatment.To these articles can soon be added a very rare beefsteak made from the
soft mass scraped by a blunt instrument from a tenderloin of beef, so
that all coarse and tough fibres are left behind.This may be
superficially broiled with a little fresh butter.Boiled white fish,
particularly cod, may also be tried.It is especially important to avoid all coarse, mechanically-irritating
food, such as brown bread, wheaten grits, oatmeal, etc.; also fatty
substances, pastry, acids, highly-seasoned food, vegetables, fruit, and
all kinds of spirituous liquor.The juice of oranges and of lemons can
usually be taken.The food should not be taken very hot or very cold.For at least two or three months the patient should be confined to the
{522} easily-digested articles of diet mentioned.These afford
sufficient variety, and no license should be given to exceed the
dietary prescribed by the physician.Transgression in this respect is
liable to be severely punished by return of the symptoms.When there is
reason to believe that the ulcer is cicatrized, the patient may
gradually resume his usual diet, but often for a long time, and perhaps
for life, he may be compelled to guard his diet very carefully, lest
there should be a return of the disease.Should there be symptoms of a
relapse, the patient should resume at once the easily-digested diet
described above.Medicinal treatment of gastric ulcer, although less efficacious than
the dietetic treatment, is not to be discarded.Since its advocacy by
Ziemssen the administration of Carlsbad salts or of similarly composed
salts belongs to the systematic treatment of gastric ulcer.The objects
intended to be accomplished by the use of these salts are the daily
evacuation of the contents of the stomach into the intestine by gentle
stimulation of the gastric peristaltic movements, the neutralization of
the acid of the stomach, and the prevention of acid fermentations in
the stomach.Of these objects the most important is the prevention of
stagnation of the contents of the stomach.The chief ingredients of the
Carlsbad waters are sulphate of sodium, carbonate of sodium, and
chloride of sodium.The most important of these ingredients is sulphate
of sodium (Glauber's salts), which by exciting peristalsis propels the
gastric contents into the intestine, and thus relieves the stomach of
its burden, prevents fermentation, and removes from the surface of the
ulcer an important source of irritation.The carbonate of sodium
neutralizes the acids of the stomach, but the main value of this
ingredient and of the chloride of sodium is that in some way they
correct the action of the Glauber's salts, so that the latter may be
taken in smaller quantity and without the usual unpleasant effects of
pure Glauber's salts.[113] The artificial Carlsbad salts are to be
preferred to the natural or the artificial Carlsbad water.The natural
Carlsbad salts and much of those sold as artificial Carlsbad salts
consist almost wholly of sulphate of sodium.It is therefore best to
prescribe in proper proportion the leading ingredients of these salts.A suitable combination is sulphate of sodium five ounces, bicarbonate
of sodium two ounces, and chloride of sodium one ounce
(Leichtenstern[114]).The relative proportion of the ingredients may of
course be varied somewhat to suit individual cases.The salts are to be
taken daily before breakfast dissolved in a considerable quantity of
warm water.One or two heaping teaspoonfuls of the salts are dissolved
in one-half to one pint of water warmed to a {523} temperature of 95
degrees F. One-fourth of this is to be drunk at a time at intervals of
ten minutes.Breakfast is taken half an hour after the last draught.After breakfast there should follow one or two loose movements of the
bowels.If this is not the case, the next day the quantity of the salts
is to be increased, or if more movements are produced the quantity is
to be diminished until the desired result is obtained.In case the
salts do not operate, an enema may be used.Usually, to obtain the same
effect, the quantity of salts may be gradually diminished to a
teaspoonful.[Footnote 113: Water from the Sprudel spring contains in 16 ounces 18.2
grains of sulphate of sodium, 14.6 grains of bicarbonate of sodium, and
7.9 grains of chloride of sodium, and 11.8 cubic inches of carbonic
acid.Its natural temperature is 158 degrees F. The other Carlsbad
springs have the same fixed composition and vary only in temperature
and amount of CO_{2}.][Footnote 114: The second edition of the German Pharmacopoeia contains
a formula for making artificial Carlsbad salts, so that the ingredients
are in about the same proportion as in the natural water.The formula
is as follows: Dried sulphate of sodium 44 parts, sulphate of potassium
2 parts, chloride of sodium 18 parts, bicarbonate of sodium 36 parts.These should be mixed so as to make a white dry powder.The Carlsbad
water is imitated by dissolving 6 grammes of this salt in 1 liter of
water (_Pharmacopoeia Germanica_, editio altera, Berlin, 1882, p.According to a prescription very commonly used in Germany, the Carlsbad
salts are made by taking sulphate of sodium 50 parts, bicarbonate of
sodium 6 parts, chloride of sodium 3 parts.Dose, a teaspoonful
dissolved in one or two tumblers of warm water (Ewald u. Ludecke,
_Handb.Arzneiverordnungslehre_, Berlin, 1883, p.The Carlsbad salts are directed especially against the chronic gastric
catarrh which complicates the majority of cases of ulcer of the
stomach.It is well known that the most effective method of treating
this morbid condition is the washing out of the stomach by means of the
stomach-tube.The propriety of adopting this procedure in gastric ulcer
comes, therefore, under consideration.Although the use of the
stomach-tube in gastric ulcer is discarded by Leube and by See on
account of its possible danger, nevertheless this instrument has been
employed with great benefit in many instances of this disease by
Schliep, Debore, and others.[115] No instance of perforation of an
ulcer by means of the stomach-tube has been reported, and in general no
evil effects have resulted; but Duguet cites a case of fatal hemorrhage
following washing out of the stomach.[116] In view of the great benefit
to be secured by washing out the stomach, and of the comparatively
slight danger which attends the process, it seems justifiable to adopt
this procedure cautiously and occasionally in cases of gastric ulcer
with severe gastric catarrh.Of course only the soft rubber tube should
be used, and the siphon process should be adopted.[117] The stomach may
be washed out with pure warm water or with water containing a little
bicarbonate of sodium (one-half drachm to a quart of water).The
occasional cleansing of the stomach in this way can hardly fail to
promote the healing of the ulcer.Recent or threatened hemorrhage from
the stomach would contraindicate the use of the stomach-tube.[Footnote 115: Schliep, _Deutsch.13; Debore,
_L'Union med._, Dec.30, 1882; Bianchi, _Gaz.degli Ospitali_, March
26, 1884.]In a case of gastric
ulcer of Cornillon severe hemorrhage followed washing out the stomach
(_Le Prog.[Footnote 117: Soft rubber stomach-tubes are made by Tiemann & Co.in
New York, and are sold by most medical instrument-makers.A description
of the appropriate tube and of the method of its use is given by W. B.
Platt ("The Mechanical Treatment of Diseases of the Stomach," _Maryland
Medical Journal_, March 8, 1884).]Beyond the measures indicated there is little more to do in the way of
treatment directed toward the repair of the ulcer.Not much, if
anything, is to be expected from the employment of drugs which have
been claimed to exert a specific curative action on the ulcer.Of these
drugs those which have been held in the greatest repute are bismuth and
nitrate of silver.Trousseau[118] devised a somewhat complicated plan
for administering bismuth and nitrate of silver in succession for
several months in the treatment of gastric ulcer.There are few who any
longer cherish any faith in these drugs as curative of gastric ulcer.The same may be said of other drugs which have been thought to have
similar specific virtue in the treatment of gastric ulcer, such as
acetate of lead, arsenic, chloral hydrate, iodoform, etc.[Footnote 118: _Clinique medicale_, t. iii.{524} It remains to consider therapeutic measures which may be
necessary to combat individual symptoms of gastric ulcer.The pain of gastric ulcer is generally relieved in a few days by strict
adherence to the dietetic regimen which has been laid down.When this
is not the case, it may be best to withhold all food from the stomach
and to nourish by the rectum.But this cannot be continued long without
weakening the patient, and sometimes the pain persists in spite of the
rest afforded the stomach.Undoubtedly, the most effective means of
quieting the pain of gastric ulcer is the administration of opium in
some form.Opium should not, however, be resorted to without full
consideration of the possible consequences.When the use of this drug
is once begun, the patient is liable to become dependent upon it, and
may be inclined, consciously or unconsciously, to exaggerate the pain
in order to obtain the narcotic.When prescribing opium in this disease
the physician should have in mind the danger of establishing the opium
habit.Moreover, opium <DW44>s digestion, and is anything but an aid to
the proper dietetic regimen, which is all-important.If it is decided
to give opium, it does not matter much in what form it is administered,
but the dose should be as small as will answer the purpose.Hypodermic
injections of morphine over the region of the stomach may be
recommended.Codeia often produces less disturbance than opium or
morphine.A useful powder for the relief of pain is one containing 8 or
10 grains of subnitrate of bismuth, 1/12 grain of sulphate of morphia,
and 1/5 grain of extract of belladonna.Much of the beneficial effect
attributed to bismuth is in reality due to its customary combination
with a small quantity of morphine.Before resorting to opium in cases
of severe pain it will be well to try some of the other means for
relieving the pain of gastric ulcer, although they are less effective.Gerhardt thinks that astringents are better than narcotics to relieve
the pain of ulcer, and he recommends for the purpose three or four
drops of solution of chloride of iron diluted with a wineglassful of
water, to be taken several times daily.Although this recommendation is
from high authority and is often quoted, sufficient confirmatory
evidence of its value is lacking.Other medicines recommended are
hyoscyamus, belladonna, choral hydrate, chloric ether, hydrocyanic
acid, bismuth, nitrate of silver, and compound kino powder.Sometimes
warm fomentations, at other times a light ice-bag over the epigastrium,
afford marked relief of the pain.Counter-irritation over the region of
the stomach has also given relief.This may be effected with a mustard
plaster or by croton oil.I have known the establishment of a small
nitric-acid issue in the pit of the stomach to relieve the pain, but
such severe measures of counter-irritation are generally unnecessary.The application of a few leeches over the epigastrium has been highly
recommended, but this should be done without much loss of blood.The
effect of position of the body upon the relief of pain should be
determined.When the pain is due to flatulence or to acid fermentation
in the stomach, the treatment should be directed to those states.The most effective means of controlling the vomiting in gastric ulcer
are the regulation of the diet and, if necessary, the resort to rectal
alimentation.Whenever small
quantities of milk, peptonized or in any other form, cannot be
retained, then exclusive rectal feeding may be tried for a while.There
have been cases of gastric {525} ulcer when both the stomach and the
rectum have been intolerant of food.In such desperate cases the
attempt may be made to introduce food into the stomach by means of the
stomach-tube, for it is a singular fact that food introduced in this
way is sometimes retained when everything taken by the mouth is
vomited.[119] The cautious washing out of the stomach by the
stomach-tube may prove beneficial.In these cases the attempt has also
been made to nourish by subcutaneous injections of food.In a case of
gastric ulcer where no food could be retained either by the stomach or
by the rectum Whittaker[120] injected subcutaneously milk,
beef-extract, and warmed cod-liver oil.The
injections were continued for four days without food by the mouth or
rectum.At the best, hypodermic alimentation can
afford but slight nourishment, and is to be regarded only as a last
refuge.If there is danger of death by exhaustion, transfusion may be
resorted to.[Footnote 119: Debore, _L'Union medicale_, Dec.30, 1882, and _Gaz.des
Hop._, April 29, 1884.For this reason Debore makes extensive use of
the stomach-tube in general in feeding patients affected with gastric
ulcer.He objects to an exclusive milk diet on account of the quantity
of fluid necessary to nourish the patient, which he says amounts to
three to four quarts of milk daily.To avoid these inconveniences, he
gives three times daily drachm viss of meat-powder and drachm iiss of
bicarbonate of sodium (or equal parts of calcined magnesia and bicarb.This is to be introduced by the
stomach-tube on account of its disagreeable taste.He believes that the
addition of the large quantity of alkali prevents digestion from
beginning until the food has reached the intestine.He also gives daily
a quart of milk containing grs.Debore's
method of preparing the meat-powder is described in _L'Union medicale_,
July 29, 1882, p.He also uses a milk-powder (_ibid._, Dec.30,
1882; see also _Le Progres med._, July 12, 1884).][Footnote 120: J. T. Whittaker, "Hypodermic Alimentation," _The
Clinic_, Jan.Bernutz practised successfully in two cases the hypodermic injection of
fresh dog's blood (_Gaz.Wochenschr._, 1875, No.of
olive oil twice a day subcutaneously without causing abscesses.Menzel and Porco were the first to employ hypodermic alimentation
(_ibid._, 1869, No.Of remedies to check vomiting, first in importance are ice swallowed in
small fragments and morphine administered hypodermically.Effervescent
drinks, such as Vichy, soda-water, and iced champagne, may bring
relief.Other remedies which have been recommended are bismuth,
hydrocyanic acid, oxalate of cerium, creasote, iodine, bromide of
potash, calomel in small doses, and ingluvin.But in general it is best
to forego the use of drugs and to rely upon proper regulation of the
diet, such as iced milk taken in teaspoonful doses, and upon repose for
the stomach.Hemorrhage from the stomach is best treated by absolute rest, the
administration of bits of ice by the mouth, and the application of a
flat, not too heavy, ice-bag over the stomach.The patient should lie
as quietly as possible in the supine position, with light coverings and
in a cool atmosphere.He should be cautioned to make no exertion.His
apprehensions should be quieted so far as possible.All food should be
withheld from the stomach, and for four or five days after the
cessation of profuse hemorrhage aliment should be given only by the
rectum.There is no proof that styptics administered by the mouth have
any control over the hemorrhage, and as they are liable to excite
vomiting they may do harm.Sandra went to the hallway.Ergotin, dissolved in water (1 part to 10),
may be injected hypodermically in grain doses several times repeated if
necessary.If internal styptics {526} are to be used, perhaps the best
are alum-whey and a combination of gallic acid 10 grains and dilute
sulphuric acid 10 drops diluted with water.Fox praises acetate of
lead, and others ergot, tannin, and Monsell's solution.If there is
vomiting or much restlessness, morphine should be given hypodermically.If the bleeding is profuse, elastic ligatures may be applied for a
short time around the upper part of one or more extremities, so as to
shut out temporarily from the circulation the blood contained in the
extremity.If syncope threatens, ammonia or a little ether may be
inhaled, or ether may be given hypodermically.Brandy, if administered,
should be given either by the rectum or hypodermically.Caution should
be exercised not to excite too vigorously the force of the circulation,
as the diminished force of the heart is an important agent in checking
hemorrhage.When life is threatened in consequence of the loss of
blood, then recourse may be had to transfusion, but experience has
shown that this act is liable to cause renewed hemorrhage in
consequence of the elevation of the blood-pressure which follows it.Transfusion is therefore indicated more for the acute anaemia after the
hemorrhage has ceased and is not likely to be renewed.It should not be
employed immediately after profuse haematemesis, unless it is probable
that otherwise the patient will die from the loss of blood, and then it
is well to transfuse only a small quantity.[121]

[Footnote 121: Michel transfused successfully in a case of extreme
anaemia following gastrorrhagia (_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1870, No.In a case of profuse and repeated haematemesis which followed
washing out the stomach Michaelis infused into the veins 350 cc.Reaction gradually followed, and the patient
recovered.This case, which was one of probable ulcer, illustrates the
advantages of infusing a small quantity (_ibid._, June 23, 1884).The
dangers are illustrated by a case reported by V. Hacker, who infused
1500 cc.of salt solution in a patient in a state of extreme collapse
resulting from hemorrhage from gastric ulcer.The patient rallied, but
he died three hours after the infusion from renewed hemorrhage (_Wiener
med.Wochenschr._, 1883, No.In Legroux's case of gastric ulcer
renewed hemorrhage and death followed the transfusion of only 80
grammes of blood (_Arch.In a case quoted
by Roussel, Leroy transfused 130 grammes of blood in a girl twenty
years old who lay at the point of death from repeated hemorrhages from
a gastric ulcer.In the following night occurred renewed hemorrhage and
death (_Gaz.According to the experiments
of Schwartz and V. Ott, the transfusion, or rather infusion, of
physiological salt solution is as useful as that of blood, and it is
simpler and unattended with some of the dangers of blood-transfusion.The formula is chloride of sodium 6 parts, distilled water 1000.]Schilling recommends, when the bleeding is so profuse that the
patient's life is threatened, to tampon the stomach by means of a
rubber balloon attached to the end of a soft-rubber stomach-tube.[122]
The external surface of the balloon is slightly oiled.It is introduced
into the stomach in a collapsed state, and after its introduction it is
moderately distended with air.When the balloon is to be withdrawn the
air should be allowed slowly to escape.Schilling tried this procedure
in one case of hemorrhage from gastric ulcer, allowing the inflated bag
to remain in the stomach twelve minutes.The hemorrhage ceased and was
not renewed.Experience only can determine whether this device, to
which there are manifest objections, will prove a valuable addition to
our meagre means of controlling hemorrhage from the stomach.[Footnote 122: F. Schilling, _Aerztl.Schreiber, in order to determine the position of the stomach, was the
first to introduce and inflate in this organ a rubber balloon
(_Deutsches Arch.Uhler recommends in
case of profuse gastric hemorrhage to pass a rubber bag into the
stomach and fill it with liquid (_Maryland Med.{527} The boldest suggestion ever made for stopping gastric hemorrhage
is that of Rydygier, who advocates in case hemorrhage from an ulcer
threatens to be fatal to cut down upon the stomach, search for the
bleeding ulcer, and then resect it.[123] Notwithstanding the great
advances made in gastric surgery during the last few years, Rydygier's
suggestion seems extravagant and unwarrantable.The most effectual treatment of the dyspepsia which is present in many
cases of gastric ulcer is adherence to the dietetic rules which have
been laid down, aided by the administration of Carlsbad salts and
perhaps in extreme cases the occasional and cautious use of the
stomach-tube.If eructations of gas and heartburn are troublesome,
antacids may be employed, but they should be given in small doses and
not frequently, as the ultimate effect of alkalies is to increase the
acid secretion of the stomach and to impair digestion.The best alkali
to use is bicarbonate of sodium, of which a few grains may be taken dry
upon the tongue or dissolved in a little water.If perforation into the peritoneal cavity occur, then opium or
hypodermic injections of morphine should be given in large doses, as in
peritonitis.Bran poultices sprinkled with laudanum or other warm
fomentations should be applied over the abdomen, although in Germany
ice-bags are preferred.Food should be administered only by the rectum.The chances of recovery are extremely slight, but the patient's
sufferings are thus relieved.In view of the almost certainly fatal
prognosis of perforation of gastric ulcer into the general peritoneal
cavity, and in view of the success attending various operations
requiring laparotomy, it would seem justifiable in these cases, after
arousing, if possible, the patient from collapse by the administration
of stimulants per rectum or hypodermically, to open the peritoneal
cavity and cleanse it with some tepid antiseptic solution, and then to
treat the perforation in the stomach and the case generally according
to established surgical methods.[124] This would be the more indicated
if it is known that the contents of the stomach at the time of
perforation are not of a bland nature.[Footnote 124: Mikulicz has successfully treated by laparotomy a case
of purulent peritonitis resulting from perforation of the intestine
with extravasation of the intestinal contents.He says that the
operation is not contraindicated by existing peritonitis if the patient
is not already in a state of collapse or sepsis.The perforation is
closed by sutures after freshening the edges of the opening (abstract
in the _Medical News_, Philada., Sept.Both Kuh and Rydygier
recommend opening the abdomen after perforation of gastric ulcer.The
borders of the ulcer are to be resected and the opening closed by
sutures (_Volkmann's Samml.Mary journeyed to the garden.It is important to maintain and to improve the patient's nutrition,
which often becomes greatly impaired from the effects of the ulcer.This indication is not altogether compatible with the all-important one
of reducing to a minimum the digestive work of the stomach.Nevertheless, some of the easily-digested articles of food which have
been mentioned are highly nutritious.By means of these and by good
hygienic management the physician should endeavor, without violating
the dietetic laws which have been laid down, to increase, so far as
possible, the strength of his patient.Starvation treatment in itself
is never indicated in gastric ulcer.Inunction of the body with oil is
useful in cases of gastric ulcer, as recommended by Pepper.[125]

[Footnote 125: _North Carolina Medical Journal_, 1880, vol.{528} In view of Daettwyler's experiments, mentioned on page 514, it is
manifestly important to counteract the anaemia of gastric ulcer.Iron,
however, administered by the mouth, disturbs the stomach and is
decidedly contraindicated during the active stage of gastric ulcer.During convalescence, only the blandest preparations of iron should be
given, and these not too soon, lest they cause a relapse.When the
indication to remove the anaemia is urgent, and especially when the
chlorotic form of anaemia exists, it may be well to try the hypodermic
method of administering iron, although this method has not yet been
made thoroughly satisfactory.Especially for the anaemia of gastric
ulcer would an efficient and unirritating preparation of iron for
hypodermic administration prove a great boon.Probably at present the
best preparation for hypodermic use is the citrate of iron, given in
one- to two-grain doses in a 10 per cent.aqueous solution, which when
used must be clear and not over a month old.The syringe and needle
shortly before using should be washed with carbolic acid.The
injections are best borne when made into the long muscles of the back
or into the nates, as recommended by Lewin for injections of corrosive
sublimate.A slight burning pain is felt for ten minutes after the
injection.This is the method employed by Quincke with good result and
without inflammatory reaction.[126] It is well to remember that
Kobert[127] has found by experiment on animals that large doses of iron
injected subcutaneously cause nephritis.Other preparations of iron
which have been recommended for hypodermic use are ferrum dialysatum
(DaCosta), ferrum pyrophosphoricum cum natr.citrico (Neuss), ferrum
pyrophosphoricum cum ammon.(Huguenin), ferrum peptonatum and
ferrum oleinicum (Rosenthal).[128] When it becomes safe to administer
iron by the stomach, then the blander preparations should be used, such
as the pyrophosphate, lactate, effervescing citrate, ferrum redactum.60, Gelatin q. s.; make 90 pills: at first one, and
afterward as many as three, of these pills may be taken three times a

1878, Nos.45-49, and 1884, Jan.Various sequels of gastric ulcer may require treatment.Cicatrization
of the ulcer is by no means always cure in the clinical sense.As the
result of adhesions and the formation and contraction of cicatricial
tissue very serious disturbances of the functions of the stomach may
follow the repair of gastric ulcer.The most important of these sequels
is stenosis of the orifices of the stomach, particularly of the pyloric
orifice.Very considerable stenosis of the pylorus may be produced
before the ulcer is completely cicatrized.In three instances a
stenosing ulcer of the pylorus has been successfully extirpated.[129]
The most important of these sequels {529} of gastric ulcer will be
treated of hereafter.Here it need only be said that during
convalescence from gastric ulcer attention to diet is all-important.For a long time the diet should be restricted to easily-digested food.The first symptoms of relapse are to be met by prompt return to bland
diet, or, if necessary, to rectal alimentation.[Footnote 129: The successful operators were Rydygier (_Berl.16, 1882), Czerny (_Arch.1), and Van Kleef (_Virchow u. Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1882, Bd.Cavazzani cut out by an elliptical incision an old
indurated ulcer of the stomach adherent to the anterior abdominal
walls.The patient died three years afterward of phthisis (_Centralbl.Sandra journeyed to the garden.f. Chir._, 1879, p.Lauenstein resected the pylorus
unsuccessfully for what appears to have been an ulcer of the pylorus
with fibroid induration around it (_ibid._, 1882, No.These four
cases (three successful) are all which I have found recorded of
resection of gastric ulcer.In my opinion the resection of gastric
ulcers which resist all other methods of treatment, and especially
those which cause progressive stricture of the pylorus, is a
justifiable operation.]Ulcers of the stomach which do not belong to the category of simple
ulcer are for the most part of pathological rather than of clinical
interest.Although miliary tubercles in the walls of the stomach are more
frequent than is generally supposed, genuine tuberculous ulcers of the
stomach are not common.The most important criterion of these ulcers is
the presence of tuberculous lymphatic glands in the neighborhood, and
of miliary tubercles upon the peritoneum corresponding to the ulcer.Sometimes miliary tubercles can be discovered in the floor and sides of
the ulcer.Tuberculous gastric ulcers, when they occur, are usually
associated with tuberculous ulceration of the intestine.In an
undoubted case of tuberculous ulcer of the stomach reported by Litten,
however, this was the only ulcer to be found in the digestive
tract.[130] Tuberculous gastric ulcers generally produce no symptoms,
but they have been known to cause perforation of the stomach and
haematemesis.Many cases which have been recorded as tuberculous ulcers
of the stomach were in reality simple ulcers.Cheesy tubercles as large
as a pea, both ulcerated and non-ulcerated, have been found in the
stomach, but they are very rare.[Footnote 130: Litten, _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Typhoid ulcers may also occur in the stomach, but they are infrequent.Both perforation of the stomach and gastrorrhagia have been caused by
typhoid ulcers, which, as a rule, however, produce no symptoms
distinctly referable to the ulcer.Syphilitic ulcers and syphilitic cicatrices of the stomach have been
described, without sufficient proof as to their being syphilitic in
origin.Necrotic ulcers, probably mycotic in origin, may be found in the
stomach in cases of splenic fever, erysipelas, pyaemia, etc.Ulceration occurring in toxic, in diphtheritic, and in phlegmonous
gastritis need not be discussed here.Follicular and catarrhal ulcers of the stomach have been described, but
without sufficient ground for separating them from hemorrhagic erosion
on the one hand and simple ulcer on the other.Hemorrhagic erosions of the stomach, to which formerly so much
importance was attached, are now believed to be without clinical
significance.They are found very frequently, and often very
abundantly, after death from a great variety of causes.{530}

CANCER OF THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.DEFINITION.--Cancer of the stomach is characterized anatomically by the
formation in this organ of a new growth, composed of a
connective-tissue stroma so arranged as to enclose alveoli or spaces
containing cells resembling epithelial cells.The growth extends by
invading the tissues surrounding it, and frequently gives rise to
secondary cancerous deposits in other organs of the body.The forms of
cancer which occur primarily in the stomach are scirrhous, medullary,
colloid, and cylindrical epithelial cancer.Rarely latent, occasionally without symptoms
pointing to the stomach as the seat of disease, gastric cancer is
usually attended by the following symptoms: loss of appetite,
indigestion, vomiting with or without admixture with blood, pain, a
tumor in or near the epigastric region, progressive loss of flesh and
strength, and the development of the so-called cancerous cachexia.The
disease is not curable.After its recognition it rarely lasts longer
than from twelve to fifteen months.SYNONYMS.--Carcinoma ventriculi; Malignant disease of the stomach.Of
the many synonyms for the special forms of cancer, the most common
are--for scirrhous, hard, fibrous; for medullary, encephaloid, soft,
fungoid; for colloid, gelatinous, mucoid, alveolar; and for cylindrical
epithelial, cylindrical-celled or cylindrical or columnar epithelioma,
cylindrical-celled cancroid, destructive adenoma.HISTORY.--Cancer of the stomach was known to the ancients only by
certain disturbances of the gastric functions which it produces.The
disease itself was not clearly appreciated until its recognition by
post-mortem examinations, which began to be made with some frequency
after the revival of medicine in the sixteenth century.During the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries several instances of gastric
cancer are recorded, the best described being those observed and
collected by Morgagni (1761).During this period scirrhus was regarded
as the type of cancerous disease.It was a common custom to call only
the ulcerated scirrhous tumors cancerous.With the awakened interest in pathological anatomy which marked the
beginning of the present century, the gross anatomical characters of
cancer and the main forms of the disease came to be more clearly
recognized.After the description of encephaloid cancer by Laennec[1]
in 1812, {531} and the first clear recognition of colloid cancer by
Otto[2] in 1816, these two forms of cancer took rank with scirrhus as
constituting the varieties of cancer of the stomach as well as of
cancer elsewhere.All that it was possible to accomplish in the
description of cancer of the stomach from a purely gross anatomical
point of view reached its culmination in the great pathological works
of Cruveilhier (1829-35) and of Carswell (1838), both of whom admirably
delineated several specimens of gastric cancer.des Sciences med._, t. i. and t.xii., Paris,
1812-15.][Footnote 2: Otto, _Seltens Beobachtungen, etc._, 1816.]During this period of active anatomical research the symptomatology of
gastric cancer was not neglected.The article on cancer by Bayle and
Cayol in the _Dictionnaire des Sciences medicales_, published in 1812,
shows how well the clinical history of gastric cancer was understood at
that period.Cylindrical-celled epithelioma of the stomach could not be recognized
as a separate form of tumor until the application of the microscope to
the study and classification of tumors--an era introduced by Muller in
1838.[3] Cylindrical-celled epithelioma of the stomach was first
recognized by Reinhardt in 1851, was subsequently described by Bidder
and by Virchow, and received a full and accurate description from
Forster in 1858.[4]

[Footnote 3: _Ueber den feineren Ban, etc., der krankh.Geschwulste_,
Berlin, 1838.][Footnote 4: Reinhardt, _Annalen d. Charite_, ii.1, 1851; Bidder,
_Muller's Archiv_, 1852, p.178; Virchow, _Gaz.de Paris_, April
7, 1855; Forster, _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Until the publication by Waldeyer[5] in 1867 of his memorable article
on the development of cancers, it was generally accepted that gastric
cancer originated in the submucous coat of the stomach, and that the
cells in the cancerous alveoli were derived from connective-tissue
cells.Waldeyer attempted to establish for the stomach his doctrine
that all cancers are of epithelial origin.In all varieties of gastric
cancer he believed that he could demonstrate the origin of the
cancer-cells from epithelial cells of the gastric tubules--a mode of
origin which had previously been advocated for cylindrical epithelioma
by Cornil[6] (1864).Waldeyer's view has met with marked favor since
its publication, but there are eminent pathologists who have not given
adherence to it in the exclusive form advocated by its author.[Footnote 5: _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.It is somewhat remarkable that although in the early part of the
present century several monographs on gastric cancer appeared,[7] all
the more recent contributions to the subject are to be found in theses,
scattered journal articles, and text-books.Of the more recent careful
and extensive articles on cancer of the stomach, those of Lebert and of
Brinton are perhaps most worthy of mention.[8]

[Footnote 7: Chardel, Benech, Daniel, Germain, Prus, Sharpey, Barras,
etc.][Footnote 8: Lebert, _Die Krankheiten des Magens_, Tubingen, 1878;
Brinton, _Brit.ETIOLOGY.--The data for estimating the frequency of gastric cancer are
the clinical statistics of hospitals, series of recorded autopsies, and
mortuary registration reports.Statistics with reference to this point based exclusively upon the
clinical material of hospitals have only relative value, as they do not
{532} represent in proper proportion both sexes, all ages, all classes
in life, and all diseases.Statistics based upon autopsies surpass all
others in certainty of diagnosis, but they possess in even greater
degree the defects urged against hospital statistics.Not all the fatal
cases in hospitals are examined post-mortem, and gastric cancer is
among the diseases most likely to receive such examination.Hence
estimates of frequency based exclusively upon autopsies are liable to
be excessive.Estimates from mortuary registration reports, and
therefore from the diagnoses given in death-certificates, rest
manifestly upon a very untrustworthy basis as regards diagnosis, but in
other respects they represent the ideal point of view, including, as
these reports do, all causes of death among all classes of persons.It
is evident that in all methods of estimating the frequency of gastric
cancer inhere important sources of error.In general, the larger the
number of cases upon which the estimates rest the less prominent are
the errors.Such estimates as we possess are to be regarded only as
approximate, and subject to revision.From mortuary statistics Tanchou estimates the frequency of gastric
cancer as compared with that of all causes of death at 0.6 per cent.;
Virchow, at 1.9 per cent.; and D'Espine, at 2-1/2
per cent.[9]

[Footnote 9: Tanchou, _Rech.des Tumeurs du
Sein_, Paris, 1844.These statistics, which are based upon an analysis
of 382,851 deaths in the department of the Seine, are necessarily
subject to sources of error, but they do not seem to me to deserve the
harsh criticisms of Lebert and others.Virchow, _Verhandl.Wurzburg_, 1860, vol.49--analysis of 3390 deaths in Wurzburg during the years 1852-55.Wyss, quoted by Ebstein in _Volkmann's Samml.87--analysis of 4800 deaths in Zurich from 1872-74.D'Espine, _Echo medical_, 1858, vol.ii.--mortuary statistics of the
canton of Geneva, considered to be particularly accurate.]In 8468 autopsies, chiefly from English hospitals, Brinton[10] found
gastric cancer recorded in 1 per cent.Gussenbauer and
Von Winiwarter[11] found gastric cancer recorded in 1-1/2 per cent.of
the 61,287 autopsies in the Pathological Anatomical Institute of the
Vienna University.From an analysis of 11,175 autopsies in Prague, I
find gastric cancer in 3-1/2 per cent.[12]

[Footnote 10: _Loc.cit._]

[Footnote 11: _Arch.[Footnote 12: Statistics of Dittrich, Engel, Willigk, Wrany, and
Eppinger, in _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vols.vii., viii., ix., x.,
xii., xiv., xxvii., l., xciv., xcix., and cxiv.Grunfeld found in 1150
autopsies in the general hospital for aged persons in Copenhagen 102
cancers of the stomach, or 9 per cent.(_Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.I have collected and analyzed with reference to this point the
statistics of death from all causes in the city of New York for the
fifteen years from 1868 to 1882, inclusive.[13] I find that of the
444,564 deaths during this period, cancer of the stomach was assigned
as the cause in 1548 cases and cancer of the liver in 867 cases.Probably at least one-third of the primary cancers of the liver are to
be reckoned as gastric cancers.This would make the ratio of gastric
cancer to all causes of death about 0.4 per cent.(0.93) if only the deaths from twenty years of age
upward be taken: gastric cancer hardly ever occurs under that age.It
is probably fair to conclude that in New York not over 1 in 200 of the
deaths occurring at all ages and from all causes {533} is due to cancer
of the stomach, and that about 1 in 100 of the deaths from twenty years
of age upward is due to this cause.[Footnote 13: These statistics are obtained from the records of the
Board of Health of the city of New York.These records are kept with
great care and system.]The organs most frequently affected with primary cancer are the uterus
and stomach.In order to determine the relative frequency of cancer in
these situations, I have compiled the following table of statistics
from various sources:[14]

    Primary Cancers.-------------------------  --------------  --------------
  11,131 in Vienna           10   per cent.7,150 in New York         25.7  "   "     24.2  "   "
   9,118 in Paris (Tanchou)  25.2  "   "     32.8  "   "
   1,378 in Paris (Salle)    31.9  "   "     32    "   "
     587 in Berlin           35.8  "   "     25    "   "
     183 in Wurzburg         34.9  "   "     19    "   "
   1,046 in Prague           37.6  "   "     33.3  "   "
     889 in Geneva           45    "   "     15.6  "   "
  ------                     ----            ----
  31,482 total               21.4 per cent.From this table it appears that in some collections of cases the uterus
is the most frequent seat of primary cancer, while in other collections
the stomach takes the first rank.If the sum-total of all the cases be
taken, the conclusion would be that about one-fifth of all primary
cancers are seated in the stomach, and somewhat less than one-third in
the uterus.Even if allowance be made for the apparently too low
percentage of cases of gastric cancer in the large Vienna
statistics,[15] I should still be inclined to place the uterus first in
the list of organs most frequently affected with primary cancer, and to
estimate the frequency of gastric cancer compared with that of primary
cancer elsewhere as not over 25 per cent.[Footnote 14: Vienna cases: Gurlt, _Arch.421--statistical analysis of 16,637 tumors observed in the three large
hospitals of Vienna from 1855 to 1878.New York cases: see preceding
foot-note.Paris cases: Tanchou, _op.cit._, and Salle, _Etiologie de
la Carcinose_, These, Paris, 1877, p.145 _et seq._--fatal cases in
Paris hospitals, 1861-63.Berlin cases: Lange, _Ueber den Magenkrebs_,
Inaug.Diss., Berlin, 1877--post-mortem material.Wurzburg cases:
Virchow, _loc.cit._, and _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Prague
cases: reference given above--post-mortem material.Geneva cases:
D'Espine, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 15: That this percentage is too low is apparent from the fact
that the number of cases of gastric cancer is only twice that of
primary cancer of liver in Gurlt's statistics.]The liability to gastric cancer seems to be the same in both sexes.Of
2214 cases of gastric cancer which I have collected from hospital
statistics, and which were nearly all confirmed by autopsy, 1233 were
in males and 981 in females.[16] This makes the ratio of males to
females about 5 to 4.This difference is so slight that no importance
can be attached to it, especially in view of the fact that in most
hospitals the males are in excess of the females.[Footnote 16: My statistics regarding sex are obtained from _Prager
Vierteljahrschr._, vols.xvii., l., xciv., xcix., cxiv.cit._; Katzenellenbogen, _Beitr.zur Statistik d. Magencarcinoms_,
Jena, 1878; Leudet, _Bull.564; Gussenbauer and
V. Winiwarter, _loc.cit._; Habershon, _Diseases of
Abdomen_, Philada., 1879; and _Ann.zu
Munchen_, Bd.If to these accurate statistics be added collections of cases from
heterogeneous sources, including mortuary statistics (Brinton, Louis,
D'Espine, Virchow, Gurlt, Welch), there results a total of 5426 cases,
with 2843 males and 2583 females, the two sexes being more evenly
represented than in the more exact statistics given in the text.In
this collection of cases Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's cases only up
to the year 1855 are included, as the subsequent ones are doubtless in
great part included in Gurlt's statistics.According to Brinton,
gastric cancer is twice as frequent in males as in females.]{534} The following table gives the age in 2038 cases of gastric cancer
obtained from trustworthy sources and arranged according to
decades:[17]

   Age.------      ----------------  ---------
  10-20.2           0.1
  20-30.55           2.7
  30-40.271          13.3
  40-50.499          24.5
  50-60.620          30.4
  60-70.428          21
  70-80.140           6.85
  80-90.20           1
  90-100.2           0.1
  Over 100.1           0.05

From this analysis we may conclude that three-fourths of all gastric
cancers occur between forty and seventy years of age.The absolutely
largest number is found between fifty and sixty years, but, taking into
consideration the number of those living, the liability to gastric
cancer is as great between sixty and seventy years of age.Nevertheless, the number of cases between thirty and forty years is
considerable, and the occurrence of gastric cancer even between twenty
and thirty is not so exceptional as is often represented, and is by no
means to be ignored.The liability to gastric cancer seems to lessen
after seventy years of age, but here the number of cases and the number
of those living are so small that it is hazardous to draw positive
conclusions.[Footnote 17: The sources of the statistics for age are--Dittrich
(160), _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.; D'Espine (117), _loc.cit._; Virchow (63), _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.429; Leudet (69),

(455), _loc.The results correspond
closely to those of the smaller statistics of Brinton and of Lebert.]Cancer of the stomach in childhood is among the rarest of diseases.Steiner and Neureutter[18] failed to find a single gastric cancer in
2000 autopsies on children.Cullingworth[19] has reported with
microscopical examination a case of cylindrical-celled epithelioma in a
male infant dying at the age of five weeks; it is probable that the
tumor was congenital.It is not certain whether Wilkinson's[20]
often-quoted case of congenital scirrhus of the pylorus in an infant
five weeks old was a cancer or an instance of simple hypertrophy.Kaulich[21] cites a case of colloid cancer affecting the stomach,
together with nearly all the abdominal organs, in a child a year and a
half old, but whether the growth in the stomach was primary or
secondary is not mentioned.The case which Widerhofer[22] has reported
as one of cancer of the stomach secondary to cancer of the
retro-peritoneal glands in an infant sixteen days old seems from the
description to be sarcoma.Scheffer[23] has reported a case of large
ulcerated encephaloid cancer of the fundus, involving the spleen, in a
boy fourteen years old.Jackson[24] has reported an interesting case of
encephaloid cancer in a boy fifteen years old in whom no evidence of
disease existed up {535} to ten weeks before death.These cases, which
are all that I have been able to find in children, are to be regarded
as pathological curiosities.[25]

of gastric cancer occurring under thirty-four years of age.Of these, 3
were under twenty and 14 were between twenty and thirty years.He also
emphasizes the error of considering cancer of the stomach as
exclusively a disease of advanced life.]Such statistics as we possess would make it appear that gastric cancer,
as well as cancer in general, is somewhat less common in the United
States than in the greater part of Europe.[26] These statistics,
however, are too inaccurate, and the problems involved in their
interpretation are too complex, to justify us in drawing any positive
conclusions as to this point.It is certain that cancer is not a rare
disease in the United States.[Footnote 26: Of 1000 deaths in New York in 1882, 19.3 were from
cancer.The statistics on this point from some of the large European
cities are--Geneva, 53 deaths from cancer per mille; Frankfort, 47.6;
Copenhagen, 33.2; Christiania, 29; London, 28.7; Paris, 27; Edinburgh,
25.4; Berlin, 22.4; St.Petersburg, 15; Amsterdam, 12.These statistics
are obtained from the _Forty-fourth Annual Report of the
Registrar-General (for 1881)_, London, 1883; from _Preussische
Statistik_, Heft lxiii., Berlin, 1882; and from _Traite de la
Climatologie medicale_, Paris, 1877-80, by Lombard, in whose excellent
work will be found much information on this subject.To judge from statistics in this country and in England, the death-rate
from cancer is undergoing a rapid annual increase.Whereas in New York
in 1868 this death-rate was only 12.6 per mille, in 1882 it was 19.3.In England and Wales in 1858 the deaths from cancer per 1,000,000
persons living were 329, and in 1881 they were 520.It seems probable,
as suggested in the above report of the Registrar-General, that this
apparently increasing large death-rate is due to increased accuracy in
diagnosis.It may be also that decrease in infant mortality and
prolongation of life by improved sanitary regulations may account in
part for this increase.From this point of view Dunn makes the
paradoxical statement that the cancer-rate of a country may be accepted
as an index of its healthfulness (_Brit.Journ._, 1883, i.).]It is said on good authority that in Egypt and Turkey gastric cancer
and other forms of cancer are infrequent.[27] A similar infrequency has
been claimed for South America, the Indies, and in general for tropical
and subtropical countries; but all of these statements as to the
geographical distribution of cancer are to be accepted with great
reserve, as they do not rest upon sufficient statistical information.[Footnote 27: Hirsch, _Handb.d. Historisch-geographische Pathologie_,
Bd.379, Erlangen, 1862-64.]I have analyzed the frequency of gastric cancer among <DW64>s upon a
basis of 7518 deaths among this race in New York, and I find the
proportion of deaths from this cause about one-third less than among
white persons.[28] It has been stated that cancer is an extremely rare
disease among <DW64>s in Africa.[29] The admixture with white blood
makes it difficult to determine to what degree pure <DW64>s in this
country are subject to cancer.[Footnote 28: According to the Ninth Census Report of the United
States, in the census year 1870 the deaths from cancer among white
persons were 13.7 per mille, and among <DW52> persons only 5.7 per
mille; but it is well known that the registration returns upon which
the vital statistics in these reports are based are very incomplete and
unsatisfactory.][Footnote 29: Bordier, _La Geographie medicale_, Paris, 1884, p.Livingstone speaks of the infrequency of cancer among the <DW64>s in
Africa.]The question as to what role is played by heredity in the causation of
gastric cancer belongs to the etiological study of cancer in general.of the cases of cancer it can be
determined that other members of the family are or have been affected
with the disease.[30] {536} The influence of inheritance, therefore, is
apparent only in a comparatively small minority of the cases.As
suggested long ago by Matthew Baillie, this hereditary influence is
better interpreted as in favor of a local predisposition (embryonic
abnormality?)in the organ or part affected than in favor of the
inheritance of a cancerous diathesis.It has been claimed by D'Espine,
Paget, and others that cancer develops at an earlier age when there is
a family history of the disease than when such history is absent.[Footnote 30: This statement is based upon the collection of 1744 cases
of cancer analyzed with reference to this question.Of these, a family
history of cancer was determined in 243 cases.The cases are obtained
from statistics of Paget and Baker, Sibley, Moore, Cooke, Lebert,
Lafond, Hess, Leichtenstern, Von Winiwarter, and Oldekop.There is
extraordinary variation in the conclusions of different observers upon
this point.Velpeau asserted that he could trace hereditary taint in 1
in 3 cancerous subjects; Paget, in 1 in 4; Cripps, in 1 in 28.My
conclusions agree with those obtained at the London Cancer Hospital
(Cooke, _On Cancer_, p.The most remarkable instance of inherited cancer on record is reported
by Broca (_Traite des Tumeurs_, vol.151, Paris, 1866): 15 out of
26 descendants over thirty years of age of a woman who died in 1788 of
cancer of the breast were likewise affected with cancer.As is well
known, Napoleon the First, his father, and his sister died of cancer of
the stomach.]It may be considered established that cancer sometimes develops in a
simple ulcer of the stomach, either open or cicatrized.It is most
likely to develop in large and deep ulcers with thickened edges, where
complete closure by cicatrization is very difficult or impossible.It
is difficult to prove anatomically that a gastric cancer has developed
from an ulcer, and hence such statements as that of Eppinger, that in
11.4 per cent.of cancers of the stomach this mode of development
existed, are of no especial value.[31] No etiological importance can be
attached to the occasional association of cancer with open or
cicatrized simple ulcers in different parts of the same stomach.Of the
comparatively few cases in which strict anatomical proof has been
brought of the origin of cancer in simple gastric ulcer, probably the
most carefully investigated and conclusive is one studied and reported
by Hauser.[32] It is, however, by no means proven that Hauser's view is
correct, that cancer develops from the atypical epithelial growths
often to be found in the cicatricial tissue of gastric ulcer.In a few
instances both the clinical history and the anatomical appearances
speak decisively for the development of cancer in a simple gastric
ulcer;[33] and the establishment of this fact is of clinical
importance.[Footnote 31: _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.[Footnote 32: _Das chronische Maqengeschwur_, Leipzig, 1883, p.See
also Heitler, "Entwicklung von Krebs auf narbigen Grunde in Magen,"
_Wien.Wochenschr._, 1883, p.It seems to me that at present
there is a tendency to exaggerate the frequency with which cancer
develops from gastric ulcer.][Footnote 33: A particularly satisfactory case of this kind is reported
by Lebert, _op.Many other factors in the causation of gastric cancer have been
alleged, but without proof of their efficacy.This is true of chronic
gastritis, which was once thought to be an important cause of gastric
cancer, and is even recently admitted by Leube to be of influence.[34]
Certainly the majority of cases of cancer of the stomach are not
preceded by symptoms of chronic gastritis.Although in a few instances
gastric cancer has followed an injury in the region of the stomach,
there is no reason to suppose that this was more than a coincidence.[Footnote 34: In _Ziemssen's Handb.Few, if any, at present believe that depressing emotions, such as
grief, anxiety, disappointment, which were once considered important
causes of cancer, exert any such influence.Cancer of the stomach
occurs as {537} frequently in those of strong as in those of weak
constitution--as often among the temperate as among the intemperate.If, as has been claimed (D'Espine), gastric cancer is relatively more
frequent among the rich than among the poor, this is probably due only
to the fact that a larger number of those in favorable conditions of
life attain the age at which there is greatest liability to this
disease.No previous condition of constitution, no previous disease, no
occupation, no station in life, can be said to exert any causative
influence in the production of gastric cancer.It will be observed that the obscurity which surrounds the ultimate
causation of gastric cancer is in no way cleared up by the points which
have been here considered and which are usually considered under the
head of etiology.It is impossible to avoid the assumption of an
individual--and in my opinion a local--predisposition to gastric
cancer, vague as this assumption appears.All other supposed causes are
at the most merely occasional or exciting causes.The attempts to
explain in what this predisposition consists are of a speculative
nature, and will be briefly considered in connection with the
pathenogenesis of gastric cancer.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--We may distinguish the following groups of cases of
gastric cancer:

First: Latent cases, in which the cancer of the stomach has produced no
symptoms up to the time of death.Many secondary cancers of the stomach
belong to this class.Here also belong cases in which a cancer is found
unexpectedly in the stomach when death has resulted from other causes.I have found a medullary cancer, slightly ulcerated, as large as a
hen's egg, seated upon the posterior wall and lesser curvature of the
stomach of a laboring man suddenly killed while in apparent health and
without previous complaint of gastric disturbance.These cases, in
which life is cut short before any manifestation of the disease, are
without clinical significance, save to indicate how fallacious it is to
estimate the duration of the cancerous growth from the first appearance
of the symptoms.Second: Cases in which gastric symptoms are absent or insignificant,
whereas symptoms of general marasmus or of progressive anaemia or of
cachectic dropsy are prominent.Cases of this class are frequently
mistaken for pernicious anaemia, and occasionally for Bright's disease,
heart disease, or phthisis.It is difficult to explain in these cases
the tolerance of the stomach for the cancerous growth, but this
tolerance is most frequently manifested when the tumor does not invade
the orifices of the organ.Third: Cases in which the symptoms of the primary gastric cancer are
insignificant, but the symptoms of secondary cancer, particularly of
cancer of the liver or of the peritoneum, predominate.In some, but not
in all, of these cases the primary growth is small or has spared the
orifices of the stomach.Fourth: Cases in which the symptoms point to some disease of the
stomach, or at least to some abdominal disease; but the absence of
characteristic symptoms renders the diagnosis of gastric cancer
impossible or only conjectural.Fifth: Typical cases in which symptoms sufficiently characteristic of
{538} gastric cancer are present, so that the diagnosis can be made
with reasonable positiveness.It is not to be understood that these groups represent sharply-drawn
types of the disease.It often happens that the same case may present
at one period the features of one group, and at another period those of
another group.Nor is it supposed that every exceptional and erratic
case of gastric cancer can be classified in any of the groups which
have been mentioned.[35]

[Footnote 35: In the thesis of Chesnel may be found many curious
clinical disguises which may be assumed by cancer of the stomach, such
as simulation of Bright's disease, heart disease, phthisis, chronic
bronchitis, cirrhosis of the liver, etc.(_Etude clinique sur le Cancer
latent de l'Estomac_, Paris, 1877).Annals Albany_, 1883,
p.207) reports a case of gastric cancer in which extra-uterine
foetation was suspected.]A typical case of gastric cancer runs a course about as follows: A
person, usually beyond middle age, begins to suffer from disordered
digestion.His appetite is impaired, and a sense of uneasiness,
increasing in course of time to actual pain, is felt in the stomach.These symptoms of dyspepsia are in no way peculiar, and probably at
first occasion little anxiety.It is, however, soon observed that the
patient is losing flesh and strength more rapidly than can be explained
by simple indigestion.Vomiting, which was usually absent at first, makes its
appearance and becomes more and more frequent.After a while it may be
that, without any improvement, the vomiting becomes less frequent,
comes on longer after a meal, but is more copious.In the later periods
of the disease a substance resembling coffee-grounds and consisting of
altered blood is often mingled with the vomit.By this time the patient
has assumed a cachectic look.He is wasted, and his complexion has the
peculiar pale yellowish tint of malignant disease.Perhaps there is a
little oedematous pitting about the ankles.During the progress of the
disease in the majority of cases an irregular hard tumor can be felt in
the epigastrium.While one or another of the symptoms may abate in
severity, the general progress of the disease is relentlessly downward.Within six months to two years of the onset of the symptoms the patient
dies of exhaustion.Too much stress should not be laid upon any so-called typical course of
gastric cancer.This course is modified by many circumstances, such as
the situation of the cancer, its size, its rapidity of growth, the
presence or absence of ulceration, the existence or non-existence of
secondary tumors, the presence of complications, and the individuality
of the patient.It is necessary, therefore, to consider in detail each
of the important symptoms of gastric cancer.But in thus fixing
attention upon individual symptoms one must not lose sight of the
clinical picture as a whole.It is not any single symptom which is
decisive; it is rather the combination, the mode of onset, and the
course of the symptoms, which are of most importance in diagnosis.Impairment of the appetite is the rule in gastric cancer.Anorexia is
sometimes a marked symptom before pain, vomiting, and other evidences
of gastric indigestion are noted.There is often a special distaste for
meat.The appetite may be capricious; it is very rarely even increased.There are exceptional cases in which the appetite is preserved
throughout the greater part or even the whole course of the disease.This seems to {539} be more frequent with cancer of the cardia than
with cancer of other parts of the stomach.Loss of appetite is a much
more common symptom in gastric cancer than in gastric ulcer.In cancer,
as well as in ulcer, the patient sometimes refrains from food less on
account of disrelish for it than on account of the distress which it
causes him.Pain is one of the most frequent symptoms of cancer of the stomach.If
the pain begins early in the disease, and continues, as it often does,
with increasing severity, it renders gastric cancer one of the most
distressing affections.The pain is usually felt in the epigastrium,
but it may be more intense in the hypochondria.It is sometimes felt in
the interscapular region, the shoulders, or even in the loins.[36] With
cancer of the cardia it is often referred to the point of the xiphoid
cartilage or behind the sternum.In general, however, there is so
little correspondence between the site of the cancer and the exact
locality of the pain that no weight can be attached to the situation of
the pain in diagnosing the region of the stomach involved in the
growth.Nor does any import attach to the quality of the pain, whether
it is described as burning, gnawing, dull, lancinating, etc.Severe
gastralgic paroxysms occur, although less frequently than in gastric
ulcer.[Footnote 36: The pain in cases of gastric cancer may be felt in parts
of the body remote from the stomach.Thus, in a case of cancer of the
cardia reported by Minot the pain was felt, not in the epigastrium, but
in the left shoulder, the back of the neck, and the pharynx.In several
instances the pain has been interpreted as of renal origin.In a case
of gastric cancer reported by Palmer each attack of vomiting was
invariably preceded by pain in the middle of the shaft of the left
humerus (_Extr.The pain is usually aggravated by ingestion of food, although it may
not become severe until the process of digestion is far advanced.Pain,
however, occurs independently of taking food, and is occasionally a
marked symptom when there are no evidences of dyspepsia.There can be
no doubt that the cancer, as such, produces pain by involvement of the
nerves of the stomach, but there is no specific cancerous pain, such as
has been described by Brinton and other writers.There is usually
tenderness on pressure over the stomach, and this tenderness is often
over the tumor, if such can be felt.In general, it may be said that the pain of gastric cancer, as
contrasted with that of simple gastric ulcer, is often less dependent
upon taking food, less intense, less circumscribed, less paroxysmal,
less often relieved by vomiting; but there is so little constancy about
any of these points that no reliance is to be placed upon any
peculiarity of the pain in the diagnosis of gastric cancer.The observation of several cases of gastric cancer without pain as a
marked symptom leads me to emphasize the fact that absence or trifling
severity of pain throughout the greater part or the whole of the
disease, although exceptional, is not extremely rare.The frequency of
painless gastric cancers is given by Lebert as 25 per cent., and by
Brinton as 8 per cent., of the whole number.For many reasons,
numerical computations as to the frequency of this and of other
symptoms of gastric cancer are of very limited value.[37] Absence of
pain is more common in {540} gastric cancers of old persons and in
cancers not involving the orifices of the stomach than it is at an
earlier period of life or when the gastric orifices are obstructed.[Footnote 37: Gastric cancer cannot be considered as a disease with
uniform characters.It is irrational to group together cancers of the
pylorus, of the cardia, of the fundus, of the curvatures, cancers hard
and soft, ulcerated and not ulcerated, infiltrating and circumscribed,
and to say that pain or vomiting is present in so-and-so many cases of
cancer of the stomach.There is not a sufficient number of recorded
cases in which the symptoms are fully described with reference to the
peculiarities of the growth to enable us to apply to gastric cancer the
numerical method of clinical study with valuable results.The great
discrepancy between Lebert's and Brinton's statistics as to the
frequency of painless cancers of the stomach illustrates the present
inadequacy of the numerical method, which is misleading in so far as it
gives a false appearance of exactness.]The functions of the stomach are almost invariably disordered in
gastric cancer.Sometimes, especially in the early stages, this
disorder is only moderate, and is manifested by the milder symptoms of
indigestion, such as uneasy sensations of weight and fulness after a
meal, nausea, flatulent distension of the stomach relieved by
eructation of gases, and heartburn.With the progress of the disease
the uneasy sensations become actually painful; watery fluids, and
sometimes offensive acrid fluids and gases, are regurgitated; and
nausea culminates in vomiting.The
eructation of inflammable gases has been observed in a few cases.The most troublesome symptoms of indigestion occur with those cancers
which by obstructing the pyloric orifice lead to dilatation of the
stomach.Cases of gastric cancer in which the distressing symptoms of
dilatation of the stomach dominate the clinical history are frequent.These symptoms are in no way peculiar to cancer of the stomach, but
belong to dilatation produced by pyloric stenosis from whatever cause,
and will be described in the article on DILATATION OF THE STOMACH.Various causes combine to impair the normal performance of the gastric
functions in cancer of the stomach.Chronic catarrhal gastritis is a
factor in not a few cases.The destruction by the cancer of a certain
amount of secreting surface can be adduced as a sufficient cause only
in exceptional cases of extensive cancerous infiltration.Of more
importance is interference with the peristaltic movements of the
stomach, particularly in the pyloric region, where the cancer is most
frequently situated.As already mentioned, dilatation of the stomach is
a most important cause of indigestion in many cases.Of great interest
in this connection is the discovery by Von den Velden[38] that as a
rule (to which there are exceptions) the gastric juice in cases of
dilatation of the stomach due to cancer contains no free hydrochloric
acid, and that this gastric juice has comparatively feeble digestive
power, as proven by experiments.As this alteration of the gastric
juice interferes particularly with the digestion of albuminous
substances, it is explicable why many patients with gastric cancer have
an especial abhorrence for meat.[Footnote 38: _Deutsches Arch.During the progress of the disease the dyspeptic symptoms may improve,
but this improvement is usually only temporary.In exceptional cases of
gastric cancer dyspeptic symptoms, as well as other gastric symptoms,
may be absent or not sufficiently marked to attract attention.Hiccough, sometimes very troublesome, has been observed not very
infrequently during the later periods of the disease.There is nothing noteworthy about the appearance of the tongue, which
is often clean and moist, but may be furred or abnormally red and dry.In the cachectic stage, toward the end of the disease, aphthous patches
{541} often appear on the tongue and buccal mucous membrane.An
increased flow of saliva has been occasionally observed in gastric
cancer as well as in other diseases of the stomach.Thirst is present
when there is profuse vomiting.Vomiting usually appears after other symptoms of indigestion have been
present for some time.It may, however, be one of the earliest symptoms
of the disease.At first of occasional occurrence, it increases in
frequency until in some cases it becomes the most prominent of all
symptoms.Vomiting may occur in paroxysms which last for several days
or weeks, and then this symptom may improve, perhaps to be renewed
again and again, with remissions of comparative comfort.There are rare
cases of gastric cancer in which the first symptom to attract attention
is uncontrollable vomiting, accompanied often with pain and rapid
emaciation.Such cases may run so acute a course that a fatal
termination is reached within one to two months.[39] In these cases,
which have been interpreted as acutely-developed gastric cancers, it is
probable that the cancer has remained latent for weeks or months before
it gave rise to marked symptoms.[Footnote 39: For example, Andral relates a case in which death took
place thirty-seven days after the onset of the symptoms, these being
obstinate vomiting, severe gastralgic paroxysms, marasmus, and, about
ten days before death, profuse black vomit.There was found a fungoid
tumor the size of a hen's egg projecting into the cavity of the stomach
near the pylorus.In this situation the walls of the stomach were
greatly thickened by colloid growth (_Arch.Here may also be mentioned the fact that in several instances pregnancy
has been complicated with gastric cancer.Here the uncontrollable
vomiting which often exists has been referred to the pregnancy, and has
led to the production of premature labor.]The situation of the cancer exerts great influence upon the frequency
of vomiting and the time of its occurrence after meals.When the cancer
involves the pyloric orifice, vomiting is rarely absent, and generally
occurs an hour or more after a meal.As this is the most frequent
situation of the cancer, it has been accepted as a general rule that
vomiting occurs at a longer interval after eating in cases of gastric
cancer than in cases of simple ulcer.But even with pyloric cancer the
vomiting may come on almost immediately after taking food, so that it
is not safe to diagnose the position of the cancer by the length of
time between eating and the occurrence of vomiting.As the cancer in
its growth obstructs more and more the pyloric orifice, the vomiting
acquires the peculiarities of that accompanying dilatation of the
stomach.The vomiting comes on longer after a meal--sometimes not until
twelve or twenty hours or even more have elapsed.It may be that
several days elapse between the acts of vomiting, which then present a
certain periodicity.The patient then vomits enormous quantities
containing undigested food, mucus, sarcinae, and gaseous and other
products of fermentation.Sometimes, especially toward the end of the
disease, the vomiting ceases altogether.This cessation has been
attributed to reopening of the pyloric orifice by sloughing of the
growth.It is not necessary to assume such an occurrence, as a similar
cessation of vomiting sometimes occurs in dilatation of the stomach due
to persistent stenosis of the pylorus.Cessation of vomiting in these
cases is by no means always a favorable symptom.Next to pyloric cancer, it is cancer involving the cardiac orifice
which is most frequently accompanied by vomiting.Here the vomiting
occurs often immediately after taking food, but there are exceptions to
this rule.{542} If in consequence of stenosis of the cardiac orifice
the food does not enter the stomach, it is shortly regurgitated
unchanged or mingled simply with mucus.It is this regurgitation rather
than actual vomiting which in most common and characteristic of cardiac
cancer.Even in cases in which the passage of an oesophageal sound
reveals no obstruction at the cardiac orifice it sometimes happens that
food, including even liquids, is regurgitated almost immediately, as in
a case reported by Ebstein in which cold water was returned at once
after swallowing.[40] In these cases Ebstein with great plausibility
refers the regurgitation to reflex spasm of the oesophagus induced by
irritation of a cancer at or near the cardia through contact of food or
liquids, especially when cold, with its surface.[Footnote 40: "Ueber den Magenkrebs," _Volkmann's Samml.When the cancer is seated in other parts of the stomach and it does not
obstruct the orifices, vomiting is more frequently absent or of only
rare occurrence.Vomiting is absent, according to Lebert, in one-fifth,
according to Brinton in about one-eighth, of the cases of gastric
cancer.Absence of vomiting is sufficiently frequent in gastric cancer
to guard one against excluding the diagnosis of this disease on this
ground alone.Although in many cases the vomiting of gastric cancer can be explained
on mechanical grounds by stenosis of the orifices, this is an
explanation not applicable to all cases.Mention has already been made
of spasm of the oesophagus as a cause of regurgitation of food in some
cases of cardiac cancer.A similar spasm of the muscle in the pyloric
region may explain the vomiting in certain cases in which during life
there were symptoms of pyloric stenosis, but after death no or slight
stenosis can be found.There is reason also to believe that atony of
the muscular coats of the stomach may cause stagnation of the contents
of the stomach and dilatation of the organ.In exceptional cases of
gastric cancer in which the stomach is so intolerant as to reject food
almost immediately after its entrance a special irritability of the
nerves of the stomach must be assumed.It is customary to refer this
form of vomiting to irritation of the ulcerated surface of the cancer
by analogy with a similar irritability of the stomach observed in some
cases of simple gastric ulcer.But there is little analogy between the
ulcerated surface of a cancer in which tissues of little vitality and
irritability are exposed and the surface of a simple ulcer in which the
normal or slightly altered tissues of the stomach are laid bare.Finally, in the existence of chronic catarrhal gastritis is to be found
another cause of vomiting in many cases of gastric cancer.The presence of fragments of the cancer in the contents removed by
washing out the stomach with the stomach-tube has been observed by
Rosenbach[41] in three cases of gastric cancer, and utilized for
diagnostic purposes.A cancerous structure could be made out in these
fragments by the aid of the microscope.Hitherto, the presence of
particles of the tumor in the vomited matter has been considered as
hardly more than a curiosity, and I have not been able to find a
well-authenticated instance in which such particles in the vomit have
been recognized by microscopical examination.According to Rosenbach,
the fragments of the tumor in the washings from the stomach can be
recognized by the naked eye by the red, reddish-brown, or black specks
on their surface, due to recent or old hemorrhages which have aided in
the detachment of the fragments.{543} By this means such particles are
distinguished macroscopically from bits of food.By employing
soft-rubber tubes and the syphon process there is no danger, in washing
out of the stomach, of detaching pieces of the normal mucous membrane,
which, moreover, can be distinguished from the fragments of the tumor
by the aid of the microscope and usually by the naked eye.It remains
to be seen how frequently such fragments of the tumor are to be found
in the fluids obtained by washing out the stomach.It is not probable
that they will be found so often as Rosenbach anticipates.According to
the experience of most observers, they are very rarely present.They
would naturally be most readily detached from soft, fungoid, and
ulcerating cancerous growths.In this connection may also be mentioned
the occasional separation of bits of the tumor by the passage of the
stomach-tube in cases of cancer of the cardia.The eye of the tube as
well as the washings from the stomach should be carefully examined for
such particles.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.The habitual absence of free hydrochloric acid in the gastric fluids in
dilatation of the stomach due to carcinoma of this organ was noted by
Von der Velden.[42] He found in eight cases of dilatation due to cancer
of the pylorus that the fluids removed by the stomach-pump were free
from hydrochloric acid, whereas in ten cases of dilatation due to other
causes, such as cicatrized simple ulcer of the pylorus, free
hydrochloric acid was only temporarily absent from the gastric juice.Von der Velden therefore attributes to the presence or the absence of
free hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice in these cases great
diagnostic importance.The observations which have followed Von der
Velden's publication are not yet sufficient to justify us in drawing
positive conclusions in this matter.Recently, Kredel[43] has reported
from Riegel's clinic seventeen cases of simple dilatation in which free
hydrochloric acid was only exceptionally and temporarily absent from
the gastric fluids, and nineteen cases of cancerous dilatation in
which, with very rare exceptions, free hydrochloric acid was
continuously absent.Cases, however, have been observed by Ewald,
Seeman, and others in which free hydrochloric acid has been found in
stomachs dilated from gastric cancer.It is to be noted that free
hydrochloric acid is absent from the stomach in other conditions than
in gastrectasia due to cancer; of which conditions the most important
are fever, amyloid degeneration of the stomach (Edinger), and some
cases of gastric catarrh.Free hydrochloric acid is also usually absent
during the first twenty minutes to an hour after a meal.We have not
sufficient information as to the presence or absence of free
hydrochloric acid in cases of gastric cancer without dilatation of the
stomach.To Von der Velden's symptom no pathognomonic value can be
attached, but it may prove, in connection with other symptoms, an aid
in diagnosis.The presumption is against gastric cancer if free
hydrochloric acid be found continuously in a dilated stomach.Less
importance can be attached to the absence of free hydrochloric acid
unless the observations extend over several weeks and fever and amyloid
degeneration are excluded.[Footnote 42: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 43: _Zeitschrift f. klin.The tests for free hydrochloric acid are most satisfactorily applied to
the fluids withdrawn by the stomach-pump.After a sufficient quantity
for examination has been withdrawn the syphon process may be {544}
substituted.Tests may also be applied to vomited material, although
here the admixture of secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat may
render the results less conclusive.Edinger's method of swallowing bits
of sponge enclosed in gelatin capsules and attached to a string, by
which they can be withdrawn, may also be employed.The sponge should be
free from sand, deprived of alkaline carbonates by hydrochloric acid,
and rendered perfectly neutral by washing in distilled water.For clinical purposes the most convenient tests are those which depend
upon certain changes in color produced in reagents which enable us to
distinguish inorganic from organic acids.In the gastric juice the only
inorganic acid which comes into consideration is hydrochloric acid, and
the most important organic acid is lactic.Saturated aqueous solutions of tropaeolin, marked in the trade OO
(Von Miller, V. d. Velden).The solution should be perfectly clear and
of a lemon-yellow color.This solution is  red by the addition
of hydrochloric acid even in very dilute solution (0.01 per cent.).A
similar change in color is produced by lactic acid in somewhat less
dilute solution (0.06 per cent.), but the red color produced by lactic
acid disappears upon shaking with ether, while that produced by
hydrochloric acid remains, unless the acid was present in very minute
quantity.Tropaeolin is therefore a very delicate test for free acid in
general, but it does not distinguish so well as some other tests
hydrochloric from lactic acid.Aqueous solution of methyl-violet (an aniline dye) in the strength
of 0.025 per cent.The solution should be of a violet
color, and in a test-tube should allow the light to pass readily
through it.The addition of hydrochloric acid in dilute solution
changes the violet to a blue color, in stronger solution to a greenish
tint.With lactic acid in stronger solution methyl-violet gives a
similar but less distinct reaction.Methyl-violet, while a less
delicate test than tropaeolin, is better adapted for distinguishing
hydrochloric from lactic acid.Ferric chloride and carbolic acid test (Uffelmann).Daniel went to the garden.Mix 3 drops of
liquor ferri chloridi (German Pharmacopoeia, specific gravity 1482), 3
drops of very concentrated solution of carbolic acid, and 20 ccm.The addition of even very dilute solutions of lactic
acid (0.05 per cent.)changes the amethyst-blue color of this
test-fluid to a yellow color, with a shade of green.Dilute solutions
of hydrochloric acid produce a steel-gray, and stronger solutions a
complete decolorization of the fluid.When both hydrochloric and lactic
acids are present the effect of the lactic acid predominates unless
only a mere trace of it is present.This is therefore a good test for
lactic acid.It is necessary to prepare the test-fluid fresh each time
before using.It is well to test the digestive power of the filtered fluid from
the stomach by suspending in the fluid a floccule of washed fibrin and
keeping the fluid at a temperature of about 100 degrees F. If free
hydrochloric acid be present in moderate quantity, in a short time the
fibrin will begin to be dissolved, but if the acidity be due to organic
acid the fibrin will be dissolved very slowly or not at all.In applying these various tests the fluids from the stomach should be
filtered and the filtrate used.It is best not to rely upon a single
test, but to employ them in combination.The fluids may be mixed in a
test-tube.The reaction is sometimes most distinct when the fluids are
allowed {545} to mingle upon a white porcelain dish.It is sometimes of
advantage to concentrate the mingled fluids by evaporation.The fluid
obtained by the stomach-pump five or six hours after a meal is the most
suitable for diagnostic tests.The presence of peptones and of
dissolved albumen makes the tests less delicate for the gastric fluids
than for simple aqueous solutions of the acids.[44]

It is important to distinguish between the slight and the copious
hemorrhages of gastric cancer.The admixture of a small quantity of blood with the vomit, giving to
the latter the so-called coffee-grounds appearance, is a very common
occurrence in gastric cancer.Melaenamesis, as the vomiting of brown or
black substance resembling coffee-grounds is called, is estimated to
occur in about one-half of the cases of cancer of the stomach.It is
observed particularly in the cachectic stage, in which it is not rare
for some brown or black sediment to be almost constantly present in the
vomit.The brown or black color is due to the conversion by the acids
of the stomach of the normal blood-coloring matter into dark-brown
haematin.The presence of blood in the vomited matter can generally be recognized
by the naked eye.By the aid of the microscope red blood-corpuscles,
more or less changed, especially decolorized red blood-corpuscles (the
so-called shadows), can usually be detected.John moved to the bathroom.Sometimes only amorphous
masses of altered blood-pigment can be seen.The spectroscope may also
be employed, in which alkaline solutions of haematin produce an
absorption-band between C and D, usually reaching or passing D. The
presence of blood-coloring matter can also be readily detected by the
production of haemin crystals.[45] The slight hemorrhages are in most
cases the result of ulceration of the cancer, by which process a little
oozing of blood from the capillaries is produced.[Footnote 45: Haemin crystals may be produced by boiling in a test-tube
a little of the suspected fluid or sediment with an excess of glacial
acetic acid and a few particles of common salt.After cooling, a drop
from the lower layers will show under the microscope the dark-brown
rhombic crystals of haemin in case blood-coloring matter was present in
not too minute quantity.]Copious hemorrhages from the stomach are not common in gastric cancer.They occur probably in not over 12 per cent.According to Lebert, they are more liable to occur in males than in
females.Blood vomited in large quantity is either bright red or more
or less darkened in color according to the length of its sojourn in the
stomach.Following profuse haematemesis, some dark, tarry blood is
usually passed by the stools, constituting the symptom called melaena.Copious hemorrhages from the stomach hasten the fatal termination and
may be its immediate forerunner.Cases of gastric cancer have been
reported in which death has occurred from gastrorrhagia before there
has been time for any blood to be either vomited or voided by stool.As
might naturally be expected, patients with gastric cancer do not
usually rally as readily from the effects of gastric hemorrhage as do
most patients with simple ulcer.Profuse gastric hemorrhage, if it
occur, is most common in the late stage of gastric cancer, but I have
known a {546} case of cancer of the stomach in which copious
haematemesis was the first symptom, with the exception of slight
dyspepsia.[46]

[Footnote 46: In a case of cancer of the lesser curvature observed by
Laborie fatal haematemesis occurred before there had been any distinct
symptoms of gastric cancer (Bouchut, _Nouv.Profuse haematemesis is more common with soft cancers than with other
forms.The source of profuse hemorrhage is in some large vessel eroded
by the ulcerative process.The same vessels may be the source of the
bleeding as have been enumerated in connection with gastric ulcer.Cancers situated near the pylorus or on the lesser curvature are the
most likely to cause severe hemorrhage.While it is true that coffee-grounds vomiting is most common in cancer,
and profuse haematemesis is most common in ulcer of the stomach, it is
important to remember that either disease may be attended by that form
of hemorrhage which is most common in the other.Dysphagia is one of the most important symptoms of cancer of the
cardia.Dysphagia is sometimes one of the first symptoms to attract
attention, but it may not appear until late in the disease.It is
usually accompanied with painful sensations near the xiphoid cartilage
or behind the sternum, or sometimes in the pharynx.The sensation of
stoppage of the food is usually felt lower down than in ordinary cases
of stenosis of the oesophagus.Stenosis of the cardia can be
appreciated by the passage of an oesophageal bougie, but it is
important to bear in mind that dysphagia may exist in cases of cancer
of the cardia in which the oesophageal bougie does not reveal evidence
of stenosis.Dysphagia may be a prominent symptom in cancer occupying
parts of the stomach remote from the cardia.[47] The dysphagia here
considered is not likely to be confounded with the difficulty in
swallowing which is due to weakness or to aphthous inflammation of the
throat and gullet, which often attends the last days of gastric cancer.[Footnote 47: A case in point has been reported by J. B. S. Jackson.The cancer occupied the pyloric region (_American Journ.Sci._,
April, 1852, p.From a diagnostic point of view the presence of a tumor is the most
important symptom of gastric cancer.In the absence of tumor the
diagnosis of gastric cancer can rarely be made with positiveness.A
tumor of the stomach can be felt in about 80 per cent.of the cases of
cancer of the stomach (Brinton, Lebert).With all of its importance, it
is nevertheless possible to exaggerate the diagnostic value of this
symptom.It is by no means always easy to determine whether an existing
tumor belongs to the stomach or not, and even if there is proved to be
a tumor of the stomach, there may be difficulty in deciding whether or
not it is a cancer.Many instances might be cited in which errors in
these respects have been made by experienced diagnosticians.The value
of tumor as a diagnostic symptom is somewhat lessened by the fact that
it often does not appear until comparatively late in the disease, so
that the diagnosis remains in doubt for a long time.It is to be
remembered also that tumor is absent in no less than one-fifth of the
cases of gastric cancer.In order to understand in what situations cancers of the stomach are
likely to produce palpable tumors, it is necessary to have in mind
certain points concerning the situation and the relations of this
organ.The stomach is placed obliquely in the left hypochondrium and the
epigastric regions of the abdomen, approaching the vertical more nearly
{547} than the horizontal position.The mesial plane of the body passes
through the pyloric portion of the stomach, so that, according to
Luschka, five-sixths of the stomach lie to the left of this plane.The
most fixed part of the stomach is the cardiac orifice, which lies
behind the left seventh costal cartilage, near the sternum, and is
overlapped by the left extremity of the liver.The pyloric orifice lies
usually in the sagittal plane passing through the right margin of the
sternum, and on a level with the inner extremity of the right eighth
costal cartilage.The pylorus is less fixed than the cardia.When the
stomach is empty the pylorus is to be found in the median line of the
body; when the stomach is greatly distended the pylorus may be pushed
two and a half to three inches to the right of the median line.The
pylorus is overlapped by a part of the liver, usually the lobus
quadratus or the umbilical fissure.About two-thirds of the stomach lie
in the left hypochondrium covered in by the ribs, and to the left and
posteriorly by the spleen.The highest point of the stomach is the top
of the fundus, which usually reaches to the left fifth rib.The lowest
point of the stomach is in the convexity of the greater curvature to
the left of the median line.The lower border of the stomach varies in
position more than any other part of the organ.In the median line this
border is situated on the average about midway between the base of the
xiphoid cartilage and the umbilicus, but within the limits of health it
may extend nearly to the umbilicus.The lesser curvature in the greater
part of its course extends from the cardia downward to the left of the
vertebral column and nearly parallel with it.The lesser curvature then
crosses to the right side on a level with the inner extremity of the
eighth rib, and in the median line lies about two and a half fingers'
breadth above the lower margin of the stomach.The lesser curvature and
the adjacent part of the anterior surface of the stomach are covered by
the left lobe of the liver.It follows from this description that only the lower part of the
anterior surface of the stomach is in contact with the anterior
abdominal walls.This part in contact with the anterior abdominal walls
corresponds to a part of the body and of the pyloric region of the
stomach, and belongs to the epigastric region.The remainder of the
stomach is covered either by the liver or by the ribs, so that in the
normal condition it cannot be explored by palpation.It is now evident that tumors in certain parts of the stomach can be
readily detected by palpation, whereas tumors in other parts of the
organ can be detected only with difficulty or not at all.Cancer of the
cardia cannot be felt by palpation of the abdomen unless the tumor
extends down upon the body of the stomach.Cancers of the fundus, the
lesser curvature, and the posterior wall of the stomach often escape
detection by palpation, but if they are of large size or if the stomach
becomes displaced by their growth, they may be felt.Cancerous tumors
of the anterior wall or of the greater curvature are rare, but they can
be detected even when of small size, unless there are special obstacles
to the physical examination of the abdomen.Cancerous tumors of the
pylorus can be made out by palpation in the majority of cases
notwithstanding the overlapping of this part by the liver.The pyloric
tumor may be so large as to project from beneath the border of the
liver, or the hand may be pressed beneath this border so that the tumor
can be felt, or, what is most frequently the {548} case, the weight of
the tumor or the distension of the stomach drags the pylorus downward.The pylorus may, however, be so fixed by adhesions underneath the
liver, or the liver may be so enlarged, that tumors of this part cannot
be reached by palpation.The situation in which cancerous tumors of the pylorus can be felt
varies considerably.The usual situation is in the lower part of the
epigastric region, a little to the right of the median line, but it is
almost as common for these tumors to be felt in the umbilical region,
and it is not rare for them to appear to the left of the median
line.[48] Brinton states that the tumor is in the umbilical region more
frequently in the female sex than in the male, in consequence of the
compression exercised by corsets.Occasionally pyloric cancers produce
tumors in the right hypochondrium.Exceptionally, pyloric tumors have
been felt as low as the iliac crest or even in the hypogastric region.[Footnote 48: According to Jackson and Tyson, pyloric cancers are felt
more frequently to the left than to the right of the median line.]Cancers of the stomach do not usually attain a very large size.An important criterion of
cancerous tumors of the stomach is their gradual increase in size by
progressive growth.The consistence of cancerous tumors of the stomach is nearly always
hard, as appreciated by palpation through the abdominal walls.The
surface of the tumor is usually nodulated or irregular, but
exceptionally it is smooth.The tumor may be movable or not, but in the
majority of cases it is rendered immovable by adhesions.Mobility of
the tumor, however, does not exclude the presence of adhesions.The
tumor sometimes follows the respiratory movements of the diaphragm,
especially when it is adherent to this structure or to the liver, but
more frequently the tumor is not affected or but slightly affected by
the movements of the diaphragm.If the tumor is not fixed by adhesions,
it may change its position somewhat according to the varying degrees of
distension of the stomach or in consequence of pressure of intestine
distended with gas or feces.In consequence of these movements or of an
overlying distended colon the tumor may even disappear temporarily.It
is possible that the tumor may lessen or disappear in consequence of
sloughing of the growth.[49] It is not rare for a certain amount of
pulsation to be communicated to the growth by the subjacent aorta.This
pulsation is most common with pyloric tumors.[Footnote 49: Symptoms which have been considered as diagnostic of
sloughing of stenosing cancers of the pylorus are diminution in the
size of the tumor, alleviation of the vomiting, hemorrhage, replacement
of obstinate constipation by diarrhoeal stools which often contain
blood, increased pain after eating, and rapid progress of cachexia.]The percussion note over the tumor is usually tympanitic dulness.Sometimes there is very little alteration over the tumor of the normal
tympanitic note belonging to the stomach; on the other hand,
exceptionally there is absolute flatness over the tumor.It is often of assistance in determining that a tumor belongs to the
pylorus to find dilatation of the stomach.An abnormal fulness of the
epigastric and umbilical regions may then be observed, and through the
abdominal walls, if thin, may be seen the peristaltic movements of the
stomach.Other signs and symptoms aid in the diagnosis of dilatation of
the stomach, and will be described in connection with this disease.{549} It is to be noted that what one takes to be the primary tumor of
the stomach is not so very rarely a secondary cancerous mass in the
stomach or in adjacent lymph-glands or in the peritoneum.Such nodules
may also increase the apparent size of the original tumor.As has been
pointed out by Rosenbach,[50] spasm of the muscular coat near a cancer
or an ulcer of the stomach may produce a false tumor or enlarge a real
tumor.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.The cancer, instead of appearing as a circumscribed tumor, may
infiltrate diffusely the gastric walls, and so escape detection.When
the greater part or the whole of the stomach is the seat of this
diffuse cancerous infiltration, a sense of abnormal resistance may be
appreciated by palpation in the epigastric region.In these cases the
stomach is often much shrunken in size.The outlines of the thickened
organ can sometimes be made out, but the physical signs do not suffice
for the diagnosis of cancer.With cancer of the cardia there is usually more or less atrophy of the
stomach, which is manifested by sinking in of the epigastric region.Sometimes the tumor eludes discovery on account of special obstacles to
the physical examination of the abdomen, such as a thick layer of fat
in the abdominal walls or a large quantity of ascitic fluid.Every aid
in the physical examination of the abdomen should be resorted to.The
patient should be examined while lying on his back with the utmost
possible relaxation of the abdominal walls.If necessary, he should
also be examined while standing or in the knee-elbow position.Sometimes a deep inspiration will force down a previously concealed
tumor.The emptying of a dilated stomach by means of a stomach-tube
will sometimes bring to prominence a gastric tumor.The inflation of the stomach by the development in it of carbonic acid
gas may render valuable assistance in the diagnosis of tumors of this
organ and of surrounding parts.This method has been recommended by W.
Ph.H. Wagner among others, and especially by Rosenbach.[51] From 20 to
30 grains of bicarbonate of soda and from 15 to 20 grains of tartaric
acid may be introduced into the stomach.The soda, dissolved in
lukewarm water, may be given first and followed by the acid in
solution, or, better, the mixed powders may be swallowed in the dry
state and followed by a tumblerful of water.Some persons require a
larger quantity of the powder in order to inflate the stomach.Occasionally the introduction of the effervescing powder fails to
produce any appreciable distension of the stomach.This negative result
may be due to the escape of the gas into the intestine in consequence
of incontinence of the pylorus--a condition which Ebstein[52] has
observed and described especially in connection with pyloric cancer.When this pyloric insufficiency exists the resulting tympanitic
distension of the intestine is a hindrance to palpation of tumors of
the stomach.Failure to secure distension of the stomach is not always
due to this cause.It may be necessary to make repeated trials of the
effervescing mixture.It is well to have a stomach-tube at hand to
evacuate the gas if this should cause much distress.H. Wagner, _Ueber die Percussion des Magens nach
Auftreibung mit Kohlensaure_, Marburg, 1869; O. Rosenbach, _Deutsche
med.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.[Footnote 52: W. Ebstein, _Volkmann's Samml.In some respects simpler and more easily controlled is the method of
{550} distending the stomach by injecting air into it through a
stomach-tube, as recommended by Runeberg.[53] For this purpose the
balloon of a Richardson's spray apparatus may be attached to a
soft-rubber stomach-tube.In this way the desired quantity of air can
be introduced and at any time allowed to escape through the tube.[Footnote 53: J. W. Runeberg, _Deutsches Arch.When the stomach has been inflated the contours of tumors of the
pylorus often become surprisingly distinct in consequence of the
changes in the position and the shape of the stomach.When the tumor is
fixed by adhesions, it may be possible to follow the contours of the
stomach into those of the tumor.False tumors produced by spasm of the
muscular walls of the stomach may be made to disappear by this
distension of the organ.This procedure enables one to distinguish
between tumors behind and those in front of the stomach, as the former
become indistinct or disappear when the stomach is inflated.By
bringing out the contours of the stomach the relations of the tumor to
surrounding organs may be rendered for the first time clear.Assistance
in diagnosis may also be afforded by distension of the colon with water
or with gas or with air, per rectum, in order to determine the course
of the colon and its relations to abdominal tumors (Mader, Ziemssen,
Runeberg).A manifest contraindication to distension of the stomach or
of the colon with gas exists if there is a suspicion that the coats of
these parts are so thinned by ulceration that they might rupture from
the distending force of the gas.There have been no cases recorded
where such an accident has happened.Only in exceptional cases are the bowels regular throughout the course
of gastric cancer.Constipation is the rule, and not infrequently there
is obstinate constipation.This is to be expected when the patient eats
little and vomits a great deal, or when there is stenosis of the
pylorus.In cancer, as in many other diseases of the stomach, the
peristaltic movements of the intestine are inclined to be sluggish.Occasional diarrhoea is also common in gastric cancer, being present,
according to Tripier,[54] at some period or other in over one-half the
cases.Constipation often gives place to diarrhoea during the last
months or during the last days of life.In other periods of the disease
diarrhoea not infrequently alternates with constipation.In rare cases
diarrhoea is an early symptom, and it may be present exceptionally
throughout the greater part of the disease.The irritation of
undigested food sometimes explains the diarrhoea.When diarrhoea is
persistent there probably exists catarrhal inflammation of the large
intestine, or in some instances there may be diphtheritic and
ulcerative inflammation of the colon, causing dysenteric symptoms
during the last stages of cancer of the stomach.[Footnote 54: "Etude clinique sur la Diarrhee dans le Cancer de
l'Estomac," _Lyon Med._, 1881, Nos.Black stools containing altered blood occur for some days after profuse
gastric hemorrhage.It is important to examine the stools for blood, as
bleeding may occur from cancer of the stomach without any vomiting of
blood.There is no change in the urine characteristic of gastric cancer.Deposits of urates are not uncommon.If there be profuse vomiting or
frequent washing out of the stomach, the urine often becomes alkaline
from fixed {551} alkali.[55] The amount of urea is diminished in
consequence of the slight activity of the nutritive processes of the
body.Rommelaere attaches unmerited diagnostic importance to this
diminution of urea.A similar diminution of urea occurs in other like
states of depressed nutrition.[Footnote 55: According to Quincke, when the acid in the stomach is not
hydrochloric acid, but organic acid resulting from fermentation, then
vomiting and washing out the stomach do not reduce the acidity of the
urine (_Zeitschrift f. klin.Albuminuria does not belong to the history of gastric cancer, although
a small quantity of albumen may be present in the urine as in other
anaemic and cachectic conditions.A larger quantity of albumen may be
due to parenchymatous and fatty degeneration of the kidney or to
chronic diffuse nephritis, which are infrequent but recognized
complications of gastric cancer.There is often an excess of indican in
the urine, to which, however, no diagnostic significance can be
attached.The urine in gastric cancer sometimes contains an excess of aceton, or
at least of some substance which yields aceton upon the application of
various tests.This so-called acetonuria is present without any
symptoms referable to it, so far as we know.Allied to this so-called
acetonuria is that condition of the urine in which it is 
burgundy-red upon the addition of ferric chloride in solution
(Gerhardt's reaction).It is not positively known what substance
imparts this last reaction to the urine.V. Jaksch, who has studied the
subject industriously, believes that the red coloring substance is
diacetic acid, and he proposes to call the condition diaceturia.Fresh
urine, which shows in a marked degree Gerhardt's reaction, often has a
peculiar aromatic, fruity odor, as has also the expired air.Gerhardt's
reaction has been studied mostly in diabetic urine, but it occurs
sometimes in cases of gastric cancer and in a variety of diseases.This
so-called diaceturia may be associated with a peculiar form of coma,
but it is oftener observed without any symptoms referable to it[56]
(see page 555).[Footnote 56: The various tests for aceton in the urine are not
altogether satisfactory.They are to be found in an article by Von
Jaksch in the _Zeitschrift f. klin.For
English readers a good abstract of an article by Penzoldt on these
tests and on acetonaemia in general is to be found in _The Medical
News_ of Philadelphia, Aug.162, but this does not consider
the corrections and additions to be found in V. Jaksch's article cited
above.Acetonuria has been observed especially in diabetes mellitus,
fevers, carcinoma, and dyspepsia.The substance which produces Gerhardt's reaction is to be distinguished
from other substances which may be present in the urine and give a red
color with ferric chloride--first, by the fact that boiling the urine
in a test-tube for five or six minutes destroys the first-named
substance, or causes the red color to disappear in case this has been
produced by ferric chloride; and, secondly, by the fact that ether
extracts the substance from acidified urine, and that the red color
produced in the ether extract by ferric chloride (it may be necessary
to first neutralize the acid) fades away in the course of a few days
(V. Jaksch, _Zeitschrift f. Heilkunde_, Bd.Urines which
respond to Gerhardt's reaction in a marked degree yield aceton on
distillation, but aceton or an aceton-yielding substance may be present
in considerable quantity without response of the urine to Gerhardt's
test.]Disorders of nutrition embrace an important group of symptoms, such as
loss of flesh and strength, impoverished blood, and cachectic color of
the skin.Emaciation and debility are sometimes the first symptoms of
gastric cancer to attract attention, and often the first symptoms to
arouse anxiety.More frequently these symptoms of disordered nutrition
first appear after dyspeptic ailments or pain have existed for several
weeks or months.It may aid in the diagnosis of gastric cancer to weigh
the patient {552} from time to time, as carcinoma is generally attended
by progressive loss of weight.The patient frequently becomes morose and depressed in spirits.His
strength fails, sometimes disproportionately to the loss of flesh.There is no disease in which emaciation becomes more extreme than in
cases of gastric cancer.In many cases profound anaemia develops, and sometimes in such a degree
that this symptom cannot be regarded always as simply co-ordinate with
the other disorders of nutrition, but is to be regarded rather as an
evidence of some special disturbance of the blood-forming organs.The
blood may present the same changes as are observed in pernicious
anaemia, such as extreme reduction in the number of red
blood-corpuscles (to one million or even half that number in a cubic
millimeter) and manifold deformed shapes of the corpuscles
(poikilocytosis).In extreme cases the proportion of haemoglobin in the
blood may be reduced to 50 or 60 per cent.[57]
There is occasionally a moderate increase in the number of white
blood-corpuscles.In one case of gastric cancer I observed a
leucocytosis in which there was one white to twenty red
blood-corpuscles without enlargement of the spleen.[58]

[Footnote 57: The granular disintegrating corpuscles
(Zerfallskorperchen of Riess) may also be found in the blood in
considerable number.Leichtenstern has observed that toward the end of
life the relative proportion of haemoglobin in the blood may be
increased, sometimes rapidly, and may even exceed the normal limit.This is due to concentration of the blood in consequence of the loss of
water.In such cases the tissues appear abnormally dry and the blood
thick and tarry at the autopsy (_Ziemssen's Handb.u.
Therap._, Bd.It seems to me proper to distinguish two kinds of anaemia in gastric
cancer--a simple anaemia, which is present in the majority of cases,
and can be explained by the development of the cancer and the
disturbance of the gastric functions; and a pernicious anaemia, which
is present only in exceptional cases, and has the typical symptoms of
progressive pernicious anaemia.][Footnote 58: In a case of large medullary cancer of the stomach
reported by H. Mayer there was one white to fifty red blood-corpuscles.The spleen was not enlarged (Bayer, _Aerztl.Intelligenzblatt_, 1870,
No.A similar case is related by Lebert, in which, however, the
spleen was enlarged (_op.To the pallor of anaemia is added often a faded yellowish tint of the
skin which is considered characteristic of the cancerous cachexia.At
the same time, the skin is frequently dry and harsh, and may present
brownish spots (chloasma cachecticorum).The pallid lips, the pale
greenish-yellow color of the face, the furrowed lines, and the pinched
and despondent expression make up a characteristic physiognomy, which,
however, is neither peculiar to gastric cancer nor present in all cases
of the disease.There is no cachectic appearance which is pathognomonic
of cancer; and in this connection it is well to note that there are
cases of gastric ulcer, and particularly of non-cancerous stenosis of
the pylorus, in which all of the symptoms described as peculiar to the
cancerous cachexia are met with.Nevertheless, the weight of these
symptoms in the diagnosis of gastric cancer should not be
underestimated.There is no disease in which profound cachectic
symptoms so frequently and so rapidly develop as in gastric cancer.The profound nutritive disturbances of gastric cancer are referable
partly to the cancer as such, and partly to the impairment of the
functions of the stomach.It is impossible to separate the effects of
these two sets of causes, and distinguish, as some have done, a
cachexia of cancer {553} and a cachexia of inanition.It is the
combination of these causes which renders the cachexia of cancer of the
stomach so common, so rapid in its development, and so profound as
compared with that of cancer in other situations.The relation of
cancer in general to cachexia need not here be discussed, save to say
that there is the best ground for believing that the cachexia is
directly dependent upon the growth and metamorphoses of the primary
cancer and its metastases, and that there is not reason to assume any
dyscrasia antedating the cancerous formation.While the failure of the general health and the gastric symptoms in
general develop side by side, it is especially significant of gastric
cancer when the symptoms of impaired nutrition are more pronounced than
can be explained by the local gastric disturbance.When, however, as
sometimes happens, gastric symptoms are absent or no more than can be
explained by anaemia and marasmus, then in the absence of tumor a
positive diagnosis is impossible.Such cases of gastric cancer during
life often pass for essential or pernicious anaemia.Otherwise,
unexplained symptoms of anaemia with emaciation and debility,
particularly in elderly people, should lead to a careful search for
gastric cancer.Finally, it is necessary to add that there are exceptional cases of
gastric cancer in which there is no emaciation, and in which the
general health appears to be astonishingly well preserved.In most of
these cases death occurs either from some accident of the disease or
from some complication.Slight or moderate oedema about the ankles is a common symptom during
the cachectic stage of gastric cancer.This oedema is due to hydraemia.This cachectic dropsy in rare cases becomes excessive and leads to
anasarca, with serous effusion in the peritoneal, pleural, and
pericardial sacs.Such cases are liable to be mistaken for heart
disease, particularly as a haemic murmur often coexists, or for
Bright's disease.Ascites may be the result not only of hydraemia, but
also of cancerous peritonitis or of pressure on the portal vein by
cancer.Many cases of gastric cancer associated with ascites have been
falsely diagnosed as cirrhosis of the liver, and sometimes the
distinction is extremely difficult or impossible.During the greater part of the disease the pulse is usually normal;
toward the end it is not infrequently rapid, small, and compressible.In consequence of weakness and anaemia any exertion may suffice to
increase the frequency of the pulse, and may induce palpitation of the
heart and syncope.As might be expected as the result of anaemia, haemic murmurs in the
heart and blood-vessels are not rare in gastric cancer.Epigastric pulsation is often very prominent in cases of gastric
cancer, as it may be in various other conditions.This pulsation is
sometimes of a paroxysmal nature.Venous thrombosis is not a rare complication in the last stages of
gastric cancer.It is most common in the femoral and saphenous veins,
and is rapidly followed by painful oedematous swelling of the affected
extremity.Thrombosis of the subclavian and axillary veins is much less
frequent.When it occurs there are the same symptoms of phlegmasia alba
dolens in the upper extremity as have been mentioned for the lower.Lebert has recorded a case of thrombosis of the right external jugular
{554} vein.[59] The thrombosis is the result of marasmus, and therefore
may occur in other gastric diseases besides gastric cancer, so that
this symptom has not all the diagnostic importance for gastric cancer
claimed by Trousseau.Being an evidence of great weakness of the
circulation, marantic thrombosis in cancer of the stomach is of grave
prognostic import.The temperature is often normal throughout the course of gastric
cancer.Febrile attacks, however, are not uncommon in this disease.Elevation of temperature may occur without any complication to explain
it.During the second half of the disease there may be either irregular
febrile attacks or a more continuous fever, which is, however, usually
of a light grade, the temperature not generally exceeding 102 degrees.Lebert describes a light and a hectic
carcinomatous fever.There may be subnormal temperature with collapse during the last days
of life, and in general anaemia and inactivity of nutritive processes
tend to produce a low temperature.Dyspnoea on slight exertion may be present in gastric cancer as a
result of anaemia or of fatty heart.In a few cases of gastric cancer
have been observed symptoms pointing to a reflex vagus neurosis, such
as paroxysms of dyspnoea, oppression in the chest, and palpitation of
the heart, but these symptoms are less common in gastric cancer than in
some other diseases of the stomach.Watson[60] relates a case of
gastric cancer in which increasing dyspnoea and palpitation were such
prominent symptoms that he was led to diagnose fatty heart with portal
congestion as the sole trouble.At the autopsy the heart and lungs were
found healthy, but there was extensive cancer of the greater curvature
of the stomach.He subsequently ascertained that there had been
symptoms pointing to gastric disease.[Footnote 60: Sir T. Watson, _Lectures on the Principles and Practice
of Physic_, vol.The various complications of gastric cancer which affect the
respiratory organs will be considered later.Depression of spirits, lack of energy, headache, neuralgia,
sleeplessness, and vertigo are functional nervous disturbances which
are often the result of disordered digestion from whatever cause, and
are therefore not uncommon in gastric cancer.The theory that these
symptoms are due to the absorption of noxious substances produced in
the stomach and intestine by abnormal digestive processes is
plausible,[61] and more intelligible than reference to some undefined
sympathy between the digestive organs and the nervous system.[Footnote 61: This theory is elaborated by Senator ("Ueber
Selbstinfection durch abnorme Zersetzungsvorgange, etc.," _Zeitschrift
f. klin.The intelligence is generally not impaired in the course of gastric
cancer.Considerable interest belongs to coma as a symptom of cancer of the
stomach, and more particularly to the occurrence of coma with the
peculiar characters which have been described by Kussmaul as
distinguishing diabetic coma.[62] The most distinctive feature in
Kussmaul's group of symptoms is the accompaniment of the coma by a
peculiar {555} dyspnoea in which, without evidence of disease of the
lungs or air-passages, the respirations are strong and deep and often
attended with a groaning sound in expiration.The breathing is either
normal in frequency or oftener moderately increased.The temperature is not much elevated, and
sometimes is much below the normal.Sometimes the coma is preceded by a
period of excitement, with restlessness, and perhaps with screaming.Gerhardt's reaction in the urine may or may not be present.When it is
present in a marked degree there is often an aromatic, chloroform-like
odor to the breath and to the fresh urine.The patient may come out of
the coma, but in the vast majority of cases the coma terminates
fatally.[Footnote 62: _Deutsches Arch.It is now known that this dyspnoeic coma is not confined to diabetes
mellitus, but that it occurs also in gastric cancer and in various
other diseases.[63] Its occurrence in gastric cancer is rare.In this
disease it does not usually appear until anaemia is far advanced, but
it may occur in cases of cancer in which the patient's general health
and nutrition are still fairly good.I recently made the post-mortem
examination of an elderly man, fairly well nourished, who was found in
the streets comatose and brought in this condition to Bellevue
Hospital, where he died in about twelve hours.While in the hospital
his breathing was increased in frequency, forcible, and deep.The urine contained a small quantity of
albumen, but no sugar.At the autopsy was found a large, soft, ulcerated
cancer of the lesser curvature and posterior wall of the stomach near
the pylorus.The kidneys, brain, heart, and other organs were
essentially healthy.[Footnote 63: Von Jaksch was the first to describe this form of coma in
cancer of the stomach (_Wien.Wochenschr._, 1883, pp.He adopted the term coma carcinomatosum, and more recently coma
diaceticum.L. Riess has reported seventeen cases of this coma
occurring in a variety of diseases, such as pernicious anaemia, gastric
cancer, gastric ulcer, tuberculosis, which all had in common profound
anaemia.He proposes the term dyspnoeic coma (_Zeitschrift f. klin.Senator has described two
cases of gastric cancer with this coma.He uses the terms dyscrasic
coma and Kussmaul's group of symptoms (_ibid._, Bd.In the
cases described by Litten under the name coma dyspepticum, dyspnoea was
absent, but Gerhardt's reaction in the urine was present.In Litten's
cases structural disease of the stomach was not supposed to be present.The patients recovered from the coma (_ibid._, Suppl.We possess no satisfactory explanation of this form of coma.In
diabetes it is considered to be due to the presence in the blood of
some intoxicating agent.For a time this agent was thought to be
aceton; it is now believed by Von Jaksch to be diacetic acid.Much
stress has been laid upon the aromatic, fruity odor of the breath and
of the fresh urine, and upon the presence of some substance in the
urine which imparts to it a burgundy-red color upon the addition of
liquor ferri chloridi (Gerhardt's reaction.See changes in the urine,
page 551).Although the whole aceton question is at present in a very
confused state, there is no proof that aceton or its allies possesses
the toxic properties assumed by this theory;[64] and it is certain that
dyspnoeic coma may occur in diabetes and in other diseases without the
presence of Gerhardt's reaction in the urine.It is also true that this
reaction often occurs without any clinical symptoms referable to it.Riess and Senator believe that in non-diabetic {556} cases anaemia is
the most important factor in the production of this coma.[65]

[Footnote 64: Frerichs, _Zeitschrift f. klin.[Footnote 65: Riess refers the coma to the anaemia as such, whereas
Senator thinks that, in consequence of the depraved nutrition of the
body resulting from the anaemia, some toxic substance is developed
which enters the circulation.]Coma, probably belonging to this same variety, may occur in gastric
cancer without the peculiar dyspnoea which has been described.There is
reason to believe that this dyspnoea is not a necessary symptom of the
so-called diabetic coma.Chronic Bright's disease terminating with uraemic coma is an occasional
but not frequent complication of gastric cancer.Coma and other cerebral symptoms may be produced by secondary cancerous
tumors in the brain.Stupor deepening into coma may develop during the often-prolonged
death-agony of gastric cancer.The distribution, origin, and frequency of cancerous growths secondary
to gastric cancer are most conveniently considered under Pathological
Anatomy.Symptoms referable to certain localizations of these secondary
cancerous deposits, however, are so common, and so interwoven with the
clinical history of cancer of the stomach, that it is desirable to
consider some of these symptoms in the present connection.Cancer of the liver is the most important of these secondary cancerous
growths.It is estimated to be present in nearly one-third of the cases
of gastric cancer, but by no means in all these cases does it produce
symptoms.As a rule, the earlier hepatic cancer forms in the course of
gastric cancer the more likely is it to be attended by symptoms.The
most important symptoms of secondary cancer of the liver are
enlargement of the liver, peritoneal exudation, and persistent icterus.When nodular growths can be felt in the free border or surface of the
liver, the diagnosis is generally easily established.Sometimes the
liver remains of normal size or is even contracted, and then the
diagnosis is difficult or impossible.Ascites or exudative peritonitis
is present in about one-half of the cases of cancer of the liver.It is only persistent jaundice
which aids in the diagnosis of hepatic cancer.The various combinations of gastric cancer with secondary hepatic
cancer may be clinically grouped as follows:

1.Symptoms of gastric cancer with latent hepatic cancer.Symptoms of gastric cancer followed by symptoms of hepatic cancer.Symptoms both of gastric cancer and of hepatic cancer present when
the case comes under observation.Daniel went to the office.Symptoms of hepatic cancer with latent gastric cancer.Symptoms of hepatic cancer followed by symptoms of gastric cancer.Symptoms of anaemia and
marasmus, or of chronic exudative peritonitis, or of chronic pleurisy.From this grouping it is evident that the existence of secondary
hepatic cancer may aid in the diagnosis of cancer of the stomach, or
may mislead, or may be without influence.The greatest assistance in
diagnosis is rendered when the physical signs and the symptoms of
hepatic {557} cancer develop some time after the appearance of gastric
symptoms which may previously have been equivocal.Much more difficult
to diagnosticate are the cases of hepatic cancer accompanied or
followed by gastric symptoms, inasmuch as cancer of the liver, whether
primary or secondary, may be attended with marked disturbance of the
gastric functions, including haematemesis.In these cases, unless a
tumor of the stomach can be discovered, a positive diagnosis of gastric
cancer is impossible.In view of the infrequency of primary cancer of
the liver, however, there will be in many of these cases a strong
probability in favor of primary cancer of the stomach.When it is
remembered that over one-third of the cancers of the liver are
secondary to cancer of the stomach, it is evident that in cases which
appear to be primary hepatic cancer very careful attention should be
given to the exploration of the stomach.But even then diagnostic
errors will often be unavoidable.Cancer of the peritoneum secondary to cancer of the stomach may produce
no symptoms, and so pass unrecognized.The diagnosis of peritoneal
cancer is readily made when, after the recognition of gastric cancer,
secondary cancerous nodules in the peritoneum can be felt through the
abdominal walls or through the vagina.There are cases of gastric
cancer in which the symptoms are all referable to secondary cancer of
the peritoneum.Cancer of the peritoneum is usually attended with fluid
exudation in the peritoneal cavity.The chemical and the microscopical
examination of this fluid withdrawn by paracentesis may aid in the
diagnosis of cancerous peritonitis.Whereas in dropsical accumulations
in the peritoneal cavity the quantity of albumen in the fluid is
usually less than 2-1/2 per cent., in cancerous peritonitis there is
usually from 3 to 4 per cent.of albumen, the percentage rarely falling
as low as 2-1/2 per cent., but sometimes being as high as from 5 to 6
per cent.The percentage of albumen in ordinary peritonitis is usually
over 4.[66] Clumps of cancer-cells are sometimes to be found by
microscopical examination of the fluid.These cells are large,
epithelioid in shape, and often contain vacuoles and fatty granules.It
is only when these cells are arranged in clumps or as so-called budding
cells, and when they are present in abundance, that they are
diagnostic.They are to be sought especially in fibrinous coagula.They
are present only when the cancerous alveoli actually communicate with
the peritoneal cavity.[67] The development of cancerous nodules in the
margins of an opening made in the abdominal walls by a trocar is also
evidence of cancerous disease of the peritoneum.The same thickening
and retraction of the mesentery and omentum may occur in cancerous as
in tuberculous peritonitis.In both the exudation is often hemorrhagic.[Footnote 66: The conditions under which the estimation of the quantity
of albumen in the peritoneal exudation may prove of diagnostic aid are
fully considered by Runeberg (_Deutsches Arch.Here also are given methods for making this analysis for
clinical purposes.][Footnote 67: The literature on this subject is as follows: Foulis,
_Brit.2, 1878; Thornton, _ibid._, Sept.7,
1878; Quincke, _Deutsches Arch.580;
Ehrlich, _Charite Annalen_, vii.226; Brieger, _ibid._, viii.]Importance has been attached to enlargement of the supraclavicular
lymphatic glands in the diagnosis of cancer of the stomach, but there
are so many causes of enlargement of these glands that not much
significance can be attached to this symptom, which, moreover, is
absent in most {558} cases.Still, under certain circumstances this
glandular enlargement may aid in the diagnosis.The same remarks apply
to enlargement of the inguinal glands, which is a common occurrence in
case cancer involves the peritoneum.One must not mistake abnormal
prominence of the lymphatic glands in consequence of emaciation for
actual enlargement.Gastric cancer much less frequently than gastric ulcer causes
perforation of the stomach.Of 507 cases of gastric cancer collected by
Brinton, perforation into the general peritoneal cavity occurred in 17
(3-1/3 per cent.).[68] In two cases of gastric cancer reported by Ellis
perforative peritonitis was preceded by symptoms supposed to be only
those of ordinary dyspepsia, hemorrhage and vomiting being absent.[69]
Various fistulous communications like those described under gastric
ulcer may be the result of perforation of gastric cancer, but with the
exception of gastro-colic fistula they are much more frequently
produced by ulcer than by cancer.In 160 cases of gastric cancer
collected by Dittrich, gastro-colic fistula existed in 6 (3-3/4 per
cent.).[70] In 507 cases collected by Brinton this fistula existed in
11 (2.17 per cent.).In Lange's 210 cases gastro-colic fistula existed
in 8 (3.8 per cent.).Of 33 cases of gastro-colic fistula collected by
Murchison, 21 were caused by cancerous ulceration.[71] The symptoms
characteristic of fistulous communication between the stomach and the
colon are the vomiting of fecal matter and the passage of undigested
food by the stools.These symptoms are not present in all cases, so
that a diagnosis is not always possible.Fecal vomiting is influenced
by the size of the opening between the stomach and the colon.With
great obstruction at the pylorus, fecal vomiting, as might be expected,
is absent or infrequent, while the passage of undigested food by the
bowels is common.Under these circumstances vomiting is sometimes
relieved after the establishment of the fistula.Aid may be afforded in
the diagnosis of gastro-colic fistula by the introduction into the
rectum or into the stomach of  or other easily recognizable
substances, and determining their presence in the vomit or in the
stools in consequence of their escape by the unnatural outlet.V.
Ziemssen has determined in a case of gastro-colic fistula due to cancer
the escape into the stomach of carbonic acid gas artificially generated
in the rectum, with failure to obtain distension of the colon.[72] A
number of instances of gastro-cutaneous fistula due to gastric cancer
have been recorded, but this form of fistula is much less common than
gastro-colic fistula, and much less frequently the result of cancer
than of ulcer of the stomach.Subcutaneous emphysema may precede the
formation of the fistula.Other gastric fistulous communications
resulting from cancer, such as with the pleura, the lungs, the small
intestine, are too infrequent to merit consideration under the
symptomatology of the disease.cit._) records in 210 cases of
gastric cancer 12 perforations into the peritoneal cavity (5.7 per
cent.).][Footnote 70: _Prager Vierteljahrsch._, vol.[Footnote 72: _Deutsches Arch.He
recommends for extreme distension of the colon in an adult the
introduction, by means of a tube passed up the rectum, of a solution of
about 5 drachms of sodii bicarb.and 4-1/2 drachms of tartaric
acid--injected not all at once, but in three or four doses at intervals
of a few minutes, the tube being cleaned in the intervals by the
injection of three ounces of water, so as to avoid generation of gas in
the tube.The generation of a smaller quantity of gas would suffice for
the purpose here in view.]{559} As a rule, patients with gastric cancer die from gradual
exhaustion.In a condition of extreme emaciation and feebleness the
patient sinks into a state of collapse, accompanied often with stupor,
sometimes with mild delirium.The death-agony is prolonged frequently
from twelve to twenty-four hours, and sometimes even longer.On the
other hand, death may occur somewhat suddenly in the last stages of
gastric cancer, and without satisfactory explanation.Death from copious gastric hemorrhage does not occur probably in more
than 1 per cent.In the rare cases of death from perforation of the stomach the patient
is sometimes so exhausted at the time of perforation that the
occurrence of this accident remains unrecognized in the absence of any
complaint of characteristic symptoms.The coma which sometimes leads to the fatal termination of gastric
cancer has already been sufficiently considered.Finally, death may be the result of certain complications more or less
dependent upon the cancer.Of these the most important are suppurative
peritonitis and pulmonary complications, particularly oedema, terminal
pneumonia, and embolism of the pulmonary artery.DURATION.--It is evidently impossible to determine the exact duration
of a cancer of the stomach.Doubtless in all cases there is a period of
growth of the tumor before it produces symptoms, and the duration of
this latent period can never be determined.When symptoms appear they
are often at first so mild as to be readily overlooked, and so
ambiguous that even if recognized they are not clearly referable to the
cancer.Gastric symptoms may have preceded, perhaps for years, the
development of the cancer, so as to lead to the assumption of a longer
duration of the cancer than is really the case.Estimates, therefore,
of the duration of gastric cancer can be only of limited value.From 198 cases Brinton[73] estimates the average duration of gastric
cancer as about twelve and a half months, the maximum duration as about
thirty-six months, and the minimum as one month.From 36 cases
Katzenellenbogen[74] estimates the average duration as eighteen months,
the maximum as five years and five months, the minimum as one month.From 112 cases Lebert[75] makes the average duration fifteen months and
the maximum four years.of the cases Lebert found the
duration less than three months, in 62 per cent.between six and
eighteen months, in 42 per cent.between six and twelve months, in 17
per cent.between three and six months, and in the same number of cases
between eighteen months and four years.cit._]

[Footnote 74: _Op.cit._]

[Footnote 75: _Op.cit._]

Estimates of several years' duration (such as nine years in the case of
Napoleon) are to be received with scepticism.In these cases symptoms
of gastralgia or of dyspepsia or of gastric ulcer have preceded the
development of the cancer.It has already been mentioned that cancer
may develop in a simple ulcer of the stomach.Mathieu,[76] from an analysis of 27 cases of gastric cancer occurring
under thirty-four years, found the average duration in early life to be
only three months.In only 2 out of 19 cases did the duration exceed
one year.Although this analysis is based upon too small a number of
cases, there {560} seems to be no doubt that gastric cancer pursues a
more rapid course in early life than it does in old people.[Footnote 76: _Du Cancer precoce de l'Estomac_, Paris, 1884, p.COMPLICATIONS.--Some of the complications of gastric cancer have been
mentioned under Symptomatology.Jaundice may appear in the course of
gastric cancer from a variety of causes, such as catarrhal
gastro-duodenitis, impaction of gall-stones in the common bile-duct,
and pressure on the bile-duct by cancerous growths in the pancreas, in
the portal lymphatic glands, or in the liver itself.Pylethrombosis,
which is likely to be suppurative, is a rare complication.In a case of
cancer of the anterior wall and greater curvature of the stomach
reported by Wickham Legg[77] the symptoms seem to have been mostly
referable to a complicating suppurative pylethrombosis.Simple and
cancerous pylethromboses also occur.Other forms of peritonitis than
the cancerous may complicate gastric cancer, such as suppurative,
sero-fibrinous, and chronic proliferative peritonitis.Catarrhal
enteritis, and particularly diphtheritic colitis, are not infrequent
complications, especially in the later stages of the disease.Chronic
diffuse nephritis, both in the form of the large and of the small
kidney, is a rare complication of cancer of the stomach.Hydrothorax,
sero-fibrinous pleurisy, and emphysema may develop either with or
without cancerous invasion of the pleura.Pericarditis is much less
common; it is most likely to occur with cancer of the cardia.Pyo-pneumothorax, abscess, and gangrene of the lung may result from
perforation of the pleura or of the lung by gastric cancer.Oedema of
the lungs, splenization, and pneumonia, involving usually the lower
lobes, are common in the last days of gastric cancer.Emboli derived
from venous thrombi are sometimes carried into the pulmonary artery or
its branches.Although much has been written as to the exclusion of
tuberculosis by cancer, no such law exists.Both old and fresh
tubercles have been repeatedly observed in cases of gastric cancer.Reference has already been made to the frequent development of aphthae
in the mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus in the final stage of gastric
cancer.Fatty degeneration of the heart may develop in gastric cancer
as in other anaemic states.Phlegmasia alba dolens has already been
mentioned.It is not probable that insanity is to be regarded as more
than an accidental complication of gastric cancer; still, it has been
noticed in several cases--for instance, of Dittrich's 160 cases, 5
patients were insane, 2 with violent mania.Amyloid degeneration has
been present in some cases.Purpura haemorrhagica has been present in a
few instances in the later stages (cachectic purpura).Chronic
catarrhal gastritis and dilatation of the stomach are less
complications than a part of the disease.The relation of cancer to
simple ulcer of the stomach has already been considered.The various
secondary cancerous deposits are most conveniently considered under the
Morbid Anatomy.It is to be remarked that many of the complications of
gastric cancer--as, for instance, pneumonia and peritonitis--may have a
very obscure clinical history, as they often occur when the patient is
greatly prostrated.MORBID ANATOMY.--The following table gives the situation of the tumor
in 1300 cases of cancer of the stomach:[78] {561}

  Pyloric region.791  60.8%
  Lesser curvature.148  11.4%
  Cardia.104   8.0%
  Posterior wall.68   5.2%
  The whole or the greater
    part of the stomach.61   4.7%
  Multiple tumors.45   3.5%
  Greater curvature.34   2.6%
  Anterior wall.30   2.3%
  Fundus.19   1.5%

From this table it appears that three-fifths of all gastric cancers
occupy the pyloric region, but it is not to be understood that in all
of these cases the pylorus itself is involved.In four-fifths of the
cases the comparatively small segment of the stomach represented by the
cardia, the lesser curvature, and the pyloric region is the part
affected by gastric cancer.The lesser curvature and the anterior and
the posterior walls are involved more frequently than appears from the
table, inasmuch as many cancers assigned to the pyloric region extend
to these parts.The fundus is the least frequent seat of cancer.In the
cases classified as involving the greater part of the stomach the
fundus often escapes.[Footnote 78: These cases are collected from the following sources:
Lebert, _op.cit._; Prague statistics of Dittrich, Engel, Wrany, and
Eppinger, _loc.cit._; Habershon, _op.cit._; Katzenellenbogen, _op.cit._; and Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter, _loc.cit._ Gussenbauer and
V. Winiwarter assign to the class of cancers involving the whole
stomach all cases which they found designated simply as carcinoma
ventriculi without further description.This produces in their
statistics an excessive number of cancers under this class.I have
preferred, therefore, to estimate in their collection of cases the
number of cancers involving the whole stomach, according to the
percentage for this class obtained from the other authors above cited.]As was shown by Rokitansky, it is the exception for cancer of the
pylorus to extend into the duodenum, whereas cancer of the cardia
usually invades for a certain distance the oesophagus.The varieties of carcinoma which develop primarily in the stomach are
scirrhous, medullary, colloid, and cylindrical epithelial
carcinoma.[79] The distinction between scirrhous and medullary cancer
is based upon the difference in consistence, the former being hard and
the latter soft.Cylindrical-celled epithelioma cannot be recognized as
such by the naked eye.It presents usually the gross appearances of
medullary cancer.Soft cancer (including both cylindrical-celled
epithelioma and medullary carcinoma) is the most frequent form of
gastric cancer.Next in frequency is scirrhous cancer, and then comes
colloid cancer, which, although not rare, is much less frequent than
the other varieties.[Footnote 79: I have not been able to find an authentic instance of
primary melanotic cancer of the stomach, although this form is included
by most authors in the list of primary gastric cancers.It is known
that most cases formerly described as melanotic cancers are melanotic
sarcomata, which originate usually in the skin or the eye and are
accompanied frequently with abundant metastases.Secondary melanotic
tumors have been several times found in the stomach.They were present
in 7 out of 50 cases of melanotic cancer (or sarcoma) analyzed by
Eiselt, although out of 104 cases not a single primary melanotic cancer
occurred in the stomach (_Prager Viertaljahrschr._, vol.The list of secondary melanotic sarcomata of the stomach might be still
further increased.Of course gastric cancers  by pigment from
old blood-extravasations should not be confounded with melanotic
tumors.]As all degrees of combination and of transition exist between the
different forms of cancer, and as a large number of cancers of the
stomach are of a medium consistence and would be classified by some
observers as scirrhous and by others as medullary, statistics as to the
relative frequency of the different varieties have very little value.Moreover, in most statistics upon this point there is no evidence that
simple fibrous growths have not been confounded with scirrhous cancer,
and as a rule {562} little or no account is taken of cylindrical-celled
epithelioma, which is a common form of gastric cancer--according to
Cornil and Ranvier, the most common.[80]

[Footnote 80: For any who may be interested in such statistics I have
collected 1221 cases of gastric cancer, of which 791 (64.8 per cent.)were medullary, 399 (32.7 per cent.)scirrhous, and 31 (2.5 per cent.)22 cases described as epithelial have been included with the
medullary; 29 cases described as fibro-medullary, and 1 as
fasciculated, have been included with the scirrhous.The cases are from
the previously-cited statistics of Lebert, Dittrich, Wrany, Eppinger,
Gussenbauer, and V. Winiwarter, and from Fenger (_Virchow u. Hirsch's
Jahresbericht_, 1874, Bd.Cancer of the stomach may grow in the form of a more or less complete
ring around the circumference of the stomach, or as a circumscribed
tumor projecting into the cavity of the stomach, or as a diffuse
infiltration of the walls of the stomach.The annular form of growth is
observed most frequently in the pyloric region.Cancerous tumors which
project into the interior of the stomach are sometimes broad and
flattened, sometimes fungoid in shape, but most frequently they appear
as round or oval, more rarely irregular, crater-like ulcers, with
thickened, prominent walls and ragged floor.The free surface of the
tumor presents sometimes a cauliflower-like or dendritic appearance,
which characterizes the so-called villous cancer.Diffuse cancerous
infiltration is seated oftenest in the right half of the stomach, but
it may occupy the cardiac region or even the entire stomach.The relation of the cancerous growth to the coats of the stomach varies
in different cases.The tumor usually begins in the mucous membrane and
rapidly extends through the muscularis mucosae into the submucous coat.In this lax connective-tissue coat the tumor spreads often more rapidly
than in the mucous membrane, so that it may appear as if the cancer
originated in the submucosa.The mucous membrane, however, is usually
invaded, sooner or later, over the whole extent of the tumor.The dense
muscular coat offers more resistance to the invasion of the tumor.Cancerous masses, however, penetrate along the connective-tissue septa
between the muscular bundles, which often increase in number and size.In the muscular coat thus thickened can be seen the opaque white
fibrous and cancerous septa enclosing the grayish, translucent bundles
of smooth muscular tissue.Often, however, the whole muscular coat
beneath the tumor is replaced by the cancerous growth, and can no
longer be recognized.The serous and subserous connective tissue, like
the submucous coat, offers a favorable soil for the growth of the
tumor, which here appears usually in the form of large and small
nodules projecting from the peritoneum.Adhesions now form between the
stomach and surrounding parts, and opportunity is offered for the
continuous growth of the cancer into these parts.In the manner
described the tumor grows in all directions, sometimes more in depth,
sometimes more laterally, sometimes more into the interior of the
stomach.Ulceration occurs in all forms of gastric cancer.[81] The ulceration is
caused either by fatty degeneration and molecular disintegration of the
surface of the tumor or by the separation of sloughy masses.Doubtless
the solvent action of the gastric juice aids in the process.The softer
and {563} the more rapid the growth of the cancer, the more extensive
is likely to be the ulcer.Such ulcers are usually round or oval in
shape, but their contours may be irregular from the coalescence of two
or more ulcers or from serpiginous growth.The edges are usually high,
soft in consistence, and often beset with polypoid excrescences.The
floor is generally sloughy and soft, and often presents warty
outgrowths.The edges and floor may, however, be hard and smooth.In
the more slowly-growing scirrhous and colloid cancers the ulcers are
more likely to be superficial.Partial cicatrization of cancerous
ulcers may take place.The development of cicatricial tissue may
destroy the cancerous elements to such an extent that only by careful
microscopical examination can the distinction be made between cancer
and simple ulcer or fibroid induration.The examination of secondary
cancerous deposits in adjacent lymphatic glands or other parts becomes,
then, an important aid in the diagnosis.[Footnote 81: Ulceration was present in 60 per cent.of Lebert's cases,
and in 66-1/2 per cent.of Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's pyloric
cancers.]Suppuration has been known to occur in gastric cancers, but it is
extremely rare.Each form of gastric cancer has certain peculiarities which require
separate consideration.Medullary carcinoma grows more rapidly than the other varieties of
cancer.It forms usually soft masses, which project into the stomach
and are prone to break down in the centre and develop into the
crater-like ulcers already described.All of the coats of the stomach
are rapidly invaded by the growth.The consistence of the tumor is
soft, the color upon section whitish or reddish-gray, sometimes over a
considerable extent hemorrhagic.Milky juice can be freely scraped from
the cut surface of the tumor.The so-called villous cancer and the
haematodes fungus are varieties of medullary carcinoma.Medullary
carcinoma is more frequently accompanied by metastases than the other
forms.In consequence of its tendency to deep ulceration medullary
cancer is more liable to give rise to hemorrhage and to perforation
than is scirrhous or colloid cancer.The continuous new formation of
cancerous tissue in the floor of the ulcer and the formation of
adhesions, however, greatly lessen the danger of perforation into the
peritoneal cavity.Histologically, medullary cancer is composed of a scanty stroma of
connective tissue enclosing an abundance of cancerous alveoli filled
with polyhedrical or cylindrical epithelial cells.The stroma is often
richly infiltrated with lymphoid cells, and contains blood-vessels
which often present irregular dilatations of their lumen.Waldeyer describes with much detail, for this as for the other forms of
gastric cancer, the origin of the tumor from the gastric tubules.According to his description, a group of gastric tubules, ten to twenty
in number, sends prolongations downward into the submucous coat.These
tubular prolongations are filled with proliferating epithelial cells,
which make their way into the lymphatic spaces of the surrounding
tissue and give origin to the cells in the cancerous alveoli.A
small-celled infiltration of the surrounding connective tissue
accompanies this growth of the tubules.The tissue beneath and at the margins of medullary cancer may be
predominantly fibrous in texture and contain comparatively few
cancerous alveoli.This scirrhous base is often exposed after the
destruction of the greater part of the soft cancer by ulceration and
sloughing.It is {564} probable that many of the scirrhous cancers are
formed in this way secondarily to medullary cancer (Ziegler).Cylindrical-celled epithelioma presents the same gross appearances and
the same tendency to ulceration and to the formation of metastases
which characterize medullary cancer.The consistence of cylindrical
epithelioma may, however, be firm like that of scirrhus.Not
infrequently the alveoli are distended with mucus secreted by the
lining epithelium, and then the tumor presents in whole or in part
appearances similar to colloid cancer.Upon microscopical examination are seen spaces resembling more or less
closely sections of tubular glands.These spaces are lined with
columnar epithelium.Often in certain parts of the tumor the alveolar
spaces are filled with cells, so that the structure is a combination of
that of ordinary cancer and of epithelioma.The stroma is generally
scanty and rich in cells, but it may be abundant.Cysts may be present
in this form of tumor, and in one case I have found such cysts nearly
filled with papillary growths covered with cylindrical epithelium, so
that the appearance resembled closely that of the so-called proliferous
cysto-sarcoma of the breast.The origin of cylindrical epithelioma from the gastric tubules is
generally accepted, and is more readily demonstrable than the similar
origin claimed for the other forms of gastric cancer.Scirrhous cancer assumes often the form of a diffuse thickening and
induration of the gastric walls, particularly in the pyloric region,
where it causes stenosis of the pyloric orifice.Scirrhus may, however,
appear as a circumscribed tumor.Irregular hard nodules frequently
project from diffuse scirrhous growths into the interior of the
stomach.Scirrhous cancer and medullary cancer are often combined with
each other.The dense consistence of scirrhous cancer is due to the predominance of
the fibrous stroma, the cancerous alveoli being relatively small in
size and few in number.Colloid cancer generally appears as a more or less uniform thickening
of the gastric walls.All of the coats of the stomach are converted
into the colloid growth.Nearly the whole of the stomach may be invaded
by the new growth.[82] The tumor has a tendency to spread to the omenta
and to the rest of the peritoneum, where it may form enormous masses,
but it rarely gives rise to metastases in the interior of organs.Colloid cancer may, however, form a circumscribed projecting tumor in
the stomach, and in rare instances it causes abundant secondary colloid
deposits in the liver, the lungs, and other parts.[Footnote 82: In a case reported by Storer the whole stomach, except a
little of the left extremity over an extent of about an inch, was
converted into a colloid mass in which no trace of the normal coats of
the stomach could be made out.The colloid growth replacing the gastric
wall measured seven-eighths of an inch in thickness in the pyloric
region.Digestion was less disturbed in this case than in most cases of
gastric cancer (_Boston Med.In
Amidon's case (reported in the _Trans.38) there seems to have been an equally extensive colloid
metamorphosis of the stomach.]Colloid cancer presents, even to the naked eye, an exquisite alveolar
structure, whence the name alveolar cancer as a designation of this
tumor.Bands of opaque white or gray connective tissue enclose alveolar
meshes which are filled with the gelatinous, pellucid colloid {565}
substance.This colloid material is thought to be produced by a colloid
transformation of the epithelial cells in the alveoli, but the same
transformation seems to occur also in the stroma.Few or no intact
epithelial cells may be found in the alveoli.Colloid metamorphosis may
take place in all forms of gastric cancer, but it is particularly
common in cylindrical epithelioma.Colloid cancer may originate in the
peritoneum unconnected with any glandular structures.It occurs often
at an earlier age than other forms of cancer.Deep ulceration rarely
attacks colloid cancer.Flat-celled epithelioma is found at the cardiac orifice and as a
metastatic growth in other parts of the stomach.Originating in the
oesophagus, it may extend downward into the stomach.By noting whether
the structure is that of squamous or of cylindrical epithelioma it is
often possible to determine whether a tumor at the cardiac orifice
originates in the oesophagus or in the stomach.Secondary cancer of the stomach, although rare, is not such a curiosity
as is often represented.Without aiming at completeness, I have been
able to collect 37 cases of secondary cancer of the stomach, of which
the larger number will stand critical examination.[83] Of these cases,
17 were secondary to cancer of the breast, 8 to cancer of the
oesophagus, 3 to cancer of the mouth or nose, and the remainder to
cancer of other parts of the body.The large number of cases secondary
to cancer of the breast is explained by the large statistics relating
to mammary cancer which were consulted.Gastric cancer is more
frequently secondary to cancer of the oesophagus than to cancer of any
other part.In this category of course are not included cases of
continuous growth of oesophageal cancer into the stomach, but only
metastatic cancers of the stomach.A part at least of the gastric
cancers secondary to cancer of the alimentary tract above the stomach I
refer, with Klebs, to implantation in the mucous membrane of the
stomach of cancerous particles detached from the primary growth in the
oesophagus, pharynx, or mouth.This view is supported by the absence in
some cases of any involvement of the lymphatic glands.The secondary
deposits in the stomach conform in structure to the primary growth.They are usually situated in the submucous coat, where they form one or
often several distinctly circumscribed tumors.The secondary tumors may
or may not ulcerate.[Footnote 83: These cases are from Dittrich, 2 (the remainder of his
cases I rejected); Cohnheim, 1; Petri, 2; Klebs, 3; Lucke, 1; Weigert,
1; Coupland, 1; Cruse, 1; Hausmann, 1; Bartholow, 1; Oldekop, 5; Edes,
1; V. Torok and V. Wittelshofer, 8; Grawitz, 4; Haren Noman, 5.So-called melanotic cancers, cancers involving only the serous coat of
the stomach, and those extending by continuous growth into the stomach,
are not included in this list.]Primary cancers may be present at the same time in different organs of
the body; for instance, in the uterus and in the stomach.[84] The
possibility of multiple primary cancers is to be borne in mind in
considering some of the apparently secondary cancers of the stomach, as
well as in determining whether certain cancers are secondary to gastric
cancer or not.Here the microscopical examination is often
decisive.[85]

[Footnote 84: Case of A. Clark's (_Trans.260), and a similar one reported by J. B. S. Jackson in _Extr.[Footnote 85: The subject of multiple primary cancers is considered by
Kauffmann (_Virchow's Arch._, Bd.317), and by Beck (_Prager
med.Wochenschr._, 1883, Nos.V. Winiwarter reports a
cancer of the stomach in a patient who died one year seven and a half
months after extirpation of a cancer of the nose.He regards the case
as one of multiple primary cancer.]{566} Gastric cancer often causes important secondary changes in the
coats and the lumen of the stomach.In the neighborhood of the tumor
are often found hypertrophy of the muscular coat and fibrous thickening
of the submucous coat.Polypoid hypertrophy of the mucous membrane near
the cancer is not rare.Not only near the tumor, but over the whole
stomach, chronic catarrhal gastritis usually exists.The most important alterations are those dependent upon obstruction of
the orifices of the stomach.This obstruction may be caused either by a
tumor encroaching upon the orifice or by an annular thickening of the
walls of the orifices.Even without apparent stenosis, destruction of
the muscular layer at or near the pylorus may be an obstacle to the
propulsion of the gastric contents into the duodenum.As a result of
obstruction of the pyloric orifice the stomach becomes dilated,
sometimes enormously, so as to occupy most of the abdominal cavity.The
walls of the dilated stomach, particularly the muscular coat, are
usually thickened, but exceptionally they are thinned.Sometimes with
pyloric stenosis the stomach is reduced in size.This occurs
particularly when a scirrhous growth extends diffusely from the pyloric
region over a considerable part of the stomach.Obstruction of the
cardiac orifice or in the oesophagus leads to atrophy of the stomach,
although here also there are exceptions.Above the obstruction the
oesophagus is often dilated.An existing obstruction may be reduced or
removed by ulceration or sloughing of the tumor.Both dilatation and contraction of the stomach may attend gastric
cancer without any involvement of the orifices of the stomach in the
cancerous growth.The cavity of the stomach may be so shrunken by
scirrhous thickening and contraction of the gastric walls that it will
hardly contain a hen's egg.Irregular deformities in the shape of the
stomach, such as an hour-glass shape and diverticular recesses, may be
caused by gastric cancer.Changes in the shape of the stomach and the weight of the tumor may
cause displacements of pyloric cancers, so that these tumors have been
found in nearly all regions of the abdomen, and even in the true
pelvis.[86] Such displaced cancers usually contract adhesions with
surrounding parts.[Footnote 86: Lebert, _op.It is not necessary to dwell upon the formation of adhesions which may
bind the stomach to nearly all of the abdominal organs, most frequently
to the liver, the pancreas, the intestine, and the anterior abdominal
wall.Adhesions of pyloric cancers are found in at least two-thirds of
the cases, and probably oftener.[87]

[Footnote 87: Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter found adhesions recorded in
370 out of 542 pyloric cancers.In considering the propriety of
resection of gastric cancers it has become a matter of importance to
know in what proportion of cases adhesions are present.I agree with
Ledderhose and with Rydygier in believing that adhesions are present
oftener than appears from Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's statistics.The fact that adhesions are not noted in post-mortem records of gastric
cancer cannot be considered proof of their absence.Little has been
done in the study of gastric cancer from a surgical point of view.Metastases and adhesions were absent in only 5 out of 52 cases of
pyloric cancer in which either pylorectomy or exploratory laparotomy
was performed (Rydygier).]Cancer of the stomach in the majority of cases is accompanied with
{567} metastases in other parts of the body.In 1120 cases of gastric
cancer secondary cancers were present in 710, or 63.4 per cent., and
absent in 410, or 36.6 per cent.[88] In about two-thirds of the cases,
therefore, secondary deposits were present.[Footnote 88: These cases are from Habershon, _op.i.; and Gussenbauer and Von
Winiwarter, _loc.cit._]

In order to determine the relative frequency of the secondary deposits
in various organs of the body, I have constructed the following table,
based upon an analysis of 1574 cases of cancer of the stomach in which
the situation of the metastases were given:[89]

  Lymphatic glands.551  35.0%
  Liver.475  30.2%
  Peritoneum, omentum, and intestine.357  22.7%
  Pancreas.122   7.8%
  Pleura and lung.98   6.2%
  Spleen.26   1.7%
  Brain and meninges.9   0.6%
  Other parts of the body.92   5.8%

[Footnote 89: These cases include, in addition to those cited in the
preceding foot-note, those of Dittrich (_Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.), Wrany (_ibid._, vols.Metastases in the intestine formed only
a small number of those under the heading peritoneum, omentum, and
intestine, but as they were all included together in Gussenbauer's
large statistics, the intestinal metastases could not well be placed
separately.In 673 cases the peritoneum and omentum were cancerous in
21.7 per cent.]Secondary cancerous deposits are probably even more frequent in the
lymphatic glands than appears from the table.In 1153 cases of gastric
cancer in which the situation of the affected lymphatic glands is
specified, the abdominal glands, and chiefly those near the stomach,
were the seat of cancer in 32-1/2 per cent.In Lange's 210 cases the
cervical glands were affected in 4.3 per cent.In other statistics this
percentage is much smaller.In nearly one-third of the cases there are
secondary cancers in the liver.These may attain an enormous size in
comparison with the tumor of the stomach.Cancer of the peritoneum and
of the omentum is found in about one-fifth of the cases of gastric
cancer.The spleen is rarely involved, except by continuous growth of a
cancer of the fundus or in cases of widespread distribution of cancer
through the aortic circulation.Cancer of the liver increases the
liability to metastases in the lungs, but the latter may be present
without any cancerous deposits in the liver.Secondary cancers may be
present in the suprarenal capsules, the kidneys, the ovaries, the
heart, the thoracic duct, the bones, the skin, etc.In an interesting
case reported by Finlay[90] the subcutaneous tissue of the trunk was
thickly studded with small nodules, of which two were excised during
life and found to be cylindrical epitheliomata.This led to the
diagnosis of a primary tumor of the same nature in the stomach or in
the intestine.At the autopsy was found a cylindrical epithelioma of
the stomach which had not given rise to characteristic symptoms.Secondary cancer of the intestine is rare if the deposits in the
peritoneal coat be {568} excepted.Several cancerous ulcers or multiple
cancerous nodules may be found along the intestinal tract, involving
the mucous and the submucous coats.[91] These metastases seem best
explained by the theory of implantation of cancerous elements which
have been carried from the primary growth in the stomach into the
intestine.In some of the cases the idea of multiple primary cancers
may also be entertained.Unfortunately, in Roseler's case of multiple skin-cancers with an
ulcerated cancer of the stomach no microscopical examination of the
skin-nodules was made.The interpretation of this case is therefore
doubtful (_Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.[Footnote 91: Cases in point are recorded by Wrany (_loc.cit._), Blix
(_Virchow u. Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1876, ii.207), Lange,
Katzenellenbogen, and Lebert.]It is not rare for gastric cancer to cause secondary deposits in the
stomach itself.Sometimes it is difficult to decide which of two or
more cancers in the stomach is the primary growth, as in Ripley's case
of ulcerated cancer of the cardiac orifice with a similar growth around
the pyloric orifice.[92] It is probable that in very rare instances
multiple primary cancers may develop in the stomach.[Footnote 92: J. H. Ripley, _Trans.Maurizio has also reported a case of scirrhous cancer of the cardia
with scirrhous cancer of the pylorus (_Annal.di Medicina_, Oct.,
1869).A similar case was observed by Barth (_Gaz.hebdom._, 1856, No.Cancerous metastases are produced by the transportation of cancerous
elements by the lymphatic current or by the blood-current.In a number
of instances the portal vein or some of the branches which help to form
it have been found plugged with a cancerous mass which may or may not
be organized.[93] The cancer in these cases has burst through the walls
of the vessel into the lumen, where it may grow both in the direction
and against the direction of the current.On serous surfaces, and
probably also, although rarely, on mucous surfaces, secondary cancers
may develop from cancerous particles detached from a parent tumor and
scattered over the surface as a kind of seminium.[Footnote 93: Cases of this kind have been reported with especial
fulness by Spaeth (_Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.432), Acker
(_Deutsches Arch.173), and Audibert (_De la
Generalisation du Cancer de l'Estomac_, Paris, Thesis, 1877).]Mention has already been made of the invasion of parts adjacent to the
stomach by the continuous growth of gastric cancer.In this way
lymphatic glands, the liver, the pancreas, the omenta, the transverse
colon, the spleen, the diaphragm, the anterior abdominal wall, the
vertebrae, the spinal cord and membranes, and other parts may be
involved in the cancerous growth.Under the head of Complications reference has already been made to
various lesions which may be associated with gastric cancer.As regards
the manifold complications caused by perforation of gastric cancer, in
addition to what has already been said the article on gastric ulcer may
be consulted.In general, the various fistulous communications caused
by gastric cancer are less direct than those produced by gastric ulcer.The wasting of various organs of the body in cases of gastric cancer
may be found on post-mortem examination to be extreme.Habershon
mentions a case in which the heart of a woman forty years old weighed
only 3-1/2 ounces after death from cancer of the pylorus.As in other
profoundly anaemic states, the embryonic or lymphoid alteration of the
marrow of the bones is often present in gastric cancer.PATHENOGENESIS.--The problems relating to the ultimate causation and
origin of gastric cancer belong to the pathenogenesis of cancer in
general.Our knowledge with reference to these points is purely
hypothetical.It will suffice in this connection simply to call
attention to {569} Virchow's doctrine, that cancer develops most
frequently as the result of abnormal or of physiological irritation,
hence in the stomach most frequently at the orifices; and to Cohnheim's
theory, that cancer as well as other non-infectious tumors originate in
abnormalities in development, more specifically in persistent embryonic
cells.According to the latter view, gastric cancer develops only in
those whose stomachs from the time of birth contain such embryonic
remnants.These unused embryonic cells may lie dormant throughout life
or they may be incited to cancerous growth by irritation, senile
changes, etc.According to Cohnheim's theory, the orifices of the
stomach are the most frequent seat of cancer on account of complexity
in the development of these parts.For a full consideration of these theories the reader is referred to
the section of this work on General Pathology.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of a recognizable tumor in the region of the
stomach outweighs in diagnostic value all other symptoms of gastric
cancer.The detection of fragments of cancer in the vomit or in
washings from the stomach is of equal diagnostic significance, but of
rare applicability.The discovery of secondary cancers in the liver, in
the peritoneum, or in lymphatic glands may render valuable aid in
diagnosis.Of the local gastric symptoms, coffee-ground vomiting is the
most important.The relation between the local and the general symptoms
may shed much light upon the case.While anorexia, indigestion,
vomiting, and epigastric pain and tenderness point to the existence of
a gastric affection, the malignant character of the affection may be
surmised by the development of anaemia, emaciation, and cachexia more
rapid and more profound than can be explained solely by the local
gastric symptoms.The value to be attached in the diagnosis of gastric
cancer to the absence of free hydrochloric acid from the contents of
the stomach must still be left sub judice.The age of the patient, the
duration, and the course of the disease are circumstances which are
also to be considered in making the diagnosis of gastric cancer.These
symptoms of gastric cancer have already been fully considered with
reference to their presence and absence and to their diagnostic
features.It remains to call attention to the differential diagnosis between
gastric cancer and certain diseases with which it is likely to be
confounded.The points of contrast which are to be adduced relate
mostly to the intensity and the frequency of certain symptoms.There is
not a symptom or any combination of symptoms of gastric cancer which
may not occur in other diseases.Hence the diagnosis is reached by a
balancing of probabilities, and not by any positive proof.Notwithstanding these difficulties, gastric cancer is diagnosed
correctly in the great majority of cases, although often not until a
late stage of the disease.Errors in diagnosis, however, are
unavoidable, not only in cases in which the symptoms are ambiguous or
misleading, but also in cases in which all the symptoms of gastric
cancer, including gastric hemorrhage and tumor, are present, and still
no gastric cancer exists.Cases of the latter variety are of course
rare.In the absence of tumor the diseases for which gastric cancer is most
liable to be mistaken are gastric ulcer and chronic gastric catarrh.In
the following table are given the main points of contrast between these
three diseases: {570}

{571} The diagnosis between gastric cancer and gastric ulcer is more
difficult than that between cancer and gastritis, and sometimes the
diagnosis is impossible.The differential points mentioned in the table
are of very unequal value.An age under thirty, profuse hemorrhage, and
absence of tumor are the most important points in favor of ulcer;
tumor, advanced age, and coffee-ground vomiting continued for weeks are
the most important points in favor of cancer.As cancer may have been
preceded by ulcer or chronic gastritis for years, it is evidently
unsafe to trust too much to the duration of the illness.As has already
been said, it is best to place no reliance in the differential
diagnosis upon the character of the pain.Any peculiarities of the
vomiting, the appetite, or the digestion are of little importance in
the differential diagnosis.Cachexia is of more importance, but it is
to be remembered that ulcer, and even chronic gastritis in rare
instances, may be attended by a cachexia indistinguishable from that of
cancer.Cases might be cited in which very decided temporary
improvement in the symptoms has been brought about in the course of
gastric cancer, so that too much stress should not be laid upon this
point.Enough has been said under the Symptomatology with reference to
the diagnostic bearings of the absence of free hydrochloric acid from
the stomach, of the presence of cancerous fragments in fluids from the
stomach, and of secondary cancers in different parts of the body.One must not lose sight of the fact that the whole complex of symptoms,
the order of their occurrence, and the general aspect of the case, make
an impression which cannot be conveyed in any diagnostic table, but
which leads the experienced physician to a correct diagnosis more
surely than reliance upon any single symptom.In the early part of the disease there may be danger of confounding
gastric cancer with nervous dyspepsia or with gastralgia, but with the
progress of the disease the error usually becomes apparent.What has
already been said concerning the symptomatology and the diagnosis of
gastric cancer furnishes a sufficient basis for the differential
diagnosis between this disease and nervous affections of the stomach.Chronic interstitial gastritis or fibroid induration of the stomach
cannot be distinguished with any certainty from cancer of the stomach.Fibroid induration of the stomach is of longer duration than gastric
cancer, and it is less frequently attended by severe pain and
hemorrhage.Sometimes a hard, smooth tumor presenting the contours of
the stomach can be felt, but this cannot be distinguished from diffuse
cancerous infiltration of the stomach.Non-malignant stenosis of the pylorus is of longer duration than cancer
of the pylorus.The symptoms of dilatation of the stomach are common to
both diseases.Cicatricial stenosis is the most common form of
non-malignant pyloric stenosis.This is usually preceded by symptoms of
gastric ulcer which may date back for many years.Non-malignant
stenosis more frequently occurs under forty years of age than does
cancer.The diagnosis between malignant and non-malignant stenosis of
the pylorus is in some cases impossible.Although the surest ground for the diagnosis of gastric cancer is the
appearance of tumor, there are cases in which it is difficult to decide
whether the tumor really belongs to the stomach, and even should it be
{572} established that the tumor is of the stomach, there may still be
doubt whether or not it is cancerous.The diagnosis between cancerous and non-cancerous tumors of the
stomach, such as sarcoma, fibroma, myoma, etc., hardly comes into
consideration.The latter group of tumors rarely produces symptoms
unless the tumor is so situated as to obstruct one of the orifices of
the stomach.Even in this case a positive diagnosis of the nature of
the tumor is impossible.Of greater importance is the distinction between cancerous tumors of
the stomach and tumors produced by thickening of the tissues and by
adhesions around old ulcers of the stomach.Besides the non-progressive
character of the small and usually indistinct tumors occasionally
caused by ulcers or their cicatrices, the main points in diagnosis are
the age of the patient and the existence, often for years, of symptoms
of gastric ulcer antedating the discovery of the tumor.The long
duration of symptoms of chronic catarrhal gastritis and of dilatation
of the stomach is also the main ground for distinguishing from cancer a
tumor produced by hypertrophic stenosis of the pylorus.Tumors of organs near the stomach are liable to be mistaken for cancer
of the stomach.The differential diagnosis between gastric cancer on
the one hand, and tumors of the left lobe of the liver and tumors of
the pancreas on the other hand, is often one of great difficulty.Tumors of the liver are generally depressed by inspiration, whereas
tumors of the stomach are much less frequently affected by the
respiratory movements.The percussion note over tumors of the liver is
flat, while a tympanitic quality is usually associated with the dulness
over tumors of the stomach.Light percussion will often bring out a
zone of tympanitic resonance between the hepatic flatness and the
dulness of gastric tumors.Gastric tumors are usually more movable than
hepatic tumors.By palpation the lower border of the liver can perhaps
be felt and separated from the tumor in case this belongs to the
stomach.Most of the points of distinction based upon these physical
signs fail in cases in which a gastric cancer becomes firmly adherent
to the liver.The basis for a diagnosis must then be sought in the
presence or the absence of marked disturbance of the gastric functions,
particularly of haematemesis, vomiting, and dilatation of the stomach.On the other hand, ascites and persistent jaundice would speak in favor
of hepatic cancer.There are cases in which the diagnosis between
hepatic cancer and gastric cancer cannot be made.This is especially
true of tumors of the left lobe of the liver, which grow down over the
stomach and compress it, and which are accompanied by marked
derangement of the gastric functions.The frequency with which cancer
of the stomach is associated with secondary cancer of the liver should
be borne in mind in considering the diagnosis.There are certain symptoms which in many cases justify a probable
diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas, but this disease can rarely be
distinguished with any certainty from cancer of the stomach.The
situation of the tumor is the same in both diseases.With pancreatic
cancer the pain is less influenced by taking food, the vomiting is less
prominent as a symptom, and anorexia, haematemesis, and dilatation of
the stomach are less common than with gastric cancer.Of the positive
symptoms in {573} favor of cancer of the pancreas, the most important
are jaundice, fatty stools, and sugar in the urine.Of these symptoms
jaundice is the most common.Should there be any suspicion that the tumor is caused by impaction of
feces, a positive opinion should be withheld until laxatives have been
given.Mistakes may occur as to the diagnosis between gastric cancer and
tumors of the omenta, the mesentery, the transverse colon, the
lymphatic glands, and even the spleen or the kidney.Encapsulated
peritoneal exudations near the stomach have been mistaken for gastric
cancer.Where a mistake is likely to occur each individual case
presents its own peculiarities, which it is impossible to deal with in
a general way.Of the utmost importance is a careful physical
exploration of the characters and relations of the tumor, aided, if
necessary, by artificial distension of the stomach or of the colon by
gas (see page 549).No less important is the attentive observance of
the symptoms of each case.In doubtful cases fluids withdrawn from the
stomach by the stomach-tube should be carefully examined for cancerous
fragments, and the gastric fluids may be tested for free hydrochloric
acid by methods already described.Pyloric cancers which receive a marked pulsation from the aorta
sometimes raise a suspicion of aneurism, but the differential diagnosis
is not usually one of great difficulty.Gastric cancer when it presses
upon the aorta may simulate aneurism, not only by the presence of
pulsation, but also by the existence of a bruit over the tumor.The
tumor produced by aneurism is generally smoother and rounder than that
caused by cancer.The pulsation of an aneurism is expansile, but the
impulse of a tumor resting upon an artery is lifting and generally
without lateral expansion.The impulse transmitted to a tumor resting
upon the abdominal aorta may be lessened by placing the patient upon
his hands and knees.Sometimes the tumor can be moved with the hands
off from the artery, so that the pulsation momentarily ceases.A severe
boring pain in the back, shooting down into the loins and the lower
extremities, and not dependent upon the condition of the stomach,
characterizes abdominal aneurism, but is not to be expected in gastric
cancer.With aneurism gastric disorders and constitutional disturbance
are much less prominent than with cancer of the stomach.[94]

[Footnote 94: In a case of pulsating pyloric cancer observed by Bierner
the symptoms were much more in favor of aneurism than of cancer.The
cancer had extended to the retro-peritoneal glands, which partially
surrounded and compressed the aorta.There were marked lateral
pulsation of the tumor, distinct systolic bruit, diminution of the
femoral pulse, and severe lancinating pain in the back and sacral
region.With the exception of vomiting, the gastric symptoms were
insignificant.The patient was only thirty-three years old (Ott, _Zur
Path.des Magencarcinoms_, Zurich, 1867, p.Spasm of the upper part of the rectus abdominis muscle may simulate a
tumor in the epigastric region.The diagnosis is made by noting the
correspondence in shape and position between the tumor and a division
of the rectus muscle, the superficial character of the tumor, the
effect of different positions of the body upon the distinctness of the
tumor, the tympanitic resonance over the tumor, and, should there still
be any doubt, by anaesthetizing the patient, when the phantom tumor
will disappear.Spasm of the rectus muscle has been observed in cases
of cancer of the stomach.{574} Attention is also called to the possibility of mistaking in
emaciated persons the head of the normal pancreas, or less frequently
the mesentery and lymphatic glands, for a tumor.[95] As emaciation
progresses the at first doubtful tumor may even appear to increase in
size and distinctness.[Footnote 95: In the case of the late Comte de Chambord the diagnosis
of gastric cancer was made upon what appeared to be very good grounds.No cancer, however, existed, and the ill-defined tumor which was felt
during life in the epigastric region proved to be the mesentery
containing considerable fat (Vulpian, "La derniere Maladie de M. le
Comte de Chambord."It is sufficient to call attention to the danger of mistaking, in cases
where the gastric symptoms are not prominent and no tumor exists,
gastric cancer for pernicious anaemia, senile marasmus, or the chronic
phthisis of old age.In some of these cases the diagnosis is
impossible, but the physician should bear in mind the possibility of
gastric cancer in the class of cases here considered, and should search
carefully for a tumor or other symptom which may aid in the diagnosis.The possibility of mistaking gastric cancer accompanied with peritoneal
exudation for cirrhosis of the liver or for tubercular peritonitis is
also to be borne in mind.The diagnosis of the position of the cancer in the stomach can usually
be made in cases of cancer of the cardia or of the pylorus.The
symptoms diagnostic of cancer of the cardia are dysphagia,
regurgitation of food, obstruction in the passage of the oesophageal
bougie, and sinking in of the epigastric region in consequence of
atrophy of the stomach.It has already been said that catheterization
of the oesophagus does not always afford the evidence of obstruction
which one would expect.Cancerous stenosis of the cardia is to be
distinguished from cicatricial stenosis in this situation.The
diagnosis is based upon the history of the case, which is generally
decisive, and upon finding fragments of cancer in the tube passed down
the oesophagus.That the cancer is seated at the pylorus is made evident by the
situation of the tumor (see p.561) and by the existence of dilatation
of the stomach.There are many more causes of stenosis of the pylorus
than of stenosis of the cardia, so that, notwithstanding the absence of
tumor, cancer of the cardia is often more readily diagnosticated than
cancer of the pylorus.The greatest difficulty in diagnosis is presented by cancers which do
not obstruct the orifices of the stomach.Many of these cancers run an
almost latent course so far as the gastric symptoms are concerned, and
in case they produce no recognizable tumor and are unattended with
hemorrhage, the difficulties in their diagnosis are almost
insurmountable.In general, a diagnosis of the particular form of cancer which is
present cannot be made, nor is such a diagnosis of any practical value.In very exceptional cases such a diagnosis might be made by the
examination of secondary subcutaneous cancers[96] or of fragments found
in the fluids obtained from the stomach.[Footnote 96: As for example, in Finlay's case, already referred to (p.It is not safe to trust implicitly in this criterion, as the
subcutaneous tumors may be of a different nature from the tumor of the
stomach, as in an interesting case observed by Leube (_op.Although the diagnosis of gastric cancer can generally be made before
the death of the patient, unfortunately a positive diagnosis in the
early stages of the disease is usually impossible.Should resection of
cancer {575} of the stomach become a legitimate operation in surgery,
it will be of the utmost importance to make the diagnosis in an early
stage of the disease.Only those cases are suitable for resection in
which there are no secondary deposits, the general health of the
patient is in fair condition, and extensive adhesions have not been
formed.It was to be hoped that the ingenious instrument devised by
Mikulicz for exploring the interior of the stomach by electrical
illumination would prove a valuable aid in diagnosis.The gastroscope
in its present construction, however, has proved of little value.[97]
It is, moreover, difficult to manipulate, and is not free from danger
to the patient.We may be permitted, however, to hope for improvement
in this direction.[Footnote 97: Mikulicz has observed with the gastroscope in a case of
pyloric cancer immobility of the pylorus and absence of rugae in the
mucous membrane of the pyloric region (_Wiener med.Wochenschr._, 1883,
No.It does not seem probable that there can be anything peculiar
to cancer in these appearances.]In cases in which there is reasonable suspicion of the existence of
gastric cancer, and in which there is proper ground to contemplate
resection of the tumor, it is justifiable to make an exploratory
incision into the abdomen.It can then be decided whether or not cancer
exists, and whether the case is suitable for operation.When this
incision is made with all of the precautions known to modern surgery,
it is attended with little or no danger,[98] and it should not be made
except by surgeons who are practically familiar with these precautions.[Footnote 98: Of 20 exploratory incisions for tumor of the stomach
performed by Billroth, not one had ended fatally (_Deutsche med.Wochenschrift_, 1882, ii.).]PROGNOSIS.--There is no proof that cancer of the stomach has ever ended
in recovery.It may be admitted that partial cicatrization of gastric
cancer may occur.We have, however, no sufficient reason to believe
that cancer of the stomach has ever been completely destroyed by any
process of nature or by any medicinal treatment.A successful resection of a cancer of the pylorus by Billroth in
January, 1881, made a great sensation in the medical world.Since that
time the operation has been performed successfully ten times, and with
fatal issue twenty-seven times.A radical cure has not, however, been
effected, although life has been prolonged for a year and a half after
the operation.[99] The possibility of permanent cure of gastric cancer
by extirpation must be admitted.Enthusiasm over this possibility,
however, is seriously lessened by the fact that a radical cure is not
to be expected unless the operation is undertaken when the tumor is of
small size, has produced no distant metastases, is free from many
adhesions, and the patient is not greatly prostrated.In view of the
difficulty of diagnosis in the early stages it is not likely that these
favorable conditions can be fulfilled except in the rarest instances.Metastases may already exist when the tumor is small and before it has
given rise to any symptoms.[100] Pylorectomy, moreover, will probably
be successful in the hands of only comparatively few surgeons.It is
therefore but a feeble glimmer of hope {576} which is now admitted to
the hitherto relentlessly fatal forecast of this disease.[Footnote 99: Several of the patients are still living (1884), but, so
far as I can learn, no patient has survived the operation more than a
year and a half.][Footnote 100: Birch-Hirschfeld relates a case in which a non-ulcerated
cancerous tumor not larger than a silver half-dollar was found in the
pyloric region of the stomach of a woman who died from injury.The
tumor had given rise to no symptoms.Nevertheless, numerous metastases
existed in the lymphatic glands of the omentum and of the lesser
curvature (_Jahresb.d. gesellschaft f. Natur u. Heilk.im Dresden_
[1882-83], 1883, p.TREATMENT.--Even up to the present time various drugs have been vaunted
as effecting a radical cure of cancer of the stomach.Some of these,
such as mercury, are positively harmful; others, such as conium,
belladonna, and condurango, are often palliative; but not one has been
proven to be curative.Since its recommendation by Friedreich in 1874,
condurango has enjoyed the greatest vogue.The few observations in
which, under the use of this agent, tumors, real or apparent, of the
stomach have lessened in size or disappeared, admit of other
interpretations than as cures of gastric cancer.There is, however,
considerable testimony as to the virtues of condurango as a stomachic.In some cases it relieves the pain, vomiting, and indigestion of
gastric cancer, but in many cases it is employed without benefit.The
drug which passes by the name of condurango in the market is a very
variable preparation.According to Friedreich's directions, decoction
of condurango is prepared as follows: Macerate oz.condurango for twelve hours with fluidounce xij of water; then boil
down to fluidounce vj and strain.The dose is a tablespoonful two or
three times daily.The decoction of condurango may be combined with
syr.While all specific treatment of gastric cancer is to be abandoned, much
can be done for the relief and comfort of the patient.In general, the indications are similar to those in gastric ulcer.It
is not necessary, however, to restrict the diet to the same extent as
in gastric ulcer.The patient's tastes may be consulted to a
considerable extent.Still, it will be found, as a rule, that the
patient is most comfortable when his diet is confined to
easily-digestible substances, such as milk, beef-juice, Leube's
beef-solution, rare beefsteak, and other articles mentioned under the
treatment of gastric ulcer.The pain of gastric cancer will usually require the administration of
opium in some form.There is manifestly not the same objection to the
employment of narcotics in a necessarily fatal disease like cancer as
in ulcer of the stomach.Opium may be given in pill form or as the
tincture or deodorized tincture, or often most advantageously as
hypodermic injections of morphia, to which atropia may be added.Vomiting is sometimes controlled by regulation of the diet,
particularly by iced milk.For this symptom also opium or morphia is
often necessary.In addition, the customary remedies for relief of
vomiting, such as bits of ice, iced champagne, soda-water, hydrocyanic
acid, oxalate of cerium, creasote, may be tried.Cold or hot
applications to the abdomen and mild counter-irritants, such as mustard
plaster or turpentine stupes, sometimes afford relief.If the vomiting
be incoercible, it may be well to administer food for a short time
exclusively by the rectum, and in case of stenosing cancer of the
cardia this method of administering food may be the only one possible.Acid eructations and heartburn are often relieved by the antacids, as
bicarbonate of sodium, lime-water, or calcined magnesia.Against
fermentative processes in the stomach have been recommended salicylate
of sodium, creasote, carbolic acid, and the alkaline hyposulphites.Charcoal tablets are as useful as, and less likely to disagree than,
other antifermentatives.{577} In view of V. d. Velden's
investigations, already mentioned, the administration of dilute
hydrochloric acid in an hour after a meal is indicated.Excellent results have been obtained by regularly washing out the
stomach in cases of gastric cancer, particularly in pyloric cancer with
dilatation of the stomach.By this procedure pain, indigestion, and
vomiting are often greatly relieved, and the patient experiences a
renewed sense of well-being.Unfortunately, the benefit is only
temporary.The syphon process is most conveniently employed.Contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube are copious
gastrorrhagia and great weakness of the patient.When constipation is not relieved by washing out the stomach, enemata
should be employed.Drastic purgatives should not be given.For diarrhoea opium may be given, particularly in the form of small
enemata of starch and laudanum.Scanty hemorrhage in the form of coffee-grounds vomiting requires no
treatment.Copious haematemesis is to be treated according to the
principles laid down under the treatment of hemorrhage from gastric
ulcer.Discussion of the surgical treatment of gastric cancer of course does
not belong to this work.The opinion entertained by the physician as to
the propriety of surgical interference in gastric cancer is not,
however, a matter of indifference, for cases of gastric cancer come
first into the hands of the physician, and generally only by his
recommendation into those of the surgeon.So long as the physician
stands absolutely powerless before this disease, his general attitude
as to the propriety of surgical interference should not be one of
hostility.Experience only can determine the justification of surgical
operation in cases of gastric cancer.As yet, it is too soon to express
a positive opinion as to the value of resection of gastric cancer.Of
37 published resections of cancer of the pylorus, 27 died from the
effects of the operation, and of the fatal cases 18 within the first
twenty-four hours.These results are certainly not calculated to awaken
much enthusiasm for the operation.Still, it would be wrong to draw
definite conclusions from the existing statistics of resection of the
cancerous pylorus, partly because the number of operations is as yet
too small, partly because the operation has been done when it was
certainly unwarrantable according to the best judges (Billroth,
Czerny), and chiefly because the number of operators in proportion to
the number of operations is too great.For the 37 published operations
there have been 27 operators.Ovariotomy was not considered a
justifiable operation until the excellent results of individual
operators were obtained.It is probable that to an even greater extent
resection of the pylorus will become the specialty of certain
operators.Therefore, before concluding as to the value of resection of
cancer of the stomach it is necessary to await the results of
individual surgeons in a series of cases.[101]

[Footnote 101: Already, from this point of view, the operation appears
more hopeful.Czerny has performed 6 resections of the stomach with
only 2 fatal results; 4 of the operations were pylorectomies for
cancer.Billroth has performed the operation 8 times with 3 fatal
results (_Wiener med.Wochenschrift_, 1884, Nos.So much, however, is now certain, that with our present means of
diagnosis the number of cases suitable for extirpation is very
small.[102] A {578} radical cure is to be expected only in the rarest
instances, so that the value of the operation will depend chiefly upon
the condition of the patient after its performance.As regards this
point, the results in the successful cases have been encouraging.In
several instances the terrible sufferings of the patient have given
place to months of comparative health and comfort.[Footnote 102: Billroth at the eleventh session of the Congress of
German Surgeons said that he was amazed at the number of resections of
the pylorus which had been performed.Out of 50 to 60 cases of gastric
cancer, only 1 appeared to him suitable for operation.]In cases of extreme cancerous stenosis of the pylorus which are not
suitable for resection Wolfler proposed forming a fistulous
communication between the stomach and the small intestine
(gastro-enterostomy).The results of the operation have not been
encouraging.Out of six cases in which this operation has been
performed, only two patients lived after the operation.For the same condition Schede proposed making a duodenal fistula
(duodenostomy), but I am not aware that the operation has been
performed.The results of gastrostomy for relief of cancerous stenosis of the
cardia or of the oesophagus have not been encouraging.[103]

[Footnote 103: Of 76 cases of gastrostomy for the relief of cancer of
the oesophagus or of the cardia, only 14 lived over thirty days
(Leisrink and Alsberg, _Arch.Non-Cancerous Tumors of the Stomach.Little clinical interest attaches to non-cancerous tumors of the
stomach.They are comparatively rare and usually unattended by
symptoms.Even should a tumor be discovered, there are no means of
determining the nature of the tumor; and if symptoms are produced by
the tumor, the case will probably be diagnosticated as one of cancer.It is necessary, therefore, in the present work to do little more than
enumerate the different forms of non-cancerous tumor of the stomach.The most common of benign gastric tumors are polypi projecting into the
interior of the stomach.These are usually so-called mucous or
adenomatous polypi, being composed of hypertrophied or hyperplastic
elements of the mucous membrane with or without new growth of submucous
tissue.They may be present in large number (one hundred and fifty to
two hundred in a case of Leudet's).Their development is usually
attributed to a chronic catarrhal gastritis, so that a gastritis
polypora has been distinguished.These polyps are important only when
they obstruct one of the orifices of the stomach, in which case they
may cause even fatal stenosis.Benign adenomata appear less frequently as growths in the submucous
coat of the stomach (Winiwarter).Myomata and myosarcomata, projecting sometimes as polyps either into
the gastric or the peritoneal cavity, may attain a very large size, as
in a case reported by Brodowski in which a cystic myosarcoma of the
stomach weighed twelve pounds.[104]

[Footnote 104: _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Sarcoma, either as a primary or a secondary tumor of the stomach, is
rare.Two cases of secondary lympho-sarcoma of the stomach (primary of
the retro-peritoneal glands) without gastric symptoms have come under
my observation.In a similar case reported by Coupland the symptoms
resembled those of gastric cancer.[105]

[Footnote 105: _Trans.{579} In connection with gastric ulcer mention has already been made of
the occurrence of miliary aneurisms in the stomach, which may be the
cause of fatal haematemesis.Sometimes the mucous membrane is studded with little cysts, as in a
case reported by Harris.[106]

[Footnote 106: _Am.Fibromata and lipomata are very rare.Foreign bodies in the stomach, particularly balls of hair, have been
sometimes mistaken for tumors, particularly cancer, of this organ.Schonborn removed successfully a ball of hair from the stomach by
gastrotomy.[107] Before the operation the tumor was considered to be a
movable kidney.{580}

HEMORRHAGE FROM THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.Hemorrhage from the stomach is a symptom, and not a disease.It is a
result of a great variety of morbid conditions in the description of
which it receives more or less consideration.Already the
symptomatology and treatment of hemorrhage from the stomach have been
considered in connection with its two most important causes--namely,
gastric ulcer and gastric cancer.It remains to give a summary of the
etiology and diagnosis of gastric hemorrhage.Hemorrhage from the stomach is also called gastrorrhagia.The term
haematemesis is not synonymous with gastric hemorrhage, for blood may
be vomited which has simply been swallowed or has passed from the
intestine into the stomach.ETIOLOGY.--The causes of gastric hemorrhage are as follows:

1.Ulcer of the Stomach.--Simple gastric ulcer is the most frequent
cause of abundant hemorrhage from the stomach.Tuberculous gastric
ulcers, typhoid gastric ulcers, and the ulcers of phlegmonous gastritis
are extremely rare causes of hemorrhage.Hemorrhagic erosion of the
stomach, which by many writers is assigned an important place in the
etiology of gastric hemorrhage, is not an independent affection, and in
my opinion is without any clinical significance.Cancer of the Stomach.--(Non-cancerous tumors of the stomach hardly
deserve mention in this connection, so infrequently are they the cause
of gastric hemorrhage.)Traumatism (mechanical, chemical, thermic).--_a_.Acting from
without the stomach: severe injury to the abdomen, as by a blow or a
fall; penetrating wounds of the stomach.Acting from within the stomach: foreign bodies, particularly
sharp-pointed ones; corrosive poisons, as acids and alkalies; other
toxic inflammatory irritants; and very hot substances.Here should also
be mentioned injury from an inflexible stomach-tube and aspiration of
mucous membrane with the stomach-pump.Diseases of the Gastric Blood-vessels.--_a_.Aneurism of the
arteries of the stomach.Miliary aneurisms have been found by Galliard
and others as a cause of profuse and even fatal hemorrhage from the
stomach.Especially in obscure cases should careful search be made for
miliary aneurisms.Varices of the veins are a not unimportant cause of gastric
hemorrhage.They are most frequently associated with chronic passive
{581} congestion of the stomach, but they may be found without any
apparent disturbance of the circulation.Degenerations of the vessels, particularly fatty and atheromatous
degeneration of the arteries.Probably gastric hemorrhage in
phosphorus-poisoning is to be attributed to fatty degeneration of the
arteries.Amyloid degeneration of the blood-vessels is a doubtful cause
of hemorrhage.Active Congestion of the Stomach.--Here is usually placed gastric
hemorrhage as a result of severe inflammation of the stomach (as acute
catarrhal gastritis), although in these cases the inflammatory
alteration of the vascular walls is an equally important factor.With more probability the so-called vicarious hemorrhages from the
stomach are to be assigned to active congestion.Sceptical as one is
inclined to be as regards vicarious hemorrhages of the menses, the
occurrence of such hemorrhages, although rare, must be admitted.Doubtful, however, are alleged cases of gastric hemorrhage taking the
place of suppressed hemorrhoidal bleeding or of epistaxis.Passive Congestion of the Stomach.--This embraces an important group
of causes of gastric hemorrhage.This hemorrhage is the result of
venous congestion caused by some obstruction to the portal circulation.The obstruction may be--

_a_.In the portal vein itself or its branches within the liver, as in
pylethrombosis, cirrhosis of the liver, tumors, such as cancer or
echinococcus cysts, compressing the portal vein, occlusion of
capillaries in the liver by pigment-deposits in melanaemia, and
dilatation of the bile-ducts in the liver from obstruction to the flow
of bile.Next to ulcer and to cancer of the stomach, cirrhosis of the
liver is the most frequent and important cause of gastrorrhagia.In the pulmonary blood-vessels, as in pulmonary emphysema, chronic
pleurisy, and fibroid induration of the lungs.In the heart in consequence of uncompensated valvular and other
diseases of the heart.For evident reasons, obstruction of the pulmonary or of the cardiac
circulation is much less likely to cause gastric hemorrhage than is
obstruction in the portal vein or the liver.Possibly, gastric hemorrhage which is caused by violent acts of
vomiting may be caused by venous congestion of the mucous membrane of
the stomach.In support of this view, Rindfleisch advances the idea
that the veins in the muscular layers of the stomach, in consequence of
the thinness of their coats, are much more likely than the arteries to
suffer from the compression of the muscle during its contraction.The occasional occurrence of gastric hemorrhage during pregnancy has
also been attributed to passive congestion of the stomach.Acute Infectious Diseases--namely, yellow fever, acute yellow
atrophy of the liver, relapsing fever; less frequently cholera, typhoid
fever, typhus fever, diphtheria, erysipelas, and the exanthematous
fevers, small-pox, measles, and scarlet fever.The cause of gastric hemorrhage in these diseases is not understood.The usual explanation attributes the hemorrhage to dissolution of the
blood-corpuscles and secondary alteration of the walls of the
blood-vessels.Plugging of the vessels with micro-organisms has been
found {582} in only a few instances.The gastrorrhagia of acute yellow
atrophy of the liver has been attributed to dissolution of the blood,
not only by some infectious agent, but also by constituents of the
bile, and also to obstruction of the portal circulation by destruction
and occlusion of capillaries in the liver.Hemorrhagic
diatheses--namely, scorbutus, purpura, and haematophilia.Strictly
speaking, a hemorrhagic diathesis exists in other affections of this
class.Here we may distinguish, first, periodical malarial
hemorrhages from the stomach which are cured by quinia; second,
pernicious gastric malarial fever, of very grave prognosis; and third,
hemorrhages in malarial cachexia due to extreme anaemia.Cases which
have been described as malaria with scorbutic complications belong
mostly to the last variety.Mention has already been made of gastric
hemorrhages attributed to malarial pigmentation of the liver.The most important affections in this category
are progressive pernicious anaemia, leucocythaemia, and
pseudo-leucocythaemia, including the so-called splenic anaemia.The hemorrhage is attributed to dissolution of the
blood-corpuscles by the action of the biliary salts.Gastric hemorrhage is a rare event in Bright's disease, occurring more
especially with small kidneys.In one such case I found that the fatal
hemorrhage was due to the bursting of a miliary aneurism of a small
artery in the submucous coat.Probably in all similar cases the
hemorrhage is referable to disease of the vascular walls.Neuropathic Conditions.--Although ecchymoses in the mucous membrane
of the stomach can be experimentally produced by injury of various
parts of the brain and spinal cord, there is no proof that gastric
hemorrhage which is of any clinical importance is referable to
structural diseases of the nervous system.The occasional occurrence of
gastric hemorrhage in progressive paralysis of the insane, in
tuberculous meningitis, in epilepsy, is to be attributed to other
causes.In lack of a better explanation, however, the gastric hemorrhages which
have been occasionally observed in hysterical women may be classified
here.These constitute not the least important class of gastric
hemorrhages.The hemorrhages from the stomach in chlorosis belong
partly here and partly to anaemia.Melaena Neonatorum.--Although in some cases ulcers have been found
in the stomach or duodenum, and in others a general hemorrhagic
diathesis exists, it must be said that the etiology of this grave
disease is still very obscure.Bursting of Aneurisms or of Abscesses from without into the
Stomach.Idiopathic Causes.--Under this unsatisfactory designation are
included cases which are aptly described by Flint[1] in the following
words: "Hemorrhage sometimes occurs from the stomach, as from the
bronchial tubes, the Schneiderian membrane, and in other situations,
without any apparent pathological connections, neither following nor
preceding any appreciable morbid conditions.It is then to be
considered {583} as idiopathic."A person in apparent health has
suddenly a hemorrhage, often profuse, from the stomach, which is
followed only by symptoms immediately referable to the hemorrhage.The
hemorrhage is naturally the source of great anxiety.Ulcer or cancer of
the stomach or some other grave disease is usually suspected.But the
patient develops no further symptoms, and often never has another
hemorrhage.Whatever hypotheses one may construct for these cases of
so-called idiopathic hemorrhage, the recognition of the clinical fact
of their occurrence is important.[Footnote 1: Austin Flint, _A Treatise on the Principles and Practice
of Medicine_, 5th ed., p.Inasmuch as hemorrhage from the stomach is usually made manifest by the
vomiting of blood, it is important to bear in mind that gastric
hemorrhage is not the only cause of haematemesis.Blood may gain access
to the stomach by being swallowed in cases of hemorrhages from the
nose, mouth, throat, bronchi, lungs, and oesophagus.Blood may also
enter the stomach from the duodenum in cases of simple ulcer of the
duodenum or of typhoid ulcers situated in the upper part of the
intestine.The SYMPTOMS of hemorrhage from the stomach have already been described
in connection with ULCER OF THE STOMACH.MORBID ANATOMY.--As is evident from the enumeration of the causes of
gastric hemorrhage, the lesions found after death are manifold.A
description of these lesions, however, does not belong here.It is
necessary, however, to say a few words concerning the demonstration of
the source of the hemorrhage.The hemorrhage is arterial, venous, or capillary in origin.Ulcerations
from the stomach into the heart, which have been mentioned in
connection with gastric ulcer, are too infrequent to come into
consideration in this connection.If the bleeding is from a large
artery or vein or from a medium-sized aneurism or varix, the
demonstration of its source is not difficult.Often, however, in cases
of fatal gastric hemorrhage the search for the source of the hemorrhage
has proved fruitless.It is supposed that in many such cases the
hemorrhage is due to diapedesis, and not to rupture of a blood-vessel
(rhexis).Doubtless, small gastric hemorrhages, particularly those into
the tissues of the stomach, are often the result of diapedesis, but in
cases of profuse hemorrhages from the stomach where the source of the
hemorrhage is not demonstrable after death, the convenient assumption
of hemorrhage by diapedesis, in my opinion, plays too important a role.In most cases of profuse gastrorrhagia the symptoms point to a sudden
outpouring of blood into the stomach; and our knowledge of diapedesis
does not warrant the belief that the red blood-corpuscles can escape
through the unsuffused walls of the vessels with that combined rapidity
and abundance which would be necessary to explain the sudden and
profuse hemorrhage.In these cases hemorrhage by rhexis is altogether
more probable even when ruptured vessels cannot be demonstrated.It
often requires a long-continued and careful search to find a small
vessel which is ruptured.In the case above mentioned of fatal
haematemesis from miliary aneurism over an hour of continuous searching
was required to find the pinhole perforation in the mucous membrane in
the bottom of which lay the small aneurism.Chiari[2] has reported a
fatal gastric hemorrhage due to rupture of a submucous vein.The
erosion of the mucous membrane was not larger than a hempseed.The
examination of the mucous membrane is often much impeded by the {584}
closely-adherent mucus and blood, which have to be carefully removed.Injection of the vessels of the stomach with fluid may aid in finding a
ruptured vessel.It is not intended to assert that in all cases of
fatal gastric hemorrhage a painstaking search would reveal the source
of the hemorrhage, but it is believed that cases of fatal gastric
hemorrhage would less frequently be reported with negative anatomical
result as hemorrhages by diapedesis, or by exhalation, or as
parenchymatous or capillary hemorrhages, if such a search were made.Wochenschr._, 1882, No.DIAGNOSIS.--Undoubtedly, small hemorrhages into the stomach often occur
which are not recognized, and in the absence of vomiting even larger
hemorrhages may escape detection unless a careful examination of the
stools be made.The patient may die from abundant gastric hemorrhage
before any blood has been vomited or has passed by the bowels.When there is doubt whether the black color of the stools is due to
blood or to the administration of iron or of bismuth, it generally
suffices to add water to the stools.If blood be present, the water
will acquire a reddish color.Should doubt still remain, then the
microscope, the spectroscope, or the test for haemin crystals may be
called into requisition (see p.Whether black, tarry stools are produced by hemorrhage from the stomach
or by hemorrhage in the upper part of the intestine can be decided only
by the clinical history.If haematemesis be likewise present, the
presumption is strongly in favor of gastric hemorrhage.The diagnosis,
however, between hemorrhage from duodenal ulcer and that from gastric
ulcer is very difficult, and can rarely be positively made.The mere inspection of the vomit is generally sufficient to determine
whether it contain blood or not.Color more or less resembling that of
altered blood may be produced in the vomit by iron, bismuth, red wine,
various fruits, such as cranberries, and by bile.When a careful
inspection by the physician leaves doubt as to the presence of
blood--which will rarely be the case--then here also recourse may be
had to the microscope, spectroscope, and test for haemin crystals.Sometimes blood is swallowed and then vomited by hysterical females or
by malingering soldiers or prisoners for purpose of deceit.In such
cases there are generally no evidences of acute anaemia or of gastric
disease.The blood of some animals can be distinguished by the
microscope from human blood.When suspicion of deceit exists, there are
generally various ways of entrapping the patient.When blood is vomited by nursing infants the possibility of its coming
from the breast of the mother is to be thought of.Sometimes blood from the nose or throat is swallowed, particularly when
the bleeding occurs during the night.This blood may subsequently be
vomited.The inspection of the nose or throat will generally reveal the
source of the hemorrhage in such cases.The diagnosis between hemorrhage from the oesophagus and that from the
stomach must be based upon the clinical history.The oesophagoscope,
however, has been successfully employed for diagnostic purposes.Several cases have been reported of fatal hemorrhage from varices of
the oesophagus.Such hemorrhage cannot be distinguished from gastric
hemorrhage.Much more frequently arises the question whether the hemorrhage is from
the stomach or from the lungs.Sometimes the decision of this point
{585} is very difficult, and it may even be impossible, especially when
the physician is obliged to trust only to the statements of the patient
or his friends.Difficulty in the diagnosis results mainly from the
fact that coughing and vomiting of blood are often associated with each
other.With haemoptysis blood may be swallowed and then vomited, and
with haematemesis more or less coughing occurs.The diagnosis is to be
based upon the points contained in the following table:

          HAEMOPTYSIS.|          HAEMATEMESIS.Usually preceded by symptoms

As it is important that the patient should be as quiet as possible
during and for some time after the hemorrhage, any physical examination
which disturbs the patient, such as percussing the posterior part of
the chest or palpating the abdomen, should be avoided.The diagnosis of the many causes of gastric hemorrhage belongs to the
description of the various diseases which have been enumerated under
the etiology.PROGNOSIS.--It is exceptional for gastric hemorrhage to prove
immediately fatal.According to Fox, such an occurrence is more
frequent with cirrhosis of the liver than with ulcer or cancer of the
stomach.The ultimate result of the hemorrhage depends greatly upon the
previous condition of the patient.If this condition was good, he often
rallies from the most desperate prostration immediately following the
hemorrhage.A previously enfeebled patient is of course more likely to
yield to the further anaemia and exhaustion caused by profuse
hemorrhage.Although the symptoms of gastric ulcer and of cirrhosis of
the liver are sometimes improved after hemorrhage from the stomach,
nevertheless this hemorrhage can never be regarded as a welcome event.For the treatment of gastric hemorrhage see ULCER OF THE STOMACH.{586}

DILATATION OF THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.DEFINITION.--By dilatation of the stomach is understood a condition in
which the stomach is abnormally large and is unequal to the performance
of its normal functions.It will be observed that this definition of
dilatation of the stomach includes an anatomical disturbance and a
physiological disturbance.A stomach which, although unusually large,
performs its functions perfectly well is not, in the clinical sense, a
dilated stomach.The most characteristic functional disturbance in
dilatation of the stomach is delay in the propulsion of the gastric
contents into the intestine in consequence of inability of the muscular
coat of the stomach to perform the work imposed upon it.This muscular
insufficiency, whether primary or secondary, necessarily involves
disorder of the digestive and absorptive powers of the stomach.SYNONYMS.--Dilatatio ventriculi; Gastrectasia.It has been proposed to
call the early stages of the disease insufficiency of the stomach
(Rosenbach).The condition described by Chomel as dyspepsia of liquids
is undoubtedly dilatation of the stomach.HISTORY.--Dilatation as a disease of the stomach is not mentioned by
writers of antiquity.Fabricius ab Aquapendente in 1623 was among the
first to record an observation of dilatation of the stomach.During the
following century cases of dilatation of the stomach were recorded more
as curiosities than as of clinical interest.Most cases were attributed
to eating or drinking inordinate quantities.In 1743, Widman clearly
recognized stenosis of the pylorus as a cause of gastric dilatation.In
the works of Van Swieten, Morgagni, Lieutaud, and J. P. Frank, during
the latter half of the last century, different causes of dilatation of
the stomach are recognized.The last writer especially distinguishes
clearly between dilatation due to stenosis and that due to atony.The
data as to the symptoms of the disease were still very imperfect.In
1833, Duplay[1] published an important article in which the main points
in the causation and symptomatology of dilatation of the stomach are
clearly described.After this time the important works on the practice
of medicine or on diseases of the stomach contain, in the main, correct
descriptions of the disease under consideration.Since the publication
in 1869 of Kussmaul's memorable article[2] on the treatment of
dilatation of the stomach by the {587} stomach-pump, much greater
attention has been paid to this disease than ever before, so that the
literature upon this subject during the last fifteen years is very
considerable.In 1875, Penzoldt published an excellent monograph upon
dilatation of the stomach.[3]

[Footnote 1: _Arch.[Footnote 2: _Deutsches Arch.Kussmaul
first employed the stomach-pump in dilatation of the stomach in 1867,
and in that year he reported a successful result (_Schmidt's Jahrb._,
Bd.[Footnote 3: _Die Magenerweiterung_, Erlangen, 1875.To this work I am
indebted for most of the historical data in the text.]ETIOLOGY.--Dilatation of the stomach is the result of inability of this
organ to propel its contents into the intestine within the normal space
of time.In the performance of this mechanical work three factors are
involved--namely, the muscular force of the stomach, the quantity and
quality of the gastric contents, and the size of the opening between
the stomach and the intestine.All causes of dilatation of the stomach
may be referred to abnormalities of one or more of these factors.The most important group of causes is represented by stenosis of the
pyloric orifice or of the adjacent part of the stomach or of the
intestine.[4] Most cases of hypertrophic dilatation of the
stomach--that is, dilatation with hypertrophy of the muscular walls of
the stomach--are produced by causes belonging to this group.[Footnote 4: Dilatation of the stomach in consequence of intestinal
obstruction below the duodenum is so rare that no further attention is
given to the subject in the present article.The term pyloric stenosis
is often used in the course of the article to include any obstruction
to the passage of the contents of the stomach into the intestine,
whether the obstruction be in the duodenum, the pyloric orifice, or the
pyloric region.]The most frequent cause of pyloric stenosis is carcinoma, either in the
form of a diffuse infiltration of the gastric walls in this region or
as a tumor projecting into the cavity of the pyloric portion of the
stomach.Next in frequency are cicatricial growths resulting from
simple ulcer involving the pyloric region.Much less frequent are
similar cicatricial stenoses of the pylorus resulting from ulcers
produced by swallowing corrosive poisons.Simple hypertrophy of the
coats of the stomach in the pyloric region, particularly of the fibrous
and muscular coats, is an occasional cause of dilatation.Obstruction
of the pylorus by mucous polypi or by hypertrophic folds of mucous
membrane is so rare as to have little practical interest.Likewise,
stenosis caused by sarcomata, fibromata, myomata, lipomata, and cysts
need be mentioned only for the sake of completeness.Narrowing of the pyloric orifice may be caused also by pressure from
outside of the stomach, as by tumors, particularly cancer, of the liver
and of the pancreas, and by the contraction of fibrous adhesions and
thickenings resulting from perigastritis.Obstruction of the duodenum
by tumors growing in its walls, by cicatrices resulting from ulcers,
and by external pressure may also cause dilatation of the stomach.According to Barker, compression of the duodenum by a wandering right
kidney may induce dilatation of the stomach.The mere association of
dilatation of the stomach and movable right kidney, however, cannot be
considered proof that the former is caused by the latter, for the
subjects of movable kidney (most frequently women with flabby abdominal
walls who have borne many children) are often also favorable subjects
for atonic dilatation of the stomach.Sometimes with dilatation of the stomach the pyloric orifice is found
abnormally small, without any thickening or other appreciable change in
the walls of the pylorus.These cases in adults have been described by
{588} Landerer under the name of congenital stenosis of the pylorus,
but his conclusions are not free from doubt.[5] Congenital stenosis,
and even complete occlusion of the pylorus, has been observed in
infants.[6]

[Footnote 5: _Ueber angeborene Stenose des Pylorus_, Inaug.Diss.,
Tubingen, 1879.In the ten cases studied by Landerer the patients were
all adults, mostly in advanced life.In only one case is it mentioned
that indigestion existed from childhood; the clinical history in all is
incomplete.With the exception of one case there was no marked
hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the stomach, such as is usually
found with benign pyloric stenosis and would naturally be expected with
a stenosis existing since birth.The pyloric orifice varied from 1-1/2
cm.Some of the specimens had been in alcohol for
a considerable time.In my opinion, Landerer has not brought forward
sufficient proof that in these cases stenosis of the pylorus existed
since birth.][Footnote 6: Wunsche, _Jahrb.d. Kinderheilk._, viii.Andral, Forster, and Bull have found congenital stenosis and atresia of
the pylorus.]Spasm of the pyloric muscle, which, according to Kussmaul, may be
referable to erosions, ulcers, and inflammations of the adjacent mucous
membrane, can be admitted only as a hypothetical explanation of some
cases of dilatation of the stomach.Somewhat problematical, although not improbable, is the production of
stenosis of the pylorus or of the duodenum by torsion and by
displacement of these parts.Dilatation of the stomach is sometimes
associated with scrotal hernia, particularly with that containing
omentum or transverse colon.This dilatation Kussmaul explains by the
production of a sharp bend between the movable first part and
comparatively fixed second part of the duodenum, in consequence of the
dragging downward of the stomach by the displaced omentum or transverse
colon.In a similar way Kussmaul believes that the weight of an
over-distended stomach may produce stenosis, and by this mechanism he
explains the occasional occurrence of symptoms of complete pyloric
obstruction when a large quantity of material has accumulated in an
already dilated stomach, and the prompt relief of these symptoms when
the burden of the stomach is removed either by vomiting or by the
stomach-tube.[7]

[Footnote 7: Another explanation given by Kussmaul, and likewise based
upon experiments on the cadaver, is that when the stomach is
over-distended it may rotate upon its own axis, so that the pylorus
acquires a sagittal direction and impinges against the first part of
the duodenum.This rotation of the stomach, however, can occur only
when the abdominal walls are flabby (Kussmaul, "Die Peristaltische
Unruhe des Magens," _Volkmann's Samml.The manner in which stenosis of the pylorus causes dilatation of the
stomach is sufficiently obvious to require no especial explanation.It
is, however, important to know that stenosis of the pylorus may be
compensated, so that even a very considerable degree of obstruction of
this orifice may exist without any dilatation of the stomach.The
obstruction may be completely counteracted by hypertrophy of the
muscular coat of the stomach, particularly of that in the right half of
the organ.Leube suggests that this increased muscular force, by
increasing the peristaltic movements, may also hasten the digestion and
absorption of the food, so far as these processes take place in the
stomach.[8] The timely removal of the contents of the stomach by
vomiting may also prevent over-distension of the organ.Another
compensatory circumstance may be the reduction of the quantity of solid
and liquid food taken by the patient.Conditions are often present,
however, which oppose the development of these {589} compensatory
circumstances.Such conditions are feebleness of the patient,
degeneration of the muscular coat of the stomach, chronic catarrhal
gastritis, insufficient secretion of gastric juice, and delayed
absorption, causing stagnation and fermentation of the food in the
stomach.[Footnote 8: Leube, in _V.Dilatation of the stomach may occur without any obstacle to the
evacuation of the gastric contents into the intestine.The cases of
so-called atonic dilatation of the stomach belong to this class.The
degree of dilatation in these cases is rarely so great as when the
dilatation is caused by stenosis.The cause of gastric dilatation in
the absence of stenosis is not always clear, so that a variety of
hypotheses, more or less probable, have been broached to explain these
obscure cases.Dilatation with unobstructed outlet of the stomach must be referable
either to abnormalities in the quantity or quality of the contents of
the stomach or to weakness of the muscular walls of the stomach.In
most cases both of these causes are combined, and it is not easy to
separate their action.Abnormal gastric contents may be the result of improper ingesta or of
disturbances in gastric digestion.Although in former times the
frequency of excessive eating and drinking as a cause of dilatation of
the stomach was doubtless exaggerated, nevertheless the efficacy of
this cause cannot be doubted.Dilatation of the stomach is said to be
common in people who live almost exclusively upon a vegetable diet and
therefore require large quantities of food.The habitual drinking of
large quantities of beer may cause dilatation of the stomach.The
occasional association of a dilated stomach with diabetes is referred
to the inordinate appetite and thirst which characterize this disease.If the food reaches the stomach imperfectly masticated, the process of
digestion is delayed, and as a result the stomach may become dilated.Indigestible food, particularly that which readily ferments in the
stomach, may be an indirect cause of the disease under consideration.A
similar role may be played by swallowing foreign substances either by
accident or by design.It is not proven that dilatation of the stomach
may be referable to exhaustion of its muscular power by the abuse of
agents which at first excite peristalsis, such as emetics, purgatives,
alcoholics, tobacco, spices, etc.Equally doubtful is the production of
dilatation by the misuse of narcotics, such as opium, which restrain
peristalsis.Of great importance in the production and continuance of gastrectasia
are all circumstances which cause stagnation and fermentation of the
contents of the stomach.These abnormalities of the gastric contents
are referable both to muscular and to chemical insufficiency of the
stomach, but in this connection it is desired to call attention
especially to chemical insufficiency, although in the production of
gastric dilatation this becomes always associated with muscular
insufficiency.In this way chronic catarrhal gastritis is operative in
the causation of gastric dilatation.In consequence of insufficient
secretion of normal gastric juice and of delayed absorption, the food
remains abnormally long undigested in the stomach, and fermentative
changes, with the development of gas, occur.No less important,
however, is the impairment of the muscular power of the stomach in
chronic gastritis.Stagnation and fermentation of the contents of the
stomach occur also in functional or atonic dyspepsia, which is to be
reckoned as a cause of dilatation of the stomach.{590} Naunyn[9]
emphasizes especially the importance of abnormal fermentations in the
stomach (alcoholic, butyric acid, lactic acid, acetic acid
fermentations) both as a cause and as a result of dilatation of the
stomach.Ulcer and cancer of the stomach may cause dilatation by
interfering with the normal digestive processes.[Footnote 9: _Deutsches Arch.We come now to the third and final group of causes of dilatation of the
stomach--namely, those included under weakness of the muscular walls of
the stomach.In the last analysis all causes of gastric dilatation come
under this heading, for even with pyloric stenosis and with excessive
contents a stomach will not dilate so long as its muscular power is
equal to the proper performance of the work which is demanded.In this
connection, however, reference is had especially to those cases in
which impairment or restraint of the muscular movements of the stomach
may be regarded more or less directly as the primary cause of
dilatation of the stomach.Clearest of comprehension are those cases in which the muscular power
of the stomach is impaired by organic changes in the muscular coat.Here may be mentioned partial destruction of the muscular coat,
particularly of that in the pyloric region, by ulcers and by cancers.Thus, ulcers and cancers which in no way obstruct the outlet of the
stomach may cause dilatation of the organ.Inflammatory infiltration
(inflammatory oedema) of the muscular coat has been adduced as a cause
of its weakness in chronic catarrhal gastritis and in peritonitis.Whether this is the proper explanation or not, there is no doubt that
the muscular coat of the stomach may become paretic in cases of chronic
catarrhal gastritis, as well as the subjacent muscle in inflammations
of other mucous membranes, as in laryngitis or in cystitis.Our
knowledge of the relation between degeneration of the muscular coat of
the stomach and gastrectasia is very imperfect.Fatty and colloid
degeneration of the muscle of dilated stomachs is probably to be
interpreted as a secondary change.It is probable that amyloid
degeneration may be a cause of atonic dilatation of the stomach.[10]
Oedematous infiltration of the coats of the stomach in cases of
cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary emphysema, cardiac disease, and
Bright's disease has been assigned as a cause of gastric dilatation,
but without satisfactory evidence.Chronic interstitial gastritis
(cirrhosis of the stomach) is more frequently a cause of contraction
than of dilatation of the stomach.[Footnote 10: Edinger, _ibid._, Bd.The restraint of the muscular movements of the stomach by adhesions and
by dragging downward of the organ in hernia may cause dilatation.Relaxation of the abdominal walls, as in women who have borne many
children, by removing the normal support of the stomach, has been
thought to cause dilatation.Atony of the muscular walls of the stomach may be a part of general
muscular weakness and impaired nutrition.Here belong cases of adynamic
dilatation of the stomach secondary to typhoid fever, cholera,
tuberculosis, anaemia, chlorosis, cachexia, senile marasmus,
neurasthenia.Whether primary paralysis of the stomach can occur or not is wholly
uncertain.We have no positive knowledge as to the occurrence of
paresis of the stomach in consequence of organic or functional changes
{591} in the peripheral or central nervous system.Nor does our meagre
information as to the relation between the nervous system and the
muscular movements of the stomach justify the construction of any
hypotheses as to this point.For the sake of clearness the various causes of dilatation of the
stomach according to the foregoing classification may be recapitulated
as follows.Some of the more doubtful and of the rarer causes are
omitted:

  A. Stenosis of the Pylorus or of the Duodenum.Cancerous;
    2.Cicatricial;
    3.Hypertrophic (of pylorus);
    4.From external pressure;
    5.B. Abnormalities in Contents of Stomach.Ingesta:
      _a_.Excessive;
      _b_.Imperfectly masticated;
      _c_.Stagnation and fermentation in consequence of chemical
         insufficiency of the stomach, as in chronic catarrhal
         gastritis and functional dyspepsia.C. Impairment of Muscular Force of Stomach.Organic changes in muscular coat:
      _a_.Partial destruction by ulcers and cancers;
      _b_.Inflammation, as in chronic catarrhal gastritis and
             peritonitis;
      _c_.Degenerations (fatty, colloid, amyloid);
      _d_.;
      _e_.Mechanical Restraint:
      _a_.By adhesions;
      _b_.Impaired Nutrition and General Muscular Weakness, Adynamic
         dilatation from typhoid fever, tuberculosis, anaemia, etc.As a rule, not a single one, but several, of the above-mentioned causes
are operative in the production of dilatation of the stomach, and it is
often impossible to say which is the primary cause.The various gastric
functions are so dependent upon each other that if one is disturbed the
others also suffer.If, for instance, atony of the muscular coat of the
stomach exists, then in consequence of enfeebled peristalsis the
secretion of gastric juice is insufficient, the food is not thoroughly
mingled with the gastric juice, and the absorption of the products of
digestion in the stomach is interfered with; in consequence of which
the accumulating peptones still further hinder the digestive process.The pylorus remains contracted for an abnormal length of time, as it
naturally is closed until the process of chymification in the stomach
is far advanced, and this process is now delayed.The stagnating
contents of the stomach readily ferment, and the irritating products of
fermentation induce a chronic {592} catarrhal gastritis, which further
impairs the functions of the mucous and muscular coats of the stomach.Thus, in a vicious circle one cause of dilatation induces another.To
assign to each cause its appropriate share in the production of the
final result is a matter of difficulty, and often of impossibility.From this point of view the dispute as to whether in atonic dilatation
the most important factor in causation is chemical insufficiency of the
stomach (impaired secretion of gastric juice, fermentations) or
mechanical insufficiency (weakened muscular action, stagnation),
appears of little practical importance.Of the causes of non-stenotic dilatation of the stomach, the first
place is to be assigned to chronic catarrhal gastritis and to atonic
dyspepsia, as this term is understood by most English and American
writers.As regards frequency, gastric dilatation is a common result of cancer
of the pylorus.It is less frequently caused by simple ulcer.Other
forms of pyloric stenosis than the cancerous and the cicatricial are
rare.Opinions differ as to the frequency of non-stenotic or atonic
dilatation of the stomach according to the manner in which one
interprets the cases.Non-stenotic dilatations which are comparable in
degree to those produced by stenosis are rare.The lesser grades of
atonic dilatation, however, are not rare; but here arises the
difficulty of distinguishing these cases from mere chemical or
mechanical insufficiency of the stomach, which often represents the
early stage of the process.Hence it has been proposed to discard
altogether the term dilatation, and to substitute that of insufficiency
of the stomach.But this latter term is applicable to many affections
of the stomach other than dilatation.A typical case of atonic
dilatation of the stomach is a well-defined disease, and because it is
difficult to diagnosticate its early stages is not sufficient reason
for discarding altogether the designation.Gastrectasia may develop at any age.It is most frequent in middle and
advanced life.The largest number of cases of atonic dilatation is met
with between thirty and forty years of age.[11] The disease occurs in all classes of life.Atonic
dilatation seems to be comparatively more frequent in private practice
and among the favorably situated than in hospitals and among the poor.Kussmaul says that the largest contingent of patients is furnished by
persons who lead a sedentary life and eat and drink a great deal.[Footnote 11: Kundrat and Widerhofer mention no case of stenotic
dilatation of the stomach in children.They say, however, that atonic
dilatation due to over-feeding, and particularly to rachitis, is not
infrequent in children.Widerhofer reports a case of very large
dilatation of the stomach in a girl twelve years old.The cause of the
dilatation was not apparent, and the clinical history was imperfect
(_Gerhardt's Handb.d. Kinderkrankh._, Bd.Lafage
(_These_, Paris, 1881) reports a case of gastric dilatation at ten
years, and another at sixteen years of age.R. Demme (abstract in
_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1883, No.1) reports a case of large
dilatation of the stomach in a boy six and a half years old.Cicatricial stenosis was suspected.Pauli (_De Ventriculi Dilatatione_,
Frankfurt, 1839) reports an enormous dilatation of the stomach,
believed to be due to congenital stenosis.]SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Inasmuch as dilatation of the stomach is usually
secondary to some other disease, the symptoms of the primary disease
have often existed a long time before those of dilatation appear.The subjective symptoms of gastric dilatation are for the most part
directly referable to disturbances of the functions of the stomach.These {593} subjective symptoms alone do not suffice for a positive
diagnosis of the disease.Of the greatest diagnostic importance are an
examination of the vomit and a careful physical exploration of the
stomach.The appetite with dilatation of the stomach may be normal, diminished,
increased, or perverted.In the majority of cases the appetite is
diminished, and there may be complete anorexia.Sometimes the appetite
is increased even to voracity, which is explicable by the small amount
of nutriment which is absorbed.Polyphagia may therefore be a result as
well as a cause of dilatation of the stomach.Often there is excessive thirst in consequence of the small quantity of
fluid absorbed.Dilatation of the stomach in itself does not usually cause sharp
epigastric pain, although it is often associated with painful diseases
of the stomach.There is usually in the region of the stomach a sense of fulness and
weight, which is often distressing and may be accompanied with dull
pain.Heartburn and eructations of gas and of bitter or of acid fluids are
frequently present.The gas is often odorless, but sometimes it is very
offensive.In a number of
cases--which, however, are exceptional--the gas has been found
inflammable, burning usually with a colorless flame (hydrogen), but
rarely, as in a case from Frerichs' clinic, with a bright
yellowish-white flame (hydrocarbons).Detonation upon setting fire to
the gas has been noted.The analysis of the inflammable gas has shown
oxygen and nitrogen in approximately the same proportion as in the
atmosphere, in addition to large quantities of carbonic acid and of
hydrogen, also marsh gas, and in Frerichs' case olefiant gas in small
amount.[12] The oxygen and nitrogen are doubtless simply swallowed, but
the carbonic acid and hydrogen are the result of abnormal fermentations
in the stomach.The origin of the hydrocarbons in the gas is not clear,
but they are probably also produced by fermentation within the stomach.[Footnote 12: One of the analyses in Frerichs' case gave carbonic acid,
17.40; hydrogen, 21.52; marsh gas, 2.71; olefiant gas, traces; oxygen,
11.91; nitrogen, 46.44.In another analysis were found marsh gas,
10.75, and olefiant gas, 0.20.Sulphuretted hydrogen was also present
(Ewald, in _Reichert und Du Bois-Reymond's Archiv_, 1874, p.One of the most frequent symptoms, although not a constant one, of
dilatation of the stomach is vomiting.This symptom often presents
characters which, if not pathognomonic of dilatation, at least raise a
strong presumption in favor of its presence.The act of vomiting is
sometimes accomplished with such ease that it is hardly more than
regurgitation; at other times the act is accompanied with violent and
exhausting retching.A feature particularly characteristic of
dilatation of the stomach is the abundance of the vomited material.In
no other disease is such an enormous quantity evacuated from the
stomach at one time.Blumenthal relates a case in which the vomited
material amounted to sixteen pounds.Such large quantities can
accumulate in the stomach of course only when a considerable time
intervenes between the acts of vomiting.The vomiting of gastric
dilatation does not generally occur until some hours after a meal.It
often presents a certain periodicity, occurring, for instance, at
intervals of two or three days, and followed usually by temporary
relief.It is often observed that as the stomach {594} becomes larger
and larger the vomiting becomes less and less frequent, but at the same
time more abundant.Especially toward a fatal termination of the
disease the walls of the stomach may become so paralyzed and
insensible, and the patient so feeble, that the vomiting ceases
altogether.Another valuable diagnostic sign furnished by the vomit is
the presence of undigested food which has been taken a considerable
time, it may be many days, previously.[13] If the morning vomit
habitually contains undigested food which has been eaten the previous
day, gastric dilatation either exists or is almost sure to develop.[Footnote 13: Ritter relates the case of a man who vomited cherry-pits,
although he had not eaten cherries for over a year (_Canstatt's
Jahresbericht_, 1851, iii.The vomited matter is almost always in a condition of fermentation.If
the vomit be allowed to stand in a vessel, it will separate into three
layers--an upper, frothy; a middle, of turbid fluid, usually yellowish
or brownish in color; and a lower layer, composed of solid particles,
mostly alimentary debris.The vomit often emits an extremely offensive
odor.Different kinds of
fermentation--alcoholic, acetous, lactic acid, and butyric acid--are
present, usually in combination with each other.The microscope
reveals, besides undigested and partly-digested food, crystals of fatty
acids, sarcinae ventriculi, fungus-spores, and various forms of
bacteria, particularly rod-shaped ones.The connection between sarcinae
and fermentative processes is not understood.There is no evidence that
sarcinae are capable of causing fermentation.Of greater importance is
the recognition by the microscope of the spores of the yeast-fungus
(Torula cerevisiae).These spores are rarely absent, and their constant
presence is evidence that fermentation is in progress.Fermentation
often exists in undilated stomachs, but, as has already been mentioned,
it is an important factor in the production of dilatation, so that its
early recognition, if followed by proper treatment (washing out the
stomach especially), may ward off the development of dilatation.The
article on GASTRIC CANCER is to be consulted with reference to the
habitual absence of free hydrochloric acid from the stomach in cases of
cancerous dilatation.If cancer or ulcer of the stomach exists, blood
is frequently present in the vomit, but even in the absence of ulcer or
cancer or other demonstrable source of hemorrhage the vomit in cases of
dilatation of the stomach may exceptionally contain blood, even for a
considerable length of time.If the dilatation be due to pyloric
stenosis, bile is not often found in the vomited material.It has already been mentioned that vomiting is not a constant symptom
of dilatation of the stomach.It remains to add that vomiting may be
present without any of the distinctive features which have been
described.Gastric dilatation, especially in its early stages, is often
accompanied by attacks of acute indigestion (embarras gastrique) after
some indiscretion in diet.Constipation is an almost constant symptom of dilatation of the
stomach.This is naturally to be expected when so little substance
passes from the stomach into the intestine.The constipation is also to
be explained in part by the absence of the usual reflex stimulus which
the stomach during digestion normally exerts upon intestinal
peristalsis, for the constipation is usually much relieved when the
overweighted stomach is systematically washed out.{595} Occasionally, attacks of diarrhoea occur in cases of dilatation
of the stomach.The diarrhoea may perhaps be explained by the sudden
discharge of a large quantity of fermenting material from the stomach
into the intestine.With marked dilatation of the stomach, especially when there is profuse
vomiting, the urine is often considerably diminished in quantity.Particularly in cases treated by systematic washing out of the stomach,
but also in other cases, especially with abundant vomiting, the acidity
of the urine is often much reduced.The reaction may be even
continuously alkaline (Quincke).Crystals of phosphate of magnesium
have been occasionally found in the alkaline urine of gastrectasia
(Ebstein).The urine is prone to deposit abundant sediments.It often
contains an excess of indican.The patient may suffer from attacks of dyspnoea and of palpitation of
the heart in consequence of flatulent distension of the stomach.The general condition of the patient will of course depend chiefly upon
the character of the primary disease and upon the severity of the
gastric symptoms.A moderate degree of dilatation may exist without
much disturbance of the general health of the patient.But as the
disease progresses and the food stagnates more and more in the stomach,
finally to be rejected by vomiting, the patient cannot fail to lose
flesh and strength.In extreme cases of gastrectasia, even without
organic obstruction, the patient may be reduced to a degree of
emaciation and of cachexia indistinguishable from that of cancer.As in
so many other gastric diseases, the patient is usually mentally
depressed and hypochondriacal.He suffers much
from headache and vertigo.He feels incapable of physical or mental
exertion.The skin is dry and harsh; the extremities are cold.Toward
the last, cachectic oedema about the ankles can often be recognized.Kussmaul was the first to call attention to the occurrence of tetanic
spasms in cases of dilatation of the stomach.[14] This symptom has been
observed almost exclusively in an advanced stage of the disease when
the patient has become anaemic and weak.The spasms come on chiefly
after attacks of profuse vomiting or after evacuating large quantities
by the stomach-tube.The spasms may be preceded by a sense of pain or
distress in the region of the stomach, by dyspnoea, by numbness of the
extremities, or by great prostration.The tetanic spasms affect
especially the flexor muscles of the hand and forearm, the muscles of
the calves of the legs, and the abdominal muscles.The spasm may be
confined to one or more of these groups of muscles, or there may be
general tetanic contraction of the muscles of the body.Sometimes
typical epileptiform convulsions with loss of consciousness occur.With
general tetanic spasms the pupils are usually contracted, and often
irresponsive to light.Sometimes there is abnormal sensitiveness upon
pressure over the contracted muscles.The spasms may last for only a
few minutes, or they may continue for several hours, or even for days.After their disappearance the patient is left extremely prostrated.Although tetanic spasms increase the gravity of the prognosis, they are
not necessarily fatal.[Footnote 14: _Deutsches Arch.Kussmaul considers that these spasms are analogous to those occurring
in cholera, and are referable to abnormal dryness of the tissues in
consequence of the extraction of fluid.This view is supported by the
usual {596} occurrence of the spasms after profuse vomiting or after
washing out the stomach.Another explanation, which is perhaps more
applicable to the epileptiform attacks, refers the convulsions to
auto-infection by toxic substances produced in the stomach by abnormal
fermentative and putrefactive changes (Bouchard).[15]

[Footnote 15: Laprevotte, _Des Accidents tetaniformes dans la
Dilatation de l'Estomac_, These, Paris, 1884, p.Coma, with or without the peculiar dyspnoea of diabetic coma, is a rare
occurrence in gastrectasia.(For a description of this form of coma see
page 205.)The temperature in gastric dilatation is generally unaffected.Penzoldt, however, saw two cases with moderate rise of temperature in
the evening, which could not be explained by any complication.On the
other hand, abnormally low temperature with slow pulse has been
observed (Wagner).Essential to the diagnosis of gastric dilatation is the physical
examination of the stomach.If the stomach be markedly dilated, inspection may reveal an abnormal
prominence of the abdominal walls in the epigastric region and
extending a variable distance below the level of the umbilicus.This
prominence is most marked on the left side.When the abdominal walls
are sufficiently thin and relaxed, sometimes the outline of the greater
curvature between the umbilicus and pubes, less frequently that of the
lesser curvature, can be made out.Sometimes the peristaltic waves of
the stomach can be perceived through the thin abdominal walls.By
pressure or by passing the hand across the abdomen gastric peristalsis
may sometimes be excited.The peristaltic movements of the stomach,
however, are rarely perceived except when the dilatation is due to
stenosis and the muscular coat of the stomach is hypertrophied.The
peristaltic waves generally pass from left to right, rarely in the
opposite direction as well.Careful attention to the situation,
direction, and extent of these waves is necessary to distinguish them
from similar peristaltic movements of the intestine.[16] The diminution
in size of the abdominal prominence caused by a dilated stomach after
profuse vomiting or after washing out the stomach may aid in the
diagnosis.[Footnote 16: Kussmaul says that vigorous peristaltic movements of the
stomach may be perceptible through the abdominal walls even when there
is no dilatation of the stomach.Under these circumstances he
attributes the peristaltic commotion to an independent neurosis of the
stomach ("Die Peristaltische Unruhe des Magens," _Volkmann's Samml.An important aid in bringing out the contours of the stomach is the
artificial distension of the organ by the generation within it of
carbonic acid gas, as first suggested by Frerichs.For this purpose
20-30 grains of bicarbonate of sodium and 15-20 grains of tartaric
acid, each dissolved in a little lukewarm water, may be given one after
the other.If the stomach be much dilated and relaxed, it may be
necessary to give much larger quantities of the powders (up to 2-2-1/2
drachms of the soda and a corresponding quantity of the acid).It is
well to have a stomach-tube at hand in order to withdraw the gas in
case unpleasant symptoms develop.Sometimes the stomach fails to become
distended by this procedure.This is due in some cases to the escape of
the gas through the pyloric orifice into the intestine--a condition
designated by Ebstein as incontinence of the pylorus.It may be that
sometimes the gas produces such firm {597} contraction of the gastric
walls that the stomach does not expand by the pressure of the gas.Instead of generating gas, a similar result may be produced by simply
injecting air into the stomach through a stomach-tube, as recommended
by Oser and by Runeberg.The air may, however, escape along the side of
the tube.Palpation of the distended stomach yields an elastic resistance which
has been compared to that of an air-cushion.By palpating carefully
from above downward the greater curvature can sometimes be appreciated,
but in general it is difficult to distinguish it from the transverse
colon.Peristaltic movements may perhaps be appreciated by palpation
when they are not evident on inspection.If a dilated stomach contains
considerable fluid and the abdominal walls are yielding, fluctuation
may be perceived by palpation.The lowest level at which this
fluctuation can be felt may afford a clue as to the position of the
lower border of the stomach, but not much dependence can be placed upon
this sense of fluctuation unless many sources of error in its
interpretation are excluded.By pressing gently and repeatedly against the abdominal walls a
splashing sound can usually be heard in cases of well-marked dilatation
of the stomach (bruit de clapotement).This sound can best be brought
out when the patient is in the recumbent position, with relaxed
abdominal walls, by palpating near the left border of the ribs.The
same sound can be produced by shaking the patient (bruit de glou-glou).This sound may be heard at a considerable distance from the patient, to
whom it may be a source of much annoyance.In itself this splashing
sound is without diagnostic significance, as the condition for its
production--namely, the simultaneous presence of gas and liquid in the
stomach--exists often in healthy persons.By paying attention, however,
to the time at which this sound can be produced after eating or
drinking, and to its greater or less constancy, some diagnostic
importance can be attached to this sign.If the splashing sound can be
usually produced two hours or longer after the ingestion of liquid or
six hours after an ordinary meal, it generally indicates that
dilatation of the stomach exists.[17] It is necessary to exclude
somewhat similar sounds which may be produced in the intestines,
particularly in the transverse colon and caecum.The series of gurgling
sounds which may sometimes be produced in the intestine by palpation
are not likely to be confounded with the single splashing sound
produced in the stomach, but under certain circumstances a splashing
sound may be produced in the transverse colon which cannot be
distinguished from the gastric sound.If a dilated stomach contains a
very large quantity of fluid, the splashing sound cannot readily be
produced.[Footnote 17: Baradat, _Etude sur le Bruit de Clapotement stomacal_,
These, Paris, 1884.Baradat says that this bruit is also diagnostic of
dilatation when it can be produced by palpating below a horizontal line
passing through the junction of the ninth and tenth ribs, but it is
evident that motion might be transmitted to the stomach even when its
greater curvature is above this line by palpating below the level of
the umbilicus.]Leube has pointed out that the end of the stomach-tube (of course the
hard tube), after it has been inserted into the stomach, can often be
felt through the abdominal walls.[18] He says that if the tube can be
felt below a horizontal line passing through the anterior superior
spinous processes of the ileum, dilatation of the stomach may be
positively diagnosed, {598} and the existence of dilatation is probable
if the tube can be felt much below the umbilicus.No force should be
used in trying to make the end of the tube palpable.Of course if the
abdominal walls are thick or very tense the tube cannot be felt.Leube's method is simple and convenient, and applicable to many cases.As will be explained hereafter, a position of the lower border of the
stomach even quite as low as Leube's rule demands cannot be considered
by itself positive evidence of dilatation.[19]

[Footnote 18: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 19: According to Oser, there is a possible source of error in
Leube's method--namely, that the sound may slide along the greater
curvature of the stomach, and even reach the pylorus, so that the end
may be felt higher than the lowest point of the stomach.Considerable
objection has been made to Leube's method on the ground of its danger,
but this objection is based on the assumption that greater energy is
employed in pressing forward the sound than Leube recommends (Oser,
article "Magenerweiterung" in _Eulenburg's Real Encyclopadie_, Bd.The length to which the stomach-tube can be inserted before meeting
resistance may evidently give some idea as to the size of the stomach.The attempt, however, to establish any general law with reference to
this point has not proven successful.In many cases valuable information as to the size of the stomach is
afforded by percussion.Over the greater part of the stomach the
percussion note is tympanitic, sometimes with a metallic quality.Over
the most dependent part of the stomach a dull sound is produced on
percussion in case a sufficient quantity of fluid or solid material is
contained in the viscus.In the upright position, therefore, in
percussing over the stomach from above downward, the tympanitic note
gives place to a dull sound, and this zone of dulness will change with
the position of the patient, so that in the recumbent posture the
dulness may entirely disappear.In order to prove that the region of
dulness belongs to the stomach, Piorry caused the patient to drink a
large quantity of water (a pint to a quart).In a healthy empty stomach
this quantity of water suffices to produce a zone of dulness which does
not descend below the level of the umbilicus.If, however, the dulness
be produced below the level of the umbilicus, it is inferred that
dilatation exists.Penzoldt's modification of Piorry's method gives
more certain results.[20] By withdrawing the fluid from the stomach by
the stomach-tube the dulness may be made to disappear, and by injecting
more fluid the dulness may be made to reappear at will.By noting the
lower limit of the dulness thus produced the position of the lower
border of the stomach may be determined.The farther this lies below
the umbilicus the greater, presumptively, is the degree of dilatation.The artificial distension of the stomach with gas may also aid in
determining its limits by percussion.It must be said that in general
the separation of the lower limits of the stomach from the transverse
colon by means of percussion is a matter of great difficulty, and
sometimes is impossible.[Footnote 20: Penzoldt, _op.Upon auscultation over a dilated stomach sometimes a fine crackling or
sizzling sound, like that audible upon first uncorking a bottle of
soda-water, can be heard.[21] This is referable to the fermentation
which is in progress in the stomach.Eichhorst says that a similar but
finer crackling sound can be heard over a stomach in which carbonic
acid gas is {599} being artificially generated, and that this sound
abruptly ceases when the ear passes below the limits of the greater
curvature.[22]

[Footnote 21: Pauli was the first to record this phenomenon (_De
Ventriculi Dilatatione_, Frankfurt, 1839).]The displacement of neighboring organs by a dilated stomach does not
generally give rise to important physical signs.As the tendency of a
dilated stomach is to sink down in the abdomen, there is not usually
much displacement of the thoracic viscera.If, however, the fundus of
the stomach be distended with gas, the heart may be pushed upward, and,
being pressed against the chest-wall, its apex-beat may be more
forcible and diffused than normal.The tympanitic stomach may impart a
metallic quality to the cardiac sounds.MORBID ANATOMY.--Considerable degrees of dilatation of the stomach are
easily recognized by post-mortem examination.In extreme cases the
stomach occupies all of the anterior region of the abdomen, covering
over the intestines and extending down to the pubes or even into the
true pelvis.Many cases are recorded in which the stomach was capable
of holding six to twelve pints.Godon[23] describes under the name
ventriculi hydrops a hardly credible case in which it is said that the
stomach contained ninety pounds of fluid!In the ordinary cases of
gastrectasia the lower border of the stomach is found somewhere between
the umbilicus and the pubes, frequently about a hand's breadth below
the level of the umbilicus.de Hydrops Ventriculi_, London, 1646.This
celebrated case is described with much detail.For three years the
abdomen was enormously distended, but the patient, a woman, never
vomited.The affection was supposed to be dropsy of the peritoneum.Death occurred in a condition of extreme marasmus.The pylorus was the
seat of a hydatid cyst which extended into the duodenum.The stomach,
which was enormously distended, contained ninety pounds of fluid, in
which floated a great number of hydatid cysts, some of which were
ruptured.The anterior wall of the stomach was adherent to the parietal
peritoneum.The two orifices of the stomach were drawn close to each
other.The length of the stomach equalled a Paris ell.]The fundus, being the most dilatable part of the stomach, is in most
cases disproportionately dilated in comparison with the pyloric region.This excessive dilatation of the fundus is most noticeable in
gastrectasia due to stenosis.In most cases of dilatation the pylorus
sinks down somewhat in the abdomen, but in consequence of the
distension of the lower segment of the stomach the long axis of the
organ is more nearly transverse than normal.If the pylorus be fixed,
the lesser curvature may be drawn down in its middle so as to acquire a
hooked shape.The lesser curvature, which should be covered by the
liver, may be found considerably below its normal level.The dilated
fundus may extend from the left hypochondrium into the left iliac
region.[24]

[Footnote 24: Fogt reports a case in which an enormously dilated
stomach occupied a scrotal hernia of the left side.He refers to two
other similar cases (_Aerztl.Intelligenzbl._, 1884, No.More or less dilatation of the oesophagus is associated with marked
dilatation of the stomach.If dilatation of the stomach be due to
obstruction in the upper part of the intestine, then the pyloric
orifice and the intestine on the proximal side of the obstruction will
be found dilated.The walls of a dilated stomach may be hypertrophied, and such cases are
called hypertrophic dilatation; or the walls may be of normal thickness
or may be thinned, and these cases are called atrophic or atonic
dilatation.In general, the thickness of the gastric walls in
gastrectasia {600} depends upon that of the muscular coat.As a rule,
in cases of pyloric stenosis the muscular coat of the stomach is
hypertrophied.This hypertrophy affects chiefly the muscle of the
pyloric region.The gastric walls in stenotic dilatation may, however,
be of normal thickness or even atrophied.In non-stenotic dilatation
the muscular coat may be either hypertrophied or atrophied, but it
rarely attains the thickness observed in cases of gastrectasia due to
obstruction.Maier and others have repeatedly observed fatty and
colloid degeneration of the muscular fibres of dilated stomachs.[25]
More frequently, however, no degenerative change has been found in the
muscle.[Footnote 25: _Deutsches Archiv f. klin.cit._ Maier designates as colloid degeneration a
peculiar homogeneous, glistening appearance of the muscular fibres.This change is not such as would usually be called colloid, but this
term is loosely used to designate a great variety of pathological
changes.The form of muscular hypertrophy in gastrectasia is chiefly
the numerical.]The mucous membrane in dilatation of the stomach is usually in the
condition of chronic catarrhal gastritis.Although there are various
statements as to atrophy of the gastric tubules and degeneration of the
epithelial cells in the tubes in cases of gastric dilatation,
satisfactory histological investigations of the mucous membrane of the
stomach in this disease are wanting.[26]

[Footnote 26: For satisfactory studies of this nature it is desirable
that alcohol or some preservative fluid should be injected into the
stomach immediately after death.]Atrophy of various abdominal viscera--particularly of the spleen, which
is usually small in this disease--has been attributed to the pressure
of a dilated stomach.This atrophy, however, is probably in many cases
only a part of the general emaciation and anaemia.While well-marked cases of dilatation of the stomach cannot be mistaken
on post-mortem examination, it is important to add that the
pathological anatomist cannot always decide whether or not dilatation
of the stomach exists in the clinical sense.The following
considerations will make this evident: In the first place, the stomach
is a very variable organ as regards its size, so that it is impossible
to set definite limits, and say that a stomach exceeding these is
necessarily dilated, while a stomach not exceeding these limits is
normal.In the second place, it belongs to the clinical definition of
dilatation of the stomach that the organ is insufficient for the
performance of its normal functions.This insufficiency cannot be
determined at the post-mortem table.To determine, therefore, whether
stomachs which fall within certain not easily definable limits of size
are pathologically dilated or not, it is necessary to correct and
complete the results of the post-mortem examination by a knowledge of
the clinical history.[27]

[Footnote 27: To deny all value to post-mortem examination in the
determination of dilatation of the stomach, as has been done, is
absurd.In the majority of cases this examination affords satisfactory
evidence, but for some cases a reservation like that in the text must
be made.Rosenbach in an able article shows the error of regarding
dilatation of the stomach too exclusively from the anatomical point of
view ("Der Mechanismus und die Diagnose der Mageninsufficienz,"
_Volkmann's Samml.DIAGNOSIS.--A considerable degree of dilatation of the stomach can
generally be diagnosticated without difficulty by means of the symptoms
and physical signs which have been described.The most important
diagnostic features relate to the character of the vomiting and to the
physical signs, together with the information afforded by the use of
the {601} stomach-tube.The diagnostic characters of the vomiting are
the large quantity rejected, its occurrence several hours after a meal,
its periodicity with long intervals, the temporary relief afforded, the
presence of undigested food taken a considerable time previously, and
the existence of fermentation.Washing out the stomach will also afford
evidence of stagnation of food.The time generally occupied in the
digestion of an ordinary meal is not over six to seven hours, so that
in health the contents of the stomach removed by the stomach-tube at
the end of this time should usually be free from undigested food.There
are of course individual idiosyncrasies with reference to the time
occupied in digestion, so that implicit reliance cannot be placed on
this diagnostic test.Delayed digestion is in itself no evidence of the
existence of dilatation, but the establishment of the presence of this
symptom may confirm other points in the diagnosis.Simple inspection, palpation, and percussion of the abdomen are
sometimes, although rarely, sufficient for the diagnosis of dilatation
of the stomach.Various devices have already been described which aid
in the physical examination of the stomach, such as the administration
of effervescing powders, the introduction of the stomach-tube, and
Piorry's and Penzoldt's methods of determining the lower border of the
stomach.[28] It {602} is not necessary to repeat here the diagnostic
evidence afforded by physical examination.Excellent service as these
devices often perform, it must be confessed that they do not always
answer the purpose intended.The artificial distension of the stomach
with gas does not enable us always to distinguish intestine from
stomach.If the abdominal walls are thick or very rigid, this method,
like most of the others, is of little or no assistance.Then, as
already mentioned, the administration of the powders may fail to
produce any distension of the stomach, and may possibly mislead by
causing distension of intestine.Moreover, the artificial tympanites
may cause the patient much discomfort.The method of determining the
lower border of the stomach by Piorry's or Penzoldt's method is not
always conclusive.If the stomach be much dilated, it may take a very
large quantity of water to produce an appreciable zone of dulness.If
the transverse colon be distended with feces, it will not be easy to
separate the dulness of the stomach from that of the colon.Moreover,
loops of intestine containing feces or gas may lie over the anterior
surface of the stomach.The use of the stomach-tube simply for
diagnostic purposes is, for various reasons, not always practicable.With due recognition of the important additions during the last few
years to our means of exploring the stomach, it must be admitted that
we are still far from any positive and universally applicable method of
determining the size and position of this organ during life.This
admission is the more necessary in view of the extravagant claims which
have been made for various more or less complicated contrivances for
physical exploration of the stomach.[Footnote 28: Several other methods have been suggested for determining
the size and position of the stomach, but they have not found general
acceptance.Thus, Schreiber attaches a soft rubber balloon to the end
of a stomach-tube, and after its insertion in the stomach inflates it
(_Deutsches Arch.In Neubauer's method the long
end of a syphon-tube communicating with the stomach is bent upward, and
a glass tube is placed in the bent portion.The fluid will evidently
stand at the same level in the tube as in the stomach in case the
atmospheric pressure in both is the same.The atmospheric pressure in
the stomach is produced by using a double tube or by passing a second
tube into the stomach (_Prager med.Wochenschr._, 1879).Purjesz
attached a manometer to a stomach-tube, and thought that he could fix
the position of the cardia by noting the moment when in the passage
downward of the tube the negative pressure changed to positive, but
Schreiber has shown that the manometer may indicate negative pressure
even after the tube has entered the stomach (_Deutsches Arch.It has been asserted that by means of
auscultatory percussion of a stomach artificially distended with gas
the boundaries of the organ can be determined.Leichtenstern considers
the metallic quality of the tone heard over the stomach under these
circumstances more or less characteristic, while Skamper compares the
characteristic tone to that produced by tapping with the finger on the
dorsal surface of the hand of which the valar surface is placed against
the external ear (_Inaug.Diss._, Berlin, 1879, p.It has been
claimed that the sound as of water dropping into a large cavity, which
can be heard when the patient is drinking, can no longer be heard when
the auscultating ear passes beyond the greater curvature (V.
Bamberger).Wunderlich suggests the possibility of feeling the arteries
of the greater curvature through the abdominal walls.Ferber calls
attention in cases of gastrectasia to a strip of dulness, with absent
vocal and respiratory sounds, corresponding to the posterior inferior
border of the left lung.This dulness, which is produced by material in
the most dependent part of the dilated stomach, disappears when the
patient assumes the knee-elbow position (_Deutsche Zeitschr.When it is impossible by other methods to
distinguish the lower portion of the stomach from the transverse colon,
it has been proposed to distend the colon with water, with gas, or with
air injected through a tube passed into the rectum.cit._) found that the length of a tube (hard) or bougie reaching the
bottom of the stomach, estimating from the upper incisor teeth, should
be in a normal stomach at least 5 cm.less than that of the vertebral
column (occiput to coccyx), and at the most not much more than
one-third of the length of the body (1:2.8-1:3.3).In three cases of
gastrectasia he found the length of the tube inserted into the stomach
considerably more than one-third of the length of the body (1:2.4); in
one of the cases this length even exceeded that of the vertebral
column, and in the others it nearly equalled the length of the
vertebral column.Rosenbach's method of determining the elastic and
contractile power of the stomach is ingenious, but hardly of practical
utility.By injecting air into the stomach through a bulb apparatus
attached to the end of a stomach-tube, he is able to tell when the
point of the tube passes beneath the surface of fluid in the stomach by
hearing on auscultation a characteristic moist bubbling sound.Elevation or depression of the level of the fluid can be determined by
withdrawing or by pushing forward the tube.That quantity of fluid
which, introduced into an empty stomach, causes no elevation, or
perhaps causes a depression, of the level of the food in the stomach,
indicates the utmost limit of the elastic and contractile forces of the
stomach (Rosenbach, _Volkmann's Samml.The determination of the position of the lower border of the stomach
does not in itself enable us to infer positively the size of the organ.It may be taken as a general rule that if the lower border of the
stomach be found persistently below the level of the umbilicus, the
stomach is dilated; but there are many exceptions to this rule.Sometimes an otherwise normal stomach preserves in adult life the
vertical position which it had in the foetus, so that its lowest point
may be below the umbilicus.According to Kussmaul, a vertical position
of the stomach is a predisposing cause of dilatation.Occasionally a
stomach has a looped shape, so that without any dilatation of the organ
the lowest point may fall below the level of the umbilicus.It is,
moreover, a clinical fact established by the experience of many
observers that the lower border of the stomach may be found below the
level of the umbilicus without the existence of any symptoms of
dilatation.The uncertainty of the anatomical diagnosis of dilatation of the
stomach in some cases makes it all the more necessary, as has been
repeatedly urged in the course of this article, to make a careful study
of the evidences of disordered gastric functions.The symptoms of most
importance in determining whether the condition called insufficiency of
the stomach is present or not are fermentation of the gastric contents
and the {603} persistent presence of undigested food in the stomach
beyond the limits of normal digestion.It is true that these symptoms
may be present without any dilatation of the stomach, but they are
likely to lead to dilatation if unchecked, and, what is of practical
importance, they require essentially the same treatment as dilatation.A differential diagnosis between chronic catarrhal gastritis and atonic
dyspepsia on the one hand, and the early stages of dilatation of the
stomach on the other, cannot be made with any positiveness.Of course, with our present means of diagnosis the confounding of
dilated stomachs with ascites, ovarian cysts, pregnancy, hydatid cysts
(of each of these errors there are recorded instances), is inexcusable.PROGNOSIS AND COURSE.--The prognosis of dilatation of the stomach
depends first of all upon the nature of the primary disease causing the
dilatation.The prognosis of cancerous dilatation is as unfavorable as
possible.In dilatation due to non-cancerous stenosis the prognosis is
in general more favorable.Life may be prolonged sometimes for many
years, and the patient's condition greatly benefited by proper
treatment.A permanent cure of stenotic dilatation is not impossible,
but it is rarely to be expected.Even if temporarily relieved, the
symptoms of dilatation are likely sooner or later to return and to lead
to a fatal termination.The progress of the disease depends upon the
degree and the stationary or advancing character of the stenosis.In
the article on GASTRIC ULCER mention has been made of the cure of a few
cases of desperate gastric dilatation due to cicatricial pyloric
stenosis by means of resection of the diseased pylorus.In general, the prognosis is more favorable in dilatation without
stenosis.If the degree of dilatation be only moderate, a permanent
cure may often be effected by proper treatment.If, however, the
dilatation be considerable, while the symptoms may be relieved or even
made to disappear for a time, relapses are prone to occur, and a
permanent cure is rarely obtained.Undoubtedly, Kussmaul's publication
in 1869, in giving to us a most valuable method of treatment, at the
same time raised extravagant expectations of the frequency with which
dilatation of the stomach can be cured.Too often the treatment with
the stomach-tube proves only palliative and not curative.The course of dilatation of the stomach is chronic.The mode of death
is usually by inanition, very rarely from rupture of the stomach.TREATMENT.--Reference to the causation of dilatation of the stomach
will show that there is considerable scope for the prophylactic
treatment of dilatation not referable to stenosis or incurable organic
disease.Thus, the correction of the habits of eating or drinking
inordinate quantities, or of imperfectly masticating the food in
consequence of haste or bad teeth or vicious custom, may avert the
development of gastric dilatation.Of especial importance is the timely
treatment of cases of dyspepsia or of chronic catarrhal gastritis which
are accompanied with fermentation or delayed digestion--conditions in
which the stomach-tube is of great service.Of the means at our disposal for meeting the causal and the symptomatic
indications of dilatation of the stomach, the most important by far is
the use of the stomach-tube for the purpose of emptying and of washing
out the stomach.The introduction of this procedure by Kussmaul in 1867
marked a new era in the treatment of gastric disorders.{604} By washing out the stomach we accomplish three important things:
first, we remove the weight which helps to distend the organ; secondly,
we remove mucus and stagnating and fermenting material which irritates
and often inflames the stomach and impedes digestion; and, thirdly, we
cleanse the inner surface of the stomach and obtain the beneficial
influence of the direct application of water, to which various
medicinal substances can be added.It is probable that in removing the
fermenting contents of the stomach we also remove a possible source of
self-infection of the system (see page 596).By accomplishing these things we may possibly also enable the stomach
to regain its lost elasticity and muscular contractility.But unless
the normal elastic and contractile powers of the stomach are restored,
the treatment with the stomach-tube, indispensable as it is for the
relief of symptoms, is only palliative and not curative.Whether or not
this restoration of the stomach to its normal functional activity is to
be expected depends chiefly upon the cause and the degree of the
dilatation.Unfortunately, as has already been stated under Prognosis,
the permanent cure of dilatation of the stomach due to organic
stenosis, although possible, is not to be expected, and the number of
cases in which largely dilated stomachs can be restored to their normal
volume or made to perform permanently their normal functions is small.There remains, however, a considerable number of curable cases--to be
sure, not always easily diagnosticated--in which the muscular coat of
the stomach has not been seriously damaged and in which the dilatation
is generally only moderate.Furthermore, excellent results are obtained
by the use of the stomach-tube in the cases which have been designated
insufficiency of the stomach, and which are closely allied to
dilatation--in fact, often represent its early stage.As has already
been mentioned, the most important criteria of this so-called
insufficiency are the fermentation of the contents of the stomach and
the presence therein of undigested food after the period required for
normal digestion (six to seven hours for an ordinary meal).There are two principal methods of washing out the stomach--one by the
stomach-pump, the other by the siphon process.The stomach-pump is the
older method, and still has its advocates.The pump used by Kussmaul is
the Wyman pump, described by Bowditch in the _American Journal of
Medical Sciences_, vol.This (which is also called
the Weiss pump), as well as other forms of stomach-pump, consists in
principle simply of an aspirating syringe having at its anterior
extremity two openings communicating with the barrel of the syringe.These openings can be alternately opened and closed by means of an
arrangement of valves.Through one opening, which is made to
communicate with an incompressible tube inserted into the stomach (the
other opening being now closed), the gastric contents are drawn into
the barrel of the syringe.This opening is now closed, and through the
other opening the contents of the syringe are discharged through a tube
externally.In a similar way fluid can be drawn into the syringe and
pumped into the stomach.In the siphon process the outer end of the tube inserted into the
stomach is connected with a piece of elastic tubing about three and a
half feet long, in the free end of which is inserted the extremity of a
medium-sized glass funnel.A single elastic tube about six feet long
may also be used.{605} When the funnel is elevated, water which has
been poured into it will run into the stomach.If now, before the water
has all run out, the funnel be depressed below the level of the
stomach, the fluid contents of the stomach will flow out through the
tube according to the principle of the siphon.20 and 21 will
make clear the mode of operation of this process.(The tube shown in
these figures is the Faucher tube, commonly used in France, and
consisting, with the funnel, of one piece.A longer tube than that
shown in the figure should be used.)[29]]

[Illustration: FIG.[29]]

[Footnote 29: From Souligoux, _De la Dilatation de l'Estomac_, Paris,
1883.]Another convenient but somewhat more complicated method of employing
the siphon process is according to Rosenthal's principle, and is
represented in Fig.To the outer end of the stomach-tube is
attached a Y-shaped glass tube, one arm of which is connected with an
elastic tube running to an irrigator, while the other arm is connected
with the discharging tube.Through the irrigating tube water runs into
the stomach, the discharging tube being compressed.If the discharging
tube be opened while the fluid is flowing from the irrigator, and if
then, after the establishment of a column of water in the discharging
tube, the irrigating tube be compressed or the stopcock of the
irrigator be closed, a siphon communicating with the stomach is formed
and empties this organ of its fluid contents.[30]]

[Footnote 30: From Leube, in _Ziemssen's Handb.u.
Therap._, Bd.In the siphon process the tube inserted into the stomach may be an
incompressible hard-rubber tube like that employed with the
stomach-pump, but by far the simplest, most convenient, and safest form
of stomach-tube is the soft, flexible, red rubber tube, resembling the
Jacques catheter, but of course larger and longer.[31] This soft tube
can inflict no {606} injury, and in most cases it is readily
introduced.Generally, the patient himself can best manipulate the
introduction of the tube.After the tube is introduced into the
pharynx, the patient, who should be in a sitting posture, makes
repeated acts of swallowing, by means of which, accompanied by
directing and gently pushing the tube with the fingers, the tube passes
along the oesophagus into the stomach.Often at first the nervousness
and inexperience of the patient occasion some trouble, but after a
little practice he generally succeeds in introducing the tube without
discomfort or difficulty.Before its introduction the tube should be
anointed with a little vaseline or some similar substance.In an adult
the tube is introduced for a length of at least 20 to 25 inches, and in
cases of dilatation of the stomach of course for a greater distance.Whatever form of stomach-tube be used, it is important that the tube
should be at least 30 inches long, and should be provided with one, and
preferably with two, large eyes at its distal extremity.[Footnote 31: Such a tube (marked 19 A) is made by Tieman & Co.of New
York, and is to be had of most surgical instrument-makers.(For a
fuller description of the tube and the mode of its employment see
article by W. B. Platt, "The Mechanical Treatment of Diseases of the
Stomach," _Maryland Medical Journal_, March 8, 1884.)Oser's tube is 2 meters long, and is made of mineralized rubber.The smaller has a lumen of 8 mm.The thickness of the
wall is 2-1/2 mm.In the larger tube the lumen is 10 mm., and the
thickness of the wall 3 mm.Faucher's tube is 1-1/2 meters long.The external diameter of the tube
is 10 to 12 mm.The walls are of such thickness that the tube can be
bent without effacing its lumen.At one extremity is a lateral eye with
two orifices.To the other extremity is adapted a funnel with a
capacity of about 500 grammes.]Although the stomach-pump has the advantage of more completely
evacuating the stomach and of removing coarser solid particles than is
possible with the siphon, nevertheless its disadvantages--namely, the
possibility of inflicting injury to the mucous membrane of the
stomach,[32] the expense and greater complexity of the instrument, and
the circumstance that it should be used only by the physician--in
contrast with the advantages of the siphon--namely, its cheapness,
simplicity, safety, and possible employment by the patient or his
attendants--have led to the general adoption of the latter process.Only the soft-rubber stomach-tube should be left to the employment of
the patient.[Footnote 32: A number of cases have been recorded in which pieces of
the mucous membrane of the stomach have been detached by the
stomach-pump.Although as yet no serious effects have followed this
accident, the possibility of its occurrence can certainly not be
regarded with equanimity.]Sometimes the flow through the siphon is interrupted by occlusion of
the eye of the stomach-tube by a solid mass or by some cause not always
clear.As already mentioned, it is desirable that there should be two
openings at the gastric extremity of the tube.When the flow is {607}
interrupted the position of the tube in the stomach may be changed, or
the patient may be directed to cough or to exert the pressure of the
abdominal muscles, or more water may be allowed to run into the stomach
in order to displace an occluding mass in the tube.It is, however,
well for such cases to have, if possible, a stomach-pump and an
incompressible tube in reserve.Moreover, as is apparent from the
foregoing statement of the advantages of the stomach-pump, there are
cases in which this instrument is much more useful than the siphon, so
that one cannot decide unconditionally in favor of one instrument over
the other.The stomach-tube should be secured so that there can be no possibility
of its being swallowed entirely.A string may be attached to the distal
end of the tube.Leube[33] has reported an instance in which the whole
tube disappeared into the stomach, and Jackson[34] has also narrated a
case in which an insane patient swallowed the stomach-tube.Mary travelled to the hallway.In both
cases the tube was subsequently rejected by vomiting.[Footnote 33: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 34: _Extracts from the Records of the Boston Society for
Medical Improvement_, vol.For washing out the stomach after the greater part of the contents have
been withdrawn, about a pint of tepid fluid is allowed to slowly run
into the stomach, and is then siphoned out.This process is to be
repeated several times.In general, tepid water suffices for washing
out the stomach, but it is often better to use, at least a part of the
time, a 1 to 2 per cent.solution of bicarbonate of sodium, which
facilitates the removal of mucus.The artificial and the natural Vichy
and Carlsbad waters are also excellent for this purpose.Various
additions are also made to the water with the view of counteracting
fermentative changes in the stomach.For this purpose perhaps the best
agents are salicylate of sodium (1 per cent.solution) or resorcin (2
per cent.Other substances which have also been recommended
are carbolic acid, permanganate of potassium, hyposulphite of sodium,
creasote, benzine.Simple water, however, accomplishes about all that
is possible, and many are satisfied to use it without any medication.As regards the frequency with which the stomach is to be washed out,
one is to be guided by the symptoms and the effect obtained by the use
of the stomach-tube.As a general rule, it suffices to wash out the
stomach once a day, and often the process need be repeated only every
second or third day.Opinions are divided as to the best time of day to select for washing
out the stomach.Kussmaul recommends the morning before breakfast, and
the majority have followed his advice; others prefer the evening.There
is much, however, in favor of washing out the stomach about half an
hour before the principal meal of the day.The best opportunity has
been offered for the digestion and absorption of the food taken at the
previous main meal, and the stomach is placed in the best possible
condition for the reception of more food.The habitual washing out of the stomach is not without its drawbacks.We often remove, as has been pointed out especially by Leube, not only
noxious substances from the stomach, but also the completed products of
digestion.To withdraw from the nourishment of the body this chyme
which the stomach has laboriously manufactured cannot be a matter of
indifference.Still, with the weakened absorptive powers of the
stomach, {608} and its inability to properly propel its contents into
the intestine, it is a question how much of this chyme would eventually
be utilized for nutrition.The
relief which the patient experiences when his overloaded stomach is
freed of its burden, and the knowledge that this method of relief is
always at hand, may make him careless in the observance of the dietetic
rules which are of great importance in the treatment of this disease.It is well, therefore, not to wash out the stomach oftener than is
necessary, nor to continue the habitual use of the stomach-tube longer
than is required.There are contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube.In very
rare instances the attempt to introduce the tube causes the patient so
much distress, produces such violent spasm of the pharyngeal and
adjacent muscles, or induces so much retching and vomiting, or is
attended with such prostration or even syncope, that this method of
treatment has to be abandoned.Great weakness, recent gastric
hemorrhage, ulcer of the stomach in most cases (see page 523), often
cancer of the cardia or of the oesophagus, and aneurism of the aorta,
are contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube.If we group together the results obtained by the use of the
stomach-tube in gastric dilatation, we shall find cases in which no
benefit results; cases which are benefited, but are obliged to continue
the use of the stomach-tube throughout life; cases in which recovery is
slow and gradual; cases with more or less speedy relief or apparent
cure, but followed by relapses; and cases of prompt relief and
permanent cure.The regulation of the diet is never to be neglected in cases of
dilatation of the stomach.Here the guiding principles are that little
fluid should be taken, and that the food should be small in bulk,
nutritious, easily digestible, and not readily undergoing fermentation.The patient should drink as little water as possible, and should
therefore avoid whatever occasions thirst.It is hardly practicable to
carry out the plan of giving water mostly by the rectum, as has been
proposed.In most cases milk is useful, but an exclusively milk diet is
not generally well borne on account of the quantity of fluid required.Leube's beef-solution is often serviceable.Soft-boiled eggs and tender
meats are to be allowed, particularly the white meat of fowl and rare
beefsteak, especially that prepared from scraped and finely-chopped
beef, as recommended in the treatment of gastric ulcer (page 521).Fatty, saccharine, and amylaceous articles of food--hence most
vegetables and fruits--are to be avoided on account of their tendency
to undergo fermentation in the stomach.Alcohol in any form is usually
detrimental.If gastric symptoms, particularly vomiting, be very
urgent, or if food introduced into the stomach affords little or no
nourishment, as in some cases of tight pyloric stricture, then rectal
alimentation is to be resorted to.An important indication is to restore the tone and contractile power of
the muscular coat of the stomach.For this purpose electricity, in the
form both of the constant and of the faradic current, has been
beneficially employed.The best results are reported from the use of
the faradic current.Both poles may be applied over the region of the
stomach.The application of electricity to the inside of the stomach by
means of electrodes attached to stomach-tubes or bougies is a more
{609} difficult procedure, but has its advocates.Uniformly good
results are not obtained by the use of electricity in gastric
dilatation, but there can be no doubt that in some cases decided
benefit follows this method of treatment.Nux vomica, particularly its alkaloid strychnia, has been much employed
with the view of stimulating the muscular power of the stomach.Strychnia is given either internally or hypodermically.Hypodermic
injections of ergotin have also been used for the same purpose.It has
been hoped to increase the contraction of the stomach by cold
applications to the abdomen, as by ice-bags applied immediately after
washing out the stomach.The benefit derived from these various
attempts to increase the tonicity of the gastric muscle is not very
apparent.A belt or bandage around the abdomen in order to support the stomach
sometimes makes the patient feel more comfortable; in other cases it
aggravates the symptoms.In many cases digestion is promoted by giving dilute hydrochloric acid
with or without pepsin.About ten drops of dilute hydrochloric acid may
be given half an hour to an hour after each meal.When the stomach is systematically washed out, the individual symptoms
of dilatation of the stomach will rarely require special treatment.The
sensation of fulness and weight in the stomach, the eructations, the
vomiting, and the constipation are generally relieved, at least
temporarily, by washing out the stomach.The appetite is improved, and
an increase in weight is usually soon noticeable.If heartburn and eructations of gas continue troublesome, an antacid,
such as bicarbonate of sodium or prepared chalk, will be found useful.Leube, in order to relieve constipation and to increase the peristalsis
of the stomach, administers Carlsbad water (see page 522).Not more
than five or six ounces of the water need be given, and this should be
taken slowly in divided doses.A laxative pill containing rhubarb may
be given occasionally.If anaemia be the cause or a prominent accompaniment of dilatation of
the stomach, iron may be administered in a form as little disturbing
the digestion as possible, as the effervescing citrate or the lactate,
or arsenic in the form of Fowler's solution may be tried.In general,
however, all drugs which impair the appetite or digestion are to be
withheld.The digestion and the general condition of the patient are
often benefited by massage.Resection of the pylorus in cases of cancerous and of cicatricial
stenosis of this orifice has been performed in several instances.The
subject, as regards its medical in distinction from its surgical
bearings, has already been discussed in connection with cancer of the
stomach (see page 577).Here it may be added that the propriety of
resection is less open for dispute in cases of non-cancerous pyloric
stenosis than it is in cancer of the pylorus.Remarkable results have been reported by Loreta in cases of cicatricial
stenosis of the pylorus.After performing gastrotomy he inserts his
fingers through the constricted pyloric orifice and forcibly dilates
the stricture.[35] To judge from experience in divulsing strictures in
other parts of {610} the body, it does not seem probable that a
permanent cure can be often effected by this bold and dangerous
procedure.[Footnote 35: Loreta has performed this operation successfully no less
than nine times (_The Lancet_, April 26, 1884).]Acute Dilatation of the Stomach.Under the name acute dilatation of the stomach[36] have been described
cases in which it has been supposed that a more or less suddenly
developed paralysis of the muscular coat of the stomach exists.But the
propriety of the term acute dilatation, and the very existence of an
acute paralysis of the stomach, are, to say the least, questionable.[Footnote 36: The literature pertaining to the subject of acute
dilatation of the stomach is to be found in Poensgen, _Die Motorischen
Verrichtungen des Menschlichen Magens_, Strasburg, 1882, p.As causes of this so-called acute dilatation of the stomach have been
assigned injuries, particularly those affecting the abdomen, surgical
operations involving the peritoneum, acute inflammations of the mucous
and of the peritoneal coats of the stomach, acute fevers, especially
during convalescence, and overloading the stomach with food or with
liquids.The symptoms which have been chiefly emphasized are severe abdominal
pain, tympanitic distension of the stomach, and absence or cessation of
vomiting if this has previously existed.It will be noted that
inability to vomit under these circumstances implies not only paralysis
of the stomach, but also that of the abdominal muscles.The prognosis depends on the character of the primary disease causing
the alleged paralysis.If there be acute distension of the stomach with inability of the organ
to expel its contents either externally or into the intestine, the
stomach-tube may be employed to evacuate the gas and other material
present.In a case described by Hilton Fagge[37] as acute dilatation of the
stomach the symptoms of dilatation appeared suddenly and ran an acute
course, but the autopsy showed that the dilatation was doubtless of
much longer development than the symptoms indicated.In a case reported
by Nauwerk[38] of extreme dilatation in consequence of hypertrophic
stenosis of the pylorus, after ten months of insignificant dyspeptic
symptoms there suddenly appeared, after excess in eating, symptoms of
dilatation of great severity, which continued until a fatal termination
at the end of three months.Thus it appears that chronic dilatation of
the stomach may cause little disturbance for a considerable time and
then run a rapid course.[Footnote 37: "On Acute Dilatation of the Stomach," _Guy's Hosp.[Footnote 38: _Deutsches Arch.{611}

MINOR ORGANIC AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH.(CIRRHOSIS; HYPERTROPHIC STENOSIS OF PYLORUS; ATROPHY; ANOMALIES IN THE
FORM AND THE POSITION OF THE STOMACH; RUPTURE; GASTROMALACIA.)BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.CIRRHOSIS OF THE STOMACH.DEFINITION.--Cirrhosis of the stomach is characterized by thickening of
the walls of the greater part or of the whole of the stomach in
consequence of a new growth of fibrous tissue, combined usually with
hypertrophy of the muscular layers of the stomach.The cavity of the
stomach is usually contracted, but sometimes it is of normal size or
even dilated.SYNONYMS.--Fibroid induration of the stomach; Hypertrophy of the walls
of the stomach; Chronic interstitial gastritis; Sclerosis of the
stomach; Plastic linitis.HISTORY.--The writings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
contain many records of extremely contracted stomachs with uniformly
and greatly thickened walls (Butzen, Loseke, Storck, Portal, Lieutaud,
Pohl, etc.).In the works of Lieutaud and of Voigtel may be found
references to many such cases.[1] Doubtless, some of these cases were
examples of cirrhosis of the stomach, but in the absence of
microscopical examination it is not possible to separate these from
cancer.[Footnote 1: Lieutaud, _Historia anat.-med._, t. i. p.8, Venet., 1779;
Voigtel, _Handb.Here it
may be mentioned that Diemerbroeck's case, which is so often quoted to
prove that polyphagia instead of causing gastric dilatation may produce
hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the stomach, with contraction, was
probably an instance of cirrhosis of the stomach.]Andral[2] was the first to describe fully and systematically
hypertrophy of the walls of the stomach.He attributed the lesion to
chronic inflammation.He erroneously supposed that scirrhus of the
stomach was only hypertrophy of the gastric walls.Cruveilhier[3]
distinguished between scirrhous induration and hypertrophy, which he
considered to be a final result of the irritation accompanying chronic
diseases of the stomach.Rokitansky's[4] description of fibroid
induration of the stomach, although brief, is accurate.He says that
the process usually involves the whole {612} stomach, and that it
originates in an inflammation of the submucous connective tissue.This
inflammation may occur either independently or in combination with
gastritis mucosa.Rokitansky emphasizes the error of confounding the
disease with scirrhous cancer.Bruch[5] made an elaborate study of
hypertrophy of the walls of the stomach, which he considered to be the
final stage of various chronic diseases of the stomach.Fibrous or
scirrhous cancer he considered to be nothing but this hypertrophy.[Footnote 2: _Precis d'Anat.[Footnote 3: _Anatomie pathologique_, Paris, 1830-42.]Anat._, Wien, 1855-61.]The best descriptions of cirrhosis of the stomach have been furnished
by English writers, by most of whom it is properly regarded as an
independent disease.Brinton[6] first employed the names cirrhosis of
the stomach and plastic linitis.Excellent descriptions of the disease
have been given by Hodgkin, Budd, Brinton, Habershon, H. Jones, Wilks,
Quain, and Smith.[Footnote 6: _Diseases of the Stomach_.]While in former times cirrhosis of the stomach was confounded with
cancer, in recent times it has not been separated by many from chronic
catarrhal gastritis.In German systematic works the disease receives,
as a rule, only passing mention in connection with chronic catarrhal
gastritis.ETIOLOGY.--Cirrhosis of the stomach is rare, but it is not so
exceptional as to be without any clinical importance.I have met with
three cases at post-mortem examination.The disease is more frequent in men than in women.A considerable
number of cases have occurred between thirty and forty years of age,
but the greatest frequency is after forty.At an earlier age than
twenty the disease is very rare.The causation of cirrhosis of the stomach is obscure.Nearly all
writers upon the subject have emphasized the abuse of alcohol as an
important cause in this as in other diseases of the stomach.Intemperance cannot, however, be the only cause; and here, as
elsewhere, it is not easy to say what importance is to be attached to
it as an etiological factor.In only one of the three cases which I
examined post-mortem could it be determined that the patient was an
immoderate drinker, and in one case intemperance could be positively
excluded.Other cases have been recorded in which the abuse of spirits
could be positively excluded.In one of my cases syphilis existed, as
was established by the presence of gummata in the liver.In some cases
the disease has been attributed to cicatrization of a gastric ulcer.In
a case reported by Snellen the disease followed an injury to the
epigastric region.[7]

[Footnote 7: _Canstatt's Jahresbericht_, 1856, iii.Cirrhosis of the stomach, as well as cancer, ulcer, and most other
chronic structural diseases of this organ, is usually associated with
chronic catarrhal gastritis.There is, however, no proof of the
prevalent idea that chronic catarrhal gastritis is the cause of the
enormous new growth of fibrous tissue which characterizes typical cases
of this disease.SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS.--The symptoms of cirrhosis of the stomach
are not sufficiently characteristic to warrant a positive diagnosis.Like cancer of the
stomach, it may put on various disguises.Thus, in a case of cirrhosis
of the stomach reported by Nothnagel[8] the symptoms were {613}
typically those of progressive pernicious anaemia.Association with
ascites or with chronic peritonitis may lead to a false diagnosis.Thus, in one of the cases which I examined after death, and in which
there was chronic peritonitis with abundant fluid exudation, the
disease during life was diagnosticated as cirrhosis of the liver.Most
frequently, however, cirrhosis of the stomach is mistaken for gastric
cancer, from which, in fact, it can rarely be positively
diagnosticated.[Footnote 8: _Deutsches Arch.The symptoms are usually those of chronic dyspepsia, which sooner or
later assumes a severity which leads to the diagnosis of some grave
structural disease of the stomach, usually of cancer.Indigestion, loss of appetite, oppression in the epigastrium, vomiting,
are the common but in no way characteristic symptoms of cirrhosis of
the stomach.There may be severe gastralgia, but in general the disease
is less painful than either ulcer or cancer of the stomach.The
inability to take more than a small quantity of food or of drink at a
time, with the sense of fulness which even this small quantity
occasions, has been considered somewhat characteristic of cirrhosis of
the stomach, but this symptom is too inconstant, and occurs in too many
other affections of the stomach, to be of much service in diagnosis.The symptoms of dyspepsia are often of much longer duration than in
cancer, existing sometimes for many years (up to fifteen years), but on
the other hand there have been cases in which the clinical history of
gastric cirrhosis was as rapid in its progress as cancer.Moreover,
cancer may be preceded by dyspeptic symptoms of long duration, but long
duration is the exception with cancer and the rule with cirrhosis of
the stomach.As the disease progresses the patient loses flesh and strength, and
usually dies in a condition of marasmus.Blood is rarely present in the
vomit, but in a few cases the vomiting of coffee-ground material has
been noted.By physical examination sometimes a tumor in the region of the stomach
can be felt.Under favorable circumstances it can sometimes be
determined that this tumor is smooth, elastic, tympanitic on
percussion, and presents more or less distinctly the contours of the
stomach.By administering effervescing powder it may be possible to
obtain further evidence that the tumor corresponds in its form to the
stomach.The diagnosis of contraction of the cavity of the stomach is
not easy.Some information may be afforded by noting the length to
which the inflexible stomach-tube can be passed.The quantity of water
which can be poured into the stomach until it begins to run out of the
stomach-tube may also bring some confirmatory evidence as to the
existence of contraction of the stomach.Even should the physical signs suffice to determine that the tumor is
the thickened and contracted stomach, still cancer cannot be excluded,
for this also may grow diffusely in the gastric walls and may cause
contraction of the cavity of the stomach.With our present means of
diagnosis, therefore, the most which can be said is, that a special
combination of favorable circumstances may render probable the
diagnosis of cirrhosis of the stomach, but a positive diagnosis is
impossible.MORBID ANATOMY.--In most cases of cirrhosis of the stomach the stomach
is contracted.The cavity of the stomach has been found not larger than
would suffice to contain a hen's egg, but such extreme {614}
contraction is very rare.When the stomach in this disease is found
dilated, either the thickening involves only or chiefly the walls of
the pyloric portion, or the morbid process probably began there and was
followed by dilatation.In typical cases the walls of the entire stomach are thickened, but
frequently the thickening is most marked in the pyloric region.The
walls may measure an inch and even more in thickness.The thickened
walls are dense and firm, so that often upon incision the stomach does
not collapse.Upon transverse section the different coats of the stomach can be
distinguished.The mucous membrane is least affected, being sometimes
thickened, sometimes normal or atrophied.The muscularis mucosae is
hypertrophied, and is evident to the naked eye as a grayish band.The
submucous coat is of all the layers the most thickened, being sometimes
ten to fifteen times thicker than normal.It appears as a dense white
mass of fibrous tissue.The main muscular coat is also, as a rule,
greatly hypertrophied; the grayish, translucent muscular tissue is
pervaded with streaks of white fibrous tissue prolonged from the
submucous and subserous coats.This last coat resembles in appearance
the submucous coat, which, however, it does not equal in thickness,
although it is, proportionately to its normal thickness, much
hypertrophied.The free peritoneal surface usually appears opaque and
dense.To the naked eye it is apparent that the new growth of fibrous tissue
is most extensive in the submucous coat, which it is probably correct
to regard as the starting-point of the disease.The hypertrophy of the
muscular layers is also in most cases an important element in the
increased thickness of the gastric walls.Microscopical examination[9] shows sometimes a nearly normal mucous
membrane.The tubules, however, are usually more or less atrophied.In
the case reported by Nothnagel tubules could be found only in the
pyloric region of the stomach.The essential lesion is the new growth
of fibrillated connective tissue pervading all of the coats of the
stomach.In an interesting case reported by Marcy and Griffith,[10]
which was believed to be caused by an extensive cicatrized ulcer, a new
formation of smooth muscular tissue was found not only in the main
muscular tunic and the muscularis mucosae, but also throughout the
submucosa.This peculiarity was probably referable to the cicatrization
of the ulcer.[Footnote 9: Microscopical examination is always necessary for a
positive diagnosis of cirrhosis of the stomach.In a case which I
examined post-mortem of double ovarian cancer, with multiple secondary
deposits in the peritoneum and with chronic peritonitis, the stomach
presented the typical gross appearances of cirrhosis, but here and
there were to be found nests of cancer-cells in the prevailing new
growth of fibrous tissue in the walls of the stomach.]Sci._, July, 1884, p.Not infrequently adhesions exist between the stomach and surrounding
organs.Exceptionally, a diffuse growth of fibrous tissue may invade
the greater part of the peritoneum, particularly the visceral layer,
and cause a thickening similar to that existing in the stomach.In such
cases ascites is usually a marked symptom.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of cirrhosis of the stomach is grave.The
disease runs a chronic course, and usually terminates in death by
asthenia.There is no reason to believe that the stomach can ever be
restored to its {615} normal condition.Still, cases have been reported
in which it has been supposed that cirrhosis of the stomach has
terminated in recovery.[11] The diagnosis, however, in such cases must
remain doubtful.[Footnote 11: Lesser, _Cirrhosis Ventriculi_, Inaug.Diss., Berlin,
1876; Smith, "Cirrhosis of the Stomach," _Edinb.TREATMENT.--The treatment is symptomatic, and is to be guided by the
general principles developed in previous articles concerning the
regulation of the diet and the administration of remedies.HYPERTROPHIC STENOSIS OF THE PYLORUS.The various causes of stenosis of the pylorus have already been
mentioned under DILATATION OF THE STOMACH, and the most important of
these causes have received full consideration in connection with ULCER
and with CANCER OF THE STOMACH.Only one of the varieties of pyloric stenosis can claim consideration
as an independent disease.This variety is the so-called hypertrophic
stenosis of the pylorus (Lebert) or fibroid degeneration of the pylorus
(Habershon[12]).Under the name of hypertrophic stenosis have been
described cases in which the stenosis was due to hypertrophy of only
one of the coats of the stomach, usually either the submucous or the
muscular coat, sometimes only the mucous coat.In most cases, however,
all of the coats of the stomach are involved, and the lesion is similar
to that of cirrhosis of the stomach, but it is confined to the pylorus
or to the pyloric region.In such cases there is new growth of fibrous
tissue, most marked in the submucous coat, and hypertrophy of the
muscular coat.The appearance of the pylorus in some instances of
hypertrophic stenosis has been not inappropriately compared to that of
the cervix uteri.[Footnote 12: Habershon, _On Diseases of the Abdomen_, London, 1862;
Lebert, _Die Krankh.d. Magens_, Tubingen, 1878; Nauwerk, _Deutsches
Arch.In the majority of cases the change here described is the result of
cicatrization of a gastric ulcer, and some believe that all cases of
so-called hypertrophic stenosis or fibroid degeneration of the pylorus
are referable to ulcer, although it may be very difficult to discover
the cicatrix of the ulcer.It is certainly not always possible to
detect either ulcer or cicatrix, so that it seems proper to regard the
hypertrophic stenosis in such cases as constituting an independent
affection.The symptoms are those of dilatation of the stomach, sometimes preceded
by evidences of chronic catarrhal gastritis.The thickened pylorus can
sometimes be felt during life as a small, cylindrical, usually movable
tumor, either stationary in progress or of very slow growth.In most cases the diagnosis of organic stenosis of the pylorus can be
made.Cancer may sometimes be excluded by the long duration of the
symptoms and the stationary character of the tumor if a tumor can be
felt.The exclusion of ulcer is more difficult and hardly possible, for
ulcer may have existed without producing characteristic symptoms.The prognosis and treatment have been considered under DILATATION OF
THE STOMACH.{616} ATROPHY OF THE STOMACH.Atrophy of the stomach may be the result of stenosis of the cardia or
of the oesophagus.The stomach may participate with other organs in the
general atrophy attending inanition and marasmus.The walls of a
dilated stomach may be very thin.Especial importance has been attached in recent years to degeneration
and atrophy of the gastric tubules.The glands of the stomach may
undergo degeneration and atrophy in various diseases of the stomach,
such as chronic catarrhal gastritis, phlegmonous gastritis, cirrhosis
of the stomach, and cancer of the stomach.Parenchymatous and fatty
degeneration of the glandular cells of the stomach occurs in acute
infectious diseases, as typhoid fever and yellow fever, also as a
result of poisoning with phosphorus, arsenic, and the mineral acids.It is claimed by Fenwick that atrophy of the stomach may occur not only
as a secondary change, but also as a primary disease attended by grave
symptoms.Fenwick has described a number of cases in which the gastric
tubules were atrophied without thickening of the walls of the stomach
and without diminution in the size of the cavity of the stomach--cases,
therefore, which cannot be classified with cirrhosis of the
stomach.[13] He attributes in many cases the atrophy of the tubules to
an increase in the connective tissue of the mucous membrane, and draws
a comparison between atrophy of the stomach and the atrophic form of
chronic Bright's disease.[Footnote 13: _The Lancet_, 1877, July 7 _et seq._]

In 1860, Flint[14] called attention to the relation between anaemia and
atrophy of the gastric glands.He expressed the opinion that some cases
of obscure and profound anaemia are dependent upon degeneration and
atrophy of the glands of the stomach.Since Flint's publication cases
have been reported by Fenwick, Quincke, Brabazon, and Nothnagel, in
which lesions supposed to be due to pernicious anaemia have been found
after death associated with atrophy of the gastric tubules.[15]
Nothnagel's case, which has already been mentioned, was one of
cirrhosis of the stomach.[Footnote 14: A. Flint, _American Medical Times_, 1860.Further
contributions of Flint to this subject are to be found in the _New York
Medical Journal_, March, 1871, and in his _Treatise on the Principles
and Practice of Medicine_, p.[Footnote 15: Fenwick, _loc.cit._; Quincke, _Volkmann's Samml.100 (case _b_); Brabazon, _British Med.Journ._, 1878,
July 27 (without microscopical examination!); Nothnagel, _Deutsches
Arch.The symptoms which have been referred to primary atrophy of the stomach
are severe anaemia and disturbances of digestion, such as anorexia,
eructations, and vomiting.The digestive disturbances are often not
greater than are frequently observed in cases of severe anaemia.In my opinion, the existence of atrophy of the stomach as a primary and
independent disease has not been established.In many cases which have
been described as primary atrophy the histological investigation of the
stomach has been very defective.Degeneration and atrophy of the
gastric tubules secondary to various diseases of the stomach and to
certain general diseases is an important lesion when it is extensive,
and must seriously impair the digestion, and consequently the
nutrition, of the patient.{617} ANOMALIES IN THE FORM AND IN THE POSITION OF THE STOMACH.These anomalies, so far as they have not received consideration in
previous articles, are of more anatomical than clinical interest, and
therefore here require only brief mention.The stomach may have an hour-glass shape in consequence of a
constriction separating the cardiac from the pyloric half of the organ.This constriction is sometimes congenital,[16] sometimes caused by
cicatrization of a gastric ulcer, and sometimes caused by spasmodic
contraction of the muscle, which may persist after death, but
disappears when the stomach is artificially distended.Hour-glass shape
of the stomach has been diagnosed during life by administering an
effervescing powder according to Frerichs' method.[Footnote 16: A careful study of the congenital form of hour-glass
contraction of the stomach has been made by W. R. Williams ("Ten Cases
of Congenital Contraction of the Stomach," _Journ.and
Physiology_, 1882-83, p.Foreign substances of hard consistence which have been swallowed
sometimes cause diverticula of the stomach.Sometimes the fundus of the stomach is but little developed, so that
the organ is long and narrow like a piece of intestine.The stomach may be variously distorted by external pressure, as from
tumors and by adhesions.The loop-shaped stomach and vertical position of the stomach have been
already considered in connection with DILATATION OF THE STOMACH (page
602).In transposition of the viscera the stomach is also transposed.In such
a case difficulties may arise in the diagnosis of pyloric cancer, as in
a case described by Legroux.The stomach may be found in hernial sacs.Mention has already been made
of the presence of dilated stomachs in scrotal hernia.More frequently
the stomach is found in umbilical hernias.In diaphragmatic hernia the
stomach is found more frequently in the thorax than is any other
abdominal viscus.In 266 diaphragmatic hernias collected by Lascher[17]
the stomach was found either wholly or partly in the thorax in 161
cases.The clinical consideration of diaphragmatic hernia, however,
does not belong here.[Footnote 17: _Deutsches Arch.Furthermore, the stomach may be displaced by tumors, enlargement of
neighboring organs, tight-lacing, adhesions, and the weight of hernias.These displacements, however, are generally inconsiderable and of
little importance.In a case described by Mazotti[18] the stomach, of which the pyloric
portion was fixed by adhesions, was twisted around its long axis.[Footnote 18: _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1874, ii.{618} RUPTURE OF THE STOMACH.Sufficient attention has already been given to perforation of the
stomach in consequence of diseases of its walls, such as ulcer, cancer,
abscesses, and toxic gastritis.A healthy stomach may be ruptured by violent injury to the abdomen even
when no external wound is produced.An example of rupture of the
stomach from this cause is that sometimes produced when a person has
been run over by a heavy vehicle.It has been claimed that a stomach with healthy walls may burst in
consequence of over-distension of the organ with solids or with gas.The older literature is especially rich in reports of so-called
spontaneous rupture of the stomach.Most of these cases were examples
of perforation of gastric ulcer.In a case of apparently spontaneous
rupture of a stomach which had become abnormally distended with gas,
Chiari[19] found that the rupture was through the cicatrix of a simple
ulcer in the lesser curvature.It is hardly conceivable that rupture of
the healthy stomach from over-distension can occur so long as the
orifices of the organ are unobstructed.Lautschner[20] reports a case of spontaneous rupture of the stomach in
a woman seventy years old with an enormous umbilical hernia which
contained the pyloric portion of the stomach.After drinking eight
glasses of water and two cups of tea and eating meat, she was seized
with vomiting, during which the stomach burst with a report which was
audible to the patient and to those around her.She passed into a state
of collapse and died in thirteen hours.A rent several centimeters long
was found in the posterior wall of the stomach.Lautschner thinks that
the pylorus was bent in the hernial sac so as to be obstructed.In the
walls of the stomach he found no evidence of pre-existing disease.[Footnote 20: _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1881, ii.]There is no satisfactory proof of the possibility of the occurrence of
rupture of a stomach with healthy walls except as a result of external
violence.The symptoms and treatment of rupture of the stomach are those of
perforation of the stomach, and have already been described.That the subject of gastromalacia should still occupy so much space in
medical works the purpose of which is mainly clinical proves that many
physicians still cling to the belief that this process may occur during
life.It is, nevertheless, certain that the condition which, according
to the ordinary and traditional use of the term, is designated
gastromalacia, is always a post-mortem process and is without the
slightest clinical significance.So long as the circulation of the
blood in the walls of the stomach is undisturbed, self-digestion of
this organ cannot occur.No one doubts {619} that parts of the gastric
walls in which the circulation has been arrested, and which are exposed
to the gastric juice, undergo self-digestion, as has already been set
forth in the article on GASTRIC ULCER.To describe cases of this nature
under the name of gastromalacia, however, is misleading, and can cause
only confusion, for the long-continued discussion as to whether
gastromalacia is a vital or a cadaveric process applied certainly to a
different conception of the term.In some of the cases which have been
published, even in recent years, in support of the vitalistic theory of
gastromalacia, and in which it has been proven that perforation of the
stomach occurred during life, the solution of continuity took place
through parts of the gastric walls in which the circulation had already
been obstructed, particularly by extensive hemorrhagic infiltration.Some of these cases are probably also examples of perforation of
gastric ulcer or of rupture of cicatrices from over-distension of the
stomach, in which post-mortem digestion of the edges of the ulcer or of
the cicatrix obscured the real nature of the process.The subject of
gastromalacia should be relegated wholly to works on physiology and on
pathological anatomy.{620}

INTESTINAL INDIGESTION.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.NATURE.--The term indigestion in its most common meaning refers to
gastric indigestion only.This limitation has arisen from the fact that
gastric digestion has been more thoroughly understood than intestinal
digestion, and because the symptoms, flatulence, acidity, eructations
of gas, pyrosis, and vomiting of unaltered food, are readily referred
to the stomach as their source.Intestinal digestion has not been well
known until within a recent date, and its phenomena in disease have
been mistaken for other pathological conditions.From the important and complex function of the intestinal juices, and
the very great share they take in the solution of food, there must be
many phases of departure from the normal state.The processes of
intestinal digestion are more intricate than those of gastric
digestion, of a higher grade, and the chemical reactions are more
numerous, depending upon the participation of the bile, the pancreatic
juice, and the succus entericus; while intestinal absorption is a more
complex act than that of gastric absorption.A brief review of the physiology of intestinal digestion will be of aid
in making clear its pathology.The object of all digestion is to make such a solution of the ingesta
that they may pass through animal membrane and so enter the system.Mechanical disintegration and simple solution do something toward this,
but for substances insoluble in water a more thorough change is brought
about by ferments which convert insoluble into soluble compounds.Mastication breaks up the
masses of food; the saliva softens them, dissolves soluble substances,
as salt and sugar, and thus the pleasures of the palate are enhanced.The ferment ptyalin acts upon starch (boiled starch being more rapidly
altered than unboiled), and changes it to dextrin and grape-sugar, both
of which are diffusible through animal membrane, entering lymph-spaces
and blood-vessels.The greater part of the saliva secreted is swallowed
with the food or in the intervals of eating.The amount formed in
twenty-four hours varies from 1500 gm.(Bidder and Schmidt) to 700 gm.It must therefore serve some ulterior purpose in the stomach.Ewald[1] says that saliva converts starch into sugar in acid as well as
in alkaline and neutral solutions.But Langley[2] asserts that the
ferment of {621} saliva is destroyed by the hydrochloric acid of the
gastric juice.The longer food is subjected to mastication and
insalivation, the more thorough is the mouth digestion and the better
prepared is the mass for the action of the gastric and intestinal
juices.It is asserted that fatty matters are emulsified to a certain
extent by the alkaline ferments of the saliva.[Footnote 1: _Lectures on Digestion_, New York, 1881, p.[Footnote 2: "On the Destruction of Ferments in the Alimentary Canal,"
_Journal of Physiology_, London, Jan., 1882, p.When the food enters the stomach the nitrogenous (albuminoid) elements
are attacked by the gastric juice, the bundles of muscular fibre are
broken up, the fibrillae are reduced to a granular mass, but not
completely dissolved (Frerichs), the fat-globules are freed from their
envelopes of connective tissue, milk is coagulated, and the casein is
dissolved."The tangible, practical object of this change is to form out of a
little-diffusible body (albumen) one easily diffusible (peptone), which
is capable of absorption through animal membrane in a higher degree
than ordinary albumen" (Ewald).Peptone is formed out of ordinary
albumen, as grape-sugar is formed out of starch, by taking up water; it
is therefore the hydrate of albumen.The more tardy the digestion in the stomach the more highly charged
with acid is the gastric juice.According to Wright, the degree of
alkalinity of the saliva is in proportion to the acidity of the stomach
fluids, and Bence Jones has observed that during the excretion of acid
in the stomach the total alkalinity of all alkaline digestive fluids is
increased.The lesson is thus learned that a too careful preparation of
food, so as to shorten and lessen gastric labor, diminishes the
activity of the gastric juice as well as that of all other digestive
fluids.Intestinal digestion begins when the softened mass passes through the
pylorus.This mass (chyme) is composed of (1) the products of gastric
digestion which have not been absorbed--peptone, dextrose, levulose,
peptonized gelatin, with mucus and gastric juice; (2) all matters which
have escaped digestion--the starch of vegetable substances, dissolved
gelatin and albumen which have not been peptonized, and some unaltered
muscle-structure; and (3) fat, fatty acids, and cellulose upon which
neither saliva nor gastric juice has had any influence (Ewald).This complex semi-fluid mass with an acid reaction enters the duodenum
and comes in contact with fluids and ferments destined to work
remarkable changes in its composition.The first of these fluids is the
bile, which is alkaline and composed of the glycocholate and
taurocholate of sodium, cholesterin, soaps, etc., phosphates and
carbonates of lime and sodium, chlorides of potassium and sodium,
bile-pigment, etc.The outflow of bile is excited by the contact of the
chyme with the orifice of the bile-duct.When the alkaline bile is
mingled with the acid mass in the duodenum, it neutralizes its acidity,
precipitates the peptones, and therefore stops all further action of
the gastric juice.Fats containing free fatty acids are emulsified,
soaps being formed by a combination of the alkalies of the bile with
the fatty acids.Lastly, bile hinders fermentation in the intestine and
acts as a purgative by exciting peristalsis.Absorption is probably
also favored by bile, as it has been found that emulsified fats pass
more readily through an animal membrane which has been wet with
bile.[3]

[Footnote 3: Ewald thinks this result is doubtful: in animals killed
during digestion he has found an acid reaction in the contents of the
intestine beyond the opening of the bile-duct, with no precipitation of
the albumen (_op.{622} As far as we now know, the function of the bile is to neutralize
the acidity of the duodenal contents, and thus pave the way for the
action of a digesting fluid of much greater potency and of much higher
function.[4]

[Footnote 4: In order still further to demonstrate the necessity of
bile-action as a preparation for pancreatic digestion, it may be
mentioned that in artificial experiments, with a heat equal to that of
the body, if antiseptics analogous to gastric juice and bile are not
used, there is a too rapid change from alkalinity to acidity, and
consequently all of the starch is not converted into sugar before it
develops lactic acid with putrefactive disorganization.A deficiency of
bile, therefore, is a cause of intestinal indigestion (Bartlett, _op.This fluid, the pancreatic juice, is composed of inorganic salts,
albuminoids, and certain specific ferments, and has an alkaline
reaction.It has a threefold operation upon the softened mass with
which it now comes in contact: 1.The starch of vegetable matter, which
has been only slightly acted on up to this time, is now rapidly
converted into grape-sugar by a peculiar diastatic ferment more active
than any other known ferment.Albuminous matters (proteids) which
have escaped digestion in the stomach are changed into a soluble and
absorbable pancreas--peptone.Trypsin is the active ferment in this
case (Kuhne), and it is only in alkaline or neutral solutions that the
albuminoids are readily dissolved.The necessity of neutralization by
the alkaline bile is thus demonstrated.A ferment distinct from the
others splits the fats into fatty acids and glycerin, and emulsifies
them so that they can be taken up by the lacteals lower down.Experiments made by mixing albuminates with pancreatic gland-extract,
under favorable conditions, show after a certain time the presence of
leucin, tyrosin, hypoxanthin, and asparaginic acid.In a feebly
alkaline or neutral solution a faint putrefactive odor is soon noticed,
with the development of bacteria; ammonia, sulphuretted hydrogen,
hydrogen, and carbonic acid--evidences of the putrefaction of
albumen--are also detected.It is difficult to tell when normal digestion in the intestines ends
and putrefaction begins.The conclusion is, that the normal action of
pancreatic juice (trypsin) gives origin to bodies met with in the
ordinary putrefaction of albumen.[5] This thin border-line between
normal intestinal digestion and the decomposition of the intestinal
contents has an important bearing on the facts of intestinal
indigestion.[Footnote 5: Ewald, _op.The intestinal juice performs a minor but independent part in
digestion.It converts albuminous matter into peptone, and hydrated
starch into sugar.Its function is therefore supplementary to that of
the gastric and pancreatic secretions.[6]

[Footnote 6: Ewald, _op.103; also, "The Functions of the
Intestinal Juice," Charles L. Dana, _Med.News_, Philada., July 15,
1882, p.When food enters the mouth the process of digestion begins, and all the
activities of the glands concerned in digestion are probably at once
set in motion.Mastication excites, by reflex action, pancreatic
secretion; the acid chyme touches the orifice of the common bile-duct
and stimulates the outflow of bile; the neutralized chyme next invites
pancreatic digestion.For the integrity of intestinal digestion it is
required that mastication and stomach digestion should be normally
performed.The intestinal movements which are so necessary to digestion by making
successive changes in the position of the intestinal contents are {623}
controlled by nervous arrangements, but may occur independently of the
central nervous system.The ganglia of Auerbach and of Meissner in the
intestinal wall are sufficient for the development of peristaltic
waves.The irritation of the mucous membrane by food, hyperaemia, and
the pouring out of digestive juices, and intestinal movements, are
parts of one process.Paralysis by section of the splanchnic leads to
hyperaemia of the intestinal vessels and increased peristalsis;
stimulation of the splanchnic causes anaemia of the intestinal wall and
arrest of movement.Local cold by producing anaemia brings about the
same result.The products of digestion as they pass toward the jejunum consist of
diffusible peptones, sugar, emulsified fats and oils, and substances
which have escaped digestion, as fragments of muscular fibre,
starch-corpuscles, connective tissue, hairs, or other foreign matters.The bowel contains also carbonic acid, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphuretted
hydrogen, and marsh gas.The mass, alkaline or neutral in the duodenum
and jejunum, becomes acid in the ileum from the putrefaction of albumen
and fermentation.The peptones and sugar pass by osmosis into the
blood-vessels of the portal system and thence to the liver.In the
liver the sugar is converted into glycogen (carbohydrate), and stored
in the liver-cells until needed for the maintenance of animal heat and
for the nutrition of the tissues.The peptones are used in part to
supply the nitrogenous waste of tissue, but much of the albuminoid
matter is broken up in the liver into glycogen and urea, the latter of
which is excreted by the kidneys as waste matter.The minute granules of oil in emulsion are taken up by the epithelial
cells covering the villi; thence they enter the adenoid tissue of the
villi on their way to the lymphatic radicles, the lacteals.From here
the passage is open to the underlying lymphatic vessels and to the
larger abdominal lymph-vessels and the thoracic duct beyond.Intestinal digestion is not completed and the body does not receive its
pabulum until the products of digestion have reached the liver and the
thoracic duct.ETIOLOGY.--It is usually said that intestinal dyspepsia is more common
in women than in men, but the contrary is the rule.Some of its most
common causes--over-eating and the eating of indigestible food--are
especially vices of men.It is more frequent between the ages of forty and fifty, but no age is
exempt.Infants at the breast, children of any age, adults, and old men
and women are alike subject to it.Men in middle life begin to suffer
from the imprudence and carelessness of youth and from the anxiety and
cares of business.The indulged children of rich parents and improperly
bottle-fed infants frequently suffer.Heredity and idiosyncrasy have a certain influence in determining the
prevalence of intestinal dyspepsia.The distaste for and inability to
digest vegetables, fruits, and fats are often peculiarities of family
history.The occurrence of cases in the same family is often explained
by improper food, bad cooking, and irregular hours, to the evil
influences of which all the members are similarly subjected.All conditions of the organism which result in a depraved or altered
blood-supply, as anaemia, primary and secondary rachitis, chronic
syphilis, and continued febrile diseases, are causes of intestinal
indigestion.{624} The connection of the indigestion of fats with the
strumous diathesis and with phthisis is undisputed.J. Hughes Bennett
traced the origin of phthisis to defective fat-digestion; strumous
indigestion and the indigestion of fat are synonymous terms.Debilitating influences, such as bad air, want of cleanliness and
outdoor exercise, impair functional activity in the intestines as
elsewhere.Sexual excesses, but especially masturbation, have a special
influence for evil in this direction.The influence of the mind upon the digestion of starch and fats is even
greater than upon gastric digestion, for no other reason perhaps than
that the former is a more complex function and less easily relieved
than the latter.Prolonged or excessive mental labor does not do so
much harm as mental worry, over-anxiety, and the strain and overwork of
business.Professional men--lawyers, physicians, and clergymen--who
become over-burdened with responsibilities, and who sympathize too much
with the distresses of others, are very prone to suffer.The careworn
face with lines about the mouth and forehead is one of the plainest
signs of duodenal defect.The proper secretion of the juices of the
intestine and normal peristalsis are impossible where brain and nerves
get no rest.The too rapid mental development of the children of the
present day is a fruitful source of weakened fat-and-starch digestion
and of impaired development.So long as children are sent to the public
school at four and six years of age, there will continue to grow up a
precocious race with active brains in feeble bodies.[7] This injurious
result is largely brought about by the direct interference of premature
brain-development with the complex intestinal processes of digestion
and absorption.[Footnote 7: In eight of the States and Territories the minimum age for
entering the public school is fixed at four years; in seventeen States
at five years; in the others, except two, at six years.The two notable
exceptions are Alabama and New Mexico, where children do not enter
school until the age of seven.]Wealth, with ease and inactivity, and sedentary occupations, contribute
to the same end by lessening the need of food, and thus debilitating
the organs of digestion by inaction.Sedentary pursuits, especially
those in which the body is bent forward and constricted or compressed
at the waist, interfere with active function in the intestine.This is
the case in tailors, shoemakers, etc.Tight-lacing in women and a too
tight trouser-band in men are injurious.Hot climates, especially when combined with dampness, lead to disorder
in the intestine and liver.This effect is most marked among persons
coming from colder climates, as among the English in India, who keep up
the habits of eating to which they have been accustomed at home.The
lessened demand destroys the appetite, and stimulants and condiments
are resorted to to whip up the inactive functions.The intestine is
loaded with a mass of crude, unaltered matter which can with difficulty
be disposed of.Chronic indigestion results, varied with acute attacks
of diarrhoea or dysentery.The portal system is filled with an excess
of albuminoid material which the liver is unable to store away.The
excess is got rid of by conversion into uric acid.Lithaemia and
chronic congestion and enlargement of the overloaded liver result, with
their many attendant evils.Over-eating occasions first gastric and then intestinal indigestion by
the {625} entrance of unaltered food into the duodenum.Eating without
hunger often involves the taking of food which the body does not need
and which the stomach cannot digest.Diners-out rarely go through a
season without one or more internal revolts.A too-varied diet, a
dinner of many dishes, is faulty in variety as well as in excess.On
the other hand, a too great sameness in diet and the prolonged use of
one or two articles of food which are not easy of digestion, and which
have a great deal of waste, fatigue and then disorder intestinal
digestion.This is a fault into which children are often allowed to
fall.Indigestible food and an excess of starchy or fatty food conduce to
disorder of duodenal digestion.In conditions of debility and anaemia
and in the convalescence of fevers the deficiency of saliva involves an
inability to digest starch in the mouth and points to a corresponding
want in the duodenal secretions.The improper use of alcoholic liquors,
taking them on an empty stomach between meals and in excess, tends to
direct irritation of the mucous tract.Condiments in large quantity
have the same effect.Irregularity in the hours of eating and a faulty distribution of the
amount of food disturb the perfect working of the mechanism of
digestion.Very light breakfasts and very late and large dinners are
injurious.The habit, now quite general in cities, of deferring the
breakfast proper until midday, leaves the system too long--fifteen to
sixteen hours--without proper food and weakens digestive activity.Intestinal indigestion is very common among Americans who have lived
abroad and adopted European customs.Another cause which is unfortunately very common is the imperfect
mastication and insalivation of food, due to too great haste in eating,
to defects in the teeth or gums, or to a deficiency of saliva.The
saliva no doubt sometimes possesses a feeble diastatic power, although
abundant in amount.Carnivorous animals bolt their food, but
vegetable-eaters must masticate.Slow mastication transforms starch
into sugar, and at the same time excites secretive activity in the
glands of the digestive tract, especially in the pancreas.The more
thoroughly this preliminary function is performed the better
preparation is there for the subsequent acts of digestion.[8]

[Footnote 8: "The familiar act of chewing is seldom a subject of
reflection, yet it throws into motion a more complicated system of
levers, accompanied by a drain of fluids from more curiously adapted
apparatus, than the arts can parallel" (Leared, _On Indigestion_,
London, 1863, p.The chewing of tobacco, a wretched habit which is much less common now
than formerly, and to a less extent the habit of smoking, are causes of
deficient, altered, or depraved saliva, and secondarily of altered
pancreatic secretion.The thin smoker grows fat when he abandons the
weed.The normal functions of the intestines are interfered with and
indigestion is set up by constipation.Every one has felt the activity
in digestion which accompanies the regular habit of defecation, and the
torpor and oppression which depend upon an unemptied colon."There is a
concert of action in virtue of which the whole muscular apparatus of
the digestive tube sympathizes with that of the large intestine.This
concert of action, which induces pathological states, is the reason why
in the {626} physiological state a regular contraction of the whole
intestinal tube, including the stomach, is the consequence of the
regular contraction of the large intestine."[9]

[Footnote 9: Trousseau, "Les Dyspepsies," _L'Union medicale_, tome xi.,
1857, p.An excess of acid in the stomach would enfeeble the solvent power of
the intestinal fluids by antagonizing neutralization by the alkaline
bile; the same effect follows any cause which prevents the outflow of
the bile, as the plugging of the common bile-duct by mucus and
epithelium in catarrh or by an impacted gall-stone.The emulsification
of fats is incomplete and decomposition in the intestine follows.The
antagonism of the saliva and the gastric juice, of the gastric juice
(or the chyme) and the bile, must preserve their delicate and nice
adjustment in order for digestion to be properly performed.Diseases of the pancreas seriously embarrass digestion in the
intestine.Lesions of this organ, as catarrh of the duct, cancer, fatty
degeneration, etc., may result in impaired emulsification of fats,
fatty diarrhoea, and wasting.Intestinal indigestion accompanies hyperaemia and catarrh of the
intestinal mucous membrane, diseases of the heart, lungs, and liver,
and all other causes which impede portal circulation.SYMPTOMS.--Intestinal indigestion cannot be so clearly pictured as that
of gastric dyspepsia.This is owing to the frequent concurrence of the
two conditions, the gastric symptoms taking precedence of the others.The more complex nature of the intestinal function is another reason,
intestinal indigestion having more modifications in its phenomena.In
the stomach there is only one active secretion; in the intestine there
are three, all participants in the act of solution.An alteration in
the quality or quantity of one of these--the bile, for example--would
lead to different symptomatic results than would follow another
defective secretion, as that of the pancreas, for instance.Clinical
study has not yet fully differentiated the forms of indigestion due to
these several deficiencies.But there are certain well-defined symptoms
associated with intestinal disorders which are distinguished by their
seat, time of their appearance, and their character from analogous
symptoms connected with the stomach.Intestinal indigestion may be acute or chronic.The latter is the more
typical and more common form.When a sudden attack of indigestion in the intestine results from the
entrance into the duodenum of food in such a state that it cannot be
digested, the result is the rapid development of pain, flatulence,
borborygmi, and frequently of fever, ending in diarrhoea, with the
escape perhaps of the offending matter: a condition then exists which
may be called acute or subacute intestinal catarrh or acute intestinal
indigestion.One name would be as correct as the other.Slight acute
forms are marked by a coated tongue, loss of appetite, headache, pains
in the limbs, distress in the epigastrium or right hypochondrium,
flatulence, and constipation.These might be accompanied by symptoms
indicating a disorder of the liver functions--light- stools,
slight jaundice, lithates in the urine.But intestinal indigestion
alone can cause these symptoms without the condition of so-called
biliousness being present.The local symptoms are due to the presence
in the intestine of an {627} imperfectly-altered mass and the
development of gas; some of the general symptoms are reflex; others, as
headache and lassitude and pain in the limbs, come from the absorption
into the blood of the gases, particularly sulphuretted hydrogen.The
participation of the stomach in acute attacks of this sort modifies the
symptoms as here described.Such attacks are apt to recur at intervals.If the causes which bring about acute disorder in the intestine are
allowed to continue, the intervals between the acute or subacute
attacks diminish, and there is in time a fixed state of chronic
intestinal dyspepsia in which the partly-altered food coming from the
stomach is not properly prepared for absorption.Instead of digestion
there is decomposition; the transition is easy from the one to the
other of these states.The symptoms connected in this case with the
digestive organs are pain, occurring from two to six hours after
eating, in the right hypochondrium, the epigastrium, or the umbilical
region, due to distension of the intestine with gas.This pain is dull,
not always fixed, lasts from one to three hours, and is accompanied by
tenderness on pressure over its seat.Tympanites, borborygmi, and a sensation of fulness in the abdomen
accompany the pain or may exist without it.Gaseous accumulations in
the intestine, the cause of these symptoms, have an independent source,
being produced by decomposition in the gut itself, and are not due to
the descent of gases from the stomach through the pylorus.What is a
physiological and temporary condition becomes in disease a distressing
symptom of long duration.In intestinal indigestion the gut is nearly
always inflated with gas, which in its movement produces rumbling
noises.In acute indigestion it is rapidly formed in large amount, and
by the stretching of the wall of the bowel and pressure on
nerve-filaments causes intense pain--colic.In the chronic form the
distension excites uneasy sensations, prevents sleep, and may be so
great as to cause dyspnoea by pushing the diaphragm upward.When the
small intestine is distended the greatest swelling may be about the
umbilicus, or the abdomen may be evenly rounded.When the colon is
chiefly or solely inflated, its outline across the upper part or at the
sides of the abdomen can be easily made out.It is produced by a loss of
contractility of the intestinal wall.The more direct causes are
over-distension of the gut and disturbance in the circulation and
innervation of its walls.The stools are hard and dry, and are expelled
with difficulty.Sometimes they are coated with shreds or films of
mucus, the product of a chronic catarrh of the mucous membrane of the
colon, or mucus from the small intestine is intimately mixed with the
mass.Diarrhoea may alternate with constipation.The passage of
unaltered food, as fragments of meat, vegetables, or fruit, clearly
shows the extent to which indigestion exists.By the microscope
particles of food which have escaped complete disintegration may be
detected.Very dark-green or black discharges
show an excess of bile; light-yellow or gray slate-, a
deficiency.Stools of the latter character are highly offensive in
odor.Hemorrhoids are often present, being due to the sluggish portal
circulation and to the pressure of hard fecal masses in the rectum.The
appetite is not impaired, as a rule, but it may be fitful or irregular.A bad {628} taste in the mouth, and a swollen, relaxed, and coated
tongue may exist without any decided gastric disease.The symptoms of disorder of the nervous system are more marked than in
gastric dyspepsia.This results not so much from the depressing
influences of pain as from the peculiar malnutrition of the
nerve-tissue.In order to have furnished to the blood the pabulum out
of which the nerve-
